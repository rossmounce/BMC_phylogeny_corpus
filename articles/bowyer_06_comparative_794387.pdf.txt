Abstract
Background: Allergy is a common debilitating and occasionally life threatening condition. The
fungal kingdom contains a number of species that produce a wide range of well defined protein
allergens although the vast majority of fungal species have unknown allergenic potential. The recent
genome sequencing of a variety of fungi provides the opportunity to assess the occurrence of
allergen orthologues across the fungal kingdom. Here we use comparative genomics to survey the
occurrence of allergen orthologues in fungi.
Results: A database of 82 allergen sequences was compiled and used to search 22 fungal genomes.
Additionally we were able to model allergen structure for representative members of several highly
homologous allergen orthologue classes. We found that some allergen orthologue classes that had
predicted structural congruence to allergens and allergen epitopes were ubiquitous in all fungi.
Other allergen orthologues classes were less well conserved and may not possess conserved
allergen epitope orthologues in all fungi. A final group of allergen orthologues, including the major
allergens Asp f 1 and Alt a 1, appear to be present in only a limited number of species.
Conclusion: These results imply that most fungi may possess proteins that have potential to be
allergens or to cross react with allergens. This, together with the observation that important
allergens such as Asp f 1 are limited to genera or species, has significant implications for
understating fungal sensitization, and interpreting diagnosis and management of fungal allergy.

Background
Allergy is a common ailment seen with increasing frequency in the developing world [1-4]. Although allergies
are known to be caused by an enhanced type 2 immune
response the defining characteristics of the causative
agents of allergenicity are not well understood. Many proteins responsible for allergic reactions have been
described. Despite intensive efforts to determine what dis-

tinguishes these proteins from the other non-allergens in
the same proteome, little is understood about the structural basis for allergenicity. We also do not understand
why some organisms are often associated with allergy and
other closely related organisms are never or only rarely
observed to cause allergy. One explanation is that species
not associated with allergy do not possess genes encoding
allergen proteins. Alternatively allergen orthologues may

pathogens, gut inhabitants and endophytes of man (Figure 1). Respiratory exposure to a wide range of fungal
spores and fragments is almost constant [5-7]. According
to allergen databases 189 fungal species are thought to
produce allergens (Bowyer, unpublished observations).
Several studies have linked exposure to high levels of fungal spores with episodes of asthma, some life-threatening
[8]. Indeed we recently described substantial fungal loads
in bed pillows [9] which implies frequent exposure to
high levels of fungal spores or hyphal fragments.

be common in all organisms and allergenicity could be
determined by rigorous sequence or epitope requirement,
the context or timing of presentation of proteins to the
immune system, or by third-party factors expressed by a
colonising organism or present in the environment. However too few species have been studied in this way and it
is likely that many undiscovered fungal allergens in fact
exist.
A crucial first step in evaluating allergen distribution is to
determine whether allergen orthologues are present in
ostensibly non-allergen producing species and to what
extent. Homology to existing allergen sequences is a useful, though imperfect, tool for prediction of whether an
unknown protein may either be allergenic or cross reactive at either T cell, B cell or mast cell level. However
homology to allergens can be determined for all proteins
in a given proteome. Additionally proteins with high levels of homology to proteins with known structure can be
readily modelled to allow examination of putative
epitope structures or protein fold.
Fungi are an ideal group of organisms in which to investigate allergen orthologue distribution as they are a diverse
kingdom comprising over an estimated million species,
are common both in the environment and as epiphytes,

Filamentous fungi contain an average of 10,000 genes
whereas the less complex yeast-like fungi may contain
only 6,000. A recent survey of fungal allergens (Bowyer
unpublished observations) shows that the best studied
fungi may have up to 20 known well characterised allergens (in the case of Aspergillus fumigatus, Cladosporium herbarum and Alternaria alternata), between 27 and 60 other
less well characterised IgE binding proteins as determined
by IgE binding to phage displayed allergen libraries [1012] and another 20 proteins predicted to be allergen
orthologues by virtue of close homology to allergens
known in other species (this publication). Thus an estimated 0.5 – 1% of proteins in a given fungal proteome
may be allergens. The known fungal allergens appear to
occur as functional groups such as serine proteases, heat
shock proteins or thioredoxins or orthologues of proteins
such as Mn superoxide dismutase or enolase. The best
studied fungi appear to possess allergen proteins from
most of these classes whereas the less well studied fungi
are only known to possess allergens from a small number
of these groups. This suggests that more allergens are discovered as an organism is studied more which implies
that fungi may all possess a core set of allergen classes. A
further group of allergens containing the major allergens
Asp f 1, Alt a 1 and Cla h 1 have only been found in fungi
from particular genera. Many diverse members of the
kingdom have publicly available genome sequences and
recently the first genome sequence of an allergenic organism, the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, was determined [13].
A. fumigatus, C. herbarum (Ch) and A. alternata (Aa) have
been shown to be capable of being causative agents of
allergy in murine models [14-16]. Fungi such as Histoplasma, Cryptococcus and Coccidioides are well described
primary pulmonary pathogens that have a long term intimate relationship with their host but have never been
observed to produce any allergic reaction during the
course of human infection [17] although we note that C.
neoformans has profound immunomodulatory effects in
immune competent rodents [18]. Other genera are common skin or gut inhabitants such as Candida or Trichophyton and have been shown to produce allergens and may
also be the causative agents of allergic reactions [19]. A
final group of fungi including A. fumigatus (Af) and Candida spp. are opportunistic pathogens capable of causing

invasive disease in immunocompromised hosts [14].
However the vast majority of fungi have never been
described to contain allergens or be pathogenic.
Many potent allergenic proteins have been described in
Af, and this organism is the first allergen-containing species to be sequenced [13,20] so we used this organism as
the basis for comparative genome analysis. Reviews of
allergen sensitization conducted in geographically diverse
areas suggest the most common causes of fungal sensitization in populations are Aspergillus, Alternaria and Cladosporium spp. These genera together with Penicillium are
frequently among the most common fungi encountered
in surveys of airborne fungi in indoor and outdoor environments worldwide [21-26]. However many other fungal species are also commonly found in these studies with
unidentified non-sporulating fungi being highly represented. A recent survey of spore levels in the UK suggests
that the combined level of Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Cladosporium spores forms approximately 15%
of the total airborne fungal matter, much of the rest of
which is accounted for by ascospores and basidiomycetes
[25]. Another recent study shows the high levels of Af,
Aureobasidium pullulans and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa in
bedding [9].
The genome sequences of A. fumigatus [13] and two other
closely related species of Aspergillus (A. oryzae (Ao) and A.
nidulans (An)) [27,28] have been recently determined
allowing analysis of allergen orthologues across this genus
and ~20 other species of fungus. The comparison between
the well known allergen producing fungus Af and Ao or
An is particularly interesting. An is an environmentally
common fungus not previously observed to produce allergens, although Asp n 2 which is orthologous to Asp f 2
may be a possible candidate. Ao has been used intensively
in fermentation of soy sauce for over 2 thousand years
with few reported cases of allergy although 'soy sauce
workers' lung' is now an accepted form of extrinsic allergic
alveolitis. The genomic analysis was also extended to
compare the genomes of the other sequenced fungi with
varying pathogenic lifestyles to demonstrate whether
allergen orthologues are truly ubiquitous in the kingdom
or whether they are restricted to the species or genera that
are known to produce allergens. Representative allergen
orthologues were structurally modelled and orthologous
epitope structures determined to discover whether they
could possibly function as cross reactive proteins or even
allergens. The results of this analysis show that many
groups of allergen orthologues are ubiquitous in fungi.

Results
Allergen orthologue distribution in the genus Aspergillus
As expected, Af allergen sequences were present in the Af
genome sequence and in the predicted Af proteome (Fig-

ure 2). All allergen database sequences showed 100%
identity to the genome sequence and predicted peptides.
All allergen homologues from Ao and An are >60% identical with f 3, f 5, f 7, f 8, f 11, f 12, f 18, f 22 and f 23 all
having >70% identity. This suggests that An and Ao could
produce many proteins cross-reactive to those of Af. Ao
has been reported to produce as many as 13 IgE reactive
proteins and an allergen Asp o lipase. [29] Only two Af
allergens, Asp f 1 and Asp f 5 did not have homologues in
both An and Ao although Asp f 5 did have a close homologue in Ao. The significance of this observation awaits
experimental elucidation however a naïve hypothesis
could be that Af is most commonly observed in allergy
due to the presence of Asp f 1. Asp f 1 has no orthologs in
the Aspergillus genomes analysed here but closely related
proteins are known to occur in A. giganteus (83% identity)
and A. clavatus (81% identity) [30]. We note the occurrence of a gene in A. terreus with 41% identity to Asp f 1
which may be a non-orthologous non-toxin RNAse. The
reported existence of at least 13 IgE reactive proteins in Ao
is consistent with our observation that Ao possesses 16
orthologues closely related to Af allergens.
Allergen orthologues are present across the fungal
kingdom
In order to determine whether allergen orthologues with
high levels of homology occur throughout the fungal
kingdom the allergen database was used to search the
genomes of 12 further ascomycetes: Neurospora crassa,
Fusarium graminearum, Magnaporthe grisea; A. terreus, C.
albicans, C. tropicalis, Chaetomium globosum, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Stagonospora nodorum, H.
capsulatum, and C. immitis; 4 basidiomycetes: Ustilago maydis, C. neoformans serotype A, C. neoformans serotype B and
Coprinus cinereus and the zygomycete, Rhizopus oryzae. The
results are represented by the heat map in Figure 2. Evolutionary relationships of the fungi used including nonsequenced major allergens are shown in Figure 3. This
shows that fungi share a highly conserved set of allergen
orthologues. The conserved group of allergens include
enolase, heat shock proteins, cyclophilins, proteases,
redoxins, and disulphide isomerases. In general homologies correlate with evolutionary relatedness. The other
ascomycetes, including the opportunistic pathogens, A.
terreus, A. fumigatus and Candida appear to retain a full
complement of allergen-like proteins, apart from a few
key allergens including Alt a 1, Alt a 2, and Asp f 1 which
appear to be highly specific to particular allergenic species, genera or families.
Computer modelling of allergen structures
Clearly the presence of genes with homology to known
allergens does not by itself prove that the proteins produced are cross-reactive or even allergenic. A minimum
requirement for consideration as possible allergens or

cross reactive proteins is that the orthologues share at least
some structural features with known allergen proteins.
Surveys of allergen cross-reactivity suggest that cross-reaction commonly occurs in proteins having >50% identity
levels [31-35]. Additionally this level of identity is known
to give rise to proteins with near identical 3-dimensional
structures [36,37]. Thus it is useful to determine whether
the orthologues share structural features with known
allergens. Another consideration is that candidates for
allergenicity should retain both epitope sequence and
structure. We note that presence of such epitope orthologues is no guarantee that IgE will bind at these sites in a
cross reactive manner as most of the epitopes determined
in fungi are linear whereas B-cell epitopes are usually considered to be structurally distributed. However consideration should be given to the presence of such epitope
orthologue regions until such time as accurate distributed
epitope regions are delineated on fungal allergens by IgE
co – crystallisation studies. In order to demonstrate that
the homologous proteins may contain epitope orthologues in 3-dimensional configurations that share the
structural organisation of known allergen epitopes, we
constructed in silico models for Af allergen molecules
based on highly homologous proteins (>60% identity)
with known structures (PDB files for enolases: 4ENL_, serine proteases: 1IC6A, ribotoxin:1AQZ, MnSOD: 1KKC).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/251

We then modelled structures for orthologues from
sequenced species not known to produce allergens and for
other known allergen proteins from species that do not
have known genome sequence such as Ch, Aa and Penicillium spp. Using these structures, we delineated the epitope
orthologues regions for protein classes that have both
known epitopes and a structural model in order to investigate whether the potential epitope orthologues from
non-allergen species retained both amino-acid sequence
identity and 3D structural congruence with those in allergenic species. Only two experimentally determined structures of Af allergens – Asp f 6 and Asp f 8 – are published
[38,39]. Af structural models were constructed based on
the closest experimentally determined structure. To show
that overall protein structure was conserved between
known allergens and non-allergens from different species
we initially compared backbone structures of Af allergens
and An allergen orthologues. An is abundant in nature
[20-26] but no allergens have been described in this
organism. Protein models were constructed based on primary structural models except in the case of homologues
of Asp f 6 and f 8 which were modelled on the published
Asp f 6 and f 8 structures. Figure 4 shows a comparison of
predicted structures between An orthologues and Af allergens. A number of Af and An structures could be modelled
with high confidence including Asp f 1, Asp f 3, Asp f 6,
Asp f 10, Asp f 11 and Asp f 12 and their homologues. Af
and An structures are shown superimposed in Figure 4.
The predicted backbone structure of An allergen orthologues cannot be distinguished from Af allergens for all
models.
Here we have chosen well characterised epitopes from
known allergens to illustrate how epitope structure might
be conserved across the families of fungal allergen orthologues. In our examples we have chosen proteins that can
be modelled from highly homologous templates and
which have mapped epitopes (enolases, subtilisin type
proteases and ribotoxin), these are shown in figures 5, 6
and 7 and described in the following 8 paragraphs.
Enolase epitopes have been determined in Candida and
C. herbarum. [40,41]. The well characterised Cladosporium (Cla h 5) enolase epitope has been shown to be cross
reactive with Alt a 5, Cand a enolase and Asp f 22 and was
thus chosen for this analysis. Known fungal enolase allergens include Asp f 22, Pen c 22, Cand a Enolase, Rho m 1,
and Sac c Enolase. The peptide containing the epitope
consists of a region of the protein with buried structure
and three surface regions. Here we compare only surface
residues as they are likely to be important for IgE binding
although buried residues may also play a structural role in
determining the surface structure. However buried structure was also modelled and can be seen to be highly conserved in all models.

structures are near identical and indistinguishable at this scale. Conserved residues in the backbone are shown in blue, divergent amino acids are shown in green and yellow to indicate structurally divergent side chains.

Subtilisin protease epitopes have been determined in Pen
c 18 [42,43]. The subtilisin-like protease allergens and
orthologues typified by Asp f 18 display highly conserved
epitope and epitope orthologues structures (Figure 7). In
this case we chose to map the epitope sequences reported
by Yu and co-authors [42].
The ribotoxin allergen Asp f 1 appears to be highly conserved across a small clade of Aspergilli including A. fumigatus and A. clavatus but not present in other members of

the genus. We note the presence of a low homology orthologues of Asp f 1 in the A. terreus genome – an organism
previously reported to have no cross reactivity to Asp f 1
[29]. Hence we examined the predicted structure and
epitopes of Asp f 1 and its orthologues to determine
whether Asp f 1 epitope orthologues were conserved and
whether the orthologues from A. terreus would be predicted to contain credible epitope orthologues using our
approach [44,45].

Spacefill models were used to show position and relatedness of amino-acids making up the experimentally determined epitopes. When epitope and epitope orthologue
regions were examined we noted that epitopes from allergens with known cross reactivity often contained differences and we reason that these residues in the epitope are
not essential for IgE binding or that certain types of substitution may not affect epitope activity. One possible
problem with this assumption is that cross reactivity is
always determined using polyclonal IgE sera as monoclonal IgE is not generally available for such studies. This
raises the possibility that the differences noted between
cross reactive epitopes may reflect binding by different
IgEs. This problem could be resolved by obtaining monoclonal IgE against the epitopes using phage display libraries constructed from individuals. Comparison of epitopes
and epitope orthologues also revealed residues in the
epitope orthologues that were clearly different to conserved epitope sequences.
Amino acids that are completely conserved in epitopes are
marked in red. Epitope amino-acids known to vary
among experimentally determined cross reactive epitopes
and therefore probably not involved directly in IgE binding are shown in green. Amino acids that are different to
the conserved epitope structure are shown in yellow. It
appears that some epitopes or epitope orthologues are
highly conserved or identical in both linear amino acid
sequence and conformational structure across the fungal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/251

kingdom. For example enolase epitope region 1 (Figure
5A) is 100% identical in all fungal species tested and
appears to retain the same conformation. Enolase epitope
region 2 (Figure 5B,C,D) contains regions that are invariant and regions that vary amongst cross reactive allergens
(marked green) as well as residues that are different to the
conserved epitope sequence (yellow) although these
divergent residues are not fully exposed on the surface of
the protein. Epitope region 3 (Figure 5B,C,D) is invariant
amongst the ascomycete fungi but varies structurally in
yeasts, Zygomycetes and Basidiomycetes by containing a
divergent loop structure (Figure 5E–I). The pileup showing amino acids conserved and diverging in the epitope
orthologues on which the spacefill colours are based is
shown in figure 5J.
Epitopes 1 and 2 (Figure 6A and 6C) are highly conserved
in all fungi whereas epitope regions 4 and 5 (Figure 6B
and 6D) are conserved in ascomycetes but show some
divergence in yeasts (Figure 6C and 6D) and basidiomycetes [not shown]. Additionally the spacefill model is unable to show structural divergence in epitope 3 (circled in
Figure 6A) which is shown circled in the ribbon structures
in Figure 6E–H. This region is highly variable in all fungi
(Figure 6I) and shows considerable variance amongst
allergens with known cross-reactivity. Other non-epitope
surface loop regions in the structures (Figure 6E) are also
different when compared between yeasts (yellow backbone in Figure 6E), ascomycetes (blue backbone) and
basidiomycetes (red backbone). Thus for the Asp f 18 class
of serine proteases the protein is highly conserved for filamentous ascomycetes and could be cross-reactive for all
higher fungi.
The only species in our analysis with a potential Asp f 1
orthologue was A. terreus which has been specifically
shown not to serologically cross – react with Asp f 1 [29].
The predicted amino acid identity with Af is 41%. When
we compared the Asp f 1 structure and epitopes with the
homologue detected in A. terreus we found that the predicted structure was similar but that the epitope orthologues sequence was not conserved (Figure 7A–E). In this
case, the homology between model and experimentally
determined structure was low (41%) and we have limited
confidence in the structure shown despite it being the best
possible alignment to Asp f 1 for epitope orthologue conservation. The considerable differences in surface composition between the A. terreus and Af proteins are evident
and suggest a likely explanation for lack of immunoreactivity of A. terreus extracts to Asp f 1 antibody.
In general, variable regions in the allergen orthologues are
also variable in cross – reactive allergens while conserved
regions are conserved in all proteins. Clearly not all
homologies detected in this study will result in conserved

epitopes or structures and we are unable to predict those
that will be important from the two examples presented in
figures 5 and 6 however we would suggest that the majority of proteins with >50% identity have the potential to be
cross-reactive or allergenic representing a vast number of
proteins in the fungal kingdom.

Discussion
Comparative genomics was used to compare allergens
between different closely related species and to study the
presence of potential cross-reacting proteins or allergen
orthologues in fungi generally. We found that not just the
genus Aspergillus, but all fungi possess a core set of allergen
orthologues. Where we were able to determine both
orthologue structure and epitope orthologue structure we
found congruence at both the gross structural and the
epitope orthologue structure levels throughout fungi
although for some epitopes the epitope orthologue identity only occurred across the ascomycete or basidiomycete
groups. In these cases however we note that previously
published experimental evidence shows that proteins previously described as allergens and containing these divergent allergen structures are serologically cross reactive
with each other [20,39-43]. We also note several reports of
cross reactivity to extracts from various different fungal
species that may broadly support the suggestion that
many species of fungi contain cross reacting classes of protein [46-50]. Finally there are several reports of cross reactivity between structurally characterized proteins from
different fungal species or between fungal allergens and
human proteins [51-59]. Thus there is considerable evidence indirectly supporting the hypothesis that all fungi
may contain allergen orthologues that may cross react.
Clearly the nature of published literature means that
reports of lack of cross reactivity between species extracts
or proteins are rare and we therefore urge caution in interpretation of these results.
Although cross reactivity between fungal proteins with
homology levels between 40 and 70% is well reported
there are other examples in the literature such as the birch
tree allergen Bet v 1 and its hypoallergenic isoform Bet v1
l which show that single amino acid changes or differences at surface residues distant from the epitope may significantly reduce reactivity [60-62]. Epitope – IgE
interaction can also be affected by underlying protein
structure thus it is certainly possible that the epitope
orthologues shown here may not be functional. It has
been shown that 6 of 9 Bet v 1 isoforms with >98% identity were moderate – high IgE binding when tested against
the same serum pool with the remaining three showing
little or no IgE binding [62]. Thus relatively small changes
in protein sequence may affect cross reaction. This data is
subject to some interpretation as recent findings show
that birch may express a number of paralogues of Bet v 1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/251

and it is unclear which of the isoforms tested were orthologous isoforms or simply different paralogues [63]. It is
probable that in this case the paralogues for this defense
protein have subtly different function and structure which
may affect their reactivity with IgE [66,67]. It is also possible that single amino acid changes can affect overall structure of a protein which would drastically affect IgE
binding [68,69].
In contrast to such experiments showing that relatively
minor sequence changes may affect IgE binding other
experiments have shown that four of 6 Bet v 1 orthologous allergens and proteins with >60% identity in related
species are cross reactive. Cross reactivity has been shown
between Bet v 1 and the celeriac allergen Api g 1. Studies
show that Api g 1 specific T cells generated with Apig1
cross-react with Bet v 1 and that cellular responses to
Betv1 may be stronger than to Apig1. Betv1109–126 was
identified as the most important Tcell epitope for crossreactivity with Apig1 [64,65]. This epitope shares only
72% amino acid sequence similarity with the major Tcellactivating region of Apig1109–126.
Thus it appears that some important single residue polymorphisms as well as large distributed differences in
homology may have variable effects on IgE binding. The
overwhelming majority of allergens and proteins that
show cross reactivity are closely related at the amino acid
level and thus we propose that our level of >50% identity
to a known allergen at the amino-acid level is usually necessary for a protein to qualify for consideration as an allergen. Retention of the same fold structure and epitope
orthologue conformation as the allergen is also required.
It is important to note the probable existence of protein
surface epitopes that have not yet been described so that
presence or absence of epitope orthology based on known
epitopes may not be a sufficient qualification. Having
graduated from these criteria the protein may still not
function either as an allergen or an IgE cross reactive protein because the differences in protein sequence may confer subtle changes in protein structure that render the
protein either unable to initiate allergenicity or to bind
IgE effectively. Surveys of cross reactive proteins and allergens related at the sequence level show that such proteins
with >50% identity usually cross react. In fungi we note
that all proteins with >50% identity to known allergens
that have been studied are found to be either cross-reactive or allergenic. We would thus argue that the highly
similar epitope orthologues presented here that are
embedded in proteins that often have >70% identity to
known allergens may often represent IgE binding
sequences. Clearly other structural features such as posttranslational modifications may be relevant in determining whether a protein can be allergenic.

This cross species comparison predicts the presence of a
number of allergen orthologues in Af. During the preparation of this manuscript, four new IUIS approved Af allergens were described (Asp f 27 – cyclophilin, Asp f 28–29
– thioredoxins, and Asp f GST) [70] that were found in our
analysis as allergen orthologues on the basis of their
homology to other fungal allergens. This finding supports
the idea that the allergen orthologues found in this study
may in fact have the potential to be allergens. The organisms in this analysis represent an allergenically random
sample of fungi, as their selection for genome sequencing
was for other reasons;- pathogenicity to plant or animal,
status as a model genetic organism or as representatives of
a particular morphology or growth habit [see Figure 3].
Therefore, we would suggest that they can be taken, with
certain exceptions, to be representive of the majority of
the fungal kingdom. Some epitope orthologue structures
and sequences are completely conserved in all fungi.
Therefore this analysis may indicate the presence of allergen orthologues in over a million species of fungi, many
of which are in everyday contact with the skin, gut and respiratory mucosa.
The observation that most reported fungal allergens come
from only three species may have several explanations.
The most obvious is that these are the best studied and
most commonly encountered fungi. Other possibilities
are that these fungi have special characteristics that make
them suitable for presentation of allergen proteins such as
production of 3rd party mycotoxins, ability to colonize the
lungs or gut or high level expression of the allergen genes.
Af is well recognized a long-term saprophyte and colonizer of the respiratory tract (ABPA, aspergilloma and
maxillary fungal sinusitis), A. alternata can be an opportunistic and superficial nail pathogen and Cladosporium
and Penicillium spp. can occasionally be pathogens
[72,73]. Thus the capability to survive in or on the host for
enough time to synthesize sufficient allergenic protein at
the right time and in the right place may be a necessary for
the expressed allergen proteins to produce allergenicity. In
contrast, primary pathogenic fungi such as C. immitis, H.
capsulatum and C. neoformans that attack and dwell in the
lung for long periods have never been observed to cause
allergic reactions in man. Like other fungi, they possess a
large complement of allergen orthologues proteins with
structurally conserved epitopes. It is possible that these
primary pathogenic fungi do not present the allergen
orthologues proteins at the right time in vivo or insufficient quantity to trigger allergy or that such highly
adapted organisms are capable of interfering with the IgE
response which in its proper state is a potent weapon
against pathogen attack.

Many major allergenic species possess allergens that are
unique to that species or its close relatives. Examples of
this are Asp f 1, Alt a 1 and Cla h 1. These proteins may
play an important role in making a species allergenic. For
example Asp f 1 is a ribotoxin that may prime the atopic
host for allergic reaction by damaging epithelial tissue.
However our analysis is limited to homologues of known
allergens and it is possible that all fungi contain such species limited toxins or allergens. Recent analysis of fungal
proteomes indicates that there are many proteins that are
unique to each genus so far studied.
It is possible that the particular allergens themselves are
intrinsically more allergenic in these species compared
with other fungi. Given the basic similarity of the proteins
at the structural level, many published instances of crossreactivity, pragmatically determined level of identity giving cross-reactivity and the conservation of epitope structures across the fungal kingdom it seems probable that at
least some of the allergen orthologues will be serologically cross-reactive or allergenic if presented to the
immune system appropriately. It is known that the protein 3D structure underlying or surrounding an epitope is
important in IgE binding but these regions are also highly
conserved. Cloning of genes encoding allergens has
revealed that most, if not all, allergens cloned from different isolates of a single species are heterogenous with variation in up to 25% of the amino acids in an allergen
orthologues with known allergen activity [71]. The particular feature of these classes of proteins that makes them
allergens rather than the other 99% of cellular proteins
may well arise from complex distributed protein features.
The presence of multiple close allergen homologues
across the fungal kingdom carrying epitope orthologues
that are structurally indistinguishable from IgE binding
epitopes may raise a considerable problem in diagnosis
and classification of fungal allergy. Even allowing for the
fact that many of these allergen orthologues may be neither allergenic nor cross-reactive the sheer size of the fungal kingdom means that the remaining number of fungi
that would contain allergens or cross reactive proteins is
likely to be huge. In such a case the common practice of
screening for allergens using reactivity to serum IgE may
be fraught with difficulties and determining the primary
agent that is causing an allergy may more difficult than is
currently realised. We note however that the various
important allergen containing species all possess subsets
of major allergens such as Asp f 1, Alt a 1 and Cla h 1 that
are specific to species or at least genus. These allergens
would provide a species or genus specific diagnostic and
are already used in some cases. The efficacy of using culture filtrate from fungi in skin prick testing or IgE binding
assays would then depend on the proportion of species or
genus specific allergens present in the crude mixture –

high proportions of species specific allergens giving the
most precise result. It might be useful to perform skin
prick tests with mixtures of species specific allergens from
the same fungus in order to achieve a more precise result.

Stagonospora nodorum, Rhizopus oryzae, Cryptococcus neoformans serotype A and B, Coccidioides immitis and Coprinus

Conclusion

Construction of structural models
Structural models were made using automated and manual modelling routines in an iterative manner using DeepView v3.7(SP5) [83,84] for alignment and realignment of
sequences and energy minimization of models and Swiss
Model [84] software and servers for threading of models.
Gap regions were adjusted manually in DeepView. Ramachandran plots were used to check sequences during and
after modelling.

In conclusion this analysis suggests that fungal allergen
orthologues are abundant in nature and that many of
them occur in the majority of fungal species. It seems
likely that many of these allergen orthologues are potential allergens or at least capable of cross reactivity at some
level of the immune response. This finding suggests that
the frequency of exposure, persistence, context of presentation or provenance of the allergen protein are important
in determining how frequently a particular species is
encountered as a cause of allergy.

Methods
Databases and analysis
A database of 82 non-redundant fungal allergen
sequences was compiled from 102 fungal allergen protein
sequences from databases at Allergome [70], SDAP, Allermatch [75] and SwissProt [76]. The non redundant list
contained the following allergen sequences: Alt a 1, Alt a
3, Alt a 4, Alt a 5, Alt a 6, Alt a 7, Alt a 8, Alt a 10, Alt a 12,
Cla h 2, Cla h 5, Cla h 6, Cla h 7, Cla h 8, Cla h 9, Cla h

formatted genome peptide database files using NCBI formatdb and NCBI standalone BLAST2.0 [77]. BLASTP,
TBLASTN and BLASTX [78] were used to search nucleotide
and protein sequence databases. For cases were no match
was found te results were checked manually to ensure tat
sequencing errors were not responsible. BLAST data was
parsed using BLASTEXTRACTER (MolGen Software,
Department of Genetics, Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute GBB), the Netherlands]
and transferred to MS Excel for further analysis. Heatmap
and cluster analysis was performed using CLUSTER and
TREEVIEW programmes [79]. Genome sequence for comparison was obtained from TIGR [13,27,28] (A. fumigatus,
A. nidulans and A. oryzae) with annotations provided by
CADRE [80], The Broad Institute (A. terreus, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Chaemotium globosum, Fusarium graminearum, Histoplasma capsulatum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,

Epitope sequences were obtained from previously published literature and manually mapped onto spacefill
models of allergens using CLUSTALX v1.83 [85] to align
sequences, Genedoc v2.6.002 [86] to visualise the resulting pileups and Rasmol v2.7.2.1.1 [87] to colour structures.
