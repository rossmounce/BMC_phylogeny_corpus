Abstract
Background: TMEM18 is a hypothalamic gene that has recently been linked to obesity and BMI in genome wide
association studies. However, the functional properties of TMEM18 are obscure.
Methods: The evolutionary history of TMEM18 was inferred using phylogenetic and bioinformatic methods. The
gene’s expression profile was investigated with real-time PCR in a panel of rat and mouse tissues and with
immunohistochemistry in the mouse brain. Also, gene expression changes were analyzed in three feeding-related
mouse models: food deprivation, reward and diet-induced increase in body weight. Finally, we genotyped 502
severely obese and 527 healthy Swedish children for two SNPs near TMEM18 (rs6548238 and rs756131).
Results: TMEM18 was found to be remarkably conserved and present in species that diverged from the human
lineage over 1500 million years ago. The TMEM18 gene was widely expressed and detected in the majority of cells
in all major brain regions, but was more abundant in neurons than other cell types. We found no significant
changes in the hypothalamic and brainstem expression in the feeding-related mouse models. There was a strong
association for two SNPs (rs6548238 and rs756131) of the TMEM18 locus with an increased risk for obesity
(p = 0.001 and p = 0.002).
Conclusion: We conclude that TMEM18 is involved in both adult and childhood obesity. It is one of the most
conserved human obesity genes and it is found in the majority of all brain sites, including the hypothalamus and
the brain stem, but it is not regulated in these regions in classical energy homeostatic models.

Background
Obesity is an increasing global health problem accompanied by several significant health impairments, such as
type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Although
excessive energy intake together with low levels of physical activity contribute to the ongoing obesity epidemic,
genetic research has shown that heritage might account
for as much as 70% of the population variation in BMI
[1]. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have
linked several genomic loci with a high BMI, and several

new candidate genes have been identified [2]. Most
recently, the FTO gene has been given special attention
because of its strong association with obesity in multiple
cohorts differing in age [3]. Basic research showed that
FTO-deficient mice have less adipose tissue and a lower
body mass compared with wild type mice, which supports the biological role proposed for the gene by the
GWA analyses [4].
Aside from FTO, GWA studies associated with obesity
yet another gene, named TMEM18. TMEM18 was first
proposed as an important obesity-related locus by the
GIANT consortium [5]. That study strongly associated
the nearby SNP, rs6548238, to increased BMI and body
weight. Subsequently, these results were replicated in

the Icelandic GWA study for three other SNPs located
in the close proximity of TMEM18 (rs2867125,
rs4854344 and rs7561317), which all showed a strong
association to both BMI and body weight [6]. The FTO
locus’ association to BMI was confirmed therein.
Furthermore, the TMEM18 locus’ association to BMI
has been replicated in two additional studies [7,8] and it
has also been associated to the age of menarche [9]. It
should be noted that while the risk contribution of the
TMEM18 locus to obesity in adults has been examined
(6), no attempt to determine such association has been
made in obese children. However, one previous study
has associated the locus with BMI in children [8].
The TMEM18 gene codes for a poorly characterized
transmembrane protein. One study indicated that this
protein is located in the nuclear envelope in neural stem
cells [10]. TMEM18 may be involved in cell migration
as overexpression of the protein increases the migration
of neural stem cells towards glioma in the rat brain. A
preliminary expression profiling of TMEM18, that
accompanied the first GWA study, suggested that it is
ubiquitously expressed, but with certain differences
between tissues [5]. In line with the proposed role in
the regulation of body weight, TMEM18 was shown to
be expressed in the brain, including the hypothalamus,
the region responsible for the control of energy homeostasis. Only few other brain areas were investigated in
that project.
The current project provides the first detailed characterization of the human TMEM18 protein’s sequence
features, evolutionary history, gene expression profile in
the rat and mouse, distribution in the mouse brain, and
gene expression regulation in several murine feeding/
body weight models. We also investigated the risk of
obesity for variants upstream of the TMEM18 locus in
the cohort of severely obese children and healthy controls, and performed the first examination of the locus
association to several obesity-related traits.

Methods
Evolutionary and sequence analysis
Retrieval of protein sequences

The proteomes of eleven different organisms representing different lineages of eukaryotes, with the focus on
the metazoans and vertebrates, were gathered from different sources as follows. All protein sequences for
Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus
tropicalis, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster were downloaded from Ensembl 53 [11]; Branciostoma floridae [12],Trichoplax adhaerens [13] and
Thalassiosira pseudonana [14] were downloaded from
the Joint Genome Institute’s website, Saccharomyces cerevisae was downloaded from the Saccharomyces genome
database [15], Arabidopsis thaliana from The

Page 2 of 13

Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) [16] and all
bacterial proteomes were downloaded from NCBI’s ftpsite [17].
Mining for TMEM18

The human TMEM18 sequence was collected from UniProt [18] and used to query the OMA database [19]
(release September 2008). The OMA is a database
which automatically groups protein sequences predicted
to be orthologous. To allow identification of members
of the TMEM18 family that are not orthologous to the
human gene, we used the following procedure.
Sequences that belong to the orthologous group of
human TMEM18 were downloaded from the database
and aligned using mafft-einsi [20] with default parameters. The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was
viewed and edited in Jalview [21]. A hidden-markov
model (HMM) was created and calibrated from the
MSA using the HMMER [22] package with default parameters. The HMM was applied on the listed proteomes
using the hmmpfam program of the HMMER package
with the default parameters. The results were evaluated
for false-positives and hits with an E-value below 10-6
were considered as significant. The protein and nucleotide sequences for the hits were collected and redundancy was manually removed so that only one protein/
transcript was kept for each gene.
Multiple sequence alignments and Phylogenetic analysis

The protein sequences identified in the mining procedure were aligned using mafft-einsi with default parameters. The resulting MSA was viewed, analyzed and
edited in Jalview. The protein sequences of the MSA
were reversely translated to the corresponding mRNA
transcripts by using RevTrans [23] with the default parameters and the retrieved nucleotide MSA was used for
the phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic inference
was performed with the maximum likelihood method
using RAxML (v. 7.0.4) [24] according to the “Hard &
Slow Way” described in the program’s manual, the EasyRAx script found at the program’s website was utilized
to execute the analysis. In brief, the best known maximum likelihood tree was found in 100 maximum parsimony trees, 1000 non-parametric bootstraps were
carried out and frequencies were written on the best
known maximum likelihood tree. The final tree was
drawn using Mesquite (v 2.6) and edited in Inkscape (v.
0.46), using the T. pseudonana sequence as the outgroup. Pairwise sequence alignments were made using
EMBOSS’ [25] implementation of the NeedlemanWunsch [26] algorithm with the default parameters.
Sequence analysis of the human TMEM18 protein

Poly Phobius [27] (v. 1.04) was used to predict transmembrane topology for the human TMEM18 sequence.
The protein MSA made for the evolutionary analysis
was used as input to increase accuracy of the prediction.

Glycosylation sites of type O-b-GlcNAc, which occurs in
the nucleus, was predicted using the YinOYang [28] (v.
1.2) server with the default parameters. Phosphorylation
sites were predicted with the NetPhos [29] (v. 2.0) server
using the default parameters. The prediction of nuclear
localization signals (NLS) was performed with PredictNLS and the NLSdb database [30]. Finally, the UniProt and Ensembl websites were consulted for
additional annotation.
TMEM18 tissue expression profiling with quantitative
real-time PCR

The TMEM18 mRNA expression was detected in tissue
panels from both the mouse and the rat. Animal handling and tissue panel preparation was performed as previously described in Haitina et al. together with details
of the real-time PCR analysis [31]. The primers used
can be found in Additional file 1. All animal experiments has been approved by “Uppsala’s Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments” (reference number: C285/5
and C84/8) and follows international guidelines.
TMEM18-like immunoreactivity in the murine brain

C57Bl6/J adult male mice were housed in the controlled
environment (21°C, 12:12 LD cycle), with ad libitum
access to chow and water. An intraperitonial injection of
mixture of Dormitor (70 μg/g b. wt., Orion, Finland)
and Ketalar (7 μg/g b. wt., Pfizer, Sweden) was used to
anesthetize the mice. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde were used to perform
transcardial perfusion through the left ventricle. The
fixed brain was excised and incubated overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde; subsequently the tissue was dehydrated and infiltrated with paraffin (Tissue Tek vacuum
infiltration processor; Miles Scientific, Elkhart, IN). Sectioning (7 μm) of the paraffin-embedded brain was carried out on the Microm microtome onto superfrost
slides (Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany).
Immunoflourescence

Sections were deparaffinized in X-tra solve (Medite Histotechnic, Burgdorf, Germany) and rehydrated with a
series of washes in descending concentrations of ethanol
followed by autoclaved MilliQ water. Antigen retrieval
was performed by boiling the sections in 0.01 M citric
acid (pH 6.0) for 10 minutes. Slides were cooled and
rinsed with 1× PBS pH 7.4. They were transferred to
the humidity (PBS) chamber. Primary antibodies: rabbit
anti-TMEM18, (ProSci, Poway, CA) and mouse antiNeuN (Neuronal Nuclei, Millipore, Temecula CA, USA)
diluted 1:400 in PBS+0.3% Triton X100 (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) were added onto the slides and incubation was
carried out overnight at 4°C. The slides were then
washed with PBS and incubated in the secondary antibodies: donkey-anti-rabbit 594 (1:200; Alexa Fluor,

Page 3 of 13

Invitrogen, USA) and goat-anti-mouse 488 (1:400; Alexa
Fluor, Invitrogen, USA), respectively in PBS+0.3% Triton
X100 in the dark chamber for 4 hours. The slides were
washed with PBS and stained with DAPI. They were
coverslipped using DTG (2.5% DABCO (Sigma), 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 90% glycerol). Sections were analyzed
under the Zeiss XBO75 microscope.
Analysis of results

Pictures of the cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus and hippocampus were taken with the Zeiss AxioCam HRm under 20× magnification. Photomicrographs
show a random portion of each region of interest. The
images were analyzed and cells counted through appropriate filters using ImageJ 1.41o software (National Institute of Health, USA). A total of 5 pictures from the
cortex, 4 from the amygdala, and 3 each from the
hypothalamus, thalamus and hippocampus were analyzed. The total number of all cells, NeuN cells and
TMEM18-positive cells as well as the number of
TMEM18 expressing neurons and non-neurons were
counted separately. Percentages of neurons expressing
TMEM18, non-neurons expressing TMEM18, and all
cells combined expressing TMEM18 were calculated.
Feeding experiments

Male C57BL/6J mice (Scanbur, Sweden), housed individually or in groups of two (Exp. 1, 2 and 3) in macrolon
cages, under LD 12:12 (lights on at 0700), weighed ca.
28 g at the beginning of the experiment. Tap water and
chow (Lactamin, Sweden) were available ad libitum
unless specified otherwise. Procedures described herein
were approved by the Uppsala Animal Welfare Committee and followed the EU and Swedish guidelines.
Experiment 1. Hypothalamic and brainstem TMEM18 mRNA
levels following 16-h and 24-h of food deprivation

Chow was removed before the onset of the dark phase
and mice (n = 8) were decapitated between 1000 and
1100 on the next day. Control mice (n = 8) had ad libitum access to food.
Experiment 2. Hypothalamic and brainstem TMEM18 mRNA
levels following 48-h consumption of palatable sucrose or
Intralipid

Mice gained access to a bottle containing 10% sucrose or
4.1% Intralipid (Fresenius, Sweden) for 48 h; control animals had access to chow only (n = 8/group). Intralipid, a
palatable lipid emulsion, has been used in experiments
utilizing liquid diets [32,33]. Sucrose and Intralipid were
isocaloric (0.4 kcal/g, 1 kcal = 4.2 kJ); energy density of
chow was 3.6 kcal/g. The solutions were similar in palatability: each mouse ingested on average 8.1 kcal of Intralipid and 7.4 kcal of sucrose per day. Total energy intake
per animal was 10.3 kcal in the chow group, 14.1 kcal in
the sucrose group and 12.9 kcal in the Intralipid group.
Mice were decapitated after 48 h (1100 - 1200).

Experiment 3. Hypothalamic and brainstem TMEM18 mRNA
levels upon increased body weight

Mice received 10% sucrose in addition to chow for 3
weeks; controls had chow only (n = 8/group). The initial
body weights did not differ significantly between the
two groups (controls: 27.6 ± 0.3 g; sucrose: 27.8 ± 0.5
g). At endpoint, sucrose-fed mice weighed 32.1 ± 0.4 g,
whereas the control animals weighed 29.5 ± 0.6 g (P <
0.05; t-test). Energy intake was similar to that described
for the corresponding groups in Experiment 1. Mice
were decapitated between 1100 and 1200.
Analysis of genetic association to obesity and related
traits
Phenotype characterization

Birth weights and lengths were obtained from growth
charts. Actual body weights and lengths were measured
to the nearest 0.1 kg and 1 cm, respectively. BMI standard deviation score (BMI SDS) was calculated from
weight, height, standardized for age and gender [34]. For
the obese subjects, levels of plasma glucose, serum insulin, serum triglycerides and cholesterol were analysed
from blood samples drawn after 16-h overnight fasting
as previously described [35].
Subjects

We genotyped 1027 children and adolescents comprising two study groups as described earlier [35]. Briefly, a
case group of 502 obese children (262 girls and 240
boys) was enrolled at the National Childhood Obesity
Centre at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge,
Sweden. The obese subjects were between 6 and 20
years old and mean age was 12.6 ± 3.3 years. BMI SDS
ranged from 2.7 to 11.1 and mean BMI SDS was 6.2 ±
1.4 2) The control group with 525 healthy Swedish adolescents (268 girls and 257 boys) was recruited from 17
upper secondary schools in the Stockholm area. The
subjects in the control group were between 15 and 20
years old and mean age was 17.1 ± 0.8 years. BMI SDS
ranged from -1.9 to 2.4 and mean BMI SDS was 0.2 ±
0.8. Subjects with overweight/obesity or chronic diseases
were excluded from the control group and seven children with type-2 diabetes were excluded from the obese
group. The study was approved by the Regional Committee of Ethics, Stockholm, (reference number KI702/
03) and follows the Helsinki declaration and international guidelines. All participants or their legal guardians
gave their written informed consent of inclusion in the
study and publication of the results.
Statistical analysis

In order to test for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, the Pearson’s c 2 -test (1 d.f) was applied.
Genotype and allele frequencies were calculated and
logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio
(OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) assuming an

Page 4 of 13

additive model. Association with obesity was determined
by comparing subjects with normal weight and obesity.
Associations between genotypes and phenotypes were
analyzed with linear regression, assuming an additive
model. Quantitative skewed variables were log-transformed before analysis. Covariates such as birth weight,
birth length, weight, length, gender, BMI SDS and age
were tested for dependence on the response variables
and included in the model if significant. All the analysis
was performed using PLINK [36].
Genotyping

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood
using QiaGen Maxiprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Genotyping was performed with pre-designed Taqman
single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assay
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and an ABI7900
genetic analyser with SDS 2.2 software.

Results
Sequence analysis of the human TMEM18 protein

A comprehensive picture of the human TMEM18 protein can be found in Figure 1. The human TMEM18
gene is located on chromosome 2. It is 9466 bp-long,
including introns, and it has seven protein coding exons.
The gene has three transcripts of which the longest one
is translated into a 140 amino acid-long protein, that
were predicted to have three transmembrane a-helices.
The N-terminus of the protein, which probably faces
the inside of the nuclear envelope, was predicted to
have five O-b-GlcNAc glycosylation sites, and the second loop to have one phosphorylation site. The protein
has a nuclear localization signal at the C-terminal,
which according to NLSdb, is identical to, among
others, human homeobox proteins and it targets the
protein for transport to the nucleus. A coiled-coil
domain was also found in the same part of the protein.
Evolutionary investigation

We searched for homologues in a wide range of genomes in all kingdoms of life and we present herein the
specific mining of eleven genomes for genes homologous to TMEM18. We found that all genomes contained
one single positive hit for the TMEM18 family, except
for S. cerevisae and C. elegans where no homologous
genes were identified. The non-redundant proteins
sequences used that were received in the mining is
available in Additional file 2. We investigated this
further by mining the NCBI’s protein database nr using
protein PSI-BLAST with the human TMEM18 protein
sequence as query and with the default parameters. We
found no sequences from the fungi or pseudoocoelomata
(where C. elegans belongs) lineages in these searches,
suggesting that these taxonomic groups have lost the
TMEM18 gene. The multiple sequence alignment

bootstrap values were not strong for this part of the
topology, which may reflect high conservation of the
sequences. The vertebrates formed a clear cluster with
an expected topology, apart from the reversal of the X.
tropicalis and D. rerio positions, but here the bootstrap
values were low.
Expression profiling

We investigated the TMEM18’s mRNA expression pattern in a wide range of rat and mouse tissues using realtime PCR. We found that TMEM18 was widely
expressed, but varied in expression level between different tissues and was abundant in feeding and body
weight regulatory brain regions such as the hypothalamus and brainstem, although higher in other tissues
(Figure 4). As a comparison, we downloaded microarray
expression data for the D. melanogaster TMEM18 from
FlyAtlas [37], which confirmed the wide expression pattern found in the rat and mouse (Figure 4)
Immunohistochemical detection of TMEM18 in the mouse
brain
Figure 1 Schematic image of the human TMEM18 protein’s
features. TMEM18 has three transmembrane a-helices and the Nterminal and second loop probably face the inside of the nucleus,
whereas the first loop and the C-terminal are oriented towards the
cytoplasm, according to predictions by Phobius. The N-terminal
contains five predicted O-b-GlcNAc glycosylation sites (red
pentagons) and the second loop contains one phosphorylation site
(blue star). Also, one of the glycosylation sites (*) is potentially
targeted by phosphorylation. The C-terminal is annotated to contain
a Coiled-coiled domain and an NLS-motif. The protein is highly
conserved: blue boxes represents well conserved motifs, capital
letters represent amino acids that are completely conserved in all
investigated organisms and lower cases represent those conserved
in 90%. Circles represent single conserved residues. The circles and
amino acid letters are colored according to Zappo color scheme in
Jalview. All numbers represent amino acid positions, starting at the
N-terminal.

(Figure 2) showed that the TMEM18 sequence is well
conserved, eleven residues were identical in all the
investigated organisms and another 30 were identical
with 80% of the sequences. The average pair wise
sequence identity (similarity) was 37% (82%) for all species and 41% (88%) within vertebrates. Thus, the
TMEM18 family has been highly conserved during the
evolutionary history of eukaryotes.
We created a phylogenetic tree for the TMEM18 family
(Figure 3). T. pseudonana was used as the outgroup
and, as expected; the plant A. thaliana was found to be
basal of the metazoan group. Within the metazoan
group, the order of invertebrates was not as anticipated,
since T. adhaerens should be most basal, followed by D.
melanogaster and B. floridae. However, the supporting

We stained a large number of sections from the mouse
brain. No region was devoid of TMEM18 immunoreactivity and the TMEM18 protein showed a widespread
distribution throughout the mouse brain. We also performed co-labeling of TMEM18 with the cellular marker, DAPI, and a neuronal marker, NeuN (Figure 5) and
in total 7276 cells from the cortex (1904 cells), amygdala
(1505 cells), hypothalamus (1314 cells), thalamus (1033
cells) and hippocampus (1520 cells) were counted. The
results revealed that TMEM18 was present in 71% of all
cell types, 73% of NeuN-positive cells and 63% of
NeuN-negative cells (Figure 5).
Central expression of TMEM18 in mice differing in
feeding or body weight profiles

Hypothalamic and brainstem expression of TMEM18
was unchanged in all of the feeding paradigms utilized
herein, including 16- and 24-h energy deprivation, as
well as short- (48 h) and long-term (3 weeks long; leading to increased body weight) exposure to palatable
tastants that differ in macronutrient composition (see
Figure 6).
Analysis of genetic association to obesity and related
traits

None of the two SNPs analyzed caused deviation from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table 1) and the variants
were almost in complete linkage disequilibrium, r2 =
0.95. Table 1 shows obesity risk estimates (odds ratios;
OR) for the two genotyped variants located 23 kbp
upstream TMEM18, rs6548238 and rs7561317. Both
SNPs were significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001)

associated with obesity in directions consistent with
prior reports of association with BMI (OR = 1.450 and
OR = 1.507) [5-7]. Table 2 summarizes the analyzed
phenotypes in the normal weight and obese children
and adolescents for the two SNPs. No significant association was found after adjustment for multiple testing.
There was, however, a clear trend for BMI SDS among
the obese children: the homozygote carriers of the
major allele had 0.5 SD higher BMI SDS levels compared to the homozygote carriers of the minor allele (p
= 0.073 and p = 0.038). This trend was also observed
among the obese children for a shorter birth length for
carriers of the major allele for both SNPs (p = 0.048
and p = 0.032).

Discussion
The TMEM18 gene has a remarkably long evolutionary
history as it is found in most of the eukaryotic genomes
we have looked at. It has therefore been present for at
least 1500 MYA since the divergence of animals and
plants/T. pseudonana [38]. Thus, it is one of the most
ancient genes implicated in human obesity, such as FTO
[39] and MC4R [40], that we are aware of. Most of the
main genes involved in body weight regulation appeared
after the radiation of vertebrates and very few are present beyond the animal kingdom. The amino acid
sequences are highly conserved (Figures 2 and 3) with
relatively small differences between vertebrates and
other animals. Another very interesting feature (of

with a maximum-likelihood approach using the RAxML program. The tree was bootstrapped 1000 times and branch lengths correspond to loglikelihood scores (see scale). The sequence similarities and identities (percentage of alignment length) for each protein are towards the human
TMEM18 protein and were calculated from global alignments produced with the EMBOSS implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

curiosity, shared by the FTO gene), is that the gene is
found in a single copy with no close relative in the genomes where it is present, despite that some genomes
have undergone recent whole genome duplications such
as A. thaliana (38 MYA) [41]. Surprisingly, we found
two separate lineages where the TMEM18 gene is absent:
fungi (yeasts, molds and mushrooms) and pseudoocoelomata (C. elegans). Both contain well analyzed genomes
of high quality, suggesting that this gene has been lost at
least two times on separate occasions in evolution and
that the gene is thus not essential for life in all eukaryotes. The TMEM18 protein is predicted to have three
transmembrane helices, a relatively uncommon property
among human membrane proteins, as fewer than 5% of
them share this feature [42]. The membrane topology is
mainly found among proteins with poorly characterized
functions that do not have close relatives and are, therefore, sole representatives of their protein family in the
human proteome. The TMEM18 protein has a nuclear
localization signal that targets the protein for transportation to the nucleus, which also has been confirmed
experimentally [10]. Moreover, it contains a coiled-coil
domain (Figure 1) that is common among DNA or RNA
binding proteins, such a transcription factors, e.g. c-Fos

[43]. However, transcription factors are generally not
membrane-bound proteins, but at least one exception
exists in the gene named Myelin gene regulatory factor
(MRF) that is predicted to have a transmembrane helix
and plays a central regulatory role in myelination of the
CNS [44]. We found that there are only seven proteins,
unrelated to each other, in the human proteome that
contain three transmembrane helices and one coiled-coil
domain, according to our queries in UniProt. Thus, the
molecular structure of the TMEM18 protein is very
uncommon in terms of other proteins in the human genome and surely very much different compared to other
proteins involved in obesity, such as the enzyme FTO
and the G protein-coupled melanocortin receptor,

Other interesting features of the TMEM18 protein are
the evolutionary conserved potential O-b-GlcNAc glycosylation and the phosphorylation sites, which are targets
for the important posttranslational regulation of many
proteins’ functions and activities. Noteworthy, these sites
are found in parts of the proteins that are supposed to
face the inside of the nuclear envelope, i.e., the N-terminal and second loop (Figure 1) which, together with the
beginning of the first and second transmembrane helices,

species. Means are relative to the tissue with the lowest expression (set to 1) in the rat and mouse. The expression was measured with real-time
PCR for A. Rat and B. Mouse, whereas the expression of TMEM18 in C. fly was received from the FlyAtlas microarray database, the expression is

are the most evolutionary conserved parts of the
TMEM18 protein. This suggests that these parts of the
protein constitute a potential active site, binding site or
another important functional structure of the protein.
The TMEM18 gene is expressed in all the tissues we
analyzed in the rat and mouse. Moreover, microarray
data on TMEM18 from the fly (D. melanogaster), found
in the FlyAtlas database, (Figure 4) correspond well to
the mammalian expression data and confirm the widespread expression with the abundant presence in the
brain, although higher in several other tissues. Thus, the
expression pattern is in agreement with the evolutionary
conservation of the protein sequence. We performed a
comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis as well as
in situ hybridization (Additional file 3). The immunohistochemical results showed that the TMEM18 protein is

expressed throughout the mouse brain, which agrees
with the real-time PCR expression profiles (Figure 4)
and the in situ hybridization (See Additional file 3). We
performed co-localization with specific neuronal marker
and assessed the extent of the expression in five major
brain areas. We found that TMEM18 is expressed in
most cells (71%), with a somewhat higher, but significant (p = 0.011; t-test), presence in neurons (73%) than
in non-neurons (64%). The outcome is consistent for
different brain areas studied (Figure 5), while the
hypothalamus is the only region that has a relatively
lower percentage of expression in neurons. The
TMEM18 gene was presented as a hypothalamic gene
by the earlier study reporting the GWA to obesity [5].
We did not however see any evidence of significant
enrichment in the TMEM18 expression level in the

hypothalamus compared to other central regions, which
is clear for, e.g., the aforementioned FTO gene and
most neuroendocrine genes involved in body weight regulation. Thus, our results show that TMEM18 is likely
to have a function in multiple tissues rather than being
a solely hypothalamic gene. Nonetheless, the real-time
PCR and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that
the TMEM18 is expressed abundantly in the hypothalamus and brainstem, regions that play a crucial role in
the regulation of energy homeostasis: the hypothalamus,

as the area that controls primarily feeding for calories
and contains also components of the feeding reward system, and the brainstem that serves as the “relay station”
for the gut-CNS signal cascade. Changes in energy
needs of the organism, body weight as well as the
rewarding value of food affect expression of genes
known to participate in the regulation of consumption
and body weight. Therefore, we studied the potential
regulation of the TMEM18 gene expression in three different animal models that explore classical feeding

paradigms. Feeding-related gene expression profile has
previously been shown to be significantly changed in
these tissues. For example, palatability affected hypothalamic expression of melanocortin receptor-4 (MC4R)
and kappa (KOR) and mu (MOR) opioid receptors; an
increased body weight influenced proopiomelanocortin
(POMC), melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and
dynorphin (DYN) [45] while restriction of energy intake
through deprivation upregulated expression of the obesity-associated gene FTO. Somewhat surprisingly, the
TMEM18’s expression level in the hypothalamus and
brainstem remained the same in all models utilized
herein (Figure 6). In fact, it shows a more stable

expression (GeNorm expression stability value; M =
0.493) than the commonly used housekeeping genes:
Tubulin beta (M = 0.575) in the brainstem samples
from the deprivation and increased body weight models
(Experiment 1 and 3) and Cyclophilin (M = 0.505,
TMEM18 M = 0.458) in the hypothalamus samples
from the Sucrose vs Intralipid model (Experiment 2).
The average expression stability value is 0.469, which is
remarkable as it parallels housekeeping genes in these
models. Still, TMEM18 would not be considered a true
housekeeping gene as it is not found in all cells. It is
however clear that TMEM18 is differently regulated
compared to the classical neuropeptides and receptors,

whose mRNA levels are altered in these models. It is
interesting in this context that TMEM18 contains several potential phosphorylation and glycosylation sites
(Figure 1) as both these processes are common regulatory pathways for nuclear proteins. It is also possible
that this gene is so prevalent in central neurons (73% of
them express it) that feeding-related changes in
TMEM18 expression might have affected only a small
subpopulation of TMEM18 cells and they were not
detectable with the real-time PCR analysis of a large
region, such as the hypothalamus or brainstem.
Our human genetic study showed a strong significance
for the association of two SNPs (Table 1) located
upstream of TMEM18 with childhood obesity in a
Swedish cohort of obese children and a clear trend for
an increase in BMI SDS for homozygote carriers of the
major allele. Further, the estimations of the odds-ratios
suggest that there are significantly higher risks for carriers of the major allele of both SNPs to develop obesity
(Table 1). The odds-ratio for rs6548238 (OR = 1.450) is
in the same magnitude as the calculations made by
Renström and colleagues (OR = 1.100) for a cohort of
4923 Swedish adults [7]. Moreover, the odds-ratios for
the locus near TMEM18 are also as high as reported for
the FTO locus (OR = 1.593) for the same cohort [35].
This strengthens previous observations that this region
is as strongly associated with obesity as FTO. We do
not find however any significant association for the variations with any of the investigated obesity-related traits,
many relevant for the detection of a diabetic phenotype,
while there is a trend for a decrease in birth weight and
length for homozygote carriers of the major alleles
(Table 2). In conclusion, the results show that a region
near TMEM18 is significantly contributing to obesity in
severely obese children, a group that arguably has the
highest genetic component and greatest need for healthcare among different population subgroups of obese
individuals.

Data are means and SD divided into genotype groups. P indicates p-values
adjusted for
significant covariates.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we show that common variations nearby
the TMEM18 gene are associated not only to adult
obesity but also obesity in severely obese children in a
similar magnitude as FTO, the first gene associated
with the common form of obesity. TMEM18 has a
remarkably long evolutionary history that spans at least
1500 MY, longer than most other genes implicated in
body weight regulation that we are aware of. The gene
is widely distributed in the brain, found in the majority
of all cells in the brain with slight, yet significant,
enrichment in neurons compared to non-neurons.

Expression of the gene does not seem to be affected in
classical homeostatic models where several known regulators of appetite and reward are regulated. The protein has highly evolutionary conserved structural
properties that induce the targeting to the nucleus of
the cell, which may clarify why this newly identified
gene has different expression and regulation patterns
compared to the known neuroendocrine factors thus
far associated with human obesity.
