Abstract
Background: Gibbons or small apes inhabit tropical and subtropical rain forests in Southeast Asia and adjacent
regions, and are, next to great apes, our closest living relatives. With up to 16 species, gibbons form the most
diverse group of living hominoids, but the number of taxa, their phylogenetic relationships and their
phylogeography is controversial. To further the discussion of these issues we analyzed the complete mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene from 85 individuals representing all gibbon species, including most subspecies.
Results: Based on phylogenetic tree reconstructions, several monophyletic clades were detected, corresponding to
genera, species and subspecies. A significantly supported branching pattern was obtained for members of the
genus Nomascus but not for the genus Hylobates. The phylogenetic relationships among the four genera were also
not well resolved. Nevertheless, the new data permitted the estimation of divergence ages for all taxa for the first
time and showed that most lineages emerged during four short time periods. In the first, between ~6.7 and ~8.3
mya, the four gibbon genera diverged from each other. In the second (~3.0 - ~3.9 mya) and in the third period
(~1.3 - ~1.8 mya), Hylobates and Hoolock differentiated. Finally, between ~0.5 and ~1.1 mya, Hylobates lar diverged
into subspecies. In contrast, differentiation of Nomascus into species and subspecies was a continuous and
prolonged process lasting from ~4.2 until ~0.4 mya.
Conclusions: Although relationships among gibbon taxa on various levels remain unresolved, the present study
provides a more complete view of the evolutionary and biogeographic history of the hylobatid family, and a more
solid genetic basis for the taxonomic classification of the surviving taxa. We also show that mtDNA constitutes a
useful marker for the accurate identification of individual gibbons, a tool which is urgently required to locate
hunting hotspots and select individuals for captive breeding programs. Further studies including nuclear sequence
data are necessary to completely understand the phylogeny and phylogeography of gibbons.

Background
Gibbons, family Hylobatidae, are small arboreal apes,
which inhabit tropical and subtropical rainforests of
Southeast Asia and adjacent regions (Figure 1). Together
with humans and great apes, they belong to the primate
superfamily Hominoidea [1-4]. Among hominoids, gibbons were the first to branch off and they display a set
of morphological and behavioural characteristics distinctly different from great apes and humans [1,5,6].
Most prominent in this respect is the predominantly
monogamous life style, their territorial calls, and the
typical brachiating locomotion [1,4-7]. Due to their

extensive karyotypic diversity [8-11], gibbons provide an
excellent model organism to study chromosomal rearrangements and, hence, to better understand human diseases caused by such alterations.
Although in several aspects unique among primates
and with up to 16 species the most diverse group of
apes, gibbons are still in the shadow of great apes in
respect of scientific studies, conservation efforts and
public awareness. However, many gibbon species are on
the brink of extinction and most of them are classified
as “Endangered” or even “Critically Endangered” [12].
With approximately 20 individuals left in its native habitat, the Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus) is the rarest primate in the world [6,13,14]. Responsible for this
critical situation is habitat loss and hunting, which both

have seriously reduced gibbon populations throughout
their range [15,16]. Hence, much more attention has to
be drawn on the gibbons’ situation and extensive conservation actions are urgently required to save them
from extinction [16].
While gibbons are widely considered to form a monophyletic clade, there is no consensus about the phylogeny and taxonomy within the family. Although various
studies based on morphology, behaviour, vocalisation,
protein electrophoresis, karyotyping and DNA sequencing were conducted [3-5,7,17-35], neither a congruent
phylogeny nor a consistent taxonomic classification was
obtained. Moreover, incomplete taxon sampling as well
as misidentified specimens resulted in only fragmentary
or even false conclusions. Accordingly, the classification
of gibbon taxa at various taxonomic levels as well as
their phylogenetic relationships remain disputed and a
consensus is far from being available.
For example, in early studies, small apes were divided
into two genera, with one (Symphalangus) including the
siamang, and the other (Hylobates) all the remaining species [17,36]. Later on, the family was split into four major
clades, which were recognized as subgenera [2,5,21] and

eventually as genera [4,16,29,37,38]. This division is now
widely accepted and takes into account the fact that species within each of the four major clades share a number
of characteristics, most importantly a distinctive diploid
chromosome number: Hoolock (2n = 38), Hylobates
(2n = 44), Symphalangus (2n = 50) and Nomascus
(2n = 52) [8]. Similarly, the number of species and subspecies is a matter of debate as well. While Symphalangus
is consistently regarded as monotypic, the two Hoolock
subspecies were recently elevated to species [38]. In
Nomascus originally only one species was recognized
[17,18,20,39], but in current classifications four to six
species were suggested [2,4,12,16,34]. In contrast, the
genus Hylobates already comprised at least four species
in early classifications [17,39], but recent studies proposed six or seven species [2,4,16]. Due to this incongruence we follow the most recent classification of the
IUCN Red List [12] with a total of 16 gibbon species
(Table 1).
In the present study, we analyse the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene from 85 individuals,
which represent all gibbon genera and species, and most
subspecies. Based on our data, we are able to 1) provide

the most complete phylogeny of gibbons on all taxonomic levels, 2) estimate divergence times between
lineages, 3) establish a reliable classification, 4) elucidate
gibbon phylogeography, and 5) provide a tool for the
species identification of gibbon individuals.

Results
From all 85 gibbons, we successfully generated
sequences of the complete mitochondrial cytb gene
(1,140 bp). A contamination of our dataset with nuclear
pseudogenes (numts) can be regarded as minimal,
because no multiple amplifications of different copies
were detected by direct sequencing. All sequences were
correctly transcribed, and identical sequences were
obtained for the same individual in cases where different
material types were available. Moreover, no inconsistent
positions were detected in alignments, which were
assembled from overlapping sequences. Cross-contamination between individuals can be excluded as well,
since all negative controls revealed no amplifications
and randomly repeated PCRs for the same individual
produced identical sequences.
Among the 85 individual gibbons studied, no identical
haplotypes were detected. The cytb alignment comprising solely gibbons was characterized by 429 variable
sites, of which 374 were parsimony-informative. In the
complete alignment, which additionally contained great
ape, human and hamadryas baboon representatives, we
observed 565 variable sites, of which 462 were parsimony-informative.
Phylogenetic tree reconstructions based on maximumparsimony (MP), neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian algorithms revealed various
strongly supported clades, which corresponded to genera, species and subspecies (Figure 2). All algorithms led
to identical tree topologies, although several branching
patterns gained only weak support. According to our
reconstructions, hominoids diverged into a clade consisting of gibbons, and another with great apes and
human. Among the latter, Pongo split off first, followed
by Gorilla, before finally Pan and Homo diverged.
Within gibbons, a basal position of Nomascus and a sister grouping of Hylobates and Hoolock was indicated,
but support for this branching pattern was relatively low
(Table 2). Similarly, with the exception of a strongly
supported H. agilis + H. albibarbis clade, also the relationships among the species of Hylobates were not well
resolved. However, at least species monophylies were
clearly confirmed, though a common origin of H. agilis
was only weakly supported. The relationships among the
subspecies of H. muelleri and H. lar were less resolved.
In Hoolock, the two species H. hoolock and H. leuconedys clearly segregated into two distinct clades. Within
Nomascus, relationships among species were completely

Page 4 of 13

resolved, suggesting a N. hainanus + N. nasutus clade as
sister lineage to the remaining species. Among them, N.
concolor branched off first, followed by the divergence
of N. gabriellae and N. leucogenys/N. siki. The monophyly of N. leucogenys was significantly supported, but
evidence for a common origin of N. siki individuals was
not obtained. Within N. concolor, specimens identified
as N. concolor lu formed a distinct clade, while the
remaining subspecies clustered together without further
subdivision. However, support for a reciprocal monophyly of both clades was relatively low.
Based on divergence age estimates, gibbons separated
from great apes and humans 16.26 million years ago
(mya) (for 95% credibility intervals see Table 2). Within
hominids, Pongo branched off first (13.83 mya), followed
by Gorilla (8.90 mya), before finally Homo and Pan
diverged from each other (6.56 mya). The differentiation
of Pongo and Pan into species occurred 4.12 and 2.74
mya, respectively. In an initial radiation, gibbons
diverged within a relative short time period of only 1.65
million years (6.69-8.34 mya) into four genera. Within
Hylobates, most species diverged from each other
between 3.02 and 3.90 mya. The only exception was the
separation of H. albibarbis from H. agilis 1.56 mya,
which was in the time frame of subspecies splits within
H. muelleri (1.42-1.78 mya). Differentiation of H. lar
into subspecies occurred even later (0.52-1.05 mya). The
two Hoolock species diverged 1.42 mya from each other.
In Nomascus, differentiation into species took place over
a longer time period, lasting from 4.24 until 0.55 mya.
The most recent species divergence within Nomascus
occurred between N. siki and N. leucogenys (0.55 mya),
which was in a similar range as the separation of N. concolor lu from the other N. concolor subspecies (0.43
mya).

Discussion
By analysing all species and most subspecies, the present
study provides the most complete view into the evolutionary history of the gibbon family. However, as in earlier molecular studies on gibbons [26-35], relationships
on various taxonomic levels are less resolved and partially contradict earlier findings. While the herein
depicted branching pattern among genera is identical
with that found in earlier studies using also cytb [32] or
D-loop [29] sequences, it differs from another cytbbased study [28] in placing Nomascus and not Symphalangus as most basal genus. Studies based on mitochondrial ND3-ND4 sequences [31] or chromosomal
rearrangements [8] suggest Hoolock as most ancestral
lineage, and Nomascus together with either Hylobates
[31] or Symphalangus [8] as the most recently diverged
genera. For Hylobates, our data indicate a basal position
of H. klossii, and a further division into a clade

consisting of H. lar, H. muelleri, H. agilis and H. albibarbis, and another one with H. moloch and H. pileatus.
Various branching patterns among Hylobates species are
proposed [27,31,32,35], which all differ from our one,
but respective support values are similarly low as in our
study. In contrast, the relationships found among species of the genus Nomascus are well resolved and identical with that suggested by [30,31,33,34].
According to our and earlier data, relationships among
gibbon genera and Hylobates species remain disputed,
which most likely can be explained by the separation of
respective lineages within relative short time periods.
This becomes even more obvious when considering estimated divergence ages, which fall into four temporal
windows. In the first, between ~6.7 and ~8.3 mya, the
four gibbon genera originated. In a second radiation,
between ~3.0 and ~3.9 mya, Hylobates split into various
species, and in a third burst, between ~1.3 and ~1.8
mya, H. muelleri, the H. agilis + H. albibarbis clade and
Hoolock further differentiated. Finally, in a fourth radiation, between ~0.5 and ~1.1 mya, H. lar diverged into
subspecies. In contrast, speciation in Nomascus was a
continuous process, lasting from 4.24 until 0.55 mya.
Taxonomic implications

Our data show that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) provides a powerful tool for the identification and taxonomic classification of gibbons, because taxa form
strongly supported monophyletic clades, or at least
appear to form distinct lineages in those cases where
only one individual per taxon was tested. Moreover,
most differentiation events fall into four temporal periods, which allow a hierarchical ranking as proposed by
Goodman et al. [40], though the threshold for the recognition of a certain taxonomic unit whether genus, species, or subspecies remains disputed. Hence, to provide
a more reliable classification, we compare divergence
ages among gibbon lineages with those among other
Asian primates and hominids.
Accordingly and concordant with recent classifications
[4,12,16,29,34,37,38,41], the four major gibbon lineages
are proposed as distinct genera (Table 1), since they
split from each other in a similar time range as did colobine genera [[42,43], Roos C, Zinner D, Schwarz C,
Nash SD, Xing J, Batzer MA, Leendertz FH, Ziegler T,
Perwitasari-Farajallah D, Nadler T, Walter L, Osterholz
M: Nuclear versus mitochondrial DNA: evidence for
hybridization in colobine monkeys, submitted] or African great apes and human [40,42]. Most species of Hylobates and Nomascus emerged in or around the second
radiation, which is on the same time scale as species
splits within Pongo and Pan, and the separation of species groups within Macaca [44,45] and Trachypithecus
[46]. Thus, taxa originating in this time period should

Page 7 of 13

be recognized as distinct species (H. moloch, H. pileatus,
H. klossii, H. lar, H. muelleri, H. agilis/H. albibarbis,
H. hoolock/H. leuconedys, N. nasutus, N. hainanus,
N. concolor, N. gabriellae/N. leucogenys/N. siki), and
might be even classified as species groups. Further differentiation events among gibbons occurred in the third
time period, which is in a similar window as several speciation events within macaques [44,45]. Accordingly,
H. leuconedys and H. albibarbis should be separated
from H. hoolock and H. agilis on species level, respectively, and the three subspecies of H. muelleri could be
considered for elevation to species level. Moreover,
H. agilis is divided into two clades, which refer to individuals identified by pelage coloration as H. agilis agilis
and H. agilis unko. However, in a recent work based on
a larger number of individuals a reciprocal monophyly
of both lineages is doubted [47], and, hence, we provisionally recognize H. agilis as monotypic. For H. lar,
only a few unambiguously identified specimens were
available for our study, but these represent at least four
of the five recognized subspecies, while the identity of
the putative H. lar yunnanensis individual remains
uncertain. Based on our data, H. lar subspecies form
distinct lineages, which diverged relative recently. We
provisionally accept all five subspecies, though ongoing
studies might reject some or all of them. For N. concolor, our data indicate a separation of N. concolor lu from
the remaining subspecies, which form a clade without
further subdivision into taxa. Hence and concordant
with Monda et al. [33] and Roos et al. [34], we provisionally classify N. concolor furvogaster and N. concolor
jingdongensis as synonyms of N. concolor concolor, while
we feel N. concolor lu is a separate subspecies. We
further separate N. gabriellae from N. siki/N. leucogenys
on species level, while it is questionable whether the latter two should be recognized as species or subspecies.
Our study reveals a split between both taxa just 0.55
mya, which is in a similar range as the subspecies differentiation within H. lar or N. concolor. Hence, a separation of both taxa only on subspecies level would be
indicated. However, both taxa show slight differences in
vocalisation and facial colouration [4,5,15], and Carbone
et al. [48] found a chromosomal inversion unique to N.
leucogenys. Accordingly, we follow here the current view
and recognize N. leucogenys and N. siki as distinct species. In summary, we recognize four gibbon genera with
18 species and seven subspecies (Table 1).
Biogeographic implications

Multiple radiations in the evolutionary history of gibbons suggest a complicated biogeographic pattern leading to the current distribution of gibbon taxa. Since
gibbons are arboreal [7,39], radiations most likely were
correlated with expanding forest habitats. In fact, the

Thinh et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/74

complete range of gibbons experienced complex geographical and environmental changes during the last ten
million years. Notably, in the late Miocene as well as in
the Plio- and Pleistocene, a series of dramatic climatic
changes influenced the geography and vegetation in the
region, leading to shifts in the extension and distribution
of different habitat types [49-54]. In particular, periods
of maximum glaciation might have reduced rainforest
cover, resulting in the appearance of more open and
deciduous vegetation types in many parts of the region
[[52-57], but see [58]]. Moreover, due to the alternately
falling and rising sea water levels during the several glacial and interglacial periods [59-64], connections and
separations of landmasses were common, and repeated
migration between islands and today’s mainland was
possible [65-67].
By combining the available information, we develop the
following dispersal scenario for gibbons, which is in general agreement with that proposed by Chatterjee [32,68],
Harrison et al. [69], and Jablonski and Chaplin [70], but
which differs substantially from them in some aspects.
Accordingly, gibbons most likely originated on the Asian
mainland, because all four gibbon genera occur there.
Specifically, the Hengduan mountains in the border
region of today’s Burma, India and China might have
been a possible diversification hotspot [71,72]. In the
region, all the larger Southeast Asian rivers (Mekong,
Salween, Yangtze) rise, which are all well known as barriers for arboreal primates [54]. Although these rivers
changed their courses several times, their upper reaches
in the Hengduan mountains exist at least since the early
Miocene [73]. Recently, the Hengduan mountains were
also proposed as a region of differentiation for colobine
monkeys, and, most interestingly, respective splitting
events occurred on a similar time scale as in gibbons
[Roos C, Zinner D, Schwarz C, Nash SD, Xing J, Batzer
MA, Leendertz FH, Ziegler T, Perwitasari-Farajallah D,
Nadler T, Walter L, Osterholz M: Nuclear versus mitochondrial DNA: evidence for hybridization in colobine
monkeys, submitted]. In fact, in the late Miocene, widely
distributed rain forest habitats promoted range extension
for arboreal primates [50,54]. Accordingly, in the late
Miocene, Nomascus invaded the region east of the
Mekong, Hoolock entered the region west of the Salween,
and Hylobates and Symphalangus migrated into the area
in-between and later on into Sundaland.
Hylobates successfully colonized large parts of Sundaland, but also survived on the Asian mainland. Shortly
after its arrival in Sundaland in the Pliocene, populations
on the Asian mainland, the Malay peninsula, Sumatra,
Borneo, Java and the Mentawai archipelago became isolated. At the same time, various species groups of the genera Macaca and Trachypithecus diverged [44-46],
indicating dramatic environmental changes. In fact, this

Page 8 of 13

time period was characterized by global warming and sea
levels similar to today [54,61-63], which prevented migration between landmasses and, thus, promoted speciation
due to vicariance. Whether Symphalangus experienced a
similar range expansion in Sundaland like Hylobates,
remains questionable. Today the genus appears only on
Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, and fossil data provide
only evidence for its historical occurrence on Java and
Sumatra [69]. In the early Pleistocene, further differentiation in Hylobates occurred on Borneo and Sumatra, and in
Hoolock on the mainland which is on a similar time scale
when macaque species diverged [44,45], and which might
has been triggered by the shrinking of forest habitats due
to cold phases [[74], but see [58]]. Notably, H. albibarbis is
mitochondrially closer related to Sumatran H. agilis than
to the other Bornean gibbons, and acoustic, morphological
and chromosomal data suggest an intermediate position
[2,5,47,75]. Accordingly, H. albibarbis might be the product of an ancient hybridization event, in which proto-H.
agilis invaded Borneo during sea level lowstands [61-64],
and successfully reproduced with proto-H. muelleri. As we
find mtDNA of proto-H. agilis in H. albibarbis, female
introgression is the most likely hybridization scenario,
which is in agreement with recent findings, that gibbon
females disperse over longer distances than males [76].
Finally, in a last range expansion in the early to middle
Pleistocene, H. lar colonized, starting from its Sumatran
refuge, the Malaysian peninsular and mainland Southeast
Asia [see also [70]].
In contrast to the biogeographic pattern found in
Hylobates and to the scenario proposed by Chatterjee
[32,68], for Nomascus not a radiation but a successive
migration from North to South over a long time period
becomes evident. Based on our data, Nomascus originated in the border region of Vietnam and China in the
early Pliocene and it took to the early Pleistocene until
the genus reached the southern extend of its current
distribution in southern Vietnam and Cambodia.
Conservation implications

All gibbon species are on the brink of extinction and,
with the exception of H. leuconedys (Vulnerable), are
classified as “Endangered” or even “Critically Endangered” [12,16]. With approximately 20 individuals left in
its native habitat, the Hainan gibbon (N. hainanus) is
the rarest primate in the world [6,13,14], and the situation for its closest relative, the Cao-vit crested gibbon
(N. nasutus) with approximately 100 individuals left
[12,77], as well as for other gibbon species, the situation
is alarming. Reasons for the decline of gibbons are
manifold, but habitat loss due to forest clearance for
agricultural use, oil palm or rubber plantations, gold
mining, or charcoal and timber production, as well as
illegal hunting for food and sport, and the trade for pets

Thinh et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/74

or medicine are major threats to wild gibbon populations [15,16].
To save gibbons from extinction, urgent actions are
required to prevent ongoing habitat destruction and
hunting, and to build up a viable gene pool in captivity
for later release purposes. Specifically, to prevent or at
least reduce hunting, hunting hotspots have to be identified. Therefore, it is crucial to confirm the taxon identity
and if possible the geographical origin of confiscated
gibbons or their remains. Similarly, to avoid artificial
hybrids, only gibbons with clear taxon identity should
be considered for reproduction in zoos or rescue centres. Finally, if captive gibbons are reintroduced into the
wild, it has to be ascertained that these gibbons are pure
individuals and of the same taxon as those, which naturally occur in the area they are to be released.
An accurate taxonomic identification of gibbons based
on vocal data or pelage colouration is sometimes complicated [4,5]. In this respect, mtDNA analysis might be
a promising tool. As shown in our study, gibbon taxa
can be diagnosed through mtDNA, and, hence, a secure
identification can easily be obtained. Yet since mtDNA
is only maternally inherited, possible hybrids will not be
detected in such analysis, so that additional markers
should be studied as well.

Conclusions
Due to a nearly complete taxon sampling, the present
study provides the most comprehensive insights into the
evolutionary and biogeographic history of the hylobatid
family. Based on estimated divergence ages and unresolved relationships among gibbon taxa on various
levels, several radiation-like splitting events are indicated, which suggest a complex biogeographic history of
gibbons. Presumably, most of these differentiation
events occurred in wave-like range expansions in Sundaland and the Asian mainland followed by vicariance
effects, most likely caused by alternately shrinking and
expanding rain forest habitats and by repeated separations and connections of landmasses. In contrast, in the
region east of the Mekong river gibbons underwent a
successive North-to-South migration. Our study also
shows that mtDNA provides a solid platform for the
taxonomic classification of gibbons and that mtDNA
can be successfully applied to accurately identify the
species affiliation of gibbon individuals, which is
urgently required for conservation purposes. However,
to completely understand the phylogeny and phylogeography of gibbons, to identify hybrids in captivity, or to
trace possible ancient hybridization events as it might
be indicated for H. albibarbis, further studies including
extended mitochondrial as well as autosomal, X and Y
chromosomal sequence data, are necessary.

Methods
Sample Collection

A total of 85 specimens representing all species and
most subspecies of hylobatids were included in our
study. Blood, tissue, faecal or hair samples were collected during field surveys, in zoos or rescue centres, or
from museum specimens between 1995 and 2008 (Additional file 1). Blood and hair samples were taken during
routine health checks by veterinarians. Tissue samples
were obtained only from deceased animals. Taxon identity of individuals was ascertained by pelage coloration,
morphology and if possible by vocalization and geographic origin. With the exception of some H. lar individuals for which subspecies identity could not be
traced, only clearly identified specimens were included
in our study. Fresh tissue or faecal samples were preserved in 80-90% ethanol and dry samples (tissue,
museum skins, hair samples) were placed in plastic bags
without any additive. Samples were stored at ambient
temperature for up to six months before further
processing.
Laboratory Methods

Total genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Blood
& Tissue and QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kits from Qiagen.
When hair follicle cells were used, up to three hairs were
directly implemented into the PCR reaction. From highquality DNA, the complete mitochondrial cytb gene was
PCR-amplified in a single fragment with the primers
5’-AATGATATGAAAAACCATCGTTGTA-3’
and
5’-TTCATTTCCGGCTTACAAGAC-3’. For low-quality
DNA, extracted from faeces or museums material, two to
seven overlapping PCR products were amplified with primers constructed on the basis of sequences from conspecifics (respective primers are available from the authors
upon request). For all amplifications, wax-mediated hotstart PCRs were performed for 40 cycles, each with a
denaturation step at 92°C for 1 min, annealing at 60°C for
1 min, and extension at 72°C for 0.5-1.5 min, followed by
a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. The results of the
PCR amplifications were checked on 1% agarose gels. Subsequently, PCR products were cleaned with the Qiagen
Gel Extraction kit and sequenced on an ABI 3130xl
sequencer using the BigDye Cycle Sequencing kit.
Sequences were assembled with Geneious v4.6.1 [78] and
checked for their potential to be correctly transcribed.
Gibbon haplotypes were deposited at GenBank and are
available under the accession numbers GU321245GU321329 (see also Additional file 1).
To prevent cross-species contaminations, laboratory
procedures followed described standards [46]. To exclude
contaminations of the dataset with numts, we mainly
used material in which nuclear DNA is highly degraded

Thinh et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/74

(faeces, museum tissue) [79,80]. Moreover, the applied
primers are known to amplify solely the mitochondrial
copy of the gene in hylobatids [34], and for cross-validation purposes, for some specimens, sequences were generated using different material types (blood, faeces).
Statistical Methods

For phylogenetic reconstructions, we expanded our dataset with orthologous sequences from various hominids
(Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo) and Papio hamadryas,
which was used as outgroup. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed with MP and NJ algorithms as implemented
in PAUP v4.0b10 [81] as well as with ML and Bayesian
algorithms, using the programs GARLI v0.951 [82] and
MrBayes v3.1.2 [83,84]. For MP analysis, all characters
were treated as unordered and equally weighted throughout. A heuristic search was performed with the maximum number of trees set to 100. For NJ and ML
reconstructions, the optimal nucleotide substitution
model (GTR + Γ) was chosen using Akaike information
criterion (AIC) as implemented in MODELTEST v3.7
[85]. Relative support of internal nodes was performed by
bootstrap analyses with 10,000 (MP, NJ) or 500 replications (ML). In GARLI, only the model specification settings were adjusted according to the dataset, while all
other settings were left at their default value. ML majority-rule consensus trees were calculated in PAUP. For
Bayesian reconstructions, the dataset was partitioned into
codon positions, each with its own substitution model.
We used four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
chains with the default temperature of 0.1. Four repetitions were run for 10,000,000 generations with tree and
parameter sampling occurring every 100 generations.
The first 25% of samples were discarded as burnin, leaving 75,001 trees per run. Posterior probabilities for each
split and a phylogram with mean branch lengths were
calculated from the posterior density of trees.
To estimate divergence times, a Bayesian MCMC
method, which employs a relaxed molecular clock
approach [86], as implemented in BEAST v1.4.8 [87],
was used. A relaxed lognormal model of lineage variation and a Yule prior for branching rates was assumed.
The alignment was partitioned into codon positions,
and the substitution model, rate heterogeneity and base
frequencies were unlinked across codon positions. Optimal nucleotide substitution models were chosen using
AIC in MODELTEST.
For calibrations we used the fossil-based divergence
between Homo and Pan, which was dated at 6 - 7 mya
[88-90], the separation of Pongo from the Homo/Pan lineage ~14 mya [91], and the divergence of hominoids and
cercopithecoids ~23 mya [92,93]. Instead of hardbounded
calibration points, we used the published dates as a normal
distribution prior for the respective node. For the Homo -

Page 10 of 13

Pan divergence, this translates into a normal distribution
with a mean of 6.5 mya and a standard deviation (SD) of
0.5 mya, for the separation of Pongo from the Homo/Pan
clade into a mean of 14.0 mya and a SD of 1.0 mya, and
for the hominoid - cercopithecoid divergence into a mean
of 23 mya and a SD of 2 mya.
Since the estimation of phylogenetic relationships was
not the main aim of this analysis, for the calculation an apriori fixed tree topology as obtained from NJ reconstructions using the GTR + Γ model (Figure 2) was implemented. Four replicates were run for 10,000,000 generations
with tree and parameter sampling occurring every 100
generations. The adequacy of a 10% burnin and convergence of all parameters were assessed by visual inspection
of the trace of the parameters across generations using
TRACER v1.4.1 [94]. Subsequently, the sampling distributions were combined (25% burnin) using the software LogCombiner v1.4.8, and a consensus chronogram with node
height distribution was generated and visualized with
TreeAnnotator v1.4.8 and FigTree v1.2.2 [95].
