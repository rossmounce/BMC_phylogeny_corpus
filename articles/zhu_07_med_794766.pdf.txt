Abstract
Background: Despite a remarkable success in the computational prediction of genes in Bacteria
and Archaea, a lack of comprehensive understanding of prokaryotic gene structures prevents from
further elucidation of differences among genomes. It continues to be interesting to develop new ab
initio algorithms which not only accurately predict genes, but also facilitate comparative studies of
prokaryotic genomes.
Results: This paper describes a new prokaryotic genefinding algorithm based on a comprehensive
statistical model of protein coding Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and Translation Initiation Sites
(TISs). The former is based on a linguistic "Entropy Density Profile" (EDP) model of coding DNA
sequence and the latter comprises several relevant features related to the translation initiation.
They are combined to form a so-called Multivariate Entropy Distance (MED) algorithm, MED 2.0,
that incorporates several strategies in the iterative program. The iterations enable us to develop a
non-supervised learning process and to obtain a set of genome-specific parameters for the gene
structure, before making the prediction of genes.
Conclusion: Results of extensive tests show that MED 2.0 achieves a competitive high
performance in the gene prediction for both 5' and 3' end matches, compared to the current best
prokaryotic gene finders. The advantage of the MED 2.0 is particularly evident for GC-rich genomes
and archaeal genomes. Furthermore, the genome-specific parameters given by MED 2.0 match with
the current understanding of prokaryotic genomes and may serve as tools for comparative genomic
studies. In particular, MED 2.0 is shown to reveal divergent translation initiation mechanisms in
archaeal genomes while making a more accurate prediction of TISs compared to the existing gene
finders and the current GenBank annotation.

Background
At the time of this writing nearly 400 complete prokaryotic genomes, including 28 archaeal ones, have been

deposited in the GenBank database. Driven by the acceleration in genome sequencing, several successful gene
prediction programs have been designed for prokaryotic

genomes, such as the GeneMark series [1,2], Glimmer
[3,4] and ZCURVE [5]. The first two algorithms employ an
inhomogeneous Markov model for short DNA segments
(i.e. k-tuples), from which an estimate of the likelihood
for the segment to belong to a protein coding sequence is
derived after a training with existing gene data. ZCURVE is
based on a Z-curve representation of a segment of DNA
sequence, which is a specific statistic of the whole
sequence. This category of methods are capable of an ab
initio prediction of genes for newly sequenced genomes,
and they integrate the information from sequence statistics with signal identification [6-8]. Another broad category of gene prediction methods developed earlier are
based on similarity search, which comprises such programs as BLASTX and FASTA [9,10]. ORPHEUS [11] is a
typical system that utilizes similarity-based algorithms.
Larsen and Krogh [12] have developed an EasyGene system that combines the two approaches, using the classical
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in combination with protein similarity search BLASTP. However, not all of genes
(70–80%) in newly sequenced prokaryotic genomes show
significant similarity with function-known genes, it is still
a practical goal to develop the ab initio gene-finding algorithms that require no prior knowledge of the genes of the
prokaryotic genome of interest [8].
Despite the success of the existing prokaryotic gene finders, systematic bias is significantly due to the necessity of
pre-training the prediction program with existing gene
data [13]. This is particularly serious for gene starts and
short genes whose computational annotation is still quite
suspicious [14,15]. The systematic bias is also notable for
GC-rich genomes to be annotated, since the sequence patterns of GC-rich genomes appear to be different to those
with lower GC content [5]. It is argued that the number of
potential errors in the annotation may be much higher
than what is usually believed [7]. A serious case is the
archaeal genome Aeropyrum pernix. Initially, all ORFs
longer than 300 bps were annotated as coding genes by
the original authors who submitted the data to GenBank,
but significant disagreements arose later from several
computational prediction groups [16]. Moreover, both
recent experiments and in silico analyses have shown that
the genomic patterns and hence the mechanisms of translation initiation process are proved to be diversified in
Archaea [17,18]. Thus the prediction of archaeal genes is
far from being a solved problem. It is commonly believed
that a better understanding of the structures of genes both
in bacterial and archaeal genomes with a wider variety of
GC content is an essential component for improvements
of gene prediction.
In this paper, we present a new non-supervised gene prediction algorithm for bacterial and archaeal genomes. The
algorithm aims to develop a comprehensive statistical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/97

model with a clear picture of the architecture of prokaryotic genes, in which the biological understanding is explicitly presented. It is based on the model of protein coding
Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and Translation Initiation
Sites (TISs). The former is based on a linguistic "Entropy
Density Profile" (EDP) model [19] of coding DNA
sequence and the latter comprises several relevant features
related to the initiation of a translation process. They are
combined to form a so-called Multivariate Entropy Distance (MED) algorithm, MED 2.0, that incorporates several strategies in the iterative program. The iterations
enable an non-supervised learning process and to obtain
a set of genome-specific parameters before making the
prediction of genes. The main advantage of the algorithm
is that it gives efficient and accurate prediction of genes
particularly for genomic GC-rich species and Archaea, and
of gene-related properties such as the divergent translational initiation signals and genome-specific usage of start
codon ATG, GTG and TTG without any training data. This
feature of our work, namely a close link between the gene
prediction method and the biological understanding of
gene structure, is believed to be helpful in understanding
the genomic comparison and evolution for Bacteria and
Archaea.
The model developed here includes an EDP model for the
coding potential of an ORF, and a TIS model for the gene
starts. We begin by briefly reviewing EDP model used in
our previous work [19]. We then emphasize on describing
the TIS model, and the implementation of the gene prediction system MED 2.0 based on an iterative learning
algorithm.
The EDP model for coding potential of ORF
The EDP model is a global statistical description for a
DNA sequence, which employs a Shannon's artificial linguistic description for a DNA sequence of finite length like
an ORF. It is different from the Markov model-based local
approach that usually selects a few local features of the
class of sequences. Instead of the amino acid composition
{pi} (i = 1, ..., 20) for an ORF, an EDP vector S = {si}
inferred from {pi} is used to represent the sequence with
an emphasis on the information content, where i is the
index of the twenty amino acids. The EDP {si} is defined
by [19].

si = −

1
pi log pi ,
H

(1)

where H = −∑ j =1 p j log p j is the Shannon entropy, and j
20

= 1, ..., 20 also represents the index of the twenty amino
acids.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/97

For a set of sequences such as all coding and noncoding
ORFs from a given genome, the vectors {si} scatter widely
in the 20-dimensional EDP phase space. Our basic working hypothesis is that the EDP vectors for coding ORFs
form separate clusters from those for noncoding ORFs, for
a possible reason that they moved along separate paths
during the evolution due to different selection pressure. If
this hypothesis is true, one can then develop a clustering
method in the EDP phase space that discriminates the
coding ORFs from the noncoding ones. The success of the
method confirms the validity of this hypothesis. Our previous study shows that there exists indeed one universal
center representative of coding ORFs and one universal
center of noncoding ORFs in the EDP phase space for dozens of analysed species [19]. For GC-rich genomes, our
current research based on Principal Component Analysis
(PGA) shows that ORFs form six clusters in the EDP phase
space due to the genomic GC content bias (data not
shown), one for coding ORFs while other five for noncoding ORFs, which is also consistent with a previous
study [20]. Thus the noncoding ORFs of GC-rich genomes
are represented with five universal centers in the EDP
phase space. Following the ZCURVE algorithm [5], we
refer to the GC-rich genome as a genome with GC content
higher than 56%. Consequently, the universal centers
allow us to construct an iterative procedure to define a
refined coding potential [19]. This procedure begins by
finding a set of "root" coding and noncoding ORFs
({S(k)coding} and {S(l)noncoding}), which have been demonstrated with high reliability based on the universal EDP
centers [19], and then builds a coding potential of a DNA
sequence S like an ORF as the ratio of the distance to each
of the EDP clusters

where k and l are the indices of two clusters of root coding
and noncoding ORFs, D(S, S') can be defined by the Euclidean distance between two EDP vectors S = {si} and S' =
{ si′ } as
D(S, S') = (∑i (si - si′ )2)1/2, i = 1, ..., 20.
A noteworthy feature of this coding potential is that it is
able to generate a cluster with non-trivial boundary and
thus achieve a classification of the two classes of
sequences with remarkable accuracy [19]. For this reason,
the EDP model has been successfully used to produce
training ORF set in the newest version of Glimmer
method [21].

The TIS model for translation start site of prokaryotic
genes
The TIS model in MED 2.0, which is a further extension of
the RBS model described earlier [22], makes a conscious
effort to model the following prominent features for
prokaryotic gene structure: (1) Upstream to the TIS there
exists one or a few common motifs that act as the binding
sites for the initiation of translation or transcription, these
common motifs usually have a position-specific distribution in upstream region from the start sites; (2) Among
various genomes, the usage of start codon ATG, GTG and
TTG is different; (3) For ORFs with multiple candidate
start codons, the leftmost start codons are usually the TISs.
However, those start codons located after the leftmost
ones are also chosen to be TISs according to different
probability; (4) The (overlapping) distance between the
neighbor genes has a characteristic probability distribution; (5) For GC-rich genomes, there exists a high GC content at the codon first and third position due to the GC
content bias [4,5,8,11,12,22,23]. These features are
included in the TIS model, allowing us to iteratively find
the true TIS after the determination of the right 3' end coding ORFs. It is notable that no training data is required to
fix the model parameters. The various probabilities mentioned above are obtained by non-supervised learning
during the iteration. It is intriguing to note also that these
probabilities are genome-specific quantities and their differentiation between genomes may likely be interesting
and significant for comparative genomic studies.

For the RBS model in our previous work [22], two likelihood functions are defined, one being associated with the
Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif [24], Φmotif, and another being
directly related to the start codon, Φstart. The total likelihood reads Φtotal = Φmotif + Φstart. We have made several crucial extensions of that model as follows.
First, many Archaea (e.g. S. solfataricus) are detected to
have both SD signals of bacterial type in near upstream
region and box A motifs of eukaryotic type in the further
upstream region from TIS. So, MED 2.0 defines two motif
searching regions, Vup = [-35, -15] and Vlow = [-20, -1], and
carries out search for candidate motifs separately in each
region.
Secondly, a new likelihood function is defined to describe
the probability that two ORFs overlap, which is given by a
distribution of the distance between a start codon and the
STOP codon of the immediate upstream ORF.
Thirdly, for GC-rich genomes we use a parameter CP
defined by formula (3) to describe the difference between
the coding region Vc = [1, 90] downstream and the noncoding region Vnc = [-90, -1] upstream to TIS. It has long
been known that the sequence patterns of genomes with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/97

GC-rich content show differences to those with normal or
low GC content. As a result, high GC content at the codon
third and first position has been reported for GC-rich
genomes [5,8]. Similar to Nishi et al. [8], we refer to GC(i)
as the G+C occurrence at the ith codon position, where i =
GC(1) + GC(3)
1, 2 or 3, then parameter θ =
is
GC(1) + GC(2) + GC(3)

ensemble of l-mers in the region Vup (or Vlow). Such measure is also used to refer to a weight for each region, as mup
= χ2(Tup)/(χ2(Tup) + χ2(Tlow)), and mlow = χ2(Tlow)/(χ2(Tup)
+ χ2(Tlow)) which allows us to obtain a combined measure
for a given candidate start codon

used to describe the nucleotide usage at the codon first
and third position. For both two regions Vc and Vnc, we
treat them as a set of codon sequences regardless of the
fact that the Vnc are noncoding sequences. Our analysis
shows that the probability distribution of usage Pc(θ) for

here, mstart = Max(mup, mlow). In above formula, score Φup
reflects the likelihood of a motif associated with transcription initiation signal in region Vup = [-35, -15], while Φlow
means the likelihood of a motif associated with translation initiation signal in region Vlow = [-20, -1], both two
scores include a weight matrix scoring function and an
occurrence probability in upstream region to TIS. For
score Φstart, it includes weight matrix scoring function of
sequences around TIS, the probability of start codon as
TIS compared with the leftmost start codon, and the ORF
overlap scoring function. If the genomic GC content is
higher than 56%, the scoring function given by formula
(4) will be added in. Note that the new likelihood function ΦTIS is able to describe both bacterial and archaeal
genomes in a unified way.

coding region Vc is significantly different from that of
usage Pnc(θ) of noncoding region Vnc. Thus for a DNA
sequence with a usage θ, the CP(θ) parameter is designed
to describe the probability of the sequence belonging to
coding region as follow
CP(θ) = Pc(θ)/(Pc(θ) + Pnc(θ)),

(3)

where 0 ≤ CP(θ) ≤ 1. To evaluate the likelihood of a start
codon as TIS, we calculate the nucleotide usage θc and θnc
for its downstream region [1, 90] and upstream region [90, -1] separately. Thus the likelihood function is defined
by the formula
start
ΦGC = [1 - CP(θnc)] * CP(θn),

(4)

start
start
where 0 ≤ ΦGC ≤ 1. Note that the score ΦGC is calcu-

lated only for the genomes with GC content higher than
56%, and this item is added into the start codon likelihood function Φstart developed in our previous work [22].
Fourthly, MED 2.0 introduces a measure of signal strength
in order to counter-balance the genomic nucleotide content bias. Let T be the ensemble of all l-mers in the set V of
upstream sequences of all candidate coding ORFs, and for
ˆ
each l-mer t ∈ T, denote by p (t) the observed frequency
in the region V. Denote also by p (t) the frequency of the
same l-mer if it is a random combination of its nucleotides; thus, p (t) can be estimated from single nucleotide
composition measured from the whole genome. Similarly
ˆ
to Fuglsang [25], we refer to X(t) = ( p (t) - p (t))2/ p (t) as
a measure of the over-representation of t ∈ T. When summing over the ensemble T, we have a measure, χ2(T) for
deciding whether Tupor Tlow is more likely to contain a
strong signal in Vup or Vlow, where Tup (or Tlow) means the

ΦTIS = mupΦup + mlowΦlow + mstartΦstart,

(5)

Finally, a distinction is made between transcript unit
internal (TUI) genes and transcript unit leader (TUL)
genes. Following Tolstrup et al. [26] and Torarinsson et al.
[18], we refer to TUI genes as those with a start codon separated from the stop codon of the nearest upstream gene
by < 50 bps, and TUL genes otherwise. Our analysis in S.
solfataricus shows that only SD-like motifs are found for
TUI genes while box A motifs are usually found for TUL
genes. In MED 2.0, each candidate start codon then definitely belongs to one of the two above categories, each of
which conducts the search for motifs separately. Furthermore, MED 2.0 forms a measure
up
up
low
low
λ = (χ 2 (TTUI ) − χ 2 (TTUI ))(χ 2 (TTUL ) − χ 2 (TTUL )),

(6)

to decide which of the two translation initiation mechanisms is predominant in a genome: λ > 0 for either completely SD signals or completely box A consensus, and λ ≤
0 for a mixture of the two. Tests show that most of Bacteria
and part of Archaea belong to the former, whereas many
of Archaea belong to the latter. In the latter case, MED 2.0
uses the Z-score to form a normalized TIS score which
allows to compare and select the right TIS. Therefore, our
method allows to describe more than one type of initiation signals which are located at different upstream positions.
The iterative learning algorithm
The gene finding system MED 2.0 predicts genes in two
stages: the coding ORF detection stage and the TIS refine-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/97

ment stage. The outline of sequence processing and model
self-training for two stages are shown in Fig. 1. We give a
summary of this algorithm as follows.
In the first step of coding ORF detection stage, all ORFs
longer than 90 bps are extracted in both strands and in all
three reading frames, thus to determine the EDP coding
potential. As stated above, using the universal coding and
noncoding EDP centers and with an iteration of consecutive root ORF finding, we decide a set of root coding/noncoding ORFs for each genome being analysed, which
typically cover more than 60% of all genes with a very
high reliability over 99% [19]. Note that we obtain both
"seed" coding ORFs and non-coding sequences, instead of
generating artificial non-coding ORFs as other methods
do [5]. These seed sequences form a reliable learning set
for the further analysis.
The system then goes to determine the remaining ORFs
excluded from the root ORFs. We search for conservative
motifs only in the near upstream region Vlow of the root

coding ORFs, namely setting mup = 0, and mlow = mstart = 1
in calculating the TIS score in formula (5). The candidate
start site with the highest TIS score is selected, then the
parameters are recalculated using the updated start sites.
This iteration process ends when no start site needs to be
relocated. The parameters are then obtained and used to
determine the remaining ORFs. This consists in calculating the TIS score of the remaining ORFs, and then evaluating their coding potential using a Fisher discriminant
algorithm (which is trained using B. subtilis) in a twodimensional plane of the EDP coding score and the TIS
score. For GC-rich genomes, the Fisher discriminant algorithm is applied in a three-dimensional space of the EDP
coding score, the TIS score and the θ score (calculated by
the θ parameter mentioned-above), which is trained using
P. aeruginosa. Our studies show that the discriminant coefficients are universal across prokaryotic genomes. Thus
the remaining ORFs are classified into coding ORFs and
noncoding ones.

To reduce the false positive in the detected coding ORFs
determined from the remaining ORFs, a strategy to resolve
overlap of coding ORFs is then applied. We define a quantity ξ to be the percentage of nucleotides overlapped with
other coding ORFs in either the same or the opposite
strand. The iteration goes as follows: (1) extend all the
detected coding ORFs to the longest ORFs by assigning the
leftmost start codon as the start of each ORF; (2) remove
those ORFs with ξ > ξi (setting ξ0 = 99%, where i is the iteration step); (3) recalculate the overlapping percentage for
all ORFs retained from the last step; and (4) reduce ξi by
1%, then repeats from step (2). This procedure iterates
until ξ reaches a threshold (50%, by default).
After the stage of coding ORF detection, MED 2.0 goes to
the next stage of TIS refinement for all coding ORFs. The
detected coding ORFs are first classified into two sets, TUI
and TUL. The system considers searching for either SD
motifs or box A motifs in both regions Vup = [-35, -15] and
Vlow = [-20, -1]. Then, one forms the combined TIS score in
formula (5), which is calculated together with all three
coefficients mup, mlow and mstart described above. For GCstart
rich genomes, the score Φstart includes the item of ΦGC in
formula (4). Then the global genomic measure λ is used
to decide which of the initiation mechanisms is more
appropriate for the genome studied. If λ > 0, the self-training of TIS model parameters runs in both Vup and Vlow for
all detected coding ORFs, we select the SD-like motif as
the main mechanism if χ2(Tup) <χ2(Tlow), or the box A
motif otherwise. For each coding ORF, the TIS score in formula (5) is calculated for all candidate start codons, then
the start codon with the highest score is selected as the
predicted TIS. If λ ≤ 0, the self-training is run with Vup and
Vlow together, but for TUI and TUL genes independently.
For each coding ORF, the normalized scores of both TUI
type and TUL type are calculated, and then compared to
select one with higher score as the most likely start codon
to relocate the gene start.

Results and Discussion
Genome sequences and reliable gene datasets
The bacterial and archaeal genomes and their annotations
used in this paper were downloaded from the GenBank
Release 149.0 in 2006.

We have selected experimentally confirmed genes as
benchmarks. For E. coli, we have used two datasets, the
EcoGene [27] and the Link dataset [28], with their newest
version (854 proteins in EcoGene and 195 N-terminally
confirmed genes in Link). For B. subtilis, following the
standard by Besemer et al. [23], we have taken it as one of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/97

a few annotated complete genomes that can be used to
evaluate the performance of exact gene prediction. Thus
we denoted all 4,100 genes annotated in GenBank as
Bsub_All dataset. For verifying short genes, we have chosen
Bsub123, Bsub72 and Bsub51 datasets, which are selected
from the B. subtilis and verified by protein similarity
search [23]. We have extracted 58 short genes from the
854 genes of EcoGene, denoted as EcoGene_short, to evaluate short gene prediction for E. coli.
For GC-rich genomes, we have built two data sets, Mtub66
and Paer107. The former includes 66 reliable genes with
confirmed TISs in M. tuberculosis with GC content of
65.6%, while the latter has 107 such genes in P. aeruginosa
with GC content of 66.6%. For archaeal genomes, we have
built a data set SolfGene including 56 reliable genes in S.
solfataricus with confirmed TISs. The three data sets
Mtub68, Paer111 and SolfGene, as well as the process of
determining these genes with their TISs confirmed by Nterminal protein sequencing or inferred from experimental evidences, can be accessed through [29].
Other benchmark programs
In order to benchmark MED 2.0, we have tested four genefinding methods (including five programs), Glimmer
(includes the latest published version Glimmer 2.02 [4]
and the newest release Glimmer 3.02 from website [21]),
GeneMarkS [23], ZCURVE [5] and EasyGene [12], to
make a comparison of the performance of gene prediction. The former three methods belong to the same category of our system as the ab initio gene prediction
methods, while the EasyGene belongs to another category
of methods using the extrinsic information by means of
similarity search [12].

Glimmer 2.02 was downloaded from [21] and installed
locally. We ran it following the instructions given in the
distribution file. A post-processor RBSfinder [30] has been
designed to further improve the TIS prediction by Glimmer 2.02. Thus, RBSfinder was used to process the original
output of Glimmer 2.02 and the refined TISs are then
taken as predicted ones by Glimmer system. RBSfinder is
accessible via the website at [31]. Herein, RBSfinder was
run repeatedly until over 99% of gene starts remain
unchanged. Recently, the newest version of Glimmer, i.e.
V3.02, has been released with several algorithmic changes
to reduce the number of false positive predictions and to
improve the accuracy of TIS predictions. Although the
article describing Glimmer 3.02 has not yet been found
from publication, a locally executable program is current
available from [21]. In order to have a comprehensive
comparison with Glimmer method, Glimmer 3.02 was
further included herein as benchmark program. We
downloaded the predictions by Glimmer 3.02 from its
website for all genomes studied in this paper.

The software ZCURVE 1.0 is freely available at [32]. It was
executed on our PC following the instruction file.
GeneMarkS provides only an online service of genomic
annotation, instead of a local executable program. The
newest results on several test sets mentioned above for E.
coli and B. subtilis by the current GeneMarkS have been
greatly improved than that of its initial version [23]. Similarly, there is still no new literature to report the
improved version of GeneMarkS. However we adopted all
the unpublished results returned to us via Email with the
current online analysis behind the interface [33], to compare with our program.
Similar to GeneMarkS, EasyGene is only accessible via its
web interface, and the pre-trained models are available for
only 27 genomes [34]. However, the EasyGene web server
has provided predictions for hundreds of chromosomes.
Therefore, for comparison purpose, EasyGene predictions
for a total of 112 genomes were downloaded from its website [34] available at the time we prepared our paper.
Accuracy of gene detection and interpretation of genomespecific model parameters
To illustrate the prediction accuracy of MED 2.0, we first
present the comparison against the GenBank annotation
for the 3' end match. Two independent quantities, Sn
(sensitivity) and Sp (specificity), are defined to evaluate
the performance of a gene finder at gene level as:

Sn = TP/(TP + FN), Sp = TP/(TP + FP).

(7)

Here, TP, FP, and FN are the number of true positive, false
positive, and false negative, respectively.
The MED 2.0 program has been run on all the complete
bacterial and archaeal genomes currently available on
GenBank. Additional File 1 includes the prediction results
on forty representative genomes, comprising 28 Bacteria
and 12 Archaea. Selected organisms cover most of the taxonomic groups, including Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota,
Nanoarchaeota for Archaea and α/β/γ/ε-proteobacteria,
Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, for Bacteria [35].
For the forty species, MED 2.0 achieves an average sensitivity of 97.6% and specificity of 87.8%. The results of
Glimmer 2.02, Glimmer 3.02, ZCURVE 1.0 and the newest GeneMarkS for the forty genomes as a comparison are
not shown in Additional File 1, but may be found in our
website. On the average, the newest version of GeneMarkS
gives the same level of sensitivity (98.0%) and the highest
specificity (93.0%), while Glimmer 2.02 and ZCURVE 1.0
give the sensitivity of 98.7% and 98.0%, and the specificity of 83.1% and 82.9%, respectively. As reported by
EasyGene's website, the average sensitivity and specificity
are 95.4% and 96.6% respectively for 29 of the 40

genomes. Compared with Glimmer 2.02 on average,
Glimmer 3.02 significantly reduces the false positives (Sp
= 92.3%) with almost no decreasing of the sensitivity of
97.7%. The average sensitivity and specificity of GeneMarkS reported in the original version [23], which was
run on eight genomes including E. coli, B. subtilis and A.
fulgidus, are 98.3% and 91.3%, respectively. A full comparison for 205 genomes has also been listed at our web
page. For the 205 genomes, MED 2.0 gives the average
sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 83.1%, while Glimmer 2.02 gives 98.0% and 79.8%, ZCURVE 1.0 gives
96.7% and 81.4%, Glimmer 3.02 gives 96.0% and 88.9%,
GeneMarkS gives 96.0% and 91.3%, and finally EasyGene
gives 93.5% and 96.1% averaged over 112 genomes,
respectively. However, we argue that the higher specificity
of the latter three programs is not unrelated to the fact that
they are highly optimized with the GenBank annotation.
It is clear that MED 2.0 is competitive with Glimmer 2.02
and ZCURVE 1.0, while the specificity of prediction is a
little higher than both of them. Both Glimmer 3.02 and
the newest GeneMarkS present rather high accuracies of
sensitivity and specificity against the current GenBank
annotation for the 3' end match, although there are not
yet publications to report them. Using the extrinsic information of similarity search, EasyGene is able to extremely
raise the specificity at the cost of its sensitivity slightly
lower than the ab initio gene prediction methods. It
should be noted that EasyGene has included many a confirmed gene of the query-genome as training set by using
BLASTP to search for significant protein matches in SwissProt [12], which makes an essential distinction between
such a method and the ab initio gene prediction method
such as MED 2.0. For instance, there are about 65% of all
4,329 genes in E. coli predicted by EasyGene have been
taken as the training set. Therefore a comparison against
all genes in the benchmark would over-estimate EasyGene's prediction performance. To discuss the predicting
performance on the current GenBank annotation, we
should point out that it can not be free from the bias since
both Glimmer and GeneMark series have been widely
used or involved in the GenBank annotation pipeline. The
statistical analysis shows that there are over 134 genomes
from GenBank before 2006 are in this case. While the
comparison against the GenBank annotation has played a
role during the early development of the computational
prediction programs, this comparison becomes increasingly suspicious as its bias becomes evident (towards the
programs which are used to create the GenBank annotation file).
Since the GenBank annotation is not fully accurate, further evaluation is performed based on the functionknown genes which have more reliable annotations. For
each genome, the function-known genes are selected from
GenBank by excluding those with product descriptions

with any of the key words as "-like", "conserved", "hypothetical", "homolog", "probable", "possible", "predicted",
"putative", "similarity" and "unknown". The ratio of the
number of these genes predicted correctly by MED 2.0 is
also listed in Additional File 1. Note that the specificity is
meaningless in this case. As we can see, the average accuracy for MED 2.0 is 99.1%, while the average accuracy for
Glimmer 2.02, Glimmer 3.02, ZCURVE 1.0, EasyGene
(averaged over 29 of 40 genomes) and the newest GeneMarkS is 99.4%, 99.2%, 98.9%, 98.3% and 99.3% (data
not shown in Additional File 1), respectively. For 205
genomes analysed, the average accuracy for MED 2.0,
Glimmer 2.02, Glimmer 3.02, ZCURVE 1.0, EasyGene
and the newest GeneMarkS may be calculated, which
gives 98.5%, 99.4%, 98.5%, 98.7%, 98.1% and 98.6%
respectively, Clearly, they are all at the same level. These
results can be found on our website. Therefore the genefinding accuracy for function-known genes of MED 2.0
and other five gene finders is well matched.
A distinctive feature of MED2.0 is that the algorithm
builds a prokaryotic gene structure model based on a set
of genome-specific parameters, which are calculated by
several self-learning iterations without any prior knowledge or training data. Comparing the model parameters
among different species, e.g. those of gene-related properties as TIS-upstream signals and usage of start codons
ATG, GTG and TTG, would shed light on the study of
genomic comparison and evolution for Bacteria and
Archaea [18]. To this end, we present in Additional File 1
the parameters of start codon usage and motifs found
upstream to TIS for each species, although a more detailed
list is provided in the output file by our program for the
user. Genomes in Additional File 1 are listed as two
groups of Bacteria (the first 28 species) and Archaea (the
last 12 species) and sorted alphabetically. Almost for all
analysed species, ATG is the most common start codon
(usage varying from 60% to 98%) compared with TTG
and GTG. An exception is the M. kandleri genome, for
which the three start codons are used nearly equally
(showing 26% usage of ATG). In contrast, the usage of
TTG to GTG is different for different species. For example,
GTG in C. glutamicum is much more favored than TTG
(23% vs 6%); while TTG in B. burgdorferi is more favored
than GTG (7% vs 20%). For 12 archaeal genomes, the start
codon usage predicted by MED 2.0 is very close to an earlier result annotated by EasyGene including the protein
similarity search method [18].
With the automatic control coefficient λ in formula (6)
and the resulting predicted motifs obtained by a nonsupervised learning process, MED 2.0 clearly defines three
types of translation initiation mechanisms and ascertains
which of the types each genome belongs to. In Additional
File 1, we go further and report the predicted motifs,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/97

meaning the most significant consensuses associated with
translation initiation signals in two searching regions [20, -1] and [-35, -15] upstream to TISs. For all of 28 analysed bacterial genomes, motifs are presented only in
region [-20, -1], while most of them belong to SD signal
type, which means the typical mechanism of translation
initiation with the SD signals for transcripts with leaders.
However, AT-rich motifs, "AATTT" and "AAATT" listed in
Additional File 1, are detected in region [-20, -1] for the
Synechocystis sp. genome, indicating the existence of a leadless translation initiation mechanism in Cyanobacteria. A
similar case is to the B. thetaiotaomicron genome, where Arich motifs are detected. For 12 analysed archaeal
genomes, three types of mechanisms are detected. Six species M. jannaschii, M. kandleri, M. maripaludis, M. thermoautotro., P. abyssi and P. furiosus are reported with motifs
of SD signal type only in region [-20, -1], meaning the
mechanism similar to the bacterial. In contrast, three
genomes Halobacterium sp., N. equitans and P. aerophilum
are shown that the motifs of box A type are predicted only
in region [-35, -15], which suggest a different mechanism
of translation initiation with a high level of genes producing leaderless transcripts. For three genomes A. fulgidus, P.
torridus and S. solfataricus, both box A motifs in region [35, -15] for leaderless transcripts and SD motifs in [-20, 1] for transcripts with leaders are detected. It implies that
a mixed mechanism of leaderless translation and leadered
translation is used in these genomes. The result is well
matched with that of previous studies [18,26].
A notable result is that most of the motifs of searching
region [-20, -1] found in Bacteria contain the tetramer
"GGAG" in contrast with that of "GGTG" in most
Archaea, it is also exactly consistent with that reported in
the earlier study [18]. However, note that for the Thermotoga maritima genome, the MED 2.0 analysis leads to an
interesting finding of SD-like motifs very richly observed
in Archaea. A phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA
sequence has revealed that T. maritima is a deep branching
species [36]. Moreover, it has been reported that over 20%
of genes in T. maritima were acquired through horizontal
gene transfer from Archaea [37]. Thus, the Archaea-like
feature in T. maritima might be interpreted as either an
ancient feature or, alternatively, a consequence of horizontal gene transfer.
Accuracy of exact prediction on reliable genes
In order to perform an accuracy test on the exact gene prediction, reliable gene datasets must be used since the GenBank annotations have systematic bias in the 5' end
prediction [15]. Before showing the results in this section,
we should like to stress that all six gene finders, including
MED 2.0, are compared to analyze each genome with the
same sensitivity and specificity against the GenBank
annotation as mentioned above. As a gene finder using a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/97

similarity search by alignment in Swiss-Prot to build TlSconfirmed ORFs, many a protein coding gene has been
included as training set of TIS for EasyGene. For example,
there are 679 of the 4,100 genes in Bsub_All dataset, and
356 of the 854 genes in EcoGene, have been employed as
its training set for B. subtilis and E. coli respectively. Thus
for a fair comparison with the ab initio methods, the accuracies of EasyGene on reliable test sets were calculated by
excluding the number of genes included into its training
set.
First we present the prediction accuracy on reliable test
sets Bsub_All, EcoGene and Link for bacterial genomes. As
indicated in Table 1, for only 3' end match, all six programs have nearly the same performance with accuracy
above 98.0%. For both 5' and 3' end matches, the current
version of GeneMarkS achieves the highest performance
with average accuracy of 91.5%, while MED 2.0 has a
comparative performance with average accuracy of 89.7%.
Note that for Bsub_All dataset, GeneMarkS has reported its
accuracy of 96.7% for 3' end match and 83.2% for both
end matches on 4,099 genes annotated in GenBank [23],
which is lower than the newest result (98.9% and 86.1%)
by the current GeneMarkS version, as well as lower than
that of MED 2.0 (98.7% and 83.8%) (see Table 1).
ZCURVE 1.0 shows slightly lower average accuracy of
88.2% for both end matches, and EasyGene does 87.6%,
while Glimmer 2.02 (post-processed by RBSfinder) gives
the lowest average accuracy of 81.0%. Glimmer 3.02 has
significantly improved the average accuracy to 89.6%,
reaching a similar performance as MED 2.0.
One of the remaining challenges for prokaryotic gene
finding is the identification of short genes 'buried' in an

enormous pile of false-positive short ORFs. Following the
standard adopted by many gene finders, we hereby define
short genes as those with length between 90 and 300 bps.
We have carried out a test on 58 short genes from 854 confirmed ones in EcoGene data set (denoted as
EcoGene_short). The test indicates that MED 2.0 has an
accuracy of 93.1% for 3' end match and also a high accuracy of 91.4% for both end matches. For the Bsub123,
Bsub72 and Bsub51 datasets [23] from B. subtilis, MED 2.0
detects 95.1%, 94.4% and 92.2% of 3' end match and
85.4%, 87.5% and 90.2% of both end matches, respectively. Similarly, note that the corresponding published
results of GeneMarkS on the same three datasets are
91.9%, 94.4% and 94.1% of 3' end match as well as
82.9%, 88.9% and 90.2% of both end matches [23],
which have been greatly improved given by the newest
online version. However as listed in Table 1, comparing
with other five gene finders shows that MED 2.0 gives a
higher performance in the short gene prediction than
Glimmer 2.02 (post-processed by RBSfinder), Glimmer
3.02, EasyGene and ZCURVE 1.0, while is comparable
with GeneMarkS.
To evaluate the performance of exact gene prediction for
GC-rich genomes, two reliable sets Paer107 and Mtub66
are used here for P. aeruginosa with GC content of 66.6%
and M. tuberculosis with GC content of 65.6%. Test on
Paer107 shows that MED 2.0 has an accuracy of 97.2% for
3' end match and 93.5% for both end matches, while on
Mtub66 gives an accuracy of 95.5% for 3' end match and
87.9% for both end matches. As we can see from the
eighth and ninth lines in Table 1, compared with Glimmer 2.02 (post-processed by RBSfinder), Glimmer 3.02,
ZCURVE 1.0, EasyGene and the newest online version of

Table 1: Prediction for 5' and 3' gene-ends for five programs on test sets. Comparison of prediction for 5' and 3' ends of genes are
performed among MED 2.0 (MED), Glimmer 2.02 post-processed by RBSfinder (GL2), Glimmer 3.02 (GL3) GeneMarkS (GMK),
ZCURVE 1.0 (ZCV) and EasyGene (EG) on a set of reliable test setsa

GeneMarkS, MED 2.0 demonstrates the highest performance of exact gene prediction for GC-rich genomes. It is
still problematic to evaluate gene prediction for archaeal
genomes due to the insufficient number of genes confirmed by independent (i.e. non-computational) methods
[18]. To this end, we have built the data set SolfGene comprising 56 reliable genes with confirmed TISs. All six programs detect all genes at the 3' end in SolfGene. As for both
ends prediction, both MED 2.0 and EasyGene give the
highest accuracy of 89.3% vs Glimmer 2.02 (post-processed by RBSfinder) (71.4%), Glimmer 3.02 (87.5%),
GeneMarkS (85.7%), and ZCURVE 1.0 (73.2%) (See the
last line in Table 1).
In summary, upon test of the reliable gene sets built for
two well studied genomes E. coli and B. subtilis, we show
that the total prediction performance of MED 2.0 can be
matched with that of GeneMarkS in its publication, and
higher than that of Glimmer, EasyGene and ZCURVE 1.0.
While for the newly analysed genomes, especially for GCrich genomes and Archaea, MED 2.0 shows an evident
advantage, because test on the reliable gene sets clearly
indicates that MED 2.0 has given a higher accuracy than
other five gene finders, at least the same level of the best
one.
Analysis of upstream region of predicted TISs for Archaea
MED 2.0 gives a comprehensive modeling of the TIS for
both bacterial and archaeal genomes, in particular for
archeal genomes in which translation initiation is more
complex than in Bacteria [18]. We report herein the results
using the extended sequence logos [38] for the region [50, -1] upstream from predicted TISs by MED 2.0. The
sequence logos facilitate detection of sequence patterns
that are conserved in both content and position. We
present the logos of three representative archaeal
genomes: M. jannaschii, P. abyssi, and N. equitans in Fig. 2.
The logos indicate that several mechanisms associated
with the translation initiation have been detected by MED
2.0. The genome of M. jannaschii displays the logos with a
remarkable SD signals in region [-12, -4] like Bacteria,
which is well compatible with the notion that this
genome produces nearly no leaderless transcripts [18]. On
the other hand, the N. equitans genome that carries a high
level of genes producing leaderless transcripts [17,18] produces a very rich set of signals. An evident A/T-rich signal,
the so-called box A promoter motif, is observed near the
position -23. In addition, a TFB recognition element
(BRE) motif constituting 2 to 4 A/Ts, which interact with
the archaeal transcription factor TFB, is also recognized
about 4 bps upstream from the box A motif. Furthermore,
an A/T peak is detected near the position -9 to -10
upstream to the TIS, which has been reported being functionally important [18]. Finally, the P. abyssi genome is
found to have a strongly conserved SD signal in -12 to -4

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/97

upstream region together with a rather weak box A motif
upstream from the SD signal. This is well consistent with
the fact that the P. abyssi genome produces fewer leaderless than leadered transcripts [17].
Inspection on the upstream sequence patterns of predicted TISs would be helpful for the assessment of the
overall quality of gene annotation or prediction. Herein
we choose an example, the S. solfataricus genome, for a
detailed comparison between MED 2.0 and other prediction programs, as well as the GenBank annotation. First
we contrast MED 2.0 with GenBank annotation. As we can
calculate from Additional File 1, MED 2.0 detects 2910
genes with common 3' end against GenBank annotation,
among which 2183 genes have common TISs and 727
genes do not (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b shows the logos of the
upstream region [-50, -1] from TISs of the common 2183
genes, where a typical SD signal can be observed at [-12, 4] and an evident box A motif at [-30, -23]. The logos for
the other 727 TISs predicted by MED 2.0 are shown in Fig.
3c, where similar SD signal and box A motif are found,
while those TISs from the GenBank annotation shown in
Fig. 3d show no informational structure in the logos. This
comparison suggests that MED 2.0 can give a more relevant annotation of TIS for archaeal genomes than the current GenBank annotation.
Similar comparison is made with Glimmer 3.02, GeneMarkS and ZCURVE 1.0, as shown in Fig. 4. We have
shown that Glimmer 3.02 has achieved an overall
improvement of TIS prediction than that of its earlier version, thus have no need for the comparison with Glimmer
2.02. The sets of common TIS predictions are slightly different in each case (see Fig. 4a,b and 4c), but in all comparisons the TISs predicted by MED 2.0 show the
sequence logos similar to that in Fig. 3b (Fig. 4d,f and 4h),
while those of Glimmer 3.02 (Fig. 4e), GeneMarkS (Fig.
4g) and of ZCURVE 1.0 (Fig. 4i) show almost no SD signal
or box A motif structures. Thus to a great extent, MED 2.0
makes a substantially more accurate prediction than
Glimmer 3.02, GeneMarkS and ZCURVE 1.0 for archaeal
genomes.

Conclusion
In this paper, we present a comprehensive model to
describe a set of properties about the coding potential and
the translation initiation mechanisms for both Bacteria
and Archaea. Based on the model, with a design of multiple iterations, an non-supervised ab initio gene prediction
system MED 2.0 is developed. Generally speaking, the system is able to adapt to any newly sequenced prokaryotic
genome with no need for any data training or prior
knowledge, and can predict the divergent translation initiation mechanisms and the resulting signals upstream
from the TIS. The model seems to be biologically sound,

since the program yields genome-specific model parameters such as various probabilities associated with the translation initiation signals and the start codon usage, which
are matched with the current knowledge from earlier
works. Thus the model may provide a good tool for comparative genomic studies. Upon test of a set of reliable
gene sets, the total prediction performance of MED 2.0 for
the well studied Bacteria such as E. coli and B. subtilis with

usual GC content can be matched with that of the existing
published methods. While for the newly analysed
genomes, especially for GC-rich genomes and Archaea,
test on the reliable gene sets indicates that MED 2.0 outperforms or at least gives the same level of the best of the
current gene finders in exact gene prediction for both 3'
and 5' end matches. Furthermore, MED 2.0 adapts to a
broad range of archaeal genome as well as to bacterial

(a), GeneMarkS (b) and ZCURVE 1.0 (c), separately. The left side sequence logos are for upstream regions to the TISs predicted by MED2.0 but rejected by Glimmer 3.02 (d), GeneMarkS (f) and ZCURVE 1.0 (h). The right side sequence logos of are
for upstream regions to the TISs predicted by Glimmer 3.02 (e), GeneMarkS (g) and ZCURVE 1.0 (i) but rejected by MED2.0.
The logos of start codon at position 0 to +2 are masked off.

genomes. For archaeal genomes with more complex
mechanisms of translational initiation, our method has a
more accurate prediction of TISs compared to the existing
gene finders and the current GenBank annotation.
As many a prokaryotic gene prediction program, such as
Glimmer, GeneMark and EasyGene, has been widely used
in raw genomic sequence annotation, the predicting performance for a new gene prediction method evaluated by
data extracted from GenBank should be in caution. While
the comparison against the GenBank annotation has
played a role during the early development of the computational prediction programs, this comparison becomes
increasingly suspicious as its bias becomes evident
(towards the programs which are used to create the GenBank annotation file). Therefore the consistency with the
GenBank annotation should not be considered to be the
only factor, and should not even be the essential one for
some archaeal genomes. With hundreds of prokaryotic
genomes have been sequenced and made publicly available, subsequent studies will focus more on the development of the comprehensive model of gene structure that
allow capture of the biological evidence of prokaryotic
genomes, e.g. the translation initiation mechanism, which
is essential to understanding comparative genomics and
biology evolution.
At present the problems of being biased and erroneous
have not yet been solved in the GenBank annotation for
prokaryotes, especially for newly sequenced archaeal
genomes and GC-rich genomes, and the further promotion of comparative genomics, it is hoped that our system
is shown to meet the demand and be qualified as an alternative tool of gene computational prediction. The expert
annotators, who are concerned with more accurate and
complete annotation of sequenced genomes, should find
our method useful when used independently or alongside
with other gene finding tools.
