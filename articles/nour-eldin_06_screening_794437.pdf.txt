Abstract
Background: We have developed a functional genomics approach based on expression cloning in
Xenopus oocytes to identify plant transporter function. We utilized the full-length cDNA databases
to generate a normalized library consisting of 239 full-length Arabidopsis thaliana transporter
cDNAs. The genes were arranged into a 96-well format and optimized for expression in Xenopus
oocytes by cloning each coding sequence into a Xenopus expression vector.
Results: Injection of 96 in vitro transcribed cRNAs from the library in pools of columns and rows
into oocytes and subsequent screening for glucose uptake activity identified three glucose
transporters. One of these, AtSTP13, had not previously been experimentally characterized.
Conclusion: Expression of the library in Xenopus oocytes, combined with uptake assays, has great
potential in assignment of plant transporter function and for identifying membrane transporters for
the many plant metabolites where a transporter has not yet been identified.

Background
Higher plants produce a large number of secondary
metabolites, which are transported between neighbouring
cells or distant organs. For example, in tobacco plants
local de novo synthesis accounts for less than 10% of the
nicotine in aerial parts, while the remainder is transported
from the roots [1]. Similarly, in Arabidopsis thaliana glucosinolates are transported from silique walls into seeds
[2,3]. While many transporters for the major plant primary metabolites have been identified through functional
complementation of yeast and bacteria, very little is
known at the molecular level about transport of natural
products within plants. With the completion of the Arabidopsis genome which presents a complete catalogue of all
genes that may be expressed in the plant, it became apparent that 5–10% of the 25498 predicted proteins represent

transport protein homologues [4]. Putative functions
have been assigned to many of these proteins based on
homology to characterized transporters in Arabidopsis and
other organisms [5-7]. However, although phylogenetic
relationships are useful for predicting structural and
mechanistic properties, experimental evidence is essential
for assigning function. This remains a major challenge for
the majority of predicted transporter proteins in Arabidopsis.
Expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes is a powerful
tool for identifying transporters from higher eukaryotes
(reviewed in [8]). The approach involves isolation of
mRNA from a tissue enriched for the target transporter
and expressing size-fractionated pools of this mRNA in
oocytes in search of the desired uptake activity. A so-called

sib selection in which positive pools are serially divided
and injected into oocytes subsequently identifies the single clone. Xenopus oocytes are due to their low endogenous transport activity and flexible and efficient
translation machinery, particularly suitable for this
approach and could potentially be used to identify transporters of natural products in plants. Indeed, several successful reports exist on functional expression in Xenopus
oocytes of plant transporters from both specific cRNAs
(e.g. [9,10]) and isolated mRNA (e.g. [11,12]. However,
expression cloning in Xenopus oocytes in its classical form
has not been used successfully to isolate transporter
cDNAs from higher plants. Moreover, the classical
approach is highly targeted, as the isolated mRNA population is enriched for a given transporter activity through
various treatments of the selected tissue. Consequently,
the generated pools of cDNAs are not necessarily suitable
for screening for other transport activities. We have developed a functional genomics approach to screen for function of plant transport proteins based on the classical
expression cloning in Xenopus oocytes. We have built a
library of full-length cDNAs of predicted Arabidopsis transporters and cloned the coding sequence (CDS) of each
gene into a Xenopus expression vector. The library allows
generation of defined and normalized cDNA pools in a
reproducible manner. 96 cDNAs from the library were
expressed in Xenopus oocytes and screened for glucose
uptake activity, which identified three glucose transporters.

Results
Development of transporter cDNA library
The Arabidopsis Membrane Protein Library (AMPL)
includes all predicted polytopic Arabidopsis genes (containing 2 or more transmembrane spanning domains)
grouped into families based on sequence homology [4].
We have built a database consisting of all genes categorized as 'organic solute transporters' from the AMPL website. In addition, we selected genes from the category
'Unknown function' which had 10–14 predicted transmembrane segments (TMS), which is the most frequently
occurring number of TMS in secondary transporters [13].
Out of more than 4500 genes listed in the AMPL website,
our criteria identified 464 genes. At the time of search, 342
of these were categorized as organic solute transporters,
and the remaining 122 were not assigned to any family.
239 of the selected AGI codes existed as full-length cDNAs
deposited at either Riken Riken Bioresource Center (BRC)
(226 genes) [14,15] or the Arabidopsis Gene Salk/Stanford/PGEC (SSP) consortium (13 genes) [16] [see Additional file 1]. An estimation based on available Arabidopsis
EST sequences indicates that 320 of the 464 genes identified by our search criteria are expressed. Thus, the 239
genes available as full-length cDNAs constitute almost
75% of expressed transporters categorized as organic sol-

http://www.plantmethods.com/content/2/1/17

ute transporters or as unknowns with 10–14 TMS. According to the present annotations stated on the TAIR, TIGR
and MIPS databases about 10% of the genes in the library
have no known function. Based on literature searches,
15% of the genes have been assigned functions experimentally while the remaining 75% have been assigned
putative functions based on sequence homology to
known genes. A complete list of genes in the library and
their corresponding predicted functions is included as
supplementary information [see Additional file 1].
Screening of transporter cDNA library for glucose uptake
The potential of the transporter cDNA library as a tool for
screening for transport activities was evaluated in a glucose and a sucrose uptake screen. We screened the first 96
cDNAs in the library among which there were several previously characterized glucose and sucrose transporters.
The genes were arranged in a 96 well micro-titer plate format and combined in pools consisting of eight 'row pools'
and twelve 'column pools'. Each pool was subsequently in
vitro transcribed and injected into Xenopus oocytes. Glucose uptake was detected in oocytes expressing row C and
column 5, which suggested that clone C5 was a glucose
transporter (Fig. 1). Expression of the single clone C5 in
oocytes followed by glucose uptake measurements
resulted in a 4–5 times higher uptake activity compared to
row C or column 5 confirming that C5 was a glucose
transporter (Fig. 2). The AGI code for the C5 gene is
At5g26340, which is annotated as a putative Arabidopsis
H+/glucose transporter and has been named AtSTP13
[17]. This transporter was subsequently biochemically
characterized as a high affinity hexose-specific H+ symporter with an expression pattern which strongly correlates with programmed cell death [18]. The generated
pools were also screened for sucrose uptake, but sucrose
uptake could not be detected in any of the 20 pools
(results not shown).
The effect of different UTRs on expression in Xenopus
oocytes
The first screen failed to identify four previously characterized glucose or sucrose transporters (AtSTP1, AtSTP4,
AtSUC1, AtSUC2) [19-21] which were present in the 96
screened genes. The cDNAs obtained from Riken BRC
contain their native untranslated regions (UTRs), which
could interfere with expression in Xenopus oocytes and
thus generate false negative results. We analyzed this possibility by cloning and expressing the CDSs of each of
these four transporters as well as that of AtSTP13 with,
respectively, their native plant UTRs and with Xenopusspecific UTRs. Glucose and sucrose uptake measurements
on oocytes showed that the Xenopus UTRs resulted in a 5–
30 fold increase in uptake activity for the five gene products compared to expression with the native plant UTRs
(Fig. 3).

cDNAs. cRNA of 96 genes transcribed with native plant UTRs were pooled in columns and rows and screened for glucose
uptake in Xenopus oocytes. High glucose uptake was measured in column 5 and row C, which suggests that the marked well
contains a glucose transporter.

Rescreening of transporter cDNA library optimized for
Xenopus expression for glucose uptake
To overcome the interference of plant UTRs with the Xenopus translational machinery the library was optimized for
expression in Xenopus oocytes by cloning the CDS of each
of the 239 genes into the Xenopus expression vector,
pNB1u, by the high-throughput USER™ cloning approach
[22]. The potential of the optimized transporter cDNA

library for high-throughput screening for target uptake
activities was evaluated in a re-screen for glucose uptake of
the same 96 cDNAs that were screened above. Glucose
uptake could now be detected in oocytes expressing pools
of cRNA from row A, C and E and from column 4, 5 and
7, which suggested that clones A4, A5, A7, C4, C5, C7, E4,
E5 and/or E7 were glucose transporters (Fig. 4). Subsequent, expression of these clones in oocytes followed by

glucose uptake measurements identified A7 (At3g19930,
AtSTP4), C5 (At5g26340, AtSTP13), and E4 (At1g11260,

Discussion
With the aim of creating a targeted functional genomics
approach for assigning function to plant transporters, we

http://www.plantmethods.com/content/2/1/17

have taken advantage of post-genomic tools including
predictive genome annotations and full-length cDNA
databases [23] to construct a normalized library of fulllength Arabidopsis transporter cDNAs which has been optimized for expression in Xenopus oocytes. Storage of the
cDNAs in a 96-well format enables us to pool the cDNAs
in rows and columns and rapidly screen the entire library
for uptake activity of a given compound. As a proof of
concept, 96 cDNAs, which were known to include two
previously characterized glucose transporters, AtSTP1 and
AtSTP4, were screened for glucose uptake activity. While
none of the positive control pools showed detectable glucose uptake, the screen identified AtSTP13 as a putative
glucose transporter. As cDNAs acquired from Riken BRC
contain their native plant 5' and 3' UTRs, it was expected
that incompatibility between the plant UTRs and the
Xenopus translation machinery would create false negative
result. For the glucose transporters AtSTP1, AtSTP4 and
AtSTP13, as well as the sucrose transporters AtSUC1 and
AtSUC2, we confirmed that transcripts containing Xenopus
β-globin gene UTRs [24] resulted in much higher levels of
glucose or sucrose uptake than transcripts with native
plant UTRs (Fig. 3), this has previously been shown for
e.g. the Arabidopsis potassium channel KAT1 [25]. This
indicated that although the constructed transporter
library containing the native plant UTRs successfully identified AtSTP13 as a glucose transporter, it would not be
optimal for an efficient screen in Xenopus oocytes. When
we optimized the transporter library for expression in
Xenopus oocytes by cloning each CDS into a Xenopus
expression vector and thus replaced the native plant UTRs

functioned as negative controls for endogenous glucose or sucrose uptake by oocytes. Assays were performed with 15 μM
radio labelled glucose or sucrose (~100 μCi/μmol).

with Xenopus specific UTRs, the rate of false negative for
the screen was reduced significantly as all genes annotated
as glucose transporters among the screened 96 genes were
now identified. Two other genes among the 96 are annotated as 'sugar transporters', but are only distantly related
to the STP family which are the only characterized members of this large transporter family.
Our transporter library is expected to provide a useful tool
for assignment of function to plant transporters by expression cloning in Xenopus oocytes. The approach has several

advantages compared to previously described Xenopus
oocyte expression cloning approaches. One strength of
the approach lies in the normalized nature of the library.
The individual handling and combination possibilities in
columns and rows of cDNAs representing more than a
hundred different Arabidopsis tissues ensure equal representation of weakly and strongly expressed transporters.
Consequently, this permits screening for activity of weakly
expressed transporters or transporters only expressed
under certain conditions, without the need for isolation of
RNA from enriched tissue. Furthermore, the selection of

Plant Methods 2006, 2:17

only a subgroup of genes, in the present study consisting
of organic solute co-transporters and unknowns with 10–
14 TMS, provides a library which is less likely to contain
possible deleterious plant genes that might affect oocyte
health. In addition, the exchange of native plant UTRs
with Xenopus-specific UTRs reduces the risk of false negative results due to a possible incompatibility between the
plant UTR and the Xenopus translational machinery.
Finally, the in vitro transcribed pools of cRNAs can be used
repeatedly in screens for transporters, provided that the
desired transport activity is dependent on a single
polypeptide and that the substrate is not toxic to the Xenopus oocytes. The type of transporters that can be identified
is defined by the assays that can be performed. Simple
uptake assays require a sensitive detection system to show
uptake of the desired compound in to the oocytes. In this
study, we performed uptake assays with a radioactively
labelled glucose isotope. While this type of assay is very
rapid and sensitive, it is limited by the availability of radiolabelled compounds. Other detection methods include
LC-MS (liquid chromatography mass spectrometry),
which is more laborious with respect to recovery of the
compound from the oocytes, but poses far less limitations
with regards to compound availability. Alternatively, electrophysiological measurements could be employed to
detect transport of a given compound, provided the transport process is electrogenic. The screen is restricted to
those transporters that fulfill the search criteria mentioned earlier as well as by the availability of full-length
cDNAs. We expect to continuously expand the library
with full-length transporter cDNAs as they become
released, and eventually to saturate the library with all
expressed secondary transporters in Arabidopsis. The
library will be available to the scientific community
through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center [26].

Methods
Acquisition of Arabidopsis full-length transporter cDNA
library
Genes were selected from the Arabidopsis Membrane Protein Library (AMPL) database [27]. Available full-length
cDNAs were obtained from databases of the Riken BRC
Experimental Plant Division [28] and the Arabidopsis Gene
Salk/Stanford/PGEC (SSP) Consortium [29]. cDNAs
obtained from Riken BRC contained a full-length CDS
surrounded by its specific plant UTR inserted into either
the RAFL4-6 or RAFL7-11 vector [30]. cDNAs obtained
from the SSP consortium contained only a CDS inserted
into the Uni-vector [31]. The full-length cDNAs obtained
from Riken BRC and SSP Consortium databases are
derived from over hundred different Arabidopsis thaliana L.
tissues and treatments [15].

AtSUC2 into the Xenopus expression vector, pNB1
The CDSs were PCR-amplified with CDS-specific primers
from, respectively, pda05545, pda01560, pda03530,
pda04389 and pda04574 plasmids from Riken.

Conclusion
We have combined post-genomic bioinformatics tools
with Xenopus expression cloning and developed a functional genomics approach for identification of plant transporter functions. Screening of the normalized transporter
library in pools is expected to enable identification of
transporters for the many plant metabolites where a transporter has not yet been identified. Similar libraries can be
constructed for other types of membrane proteins such as
ion channels and receptors from any organism for which
full-length cDNA databases exist. The approach has great
potential for assignment of protein function, which is the
next major challenge after the completion of genome
sequences.

Each primer set introduced an XmaI and an EcoRI restriction site (underlined) upstream and downstream of each
CDS, except for AtSTP13 where the reverse primer introduced a BglII site. Standard PCR was performed with Pwo
DNA polymerase (Roche) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The PCR products were digested and ligated
into a similarly digested Xenopus expression vector, pNB1
[32]. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

Subcloning of transporter cDNA library into pNB1u
The CDSs of 239 individual cDNAs were directionally
transferred into the USER™ compatible Xenopus expression vector pNB1u vector [22] by the improved highthroughput USER™ cloning technique [22]. pNB1u contains the 5' and 3' end UTRs of the endogenous Xenopus βglobin gene and has a T7 promoter situated upstream of
the 5' UTR. pNB1u was prepared for cloning as described
previously [22]. Briefly, 5 μg plasmid were digested with
60 U PacI (NEB) overnight at 37°C in a total volume of
200 μl. 20 U of Nt.BbvCI (NEB) and additional 20 U PacI
were added the next day, and the digestion was incubated
for 1 h at 37°C. The linearized vector was purified with
the Qiagen PCR purification kit and eluted with water.
The concentration was adjusted to 10 ng/μl.

Each CDS was cloned into the pNB1u vector by PCR
amplification from their respective pdaxxxxx plasmids
(Riken BRC) using 0.5 U of PfuTurbo® Cx Hotstart DNA
Polymerase (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's
instructions with 30 extension-cycles.
Sequence of forward primers: 5'-ggcttaaU-gene specific
sequence-3'.
Sequence of reverse primers: 5'-ggtttaaU-gene specific
sequence-3'.
Tables that include the name of each gene and their corresponding Riken accession number and the sequence of all
primers used to amplify the genes in the library are
included in Supplementary information [see Additional
file 2]. All primers were ordered from Invitrogen. PCR
amplification was verified by gel electrophoresis: the PCR
product was mixed with 0.75 U of USER™ reagent (NEB)
and 1 μl linearized pNB1u vector at a volume ratio of 10:1
PCR product to vector. The intensity of the ethidium bromide-stained band on an agaorose gel was used to estimate the concentration of the PCR product. The mixtures
were incubated for 20 min at 37°C and for 20 min at
25°C, and used to transform standard heat-shock competent E. coli cells. Positive colonies were identified by PCR
on colonies using a vector specific primer (T7 promoter
sequence) and the insert specific 3' end primer. To clone
the entire library we performed two rounds of cloning. In
the first round, 225 of the 239 Riken clones were successfully amplified by the ordered primers. Two colonies per
plate were initially tested by PCR on colonies. For 193
clones both colonies gave the correct fragment, while 23
only gave a correct fragment in one of the tested colonies
giving a total of 216 successful cloning events. Each clone
was verified by sequencing and in average one out of ten
clones had a PCR error which prompted picking a new
colony from the plates for sequencing. In the second
round of cloning we re-amplified the 23 clones which had

http://www.plantmethods.com/content/2/1/17

not been successfully amplified in the first round with
new primers and cloned them anew. All 23 were successfully re-amplified and were verified as described above.
Preparation of cRNA for injection into Xenopus oocytes
Linearized DNA templates from circular plasmids for
cRNA synthesis were prepared by PCR [33]. Four primer
sets were used depending on the type of cDNA plasmid.
One set was used for cDNAs in the Uni-vectors from the
SSP consortium, two sets for cDNAs in the two RAFL vectors from Riken BRC, and one set for the CDSs in the
pNB1u vector.

PCR was performed with the Phusion™ High-Fidelity
DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes) according to manufacturer's instructions with 30 cycles. The PCR products were
purified using MultiScreen PCRμ96 filter plates (Millipore). The concentration was normalized to 0.2 μg/μl.
Each PCR product was subsequently in vitro transcribed as
described previously [34]. Briefly, 5 μg of each PCR product was added to the following mixture: 1 × T7 transcription buffer (Fermentas), 10 mM DTT, 250 μg/ml bovine
serum albumen, 1 mM rATP, 1 mM rUTP, 1 mM rCTP,
0.05 mM rGTP (Illumina), 80 U T7 RNA polymerase (Fermentas), 20 U Ribolock™ RNAse (Fermentas), 0.01 U
inorganic pyrophosphatase (Fermentas), 0.06 U 3'-OMe7 mG(5')ppp(5')G RNA cap structure analogue (NEB) in
a 50 μl reaction volume. The reaction was incubated at
37°C for 30 min, after which additional rGTP was added

bringing the concentration of rGTP to 1 mM. The reaction
was incubated at 37°C for 3–4 h and the RNA recovered
by LiCl precipitation. 100 μl ice-cold 7.5 M LiCl, 50 mM
EDTA pH 8 was added and the mixture incubated at 20°C overnight, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 g
for 15 min. The pellet was washed with 1 ml 70 % (v/v)
ethanol, air-dried and resuspended in 10–20 μl nucleasefree water. The protocol consistently yielded approximately 40 μg RNA. The concentration of each RNA elution
was adjusted to 1 μg/μl. The contents of each row and column were pooled, respectively. This resulted in 20 pools,
each containing 8 or 12 cRNAs.

Oocyte preparation and uptake assays
Oocytes were prepared as described previously [8] and
injected with 50 ng cRNA. The oocytes were incubated for
2–3 d at 17–18°C before measuring transporter activity.

Uptake assays were performed in the saline buffer, Kulori
(90 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5
mM MES, pH 5), and each assay contained nine oocytes.
Reaction volume was 0.5 ml and contained 1 μCi
[14C]glucose (303 μCi/μmol; Amersham) or [14C]sucrose
(580 μCi/μmol; Amersham). The final concentration of
glucose and sucrose was adjusted to 15 μM by addition of
unlabelled glucose or sucrose. Oocytes were pre-incubated in Kulori for 5 min to ensure intracellular steady
state pH [11]. Assays were stopped after 30 min by washing the oocytes four times in ice cold Kulori buffer.
Oocytes were subsequently disrupted in 100 μl 10% SDS
in 3 ml scintillation tubes. An aliquot (2.5 ml) EcoScint™
scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics) was added and
radioactivity quantified by liquid scintillation counting.
