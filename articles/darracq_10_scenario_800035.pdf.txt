A scenario of mitochondrial genome evolution
in maize based on rearrangement events
Aude Darracq1,2,3, Jean-Stéphane Varré2,3, Pascal Touzet1*

Abstract
Background: Despite their monophyletic origin, animal and plant mitochondrial genomes have been described as
exhibiting different modes of evolution. Indeed, plant mitochondrial genomes feature a larger size, a lower
mutation rate and more rearrangements than their animal counterparts. Gene order variation in animal
mitochondrial genomes is often described as being due to translocation and inversion events, but tandem
duplication followed by loss has also been proposed as an alternative process. In plant mitochondrial genomes, at
the species level, gene shuffling and duplicate occurrence are such that no clear phylogeny has ever been
identified, when considering genome structure variation.
Results: In this study we analyzed the whole sequences of eight mitochondrial genomes from maize and teosintes
in order to comprehend the events that led to their structural features, i.e. the order of genes, tRNAs, rRNAs, ORFs,
pseudogenes and non-coding sequences shared by all mitogenomes and duplicate occurrences. We suggest a
tandem duplication model similar to the one described in animals, except that some duplicates can remain. This
model enabled us to develop a manual method to deal with duplicates, a recurrent problem in rearrangement
analyses. The phylogenetic tree exclusively based on rearrangement and duplication events is congruent with the
tree based on sequence polymorphism, validating our evolution model.
Conclusions: This study suggests more similarity than usually reported between plant and animal mitochondrial
genomes in their mode of evolution. Further work will consist of developing new tools in order to automatically
look for signatures of tandem duplication events in other plant mitogenomes and evaluate the occurrence of this
process on a larger scale.

Background
All organelle genomes found in mitochondria of plant
or animal cells are considered to have originated from
an endosymbiotic form of a-Proteobacteria, and given
rise to the emerging eukaryotic cell more than 109 years
ago [1]. Despite their monophyletic origin, animal and
plant mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) exhibit
contrasted features, when considering size, compactness,
mutation rate and gene-order variation [2]. Most animal
mitogenomes are circular and compact, share the same
gene content and have a size that does not exceed 20
kb. The high nucleotide mutation rate of their coding
sequences has been commonly used in population
genetic and phylogenetic studies [3]. However, in taxonomic studies, the introduction of gene-order variation

to resolve specific nodes has proved to be a powerful
tool [4]. In these animal rearranged mitogenomes, most
gene rearrangements were due to inversions and translocations. But duplication events were also identified: in
some cases, they were distant in the genomes, with or
without loss of parts of the duplicated fragment [5]. In
other cases, duplications occurred in tandem repeat and
were followed either by non-random duplicate loss
(cases of genes conserved side by side in the same orientation [6,7]) or by random loss (known as TDRL, Tandem Duplication with Random Loss) [8-10]. In most
cases, when duplication involved a protein coding gene,
only one functional copy remained.
In contrast, plant mitogenomes exhibit larger size
(most are from 200 to 700 kb) and are less compact
than their animal counterparts due to the occurrence of
non-coding sequences and duplicated fragments. Moreover, plant mitogenomes are known to evolve rapidly in

structure and slowly in sequence [11]. The occurrence
of large repeated sequences has led to the idea of a
complex genome, composed of alternative master chromosomes and sub-genomic molecules due to intragenomic recombination [12], even though whole
sequenced genomes are usually represented as circular
master circles [13,14]. At the intra-specific level, recombination through small repeat sequences is believed to
be responsible for large gene-order shuffling and the
emergence of new open reading frames, some of which
have been involved in Cytoplasmic Male Sterility (CMS)
[14,15]. In this context, the acquisition of whole
sequence data for several mitogenomes found in a species opens new venues toward a better understanding of
the evolutionary dynamics of this peculiar genome, especially when focusing on its high structural rearrangement rate and the origin of duplicated fragments.
The comparison of whole genomes using gene order
has been an active field of research since the early
1990s. The first methods focused on the study of the
minimal number of rearrangement events, mostly inversions, to go from one genome to another [16,17]. The
resulting scenario could be seen as a putative evolutionary scenario. Phylogenetic reconstruction methods based
on rearrangement events have also been proposed in
order to compute scenarios and putative ancestors for a
set of genomes [18,19]. Methods to study rearrangements that take duplicates into account have been investigated over the past decade. Since most of the
mathematical models used to compute rearrangement
distances and scenarios are based on the assumption
that each gene or synteny block appears exactly once in
each genome, methods designed for genomes without
duplicates cannot be applied directly to plant mitochondrial genomes. One possible approach consists in keeping only one of the duplicates and removing the others
from the genomes in order to obtain a dataset with one
copy of each gene per genome [20,21]. The drawback of
this solution is its high combinatorics if the number of
duplicates is large. Moreover it does not provide any
kind of explanation about duplication events. Other
methods focus on the study of gene families, i.e. the
evolutionary history of a gene and its duplicates [22].
The aim of these methods is to find the duplication
events within a given phylogenetic tree. It follows that
currently no method is able to reconstruct a rearrangement phylogenetic tree of genomes with duplicates.
Therefore the ‘manual approach’ has to be used for
resolving this type of evolutionary history [23].
Recently, Allen and colleagues [24] reported the whole
sequencing of 5 mitogenomes in maize. As expected,
the mitogenomes exhibited a large variation in size
(from 535 to 740 kb) due mainly to large duplicated
fragments, and gene shuffling was such that no clear

Page 2 of 16

evolutionary scenario could be pictured. However, on
the basis of nucleotide divergence, groups of related
mitogenomes could be defined and qualified as ancestral
or derived though no phylogeny could be established. In
the present study, we added three newly available whole
mitogenome sequences of teosintes, species that are
relatives of maize, to the five mitogenomes studied by
Allen and colleagues [24] in order to conduct a phylogenetic analysis and ultimately comprehend the events that
led to their structural features: sequence order and
duplicates.
The analysis based on sequence polymorphism among
the eight mitogenomes enabled us to build a robust
reference tree for subsequent analyses solely based on
genome structure information (sequence-order). We
showed that mitogenome rearrangements could result
from a mechanism similar to that found in animals, i.e.
tandem duplication, but where some duplicates were
partially lost. Using this evolution model, we developed
a methodology to reconstruct a phylogeny based on
rearrangement events that integrated most duplicates,
and ended up with an evolutionary scenario of the mitochondrial genome in maize.

Results
Genome duplications

The analysis of maize and teosinte mitogenomes
revealed the occurrence of duplications. Duplication
length varied from 0.54 kbp to 120 kbp (Table 1). Duplicated fragments were an important part of the total genome length for the longest genomes, 23.4% for NA,
31.5% for CMS-C and 21.2% for Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, and more generally were the main cause of size differences among maize mitogenomes [24]. Six duplicated
fragments were shared between maize [24] and Zea
mays ssp. parviglumis mitogenomes : {NA, NB, CMS-C,
CMS-S and Zea mays ssp. parviglumis} shared two
duplications (11 and 17 kbp), {NA, NB, CMS-S and Zea
mays ssp. parviglumis} a 0.7 kbp duplication, {NA,
CMS-S, CMS-T and Zea mays ssp. parviglumis} a 5.3
kbp duplication, {NA, NB and Zea mays ssp. parviglumis} another 5.3 kbp duplication and {NA and Zea
mays ssp. parviglumis} a 0.6 kbp duplication.
NA seemed to have a fragment duplicated in tandem,
the two copies of its 120 kbp fragment were separated
by only 9.3 kbp.

mitogenomes, coding genes (including duplicated genes)
represented 7.83 to 8.60% (median = 8.37%) of the total
genome length whereas backbone DNA sequences
represented 56.49 to 77.99% (median = 73.29%) of the
total genome length (Table 2).
In all, there were 115 orthologous fragments over all
mitogenomes (see Additional file 1). The smallest common fragment size was 94 bp and the largest was
around 18,769 bp (median of 2,379 bp). Differences in
size between orthologous fragments were due to indels
(insertions and deletions). For each mitogenome, backbone sequence size was around 418 kbp, except for Zea
luxurians with a size of 415 kbp. The multiple alignment length of the eight mitogenome backbones was
421,163 bp (counting gaps). Backbone repartition over
Zea mitogenomes is given in Figure 1. We computed
the gap sizes in the mitogenome sequences from the
multiple alignment. Most of the gaps were 5 bp long as
previously described by Allen and colleagues [24] and
the insertions were small repetitions (data not shown).
Compared to the other mitogenomes, Zea luxurians had
more gaps longer than 5 bp. This mainly explains the
backbone length difference between Zea luxurians and
the other mitogenomes.

Genome structure sequence

The Genome Structure Sequence (GSS) is a block
sequence characteristic of each mitogenome. It is built
with block markers- which we hereafter call synteny
anchors- that are common to all eight mitogenomes.
Synteny anchors are composed of protein coding genes,
tRNAs, rRNAs, ORFs, pseudogenes and non-coding
sequences from the backbone DNA sequences (see
Methods). Before paralog identification and synteny
anchor collapsing (’bpisac’), GSSs contained 69 synteny
anchors. They represented 69.99 to 74.21% of mitogenome lengths (median = 72.88%) (Table 2). Figure 1 provides a schematic view of GSS bpisac repartition over
mitogenomes and shows that GSS bpisac uniformly covers all mitogenomes. It must be noted that in GSS, the
numbers of synteny anchors correspond to one or more
mitogenome markers: when they were systematically
located together and in the same order in all eight mitogenomes, they were grouped into a single synteny
anchor (see Additional file 2). Consequently there were
69 synteny anchors corresponding to 187 markers common to all mitogenomes. Synteny anchors contained
from 1 (e.g. synteny anchor number 1) to 15 markers
(e.g. synteny anchor number 59). As is generally the

mitogenome, a pair of box sequences is represented : the backbone DNA sequence (BB) and the genome structure sequence before paralog
identification and synteny anchor collapsing (GSS bpisac). Each box is either a Backbone DNA fragment for BB, or a synteny anchor for GSS
bpisac. Boxes with the same number are homologous synteny anchors. The numbering of boxes was chosen according to Zea mays ssp. mays
NA. Thus on BB and GSS bpisac, a box is drawn on the left side if it has the same orientation than its homolog in NA, on the right side
otherwise. For each mitogenome, thick lines represent duplicated regions.

case in mitochondrial genomes, markers that were systematically grouped in our 8 mitogenomes were not
composed of genes involved in the same metabolic pathway. Duplicated synteny anchors represented a large
part of mitogenomes, particularly in NA, CMS-C and
Zea mays ssp. parviglumis: 26.4% of the synteny anchors
were duplicated in NA, 12.6% in NB, 36.8% in CMS-C,
12.6% in CMS-S, 2.3% in CMS-T, 20.7% in Zea mays
ssp. parviglumis, and 9.2% in Zea luxurians and 10.34%
in Zea perennis.
Using GSSs bpisac and assuming that tandem duplication was the underlying mechanism, we observed that
most of the duplicated synteny anchors were indeed
located in regions that could result from tandem duplication events. The fact that two regions did not share
exactly the same synteny anchor content suggested deletion events of some duplicates after duplication. We
called this mechanism Tandem Duplication with Partial
Loss (TDPL). A hypothesis of TDPL in Zea mays ssp.
parviglumis is shown in Figure 2.
Following the method described in Figure 3 and
Methods (paralog identification and gene collapsing),
GSS was obtained for each mitogenome, where duplicates were distinguished and/or collapsed. We identified
4 TDPLs specific to a mitogenome (one in NA, two in
CMS-C and one in Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) where
the two duplicates were still side by side, 2 TDPLs
shared by some mitogenomes (one shared by all mitogenomes and the other by maize mitogenomes) where
the two duplicates were physically separated and 4 tandem duplications specific to a mitogenome and where
the copies were physically separated (CMS-S, CMS-T,
Zea luxurians and Zea perennis). For these duplications,

Page 5 of 16

we hypothesized that the duplicates (originally in
tandem) had been separated by rearrangement events
after duplication. In the end, GSSs contained 72 blocks:
the 69 original synteny anchors, minus 5 that
were eliminated because orthologs and paralogs could
not be distinguished, plus 8 additional blocks after paralog/ortholog identification. Transformation from GSS
bpisac to GSS for CMS-C and Zea perennis is shown
in Figure 4.
Sequence phylogeny

Bootstrap values (upper values in Figure 5.A.) indicated
that the topology of the tree was relatively robust (from
94-99%) with some uncertainty regarding the separation
between CMS-C and the remaining three Zea mays
mitogenomes (74%). The Maximum Likelihood (ML)
phylogenetic tree had the same topology as the NJ phylogenetic tree and bootstrap values (lower values in Figure 5.B.) were higher for all nodes. Molecular clock with
ML was rejected (p < 0.0001).
We also constructed a phylogenetic tree with concatenated protein coding gene sequences which exhibited
the same topology as the one from the backbone
sequence but with shorter branch lengths (data not
shown).
Rearrangement phylogeny

Phylogenetic analysis was based on rearrangement using
GSSs. The phylogenetic tree was congruent with the
one from backbone DNA sequence. Jackknife values
were 96.1%, 99.5%, 79.6%, 100% and 100% for the five
most terminal nodes (Figure 5.B). Tests were performed
with different percentages of synteny anchors kept in

the jackknife computation (see Additional file 3). When
30 to 90% of the synteny anchors were kept, the main
tree was congruent with the sequence tree.
We built a phylogenetic tree with a data set excluding
blocks containing duplicated synteny anchors. It is noteworthy that the resulting tree was not congruent with
the sequence tree. This highlights the importance of taking into account duplication events in the analysis.
Moreover, when we deleted all copies of each duplicated
synteny anchors, the data set went down from 72 to 28
synteny anchors.
Mitogenome rearrangement evolution

A parsimonious tree was constructed using MGR (Multiple Genome Rearrangements) with GSSs. This method
has the advantage of providing a potential ancestral
sequence at each node (A1 to A5) (Figure 6).
It was possible to reintroduce duplication events in
the MGR tree. Indeed, duplication of synteny anchors {8
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18} can be put on the NA
branch, duplication of synteny anchors {5 6 7 66 67 63
29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 -10 -9 -8 12 13 14 15 16
17 18}and {69 1 -11 3 4} on the CMS-C branch and
duplication of synteny anchors {-34 -33 -32 -31 63 64
65 -11 -10 -9 -8 12 13 14 15 16 17 18} on the Zea mays
ssp. parviglumis branch. These duplication events were
followed by synteny anchor loss and inversions (as
described in Figures 2 and 3). It was then possible to
obtain a parsimonious evolutionary history of all eight
mitogenomes. Likely events were positioned on each

branch of the tree where (I) denotes an inversion, (TD)
a tandem duplication, (TDPL) a tandem duplication
with partial loss and (L) a loss. In Figure 7, an example
of an evolutionary scenario is given from A5 to Zea
mays ssp. parviglumis and NA.
It must be noted that some rearrangement events
need not occur in an absolute order except for overlapping inversions, TDPLs and the last inversion in CMS-C
and Zea mays ssp. parviglumis. It appears that overlapping inversions must be chronologically oriented in the
evolution history: for example, from A5 to Zea mays
ssp. parviglumis, inversion I{-31:-59} has to occur before
inversion I{47:-3}. However, non-overlapping inversions
can be permuted: for example, I{-20b:-20a} can occur
either before or after I{-31:-59}. Two duplications have
an ancestral position: TD{20:22} is ancestral to maize
and teosinte mitogenomes and TD{27} is specific to
maize mitogenomes (Figure 6). Over time, the duplicates
were separated.
It is important to note that scenarios for all mitogenomes, computed by MGR, were consistent with rearrangement sites (i.e. breakpoint regions) observed at the
sequence level by Allen and colleagues [24]. Indeed,
many rearrangements predicted by MGR occurred
between the second copies of synteny anchors 20 and
21 (trnN and orf99 in the region 140 kbp of NB); we
also found rearrangement points near synteny anchors
4, 7, 9 and 18 (respectively cob, nad2 exon 1, rbcL and
cox1 genes) whereas we did not find any rearrangements
between synteny anchors 27 (first copy) and 21 (second

and Zea perennis mitogenomes. In CMS-C, dashed lines between GSS bpisac and GSS indicate the condensation of tandem duplicated synteny
anchors (after the “collapsing” step). Vertical lines indicate each duplicated part. In CMS-C GSS, synteny anchors 35a and 35b are virtually added
compared to GSS bpisac because synteny anchor 35 is duplicated in Zea perennis GSS bpisac and it is possible to distinguish them with their
neighborhood. Conversely, 27 virtually duplicated (i.e. 27a and 27b are left side by side) in Zea perennis GSS is in two distinct copies in CMS-C
GSS. For synteny anchor 40 duplicated in Zea perennis GSS bpisac, ortholog and paralog cannot be distinguished with their neighborhood.
Consequently, synteny anchor 60, 61, 62 and 2 are deleted in GSS for all mitogenomes. Synteny anchors 27, 27a, 27b, 35, 35a and 35b are
indicated by arrows. We applied the following color code: orange for deleted blocks, green for blocks for which paralogous from orthologous
were distinguished, blue for tandemly duplicated blocks: dark blue when duplicates were conserved, light blue when one copy was lost.

Discussion
We analyzed the evolution of mitochondrial genome
structure within a plant species by concomitantly building a phylogenetic tree based on sequence polymorphism and a phylogenetic tree based on structural
rearrangements among genomes. Both trees were congruent, suggesting that both sources of polymorphism
are correlated, i.e. the more divergent a genome is, the
more rearranged it is. Therefore it was possible to
reconstruct an evolutionary scenario, suggest ancestral
genome structures along the different nodes of the tree,
and pinpoint tandem duplication as a possible

Methodology to deal with duplicates

From a methodological point of view, dealing with
duplicates together with rearrangement events is a
challenge. If one was able to distinguish between paralogous and orthologous synteny anchors, the problem
would be reduced to the study of rearrangements with
exactly one copy of each synteny anchor in each genome. Unfortunately, finding paralogous synteny
anchors is usually a very difficult task (this is especially
the case with the data analyzed here since mitochondrial synteny anchor duplicates are identical in most
cases). Even if one was able to distinguish them, it

proportional to the number of rearrangement events (inversion, duplications, deletions). An Ancestral sequence is given for each node (A1 to

remains that some duplicates are specific to a given
genome or to a subset of genomes. Different methods
have been proposed to deal with such datasets. In the
exemplar model [20], only one copy of each duplicate
is kept. In the maximum matching model [25], one
keeps as many copies as the minimum number of
copies of one duplicate found in a genome. The choice
of which copy to keep is made according to an optimization function. For genome rearrangement purposes,
this function consists in choosing the copies that minimize the evolutionary distance between two genomes.
But such methods can be applied only if the number of
duplicates remains small, otherwise the number of
reduced genomes is too large. This is the case with our
data. The exemplar genome approach would have led
us to explore more than 16 million datasets from our
eight mitogenomes. In the special case of tandem
duplications, a method was previously described with
random loss (TDRL) [26]. Unfortunately, in that model
exactly one of each duplicate is immediately lost just
after the duplication event, and the method proposed
cannot be adapted because the underlying algorithms
require that each marker synteny anchor be present
only once in each genome.
Therefore we proposed a framework to analyze the
rearrangement history of a set of genomes containing
duplicates. In this framework we assumed that most of
the duplicates came from tandem duplication events
and that rearrangements occurring within a duplicated
segment were independent from the other rearrangement events. Although this is not necessarily true in the
general case, we found evidence of tandem duplication
in parts of the genome. These hypotheses provided a
means to deal with duplications and to allow us to propose both a scenario of rearrangements and a history of
duplication events. We thus elaborated a four step
method to account for duplicates. In short, we

concealed duplicates to compute rearrangement scenarios and then we reintroduced them. The method was
the following : i) identify TDPLs and collapse them in
order to keep one copy of each synteny anchor, ii) distinguish between paralogs and orthologs for remaining
duplicated synteny anchors, iii) apply the usual rearrangement algorithms (since no duplicate remains), iv)
expand the previously collapsed TDPLs in step i) to
recreate the TDPL event. The main difficulty of the first
step is to correctly determine the boundary of the duplicated segment. We saw that using the information of
the synteny anchor neighborhood shared by the genomes could help determine these boundaries (see Methods and Additional files 4). The second step proved to
be more difficult since we had to deal with the problem
of ortholog versus paralog identification. We supposed
that the number of duplicated blocks involved in a
TDPL but far apart from each other was rather limited
and that the methods described above could thus be
used. In this last case, though, the neighborhood could
help distinguish between both duplicates (such as block
27 in the dataset). When the duplicates were not in tandem, we added the duplicated block in tandem with its
counterpart in genomes in which it was missing because
the block content had to be the same for the third step
of the method. This did not change the distances
among genomes nor did it modify scenarios. Indeed,
adding the duplicated block next to its counterpart created an adjacency that was implicitly conserved when
computing parsimonious scenarios. The last step consisted of replacing the collapsed TDPLs by their original
block sequences. The duplication events were placed on
the tree depending on whether TDPL was shared by
several genomes or not. If the TDPL was specific to one
genome, the duplication event necessarily occurred after
the last speciation event. If a TDPL was shared by two
or more genomes, the most parsimonious hypothesis

was that the duplication event occurred just before the
speciation event.
Phylogenetic relationships among Zea mitochondrial
genomes

The phylogenetic relationships among maize mitogenomes concord with a former study by Allen and colleagues [24] where NA and NB were described as being
the most-closely related mitogenomes, followed by
CMS-C, CMS-S and CMS-T. On the basis of their
nucleotide divergence, CMS-S and CMS-T were suggested to be the oldest cytoplasms. The introduction of
two additional mitogenomes from the outgroup species
of teosintes Zea luxurians and Zea perennis also suggested the ancestral position of CMS-S and T. Former
studies on mitochondrial and chloroplastic diversity in
Zea pointed out the fact that CMS-S was an old cytoplasm and most likely the result of introgression from
teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana. But the phylogenetic
location of CMS-T, due to a strong nucleotide divergence and a concomitant rearranged genome, is puzzling since CMS-T shares the same co-inherited
chloroplastic genome with CMS-C and NB [27,28]. Consequently, the high divergence of CMS-T might not
have occurred in a molecular clock tempo (as suggested
by the rejection of the molecular clock hypothesis in the
phylogenetic analysis). Chloroplastic sequence data
could shed light on the relative ages of the cytoplasms
studied. It is interesting to note that the same phenomenon was observed when considering the chloroplastic
nucleotide diversity among several cytoplasms of wild
beet: cytoplasm Nv and CMS Owen are closely related
when considering chloroplastic nucleotide divergence
[29] while mitochondrial genomes are highly rearranged
and exhibit about 8% of specific sequences [30].
The phylogenetic location of Zea mays ssp. parviglumis included in the Zea mays clade concords with the
scenario of a recent maize domestication from this teosinte subspecies [31]. Moreover, it highly suggests that
the cytoplasms we studied differentiated before
domestication.
Tandem duplication with partial loss as a plausible
mechanism

Tandem duplication is a mechanism that has been
demonstrated or at least suggested in mitochondrial
genomes of several animal species, even though the
underlying molecular mechanism is not always understood [32,33]. Tandem duplications have been mainly
observed in Chordata, particularly in Vertebrates such
as Lizards [33], Salamanders [9], Amphibians [34] or
Gulper Eels [8]. Cases of tandem duplication are not
restricted to Chordata, they have also been reported in

Page 11 of 16

Echinodermata [10], Insecta [35] and Lophotrochozoa
(e.g. Mollusca) [36-38]. It must be noted that different
types of tandem duplication have been observed in all
these species: duplications of the whole genome, tandem
duplications of genome parts, tandem duplications of
non-coding regions or tandem duplications of one gene.
In most cases, only one functional copy of the duplicates
remains after duplication.
Mitochondrial genomes of maize and teosintes (Zea
mays ssp. parviglumis, Zea luxurians and Zea perennis)
could undergo the same mechanism of tandem duplication with loss as animal mitochondrial genomes. A possible mechanism could rely on the integration in the
master chromosome of minicircles generated by homologous recombination between direct repeats from the
original master circle, resulting in a duplication event
[39]. But this would imply a preferential adjacent integration (see discussion by Fujita and colleagues [33] for
animals). The low substitution rate in the maize mitogenome may explain why, in maize mitogenomes, one
or more copies of duplicated synteny anchors remain, as
opposed to animal mitogenomes where all gene copies
but one are lost. More generally, a causal link has been
suggested between mutation rate and genome compactness that could explain the large size and gene duplicate
occurrence of plant mitochondrial genomes when compared with their animal counterparts [2]. The fact that
the same mechanism could be involved in mitochondrial
genomes of plants and animals falls in line with the
monophyletic origin of animal and plant mitochondrial
genomes [1]. For example, red algae [40], that form an
independent lineage that radiated contemporarily with
the other evolved eukaryotic lineages, demonstrates
characteristics of both plant (gene with introns, ribosomal proteins) and animal mitochondria (modified
genetic code, short mitochondrial sequence). Similar
observations have been made for Acanthamoeba castellanii [41] or Trichoplax adhaerens [42].
Looking at the literature from the past decades,
emphasis has been put on differences between animal
and plant mitogenomes in their evolutionary dynamics
and at the structure level [11,14]. While a compact circular genome is found in the majority of animal
lineages, the plant mitogenome was described as a
dynamic equilibrium of isoforms of a master circular
chromosome and sub-molecules due to the occurrence
of repeated sequences favoring intragenomic recombination. In this context, it is particularly interesting to
notice that the evolutionary scenario based on rearrangement among master circles is congruent with the analysis based on sequence divergence among them.
Therefore, it appears that master circles might reflect
more than a virtual synthetic representation.

Conclusions
Despite important structural shuffling among genomes,
even at the species level, we were able to build a phylogenetic tree using rearrangement events between plant mitochondrial genomes that was congruent with a sequencebased tree. To our knowledge this is the first evolutionary
scenario of a plant mitogenome proposed solely on the
basis of rearrangement events in complete DNA
sequences. We showed that, under the hypothesis of structure evolution through inversions and tandem duplications
with loss, an evolutionary path could be drawn for each
genome. While such evolutionary events have been identified in animal mitogenomes, the hypothesis of a similar
mechanism has never been discussed for plant mitogenomes. Further work will consist of developing new tools in
order to automatically look for signatures of tandem duplication events in other plant mitogenomes and evaluate the
occurrence of this process on a larger scale.
Methods
Data
Mitochondrial genomes used

The eight studied mitogenomes from Zea were downloaded from GenBank. Among the 5 recently sequenced
mitogenomes from Zea mays subsp. mays, two of them
are fertile cytotypes NA [GenBank:DQ490953] and NB
[GenBank:AY506529], and three of them are cytoplasmic-male-sterile (CMS) cytotypes: CMS-C [GenBank:
DQ645536], CMS-S [GenBank:DQ490951] and CMS-T
[GenBank:DQ490953] [24]. We enriched the dataset with
the mitogenomes of three teosinte species, Zea mays
subsp. parviglumis [GenBank:DQ645539], Zea luxurians
[GenBank:DQ645537] and Zea perennis [GenBank:
DQ645538] (Allen et al., unpublished results). The two
last mitogenomes served as outgroups for phylogenetic
analysis. Table 1 summarizes the genomes used.
We noted that all mitogenomes are in the master circle conformation and all our analyses were based on
this conformation.
Synteny blocks

Synteny blocks, representing conserved sequence blocks
between all mitogenomes, were computed using Mauve
[43], a tool performing multiple genome alignments
between sequences that can be rearranged. Mauve uses
a set of genome DNA sequences as input. It locally
computes co-linear blocks from anchors that are short
unique similar DNA fragments. The anchors are then
extended in order to produce longer common segments.
Finally, the segments are clustered to locally produce
co-linear blocks under the constraint that, for a given
genome, segments have to be on the same strand. As
the Mauve algorithm keeps short unique similar DNA
fragments, duplicated DNA sequences are not taken

Page 12 of 16

into account. Mauve provides a backbone file containing
synteny blocks and an alignment file containing the
alignments of each synteny block.
Mauve parameters used are match weight seed = 9,
minimum island = 15, maximum backbone gap size = 15,
minimum backbone size = 50. Match weight seed parameter is essential in the multiple alignment and depends
on the number of genomes to align and their lengths.
Default weight seed is 11 for genomes of 1 MB length
and increases with the genome size. As mitogenomes
used in this study have a size comprised between 535 and
740 Kb, we set the weight seed at 9 (lower values were
tested but a weight seed of 9 provided the best results).
Minimum island is the minimum size for a fragment that
is not common to all genomes. Maximum backbone gap
size is the maximum size authorized for a gap in
sequences common to all mitogenomes. If one mitogenome had a gap longer than to 15 bp in a sequence block,
this block was split into two blocks at the gap. Minimum
backbone size is the minimum size for a sequence block.
Backbone DNA sequence

In order to compare mitogenomes at the sequence
level, for each genome we used the backbone and the
alignment sequences provided by Mauve to build a
sequence made of the concatenation of the synteny
blocks, called backbone DNA sequence. As duplicated
sequences are not taken into account in Mauve, we
masked one copy of each duplicate (size >500 bp) for
each mitogenome. A reference genome was chosen
(here NA) in order to build the backbone DNA
sequences. For each genome, the synteny blocks were
concatenated, following the order of the synteny
blocks on the reference genome. As we kept all common sequences between the eight genomes, the choice of
one reference genome instead of another does not
change the results. As the method used for computing
synteny blocks allows insertions, deletions and substitutions, the length of a synteny block may vary depending
on the genome and therefore the length of the backbone
sequence may be different for each genome. The number
of synteny blocks and the length of the backbone
sequence for the eight genomes were summarized in
Additional file 1. The repartition of synteny blocks for
the mitogenomes was provided in Figure 1.
Genome structure sequence

In order to study genomic rearrangements we had to
build a genome structure sequence (i.e. genome marker
order) out of the genome DNA sequence. Such a genome structure sequence is an abstraction of the genome
seen as a sequence of blocks that can be rearranged.
The main difference when compared with the backbone
sequence is that the DNA sequence within each block is
no longer considered.

Darracq et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:233
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/233

To build the genome structure sequence of each mitogenome, we applied the following strategy: i) first, we
extracted annotated protein coding genes, tRNAs,
rRNAs, ORFs (Open Reading Frame) and pseudogenes
from the corresponding GenBank file, and then, ii) noncoding sequences from the backbones.
For coding sequences extracted from all eight mitogenomes we built a database. For each sequence, we used the
YASS (Yet Another Similarity Searcher) software [44]
against this database (excluding the sequence of interest).
We conserved all reciprocal best hits in order to identify
orthologous markers. As E-value depends on the sequence
lengths compared, different E-values were used when
sequences were shorter or longer than 100 bp. For the
case of protein coding genes, rRNAs, ORFs and pseudogenes (with a length higher than 100 bp), we considered
only RBHs with an E-value lower than 1e-170 and with an
alignment length difference of less than 8%. For the case
of tRNAs and some protein coding gene exons (with a
length shorter than 100 bp) we chose an E-value of 1e-26
and an alignment length difference of less than 8%. When
it was impossible to distinguish between two reciprocal
best hits (same E-value and same sequence length), the
copies were considered as homologous. If a marker was
missing in a genome, we launched a search using YASS in
order to check if it was a misannotation. If the marker was
not found, the homologs (orthologs and paralogs) in other
mitogenomes were excluded from the study.
For non-coding sequences, we used fragments from the
backbone sequences that were larger than 100 bp. We
did not consider those included in a coding region
(because they would have been counted twice in the dataset). Using the YASS software, we only kept duplicates
with an alignment length difference of less than 8%.
We thus obtained a set of 187 markers common to all
genomes. If markers were found in the same order in all
mitogenomes, we grouped them into marker groups,
their boundaries corresponding to the flanking markers.
Overall, the extraction procedure resulted in a total of
69 markers along mitogenomes that we call hereafter
synteny anchors.
We obtained synteny anchor structure sequences by
assigning a number to each synteny anchor. Using NA
as the reference genome, each synteny anchor was
assigned a number in ascending order from left to right.
The numbering of the other genomes was based on NA
(using another reference mitogenome does not change
the results). A plus or minus was assigned to each synteny anchor depending on the strand where the synteny
anchor occured in the NA genome. These structure
sequences, where synteny anchor orthologs and paralogs
had the same number, were called GSS bpisac (Genome
Structure Sequence before paralog identification and
synteny anchor collapsing). Additional file 2 provides

Page 13 of 16

the composition and numbering of synteny anchors
used to build the GSS for each genome, Figure 1 depicts
GSS bpisac blocks repartition along the eight genomes.
In order to test our hypothesis of tandem duplication
in maize and teosinte mitogenomes, we needed to take
into account duplicated synteny anchors. As paralogous
synteny anchors have identical nucleotide sequences, we
used the neighborhood graph (see below and Additional
file 4) to distinguish them. Two different duplication
types (of one or more synteny anchor groups) could be
observed : unique to a mitogenome or shared by some
or all mitogenomes.
If a duplication was specific to one genome and
seemed to be tandem duplicated, we considered it as
being a recent event. In order to integrate the duplicated
synteny anchors in the dataset, we first looked for the
bounds of the duplicated part, then we reintroduced all
deleted synteny anchors yielding two juxtaposed identical parts, and finally collapsed the synteny anchors
involved in the two parts by re-numbering them to
obtain the part before tandem duplication.
If a duplication was shared between genomes (or specific
to one genome and not tandem duplicated), we considered
that there was a tandem duplication at the ancestral level.
When synteny anchor copies were distant along the mitogenomes, we decided to distinguish the copies using their
synteny anchor adjacencies in the eight genomes.
Through the neighborhood graph and the resulting hierarchical clustering (see Additional file 4) made on GSS
before paralog identification and synteny anchor collapsing
(bpisac), we determined the bounds of each duplicated
part (duplicates are on a thick line on GSSs bpisac in
Figure 1 and Figure 4). For example, for CMS-C, it
was difficult to choose if synteny anchors {32 33 34 35 36
37 38} had to be clustered with {31} or with {60}. Thanks
to the hierarchical clustering, {32 33 34 35 36 37 38} was
put with {31} because {32 33 34 35 36 37 38} were clustered with {31}. After all obvious tandem duplications
were collapsed, some duplications remained. Some of
them were specific to a given mitogenome, while the
others were shared by several mitogenomes. In the case of
{20 21 22}, for which at least one copy was found in all
mitogenomes, we made the hypothesis of an ancestral
duplication of this group followed by loss of one copy of
{21 22} in Zea luxurians, one copy of {22} in Zea perennis
and all copies in CMS-T. Other mitogenomes had kept all
copies. We renumbered one of the duplicates, depending
on the neighborhood. For example, {20 21 22} was associated with {23 24 25 26}, that is why the first occurrence
of {20 21 22} next to {23 24 25 26} was renumbered {20a
21a 22a} and the other occurrence was renumbered {20b
21b 22b}. We did the same for the group {27}, one copy
(next to {44}) was renamed {27a} and the other was
renamed {27b}. If a synteny anchor was duplicated (not in

Darracq et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:233
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/233

Page 14 of 16

tandem) in only one mitogenome, we also distinguished
the two occurrences. Under the postulate of a tandem
duplication event specific to this genome, we added the
new number in tandem with the first occurrence in the
other mitogenomes. This ensured that GRIMM kept synteny anchors together when computing evolving scenario
between all other mitogenomes. It was the case for {24} in
Zea luxurians, {26} and {67} in CMS-T, and {35} Zea perennis where paralogs were respectively renumbered {24b},
{26b},{67b} and {35b}. All duplicated synteny anchors were
then distinguished except for {2} duplicated in NA and
NB, {60, 61, 62} duplicated in NB, and {68} duplicated in
Zea perennis. All copies of these five synteny anchors were
thus deleted from the dataset.
It was thus possible to distinguish between paralogs
and orthologs for 8 out of 13 duplicated synteny
anchors (see Figure 3).
Then we were able to apply known rearrangement
methods on this structure called GSS. The GSS was
composed of 72 synteny anchors. Figure 4 provides a
comparison of GSS bpisac and GSS for CMS-C and Zea
perennis mitogenome.
Neighborhood graph and synteny anchor clusters

Neighborhood relationships between synteny anchors
were modeled in a graph. Two synteny anchors were
considered to be in the same neighborhood if they were
separated by at most one synteny anchor. A weight function was defined between two synteny anchors as the
number of times both synteny anchors were neighbor.
For a given weight w, a cluster of synteny anchors was
defined as a set of synteny anchors such that: i) for any
synteny anchor s in the set there exists another synteny
anchor s’ such that s and s’ are neighbor and the value of
the weight function between them is greater than w, ii)
for any synteny anchor s in the set and for any synteny
anchor s’ outside the set, s and s’ are not neighbors or
they are neighbors but the value of the weight function
between them is lower than w. That is two synteny
anchors were in the same cluster if they were separated
by at most one synteny anchor at least w times. We used

gene clusters such as common intervals [45] or gene
teams [46] cannot be applied to our data: the definition is
too restrictive and/or does not support duplicated genes.
Sequence analysis
Method for counting duplicated segments

Mitogenome statistics were performed with an in-house
script using YASS in order to detect large duplicated
segments (longer than 500 bp). YASS aligns pairwise
sequences and finds conserved segments. As we were
looking for highly conserved segments, we used a score
of +1 for matches and a score of -3 for substitutions.
Segments up to 500 bp (as in [24]) and with an E-value
lower than 1e-300 were considered as paralogous.
Substitution rate

Sequence substitution rates were computed from the
backbone DNA sequences and protein coding gene
sequences for each mitogenome pairs. Protein coding
gene sequence is the concatenation of one copy (since
the copies are identical) of each protein coding gene,
common to all mitogenomes. Substitution rate (for
10 kb) between two genomes was calculated as follows :
number of substitutions between genome1 and genome 2
 10000
alignment length between genome1 and genome2

Ratio of substitution rates between backbone DNA
sequences and protein coding genes was also calculated
(Table 3).
Structure sequence analysis

A simple way to measure a rearrangement distance
between genomes is to count the number of breakpoints
[47-49]. A breakpoint is a disruption of the genome
sequence order, i.e. when adjacency between two genes
in one genome disappears in another one. A breakpoint
matrix distance among genomes provides a way to
reconstruct a phylogenetic tree using distance methods
[50]. But such a basic tool does not provide any information about the history of rearrangements.
To further pursue the analysis of genomic rearrangements, one might compute the rearrangement distance
as the minimal number of rearrangement operations
needed to transform a genome into another [51]. This
distance can also be used to build a phylogenetic tree :
the more similar two genomes are, the smaller the rearrangement distance between them. The computation of
such a distance also provides the scenario of operations
that rearranged a genome into another. This allows one
to build parsimonious phylogenies and propose ancestral
nodes [18]. We used the GRIMM software (Genome
Rearrangements In Man and Mouse -this software is
not specific to Human and mouse genomes) [52] to

Darracq et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:233
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/233

compute inversion distances and scenarios. This software computes parsimonious inversion scenarios given a
set of genomes as sequences of numbers without
duplicates.
Phylogenetic analysis
At the DNA sequence level

Neighbor-Joining analyses were realized on the backbone
DNA sequences using BIONJ [53]. Parameters used are
bootstrap 1000× and Kimura-2 parameters distance for
correction. Maximum likelihood and molecular clock
were tested with TREE-PUZZLE [54] using the nucleotide model of Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY85) [55].
At the structure sequence level

Rearrangement analyses were performed using GRIMM
onto the GSSs. We obtained a distance matrix and then
used BIONJ on this matrix to obtain a phylogenetic
tree. Unfortunately, no bootstrap method is available for
rearrangement studies. In order to test the robustness of
the reconstructed trees, we adapted a Jackknife test
[56,57] on the GSSs as follows: we randomly kept ninety
percent of the GSS blocks (65 blocks out of 72); on this
subset we computed a GRIMM matrix and we built a
phylogeny using BIONJ; 1000 tests were applied. We
thus obtained 1000 trees. We reported the frequency of
the nodes found in the original tree according to this
set of trees. We performed tests for several percentages
of kept GSS blocks (10%, 20%,...100%) using the same
method (see Additional file 3). The MGR (Multiple
Genome Rearrangements) software [18] answers the
problem of computing a parsimonious phylogeny given
a set of genomes represented as sequences of numbers
without duplicates. Unfortunately this problem has been
shown to be computationally hard (NP-hard). It follows
that MGR provides an approximate solution which is
often near optimal [18].

fragment between mitogenomes is represented by an arrow. Fragment
with the smallest size is underlined in blue and fragment with the
longest size in red.

Synteny anchors contained in GSSs. A synteny anchor often contains
more than one genome marker (gene, tRNA, rRNA, ORF, pseudogene or
non-coding sequence from backbone DNA sequence).
Additional file 3: Jackknife tests. Node values for percentage of
conserved GSS blocks. For each percentage of conserved synteny anchors,
1000 GRIMM matrices were computed and 1000 trees were drawn from
these matrices. Each node value obtained for the consensus of these 1000
trees was reported in the graph. For example, for 90% of conserved GSS
synteny anchors, Jackknife value for the terminal node (separation between
NB and the remaining two Zea mays mitogenomes) 96.1%.
Additional file 4: Hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering
obtained with the neighborhood graph using GSSs. Two synteny anchors
closer to one another than the others were assigned to the same cluster.
