neurotoxin type/G

Abstract
Background: Clostridium botulinum is the taxonomic designation for at least six diverse species that produce
botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). There are seven known serotypes of BoNTs (/A through/G), all of which are potent
toxins classified as category A bioterrorism agents. BoNT/G is the least studied of the seven serotypes. In an effort
to further characterize the holotoxin and neurotoxin-associated proteins (NAPs), we conducted an in silico and
proteomic analysis of commercial BoNT/G complex. We describe the relative quantification of the proteins present
in the/G complex and confirm our ability to detect the toxin activity in vitro. In addition, we review previous
literature to provide a complete description of the BoNT/G complex.
Results: An in-depth comparison of protein sequences indicated that BoNT/G shares the most sequence similarity
with the/B serotype. A temperature-modified Endopep-MS activity assay was successful in the detection of BoNT/G
activity. Gel electrophoresis and in gel digestions, followed by MS/MS analysis of/G complex, revealed the presence
of four proteins in the complexes: neurotoxin (BoNT) and three NAPs–nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin (NTNH) and two
hemagglutinins (HA70 and HA17). Rapid high-temperature in-solution tryptic digestions, coupled with MS/MS
analysis, generated higher than previously reported sequence coverages for all proteins associated with the
complex: BoNT 66%, NTNH 57%, HA70 91%, and HA17 99%. Label-free relative quantification determined that the
complex contains 30% BoNT, 38% NTNH, 28% HA70, and 4% HA17 by weight comparison and 17% BoNT, 23%
NTNH, 42% HA70, and 17% HA17 by molecular comparison.
Conclusions: The in silico protein sequence comparisons established that the/G complex is phenetically related to
the other six serotypes of C. botulinum. Proteomic analyses and Endopep-MS confirmed the presence of BoNT and
NAPs, along with the activity of the commercial/G complex. The use of data-independent MSE data analysis,
coupled to label-free quantification software, suggested that the weight ratio BoNT:NAPs is 1:3, whereas the molar
ratio of BoNT:NTNH:HA70:HA17 is 1:1:2:1, within the BoNT/G progenitor toxin.

Background
Clostridium botulinum is the taxonomic designation for
at least six diverse species that produce botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). This heterologous species is further
classified into six metabolically distinct groups (I-VI).
The groups include the toxin-forming strains of C. botulinum, C. butyricum, C. baratii, and C. argentinense [1].
C. botulinum is a spore-forming anaerobic bacteria
which produces toxins that are lethal to humans and
animals, and are classified as category A bioterrorism

agents [2,3]. BoNTs target the Soluble NSF Attachment
Protein Receptors (SNARE) complex of proteins in the
synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes, preventing
acetylcholine from being released causing botulism (Figure 1) [3]. Seven immunologically distinct BoNT serotypes (/A through/G) have been described [1,3].
Botulinum neurotoxin G (BoNT/G) is the least studied of the seven serotypes. BoNT/G-producing organisms were first isolated by Gimenez and Ciccarelli in
1969 from soil samples taken from a cornfield in the
Mendoza Province of Argentina [4]. The investigators
indicated that a novel strain of bacterium produced an
antigenically specific, heat-labile botulinum-like toxin
that was not neutralized by any of the known botulinum
antisera. The antitoxin developed using this strain only

Figure 1 Graphical representation of the cell and peptide
targets of Botulinum neurotoxin. 1(A) is a representation of the
Synaptic cleft where BoNT enters the eukaryotic nerve cell. 1(B)
displays the position on the synaptobrevin-2 (VAMP-2) protein
where BoNT/G cleaves, stopping the synaptic vesicle from releasing
acetylcholine, inhibiting nerve impulse and causing muscle paralysis.
In a healthy cell, synaptobrevin-2 on the synaptic vesicle must
interact with syntaxin and synaptosomal-associated protein-25
(SNAP-25) on the neuronal membrane for fusion to occur. Fusion
allows the nerve impulse to be delivered across the synaptic
junction.

neutralized its homologous toxin and showed no activity
on any of the other known types of BoNT [4]. Overall,
nine strains of type G producing organisms have been
isolated, two from Argentina and seven from Switzerland; none of which have ever been clearly implicated as
the cause of paralytic illness or death in humans or animals [5].
Type G organisms are historically associated with the
C. botulinum species, because of their ability to produce
botulinum neurotoxin [3,4]. However, it is well known
that botulinal toxin production is a poor parameter on
which to base species identification and that the C.
botulinum species is a taxonomic collection of several
distinct species [3,5-7]. Type/G producing organisms are
classified as Clostridium argentinense [5]. This species
includes 12 strains of bacteria from the genus Clostridium: nine toxigenic strains and three non-toxigenic
strains. These strains are genetically and phenotypically
distinct from all other strains of C. botulinum and other
clostridial species [5].
Two of the three non-toxigenic strains were once classified as C. subterminale, and the third as C. hastiforme.

Page 2 of 12

These strains were often reported to cause serological
cross-reactions with type/G producing organisms and
the BoNT/G protein in ELISA and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) detection assays [5,8,9].
The C. argentinense species can be distinguished from
other asaccharolytic, proteolytic clostridia by a biochemical test that detects the production of a unique derivative of indole [5]. However, to avoid confusion among
the medical and scientific communities, C. argentinense
type/G producing organisms are still referred to as C.
botulinum type/G [7].
Type/G toxin is produced in culture as a relatively
large protein complex (L complex ~500 kDa) consisting
of a neurotoxin (BoNT) and three neurotoxin-associated
proteins (NAPs): two hemagglutinins (HA17 and HA70)
and a nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin (NTNH) component.
In addition, there is a gene expression protein (P21) that
is responsible for regulating the expression of the four
complex proteins. P21, however, is not associated with
the toxin complex itself [10,11]. The function of the
NAPs has been shown to protect the neurotoxin in
harsh environments in order to allow the toxin to enter
the synaptic membrane. Once inside the vesicle, the
toxin can cleave its specific SNARE complex protein
[3,12]. BoNT/G is known to cleave the Synaptobrevin
protein (VAMP-2) in the SNARE complex (Figure 1B).
It is the only toxin known to cleave at a single Ala 81Ala82 peptide bond [13] (Table 1).
Type/G-forming organisms have a relatively low toxigenicity, producing only small amounts of toxin in culture. This characteristic makes it difficult to identify
type/G organisms in the presence of other species [14].
The toxin requires tryptic activation to be successfully
detected in vitro; this requirement is also associated
with toxins produced by non-proteolytic types/B and/F,
as well as all strains of type/E [14]. Regardless of BoNT/
G’s low toxigenicity in vitro, Rhesus monkeys, chickens,
and guinea pigs have demonstrated susceptibility to
non-activated toxin when BoNT/G has been administered by various routes [15]. In addition, it has been
reported that the ability to produce BoNT/G can be lost
from toxigenic strains after several culture passages [16].

The predicted cleavage products and the masses of the substrate and product
peptides for both/B and/G are shown. The substrate peptide was derived from
the human Synaptobrevin-2 (VAMP-2) protein. Note that/B and/G cleave 4

The loss is thought to occur because the complete
nucleotide sequence of the BoNT/G gene, and the
NAPs, are found on a 81-MDa plasmid and not on the
chromosome [16,17] (Figure 2). Of the seven serotypes,
the BoNT/G nucleotide sequence has the most similarity to that of BoNT/B, as previously described [17].
Although BoNT/G is the least studied serotype of C.
botulinum, previous reports have described a digestion
method, two protein detection assays, and an activity
detection assay. Hines et al. were the first to apply a
proteomics approach for BoNT/G. The authors used a
16-hour digestion method, followed by high-pressure
liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). The method returned limited recovery of
peptides and protein sequence coverage. However, it
provided enough information to distinguish the proteins
associated with the BoNT/G complex [18]. Glasby and
Hatheway described the potential use of fluorescentantibody reagents to identify C. botulinum type/G producing strains, but they encountered cross-reactivity
issues with similar species of non-toxigenic clostridia
[9]. Lewis et al. reported an ELISA BoNT/G protein
detection assay that was able to detect low concentrations of the BoNT/G proteins. The assay, however, also
suffered from issues of cross-reactivity with similar nontoxigenic Clostridium species [8]. Finally, we have previously described a mass spectrometry-based activity
detection assay, the Endopep-MS method, which was
developed to detect the activity of BoNTs in vitro
against toxin-specific substrate peptides. This method
was successful at detecting all seven BoNT serotypes
[19].
Proteomics has been used to study changes after treatment with BoNT/A on suprachiasmatic nucleus [20], on
the thyroarytenoid muscle [21], and of C3 exoenzyme
from C. botulinum [22], but there are very few reports
on the BoNT proteome. In the present report, we detail
proteomics methods that were successfully applied to
the analysis of BoNT/G complex and thus further the
understanding of the serotype. We confirmed the detection of toxin activity by use of the Endopep-MS method.

The application of a rapid digestion method, coupled
with nano ultra-pressure liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (nUPLC-MS/MS), was successful at
obtaining a greater percentage of amino acid sequence
coverage of each protein associated with the/G complex
than was previously reported. In addition, we describe
the characterization and relative quantification of the
proteins present in the/G complex. We also compare
BoNT/G to other BoNT serotypes and discuss the previous literature reports to provide a complete description of the BoNT/G complex.

Results
Amino acid sequence comparisons confirmed BoNT/G
and/B similarity

Phenetic analysis of the seven available toxin sequences
compared revealed that BoNT/G was the most similar
to the BoNT/B Okra and the least similar to BoNT/C
Stockholm, with a 58.2% and a 32.9% sequence similarity, respectively (Figure 3A, additional file 1). To determine the extent to which the/G sequence is shared
among toxins in the/B family,/G was compared with 22
different/B strains, including subtypes of/B1,/B2,/B3,
bivalent (Bv/A and Bv/F), and non-proteolytic/B (np/B).
Of the 22 sequences,/G shared the most sequence
homology with the/B2 Prevot 25 NCASE strain, with an
overall 58.9% sequence similarity (additional file 2). In a
focused look at the similarities between/G and the/B2
strain, the individual domains of the toxin proteins were
compared. The percent similarity returned for each
domain were as follows: peptidase (light chain) 60.9%,
translocation (heavy chain) 63.8%, binding N-terminal
(NT) (heavy chain) 55.3%, and binding C-terminal (CT)
(heavy chain) 52.4% (Figure 3B). Additional comparison
of BoNT/G NAPs with the NAPs of the other six serotypes indicated that not only is the type/G toxin
sequence the most similar to/B, but the NAPs sequences
for both serotypes do as well. The percent similarity
returned for the NAPs were as follows: NTNH 78.3%,
HA70 73.1% and HA17 58.7% (Figure 3C-D, additional
files 3, 4, and 5).

complex are associated along the 81 MDa plasmid. NCBI does not have the gene listed under one accession number but rather is split into
two: the NAPs X87972 and the toxin X74162.

serotypes, most common strains, toxin sequences; (B) individually compared toxin domains of/G and the/B2 Prevot strain, the toxin sequence in
the/B family that shares the most similarities with/G; (C) the seven serotypes, most common strains, NTNH sequences; (D) the seven serotypes,
most common strains, HA70 sequences; and (E) the seven serotypes, most common strains, HA17 sequences. Of the seven serotypes,/G shares
the most similarity with the/B serotype. The percent identity shared between each/G and/B protein or domain is highlighted above1.

Gel LC-MS/MS Analysis identified the four main proteins
within the BoNT complex

Six of the 17 gel slices, tryptically digested overnight and
analyzed by use of nLC-MS/MS, returned protein
matches with high sequence coverage and a 99% identity
confidence when searched by use of PLGS v2.3 and validated with Scaffold v2.1. The four main proteins associated with the botulinum neurotoxin complex were
identified in various bands from the gel: BoNT/G,
NTNH, HA70, and HA17 (Figure 4).
In solution Tryptic Digestion Analysis improved protein
sequence coverage

The results of the six digests of BoNT/G from both analytical instruments (QTof-Premier and LTQ-Orbitrap)
were compiled to determine the greatest percent of
sequence coverage of each protein identified: BoNT/G
[NCBI, CAA52275], NTNH [NCBI, CAA61228], HA70
[NCBI, CAA61225], and HA17 [NCBI, CAA61226] (Figure 5A-D). The percent recovery was determined by
combining all unique peptides identified by both nLCMS/MS instruments and calculating the ratio of amino
acids identified vs. total amino acids in the protein
sequence.

Endopep-MS Analysis confirmed toxin activity

The results of the Endopep-MS experiments conducted
through use of various dilutions of BoNT/G indicated
that the optimum temperature for/G activity is 42°C,
not 37°C as observed with other BoNT serotypes. Additionally, the experiments indicated that the toxin is the
most active, or best activated, when first exposed to a
short 10 min pulse at 47°C and then continuously incubated at 42°C for 120 hrs. The detection of the 2281 m/
z (NT) and 1762 m/z (CT) product ions in each experiment confirmed that the lots of commercial toxin used
were active.
Relative quantification of type G toxin and NAPs was
determined by use of MSE

Label-free relative protein quantification was obtained
for each component of the type G toxin complex (Table
2). When calculated by weight, the BoNT/G complex
contained 30% of toxin, 38% of NTNH, 28% of HA70,
and 4% of HA17. These percentages and nanogram
amounts indicate that the overall weight ratio of BoNT:
NAPs present within the complex is 1:3. The percentages of each molecule present in the complex are as
follows: 17.2% of toxin, 23.1% of NTNH, 42.0% HA70,

and 17.8% HA17. These percentages and femtomole
amounts indicate a 1:1:2:1 BoNT:NTNH:HA70:HA17
ratio, or a 1:4 BoNT:NAPs ratio, of molecules within the
complex.

Discussion
BoNT/G is the least-studied and the most recently
reported of the seven serotypes produced by C. botulinum. Although BoNT/G is associated with a distinct
species and metabolic group, the toxin shares multiple
characteristics with the other six progenitor toxins. The
seven serotypes have similar biochemical and molecular
mechanisms of cell entry and membrane translocation.
They cause disease by inhibiting synaptic transmission
as a result of the enzymatic cleavage of the SNARE protein complex. In the present work, we detail the in silico
comparison of BoNT/G progenitor toxin proteins to the
other six serotypes of C. botulinum, as well as methods
for the digestion, detection, and relative quantification
of BoNT/G and its NAPs.
The comparison of the BoNT/G progenitor toxin with
the other six serotypes was completed to determine/G’s
phenotypic relationship with the other BoNTs. In

general, past analyses [7,10,23] have included a comparison at the gene level; this study focuses solely on protein level. While comparisons of toxin and NTNH
proteins to select serotypes have been previously
described [23], a complete comparison of all/G complex
proteins (toxin, NTNH, HA70, and HA17) with the
other six serotypes has not been previously reported.
Phenetic analysis confirmed that the BoNT/G complex
of proteins shared the most similarity with the/B serotype (Figure 3C-E), as previously reported [10,23].
To determine the extent of/G’s homology to the/B
toxin serotype, we completed an in-depth comparison of
six/B subtypes, 22 different accession numbers (Figure
3B, additional files 2). The comparison of individual
domains–translocation domain, binding domain NT,
binding domain CT, and peptidase–revealed the area of
the toxin in which/G shares the greatest (translocation
domain) and least (binding domain CT) similarity. Overall, each domain compared, between the two toxins, is
greater than 50% similar. This comparison helped to
determine which substrate peptide would be optimal to
test the activity of/G. Although there are no direct indications that sequence similarity would imply overall
identical functionality, similar sequences would allow
similar crystal structures to form, suggesting similar
functionality [24]. It is currently known that both
BoNT/B and/G cleave the Synaptobrevin protein;/B
cleaves a Gln76-Phe77 bond and/G an Ala81-Ala82 bond
five amino acids downstream (Table 1). Because the
cleavage sites of both toxins are relatively near one
another–thus the similarity of their binding domain
sequences and therefore structures–the same peptide
substrate currently used to test/B activity was used to
test/G activity [19].
In order to confirm that the commercial BoNT/G complex was active and therefore could be considered analogous to the toxin complex found in clinical samples,
various dilutions of the commercial toxin were tested
using the Endopep-MS method previously described (Figure 6) [19]. In addition to confirming the toxin’s activity,
the Endopep-MS experiments indicated a new optimum
temperature for/G activity. When reactions were pulsed
at 47°C for 10 min, followed by incubation at 42°C for at
least eight hours–as opposed to 37°C for a minimum of
17 hr–an increase in activity and in the quality of mass
spectra produced was observed. Other serotypes of
BoNT (/C and/D) are often associated with botulism in
animals, avians, equines, and bovines, whose body temperatures are higher than those of humans. BoNT/G has
yet to be associated with botulism in a particular organism; however, it is possible that/G would be more effective at causing disease in an organism with a higher body
temperature than that of humans, similar to BoNT/C
and/D.

Figure 5 Sequence coverage returned from in solution tryptic digests. The four main proteins that are associated with the BoNT/G
complex and the percent of each sequence that was returned after digestion are highlighted above. The percent recovery was determined by
combining all unique peptides returned from two nanoLC-MS/MS instruments and calculated by use of the number of amino acids recovered
vs. total amino acids in the protein sequence. (A) BoNT/G 66% [NCBI, CAA52275] (B) NTNH 57% [NCBI, CAA61228] (C) HA17 99% [NCBI,
CAA61226] (D) HA70 91% [NCBI, CAA61225]

Proteomic strategies and analyses used in this study
were important to help define the characteristics of proteins associated with the BoNT/G complex. The 1DSDS PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of the four
expected complex proteins (BoNT, NTNH, HA70, and
HA17), with relatively high sequence coverage for in gel
digestion (Figure 4). As expected the proteins, P21 and
HA33, were not identified. P21, a positive regulator of
gene expression, lies just upstream of NTNH on the
toxin plasmid (Figure 2) [10]. The purpose of P21, in
complex development, is not completely understood and
previous reports have not identified it as part of the/G

complex [11]. HA33, a hemagglutinin component, is not
found on the/G plasmid. The lack of evidence of the
protein’s presence further endorsed the theory that,
unlike the other serotypes, HA33 is not associated with
the/G complex [10]. Two gel slices (Figure 4; #6 and 11)
out of 17 visually had protein but did not return any
identifiable peptides when digested and analyzed. This
could be due to a number of factors: the protein was
relatively difficult to digest, there was not a sufficient
amount of protein to digest, the sequence was not present in the database used, or post-translational modifications (PTMs) altered the protein sequence and did not

allow for identification. The SDS-Page gel and in gel
digestions confirmed visually and analytically which proteins are present in the commercial toxin complex and
allowed us to continue to in solution digestions with
some prior knowledge of which proteins should be
identified.
As anticipated, the same proteins that were identified
with the in gel digestions were also identified in the analysis of the in solution digestions. The four main complex components– BoNT, NTNH, HA70, and HA17–
were all identified with high confidence, and returned a
large number of peptides. Hines et al. reported the use
of a reduction and alkylation overnight digestion
method that produced sequence coverages of 16% for
BoNT, 10% for NTNH, 38% for HA70, and 49% for
HA17 [18]. The method used in our study allowed the
recovery of more than four times the sequence coverage
for BoNT at 66%, more than five times for NTNH at
57%, and more than double for both HA70 and HA17
at 91% and 99%, respectively.
BoNT complexes are difficult to digest in solution
[18]. This rapid high-temperature digestion method
does not involve reduction and alkylation, unlike classical methods; instead, it uses an acid labile surfactant to
solubilize the hydrophobic proteins. The increased solubility allows a denatured protein to be more susceptible
to tryptic digestion, thereby increasing the rate of digestion and the number of tryptic peptides produced [25].
It has also been previously reported that the use of high
temperature for a short period of time is the best condition for the enzymatic activity of trypsin [26].
This BoNT complex digestion method, in addition to
analysis of the samples on two different electrospray
(ESI) MS instruments using data-dependent (DDA) and
data-independent MSE analysis, allowed for the detection of a greater number of peptides for each protein,
leading to a greater overall sequence coverage than had

previously been reported. This sequence coverage lends
insight into the complex proteins being studied. A high
percentage of sequence coverage indicates that there are
few PTMs associated with the proteins, as well as no
truncation. The presence of PTMs has been known to
compromise protein identification, and truncated proteins do not function as expected.
In addition to providing enhanced sequence coverage,
the use of data-independent MSE analysis and label-free
quantification software allowed us to relatively quantify
the amount of each protein present in the BoNT/G
complex (Table 2). This quantification method has the
advantage of being able to provide accurate estimates of
relative protein abundance (often within 30% of the
known values on most identified proteins in a mixture,
without the much more rigorous requirements of targeted protein quantification methods. A percentage of
abundance (by weight and molecules, separately) of each
protein within the complex was determined, as well as
an overall weight ratio of BoNT:NAPs and a molecular
ratio of BoNT:NTNH:HA70:HA17. Analysis of the individual proteins within the complex illustrated that the
weight of the toxin (30.4%) is almost equivalent to that
of HA70 (27.8%) and about eight percent less than that
of NTNH (38%); whereas HA17 makes up only a minute
portion of the overall weight at just 3.7%. Conversely,
analysis using molecular amounts indicated that the
complex contains an equivalent amount of the toxin,
NTNH, and HA17, whereas HA70 is almost twice as
abundant. The nanogram and femtomole on column
data sets signify a likely overall ratio of 1:3 BoNT:NAPs
weight ratio and a 1:1:2:1 BoNT:NTNH:HA70:HA17
molar ratio. As stated earlier, the function of the NAPs
has been shown to protect the neurotoxin in harsh
environments [12]. Due to this protective ability, in theory, a larger ratio of NAPs:BoNT, ie the greater the
number of molecules of NAPs to BoNT, would protect

more effectively the toxin from the acidic environment
of the stomach. This potentially would increase the toxin’s effectiveness at penetrating the mucosa of the intestine and entering the blood stream, increasing the
toxin’s chances of entering the synaptic cell and causing
disease. Knowledge of the stoichiometry of proteins
within the BoNT complexes would be useful to further
understanding of NAPs significance and toxin potency.

Conclusions
We have presented a detailed in silico comparison of
the/G complex of proteins to the other six serotypes in
an effort to compare, contrast, and further define the
complex’s relationship relative to the/B serotype and
subtypes within the botulinum toxins. Proteomic analyses, consisting of gel electrophoresis, in gel and in
solution digestions, and Endopep-MS, confirmed the
presence of BoNT, NTNH, HA70, and HA17 proteins
and the activity of the commercial/G complex. We were
successful at obtaining high sequence coverage for all
four complex proteins by using a rapid, high-temperature digestion method and analysing with two different
nLC-MS/MS instruments. The efficiency of this method
allowed for a greater recovery of protein sequence and
further insight into the complex proteins. The use of
data-independent MS E data analysis coupled to labelfree quantification software suggested that relative quantification of the proteins within BoNT progenitor toxins
could be determined and would be very informative to
further analysis of C. botulinum potency.
Methods
Materials and Safety Procedures

We purchased the BoNT/G complex from C. argentinense strain 89 from Metabiologics (Madison, WI).
The company provided the complex at 1 mg/mL in 50
mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5 and quality control
activated. The toxin activity in mouse LD50 or units
(U) of specific toxicity obtained from the provider was
as follows: [3.3-3.6 × 10^6]. We acquired all chemicals
from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO), unless otherwise stated. Los Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, NM) synthesized the substrate peptide used in
the Endopep-MS assay. The peptide sequence is listed
in Table 1 along with the targeted cleavage products.
We followed standard safety handling and decontamination procedures, as described for botulinum neurotoxins [27]. We needed only very low toxin amounts
for this work.

MegAlign® –DNA Star Inc; Madison, WI). The alignments followed the Clustal W method [28]. We
obtained the toxin protein sequences used for phenetic
analysis of the seven BoNT serotypes, the 22 sequences,
covering six subtypes, of/B toxin family, and the NAPs
(NTNH, HA70 and HA17) of the seven BoNT serotypes
from the NCBI protein database (March 2010). For the
complete listing of all the accession numbers used in
the toxin,/B subtypes, and the NAPs comparison, see
additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate/
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D SDS-PAGE)

We added a 4 μL aliquot of [1 μg/μL] commercial
BoNT/G complex to 2 μL of NuPAGE ® LDS sample
buffer and 1 μL NuPAGE® Reducing agent (Invitrogen;
Carlsbad, CA) and reduced it by heating at 70°C for 10
min. We cooled and loaded the sample onto a 4-12%
NuPAGE ® Novex ® Bis-Tris mini polyacrylamide gel
(Invitrogen) and analyzed it alongside 10 μL of Precision
Plus: All Blue and Kaleidoscope protein pre-stained
molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad, CA). We performed
electrophoresis at 200 V for 35 min, then rinsed the gel
3 × 5 min with dH 2 O and stained it with GelCode™
Blue Safe Protein Stain (Pierce; Rockford, IL) for 1 hr
before de-staining overnight in dH2O.
GeLC-MS/MS
Sample Excision

We cut the sample lane of interest from a previously
run 1D SDS-PAGE gel into 1 × 2 mm slices–17 slices
total–and stored the slices at -80°C prior to tryptic
digestion.
Tryptic Digestion

We lyophilized the individually cut and stored gel slices
for 30 min by use of a Centrivap concentrator (Labconco; Kansas City, MO). We added 10 μL of mass
spectrometry-grade trypsin (Promega; Madison, WI) to
each sample and incubated each sample at room temperature for 5 min. We then added 25 μL of digestion
buffer (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate:1 mM CaCl2) to
each sample and incubated the samples at 37°C
overnight.
Post-Digestion

We added 5 μL of 0.1% formic acid to the samples for
acidification, followed by 2-3 min of sonication to
release peptides. We then centrifuged the samples at 12,
100 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material. We
collected the soluble peptide mixtures for nLC-MS/MS
analysis.

Amino acid sequence comparisons

We carried out all in silico work, including the sequence
alignments, sequence identities, and phylogenetic trees,
using Lasergene software (Protean, EditSeq, and

nLC-MS/MS analysis

We obtained data by using a nanoAcquity ultra-performance liquid chromatography (nUPLC) coupled to a

QTof-Premier MS system (Waters Corp; Milford, MA).
We loaded protein digests onto a capillary reverse phase
Symmetry C18 trapping column and a BEH C18 analytical column (100 μm I.D. × 100 mm long, 1.7Å packing;
Waters Corp) at a flow rate of 1.2 μL/min. Each sample
was separated by use of a 90 min gradient. The mobile
phase solvents were (solvent A) 0.1% formic acid (FA;
Thermo Scientific; Rockford, IL) in water (Burdick and
Jackson; Muskegon, MI) and (solvent B) 0.1% FA in
acetonitrile (ACN; Burdick and Jackson). The gradient
profile consisted of a ramp from 1%B to 85%B over 82
min, followed by a second ramp to 1%B over 8 min,
with data acquired from 5 to 50 min. We analyzed peptides by nano-electrospray on a QTof-Premier hybrid
tandem mass spectrometer. The QTof used an MSE (or
Protein Expression) method, which involved acquiring
data-independent alternating low- and high-collision
energy scans over the m/z range 50-1990 in 0.6 sec,
along with lockmass data on a separate channel to
obtain accurate mass measurement.

use of a trap column. The peptide separation was performed over a 120 minute gradient at a flow rate of 400
nl/min. The mobile phase solvents were: (solvent A)
0.2% FA, 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, and
(solvent B) 0.2% FA, 0.005% TFA in ACN. The gradient
was set at 5% B for 5 minutes, followed by a ramp to
30% B over 100 minutes, then a ramp up to 90% B in 5
min and held at 90% B for 2 min before returning to 5%
B in 2 min and re-equilibration at 5% B for 20 min.
Peptides were analyzed by nano-electrospray on an LTQ
Orbitrap hybrid tandem mass spectrometer. The mass
spectrometer was programmed to perform data-dependent acquisition by scanning the mass range from m/z
400 to 1600 at a nominal resolution setting of 60, 000
for parent ion acquisition in the Orbitrap. Then, tandem
mass spectra of doubly charged and higher charge state
ions were acquired for the top 10 most intense ions. All
tandem mass spectra were recorded by use of the linear
ion trap. This process cycled continuously throughout
the duration of the gradient.

In solution Tryptic Digestion for nLC-MS/MS analysis

Endopep-MS analysis of toxin activity

We completed the tryptic digestions as previously
described [25] with few modifications. In all cases, 5 μg
of commercial BoNT/G complex was digested, ending
with a final digestion volume of 50 μL. All digestions
were initially treated with an acid-labile surfactant (ALS)
and performed at 52°C for 3 min following the addition
of trypsin (Promega; Madison, WI). After acidification,
the samples were centrifuged at 12, 100 × g for 10 min
to remove insoluble material. The soluble peptide mixtures were then collected for nLC-MS/MS analysis.
Once the method was optimized, the experiment was
repeated three times for two lots of commercial toxin
(six digests total) to confirm that the results were consistent with the proteins that are expected in the toxin
complex.

The reactions were performed as described previously [19]
with a few modifications. In all cases, the final reaction
volume was 20 μL; the final concentration of reaction buffer was 0.02 M Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2
mM ZnCl2, and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA);
and the final concentration of the peptide substrate was 50
picomles/μL. For all experiments, 2 μL [1 μg/μL] of
BoNT/G complex was diluted with dH2O to various unit
(U) concentrations; 1 μL of each dilution was subsequently
spiked into 20 μL of reaction buffer and incubated at 37°C,
42°C, or 47°C for 10 min, followed by 42°C for 120 hrs.
Time points to gauge the progress of the reaction were
taken at 6, 8, 24, 72, and 120 hrs (although in a few cases,
a 96 or 144 hr point was taken as a substitute for 120 hrs).
2 μL of each reaction was mixed with 18 μL of a-cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix and spotted for
analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS.

nLC-MS/MS analysis

The in solution tryptic digests were analysed by use of
two analytical instruments, a QTof-Premier and an
LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo-Finnigan; San Jose, CA), to help
to improve the overall protein coverage of the BoNT/G
complex. The analyses of digests that used the QTofPremier were performed initially as described above in
the GeLC-MS/MS methods section.
LTQ-Orbitrap

Data were obtained by use of an Eksigent 2D nanoLC
system (Eksigent Technologies; Dublin, CA) coupled to
an LTQ-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer. A 365 μm
O.D. × 75 μm I.D. fused silica pulled needle capillary
(New Objective; Woburn, MA) was packed in house
with 10 cm of 5 μm Symmetry 300 reverse phase packing material (Waters Corp). The tryptic digests were
loaded directly onto the analytical column without the

MS Acquisition

The Endopep-MS reactions were run on a 4800
MALDI-TOF (Applied Biosystems; Framingham, MA).
Mass spectra of each sample well were obtained by
scanning from 1000 to 4400 m/z in MS positive-ion
reflector mode. The instrument uses a Nd:YAG laser at
337 nm with a 200 MHz repetition rate, and each spectrum generated was an average of 2400 laser shots. Preceding each run, the instrument was tuned and
calibrated for accurate MS analysis by use of a mixture
of five peptides: des-Arg1-Bradykinin (m/z 904.47),
angiotensin I (m/z 1, 296.69), Glu1-fibrinopeptide B (m/
z 1, 570.68), ACTH (1-17)(m/z 2093.08), ACTH (18-39)
(m/z 2, 465.20).

nLC-MS/MS and Endopep-MS data processing
nLC-MS/MS data

Data obtained from the QTof-Premier were processed by
use of Waters’ ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS v2.3; Milford, MA) and searched against a curated C. botulinum
database consisting of 22, 000 NCBI entries, including the
protein standard Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, Waters
Corp; Milford, MA) and contaminants such as trypsin.
Tandem mass spectra were analyzed by use of the following parameters: variable modification of oxidized M, 1%
false positive rate, a minimum of three fragment ions per
peptide and seven fragment ions per protein, a minimum
of 1 peptide match per protein, and with up to two missed
cleavages per peptide allowed. Root mean square mass
accuracies were typically within 8 ppm for the MS data
and within 15 ppm for MS/MS data.
Tandem mass spectra, obtained from the LTQ-Orbitrap, were extracted by Mascot Distiller (Matrix Science;
London, UK; v2.2.1.0) and subsequently searched by use
of Mascot (Matrix Science; v2.2.0) against a NCBI database consisting of seven million entries. All files generated by Mascot Distiller were searched with the
following parameters: 200 ppm parent MS ion window,
0.8 Da MSMS ion window, and up to 2 missed cleavages
allowed. Variable modifications for the Mascot searches
were deamidation and oxidation.
Scaffold (Proteome Software Inc.; Portland, OR; v2.1.03)
was used to validate all MS/MS-based peptide and protein
identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if
they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability,
as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm [29]. Protein
identifications were accepted if they could be established
at greater than 99.0% probability and if they contained at
least two identified peptides. Protein probabilities were
assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm [30]. Proteins
that contained similar peptides and that could not be differentiated on the basis of MS/MS analysis alone were
grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. With the
stringent parameters of Peptide Prophet and Protein Prophet, the false discovery rate was zero.
Endopep-MS data

The MS Reflector data, obtained from the Endopep-MS
reactions, were analyzed by hand. A visual comparison
(by an expert researcher) of the intact substrate and its
cleavage products was enough to confirm a positive or
negative reaction.
Relative quantification of type G NAPs

The six in solution digestions, three per lot of toxin, of
BoNT/G complex were spiked with a known amount of
standard yeast ADH digest (100 fMol on column) and
analyzed as four technical replicates by use of the QTof-

Page 10 of 12

Premier operated in data independent acquisition mode
[31,32]. The relative protein quantification of individual
replicates was determined based on the average MS signals of the three most intense tryptic peptides per protein, through use of the PLGS IdentityE software. Once
processed, the data sets were exported from PLGS and
clustered according to digestion number for further evaluation by use of Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). The femtomole and nanograms on column
values (Table 2) were calculated by averaging the technical replicates, excluding outliers with 30% or greater
variation. These values were then averaged on the basis
of lot grouping. The lot grouping averaged values were
used to determine a percent by weight, nanograms on
column, and a percent of molecules, femtomole on column, of each protein within the BoNT/G complex. In
addition, a molar ratio of BoNT:NTNH:HA70:HA17,
and BoNT:NAPs, by weight, was determined.

Additional material
