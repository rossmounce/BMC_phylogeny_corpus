Abstract
Background: Adaptive evolution appears to be a common feature of reproductive proteins across
a very wide range of organisms. A promising way of addressing the evolutionary forces responsible
for this general phenomenon is to test for adaptive evolution in the same gene but among groups
of species, which differ in their reproductive biology. One can then test evolutionary hypotheses
by asking whether the variation in adaptive evolution is consistent with the variation in
reproductive biology. We have attempted to apply this approach to the study of a female
reproductive protein, zona pellucida C (ZPC), which has been previously shown by the use of
likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) to be under positive selection in mammals.
Results: We tested for evidence of adaptive evolution of ZPC in 15 mammalian species, in 11 avian
species and in six fish species using three different LRTs (M1a-M2a, M7-M8, and M8a-M8). The only
significant findings of adaptive evolution came from the M7-M8 test in mammals and fishes. Since
LRTs of adaptive evolution may yield false positives in some situations, we examined the properties
of the LRTs by several different simulation methods. When we simulated data to test the
robustness of the LRTs, we found that the pattern of evolution in ZPC generates an excess of false
positives for the M7-M8 LRT but not for the M1a-M2a or M8a-M8 LRTs. This bias is strong enough
to have generated the significant M7-M8 results for mammals and fishes.
Conclusion: We conclude that there is no strong evidence for adaptive evolution of ZPC in any
of the vertebrate groups we studied, and that the M7-M8 LRT can be biased towards false inference
of adaptive evolution by certain patterns of non-adaptive evolution.

Background
Genes involved in reproduction and fertilization tend to
evolve at faster rates than non-reproductive genes and it
has been proposed that this rapid evolution is driven by
positive Darwinian selection [1]. Mammalian sperm pro-

teins have been extensively studied and they often show
rapid divergence between closely related species [2-6]. The
evolution of female reproductive proteins in vertebrate
species has however received less attention, although evidence of positive selection has been provided for some

female reproductive genes [7]. The precise nature of the
selective pressures responsible for the accelerated evolution of reproductive genes are unknown, although plausible candidates include sexual selection, sexual conflict,
and speciation reinforcement [1,8]. All three candidate
evolutionary processes involve male-female interactions
potentially manifested as sperm-egg interactions. So a way
to test for these evolutionary processes is to compare patterns of evolution in genes involved in sperm-egg binding
in (groups of) species, which differ with respect to sexual
selection, sexual conflict or speciation reinforcement. For
instance, in species with external fertilization, species recognition at the sperm-egg level should be more important
than in species with internal fertilization, for which prefertilization mechanisms exist to avoid hybridisation. So
if positive selection on reproductive genes is due to species
recognition and hybridisation avoidance, then the signal
of positive selection should be stronger in species with
external fertilization than in species with internal fertilization. Furthermore, if species recognition at the sperm-egg
level is driving the evolution of the genes involved in
sperm-egg binding, then highly species-specific binding of
sperm to the egg should yield a stronger signal of positive
selection than less species-specific binding.

lution among the three vertebrate groups. Since the three
groups differ in their fundamental reproductive biology,
any differences in adaptive evolution should be informative with regard to the underlying evolutionary mechanisms. By combining sequences from public databases
and our own sequencing efforts, we constructed separate
alignments of the ZPC coding sequence for 15 mammalian species, 11 avian species and six fish species. Our
principle method for inferring adaptive evolution from
ZPC sequence data was to apply LRTs of codon based
models, which allow among-site variation in selection
pressures. These models permit the inference of positive
selection at a small proportion of sites, so that the signal
of positive selection is not swamped by the (usually)
much larger proportion of sites which are neutral or under
negative selection. Such LRTs were used to demonstrate
adaptive evolution of ZPC in mammals. However, there
has been recent concern over high rates of false inference
of positive selection with LRTs, particularly when applied
to relatively small alignments with little sequence divergence [14-17]. Therefore we used three different LRTs and
checked the evidence for positive selection by simulation
studies.

Results
As an illustration of this general approach for determining
the nature of positive selection in reproductive genes, we
have investigated the molecular evolution of the gene
encoding ZPC, the female reproductive glycoprotein zona
pellucida C, in the three vertebrate groups of mammals,
birds and fishes. The surface of the vertebrate oocyte is
covered with an egg envelope, which is composed of several zona pellucida glycoproteins. ZPC is involved in the
binding of sperm to the egg in mammals and birds, after
which the acrosome reaction is triggered [9,10]. In general, when egg and sperm come from different mammalian species, binding of sperm to the egg envelope does
not occur, thus the binding is species-specific [9]. From
studies of sperm-egg binding in species from the avian
order Galliformes (chicken and related species) it appears
that the binding is not species-specific [11]. As a consequence, sperm-egg interactions in birds do not represent
such a stringent species-specific barrier as they do in mammals. The fertilization mechanism in fish is rather different from that in mammals and birds. Most fish sperm lack
an acrosome and penetrate the egg envelope via a discrete
micropyle [12]. The function of the fish ZPC homologue
is not entirely known, but studies in medaka (Oryzias latipes) suggest a function in guiding sperm to the micropyle,
but it is unknown whether this process is species-specific.
In mammals, ZPC has previously been shown to be evolving by positive selection [7,13]. By considering the evolution of ZPC in birds and fishes as well as mammals we
hoped to uncover variation in the levels of adaptive evo-

Overview of ZPC divergence
Using public available sequences and our own sequencing
efforts, we produced three separate multiple species alignments of ZPC coding sequences for 15 mammals, 11 birds
and six fishes. The total lengths of the alignments, which
do not include start or stop codons but which do include
gaps, are 1311 bp (437 codons) for mammals, 1335 bp
(445 codons) for birds, and 1494 bp (498 codons) for
fishes. Total tree length in substitutions per codon is 4.49
for mammals, 0.69 for birds, 4.49 for fishes. Thus there is
relatively little sequence divergence in our sample of bird
species compared to the other two groups of vertebrates.

We first analysed the ZPC interspecies alignments assuming the M0 model of no variation in ω among codons. ω
is the nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratio, also
known as Ka/Ks or Dn/Ds, and is widely used as a measure of selective pressures on proteins assuming synonymous neutrality: ω<1 indicates negative selection, ω = 1
indicates neutrality, and ω>1 indicates positive selection.
Average ω is 0.26 for mammals, 0.12 for birds and 0.32
for fishes. These low values indicate that the predominant
mode of selection on the ZPC is purifying selection, and
are consistent with the finding that domains within the
ZPC gene are very well conserved across vertebrates [18].
Thus the M0 model of no variation in ω among codons
gives no indication that ZPC is evolving unusually rapidly
at the protein level.

Likelihood ratio tests of positive selection
LRTs of positive selection compare the fit of two nested
models to the sequence data; a null model without adaptive evolution and an alternative model with adaptive
evolution. Both models may invoke variation in ω among
codons, but the null model is restricted to ω less than or
equal to one, whereas the alternative model allows adaptive evolution with ω>1. If the alternative model provides
a significantly better fit to the data then adaptive evolution is inferred. We considered three different LRTs, three
different pairs of null and alternative models: M1a-M2a,
M7-M8, M8a-M8 (see Methods).

Table 1 provides a summary of all the LRTs of positive
selection performed on the multiple species alignments of
ZPC coding sequences of mammals, birds and fishes. Let
us first consider the evolution of ZPC in mammals, since
M7-M8 LRTs have previously been used to demonstrate
positive selection across a wide range of mammals [7] and
more specifically in the Mus genus [13]. There is no indication of positive selection using the M1a-M2a test, since
no sites are inferred to be under positive selection in the
M2a model (hence p = 1). In contrast, the M8 model indicates that 9.7% of codons are subject to weak positive
selection (ω = 1.32), with the chi-square approximation to
the LRT (see Methods) indicating a significant improvement in fit from M7 to M8 (p = 0.004) and a suggestive
improvement in fit from M8a to M8 (p = 0.084).
For birds, inferences of rare and weak positive selection
are obtained for both the M2a (5.3% at ω = 1.27) and M8
(4.9% at ω = 1.29) models, although the chi-square
approximations indicate no significant improvement in

fits for alternative over null models (M1a-M2a p = 0.87,
M7-M8 p = 0.16, M8a-M8 p = 0.58).
For fishes, the M2a model gives very little indication of
positive selection (30% of codons with ω = 1.04), and the
tiny increase in likelihood from M1a to M2a is not
remotely significant (p = 0.97). The M8 model indicates
that 24% of codons are subject to moderate positive selection (ω = 1.16). As with mammals the chi-square approximation indicates a significant improvement in fit for the
M8 model over the M7 model (p = 0.0006). For the M8aM8 comparison, the chi-square approximation indicates a
non-significant improvement in fit (p = 0.19).
Simulation studies
The LRT analyses show that the three different LRTs give
rather different views of positive selection in ZPC. The
M1a-M2a test gives no indication of adaptive evolution in
any of the three vertebrate groups. The situation is similar
for the M8a-M8 test, although the result in mammals is at
least suggestive. In contrast, the M7-M8 test gives highly
significant evidence of adaptive evolution in mammals
and fishes, and even though the M7-M8 LRT is not significant in birds the M7-M8 test gives the lowest p value of
the three tests.

How can we explain the differences among the LRTs?
There are a number of possible explanations: (1) there is
no adaptive evolution in ZPC in vertebrates, and the chisquare approximation is biased to give false positives for
the M7-M8 test (but not the other two LRTs); (2) there is
no adaptive evolution in ZPC in vertebrates, and the M7M8 test is biased to give false positives because it is not

robust to the complex patterns of non-adaptive evolution
in ZPC (but not the other two LRTs); and (3) there is
adaptive evolution, and the M7-M8 test has greater power
to reveal adaptive evolution than the other two tests. We
performed simulations to examine these alternative explanations.
To test explanation (1) we performed parametric bootstrapping to check the chi-square approximation to the
likelihood ratio statistic (see Materials and Methods). We
performed parametric bootstrapping with 100 simulated
data sets for the three LRTs in both mammals and fishes.
In each case we found a good correspondence between the
p value for the null model obtained by parametric bootstrapping and the p value obtained by the chi-square
approximation (see Table 2). There seems to be no reason
to suggest that any biases in the chi-square approximation
could have generated the M7-M8 evidence of adaptive
evolution, i.e. the p values obtained by parametric bootstrapping for the M7-M8 tests remain significant.
To test explanation (2) we performed simulations to
check the robustness of the three LRTs to complex patterns
of non-adaptive evolution as captured by the M8a model
(see Materials and Methods). The p values for the robustness simulations in Table 2 indicate the probability of
obtaining the observed LRT results where the data generated under the M8a model. If the LRTs are unbiased then
this p value should be similar to the chi-square p value,
but if a LRT is biased to give false positives then we would
expect an increase from the chi-square p value to the
robustness p value. We find strong evidence of a bias
affecting the M7-M8 LRT: for both mammals and fishes
the observed findings of positive selection could easily
have been generated by the non-adaptive M8a model of
codon evolution. In contrast the M8a-M8 test seems unbiased while the M1a-M2a test appears a little conservative.
To test explanation (3) we looked at the relative powers of
the LRTs using simulations with a weakly selected positive
selection class (ω distribution of 40% ω = 0, 40% ω = 0.25,
10% ω = 1.0 and 10% ω = 1.5). Power was measured as
the proportion of the 100 data sets for which the LRT, as
assessed by the chi-square approximation, gave a significant result with p < 0.05. The power of the M1a-M2a test

was only 12%, much lower than the 54% power achieved
by the M8a-M8 test, while the M7-M8 test has the greatest
power of 88%.
Tests of positive selection in birds using polymorphism
data
The fact that the total tree length of the avian multiple species alignment is relatively small means that methods
using just inter-species divergence to infer positive selection are expected to lack power [14]. Therefore to study
the evolution of avian ZPC in more detail we also performed various tests of positive selection making use of
additional polymorphism data. The total number of segregating sites in the 46 chicken chromosomes was 56, of
which 34 were intronic and 21 exonic, of which 3 were
nonsynonymous and 18 synonymous. Tests based on
allele frequency spectra failed to show significant deviations from neutrality or any evidence of recent selective
sweeps. Tajima's D statistic was non-significantly positive
(D = 0.074, p = 0.57), while the H test revealed a non-significant excess of high frequency alleles (H = -2.30, p =
0.13). The HKA test was performed to test for heterogeneity between the ratio intraspecific variation in chicken and
interspecific divergence with the turkey outgroup in ZPC
against a reference set of autosomal data from Sundstrom
et al. [19].

The reference set contained only intronic sites, so only
intronic sites in ZPC were considered. The HKA test did
not show significant deviation from neutrality (p = 0.60).
The nucleotide diversity in ZPC introns, θπ, is 8.9 × 10-3,
higher by a factor of 1.37 than the average for several other
intronic loci sequenced in the same individuals (θπ = 6.5
× 10-3) [19]. The relative increase in polymorphism is very
nearly matched by the relative increase in divergence: the
ZPC chicken-turkey intronic divergence of 0.129 is higher
by a factor of 1.40 than the average of 0.092 from the
study of Sundstrom et al. [19]. The McDonald-Kreitman
test was performed to compare the nonsynonymous over
synonymous ratio between divergence and polymorphism. For chicken polymorphism there were 3 nonsynonymous and 18 synonymous changes, while for
divergence the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes down the chicken lineage were estimated
by PAML to be 12 and 28. Thus there is a signal of positive

0.15).

Discussion
We have tested for signals of positive selection in the evolution of the ZPC gene in mammals, birds and fishes. The
three different LRTs yielded some conflicting results (see
Table 1), with the only two significant findings of positive
selection both obtained using the M7-M8 test. The parametric bootstrapping simulations showed that this discrepancy between the LRTs was not due to biases in the
chi-square approximation to the likelihood ratio statistic.
The power simulations showed that the M7-M8 test is
more powerful at detecting low levels of weak positive
selection than the two other LRTs (as shown in [17]), but
the robustness simulations showed that the M7-M8 test is
biased towards false positives under patterns of non-adaptive evolution like those fitted by the M8a model to the
ZPC gene. The bias in the M7-M8 test revealed by the
robustness simulations was not apparent for the M1aM2a and M8a-M8 tests, and this difference seems to provide the most likely explanation for our results: the highly
significant M7-M8 results could have been generated by
the bias in the test in the absence of adaptive evolution.
Thus we have no strong evidence of adaptive evolution in
ZPC in vertebrates, with the best evidence being the suggestive p value of 0.08 for the M8a-M8 LRT on the mammalian sequence data. The use of avian polymorphism
data in addition to interspecies data also failed to reveal
significant evidence of positive selection.
Our results have some important methodological implications. The potential bias of the M7-M8 test has been
suggested as a theoretical possibility by Swanson et al. [4],
who pointed out that if the beta distribution on its own

(the M7 model) fits the data poorly, then the M7-M8 test
may generate a high proportion of significant tests even in
the absence of positive selection. As far as we know, our
robustness simulations provide the first demonstration of
the M7-M8 bias for real data. The beta distribution is a
natural distribution for modelling the variation in ω
between 0 and 1 (e.g. see figures in the PAML manual),
but a single beta distribution cannot provide a good fit
when the real data have a bimodal distribution with two
peaks, one located at ω = 1 and the other at an intermediate ω above 0 but less than 0.5. Thus the addition of an
extra ω class in the M8 model is likely to give a large
increase in likelihood, and if the position of the ω = 1
peak is overestimated at all then positive selection will be
inferred.
We tested these ideas of why the M7-M8 LRT can lead to
an excess of false positives by performing some additional
robustness simulations under simple codon models. In all
other respects except the ω distribution our set of 100 replicates was generated with the same parameters as the 5taxon tree datasets detailed in Wong et al. [17]. The simulated ω distribution was 40% ω = 0, 40% ω = 0.25 and
20% ω = 1.0. In 18 out of 100 replicates the M7-M8 test
gave a false positive result at the 5% level using the chisquare method, and six replicates gave a false positive
result at the 1% level. So these robustness simulations
confirm that the M7-M8 test can be biased under fairly
simple scenarios. Since the scenario we have simulated
seems biologically reasonable, i.e. a combination of some
sites under very strong negative selection, some sites
under moderate negative selection, and a small proportion of sites evolving neutrally, we believe that evidence of
adaptive evolution obtained with the M7-M8 LRT alone
should be treated with caution.
We also considered the performance of the M1a-M2a and
M8a-M8 LRTs for the same simulated data, which led to
an excess of false positives with the M7-M8 test. In none
of the 100 replicates did the M1a-M2a test give a false positive result at the 5% level, indicating a conservative test.
For the M8a-M8 test the levels of false positives were
slightly elevated above expectations with nine false positives at the 5% level and two false positives at the 1%
level, but these levels are reasonably close to null expectations. Thus the choice between the M1a-M2a and M8a-M8
LRTs can be seen as a tradeoff: the M8a-M8 test has greater
power but also a greater risk of false positives.
We should emphasize the importance of distinguishing
between problems with specific LRTs and the general
approach using LRTs to test for adaptive evolution by
comparing the likelihoods of different models of ω variation among codons. Our robustness simulations indicate
that the M7-M8 LRT tends to produce false positives in the

absence of adaptive evolution. Such a failure of a specific
LRT does not mean that the general approach of LRTs is
wrong, just that certain LRTs may fail under certain conditions. The more we know about how genes evolve the better we will be able to design models of among site
variation in ω.
One final methodological point concerns the effects of
changes in the size of the dataset. In a preliminary version
of this study we considered a more limited dataset of just
four fish species. For this dataset we obtained significant
results of p = 0.044 for the M1a-M2a LRT and p = 0.032
for the M8a-M8 LRT. The addition of two more species
(Carassius auratus and Pimephales promelas) increased the
M1a-M2a p value to 0.97 and the M8a-M8 p value to 0.19.
These two species only increased total length slightly from
4.14 to 4.49, so it is surprising that they had such a large
effect on the M8a-M8 test. It seems likely that small datasets are likely to lead imprecise maximum likelihood estimates of parameters, particularly when fitting parameter
rich codon models. Such concerns may be addressed by
using Bayesian approaches to the inference of adaptive
evolution, [20,21] which should account for parameter
uncertainty.

Conclusion
So as far as biological conclusions go, we have no strong
evidence of adaptive evolution in ZPC in vertebrates. This
result obviously means that we cannot use comparative
methods to analyse the selective causes of adaptive evolution in ZPC. Our study does however raise some interesting methodological issues, in particular we show that the
patterns of evolution in the ZPC gene cause the M7-M8
LRT to be heavily biased towards false inference of adaptive evolution. Thus we urge caution in the use of the M7M8 LRT, and would suggest the M1a-M2a and M8a-M8
LRTs as more reliable tests of adaptive evolution. Much of
the evidence for pervasive adaptive evolution in reproductive proteins has been obtained using the M7-M8 LRT and

Sequencing of avian ZPC sequences
We have included eleven bird species from the order Galliformes in this study: black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), chicken
(Gallus gallus), grey partridge (Perdix perdix), hazel
grouse (Bonasa bonasia), pheasant (Phasianus colchicus),
ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), quail (Coturnix coturnix),
red grouse (Lagopus lagopus), red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and
turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). In addition, we sequenced
23 male chickens. For information about these individuals see Sundstrom et al. [19]. The ZPC gene is located on
chromosome 10 in chicken, according to the UCSC
chicken genome browser. The gene has been fully
sequenced in chicken [Genbank:AB031033], hence the
exon-intron boundaries are known. We intended to
sequence the entire gene, including exons and introns for
all eleven species and the 23 male chickens. Despite many
efforts, certain regions (nucleotides 1–373 and 715–773
in grey partridge, 315–372 and 411–445 in hazel grouse,
915–1007 in red-legged partridge and 414–442 and 790–
815 in ptarmigan) could not be PCR amplified and were
therefore not analyzed in these species.

We PCR amplified the gene from genomic DNA in five
overlapping fragments using the following primer combinations: ZPC1051F/ZPCe2R, ZPCe2F/ZPCe5R, ZPCe4F/
ZPCe6R, ZPC5F/ZPC7R and ZPC7F/ZPC9R (Primer
sequences, primer positions and PCR conditions available
on request). The same primers were used for all species

chicken individuals were assembled using ambiguity
codes at heterozygote positions. Sequences have been
deposited in public sequence databases [GenGenbank:AY630568bank:AY628608-AY628630,
AY630572, GenBank:DQ004565-DQ004569].
ZPC sequences of mammals and fishes
We collected a total of 15 mammalian ZPC sequences
with accessions as follows: [Genbank:M20026] (mouse,
Mus musculus), [Genbank:Y10823] (rat, Rattus rattus),
[Genbank:X56777] (human, Homo sapiens), [Gen(marmoset),
[Genbank:X82639]
bank:S71825]
(macaque, Macaca radiata), [Genbank:D45070] (dog,
Canis familiaris), [Genbank:D45068] (cat, Felis catus),
(pig,
Sus
scrofa),
[Gen[Genbank:D45065]
(cow,
Bos
taurus),
[Genbank:NM_173974]
(rabbit,
Oryctolagus

bank:U05782]
[Genbank:AY598032] (fox, Vulpes vulpes), [Genbank:AY702973] (ferret, Mustela putorius), [Genbank:AF515621] (steppe lemming, Lagarus lagurus),
[Genbank:AF304487] (Brandt's vole, Microtus brandti),
[Genbank:M63629] (golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus). The first eight sequences were taken from the analysis
by Swanson et al. [7], while the remaining seven
sequences were identified as homologs by BLAST searches
[22], confirmed by annotation, and chosen for their
effects on total branch length.

We collected six fish ZPC sequences with accessions as follows: [Genbank:NM_131331] (zebrafish, Danio rerio),
[Genbank:L41638] (common carp, Cyprinus carpio), [Genbank:AF231708] (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss),
[Genbank:D38630] (Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes),
[Genbank:Z48974] (goldfish, Carassius auratus), and
[Genbank:AF192407] (fathead minnow, Pimephales
promelas). The first five sequences were confirmed as ZPC

orthologs by Spargo and Hope [23], and the final
sequence was identified as a homolog by a BLAST search
and confirmed by annotation.
Construction of multiple species alignments
All alignments were generated using CLUSTALW [24]. The
coding sequence alignments of DNA sequences were
based on the protein alignments. Before we aligned the
avian ZPC introns we removed regions of simple repeats,
identified by the program Sputnik [25] since they make
alignments unreliable and are a potential cause of bias
due to elevated substitution and indel rates.
Likelihood ratio tests of positive selection
We used the codeml program in the PAML package [26]
version 3.14 to perform likelihood ratio tests of positive
selection. We considered models of codon evolution
which allow for variation in ω among codons but assume
the same distribution in all lineages. Likelihood ratio tests
(LRTs) compare the maximum likelihoods of pairs of
nested models, and when the models differ in whether
they include codons under positive selection with ω>1,
then the LRT is a test for positive selection [27,28]. There
are many possible models of ω variation among codons,
and hence many possible LRTs of positive selection. We
performed three LRTs, which are thought to provide reliable tests of positive selection [4,17]. M1a-M2a LRT: The
M1a model (one ω class between 0 and 1, and one class of
ω = 1) is compared to the M2a model (same as M1a
model plus an extra class of ω>1). M7-M8 LRT: The M7
model (a discretised beta distribution for ω between 0 and
1 with 10 equal class proportions) is compared to the M8
model (same as the M7 model plus an extra class of ω≥1).
M8a-M8 LRT: The M8a model (same as M7 plus an extra
class of ω = 1) is compared to the M8 model. For all LRTs,
the first model is a simplified version of the second, with
fewer parameters, and is thus expected to provide a poorer
fit to the data (lower maximum likelihood). The first
model is the null model without adaptive evolution and
the second model is the alternative model with adaptive
evolution, so a significant improvement in maximum
likelihood supports positive selection.

The significance of likelihood ratio tests is usually calculated using the chi-square approximation, which states
that at the asymptote when there is a large amount of data,
then twice the difference in the log of maximum likelihood between the two models (the likelihood ratio statistic 2∆logl) is distributed as a chi-square distribution with
the degrees of freedom (df) given by the difference in the
numbers of parameters in the two nested models. For the
M1a-M2a comparison df = 2. For the M7-M8 and M8a-M8
comparisons the situation is more complicated due to
problems with non-estimable parameters and parameter
values being bounded. For the M7-M8 comparison the

use of df = 2 is expected to be conservative, and for the
M8a-M8 comparison the use of df = 1 is expected to be
conservative.

lated sequences indicates whether the null model of nonadaptive evolution is rejected in favour of the alternative
model.

For all LRTs, equilibrium codon frequencies were
obtained using the average base composition at the three
codon positions (CodonFreq = 2) and the transitiontransversion rate ratio was estimated from the data. For
the analysis of mammal and fish alignments of complete
sequences, sites with ambiguity data were removed (cleandata = 1) since they correspond to indels. But for the
analysis of the bird alignments, for which the sequences of
some species were incompletely sequenced (see above),
we did not remove sites with ambiguity data (cleandata =
0). One problem with the implementation of LRTs is the
existence of suboptimal local maxima, which is overcome
by use of several different starting points for the likelihood maximization. We checked carefully for local
maxima in our analyses of real data, but not in our analyses of simulated data. We know that the PAML search
algorithm did occasionally stall at suboptimal local
optima in the analyses of our simulated data, since in
around 1–2% of cases we obtained a higher likelihood
with the simpler model, but such a low proportion is only
expected to cause a slight downward bias to our simulation p values.

We addressed problem (2) by robustness simulations. We
simulated data sets using the maximum likelihood
parameter estimates obtained for the M8a model. Thus we
simulated sequence data according to the richest model
without positive selection, irrespective of which LRT was
to be used to analyse the data. The simulated data were
analysed using both the null and alternative models specific to each LRT, and these results were used to generate
the null distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic. Comparison of the likelihood ratio obtained from the real
sequences with the null distribution of the likelihood
ratios obtained from the simulated sequences indicates
whether the observed results could have been generated
by non-adaptive evolution.

Simulation studies of LRTs
There are two potential problems with LRTs, which may
generate false positives, i.e. the inference of adaptive evolution when there is none. (1) The first potential problem
is that the chi-square approximation to the likelihood
ratio statistic may be poor when data are limited. The
problem in this case is not that the test itself is biased, but
that the standard method for assessing significance of the
likelihood ratio statistic does not hold. (2) The second
potential problem is that certain LRTs may not be robust
to certain patterns of non-adaptive evolution, i.e. they
may have high rates of false positives. This case represents
the more serious problem, that the LRT is inherently
flawed in that it indicates positive selection even when
there is non present. Both problems (1) and (2) were
addressed by simulation studies performed using the
evolver program in the PAML package.

We investigated the problem (1) by empirical parametric
bootstrapping. For each LRT data was simulated using the
maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the
null model (M1a for M1a-M2a, M7 for M7-M8 and M8a
for M8a-M8). The simulated data were then analysed
using both the null and alternative models, and these
results were used to generate the null distribution of the
likelihood ratio statistic. Comparison of the likelihood
ratio obtained from the real sequences with the null distribution of the likelihood ratios obtained from the simu-

Phylogenetic trees
The PAML analyses require a single unrooted phylogenetic tree. The trees used in our analyses are shown in Figures 1 to 3. The mammalian tree is consistent with the
emerging molecular view of mammalian phylogeny [29].
The fish tree is consistent with the tree in Spargo and
Hope [23] for all species except Pimephales promelas,
which was inferred to group with the other species in the
Cyprinidae family using the stepwise addition method in
PAML under the M0 model of no variation in ω among
codons. Since Galliformes phylogeny is relatively uncertain we used MrBayes version 3.0b4 [30] to analyse the
bird intron alignments. We specified a general time reversible model of nucleotide evolution, with a proportion of
sites invariable and a gamma rate distribution for the
remaining sites (using the MrBayes command "lset nst = 6
rates = invgamma"). The consensus bird tree we obtained
differs slightly from the inferred phylogenies of Dimcheff
et al. [31], but the differences are at nodes with relatively
low bootstrap support in Dimcheff et al.'s maximum likelihood analysis of their mitochondrial sequences, and
when we repeated our PAML analyses with a tree corresponding to the results of Dimcheff et al. we found no
qualitative change to our results (data not shown).
Tests of positive selection using polymorphism data
We used DnaSP 4.0 [32] to analyse patterns of polymorphism in our chicken ZPC sequences. McDonald-Kreitman tests [33] were performed with polymorphism in
exons inferred using DnaSP and divergence estimated
using PAML. The HKA test [34] was performed using the
HKA computer program written by Jody Hey [35].
Intronic divergence was estimated using the baseml program in the PAML package under the Tamura-Nei model
of nucleotide substitution [36]. We performed tests of
selective sweeps using Tajima's D statistic [37] and the H

statistic [38] using a computer program written by Justin
Fay [39]. In order to infer the frequency of polymorphisms in chicken (required for the H test) we used parsimony with the turkey sequence as outgroup.
Polymorphisms potentially due to CpG hypermutability
were removed since parsimony inference may be poor in
such cases. The probability of misinference was calculated
as suggested by Fay and Wu [38] using the average
intronic divergence between chicken and turkey (maximum likelihood distance of 0.129 given by PAML). The
population scaled measure of recombination was estimated to be 65 across the whole gene using PHASE version 2.1 [40,41] to estimate a constant recombination rate
with the unphased chicken data.
