Abstract
Background: In bacteria, non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are crucial regulators of gene expression,
controlling various stress responses, virulence, and motility. Previous work revealed a relatively high
number of ncRNAs in some marine cyanobacteria. However, for efficient genetic and biochemical analysis
it would be desirable to identify a set of ncRNA candidate genes in model cyanobacteria that are easy to
manipulate and for which extended mutant, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets are available.
Results: Here we have used comparative genome analysis for the biocomputational prediction of ncRNA
genes and other sequence/structure-conserved elements in intergenic regions of the three unicellular
model cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803, Synechococcus elongatus PCC6301 and Thermosynechococcus
elongatus BP1 plus the toxic Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843. The unfiltered numbers of predicted elements
in these strains is 383, 168, 168, and 809, respectively, combined into 443 sequence clusters, whereas the
numbers of individual elements with high support are 94, 56, 64, and 406, respectively. Removing also
transposon-associated repeats, finally 78, 53, 42 and 168 sequences, respectively, are left belonging to 109
different clusters in the data set. Experimental analysis of selected ncRNA candidates in Synechocystis
PCC6803 validated new ncRNAs originating from the fabF-hoxH and apcC-prmA intergenic spacers and
three highly expressed ncRNAs belonging to the Yfr2 family of ncRNAs. Yfr2a promoter-luxAB fusions
confirmed a very strong activity of this promoter and indicated a stimulation of expression if the cultures
were exposed to elevated light intensities.
Conclusion: Comparison to entries in Rfam and experimental testing of selected ncRNA candidates in
Synechocystis PCC6803 indicate a high reliability of the current prediction, despite some contamination by
the high number of repetitive sequences in some of these species. In particular, we identified in the four
species altogether 8 new ncRNA homologs belonging to the Yfr2 family of ncRNAs. Modelling of RNA
secondary structures indicated two conserved single-stranded sequence motifs that might be involved in
RNA-protein interactions or in the recognition of target RNAs. Since our analysis has been restricted to
find ncRNA candidates with a reasonable high degree of conservation among these four cyanobacteria,
there might be many more, requiring direct experimental approaches for their identification.

Background
In bacteria, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a heterogeneous group of sequence-specific regulators of gene expression, normally lacking a protein-coding function. They are
typically 50–250 nucleotides in length [1], and regulate
mRNA translation or decay but sometimes also directly
modulate certain protein functions. Most stress responses
in the organism best-studied in this respect, E. coli, include
at least one small regulatory RNA as part of the regulon
[2]. However, their functions also include the control of
plasmid and viral replication [3], bacterial virulence [4],
quorum sensing [5], or the acquired resistance against
bacteriophages [6].
In many cases, these ncRNAs function through sequencespecific base pairing; hence they frequently have a (partial) base complementarity to their target RNA molecules.
The vast majority of known ncRNAs is encoded at
genomic locations far away from their target genes. However, some ncRNAs are transcribed from the reverse complementary strand of the respective target and hence these
are fully or partially overlapping with their target RNAs,
constituting the class of antisense RNAs. Except for the
more common types of ncRNA (ribosomal RNA, tRNA,
tmRNA, 6S RNA, RNAse P RNA and ffs RNA), genes
encoding ncRNAs are not annotated during standard
genome analysis. The efforts to accomplish their identification in bacteria can broadly be divided into (i) sequencing the population of small RNAs or (ii) prediction by
bioinformatics tools (mostly) followed by experimental
verification (see [7] for review). As a result of such systematic searches, more than 80 ncRNAs are now known in E.
coli, most of which had been overlooked by traditional
genome analysis.
Cyanobacteria currently raise considerable interest as they
perform oxygenic photosynthesis, fix atmospheric CO2
and nitrogen, frequently produce large quantities of bioactive secondary metabolites and due to their potential for
the production of biofuels. As long as there is sufficient
light available for photosynthesis, cyanobacteria populate
widely diverse environments such as freshwater, the
oceans, rock surfaces, desert soil or the polar regions.
Their adaptation to vastly different environmental conditions suggests the existence of sophisticated regulatory
mechanisms. Therefore, various types of regulatory RNA
can be expected that interplay with the different signal
transduction pathways and stress responses. Indeed, computational-experimental screens based on comparative
genome analysis identified seven different ncRNAs in the
marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus
[8] which were called Yfr1-7 for cYanobacterial Functional
RNA. In a follow-up study making use of high density
microarrays and exploiting the genome information from
meanwhile 12 different Prochlorococcus genome
sequences, additional 14 ncRNAs and 24 antisense RNAs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/123

were found [9]. Unicellular marine cyanobacteria of these
genera provide an excellent dataset for computational predictions that require comparative genome information
since currently 22 different genome sequences from very
closely related isolates are available [10,11]. However, a
major bottleneck in the work with these marine cyanobacteria is that despite some recent progress [12], protocols
for genetic manipulation are very slow or not available at
all. Therefore, the finding that two of these ncRNAs are
phylogenetically widely distributed enabled direct genetic
work on their functional relevance: Yfr1 is distributed
throughout the cyanobacterial radiation [13] and might
play a role in the adaptation to redox stress or the regulation of carbon uptake [14], whereas Yfr7 was identified as
the homolog of the 6S RNA [15] which is found in all
eubacteria [16]. However, for efficient genetic and biochemical analysis of cyanobacterial ncRNAs it would be
very desirable to identify a set of ncRNA candidate genes
in model cyanobacteria that are easy to manipulate and
for which extended mutant, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets are available. In addition to Yfr1 which
exists in all four unicellular cyanobacteria targeted here
[13], the only currently known ncRNAs in model cyanobacteria are an antisense RNA covering the ferric uptake
regulator gene furA in Anabaena PCC 7120 over its full
length [17], and the antisense RNA IsrR, regulating the
gene for the light-absorbing protein IsiA under conditions
of iron limitation and redox stress in the unicellular Synechocystis PCC 6803 [18].
In recent years, comparative genomics-based prediction of
ncRNA genes has become a standard method to search for
such genes within bacterial genomes [8,19-23]. Thus, the
availability of genome sequences from closely enough
related species is a critical factor as is the conservation of
ncRNAs. In case of unicellular cyanobacterial model
organisms, the lack of genome sequences from close relatives has been hampering such studies. With the recent
release of the Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843 genome
[24], however, a cyanobacterium relatively close to Synechocystis has been sequenced.
Here we set out to identify possible ncRNA genes and
other RNA elements (5' leader sequences and riboswitches) in the three unicellular model cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803, Synechococcus elongatus PCC6301 and
Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1 plus the toxic Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843 (from now on: Synechocystis,
Synechococcus, Thermosynechococcus and Microcystis) by
biocomputational comparative genome analysis with a
focus on Synechocystis.

To screen for novel RNA elements, all intergenic regions

lyzed as outlined in Fig. 1, leaving out all annotated genes,
including tRNA and four structural RNA genes. Although
single sequence elements and families of sequence elements that are specific to a single genome cannot be
found by our approach, this procedure initially returned
443 predicted clusters holding 1528 individual
sequences, from which 383 belonged to Synechocystis, 168
to Synechococcus, 168 to Thermosynechococcus and 809 to
Microcystis. However, these numbers were diminished in
further filtering steps (see below).
The analysis was basically focused on sequence and structure similarities. Detailed information on all clusters predicted by our method including the positions of all

sequences is available online [25]. This information,
which we show exemplarily in the inset in Fig. 1, includes
the location within the compared genomes, flanking
genes, a secondary structure prediction as well as Z-scores
and probabilities in either forward (Z, P) or reverse (Z rev,
P rev) orientation as computed by RNAz [26]. Furthermore we conducted searches against Rfam [27], the database collecting ncRNAs, and TransTermHP [28], of which
the results are also given in the online material.

Pipeline 1 comparative prediction of RNA elements and ncRNAs
Pipeline for comparative prediction of RNA elements and ncRNAs. Intergenic sequences of at least 50 nt were gathered from four cyanobacterial genomes and locally aligned using BLASTN. Sequences which directly produced a significant blast
hit (E-value < 10-5) or which were connected by a chain of such hits were gathered into clusters ("single-linkage clustering").
After an additional unification step of overlapping sequences within each cluster the resulting clusters and their complement
clusters were scored using RNAz [26]. The inset shows how this information is provided in the internet, together with the
location within the compared genomes, using the top-scoring cluster (CLID 80) as an example.

ual elements, 94, 56, 64 and 406 in Synechocystis,
Synechococcus, Thermosynechococcus and Microcystis, respectively. A summary of the highest scoring clusters is given
in Table 1[29-31]. The Venn diagram in Fig. 2[32] shows
that more homologs were detected in the Synechocystis/
Microcystis comparison than in any other pairwise combination, reflecting the phylogenetic relationships between
these species pairs.
We previously showed the existence of Yfr1 in three out of
four tested marine cyanobacteria belonging to the genera
Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus [8] and later demonstrated its existence throughout the cyanobacterial radiation, including the four unicellular cyanobacteria targeted
here [13]. It was, therefore, no surprise to find Yfr1 among
the top-scoring elements (Z-score and probability of 4.340 and 1.0) in cluster 139 (Table 1). Although RNA
elements in cyanobacteria are only scarcely covered by
Rfam, the existing entries provided another positive control set: the thiamine riboswitch was correctly identified in
three strains (cluster 149; Table 1) and also two RNA elements of unknown function were correctly found for Synechocystis and Microcystis but not for the other two
cyanobacteria (cluster 216 and 107 in Table 1). However,
we noted the functional role assumed for one of these
conserved RNA structures, the ykkC/yxkD element (cluster
216), to switch efflux pumps and detoxification systems
in response to harmful environmental molecules, may
not apply to the cyanobacterial homologs since they are
neither in Synechocystis nor in Microcystis located upstream
of a putative transporter gene.
Synteny among high-scoring RNA elements
The genomic location of a predicted ncRNA gene or RNA
element in the same sequence neighbourhood in some or
all of the studied cyanobacteria can also be a powerful
tool for finding related ncRNAs. Among the 25 high-scoring sequence clusters in Table 1, 9 (36%) showed at least
partial synteny. The high scoring element in cluster 80
illustrates this fact. The primary annotation gives no hint
about the possible relatedness of the flanking genes. The
flanking gene sufR annotated in Microcystis encodes an
iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis transcriptional regulator
and similarity searches revealed that sll0088, syc2358d
and sufR actually are orthologs of each other (Fig. 3A).
Flanking the intergenic region with the predicted RNA element on the other side, genes ycf24 and sufB are clearly
homologs of each other, whereas ftrC in Synechococcus is
not. Yet, ftrC has been inserted in this genomic region as
the proximate gene, syc2356_c, codes for the homolog of
sufB and ycf24. Thus, the synteny among neighbouring
genes clearly support the element predicted in cluster 80
as an orthologous RNA element between the three species.
Other cases of partial synteny in flanking genes are
observed in cluster 139 since trxA is present in 3 out of 4

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/123

cases and in cluster 216 with the orthologs speB (Synechocystis) and agmatinase (Microcystis), whereas all other
genes are different. Special cases of synteny are exposed in
cluster 207 (rpl10 leader), 149 (thiamine riboswitch
upstream of thiC), 394 (rps2 leader) and 62 (upstream
groES). These four examples represent structurally conserved sequence elements upstream of a protein-coding
gene to whom they are functionally connected; among
them one riboswitch and two ribosomal leaders, thus this
position must be conserved. The fourth example, the element upstream of groES contains the palindromic CIRCE
element (Fig. 3B) thought to bind the heat-shock repressor protein HrcA [33]. Here, we mapped the groES transcriptional start site to the first nt of the nine nt loop
predicted by secondary structure analysis (Fig. 3B), confirming the previously determined start site [34]. These
examples illustrate the variety of elements that become
identified by our approach.
Experimental verification
For exemplary experimental verification of predicted
ncRNA genes we chose two very different examples, one
well-supported candidate with three members from cluster 159 (probability 0.933 and Z-score -2.00; Table 1) and
one from cluster 294 (probability 1.0 and Z-score -2.64;
Table 1). Northern hybridization of total RNA from Synechocystis using strand-specific RNA probes confirmed the
existence of both ncRNAs (Fig. 4). Since we verified the
existence of both ncRNAs experimentally, we decided to
name these two ncRNAs SyR1 and SyR2, for Synechocystis
ncRNA 1 and 2. SyR1 is a strongly accumulating ncRNA
transcribed from a gene in the fabF – hoxH IGR in the forward direction as the preceding gene fabF (Fig. 4A). The
syr1 gene corresponds with a length of ~130 nt to about
two thirds of the fabF-hoxH intergenic spacer (length 206
nt). Judged by Northern hybridization, there was no evidence for a possible cotranscription with fabF. The element predicted with the CLID 294 is located 3' to a
protein-coding gene, too, and is transcribed from the forward strand in Synechocystis 6803. SyR2 is an ~140 nt
ncRNA transcribed from a gene in the apcC (ssr3383) –
prmA (sll1909) IGR in the same forward direction as the
preceding gene apcC. SyR2 is accumulated to rather high
amounts, too, but these appeared lower than in case of
SyR1 (Fig. 4B). The preceding apcC gene (ssr3383)
encodes a short phycobilisome LC linker polypeptide and
is the ultimate gene of a three-gene operon for phycobiliproteins. Cotranscription between this operon and
SyR2 cannot be excluded unambiguously. However, a
SyR2 transcript start was mapped within apcC, 49 nt
before the end of the reading frame. This fact is less exotic
than it seems. At the expected spacing six nt upstream, the
transcript start is preceded by a regular TATA element
(CAAAAT). Moreover, several examples indicate the location of ncRNA promoters within the protein-coding part

The total number of sequences in each cluster and the distribution within the four compared genomes plus the total alignment length (nt) is given.
The elements are ordered according to the highest RNAz [26] probability in either forward (P) or reverse (P rev) orientation. The closer the
probability to 1.0, the more support for structural conservation as an RNA element. Note: hits restricted to Microcystis or repeat elements
bordering transposable elements have not been included. Location is given for Synechocystis PCC 6803 if not indicated otherwise.

of a gene: Transcription of the ssrS gene for 6S RNA in E.
coli is initiated at two promoters, from these the distally
located promoter P2 responds to σ70 and σS RNA
polymerase holoenzymes and is located within the ygfE
reading frame [35,36]. An example from Synechocystis is
provided with IsrR, the antisense RNA that is initiated
from within the gene isiA, although from the reverse complementary strand [18].
In a more general sense these results demonstrate that,
just judging from the prediction, both candidate ncRNA
genes might have been expected to be 3'UTRs due to their
close location to an mRNA 3'end. We did not investigate
their origin from a specific promoter further as we did for
the Yfr2a ncRNA (see below), but the results shown in Fig.
4, in particular the lack of a longer transcript signal in the
respective agarose gel blots, plus specific RACE signals
confirm unambiguously that they do accumulate as individual small transcripts and therefore constitute bona fide
ncRNAs.

A family of ncRNAs that is widely conserved among
cyanobacteria
The vast majority of the ~100 bacterial ncRNAs experimentally verified thus far have been identified in
Escherichia coli [2] and a few other model proteobacteria
and Pseudomonas species. Therefore it is not surprising
that, with the exception of the four highly conserved
ncRNAs 6S RNA, tmRNA, ffs and RnpB, ortholog genes for
ncRNAs are known only among very closely related species such as between Salmonella sp. and Yersinia sp. [37].
Here, with cluster 219 eight sequences were identified
with high sequence and predicted secondary structure
similarity to a family of ncRNAs initially found in marine
Prochlorococcus [8]. There are four such ncRNAs in Prochlorococcus MED4 which in the original publication had been
named Yfr2, Yfr3, Yfr4 and Yfr5 [8]. From the eight new
members to this family in cluster 219 three belong to Synechocystis, one to Thermosynechococcus and two each are
predicted in Synechococcus and in Microcystis. Since none
of them has a more pronounced similarity to any of the
original Yfr2-Yfr5 ncRNAs from Prochlorococcus MED4, we
decided to call them all "Yfr2" according to the first member in this group and then just to add a suffix. Therefore,
the three predicted candidates belonging to this ncRNA
family in Synechocystis are Yfr2a, Yfr2b and Yfr2c. All three
are expressed in Synechocystis (Fig. 5). The yfr2a gene is
located downstream of thioredoxin A (trxA) gene sll1980.
Both genes are in the same orientation but Yfr2a originates from a specific initiation site of transcription,
mapped by TAP-RACE to position 1558975 in the
genome (complementary strand), 94 nt 3' of the sll1980
stop codon (Fig. 5). The other two ncRNAs belonging to
this family in Synechocystis, Yfr2b and Yfr2c, originate
from genes directly upstream of two protein-coding genes,
slr0199 and sll1477. In these two cases we mapped identical initiation sites of transcription for the ncRNAs and
their respective downstream located protein-coding gene,
to genomic positions 2730523 (forward strand, Yfr2b)
and 3398352 (complementary strand, Yfr2c). Therefore,
transcription of these two mRNAs occurs possibly by a
read-through mechanism from Yfr2b or Yfr2c. Whether
this type of transcriptional fusion has functional relevance
is currently unknown as are the functions of slr0199 and
sll1477. These genomic arrangements are not conserved
as the genes adjacent to the other five candidate ncRNA
genes belonging to this family differ in the other three

Types of predicted elements
Types of predicted elements. A. The genomic location of predicted RNA element in cluster 80 and synteny around this
element is shown. This element is slightly more likely to be transcribed from the forward strand as indicated by the direction
of the arrow within the IGR. The length of the intergenic spacer is given in nt and homologous genes are colour-coded. In Synechococcus 6301 an ftrC gene has been inserted into this region relative to the other. The predicted consensus structure of the
RNA element (bottom) consists of two stem-loops separated by a 17 nt single-stranded region. The degree of sequence conservation is colour-coded. B. Four of the five sequences in cluster 62 are located upstream of the groES operon. This region is
known to contain the palindromic CIRCE element and indeed, this element constitutes a critical part of the conserved
sequence and structure. The initiation site of transcription of the groES mRNA was mapped by 5' RACE to occur from the first
G within the nine nt loop that is part of the CIRCE element (bold arrow). The fifth sequence has no CIRCE element but has
been clustered into cluster 62 based on other sequence features. At the bottom right, the perfect conservation of the CIRCE
element in the four compared cyanobacteria is shown.
cyanobacteria. This lack of synteny supports a function of
Yfr2b and Yfr2c independent from serving merely as 5'
untranslated leaders of slr0199 and sll1477.
Sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions
of the 8 Yfr2-5-type ncRNAs suggest a centrally located
single-stranded loop element together with a short
unpaired region at the 5' end that are highly conserved
(Fig. 6). The long helical stem bearing the 12 nt loop is
very characteristically predicted in all sequences to be
interrupted by at least one bulge at position -4 with regard
to this loop (Fig. 6). Interestingly, this feature is shared
with the Yfr2-Yfr5 ncRNAs from marine cyanobacteria [8].
Bulge motifs have been recognized in a wide range of

RNAs as key structural elements determining molecular
recognition by other molecules [38]. Therefore, the conserved bulges in Yfr2-type ncRNAs may indicate their
interaction with proteins. Indeed, another hint comes
from the unpaired regions of these ncRNAs which resemble the extended "GGA" and "ANGGA" RsmA-binding
motifs. The ncRNAs RsmX, RsmY and RsmZ found in
Pseudomonas species contain several GGA and extended
ANGGA motifs [39]. For RsmY, these motifs have been
shown to be essential for sequestration of RsmA and its
homolog RsmE in Pseudomonas fluorescens [40]. Non-coding RNAs containing this motif frequently have a titrating
role on their target protein, regulating gene expression at

Experimental verification of two differently scoring ncRNAs by Northern hybridization. A. The element predicted
in cluster 159 is transcribed from the forward strand (green), in the same direction as the preceding fabF (slr1332) gene. Six
5'RACE sequences support the transcript start of SyR1 to be located 55 nt 3' of the fabF reading frame at position 1671919
(grey arrow). Two different blots are shown, one in which RNA was separated in an high-resolution polyacrylamide gel and
one resulting from an agarose gel. B. The element predicted with the CLID 294 was named SyR2. This ncRNA is longer than
the IGR where it is encoded (~140 nt versus 94 nt spacer length). A transcript start was found by 5' RACE within apcC, 49 nt
before the end of apcC (grey arrow). The schemes are drawn to scale. All protein-coding genes are displayed in gray, all ncRNA
genes in green; M, molecular mass marker, R, lane in the RNA gel before blotting, H, hybridization.

All three predicted members of the Yfr2 family of ncRNAs are expressed in Synechocystis 6803
Figure 5
All three predicted members of the Yfr2 family of ncRNAs are expressed in Synechocystis 6803. The three predicted ncRNAs belonging to cluster 219 are expressed in Synechocystis 6803. The ncRNA Yfr2a is ~80 nt long. All initiation
sites of transcription were mapped by 5' RACE (grey arrows). The transcriptional start site of Yfr2a was mapped unambiguously to position 1558975 (complementary strand), 93 nt downstream the end of the trxA (sll1980) open reading frame. Yfr2b
and Yfr2c are initiated at positions 2730523 and 3398352 (complementary strand), respectively. All three ncRNAs are very
strongly expressed in Synechocystis 6803. However, the fact that it was not possible to map a specific initiation site of transcription for the genes slr0199 and sll1477 indicates their occasional or standard cotranscription with Yfr2b and Yfr2c. This assumption is further supported by some RNA fragments of higher molecular weight hybridizing with the Yfr2b probe. All labels are as
in Fig. 4.
the translational level. It was not possible, however, to
identify RsmA and RsmE homologs in cyanobacteria.
Expression analysis of Yfr2a
Starting with the mapped initiation site of Yfr2a we chose
the region located immediately upstream of it in a promoter fusion experiment with luxAB genes to prove that it
actually does contain a functional promoter. Moreover, if
the expression of an ncRNA is regulated under certain
environmental conditions this sometimes gives a hint
into which processes this ncRNA might be involved in. As

controls, we chose the same DNA fragment in reverse orientation and amplified and cloned the psbA2 (slr1311)
promoter, again in both orientations.
The 300 nt upstream of Yfr2a provided indeed very strong
expression to the reporter genes – under all tested conditions the measured fluorescence values were comparable
to those obtained from the psbA2 promoter-driven luciferase gene expression, whereas the reverse orientation of
the same fragments provided very low activity only (Fig
7A). Under cold temperature (12°C) and heat (43°C)

Figure 6 alignments and secondary structure predictions of the 8 Yfr2-type ncRNAs identify conserved structure and
sequence motifs
Sequence
Sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions of the 8 Yfr2-type ncRNAs identify conserved structure and sequence motifs. A. Secondary structure predictions of the three experimentally confirmed ncRNAs Yfr2a, Yfr2b
and Yfr2c from Synechocystis 6803. They share a 12 nt central loop on a long helical stem that is interrupted by at least one
bulge at position -4 with regard to this loop (red arrows). Moreover, the first 8–13 nt are predicted to be single-stranded. B.
Alignments of all eight predicted Yfr2-type DNA sequences reveal two extremely conserved nucleotide stretches: the short
unpaired region at the 5' end as well as the predicted centrally located loop element (labelled by horizontal black arrows). In
contrast, the region between these two elements is not conserved in sequence or in its length. The single nucleotide breaking
the stem at position -4 with regard to the loop is indicated by a red arrow. Note that the 3' end of the transcribed region has
not been mapped. Those sequence stretches resembling "GGA" and "ANGGA" motifs are labelled by a set of black arrows.
The non-Synechocystis 6803 sequences are one from Thermosynechococcus (Thermo_Yfr2), two from Microcystis (Micro_Yfr2a
and Micro_Yfr2b) and two from Synechococcus 6301 (6301_Yfr2a and 6301_Yfr2b).

stress the activity of both promoters drops (Fig 7C, D), a
possible pleiotropic effect. Under light stress, however,
the activity of both promoters is stimulated. Whereas the
activity of the psbA2 promoter is increased up to 250%,
the Yfr2a promoter becomes activated up to 300% (Fig
7B). This is all the more striking since psbA2 frequently

serves as an example for a typical light-inducible promoter.
Six Clusters containing repetitive sequences

some cyanobacteria is the high number of repetitive

luciferase expression driven by the Yfr2a or the psbA2 (slr1311) promoter under standard growth conditions. All promoter

sequences, mobile genetic elements and transposonrelated sequences.
Indeed, the output from our prediction pipeline was contaminated by imperfect inverted repeat sequences flanking different families of IS elements, mainly in Microcystis,
and to a lesser extent in Synechocystis. If subtracted from
the data set, the total number of predicted RNA elements
(numbers in brackets correspond to high-scoring elements) in Synechocystis, Synechococcus, Thermosynechococcus
and Microcystis drops to 339 (78), 160 (53), 144 (42) and
426 (168). Such repetitive sequences were collected in six
sequence clusters, namely #12, #25, #38, #68, #270 and
#383 with 78, 87, 153, 83, 42 and 16 individual

sequences, respectively. All 459 sequences from these
clusters have been collected in a separate file and are
accessible from our website [41].

Conclusion
Comparative genomics-based prediction of ncRNA genes
and candidate ncRNA genes is more and more becoming
a standard tool to search for such genes within bacterial
genomes [8,19-23].
Here we provide the first list of ncRNA and other RNA element candidates for model unicellular cyanobacteria. Surprisingly, we identified with Yfr2a-Yfr2c a family of

Page 11 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:123

ncRNAs which is widely conserved among cyanobacteria
and which become accumulated to high concentrations.
Our experimental verification together with existing positive controls suggests a high number of positives in this
candidate set. However, there are also putative 5' operon
leaders, Rho-independent 3' transcriptional terminators
and possibly yet unidentified riboswitches in this data set.
Moreover, the output is contaminated to some extent by
transposase-related sequences.
Nevertheless, by analogy to other bacteria, including the
most streamlined marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus
MED4 [9], this number of ncRNAs and other RNA elements is probably a grave underestimation. Therefore this
analysis should be considered as a first step to become
complemented by more exhaustive experimental screens,
for instance by using tiling arrays or deep sequencing in
the near future.

Methods
Cultures and manipulation of cyanobacteria
The Synechocystis Moscow strain was used in this study
(obtained from A. Wilde, University of Giessen, Germany,
originally from S. Shestakov, Moscow State University,
Russia) and propagated on BG11 [42] 1% (w/v) agar
(Bacto agar, Difco) plates. Liquid cultures of Synechocystis
were grown at 30°C in BG11 medium under continuous
illumination with white light of 50 μmol of photons•m2•s-1 and a continuous stream of air.

As a promoter test vector we used the pILA plasmid [43]
into which ~300 bp long promoter fragments were cloned
as transcriptional fusions with the luxAB genes. After
transformation, this plasmid integrates into the slr0168
gene within the chromosome of Synechocystis by homologous recombination. Transformation and analysis of correct integration and segregation was carried out as
described elsewhere [44].
Extraction and analysis of RNA
Exponentially growing Synechocystis cultures (OD750 0,6
– 0,8) were collected by filtration (Pall Supor 800 Filter).
Filters with cells were dissolved in 1 ml Trizol per 40 ml
culture, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and incubated for 15 min at 65°C in a water bath. Further RNA isolation followed the manufacturer's protocol.

Small RNA Northern blots were prepared from the separation of 10 to 25 μg of total RNA on 10% urea-polyacrylamide gels as described by Steglich et al. [9].
Polyacrylamide gels were stained with ethidium bromide
(0.3 μg/l) in 1× TBE buffer, rinsed with 1× TBE and analyzed with an E-BOX video gel documentation system
(Peqlab). Transcript sizes were determined by correlation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/123

to Fermentas' RiboRuler low range RNA marker. Blots for
RNAs with higher molecular weight were prepared from
the separation of 5 μg of total RNA on 1,5% denaturing
agarose gels. Transcriptional start sites were determined
by 5'-RACE as described [9].
Sequence data
Genome sequences were obtained from the finished
microbial genomes website at Genbank [45] with the following accession numbers: Synechococcus elongatus PCC
6301, NC_006576; Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,
NC_000911; Thermosynechococcus
elongatus
BP-1,
NC_004113; Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843, NC_010296.
Prediction of RNA elements in a comparative approach
We performed a comparative prediction of ncRNA elements within intergenic regions (IGRs). Therefore, all
IGRs longer than 50 nt were extracted and compared
among the different genomes using Blast. Intragenomic
analyses with the settings given in Fig. 1 revealed a high
number of repetitive sequences in some of the analyzed
genomes. There were 895 intragenomic hits within the
genome of Synechococcus, 2227 hits within Thermosynechococcus, 7198 in Synechocystis and 557014 mutual hits of
IGRs from Microcystis with other IGRs from the same
organism. A large number of repetitive elements N would
produce approximately N2 hits, meaning that the square
root of the number of hits gives an estimate of the number
of repetitive elements. In the case of Microcystis this yields
~746 repetitive elements, which is supported by the finding of six large clusters holding 383 sequences from Microcystis. Therefore, we refrained from searching for
intragenomic similarity. Based on these results homologous sequence regions got clustered together, aligned
using ClustalW and analyzed for structural significance by
RNAz. Alignments were postprocessed using the tool
rnazSelectSeqs.pl with default parameters from the RNAz
package. RNAz was applied in a sliding window approach
(a step size of 10 nt and different window sizes were used,
namely 80,100,120,140 and 160 nt) of which the window
with highest probability was selected. Elements are
termed "High-scoring" if they achieve an RNAz probability of 0.5 or more or if their Z-score is -2.0 or below.
Details about the individual steps and their outcome are
shown in Fig. 1. All predictions can be found at [25] and
[41].
Matching predictions to Rfam and TransTermHP
All individual sequences were matched against Rfam [27]
using the batch search feature provided by Rfam. Mapping
of predicted sequences to information about Rho-independent terminators provided by TransTermHP [28] was
done using Vmatch [46]. Therefore, TransTermHP predictions for Microcystis were computed using TransTermHP
2.06 with default parameters, while for Synechocystis, Syn-

Page 12 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:123

echococcus and Thermosynechococcus existing predictions
were downloaded from the TransTermHP website. All predictions were converted to FASTA-format and searched for
at least 30 nt long hits with 100% identity to candidate
sequences.
Comparative sequence/structure analysis
Multiple sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW [47] with default parameters for DNA. Comparative
structure prediction was done with RNAlishapes [48], a
tool which predicts a consensus structure for a set of
aligned sequences by taking covariance and free energy
into account. The resulting consensus structure was analysed together with the multiple sequence alignment
using RALEE [49]. The latter served also for manual optimisation of the alignment and the consensus structure,
respectively, and for the production of colour annotated
alignments. Colour plots of Consensus structures were
generated using RNAalifold [50].
