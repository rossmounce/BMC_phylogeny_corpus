Abstract
Background: Two component systems (TCS) are phosphotransfer-based signal transduction pathways first discovered
in bacteria, where they perform most of the sensing tasks. They present a highly modular structure, comprising a
receptor with histidine kinase activity and a response regulator which regulates gene expression or interacts with other
cell components. A more complex framework is usually found in plants and fungi, in which a third component transfers
the phosphate group from the receptor to the response regulator. They play a central role in cytokinin mediated
functions in plants, affecting processes such as meristem growth, phyllotaxy, seed development, leaf senescence or
tissue differentiation. We have previously reported the expression and cellular localization of a type A response
regulator, ZmTCRR-1, in the transfer cells of the maize seed, a tissue critical for seed filling and development, and
described its regulation by a tissue specific transcription factor. In this work we investigate the expression and
localization of other components of the TCS signalling routes in the maize seed and initiate the characterization of their
interactions.
Results: The discovery of a new type A response regulator, ZmTCRR-2, specifically expressed in the transfer cells and
controlled by a tissue specific transcription factor suggests a previously unknown role for TCS in the biology of transfer
cells. We have characterized other canonical TCS molecules, including 6 histidine kinases and 3 phosphotransfer
proteins, potentially involved in the atypical transduction pathway defined by ZmTCRR-1 and 2. We have identified
potential upstream interactors for both proteins and shown that they both move into the developing endosperm.
Furthermore, ZmTCRR-1 expression in an heterologous system (Arabidopsis thaliana) is directed to xylem parenchyma
cells, probably involved in transport processes, one of the major roles attributed to the transfer cell layer.
Conclusions: Our data prove the expression of the effector elements of a TCS route operating in the transfer cells
under developmental control. Its possible role in integrating external signals with seed developmental processes is
discussed.
Background
Two component signal transduction systems (TCS) in
plants were first described in 1996 and rapidly ascribed to
the signalling of a number of external outputs, including
phosphate and nitrogen availability [1,2] and stress [3],
usually through hormonal compounds [4-6]. More
recently, related molecules have been linked to circadian
regulation [7]. The full TCS structure in plants involves

the perception of an external signal through membranebound histidine kinases (HK), dimerization and transphosphorylation of the receptor and subsequent transfer
of a phosphate group among alternate histidine and
aspartic residues in the kinase receptor, intermediate
phosphotransfer proteins (HP) and response regulators
(RR), respectively. The conformational change induced
by phosphorylation modifies the response regulator
activity, either in its capacity to interact with other downstream proteins (in the case of type-A RR) or by modification of its function as a transcriptional regulator (in the
case of type-B RR) [8,9]. A wide array of physiological
processes is regulated through phosphorelay routes,

including senescence, meristem activity both in shoots
and roots [10,11], circadian mechanisms [7] and tissue
differentiation [12]. This multiplicity of tasks and the
general ubiquity of most TCS molecules underscore the
probable functional redundancy of elements within the
system and the need for additional, external-to-the-route
regulatory mechanisms.
Transfer cells (TC) occupy the base of the maize
endosperm, directly in front of the maternal vascular terminals, and represent a modified surface, specialized in
the uptake of nutrients from the apoplastic discontinuity
between the mother plant and the seed [13,14]. This
transport specialization, similarly to other transfer cells
and transport-associated tissues elsewhere in the plant,
involves the development of a highly invaginated basal
surface, which presents flange wall ingrowths closely covered by cell membrane, abundant mitochondria and
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [15,16]. Additionally to
nutrients, the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) cells
receive environmental and developmental signals
through the pedicel, which affect their own differentiation and function, and the proper growth and filling of
the kernel. In particular, sugars and the hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin have been shown to reach
the mother-seed interface in high concentrations and
affect the kernel development significantly [17-19], suggesting that transfer cells possibly play a role in the interpretation and further transmission of those signals. In
recent years a number of transfer cell specific genes have
been described [20-22] including a MYB-related transcription factor, ZmMRP-1, which controls the expression of several of these genes [23] through interaction
with specific DNA motifs in their promoters [24]. In a
previous paper we reported the isolation of ZmTCRR-1, a
type-A response regulator exclusively expressed in the
transfer cell layer of the maize caryopsis during early
development, and transcriptionally controlled by
ZmMRP-1. Remarkably, the ZmTCRR-1 protein is
exported from the transfer cells into the endosperm,
where it can be detected at later developmental stages
[25]. In this work we describe a second transfer cell-specific response regulator, related in sequence to ZmTCRR1, and their interaction with known TCS molecules in
maize. Immunolocation and expression data within the
seed for several proteins related to this transduction system support a role for the basal endosperm transfer cells
in the perception of mother plant-borne signals and its
transmission to the developing grain, with the hormoneinsensitive, ZmMRP-1-controlled response regulators
ZmTCRR-1 and ZmTCRR-2 conferring specificity to an
otherwise ubiquitous two component signalling route.
We also obtained circumstantial evidence indicating that
similar pathways operate in Arabidopsis in connection
with transport-related tissues.

Results
Cloning of ZmTCRR-2

ZmTCRR-2 was identified in a BLAST search of a private
cDNA collection using the coding sequence of ZmTCRR1. BLAST searches in the maize genome sequence http://
www.maizesequence.org revealed that ZmTCRR-2 is
located on chromosome 1, and similarly to ZmTCRR-1
(located on chromosome 4), contains 5 exons with short
untranslated extensions, and a coding region of 369 bp.
The exon sizes and the splicing positions are similar in
both genes, except for exon 3 which encodes an additional amino acid in ZmTCRR-1. A synteny analysis to
rice and sorghum genomes using the tools in the maize
database sequence http://www.maizesequence.org links
both loci to a single chromosome of rice (chromosome 8)
or sorghum (chromosome 7). The corresponding syntenic regions are, however, in different chromosome
arms, suggesting that they may have originated in an
intra-chromosomal duplication event predating the separation of these species around 50 million years ago [26].
This event would have been followed by genome reorganisation in Zea mays (additional file 1). A BLAST analysis
of the CDS with the NCBI non redundant database http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov shows homologies to known
type-A response regulators from plants and bacteria. The
alignment of the protein sequences with response regulators from rice, Arabidopsis and maize (NCBI GI numbers
listed in Table 1) clusters ZmTCRR-1 and ZmTCRR-2
together with OsRR8, 12 and 13 [6] and OsRR13H [[27];
this locus is different to OsRR13 in [6], and the suffix "H"
has been added here for clarification] (Figure 1a). These
proteins (with a total sequence similarity of 87.5%) share
a reduced size even for type-A standards (121-137 aa),
and a common C-terminal motif (PRI [L,M] [S,N,K]Y
[I,M]), which is in fact the longest similar stretch, not
present in other RR sequences. Contrary to ZmTCRR-1
[25], ZmTCRR-2 possesses all the canonical amino acids
described to be critical for response regulator activity [8]
(Figure 1b).
Expression of ZmTCRR-1 and ZmTCRR-2 in developing
endosperms

The expression of ZmTCRR-1 has been previously shown
to be restricted to the transfer cells at the base of the kernel, in a reduced time frame during early development
and peaking at 8-11 DAP (days after pollination) [25]. RTPCR analysis of ZmTCRR-2 showed no expression in
maize plant tissues other than the developing kernel
(additional file 2). Within the seeds, an early peak was
detected around 11 DAP and, contrary to the situation
observed for ZmTCRR-1, a significant level of expression
was observed until at least 20 DAP (Figure 2, upper
panel). In situ hybridization experiments using the full
length cDNA as a probe indicated that the expression of

the gene was restricted to the transfer cell layer; no signal
was detected in the embryo, inner endosperm or pedicel
(Figures 2f, 2g). The signal remains confined to this area
between 6 and 14 DAP (Figures 2h to 2j). The corresponding hybridizations with a ZmTCRR-1 probe (Figures 2a to 2e) are shown for comparison; these results
show that the transfer cells express a pair of tissue-specific, developmentally controlled response regulators.
Regulation of the expression of ZmTCRR genes

The promoter of ZmTCRR-1 has been previously shown
to contain cis elements (called TC-boxes) responsive to a
TC specific transcription factor, ZmMRP-1 [24]. A bioinformatic analysis of a 1700 base pair ZmTCRR-2 promoter fragment showed several motifs similar to the TCbox, TATCT at -266, -182 and -166 bp (inverted) from
the translation start site. The 1700 bp upstream sequence
was fused to the UidA reporter gene and cotransformed
in onion epithelial cells with a constitutive ZmMRP-1
construct. After chromogenic detection, a positive transactivation result was obtained (additional file 3), indicating that ZmMRP-1 is a direct transactivator of ZmTCRR-

ellic acid) produced a significant variation in the levels of
transcript (not shown). We used a detached leaf system
similar to the one described in references [2] and [28] to
further check the effect of cytokinins on the expression of
ZmTCRR-1 and -2 due to their structural similarity to
TCS molecules. This system allowed the monitorization
of the effect of the hormone treatment through the quantitation of well established inducible markers [28,29],
which have not been described in the maize kernel to our
knowledge. None of the ZmTCRRs was detected in the
leaves, regardless of the treatment. In summary, our
experiments did not provide any evidence for an involvement of cytokinin in the transcriptional activation of the
ZmTCRRs (additional file 4).

2. Considering their identity as type-A response regulators, we tested the possible activation of both ZmTCRR-1

media containing different hormones and performing
either Northern Blot or qRT-PCR as detailed in Material

Expression pattern of candidate TCS upstream components

Two elements are positioned upstream of response regulators in the phosphorelay TCS pathways in plants, the
sensory hybrid kinases and the intermediate histidine
phosphotransfer proteins. In order to identify potential
components of the TCS pathway in which ZmTCRR-1/-2
participate, we have analysed the expression pattern of
these elements along seed development.
Three HPs are currently known in maize [30], located
on chromosomes 1, 2 and 4. A homology search did not
show any additional loci in the maize genome. All three
genes were found to be almost ubiquitously expressed
(additional file 2). We found, however, differential expression patterns along seed development (Figures 3a and 3b,
values normalised to the expression of the internal control ZmFKBP66; [31]). ZmHP1 and 3, which are 88%
identical in protein sequence, share also similar transcript
kinetics, being already detectable at the earliest time
point tested (3 DAP). Transcript levels peak at 8 DAP in
the upper halves of the seeds and at 11 DAP in the lower
ones. The overall variation in the tested interval is within
one order of magnitude. ZmHP2, on the other hand, displayed a distinct expression pattern, showing stable low
level accumulation of transcript until 20 DAP, when it
raises, especially in the lower seed half, up to 18 times
respective to the previous time point, and 5 to 9 times as
compared to the other ZmHPs. This increase in expression did not extend to the embryo, which at 20 DAP
expresses the 3 ZmHP genes at comparable levels (Figure
3g).
6 non ethylene receptors (NER) histidine kinases have
been described in Arabidopsis [32] and rice [6]. We
searched for additional loci to those described in [33]
(ZmHK1, 2 and 3, which displays two splicing alternatives) and [34] (ZmHK1a2, 1b1 and 1b2) by homology
searches against the maize sequence database http://
www.maizesequence.org. The genome sequence analysis
confirmed the presence of only these 6 separate HK loci
in the current release of the maize genome sequence.

qRT-PCR analyses of ZmHK1, 1a2, 1b1, 1b2, 2, 3A and B
(loci located in chromosomes 5, 4, 1, 5, 3 and 5, respectively) showed ubiquitous expression for all members
(additional file 2), in agreement with previous reports
[33]. Along seed development, the level for the 7 histidine
kinase transcripts was investigated using qRT-PCR (Figures 3c to 3f, values normalised to the expression of
ZmFKBP66); ZmHK1 and 1a2, which are 93% identical in
amino acid sequence, peaked at 8 DAP in the upper part
of the seed, with ZmHK1 being the major isoform at this
point. Both transcripts decreased subsequently, but
ZmHK1 rises again in the whole kernel at 20 DAP.
ZmHK1b1 and 1b2, in spite of being also very similar in
their primary structure (93% identical in sequence, and
approximately 60% to ZmHK1 and 1a2), showed quite
distinct expression kinetics. ZmHK1b1 was the least
expressed of the ZmHK isoforms, except for a sharp,
highly specific peak at 11 DAP, rising over 20 (top) and
almost 100 times (bottom) from the previous time point,
thus reaching expression levels comparable to the other
transcripts at that stage. Remarkably, this expression pattern in the lower half of the seed almost replicates that
previously reported for ZmTCRR-1 [25]. ZmHK1b2, on
the other hand, was expressed at a higher basal level,
showing two minor increases (less than 3-fold) at 6 and
11 days after pollination. ZmHK2 showed an early, 3-fold
increase over the previous levels, peaking at 6 DAP in the
whole seed and then decreased back to its original levels.
Finally, the alternative splicing products of locus ZmHK3,
maintained a stable expression level from 3 to 14 DAP,
when they both started to increase. In the embryo at 20
DAP ZmHK1 and 1a2 are the major hybrid kinase isoforms, ZmHK1a2 seems to accumulate preferentially in
the embryo, given the low expression levels detected in
the whole seed samples at 20 DAP (Figure 3g).

amounts of recombinant proteins. This serum is thus
referred from here on as anti-ZmHP1/3. The immunopurified anti-ZmHP2, however, does not react with the
other phosphotransfer proteins, and allows the independent detection of this peptide.
The ZmTCRR-2 peptide accumulation pattern reproduced almost identically that reported for ZmTCRR-1,
being detectable since 6-8 DAP with a maximal accumulation at 11 DAP (Figure 4a). In spite of the lack of transcription in the upper seed half, the peptide was
detectable in this area since the early developmental
stages. Furthermore, the protein was only found in the
upper seed halves at later developmental stages. The
incomplete overlapping of protein and transcript accumulation patterns has been also reported in the case of
ZmTCRR-1 [25] and very likely indicates that the proteins
are exported towards the endosperm from the transfer
cells where they are produced. The abrupt decay in protein concentration after 11 DAP very likely reflects the
combination of reduced transcript levels at the transfer
cells (Figure 2 upper panel) and dilution of the protein in
the endosperm, where high amounts of storage proteins
begin to accumulate after 11-14 DAP. Interestingly, the
antisera detected two polypeptides within the expected
size range (ca. 13 kDa). Considering the functional nature
of this peptide, this double band may represent a phosphorylated form of the protein.
Concerning the detection of the phosphotransmitters,
the anti-ZmHP1/3 antiserum detected a band of approximately 16 kDa, consistent with the expected sizes of
ZmHP1 and 3 (16.4 and 16.2 kDa, respectively), which
accumulated since 6 DAP and appeared to be more abundant in the upper seed half, consistently with the accumu-

Protein kinetics along development

The downstream interactors of type-A response regulators are currently unknown in most cases. There is however ample evidence to support their direct upstream
interaction with histidine phosphotransfer proteins
within the transduction route [30,35]. To study whether
ZmTCRRs show coincidence with maize HPs in timing
and location, polyclonal antibodies were raised against
ZmTCRR-2, ZmHP1 and ZmHP2, the polyclonal antiZmTCRR-1 was already available [25]. Cross-reactivity
tests using GST- and His-tagged proteins (additional file
5) proved that anti-ZmTCRR-1 recognizes both ZmTCRR peptides, whilst anti-ZmTCRR-2 is specific to this
second protein, allowing its differential analysis. The
anti-ZmHP1 serum recognizes ZmHP3 with lower affinity, which was expected due to their high sequence similarity, and ZmHP2, although in this case this crossreactivity was only observed using relatively high

lation pattern observed for the transcripts. The band
decreased in intensity along development and was no
longer detectable by 30 DAP (Figure 4b). ZmHP2 was
detected as a protein with an apparent size slightly
smaller than the predicted 16.3 kDa, this may be
explained by its high negative charge (-7.17) at the neutral
pH of the electrophoresis system, which causes a faster
than expected migration. The protein was present since 3
DAP all through the analysed interval, without significant
differences between top and bottom halves within each
time point (Figure 4c). No steep increase in peptide levels
was observed, in contrast to the variation detected in the
transcript accumulation at 20 DAP (Figure 3, panel b).
This may be the result of the diluting effect of the reserve
proteins being actively stored in the seed at that stage,
although the existence of a post-translational regulation
mechanism cannot be ruled out. Significantly, the
absence of reacting proteins in several time point samples
assayed with the anti-ZmHP1/3 antiserum indicates that
this antibody cannot detect ZmHP2 at the concentrations
found in planta. In summary, the three intermediate histidine phosphotransfer peptides are present in a time
range which encompasses those of the ZmTCRRs.
Protein cellular localization

The polyclonal antisera were used to detect the proteins
at the cellular level by chromogenic immunolocation
(Figure 5). The parallel use of preimmune sera allowed us
to identify unspecific background from "sticky" areas,
such as the placento-chalaza. At 10 DAP the anti-ZmTCRR-2 antibody produced a clear signal in the transfer
cell area, extending into the endosperm tissue above it
(ZmTCRR-2 panel b). The signal is visible in inner areas
of the endosperm where no transcription is detected, as
previously reported for ZmTCRR-1 [25], indicating a similar transport of the peptide into the endosperm storage
tissue (ZmTCRR-2 panel a). No specific signal is found at
the pedicel (ZmTCRR-2 panel c). Similar experiments
performed with anti-ZmHP1/3 polyclonal serum labelled
all endosperm compartments and the pedicel (ZmHP1/3
panels a, b, c). By contrast, ZmHP-2 was only weakly
detectable at 10 DAP within the endosperm (ZmHP2
panels a and b); the protein accumulated, however, in two
distinct areas at both ends of the pedicel vascular terminals (ZmHP2 panel c shows the one at the adgerminal
side). At later stages (14 DAP) the clearest signal for this
peptide is still concentrated in these areas (not shown).
The corresponding preimmune panel shows no signal in
this area.
Protein-protein interaction experiments

We tested the 3 ZmHPs for interaction with both ZmTCRR-1 and ZmTCRR-2 in a yeast-based 2-hybrid system.
Using a GAL1-driven auxotrophy marker as a sensor for

interaction, ZmTCRR-1 interacted with all three ZmHPs,
supporting a faster growth in the ZmTCRR-1/ZmHP2
interaction. ZmTCRR-2, on the other hand, showed positive results in the interaction test only with ZmHP2, as
neither ZmHP1 nor ZmHP3-carrying clones supported
yeast growth even after extended culture (Figure 6a). A
second, quantitative system based on fluorogenic galactosidase activity confirmed the ZmHP2 stable interaction,
and indicated, on the basis of the quantification of galactosidase activity, that the interaction of ZmHP2 with
ZmTCRR-1 is more stable than with ZmTCRR-2 (Figure
6b).
Function of the ZmTCRR-1 promoter in Arabidopsis

We had previously obtained evidence indicating that the
promoter of ZmMRP-1, the transcriptional regulator of
ZmTCRR-1 and -2, was labelling nutrient exchange surfaces in Arabidopsis [36]. Here we analyzed in a similar
way the promoter of ZmTCRR-1, the expression pattern
of the UidA reporter gene was examined in 10 independent A. thaliana transgenic lines containing promoter:UidA constructs. The signal was transiently visible
in the endosperm of developing seeds within young
siliques, concentrating in the area identified as the chalazal endosperm (Figure 7a), a situation resembling that
encountered in the maize basal endosperm. The GUS signal disappeared as seed maturation proceeded, being
absent in imbibed and germinating seeds. In the seedling,
positive GUS staining indicates promoter activation in
isolated cells, associated to cotyledon and leaf venation
(Figure 7b), and in vascular branching points immediately
below the shoot apical meristem (Figure 7c). This signal
was patent around 7 days after germination and became
stronger around 14 days. Roots and other aerial parts
lacked any signal throughout the plant's life cycle. Within
the vascular bundles the signal localized to cells with a
thickened primary wall, in close contact with xylem vessels. The staining was more intense in cells located in the
internal side of the bundle, proximal to earliest developed
vessel elements. (Figures 7d to 7g). The effect of different
hormonal treatments on the promoter activation was
tested. Neither naphthalene-acetic (NAA), indole-acetic
acid (IAA), benzyl-aminopurine (BAP), gibberellic acid
(GA3) nor ABA caused visible alteration on the location
or intensity of the GUS signal when 7 day-old seedlings
were cultured on them for 24 or 72 hours (not shown).

Discussion
Since their first description [37], two component systems
have been shown to take part in most of the transduction
routes in bacteria and a number of sensing mechanisms
in plants. Some functions have been attributed to particular molecules through mutant analysis [9,32,10], generally connected to cytokinin-mediated processes. In a

previous paper we reported the isolation of a type-A
response regulator specifically expressed in the basal
endosperm transfer cell layer of the maize seed. This gene
is transcribed under the control of a tissue-specific transcription factor in a restricted timeframe and the resulting peptide exported onto the starchy endosperm [25].
The protein (ZmTCRR-1) presents a number of unexpected features in a plant response regulator: it is short,
with the regulatory domain encompassing the whole primary sequence and no C-terminal extension; its expression is not controlled by cytokinins, but developmentally
regulated through a tissue specific transcription factor; it
carries a D to H polymorphism affecting one of the amino
acids in the active centre; and finally, and perhaps more
strikingly, the protein accumulates in cells that do not
transcribe the gene, suggesting a trans-cell operation of
this signal transduction pathway.
In this work we have tried to identify other components
of the TCS pathway in which ZmTCRR-1 participates. In

addition, we have identified a second gene (ZmTCRR-2)
with very similar characteristics to ZmTCRR-1. Both loci
present a similar genomic structure and sequence identity of 62.4% at protein level. However, a possibly significant difference from a functional point of view is the
conservation in ZmTCRR-2 of the canonical aspartic residue in position 13 (Figure 1b). Other than this, the similarity indicates a closer evolutionary ancestry between
these sequences than to the rest of known maize response
regulators [30]. In fact, a protein sequence comparison
including type-A response regulators of Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays (Figure 1a) produces an
independent branch where ZmTCRR-1 and ZmTCRR-2
cluster with four putative response regulators predicted
in the rice genome [6,27]. These putative orthologues are
also short (less than 140 residues) and contain a C-terminal motif not found in other type-A RRs in these 3 species, except ZmTCRR-1 and ZmTCRR-2. Furthermore,

OsRR13H) have been found to be expressed only in
reproductive tissues.
The similarity between ZmTCRR-1 and ZmTCRR-2
extends to their expression pattern. ZmTCRR-2 transcript accumulates specifically at the BETL, peaking
around 10 DAP. This similarity suggests a common regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, both transcripts can be
detected in transfer tissue ectopically induced in the aleurone layer by the expression of ZmMRP-1 [38]. ZmMRP1 is a transfer cell specific MYB-related, R1-type tran-

scription factor, which has been shown to control a number of tissue specific genes (collectively known as BETL
genes, reported in [39] and [20], including ZmTCRR-1
[25]. Significantly, the DNA binding domain of ZmMRP1 contains the SHAQKYF motif, which is similar to the
GARP motif found in type-B response regulators, responsible for the regulation of most type-A molecules [40].
The co-bombardment in onion of promoter-GUS fusions
and the transcription factor under the control of a constitutive promoter shows that ZmMRP-1 is also able to
induce transcription of ZmTCRR-2 (additional file 3).
Collectively, these data point to ZmMRP-1 as a main
transcriptional regulator of ZmTCRR-2 and ZmTCRR-1,
and reinforce the role of this gene as a master regulator of
transfer cell development. Although the existence of a yet
unidentified type-B response regulator expressed in the
transfer cells is possible, all the currently known members of this class seem to be ubiquitously expressed. Furthermore, the apparent lack of cytokinin-dependent
transcriptional regulation in the in vitro cultures and
detached leaf assays reinforces the hypothesis that these
genes are not dependent on a standard type-B RR. Our
data suggest an alternative model in which these type-A
RRs would have been recruited by the ZmMRP-1 controlled pathway and subsequently adapted to participate
in transfer cells' functions, which are not necessarily
restricted to the processes occurring within the cells.
This co-optation would be facilitated by the partial coincidence of the preferential recognition site of type-B RRs,
AGATTC [40,5], and the core binding site of ZmMRP1 in
BETL genes, in complementary orientation, TATCTC/
GAGATA [24]. We have found similar sequences in the
promoters of ZmTCRR-1 [25] and ZmTCRR-2 (this
work), in the same relative positions than TC-boxes are
located in BETL genes [22].
A further point of similarity between ZmTCRR-1 and
ZmTCRR-2 is the polarized export of the corresponding
proteins from the transfer cells into the endosperm, as
shown by Western blot analyses and immunolocation
with antisera differentiating both proteins. A number of
proteins produced in the TC, or in the adjacent embryo
surrounding region, are exported to the pedicel, in some
cases to participate in defensive functions [21,41,42],
which supports the active interfacial/exchange role of this
tissue during seed development. An opposed polar signalling, from the transfer layer to the inner cell layers, is
suggested by the differential appearance of these cells
(known as transmitting tissue, [43]) as compared to the
starchy endosperm cells. Transmitting cells are elongated
along the pedicel-silk axis and facilitate the symplastic
transport of metabolites towards the crown, where they
are used to build storage polymers. Whether the primary
role of ZmTCRRs is exerted in the transmitting tissue
remains unknown, although examples of non cell autono-

mous functions based on protein movement can be found
in the literature [44-46].
ZmTCRR-2 could be detected in the transfer cells,
while ZmTCRR-1 is not [25]. This may reflect differential
stabilisation mechanisms acting in the transfer cells, as
those shown for phosphorilated vs. un-phosphorilated
forms of ARR5 and 7 [47], or a simple difference in the
antibodies' sensitivity in immunolocation. In any case the
lack of the phosphorilation target aspartic in ZmTCRR-1
should be studied regarding this issue.
We have investigated the transcription of the other
known components of TCS pathways (Figure 3), notably
maize histidine kinases and histidine phosphotransfer
proteins, along kernel development, trying to identify
potential interactors of ZmTCRR-1 and -2. All these
upstream components are almost ubiquitously expressed
in the plant and have been shown to intervene in cytokinin signalling [33,30,48,49]. We found no significant
quantitative variation (compared to the ZmTCRRs) for
ZmHKs or ZmHPs expression during early seed development, except for the receptor ZmHK1b1, which showed

an expression pattern remarkably similar to that of the
ZmTCRRs. Further investigation of this receptor, including its tissue location, chemical ligand and downstream
interactors is of clear interest, as it may clarify whether
both ends of the transduction route are connected.
The analyses of the expression, protein accumulation
and distribution within the kernel (Figure 3, Figure 4, and
Figure 5) indicated that all three histidine phosphotransfer proteins co-localize with the ZmTCRRs within the
kernel, and are thus possible interaction partners. The
two hybrid results (Figure 6) pointed to ZmHP2 as the
most probable interactor. However, local differences in
protein concentration and availability of other interactors
may determine the final partner in the kernel, or even
variations along development. ZmHP2 accumulated preferentially in two distinctive patches under the collapsing
placento-chalaza in opposite ends of the endosperm, and
associated to vessel terminals (Figure 5), suggesting
involvement with other TCS components, a common feature in histidine phosphotransfer proteins [50].

Muñiz et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:84
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/84

The relevance of cytokinins in the role of ZmTCRRs is
merely speculative at this stage. However, the current
data about the function of histidine phosphotransfer proteins point to cytokinins, and a number of papers show
their effect on seed development in processes such as cell
division and tolerance to heat stress [17] and maturation
[51], and a careful regulation of their homeostasis along
kernel development [52-54].
It must be noted that ZmTCRR-1 (lacking one of the
canonical aspartic residues involved in the transfer of the
phosphate group) interacts more strongly than ZmTCRR2 with the phosphotransmitters (notably ZmHP2). The
relevance of this feature in planta remains to be determined, but differences in the transfer rate or the turnover
of the phosphorylation state have been proposed as a
mechanism to finely tune the activity of response regulators in transmitting a changing signal [8,47].
We have previously shown [36] that the promoter of
ZmMRP-1 responds to transport demanding situations
(such as branching nodes, nematode feeding structures
and base of developing fruits) in heterologous species. In
this work we show that the ZmTCRR-1 promoter directs
the expression of the UidA gene to the Arabidopsis developing seed and vascular tissues (Figure 7). The promoter
activity within the seeds resembles that observed in
maize for the ZmTCRR genes and the behaviour observed
for the ZmMRP-1 promoter in Arabidopsis. The activity
of the ZmTCRR-1 promoter in branching areas of the vascular system, particularly below the shoot apical meristem also resembles that reported for ZmMRP-1 [36]
albeit the ZmMRP-1 promoter labelled more exchange
surfaces.
A detailed study of GUS expressing cells shows staining
of thick-walled cells associated to the xylem, interspersed
and surrounding the earliest formed vessel elements
within the bundle. The use of Ruthenium Red and Toluidine Blue stains, that allow detection of pectin and the differentiation of lignified and not lignified cell walls,
respectively [55], show that these cells are surrounded by
an engrossed middle lamella and primary wall, (Figures
7e, 7g), which identifies them as xylem parenchymatic
cells. This cell type has been shown to participate actively
in solute transport into and from the vessels, facilitating
the retrieval of nutrients from xylem [56], response to
osmotic variations [57] and participating in the modification of the cell wall in tracheary elements [58]. It's noteworthy that the ZmTCRR-1 activity is not continuous
along the veins but limited to specific cells along the bundle, and is not visibly affected by growth on hormonesupplemented media (not shown).

Conclusions
We have found two genes encoding type-A response regulators whose expression is cell type specific and develop-

mentally regulated. We have shown that both molecules
can be detected in the inner endosperm, and both are
able to interact with known histidine phosphotransfer
proteins. If ZmTCRRs are indeed able to respond to signals arriving from the mother plant they would provide
developmental regulation to the response to an external
stimulus, by which only the coincidence of the proper signal from the mother plant and the right differentiation/
maturation stage from the interfacial BETL would transfer the message into the seed tissue. Whether these regulatory characteristics apply to the putative related rice
molecules OsRR8, 12, 13 and 13H remains to be determined [6,27], but if so, it points to a conserved adaptation
of this type of signalling pathways to reproductive specific functions.

Methods
Plant material

DNA and RNA samples were obtained from glasshousegrown hybrid and A69Y maize plants. Arabidopsis thaliana var Col-0 was grown under long-day conditions (18
hours light/6 hours darkness, 70% humidity, 21°C/18°C).
Cloning of the ZmTCRR-1 and ZmTCRR-2 promoters.
Transformation into Arabidopsis thaliana or onion
epithelial cells

The upstream sequence of ZmTCRR-1 (1200 bases
upstream of the start codon) has been previously
described and primers based on it were designed. 1700
bases of sequence upstream of the ZmTCRR-2 start
codon were amplified with primers based on genomic
information from the Maize Sequence Database http://
www.maizesequence.org and KOD HiFi Taq polymerase
(Novagen). All primers were designed with adequate AttB
extensions, in order to clone the promoters into
pDONR221 using Gateway BP technology (Invitrogen),
producing pENTRY-TCRR1p and pENTRY-TCRR2p
(primer sequences in Table 2, with Gateway adaptors
underlined). A new recombination reaction allowed their
transfer to pK2GWFS7,0 [59] producing a GFP:GUS
reporter under the control of the ZmTCRR-1 or ZmTCRR-2 promoter. The ZmTCRR-1 construct was transformed into Col-0 plants using the method described in
[60]. Ten independent transgenic events were produced.
Two representative lines, bred to homozygosity, are
shown to illustrate the expression of the construct. Activity of the promoter was localized by incubation of seedlings or plant tissues in buffer containing potassium
ferro- and ferricyaniade (5 mM each), 50 mM sodium
phosphate, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/
ml X-GLUC (Duchefa). To check the effect of hormone
signalling on the promoter, homozygous transgenic seeds
were plated on MS (Duchefa) plates for one week and
then transferred to MS plates supplemented with either

0.05% in water and photographed in an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss). The ZmTCRR-2 construct was used to
transform onion epidermal cells (by particle bombardment) together with a ubiquitin promoter- ZmMRP-1
expression vector or an empty plasmid (pUBI-MRP and
pUBI-NOS, described in [39]). The activity of the promoter was observed by incubation of the epidermal peelings in GUS buffer, as above.
Cloning of coding sequences into expression vectors,
purification of recombinant proteins and polyclonal
antibodies

The coding sequences of ZmTCRR-2, ZmHP1, 2 and 3
were amplified from seed cDNA using Gateway-adapted
primers and recombined into pDONR221 (primer
sequences in Table 2, with Gateway adaptors underlined).
The resulting constructs (pENTRY-ZmTCRR2, pENTRYZmHP1,2 and 3 were further transferred into the bacterial expression vectors pDEST15 and pDEST17 (Invitrogen) for N-terminal GST-tagging or His-tagging,
respectively. The constructs were transformed into
Escherichia coli strain BL21A1, which expresses the
recombinant proteins upon induction with L-arabinose.
The recombinant peptides were isolated from the bacterial lysates using glutathion-sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), following the
manufacturer's instructions for native protein purification. The purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and approximately 5 mg of each GST-tagged protein (except GSTZmHP3) were used to immunize rabbits along an 80-days
period to obtain polyclonal sera (Immunostep SA, Salamanca, Spain). The serum against ZmHP2 was affinity
purified using a His-tagged version of the protein as bait,
and HiTrap Desalting and NHS-HP chromatography columns as indicated by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare).
Additionally, an antiserum raised against 6 × His-ZmTCRR-1 (described in [25]) was used in this study.
Two-hybrid analyses

The CDS of ZmTCRR-1 and ZmTCRR-2 were cloned in
the prey vector pGBKT7, and ZmHP1, 2 and 3 were
cloned in the bait vector pGADT7. All bait-prey combinations were transformed into competent AH109 yeast
cells (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200,
gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, MEL1

mixes (Clontech). To further confirm the results, pENTRY vectors harbouring the coding sequences of ZmTCRR-1, ZmTCRR-2, ZmHP1, 2 and 3 were recombined

into Gateway adapted versions of pAD-GAL4-2.1 Cam
and pBD-GAL4 (Stratagene) to produce the bait TCRR1AD and TCRR2-AD and prey HP1-BD, HP2-BD and

mers(x3)-TATACYC1-lacZ) and grown on the proper selection plates (SD-L for pAD constructs, SD-W for pBD
constructs, SD-LW for cotransformations). 3 clones from
each cotransformation plus 3 TCRR1-AD colonies (as a
negative control) were grown in liquid, non selective
media for 2 days at 30°C. Cells were pelleted and total
proteins were extracted using YeastBuster™ Protein
Extraction Reagent (Novagen). 15 μg total protein samples were used for enzymatic assays as described [61],
with 4-Metilumbelliferyl-β-D-galactoside as the fluorogenic substrate. β-galactosidase activity was measured
fluorimetrically in a Wallac Victor2 1420 instrument.
Expression analysis of TCS molecules

RNA samples from unpollinated flowers, upper and
lower halves of 10 DAP seeds, leaves, roots, coleoptiles,
silks and anthers were retro transcribed to cDNA using
the SuperScript® First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) to produce cDNA, following the manufacturer's
instructions. 1 μL of each sample was used as template
for PCR reactions using the qRT-PCR primers for ZmTCRR-2 and Biotools Taq DNA Polymerase. The expression of upstream TCS components in different maize
tissues was studied by qRTPCR, using 7.5 ng of total RNA
from each sample in duplicate reactions and the Express
SYBR® GreenER™ qPCR kit from Invitrogen, following the
manufacturer's guidelines. Reactions were run on a
RotorGene 6000 (Qiagen). For quantitative RT-PCR analysis of TCS components in the seed, the SuperScript® III
Platinum® One-step qRT-PCR kit was used (Invitrogen).
Each reaction (a triplicate was run per sample) contained
15 ng of total RNA and was run on an ABI 7000 instrument, using the cycling and detection conditions suggested by the kit manufacturer. To test the effect of
hormonal treatments on ZmTCRR-1 and -2 expression,
ears were collected at 6 DAP and the sheath was removed
under sterile conditions. Using forceps and a scalpel,
pieces of ear with 4-6 kernels attached were dissected and
placed on culture medium prepared as described in [62],
supplemented with either mock, kinetin (10 μM), transzeatin riboside (10 μM), GA3 (30 μM) or NAA (5 μM).
Seeds were collected at 6, 24 and 42 hours of culture and
RNA was extracted and analysed either by Northern Blot
(with a full length ZmTCRR-1 cDNA probe) or qRT-PCR
(with ZmTCRR-2 specific primers, see Table 2). In order
to further evaluate the effect of cytokinins, the third and

fourth leaves of three week-old plants were excised and
submerged by their base in distilled water for 12 hours to
simulate nitrate deprivation. Mock-treated leaves were
then kept in water for 6 additional hours, while TZRtreated plants were incubated for the same time in distilled water containing 5 μM trans-zeatin riboside. RNA
was extracted and the levels of ZmTCRR-1, ZmTCRR-2,
C4Ppc1 (C4 phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase 1) and
ZmRR2 were measured by qRTPCR as described above.
Each measurement was done in quadruplicate (2 biological and 2 technical replicates). The PCR primers (see
Table 2) were designed based on maize cDNA and
genomic sequences from the Maize Sequence Database.
At least one primer in each set was designed spanning an
intron splicing junction. All data, after evaluation of specificity by analysis of the dissociation curves, were analysed using the Genex Gene Expression Analysis Excel
macro (BioRad) and are shown as values relative to the
expression of the ubiquitously expressed gene ZmFKBP66 [21].
Western Blot experiments

Kernels at 3 and 6 DAP, and the top and bottom halves of
8-, 11-, 15-, 20-, 22-, 25- and 30-DAP seeds were ground
in liquid nitrogen. The powder was extracted at 4°C with
0.1 M phosphate buffer containing a cocktail of protease
inhibitors (Roche). The supernatant was mixed with 1/4
volume of 4 × LDS-containing protein loading buffer
(Invitrogen) and 1/10 volume of 0.4 M DTT, heated at
70°C for 10 minutes. Several replicates were then separated on 12% pre-cast NuPAGE Novex gels (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a 2-(N-morpholine)-ethanesulphonic acid (MES) buffer system. Transference to
polyvinylidene fluoride filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA,
USA) was performed using the XCell II Blot Module
apparatus and buffers (Invitrogen). The filters were then
subjected to immunodetection with the antisera against
the different proteins of interest (anti-ZmTCRR-2 diluted
1/1000, anti-ZmHP1/3 diluted 1/2000, anti-ZmHP2
diluted 1/400 and anti-FKBP66 diluted 1/5000). A goat
anti-rabbit monoclonal antibody conjugated to peroxidase was used at 1/40000 dilution and the immunocomplexes were detected by incubation with a
chemiluminiscent substrate (Super Signal West Pico
Chemiluminiscent Substrate, Pierce) and autoradiography. For cross-detection controls, purified recombinant
proteins (5 ng of 6×His-TCRR-1, GST-TCRR-1 and GSTTCRR-2) were electrophoresed and transferred in duplicate as described above. The anti-ZmTCRR-1 and -2 sera
were used at 1/500 and 1/1000 dilutions, respectively, and
detected as described above. Serial dilutions (2 to 0,02
ng) of recombinant GST-HP1,-2, -3 and -MRP1 (as a control for GST antigenicity) were spotted in duplicate on

nitrocellulose and detected as above with anti-ZmHP1/3
and anti-ZmHP2 at 1/500 dilutions.
Hybridization and Immunolocation

A69Y seeds at 5-20 DAP were fixed in paraformaldehyde/
glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in an ethanol series, embedded in ParaPlast plus embedding medium (Sigma), and
cut into 8 μm sections as described in [22]. For in situ
hybridization, slides were hybridized essentially as
described in [63]. 35S-labeled RNA was synthesized from
pENTRY-ZmTCRR1 and pENTRY-ZmTCRR2 templates
using an in vitro transcription kit (Roche Diagnostics).
Slides were exposed for 2 to 4 days at 4°C using LM-1 silver grain emulsion (Amersham). After developing, sections were stained with Calcofluor White (0.01%) for 15
min and washed with water for 3 × 10 min each. Immunolocalization was performed using each preserumserum pair at equivalent dilutions on 10 DAP sections.
The slides were rehydrated in an ethanol series and
endogenous peroxidase activity was deactivated by incubation in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then
blocked with 2% normal donkey serum and incubated
with the antisera or presera (ZmTCRR-2, diluted 1/150;
ZmHP1/3, diluted 1/400; ZmHP2, diluted 1/80). The
slides were washed twice in PBT and incubated in biotinconjugated anti-rabbit goat antibody at 1/750 (Sigma).
After two more washes, an Extravidin-peroxidase
(Sigma) solution at 1/800 was added to each slide and further incubated. Finally, the slides were washed twice and
incubated in SIGMAFAST™ DAB with Metal Enhancer
(Sigma) until the precipitate was clearly visible on the
sera slides. Reactions were then stopped by intensive
washing in water. Sections were counterstained in 0.1%
safranin. All microphotographies were taken using an
Axiophot microscope (Zeiss).

Additional material
Additional file 1 Synteny of ZmTCRRs genomic regions to rice and
sorghum. Using the synteny tool available in the Maize Database we have
determined the existence of syntenic regions in the genomes of Oryza
sativa and Sorghum bicolor. Upper panels, co-linear arrangement of maize
chromosome 4 (harbouring ZmTCRR-1) and the corresponding rice (left)
and sorghum (right) chromosomes. Lower panels, co-linear arrangement of
maize chromosome 1 (harbouring ZmTCRR-2) and the corresponding rice
(left) and sorghum (right) chromosomes. Red circles and bars indicate the
location of syntenic regions around the ZmTCRR loci.
Additional file 2 Expression of TCS components in different maize tissues. Gel image, 1 μL of cDNA from unpollinated flowers (U), top (T) and
bottom (B) halves of 10 DAP seeds, leaves (L), roots (R), coleoptyles (C),
anthers (A) and silks (S) was used for PCR detection of expression of ZmTCRR-2. The reactions (plus the corresponding negative control, -) were run
on 1.5% agarose gels. ZmFKBP66 amplification was used as normalization
control. Lower panels, expression of TCS components in several maize tissues. Results are the average and standard deviation of two replicates. All
values are relative to the expression of the corresponding gene in leaves
and normalised to the housekeeping gene ZmFKBP66. Samples are unpollinated flowers (U), lower half of 11 DAP seed (B), aleurone at 25 DAP (Al),
leaves (L), roots (R), coleoptyles (C), anthers (A) and silks (S).

Additional file 3 Transactivation of the ZmTCRR-2 promoter by
ZmMRP-1. Onion epithelial cells were cotransformed with a ZmTCRR2prom:UidA construct and either a constitutive Ubiquitin promoter:ZmMRP1 (pUbi-MRP) or a mock Ubiquitin promoter:empty vector (p Ubi-NOS), and
promoter activation was detected by GUS staining. pUbi-MRP/ZmTCRR1prom:UidA and 35S-CMVprom:UidA transformations were performed as
controls. Each experiment was done in triplicate. a, representative images
of bombardment results, showing the most densely stained areas. b, total
transformed cells in each experiment (including all replicates).
Additional file 4 Effect of cytokinins on ZmTCRRs expression.
Detached leaves of wild type, three weeks-old plants were treated with
trans-zeatin riboside (5 μM) and the transcript levels of both ZmTCRRs and 2
cytokinin inducible markers were determined. No signal was detectable for
any of the TC transcripts, while C4Ppc1 and ZmRR-2 responded with 3-fold
and over 600-fold inductions upon treatment, respectively. Transcript levels
are normalized to the expression of ZmFKBP66 and referred to the mock
sample. Mock, distilled water; TZR, 5 μM trans-zeatin riboside; ND, not
detected.
Additional file 5 Cross-reaction tests for the sera used in this work. a,
His- or GST-tagged ZmTCRR-1 and -2 were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF and detected with anti-ZmTCRR-1 (right panel) or anti-ZmTCRR-2 (left panel). Lanes 1 and 4, 6×His-TCRR-1 (16,67 kDa); lanes 2 and 5,
GST-TCRR-2 (41,53 kDa); lanes 3 and 6, GST-TCRR-1 (41,55 kDa). The antiZmTCRR-2 serum (generated against GST-TCRR-2) strongly detects GSTTCRR-2 and weakly GST-TCRR-1, probably due to recognition of the GST tag,
as 6×His-TCRR-1 is not detected. Anti-ZmTCRR-1, on the other hand, reacts
to all three recombinant proteins. A scheme of the PageRuler Unstained
Protein ladder (Fermentas) is shown at the left for size determination. b,
serial dilutions of GST-tagged ZmHP1,-2, -3 and -MRP1 (2 to 0,02 ng) were
spotted on nitrocellulose and reacted with anti-ZmHP1/3 (left) or antiZmHP2 (right) sera. While the anti-ZmHP1/3 serum detects all three histidine phosphotransfer proteins and the GST tag attached to ZmMRP-1, antiZmHP2 is specific for ZmHP2.
