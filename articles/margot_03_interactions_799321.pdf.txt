Abstract
Background: In mammals, epigenetic information is established and maintained via the
postreplicative methylation of cytosine residues by the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1, Dnmt3a
and Dnmt3b. Dnmt1 is required for maintenance methylation whereas Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are
responsible for de novo methylation. Contrary to Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b, the isolated C-terminal
region of Dnmt1 is catalytically inactive, despite the presence of the sequence motifs typical of
active DNA methyltransferases. Deletion analysis has revealed that a large part of the N-terminal
domain is required for enzymatic activity.
Results: The role played by the N-terminal domain in this regulation has been investigated using
the yeast two-hybrid system. We show here the presence of an intra-molecular interaction in
Dnmt1 but not in Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b. This interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and
was localized by deletion mapping. Furthermore, a systematic analysis of interactions among the
Dnmt family members has revealed that DNMT3L interacts with the C-terminal domain of Dnmt3a
and Dnmt3b.
Conclusions: The lack of methylating ability of the isolated C-terminal domain of Dnmt1 could be
explained in part by a physical interaction between N- and C-terminal domains that apparently is
required for activation of the catalytic domain. Our deletion analysis suggests that the tertiary
structure of Dnmt1 is important in this process rather than a particular sequence motif.
Furthermore, the interaction between DNMT3L and the C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a and
Dnmt3b suggests a mechanism whereby the enzymatically inactive DNMT3L brings about the
methylation of its substrate by recruiting an active methylase.

Background
The mechanism of how chromatin architecture is established, maintained and modified is crucial for a thorough
understanding of gene regulation and DNA replication. In
higher eukaryotes DNA methylation and histone modifications appear to be the main agents responsible for the
formation of active or inactive chromatin. However, what

has become clear in the last few years is that the enzymes
responsible for these epigenetic modifications do not act
independently, but interact with one another.
DNA methylation or the transfer of a methyl group to the
cytosine of CpG dinucleotides is carried out by DNA
methyltransferases (MTases). In eukaryotes, these

enzymes are grouped into one family consisting of five
members: Dnmt1, Dnmt2, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and
Dnmt3L [1,2]. Dnmt1 is responsible for the maintenance
of DNA methylation after each round of replication [3,4].
Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are the main players involved in de
novo methylation, a type of methylation occurring mainly
during early development [5–7]. Dnmt3L shares some
homology with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b and plays a central
role in the establishment of maternal genomic imprinting
even though it does not have in vitro catalytic activity [7–
10]. Finally, no particular function has yet been found for
Dnmt2, a protein similar to the prokaryotic MTases. It is
unable to methylate DNA in vitro and was shown not to
be essential for de novo or maintenance methylation in ES
cells even though it carries the key sequence motifs of
DNA methyltransferases [11].
The typical eukaryotic (cytosine-5) DNA methyltransferase is a protein about three times larger than its
prokaryotic counterpart. Based on functional and structural data it was proposed to result from the fusion
between three genes, one of them being an ancestral
prokaryotic MTase [12]. By analogy with the prokaryotic
enzymes, the C-terminal region has been referred to as the
catalytic domain and the N-terminal region as the regulatory domain. Both domains are linked by a short stretch
of repeated GlyLys dipeptides. The enzyme exhibits a preference for hemi-methylated substrates [13–15], a property
suggested to reside in the C-terminal domain [16]. The Nterminal domain can interact with numerous proteins like
DMAP1, PCNA, and Rb [17–19]. It is also multifunctional
in that it contains a DNA binding region, a cysteine-rich
region, several Zn-binding domains and two regions
responsible for the localization to replication foci [20–
23]. Surprisingly, the isolated C-terminal domain of
Dnmt1 is catalytically inactive despite the presence of the
highly conserved sequence motifs typical of active MTases
[12,24,25]. Only deletion mutants that retain a substantial part of the N-terminal domain, in addition to the Cterminal domain, are active. Thus, contrary to prokaryotic
MTases, the catalytic activity of Dnmt1 has become
dependent upon the regulatory domain through evolution. De novo MTases are also organized into a large regulatory N-terminal domain and a smaller catalytic Cterminal domain but, in contrast to Dnmt1, their isolated
C-terminus is capable of methylating DNA [26]. The lack
of extensive homology between the N-terminal domains
of maintenance and de novo MTases points towards a possible functional difference of this domain. In the first part
of this work, we show that the N- and C-terminal domains
of Dnmt1 interact with each other. This interaction, initially detected by a yeast two-hybrid assay, was confirmed
by immunoprecipitation and mapped by deletion
analysis.

Dnmt3L is expressed during gametogenesis and was
shown to be essential for maternal genomic imprinting
[7]. This gene was placed in the Dnmt3 sub-family due to
its homology to the PHD-like domain of Dnmt3a/3b. So
far no catalytic activity has been reported for the enzyme,
which is in accordance with its lack of key methyltransferase motifs [10]. We have looked at the possibility that
DNMT3L, through its interaction with another MTase,
could bring about the methylation of a suitable substrate.
A prime candidate is DNMT2, a catalytically inactive protein that nevertheless carries the conserved sequence
motifs of active MTases. The potential binding partners of
DNMT3L within the MTase family, Dnmt2 and Dnmt1,
were tested using the yeast two-hybrid system.

Results
Dnmt1 interactions
A physical interaction between N- and C-terminal
domains of Dnmt1 was investigated using the yeast twohybrid system. When the entire N-terminus was tested
with the C-terminal domain, a strong interaction was
detected as measured both by the lacZ and the HIS3
reporter assay (Fig. 1B, line 1). This interaction occurred
independently of whether the N-terminal domain was
used as bait or prey but was lost when N- or C-domains
were tested individually, which indicates that the interaction is vector independent and not due to autoactivation.
Several 5'- and 3'-end deletions of the N- and C-terminal
domains were generated to localize more precisely the
region responsible for the interaction. For the N-terminal
domain, the results indicated that a surprisingly large
region is necessary since none of the 3'-end deletions
showed activation of the reporter genes and only the 5'end deletions that removed a comparatively small area
(the first 227 amino acids) were positive (Fig. 1B, lines 2–
8). For the C-terminal domain, a deletion of most of a
region corresponding to the small domain described in
prokaryotic MTases was also unable to interact with the
full-length N-terminal region (Fig. 1B, line 9). Taken
together, these results suggest that the interaction between
the N and C-domains depends on their intact globular
folding.

The validity of the two-hybrid interaction was checked by
immunoprecipitation. The N- and C-terminal domains,
engineered with different tags, were expressed either individually or co-expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3).
As expected from the yeast two-hybrid data, upon immunoprecipitation with α-Flag AB, the Flag-tagged C-terminal domain was pulled down in this assay (Fig. 2, lanes 4,
5). When probed with the anti-Flu AB, the blot revealed
the presence of the Flu-tagged N-terminal domain but
only when N- and C-domains were co-expressed. This
finding clearly shows that the N-terminal domain

Dnmt1 interactions between N- and C-terminal domains. A. Overview of the general organization of the five DNA
methyltransferase family members. Some of the functional domains or structural motifs recognized in the N-terminus of
Dnmt1 and Dnmt3 include a PCNA binding domain (PBD), a targeting sequence (TS), a cysteine-rich region (C), a polybromo
homology domain (PBHD), a tryptophan-rich region (PWWP) and another cysteine-rich region (C-rich). The vertical bars
inside the C-terminus correspond to the highly conserved motifs found in most DNA methyltransferases. For simplicity, only
motifs I, IV and X are labeled. The linker region – a (GlyLys)6 repeat – between the N- and C-terminus of Dnmt1 is represented by a short thick horizontal line. B. A series of N- and C-terminal deletions of Dnmt1 were tested for interaction with
their corresponding full-length terminal domain. The full-length N-terminus and the first two deletion constructs were generated by PCR amplification and inserted into pBTM117c.1 (lines 1–3, see Methods). The full-length construct was used to derive
several deletions using the restriction enzymes NheI (line 5), NcoI (line 6), and BspEI (line 8). The full-length N-terminus was
also cloned into pACT2 from which two deletions were derived using the enzyme BglII (lines 4, 7). The N-constructs 1, 2, 3, 5,
6 and 8 were tested as baits for interaction with the C-terminus whereas the N-constructs 1, 4 and 7 were tested as prey with
the C-terminus. The C-terminus construct was obtained by digestion with EcoRI (line 9). The interaction was scored using two
reporters, lacZ and HIS3 (see Methods). Each member of a pair showing interaction was tested singly to rule out autoactivation. Duplicate results are separated by a slash (/).

interacted with the C-terminal domain in order to be coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 2, lane 5).
Discussion
In vitro proteolytic cleavage between the N- and Cdomains has been shown to result in a large increase in
the velocity of methylation of unmethylated DNA relative
to hemi-methylated DNA [22]. This finding has been
interpreted as the release of the inhibition by the N-terminal domain of the intrinsic de novo activity of the C-terminal domain [22]. This interpretation implies that the Cterminal domain by itself has enzymatic activity. However, this is in disagreement with the lack of catalytic activity reported by several groups for the C-terminal domain
alone [12,24,25]. The interaction between N- and Cdomains described here can partly explain this discrepancy as these domains were not physically separated in
the proteolytic cleavage experiment. Therefore, the N- and
C-domains most likely remained associated accommodating a role of the N-terminal domain in the catalytic process. Lines of evidence for the complex role of the Nterminal region of Dnmt1 in the methylation process
include a) deletion mapping of Dnmt1, which indicates
that a large part of the N-terminus is required for activity
[12,24]; b) fusion of a eukaryotic N-terminus to various

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/4/7

prokaryotic (whole) MTases, which changes the preference of the prokaryotic enzyme towards hemi-methylation [27]; and c) the first ~500 amino acids of the Nterminus repress enzymatic activity [16]. What does this
interaction mean? Since the C-terminal domain carries
the conserved sequence motifs found in active MTases,
this suggests that, at the primary structure level, it is potentially capable of catalysis, but needs somehow to be activated by the N-terminus. The nature of this activation is
likely due to a change in the tertiary structure of the protein. Our suggestion of a conformational change is in
agreement with the allosteric activation model of Dnmt1,
which proposes a double DNA binding site – for unmethylated DNA within the C-terminal and for methylated
DNA within the N-terminal domain [16,25,28]. On the
other hand, in vitro binding studies using smaller fragments of Dnmt1 revealed that a rather small fragment of
about 135 amino acid centered around the cysteine-rich
region interacts with the catalytic domain [25]. These
results are hard to reconcile with the mapping results
described here, which points towards a requirement for
rather intact domains. However, since most fragments
appear to interact with each other in those in vitro binding
assays, it is possible that in vivo the folding of the N-terminal domain prevents some of these interactions. So far,
attempts at recovering catalytic activity by mixing in vitro
the C-terminal domain with these small N-terminal fragments have been unsuccessful [25], which supports the
reported requirement for a mostly intact N-terminal
domain in addition to the C-terminal domain for achieving methylation activity [12,24]. Our deletion mapping
results point to an intact tertiary structure of the N-terminal domain rather than to a sequence motif as the essential element binding to the C-terminal domain and
suggest that the active conformation of the C-terminal
domain requires the presence of the correctly folded Nterminal domain for activity.
Interactions within the Dnmt family
The similar organization of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a/3b led us
to examine whether the N-and C-domain interaction of
Dnmt1 also occurs in Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b. However, contrary to Dnmt1, the N-terminal domain of Dnmt3a (NDnmt3a) failed to interact with the corresponding Cdomain – independently of whether the N-terminus was
used as bait or prey (Fig. 3A). The N-terminal domain of
Dnmt3b (N-Dnmt3b) also failed to interact with CDnmt3b suggesting an absence of intra-molecular interactions in Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b.

Although DNA methyltransferases are known to be found
in complexes with methyl-CpG-binding proteins and histone modifying enzymes, little is known about interacting
partners within the methyltransferase family itself. For
instance, it is conceivable that Dnmt2 and Dnmt3L,

which are both enzymatically inactive, could complement
each other perhaps in a process analogous to the N- and
C-domain interaction of Dnmt1. Therefore, several possible interactions within the Dnmt family were investigated
using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Each member of the
Dnmt family as well as two members of the MBD family
were cloned in the appropriate yeast vectors and tested
with one another. A summary of all protein pairs tested is
presented in Table 1, while the results for the interacting
partners of Dnmt1 and DNMT3L are diagrammed in Fig.
3. In the first case N-Dnmt1 (the N-terminal domain of
Dnmt1) was tested with Dnmt2, DNMT3L, MBD2,
MBD3, C-Dnmt3a (C-terminal domain of Dnmt3a) and
C-Dnmt3b. MBD2 and MBD3 were chosen as their homologues play a role in mouse development [29]. These
closely related proteins carry a methyl-CpG binding
domain (MBD) but only MBD2 binds to methylated
DNA. Both proteins are involved in transcriptional repression through deacetylation and chromosome remodeling
albeit through different protein complexes [30–32]. The
results of the two-hybrid assay show that none of the pairs
tested were able to activate the reporter genes (Fig. 3B). CDnmt1 also failed to interact with Dnmt2, DNMT3L,
MBD2, MBD3, N-Dnmt3a or N-Dnmt3b (Fig. 3B). Therefore, although none of the proteins tested were able to
interact with the N- or C-terminal domains of Dnmt1, it is
possible that the full-length protein could behave differently. Further, our survey of Dnmt1 interactions was not
exhaustive and one of the pairs we did not test (N-Dnmt1
vs N-Dnmt3a/3b) has recently been shown to interact
[33].
Dnmt2 did not interact with Dnmt1, N-Dnmt3a, NDnmt3b or DNMT3L and therefore failed to provide new
clues as to its biological function (Fig. 3C and Table 1).
Finally, DNMT3L was tested with N-Dnmt1, Dnmt2, NDnmt3a, N-Dnmt3b, C-Dnmt3a, C-Dnmt3b, MBD2 or
MBD3 (Fig. 3C). A strong interaction was detected with CDnmt3a and C-Dnmt3b. It must be noted that, for practical reasons, human cDNA clones for DNMT3L, MBD2
and MBD3 were used against mouse proteins in all these
assays. Our results therefore mean that the interspecies
interaction DNMT3L with DNMT3A/B has been maintained through evolution even though mouse and human
Dnmt3L share only ~74 % homology at the nucleotide
level [9]. Thus it is unlikely that the lack of interaction
between human MBD2/3 and mouse MTase proteins
results from species differences since mouse and human
MBD2/3 share ~90 % homology [30].

Discussion
Dnmt3L is expressed during gametogenesis. It is essential
for the establishment of maternal genomic imprints as its
targeted disruption leads to defective methylation of normally maternally methylated sequences [7]. Our finding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/4/7

that DNMT3L interacts with de novo MTases suggests a
mechanism whereby the catalytically inactive Dnmt3L
recruits an active MTase. While this work was in progress,
Dnmt3L was reported to interact in vitro with Dnmt3a/3b
[6]. These authors also showed that Dnmt3L was recruited
to heterochromatin foci when co-expressed with Dnmt3a/
3b whereas it is mainly cytoplasmic when singly expressed
in NIH 3T3. They concluded that Dnmt3L might
cooperate with Dnmt3a/b to carry out de novo methylation of maternally imprinted genes in oocytes.
In spite of well-conserved sequence motifs in their C-terminal domain, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a/3b share little similarity. For instance, contrary to Dnmt1, the C-terminal
domain of Dnmt3a/b is enzymatically active [26]. Also,
the cysteine-rich region, which is found in both enzyme
sub-families, has different functions. In Dnmt1 this
region binds Zn, which is required for allosteric activation
[22,25], whereas it acts as transcriptional repressor in
Dnmt3a/3b [34]. Phylogenetic analysis also suggests that
both enzyme sub-families may have evolved from different prokaryotic ancestors [35,36]. The lack of interaction
between N- and C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a/3b is a
good indication that the mechanism that regulates methylation for these enzymes is significantly different from
that of Dnmt1. This difference is likely due to the preference for hemi-methylated substrates that Dnmt1 has
acquired through evolution – a property absent in
prokaryotic MTases. A corollary of our results is that a
hybrid of N-Dnmt3 with C-Dnmt1 would be inactive,
since Dnmt3a/3b are not allosterically regulated [37]. The
lack of in vivo interaction between Dnmt1 and MBD2 or
MBD3 is in agreement with the in vitro data indicating that
human Dnmt1 can be immunoprecipitated only when
both MBD2 and MBD3 are present [38].

Conclusions
The goal of this study was to investigate the interaction
between regulatory and catalytic domains within the
mammalian DNA methyltransferase family. The twohybrid assay has revealed that such an interaction occurs
in Dnmt1, which immediately suggests the possibility of
an intra-molecular interaction between both domains.
Immunoprecipitation assays have shown that this interaction can occur in vivo while deletion analysis suggests that
this interaction requires an intact tertiary domain
structure rather than small and independent binding
motifs. The fact that this interaction appears specific to the
maintenance enzyme Dnmt1 could reflect the need to
restrict the catalytic activity of the enzyme to hemi-methylated sites in order to faithfully maintain a given methylation pattern. Another type of interaction has been
identified by the two-hybrid assay between the catalytically inactive DNMT3L and the de novo enzymes. Since the
isolated C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a/b are catalyti-

cally active, this interaction suggests rather a mechanism
whereby DNMT3L recruits an active protein without the
need for conformational changes. This analysis of interactions within the Dnmt family adds to our growing understanding of the complex network of interactions that are
likely to play an important role in the regulation of DNA
methylation and epigenetic information in mammalian
cells.

Methods

fusion protein with the Gal4 activation domain and are
referred to as preys in a yeast two-hybrid assay while baits
refer to inserts into pBTM117c.1, which generate a fusion
protein with the LexA DNA binding domain [39]. Each
MTase or fragment thereof was amplified by the long template PCR system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) with
specific primers designed for in frame cloning. These
primers carry restriction endonuclease sites immediately
upstream of the initiation codon ATG. With the exception
of N-Dnmt3a/3b and Dnmt2, all constructs showed one
or another positive interaction, which indicates that they
were correctly expressed. All fusion protein boundaries
and subsequent deletions were sequenced. The amino
acid boundaries of the various N-terminus constructs in
Fig.1 are aa 1–1134 for #1, aa 119–1111 for #2, aa 228–
1134 for #3, aa 630–1134 for #4, aa1-957 for #5, aa 1–
848 for #6, aa 1–630 for # 7 and aa 1–228 for # 8. The Cterminus deletion (#9) removes aa 1388–1620. In Fig. 3,
the boundaries are aa 1–1134 for N-Dnmt1, aa 1135–
1620 for C-Dnmt1, aa 1–629 for N-Dnmt3a, aa 630–908
for C-Dnmt3a, aa 1–580 for N-Dnmt3b, and aa 581–859
for C-Dnmt3b. The plasmids used for the immunoprecipitation were generated by PCR amplification as described
above. In this case, the specific primers allowed for the
introduction of a Flag tag (DYKDDDK) or a Flu tag (YPYDVPDYA) downstream of an optimized translation initiation signal as previously described [40].
Yeast two-hybrid assays
For two-hybrid assays, the yeast strain L40 [MATahis3•200
trp1-901 leu2-3,112 ade2 LYS2:: (4lexAop-HIS3)
URA3::(8lexAop-lacZ), Invitrogen] was transformed with
the corresponding plasmids to leucine and tryptophan
auxotrophy. Each two-hybrid combination was tested on
at least four individual transformants. We did not observe
variation between transformants. Additionally, for positive interactions, the transformation was repeated and
again at least four transformants were tested. The trans-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/4/7

formants were grown at 30°C on selective medium lacking histidine to check for activation of the HIS3 reporter
(++, growth visible after 4 days; +++, growth visible after 2
days). Furthermore, activation of the lacZ reporter was
tested in a β-galactosidase filter assay (Invitrogen). The
strength of lacZ activation was rated according to the
development of blue colonies with X-Gal. The strongest
activation was obtained with the DNMT3L / C-Dnmt3a/
3b interaction. It gave a dark blue color that was recorded
as dark blue (+++). A light blue color that was still clearly
distinguishable from a negative control was rated (+)
while a medium activation, as judged by its color intensity, was rated (++). Negative controls were carried out
with each construct cotransformed with the appropriate
other empty vector, while MBD2/3 or the N- versus Cinteraction were used as positive controls.
Immunoprecipitations
COS-7 cells were grown and transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as previously described [40]. Soluble extracts
from cells overexpressing either the C-terminus or the Nterminus or both N- and C-termini were isolated after 1.5
days using EBC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM
NaCl, 0.5 % Nonidet P-40) with proteases inhibitors [40].
The pre-cleared extracts were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C with mouse anti-Flag (M2, Sigma,
Taufkirchen, Germany). The resulting complexes were
mixed with anti-Mouse IgG-agarose (Sigma, Taufkirchen,
Germany) for 1 h at 4°C and centrifuged at low speed for
1 min. After 2 x 10 min washing with excess EBC buffer,
the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and
mixed with 2 x Laemmli loading buffer. The mixture was
boiled for 5 min and the supernatant loaded onto an 8 %
SDS-PAGE. Western blotting conditions have been
described previously [40].

Authors' Contributions
