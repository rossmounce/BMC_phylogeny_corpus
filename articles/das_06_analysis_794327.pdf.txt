Abstract
Background: Nanoarchaeum equitans, the only known hyperthermophilic archaeon exhibiting parasitic life
style, has raised some new questions about the evolution of the Archaea and provided a model of choice
to study the genome landmarks correlated with thermo-parasitic adaptation. In this context, we have
analyzed the genome and proteome composition of N. equitans and compared the same with those of
other mesophiles, hyperthermophiles and obligatory host-associated organisms.
Results: Analysis of nucleotide, codon and amino acid usage patterns in N. equitans indicates the presence
of distinct selective constraints, probably due to its adaptation to a thermo-parasitic life-style. Among the
conspicuous characteristics featuring its hyperthermophilic adaptation are overrepresentation of purine
bases in protein coding sequences, higher GC-content in tRNA/rRNA sequences, distinct synonymous
codon usage, enhanced usage of aromatic and positively charged residues, and decreased frequencies of
polar uncharged residues, as compared to those in mesophilic organisms. Positively charged amino acid
residues are relatively abundant in the encoded gene-products of N. equitans and other hyperthermophiles,
which is reflected in their isoelectric point distribution. Pairwise comparison of 105 orthologous protein
sequences shows a strong bias towards replacement of uncharged polar residues of mesophilic proteins
by Lys/Arg, Tyr and some hydrophobic residues in their Nanoarchaeal orthologs. The traits potentially
attributable to the symbiotic/parasitic life-style of the organism include the presence of apparently weak
translational selection in synonymous codon usage and a marked heterogeneity in membrane-associated
proteins, which may be important for N. equitans to interact with the host and hence, may help the
organism to adapt to the strictly host-associated life style. Despite being strictly host-dependent, N.
equitans follows cost minimization hypothesis.
Conclusion: The present study reveals that the genome and proteome composition of N. equitans are
marked with the signatures of dual adaptation – one to high temperature and the other to obligatory
parasitism. While the analysis of nucleotide/amino acid preferences in N. equitans offers an insight into the
molecular strategies taken by the archaeon for thermo-parasitic adaptation, the comparative study of the
compositional characteristics of mesophiles, hyperthermophiles and obligatory host-associated organisms
demonstrates the generality of such strategies in the microbial world.

Background
The hyperthermophilic archaeon Nanoarchaeum equitans
is characterized by several intriguing features. It is the only
known parasitic archaeon and for survival it must be in
contact with the crenarchaeon host Ignicoccus. Its genome
size is only 490 kb, representing the smallest microbial
genome known to date, and yet it has the highest coding
density, encoding for 536 genes [1]. Phylogenetic analyses
suggested that this microbe is probably a derived, but
genomically stable parasite diverged anciently from the
archaeal lineage [2].
The genes for several vital metabolic pathways appear to
be missing in Nanoarchaeum [1]. This could be due to two
plausible reasons. N. equitans might represent an ancient
species, and hence possesses a small genome. Alternatively, it might have gone through a process of genome
reduction as a strategy of adaptation to the obligatory parasitic lifestyle, as observed in cases of many other parasitic/symbiotic organisms [1]. However, in obligatory
intracellular bacteria, many genes involved in DNA
recombination and repair along with the biosynthetic and
metabolic genes are usually lost [3,4]. But N. equitans possesses most of the DNA repair enzymes and the complete
genetic machinery necessary for transcription, translation
and DNA replication. The complexity of its information
processing systems and the simplicity of its metabolic
apparatus, therefore, suggest the presence of an unanticipated world of organisms yet to be characterized.
Most of the obligatory symbiotic/parasitic bacteria are
characterized by the presence of only one/two rRNA operons, a small number of genes for tRNA isoacceptors, slow
growth rate and an overall AT-richness [5-7]. It has been
proposed that at the beginning of the symbiotic or parasitic integration, the loss of the genes involved in DNA
repair favored the bias toward A+T content of such
genomes [3,4,8]. However, the presence of a full set of
archaeal DNA repair and recombination enzymes in N.
equitans [1] contradicts the established hypothesis regarding AT-richness of its genome. Evidences for apparently
little or no translational selection in synonymous codon
usage have been reported for most of the species with
reduced genomes examined so far, such as Borrelia burgdorferi [9], Buchnera aphidicola [10], Helicobacter pylori
[11], Bartonella [12], Wigglesworthia [13] and Tropheryma
whipplei [14] etc. Some of these bacteria exhibit strong
base compositional asymmetries between leading and
lagging strands of replication. It was, therefore, of interest
to investigate whether N. equitans, an archaeon, is also
characterized by any of such typical traits of the reduced
genomes.

also of hyperthermophilicity. Comparative analysis of
complete genomes of several hyperthermophilic archaea
and bacteria revealed that organisms adapted to high temperature require a coordinated set of evolutionary changes
towards stability of mRNA, codon-anticodon interactions
[15], increased thermostability of encoded proteins by
van der Waals interactions [16], larger number of residues
in the alpha-helical conformation [17], enhanced secondary structure propensity [18], higher core hydrophobicity
[19], additional networks of hydrogen bonds [20],
increased ionic interactions [21], increased packing density [22], decreased length of surface loops [23] etc. With
increase in growth temperature, microbial organisms tend
to acquire base A and lose base C while keeping the contents of bases T and G relatively constant [24], and there
is a clear link between a particular pattern of codon usage
and the elevated growth temperature [25].
The current report presents an extensive study on the
genome and proteome composition of N. equitans, along
with a comparative analysis of the compositional characteristics of other mesophiles, hyperthermophiles and
obligatory host-associated organisms. Only A+T -rich
organisms were selected for analysis, so that the inter-species differences in nucleotide/amino acid usage patterns
due to mutational bias could be minimized and any difference in such usage patterns among the mesophilic and
hyperthermopilic organisms could be fairly attributed to
their adaptation to the growth temperature. The study
provides a more detailed view on the genome-wide strategies employed by N. equitans for adaptation to the hyperthermophilic environment and parasitic life style.

Results
Nucleotide preferences in protein-coding genes and
structural RNA sequences
We have analyzed the annotated open reading frames
(ORFs) and the tRNA and rRNA sequences separately in
N. equitans and other organisms with a view to scrutinizing the trends in nucleotide selection and their relevance
to the lifestyle of the organism. Table 1 presents the base
composition of the ORFs and structural RNA sequences of
the fifteen organisms under study. The frequency distributions of the ORFs of N. equitans and other hyperthermophiles exhibit a significant (p < 10-7) shift towards
higher purine content as compared to those of the mesophiles for both non-synonymous and synonymous
codon positions (Fig. 1a, b). As expected, there is a strong
positive correlation (r = 0.89, p < 10-4) between the overall
purine-pyrimidine ratio (R/Y) of ORFs and the optimal
growth temperature (OGT). This suggests that the higher
the OGT, the higher is the selection for purine nucleotides
in coding sequences (Fig. 1c).

The composition of N. equitans genome and proteome are
expected to bear the signatures not only of parasitism, but

While the predicted ORFs of hyperthermophiles are characterized by overrepresentation of purine content, the
structural RNA genes of N. equitans and other hyperthermophiles exhibit much higher GC-content than those of
the mesophiles (Table 1). The GC-content of tRNA/rRNA
genes exhibit a strong positive correlation (r = 0.98 and
0.96 at p < 10-4 for rRNA and tRNA respectively) with the
optimal growth temperature (OGT) (Fig. 1d). Similar
observation has been reported earlier in thermophilic
prokaryotes [26,27]. The higher GC-content of non-coding RNA sequences in N. equitans and other hyperthermophiles could be a strategy to facilitate the
intramolecular stabilization of RNA secondary structure at
elevated temperature. This notion is in agreement with
earlier reports [28,29] demonstrating a significant correlation between the growth temperature and the GC-content
of 16S rRNA, which is shown to be strongest in the double-stranded stem regions of the rRNA.
In order to evaluate purine richness in protein coding
sequences, we have calculated the Chargaff differences in
nucleotide composition (a measure of purine-loading) for
the entire genome. Like other hyperthermophilic prokaryotes [24], N. equitans strictly follows Szybalski's transcription direction rule in spite of its obligatory parasitic
lifestyle. The purine-pyrimidine skew correlates strongly
with the location of the ORFs in two strands (Fig. 2) and
therefore, the ORFs residing in the direct strand as well as
those in the complementary strand, in general, tend to be
purine-rich. It was proposed earlier that the selection for
purine-rich mRNA sequences in thermophilic organisms

may minimize unnecessary RNA-RNA interactions and
prevent double-strand RNA formation within the molecule [30]. The purine-loading in the coding sequences of
N. equitans, therefore, may be attributed to its adaptation
to high temperature. The GC-content of predicted ORFs or
the purine content of structural RNA sequences does not
exhibit any significant correlation with the optimal
growth temperature of the organisms under study.
Global analysis of proteome composition
Correspondence analysis (COA) has been carried out on
amino acid usage of the 35056 predicted gene-products of
the fifteen organisms under study (Table 1) to find out the
interproteomic variation in amino acid composition, if
any. The analysis reveals that the mesophiles and hyperthermophiles are clearly segregated on positive and negative sides of axis 3, which represents 10.6% of total
variation (Fig. 3a). Thus amino acid usage patterns follow
distinct trends in hyperthermophilic (including N. equitans) and mesophilic organisms irrespective of the phylogenetic relatedness, supporting previous observations
[15,31]. The encoded proteins in thermophiles are characterized by an increase in frequency of charged amino acid
residues and a decrease in that of polar uncharged residues as compared to the mesophilic counterparts [32,33].
However, a discrepancy is noticeable in the overrepresentation of positively and negatively charged residues in
hyperthermophilic proteins. The percentage of proteins
having positively charged to negatively charged amino
acid ratio (P/N) > 1 is significantly high in hyperthermophiles compared to mesophiles. A strong positive cor-

relation (r = 0.88, p < 10-5) exists between the OGT of the
organisms and the percentage of proteins having P/N ratio
greater than one in the respective proteomes (Fig. 3b).
Overrepresentation of positively charged residues in the
gene-products of N. equitans and other hyperthermophiles is also apparent from Fig. 3c, which shows the
predicted isoelectric point (pI) distribution of the proteins
of the fifteen organisms under study. A bimodal distribution of isoelectric points is observed with an acidic peak at
pI range of 5.0–5.5 and a basic peak at ~9.5. For the mesophiles, the acidic peak is much larger than the basic peak,
while the reverse is the case for hyperthermophiles. For N.
equitans,the number of basic proteins is even appreciably

higher than that observed with other hyperthermophiles
(Fig. 3c). These results suggest that the hyperthermophilic
proteomes are characterized by a relative predominance
of basic proteins. In addition to the relative abundance of
positively charged residues, the frequency distribution of
the encoded proteins of N. equitans and other hyperthermophiles is also shifted significantly (p < 10-7) towards
higher aromaticity, as compared to that of the mesophiles
(Fig. 3d).
Comparison with mesophilic orthologs
The pairwise comparison of 105 protein sequences from
N. equitans and their homologs from seven mesophilic
organisms under study shows that there has been a signif-

icant increase in frequencies of positively charged residues
(but not of overall negatively charged residues) in N. equitans proteins (Table 2). Among negatively charged residues, Glutamic acid but not Aspartic acid, is used with
increased frequency in hyperthermophiles. Furthermore,
there are significant increases in aromaticity and average
hydrophobicity (calculated using Sweet and Eisenberg
scale) [34] and a decrease in the usage of polar uncharged
amino acid residues (Ser, Thr, Gln and Asn) in the N. equitans gene-products (Table 2). Previous studies on thermoadapted organisms reported a trend for increase in
number of overall charged residues [32,33]. But the
present analysis clearly indicates that among the charged
residues, frequencies of the positively charged residues
increase significantly.
In order to get a better insight into such trends, we have
determined the frequencies of all possible amino acid
replacements (i.e., [20 × 19]/2 = 190 possible pairs of
replacements) between the orthologous sequences in the
direction of mesophiles to N. equitans [see Additional file
1]. Table 3 shows the ratios of the number of observed forward and reverse replacements for each pair of residues in
the direction from mesophiles to N. equitans. There are 36
pairs of amino acids (20% of all pairs) that have a significant directional replacement bias (p < 0.01) and they contribute 6,347 of the 16,614 observed replacements (38%
of the replacements). Several of these frequently observed
amino acid replacements (i.e., Leu → Ile, Val → Leu, Met
→ Ile etc.) are conservative and have already been
reported [32,35]. It is worth mentioning that some of the
apparently high values of the ratios of replacements may
not have much impact on thermal adaptation of proteins,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/186

as the actual number of replacements is too small. For
example, for Cys → Leu, the high value (= 7) of the forward to reverse replacement ratio may not have any structural significance as the number of replacements in the
forward (Cys → Leu) and reverse (Leu → Cys) directions
are only 14 and 2 respectively [see Additional file 1]. The
analysis shows that in N. equitans,the uncharged polar residues of mesophilic proteins have undergone massive
replacement by positively charged residues (especially
Lys), aromatic residues (especially Tyr) and some hydrophobic residues (e.g. Ile, Leu etc.), but the replacements in
the reverse direction are not so frequent. The highly biased
directionality of such amino acid replacements suggests
that the favored residues in N. equitans proteins may have
significant contribution to enhancement and/or maintenance of thermostability.
Surface charge distribution
In order to examine the structural implications, if any, of
higher usage of the positively charged residues in N. equitans proteins, appropriate representatives of orthologous
pairs have been selected for homology modeling. Modeled structures have been generated for the elongation factor Tu (EF- Tu) protein of N. equitans (NEQ082), along
with the cell division cycle (CDC) family protein from N.
equitans (NEQ475) and M. maripaludis (MMP0176). The
surface charge has been determined for each protein using
Coulomb charge calculation. The comparison between N.
equitans EF- Tu and E. coli EF- Tu [36] and between the
CDC proteins from N. equitans (NEQ475) and M. maripaludis (MMP0176) reveals a marked increase in positive
charge in the surfaces of the N. equitans proteins as compared to their mesophilic counterparts (Fig. 4). The overall surface charge of N. equitans EF-Tu is -2, while that of
its E. coli homolog is -16. The N. equitans CDC exhibits a
surface charge of -2, while that for its M. maripaludis
homolog is -20. These findings are consistent with the
higher isoelectric points and higher frequencies of positively charged residues in N. equitans homologs. In EF-Tu
of N. equitans (pI = 7.85), the cumulative frequency of Arg
and Lys is 13.2%, whereas in E. coli EF-Tu (pI = 5.30), it is
11.8%. The frequencies of positively charged residues for
the CDC homologs NEQ475 (pI = 7.55) and MMP0176
(pI = 5.19) are 16.8% and 14.5% respectively. Higher
usage of positively charged residues in N. equitans proteins
results in an increase in positive charge on their surfaces as
compared to their mesophilic homologs.
Intraproteomic variations in amino acid usage
To understand the trends in amino acid usage of the
encoded proteins in N. equitans, COA has been performed
on the amino acid composition. Mean aromaticity,
hydropathy, aliphatic index and gene expressivity are the
major sources of intra-proteomic variations in N. equitans,
as indicated by the COA on amino acid usage of the

encoded proteins of 487 ORFs (Table 4). There are two
distinct clusters of genes along the 2nd major axis near the
left end of axis 1 (Fig. 5a). The proteins encoded by these
two clusters of genes are mainly cell envelope or secreted
proteins, which comprise about 15 % of the total predicted proteins under study. The encoded proteins of the
upper cluster (UC) genes are significantly over represented (p < 0.001) by Phe, Leu, Ile, Met and Ala, whereas
Tyr, Cys, Gln, Thr, Asn, Lys, Asp and Glu are present in sig-

differ in their predicted secondary structures as well as in
the content of potential disordered structures. For the
members of the UC, propensities for the formation of
alpha helix structure (mean value 47.77) are much higher
than for the formation of beta sheet (mean value 17.33).
On the contrary, the proteins encoded by the LC genes
have higher propensities for the formation of beta sheet

disordered structures are more commonly found in the
proteins of LC than in the proteins comprising the UC.
Another important source of intra-proteomic variations in
amino acid usage is gene expressivity, as indicated by the
presence of potential highly expressed genes near the positive extreme of axis 1 and at the negative extremes of axis
3 (Fig. 5b). Both axes exhibit significant correlation with
CAI values of the genes (Table 4). The significant positive
correlation of MMW with axis 3 and the negative correlation between axis 1 and aromaticity (Table 4) suggest that
the potential highly expressed genes in N. equitans have a
tendency to avoid the heavier residues including the aromatic ones (Table 5). N. equitans is a strictly host-adapted
microorganism, which can exploit the cellular machinery
of host organisms for its own survival. It is therefore interesting to note that it follows the cost minimization hypothesis [39], which claims that highly expressed genes tend
to use small and energetically less expensive amino acids
in their encoded proteins.

structure. Furthermore, the proteins encoded by the UC
genes have significantly lower propensities for the formation of random coil (mean value 34.90) and putatively
have 5–7 transmembrane domains, while the members of
LC, in general, show higher propensities for the formation
of random coil (mean value 51.56) and are predicted to
have only 1–2 transmembrane domains [see Additional
file 3]. Disordered regions in proteins can be predicted by
the lack of regular secondary structures, whereas ordered
regions (often termed globular) typically contain regular
secondary structures packed into a compact globule
[37,38]. In N. equitans, the probable coil forming regions
are significantly higher in LC proteins (Table 5); hence,

Evaluation of hyperthermophilic signature on synonymous
codon usage
In an attempt to examine whether the pattern of synonymous codon usage in N. equitans follows the hyperthermophilic signature, COA has been applied on Relative
Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) of 35056 predicted
ORFs of the fifteen microbial genomes under study
(enlisted in Table 1). The axis 1- axis 2 plot of the COA on
RSCU values exhibits two distinct clusters, the mesophilic
and hyperthermophilic (N. equitans being a subset of the
latter) genes being segregated along the second axis with
little overlap between them (Fig. 6a). This is in accordance
with the studies made earlier by Lynn et al. [25]. Axis 1
(representing 16.2 % of total variation) values are highly
correlated to the GC3S values (r = -0.93, p < 10-7), while
axis 2 (representing 13.7 % of total variation) values
exhibit a significant positive correlation with R3S (purine
content in synonymous third codon position) of the
genes (r = 0.54, p < 10-7). These observations indicate that
the pattern of synonymous codon usage in N. equitans,as
with other hyperthermophiles, is different from that
observed in the mesophilic microbial organisms, where
the usage of purine in third codon positions is comparatively lower.
Intragenomic variation in synonymous codon usage
To understand the sources of intragenomic variation in
codon usage of N. equitans we have applied a COA on
RSCU of its 487 ORFs. Axis 1 exhibits significant positive
correlation with the CAI values of the genes and also
exhibits slight but significant positive correlation with A3S
(Table 4). Most of the potential highly expressed genes
including ribosomal proteins are clustered at the positive
extreme of axis 1 (Fig. 6b). In COA on absolute frequen-

known parameter of codon usage, base or amino acid
composition is found to have significant correlation with
the position of sequences on axis 2 (Table 4). But interestingly enough, there is a divergence in the distribution of
few genes along axis 2 near the negative extreme of axis 1.
Careful examination reveals that this is only due to the
differential usage of four rare synonymous codons (CGN
of Arg) in N. equitans.
The synonymous codon bias in the potential highly
expressed genes of N. equitans may not be very strong, as
axis 1 of the COA on RSCU describes a rather small
amount of total variation – a situation encountered in
most of the obligatory symbiotic/parasitic microbial
organisms (Table 6). It is worth mentioning at this point
that the strictly host-associated microorganisms are usually characterized by a reduced genome, presence of only
one or two rRNA operons, small number of tRNA genes,
long generation time, overall AT-richness, and apparently
weak translational selection for synonymous codon usage
[11,13]. The genome of N. equitans is also characterized by
massive reduction in size as well as decrease in overall GCcontent, as compared to the free-living hyperthermophilic
archaea. It encodes only a limited number of tRNAs (38
identified tRNAs) and single copies of 5S, 16S and 23S
rRNA. The existence of a relatively poor translational
selection in N. equitans is, therefore, quite consistent with
its parasitic lifestyle.

cies of synonymous codon usage also, the first major axis
(representing 11.5 % of total variation) exhibits significant correlation with CAI values (r = -0.52, p < 0.0001)
and the putative highly expressed genes are clustered on
the negative side of that axis. These observations suggest
that the major trend in synonymous codon usage is gene
expressivity. Usage of 16 codons increases significantly (p
< 0.05) in potential highly expressed genes, most of which
prefer to use A-ending or C-ending synonymous codons
[see Additional file 2]. However the frequencies of G-ending codons or U-ending codons either remain almost constant in potential highly and lowly expressed genes
(except AGG codon for Arg, UGU for Cys and GGU for
Gly), or show a marked fall in potential highly expressed
genes. Preference for C-ending codons in highly expressed
genes against the genome-wide mutational bias is probably a consequence of translational selection [40]. No

Discussion
The present analysis indicates that the dual adaptation of
N. equitans to high temperature and to an obligate parasitism has imposed selective constraints on nucleotide usage
at synonymous and nonsynonymous codon positions,
modulating thereby its genome/proteome composition.
Thermal adaptation involves overrepresentation of purine
bases in protein coding sequences, higher GC-content of
the structural RNA genes, enhanced usage of positively
charged residues, higher frequencies of aromatic residues,
decrease in polar uncharged residues in the encoded protein etc., while parasitic adaptation is reflected in the
extreme genome reduction, presence of weak translational
selection for synonymous codon usage, limited number
of tRNAs and rRNAs, large heterogeneity in membrane
associated proteins and so on.
One of the most exciting observations is the significant
increase in the usage of positively charged amino acid residues in encoded proteins of N. equitans and other hyperthermophiles compared to that in mesophilic organisms.

point distribution (Fig. 3c) and bias in the replacement of
uncharged polar residues of mesophilic proteins by positively charged residues (mainly Lys) in the N. equitans
orthologs (Table 3) – all point towards a strong preference
for positively charged amino acids in the gene-products of
hyperthermophiles. In parallel, there has also been an
increase in aromatic residues (especially Tyr) in encoded
proteins of N. equitans and other hyperthermophiles (Fig.
3d; Table 3). Greater involvement of positively charged
residues at or near protein surfaces may increase the probability of salt bridge formation with negatively charged
residues, while simultaneous increase in aromatic residues may strengthen the cation-π interaction. When a cationic side chain comes near an aromatic side chain within
a protein, the geometry is known to be biased towards one
that would experience a favorable cation-π interaction
[41]. It was suggested earlier that both salt-bridge and cation-π interactions may play important roles in thermostability [42]. Tyrosine, by itself, may also contribute to
protein thermostability [43]. Selective increase in Lys/Arg
and aromatic residues in N. equitans may, therefore, be a
strategy of survival at high temperature. A recent study on
atomic simulation has revealed that among the charged
residues, Lys has much greater number of accessible
rotamers than Arg and may entropically stabilize the
folded states of proteins [44].
Marked reduction in the frequencies of uncharged polar
residues may also contribute to thermostability by avoiding the deamination and backbone cleavages involving
Asn and Gln, which can be catalyzed by Ser and Thr
[45,46]. According to the Sweet and Eisenberg scale [34],
there is a significant increase in average hydrophobicity in
the encoded proteins of N. equitans, as compared to their
mesophilic orthologs. This may also be a part of the measures taken for environmental adaptation. The KyteDoolittle scale [47], however, did not indicate any significant difference in average hydrophobicity between these
two groups of proteins. It was suggested earlier by Haney

et al. [32] that some of the established hydrophobicity
scales are strongly correlated to the differences between
the proteins of mesophiles and thermophiles, whereas
others are not. Replacement of the uncharged polar residues of mesophilic proteins by more hydrophobic residues in N. equitans orthologs may lead to an increase in
the extent of the hydrophobic core and hence to a
decrease in the solvent accessible surface area of the protein. Therefore the stability of N. equitans proteins in
extremely high temperatures is apparently provided by
significant modifications in their sequences toward
enrichment of certain residues.
It is interesting to note that unlike mesophilic organisms,
in N. equitans and other hyperthermophiles, there is a
markedly differential selection for nucleotide usage in
protein coding and structural RNA sequences. Both nonsynonymous and synonymous codon positions of their
coding sequences are purine rich, and this has two probable consequences. Firstly, due to purine richness of protein-coding sequences, the organisms may minimize
unnecessary RNA-RNA interactions and prevent the double-stranded RNA formation within the molecule [30].
Secondly, the higher purine content in nonsynonymous
codon position has good correlation with the increased
frequencies of certain residues in the encoded proteins.
These may help the organism to adapt in high temperature. In contrast, the structural RNA sequences (tRNAs and
rRNAs) of these organisms are characterized by significantly higher GC-content and hence by an increased
number of hydrogen bonds, which may facilitate
intramolecular stabilization at elevated temperature
[29,48]. Thus, in N. equitans, selection for the prevalence
of purine bases in ORFs and the GC- richness of non-coding RNA sequences may also be the consequence of its
hyperthermophilic adaptation.
Recent studies on several microbial genomes indicate a
close connection between synonymous codon usage bias,

Page 12 of 16

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:186

tRNA abundance, number of rRNA operons, optimal generation time and genome size [6,7,49]. Most of the species
with reduced genomes are host-associated microorganisms, characterized by the presence of only one or two
rRNA operons, a small number of tRNA genes, long generation time and overall AT-richness. Evidences for apparently little translational selection have been reported in
most of these organisms. N. equitans, which is an archaeal
parasite with the smallest genome known so far, encodes
only a limited number of tRNAs (38 identified tRNAs)
and single copies of 5S, 16S and 23S rRNA. Although N.
equitans is a hyperthermophilic archaeon, evidence for a
relatively poor translational selection for synonymous
codon usage is consistent with the earlier observations on
several bacteria adapted to strictly host-associated lifestyle. Furthermore, the synonymous codon usage pattern
of N. equitans forms a subset of the patterns observed typically in hyperthermophilic microbial species and is quite
distinct from the patterns of the mesophilic organisms
(Fig. 5a). Synonymous codon usage in Nanoarchaeal
genes, therefore, reveals a dual adaptation to obligatory
parasitism and hyperthermophilicity.
As demonstrated by the COA on amino acid usage, probable membrane associated proteins exhibit two different
clusters (Fig. 4a). The amino acid usage profile and the
predicted secondary structures of the members of these
two clusters are quite distinct from one another (Table 5).
Most of the variations in cell-surface proteins may be
potentially important for N. equitans to interact with the
Ignicoccus host and probably evolved during the course of
parasitic and/or thermal adaptation. It is also important
to note that in spite of its obligatory parasitic lifestyle,
there is a tendency to follow the cost-minimization hypothesis at lower level as proteins encoded by highly
expressed genes are preferentially constructed with some
smaller and energetically less expensive amino acids.
Existence of cost minimization effect in host-associated
organisms might be due to a genome-level adaptation to
utilize less expensive and small residues from the host in
the highly expressed genes [12,14,50]. This might have an
evolutionary advantage to minimize host energy exhaustion for maintaining continued association and the
chance of elimination by the host.
Hyperthermophilic organisms, in general, have comparatively smaller genome than the mesophilic organisms. It
might be advantageous in hyperthermophiles to maintain
multiple copies of chromosomes per cell due to a probable need of a reserve supply of intact chromosome to compensate for the greater chance of DNA double strand
breaks at high temperature [51,52]. Furthermore, the
faster replication of small genome is likely to be more
favorable in the environment having temperatures near to
or above 100°C [52]. Many microbial organisms living in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/186

close association with other organisms in an obligate symbiotic or parasitic relationship also experienced a reduction in genome size with respect to their free-living
ancestors. The N. equitans genome lacks the genes for central metabolism, primary biosynthesis and bioenergetic
apparatus [1], which are expected to be present in the
common archaeal ancestor. In contrast to mesophilic
organisms, it possesses the simplest functional protein
folding system – the genome contains only single copies
of homologues of prefoldin α- and β-subunits, Hsp60 and
sHsp [52]. Unlike other obligate symbiotic/parasitic
organisms, N. equitans has well-organized DNA repair
mechanism with a full set of archaeal DNA repair and
recombination enzymes [1]. Furthermore, despite the
small genome size, it devotes a large amount of coding
capacity for surface-associated proteins, suggesting that
the interaction with its host may play a major part in the
parasitic adaptation of the organism. Hence, it can be
inferred that the unusual genome reduction and genome
composition in N. equitans are the consequences of both
hyperthermophilic and parasitic adaptation and during
the coevolutionary process with Ignicoccus host, N. equitans may have experienced a dramatic decrease of genome
size, retaining only the essential genes for its thermo-parasitic lifestyle.

Conclusion
Comprehensive analysis on the N. equitans genome along
with its comparison to other mesophiles, hyperthermophiles and host-associated organisms allowed us to
understand how the dual adaptation of N. equitans to high
temperature and to an obligate parasitism can influence
the nucleotide usage at synonymous and nonsynonymous codon positions, modulating thereby its genome/
proteome composition. Thermal adaptation involves
overrepresentation of purine bases in protein coding
sequences, higher GC-content of the structural RNAs,
enhanced usage of positively charged residues and aromatic residues, decrease in polar uncharged residues in
the encoded protein and so on, while the parasitic adaptation is reflected in the extreme genome reduction, presence of weak translational selection for synonymous
codon usage, large heterogeneity in membrane associated
proteins etc. Our findings not only offer an insight into
the mechanisms of genomic adaptation of N. equitans to
high temperature and parasitism, but also evaluate the
generality of such mechanisms in the microbial world.

Methods
Sequence retrieval
All predicted protein coding sequences and the sequences
of structural RNAs (tRNAs and rRNAs) of Nanoarchaeum
equitans Kin4-M were extracted from NCBI GenBank (Version 145.0) [53]. To understand temperature related
traits, we compiled sequences of predicted protein coding

Page 13 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:186

genes and structural RNAs from seven hyperthermophilic
and seven mesophilic microbial organisms from GenBank
[53]. For comparison purpose, the selection of these completely sequenced microbial organisms was based on the
close approximation in genomic GC-content of N. equitans (i.e. all organisms under study are relatively AT-rich)
to minimize the GC-compositional effect on codon as
well as on amino acid usage. To compare with other hostassociated organisms, sequences from seven obligatory
parasitic/symbiotic microorganisms were also retrieved.
In order to reduce sampling errors, the annotated genes
with less than 100 codons were excluded from the analysis. The presumed duplicates, genes for transposase and
integrase, and the genes with internal stop codons and/or
untranslatable codons were also excluded.
Base compositional analysis
To find out the extent of base compositional bias, nucleotide frequency at all three codon positions were calculated
for protein coding sequences. The purine content at nonsynonymous codon position (R1+2) and synonymous
third codon position (R3S) were calculated for each coding
sequences of seven mesophilic, seven hyperthermophilic
organisms and N. equitans. Purine-pyrimidine skew was
performed using sliding windows of 0.1 kb on the
genomic sequence of N. equitans. The GC content and also
purine content of the structural RNA sequences were calculated for N. equitans, seven hyperthermophilic and
seven mesophilic organisms under study.
Correspondence Analysis on synonymous codon and
amino acid usage
Correspondence Analysis (COA) was performed using the
program CODONW 1.4.2 [54] to identify the major factors influencing the variation in relative synonymous
codon usage (RSCU) and amino acid frequencies. COA
was also carried out on absolute frequencies of synonymous codons in order to avoid introducing other biases
[55]. These analyses generate a series of orthogonal axes to
identify trends that explain the variation within a dataset,
with each subsequent axis explaining a decreasing
amount of the variation.
Amino acid exchange bias with orthologous sequences
Orthologous sequences between N. equitans and seven
mesophilic organisms under study were taken using the
BlastP program [56]. Orthologs were defined as those
with more than or equal to 60% similarities and less than
20% difference in length. The amino acid sequences of
105 orthologous genes were aligned using the pairwise
alignment program (ClustalW) and the amino acid
replacements were obtained in the form of a matrix, using
a program developed in-house in Visual Basic. For a given
pair of amino acids, the "forward" direction exhibited the
more common of the two replacements in the conversion

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/186

of mesophilic proteins to N. equitans proteins. To assess
the significance of the directional bias, if any, replacement
values were compared by 2 × 2 contingency tables having
1 degree of freedom. For each pair of replacements, the
first and second rows of the contingency table represented
the number of replacements from one particular residue
(say, i) to another (say, j) of the pair and the total count
of the remaining replacements (say, k) from the residue i
(where k ≠ j) respectively.
Prediction of secondary structure, transmembrane domain
and protein disorder
The prediction of protein secondary structure was performed using GOR IV algorithm [57] and the disordered
regions within proteins were predicted using GlobPlot
[38]. SMART [58] and TMHMM2.0 [59] available at
ExPASy Proteomics Server [60] were used to detect the
proteins likely to secreted in or localized to the cell surface.
Indices used to identify the trends in codon and amino acid
usage
Indices like total number of occurrence of each codon,
RSCU [61], codon adaptive index (CAI) [61], amino acids
frequencies, average hydrophobicity (Gravy score)
[34,47], aromaticity [62], aliphatic index [63] and mean
molecular weight (MMW) of protein coding sequences
were calculated to find out the factors influencing codon
and amino acid usage. The CAI was calculated for N. equitans genes with respect to the RSCU values of the genes for
ribosomal proteins (≥ 100 aa). The isoelectric point (pI)
of each predicted proteins were calculated using Expasy
proteomics server [60].
Homology modeling
Modeled structures were generated for the elongation factor Tu (EF- Tu) of N. equitans and the cell division cycle
family protein from both N. equitans and M. maripaludis
(NEQ475 in N. equitans and MMP0176 in M. maripaludis)
by using the First Approach Mode at the Swiss-Model protein structure homology modeling server [64]. The surface
charge distributions were mapped onto the predicted surface using the program MOLMOL [65]. Total surface
charge was calculated using Biomolecule module in
Insight II workstation. Comparisons were made between
N. equitans EF- Tu and E. coli EF- Tu (Blast P value 1e-45)
and between the CDC proteins from N. equitans
(NEQ475) and M. maripaludis (MMP0176) (Blast P value
0.0).
