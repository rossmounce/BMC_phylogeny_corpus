Abstract
Background: In the past years, several studies begun to unravel the structure, dynamical
properties, and evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks. However, even those
comparative studies that focus on a group of closely related organisms are limited by the rather
scarce knowledge on regulatory interactions outside a few model organisms, such as E. coli among
the prokaryotes.
Results: In this paper we used the information annotated in Tractor_DB (a database of regulatory
networks in gamma-proteobacteria) to calculate a normalized Site Orthology Score (SOS) that
quantifies the conservation of a regulatory link across thirty genomes of this subclass. Then we used
this SOS to assess how regulatory connections have evolved in this group, and how the variation
of basic regulatory connection is reflected on the structure of the chromosome. We found that
individual regulatory interactions shift between different organisms, a process that may be
described as rewiring the network. At this evolutionary scale (the gamma-proteobacteria subclass)
this rewiring process may be an important source of variation of regulatory incoming interactions
for individual networks. We also noticed that the regulatory links that form feed forward motifs
are conserved in a better correlated manner than triads of random regulatory interactions or pairs
of co-regulated genes. Furthermore, the rewiring process that takes place at the most basic level
of the regulatory network may be linked to rearrangements of genetic material within bacterial
chromosomes, which change the structure of Transcription Units and therefore the regulatory
connections between Transcription Factors and structural genes.
Conclusion: The rearrangements that occur in bacterial chromosomes-mostly inversion or
horizontal gene transfer events – are important sources of variation of gene regulation at this
evolutionary scale.

Background
The transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) defines the
cellular response to environmental stimuli at the step of
transcription initiation. It may be analyzed at four different levels of increasing complexity: individual regulatory
interactions, network motifs, functional modules, and the
entire network that may be represented as a directed graph
[1]. Several studies in the past years have begun to unravel
the structure, dynamical properties, and evolution of the
network at these four levels of organization [2-7] using
mainly as a starting point the information of the regulatory networks of E. coli and S. cerevisiae.
Studies that focus on the evolution of the regulatory network, even within a group of closely related organisms are
limited by the rather scarce knowledge on regulatory
interactions outside a few model organisms. Among
prokaryotes, E. coli K12 [8] and B. subtilis [9] have the best
known and better annotated networks. Several
approaches have been developed to overcome the lack of
comparative information on regulatory interactions that
is necessary in works aimed at studying the evolution of
regulatory networks. Most of these approaches combine
the use of sequence profiles of the sites recognized by a
given Transcription Factor (TF) in a model organism (for
instance E. coli) with orthology information between the
genes of closely related organisms (based on the model
organism) to identify putative orthologous regulatory
interactions in organisms other than the model [5,10-18].
The problem is more challenging when one intends to
extrapolate the information of known TRNs to phylogenetically distant organisms. Two recent studies [7,19] took
the TRNs of E. coli and B. subtilis and assessed the conservation of their transcription factors (TFs) and regulated
genes across a broad array of sequenced genomes. Both
works showed that the set of regulatory genes – even global transcription factors – clearly varies from one group of
organisms to another. On the other hand, several studies
have shown that, within a group of closely related organisms, the conservation of a TF and a subset of the structural genes it regulates are not sufficient to assume that
regulatory links between them are conserved between
such two organisms [10-18].
Therefore, the question whether the interchange of regulatory links between TFs and structural genes could be a significant mechanism to "rewire" the regulatory network
between closely related organisms remains open. This
rewiring has been compared to changing the "software" of
the transcriptional regulation machinery [20], as opposed
to changing the "hardware". The latter would mean
changing the set of TFs or regulated genes – a process
observed by Babu et al. [7] and Lozada-Chavez et al. [16]
– between phylogenetically distant organisms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/128

In this paper we use the information stored in Tractor_DB
to compute a normalized Site Orthology Score (SOS) that
quantifies the conservation of a regulatory interaction
across thirty genomes currently included in the database.
We then use this SOS to assess the evolution of individual
regulatory interactions and to find out whether the rearrangement of these connections affects the conservation
of network motifs. We found that, within the evolutionary
scale of the members of the gamma-proteobacteria subclass, the regulatory links that form feed forward motifs
are more correlatedly conserved than triads of random
regulatory interactions or pairs of co-regulated genes.
Moreover, we used the information stored in Tractor_DB
together with the information on the organization of
gamma-proteobacterial genomes in Transcription Units
(TUs) [21] to assess whether there is a correlation between
the conservation of a regulatory site and the structure of
the TU whose expression it controls. We found, in agreement with a previous result obtained for seven organisms
[5], that regulatory sites with higher SOS are more likely
to occur upstream TUs with more conserved structures,
suggesting that a correlation between the conservation of
a regulatory site and the conservation of the structure of
the TU it regulates does exist at this evolutionary scale.
With these results and those obtained by Belda et al. [22]
regarding genome rearrangements in the gamma-proteobacteria, we state the hypothesis that genome rearrangement events, such as inversion and horizontal gene
transfer events, that have occurred during the evolution of
this group may have produced TU rearrangements that
caused the rewiring that is observed within the network.
These changes in the regulation of individual structural
genes would be fixed depending on the lifestyle of each
organism [7,13]. Therefore, while gene duplication and
deletion events may be responsible for changing the TRN
"hardware" over large evolutionary scales, operon rearrangements may play a major role in reprogramming at
the "software" level within groups of closely related
organisms.

Results
As previously stated, given the scarcity of experimentally
verified regulatory sites in gamma-proteobacterial
genomes, our study is based entirely on computational
predictions obtained from Tractor_DB. In order to validate the robustness of these predictions we a) calculated
the sensitivity and specificity of the computational
approaches taken to produce them; b) compared the E.
coli experimentally verified TRN, and the E. coli and S.
typhimurium reconstructed TRNs with data from gene
expression experiments; c) assessed the circularity of the
populations of predicted sites, and; d) tested the possibility of a correlation between the SOS of E. coli regulatory
sites and the scores of their orthologs. (See Discussion for

details.) The starting dataset comprises all putative regulatory interactions found within the genomes of the thirty
gamma-proteobacteria included in the database. Table 1
presents a summary of this data, namely the number of
putative regulatory interactions annotated in Tractor_DB,
as well as the number of Regulons and TUs for which regulatory information is available, for each organism. Each
interaction connects a TF to a structural gene; therefore, a
regulatory site (or several sites, as mentioned above) identified upstream a TU defines regulatory links that connect
the TF that binds to the site with each gene of the TU
(datasets corresponding to the regulatory networks of the
organisms used in this study may be downloaded from
Tractor_DB). The number of regulatory interactions identified in the networks of each organism ranges from 2,118
in E. coli K12 to 6 in X. axonopodis and M. capsulatus. Table
1 also presents the Accession Numbers to the genomic
sequences of all organisms included in this study, as well
as abbreviated names for each organism that are used else-

where in the paper (for further details concerning the
computational genomics approaches used to produce
these data, please refer to Additional file 1).
Variability of the gene content of orthologous regulons
Previous studies done in different groups of gamma-proteobacteria have shown that the gene content of a few
individual regulons (such as CRP, FNR, Fur, Zur, LexA,
and KdpE) changes from one organism to another [1018]. This phenomenon does not depend on the substitution of the set of TFs and structural genes that takes place
between more distant organisms, as observed by Babu et
al. [7] and Lozada-Chavez et al. [19]. Nevertheless, both
processes have been explained in terms of the diverse regulatory needs that have arisen in different organisms as
they adapt to different lifestyles, which are defined by
Babu et al. [7] as a combination of four properties: oxygen
requirement, optimal growth temperature, environmental

not.

bacteria from their last common ancestor. See Additional
file 2 for further discussion and illustration.

To determine whether this variation in gene content is a
general property of the regulatory network, we classified
all orthologous regulatory interactions in our starting
dataset (or their absence) into four groups depending on
their conservation with respect to E. coli regulatory interactions (see Methods and Figure 1). For that, interactions
were labeled as conserved, lost gene, other regulon or
lost link under the assumption that that the E. coli TF has
an ortholog in the organism under analysis and all, except
lost gene, are referred to orthologs of the E. coli gene.
Therefore an E. coli regulatory interaction (or link) for
which both an orthologous TF and an orthologous gene
exist in another organism may be conserved (if an interaction links the orthologous TF and the orthologous
gene); alternatively it may have changed to other regulon
(if the orthologous gene is regulated by a different TF), or
it may be lost (if no incoming interaction has been identified for the orthologous gene). This classification
scheme, although based on E. coli (which is the original
source for the computational predictions), intends to
illustrate a process of disappearance of interactions and
appearance of new regulatory links occurred within the
evolutionary divergence of the different gamma-proteo-

The fraction of orthologous interactions labeled as other
regulon or lost link in other organisms ranges from
approximately 18% (Hduc) to 55% (Ecoo). Figure 2
presents the distribution of orthologous interactions in
the four previously described categories for 17 organisms
(those with more than 100 regulatory interactions in the
starting dataset), sorted by increasing fraction of genes
with orthologs in E. coli. Regulatory interactions classified
as other regulon indicate that a process of disappearance
of interactions and appearance of new regulatory links –
that may be described as a rewiring of the network – takes
place at the most basic level of the network: the individual
regulatory connections. A number of lost links may in
fact be false negatives of the computational strategies that
we used to rebuild the regulatory networks of the 30
organisms included in Tractor_DB. (Several effects such as
the divergence of the sequence motif recognized by
orthologous TFs may be the cause of these E. coli sites
without orthologs.) However, given the results of the calculation of the rates of false negatives in the E. coli genome
in the starting dataset (see Additional file 3) we are confident that many interactions classified as lost links indeed
correspond to changes of transcriptional regulation
between orthologous genes.
The SOS (see Methods) of E. coli regulatory connections is
another way to look at their conservation (or variability)
across the gamma-proteobacteria included in Tractor_DB.
Additional file 4 presents significant values (mean, standard deviation and maximum) of the distribution of SOS
values obtained for the 85 regulons included in
Tractor_DB. Considering the network as a whole, the five
regulons that present the highest mean SOS values (and
therefore possess on average better conserved interactions) are PdhR (0.88), MarA (0.81), GlcC (0.7), TreR
(0.68), and XylR (0.56). The distribution of SOS values in
the entire network has a mean of 0.21 and a standard deviation of 0.07.

Figure 1
Conservation of orthologous regulatory interactions
Conservation of orthologous regulatory interactions.
Each orthologous regulatory interaction is classified according to its conservation with respect to E. coli regulatory interactions (see detailed explanation in the text).

Table 2 exemplifies the aforementioned rewiring process
for three regulons: FruR, NtrC and PurR (for each regulon
only connections with at least the mean SOS for the regulon minus one standard deviation are shown). SOS values
of the E. coli regulatory interactions range between 0.1 and
0.69 in the FruR regulon, and between 0.1 and 0.71 in the
NtrC and the PurR regulons. Since the SOS is the quotient
of two weighed summations (see Methods), low SOS values may be interpreted as regulatory interactions that are
preferentially conserved in organisms that are closer to E.
coli, and lost in more distant ones, while higher SOS values correspond to interactions that are conserved both in
close and in distant organisms. For instance, the

glutamine synthetase gene (glnA) is regulated by NtrC in
E. coli. Orthologs of both the TF and the gene exist in other
29 genomes analyzed. We identified orthologous regulatory connections in 19 organisms only but because this
list includes both close and distant genomes, the SOS produced is rather high. Actually, only 2% of all E. coli regulatory interactions have SOS values higher than 0.7. In the
other extreme, the codB and codA genes form a Transcription Unit with orthologs in 20 of the genomes included in
Tractor_DB, where their regulator (PurR) is also conserved. However, the regulatory link between them is only
conserved in S. typhi and S. typhimurium, producing an
SOS value of only 0.1, which is below the mean value of
the network.
We also analyzed the distribution of the SOS values of regulatory links within the network by computing what fraction of regulatory interactions have SOS equal to or
greater than an increasing cutoff value. This means sam-

pling the regulatory interactions with SOS higher than a
given increasing value. As Figure 3 shows (for all the interactions of the E. coli network and those of the CRP, FNR,
and MetJ regulons separately) the fraction of regulatory
interactions sampled decreases rapidly with the increase
of the value of SOS used as cutoff for sampling. For
instance, for the FNR regulon, the fraction drops to 0 at
SOS 0.5, which means that no FNR outgoing interactions
have associated SOS values higher than 0.5. In the entire
E. coli network, only 8 regulatory interactions have SOS
associated values higher than 0.8.
Evolution of small network circuits
One question that arises concerning this rewiring of the
network is whether local medium-level structures are
affected by the appearance and disappearance of regulatory interactions. Regulatory interactions in the TRN form
recurrent circuits that involve one, three or four nodes,
and which are often referred to as network motifs [23,24].

Network motifs are known to be involved in local
dynamic properties of the network, [4,25] and therefore,
it would be interesting to determine whether E. coli motifs
are conserved in other organisms to a higher extent than
expected from the observed pattern of shifting of individual interactions.
To address this question, we extracted all the auto-regulatory loops (ALs: where a TF regulates the transcription of
its own gene and the feed forward (FF: where two TFs, X
and Y regulate the expression of gene A) motifs in the E.

coli TRN reconstructed in Tractor_DB. For both types of
motifs we used a metrics that is more elaborated than simply counting the number of conserved motifs in other
organisms. We relied on the SOS of individual interactions to evaluate the conservation of motifs, because the
SOS takes different values depending on which organisms
bear orthologs to an E. coli regulatory site.
In the case of ALs, we calculated the mean of the associated SOS values of the interactions between the TF and its
coding gene, and compared it with the average mean that

For each SOS value represented in the graph, regulatory interactions with lower or equal SOS are sampled and counted, and the fraction they represent with respect to all interactions is computed.

resulted from randomly taking 1,000 samples composed
of the same number of interactions than the set of ALs. As
shown in Table 3, the mean SOS associated with regulatory interactions involved in ALs is 0.36, whereas the
mean SOS of all regulatory interactions in the network is
0.21. We found that regulatory interactions that form ALs
are on average better conserved than groups of interactions of the same size sampled randomly from the network (p-value 3.02*10-12). This result implies that natural
selection acts at the level of motifs favoring the preservation of regulatory interactions that form auto-regulatory
circuits – through which TFs control the transcription of
their own genes – in this group of organisms.
With regard to FF motifs, we assessed whether the regulatory interactions that form them are correlatedly conserved (see Methods). Again, since the SOS of a given E.
coli interaction depends on which organisms have orthologous interactions, it may be seen as a phylogenetic pro-

file measurement that takes similar values for two
interactions when they are conserved in similar sets of
organisms. Therefore, a positive correlation between the
SOS values of two interactions implies that they appear in
a similar set of organisms and are absent in a similar set.
Table 3 shows that these three correlations are positive,
and range from 0.64 to 0.78 (with p-values between
3.8*10-8 and 3.98*10-7). These results mean that the profile of the conservation of two regulatory interactions that
make part of an E. coli FF motif – across the genomes of
the other 29 organisms in the dataset – tend to be more
similar than the patterns of conservation of any two interactions sampled randomly from the network, which
implies that the structure of E. coli FF motifs tends to be
altogether conserved or lost in the same arrays of organisms, as defined by similar SOS. In other words, the regulatory links that form feed forward motifs [26,27] are
conserved in a better correlated manner than triads of random regulatory interactions.

In order to compare the correlation of the SOS of interactions involved in FFs to other non-random structures
within the network, we calculated the correlation coefficient of the SOS of 4089 pairs of E. coli co-regulated genes.
Table 3 shows that, although statistically significant (pvalue 4.5*10-4), the pairs of co-regulated genes as a rule,
tend to be less correlatedly conserved than pairs of interactions involved in FF motifs.
Conservation of the connectivity distribution
The connectivity distribution (i.e., the distribution of regulatory inputs received by TUs, and the distribution of regulatory outputs of TFs) in the transcriptional regulatory
network may be approximated by a power law function
with negative exponent [28-30]. We constructed the connectivity distribution for each organism with more than
250 regulatory interactions in the dataset to determine
how the rewiring process that takes place at the most basic
level of the network affects its global properties.

Figure 4 presents the incoming connectivity distribution –
plotted as the logarithm of the frequency with which
structural genes with a given number of incoming regulatory interactions appear in the network, against the logarithm of the number of incoming interactions – of the
regulatory networks with more than 550 interactions
(Eco, Sty, Stm, Ecoo, Ypes, Sfl2 and Sone). The slopes of
the adjusting lines are very similar for all networks, ranging from -4 (Eco) to -2.98 (Stm); r2 coefficients range from
0.85 to 0.88. These trend lines should not be taken as a
golden standard because only a fraction of structural
genes were included in the calculation. We use them to
merely illustrate the similarity of their slopes between different organisms.
This result (which we had previously obtained for a
smaller number of networks with fewer interactions [31])

suggests that despite the rewiring process that takes place
at the most basic level of the network, the global properties of the graph, such as the connectivity distribution,
remain unaffected within this group of organisms.
The conservation of a regulatory site and the conservation
of the regulated TU
Changes in gene regulation, that we detect as regulatory
links that fall within the categories other regulon and lost
link (see above) may have occurred by two main different
events: either the gene was "relocated" to a different TU in
one of the organisms resulting from a speciation event, or
the orthologous regulatory regions diverged to an extent
that they no longer bear sites recognized by the orthologous TFs (represented by orthologous weight matrices in
the approach used to identify regulatory sites in
Tractor_DB). In an attempt to assess the relative contribution of these two processes to changes in gene regulation,
we computed the fraction of TUs in each organism whose
structure is identical (see Methods) to their orthologous
TUs in E. coli and bear genes with regulatory links either
unknown (lost link) or that have switched to a different
regulator (other regulon). We found that a fraction of the
genes in these two categories ranging from 46% (P. aeruginosa) to 77% (E. coli O157H7) appear in TUs that are
identical to their E. coli orthologs and therefore the change
in regulation in their cases could only be explained by
divergence of the orthologous regulatory regions.

This result suggests that TU rearrangements have caused
the regulatory shift of a number of those genes whose regulation has changed with respect to their E. coli orthologs
(from 23 to 54% depending on the organism). To test this
hypothesis, we searched for any discernible relationship
between the degree to which a regulatory site is conserved
across the genomes of the organisms included in
Tractor_DB, and the conservation of the structure of the

regulated TUs. To assess this relationship, we classified the
structure of each TU in one of four categories, according to
its similarity to the structure of its E. coli orthologous
TU(s). Sorted in order of decreasing conservation, the categories are Identical, Similar, Destroyed, and Lost (see
Methods, and Itoh et al. [32] for details on these categories). TUs were also classified in four groups according to
the SOS of the regulatory sites upstream them (clearly,
only TUs with putative regulatory sites were included in
this part of the study). The four groups were formed by the
TUs with regulatory sites with SOS between 0 and 0.13,
between 0.14 and 0.36, between 0.37 and 0.59, and
between 0.6 and 1. We chose these extreme values for the
intervals instead of evenly dividing the data in quarters,
because the last quarter interval (0.75–1) would be highly
under-represented due to the relative scarcity of interactions with SOS values higher than 0.75 [5].

Then, 8 groups of TUs were formed by merging both classification systems. The TUs in each of the four intervals of
SOS of their regulatory sites were divided into two classes:
those with Identical or Similar structure (I+S), and those
with Destroyed or Lost structure (D+L). Figure 5A shows
the distribution of the TUs into these 8 groups. The bias in
the distribution of TUs between the I+S and D+L groups is
also illustrated in Figure 5B, for increasing values of SOS
of their regulatory sites.
We calculated an I+S/D+L ratio for each SOS interval, and
assessed the statistical significance of the observed ratios
with respect to random associations between TUs and regulatory sites. The results (presented in Table 4) show that
there is a statistically significant relationship between the
conservation of a site and the conservation of the structure
of the TU that it regulates, across the organisms of this

group. For instance, regulatory sites with SOS between 0
and 0.13 have a probability of only 0.34 of occurring
upstream TUs with structures that are either Identical or
Similar to their orthologous TU in E. coli. On the other
hand, sites with SOS between 0.6 and 1 are located
upstream Identical or Similar TUs with a probability of
0.6. These results are very similar to those obtained by a
previous study that used a simpler equation and less data
to calculate the SOS [5]. Furthermore, the assessment of
the statistical significance – introduced here – reveals that
the biases to more or less conserved TUs observed for each
group of sites are highly significant, as shown by the p-values of the ratios, which range from 2.5*10-69 to 1.35*1044.
We also looked at the conservation of regulatory sites in
connection to the conservation of gene order between

genomes. We counted the number of E. coli sites that are
conserved in each of the other genomes and separated
them into two groups: conserved sites occurring inside
conserved syntenic groups of genes and conserved sites
occurring outside conserved syntenic groups. To assess
whether a bias exists for conserved sites to preferentially
appear in one of these two locations and whether this
trend correlates in any way with the degree of conservation of regulatory sites across the 30 genomes, we counted
sites with SOS equal to or higher than an increasing cutoff
value (see above) and calculated a ratio of the two aforementioned groups of sites for each SOS used as cutoff for
sampling. Figure 6 shows the values taken by this ratio for
sites sampled with increasing SOS cutoff values for pairs
of genomes formed by E. coli and either Sty, Sfle, Sfl2 and
Ypes; Stm has been excluded from the graph for clarity,
since its behavior is almost identical to the one observed

in Sty; similar trends to the ones shown are observed in all
other organisms, but are less clear due to lower number of
conserved sites). The graph shows that the number of conserved sites within conserved syntenic groups between E.
coli and each genome tends to decrease slower than the
number of conserved sites outside conserved syntenic
regions as higher SOS values are used for sampling the
sites. Therefore, regions of conserved synteny between
genomes are enriched of sites that are more conserved
across genomes. Additional file 5 exemplifies this behavior through the comparison of orthologous genes
between Eco and Stm, and Eco and Ypes. Each pair of
orthologous genes is represented as a filled circle (when
the orthologous of the Eco gene has an incoming interaction that is conserved in the other organism), or as an
open circle otherwise. The same trend is observed in other
organisms.

Discussion
To our knowledge, two studies have extrapolated the
information on the E. coli TRN to other organisms to
investigate the evolution of prokaryotic TRNs as a whole
[7,19]. Both studies assessed the conservation of E. coli
(and B. subtilis) TFs and regulated genes across more than
100 genomes, showing that TFs are flexibly substituted in
the course of evolution. Babu et al. [7] found that even
network motifs, and the set of global regulators, may
change dramatically from one group of organisms to
another. (Other works [19,33] have made the same observations regarding network motifs.) Then, they proposed
the idea that the free-scale architecture of the TRN evolved
in a convergent manner within each group of organisms.
On the other hand, several studies that focused on isolated regulons had hinted that within a group of closely
related organisms the change of regulatory interactions
within the TRN may be at least as important as the substitution of regulatory proteins. In this process (which may
be understood as rewiring the TRN), the links between a
TF and some of the genes it regulates in the genome of one
species are lost in a second (even though both the TF and
its regulated genes appear in both) and replaced by regulatory inputs from other TFs. These new TFs need not to be
unique of the second species [10-18].
In this study, we aimed at characterizing this process of
rewiring the regulatory connections within the TRN that
had been noticed for a few isolated regulons. We used the
data on putative regulatory sites in 30 gamma-proteobacterial genomes that we had produced using two complementary computational strategies and annotated in
Tractor_DB. We intended to investigate not only the genes
that belonged to a given E. coli regulon and which had
apparently left that regulon in another organism but if
possible, we wanted to identify the TF(s) that appear to
regulate the orthologous genes in that second species. Fur-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/128

thermore, we intended to assess the influence of this
change in regulatory connections on structures of higher
complexity within the network, i.e., network motifs and
the free scale architecture.
Moreover, we wanted to evaluate how this process of rearranging regulatory interactions is reflected on the physical
structure of the bacterial chromosome. Since the TU is the
basic structure responsible for the spatial proximity of all
the sequences necessary to accomplish the correct control
of the transcription of a group of genes, we decided to
search for changes in the structure of orthologous TUs that
might correlate with changes on regulatory input interactions of the genes that form them.
Robustness of the data stored in Tractor_DB
The scarcity of experimental data on regulatory interactions has been a limitation for comparative analyses that
aim at understanding the evolution of TRNs. Manually
curated experimental data are available for very few model
organisms. Among the prokaryotes E. coli K12 [8] and B.
subtilis [9] have the best known and better annotated networks. To assess the evolution of diverse gamma-proteobacterial regulons, several studies over the past decade
have employed computationally predicted regulatory
sites. Nevertheless, the use of computationally produced
data must always be carefully considered when used as the
starting point of biological analyses.

In the case of our study, for example, regulatory sites
labeled as lost link and other regulon may indeed be
artefacts of the computational approaches taken to predict
orthologous regulatory sites. The fact that such methodologies fail to recognize an ortholog of an E. coli regulatory
site in another organism (or assign the site to another TF)
may be caused by genetic drift (divergence between
sequence motifs recognized by orthologous TFs). Also,
since the recognition of regulatory sites by TFs is aided by
protein-protein interactions, the absence of a sequence
strong enough to be identified by a weight matrix does not
guarantee that the TF will fail to bind to the regulatory
region.
To evaluate the robustness of the data stored in
Tractor_DB we compared the results obtained by the
methodology of statistical models (Additional file 1) used
to predict putative regulatory sites in E. coli with experimentally known regulatory sites in this organism,
obtained from RegulonDB [8]. Relatively high values of
sensitivity and specificity – calculated using the definitions by Benitez-Bellon et al. [34] – were achieved by this
methodology.
To assess the validity of our computational predictions in
other organisms (where sensitivity and specificity cannot

Page 12 of 18

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:128

be calculated), we compared the E. coli experimentally
verified TRN (annotated in RegulonDB [8]), and the E. coli
and S. typhimurium reconstructed TRNs with data from
gene expression experiments. We compared the expression profiles of co-regulated (or putatively co-regulated)
E. coli and S. typhimurium gene pairs. We found that the
strong trend of co-expression observed for experimentally
verified co-regulated E. coli gene pairs may also be recognized for E. coli and S. typhimurium computationally predicted co-regulated gene pairs (Additional file 6). As more
high quality gene expression data is incorporated into
microarray databases, this validation might be extended
to other organisms.) These results strongly support the
validity of computationally reconstructed TRNs stored in
Tractor_DB.
The identification of putative regulatory sites applying a
comparative genomics approach based on regulatory
information extracted from E. coli could in principle
reproduce these starting data and create the false impression that gamma-proteobacterial TRNs are very similar.
We have used the term circularity to denote this behavior
of computationally predicted regulatory binding sites. We
have previously tested the data stored in Tractor_DB for
this bias [5], and found that orthologous regulons in
Tractor_DB differ in gene content between organisms,
while they share a common set of genes (the regulon
core). Erill et al. [13] have characterized this behavior for
LexA.
Different TFs present different binding affinity distributions [2,5], which might create another possible bias in
our data. These differences might reflect on differences in
the information content of statistical models built to identify putative regulatory sites. Weaker models would identify larger number of false positive sites within
orthologous regulatory regions, resulting in falsely high
SOS values. We tested the hypothesis of a correlation
between the SOS of E. coli regulatory sites and the scores
of their orthologs (calculated by the statistical models
used to identify them) that may have arisen as the result
of the aforesaid problem. The results in Additional file 7
show that there is no distinguishable trend that relates
high SOS values with low sites' scores as would be
expected if weak statistical models would have biased SOS
values by increasing the number of false positive orthologous regulatory sites.
Rearrangements of regulatory links are a source of
flexibility for the TRN
Babu et al. [7] and Lozada-Chavez et al. [19]found that the
replacement of subsets of E. coli and B subtilis TFs and (to
a lesser extent) structural genes is probably crucial for the
adaptation of different evolutionary groups to diverse
environmental conditions. This process may be described

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/128

as the substitution of the TRN "hardware" [20]. In this
study, we found that while the replacement of subsets of
TFs may be important for the adaptation of organism in
different groups to diverse lifestyles, the role played by
rearrangements of regulatory connections between conserved TFs and regulated genes in the adaptation of closely
related organisms should not be ruled out.
Furthermore, Babu et al. [7] showed that TFs and structural genes that are associated in a network motif in E. coli
do not tend to appear associated in the networks reconstructed in other organisms with a frequency that is higher
than that expected by chance. However, our results suggest that if the three genes that form the FF motif in E. coli
co-occur in another genome the probability that the regulatory links between them are conserved (shown by the
values of correlation of their SOS) will be greater than the
probability of correlated conservation of a triad of randomly chosen regulatory links. And this trend is also
stronger than the one observed for pairs of co-regualted
genes, although the latter is also statistically significant
when compared to randomly sampled nodes. This
observed trend may be a consequence of the dynamical
properties that motifs confer to the regulation of individual structural genes [4,25]. Interestingly, some of the highest SOS values correspond to ALs, i.e., TFs that regulate the
expression of their structural gene. This means that if a
given TF is autorregulated in E. coli its ortholog in another
gamma-proteobacteria it will probably be autorregulated
as well.
The fact that small regulatory circuits as ALs are conserved
more often than would be expected from the conservation
of individual regulatory interactions – and that regulatory
interactions involved in FF motifs are more correlatedly
conserved than triads of randomly chosen interactions or
pairs of co-regulated genes – suggests that some of these
features might be favored by natural selection within a
group of closely related organisms once they appear in
their common ancestor. In other words, even though the
free-scale architecture of TRNs may show converging evolution in different groups of organisms, some of these elements that are present in the TRN of the common ancestor
of the group might be preserved by natural selection,
while the adaptation of various members of the group to
slightly changing lifestyles may be accomplished through
changes in regulatory connections, a process that may
occur in a short period of time, compared to the substitution of a subset of regulatory proteins.
Genome rearrangements may contribute to the
interchange of regulatory sites
Analysis of the conservation of the structure of TUs
showed a trend for conserved sites to be located upstream
conserved TUs. On the other hand, regulatory interactions

Page 13 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:128

conserved in few genomes involve genes within TUs
whose structure is less conserved. This bias suggests that
rearrangements of the bacterial chromosome that affect
the structure of TUs may be related to the rewiring process
observed in the regulatory network. Itoh et al. [32]
pointed out that when a TU is broken, one of the resulting
fragments retains the original regulation (remains close to
its regulatory region) while the other fragment(s) by
approaching a new regulatory region – through rearrangements – may either retain the same regulation or gain regulatory input from a different TF or set of TFs. Moreover,
we found that conserved regulatory sites tend to involve
genes that occur within conserved syntenic groups, and
that this trend increases when analyzing sites with higher
SOS. That is, interactions that are conserved across a
higher number of organisms show a stronger trend to
affect genes within conserved syntenic groups. Therefore,
we raise the hypothesis that rearrangements of genetic
material resulting from inversions [19] (and possibly horizontal gene transfer) may have affected the regulation of
individual genes. On the other hand, sets of genes whose
order in the chromosome is not disrupted (i.e.: conserved
syntenic groups) would have maintained their regulatory
interactions. Thus, these rearrangement events have contributed to the rewiring of the regulatory network. Nevertheless, both types of events – when affecting large
portions of chromosomes that contain both TFs and their
regulated genes – would have preserved the spatial proximity between TFs and their regulated genes, as has been
observed by Menchaca-Mendez et al. [6].
Nevertheless, the importance of orthologous regulatory
sequence divergence may not be overlooked when analyzing the causes of network rewiring. We observed that as
much as 46% (Paer) to 77% (Ecoo) of all genes that
receive interactions from TFs that differ from those that
regulate their orthologs in E. coli occur in TUs that are
identical or similar to their Eco orthologs. Therefore, the
difference in regulation for these instances may only be
explained by the divergence of the orthologous regulatory
regions that may affect the recognition by the model that
represents the binding site of the orthologous TF.

Conclusion
While at large evolutionary scales, the main source of variation of the regulation of individual genes may be
changes in the repertoire of TFs (by changing in gene content), at smaller scales, the shift of individual regulatory
interactions – or rewiring of the network – between existing TFs and structural genes may be also an important
source for this modification. The rewiring observed at the
most basic level of the regulatory network occurs mainly
by two processes: rearrangements of genetic material and
divergence of orthologous regulatory regions. The rearrangements that occur in bacterial chromosomes at this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/128

evolutionary scale-mostly inversion or horizontal gene
transfer events – alter the structure of some TUs but leave
the order of genes in certain pieces of the chromosome
unchanged. At this evolutionary scale, the connections
that are part of motifs tend to be more correlatedly conserved than triads of randomly chosen regulatory links or
pairs of co-regulated genes. Moreover, the rewiring process does not affect the global properties of the graph, such
as the connectivity distribution. This preservation of connectivity distribution takes place without modifying the
set of global regulators, suggesting that only fine-tuning of
the regulatory network occurs within this group of closely
related organisms, in the process of divergence from a
common ancestor.

Methods
We determined orthology relationships between gene
pairs using the BLAST Bi-Directional Best Hits (BBH)
approach [35]. Briefly, two genes were considered
orthologs if each gene identified the other as its best hit in
the bi-directional blasts satisfying two conditions: the evalues of both hits were equal to or smaller than 10-15 and
sequence coverage was at least 60%. These orthology relationships were then extended to other components of the
regulatory machinery. We defined orthologous TUs as
those that share at least one pair of orthologous genes.
Orthologous regulatory regions/sequences are defined
as those extending from -400 to +50 with respect to the
first translated nucleotide of orthologous TUs (note that
according to this definition, a TU in organism A may have
more than one orthologous TUs in organism B). Putative
regulatory sites that occur at ortholgous regulatory
regions, and are predicted to be recognized by the same TF
were labeled as orthologous regulatory sites. As mentioned above, we worked with regulatory sites stored in
Tractor_DB that were identified using either statistical
models or pattern matching [31,36,37]. A thorough
description of the methodologies used to produce these
computationally predicted regulatory sites is provided in
Additional file 1.
In this work, regulatory site conservation is used as synonymous to conservation of a regulatory interaction,
although two conserved sites may in practice correspond
to a single conserved interaction (when multiple binding
sites for the same TF affecting the same gene are conserved). As Table 1 shows, our starting dataset contained
a varying number of interactions for the 30 genomes
included in the study (from 6 in X. axonopodis and M. capsulatus to 2118 in E. coli K12), with a mean of 446 interactions per genome.
Variability of regulatory interactions within regulons
We used regulatory interactions identified in E. coli as a
template to assess the variability of regulatory interactions

Page 14 of 18

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:128

of each individual regulon across all the organisms
included in the database. Putative orthologous interactions – or their absence – in each of the other twenty-nine
genomes were classified into four categories. Interactions
established between a pair of orthologous TFs and a pair
of orthologous structural genes were labeled as conserved; a pair of orthologous genes regulated by nonorthologous TFs were included in the other regulon category; when an ortholog of an E. coli gene with a known
input regulatory interaction has no identified regulatory
site, we considered this a lost link; an E. coli gene without
an identified ortholog in the other organism was classified
as lost gene. Figure 1 illustrates this classification scheme.
Site Orthology Score (SOS)
The orthology score of a site (SOS) assesses the conservation of an E. coli regulatory site across the other 29
genomes. Let ai be a binary coefficient that takes value 1 if
an orthologous site exists (a putative regulatory site predicted to be recognized by the orthologous TF) in the
organism i and 0 otherwise (note that ai will take value 1
if at least an ortholog to an E. coli site exists in genome i,
regardless of the exact number of original sites, orthologous sites and their precise positions relative to each
other). Let fi-Eco be the fraction of genes of the organism i
with orthologs in E. coli. (fi-Eco is a measure of the similarity of a given genome to E. coli, and is defined for all 29
pairs formed by E. coli and any other organism.) Let then
bi be a binary coefficient that takes value 1 if an orthologous site is expected to appear in the organism i and 0 otherwise. (Orthologous sites are expected to appear in the
genome of i if and only if an orthologous TF and at least
an orthologous TU of the E. coli TU upstream which the
site is located exist in the genome of organism i.) The SOS
may be expressed as:

28
∑ a i (1− f i − Eco )
SOS = i = 0
.
28
∑ bi (1− f i − Eco )
i =0
The numerator of the equation counts the number of
organisms where orthologous sites are found, weighing
the contribution of each organism to the SOS with an estimator of the phylogenetic distance between organism i
and E. coli (one minus the fraction of genes from i that
have orthologs in E. coli). Therefore, the contribution of
an organism to the SOS is greater the smaller the fraction
of its genes with orthologs in E. coli. On the other hand,
the denominator computes the highest number of organisms where orthologous sites are expected to occur under
the conditions of the strategies used to identify putative
regulatory interactions – i.e., an orthologous site may only
be found in organisms where an orthologous TF and at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/128

least one orthologous TU exist – and normalizes the SOS.
The SOS of an E. coli site is thus the fraction that results
from counting the genomes with an orthologous site
(weighed by a measure of their phylogenetic distance to E.
coli) and dividing them by the sum of all genomes with an
expected orthologous site (weighed in the same manner).
It is thus a normalized score that reflects the conservation
of a site within the set of the 29 genomes included in this
study. The SOS does not include the score of putative regulatory sites (assigned by statistical models). Nevertheless, by considering only sites scoring above estimated
cutoffs by the predictive approach (see Additional file 1)
it indirectly takes into account the similarity of a putative
site to the statistical model, and subsequently weighs the
significance of a regulatory site in a way that is similar to
the Regulogger tool [16].
Since the identification of pairs of orthologous genes may
be influenced by a number of factors (horizontally transferred genetic material, paralogy effects that may give rise
to the existence of both inparalogs and outparalogs) that
could in principle distort the fractions of orthologous
genes calculated, we tested the influence of the chosen
measure of the evolutionary distance on the distribution
of the SOS. We recalculated all the SOS of E. coli regulatory links using a different measure of phylogenetic distance. We employed the same measure of distance used by
Lozada-Chavez et al [19], based on the distances between
the nodes of a phylogenetic tree estimated from a set of
carefully filtered proteins. We found that the SOS calculated using the fraction of orthologous genes as measure
of phylogenetic distances correlates fairly well (R2 = 0.68)
with those calculated using the more rigorous measure
described in the cited paper. Therefore, a study carried out
using a more rigorous measure of phylogenetic distance
would most likely arrive to very similar results (see Additional file 8 for details).
The SOS takes values between 0 and 1. A site with SOS 0
has no orthologous sites, and a site with SOS 1 has
orthologs in all the organisms where an ortholog is
expected given the aforementioned conditions.
We presented a previous version of the SOS in a study that
included seven organisms [5]. Instead of being normalized to the estimation of the maximum score of the site, it
was normalized to the highest SOS value found among all
sites in the entire E. coli network. The current improvement produces a more realistic SOS for each site by constraining the maximum expected SOS to the contribution
of the organisms where orthologous sites may actually
occur.

the other 29 organisms with respect to the entire network.
In the AL motif, a TF regulates the transcription of its own
gene. In the FF motif two TFs, X and Y regulate the expression of gene A: X regulates the transcription of A both
directly and indirectly through the regulation of the transcription of the gene coding Y [20,21]. In our starting data
set 333 regulatory interactions formed 111 FF motifs and
28 AL motifs wtih TFs regulating transcription of their
own genes. The number of motifs in our data set is smaller
than the total number of motifs in the E. coli regulatory
network [7], because Tractor_DB contains putative regulatory sites for only 84 E. coli TFs, due to the intrinsic limitations of the computational strategies employed to
identify putative regulatory sites, i.e: some TFs do not have
enough known binding sites to build a statistically significant weight matrix, and in average only 47% of E. coli
genes have orthologs in the other 29 genomes.
Conservation of AL motifs
We calculated the mean SOS of the interactions involved
in the 28 AL motifs in the E. coli network (MAL). Then, we
sampled 1000 random groups of 28 interactions from the
E. coli network and calculated the mean SOS for each
group. The mean and standard deviation of the 1000 random means were subsequently calculated. These measures were then used to assess the statistical significance of
the MAL, through the calculation of the corresponding Z
score and p-value.
Conservation of FF motifs
We calculated correlations for the three pairs of regulatory
interactions (their SOS) that form FF motifs. (Actually, we
took the 111 FF motifs in the E. coli network and calculated the Pearson Correlation Coefficient of the three pairs
of 111 sets of SOS of homologous interactions.) First, we
calculated the mean SOS values corresponding to the TFXTFY, the TFX-A, and the TFY-A interactions from all the FF
motifs in the network. Then, we calculated the standard
deviation value of these three interactions and the covariance of the three possible pairs of interactions (TFX-TFY/
TFX-A, TFX-TFY/TFY-A and TFX-A/TFY-A) in the set of 111 FF
motifs. Finally, we calculated the correlations of the mean
SOS values of the three interaction pairs. For instance, we
calculated the correlation between the SOS of all the TFXTFY interactions and all the TFX-A interactions (cor1) using
the equation

N
∑ SOS XYi − M XY SOS XA i − M XA
i =0
,

where N is the number of TFX-TFY (or TFX-A) regulatory
interactions, i.e., 111; SOSXYi and SOSXAi are the SOS of
the i-th TFX-TFY interaction and the i-th TFX-A interaction,
respectively; and MXY and MXA are the mean SOS of the
TFX-TFY interactions and the TFX-A interactions, respectively. (Correlations between the other two pairs of interactions were calculated analogously.)
Since the denominator of the SOS computes the number
of organisms for which a site orthologous to the E. coli
original site appears (i.e., organisms with orthologous TFs
and structural genes to those involving the E. coli regulatory interaction) this correlation does not assess whether
a trio of E. coli genes involved in a FF motif co-occur in
other organisms. Instead, it assesses whether a trio of E.
coli regulatory links appear together in other organisms
that bear orthologs for the three genes.
To assess the statistical significance of the correlations calculated for each pair of interactions, we randomly sampled 1000 groups of 111 triads of interactions from the E.
coli network, and calculated the corresponding 1000 triplets of correlations. Then, we calculated the mean and
standard deviation of each of these three random sets of
correlations and the Z score and p-value corresponding to
the three true correlation values.
We also extracted the 4089 pairs of computationally predicted E. coli co-regulated genes from Tractor_DB (i.e.: all
pairs of genes predicted to be regulated by the same individual TF). We then calculated the Pearson correlation
coefficient of the SOS corresponding to the regulatory
links that connect the TF with the genes that form each
pair. The calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient
and the assessment of its statistical significance were carried out as described above for the FF motif (in this case
only pairs of interactions were randomly sampled to calculate the Z score).
Conservation of regulatory sites and TU structure
The conservation of the structure of each E. coli TU was
assessed using the qualitative classification proposed by
Itoh et al. [29]. Briefly, an orthologous TU is classified as
Identical if its structure, number of genes and order are the
same than the E. coli TU at the center of the analysis; as
Similar if the structure is only partly conserved (allowing
translocations, deletion and up to two insertions); as
Destroyed if at least two orthologous genes of the E. coli

TU are found, but they belong to different orthologous
TUs; and finally, as Lost when at most one ortholog to the
genes of the E. coli TU is found.
We labeled each orthologous TU using this classification
system, and associated the label of each TU to the SOS of
the regulatory site(s) found at their regulatory regions.
TUs were clustered into four groups according to the SOS
of their regulatory sites: TUs with SOS between 0 and
0.13, TUs with SOS between 0.14 and 0.36, TUs with SOS
between 0.37 and 0.59 and TUs with SOS between 0.6
and 1 as in Espinosa et al. (2005) [5].
To find out whether the resulting association is statistically significant with respect to all possible associations of
SOS and TU structure conservation we randomized the
association between TUs and regulatory sites, keeping
both SOS frequencies and the frequencies of the four categories of TUs structure conservation. This randomization
was iterated 1000 times and for each randomization we
calculated the resulting ratios of Identical and Similar TUs
to Destroyed and Lost TUs in each group of SOS. Finally,
the mean and standard deviation of each SOS group ratio
was calculated, as well as the corresponding Z scores and
p-values.
