Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is widely used in population genetic and phylogenetic
studies in animals. However, such studies can generate misleading results if the species concerned
contain nuclear copies of mtDNA (Numts) as these may amplify in addition to, or even instead of,
the authentic target mtDNA. The aim of this study was to determine if Numts are present in Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes, to characterise any Numts detected, and to assess the utility of using mtDNA
for population genetics studies in this species.
Results: BLAST searches revealed large numbers of Numts in the Ae. aegypti nuclear genome on
146 supercontigs. Although the majority are short (80% < 300 bp), some Numts are almost full
length mtDNA copies. These long Numts are not due to misassembly of the nuclear genome
sequence as the Numt-nuclear genome junctions could be recovered by amplification and
sequencing. Numt evolution appears to be a complex process in Ae. aegypti with ongoing genomic
integration, fragmentation and mutation and the secondary movement of Numts within the nuclear
genome.
The PCR amplification of the putative mtDNA nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase
subunit 4 (ND4) gene from 166 Southeast Asian Ae. aegypti mosquitoes generated a network with
two highly divergent lineages (clade 1 and clade 2). Approximately 15% of the ND4 sequences were
a composite of those from each clade indicating Numt amplification in addition to, or instead of,
mtDNA. Clade 1 was shown to be composed at least partially of Numts by the removal of clade
1-specific bases from composite sequences following enrichment of the mtDNA. It is possible that
all the clade 1 sequences in the network were Numts since the clade 2 sequences correspond to
the known mitochondrial genome sequence and since all the individuals that produced clade 1
sequences were also found to contain clade 2 mtDNA-like sequences using clade 2-specific
primers. However, either or both sets of clade sequences could have Numts since the BLAST

searches revealed two long Numts that match clade 2 and one long Numt that matches clade 1.
The substantial numbers of mutations in cloned ND4 PCR products also suggest there are both
recently-derived clade 1 and clade 2 Numt sequences.
Conclusion: We conclude that Numts are prevalent in Ae. aegypti and that it is difficult to
distinguish mtDNA sequences due to the presence of recently formed Numts. Given this, future
population genetic or phylogenetic studies in Ae. aegypti should use nuclear, rather than mtDNA,
markers.

Background
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been used extensively
over the last three decades in population genetic and phylogenetic studies in a wide range of animals from Drosophila to humans (e.g. [1-4]). The advantages of mtDNA
include its general lack of recombination that results in a
single demographic history for the whole molecule, and
high copy number which allows ease of amplification [5].
Further, the relatively high mutation rate of mtDNA generates correspondingly high levels of polymorphism and
divergence [5]. This makes mtDNA particularly informative for the determination of genetic population structure
and inference of population history within species as well
as for deducing phylogenetic relationships between
closely related species. MtDNA has been applied to many
insect taxa including bees [6] and ants [7], in addition to
medically important insects such as Anopheles [8-10] and
Aedes mosquitoes [11,12] where it is particularly important to estimate gene flow for vector control purposes
[13,14]. Most recently, the use of mtDNA sequences has
been proposed for several DNA bar-coding initiatives for
taxonomic identification and biodiversity assessment
[15].
However, mtDNA also has its disadvantages. MtDNA data
can be misleading in population and phylogenetic studies
as it is particularly prone to selective sweeps [16]; it can
introgress with relative ease between species [17]; and its
population dynamics may be driven by intracellular symbionts [18]. One problem that can be particularly difficult
to detect is the presence of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (Numts) [19,20]. Numts result from the translocation of mitochondrial sequences from the mitochondrial
genome into the nuclear genome and, once integrated,
these non-functional sequences accumulate mutations
freely. The potential for Numt amplification in addition
to, or even instead of, the authentic target mtDNA
sequence can seriously confound population genetic and
phylogenetic analyses (reviewed in [21,22]). For example,
the mistaken inclusion of Numt sequences in an mtDNA
phylogeny resulted in incorrect phylogenetic relationships being proposed within the South American bird
genus Scytalopus [23,24]. The high prevalence of Numts in
gorillas has also been problematic as they initially
obscured the presence of two genetically divergent groups

of gorillas which has important implications for understanding their evolutionary history and future conservation [25-27].
In 2001, over 82 different eukaryotes, including 20 insect
species, were known to have Numts [22]. However, there
have been numerous reports of Numts since then, for
example, in gorillas [25], domestic cats [28], chickens
[29], and several insects such as bees [30] and ants [31].
Although taxonomically widespread, there is substantial
variation among species in Numt copy number [32]. Even
within insects, Numt copy number varies greatly with
high numbers in Tribolium flour beetles, honeybee and the
brown mountain grasshopper [30,33], but few or none in
Drosophila and Anopheles mosquitoes [32]. Although a
positive correlation between Numt copy number and
genome size is not clear cut [29,32], genome size may partially explain taxonomic variation in Numt copy number
[22]. In this context it worth noting that the genome of Ae.
aegypti is particularly large, 1.3 Gb [34]. Numt fragments
tend to be small, with the vast majority (>90%) less than
1 kb, and often less than 100 bp [30,32,35]. The longest
Numts have been found in species with high Numt copy
number, such as humans, mouse and rice [32]. Controlling for size of mtDNA, the largest reported Numt to date
is 14,654 bp in humans which corresponds to ~88% of
the mitochondrial genome [36].
MtDNA has been widely used to study genetic population
structure in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, the organism of study
here [37-41]. This mosquito is thought to have spread relatively recently from its ancestral home in Africa to the
rest of the Tropics where they are important vectors of
dengue and yellow fever [42,43]. An understanding of
genetic population structure and gene flow in Ae. aegypti
is therefore of particular importance as this information is
required for vector control [44-46]. The presence of
Numts in Ae. aegypti could therefore seriously confound
the interpretation of previous population genetic studies
in Ae. aegypti as well as restrict the use of mtDNA in future
studies.
Numt presence can manifest itself in several ways including: PCR ghost bands; extra bands in restriction profiles;
sequence ambiguities; and unexpected phylogenetic

placement ([22] and references therein). In our mitochondrial sequences of this species we found a significant
proportion of sequence ambiguities suggestive of the presence of Numts. In general, previous authors have not
reported sequence ambiguities in Ae. aegypti. The study by
Paduan and Ribolla [47] is one exception but here the
sequence ambiguities were attributed to heteroplasmy
(where wild type and mutant mitochondrial genomes coexist in a cell [48]). Another possible indication of the
presence of Numts is the deep clade structure within many
worldwide populations of Ae. aegypti. Two divergent
mtDNA clades have been reported from: Mexico [37,49];
Thailand [38]; Venezuela [41]; Australia [50]; and the
Americas [40]. The aims of this study are therefore to
determine if Numts are present in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes,
to characterise any Numts present, and to assess the utility
of using mtDNA for population genetics studies in this
species. Using a combined experimental and bioinformatics approach utilizing the recent genome sequence of Ae.
aegypti (available at http://aaegypti.vectorbase.org/
Genome/Home/) [34] we show here that Numts are prevalent in Ae. aegypti and that many previous studies have
likely included Numt sequences in their mtDNA
sequences. Finally, we discuss the implications of the use
of mtDNA in future population genetic studies of this species.

7 supercontigs have sequences corresponding to 6 or
more contiguous mtDNA genes. The remaining supercontigs contain one to three smaller fragments of mtDNA-like
sequence with each fragment spanning no more than
three genes. For these longer Numts there appears to be
some pattern across supercontigs in the genetic make up
of the Numts. For example, supercontigs 1.348, 1.62 and
1.287 all contain a long Numt that spans the contiguous

Results
Numt identification using BLAST searches
Nucleotide BLAST searches of the Ae. aegypti genome
sequence with each of the protein-coding genes from the
mtDNA sequence of Ae. aegypti (GenBank accession
number: EU352212) identified Numts on 135 different
genomic supercontigs (using a cutoff E value of 10-4) or
98 supercontigs (using a cutoff E value of 10-14) (Figure
1). An additional 11 supercontigs were found to contain
Numts derived from the tRNA and rRNA genes. Any overlap of supercontigs due to misassembly would result in
fewer, but longer, Numts being detected. Assuming that
overlap of the supercontig sequences is minimal, the
number and size of Numts detected here should be reliable estimates. The Numts appeared to have originated
from all over the mitochondrial genome, with longer
genes typically having given rise to more Numts.
Sequence identities of Numts with the mtDNA sequence
ranged from 83% to 100%. The shortest Numts found
were 28 bp for protein coding regions (e.g. a CO1 fragment on supercontig 1.695, E value = 3 × 10-5) and 63 bp
for non-protein coding regions (tRNA-Arg and tRNA-Ala
on supercontig 1.774, E value = 4 × 10-25). The majority of
Numts were less than 300 bp in length (Table 1).

Although the majority of Numts are small in length, the
penultimate column in Figure 1 shows that 16 supercontigs contain Numts that span two or more genes. Of these,

genes ND1, ND2, and CO1 as well as part of the non-contiguous ND4L gene. In addition, supercontigs 1.600,
1.765 and 1.929 span the contiguous genes ND2, CO1,
CO2, ATP8, ATP6, CO3, ND3 and ND5. With the exception of the first two, this set of contiguous genes is also
contained by the Numt on supercontig 1.357. Although
these contiguous genes were detected by BLAST using each
protein coding gene individually, alignments between the
mtDNA and the supercontigs showed that in all cases the
Numts were contiguous across all coding and non-coding
regions with E values < 10-14. Despite their apparent similarity, the start and end positions of these long Numts differ in every case. There are also two supercontigs (1.363
and 1.593) that contain almost full length mtDNA copies.
It is possible that the long Numts identified by the BLAST
search may not be true Numts but instead the result of
misassembly during construction of this rather large and
repetitive genome sequence. To address this question we
investigate the detailed composition of the five longest
putative Numts with the highest matches to the mtDNA
sequence, which were those mostly likely to be due to
misassembly. Figure 2 shows how these putative Numts
differ from the mtDNA sequence. The two longest putative Numts on supercontigs 1.593 and 1.363 are almost
full length and match almost completely with the mtDNA
sequence. In supercontig 1.363, the CO1 gene has the
greatest number of mismatches with respect to the

mtDNA sequence, having one coding and 14 silent mutations. The ATP6, ND5 and ND6 genes and the six tRNAs
between ND3 and ND5 have a small number of substitution mutations but there are no stop codons. All the indels
are of a single base in simple sequence repeats of the same
base so it is hard to exclude sequencing error. In the case
of supercontig 1.363 the mtDNA-like sequence could
therefore be due to genome sequence misassembly.
Supercontig 1.593 makes a more convincing case for a
Numt as although there are only a small number of silent
and coding mutations (in the CO2, ATP8, ATP6, CYTB
and ND1 genes) the indels are not all single base differences in simple sequence repeats and there is a stop codon
in the ND1 gene. The placement of the mtDNA sequence
at the end of supercontig 1.1330 (Figure 2) could be a sign
of misassembly. However, this sequence contains no stop
codons or frameshift mutations.
Supercontigs 1.600 and 1.765 have even greater numbers
of substitutions compared to the mtDNA sequence and
this coupled with the presence of stop codons is very clear
evidence that these are Numt sequences. In all five of these
long Numts the majority of substitutions are synonymous. This is not inconsistent with their being Numts as
many of the observed substitutions may have occurred in
the mtDNA rather than the Numt [22,24] as, based on
Drosophila, the mitochondrial mutation rate is likely to be
~10 times higher than the nuclear mutation rate [51]. It is
interesting to note that the gene fragments at the start of
the Numt on supercontig 1.363, and at the starts and ends
of the Numts on supercontigs 1.600 and 1.765, have
much higher numbers of substitutions (indicated in Figure 2) with respect to the mtDNA sequence than the
remaining genes in these Numts. This pattern is unlikely
to indicate misassembly since it is found on Numts with
both high and low levels of differentiation from the mitochondrial sequence. This pattern more likely indicates a
heterogenous ancestry for these Numts.
Recovered nuclear genomic sequences
To further test the possibility of genome misassembly
underlying the highly mt-DNA like sequences on Supercontigs 1.363, 1.593 and 1.1330, we designed and used
primers to amplify genomic DNA fragments of 400–450
bp that span the transition between non-mtDNA-like
sequence and the putative Numt (Table 2). (At the start of
the Numt on supercontig 1.1330 and the end of the Numt
on 1.593 there is little or no flanking regions (Figure 2) so
these were not amplified.) Interestingly, primers designed
to amplify across the Numt junction on supercontig
1.1330 did not recover the original sequence but instead
a sequence (GenBank accession number: FJ463415) that
differed from the original by 28 base substitutions and 5
indels of 1–4 bp distributed throughout the 412 bp
amplified fragment. This sequence could not be found in

the Ae. aegypti genome sequence by a BLAST search.
Instead, this BLAST search identifed another similar
sequence of 200 bp on supercontig 1.43 (E value 5 × 1072) that differed from the query sequence by 12 base substitutions throughout. Rather than indicating that supercontig 1.1330 contains missassembled mtDNA sequence,
the finding of similar but different junction sequences
may instead indicate there are sets of related Numts. The
sequences of the Numt junctions at the starts and ends of
the Numt on supercontig 1.363 and the start of the Numt
on 1.593 (GenBank accession numbers: FJ463412–
FJ463414) fully recovered the database genome
sequences. Overall, the sequence data on Numt junctions
indicate that the long mtDNA-like sequences on these
supercontigs are true Numts rather than the result of
genome misassembly.
Deep clade structure of putative mitochondrial haplotypes
To determine if Numts may be a problem in mtDNAbased population genetic studies of Ae. aegypti, we amplified and sequenced the putative mitochondrial gene nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH)
subunit 4 (ND4) from natural populations of Ae. aegypti.
A total of 763 usable bases of the ND4 gene was generated
from 166 Ae. aegypti mosquito individuals collected from
Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia. Of these, 141
sequences were unambiguous and corresponded to 38
unique haplotypes (GenBank accession numbers:
FJ428759–FJ428796) varying in frequency from 1 to 50.
In a median-joining (MJ) network, these haplotypes fell
into two divergent clades with both clades containing
individuals from all three countries (Figure 3). The core
sequences in each clade were separated by 17 mutations,
16 of which were synonymous changes. The one non-synonymous mutation was a conservative amino acid change
from Ile to Val. The A+T content of the clade 1 and clade
2 core haplotypes was 76.4% and 75.6% respectively, typical of insect mtDNA. There were no frameshift or stop
codon mutations within or between the two clades.
Within clade 1 there were four non-synonymous mutations and within clade 2, two non-synonymous mutations. Clade 1 and clade 2 have somewhat similar
topologies with a high frequency core haplotype. However, clade 1 has a more star-like structure with many individuals differing from the core by 1–4 mutations whereas

in clade 2 several haplotypes are quite divergent from the
core.
In addition to the 141 clear sequences we also obtained
25 ambiguous sequences, corresponding to ~15% of the
total sample. The ambiguous sequences possessed double
peaks at 9–17 sites all of which were sites that differentiated the two clades. Since the forward primer used here
differed from those used in previous studies [41] we
repeated the amplification and sequencing of 12 individuals with ambiguous sequences using the orginal primers
that amplified a shorter 359 bp fragment corresponding
to the 3' end of our amplicon. Even for these shorter fragments, the ambiguities were consistently present, in the
same individuals and involving the same sites that differed between the two clades. This situation was not
changed even by redesign of the reverse primers. These

sequence ambiguities indicate that Numts are being
amplified instead of, or together with, Ae. aegypti mtDNA.
The core sequence of clade 2 has a 100% sequence identity with the mtDNA sequence of Ae. aegypti (GenBank
accession number: EU352212) which indicates that clade
1 most likely comprises Numts.
Confirmation that clade 1 contains Numt sequences
Mitochondrial DNA was enriched from five fresh individuals from Chiang Mai, Thailand. The ND4 gene region
was amplified and sequenced from both the total
genomic DNA (prior to purification) and the enriched
mtDNA for all individuals. The core clade 2 sequence was
obtained for three individuals for both the total genomic
DNA and the enriched mtDNA. However, the total
genomic DNA of the remaining two individuals yielded
ambiguous sequences that were composites of a clade 1
sequence and the clade 2 core sequence. Following enrichment, the mtDNA fraction generated a clear clade 2
sequence (Figure 4). In addition to confirming the
sequence of the mtDNA, this demonstrates that the clade
1 sequences in these two individuals are due to Numts.

If all the clade 1 sequences obtained from the Southeast
Asian mosquitoes were Numts we would also expect an
mtDNA sequence to be present in each individual. We
therefore developed primers that amplify 282 bp of the

ND4 gene from clade 2 (i.e. known mtDNA-like)
sequences only (Table 2). These clade 2/mtDNA-specific
primers had 3' termini at bases that distinguished clade 2
from clade 1. The PCR conditions under which these
primers were specific for the clade 2/mtDNA sequence
were determined using clade 1 and clade 2 PCR products
as templates. Under these conditions the mtDNA-specific
primers generated PCR products from all individuals that
had previously given rise to unambiguous clade 1
sequences using the original primers. Nine of these amplicons were sequenced and all sequences were confirmed to
fall into clade 2. For sequences of both clades to be
present within an individual, at least one of the sequences
must be a Numt. Based on the results of the mtDNA
enrichment which showed clade 1 Numts and that the
known mtDNA sequence corresponds to clade 2, the most
parsimonious explanation is that all the clade 1 sequences
are Numts. However, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the clade 2/mtDNA specific primers are amplifying
clade 2-like Numts such as those detected on supercontigs
1.593 and 1.363 by the BLAST searches.
Sequences from cloned PCR products
To further assess the extent of Numt presence in Ae. aegypti
we also cloned and sequenced PCR products of the ND4
gene from two individuals from which we had obtained
ambiguous sequences. We expected Numts to be characterised by being present as multiple, not necessarily
closely related, sequences within an individual and with
the possible presence of stop codon and/or frameshift
mutations. Mitochondrial genes on the other hand
should be comprised primarily of one sequence with the
possible existence of sequence variants differing by one
(or at most two) mutations due to Taq error during amplification captured by the cloning process, assuming an
error rate of 7.3 × 10-5 per bp per duplication [52]. This
logic was also used by Arctander [24] to distinguish a
Numt and mitochondrial sequence. However, contrary to
our expectation, we found that for both individuals each
clade contained multiple, divergent cloned sequences
with around one third of the mutations being amino acid
changes (Figure 5). Those sequences which cluster within
a few mutations of the sequence inferred by direct
sequencing of the corresponding original PCR product
could just be the result of Taq error. However, even if the
Taq error rate was higher than predicted, there are at least
four outlier sequences that differ by 7–9 mutations from
the original PCR-based sequence which cannot be attributed to Taq error alone. For example, in Clade 2 one haplotype differs from the putative mtDNA sequence in that
individual by seven mutations including one non-synonymous substitution and one stop codon. These divergent
sequences are most likely Numt sequences, indicating that
there are both recently derived clade 1- and clade 2-like
Numts. These novel variants of the ND4 gene could not be

ing. At 15.46 kb and 13.07 kb, the Numts on supercontigs
1.363 and 1.593, respectively, are amongst the longest
reported to date. Other species with long Numts are

sequenced strain or they may be revealed in the future
when a more complete assembled version of the genome
is released.

Discussion
High numbers of Numts in the Ae. aegypti nuclear genome
The results of the BLAST searches demonstrate the presence of high numbers of Numts in the genome of Ae.
aegypti with Numts detected on a total of 146 different
supercontigs. This is comparable to other insects that are
considered to have large numbers of Numts including the
honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the Tribolium flour beetle
which have Numts at an estimated 575 and 57 genomic
locations, respectively [30]. It is notable that other dipterans studied to date, D. melanogaster and An. gambiae,
which have few or no Numts, have much smaller genomes
than Ae. aegypti; 176 Mb and 278 Mb compared to 1.3 Gb
for Ae. aegypti. Almost half the genome of Ae. aegypti is
composed of transposable elements [34] which may indicate that this species is generally unable to rid itself of non
functional DNA, including Numts.

In agreement with studies in other taxa [e.g. [30]], the
majority of the Numts detected here were short. However,
we also noted many long Numts with six being greater
than 7 kb in length with the two longest on supercontigs
1.363 and 1.593 (Figure 1). Although these latter two differed very little from the mitochondrial sequence they
appear to be real rather than the result of misassembly as
there are some frameshift and stop mutations (albeit very
few in number) and the presence of Numt-genome junction points was confirmed by amplification and sequenc-

In general, as the Numts in Ae. aegypti get progressively
shorter in length their similarity to the mitochondrial
sequence decreases (Figure 2). This is consistent with the
repeated movement of long mtDNA sequences to the
nucleus which then decay through time becoming both
fragmented and mutated. This is also consistent with our
observation that, despite some variation among genes, all
the mitochondrial genes are represented in Numts in our
study. This is similar to the situation in humans [36,54]
and mouse and Ciona [32] but contrasts with several other
studies which have noted a very marked preference for
particular mtDNA genes to become Numts [29,30]. The
situation in which the Numt on supercontig 1.1330 was
found to have a homologous Numt with the same end
point but slightly different genomic flanking sequence has
been found previously [54]. Such Numt copies could have
arisen from the secondary integration of Numts from one
nuclear genomic location to another [28,36,55]. Genomic
rearrangements involving Numts seem common [36]. In
accord with this, the pattern seen here of high substitution
rates at the extreme ends of three of the long Numts indicates that these Numts could have been formed by the
homologous recombination of long mtDNA sequences
into genome positions that already contained Numts.
However, it is also difficult to exclude the possibility of
genome misassembly in giving rise to this pattern. Overall, our data lead to the conclusion that Numt evolution
in Ae. aegypti is a very complex and dynamic process.
Origin of Clade 1 and Clade 2 type Numts
The genome sequence was obtained from a highly inbred
strain of Ae. aegypti [34]. It seems unfeasible that this
strain could have maintained two mtDNA sequences, corresponding to clades 1 and 2, through successive bottlenecked generations. The evidence presented here
demonstrates clearly that at least some, and possibly all,
clade 1 sequences originate from Numts and not from
mtDNA. Not only do the clade 1 sequences generated
from ND4 PCR products (Figure 3) correspond to the
sequences removed by mtDNA enrichment and the Numt
on supercontig 1.1330, but clade 2 sequences were also
found in all individuals that generated clade 1 sequences.
The clade 2 sequences generated from ND4 PCR products
(Figure 3) correspond to the reported mtDNA sequence.
However, it is possible that not all of these clade 2
sequences have arisen from mtDNA as the data indicate
that there are also very recently derived Numts: firstly, the

putative Numts on supercontigs 1.363 and 1.593 are
almost identical to the mtDNA sequences; and secondly,
the clade 2 sequences of cloned PCR products have high
numbers of mutations (Figure 5). Although it could be
argued that these findings are the result of misassembly of
the nuclear genome sequence and high Taq error rate,
respectively, these do not appear to be the most parsimonious arguments.
The sites that differ between our clade 1 and clade 2
sequences are the same as those found in a large number
of other studies [37-41,56] using the putative ND4
mtDNA gene. In this and previous studies, the primers
used were designed using mtDNA sequences from related
taxa (Ae. albopictus). It has been noted that this strategy is
inherently prone to the co-amplifcation of Numts [57].
Many of the previous studies e.g. [37-39,41] relied on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) coupled
with sequencing of a few individuals. If co-amplifying
Numt sequences were present and formed additional
bands on the gene they may have been disregarded, as
SSCP gels can contain background bands due to the same
sequence adopting alternative conformations. This may
explain why, besides this one, there has only been one
other report [47] of heterogenous sequences using this
marker. In this latter case the authors attributed the heterogenous sequences to heteroplasmy because the mixed
sequences contained the variation found in their clade 1
and clade 2 sequences which they believed to all be true
mtDNA.
There are at least two possible explanations for the origin
of the clade 1 and clade 2 type Numts. Firstly, the Numts
could have originated from the same species at different
time points with the clade 1 sequences being entirely due
to Numts and transferring at an earlier time. The deep
clade structure would therefore have been formed by the
movement of clade-1 like mtDNA into the nuclear
genome, presumably in Africa of the order of one million
years ago (making the assumption that divergence rates
will have been similar to those of mtDNA estimated at
2.3% per million years [58]). This might at first appear
inconsistent with the lack of amplification of other
recently derived Numts, particularly of sequences intermediate between clades 1 and 2 that might be expected
from continual mtDNA transfers to the nucleus. However,
the ease with which clade 1 Numts are amplified could be
explained by their being present in multiple copies in the
genome, for example, due to secondary integration as suggested above. The one coding and 16 silent substitutions
separating clade 1 and clade 2 sequences indicate the
action of purifying selection. These substitutions would
therefore have accumulated primarily along the clade 2
mtDNA lineage. This is consistent with the clade 1
sequences being multi-copy Numts as their independ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/11

ently acquired substitutions would not be apparent in
sequenced PCR products. The star-like structure of the
clade 1 sequences in the haplotype network is, however,
hard to explain under this scenario.
A second possible explanation is that both clade 1 and
clade 2 Numts are of recent origin but have originated
from different source populations/species with divergent
mtDNAs. A likely (but not only) candidate for a source of
divergent mtDNA is the forest form of Ae. aegypti from
Africa. The domestic form of Ae. aegypti studied here
derives from Africa where there is known to be ongoing
gene flow between it and the forest form [43]. Putative
mtDNA ND4 haplotypes of the forest form are shared
with those of the domestic form in West Africa [59] and
(from a comparison with our sequences) these comprise
both clade 1 and clade 2 sequences. However, it is possible that the forest and domestic form have recently made
secondary contact following a period of allopatry during
which their mtDNA could have diverged. Clade 1 and
clade 2 Numts could have arisen pre or post secondary
contact and in either the forest and/or the domestic form.
These alternative hypotheses for the origin of the clade 1
and clade 2 Numts (single source at different times versus
different sources and recent origin) could be distinguished by sequencing enriched mtDNA from a large
number of individuals, ideally including those of the forest form. Under the second hypothesis at least some individuals should have clade 1 type mtDNA. This should be
performed in conjunction with amplifications of the total
genomic DNA using clade specific primers to determine if
clade 1 or clade 2 Numt sequences are present.
Implications for inference of population history and
genetic structure
The unknowing inclusion of Numts sequences in mtDNA
based analyses could lead to mistaken inferences of population structure and population history. Since Ae. aegypti
mosquitoes have spread from Africa to the rest of the
Tropics relatively recently, the deep clade structure found
in previous studies has often been interpreted to suggest
colonization from at least two different source populations (and/or by many individuals) [38,40,46,60,61].
However, the deep clade structure could instead be due to
the presence of Numts. In this case, the two deep clades
could also mistakenly be interpreted to indicate the presence of two distinct species outside of Africa. This exemplifies the problem pointed out by Song et al. [62] that the
use of mtDNA genes for DNA barcoding could lead to the
overestimation of species numbers.

Although the putative mtDNA sequences can clearly
detect genetic population structure among regional populations of Ae. aegypti (Table 3), the reliability of differenti-

ation estimates would be affected by the inclusion of
Numts. This is particularly the case if the proportion of
Numt amplification is not consistent across populations.
This is suggested here by the notably lower proportion of
clade 1 amplification from the northwestern Thai population (χ2 = 22.02, df = 3, P < 0.001). If the clade 1
sequences are actually Numts, this results in a dramatic
increase of the apparent level of differentiation between
the northwest and eastern Thai populations (from FST of
0.088 to 0.28; Table 3).

Methods

There are a number of means by which Numt co-amplification can be limited such as mitochondrial purification
before DNA extraction, long PCR, reverse transcriptase
PCR, or using tissue rich in mtDNA (e.g. muscle) but none
are guaranteed to absolutely overcome the problem ([22]
and references therein). Perhaps the simplest solution to
the problem providing that the Numts are monophyletic
with respect to the mtDNA sequences, is their removal by
restriction enzyme digestion or their avoidance by the use
of mtDNA-specific primers [22]. However, these possible
solutions will not work here if, as the BLAST results and
sequences of clones indicate, there are very recently
derived Numt sequences. We therefore advocate that
future studies of population structure in Ae. aegypti use
other markers. With the genome sequence available there
are a large number of nuclear markers to choose from.

Conclusion

This genomic sequence was searched for Numts by
BLASTN [63] on VectorBase for each of the 13 proteincoding genes, 22 tRNA genes and 2 rRNA genes from the
Ae. aegypti mitochondrial genome sequence of 16,655 bp
(GenBank accession number: EU352212). Threshold levels for the inference of Numts from BLASTN hits were
taken as expectation values (E values) of 10-4 or 10-14, as
used in other studies [30,32,64]. We determined the
extent to which the hits against single genes were contiguous and due to single large Numts by carrying out alignments of the mtDNA genome with the regions of
supercontigs containing multiple hits using ClustalX
(1.83) [65,66]. The aligned sequences were visualized in
MEGA ver. 4 [67] to determine the lengths of Numt
sequences and to identify the Numt-supercontig junction
points. The same software was also used for the translation of protein coding sequences to identify missense
mutations and stop codons.

Using a variety of approaches we conclude that Numts are
prevalent in Ae. aegypti and that Numt evolution in Ae.
aegypti is a very complex and dynamic process. These data
also show that the deep clade structure we and others have
been obtaining when performing supposedly mtDNAbased studies in Ae. aegypti may in fact be due to Numts.
Some interpretations of the population and colonisation
history of Ae. aegypti made to date may therefore be unreliable. We advocate that future studies of genetic population structure and gene flow in Ae. aegypti avoid using
mtDNA data and use nuclear markers instead.

Extraction of genomic DNA, PCR amplication and direct
sequencing
DNA was extracted from individual mosquitoes using a
standard phenol/chloroform method [68]. The final DNA
pellet was suspended in 20 μl water (dH2O) and was
diluted 1:20 to make a working solution. A fragment of the
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase
(NADH) subunit 4 mitochondrial (ND4) gene was amplified using the primers: ND4F (5'-GTTTAGATATARTTTCTTAYGG-3') and ND4R (5'-CTTCGDCTTCCWADWCGTTC-

BLASTN searches of Ae. aegypti genome sequence
This study utilized the genomic sequence of Ae. aegypti
(version-AaegL1) sequenced from the Liverpool LVP
strain to approximately 8× coverage by the Broad Institute
and The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The
genome sequence has over 1.31 billion bp and comprises
4,758 supercontigs but these have not yet been physically
mapped to chromosomes http://aaegypti.vectorbase.org/

3'). The ND4R primer was the same as that used in previous
studies in Mexico [37,49], Thailand [38] and Venezuela
[41]. The ND4F primer used here was designed in Primer3
ver. 0.4.0 [69] from an alignment of the ND4 region of the
mtDNA of Aedes albopictus (GenBank accession number:
AY072044), Anopheles gambiae (GenBank accession
number: L20934) and Anopheles quadrimaculatus (GenBank
accession number: L04272). The combination of primers
used here therefore amplified a fragment that had the same
3' end as that of the previous studies but which was longer,
being 763 bp rather than 359 bp in length.
The concentrations of the PCR reactants were 1 × ammonium buffer (CLP, Northampton, UK), 2.5 mM MgCl2,
200 μM dNTP and 0.4 μM primers. Amplifications were
carried out in 50 μl volumes using 1 μl of template DNA.
The PCR programme was modified from the previous
Thailand and Mexico studies [37,38,49]. In an intial hot
start, the reagents were heated to 95°C for 2 mins prior to
the addition of 1.25 units of Thermoprime plus DNA
polymerase (CLP, Northampton, UK). This was followed
by 38 amplification cycles consisting of 30 sec at 92°C, 1
min at 50°C and 40 sec at 72°C, followed by a final extension for 5 mins at 72°C. PCR reactions were carried out on
a GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 thermocycler (Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, UK). PCR products were purified
using Montage columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)
and sequenced in both directions (Macrogen Inc., Seoul,
Korea). DNA sequences were assembled using the
Sequencher multiple sequence editor program ver. 4.5
(Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, USA) and checked
manually. A total length of 763 bp of ND4 sequence was
obtained from each individual.
Genetic analyses
Median joining networks were constructed using DNA
Alignment ver. 1.0.0.3 and Network ver. 4.1.0.8 http://
www.fluxus-technology.com[70]. Genetic differentiation
between pairs of populations (FST values) was estimated
from the sequence data using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) in ARLEQUIN version 3.01 [71]. Significance was estimated by 1000 permuations of the
haplotypes between the populations.
Cloning and sequencing of PCR products
PCR products of the ND4 gene from individuals that
yielded a mixed clade 1 and clade 2 sequence were cloned
using the pGEM-T Vector System II kit according to the
manufacturer's instruction (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The same PCR primers were used to
amplify the cloned ND4 gene fragments from colonies
containing inserts. Colony material was prepared for PCR
by heating a small portion of an individual colony in 20
μl dH2O to 95°C for 5 mins and 0.5 μl of this was used in
PCR reaction volumes of 25 μl. The amplifications were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/11

performed using the same reactant concentrations as
above. The PCR conditions were initial denaturation at
94°C for 5 mins followed by 30 cycles of 92°C for 30 sec,
52°C for 1 min and 72°C for 40 sec, with a final extension
at 72°C for 7 mins. The PCR products were purified and
sequenced and the same procedures as outlined above
were used to check sequences and to construct a median
joining network.
Fresh mtDNA separation and PCR amplification
Laboratory-reared freshly killed Ae. aegypti mosquitoes
originating from Thailand were used for the isolation and
extraction of enriched mtDNA using an alkaline lysis
method [72]. For each individual, DNA was extracted
using a standard phenol/chloroform DNA extraction
method [68] from both the starting homogenate (which
contained both nuclear and mtDNA) and from the final
mtDNA-rich supernatant. PCR amplification and
sequencing of the ND4 region was carried out as above.
Additional PCR reactions
Primers designed and used for the specific amplification
of clade 2 ND4 gene sequences and for the amplification
of Numt junctions are given in Table 2 (see main text for
details of their application). PCR was performed as before
with the exception that no hot start was used and that the
annealing temperature was increased to 55°C to achieve
high specificity.
