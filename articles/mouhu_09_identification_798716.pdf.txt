Abstract
Background: We are studying the regulation of flowering in perennial plants by using diploid wild
strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.) as a model. Wild strawberry is a facultative short-day plant with an obligatory
short-day requirement at temperatures above 15°C. At lower temperatures, however, flowering
induction occurs irrespective of photoperiod. In addition to short-day genotypes, everbearing forms of
wild strawberry are known. In 'Baron Solemacher' recessive alleles of an unknown repressor, SEASONAL
FLOWERING LOCUS (SFL), are responsible for continuous flowering habit. Although flower induction has a
central effect on the cropping potential, the molecular control of flowering in strawberries has not been
studied and the genetic flowering pathways are still poorly understood. The comparison of everbearing
and short-day genotypes of wild strawberry could facilitate our understanding of fundamental molecular
mechanisms regulating perennial growth cycle in plants.
Results: We have searched homologs for 118 Arabidopsis flowering time genes from Fragaria by EST
sequencing and bioinformatics analysis and identified 66 gene homologs that by sequence similarity,
putatively correspond to genes of all known genetic flowering pathways. The expression analysis of 25
selected genes representing various flowering pathways did not reveal large differences between the
everbearing and the short-day genotypes. However, putative floral identity and floral integrator genes AP1
and LFY were co-regulated during early floral development. AP1 mRNA was specifically accumulating in the
shoot apices of the everbearing genotype, indicating its usability as a marker for floral initiation. Moreover,
we showed that flowering induction in everbearing 'Baron Solemacher' and 'Hawaii-4' was inhibited by
short-day and low temperature, in contrast to short-day genotypes.
Conclusion: We have shown that many central genetic components of the flowering pathways in
Arabidopsis can be identified from strawberry. However, novel regulatory mechanisms exist, like SFL that
functions as a switch between short-day/low temperature and long-day/high temperature flowering
responses between the short-day genotype and the everbearing 'Baron Solemacher'. The identification of
putative flowering gene homologs and AP1 as potential marker gene for floral initiation will strongly
facilitate the exploration of strawberry flowering pathways.

Background
Transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is one
of the most important developmental switches in plant's
life cycle. In annual plants, like Arabidopsis, flowering and
consequent seed production is essential for the survival of
the population until the following season. To assure
timely flowering in various environments, Arabidopsis utilizes several genetic pathways that are activated by various
external or internal cues. Light and temperature, acting
through photoperiod, light quality, vernalization and
ambient temperature pathways, are the most important
environmental factors regulating flowering time [1].
Moreover, gibberellin (GA) and autonomous pathways
promote flowering by responding to internal cues [2,3]. In
contrast to annual plants, the growth of perennials continues after generative reproduction, and the same developmental program is repeated from year to year. Regulation
of generative development in these species is even more
complex, because other processes like juvenility, winter
dormancy and chilling are tightly linked to the control of
flowering time.
In Arabidopsis photoperiodic flowering pathway, phytochrome (phy) and cryptochrome (cry) photoreceptors
perceive surrounding light signals and reset the circadian
clock feedback loop, including TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB
EXPRESSION), CCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1) and LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL) [47]. The central feature in the photoperiodic flowering is
the clock generated evening peak of CO (CONSTANS)
gene expression [8]. In long-day (LD) conditions, CO
peak coincidences with light resulting in accumulation of
CO protein in the leaf phloem and consequent activation
of the expression of FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T) [9]. FT
protein, in turn, moves to the shoot apex, and together
with FD triggers floral initiation by activating floral identity gene AP1 (APETALA 1) [10,11]. FT, together with
SOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1) and LFY (LEAFY) form also convergence points
for different flowering pathways, and therefore are called
flowering integrator genes [12].
In winter-annual ecotypes of Arabidopsis, MADS-box gene
FLC (Flowering Locus C) prevents flowering by repressing
FT and SOC1, and vernalization is needed to nullify its
function [13]. The major activator of FLC is FRI (FRIGIDA) [14], but several other proteins, including for example FRL1 (FRIGIDA-LIKE 1) [15], PIE (PHOTOPERIOD
INDEPENDENT EARLY FLOWERING 1) [16], ELF7 and
ELF8 (EARLY FLOWERING 7 and 8) [17], and VIP3 (VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE 3) [18] are also needed
to maintain high FLC expression. During vernalization,
FLC is down-regulated by VRN2-PRC2 (Vernalization 2 Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) protein complex containing low temperature activated VIN3 (VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3), allowing plants to flower [19,20].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/122

Autonomous and GA pathways respond to endogenous
cues to regulate flowering time. The role of the autonomous pathway is to promote flowering by lowering the
basal level of FLC transcription [3]. Autonomous pathway
consists of few sub-pathways, which include for example
RNA processing factors encoded by FCA, FPA, FLK
(FLOWERING LOCUS K), FY and LD (LUMINIDEPENDENS) [21], putative histone demethylases LDL1 and LDL2
(LSD1-LIKE 1 and 2) [22], and deacetylases FLD (Flowering locus D) and FVE [23,24]. GA pathway is needed to
induce LFY transcription and flowering in short-day (SD)
conditions [25].
Strawberries (Fragaria sp.) are perennial rosette plants,
belonging to the economically important Rosaceae family. Most genotypes of garden strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) and wild strawberry (F. vesca L.) are
Junebearing SD plants, which are induced to flowering in
decreasing photoperiod in autumn [26,27]. In some genotypes, flowering induction is also promoted by decreasing temperatures that may override the effect of the
photoperiod [27,28]. In contrast to promotion of flowering by decreasing photoperiod and temperature, these
"autumn signals" have opposite effect on vegetative
growth. Petiole elongation decreases after a few days, and
later, around the floral transition, runner initiation ceases
and branch crowns are formed from the axillary buds of
the crown [29,30]. Crown branching has a strong effect on
cropping potential as it provides meristems that are able
to initiate inflorescences [31].
In addition to SD plants, everbearing (EB) genotypes are
found in garden strawberry and in wild strawberry
[29,32]. Environmental regulation of induction of flowering in EB genotypes has been a topic of debate for a long
time. Several authors have reported that these genotypes
are day-neutral [29,33]. Recent findings, however, show
that long-day (LD) accelerates flowering in several EB Fragaria genotypes [34,35]. Interestingly, in wild strawberry
genotype 'Baron Solemacher' recessive alleles of SFL gene
locus (SEASONAL FLOWERING LOCUS) have been
shown to cause EB flowering habit [36]. SFL has not been
cloned, but it seems to encode a central repressor of flowering in wild strawberry. Consistent with the repressor
theory, LD grown strawberries have been shown to produce a mobile floral inhibitor that is able to move from
mother plant to the attached runner plant [37]. GA is one
candidate corresponding to this inhibitor, since exogenously applied GA has been shown to repress flowering in
strawberries [38,39].
Identification of central genes regulating flowering time
and EB flowering habit, as well as those controlling other
processes affecting flowering, is an important goal that
would greatly accelerate breeding of strawberry and other
soft fruit and fruit species of Rosaceae family. In this

Results
Environmental regulation of flowering in two EB
genotypes of wild strawberry
We studied the effect of photoperiod and temperature on
flowering time in two EB genotypes, 'Baron Solemacher',
which contains recessive alleles in SFL locus [40,41], and
'Hawaii-4'. Flowering time was determined by counting
the number of leaves in the main crown before formation
of the terminal inflorescence. In SD genotypes of the wild
strawberry, SD (<15 h) or, alternatively, low temperature
(~10°C) is needed to induce flowering [27]. In EB genotypes 'Baron Solemacher' and 'Rugen', instead, LD and
high temperature has been shown to accelerate generative
development [35], but careful analysis of the environmental regulation of flowering induction has so far been
lacking.

Both 'Baron Solemacher' and 'Hawaii-4' produced five to
six leaves in LD at 18°C before the emergence of the terminal inflorescence showing that they are very early-flowering in favorable conditions (Figure 1A and 1B). In
'Baron Solemacher', low temperature (11°C) or SD treatment for five weeks at 18°C clearly delayed flowering, but
low temperature did not have an additional effect on
flowering time in SD. Also in 'Hawaii-4', SD and low temperature delayed flowering, but all treatments differed
from each other. Compared to the corresponding LD
treatment, SD at 18°C doubled the number of leaves, and
low temperature (11°C) delayed flowering time by about
three leaves in both photoperiods. Thus, flowering induction in these EB genotypes is oppositely regulated by photoperiod and temperature than previously shown for the
SD genotypes [27].
Construction and sequencing of subtracted cDNA libraries
We constructed two subtracted cDNA libraries from LD
grown EB genotype 'Baron Solemacher' and SD genotype,
in order to identify differentially expressed flowering time
genes in these genotypes. Plants were grown in LD conditions, where the SD genotype stays vegetative and the EB
plants show early flowering. Pooled shoot apex sample
covering the floral initiation period was collected from the
EB genotype, and vegetative apices of the same age were

paper, we have searched Fragaria homologs with the
known Arabidopsis flowering time genes by EST sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Dozens of putative flowering genes corresponding to all known genetic pathways
regulating flowering time were identified. The expression
analysis of several candidate flowering time genes
revealed only few differences between the SD and EB wild
strawberries, including the presence or absence of AP1
mRNA in the apices of EB and SD genotypes, respectively.
Our data provides groundwork for detailed studies of
flowering time control in Fragaria using transcriptomics,
functional genomics and QTL mapping.

sampled from the SD genotype. Suppression subtractive
hybridization (SSH), the method developed for extraction
of differentially expressed genes between two samples
[42], was used to enrich either flowering promoting or
flowering inhibiting transcripts from EB and SD genotypes, respectively.
A total of 1172 ESTs was sequenced from the library
enriched with the genes of the SD genotype (SD library
subtracted with EB cDNA) and 1344 ESTs from the library
enriched with the EB genes (EB library subtracted with
cDNA of the SD genotype). 970 SD ESTs [Genbank:GH202443-GH203412] and 1184 EB ESTs [GenBank:GH201259-GH202442] passed quality checking.
Pairwise comparison of these EST datasets revealed that
there was very little overlap between the libraries. However, general distribution of the sequences to functional
categories (FunCat classification) did not reveal any major
differences between the two libraries (Additional file 1).
BLASTx searches against Arabidopsis, Swissprot and nonredundant databases showed that over 70% of the ESTs
gave a match in one or all of the three databases (Table 1).

(Table 1). We also performed tBLASTx searches against
TIGR plant transcript assemblies of Malus × domestica,
Oryza sativa and Vitis vinifera and found hits for 64-76%
of ESTs in these assemblies. Finally, the comparison of our
sequences with a current Fragaria unigene list at the
Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) showed that
38.2% of our ESTs are novel Fragaria transcripts. Taken
together, depending on the analysis, 15-22% of sequences
from SD genotype and 22-27% of EB sequences encode
novel proteins, or originate from untranslated regions of
mRNA. Moreover, the high number of novel Fragaria
sequences in our libraries indicates that SSH method efficiently enriched rare transcripts in the libraries.
Identification of flowering time genes
Flowering related genes were identified from our libraries
by BLASTx searches as described above and fourteen putative flowering time regulators were identified; four gene
homologs were present only in EB library, eight in SD
library, and two genes in both libraries. In figure 2, we
have summarized the Arabidopsis flowering pathways and
highlighted the putative homologous genes identified
from our EST collection. In general, candidate genes for all
major pathways were identified. In addition, 118 Arabidopsis flowering time genes were used as a query to search
publicly available GDR Fragaria EST and EST contig databases using tBLASTn. Sequences passing cut-off value of

1e-10 were further analysed by BLASTx algorithm against
Arabidopsis protein database, and those returning original
Arabidopsis protein were listed. Moreover, sequences that
were absent from Fragaria databases were similarly
searched from GDR Rosaceae EST database. In these
searches, 52 additional Fragaria sequences were identified. Moreover, the total number of 88 homologs of Arabidopsis flowering time genes were found among all
available Rosaceae sequences (Additional file 2).
Most genes of the Arabidopsis photoperiodic pathway were
found also in Fragaria, and some of the lacking genes were
present among Rosaceae ESTs (Table 2, Additional file 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/122

We found several genes encoding putative Fragaria photoreceptor apoproteins including phyA, phyC, cry2, ZTL
(ZEITLUPE) and FKF1 (FLAVIN BINDING KELCH
REPEAT F-BOX 1) [43]. Of the central circadian clock
genes, homologs of LHY and TOC1 [5,7] were present in
our EST libraries and GDR, respectively, but CCA1 [6] was
lacking from both Fragaria and Rosaceae databases. Furthermore, a putative Fragaria CO from the flowering regulating output pathway has been cloned earlier [44].
Among the regulators of CO transcription and protein stability, GI (GIGANTEA) [45] was identified from Rosaceae
and putative COP1, SPA3 and SPA4 [46,47] from Fragaria.
In addition to genes of the photoperiodic pathway,

homologs for both known sequences belonging to light
quality pathways, PFT1 (PHYTOCHROME AND FLOWERING TIME 1) and HRB1 (HYPERSENSITIVE TO RED
AND BLUE 1) [48,49], were found from our EST libraries.
For the vernalization pathway, we were not able to find
FLC-like sequences from our EST libraries or public Fragaria or Rosaceae EST databases by tBLASTn searches
although we used the FLC and FLC-like sequences from
Arabidopsis (MAF1-MAF5, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 1-5) and several other plant species as query
sequences [13,50,51]. Similarly, also FRI [14] was lacking
from Rosaceae ESTs but putative FRL (FRIGIDA-LIKE)
[15] sequences were identified in Fragaria. In addition, we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/122

identified several gene homologs belonging to the FRI
complex as well as other regulatory complexes (SWR1,
PAF) involved in promoting the expression of FLC (Table
3, Additional file 2) [17,52,53]. Also putative members of
FLC repressing PRC2 complex, were present in strawberry
ESTs. These include putative VIN3 (VERNALIZATION
INSENSITIVE 3) [19,20] that has been identified earlier
[54], and putative SWN1 (SWINGER 1), FIE (FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM), VRN1 (VERNALIZATION 1) and LHP1 (LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN
PROTEIN 1) [19,55,56], which were found in this investigation (Table 3, Additional file 2). However, putative
VRN2 that is needed for the repression of FLC by PRC2
was not found [19].

In addition to the photoperiod and the vernalization
pathways, we searched candidate genes for the autonomous and GA pathways. Several sequences corresponding
to Arabidopsis genes from both pathways were identified
suggesting the presence of these pathways also in Fragaria
(Table 4, Additional file 2). Among these genes we found
homologs for Arabidopsis FVE and SVP which have been
shown to control flowering in a specific thermosensory
pathway [24,57]. Moreover, some additional flowering
time regulators that are not placed to any specific pathway
were identified (Table 4, Additional file 2).
Identification of floral integrator genes in Fragaria
Sequencing of our EST collections did not reveal any
homologs for the floral integrator or identity genes such
as FT, SOC1, LFY or AP1 [12,58]. A full-length cDNA
sequence of SOC1 homolog [GenBank:FJ531999] and a
713 bp 3'-end fragment of putative LFY [GenBank:FJ532000] were isolated using PCR. Closest protein
homolog of the putative FvSOC1 was 72% identical Popu-

lus trichocarpa MADS5, and the putative FvLFY showed
highest amino acid identity (79%) to Malus domestica FL2.
Comparison to Arabidopsis showed that AtSOC1 and
AtLFY, respectively, were 66% and 75% identical with the
corresponding wild strawberry protein sequences (Figure
3A and 3B). FT homolog, instead, was not identified in
Fragaria despite of many attempts using degenerate PCR
and screening of cDNA library plaques and E.coli clones
from a variety of tissues and developmental conditions
with the Arabidopsis coding sequence (K. Folta, unpublished). However, a putative FT was found in Prunus and
Malus protein databases at NCBI. Among the other genes
belonging to the same gene family, homologs of MFT
(MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1) and ATC (ARABIDOPSIS
CENTRORADIALIS) [59] were present in GDR Fragaria
EST. Moreover, an EST contig corresponding to the floral
identity gene AP1 was found. The length of the translated
protein sequence of FvAP1 was 284 amino acids, being 30
amino acids longer than the corresponding Arabidopsis
sequence. However, FvAP1 EST contig contained an

(68%) with putative AP1 from Prunus persica (Figure 3C).
Moreover, the 5' sequence containing 187 amino acids
(the sequence before the unknown part) was 73% identical with the Arabidopsis AP1.
Gene expression analysis revealed few differences between
EB and SD genotypes
We compared the expression of selected flowering time
genes (Table 5) corresponding to each flowering pathway
in the leaf and shoot apex samples of EB and SD genotypes in order to explore the role of different pathways.
Only few of the analysed genes were differentially
expressed between the genotypes. Floral integrator gene
LFY was slightly up-regulated in the shoot apex samples of
EB (Table 6). Moreover, PCR expression analysis with two
different primer pairs showed that AP1 was specifically
expressed in EB apices correlating with the identity of the
meristems. Among the genes from different flowering
pathways, only two genes, vernalization pathway gene
ELF8 [17] and photoperiod pathway gene ELF3 [60], were
slightly differentially expressed between the genotypes
(Table 6).

Developmental regulation of floral integrator, floral
identity, and GA pathway genes
We analysed the developmental regulation of AP1, LFY,
SOC1, GA3ox and GA2ox transcription in the shoot apices
of LD grown plants of EB and SD genotype containing one
to four leaves. Ubiquitin, used as a control gene, was stable
between different developmental stages, but was amplified ~1 PCR cycle earlier in SD genotype (Additional file
3). Thus direct comparison between the genotypes is not
possible, but the trends during development are comparable. Three genes, AP1, LFY, and GA3ox, had clear developmental stage dependent expression pattern in EB apices,
showing biggest changes after one or two leaf stage (Figure
4). The expression of AP1 was detected in EB apices
already at one leaf stage, and its mRNA accumulated gradually reaching 6-fold increase at two leaf stage and 50-fold
increase at four leaf stage (Figure 4A). In parallel, transcription of LFY started to increase at 2-leaf stage, but the
change in its expression was much smaller (Figure 4B). A
floral integrator gene, SOC1, in contrast, did not show
clear developmental regulation (Figure 4C). Also GA
pathway was co-regulated with AP1 and LFY, since GA
biosynthetic gene GA3ox was strongly down-regulated
after two leaf stage (Figure 4D). In addition, GA catabolism gene, GA2ox, tended to follow changes in the expres-

shoot apex samples were collected from LD grown plants at
one to four leaf stage. Ct values were normalized against a
Ubiquitin [GenBank:DY672326] gene to get normalized ΔCt
values. The expression differences between one leaf stage
and later developmental stages were calculated from the formula 2ΔCt later developmental stage/2ΔCt one leaf stage. The expression
values at one leaf stage were artificially set to 1 separately for
both genotypes. Values are mean ± SD. Note that Ubiquitin
was amplified ~1 cycle earlier in SD genotype, but was stable
between different developmental stages. Therefore, expression values between genotypes cannot be directly compared,
while the expression levels between the various developmental stages are comparable.

Identification of flowering genes in strawberry
Genetic regulation of flowering in strawberry has earlier
been studied only by crossing experiments. According to
Weebadde et al. [61], everbearing character is a polygenic
trait in garden strawberry whereas other studies indicate
the presence of a single dominant gene [62]. Different
results may arise from different origin of everbearing
habit, since at least three different sources have been used
in strawberry breeding [32,61,62]. Studies in F. vesca
'Baron Solemacher'have shown that EB flowering habit in
this genotype is controlled by recessive alleles of a single
locus, called seasonal flowering locus (sfl) [40,41]. Identification of central genes regulating flowering, as well as
those controlling other processes that affect flowering
(runnering, chilling), is an important goal that would
greatly accelerate breeding of strawberry and other soft
fruit and fruit species of Rosaceae family.

For comprehensive identification of candidate genes of
the strawberry flowering pathways, we searched
homologs for 118 Arabidopsis flowering time genes from
our own cDNA libraries and from GDR. In total, we were
able to identify 66 gene homologs among about 53000
EST sequences. Moreover, gene homologs lacking from
Fragaria were further mined from Rosaceae EST collections containing about 410 000 EST sequences. These
searches revealed 22 additional putative flowering time
genes in Rosaceae. Ongoing genome sequencing projects
in apple, peach and wild strawberry will ultimately reveal
the currently lacking flowering regulators in these species
[63].
Sequences found in Fragaria corresponded to all known
Arabidopsis flowering time pathways [2] suggesting that all
of these genetic pathways may be present in Fragaria.
However, the sequence conservation does not necessarily
mean functional conservation, so major candidate genes
from different pathways have to be functionally characterized in order to prove the presence of these pathways in
strawberry. Few central regulators of flowering time are
lacking from Fragaria sequence collections and some of
them also from Rosaceae databases. For example, we were
not able to identify a homolog for the florigen gene FT
[11] in Fragaria regardless of several different attempts.
This is probably due to its low expression level and tissue
specific expression pattern [64]. Similarly, GI, which links
circadian clock and CO [8,65], was absent from the Fragaria sequences. FT and GI homologs were, however,
found in apple and Prunus, showing that they are present
in Rosaceae. Moreover, consistent with studies in model

Page 10 of 16

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:122

legumes [66], CCA1 was lacking in Rosaceae, but its
redundant paralog, LHY, is represented by few ESTs in Fragaria. CCA1 and LHY are MYB-type transcription factors
which repress the expression of TOC1 in the central loop
of Arabidopsis circadian clock [67]. Thus, in Fragaria and
other species of Rosaceae family, LHY alone may control
the expression of TOC1 in the clock core. This contrasts
with other species, like Populus, where duplications of the
LHY/CCA1 genes contribute to an apparently more complex mode of clock control [68].
Vernalization pathway in Arabidopsis culminates in FLC
and FLC-like floral repressors [13,50]. They have been
functionally characterized only in Brassicaceae [13,69],
although homologous MADS box genes have been
recently found from several eudicot lineages by phylogenetic analysis [51]. However, we were not able to identify
FLC-like sequences in Rosaceae by using several FLC-like
sequences as a query. Similarly, also FRI homologs were
lacking from the Rosaceae sequence collections. However,
putative homologs of FRI-like genes, FRL1 and FRL2,
which are involved in FLC activation in Arabidopsis [15]
were found, as well as several other homologs of genes
belonging to FLC regulating protein complexes. Despite
the presence of these transcripts, the presence of FLC is
unclear, since at least PRC2 complex has several target
genes [70]. Cloning and characterization of putative FLClike and FRI genes as well as FT in strawberry would
greatly expand our understanding of strawberry flowering
pathways, and therefore, it is one of the most important
targets of further studies. If these transcripts are present in
strawberry, it is likely that the precise control of flowering
has placed their expression in specific tissues or contexts
where they are not easily detected. However, their presence should be substantiated in analysis of the impending
genome sequence. Another important goal is the identification of putative Rosaceae or Fragaria specific flowering
time genes. Ultimately, transcriptomics studies and functional analysis of central genes may reveal how different
flowering pathways, which may be closely related to Arabidopsis pathways, make seasonal flowering in strawberry.
What is the SFL gene?
SFL is a single dominant locus that enforces seasonal
flowering habit in wild strawberry, and homozygous
mutation in this locus leads to continuous flowering habit
in at least one genotype, 'Baron Solemacher' [36]. In SD
genotypes of wild strawberry, SD or low temperature
induce flowering [27] probably by overcoming the function of SFL repressor gene. We showed here that EB genotypes 'Baron Solemacher' and 'Hawaii-4' produce only 5 6 leaves to the main crown before the formation of the terminal inflorescence in LD at 18°C. Hence, flowering
induction in these conditions occurs soon after germination. In SD (12 h) or at low temperature (11°C) instead,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/122

plants formed several leaves more before the inflorescence. This finding shows that, in contrast to SD genotypes, both SD and low temperature restrain flowering
induction in these genotypes, confirming earlier suggestions that EB genotypes of wild strawberry are in fact LD
plants [35]. Most simple explanation for these opposite
environmental responses is that the lack of flowering
inhibitor, produced by active SFL gene, unmasks LD
induced flowering promotion pathway in 'Baron
Solemacher' and possibly in other EB genotypes. Given
that both SD and low temperature repress SFL, analogous
flowering regulating pathway has not yet been characterized at molecular level.
Our gene expression analysis did not give any hints of the
putative location of SFL in wild strawberry flowering
pathways. However, homologs of certain flowering
repressors can be consireded as candidates for SFL, including the rice CO homolog HD1 (HEADING DATE 1), or
Arabidopsis vernalization pathway genes FLC and FRI
[13,14,71]. In strawberry, the role of vernalization pathway remains unclear until the presence or absence of FRI
or FLC function is confirmed or other targets for this pathway are found. Strawberry CO, instead, has been cloned
and mapped in Fragaria reference map, but its position
does not match with the genomic location of SFL showing
that CO itself is not SFL [44,72]. However, the possibility
that some regulator of CO transcription or protein stability could be SFL cannot be ruled out and should be studied further.
Exogenously applied GA inhibits flowering in wild strawberry, and therefore, GA has been suggested to be a floral
repressor [38,39]. Similar patterns have been observed
and delineate differences between recurrent and nonrecurrent roses [73]. However, we did not find clear differences in the expression of GA biosynthetic and catabolism
genes, GA3ox and GA2ox, in the shoot apex samples of EB
and SD genotypes before the floral initiation had
occurred. In contrast, GA3ox was strongly repressed in EB
apices after floral initiation and GA2ox showed similar
trend. The fact that these changes in GA pathway occurred
after two leaf stage suggests that GA signal was regulated
during early flower development rather than during floral
transition. These data does not support the role of endogenous GA as the regulator of flowering induction, indicating that SFL is not situated in the GA pathway. However,
quantitative analysis of GA levels is needed to show
whether the observed changes in the expression of GA
pathway genes are reflected at the metabolic level.
AP1 is a potential marker of floral initiation in strawberry
Gene expression analysis revealed that two putative flowering genes, AP1 and LFY, were co-regulated during floral
development in EB wild strawberry. The homolog of floral

identity gene AP1 was expressed in the EB apex already at
one leaf stage, and its expression was strongly enhanced
during later developmental stages. Also LFY mRNA accumulated along with AP1 during floral development in EB
genotype, whereas SOC1 did not show a clear trend. The
mRNA of SOC1 and LFY were present also in SD genotype, but AP1 transcription was not detected. In Arabidopsis, LFY and AP1 activate each other's expression
constituting a feedback loop [12,58]. Moreover, AP1 is
activated by FT-FD heterodimer shortly after flowering
induction [10]. Thus, the expression patterns of AP1and
LFY in the meristems of EB genotype suggest that flowering induction in these plants occurs before two leaf stage
in LD conditions. Consistent with this conclusion, flower
initials were clearly visible by stereomicroscope in the
meristems at three or four leaf stage, and plants flowered
after producing on average 4.7 leaves in the main crown.
Based on our results, AP1 can be used as a marker for floral initiation in wild strawberry. However, functional
studies are needed to confirm the role of AP1, LFY and
SOC1 as floral integrator and identity genes, and this
approach is currently going on.

Conclusion
We have explored putative components for the genetic
flowering pathways in perennial SD plant wild strawberry
by identifying 66 homologs of Arabidopsis flowering time
genes. Although few central genes are lacking, these data
indicate that all known genetic flowering pathways may
be present in Fragaria. This is consistent with the finding
that EB genotypes, 'Hawaii-4' and 'Baron Solemacher',
show similar environmental regulation of flowering than
Arabidopsis summer-annuals. We also studied the expression of selected candidate genes and found that few genes
were co-regulated in the shoot apex of the EB genotype
during early floral development. Most strikingly, the
mRNA of AP1 specifically accumulated in EB genotype,
but was absent in SD genotype, showing its usefulness as
a marker of floral initiation. Finally, identification of
putative flowering time genes reported here enables their
transcriptional and functional characterization, as well as
genetic mapping, which may give answers for the relative
importance of each genetic flowering pathway and lead to
cloning of the central repressor gene, SFL. Ultimately,
these genetic resources could be utilized in cultivar breeding of various species of Rosaceae family through genetic
transformation and marker assisted selection breeding.

Methods
Plant materials, growing conditions and sampling
Seeds of SD and EB ('Baron Solemacher') genotypes of the
wild strawberry (NCGR accession numbers [PI551792]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/122

and [PI551507], respectively) were sown on potting soil
mixture (Kekkilä, Tuusula, Finland) and grown in a greenhouse under LD conditions (day length min. 18 h), provided by 400 W SON-T lamps (Airam, Kerava, Finland)
and natural sunlight. After two to three leaves had developed per plant, shoot apex samples (tip of the shoot containing the meristem as well as two to three leaf initials)
were collected under a stereomicroscope at ten different
time points with three days intervals. Samples from each
time point were pooled and used for the construction of
cDNA libraries and real-time RT-PCR. WT samples contained shoot apices of the main crown, collected from 50
plants per time point. Also in EB genotype, shoot apices of
the main crown were collected until the sepal initials
became visible in the meristems. After this time point, the
apices from one to three side shoots per plant were collected, altogether from 40 plants per sampling. In addition, leaf samples were collected from the same plants at
four leaf stage for real-time RT-PCR analysis. Moreover,
separate shoot apex samples were collected from WT and
EB genotypes at one, two, three and four leaf stages. Control plants were grown in LD and their flowering time was
determined by counting the number of leaves in the main
crown before the terminal inflorescence. All samples were
collected in July - August 2006 - 2008.
Preparation and sequencing of subtracted cDNA libraries
Total RNA from pooled shoot apex samples was extracted
with a pine tree method for RNA isolation [74]. The cDNA
was synthesized with BD SMART cDNA Synthesis kit
(Clontech, Palo Alto, US), amplified with PCR as
instructed for subtraction, purified with Chroma Spin1000 DEPC-H2O Columns (Clontech), extracted with
chloroform:isoamylalcohol (24:1) using Phase Loch Gel
Heavy 1.5 ml tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany),
digested with RsaI (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim,
Germany), and purified with High Pure PCR Product
Purification kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, US).
The cDNAs were subtracted using BD PCR-Select cDNA
Subtraction Kit (Clontech) in both forward and reverse
directions. The forward and reverse PCR mixtures were
digested with RsaI (Boehringer Mannheim) and purified
with High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche).
After digestion, A-tailing was done as instructed in the
technical manual of pGEM-T and pGEM-T Easy Vector
Systems and PCR mixtures were ligated to pGEM-T Easy
Vector (Promega, Wisconsis, US), and electroporated to
TOP10 cells. The libraries were sequenced at the Institute
of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, as described earlier [75].

Bioinformatics analysis
Raw EST sequences were quality checked before annotation. Base calling, end clipping and vector removal were
performed by CodonCodeAligner-software (CodonCode
Corporation, US). After this the ESTs were manually
checked and sequences that contained poly-T in the
beginning followed by short repetitive sequences were
removed. BLASTx was performed against functionally
annotated Arabidopsis protein database (v211200, MIPS),
Swissprot and non-redundant protein database (NCBI),
and Populus trichocarpa genome of DOE Joint Genome
Institute [76] using cut-off value 1e-10. tBLASTx was performed against TIGR plant transcript assemblies of Malus
x domestica, Oryza sativa and Vitis vinifera [77], and GDR
Fragaria and Rosaceae Contigs using cut-off value 1e-10.
For MIPS BLAST hits corresponding functional classes and
Gene Ontology classes were obtained from Functional
Classification Catalogue (Version 2.1) and GO annotation for Arabidopsis thaliana (Version 1.1213).

(18 h), and flowering time was determined as described
above.
Gene expression analysis
Total RNA from leaf and shoot apex samples was extracted
with a pine tree method [74], and cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA using Superscript III RT kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, US) and dT18VN anchor primers.
LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, US) was used to perform 15 μl real-time
RT-PCR reactions in 384-well plates according to manufacturer's instructions by using Light Cycler 480 real-time
PCR system (Roche Diagnostics). PCR primers with Tm
value of 60°C were used (Table 5). Three biological replicates were analysed for shoot apex samples from different
developmental stages (Figure 4), and two biological replicates were used for pooled shoot apex and leaf samples
(Table 6).

Authors' contributions
Homologs of Arabidopsis flowering time genes were
searched from GDR Fragaria contig and EST databases
using tBLASTx algorithm and Arabidopsis protein
sequences as a query. Homologous sequences passing a
cut-off value 1e-10 were further analysed by BLASTx algorithm against Arabidopsis protein database, and sequences
showing highest sequence homology with the corresponding Arabidopsis genes were selected. The sequences
lacking from Fragaria were similarly searched from GDR
Rosaceae EST database and from Rosaceae protein database at NCBI.

TH, KM and PE designed all experiments. PE coordinated
the study and helped to draft the manuscript. TH run the
real-time PCR analysis, performed flowering gene
searches from sequence databases, and drafted the manuscript together with KM. KM constructed the subtracted
cDNA libraries and performed bioinformatics analysis
together with KF. KF also helped to draft the manuscript.
MR participated in flowering time analysis and sampling
of shoot apices. PA and LP were responsible for the EST
sequencing. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Photoperiod and temperature treatments
For the analysis of environmental regulation of flowering
in EB genotypes, seeds of 'Baron Solemacher', and
'Hawaii-4' were germinated in 18 h LD at 18°C. During
germination, plants were illuminated using 400 W SON-T
lamps (Airam) for 12 h daily (90 ± 10 μmol m-2 s-1 at plant
height plus natural light) and incandescent lamps were
used for low-intensity daylength extension (5 ± 1 μmol m2 s-1 at plant height). After opening of the cotyledons
plants were moved to four treatments, SD and LD (12/18
h) at low or high temperature (11/18°C), for five weeks.
In LD, incandescent lamps were used for low-intensity
daylength extension (5 ± 1 μmol m-2 s-1 at plant height)
after 12 h main light period. Also photoperiods of 8 and
8 + 8 h (SD/LD) were tested, but because of very slow
growth in these light treatments, longer photoperiods
were selected (data not shown). SD treatments were carried out at the greenhouse using darkening curtains, while
LD treatments (photoperiod 18 h) were conducted in a
similar greenhouse compartment without curtains. The
experiments were carried out during winter 2007 - 2008,
when the natural day length was under 12 h. After treatments, plants were potted to 8 x 8 cm pots, moved to LD
