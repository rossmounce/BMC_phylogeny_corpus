Abstract
Background: Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase displaying
vital functions in growth and development through its role in various signalling pathways. PP2A
holoenzymes comprise a core dimer composed of a catalytic C and a structural A subunit, which
can associate with a variable B-type subunit. The importance of the B-type subunits for PP2A
regulation cannot be overestimated as they determine holoenzyme localisation, activity and
substrate specificity. Three B-type subunit families have been identified: PR55/B, PR61/B' and PR72/
B", of which the latter is currently the least characterised.
Results: We deduced the sequences and genomic organisation of the different murine PR72/B"
isoforms: three genes encode nine isoforms, five of which are abundantly expressed and give rise
to genuine PP2A subunits. Thereby, one novel subunit was identified. Using Northern blotting, we
examined the tissue-specific and developmental expression of these subunits. All subunits are highly
expressed in heart, suggesting an important cardiac function. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed a striated expression pattern of PR72 and PR130 in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in
bladder smooth muscle. The subcellular localisation and cell cycle regulatory ability of several PR72/
B" isoforms were determined, demonstrating differences as well as similarities.
Conclusion: In contrast to PR55/B and PR61/B', the PR72/B" family seems evolutionary more
divergent, as only two of the murine genes have a human orthologue. We have integrated these
results in a more consistent nomenclature of both human and murine PR72/B" genes and their
transcripts/proteins. Our results provide a platform for the future generation of PR72/B" knockout
mice.

Background
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), one of the major serine/
threonine protein phosphatases in the cell, is involved in
the control of a large number of cellular events including

cell growth, intracellular signalling, DNA replication,
transcription, translation, cell differentiation and cell
transformation [1,2]. The key to understand how PP2A is
capable of regulating such diverse, and sometimes even

opposite functions, is its structure. The core of PP2A consists of a structural PR65/A subunit and a catalytic C subunit, both existing in two isoforms, α and β. To this PP2A
dimer (PP2AD), a third regulatory B-type subunit can
bind. It is generally believed that the regulatory B-type
subunits target the phosphatase to distinct substrates and
intracellular localisations. At present approximately 20
regulatory B-type subunits have been described. Based on
their primary structure, they can be divided into three
families: PR55/B, PR61/B' (also called B56) and PR72/B"
[1]. They share two conserved A subunit binding domains
(ASBD) [3]. In theory, about 80 different combinations of
trimeric ABC holoenzymes can be formed. How many
actually exist in the cell, is unknown and most probably
differs in different tissues due to the tissue-specific expression of some PP2A subunits [1]. Furthermore, phosphorylation and methylation of the catalytic C subunit play an
important role in the assembly of specific trimeric holoenzymes [4,5].
In the present study, we focus on the regulatory PR72/B"
subunit family named after the molecular weight of the
first identified member [6]. In mammals, sofar 6 members
have been described: PR72 [6], PR130 [6], PR70 [7],
PPP2R3L product [8], G5PR [9] and mPR59 [10], all sharing a conserved region with two ASBDs important for
binding to PP2AD. Characteristically for this family, are –
in addition to both ASBDs – two Ca2+-binding EF-hand
motifs [11]. Mutation analysis of these EF-hand motifs
together with several binding and activity studies indicate
that Ca2+ can influence the heterotrimeric assembly and
catalytic activity of the B"-containing PP2A [11-14].
PR72 and PR130, the founding members of the B" family,
are two N-terminal splice variants with a different tissue
distribution pattern. PR72 is highly abundant in heart and
skeletal muscle and barely detectable in other tissues.
PR130, on the other hand, has a more widespread distribution [6]. Both splice variants have a role in Wnt signalling since they both regulate Naked Cuticle (Nkd)
function, yet apparently in opposite ways [15,16]. Furthermore, addition of IQ-1, a compound which disrupts
binding of PR72 and PR130 to both PP2AD and Nkd,
results in prevention of embryonic stem cell differentiation due to a change of co-activators associating with βcatenin [17]. In addition, PR72-containing PP2A
(PP2AT72) is also responsible for the glutamate-dependent
dephosphorylation of Thr75 in dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) in
dopaminoceptive neuronal cells of the striatum [12].
PR130-containing PP2A (PP2AT130) has been described as
an interacting protein of CG-NAP (centrosome and Golgi
localised PKN-associated protein), a scaffolding protein
that assembles several protein kinases (PKA, PKN) and
protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2AT130) on centrosome and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/393

Golgi apparatus [18]. PP2AT130 is also suggested to be
involved in the calcium release from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum of heart cells as it can interact with the ryanodine receptor type 2, a heart-specific Ca2+ channel found to
be hyperphosphorylated in some patients with heart failure [19]. In Xenopus laevis, an additional splice variant,
named XN73, has been found. This protein contains the
specific N-terminus of PR130 followed by a short tail of 7
amino acids and thus lacks the ASBD necessary for PP2ADbinding. Consequently, this protein is not a regulatory
PR72/B" subunit strictu senso [7] but-based on its
sequence-might compete in binding to other cellular partners of PR130.
After identification of PR48 as a B" subunit family member which can bind Cdc6 [20] and therefore involved in
regulation of the cell cycle, it was found that PR48 represents a partial clone of a larger human B" subunit, PR70
[7]. Currently, two PR48-containing isoforms have been
described with different N-termini: PR70 and PPP2R3L
product. PPP2R3L product is mainly expressed in heart
and skeletal muscle [8], whereas PR70 is ubiquitously
expressed [7]. Recently, various links between PR70 and
cell cycle progression have been discovered. PR70 can
bind retinoblastoma protein (pRb), thereby regulating its
phosphorylation status following oxidative stress [13]
and it can associate with Cdc6 [14].
Another member of the B" subunit family is named G5PR.
It has a wide expression pattern and can bind both PP2AD
and PP5 [9]. Furthermore, G5PR can interact with GANP,
a DNA-primase which is selectively up-regulated in germinal centre B cells after immunisation with T cell-dependent antigens [9]. B-cell-specific G5PR knockout mice
display a decreased number of splenic B cells. This
enhanced cell death, specifically induced upon antigen
binding to the specific B cell receptor, is caused by an
increased activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase
and Bim [21]. In parallel, T-cell-specific G5PR knockout
mice display a decreased number of thymocytes. The
enhanced cell death, mainly seen in CD4 and CD8 double
positive thymocytes, is accompanied by increased activation of both c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase and caspase-3, but not Bim [22].
mPR59 is a mouse-specific B" subunit, discovered as an
interacting protein of p107, a Rb related protein [10]. No
human orthologue of mPR59 is found so far. It is
expressed in various tissues and overexpression can regulate p107 phosphorylation, causing an increase of cells in
the G1 phase of the cell cycle [10]. Furthermore, mPR59
co-purifies with the L-Type Calcium Channel Cav1.2, a
voltage-gated Ca2+ channel important for Ca2+ influx in
cells of the cardiovascular system, heart and brain [23].

Undoubtedly, the generation of (additional) PR72/B"
knockout mice will be a valuable tool to obtain further
insights into the potential physiological roles of the PR72/
B" regulatory subunits. To provide a framework for the
generation and analysis of such PR72/B" knockout mice,
we present a comprehensive overview of the murine
PR72/B"-encoding genes, their exon/intron organisation,
their (alternative) transcripts and their developmental
and tissue-specific expression. Surprisingly and in contrast
to the murine PR55/B [24] and PR61/B' [25] families of
PP2A subunits, the murine PR72/B" subunits have
evolved somewhat differently compared to their human
orthologues. As a consequence the current PR72/B"
nomenclature is confusing, and we now propose some
changes to make it more consistent. At the cellular level,
we determine the subcellular localisation of the major
PR72/B" subunits and their ability to affect cell cycle progression upon overexpression. Evidence is presented for at
least one novel murine PR72/B" isoform, adding to the
high diversity of PP2A B-type subunits.

Results
The murine B" family isoforms
In mammals, four genes of the B" regulatory subunit family of PP2A have been described, giving rise to six isoforms: PR72 [6], PR130 [6], PR70 [7], PPP2R3L product
[8], G5PR [9] and mPR59, an isoform sofar only found in
mice [10].

Upon searching the NCBI database for murine B" family
members via the BLAST algorithm, we retrieved the complete protein sequence of two murine PR72 isoforms: the
human PR72 orthologue [GenBank:BAE21013] (referred
to as mPR72/B"α2) and a shorter variant missing the last
41 residues [GenBank:BAC28935] (referred to as mPR72/
B"α4). In addition, one mG5PR isoform [GenBank:NP_067504] (referred to as mG5PR/B"γ) and four
mPR59 isoforms were retrieved: mPR59 as described by
Voorhoeve et al. [GenBank:AAC98973] (referred to as
mPR59/B"δ2) [10], two mPR59 variants containing different N-termini [GenBank:AAH59852 and BAE25309]
(referred to as mPR59/B"δ1 and mPR59/B"δ3 respectively) and a mPR59/B"δ3 variant harbouring an alternative C-terminus [GenBank:AAH96544] (referred to as
mPR59/B"δ4). Additionally, two partial protein
sequences of murine PR130 homologues were retrieved,
one containing the first 615 amino acids of the PR130
specific N-terminus [GenBank:BAC31413] and the other
containing the last 203 amino acids of the specific N-terminus followed by 12 additional residues [GenBank:BAC37349], resembling Xenopus XN73 (referred to
as mPR130/B"α3). Of the full-length mPR130 (referred to
as mPR130/B"α1), only a predicted sequence [GenBank:XP_135153] could be found.

To confirm these in silico data and to get an idea about the
abundancy of these clones, we scanned the NCBI database
for murine EST-clones containing the B"-specific N- or Ctermini. Only very few EST-clones were found carrying the
sequence of the mPR72 C-terminus lacking 41 residues
[GenBank:BE852268 and CA984544], the XN73-like
truncated mPR130 C-terminus [GenBank:AV356684] and
the alternative mPR59 C-terminus [GenBank:BB357167],
making it rather unlikely that murine B" family members
containing these termini (mPR130/B"α3, mPR72/B"α4
and mPR59/B"δ4) do abundantly exist. In contrast, five
EST-clones of the specific N-terminus of mPR59/B"δ3 and
multiple (> 15) EST-clones of the other B"-specific N- and
C-termini were found, suggesting that mPR72/B"α2,
mPR130/B"α1, mG5PR/B"γ, mPR59/B"δ1, PR59/B"δ2,
and PR59/B"δ3 are much more abundant, and probably
represent the main murine B" isoforms.
Since mPR59/B"δ1 and mPR59/B"δ3 are putatively novel,
and to further confirm their existence, we performed a
reverse transcription on NIH 3T3 and murine heart RNA
using primer E3 annealing in the mPR59 3' UTR. With the
resulting cDNAs as templates and the use of five different
primers, annealing with the specific N-termini of PR59/
B"δ1–4 (Bδ1, Bδ2, Bδ3/4) and/or the specific C-termini of
PR59/B"δ1–3 (E2) and PR59/B"δ4 (E1), we were able to
generate several DNA fragments, which after sequencing,
were shown to correspond to PR59/B"δ1, PR59/B"δ2 and
PR59/B"δ3. In vitro transcription-translation reactions of
these cDNAs revealed proteins of about 60 kDa (PR59/
B"δ1), 55 kDa (PR59/B"δ2) and 40 kDa (PR59/B"δ3)
(Figure 1A), implying that not only the messengers of
PR59/B"δ1,δ2,δ3 are present in murine cells, but that they
can also be translated into proteins. A cDNA for mPR59/
B"δ4 could not be amplified using this approach, confirming its low occurrence in the EST database.
A similar approach was undertaken to confirm the existence of the four mPR130/PR72 isoforms. In this case RTPCR of NIH 3T3 or murine heart RNA led to the amplification of mPR130/B"α1 and mPR72/B"α2 cDNA, but not
of mPR130/B"α3 or mPR72/"α4. To confirm this at the
protein level, we prepared protein extracts of murine
embryonic fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells and several murine
adult tissues: heart, in which both human PR130 as PR72
are highly expressed [6]; adrenal gland, the tissue from
which
the
mPR130/B"α3
EST-clone
[GenBank:AV356684] was isolated, and brain. Three antibodies were used to perform immunoprecipitations of the
different mPR130/PR72 isoforms: a PR72 AB, raised
against full-length recombinant human PR72 [11]; a
PR130N AB, raised against the recombinant specific N-terminus of human PR130 (AA 1–664) and a peptide PR72
AB, raised against the first 19 amino acids of the human
PR72-specific N-terminus. The results demonstrate immu-

noreactivity at 140 kDa and 70 kDa, corresponding to
mPR130/B"α1 and mPR72/B"α2 (Figure 1B). No other
specific bands could be observed, even upon prolonged
exposure, confirming our in silico and RT-PCR analysis.
Consequently, it can be concluded that should the
mPR130/B"α3 and/or mPR72/B"α4 isoforms exist, their
expression would be very low or highly restricted in time
and/or space.
Together, six main B" family members are present in mice:
mPR130/B"α1, mPR72/B"α2, mG5PR/B"γ, mPR59/B"δ1,
mPR59/B"δ2 and mPR59/B"δ3, with mPR59/B"δ1 and δ3
being novel ones. A protein alignment of these murine B"
isoforms (Figure 2) reveals that they all share a conserved
region, harbouring both ASBD and both EF-hand motifs,
with the exception of mPR59/B"δ3 which misses 31
amino acids of the first ASBD. They mainly differ within
their N- and/or C-termini, which may be responsible for
isoform-specific functions. Surprisingly, no evidence of
murine PR70 and PPP2R3L product orthologues could be
found. The murine proteins most closely resembling these
isoforms are PR59/B"δ1 (58% identity, 66% similarity
with hPR70) and PR59/B"δ2 (57% identity; 66% similarity with the PPP2R3L product).
Genomic organisation of the three murine B" genes
An alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the murine
PR72/B" isoforms suggests that all novel isoforms are the
result of alternative splicing of the genes encoding previously described members. By BLASTN analysis of the
murine genome using the murine cDNA sequences, we
could solve the genomic organisation of these three

murine B" genes (Figure 3). The intron-exon boundaries
were deduced by comparing the sequences obtained from
the genomic clones and the respective cDNAs. Almost all
boundaries were found to follow Chambon's rule (GTAG) for splice donor and acceptor sites [26] (Table 1).
The genomic organisation of the gene giving rise to the
murine PR130 and PR72 isoforms (3222402P14Rik, MGI:
2442104) was deduced from clone RP24-308L17 [GenBank:AC120390], containing the entire gene. To retain
the logic in the PR72/B" gene nomenclature, we propose
to rename this gene into Ppp2r3a, analogous to the human
PPP2R3A gene. The mPR130/PR72 gene is located on
chromosome 9F1 (101 Mb). This region corresponds to
human chromosome 3q22, where PPP2R3A is located.
The mPR130/PR72 gene (Figure 3) spans approximately
106 kb and consists of 15 exons. In addition to the exons
giving rise to mPR130/B"α1 and mPR72/B"α2, we could
also locate both the exon containing the sequence of the
12 specific C-terminal amino acids of mPR130/B"α3
(exon 2), and the exon responsible for the premature ending of PR72/B"α4 (exon 14B) at the correct sites within
the gene. Since PR72/B"α2 is the result of an intra-exonic
splicing event within exon 14, PR72/B"α4 might well be
the result of a splicing error at this position, possibly
explaining its low abundance. In the human PR130/PR72
gene (PPP2R3A), the exon responsible for the putative
generation of a human PR72/B"α4 isoform is also
present. The NCBI human EST database contains exactly
one EST [GenBank:CA427549] containing this exon. In
contrast, no sign of the specific C-terminal tail of either
mPR130/B"α3 or XN73 could be found in PPP2R3A. In

The mPR59/B"δ3 protein is not a genuine PP2Aregulatory
subunit
With the exception of XN73 and mPR130/B"α3, all B"
family members contain a conserved region and specific
N- and C-termini. The conserved region, which contains
two ASBDs and two EF-hand motifs, is necessary for
PR65/A binding [3]. Since the first ASBD is not intact in
mPR59/B"δ3 (Figure 2), we wondered whether this isoform is still able to bind PP2A. To this end, we made GSTfusion proteins of the main B" family members and overexpressed these in COS-7 cells. After a GST-pull down
assay, we evaluated the binding of both the PR65/A and
catalytic subunit of PP2A via Western blotting. As
expected, all main B" isoforms (hPR130, hPR72, hPR70,
mG5PR/B"γ, mPR59/B"δ1 and mPR59/B"δ2) bind PP2A
(Figure 5), and are therefore genuine B" subunits. In contrast, mPR59/B"δ3 fails to bind PP2A, suggesting it is not
a regulatory subunit of PP2A (Figure 5). Like XN73 and
mPR130/B"α3, it might be involved in regulation of PP2A
by competing with the other mPR59 isoforms for binding
to other binding partners.

Analysis of the mG5PR genomic structure is based on
NCBI contig NW_001030500, which is located on chromosome 12C2 (56 Mb, ENSEMBLE ContigView) and contains the entire gene (Ppp2r3c, MGI: 193009). The mG5PR
gene (Figure 3) contains 13 exons and closely mimics the
genomic organisation of the human gene [9].

but as one could easily mistake it for the murine orthologue of PPP2R3A, we propose to change its name into
Ppp2r3d (see also further). This gene spans approximately
9 kb and consists of 13 exons. The exons encoding the
complete sequences of all mPR59 isoforms were found at
the appropriate locations (Figure 3). To find the human
Ppp2r3d homologue, we scanned the human genome
using the BLASTN program with the different mPR59 isoforms as input. The closest match was the human PR70/
PPP2R3L product gene (PPP2R3B/L), followed by the
human PR130/PR72 gene (PPP2R3A), confirming the
similarity between PR70/PPP2R3L and mPR59 at the
genomic level. Therefore, the murine Ppp2r3d and the
human PPP2R3B/L gene may have evolved from a common ancestor gene. This hypothesis looks promising since
to our knowledge no organism contains both a PR70/
PPP2R3L product and a PR59-encoding gene. A phylogenetic tree, based on the protein sequences of various
PR72/B" family members in man and mouse, further supports this hypothesis (Figure 4).

Tissue distribution of mPR130/B"α1, mPR72/B"α2,
mPR59/B"δ1 and mPR59/B"δ2
We determined the mRNA expression of the genuine
murine B" regulatory subunits via Northern blot analysis
(Figure 6). Using an antisense probe which hybridises to
the first 330 nucleotides of mPR130, transcripts of 4.3 kb
and 7.0 kb were detected. These transcripts are probably
generated by the use of different polyadenylation sites.
However, we can not exclude the possibility that the 4.3
kb transcript represents mPR130/B"α3. Both mPR130
transcripts have a similar expression pattern, being high in
kidney and heart, intermediate in skeletal muscle, brain,
liver and testis and low in lung and spleen. These findings
are consistent with the previously published ubiquitous
expression of human PR130 [6].

A probe specific for the N-terminal sequence of the
mPR72 isoforms, detected a single band at 4.4 kb, likely
corresponding to mPR72/B"α2. Similar to the expression
pattern of PR72 in humans [6], mPR72/B"α2 is abundant
in heart and skeletal muscle and barely detectable in other
tissues (Figure 6).
As for mPR130/B"α1 and mPR72/B"α2, the transcripts of
mPR59/B"δ1 and mPR59/B"δ2 were visualised using
probes hybridising with their specific N-termini. The
expression profiles obtained reveal a wide tissue distribution with some minor differences between the two splice
variants: mPR59/B"δ1 expression is high in heart and
liver, intermediate in kidney, brain and skeletal muscle
and rather low in testis, lung and spleen, while mPR59/
B"δ2 is highly abundant in heart, liver, brain, kidney and
testis and less abundant in lung, skeletal muscle and
spleen.
These results, together with the earlier observed broad
mG5PR expression pattern [9] indicate a general high
expression of all murine PP2A B" subunits in heart.
Embryonic expression of the murine B" regulatory subunits
In order to generate viable knockout mice, it can be
important to establish whether a function of the protein
of interest can be expected during embryonic development, as a general knockout of such a gene might lead to
an embryonic lethal phenotype. Expression of the
mPR130/B"α1, mPR72/B"α2, mPR59/B"δ1, mPR59/
B"δ2 and mG5PR/B"γ subunits was examined via Northern blotting at embryonic days 7, 11, 15 and 17 (Figure 7).
Hybridisation was performed using the same specific
probes as for the tissue distribution determination. For
mG5PR/B"γ, a probe spanning the first 450 nucleotides of
mG5PR/B"γ was used. No additional splice variants, specific for embryonic stages, were observed for any of the
main murine B" subunits. Expression of both mPR130/
B"α1 and mPR72/B"α2 transcripts increases as embryonic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/393

development proceeds. This might suggest a role for these
proteins in fetal growth and development. In previous
studies, both hPR130 as well as hPR72 have been reported
to influence Wnt signalling [15-17]. In contrast, the
expression of mPR59/B"δ1, mPR59/B"δ2 and mG5PR/
B"γ remains constant during all stages of embryonic development (Figure 7).
Immunohistochemical analysis of mPR130/B"α1 and
mPR72/B"α2 in different muscle tissues
All B" isoforms are highly expressed in heart. Moreover,
mPR72/B"α2 expression is nearly restricted to muscle tissue. mPR130/B"α1, which has a broader expression pattern, is also substantially present in the different muscle
tissues represented on the Northern blot. Since we have
specific antibodies for both isoforms (Figure 1B), we
examined the distribution of mPR130/B"α1 and mPR72/
B"α2 in the different types of muscle tissue (heart, skeletal
and smooth muscle) in more detail via immunohistochemistry.

In longitudinal sections of skeletal muscle, mPR130/B"α1
and mPR72/B"α2 both intensively stain the muscle fibers
in a striated pattern (Figure 8A, e–f). To evaluate whether
these bands represent the I- or A-bands, we counterstained
the sections with iron hematoxylin. This dye gives the Aband a dark blue colour and colocalises with mPR130/
B"α1 and mPR72/B"α2 (Figure 8B, f–g). In one of the
muscle fibers stained with mPR130/B"α1 AB, we could
even observe a darker stained band positioned in the centre of the A-band (Figure 8B, d). This band probably represents the H-zone. In sections of murine myocardium, a
similar striated staining pattern could be observed in the
longitudinally positioned muscle fibers. Cross-sectional
muscle fibers did not show staining of any specific structures (Figure 8A, h–i). In bladder, neither mPR130/B"α1
AB nor mPR72/B"α2 AB stained the smooth muscle fibers
of the muscular layer. In contrast, mPR130/B"α1 staining
could be seen in the transitional epithelial layer, lining the
inner cavity of the bladder (Figure 8A, b–c). In none of the
cases, specific staining of any structures was observed
using pre-immune serum (Figure 8A, a,d,g).
In conclusion, PR130/B"α1 and PR72/B"α2 staining
seems to be a specific feature of the A-band striations of
heart and skeletal muscle, whereas staining is very low or
absent in smooth muscle.
Subcellular localisation of the murine B" subunits
Using GFP-fusion proteins, we determined the subcellular
localisation of the hPR72, mPR59/B"δ1, mPR59/B"δ2,
mG5PR/B"γ and hPR70 subunits in COS7 cells. Since the
PR130 AB is suitable for direct immunofluorescence, we
also evaluated the subcellular localisation of endogenous
PR130 (Figure 9). As previously described [11], hPR72 is

All B" subunits tested provoke a G1 arrest upon
overexpression
Several B" family members have been suggested to influence cell cycle progression [9-11,13,14,20]. Therefore we
analysed the cell cycle profile of HeLa cells upon overexpression of several EGFP-B" fusion-proteins via FACS
analysis. Compared to control cells (EGFP), overexpression of all EGFP-B" fusion proteins tested (hPR72,
hPR130, hPR70, mG5PR/B"γ, mPR59/B"δ1 and mPR59/
B"δ2) caused an increase in the G1 population of transfected cells (Figure 10A). This was even more pronounced
in the presence of nocodazole, which arrests cycling cells
in G2/M (Figure 10B). These results confirm and extend
previously published effects of hPR72 [11] and mPR59/
B"δ2 [10] overexpression on cell cycle progression.

Northern Blot containing poly(A+) RNAs from murine
embryos at days 7, 11, 15 and 17 (Clontech) was hybridised
with isoform-specific RNA probes. Embryonic expression of
mPR130/B"α1, mPR72/B"α2, mPR59/B"δ1, mPR59/B"δ2 and
mG5PR/B"γ is shown. For quantification we used the ImageQuant program from Molecular Dynamics. Percentages of
expression are relative to the most intense band of the
murine tissues blot (Figure 6). This way, a comparison with
the relative expression of a specific isoform in the different
tissues (Figure 6) can be made. The β-actin control hybridisation is shown at the bottom and was used to correct for
equal loading.

mainly present in the nucleus (N >> CP). PR130 is present
in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (N > CP). mPR59/
B"δ1 (CP = N) and mPR59/B"δ2 (CP > N) appear both in
cytoplasm and nucleus but are clearly less abundant in the
nucleus than hPR72 and PR130. mG5PR/B"γ is more
abundant in the nucleus than the cytoplasm (N > CP),
corresponding to earlier published data [9], and additionally is highly abundant in the cell periphery. Surprisingly,
unlike PR48 [20], hPR70 has a more pronounced cytoplasmic expression (CP >> N). This diversity in observed
subcellular localisation patterns demonstrates that each
B" subunit may direct the phosphatase to distinct sites
and substrates within the cell.

The importance of the B-type subunits for PP2A regulation can hardly be overestimated as they restrict PP2A
activity spatially and temporarily within living organisms,
thereby determining PP2A substrate selectivity and function. Although the B-type subunits can be classified into
three distinct gene families (PR55/B, PR61/B' and PR72/
B"), their still increasing number, the sometimes confusing nomenclature and species-specific differences add to
the complexity, especially for the non-specialist. In particular, for the PR72/B" subunit family the current situation
may be confusing. With the aim to make this more clear
and at the same time to provide a platform for the generation of B" knockout mice, we have presented here a comprehensive overview of the murine B" family members-in
analogy to previous reports of the murine B' [25] and B
[24] families.
In addition to the previously described murine-specific
PR59 subunit [10] and the murine orthologues of PR130,
PR72 and G5PR, we have identified two novel splice variants of mPR59 as members of the murine B" family. Based
on the genomic organisation of the Ppp2r3d gene, we
named the original isoform PR59/B"δ2 and the novel isoforms PR59/B"δ1 and PR59/B"δ3. In contrast to PR59/
B"δ1 and δ2, no in vivo interaction of PR59/B"δ3 with
PP2A could be observed. Consequently, PR59/B"δ3 can
not be considered as a regulatory subunit of PP2A. In
addition, other potential murine B" family members
(mPR130/B"α3, mPR72/B"α4 and mPR59/B"δ4) were
found to be present in the NCBI EST database. Although
genomic evidence for these isoforms could be found, our
attempts to confirm their existence at either the mRNA or
protein level failed. This suggests that these isoforms are
poorly expressed or might result from splicing errors. Nevertheless, we can not exclude the possibility that their
expression is missed because of a tight regulation or
restriction in space and/or time. Moreover, the existence
of two B" isoforms (PR130/B"α3 and PR59/B"δ3) which

do not interact with the PP2A core dimer, gives further
support to the idea that B" subunits can exist- and be stable-independently of PP2A and that their function might
extend beyond regulation of phosphatase activity as such
(see [4] for a discussion). Even if so far only minute
amounts of these atypical unexpected messages could be
detected, specific conditions might lead to an upregulation and possible functional consequences.
To our surprise, no murine orthologues of human PR70
or PPP2R3L product could be found. These gene products
arise from the PPP2R3B/L gene, and according to the
genomic organisation of PPP2R3B/L, we propose to
rename these two N-terminal splice variants PR70/B"β1
and PR70/B"β2 respectively (Table 2). Several arguments
suggest that the murine Ppp2r3d gene (PR59) originates
from a common ancestor of the human PPP2R3B/L gene
(PR70), the Canis familiaris PPP2R3B gene (PR70) and the
Xenopus laevis LOC398610 gene (PR70): (1) none of these
organisms contain both the genes responsible for the
expression of PR59 and PR70 isoforms; (2) these genes
share the highest degree of homology amongst the B"
members, both on the protein as well as on the genomic
level; (3) from both genes, two B" regulatory subunits
arise by using alternative first exons; and (4) human
PR70/B"β1 can interact with and regulate the phosphorylation status of pRb while murine PR59/B"δ2 can associate with and regulate the phosphorylation status of p107,
another member of the retinoblastoma family [10].
Therefore, they may share some functional similarities.
Despite these similarities, we do not consider PR59 as the
murine orthologue of PR70. This is based on (1) the
rather low sequence homology between the specific N-terminal regions of the different PR59 and PR70 isoforms
and (2) the ubiquitous expression of both PR59 regulatory subunits in contrast to the skeletal muscle and heartspecific expression of hPR70/B"β2[8]. For these reasons,
we suggested to rename the PR59-encoding gene Ppp2r3d,
instead of Ppp2r3b. Because of the diversity between mice
and humans, it can be concluded that in contrast with the
PP2A PR55/B and PR61/B' families, the PR72/B" family
represents a less evolutionary conserved group of proteins. However, this does not mean that this family is not
represented in lower species. PR72/B" members are also
found in Xenopus laevis [7], Drosophila melanogaster [GenCaenorhabditis
elegans
[GenBank:NM_142585],
Bank:XM_001667031], various plants (Arabidopsis
thaliana [GenBank:AF290025], Oryza sativa [GenBank:AC078829]), and some unicellular organisms (Tetrahymena
thermophila
[GenBank:XP_001015505],
Paramecium tetraurelia [GenBank:XP_001347004]), but
are manifestly absent in yeast.
Unlike the PR55/B and PR61/B' family, the nomenclature
of both the genes and proteins of the PR72/B" family

bold: main PR72/B" regulatory subunits
*: protein of which first a partial clone, PR48, was discovered

members became very confusing. As mentioned earlier,
we propose to change the murine PR72/B" gene names in
such a way that the relationship with their human counterparts becomes clearer (Table 2). As for the PR72/B" proteins, until now, most of them have been named
according to their molecular weight (with G5PR as an
exception to this rule). In this report, we would like to
propose a nomenclature which is in accordance with the
corresponding gene name and the organisation of that
gene, and is consistent with the nomenclature of the proteins of the PR55/B and PR61/B' families. For historical
reasons we prefer to keep the original and commonly
known PR130, PR72, PR70, PR59 and G5PR protein
names combined with the B" indication and an additional specification (Greek letter) to denote the specific
isoform. As such, B" proteins encoded by the PPP2R3A
gene (PR130 and PR72) will get the 'α' extension, followed by a number to designate the specific splice variant;
B" proteins encoded by the PPP2R3B gene (PR70) get the
'β' extension etc. For the comfort of the authors and readers, once in a manuscript the subunit is clearly defined,
the short names B"α1, B"γ1 etc. can be used. In Table 2, a
summary of the (old and new) murine and human B"
nomenclature is given. If one intents to indicate the whole
family, one can use PR72/B" as a common denominator
since this makes an unequivocal distinction with the other
B-type third subunits: PR55/B and PR61/B'.
We have also investigated the tissue distribution and
developmental expression of all murine PP2A PR72/B"
subunits on the RNA level. Taking together previously
published data [6-8] and our northern blot analyses, it can

be concluded that mPR130/B"α1, hPR130/B"α1, mPR59/
B"δ1, mPR59/B"δ2, mG5PR/B"γ and XPR70/B"β1 are
ubiquitously expressed, indicating that these subunits are
involved in general cellular processes. In contrast,
mPR72/B"α2, hPR72/B"α2, and hPR70/B"β2 are highly
expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and barely detectable in other tissues, suggesting a specific role for these subunits in striated muscle tissues. In fact, all B" subunits
seem to be highly expressed in heart, an observation
which is given the presence of two EF-hands in their primary structures and their regulation by Ca2+ ions, of particular interest.
Immunohistochemical analysis of longitudinal fibers of
murine heart and skeletal muscle showed a striated pattern for mPR130/B"α1 and mPR72/B"α2. Counterstaining with iron hematoxylin revealed that they both
colocalise with the A-band. In contrast to the I-band, the
A-band does not only contain thin, actin-rich filaments
but also thick, myosine-rich filaments. mPR130/B"α1 and
mPR72/B"α2 staining is virtually absent in the smooth
muscle of the bladder, suggesting that these subunits may
play a specific role in striated muscle contraction only.
Although mPR130/B"α1 and mPR72/B"α2 stain the
nuclei in longitudinal as well as cross sections of heart and
skeletal muscle, their nuclear localisation in these tissues
is less pronounced compared to cultured fibroblast cell
lines, probably due to their relatively high abundance in
the contractile apparatus.
During embryogenesis no significant differences in
expression from E7 until E17 could be observed for tran-

scripts of mG5PR/B"γ, mPR59/B"δ1 and mPR59/B"δ2,
indicating that the expression of these proteins is not regulated during early embryonic development. Meanwhile,
mPR130/B"α1 and mPR72/B"α2 expression increases
from E7 to E17. This might imply a role for these proteins
during early embryogenesis. Alternatively, protein levels
of these isoforms are simply building up for a more maximal expression during late development or after birth. In
accordance with this increased expression during embryogenesis, depletion of XPR72 in Xenopus embryos caused
several severe developmental defects (defects in somite
formation, a short axis phenotype and lack of eye differentiation) [15]. Depletion of XPR130 resulted in milder
developmental defects such as a disruption of somite
organisation and an underdeveloped tail [16]. Together
these data provide valuable information that will aid in
the development of suitable strategies to generate future
B" knockout mice, as well as in their phenotypic analysis.

Conclusion

At the cellular level, we have also determined the subcellular localisation of the main murine and human B" subunits via expression of EGFP-fusion proteins in COS7 cells
(for PR72/B"α2, G5PR/B"γ, PR70/B"β1, PR59/B"δ1 and
PR59/B"δ2) or via indirect immunofluorescence (for
PR130/B"α1). A high diversity was observed: whereas
PR130/B"α1, PR72/B"α2 and G5PR/B"γ are predominantly nuclear, PR59/B"δ1 is equally well expressed in the
cytoplasm, and PR70/B"β1 and PR59/B"δ2 are predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. The latter observation
further extends the relationship and functional homology
between these two isoforms. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic localisation of PR70/B"β1 is in contrast with the
reported nuclear localisation of its truncated PR48 form
[20], suggesting that nuclear import/export of PR70 isoforms may be a regulated event. Further, putative nuclear
localisation signals are predicted in G5PR/B"γ (monoand bipartite), PR130/B"α1 and PR72/B"α2 (monopartite), but not in PR59/B"δ1, PR59/B"δ2 or PR70/B"β1,
whereas a nuclear export signal is predicted in the common part of PR59/B"δ1 and PR59/B"δ2. Although the
functionality of these motifs remains to be determined,
their putative occurrence/absence fits quite well with our
experimental observations.

Methods

Upon overexpression, all B" subunits tested can induce a
G1/S cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells, suggesting that this
property may be independent of their subcellular localisation. The failure to proceed to S-phase may be related to
the suggestion that many B" subunits play roles in DNA
replication [9,10,13,14,20]. However, the mechanism of
this induced cell cycle arrest may equally well be the result
of a dominant negative effect, such as for instance a competition between 'free' B" [11] and trimeric B" for binding
a substrate, or competition between B" and other B-type
subunits for binding to PP2AD.

In conclusion, the murine PR72/B" family exhibits an
equal complexity and diversity as the PR55/B and PR61/
B' families of PP2A subunits, with three genes encoding
nine isoforms/splice variants, of which at least five are
abundantly expressed and give rise to genuine PP2A subunits. An important difference with the PR55/B and PR61/
B' families however, is the poorer relationship between
human and murine genes, which might indicate that the
B" family is evolutionary more divergent. Moreover, the
diversity of PR72/B" members does not only originate
from the number of isoforms, but extends to their specific
tissue distribution, developmental expression and subcellular localisation. These differences add to the notion that
no matter how similar their primary structures may be,
different PP2A B-type isoforms likely display different in
vivo functions. To explore these functions in mouse models remains an exciting challenge for the future.

[32P]UTP using Ambion's Strippable RNA probe synthesis
and removal kit.
Northern blotting
A Mouse Tissue MTN® Blot containing poly(A+) RNA from
eight murine tissues and a Mouse Embryo MTN® Blot containing poly(A+) RNA from murine embryos at days 7, 11,
15 and 17 were obtained from Clontech Laboratories. The
membranes were hybridised at 64°C using Ambion's Ultrahyb Ultrasensitive hybridisation buffer and washed
with Northern Max Low and High Stringency Buffers from
Ambion. They were exposed and analysed using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Probe removal was done
using Ambion's Strippable RNA probe synthesis and
removal kit. For quantification we used the ImageQuant
program from Molecular Dynamics. Absolute values of
the different tissues and embryonic stages were first
divided by the absolute β-actin values of the corresponding tissue/embryonic stages. These values where then
compared with the value of the most intense band on the
tissue blot, which was given a value of 100%.
Subcellular localisation
PCR fragments of hPR72/B"α2, hPR70/B"β1, mG5PR/
B"γ, mPR59/B"δ1 and mPR59/B"δ2 were cloned into the
SmaI restriction site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). 1 μg of each
plasmid was transfected into COS7 cells grown on a glass
coverslip in a 12-well dish. 24 h after transfection, cells
were washed in PBS and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After 3 washes with PBS, cells
were mounted in Prolong gold antifade reagent with DAPI
(Invitrogen). For immunofluorescence staining of endogenous PR130, COS7 cells grown on a glass coverslip were
rinsed with PBS and fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated with
PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma)
for 30 min and then for 45 min with the PR130N rec. primary antibodies, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor
488 donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen)
in PBS with 1% BSA. Finally, the cells were washed 3 times
in PBS, once in water and mounted in Prolong gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). All slides were examined with a LSM-510 laser scanning confocal microscope
(Zeiss, Jena, Germany), using a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.6 Oil
DIC objective.
FACS Analysis
Asynchronously growing HeLa cells were transfected with
pEGFP-C1 or the GFP fusion plasmids of the different B"
subunits in two 10-cm dishes per plasmid. If nocodazole
(1 μg/ml) was used, it was added at this point for another
16 h before FACS analysis. 48 h after transfection, cells
were trypsinised, washed in PBS and fixed for 5 min in 4%
paraformaldehyde at room temperature. After washing,
the cell pellet was incubated in 0.5 ml of PBS containing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/393

100 μg/ml propidium iodide (Fluka) and 0.1% RNase for
at least 1 h at room temperature. The samples were analysed with a Beckman Instruments Coulter Epics XL flow
cytometer (Analis) on FL1 (for EGFP) and FL3 (for propidium iodide) using standard procedures, and the System II™ software (Analis) and WinMDI Version 2.8
software for quantification.
Immunohistochemistry
Wild-type mice were anaesthetised with pentobarbital
(Nembutal, CEVA) and transcardially perfused with PBS
containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Organs were removed,
postfixed overnight at 4°C and paraffin embedded. Sections (7 μM) were mounted on silan coated glass slides
(Menzel gläser). For antigen retrieval, dewaxed and rehydrated tissue sections were boiled in 10 mM citric acid
(pH 6.0) for 10 min. After cooling the slides, endogenous
peroxidase was removed with 0.03% H2O2 in methanol
for 20 min and transferred to PBS solution. Subsequently,
sections were encircled with a water-repellent PAP-pen
(Zymed) and rinsed with PBS. After blocking with PBS
containing 1% BSA for 45 min, sections were immunoreacted for 1 h at RT with primary antibodies, washed 3
times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBS-T), incubated with biotinylated goat anti-Rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Labs) at RT for 30 min, and washed three
times with PBS-T. After incubation for 30 min with the
VECTASTAIN ABC Systems (Vector Labs), sections were
washed 3 times in PBS-T, incubated with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (1 tablet dissolved in 10 ml 50
mM Tris pH 7.6, MP Biomedicals), washed three times in
water and incubated with hematoxylin (Sigma) or iron
hematoxylin (Sigma) for 2 min. Next, sections were
washed in tap water for 5', dehydrated and mounted using
Depex. Tissue sections were examined using a light microscope equipped with a digital camera (DC200, Leica
Microsystems).
