Abstract
Martin & Koonin recently proposed that the eukaryote nucleus evolved as a quality control
mechanism to prevent ribosome readthrough into introns. In their scenario, the bacterial ancestor
of mitochondria was resident in an archaeal cell, and group II introns (carried by the fledgling
mitochondrion) inserted into coding regions in the archaeal host genome. They suggest that if
transcription and translation were coupled, and because splicing is expected to have been slower
than translation, the effect of insertion would have been ribosome readthrough into introns,
resulting in production of aberrant proteins. The emergence of the nuclear compartment would
thus have served to separate transcription and splicing from translation, thereby alleviating this
problem. In this article, I argue that Martin & Koonin's model is not compatible with current
knowledge. The model requires that group II introns would spread aggressively through an archaeal
genome. It is well known that selfish elements can spread through an outbreeding sexual population
despite a substantial fitness cost to the host. The same is not true for asexual lineages however,
where both theory and observation argue that such elements will be under pressure to reduce
proliferation, and may be lost completely. The recent introduction of group II introns into archaea
by horizontal transfer provides a natural test case with which to evaluate Martin & Koonin's model.
The distribution and behaviour of these introns fits prior theoretical expectations, not the scenario
of aggressive proliferation advocated by Martin & Koonin. I therefore conclude that the
mitochondrial seed hypothesis for the origin of eukaryote introns, on which their model is based,
better explains the early expansion of introns in eukaryotes. The mitochondrial seed hypothesis
has the capacity to separate the origin of eukaryotes from the origin of introns, leaving open the
possibility that the cell that engulfed the ancestor of mitochondria was a sexually outcrossing
eukaryote cell.

Background
In two papers published this year (one on Biology Direct
[1], and one coauthored by W. Martin in Nature [2]),
Eugene Koonin argues that intron proliferation played a
key role in the evolution of eukaryotes from an ancestral
archaeon. I argue here that an archaeal host is not compat-

ible with intron proliferation under the introns late model
for the origin of introns.
In brief, Koonin's model proposes the following steps in
the evolution of modern eukaryotes:

1. Endosymbiosis: a bacterium of α-proteobacterial origin
takes up residence in an archaeal host, by an unspecified
mechanism.
2. Endosymbiont to host gene transfer: group II self-splicing introns resident in the endosymbiont are transferred
to the genome of the archaeal host, and subsequently proliferate in the host genome.
3. Intron proliferation results in selection for improved
mechanisms of quality control – compartmental separation of splicing and translation via evolution of the
nuclear envelope, nonsense-mediated decay, ubiquitindependent protein degradation – all of which serve to
reduce formation of aberrant polypeptides via translational readthrough of intron-disrupted open reading
frames.
The series of events described by Koonin in point 3 build
on points 1 and 2, namely, that the host cell was an
archaeon, and that group II introns entered the archaeal
host genome, inserted into open reading frames and proliferated greatly in number. These two points are not interdependent, and a criticism of one does not therefore
invalidate the other.
Here I raise two criticisms of Koonin's model. The first
concerns point one above. I argue that current observations of contemporary and past endosymbioses do not
readily support an archaeal host and a protoeukaryotic
host does not conflict with the absence of extant archezoa.
Point two relates to the likelihood of group II intron
spread in an archaeon, where I point out that both theory
and observation speak against proliferation and insertion
into open reading frames in an asexual host. In advocating
the first two points, Koonin [1] and Martin & Koonin [2]
inadvertently eliminate the strongest support for the
introns late hypothesis. Aspects of Koonin's model (point
3 above) may still hold, but both theory and data indicate
that massive proliferation of selfish elements only occurs
in lineages with meiotic sex. My conclusion is that large
scale intron proliferation would only be possible in a sexual 'protoeukaryote'.
It is worth noting at this point that a model bearing similarities to the Koonin/Martin model has been published
independently by López-García & Moreira [3]. While I
focus this critique on the Koonin/Martin model, some of
the issues raised are likewise relevant to aspects of the
López-García/Moreira model.

Could group II introns proliferate aggressively in
an archaeon?
Koonin suggests that group II introns entered an archaeal
host via the α-proteobacterial endosymbiont. The conse-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/36

quence is an explosion in intron numbers, compensatory
evolution of a number of mechanisms of transcript quality control (the nucleus [2], nonsense-mediated decay
(NMD), ubiquitinylation), and side-effects such as the
evolution of linear chromosomes with telomeres and telomerase.
The important point here is that group II introns, upon
arrival in the archaeal host have, 'apparently, gone berserk
within the host cell' (see also [2]). Like the mitochondrial
seed hypothesis [4,5], upon which Koonin's model is
based, the argument is based on two premises. First, that
group II introns are the ancestors of spliceosomal introns
and the spliceosome, and second, that introns would proliferate in the genome of the host (under both models this
can apply both to group II intron spread and later spliceosomal intron spread after the evolution of the spliceosome). Regarding the first point, there is plenty of
circumstantial evidence that can be interpreted in favour
of a common ancestry. Alternative interpretations are nevertheless possible, and I discuss this briefly in the referee
report that accompanies Koonin [1]. I will not reiterate
that point here; the current discussion is best served by
assuming that group II introns did indeed enter the
eukaryote lineage via the mitochondrial ancestor, later
evolving into the spliceosome and spliceosomal introns.
The second premise is that group II introns would have
proliferated in the host genome. Both papers [1,2] argue
that introns would have been selectively disadvantageous;
below I describe why this is important, but here is the reasoning given for the selective disadvantage of intron insertion. If host transcription and translation are coupled, and
excision of newly inserted introns is the slowest step in
production of a functional message, the ribosome runs
the risk of reading through into the intron before it has
been spliced out. This can therefore result in formation of
aberrant proteins.
A further key feature of this model is that the source of
group II introns invading any host genome is the mitochondrion; spread of group II introns between individuals
(i.e. intergenomic spread) is not invoked. The model permits any host genome within the population to receive
group II introns from their mitochondria (endosymbiont
gene transfer), so transfer is iterative and ongoing. However, the main source of intron proliferation is spread of
introns already integrated into the host genome (intragenomic spread). According to the model, the small effective population size of this new 'prekaryotic chimera'
means it is not possible to eliminate group II intron proliferation by purifying selection; drift will dominate, and
individuals in which intron proliferation is occurring will
be fixed, in spite of their reduced fitness.

That genetic elements can proliferate at the expense of the
fitness of the host in which they are found is now widely
accepted. However, this is only predicted to occur under
certain circumstances. A model published by Hickey [6],
illustrates under which circumstances this will occur, and
furthermore shows that spread is not predicted under the
conditions invoked in the Koonin/Martin model. Moreover, a documented case of recent group II intron invasion
into archaea fits with Hickey's model, not the Koonin/
Martin model. Finally, I will point out that the mitochondrial seed hypothesis (upon which the Koonin/Martin
model is based, but which in contrast allows the host to
be a sexual eukaryote) is compatible with the predicted
behaviour of selfish genetic elements described by Hickey.
What follows is a brief summary of the relevant aspects of
Hickey's model, which I will relate back to the Koonin/
Martin model. The first point concerns the nature of
intragenomic spread. Hickey defines the average copy
number per cell (f) of a transposable element in a population as:

ab
f =
N
where a is the average copy number of the element per
genome, counting only those genomes with at least one
copy; b is the number of genomes containing one or more
copies; N is the population size (number of genomes).
f can increase via an increase in either a or b. If f increases
due to an increase in a, this is intragenomic spread; the
element is increasing in frequency only because those
genomes containing copies now contain even higher
numbers of the element. In this case, which describes an
asexual population, elements do not spread to new
genomes. Consequently, those individuals with harmful
elements (as per Koonin/Martin) will be at a selective disadvantage relative to those without, and element-carrying
individuals are not predicted to spread within the population.
The parameter b is not irrelevant to the Koonin/Martin
model. While the model does not include intergenomic
spread between individuals, endosymbiont gene transfer
of group II introns enables b to increase in the absence of
intergenomic spread. Therefore, it is possible for group II
introns to be fixed in the short term, by drift or by high
rates of endosymbiont gene transfer.
This is unsurprising in that we know that group II introns
exist in both bacterial and archaeal lineages, and are able
to spread via horizontal gene transfer. However, what is
not observed is massive proliferation within these asexual
lineages, even in the presence of horizontal gene transfer.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/36

A case in point is the recent discovery of group II introns
in two species of archaea, Methanosarcina acetovorans and
Methanosarcina mazei [7,8]; in both cases, group II introns
have become established as the result of horizontal gene
transfer from bacteria. This provides an ideal analogue to
the 'primitive prekaryote' host genome, a garden-variety
archaeon. Assuming rates of gene transfer and proliferation are similar to Methanosarcina spp. and that these species are sufficiently 'garden-variety', one would expect a
similar rate of proliferation as in the Koonin/Martin
model. However, none of the group II introns are inserted
in archaeal open-reading frames, hence do not result in
ribosome readthrough. Instead, these genes have a tendency to insert into the reverse transcriptase genes
encoded by other group II introns, generating nested
introns. I have no idea as to the effective population size
of these two archaea, but that these elements have neither
gone berserk (4 in M. mazei, 21 in M. acetovorans), nor
inserted into archaeal protein-coding genes does not serve
to strengthen the model presented by Koonin.
Rather, this is what one may expect for selfish elements in
asexual lineages, even with horizontal gene transfer. Upon
insertion, such elements will end up in linkage disequilibrium with the other genes in the genome (there is no meiotic recombination and no outbreeding). Consequently,
in the long term, even if drift fixes the presence of an element that imparts a cost to the host, elements that evolve
to be less harmful will be at a selective advantage; the fitness of the host and the element are identical. Thus, rather
than spreading wildly, the result will be more cautious
mechanisms of maintenance or spread. That the group II
introns from Methanosarcina spp. have not inserted into
coding regions is probably consistent with this. Likewise,
assuming some cost associated with element presence,
individuals that completely lose the elements will be at an
advantage [6,9].
If an element does proliferate wildly in an asexual population, the cost to all individuals may become so high as
to lead to population extinction. Indeed, it has recently
been argued that element overload is one probable cause
of extinction of obligately asexual lineages that have
evolved from sexual lineages [10]. Survival would entail
loss of those elements with the highest cost (i.e. that proliferate greatly in number). Consistent with this is the
observation that retrotransposons appear to have been
completely lost from Bdelloid rotifers, which evolved
from sexual ancestors some 80 million years ago [11]. The
same picture is seen for Giardia lamblia, which is not
known to be sexual [12], and which, incidentally, is very
intron-poor, with only three introns identified to date
[13,14].

The bottom line is that even if endosymbiont transfer can
ensure an increase in the proportion of individuals carrying one or more genomic copies of an element, there will
still be a selective advantage for attenuation, even if complete loss does not occur.
Assuming introns-late, these elements have must have
proliferated at some stage during early eukaryote evolution. Again, Hickey's paper explains under which circumstances this can occur, even when the element has a
deleterious effect on the fitness of the host. In an attempt
to avoid reproducing the entire paper here, the key point
is that this will happen in a diploid, sexual, outbreeding
population.
Individuals carrying the element, despite having a lower
fitness relative to element-free individuals, will nevertheless dominate the population. Considering just a single
locus, when the frequency of the element in the population is close to zero, the element will double in frequency
within the population because most zygotes receive a single copy (they begin as heterozygotes) but pass on twice
as many copies per gamete (transposition makes them
homozygous for the element). If they are only half as fit as
element-free individuals (i.e. they pass on only half as
many gametes), the number of copies of the element that
are passed on is the same for a normal nontransposable
gene. Consequently, provided the cost to the host is < 0.5,
and with high efficiency of transposition, the element will
spread. Hickey's model illustrates that, as the element
increases in the population, selection against individuals
can rise significantly above 0.5, yet this will not impede
further spread.
What this is telling us then is that meiotic sex and outbreeding are prerequisites for introns to have proliferated
massively under introns-late. For Koonin's theory to work
over a long enough time scale for several complex systems
of quality control to emerge, I would argue that he should
at least have invoked the emergence of facultative meiotic
sex. The problem with this is that sex, with its two-fold
reproductive cost, must be invoked under a scenario
where there is a population of primed selfish elements
'waiting' to spread. While the level of sexuality can be
increased in a facultatively sexual population, this is not
so for an asexual population [9]. As the ever-present difficulty with models for the origin of sex is accounting for
the short-term selective advantage for sex, this would represent a rather backwards way of approaching the problem!

ing an early eukaryote stem lineage that had already
evolved meiosis (see [15] for recent discussion on the timing of the evolution of meiosis). Contrary to what Koonin
[1] and Martin & Koonin [2] advocate, it is not certain that
eukaryotes evolved directly from archaea, a point
addressed in detail elsewhere [16], and which I summarise in three points here.
I will begin by stating two points of broad agreement.
There is overwhelming phylogenetic evidence for the αproteobacterial origin of mitochondria and related
organelles, but this is not true for an archaeal origin of
eukaryotes. Key evidence for α-proteobacterial origin of
eukaryotes comes from phylogenetic studies which show
that mitochondrial genes are most closely related α-proteobacterial genes [17]. In addition to the clear morphological similarities between mitochondria and bacteria,
numerous observations such as gene order conservation
and bacterial-like ribosomes serve to emphasise the similarity between mitochondria and bacteria [17].
It is likewise accepted that there are numerous similarities
between archaea and eukaryotes [18] – eukaryote-like histones have been found in both euryarchaea and crenarchaea [19]; archaea and eukaryotes make use of small
RNAs (known as small nucleolar or snoRNAs in eukaryotes) to guide ribose methylation and pseudouridylation of
rRNA [20]; and similarities have been observed between
archaeal and eukaryotic DNA replication machinery
[21,22].
What is less widely discussed is that these similarities can
be accounted for by several scenarios, all of which can be
tested phylogenetically. The first scenario is that archaea
and eukaryotes are sister groups. In other words, each is
monophyletic, and the two groups share a common
ancestor. The second is that eukaryotes evolved directly
from an archaeal ancestor, and thirdly, archaea could have
evolved directly from a eukaryotic ancestor. No data exist
to support the third suggestion, and to my knowledge, no
one has ever argued that archaea evolved directly from
eukaryotes; I include it solely for completeness. Direct evidence for the second suggestion would be that at least
some eukaryote genes with archaeal orthologues are
found to group within the diversity of modern archaea in
a phylogenetic tree, with bacteria as outgroup. The first
scenario can account for sequence similarity between
archaeal and eukaryotic sequences, with the prediction
that, for those sequences with sufficient phylogenetic
information, the monophyly of the two domains is recovered.

Saving introns-late
Invoking a garden-variety (asexual) archaeon as Koonin
does serves to weaken the introns-late hypothesis because
it eliminates the possibility of the mitochondrion enter-

If archaea had already become a distinct domain prior to
the origin of eukaryotes, eukaryote nuclear genes of
archaeal origin should group specifically within the diver-

Biology Direct 2006, 1:36

sity of modern archaea, in exactly the same way as genes
of mitochondrial origin fall within the diversity of modern bacteria, showing a specific relationship to α-proteobacteria. We see this clearly for mitochondrial-origin
genes, but this has not been shown to be the case for supposedly archaeal-origin genes. That many archaeal genes
are similar to eukaryotic genes supports a common origin
for the two domains, but does not demonstrate that
eukaryotes evolved from archaea. For this to be supported
requires an explicit phylogenetic affinity between eukaryote genes and orthologous genes from a specific group of
archaea, for instance methanogens [23,24]. So point one
is that, if eukaryotes evolved from an endosymbiosis
between a bacterium and an archaeon, we should see phylogenetic evidence for this.
Point two is that no extant intermediate forms are
observed that can clarify the evolution of the numerous
differences between archaea and eukaryotes. The popularity of an archaeal host for the mitochondrion emerged
because the archezoa, a paraphyletic group thought to
have evolved before the introduction of the mitochondrion, did not diversify prior to the endosymbiosis that
gave rise to mitochondria and its derivatives (mitosomes
and hydrogenosomes) – all 'archezoa' either still have, or
have lost, this organelle [2]. Therefore, as has been argued
by numerous authors, and is now widely accepted, we
need to include mitochondria in the list of eukaryote-specific features that evolved prior to the diversification of
modern eukaryotes. This list includes features such as
meiosis, linear chromosomes, the spliceosome and spliceosomal introns, the nucleus and nucleolus, to name but
a few prominent traits. All these eukaryote-specific features have arguably evolved in the stem leading to modern
eukaryotes, and our ability to conclude these are derived
and that archaea represent the ancestral state requires,
ergo, that phylogenetically, eukaryotes are endosymbiontcarrying archaea.
One has to accept the necessity of stem-lineage eukaryote
ancestors irrespective of the absence of extant primitively
amitochondriate eukaryotes. By stem lineage I do not
mean the extant eukaryotes that were formerly designated
archezoa. I mean lineages of eukaryotes that have gone
extinct and which diverged from the lineage leading to the
Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (see [25] for standard
definitions of stem and crown groups). This is because,
even if (as Koonin argues) the ancestors of eukaryotes
were archaea bearing α-proteobacterial endosymbionts,
there are no intermediate stages between this hypothetical
ancestor and modern eukaryotes [16].
The third point is that no archaea are known to carry
endosymbionts, hence Koonin's model requires that this
capacity evolved in archaea and then subsequently disap-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/36

peared completely. There are no known cases modern
archaea housing bacterial endosymbionts. All endosymbioses that have generated organelles (chloroplast, secondary and tertiary endosymbioses) subsequent to the
mitochondrion clearly involve eukaryotes [26], and modern examples of endosymbioses involving eukaryotes are
widespread. While there is one example of a bacterium
within a bacterium within a eukaryote [27] this is not
equivalent to a bacterial-archaeal endosymbiosis. Consequently, the entire thesis rests on the unproven ability for
archaea to be capable of hosting endosymbionts.

Concluding remarks
In summary, I am not convinced that the host in the endosymbiosis leading to modern eukaryotes was an archaeon.
This should be detectable phylogenetically, picking out a
specific group of archaea as the closest relatives of eukaryotes in exactly the same way as this is possible for the
mitochondrion. Second, no archaea have been identified
which carry endosymbiont bacteria, so accepting
Koonin's assumption would require that all extant
archaea have subsequently lost this capacity. Nor am I
convinced that the transfer of group II introns into an
archaeal host from its bacterial endosymbiont would have
led to massive expansion of group II elements. This does
not fit with our current knowledge of selfish element
spread under an asexual reproductive mode. That modern
methanogenic archaea of the genus Methanosarcina have
not suffered from massive intron expansion seems to confirm this suspicion.
Importantly, even if eukaryotes had evolved from archaea,
the model still runs counter to a considerable body of
knowledge on selfish element proliferation. By invoking a
sexual, eukaryotic host (as a later step in evolution from
archaea), the spread of introns in eukaryotes can better be
accounted for under our current understanding of selfish
element spread in sexual populations. Without the conditions created by intron spread the selection pressure to
drive the emergence of the eukaryotic nucleus and features
for quality control must come from some other source.

Author's note
This comment article began as a referee report I wrote
when reviewing Koonin [1]. Dr. Koonin suggested that
that report should instead be published as a stand-alone
piece. However, this would either require that the report
was withdrawn and not published alongside his paper, or
that it would be duplicated in its entirety. As neither solution seemed ideal, I have rewritten the original commentary, focusing on what I view as the most pertinent points.
My sincere thanks go to Dr. Koonin for fostering a climate
of open and collegial debate.
