Abstract
Background: A detailed understanding of an RNA's correct secondary and tertiary structure is
crucial to understanding its function and mechanism in the cell. Free energy minimization with
energy parameters based on the nearest-neighbor model and comparative analysis are the primary
methods for predicting an RNA's secondary structure from its sequence. Version 3.1 of Mfold has
been available since 1999. This version contains an expanded sequence dependence of energy
parameters and the ability to incorporate coaxial stacking into free energy calculations. We test
Mfold 3.1 by performing the largest and most phylogenetically diverse comparison of rRNA and
tRNA structures predicted by comparative analysis and Mfold, and we use the results of our tests
on 16S and 23S rRNA sequences to assess the improvement between Mfold 2.3 and Mfold 3.1.
Results: The average prediction accuracy for a 16S or 23S rRNA sequence with Mfold 3.1 is 41%,
while the prediction accuracies for the majority of 16S and 23S rRNA structures tested are
between 20% and 60%, with some having less than 20% prediction accuracy. The average prediction
accuracy was 71% for 5S rRNA and 69% for tRNA. The majority of the 5S rRNA and tRNA
sequences have prediction accuracies greater than 60%. The prediction accuracy of 16S rRNA
base-pairs decreases exponentially as the number of nucleotides intervening between the 5' and 3'
halves of the base-pair increases.
Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that the current set of nearest-neighbor energy parameters in
conjunction with the Mfold folding algorithm are unable to consistently and reliably predict an
RNA's correct secondary structure. For 16S or 23S rRNA structure prediction, Mfold 3.1 offers
little improvement over Mfold 2.3. However, the nearest-neighbor energy parameters do work
well for shorter RNA sequences such as tRNA or 5S rRNA, or for larger rRNAs when the contact
distance between the base-pairs is less than 100 nucleotides.

Background
The biological functions of 16S, 23S and 5S rRNAs,
tRNAs, telomerase RNA, Group I and II introns, RNaseP,
and other structural RNAs are dictated by their threedimensional structures. Thus, an accurate depiction of an
RNA's secondary and tertiary structure is fundamental for
our understanding of the mechanisms and consequences
of its function, and an accurate prediction of an RNA folding into its secondary and tertiary structure from its primary structure will have a significant effect on our study
of molecular biology. This RNA folding problem is usually divided into two components: the first is the determination of an RNA's folding pathway, and the second is the
accurate and reliable prediction of an RNA's secondary
and tertiary structure from its primary structure. In this
paper, we focus on the second aspect and in particular
RNA secondary structure prediction, which is a difficult
problem. It has been estimated that the number of secondary structures models is greater than 1.8n, where n is
the number of nucleotides (nt) in the sequence[1]. For
example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Phe-tRNA is only 76 nt
in length and has an estimated 2.5 × 1019 secondary structure models, while a larger RNA, such as the 16S rRNA
from Escherichia coli, with 1542 nt, has an estimated total
of 4.3 × 10393 possible secondary structure models.
The most popular method for predicting RNA secondary
structure from a single sequence is free energy minimization using a dynamic programming approach[2,3], based
on energy parameters determined according to the nearest-neighbor model[4-10]. Programs based on this technique include Mfold[2,11], RNAStructure[12,13] and
RNAFold[14]. Mfold is the most popular program in use
today. By default, Mfold determines the optimal (minimum energy) structure and a set of suboptimal foldings
that are within 12 kcal/mol (default setting) of the minimum energy structure. The set of suboptimal foldings
exists and covers such a large energy range due to uncertainties in the thermodynamic data[2]. Mfold applies the
following constraints: 1) only G:C, A:U and G:U basepairs are formed (due to limitations of the energy parameters), 2) hairpin loops have at least three bases, and 3) no
pseudoknotted structures are formed[15]. Attempts have
been made to characterize the reliability of an RNA secondary structure prediction using dot plots[16].
Comparative analysis is another method for predicting
RNA secondary and some tertiary structure[17-25]. Comparative analysis of RNA sequences and structures is a
knowledge-based technique based on two fundamental
assumptions: 1) different, homologous RNA sequences
are capable of folding into the same secondary and tertiary structure, and 2) during the course of evolution, the
secondary and tertiary structure of an RNA molecule
remains mostly unchanged, while the primary structure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/105

can change significantly. The accuracy of the comparative
method has recently been established using high-resolution crystal structures for the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits[26,27]. Over 97% of the secondary structure basepairs predicted by comparative analysis are present in the
crystal structures[28].
The superior performance of the comparative method
may lead one to incorrectly assume that the other methods for RNA secondary structure prediction are no longer
necessary. Different methods for predicting RNA secondary structure are utilized in different situations and can
have different objectives. Free energy minimization based
RNA structure prediction methods are usually applied to
a single RNA sequence. The most energetically stable RNA
secondary structure(s) that are composed of canonical
G:C, A:U, and G:U base-pairs and organized into standard
helices are predicted. Non-canonical base-pairs and basepairs not in standard helices cannot be predicted at this
time. In contrast, RNA comparative sequence analysis
methods predict a structure by searching an alignment for
base-pairings that are common to all sequences in the
dataset. This latter method can accurately predict canonical and non-canonical base-pairs that occur in secondary
and tertiary structures. However, RNA comparative analysis is an iterative process requiring substantial sequence
data, accurate sequence alignments, and the analysis of a
structure that is common to all of the sequences in the
dataset. In order to create an initial alignment, sequences
must have significant identity to be aligned accurately
while having sufficient variation (and covariation) to
identify potential base-pairs and posit a structural hypothesis. The structural hypothesis is subsequently tested,
refined, and expanded by the addition of more sequences
to the alignment. Much of this process is still done manually, as computational tools to automate the process do
not currently exist. The most recent comparative structure
model for SSU rRNA is based on an alignment of 7,000
sequences[28]. The data was collected and the model was
refined over a period of 20 years. The sequences included
in this analysis are very diverse, spanning the entire tree of
life.
In 1995 and 1996, the Gutell Lab conducted two comprehensive studies that: 1) determined how well the optimal
secondary structure model predicted with the program
Mfold (version 2.3) matched the structure model determined with comparative analysis for a set of 16S and 23S
rRNAs, and 2) examined other aspects of the folding, such
as the prediction accuracy of "short-range" base-pairs
(base-pairings where the 5' and 3' halves of the base-pair
are separated by 100 nt or less), or the prediction accuracy
for base-pairs in different loop environments, to learn
more about differences between the thermodynamic and
comparative models[29,30]. The most significant findings

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/105

from those studies were: 1) the average accuracy of the
optimal prediction for a 16S rRNA was 46% while the
average accuracy for a 23S rRNA was 44%. 2) The accuracies of the predicted secondary structure models for at
least one individual 16S or 23S rRNA sequence were as
high as 80% and as low as 10%. 3) On average, the
Archaeal rRNAs were predicted with the highest accuracy,
followed by the (eu)-Bacterial and Chloroplast, then
Mitochondrial and Eukaryotic Nuclear rRNAs. 4) Shortrange pairings, which comprised 75% of the total comparative base pairings for both 16S and 23S rRNA, were predicted more accurately than long-range pairings (basepairings where the 5' and 3' halves of the base-pair are separated by more that 100 nt). 5) Base-pairs closing hairpin
loops were predicted more accurately than those closing
internal and multistem loops.

determined with comparative analysis. In addition, we
compared the predictions and accuracies of Mfold 3.1
with its predecessor, Mfold 2.3, for a large set of phylogenetically diverse 16S and 23S rRNA sequences. All metrics
considered in previous studies to evaluate the accuracy of
Mfold 2.3[29,30] were revisited here. In addition, we analyzed the suboptimal population of predicted secondary
structures and characterized metrics such as the number of
suboptimals that were better (or worse) than the optimal
structure prediction, the total number of comparative
base-pairs observed, and the number of times a given
base-pair is predicted in a set of optimal and suboptimal
structure predictions. Only the most significant findings
and metrics were discussed here; the reader is referred to
the website[36] for a detailed presentation of all results
from this analysis.

Since those studies were completed in 1995, four new
developments have directly affected RNA structure prediction. 1) A new version of Mfold (3.1) was released with
energy parameters revised to include sequence dependence and different secondary structure motifs[31]. 2) The
accuracy of the comparative model for ribosomal RNA
was established[28] with high-resolution crystal structure
data from both the small and large ribosomal subunits[26,27]. 3) The number of available 16S and 23S
rRNA secondary structures determined by comparative
analysis increased significantly[24]. 4) Faster computers,
which have significantly decreased the time it takes to fold
an individual sequence, had become available to facilitate
large-scale folding studies. These developments afforded
us the opportunity to do a comprehensive re-evaluation
of Mfold.

Results

For more than 20 years, the basic paradigm for RNA secondary structure prediction, from a single sequence, has
essentially remained the same: global free energy minimization with refinements to the nearest-neighbor energy
parameters and minimization algorithms in an attempt to
improve prediction accuracy. Refinements to the energy
parameters, summarized in multiple sources[31-33],
included measures for effects such as base-pair mismatches, base-pair positioning in helices, internal, bulge
and multistem loops, and coaxial stacking. Newer versions of the program Mfold included these refinements in
energy parameters in addition to improvements in the
folding algorithm[31,34,35]. We questioned whether the
improvements in the energy parameters and the algorithms could result in dramatic improvements in the accuracy and reliability of RNA secondary structure prediction
programs such as Mfold, or would the energy-based RNA
folding approach need to be fundamentally altered.
To begin to address this question, we analyzed the ability
of Mfold 3.1 to predict RNA secondary structure models

Comparative structure database
The dataset assembled for this study was significantly
larger than previous studies comparing RNA structure
models predicted by comparative analysis and the Mfold
folding program[29-31,35]. In particular, the 1995 and
1996 studies conducted by the Gutell Lab with Mfold 2.3
analyzed only 56 16S[29] and 72 23S[30] rRNA
sequences respectively, and the 1999 study by Mathews et
al. with Mfold 3.1 analyzed a total of 151,503 nt and
43,519 comparatively predicted canonical base-pairs (i.e.,
G:C, A:U and G:U) from 955 sequences, which included
22 16S, 5 23S, and 309 5S rRNA sequences, 484 tRNA
sequences 23 Group I and three Group II intron
sequences, 91 SRP sequences, and 16 RNase P
sequences[31]. For this study, our sequence set included
all three types of rRNA (5S, 16S and 23S) and Type I tRNA.
As shown in Table 1, we analyzed a total of 1,411 RNA
sequences, encompassing 1,505,143 nt and 385,854
canonical secondary structure base-pairs. Of the 1,411
sequences analyzed, 569 were tRNA, 496 were 16S rRNA,
256 were 23S rRNA, and 90 were 5S rRNA.

While the size of the comparative structure databases
increased significantly between this study and previous
Gutell Lab studies, only minor differences exist between
the 1995 and 2004 versions of the 16S and 23S rRNA
comparative structure models. For the 2004 version of the
Haloferax volcanii 16S rRNA secondary structure model, 30
base-pairs were added, 17 base-pairs were removed, and
427 base-pairs remained unchanged, resulting in a net difference of approximately 3% in the total number of basepairs in the model. Similar numbers were observed for the
other comparatively predicted structures evaluated. The
comparative structure database used by Mathews et
al.(1999) utilized known modified nucleotide information in tRNA to limit the base-pairing potential for those
nucleotides that are modified[31]. In this study, rRNA or

tRNA base modifications were not taken into account. A
simple analysis of our tRNA dataset shows that 70% of
our tRNA sequences came from genomic DNA sequences:
as a result, no modification data was available for those
sequences. For the remaining 30%, the number of modifications that could prevent A-form helix formation was
minimal; between only 1 to 5 modifications per sequence.
Our dataset was extremely diverse in sequence and structure and included sequences from each of the three major
phylogenetic domains, the Archaea, Bacteria, and
Eucarya[37]. The eukaryotic dataset included sequences
encoded in the Nucleus, Chloroplast and Mitochondrion.
Since a dataset with sequences that were nearly identical
would be less useful than a dataset with significant variation between the sequences, we characterized the diversity
of the sequences in our dataset by calculating sequence
identity for all pairs of 16S and 23S rRNA sequences
within the different phylogenetic classifications of our
dataset.
For our 16S rRNA dataset, 75% of the Archaeal, 86% of
the Bacteria, 71% of the Chloroplast, 99% of the Mitochondrial, and 94% of the Eukaryotic Nuclear sequence
pairs had less than 80% sequence identity, while only 4%
or fewer of the pairs in a given phylogenetic classification
had 95% or more sequence identity (Table 1). Moreover,
79% of the Mitochondrial and 48% of the Eukaryotic
Nuclear 16S rRNA sequence pairs had less than 50%
sequence identity (Figure 1). The 23S rRNA dataset exhibited even more diversity than the 16S rRNA dataset, as
87% of the Archaeal, 94% of the Bacteria, 76% of the
Chloroplast, 99% of the Mitochondrial, and 97% of the
Eukaryotic Nuclear sequence pairs had less than 80%
sequence identity, while 2% or fewer of the sequence pairs
in a given phylogenetic classification had more than 95%
sequence identity (Table 1). This demonstration of significant sequence variation between sequences in the same
phylogenetic categories reveals the relative independence
of the sequences within our dataset.
RNA secondary structure prediction
The most important parameters used to control RNA secondary structure prediction by Mfold are window size
(W), percent suboptimality (P), and the inclusion or
exclusion of additional energy calculations based on coaxial stacking (efn2). The percent suboptimality variable
establishes the energy range for computed foldings. The
range is ∆Gmin to ∆Gmin + ∆∆G, where ∆∆G is P% of ∆Gmin.
The window size variable establishes the difference
between the suboptimal folds by requiring that given
folding has at least W base-pairs that are at least a distance
W from any base-pairs in the foldings already computed.
The program efn2 is used to re-compute the energetics of
each predicted structure based on coaxial stacking oppor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/105

tunities with the structure. The structures are then reordered by the modified ∆G and a new optimal structure
is selected. Previous studies by the Gutell Lab, Konings et
al.[29] and Fields et al.[30], with Mfold 2.3 used window
sizes of 10 and 20, respectively, with no efn2 re-evaluation; the selection of window size was limited by the computational resources available at the time the studies were
conducted. Mathews et al.[31] used Mfold 3.1 with a window size of 0, percent suboptimality of 20%, and efn2 reevaluation.
Each of the 1,411 sequences in our dataset was folded
with Mfold 3.1, using a window size (W) of 1, percent
suboptimality (P) of 5%, and maximum number of suboptimal foldings (MAX) of 750. The optimal, or minimum, free energy prediction and 749 suboptimal
predictions were determined after re-ordering the structure predictions by the efn2 re-computed energetics.
(Note: some sequences did not yield 749 suboptimal
structure predictions under the folding conditions used in
this study.) We configured the folding of our RNA
sequences to: 1. maximize the number of structures predicted for any given sequence, 2. densely sample the suboptimal population close to the minimum free energy
structure, since the structure with the lowest free energy
(based on nearest-neighbor energetics) is expected to be
most similar to the structure observed in nature for the
free energy minimization techniques, and 3. to include
coaxial stacking in the energy calculations with the efn2
option in Mfold 3.1.
The only difference between the run parameters from the
previous Gutell Lab studies and this study was the significantly smaller window size used in the current study. The
difference in window size affects the number of
suboptimal structures computed. Since the previous
Gutell Lab studies did not include any energy re-computation and re-ordering of predicted structures for potential
coaxial stacking, this difference would not have a significant impact on the results.
The study by Mathews et al. used different values for percent suboptimality and window size in computing suboptimal structure predictions. The net result of the difference
is that the Mathews et al. study considered suboptimal
structures with energy values further away from the minimum free energy prediction than in our study. This difference could have an impact on the results since the
Mathews et al. study may include a structure prediction for
a given sequence that is not very energetically stable (and
would be excluded from the suboptimal population in
our study) but upon efn2 re-ordering becomes the minimum energy structure. If this predicted structure was more
accurate than any other prediction in the population, the

Overall accuracy for RNA structure prediction with Mfold
3.1
Given that 97–98% of the RNA secondary structure basepairs predicted with comparative analysis were verified
with the high resolution crystal structures[28], we scored
the accuracy of the structures predicted with Mfold 3.1 by

quantifying how well the optimal (minimum energy)
structure prediction matched the comparative structure
model for each sequence in our dataset. Results were only
based on sequences folded in their entirety. We calculated
accuracy by dividing the number of comparative basepairs that were predicted exactly with Mfold by the total
number of canonical base-pairs in the comparative model
(excluding any base-pairs with IUPAC symbols other than
G,C,A or U, see Prediction Accuracy Calculations in Meth-

ods). This method for calculating accuracy was the same
as the previous Gutell Lab studies that utilized Mfold
2.3[29,30], with the exception that previous studies
excluded comparative base-pairs that were pseudoknotted
from consideration.
In contrast, base-pairs predicted with Mfold 3.1 in the
Mathews et al.[31] study were considered correct if: 1. they
matched a comparatively predicted base-pair exactly or 2.
either nucleotide of the Mfold predicted base-pair (X,Y
where X and Y are the positions of the nucleotides in the
sequence) is within one nucleotide of its comparatively
predicted position (X, Y ± 1 or X ± 1,Y). While the Mathews et al. study included a measure of the percentage of
comparative base-pairs considered pseudoknotted, we
were unsure if those base-pairs were specifically excluded
from their accuracy calculations. Based on these differences in the accuracy calculations, the Mathews et al. study
is reporting higher accuracies than our study.
Direct comparisons between the current study and the
two previous Gutell Lab studies are meaningful due to the
use of similar methodologies to calculate prediction accuracy. The only difference is the scoring method between
the studies is the exclusion of pseudoknotted base-pairs
from previous Gutell Lab studies. However, direct comparison of results between the current study and the Mathews et al. study are impacted by differences in the folding
parameters and the scoring criteria.
Raw folding accuracy
The compilation of the accuracies for each sequence and
the accuracy ranges for each RNA type and phylogenetic
grouping were summarized in Table 2. The average folding accuracies per sequence for 5S rRNA and tRNA, the
two smallest molecules in this study, were 71% and 69%
respectively. The study by Mathews et al. reported average
accuracy per sequence of 78% for 5S rRNA and 83% for
tRNA[31]. Accuracies for our sets of 5S rRNAs and tRNAs
were about 25% higher than the average accuracies for the
16S (41%) and 23S (41%) rRNAs. By comparison, the
Gutell Lab's previous studies using Mfold 2.3 reported an
average folding accuracy of 46% for 16S rRNA and 44%
for 23S rRNA[29,30]. The study by Mathews et al. reported
average accuracies (for folding complete RNA sequences)
of 51% for a dataset of 22 16S rRNAs and 57% for a dataset of 5 23S rRNAs[31]. When considering only sequences
analyzed in previous Gutell Lab studies, the average prediction accuracy with Mfold 3.1 was 45% for 16S rRNA
and 43% for 23S rRNA (Table 2).
Variation in observed folding accuracy
To gauge the variation in accuracy score for the optimal
structures predicted with Mfold, the percentages of scores
greater than 60% and less than 20%, the median accuracy

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/105

score, and the highest and lowest accuracy scores were
identified for the four RNA types (Table 2). This analysis
revealed a large range of accuracy scores with values significantly larger and smaller than the respective average
value. For our current analysis, the highest accuracy score
for the optimal structure for each RNA type was 100% for
tRNA (i.e., at least one of the predicted tRNA structures
had 100% of the base-pairs in the comparative model),
98% for 5S rRNA, 77% for 16S rRNA, and 74% for 23S
rRNA. In contrast, at least one of the optimal folds for 5S
rRNA or tRNA had a score of 0 (i.e., none of the base-pairs
in the comparative structure model were predicted with
Mfold). The lowest accuracy score was 5% for 16S rRNA
and 1% for 23S rRNA.
The median accuracy score observed for each RNA type
was 70% for tRNA, 81% for 5S rRNA, 41% for 16S rRNA
and 41% for 23S rRNA. For 16S and 23S rRNA the overwhelming majority (86% for 16S rRNA and 89% for 23S
rRNA) of optimal structures predicted with Mfold had an
accuracy score greater than 20% and less than 60%, a
trend also observed in our previous studies (Table
2)[29,30]. The majority of optimal structures predicted
for 5S rRNA (77%) had an accuracy score greater than
60% (Table 2). For the tRNA, 60% of the optimal structures were predicted with accuracy greater than 60% and
39% of the optimal structures predicted with accuracy
between 20% and 60%. The percentage of predicted structures with an accuracy score below 20% was highest for
23S rRNA (6%); increased from 1% previously[30], followed by 16S rRNA (4%); decreased from 9% previously[29], 5S rRNA (4%), and tRNA (2%) (Table 2). Our
website[36] contains a complete list of accuracy scores
and secondary structure diagrams indicating base-pairs
that were predicted correctly for all sequences in our
dataset.
Phylogenetic dependence in observed folding accuracy
Our previous thermodynamic-based folding analysis of
16S rRNAs[29] and 23S rRNAs[30] also revealed significant variation in the accuracy scores within and between
the five major phylogenetic groups. For our current 16S
rRNA dataset, the Archaeal sequences had the highest
average accuracy (62%), while the Mitochondrial
sequences had the lowest average accuracy (30%).
Between these two extremes were the Bacteria (49%),
Chloroplast (46%), and Eukaryotic Nuclear (34%)
sequences (Table 3). These results were consistent with
our previous studies, except that the Archaeal and Bacterial accuracy scores were slightly lower in our newer analysis (62% vs. 68% and 49% vs. 56%)[29]. For 23S rRNA
(Table 3), the Archaeal dataset again had the highest accuracy scores (58%), followed by the Bacterial (49%),
Eukaryotic Nuclear (42%), Chloroplast (39%), and Mitochondrion (30%). These results were also consistent with

Sequence Averages section in Methods. C, Current Study; P1, Previous Study by Gutell Lab for 16S rRNA[29]; P2, Previous Study by Gutell Lab for
23S rRNA[30]; M, Previous Study by Mathews et al.[31]. Accuracies from all previous studies are for folding complete sequences.
1 All sequences from the Mathews et al. study (M) were folded with Mfold 3.1 using a window size (W) of 0, percent suboptimality (P) of 20%,
maximum number of suboptimals (MAX) of 750 and efn2 re-evaluation and re-ordering.
2 All sequences in the current study (C) were folded with Mfold 3.1 using a window size (W) of 1, percent suboptimality (P) of 5% and efn2 reevaluation and re-ordering
3 All sequences in the previous Gutell Lab study on 16S rRNA (P ) were folded with Mfold 2.3 using a window size (W) of 10 and no efn2 re1
evaluation and re-ordering.
4 All sequences in the previous Gutell Lab study on 23S rRNA (P ) were folded with Mfold 2.3 using a window size (W) of 20 and no efn2 re2
evaluation and re-ordering.
5 Bases modified in tRNA that are subsequently unable to fit into an A form helix were constrained to be single-stranded.
6 Comparative base-pairs that are pseudoknotted were excluded from the analysis in previous Gutell Lab studies (P , P ), but were included in the
1 2
current study. The Mathews et al. study included a measure of the percentage of pseudoknotted base-pairs in comparatively predicted structures
they considered, but it was unclear if they were included in the analysis.
7 In all studies, only canonical, comparative base-pairs (excluding any base-pairs with IUPAC symbols) were considered. For both the current study
(C) and previous Gutell Lab studies (P1, P2), a predicted base-pair was considered correct only if it matched a comparative base-pair exactly. In the
Mathews et al. (M) study, a base-pair was considered if: 1. it matched a comparatively predicted base-pair exactly or 2. either nucleotide of the
Mfold predicted base-pair (X,Y where X and Y are the positions of the nucleotides in the sequence) is within one nucleotide of its comparatively
predicted position (X, Y ± 1 or X ± 1,Y).
8 Accuracy values in bold under the (C) columns for 16S and 23S rRNA represent average prediction accuracies in the current study for just the
subset of sequences considered in the previous Gutell Lab studies.[29, 30]. The following sequences were considered in previous Gutell Lab
studies, but excluded from the current study, Olisthodiscus luteus (16S rRNA, Chloroplast) and Sulfolobus solfataricus (23S rRNA, Archaea).
9 When the efn2 re-evaluation and re-ordering step was omitted from our study, the average prediction accuracy was 40 ± 13 for 16S rRNA, 40 ±
13 for 23S rRNA, 69 ± 24 for 5S rRNA, and 66 ± 24 for tRNA. For complete details, see our website[36].

Direct comparison of structure predictions by Mfold 2.3 and Mfold
3.1 for specific RNA sequences
To access specific differences between the optimal foldings from Mfold 2.3 and Mfold 3.1 for select 16S and 23S
rRNA sequences, we mapped the base-pairs predicted with
both versions of Mfold onto the comparative structure
models for each sequence. Some of the base-parings were
predicted correctly with both versions of Mfold, other
base-pairings were predicted exclusively by one version,
while a third set of base-pairings were not predicted correctly with either version. The Haloferax volcanii 16S rRNA
(Figure 1A) and Thermococcus celer 23S rRNA (Figure 1 B.1

and B.2) sequences were generally predicted very well
with both versions of Mfold. Meanwhile, Giardia intestinalis 16S (Figure 1C) and 23S (Figure 1 D.1 and D.2) rRNA
sequences were predicted poorly with both versions of
Mfold. The base-pairings in the comparative model that
were missed by both versions of Mfold were generally
longer range (see Accuracy and the RNA Contact Distance).
This relationship between the comparative structure
model for G. intestinalis 16S and 23S rRNA and the poor
prediction of this structure with both versions of Mfold
(Figure 1C, D.1 and D.2) was representative of other
sequences predicted with low accuracy by Mfold 2.3. A
total of 9 out of 10 16S sequences and 7 of the 8 23S
sequences predicted with accuracy of 30% or less with
Mfold 2.3 were still predicted with less than 30% accuracy
with Mfold 3.1 (Table 4).

values are percentages unless otherwise indicated. The determination of the accuracy for the structures predicted with Mfold is described in
the Methods section, RNA Secondary Structure Prediction and Prediction Accuracy Calculations. Genbank accession numbers are listed in parentheses
for each sequence.

Six significant results came from this section. 1) Direct
comparison of previous Gutell Lab studies with the current study (in light of the significantly larger size and
richness in sequence variation of the comparative struc-

ture database for the current study and the inclusion of
comparative base-pairs in pseudoknots) suggests that
refinements in the energy parameters and folding algorithm have not improved the accuracy of the Mfold pro-

gram between versions 2.3 and 3.1 for the set of 16S and
23S rRNAs analyzed. 2) The discrepancies between the
results of the Mathews et al. study and our study could be
due to the different methods by which the sequences were
folded and prediction accuracy calculated. 3) The accuracy
scores for the majority of the 16S and 23S rRNA secondary
structure models predicted with Mfold 2.3 and 3.1 were
between 20% and 60%, while the accuracy scores for the
majority of 5S secondary structure models predicted with
Mfold were greater than 60%. 4) Some secondary structure models predicted with Mfold 2.3 and 3.1 have
accuracy scores less than 20%. 5) The folding accuracy for
Archaeal rRNAs was the highest, followed by Bacterial,
Eukaryotic Chloroplast, Nuclear, and Mitochondrial
rRNAs. 6) Sequences that were well-predicted with Mfold
2.3 tend to be well-predicted with Mfold 3.1, and
sequences that were poorly-predicted using Mfold 2.3
tend to be poorly-predicted using Mfold 3.1.
Accuracy and the RNA contact distance
For a given protein, the average sequence separation
between pairs of amino acids involved in non-covalent
interactions is defined as the "Contact Order"[38]. Two
similar topological descriptions for non-covalent interactions in RNA are: 1) "RNA Contact Distance" is the separation on the RNA sequence between two nucleotides that
base-pair, and 2) "RNA Contact Order" is the average of
the RNA Contact Distances for a given RNA sequence. We
considered any base-pair with a contact distance of 100 nt
or less to be "short-range," a contact distance of 101–501
nt to be "mid-range," and a contact distance of 501 or
greater to be "long-range." The majority of base-pairs in
the 16S and 23S rRNA secondary structure models predicted with comparative analysis were short-range (Table
5), and previous studies have established that short-range
base-pairs are predicted more accurately than long-range
base-pairs[29,30]. In this section, we: 1) compared the
accuracies of the short-range interactions predicted with
Mfold 3.1 and Mfold 2.3, 2) compared the number of
short-, mid-, and long-range base-pairs in the comparative
models with those predicted by Mfold 3.1, and 3) determined the relationship between the base-pair prediction
accuracy and the contact distance for 16S rRNA.
Accuracy of Short-range interactions
The 496 16S rRNA comparative structure models in this
study were comprised of 191,994 canonical base-pairs. A
total of 145,058 (76%) of these base-pairs were shortrange, and 75,763 (52%) of these base-pairs were predicted correctly by Mfold 3.1 (Table 5). The average accuracy for short-range base-pairs was 50% per sequence
(Table 5) (see Per Sequence Averages in Methods for a discussion on how per sequence averages are computed). By
comparison, in the 1995 study, an average accuracy of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/105

approximately 55% per sequence was observed for shortrange base-pairs[29].
For the 23S rRNA dataset, the 256 comparative structures
contained a total of 178,958 canonical base-pairs.
134,085 (75%) of the 23S rRNA comparative, canonical
base-pairs were short-range, and 67,130 (50%) of those
base-pairs were predicted correctly by Mfold 3.1 (Table 5).
The average prediction accuracy for short-range base-pairs
was 47% per sequence (Table 5). In the 1995 study, an
average accuracy of approximately 53% per sequence was
observed for short-range base-pairs[30].
Distribution by RNA contact distance of comparative and Mfold
predicted base-pairs
A total of 223,957 base-pairs were predicted with Mfold
3.1 for our 16S rRNA dataset (Table 5). This was 31,963
more than in the 16S rRNA comparative structure models
(Table 5). Of the 223,957 base-pairs, 150,886 (67%) were
short-range and 73,071 (33%) were mid- or long-range.
Of the 150,886 short-range base-pairs, 75,763 (50%)
were correct while only 6,171 (8%) of the mid- and longrange base-pairs were correct.

A total of 29,573 long-range base-pairs were predicted
with Mfold 3.1, while the comparative models contained
only a total of 3,932 long-range base-pairs; in other
words, 13% of the total number of 16S rRNA base-pairs
predicted with Mfold 3.1 were long-range while only 2%
of the comparatively predicted base-pairs were longrange. Finally, of the 29,573 long-range base-pairs predicted by Mfold 3.1, only 193 (0.7%) were correct.
Similar results were observed for our 23S rRNA dataset
(Table 5). A total of 218,908 base-pairs were predicted by
Mfold 3.1; 137,780 (63%) were short-range, while 81,128
(37%) were mid- or long-range. 67,130 (49%) of the total
short-range base-pairs predicted were correct, but only
10,758 (13%) of the total mid- and long-range base-pairs
predicted were correct. Akin to the 16S rRNA dataset, a
total of 36,989 (17%) 23S rRNA long-range base-pairs
were predicted with Mfold 3.1, while only 7,752 (4%) of
the comparatively predicted base-pairs were long-range.
Only 1,317 of the 36,989 (4%) long-range base-pairs predicted by Mfold 3.1 were correct.
Relationship between prediction accuracy and RNA contact distance
These results prompted a more sophisticated analysis to
quantify the relationship between the accuracy of basepairs predicted with Mfold 3.1 and RNA contact distance.
Figure 2A shows the distribution of contact distances for
the 191,994 canonical base-pairs from the 496 16S rRNA
comparative structure models in this study. The frequency
of base-pairs observed decreases exponentially as contact
distance increases. Based on this observation, we divided

†All base-pairs predicted in the comparative and the Mfold optimal structure predictions including those base-pairs predicted correctly (any basepairs with IUPAC symbols other than A,G,C, or U are excluded) are grouped by RNA contact distance for 16S and 23S rRNA. RNA contact
distance is defined as the number of nucleotides intervening between the 5' and 3' halves of a base-pair. The determination of the accuracy for the
structures predicted with Mfold is described in the Methods section, RNA Secondary Structure Prediction and Prediction Accuracy Calculations.
1 %C, the percentage of comparatively predicted base-pairs; %M, the percentage of Mfold predicted base-pairs.

the 191,994 16S rRNA comparative base-pairs into seven
somewhat equally-sized bins (within one order of magnitude of one another) by considering the contact distance
values on a logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale. (see
Logarithmic Binning of Base-pairs by Contact Distance for 16S
rRNA in Methods).
The Mfold prediction accuracy for each of these bins was
determined. The prediction accuracy was 61% for basepairs in the smallest contact distance bin, 3–8, 57% for

base-pairs in the 9–19 contact distance bin, 47% for basepairs in the 20–47 bin, 46% for the 48–117 bin, 15% for
the 118–293 bin, 7% for the 294–733 bin, and 0% for the
734–1833 bin (Figure 2B). The approximately linear relationship obtained from plotting the accuracy for logarithmically-scaled bins revealed an exponential relationship
between the accuracy of Mfold and the contact distance
(Figure 2B).

A. The RNA contact distance (the number of nucleotides in the RNA sequence that are separates the 5' and 3' base-paired)
for all 191,994 base-pairs in comparative structure models is determined and plotted. B. The 191,994 comparatively predicted
base-pairs are divided into seven RNA contact distance bins (see Logarithmic Binning of Base-pairs by Contact Distance for 16S
rRNA in Methods) represented by columns. The accuracies for all base-pairs in each bin are also plotted as points.

Five significant results were observed from the analysis in
this section. 1) The accuracy of the predictions for shortrange base-pairings was similar for Mfold 3.1 and Mfold
2.3. 2) More base-pairs were predicted with Mfold for any
given sequence than in the corresponding comparative
structure model. 3) Significantly more long-range basepairs were predicted with Mfold 3.1 than in the comparative structure models. 4) The number of base-pairs in the
comparative structure models decreases exponentially as
the contact distance increases. 5) Base-pairs with a contact
distance between 3 and 8 were predicted with the highest
accuracy (61%) by Mfold, and accuracy values decreased
exponentially as the RNA contact distance increases. The
complete set of results for the prediction of 16S and 23S
rRNA short-, mid-, and long-range base-pairs with Mfold
3.1 and comparisons with the comparative structure models are provided at our website[36].
Suboptimal foldings
One of the features of the dynamic programming algorithm for free energy minimization employed by Mfold
was the ability to provide a set of suboptimal structure
predictions in addition to the minimum free energy or
optimal structure prediction[2,12]. Mathews et al.
included metrics which consider how suboptimal population may impact the prediction accuracy[31]. In this section, we introduce new metrics to continue the
examination of the suboptimal population using the 496
16S rRNA sequences in our dataset. Due to the differences
in the folding parameters and in the methods for computing accuracy, our survey of the suboptimal population
should not be directly compared with the Mathews et al.
study. Rather, our metrics provide a different perspective
from which to excogitate the importance of the suboptimal structure predictions. In particular, we considered: 1)
the amount of structural variation and the ∆∆G difference
(before efn2 based re-evaluation) for pairs of structure
predictions in the suboptimal population, 2) how many
additional unique, canonical base-pairs in the comparative models were found in the suboptimal population,
and how many incorrect base-pairs were predicted, and 3)
which comparative base-pairs were predicted correctly in
all, an intermediate number, or no structure predictions,
in the set of suboptimal foldings.
Structural variation and ∆∆G difference for structure predictions in
the suboptimal population
It has been previously noted that suboptimal structure
predictions can be very similar or very different from one
another[31]. Here we tested for a relationship between the
∆∆G (before efn2 based re-evaluation) and the structural
variation score (see Suboptimal Structural Variation Score in
Methods) for pairs of structure predictions within a suboptimal population. Higher structural variation scores
indicate that two structures compared were more different

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/105

from one another, while lower structural variation scores
indicate that two structures were more similar. We
analyzed the two 16S rRNA sequences with the highest
and lowest optimal accuracy before efn2 re-evaluation
and re-ordering in the Archaea dataset, Haloferax volcanii
and Methanospirillum hungatei. The accuracy for H. volcanii
based on the pre-efn2 minimum free energy structure prediction was 80%, while M. hungatei was predicted at 46%
accuracy (Table 6). For the suboptimal population of each
sequence, we calculated the structural variation and the
difference in free energy for all possible pairwise comparisons. The total number of unique pairwise combinations
for each sequence was 280,875, based on a total of 750
structure predictions (optimal plus 749 from the suboptimal population).
For H. volcanii, 24,621 pairs (9%) of structure predictions
had a structural variation score of 501 or higher, while
134,44 pairs (48%) had a score of 100 or less (Table 6).
Thus, the majority of the structural predictions in the
suboptimal population were more similar with one
another. The observed ∆∆G range was the same for both
categories, 0–11 kcal/mol (Table 6). More striking was the
similarity in the average ∆∆G. For those pairwise comparisons with a structural variation score of 100 or less, the
average ∆∆G was ~2.60 kcal/mol (weighted) (Table 6).
For those pairwise comparisons with a structural variation
score of 500 or higher, the average ∆∆G was 2.24 kcal/mol
(Table 6). These results were summarized graphically in
Figure 3A.
In contrast with H. volcanii, our analysis for M. hungatei
revealed that a significant number of the structure predictions were different from one another. A total of 103,462
pairs (37%) of structure predictions had a structural variation score of 501 or higher, while only 43,376 pairs
(16%) had a score of 100 or less (Table 6). The observed
∆∆G range was slightly smaller than in H. volcanii, 0–8.6
kcal/mol, while the average ∆∆G values were similar for
H. volcanii and M. hungatei. For the pairwise comparisons
with a structural variation score of 500 or higher, the average ∆∆G was 1.82 kcal/mol (Table 6). For those pairwise
comparisons with a structural variation score of 100 or
less, the average ∆∆G was ~2.05 kcal/mol (weighted)
(Table 6). These results were summarized graphically in
Figure 3B.
The most important observation from this section was
that the ∆∆G between two structure predictions appeared
to be independent of the similarity between the structure
predictions. For example, H. volcanii pairwise
comparisons with a structural variation score of 500 or
higher had an average ∆∆G of 2.24 kcal/mol, while those
pairwise comparisons where the score was 100 or less had
an average ∆∆G of ~2.60 kcal/mol (weighted). In other

†Both

sequences are 16S rRNAs. For each sequence, Mfold 3.1 predicts one optimal or minimum free energy fold and 749 suboptimal folds (750
total folds). Pairwise comparisons are grouped based on the structural variation between the two folds compared. For details on how structural
variation between two folds is calculated see Materials and Methods. The range of ∆∆G values observed is 0–11 kcal/mol for H. volcanii and 0–8.60
kcal/mol for M. hungatei., and all ∆G values are pre-efn2 re-evaluation.

words, free energy alone was not sufficient to adequately
distinguish between different structure predictions. While
the results suggest that suboptimal structural variation
score could potentially be used as an indicator of the reliability of the structure prediction by Mfold, further investigation is required to evaluate the extent of this
correlation.
Number of comparative base-pairs in the suboptimal population
For each individual 16S rRNA sequence, we identified the
set of unique comparative base-pairs present from the collection of all base-pairs predicted in the suboptimal population. Since most comparative base-pairs were observed
in more than one suboptimal structure, the total number
of unique base-pairs observed was much lower than the
total number of comparative base-pairs in the suboptimal
population. Our entire 16S rRNA dataset of 496 comparative structure models contained a total of 191,994
unique canonical, comparative base-pairs (Table 7).
81,934 of these canonical base-pairs were predicted with
Mfold 3.1 to be in a minimum free energy structure (after
efn2 re-evaluation and re-ordering), an average accuracy
of 41% per sequence (Table 7) (see Per Sequence Average in

Methods). However, when considering the entire suboptimal population of structure predictions for each
sequence, a total of 137,000 comparative canonical basepairs were predicted correctly by Mfold, an average accuracy of 71% per sequence (Table 7). This represented a
30% increase in the average number of base-pairs in the
comparative model that were predicted correctly per
sequence. The average accuracy per sequence for an
Archaeal, Bacterial, Eukaryotic Nuclear, Chloroplast, and
Mitochondrial sequence increased by 21%-41% respectively (Table 7), and the largest increase for a single
sequence (68%) was observed in the Mitochondrial dataset (Table 7).
However, these dramatic improvements in accuracy were
offset by a significant increase in the number of base-pairs
predicted incorrectly; Mfold experienced a large drop in
selectivity. The total number of unique incorrect base-pair
predictions for the 496 optimal structure predictions was
only 142,023, while the total number of unique incorrect
predictions was 2,372,305 for the 496 sets of optimal plus
749 suboptimal structure predictions, a 1,664% increase
in the number of incorrect predictions (Table 7).

∆∆G vs. Structural Variation for Pairwise Comparisons from the "Suboptimal Population". A set of 750 structure
predictions (optimal + top 749 suboptimal) are compared, resulting in a total of 280,875 pairwise comparisons. The ∆∆G (pre
efn2 re-evaluation) for two structure predictions is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between the ∆G of
each structure prediction before efn2 re-evaluation. Structural variation for two structure predictions is calculated by counting
the number of nucleotides in each structure prediction that either 1) have different pairing partners or 2) are paired in one
structure prediction and unpaired in the other structure prediction (see Suboptimal Structural Variation Score in Methods). The

†All

496 16S rRNA sequences are considered. Each sequence is folded for a population of one optimal and 749 suboptimal structure predictions.
The determination of the accuracy for the structures predicted with Mfold is described in the Methods section, RNA Secondary Structure Prediction
and Prediction Accuracy Calculations. Values are calculated by summing the number of unique base-pairs encountered for each sequence that satisfy
each particular category (any base-pairs involving IUPAC symbols other than A,G,C, or U are excluded). For example, Subopt Correct is calculated
by summing the number of unique, correctly predicted base-pairs encountered in the population of optimal plus suboptimal structure predictions
for each of the 496 16S rRNA sequences. Prediction accuracy when including base-pairs predicted correctly in suboptimal structure predictions is
also tabulated.

8 The smallest improvement in Mfold secondary structure prediction accuracy for an individual sequence when pooling base-pairs from both the

Two significant results came from this analysis. 1) When
all of the base-pairs in the suboptimal population were
included in the accuracy computation, we observed a 30%
increase in average accuracy per sequence. 2) This same
collection of suboptimal structures contained a 1,664%
overall increase in the number of base-pairs that were not
in the comparative model compared to the optimal structure prediction. In other words, a large decrease in selectivity was observed.
Distribution of base pairs throughout a suboptimal population
In the previous section, we considered the unique basepairs predicted with Mfold 3.1. As mentioned earlier, the
number of unique base-pairs is very small compared to
the total number of base-pairs predicted within the top
750 predicted structures. A total of 166,690,139 basepairs were predicted in the top 750 structure predictions
for all 496 16S rRNA sequences in our dataset (some of
the sequences did not yield 750 structure predictions with
the Mfold folding parameters used in this study, see
Counts of Suboptimal Predictions More or Less Accurate than
the Optimal Structure Prediction for Different 16S rRNA

Sequences under Additional Information at our website[36]). Of these, 59,454,137 were correct, while
107,236,002 were incorrect. In this section, we
investigated 1) the frequency at which each base-pair in
the comparative structure model appeared in the set of
750 structures (i.e., optimal + suboptimal population)
predicted with Mfold 3.1 and 2) the relationship between
this frequency and the RNA contact distance.
The frequency of prediction with Mfold 3.1 for each basepair in the comparative structure model was displayed for
two Archaeal 16S rRNA comparative structure models in
Figure 4. Given the analysis in the previous section on
suboptimal structural variation, we selected H. volcanii
and M hungatei for the panels in Figure 4. For both H. volcanii 16S rRNA (Figure 4A), and M. hungatei 16S rRNA
(Figure 4B), some comparative base-pairs were predicted
correctly in all 750 structure predictions, while others
were predicted correctly in 600–749 structure predictions,
151–599 structure predictions, and 1–150 structure
predictions. A few of the canonical base-pairs in the comparative structure model were not predicted in any of the

750 structure predictions. For H.volcanii (Figure 4A), the
majority of the base-pairs predicted correctly were present
in 600 to 749 structure predictions, with a significant
number of base-pairs predicted correctly in all 750 structure predictions. Base-pairs predicted correctly in all 750
structure predictions were almost exclusively short-range
(RNA contact distance less that 100 nt), while those predicted correctly in only 1–150 structure predictions were
almost always long-range (RNA contact distance greater
than 100 nt). This distribution was different for the M.
hungatei 16S rRNA (Figure 4B). Here, smaller numbers of
base-pairs were predicted correctly in all 750 structure predictions, and more base-pairs were predicted correctly in

only 151 to 599 of the structure predictions. Similar to H.
volcanii, the majority of base-pairs predicted correctly in
all 750 structure predictions have small RNA contact distances. For both sequences, short-range and long-range
base-pairs were observed that were predicted correctly in
zero structure predictions.
The distribution of comparatively predicted base-pairs, as
observed from up to 750 structures of the suboptimal
population, as a function of the RNA contact distance for
all 496 16S rRNA sequences in our dataset, was
summarized in Table 8. 76% of the base-pairs were shortrange (RNA contact distance less than 101 nt), 22% were

†For all 496 16S rRNA sequences, a total of 750 structure models are predicted for each sequence (one optimal and 749 suboptimal structure
predictions). Every base-pair (excluding any base-pairs involving IUPAC symbols other than A,G,C, or U) in the comparative structure model that
appears in a set of 750 structure predictions for a particular sequence is categorized by 1) the number of structure predictions in which it appears
and 2) the RNA contact distance. The four bold percentages for each of the three RNA contact distances each total 100%, and reveal the
percentage of base-pairs predicted correctly for the four frequency ranges. For example, a total of 115,471 base-pairs with an RNA contact distance
of 2–100 nt were predicted correctly. Of those base-pairs, 18% (21,049) were predicted in 750 structure predictions, 37% (42,362) were predicted
in 600–749 structure predictions, 18% (20,775) were predicted in 151–599 structure predictions, and 27% (31,285) were predicted in 1–150
structure predictions. In contrast, the three italicized percentages for each of the four frequency ranges, and the "Correct", "Never", and "Total"
categories total 100%. For example, 54,994 base-pairs were never predicted in 750 structure predictions. Of those base-pairs, 54% (29,587) have an
RNA contact distance of 2–100 nt, 42% (22,935) have an RNA contact distance of 101–500 nt, and 4% (2,472) have an RNA contact distance of
501+ nt.

mid-range (RNA contact distance of 101–500 nt), and 2%
were long-range (RNA contact distance greater than 500
nt). Of the comparative base-pairs predicted correctly in
all 750 structure predictions for each 16S rRNA sequence
in our data set, 98% were short-range, representing almost
15% (21,049 out of 137,000) of the total number of basepairs predicted correctly. In contrast, only 2% of longrange base-pairs were predicted correctly in 600 or more
structure predictions, representing <<1% (33 out of
137,000) of the total number of base-pairs predicted correctly. For comparative base-pairs predicted correctly in
600–749 structure predictions, 94% were short-range, for
151–599 structure predictions, 81% were short-range,
and for 1–150 structure predictions, 70% were shortrange. 80% (1,161 out of 1,460) of the long-range basepairs predicted correctly appeared in 150 or fewer structure predictions. A total of 54,994 canonical, comparative
base pairs were never predicted correctly, an average of
111 per 16S rRNA considered; 54% of these base pairs
were short-range, 42% were mid-range, and 4% were
long-range.
Three important observations were presented in this section. 1) For a given sequence, some of the comparative
base-pairs were predicted correctly in all 750 structures
(optimal + suboptimal population). 2) A sequence with
higher optimal accuracy contained a larger percentage of
the comparative base-pairs predicted correctly in more of
the structure predictions within the suboptimal popula-

tion, compared to a sequence with lower optimal accuracy. 3) Base-pairs predicted correctly in more suboptimal
structure predictions tend to have a smaller RNA contact
distance.

In this paper, we evaluated how well the computer program Mfold 3.1[31], with the newest nearest-neighbor
energy values, can predict the secondary structure basepairs in comparative structure models for different RNAs.
This study expands upon previous studies conducted by
this lab in four ways. First, we analyzed 5S rRNA and tRNA
sequences in addition to 16S and 23S rRNA sequences.
Second, the number of comparative structure models in
the current dataset was significantly larger, with a total of
1,411 RNAs (vs. 56 16S[29] and 72 23S[30] rRNAs studied previously), 1.5 million nucleotides and over 400,000
base-pairs, which covered all three phylogenetic domains
and exhibited significant sequence variation (Table 1).
Third, the increase in the speed of computers allowed us
to analyze the best 749 suboptimal predictions in addition to the optimal prediction. Finally, the latest version
of Mfold (version 3.1) was used. Our five most important
conclusions are summarized hereunder.
1) The comparative structure models for most sequences are
predicted with similar accuracy by Mfold 2.3 and Mfold 3.1
(Figure 1, Table 2,3,4) when the differences between the datasets for previous Gutell Lab studies and the current study (e.g.,

Page 18 of 22

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:105

sample size, minor differences in comparative models, sequence
variation within the dataset) are considered. The average
folding accuracy for our current study is 41% for complete
16S rRNA sequences and 41% for complete 23S rRNA
sequences, which is slightly less than in our earlier studies
(Table 2). While the majority of optimal structure predictions for each RNA sequence still have an accuracy score
between 20% and 60%, sequences with accuracy scores
less than 20% are also observed (Table 2,4). On average,
Archaeal and Bacterial 16S and 23S rRNA sequences still
have higher accuracy scores than Eukaryotic Nuclear,
Chloroplast, and Mitochondrial sequences (Table 3).
2) Base-pairs with smaller RNA contact distances are both
abundant in comparatively predicted structures and predicted
more accurately by both versions of Mfold, and base-pairs with
large RNA contact distances which are abundant in Mfold predicted structures only, are frequently incorrect. The prediction
accuracy for individual base-pairs decreases exponentially as
RNA contact distance increases. Figure 2A shows that the
number of comparative base-pairs decreases exponentially as the RNA contact distance increases. Using a
logarithmic scale, we show that the base-pair prediction
accuracy decreases in a linear fashion as contact distance
increases (Figure 2B), which indicates an exponential
relationship between base-pair prediction accuracy and
RNA contact distance. In addition, many more long-range
base-pairs (RNA contact distance of 501 or higher) are
predicted than found in the corresponding comparative
structure model, and the overwhelming majority of these
predicted base-pairs are incorrect (Table 5).
3) While uncertainties in the energy parameters may play a
small role, free energy (calculated in its current form) alone is
insufficient to distinguish between different structural possibilities for the same sequence. The variation between any two
structure predictions within the suboptimal population is
not correlated with the ∆∆G between those two structure
predictions (Table 6, Figure 3). We observe that two structures that are more similar with one another (structure
variation score of less than 100), and very different from
one another (structure variation score greater than 500),
have very similar ∆∆G values.
4) Without prior knowledge of the correct structure model,
analysis of the suboptimal structure models can not improve our
ability to both predict correctly the base-pairs in the secondary
structure and assemble them into a single secondary structure
model. Our analysis of the accuracy of base-pairs predicted
in the suboptimal population for our 16S rRNA dataset
reveals that the entire population contained a higher
percentage of base-pairs present in the comparative model
than the optimal structure prediction alone (Table 7).
When considering the suboptimal population, the free
energy minimization method is able to identify an aver-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/105

age of 71% or more of the comparatively predicted basepairs for a given sequence (Table 7) vs. only 41% when
considering just the optimal structure prediction. However, this same suboptimal population contains a significant increase in the number of incorrect base-pairs (Table
7). In other words, the increase in recall is offset by the
inability of Mfold to consistently identify a single
structure model containing a high percentage of comparative base-pairs.
5) The frequency of correctly predicted base-pairs in the suboptimal population is extremely variable, and base-pairs with a
smaller RNA contact distance are more likely to be observed at
a higher frequency. A qualitative analysis of Figure 4 shows
that some base-pairs in the comparative structure model
are predicted in all structure predictions within a suboptimal population, others are predicted in a subset, and yet
others are not predicted at all. 98% of base-pairs predicted
correctly in all structure predictions have an RNA contact
distance less than 101 nt, while 80% of base-pairs with an
RNA contact distance of 501 nt or more are only predicted
correctly in 150 or less structure predictions (Table 8).
Additionally, 63% (2,472 out of 3,932) of base-pairs with
an RNA contact distance of 501 nt or more are never predicted correctly in the suboptimal population (Table 8).
From our previous analysis with version 2.3 of Mfold, we
had determined that free energy minimization does not
consistently identify the correct base-pairs in the 16S and
23S rRNA comparative secondary structure models[29,30]. We arrive at the same conclusion with our
analysis of the current version 3.1 of Mfold and a significantly larger set of rRNA comparative structure models.
One explanation could be incorrect energy parameters for
multi-stem loops. Especially with longer sequences such
as 16S or 23S rRNA, many long-range base-pairs occur
along with the formation of these multi-stem loops. As we
have shown in Table 5, only 8% (6,171 out of 73,071) of
16S rRNA and 13% (10,758 out of 81,128) 23S rRNA
base-pairs predicted by Mfold with an RNA contact distance 101 or more nucleotides are correct. A more accurate characterization of the energetics of multi-stem loops
may lead to significantly better prediction accuracies.
Mathews et al. have started to address this issue using
experimental studies[39,40] and known RNA secondary
structures[31] to generate multi-stem loop initiation
parameters that can be used in energetic calculations.
We believe that another potential reason for the inaccurate structures predicted with Mfold is that kinetics plays a
role in RNA folding. Here, we suspect that nucleotide
interactions with smaller contact distances will form more
quickly, as suggested by Higgs[41], and will dominate the
number of base-paired interactions formed. Presumably,
these short-range interactions that form rapidly will be in

equilibrium with other helices with a minimum contact
distance (driven by nearest-neighbor energetics), and in
the process, prevent energetically stable helices with larger
contact distances from forming[41]. Several of our results
support these ideas: 1) In the 16S and 23S rRNA comparative structure models, 75% of the predicted base-pairings
have a contact distance of 100 or less; 2) Minimum free
energy structures for 16S rRNA (as predicted by Mfold)
have almost 10 times more long-range base-pairs than the
comparative structure models (Table 5); 3) 92% (75,763
out of 81,934) and 86% (67,130 out of 77,888) of correctly predicted base-pairs have a contact distance of 100
or less for 16S and 23S rRNA (Table 5); 4) The higher prediction accuracy observed for short RNA molecules such
as 5S rRNA or tRNA (Table 2).
Knowledge-based approaches that incorporate comparative analysis and high-resolution crystal structure data
have been successful in the prediction of protein structures[42-44]. With the recent increase in the number of
high-resolution crystal structures for different RNA molecules, it has been suggested that similar approaches could
be utilized to predict RNA structure[45]. We envision a
knowledge-based RNA folding algorithm with three fundamental facets: 1) a kinetic model of RNA folding that
includes cooperative formation of short-range base-pairs
and helices, 2) a thermodynamic component provided by
the nearest-neighbor model applied locally within different parts of the sequence, and 3) relationships between
RNA sequence and structure elements and observed
structural biases, for example tetraloops[46], AA:AG
motifs at the ends of helices[47], a bias for unpaired adenosines in the secondary structure model [48], and Lone
Pair Triloops[49]. Use of sequence-structure relationships
requires evaluation of known two- and three- dimensional RNA structures, hence the "knowledge-based" facet
of the algorithm. Some researchers in the field have begun
to adopt this approach. In Mfold 3.1, free-energy bonuses
are applied to certain classes of hairpin loops and the
energetic parameters for multi-branch loops were tuned
using comparatively predicted structures[31]. Other
researchers have developed RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms that combine energetics and comparative sequence analysis [50-52]. We believe that a tuned
algorithm of the form just described has the potential to
predict RNA secondary and eventually tertiary structure
more accurately and reliably than methods currently
available.

Methods
RNA secondary structure prediction
All 1,411 sequences in our dataset were folded using
Mfold 3.1[31]. The optional parameters used for this
study were window size (W) of 1, percent suboptimality
(P) of 5% (default value), and maximum number of pos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/105

sible foldings (MAX) of 750. The efn2 program was used
to re-compute the energetics for each predicted structure
for a given sequence. The predicted structures were then
ordered by the efn2 calculated free energies, and the minimum free energy structure reported was the lowest energy
structure after efn2 re-evaluation. Only a single structure
was selected as the minimum free energy structure, and we
did not look for other foldings with the minimum free
energy. The previous Gutell Lab studies[29,30] used window sizes (W) of 10 and 20 respectively and no efn2 reevaluation. The Mathews et al.[31] study used a window
size (W) of 0, percent suboptimality (P) of 20%, and efn2
re-evaluation.
Prediction accuracy calculations
The accuracy of an Mfold prediction for a sequence was
determined by: 1) counting the number of canonical
base-pairs (excluding any base-pairs with IUPAC symbols
other than G,C,A, or U) in the comparatively-derived secondary structure model that appeared in the Mfold 3.1
prediction, and 2) dividing that value by the total number
of canonical base-pairs in the comparatively-derived
model. Any canonical, pseudoknotted base-pairs in a
comparatively derived secondary structure model were
included in the total number of comparatively predicted
base-pairs for the given model. For example, in the 16S
rRNA from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, the Mfold 3.1 optimal
structure prediction contained 256 of the 448 comparatively predicted canonical base pairings in the A. fulgidus
comparative structure model; thus, the accuracy was 65%.
Although the comparatively-derived models included
non-canonical pairing predictions (e.g., U:U), these were
not considered in the accuracy measure, since Mfold 3.1
does not predict non-canonical pairings.
Comparative structure database
A total of 1,411 secondary structure models were determined with comparative analysis (Table 1) and used to
benchmark the accuracy of Mfold 3.1. For our tRNA secondary structure models, 30% of the sequences contained
at least one known modification that would prevent the
nucleotide from participating in A-helix base-pairs. These
modifications were not included as constraints for Mfold
to use in the secondary structure prediction. 41% (349 out
of 842) of the rRNA secondary structure models were currently available (as of January 2004) at The Comparative
RNA Web (CRW) Site[24]. The other diagrams were not
available at the CRW Site for the following reasons: 1) visual improvements were needed for the diagrams, 2) a
small number of base-pairs needed to be changed in the
structure models and 3) the sequence and/or the structure
was not publicly available, pending submission of a manuscript. The secondary structure drawing program
XRNA[53], on Sun Microsystems computers, was used to
draw the comparative structure diagrams.

Per sequence averages
Some average values for statistics computed in this study,
such as secondary structure prediction accuracy, were
calculated on a per sequence basis. A per sequence average
variant of a particular statistic was calculated by averaging
the value of the statistic for each individual sequence in
the dataset. For example, for the 16S rRNA dataset, the
overall accuracy was calculated by first determining the
accuracy of the Mfold optimal structure prediction for
each individual sequence[36]. Then, the 496 accuracy values were averaged to calculate the overall accuracy score of
41%.
Computational setup
All 1,411 sequences were folded on a computer with dual
AMD Athlon MP 1800 processors and 1GB of RAM, under
the SuSE Linux 8.0 operating system[54]. In addition, four
single-processor AMD Athlon computers (Thunderbird
1GHz processor), each with 512 MB of RAM and SuSE
Linux 8.0[54], were used to prepare sequences for folding
and to compress the results for storage. The sequences
were folded in under 48 hours using a workflow-based
system that was developed for automatically managing
the folding runs. Even after compression, the aggregate set
of folding results required over 150 GB of disk space. The
raw results were parsed and imported into a database,
managed by MySQL[55]. The database contained over
100 tables that held intermediate results from the folding
runs. Intermediate results were then retrieved, using simple SQL queries, when required to calculate final results.
Logarithmic binning of base-pairs by contact distance for
16S rRNA
Figure 2A showed that the number of comparative basepairs observed decreased exponentially as the contact
increased; therefore, logarithmic binning was required to
group the base-pairs into somewhat equally-sized bins
based on contact distance. The shortest and longest
contact distances observed in our 16S rRNA data set were
3 and 1833, respectively[36]. Therefore, the overall range
of our logarithmic scale was from log10 (3) to log10
(1833). This range was divided into equal increments to
define our contact distance bins. After evaluating many
increment sets, with the requirement that the sizes of the
bins be within one order of magnitude of one another,
seven distance bins were established (Figure 2B).

tion is paired to different positions in the respective structure models. We do not increment the score when a given
position is paired to the same position in both structure
models or is unpaired in both structure models. The
higher the structural variation score, the lower the level of
agreement between the two secondary structure models.
The structural variation score is zero for two identical
structure models. For two structure models that are different at every position the structural variation score equals
the number of nucleotides in the sequence.

Suboptimal structural variation score
The suboptimal structural variation score measures the
agreement between two different secondary structure
models for the same RNA sequence. We compute the
score by comparing the paired or unpaired state of each
nucleotide in the two structure models. We increment the
score when either a given position is unpaired in one
structure model and paired in the other or when the posi-
