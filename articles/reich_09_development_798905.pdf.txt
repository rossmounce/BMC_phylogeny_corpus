Abstract
Background: In forest ecosystems, communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) are influenced
by several biotic and abiotic factors. To understand their underlying dynamics, ECM communities
have been surveyed with ribosomal DNA-based sequencing methods. However, most identification
methods are both time-consuming and limited by the number of samples that can be treated in a
realistic time frame. As a result of ongoing implementation, the array technique has gained
throughput capacity in terms of the number of samples and the capacity for parallel identification
of several species. Thus far, although phylochips (microarrays that are used to detect species) have
been mostly developed to trace bacterial communities or groups of specific fungi, no phylochip has
been developed to carry oligonucleotides for several ectomycorrhizal species that belong to
different genera.
Results: We have constructed a custom ribosomal DNA phylochip to identify ECM fungi. Specific
oligonucleotide probes were targeted to the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions from
95 fungal species belonging to 21 ECM fungal genera. The phylochip was first validated using PCR
amplicons of reference species. Ninety-nine percent of the tested oligonucleotides generated
positive hybridisation signals with their corresponding amplicons. Cross-hybridisation was mainly
restricted at the genus level, particularly for Cortinarius and Lactarius species. The phylochip was
subsequently tested with environmental samples that were composed of ECM fungal DNA from
spruce and beech plantation fungal communities. The results were in concordance with the ITS
sequencing of morphotypes and the ITS clone library sequencing results that were obtained using
the same PCR products.
Conclusion: For the first time, we developed a custom phylochip that is specific for several
ectomycorrhizal fungi. To overcome cross-hybridisation problems, specific filter and evaluation
strategies that used spot signal intensity were applied. Evaluation of the phylochip by hybridising
environmental samples confirmed the possible application of this technology for detecting and
monitoring ectomycorrhizal fungi at specific sites in a routine and reproducible manner.

Background
Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi form a mutualistic symbiosis with tree roots and play key roles in forest ecosystems.
In return for receiving nutrients and water from the soil
via the roots, they receive carbohydrates as photosynthate
from their host plants [1]. As is the case for other soil fungal species, the composition of the ECM community is
affected by both biotic and abiotic factors; these include
climate changes, seasons, soil micro-site heterogeneity,
soil and litter quality, host tree species and forest management [2-6]. To describe in more detail the impact of environmental factors on community composition, longterm, year-round monitoring and a detailed spatial
description of the community has to be carried out. However, analyses are very often hindered by a limited sample
number and by the ephemeral or cryptic lifestyle of the
fungi [7,8].
Over the last fifteen years, PCR-based molecular methods
and DNA sequencing of nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal DNA have been used routinely to identify mycorrhizal fungi [9]. However, these methods are timeconsuming and are limited in the number of samples that
can be treated in a realistic time frame [10]. With automated molecular genotyping techniques, appropriate
DNA databases [11] and a better knowledge of ITS variability within fungal species [12], identification of fungal
taxa in environmental samples can now be expanded
from the aforementioned methods to high-throughput
molecular diagnostic tools, such as phylochips [13]. So
far, DNA arrays have been mainly used for genome-wide
transcription profiling [14,15], but also for the identification of bacterial species from complex environmental
samples [16] or for the identification of a few genera of
pathogenic fungi and Oomycetes [17,18]. Phylochips
may comprise up to several thousand probes that target
phylogenetic marker genes, such as 16S rRNA in bacteria
or the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region in fungi
[19]; indeed, the latter is one of the most widely used barcoding regions for fungi [20]. Phylochips have several
advantages over traditional approaches, including higher
specificity, cost efficiency, rapid identification and detection of target organisms, and the high numbers of samples
throughput; therefore, they are increasingly used for the
detection of bacterial and pathogenic fungi [21,22]. In the
ECM fungal ecology field, the first application of ribosomal DNA arrays was reported by Bruns and Gardes [23];
they developed a specific phylochip (on nylon membranes) to detect Suilloid fungi. Recently, this approach
has also been used for truffle identification [24]. To the
best of our knowledge, no study has reported the construction and application of an ECM fungal phylochip to
detect a large number of ECM fungal species that belong
to various genera from environmental samples.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/241

Here, we report the first application of a custom ribosomal ITS phylochip to describe the community composition of ECM fungi on roots. The phylochip carried specific
oligonucleotides for 95 fungal species that belong to 25
ECM fungal genera. The specificity of the oligonucleotides
was evaluated using ITS amplicons of known reference
species. The method was then used to describe ECM fungal communities that were obtained from 30-year-old
spruce and beech plantations. To validate the phylochip,
morphotyping and ITS sequencing of the ECM root tips,
together with sequencing of ITS clone libraries, were carried out. We discuss the pros and cons of the phylochip in
comparison to conventional approaches, and outline its
potential applications for environmental monitoring.

Results
Identification of ECM fungi from environmental samples
by morphotyping/ITS sequencing and sequencing of ITS
clone libraries
By combining morphotyping and ITS sequencing of individual ECM root tips, and sequencing of ITS clone libraries, 26 fungal species were identified on the roots of beech
and spruce trees; these included 25 ECM fungi (Table 1).
Rarefaction curves of clone library coverage nearly
reached a plateau, which indicated a near complete sampling of the ECM species in the soil samples that were
taken from under the beech and spruce. In order to detect
only one more species from spruce samples and a further
two species from beech samples, it would be necessary to
increase the sequencing effort two-fold (Additional file 1).
The species richness was very similar for the two plantations, with 13 and 16 species being associated with spruce
and beech, respectively; however, the community compositions were clearly distinct. Only three ECM taxa were
found on the root tips of both hosts: Cenococcum
geophilum, Xerocomus pruinatus and Tomentellopsis submollis
(Table 1). Sequencing of the ITS clone libraries or identification of individual ECM morphotypes revealed similar
fungal ECM profiles. Most fungi that were detected on
spruce roots by sequencing of the ITS library were also
detected by morphotyping (Additional file 2). Of these
morphotypes, nine were also supported by sequencing
the ITS of individual morphotypes (Table 1). One taxon
was only identified with morphotyping and ITS-sequencing of individual ECM morphotypes, and another was
identified only by morphotyping. Overall, 9 of 13 taxa
(69%) from the spruce roots were identified by both
molecular methods. A total of 10 of 16 taxa (62.5%) from
the beech roots were identified by both approaches.
Sequencing of the ITS clone libraries resulted in the detection of an additional two taxa. One of these was related to
an unidentified endophyte, which was difficult to identify
by morphotyping alone as it is likely leaving inside the
root tissues (Table 1). A single taxon was identified only
by the morphotyping/ITS sequencing approach, and three

taxa were identified only by morphotyping. Using ITS1F
and ITS4 primers [9] or NSI1/NLB4 [25], the ITS region
from six ECM morphotypes (Amanita rubescens, Inocybe sp
1, Lactarius sp 1 + 2, Tomentella sp 1, Tomentellopsis submollis) were not amplified. The ITS regions from four fungi
(A. rubescens, Lactarius sp 1 + 2, Tomentella sp 1) of those
six morphotypes were also not amplified using the ITS
clone library approach (Table 1). However, the use of the
second primer pair, NSl1/NLB4, enabled the molecular
biological characterisation of four morphotypes (Piloderma sp., Sebacinaceae sp., Sebacina sp. and Pezizales sp.)
that were not amplified with ITS1f/ITS4.
Specificity of designed oligonucleotides
The specificity of the 95 designed oligonucleotides (Additional file 3) was evaluated using PCR amplicons that

were generated from sporocarp tissues. PCR amplicons
mainly hybridised to the phylochip oligonucleotides
according to the expected patterns (Figure 1), and the patterns were highly reproducible in the replications conducted with each of the templates. The hybridisation
signal intensities ranged from -22 (background value) to
44,835 units. Ninety-nine percent of the oligonucleotides
tested generated positive hybridisation signals with their
matching ITS. Cross-hybridisations were mainly observed
within the Cortinarius and Lactarius species complex.
Among the Boletaceae species, a few cross-hybridisations
were observed between the species that belonged to the
Boletus and Xerocomus genera. Within the Amanita, Russula
or Tricholoma genus, rare cross-reactions occurred between
single sequences from closely related species.

Identification of ECM species in root samples using
phylochip
The ITS amplicons that were obtained from the two different environmental root samples were labelled and hybridised to the phylochips. The phylochip analysis confirmed
the presence of most of the ECM fungi that were detected
with the morphotyping, with the ITS sequencing of individual ECM tips, and with the ITS clone library
approaches that were obtained using the same PCR products (Table 2). The exceptions included the following fungal species for which corresponding oligonucleotides on
the phylochips were lacking: Pezizales sp, Atheliaceae (Piloderma) sp, Sebacina sp, Sebacinaceae sp, and unknown
endophytic species. The inability to detect these four morphotyped ECM fungal species by molecular typing sug-

gests that these morphological identifications could be
incorrect (Table 2).
Comparison of the abundance of sequences analysed by
the cloning/sequencing approach and the species detection via the phylochip approach, indicated that the phylochip has the potential to detect taxa represented by
approx. 2% of a DNA type in an environmental DNA sample. However, to assess the sensitivity of the current custom phylochip in more detail, further analyses will be
carried out.

Discussion
Many different environmental factors influence the
dynamics and the spatiotemporal structure of ECM com-

munities [26,27,5,4]. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these dynamics will require year-round
ECM monitoring at incrementally increased spatial resolutions. However, the limited number of samples that can
currently be analysed hinders the use of molecular
approaches for large-scale studies. With the ongoing
development of high-throughput molecular diagnostic
tools, such as DNA oligoarrays [19] and 454 pyrosequencing [28], larger scale surveys (in terms of both the frequency and depth of analysis) of soil fungi are now
possible. Ecologically relevant sample throughput in the
in the 100 to 1000 range is now accessible. So far, phylochips have been used for the identification of bacteria

[29], viruses [30], and a few genera of closely related fungal species [18].
In the present study, we constructed a custom ribosomal
DNA phylochip for the identification of ECM fungi that
was based on the ITS1 and ITS2 regions. One of the great
advantages of using ITS regions for oligonucleotide design
is the high number of sequences that are available in public databases [12]. Furthermore, these regions are some of
the most frequently used regions for the barcoding of
ECM fungi [20], and compared to other possible barcoding regions, they show a high specificity at the species
level [31]. We designed a total of 95 oligonucleotides,

Page 5 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:241

from which 89 were species-specific for ECM fungal species. According to regular fruiting body surveys, these 89
ECM species are the most common species to be found in
the long-term observatory of the Breuil-Chenue forest
over the last ten years [32]. The ease with which highquality species-specific oligonucleotides could be selected
(mismatch in the middle of the designed oligonucleotide,
without forming secondary structures), depended on the
fungal genera. For example, the ITS sequences of Laccaria
species showed only a few discriminative nucleotides that
were spread as single nucleotide polymorphisms over the
ITS1 and ITS2 regions. Consequently, prior to synthesis,
oligonucleotide sequences were screened in silico for the
presence of fortuitous similarities with fungal ITS
sequences for which they were not designed.
The specificity of the spotted oligonucleotides was tested
by hybridising ITS amplicons from reference species. Most
of the oligonucleotides exhibited the expected hybridisation patterns (99% of the tested probes gave a positive signal with their corresponding ITS amplicon). However,
cross-hybridisation was observed and it accumulated particularly in the genera Cortinarius or Lactarius that targeted
other species in the same genus (Figure 1). With an estimated 2,000 spp. worldwide, Cortinarius is the most species-rich genus of mushroom-forming ECM fungi. Species
delimitation within this genus is often controversial [33].
For these cryptic species, as for Lactarius or Inocybe species,
the phylogenetic separation of species is ambiguous;
indeed, most of these fungi have less than 3% intra-specific variability in the ITS region of their nuclear ribosomal DNA [34]. To keep cross-hybridisation low, we used
a two-step data filtering process that involved: (i) accepting only spots with a significantly higher signal intensity
value than the one obtained for the negative controls and,
(ii) the requirement for a positive signal for at least four of
the six replicates of one spot (see Methods). The hybridisation results were identical over the different replicates.
To test whether the current custom phylochip could be
utilised in environmental studies that sought to describe
the composition of an ECM community, ITS amplicons of
root samples taken from beech and spruce plantations
were hybridised to the array. As the focus of the current
study was the validation of the phylochip, rather than an
ecological study of the whole ECM fungal communities of
the two plantations, a total of only six soil cores were
used. The results of the phylochip were compared to the
results that were obtained from the morphotyping/ITSsequencing of individual ECM morphotypes and the
sequencing of ITS clone libraries. Provided that the corresponding oligonucleotides were included on the array, all
species that were detected by cloning-sequencing could
also be identified with the phylochip. As the corresponding oligonucleotides were lacking on the phylochip, spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/241

cies belonging to the Atheliaceae, Sebacinaceae or Pezizales
were not detected. Furthermore, the comparison of array
signal intensity with ITS sequence frequency in the ITS
clone library revealed the potential of the phylochip to
detect taxa that were represented by approx. 2% of DNA
types in the amplified DNA sample. However, the quantitative potential of this custom phylochip remains to be
further accessed as bias linked to the PCR amplification
could take place. The phylochip also detected species that
were not expected according to the results obtained from
the use of the other two approaches. This could be due to
cross-hybridisations and/or to the fact that these underrepresented species in the community could not be
detected by the other approaches as the rarefaction curves
of the ITS library sequencing method did not reach a plateau (Additional file 1).
When compared to each other, both of the other
approaches provided similar, but not identical, profiles of
the ECM communities. Approximately 70% of the species
were detected using either method individually (Table 1).
For the beech sample, three species were detected only by
morphotyping as the PCR amplification of their DNA
using ITS1F/ITS4 and/or NSI1/NLB4 primer pairs failed.
Tedersoo et al. [35] showed that PCR of ITS from several
ECM species failed using these universal fungal rDNA
primers, and they stressed the need for additional taxonspecific PCR primers to be used for comprehensive genotyping of ECM communities. One of the morphotypes
detected in the beech sample was a Lactarius species. In the
same root sample, a Pezizales species was found by ITSsequencing and cloning/sequencing; this suggests a possible co-colonisation of the ECM root tip [36]. ECM root
tips can be colonised by more than one fungal taxon, by
two different ECM species, or by one ECM species and an
endophytic or parasitic species. Typically, these species are
overlooked by the use of only morphotyping, but they can
be detected by molecular biological approaches.

Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated that identification of ECM
fungi in environmental studies is possible using a custom
phylochip. The detection of most of the species by the
phylochip was confirmed by two other widely used detection methods. Although the possible application of the
phylochip technique to other study areas is dependent on
the fungal species to be analysed, high-quality sequence
support for several temperate and boreal forest ecosystems is found in databases such as UNITE [11]. For the
next generation of phylochips, we will add additional species-specific probes or use additional marker gene regions
in the probe design to overcome the small number of
observed cross-hybridisations. In addition, we will
increase the number of specific oligonucleotides that are
spotted onto the phylochip (up to 10,000) to adapt to the

taxonomic diversity found in soils at the study sites.
Small-scale phylochips, so-called "boutique" arrays, such
as the one designed in this study, are a time-saving and
cheap approach for monitoring specific fungal species
over years and/or in several hundred of samples. At the
present time, the detection of a single species with our custom phylochip cost only one sixth of the price paid for the
cloning/sequencing approach. The upscaling of detectable
species on the phylochip (up to 10,000) will further lower
the cost (by a factor of twenty). Thus, the phylochip
approach should be an attractive method for routine,
accurate and reproducible monitoring of fungal species
on specific sites, in which a high sample throughput is
required.

Methods
Site description and root sampling
The Breuil-Chenue experimental site is a temperate forest
located in the Morvan Mountains (47°18'10"N,
4°4'44"E, France) at 650 m. The parent rock is granite and
the soil is an alocrisol that is characterised by a pH ranging
between 4 and 4.5, with moder type humus and micropodzolisation features in the upper mineral horizon. In
1976, a part of the original stand, composed mainly of
beech (90% of the stems), oak and young birch on a
homogeneous soil type, was clear-cut. Subsequently,
beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.
Karsten) were planted separately in 20 m by 20 m adjacent
stands [37].

Sampling of the root tips was performed in each stand
(beech and spruce) in October 2007. A drill was used to
obtain three soil cores (4 cm diameter × 10 cm depth)
from each of the two treatments, along 18 m transects in
the middle of each of the two plantations. The distance
between the soil cores was 6 m, and the samples were collected at distances of more than 0.5 m from the trees or
the stumps. Soil cores were immediately transported to
the laboratory in isotherm boxes and stored at 4°C.
Within five days, the roots were manually separated from
the adhering soil, gently washed, and then examined
under a stereomicroscope at 40×. Morphological typing of
all of the ECM tips (approximately 50-250 tips per sample) was performed according to Agerer [38].
ITS sequencing
An individual ECM root tip from each ECM morphotype
was selected for molecular characterisation by ITS
sequencing. The remainders of the ECM root tips in each
sample were used for ITS amplification, cloning and
sequencing, and phylochip analysis (Figure 2). The samples were conserved at -20°C. DNA was extracted from
single ECM root tips, or from the pooled ECM tips, and it
was subjected to PCR amplification to produce a specific
ITS amplicon or a heterogeneous mixture of ITS sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/241

(Figure 2), respectively. ITS amplicons from single tips
were directly sequenced. Heterogeneous mixtures of
sequences were either used to construct ITS clone libraries
or used directly for phylochip hybridisation.
The ECM roots (up to 100 mg fresh weight depending on
the sample) were freeze-dried and ground in a ball mill
MM200 (Retsch®, Haan, Germany). Ground tissue was
resuspended in 400 μl AP1 buffer from the DNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France), and the DNA was
extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Purified DNA was solubilised in dH2O (~100 ng/μl) and
stored at -80°C. The ITS was amplified as described in
Buée et al. [5], using primers ITS1F and ITS4 [9] and/or
NSI1 and NLB4 [25]. PCR products were purified using a
96-well filtration system (MultiScreen-PCR plates, Millipore Corporation, MA, USA) and sequenced with ITS1F
and/or ITS4 primers and the Genome Lab DTCS Quick
Start Kit (Beckman Coulter, Roissy CDG, France), using a
CEQ 8000XL sequencer and the CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System. ITS sequences were assembled with the
Sequencher program for Macintosh, version 4.1.2 (Gene
Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), when sharing ≥
97.0% identity. To identify the ECM fungi, BlastN was
performed using ITS sequences that are available in the
following
public
databases:
NCBI
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, UNITE http://unite.ut.ee/ and
MycorWeb http://mycor.nancy.inra.fr/. ECM fungal morphotypes were considered to be identified at the species
level when they shared ≥ 97% of their ITS region sequence
identity with a sequence in these public databases [35].
Sporocarp collection and taxonomic identification
Three times per year, during the autumnal periods of 2004
to 2007, fungal sporocarps of all epigeous fungi were surveyed at the Breuil-Chenue experimental site, and mature
fungal fruiting bodies that exhibited all the characteristics
necessary for an unequivocal identification, were collected. An expert mycologist, Jean Paul Maurice (Groupe
Mycologique Vosgien, 88300 Neufchâteau, France), used
traditional mycological methods for taxonomic determination of the sporocarps [39]. They were named according
to the new "French Reference of Mycology" http://
www.mycofrance.org. Samples were taken from the inner
cap tissue (50-100 mg) and ground using a ball mill MM
200 (Retsch). DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) following the
manufacturer's instructions. The ITS regions were amplified as described above, and they were used for hybridising the phylochips to assess the specificity of the designed
oligonucleotides (see below).
Cloning and sequencing of ITS

obtained from the bulk ECM tips of all soil cores were

The different procedures used for molecular genotyping of ECM root tips and evaluation of the phylochip.
DNA was extracted from individual ECM root tips or from pooled ECM root tips and subjected to PCR amplification to produce specific ECM ITS sequence or a heterogeneous mixture of ITS sequences, respectively. Individual ITS sequences were
directly sequenced. The heterogeneous mixture of ITS sequences (ITS clone libraries) were either separated into individual
molecules by cloning in bacterial plasmids or used directly for microarray hybridisation. The results of these three different
technical approaches were analysed and compared. In addition, to test the specificity of the spotted oligonucleotides, the phylochips were hybridised with a heterogeneous mixture of ITS sequences from identified fungal sporocarps.

pooled to obtain only two samples: one sample each for
the beech and spruce plantations. The amplified ITS fragments were cloned into Escherichia coli plasmids with the
TOPO TA Cloning Kit, using the pCR®2.1-TOPO plasmid
vector with a LacZα gene and One Shot DH5α chemically
competent Escherichia coli, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise Cedex,
France). Seventy white recombinant colonies were
selected; they were cultured overnight in LB medium and
then frozen in glycerol at -80°C. Three microlitres of these
bacterial suspensions were used directly for PCR, amplifying the inserts with M13-F (5'-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG3') and M13-R (5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3') primers.
PCR was performed using the following protocol: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of
94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C for 3 min, with
a final extension step at 72°C for 15 min. The PCR products were purified with MultiScreen HTS™ PCR filter plates
(Millipore, Molsheim, France). Sequencing was per-

formed with a CEQ 8000XL sequencer (as described
above), in which the ITS1F and ITS4 primer pairs were
used to obtain sequences with lengths of up to 600 bp that
included the ITS1 region and part of the ITS2 region.
Sequences were edited as described above. The sequences
can be accessed in public databases using the accession
number FN545289 - 545352. In addition, a rarefaction
analysis was performed to measure the proportion of the
estimated diversity that could be reached by sequence
effort using the freeware software Analytic Rarefaction version
1.3
http://www.uga.edu/strata/software/Soft
ware.html.
Design of specific ITS oligonucleotide probes
To design specific ITS oligonucleotide probes for 89 ECM
species, 368 ITS sequences of 171 ECM fungal species
(around 600 bp) were aligned with the MultAlin program
[40]. To take into account intraspecific ITS variability and
sequencing errors, several ITS sequences from a number of

different species were used for the alignment. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms and indels were identified by
manual curation. The sequences, including the ITS1, 5.8S
and ITS2 regions of the nuclear rRNA genes, were
obtained from the public databases NCBI and UNITE.
Perfectly matching oligonucleotides, 67 to 70 bases in
length, were designed for each ITS sequence within the
ITS1 or ITS2 regions. They were selected for optimal melting temperatures (Tm; 75°C ± 2.5°C) and GC content
(45-55%) using the AmplifX 1.37 software http://
ifrjr.nord.univ-mrs.fr/AmplifX. To enhance specificity,
oligonucleotides that had selective nucleotides located in
a central position were favoured. The specificity of the oligoprobes was first tested in silico by querying the oligonucleotide sequences against the UNITE and NCBI
databases. An oligonucleotide was designed as a positive
hybridisation control on the ITS region of Arabidopsis thaliana. Five additional 62- to 70-mer oligonucleotides that
matched the LSU region of the Glomeromycota were used
to measure the background signal resulting from unspecific hybridisation. To avoid cross-hybridisations with
undescribed species or cryptic species, we did not use the
ITS region of untargeted fungal groups as a negative control.
Spotting of glass slide microarray and hybridisation
conditions
The 95 species-specific oligonucleotides (see above) were
spotted; one well was spotted with only hybridisation
buffer. Solutions of species-specific oligonucleotides were
adjusted to a concentration of 600 pM and printed in triplicate by Eurofins, MWG/Operon (Cologne, Germany) on
slide arrays with an activated epoxide surface. Oligonucleotides were bound via their 5' ends on the coating layer of
the
glass
surface
(for
details,
see
http://
www.operon.com). Arrays were prehybridised using the
OpArray Pre-Hyb solution (Eurofins, MWG/Operon)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR-generated amplicons (maximal 30 ng/μl) were labelled with
Alexa Fluor® 555 dye (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France)
using the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic
Labelling System Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. After the last purification step,
labelled amplicons were concentrated with a vacuum concentrator centrifuge UNIVAPO 100 H (UNIEQUIP, Martinsried, Germany), and then dissolved in 7 μl sterile
water. The sample hybridisation procedure followed
Rinaldi et al. [41] and is fully described in sample series
GSM162978 in the GEO at NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/. Slide arrays were scanned
using a GenePix 4000 B scanner (Axon-Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at a wavelength of 532 nm
for the Alexa Fluor 555 dye. Fluorescent images were captured as TIFF files and the signal intensity was quantified
by GenePix Pro 5.0 software (Axon-Molecular Devices).

Specificity of oligonucleotides and validation of the
phylochip
To validate the specificity of the designed oligonucleotides, PCR-amplified ITS fragments from the sporocarp
tissues of known fungal species were hybridised (Figure
2). Prior to hybridisation, amplicons (5 ng/μl) from three
to six different ITS amplicons were mixed in a 1:1 ratio.
Species-specific ITS within a mix were chosen based on
the in silico tested species phylogenetic distance (minimal
30% bp differences were observed between the oligonucleotides of one species and the ITS sequences of the other
species in the mix). In total, 74 fungal species were probed
via the fungal amplicon mixes. The PCR product that was
amplified from the ITS region of Arabidopsis thaliana was
added to all amplicon mixes (at a concentration of 5 ng/
μl) as a positive hybridisation control. To test the possible
use of this custom phylochip for describing ECM community composition in environmental samples, 10 μl of the
PCR product that was amplified from the bulked ECM
root tips of beech and spruce was used (spiked with the
amplicon of Arabidopsis thaliana). Six technical replicates
were carried out for each sample (three block replications
per slide × two slides per sample). The results of the crosshybridisation test are outlined in Figure 1. The ITS-based
cladogram was constructed for all tested fungal species
using the default setting of the MEGAN software (version
3.0.2., [42]).
Array evaluation
Prior to further analyses, spots exhibiting poor quality (for
example, as a result of the presence of dust) were flagged
and excluded from the analyses. Hybridisation quality
was surveyed using the positive (oligonucleotides of Arabidopsis thaliana) and negative controls (five oligonucleotides for the Glomeromycota (non-ECM species) and the
one spot spotted with only hybridisation buffer) of each
array. Data of the array were further used when (i) signal
intensity values of the positive controls were within the
group of oligonucleotides that showed the highest signal
intensity values and (ii) the mean signal intensity value of
the negative controls were a maximal 1.5% of the signal
intensity with the highest value.

Individual spots were considered to be positive (species
present in the sample) if their signal intensity showed a
value that was five-fold higher than the averaged intensity
value for all of the negative controls. Additionally, at least
four of the six replicates per spot were required to generate
a significant positive hybridisation. The threshold factor
was fixed to five-fold after evaluation of the results of the
arrays that were hybridised with the known amplicon
mixes derived from sporocarp tissues (see "Sporocarp collection" and "Specificity of oligonucleotides"). Using a
threshold factor of "5" defined the minimal 90% of all
