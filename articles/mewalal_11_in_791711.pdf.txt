hydrolase (GH) family 10 endo-(1-4)-beta-xylanase
genes from Eucalyptus grandis and Arabidopsis
thaliana

Background
The hemicellulose xylan constitutes the major non-cellulosic component of plant secondary cell walls. It has
been shown that xylan adsorbs to cellulose fibres and
also covalently binds a carbon moiety of lignin [1,2].
Eucalyptus is an important hardwood tree genus used in
the pulp and paper industry and has potential as biofuel
feedstock. Xylan removal is expensive and uses environmentally harsh chemical treatments [3]. Previous studies
have shown that endo-(1-4)-b-xylanase enzymes belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 internally
attacks the xylan backbone resulting in shorter xylo-saccharide chains [4]. The recently sequenced Eucalyptusgrandis genome (DOE-JGI, http://www.phytozome.net)
provides a unique opportunity to analyze the native
endo-(1-4)-beta-xylanase proteins involved in xylan
modification in eucalypt fibre cell walls. Detailed knowledge of endogenous xylanolytic enzymes from Eucalyptus could facilitate the development of strategies to
enhance the processing of woody biomass for cellulose
and biofuel production. The aims of this study are to
identify xylem secondary cell wall-related endo-(1-4)-bxylanase genes in the E. grandis genome and to perform
a comparative analysis of the Eucalyptus xylanasepeptide
sequences with those of previously studied Arabidopsis
orthologs to provide a framework for assigning function
to the Eucalyptus enzymes.

Results
Analysis of the E. grandis genome sequence on Phytozome v7.0 (http://www.phytozome.net) for putative
endo-(1-4)-b-xylanase genes resulted in the identification of 18 putative GH10 family members. The expression profile of each family member was assessed (via
mRNA-Seq analysis, http://eucspresso.bi.up.ac.za/) to
identify members with putative roles in xylem secondary
cell wall metabolism. Egrandis_v1_0.001952m (designated EgrXYN1) showed the highest xylem to phloem
and xylem to leaf expression ratios of the expressed E.
grandis GH10 genes [5]. BLAST analysis (<1e-10) of the
A. thaliana genome for putative orthologs to EgrXYN1
and co-phylogenetic analysis of all 18 E. grandis
enzymes with the putative A. thaliana xylanases
revealed that AtXYN1 (At1g58370) [4] was one of the
closest putative orthologs to EgrXYN1 (Figure 1). Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of EgrXYN1
and AtXYN1 Jalview 2.6.1 revealed 68.76% identity
between the two sequences.
In silico biochemical analysis predicted that EgrXYN1
has a molecular weight of 103 kDa with a pI of 6.08.
This is very similar to AtXYN1 which is 102 kDa with a
pI of 6.1. The protein domain view in Phytozome
(http://www.phytozome.net) revealed that EgrXYN1
contains three successive N-terminal b-sandwich carbohydrate binding modules IV (at amino acid positions
53-185, 216-357 and 387-532) which were also observed
in AtXYN1. A protein motif search (http://motif.genome.jp) revealed that EgrXYN1 also contained a conserved and identical C-terminal GH10 active site
sequence “GLPIWFTELDV” at amino acid position 802812. Finally, de novo motif search of both AtXYN1 and

EgrXYN1 using MEME revealed the presence of three
additional novel C-terminal motifs present within both
enzymes (Figure 2).

Conclusion
The E. grandis genome contains 18 putative GH10
family members (at a BLAST threshold of 1e-10). One of
these, EgrXYN1 is highly preferentially expressed in
Eucalyptus xylem tissues and shows highest similarity to
AtXYN1. The similarities between AtXYN1and EgrXYN1 suggest similar biochemical properties and biological functions. Previous studies showed that AtXYN1::
eGFP localized to the cell wall providing support for its
function in cell wall modification. AtXYN1prom::GUS
constructs expressed predominately in the vascular bundles suggesting that AtXYN1 (and therefore putatively
EgrXYN1) is involved in secondary cell wall modification [4,7]. Future work will involve experimental validation of the biochemical properties and enzyme kinetics
of EgrXYN1.
