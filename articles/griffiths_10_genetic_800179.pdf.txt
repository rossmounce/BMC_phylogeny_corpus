Abstract
Background: Anadromous migratory fish species such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) have significant economic,
cultural and ecological importance, but present a complex case for management and conservation due to the range of
their migration. Atlantic salmon exist in rivers across the North Atlantic, returning to their river of birth with a high
degree of accuracy; however, despite continuing efforts and improvements in in-river conservation, they are in steep
decline across their range. Salmon from rivers across Europe migrate along similar routes, where they have, historically,
been subject to commercial netting. This mixed stock exploitation has the potential to devastate weak and declining
populations where they are exploited indiscriminately. Despite various tagging and marking studies, the effect of
marine exploitation and the marine element of the salmon lifecycle in general, remain the "black-box" of salmon
management. In a number of Pacific salmonid species and in several regions within the range of the Atlantic salmon,
genetic stock identification and mixed stock analysis have been used successfully to quantify exploitation rates and
identify the natal origins of fish outside their home waters - to date this has not been attempted for Atlantic salmon in
the south of their European range.
Results: To facilitate mixed stock analysis (MSA) of Atlantic salmon, we have produced a baseline of genetic data for
salmon populations originating from the largest rivers from Spain to northern Scotland, a region in which declines
have been particularly marked. Using 12 microsatellites, 3,730 individual fish from 57 river catchments have been
genotyped. Detailed patterns of population genetic diversity of Atlantic salmon at a sub-continent-wide level have
been evaluated, demonstrating the existence of regional genetic signatures. Critically, these appear to be independent
of more commonly recognised terrestrial biogeographical and political boundaries, allowing reporting regions to be
defined. The implications of these results on the accuracy of MSA are evaluated and indicate that the success of MSA is
not uniform across the range studied; our findings indicate large differences in the relative accuracy of stock
composition estimates and MSA apportioning across the geographical range of the study, with a much higher degree
of accuracy achieved when assigning and apportioning to populations in the south of the area studied. This result
probably reflects the more genetically distinct nature of populations in the database from Spain, northwest France and
southern England. Genetic stock identification has been undertaken and validation of the baseline microsatellite
dataset with rod-and-line and estuary net fisheries of known origin has produced realistic estimates of stock
composition at a regional scale.
Conclusions: This southern European database and supporting phylogeographic and mixed-stock analyses of net
samples provide a unique tool for Atlantic salmon research and management, in both their natal rivers and the marine
environment. However, the success of MSA is not uniform across the area studied, with large differences in the relative
accuracy of stock composition estimates and MSA apportioning, with a much higher degree of accuracy achieved
when assigning and apportioning to populations in the south of the region. More broadly, this study provides a basis
for long-term salmon management across the region and confirms the value of this genetic approach for fisheries
management of anadromous species.

Background
The ability to differentiate between stocks in fisheries is
of vital significance for management and conservation of
a fishery [1]. It is important to understand how mortality
is divided between different components of a fishery, i.e.
differential exploitation, so that fisheries can be effectively managed. Without this ability it is difficult to predict the outcomes of conservation plans, to implement
effective stock rebuilding programmes, and it is impossible to quantify the contribution and exploitation of each
stock to a fishery, such that ultimately they cannot be sustainably managed. Indiscriminate fishing may also lead to
the over-exploitation of weak or less productive stocks,
threatening their continued existence [2,3].
The case of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a prime
example of the difficulties that managers face in trying to
identify differentially exploited stocks in fisheries, as the
species is widespread and exploitation can occur sequentially, at a variety of scales (from anglers within catchments, to estuarine or coastal netting and high-seas
fisheries). This is a result of the complicated lifecycle of
Atlantic salmon, whereby individuals leave their natal rivers, which are spread along the coasts of western Europe
and the Baltic sea, and eastern North America, to migrate
to feeding grounds off the west coast of Greenland and
the Faeroe Islands [4]. They home very accurately to their
natal rivers to spawn and the high fidelity of returning
salmon provides a behavioural stock isolating mechanism, potentially allowing groups of fish to be reproductively isolated over relatively short geographic distances
[5]. The isolated nature of river catchments (and in some
cases tributaries) and the sometimes disjunctive nature of
suitable spawning/nursery habitat within them, provide
an additional, physical mechanism for stock isolation.
This appears to have generated widespread genetic differentiation within and between river systems [6-10].
For the last 200 years the Atlantic salmon has been in
decline across its native range (e.g. [11]). This can be tied
to environmental changes occurring within rivers resulting from a variety of human activities, primarily the
exploitation of land and water resources without due care
for the health of aquatic ecosystems [4]. In particular,
since the 1960s that there has been a steep fall in the
numbers of salmon returning to natal rivers to spawn [12]
and the commercial exploitation of the species, not only
in oceanic fisheries but also in coastal waters, is now
viewed as a factor of international importance in terms of
its effect on the numbers of fish in spawning runs [4].
Concern over declines have meant most fisheries are now

closed or strictly managed by, for example, restrictions on
rod catches and buy-outs or closures of near-shore commercial fisheries, but most notably curtailing the highseas fishery off west Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
However, despite fisheries regulation, in general salmon
numbers have further declined over this period suggesting that more than over-fishing is responsible for continuing declines [11]. So, it appears the reasons for
salmon declines are multi-factorial, and the actual relationship between over-exploitation and other factors
requires clarification [2,3]. Therefore, the quantification
of mortality due to exploitation has important implications in working out the reasons behind salmon declines,
as well as for current management and conservation.
Historically, tagging has generally been employed to
identify the specific population of origin for Atlantic
salmon [12]. Whilst this method provides one hundred
percent accuracy for the very small proportion (e.g. [13])
of marked individuals that are successfully recaptured, no
data are available for unmarked individuals. Genetic
markers (or tags) are innate, so have the advantage that all
fish from a population are inherently marked. Allozyme
markers have been successfully employed in studies of
Pacific salmonids for decades [14-17] and have provided
information on conserving weak stocks, allocating
catches among users and elucidating patterns of migratory behaviour in a variety of species [18]. However, levels
of variation at allozyme markers in Atlantic salmon have
generally been viewed as too low for their successful
application in fine-scale/high resolution programmes of
genetic stock identification (GSI) [7,19,20].
The development of large numbers of highly polymorphic markers (in particular, variable number repeats) has
opened the way for applications of GSI (e.g. [21]) at varying scales: catchment level [22], within country [23],
within a region, e.g. the Baltic sea [24,25], and at the continental scale [26-29]. However, the present study represents the first attempt to undertake a detailed and
stratified programme of sample collection and genotype
analysis of Atlantic salmon from across the entire southern part of the European range of the species. With this
aim, samples were collected from rivers in northern
Spain, France, England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland,
together with a number of estuary net samples, to build a
genetic baseline (the ASAP database) for salmon within
this region. The success of previous similar studies [2229] confirms the utility of a microsatellite/GSI-based
approach. Accordingly, it is anticipated that this information will provide a robust baseline with which to explore
the effects of commercial exploitation of salmon within
the region, an area which includes populations at the
southern limit of the species range (Spain and southwest
France), including those that have undergone some of the

Griffiths et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:31

steepest recorded declines [11] and those facing the
greatest threat from global warming, and possible extinction [30,31]. Not only do salmon in this area face many
potentially serious threats to their continued persistence,
they have until recently been exploited by a number of
mixed stock fisheries, including the Irish drift net fishery
(the last major offshore salmon fishery in the North
Atlantic, which was suspended in November 2006),
which have indiscriminately intercepted adults returning
to their natal rivers within the study region, including
those from weak and declining populations. However,
very few data exist with which to quantify this exploitation [32].
Accordingly, this study presents a genetic baseline for
salmon (Salmo salar) in the southern part of the eastern
Atlantic region, which can be used to identify the origins
of salmon sampled from the marine environment. The
baseline comprises genetic profiles from 117 putative
populations of predominantly juvenile (pre-migratory)
salmon sampled from 57 rivers across the region, typed
using a suite of 12 microsatellite loci. To validate this
genetic baseline, reporting regions were defined; samples
of returning adult fish collected from estuary nets or by
in-river rod-and-line fishermen were characterised and
compared with the baseline using simulations, mixed
stock analysis (MSA) and individual assignment analysis.
Finally, the importance of these reporting regions and
their associated regional genetic signatures, which appear
to be independent of more commonly recognised terrestrial biogeographical and political boundaries, and the
implications of these findings on the accuracy of MSA are
evaluated.

Methods
Baseline Sample Collection

Specimens of 3730 Atlantic salmon were collected from
57 rivers across 117 sample sites that drain into the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the English Channel, the Irish Sea
and the Bay of Biscay to form the baseline for GSI. Rivers
with a combination of the largest catchment area and
rod-catch were preferentially targeted; a full list of sample
sites included in the survey is given in Additional File 1. A
map summarising the rivers included in the study is given
in Fig. 1. The majority of sampling was carried out in
2004 and 2005 during routine juvenile salmon abundance
surveys and targeted 1+ parr, thus reducing fishing effort
and in-river disturbance to salmon. Specimens originating from northwest France are an exception; for these
samples, scales from rod-caught adult salmon were utilized. All tissues (fin clips and scales) were collected in
the field as part of routine national fisheries monitoring
and management programmes; all sampling conformed
to national agency ethical guidelines.

Test Sample Collection

Specimens of returning adult salmon, independent of the
baseline, were also analysed in order to assess the accuracy of the GSI analyses. These were collected from commercial estuary nets or rod-and-line fishermen from
seven different rivers in Spain, France, England and Wales
(for details see Table 1). For all rivers from which returning adult salmon were analysed, baseline juvenile samples
were also collected; the one exception to this was the
river Aven in northwest France, from which a sample of
adult salmon was analysed, but no sample of juvenile fish
was collected for inclusion in the baseline.
The high fidelity with which adult Atlantic salmon
return to natal rivers would suggest that the majority of
adult fish analysed in the test samples are native to the
catchments in which they were caught. As such, they provide an independent opportunity (over and above selfassignment) to assess the suitability of the baseline data
for applications of genetic stock identification; however,
allocation of a proportion of a sample to a neighbouring
river (or rivers) may also provide insight into the extent of
mixed stock exploitation occurring within these commercial catches, particularly in the case of estuary net fisheries, e.g. [14,33].
Microsatellite Analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted from scales or fin clips of
Atlantic salmon according to a chelex resin protocol [34].
Variation was determined at 12 microsatellite loci (Table
2): Ssa157a [35], SsaD 144b [35], Ssa197 [36], Ssa202 [36],
Ssa171 [36], SSsp 2210 [37], SSsp 1605 [37], SSsp 2201
[37], SSsp G7 [37], Ssa289 [38], Ssosl417 [39], Ssosl85
[39]. Genotypes were assayed through polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
with fluorescently labelled primers. PCR amplifications
were performed on reaction mixtures containing approximately 50 ng of extracted Atlantic salmon DNA template, 10 nM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 1.5-2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM
KCl, 0.1% Triton Ã-100, 0.35 Î¼M of fluorescently labeled
primers, 0.5 Units of DNA Taq Polymerase (PROMEGA,
Madison, WI, USA) and 250 Î¼M of each dNTP in a final
volume of 20 Î¼L. Full details of PCR conditions for each
microsatellite used in this study are reported in a previous publication from this research programme [40].
The microsatellite analysis was carried out in two laboratories; each used an exclusive set of six loci to keep
identification of alleles as consistent as possible (Exeter:

Ssosl417), whilst also avoiding the need for cross-laboratory standardisation. The size determination of the
labelled PCR products was performed using both a Beckman-Coulter CEQ8000 automatic DNA sequencer with
the associated fragment analysis software (Beckman-

the GENEMAPPER V.3.5 (Applied Biosystems) software
at the DNA Sequencing Unit of the University of Oviedo.
Statistical Treatment

Each baseline sample at each locus was tested for conformity to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) [41], using
GENEPOP 3.4 [42]. In tests for departures from HWE,
temporal samples were pooled unless significant differences in allele frequencies were detected in multiple loci.
Critical levels of significance for simultaneous tests were
adjusted using the sequential Bonferroni procedure for
multiple tests [43]. Scoring errors, large allele dropout
and the presence of null alleles were tested for using the
program MICRO-CHECKER [44]. Temporal stability of
frequencies (for the rivers with repeated samples: Ayr,
Exe, Itchen, Dart, Cares, Sella and Narcea) was also tested
with the program GENEPOP (Fisher's exact tests). In
subsequent analyses, temporal samples from an individual location were combined to estimate population allele
frequencies, as recommended by Waples [45].
Pair-wise and global FST values [46] and estimation of
the variance components in allele frequencies among

countries (Spain, France, England, Wales, Scotland and
Ireland), regions and years [47] were calculated using
ARLEQUIN v.3 [48]. In addition, ARLEQUIN was also
used to determine the significance of the FST values
through permutation tests (10,000 permutations were
used). The DA distance [49] was used to quantify genetic
differentiation between samples. Neighbour-joining phylograms were constructed and confidence estimates of
tree topology were calculated by bootstrap re-sampling of
loci 1000 times, utilizing the programs Powermarker [50]
and Consense (from PHYLIP 3.6 [51]). Genetic distances
between samples were also visualized using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) with Primer 6 [52] and the Bayesian
clustering package STRUCTURE v.2.3 [53] was used to
identify the most likely number of clusters (K) present in
the data set, by pursuing solutions that are, as far as possible, in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium.
Estimation of Stock Composition

The statistical package ONCOR [54]), which employs a
maximum-likelihood approach, was used to assess the
suitability and accuracy of the baseline data for MSA.
ONCOR is reportedly [54] less biased and less prone to

over-estimation of the predicted accuracy of MSA (particularly with smaller baseline sample sizes) than some
previously used software packages, e.g. SPAM [55]. The
program determines genotypic frequencies for each locus
in each baseline sample and uses the re-sampling method
of Andersson et al. [56], which is based on leave-one-out
cross validation, to simulate mixture genotypes and to
estimate their probability of occurring in the baseline
samples. The mean and variance estimates were produced from 100 simulations; the aim of this procedure
was to simulate the random variation involved in the collection of baseline and mixture samples.
Simulated single-sample mixtures

Simulations of mixtures of fish originating from a single
baseline sample (i.e. 100% from one sample) have frequently been used to assess the accuracy of MSA [22,57].
While such an approach may be unrealistic, it provides an
initial benchmark for assessment of the accuracy of the
estimates of stock composition. It also affords the opportunity to experiment with the exclusion/inclusion of
problematic data and the grouping or pooling of baseline
samples. Accordingly, simulations were first conducted
on data sets comprising 10 and 12 loci; the 10 loci data set

excluded two loci (Ssa197 and SSspG7) identified using
MICRO-CHECKER [44] as containing a large number of
null alleles (see Results section). Comparison of relative
apportionment levels between the two data sets allowed
the potential benefits (or otherwise) of including loci with
a large number of null alleles for MSA to be assessed. Secondly, simulations were run apportioning the simulated
mixtures at three levels: to individual sample sites, to
river catchments (often incorporating multiple sample
sites) and to geographically broader reporting regions
(hereafter referred to as reporting regions, which incorporate multiple catchments and reflect inter-relationships between samples). Stock proportions were
estimated for each of the individual baseline samples and
then summed within groups, catchment or region (the
allocate and sum method [58]). In addition, for catchments where multiple sites had been sampled, the allele
frequencies were also pooled across sites before running
the analysis (the pool and allocate method). While this
latter approach is generally applied only when allele frequencies between samples are similar, the approach can
also be employed - as in this study - as a potential method
of overcoming small baseline and test sample sizes

Griffiths et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:31

[20,58]. Additionally, to facilitate comparison of our data
with a wide range of previous studies, e.g. those focusing
on Pacific salmon [18], simulated mixtures were produced for each of the baseline samples with SPAM (version 3.7 [55]; see Additional File 2).
Simulated multi-sample mixtures

Two sets of four additional simulations, comprising mixtures of fish originating from a variety of baseline samples, were also evaluated. In the first set, each simulation
comprised eight baseline samples, with each sample contributing 12.5% of the overall mixture sample (Table 3). In
the second set, each simulation again comprised eight
baseline samples, but in these simulations the proportion
of each stock was unequal and ranged between 5 - 30% of
the overall mixture sample (Additional File 3). Obviously,
in a real mixed fishery sample, it is highly unlikely that
the proportions of all stocks present would be equal; thus,
together, these mixtures provide an opportunity to test
the accuracy and precision of the MSA using more complex and diverse fisheries proportions. Estimated stock
compositions were determined on the basis of both individual sample sites and at the level of reporting region,
using the 'allocate and sum' method [58].
Finally, it should be noted that simulations provide an
optimistic measure of the accuracy of estimates as they
assume that the baseline samples are representative of the
populations present in the mixed stock fisheries and,
therefore, do not take account of unrepresentative baseline sampling or omitted baseline stocks. Further validation of the baseline data set with samples of known origin
is therefore required to fully assess the validity of the
above assumption.
Test samples

Apportionment of adult samples of known origin was
conducted with both ONCOR [54] and cBAYES, of which
the latter carries out MSA using a Bayesian algorithm and
has been shown in comparison studies to out-perform
some maximum likelihood methods [24,57]. In the MSA
of test samples with cBAYES, eight 20,000-iteration
Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) of estimated stock
composition were produced; the starting values for each
chain were set at 0.90 for the different samples used to
initialize each of the chains. The estimates of stock composition from the test samples were considered to have
converged once the shrink factor was less than 1.2 for the
eight chains [21]. The last 1,000 iterations from each of
the eight 20,000-iteration Monte Carlo Markov Chains
were combined and used to obtain the mean and standard deviation of the estimated stock composition.
Individual Assignment

Both ONCOR and cBAYES were used to test the suitability of the baseline data for applications of assigning individual salmon to rivers or regions of origin. As with the

Page 7 of 27

validation of the MSA, the adult salmon samples from the
estuary nets or rod-and-line fisheries provided a set of
samples of known origin (assuming they originated from
the catchment of capture) that were assigned to catchment and region using the summed and pooled baseline
datasets. Assignment was limited to those individuals
genotyped successfully at nine or more loci and the
catchment of origin was determined as that with the
highest probability of assignment.

144b 0.9324 (0.7333-1.0000), Ssa289 0.6342 (0.40810.8787), Ssa197 0.8142 (0.4286-1.0000), Ssa202 0.8402
(0.6176-1.0000), SSsp1605 0.7741 (0.5294-1.0000),
SSsp2210 0.7590 (0.4490-1.0000), SSspG7 0.8085 (0.59181.0000), Ssosl417 0.8506 (0.6000-1.0000).
In order to assess levels of genotyping error in the dataset, 340 individuals were genotyped for a second time by
each laboratory and the proportion of alleles that were
scored inconsistently between runs was used to estimate
the error rate in the dataset. This revealed an average
allelic error rate per locus of 0.022, the lowest rate was
0.014 (associated with locus SSOSL85), and the highest
rate was 0.027 (associated with locus Ssa197).
Analysis of microsatellite data with the program
MICRO-CHECKER (at the 95% confidence level) highlighted the existence of null alleles at some loci (Additional File 5; a total of 85 significant cases were identified,
which compared to an expected value of 65 with Bonferroni corrections applied; Î± = 0.05). Over half these significant results were associated with loci Ssa197 and
SSspG7, strongly suggesting null alleles at these loci.
Accordingly, simulations were undertaken both including
and excluding these two loci. However, despite the presence of null alleles, their inclusion generally improved
overall levels of assignment/apportionment and, as the
primary objective of this study was assignment testing
and MSA, these loci were included in the final analysis.
This result is akin to the findings of Beacham et al.
[59,60], who demonstrated that inclusion of loci out of
HWE provided more accurate results in simulations. A
similar issue has been addressed previously by Carlsson
[61] who demonstrated that, while the bias in assignment
tests caused by null alleles may lead to a slight reduction
in assignment power and overestimation of FST, these factors probably do not otherwise alter the overall outcome

Four simulated mixtures are presented; each mixture comprised eight samples (each making up 12.5% of a 100% individual mixture) with
mixtures 1 and 2 including a river from each reporting region, mixture 3 a combination of southern rivers (incorporating two rivers from each
region) and mixture 4 a combination of northern rivers (incorporating two rivers from each region). Stock compositions were estimated at
the level of individual sample sites (3rd column, 'Sample Estimate') and reporting regions (4th column, 'Regional Estimate') via the allocate and
sum method. One-hundred fish were used in the mixture sample, with 100 simulations. Individual samples are identified by tributary name;
see Additional File 1 for details of latitude and longitude, collection date and individual sample size.

of assignment testing. Accordingly, affected loci may be
included in this type study.
The four samples from the Narcea, AsÃ³n, Sella (Spain)
and Nivelle (Spain/France) that were collected in 2004 all
deviated significantly from conformity to HWE at multiple loci (P < 0.05, corrected across populations) and were
excluded from further analysis. Deviation from the
expectations of HWE may be due to the steep decline in
salmon numbers that is known to have occurred in this
region, e.g. [62], and/or may be the result of past stocking
and supportive breeding practices. The remaining 16 significant departures from expectations of HWE were
spread across different samples and there was no evidence of a consistent departure from HWE at any particular marker, except locus Ssa197 that accounted for half
of the significant results (probably due to null alleles; see
above). Further testing revealed these deviations were
generally the result of a deficiency of heterozygotes

(Additional File 5). This may have been the result of
'allelic dropout', i.e. a failure to amplify the larger allele in
heterozygote individuals. While the sampling of juvenile
fish for the genetic baseline used only 1+ parr (rather
than fry), departures from the expectations of HWE may
also be due to the effects of non-representative sampling
or 'family sampling' [63,64]; in such a case, however,
affected populations should be out of HWE at all loci.
Following the removal of four of the 2004 temporal replicates from Spanish/French rivers (see above) temporal
samples were available for five sites in the baseline. Testing for temporal changes in allele frequencies at these
sites revealed that significant changes had occurred at
four loci (P < 0.05, corrected across loci) between the
2005 and 2006 samples from the Postbridge site on the
River Dart, southwest England (Additional File 1,
DART_(32) samples). However, all other temporal sam-

Griffiths et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:31
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/31

ples showed significant changes at only a single locus,
generally not the same locus across different sample sites.
Use of Genetic Distance Analysis in Defining Reporting
Regions

Pair-wise genetic distances between samples (Fig. 2) show
that even between geographically proximate samples
genetic distances remained relatively high, but the greatest genetic distances were generally observed between
samples in different regions and the lowest genetic distances between samples within catchments or regions.
Furthermore, values for bootstrap support generally only
exceeded 50% in the most radial nodes/branches in the
tree, suggesting some clustering of samples by catchment
or neighbouring catchment. There are some notable
exceptions to the generally low bootstrap values observed
towards the centre of the tree; three distinct clusters of
samples from Spain, northern France, and southern England all had bootstrap support greater than 90%. Strong
bootstrap support was also observed between samples
from the south of Ireland, which also form a distinct
group in the tree. Otherwise, while regional structure is
evident in the dendrogram (Fig. 2), particularly in the
separation of samples collected in northern versus southern areas, the low bootstrap support evident at this broad
level makes it difficult to piece together the relationships
between salmon in different areas with any certainty.
Similarly, the MDS plot (Fig. 3) demonstrates relatively
distinct clusters of samples from the southern regions,
but failed to distinguish clearly between samples collected across northern England, Scotland and Ireland (a
pattern also repeated in the STRUCTURE analysis of the
data, Additional file 6). Analysis and presentation of the
data using two complementary methods (MDS and phylogeny) allowed reporting regions to be defined; from a
practical perspective, use of two different presentation
methods allowed the samples included in each group to
be readily visualised.
Nevertheless, a lack of strong support for genetic relationships between samples of salmon in the northernmost areas analysed made the definition of reporting
regions for the MSA problematic across some parts of the
study area. Strong regional population structure is of critical significance in the application of molecular markers
to MSA as it allows the assumption to be made that the
portion of a fishery derived from un-sampled populations
will be allocated to sampled populations in the same area.
Despite some variation in the robustness of genetic differentiation between populations from across the study
area, we were able to group the baseline samples into
eight candidate reporting regions that reflected the shape
and relationships supported within the dendrogram (Fig.
2) and MDS plot (Fig. 3), and catch proportions were subsequently calculated for these eight groups. A small num-

Page 10 of 27

ber of samples, e.g. Annan and Awe, grouped outside
their geographic area or occupied an intermediate position in the tree, and their placement into reporting
regions reflects the geographic relationship between
samples.
Analysis of FST showed that 4.00% of the observed variation could be accounted for by inter-sample differences
(p < 0.00001; locus specific FST values are summarised in
Table 2). The pair-wise FST values are summarised in
Additional File 7, and demonstrate a range of 0.00
(WYE_Edw - WYE_Garth_Dulas) to 0.15 (ULLA LAXFORD_Thull). The majority of comparisons are significant at the 0.05% level (5455 out of 5778), and many of
the non-significant results occurred between samples
collected within the same catchment (38 pair-wise tests).
Quantitative estimates of hierarchical gene diversity
(Table 4) also revealed that significant genetic differentiation was present at every level tested, with the greatest
amount due to within-sample variation. The results
showed that 1.09% of genetic variation occurred between
temporal samples compared to 4.70% due to variation
between sample sites. The differentiation observed
between countries (Spain, France, England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland) accounted for 1.42% of the genetic variation, compared to 2.87% among samples within
countries, whereas 1.90% of the genetic variation
occurred between river catchments, compared with
1.54% due to differentiation among collections within
each catchment. Hierarchical analysis of the reporting
regions defined for the MSA showed that differentiation
between regions accounted for 1.99% of the genetic variation, but 2.30% was also attributed to differentiation
within regions.
Analysis of Simulated Mixtures
Analysis of Simulated Single Sample Mixtures

Analysis of simulated mixtures is generally considered
the first step in evaluating the effectiveness of a baseline
for MSA, affording the opportunity to experiment with
assembly of baseline data. Initially, the effect of removing
loci SSspG7 and Ssa197 (that were associated with null
alleles) from the baseline, was assessed by examining the
average apportionment to correct sample with simulated
single sample mixtures across all 108 samples (Table 5).
The inclusion of these loci led to an average level of
apportionment to correct sample of 0.55, compared to a
level of 0.50 when they were removed. This result is consistent with previous work suggesting loci with null
alleles may still provide useful information in MSA
[60,61]; therefore, these loci were incorporated into all
subsequent analyses.
The key assumption in using simulations is that the
baseline samples are representative of the populations
present in the mixed stock fishery samples. Accordingly,

Figure 2 Neighbour-joining dendrogram of relationships defined between samples of Atlantic salmon analysed in this study. The DA distance measure of Nei et al. [49] was used and nodes highlighted in red were supported by bootstrap support of greater than 50% in 1000 pseudoreplicates; bootstrap values for key clades are given in a box on the relevant node. Colours and labels denote reporting region as follows: northern

(light blue), southern Ireland (yellow), northern Scotland and Ireland (orange), central Scotland and eastern Ireland (black). Sample abbreviations follow those given in Additional File 1.

the analysis of simulated single sample mixtures with
ONCOR (Table 5) showed that estimates of stock composition were least accurate when samples were treated
individually in construction of the baseline. The average
allocation across all 108 samples to correct baseline sample was 0.55 and ranged between 0.05 with
KENT_Stockdate_Beck to 1.0 with LAXFORD_Thull (1
being absolutely correct). To try and improve the accuracy, multiple samples within catchments, where present,
were grouped together and the allocation to them was
summed after mixture analysis (i.e. the allocate then sum
method). This improved the estimates of stock composition and the average accuracy across all simulations
increased to 0.64 (ranging from 0.21 with
DERWENT_Dash_Beck to 1.0 with LAXFORD_Thull).

The alternative strategy - pooling of allele frequencies
from samples within the same catchment before allocation (i.e. the pool then allocate method) - also increased
the average accuracy of estimates at the level of individual
catchments to 0.70 (ranging between 0.39 for the Aulne
to 1.0 for the Avon). Part of the improvement may be
related to the reduction in the number of baseline samples that occurs when pooling samples in this way. However, the greatest improvement occurred where estimates
were summed by reporting region (as defined in Fig. 2),
which increased the average accuracy to 0.84 (ranging
from 0.49 with the DERWENT_Dash_Beck sample to 1.0
with ULLA).
Simulated single sample mixtures were also produced
for each of the baseline samples and analysed with SPAM

(v. 3.7 [55]) using data from 12 loci (Additional File 2).
Assignment success in SPAM was considerably higher
than that demonstrated in ONCOR, which is consistent
with reports that ONCOR is less prone to the over-estimation of predicted accuracy of MSA [54]. The SPAM
results are presented here to facilitate comparison of our
data and findings with a range of previously published
studies, e.g. those focusing on Pacific salmon [18] and the
west Greenland Atlantic salmon mixed stock fishery [29],
but are not discussed further in the context of this paper.

ences in the success of estimating stock compositions, the
grouping of samples into broader reporting regions
(Table 3, fourth column: 'Regional Estimate') improved
the level accuracy of in almost every case. A similar pattern of results was also demonstrated when the proportion that each contributing stock made to the mixture
was varied (Additional File 3), with a strong tendency to
underestimate the true proportion of a contributing
stock, but a much more reliable estimation at the level of
reporting region.

Analysis of Simulated Multi-Sample Mixtures

Analysis of Test Samples

Four "fishery" mixture samples were simulated, and stock
compositions were estimated at the level of individual
sample sites and reporting regions (via the allocate and
sum method). The accuracy of the estimated stock compositions for the specific samples sites were generally
quite variable (Table 3), and there was a consistent tendency to underestimate the proportion each sample contributed to the mixture (the average estimate across all
mixtures was 0.068, compared to an expected value of
0.125). It may also be noted that baseline samples from
the northern areas tended to have the lowest levels of correct apportionment in the simulations; for example, mixture 4 (Table 3), which comprised only northern samples,
produced the least accurate result (estimated stock compositions were on average 0.0683 away from the expected
value for sample site and 0.0259 away from the expected
value for reporting region). Despite these regional differ-

Presuming that the test samples consist mainly of salmon
originating from the catchments in which they were
caught, provides a challenge for MSA with samples of
known origin that are independent of the baseline. This
allows the assumptions under which simulations were
carried out to be assessed, namely that the baseline will
be representative of all populations contributing to a mixture and that stocks omitted from the baseline will have
genetic characteristics most similar to geographically
proximate samples.
MSA of Test Samples with ONCOR

The results of the MSA run on the test samples in
ONCOR are summarized in Table 6, and demonstrate a
similar pattern of accuracy to that observed in the simulations. Attempts to apportion test samples to the level of
individual river catchments were generally poor, regardless of the methods employed to pool baseline samples

The analysis of sources of variation when grouping samples according to country or reporting region utilised the entire data set,
encompassing all 108 sample sites. Remaining diversity analyses were restricted to those sampling sites with temporal replicates (10 samples)
or those catchments with multiple sites within them (87 samples). All diversity estimates were statistically significant at the p < 0.0001 level,
based on probabilities derived from 10,000 permutations.

(Table 6, columns a and c), although the "pool and allocate" approach gave consistently higher estimates of stock
contributions back to the river of capture (the average
allocation across all seven test samples was 36.98% with
the allocate and sum method and 45.69% with the pool
and allocate method). The higher accuracy of the "pool
and allocate" method probably reflects the small sample
sizes of the baseline samples.
The accuracy of the estimates improved most when
summing allocations at the level of the reporting regions
(Table 6, column e). Estimating stock composition of the
net and rod catches against a regional baseline demonstrated levels of accuracy that, except for the Dee estuary
sample, all exceeded 77% (with an average of 79.66%).

This result is particularly significant in the case of the
Aven rod-and-line sample as it is not represented in the
baseline, yet the estimate of stock composition allocates
the majority (92%) of the catch to the correct region of
capture (in this case, northern France).
MSA of Test Samples with cBAYES

The estimated allocation back to catchment and reporting region of capture for the adult samples of known origin, using cBAYES, are detailed in Table 7. The
application of the various methods for summing or pooling estimates at different hierarchical levels produced a
similar pattern of outcomes with cBAYES as those
obtained with ONCOR; however, levels of accuracy
obtained with cBAYES were generally much higher (see

The table shows: a) correct apportionment to individual sample sites within catchments with 10 loci (i.e. SSspG7 and Ssa197 removed); b) correct
apportionment to individual sample sites within catchments with 12 loci; c) the sum of the apportionment to all samples in a catchment; d) the
apportionment to catchment when all samples from within a catchment are pooled (i.e. the pool and allocate method); and e) the sum of
apportionment to all samples in a reporting region. In the case of the individual sample simulations, a 108-sample baseline was used. Onehundred fish were used in the mixture sample, with 100 simulations of the mixture and baseline samples; an apportionment score of 1 = 100%
correct. Individual samples are identified by tributary name; see Additional File 1 for details of latitude and longitude, collection date and
individual sample size.

Tables 6 and 7). The least accurate approach was to allocate and sum estimates at the level of river catchments;
on average 34% of the test samples were apportioned to
their river of capture, although the accuracy of apportionment was quite high with test samples from southern
England, France and Spain (>87%), but the MCMC failed
to converge with estimates for the other test samples and
accuracy was generally much lower. The pooling of baseline samples from the same catchment, before allocation,
dramatically increased the accuracy of estimates from the
Dee (northern Wales) and Lune (northern England) estuary net samples, where correct apportionment rose to
46% and 74%, respectively (although the shrink factors

still remained above 1.2 for the MCMC). Accordingly, the
average level of correct apportionment rose to 56.44%.
The most successful method was (as with the analysis
using ONCOR) to allocate and sum estimates at the level
of reporting regions; this approach indicated that salmon
from the region of capture made up the predominant
portion of a sample in all stock composition estimates (on
average 93.24%). Thus, the principal allocation from each
fishery sample to region of origin ranged from an apportionment of 99% of rod caught salmon from the river
Narcea to northern Spain, to an apportionment of 77% of
net caught salmon from the river Dee to the southwest
England and Wales region. These results also support the

Griffiths et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:31
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/31

outcomes from the simulations, namely that estimates of
stock composition are most accurate at the level of
reporting regions, and that pooling not summing samples
within different catchments may produce more accurate
estimates at this finer geographic scale.
The use of cBAYES for estimating the stock proportions in some of the unpooled test fishery samples proved
to be problematic as the MCMC would not converge
when apportioning to individual sample sites or catchments (estimates were inconsistent between the chains
and shrink factor exceeded 1.2, even when the chain
length was increased to 2,000,000 iterations). This problem occurred with the Tamar, Dee, Ribble and Lune adult
samples, but was not a problem with test samples from
the southern regions included in the study. Despite this
issue, the estimates of stock composition when utilizing
cBAYES were generally more accurate, i.e. were more
similar to the real composition of each test sample, than
those generated with ONCOR, and failure of the MCMC
to converge was generally not a problem for regional estimates of stock composition.
Individual Assignment of Test Samples

The results from individual assignment of the fisheries
test samples to baseline samples and catchments are
given in Table 6 for analysis in ONCOR, and Table 7 for
analysis in cBAYES. They show a similar pattern to the
results of the MSA. Firstly, the sum and allocate to each
catchment approach gave the least accurate results;
across all seven test samples, the average assignment to
river of capture was 36% in ONCOR and 56% in cBAYES.
Secondly, the sum and allocate to region approach gave
the most accurate results; average assignment was 81% in
ONCOR and 98% in cBAYES, while the proportion of test
samples assigned to catchment/region of capture was
slightly higher than that estimated with MSA. Once
again, the Bayesian method employed in cBAYES produced generally higher estimated allocation back to
catchment and reporting region of capture. Finally, the
level of assignment to catchment of capture and the average probability of assignment were much lower in fish
from fisheries samples originating in the north of the
study area compared to those sampled from the south.

Discussion
The results of this work confirm the utility of MSA for the
management and conservation of Atlantic salmon in
Europe. Using twelve microsatellite loci and baseline
samples of modest size, relatively accurate estimates of
stock composition and apportioning of both simulated
mixtures and net-fishery samples to region of origin have
been achieved. Our findings also indicate large differences in the relative accuracy of stock composition estimates and MSA apportioning across the geographical

Page 19 of 27

range of the study, with a much higher degree of accuracy
achieved when assigning and apportioning to populations
in the south of the area studied. This result probably
reflects the more genetically distinct nature of populations in the database from Spain, northwest France and
southern England.
In recent work applying MSA to chinook salmon
(Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fisheries, Beacham et al.
[60] were frequently able to demonstrate >90% accuracy
of stock composition estimation in simulated single baseline sample mixtures using SPAM. Levels of accuracy
obtained in the present study with SPAM and the reportedly more conservative ONCOR program were generally
not as high as those of Beacham et al., and probably
reflect the more extensive surveying and larger samples
sizes in the baseline data collected for chinook salmon.
Collection of samples in the current study was generally
undertaken as part of routine in-river juvenile surveying.
This helped to minimize disruption to wild Atlantic
salmon populations, but made it difficult to increase sample sizes. Nevertheless, despite the generally smaller
baseline sample sizes used in the current study, overall
accuracy of MSA apportionment in SPAM was generally
quite high (the lowest level of accuracy reported here is
78%, compared to <50% in the chinook salmon study
[60]). This may reflect the bias SPAM demonstrates with
small baseline sample size [56] and/or a greater degree of
divergence between Atlantic salmon populations [65].
The application of ONCOR to the allocation of simulated
mixtures generally produced much lower levels of accuracy. This suggests that bias in SPAM is indeed playing an
important part in inflating accuracy in the current simulations and that this baseline is likely to give robust estimates for MSA only at broader geographic levels.
Assignment success, whether in terms of individual
assignment or MSA apportionment is influenced by a
range of interacting factors, including: genetic differentiation among populations, the number of baseline populations to be assigned to, the degree of polymorphism at
each locus, the number of loci analysed, sample sizes; see
Hansen et al. [66] for full details. In particular, the relationship between degree of divergence between populations and assignment success, as found in our study, has
long been recognised and has been demonstrated in a
range of empirical studies, e.g. [67-69], and in several
landmark simulation/modelling papers [70-72]. Nevertheless, as work by Beacham et al. [60] demonstrates, the
relationship is far from simplistic and, depending on the
characteristics of the particular system being analysed,
other factors, e.g. differences in number of alleles per
locus, may be equally or indeed more important in determining accuracy of assignment.
Previous work has demonstrated the importance of
baseline sample size to MSA; Beacham et al. [60] showed

Estimates are given as the sum of apportionment to all samples within a catchment, the apportionment to catchment when all samples from
within a catchment are pooled (i.e. the 'pool and allocate' method), and as the sum of apportionment to all samples within a reporting region
(SDs of estimates are given in brackets). Individual assignment was also used to estimate the percent of test samples that would assign back to
catchment and reporting region of capture (and from those fish successfully assigned back to river of capture the average and range for the
probability of individual assignment is given in brackets). The geographical location of each test sample is given in Fig. 1; see Table 1 for full
sample details (incl. latitude and longitude).

that a rapid increase in the accuracy of estimated stock
composition occurred for samples sizes up to approximately 75 individuals. Similarly, Wood et al. [58] suggested that critical baseline sample size is around 40
individuals, below which the reliability of estimates is
greatly reduced. In the current study, the majority of
baseline sample sizes were below this recommended level
(Additional File 1); therefore, pooling baseline samples
that were collected from within the same catchment was
undertaken as a method of increasing sample sizes. Pooling samples that demonstrate significant differences in
allele frequencies could potentially introduce bias into a
baseline, altering baseline allele frequencies and causing
deviations from HWE, meaning that allele frequencies
observed may not be truly representative of a population.
For these reasons, samples were pooled within catch-

ment, but not at the level of reporting regions; this
ensured that within-catchment pooled sample sizes
exceeded the critical levels of 40 to 75 individuals. In the
current study, the effect of pooling samples generally
increased the accuracy of the results and should be considered as a potential method for overcoming issues of
small baseline samples in future studies. In part, the often
small sample sizes reflect the difficulties and practicalities
of undertaking such a wide-ranging, multi-agency study.
Without doubt this has impacted negatively on the
robustness of the database in its current form and has
almost certainly played a large part in reducing the
robustness of some of the statistical analyses undertaken;
this effect was particularly marked in more northerly
regions of the study area, where genetic differentiation
between samples is already less distinct.

Griffiths et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:31

Generation of simulated baseline mixtures using
ONCOR and SPAM facilitated comparison of our data
with similar work on other salmonid species, whilst also
allowing evaluation of strategies for pooling baseline
samples. However, the accuracy of estimates of stock
composition obtained with these two methods for a series
of test samples was well below that achieved with a Bayesian algorithm in cBAYES. This was demonstrated by the
increased allocation to catchment or region of capture in
the majority of test samples when analysed with cBAYES,
and supports similar findings in other studies [60]. The
increased accuracy demonstrated by cBAYES did not,
however, overcome the failure of the MCMC to converge
when estimating the stock composition of some of the
test samples. When attempting to apportion the test samples collected from many of the estuary nets in England
to sample site or catchment the shrink factors in cBAYES
exceeded 1.2, meaning the individual chains were producing differing estimates of stock composition. Failure
of the MCMC to converge may reflect the inclusion of
small baseline samples and/or the fact that some proximate samples were not sufficiently distinct from each
other, having been sampled from the same population at
different points in a river drainage. Issues of convergence
were not a problem when estimating stock composition
at the level of reporting regions, or with test samples from
southern areas, which also tended to correspond to a
higher levels of accuracy demonstrated in the simulations
carried out in ONCOR and SPAM. Therefore, the results
from simulations and test samples suggest there is insufficient power in the baseline data collected to date to reliably allocate fisheries samples to the level of individual
sample sites or river catchments across the entire range of
the study area.
It is interesting to note that whilst individual assignment is one of the most demanding tasks for stock identification methodologies, its application to the test samples
was generally more accurate than the MSA (the proportion of the test samples allocated to the catchment/region
of capture was generally slightly higher than that estimated in the MSA). This could reflect a bias in largely
selecting test samples from rivers included in the baseline
and may be related to the fact that in the MSA a small
portion of each test sample was allocated to every one of
the baseline samples, meaning that a 100% apportionment to a single catchment was never made. It could also
be due to the fact that, whilst some individuals would be
assigned to the catchment/region of capture, their probability of assignment could be low and this uncertainty is
not necessarily reflected in the result.
The formation of reporting regions with the baseline
samples also deserves further consideration. In the southern-most areas included in this study (i.e. Spain, France,
southern England), well-supported clusters of samples

Page 22 of 27

are present in the dendrogram (Fig. 2), the MDS plot (Fig.
3) and the STRUCTURE analysis (Additional File 6). Similarly, in southwest England, Wales and southern Ireland,
some distinct groups of samples can be identified, even if
the support for these groups is not overly robust. This
may be due in part to the somewhat discontinuous collection of samples in these regions, but still contrasts sharply
with the population structure observed in more northern
areas, where the grouping of samples into well-defined
geographic reporting regions is less obvious and bootstrap support >50% generally only occurs in the most
radial braches on the tree, i.e. supporting the grouping of
samples collected from within an individual catchment. A
lack of strong regional population structure in more
northerly areas makes the grouping of samples difficult;
specifically, the assumption that samples which are
included in the baseline can act as surrogates for populations/catchments which have not been included, is called
into question. Despite this, however, analysis of test samples from these areas was generally accurate to the
reporting regions defined in the study (Tables 6 and 7).
Failure of the MCMC to converge when running cBayes
was also chiefly associated with samples in the northern
area of the study, further emphasizing the importance of
strong regional population structuring for genetic stock
identification. At present, the regional groups identified
in this study remain tentative and should be reviewed as
and when additional data become available to supplement the baseline.
A reduced ability to evidence strong regional relationships between the northernmost samples included in the
study (Scotland, Ireland, northwest England and Wales)
could be due to a range of factors: insufficient sample
size, the number of markers employed, a long history of
stock transfers and salmon farming, or could reflect the
underlying phylogeography of salmon in the region. Previous work into the phylogeography of Atlantic salmon in
western Europe utilizing mitochondrial DNA found little
association between geographic and genetic distance outside the Baltic Sea [73] and, more recently, the area of
highest nucleotide diversity for the species has been
located around the British Isles, prompting the suggestion that the area is acting as a zone of secondary contact
between salmon recolonising from multiple glacial refugia [74]. If true, salmon from differentially colonized rivers, or even tributaries, could belong to different
phylogeographic lineages accounting for the complex
population structure around the British Isles [75,76]. The
results of analysis of salmon in other parts of their range
suggest that the phylogeographic origin of populations
can have an important effect on the patterns of genetic
diversity they exhibit [77-81]. Therefore, further study
into the phylogeography of Atlantic salmon in Britain and
Ireland could be extremely illuminating, particularly in

areas that remained ice-free during the last glacial maximum, e.g. southern England and Ireland.
The temporal stability of the markers used in the analysis also need to be addressed; this factor is of critical
importance in determining the length of time a baseline
dataset remains useful for GSI. In the samples analysed
for temporal stability in this study, none remained completely free of significant changes in allele frequencies at
all loci, although most showed only a single locus with
significant change and hierarchical analysis showed variation between sample sites was approximately four times
greater than variation between temporal samples. Moreover, in the case of the estuary net test samples from the
Dee and Tamar, where adult test fish were collected
approximately 20 years before the baseline samples, MSA
still showed predominant allocation back to the region of
capture. Overall, these results suggest that genetic information within the baseline should remain useful for many
years. Previous studies of temporal stability/instability of
allele frequencies have produced conflicting results,
including uncertainty as to how short-term stability
translates into the longer-term [9,82-85]. Nevertheless,
several detailed studies on Atlantic salmon [86-88] and
brown trout [89] suggest that in general, variation
between year classes is not significant [88] and that salmonid genetic population structure may remain stable
over at least several decades [86,87,89]. This is obviously
an area that will require further assessment and validation in the future. Accordingly, we anticipate that the
length of time data remains useful will be river- and/or
region-specific. In Pacific salmonids, where MSA has
been carried out for decades, collection of samples across
years is regarded as an important element in the on-going
validation of such programmes [22,90].
Lastly, it is important to recognise that stocking,
escapes from fish farms [91] and interchange of breeders
between rivers may also account for some of the inability
to assign individuals to a river or tributary. Repeated and
intense stock transfers are known to have diluted
between-river differentiation in Spanish rivers [92], and
levels of introgression of alleles from northern regions as
high as 11% have been reported for southern French
salmon [93]. Thus, while the primary objective of this
study was not to infer population structure, stock transfers may be an important contributing factor in reducing
population differentiation and broader-scale patterns of
isolation by distance, especially when stocking has
occurred from very remote locations. As such, some
inconsistencies and reductions in assignment power are
almost certainly attributable to this source of genetic
noise in the data. Nevertheless, while we have not formally addressed the issue of stocking within the current
study, research conducted to date [94-96] indicates that
due to a range of factors, including reduced fitness of

Page 23 of 27

stocked fish, introductions may have had little long-term
effect in terms of contributing genes to extant populations. Moreover, while debate regarding the value of conserving populations whose genetic make-up has been
compromised by introgression of alleles from stocked fish
is important, from the perspective of this study, the samples collected are the best broad representation of the
populations that currently produce marine migratory
salmon from the southern part of the species' European
range.

Conclusions
This study represents the first time that Atlantic salmon
from many of the rivers included in the baseline have
been characterized genetically, and that salmon from a
broad area across the south of the species European range
have been analysed with a consistent set of microsatellite
markers.
This sub-continental level of geographical coverage has
shown the existence of regional genetic signatures in
salmon, which appear to be independent of more commonly recognised terrestrial biogeographical and political boundaries. It is apparent that these regional genetic
differences can affect the accuracy of MSA and indicate
that to some degree the success of MSA will be region
dependent. Specifically, our findings highlight large differences in the relative accuracy of stock composition
estimates and MSA apportioning across the geographical
range of the study, with a much higher degree of accuracy
achieved when assigning and apportioning to populations
in the south of the area studied. This result probably
reflects the more genetically distinct nature of populations in the database from Spain, northwest France and
southern England.
Validation of the ASAP baseline dataset for MSA of
Atlantic salmon in southern Europe has proven successful, and the application of this methodology to rod-andline and estuary net fisheries has produced realistic estimates of stock composition at a regional scale. However,
it is clear that with the baseline assembled there is still
potential for bias in estimates of stock composition,
which can arise if a significant proportion of an analysed
fishery originates from omitted or inadequately represented stocks. Therefore, additional sampling to increase
the numbers of fish in each baseline sample, coupled with
a broadening of the baseline to include more salmon rivers, particularly for example in Scotland, Ireland and
Wales, will increase the accuracy and precision of analysis, while the inclusion of additional temporal samples
will allow questions concerning the useful lifetime of
baseline data for MSA to be addressed.
Broader questions concerning the individual origins of
migratory salmon sampled in other regions, e.g. west
Greenland [29], will require much broader baseline col-

lections (or a radical re-thinking of how to identify baseline stocks outside of the Pacific salmonid/MSA model,
perhaps through the identification of diagnostic markers
[97]). However, this work reinforces the conclusion of
Koljonen and coauthors in the Baltic Sea [24] that MSA is
possible at a broad regional scale for Atlantic salmon and
builds upon previous, more geographically limited, catchment-level applications of nuclear markers, which have
also demonstrated accurate estimates of stock composition of salmon and trout catches in Europe [22,23]. Ultimately, the findings of the present study on Atlantic
salmon, coupled with previous work on Pacific salmonids, reiterate the invaluable role of molecular markers in
fisheries management.
