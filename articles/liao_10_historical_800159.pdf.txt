Abstract
Background: Species in the varied geographic topology of Taiwan underwent obvious demographic changes during
glacial periods. Cinnamomum kanehirae has been exploited for timber and to obtain medicinal fungi for the past 100
years. Understanding anthropogenic factors influencing the demography of this species after the last glacial maximum
(LGM) is critically important for the conservation of this species.
Results: Populations of C. kanehirae were classified into four geographic regions: northwestern (NW), west-central
(WC), southwestern (SW), and southeastern (SE). In total, 113 individuals from 19 localities were sampled, and variations
in the chalcone synthase gene (Chs) intron and leafy (Lfy) intron-2 sequences of nuclear DNA were examined in order
to assess phylogeographic patterns, the timescales of demographic and evolutionary events, and recent
anthropogenic effects. In total, 210 Chs and 170 Lfy sequences, which respectively constituted 36 and 35 haplotypes,
were used for the analyses. Estimates of the migration rate (M) through time revealed a pattern of frequent gene flow
during previous and the present interglacials. The isolation-by-distance test showed that there generally was no
significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances. The level of among-region genetic differentiation
was significant when comparing eastern to western populations. However, no significant among-region genetic
differentiation was found in comparisons among the four geographic regions. Moreover, essentially no genetic
structuring was found for the three regions west of the CMR. A fit of spatial range expansion was found for pooled and
regional samples according to the non-significant values of the sum of squared deviations. Using the Bayesian skyline
plot (BSP) method, a recent bottleneck after the LGM expansion was detected in both regional and pooled samples.
Conclusions: Common haplotype distributions among geographic regions and the relatively shallow genetic
structuring displayed are the result of historical gene flows. Southward dispersals in an earlier time frame from the NW
region and in a later time frame from the SE region were inferred. The BSP analysis suggested a postglacial expansion
event. Recent trends, however, refer to a bottleneck due to human interventions observed for both pooled and
regional C. kanehirae samples.
Background
Climate change is an important factor influencing organisms' evolutionary history, especially their demographic
dynamics [1]. The Pleistocene was an era of temperature
oscillations due to cyclic glacial/interglacial events since
0.9 million years ago (Mya) [2]. Many species experienced

huge bottleneck events during glacial periods because
their growth under the prevailing unpleasant cold and
dry conditions was restricted to refugia [1,2]. Contraction
into refugia was reported for both animals [3-5] and
plants [6-8]. Although glacial events occur on a global
scale, the lowlands of southeastern Asia were not covered
with ice but were drier and colder. Thus, the climatic
changes were cyclic pluvial and interpluvial in Asia
(respectively corresponding to interglacial and glacial
periods) during the Pleistocene. According to Hewitt's [2]
speculation on the climate of tropical mountains according to several faunal studies, stable moist habitats in areas

not covered by ice provided suitable refugia for species
survival and the generation of new lineages. Glacials
changed climates in Asia and several refugia of different
species are consistently being found [9-12], which shows
that climate changes in the Pleistocene indeed affected
the demographic history of Asian species.
Taiwan is a continental island situated off the coast of
southern East Asia. The Central Mountain Ridge (CMR)
is a continuous ridge trending north-south and divides
Taiwan into eastern and western geographic areas [13].
There are more than 200 peaks exceeding 3000 m in elevation in the CMR. The varied geographical topologies of
Taiwan allowed habitats and lineages to persist through
altitudinal shifts during glacial/interglacial cycles [cf. [2]].
The remnants of glaciations at the top of some peaks
indicate the former occurrence of glaciers [14,15]. The
floristic composition of Taiwan is characterized by high
levels of endemism (40%) and species diversity [16]. Forests in middle to low elevations of Taiwan consist of evergreen broadleaf trees, including camphor (Cinnamomum
spp.), banyan (Ficus spp.), beech (Fagus spp.), etc. During
glacial periods, conifers which were distributed at high
elevations in Taiwan spread to lower elevations to escape
the ice-covered mountaintops [14,17,18], and those species originally distributed in middle and low elevations
slowly migrated to the lowlands. However, the dry environments of the lowlands during glacial periods may have
restricted the distributions of broadleaf trees and resulted
in bottleneck effects. Following glacial periods, climates
of interglacial periods were warm and moist in Taiwan,
and populations would have recovered and expanded.
Climate-dependent changes in demographics of trees in
Taiwan are evidenced by the pollen record [19] and
genetics, e.g., Michelia formosana (Magnoliaceae) [20],
Cunninghamia konishii (Cupressaceae) [21], and Quercus
(or Cyclobalanopsis) glauca (Fagaceae) [22].
In this study, we chose Cinnamomum kanehirae Hayata
(Lauraceae) as an example to explore the influence of the
evolutionary history of middle-elevation broadleaf trees.
Cinnamomum kanehirae belongs to the Cinnamomum
group of the Cinnamomeae sensu Kostermans. The Cinnamomum group shows an amphi-Pacific disjunct distribution with its sister group, the Persea group, the
disruption of boreotropical ranges of which is attributed
to Eocene-Oligocene climatic cooling. The genus Cinnamomum is considered to have originated about 35 ± 6 or
138 ± 19 Mya by estimates of the relaxed molecular clock
using outgroups with two different divergence times [23].
The genus Cinnamomum comprises approximate 250
species distributed in tropical and subtropical eastern
Asia, Australia, and the Pacific islands, and 8 of 14 Cinnamomum species in Taiwan are endemic, including C.
kanehirae. Cinnamomum kanehirae is distributed at
200~2000 m in elevation, and is mixed with C. micran-

thum in broadleaf forests throughout the island [24]. Cinnamomum kanehirae has a long lifespan, was abundant at
the beginning of the 20th century and is one of the most
valuable timber species in Taiwan [25]. The range distribution of C. kanehirae is contiguous throughout Taiwan
except the northeastern part east of the CMR [25,26]
(Figure 1). A fungus called Antrodia cinnamomea Chang
& Chou, parasitic inside the C. kanehirae trunk [27-29], is
valued as a medicine due to its antioxidant [30-32], anticancer [33], antiviral [34], and antibiotic properties [33].
In total, 46,000 trees consisting of live, dead, and root
stumps were recorded during an extensive survey of all
areas, with the exception of most of the southeastern part
of Taiwan between 1918 and 1922 [26], but it is now
extremely difficult to find a standing live tree in the wild
due to the intensive logging during 1920~1970 especially

of populations of the northwestern and southwestern
regions as well as selective cutting to obtain the medicinal
fungus in recent years.
According to an allozyme survey, C. kanehirae has a
relatively higher genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity and other parameters compared to those of other
local tree species [35]. DNA is a more-sensitive genetic
marker, and is very useful for studying the demographic
history and/or migratory footprints of species. Phylogeographic studies of several species in Taiwan consistently
point to a rapid postglacial expansion event. The suggestion of population expansion of most of those studies was
based on the "star-like" phylogeny of chloroplast DNA
(cpDNA) haplotypes due to the high frequencies of singletons [21,36,37]. Approaches based on the coalescence
theory are used to trace the evolutionary history, e.g., the
Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) analysis [38]. Plastid DNA is
commonly used for making phylogeographic inferences;
however, a strong selective sweep acting across the entire
plastid genome can reduce the genetic variation of plastid
DNA [cf. [39]]. The genetic variation of C. kanehirae estimated from cpDNA is very low (only six haplotypes in
populations and π = 0.00016 ± 0.00007) [40], and the
amounts of variation cannot reflect the long-term demographic history or the historical effective population size.
Nuclear DNA is a suitable marker to obtain more information so that the evolutionary history of C. kanehirae
can be traced in Taiwan.
In this study, the intron of chalcone synthase (Chs) and
the second intron of the Leafy gene (Lfy) of nuclear DNA
were sequenced to assess the phylogeographic structure
of C. kanehirae in Taiwan. Population genetic analyses of
C. kanehirae should provide more insights into geographic influences on migratory events (historical gene
flow and recent dispersal). Furthermore, a coherent timescale for the geologic time and demographic events as
well as climate change was established using the coalescent-based Bayesian framework. The ancestral effective
population size of C. kanehirae was estimated in order to
understand the trend of historical demography. Such a
study is vital to our understanding of the process of
demographic changes corresponding to how climate
changes affected subtropical tree species in the Pleistocene.

Methods
Plant materials and DNA amplification

In total, 113 individuals originating from 19 populations
of C. kanehirae of Taiwan were collected from a scion
garden at the Liukuei Research Center, Taiwan Forestry
Research Institute (TFRI), southwestern Taiwan (Table 1,
Figure 1). This scion garden was set up in 1995 to house
intraspecific variations of C. kanehirae. Sample sizes of
each population range from 3 to 16 individuals. Young

developed leaves were collected from this garden, preserved on silica gel, and carried back to the laboratory for
DNA extraction. Total DNA was extracted from groundup leaf powder according to a modified cetyltrimethyl
ammonium bromide (CTAB) procedure [41]. DNA was
precipitated with ethanol and after washing with 70%
ethanol, was dissolved in 200 μL TE buffer (pH 8.0) and
stored at -20°C. The DNA concentration was determined
for each sample using the GeneQuant II RNA/DNA Calculator (Amersham Biosciences, Taipei, Taiwan).
Primers, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequencing

PCRs were performed with universal primers for the Chs
first intron (CHSx1F and CHSx2RN) [42] and the Lfy second intron (Mk.LFY-1n and Mk.LFY-2n) [43]. Amplifications were performed in a DNA programmable thermal
cycler (PTC-100, MJ Research, Watertown, MA, USA)
under the following protocol: initial denaturation at 94°C
for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s of
annealing at 52 or 48°C (Chs and Lfy, respectively), and 2
min at 72°C, followed by a subsequent 7-min final extension at 72°C. The PCR mixture (50 μL) contained 50 mM
KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.3), 100 μM dNTPs, 0.2 μM of the primer, 20 ng of template DNA, 1 μg RNase, and 0.5 U Taq polymerase
(Amersham Biosciences). Amplification products were
run on 1% agarose gels, purified with a QiaGen purification kit (Taipei, Taiwan), and sequenced using both forward and reverse reactions with a Taq BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Kit and a model ABI373A automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
This was applied to sequences of homozygotes or
sequences containing one polymorphic site. Heterozygotes were visualized as "double peaks" at polymorphic
sites in the chromatogram. The identity of the two haplotypes within a heterozygote was inferred through haplotype subtraction [44], which deduces haplotypes by a
comparison of heterozygote sequences to haplotypes
commonly observed in the global sample. When the
chromatogram quality did not permit this procedure,
PCR products were cloned using a yT&A vector (Yeastern Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three clones were sequenced for each
individual when sequences contained two or more polymorphic sites and/or an unpaired indel (an indel of a different length). The two sequences of a heterozygote were
separated by comparing sequences of the PCR product
and cloned sequence. Fortunately, no sequence containing more than one indel was found in the length of Chs
and Lfy used in this study. Because the Taq polymerase
error was estimated to be as high as 0.1% [45] or even
higher, sequences containing only one polymorphic site
were considered to be produced by a Taq error and were
excluded from the analysis. All haplotype sequences were

deposited in the NCBI nucleotide sequence database
under the following accession numbers: FJ858218~
FJ858253 (Chs) and GQ260573~GQ260607 (Lfy).
DNA sequence analyses

Sequence alignments were performed with Clustal X [46]
and manually edited using BioEdit vers. 7.0.9 [47]. After
sequence alignment, indels were treated as the fifth character when calculating the indices of genetic diversity.
The nucleotide diversity (π), haplotype diversity (Hd),
and θ estimated by segregating sites (S) were calculated
using DnaSP vers. 5.0 [48].
Population structure

Populations of C. kanehirae were formerly classified into
four geographic regions, northwestern (NW), west-central (WC), southwestern (SW), and southeastern (SE),
according to their geographic distributions (Figure 1)
[35]. In addition, the CMR is considered to be a barrier to
gene flow, and the structures of populations distributed
in eastern and western Taiwan were also examined. The
haplotype network was reconstructed with the algorithm
of statistical parsimony using TCS vers. 1.21 [49]. The
long-fragment indel of Chs sequences was treated as a
one-mutation step and recoded. An analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA) was performed with Arlequin vers.
3.11 [50] in order to examine the components of genetic
variation and the population structure.
Genetic differentiation between populations (pairwise
FST) was calculated by Arlequin [50] based on Wright's
[51] equation. To examine the influence of geographic
barriers on levels of gene flow, the isolation-by-distance
(IBD) model was used. If the stepping-stone dispersal
model was tenable for C. kanehirae (and then the reinforcement of the geographic distance was necessary when
estimating using MIGRATE), the IBD pattern was
assumed. The IBD model was examined by the Mantel
test (FST vs. geographic or altitudinal slope distance) to
analyze the geographic effect on the genetic distribution.
A reduced major axis (RMA) regression [52] was used to
calculate the slope for the IBD test. Hellberg [52] indicated that the RAM regression is superior to the ordinary
least squares regression for the IBD test based on simulation data. The IBD test considering both linear geographic distance and altitudinal slope was performed
with the web-based computer program, IBDWS vers.
3.15 [53] (available at http://ibdws.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/).
Intralocus recombination

In the following analyses, all sites within studied loci were
assumed to share the same genealogical history. However,
recombination is believed to be common in nuclear loci
and to influence the outcome of genealogically based
analyses [54]. Therefore, we assessed recombination

Page 5 of 17

events with the "four-gamete test" using DnaSP vers. 5.0
[48]. Although this test only evaluates the minimum
number of intralocus recombination events, it is sensitive
to the presence of recombinations. When the test of the
dataset of each locus (Chs and Lfy) suggested an intralocus recombination, we discarded the sites within the
recombination block and retained the longest possible
contiguous unrecombined sequence for subsequent analyses.
Migration rate through time

Because the incomplete migration-drift equilibrium was
inferred based on the IBD results, the gene flow (Nm)
estimated by the reciprocal of pairwise FST by Wright's
[51] equation under the assumption of the migrationdrift equilibrium may have been incorrect. Hence, varying degrees of the migration rate through time had to be
considered. We jointly estimated all immigration and
emigration rates by the Metropolis-coupled Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) strategy in the
MIGRATE program vers. 3.0 [55]. Because the Mantel
test revealed essentially no correlations between genetic
and geographic distances (see "Results"), the assumption
of an identical migration potential was adopted in the
MIGRATE algorithm. The prior distributions of uniform
θ and equal migration rates were incorporated into the
Bayesian approach in the MIGRATE algorithm. FST estimates were used as starting values for the initial analysis.
For all other analyses, parameters at the end of the previous run were used as starting values for the next run until
results converged at approximately the same values. We
used settings of three long chains with 5 × 106 sampled
and 5 × 103 recorded genealogies and discarded 25% of
them at the beginning of a chain. Multiple long chains
were combined for estimates. Adaptive heating was
applied with temperature specifications of 1.0, 1.2, 1.5,
and 3.0. Three replicates of the dataset were analyzed to
calculate the average and confidence intervals. Because
gene flow between populations estimated by pairwise M,
which indicates the migration rate over the mutation rate,
revealed confusing results (data not shown), four geographic regions based on the determination of Lin et al.
[35] were used for the reanalysis.
Inferring the historical demography

Signatures of population demographic changes (bottlenecks or expansions) in C. kanehirae were first examined
by Tajima's D [56] and Fu's Fs [57] statistics using DnaSP
5.0 [48] to see whether C. kanehirae data conformed to
expectations of neutrality or departed from neutrality
due to factors such as a population bottleneck or expansion. The examination of deviation from neutrality by
both D and Fs indices was based on 1000 coalescent simulations with consideration of the recombination rate

Liao et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:124
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/124

using DnaSP. Expectations of these statistics are nearly
zero in a constant-size population; significant negative
values indicate a sudden expansion in population size,
whereas significant positive values indicate processes
such as a population subdivision or recent population
bottlenecks. Second, demographic changes in C. kanehirae were also examined by calculating the raggedness
index of the observed mismatch distribution for each of
the populations according to the population expansion
model implemented in Arlequin 3.1 [50]. This measure
quantifies the smoothness of the observed mismatch distribution. Small raggedness values represent a population
which has experienced sudden expansion whereas higher
values of the raggedness index suggest stationary or bottlenecked populations [58,59]. Third, the demographic
history of whether C. kanehirae underwent a range
expansion was investigated by the spatial expansion
model in Arlequin [50,60-62]. We employed parametric
bootstrapping (1000 replicates) as implemented in Arlequin to test the goodness-of-fit of the observed mismatch
distribution to that expected under the spatial expansion
model using the sum of squared deviations (SSD) statistic
for regional and pooled samples. A significant SSD value
is taken as evidence of departure from the estimated
demographic model of spatial expansion in subdivided
populations [60,62] using Arlequin [50]. The model of
spatial expansion assumes that subdivided populations
expanded their distribution range and increased the total
number of individuals [60,61]. It estimates tau (τ), the
demographic expansion factor, with 95% confidence
intervals, and the mutation parameter, θ, as well as the
number of migrants (M). This least-squares estimation of
τ is reliable but was found to be unreliable for estimating
the migration parameter, M [63]. Therefore, we took the
M estimate of > 1 together with a non-significant SSD
value as evidence of spatial expansion. The time at which
the expansion event took place was dated following the
expression, t = τ/2 μk, where τ is the estimated number of
generations since the expansion, μ is the mutation rate
per site per generation, and k is the sequence length. A
mutation rate of 1.5% per 106 years per site was used for
both Chs [64] and Lfy. We assumed a mean generation
time of 20 years for C. kanehirae in converting the time to
expansion to years.
Patterns of historical demography can also be inferred
from estimates of the effective population size over time
using the BSP method [38] as implemented in BEAST
vers. 1.4.8 [65] for estimating fluctuations in the effective
population size. This method estimates a posterior distribution of effective population sizes through time via
MCMC procedures, by moving backward until the time
of the most recent common ancestor is reached. The constant population size coalescent model was the basic
assumption used for this approach. A HKY model

together with among-site rate heterogeneity across all
branches but assuming a strict molecular clock was used
for this calculation. Markov chains were run for 2.5 × 107
generations and were sampled every 1000 generations,
with the first 2500 samples discarded as burn-in. Three
replicates were run and combined to separately analyze
the Chs and Lfy datasets. Other parameters were set as
default values. TRACER vers. 1.4 [66] was used to visualize the posterior probabilities of the Markov chain statistics and to calculate a statistical summary of the genetic
parameters.

Results
Genetic diversity

In total, 82 of 113 samples of Chs (72.5%) and 41 of 94
samples of Lfy (43.6%) were heterozygotes. Although all
226 alleles of Chs and 188 alleles of Lfy were unambiguously identified, 16 and 18 of them, respectively, were
probably derived from Taq errors and were thus excluded
from further analysis. PCR amplification resulted in 637
and 657 bp of the Chs gene sequence spanning exon 1
(1~18 bp), intron 1 (19~594 bp or a 20-bp indel), and
exon 2 (595~637 bp), and 741 bp of the Lfy gene sequence
spanning exon 2 (1~75 bp), intron 2 (76~692 bp), and
exon 3 (693~741 bp). All Chs variations occurred within
the region of the intron. In aligned Lfy sequences, two
variable sites were found within exon 2, 29 variable sites
were found within intron 2, and three variable sites were
found within exon 3 (Additional file 1). The aligned
lengths of 210 Chs sequences were 657 bp and 170 Lfy
sequences were 741 bp, which yielded 36 and 35 haplotypes, respectively (Table 1, Additional file 1). Details of
the genetic diversity of populations and regions are presented in Table 2. Among 34 polymorphic sites of Chs, 14
were substitutions and 20 were indels; whereas only one
indel was found among 35 polymorphic sites of Lfy.
Among all of the populations examined, nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.00716 and ranged from 0.00372 (population
CP in the SE region) to 0.00865 (population ALS in the
WC region) in Chs and was 0.00479 and ranged from 0
(population YF in the SE region) to 0.00838 (population
FL in the SE region) in Lfy. Haplotype diversity (Hd) was
0.841 and ranged from 0.515 (population CP in the SE
region) to 1.000 (population HNS in the SW region) in
Chs and was 0.895 and ranged from 0.000 (population YF
in the SE region) to 1.000 (population WC in the WC
region) in Lfy. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities of the
four geographic regions were also calculated: haplotype
diversities (Hd) ranged from 0.679 (SE region) to 0.906
(WC region) in Chs and from 0.674 (NW region) to 0.896
(SE region) in Lfy; nucleotide diversities ranged from
0.00511 (SE region) to 0.00784 (SW region) in Chs and
from 0.00260 (WC region) to 0.00625 (SE region) in Lfy.

other, the haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity of
the SE region estimated for Chs were significantly lower
than those of the other three regions, but the nucleotide
diversity of the SE region estimated for Lfy was significantly higher than those of the other regions. In addition,
the haplotype diversity of the NW region estimated for
Lfy was significantly lower than that of the SE region
(Table 2).
Population structure and gene flow

Mean population pairwise FST values were 0.101 and
0.293 for the Chs and Lfy sequences, respectively (Additional file 2). The haplotype network depicted no clear
patterns of population or regional genetic structuring
(Additional file 3). Mean FST values for regional comparisons were 0.033 and 0.086 for the Chs and Lfy sequences,
respectively (Table 3). Although the pairwise FST estimated from two nuclear DNA sequences showed discrep-

Figure 2 Proportions of common and rare haplotypes of Cinnamomum kanehirae among the four geographic regions. The white
bar indicates the proportion of haplotypes that specifically appeared in
only one of the four regions; the dark bar is the proportion of haplotypes that also appeared in one of the three other regions; the intermediate-gray bar is the proportion of haplotypes that also appeared in
two of the three other regions; and the light-gray bar indicates the proportion of haplotypes that appeared in all four regions.

ancies on the levels of genetic differentiation among
regional comparisons, both Chs and Lfy pairwise FST
matrices revealed higher genetic differentiation when SE
was compared to the regions west of the CMR, but lower
levels of genetic differentiations were found when only
regions west of the CMR were compared (Table 3). The
conspicuous level of genetic differentiation between
regions on either side of the CMR indicates its barrier
effect. A lack of migration-drift equilibrium can be
assumed according to the result of the IBD tests (see
below). Gene flow (Nm) estimated using Wright's model
[51] which assumes migration-drift equilibrium was not
appropriate for estimating magnitudes of gene flow.
Therefore, gene flow varying over time was assumed
when estimating the level of gene flow due to differential
levels of common haplotype sharing among regions west
of the CMR and across the CMR (Figure 2). We applied
the Bayesian approach implemented in MIGRATE [55] to
estimate the magnitudes and directions of gene flow
between pairs of regional samples. The high number of
migrants (M) calculated by the Bayesian approach indicated frequent gene flow, which was not hindered by geological interruption (Figure 1). The Bayesian analysis of

migration showed that the SE region may have served as a
dispersal source southwards in recent times (Figure 1).
At the entire population and regional scales, lack of
correlations between genetic (FST) and geographic distances (both linear and altitudinal slope) was a common
phenomenon according to the Mantel test, and only the
SE-SW comparison showed a marginally significant correlation between genetic distance and linear geographic
distance (r = 0.314, P = 0.049 for Chs sequences and r =
0.295, P = 0.047 for Lfy sequences, 1000 permutations,
one-tailed test). If we consider the altitudinal slope, then
the NW-SE and NW-WC comparisons showed significant correlations between genetic and geographic distances for Chs (r = 0.341, P = 0.011; r = 0.427, P = 0.044,
respectively; 1000 permutations, one-tailed test), whereas
no significant correlation was found based on Lfy
sequences. In addition, we also estimated the most probable time at which gene flow occurred by the Bayesian
approach performed using MIGRATE [55], and high
probabilities of gene flow were found for each comparison during the last interglacial (Figure 3). This result indicates a trend of gene flow that occurred in the recent past
or else a large, stable population size of this species in the
past.
The AMOVA among the four geographic regions and
between the east-west regions had similar results of a
high proportion of the overall genetic variation being
attributed to within-population levels (Table 4). On average, a relatively low percentage of the total genetic variation was attributable to among-region comparisons for
both the four geographic regions and east-west regions.
Nevertheless, the level of among-region genetic differentiation was significant when comparing eastern to western populations (ΦCT = 0.044, P < 0.01 for Chs and ΦCT =
0.170, P = 0.01 for Lfy). Significant genetic differentiation
was also found in both sets of comparisons at the hierarchical level among populations within regions (ΦSC =
0.050 and ΦSC = 0.042 for Chs and ΦSC = 0.230 and ΦSC =
0.207 for Lfy, respectively, for comparisons of the four
geographic regions and the eastern-western regions with
P < 0.05). Moreover, genetic differentiation among populations was also significant for both sets of comparisons
(ΦST = 0.067 and ΦST = 0.084 for Chs, and ΦST = 0.299
and ΦST = 0.341 for Lfy, respectively for comparisons of
the four geographic regions and eastern-western regions
with P < 0.01). When comparing the three geographic
regions west of the CMR, both Chs and Lfy revealed no
genetic structuring among regions, but a certain level of
significant genetic structuring was found at the hierarchical levels among populations within regions and among
populations (ΦSC = 0.080 and ΦST = 0.053 for Chs, and
ΦSC = 0.163 and ΦST = 0.130 for Lfy, respectively).
Although most comparisons of genetic structure were

Page 11 of 17

significant, the relatively shallow genetic structure on
average especially when populations west of the CMR
were compared represents a scenario of unhindered gene
flow incompatible with the rugged geographic topology.
The relatively shallow population structure was also supported by the mixed clustering relationships of populations (data not shown) and again reflects the large,
contiguous distribution of this species in the past.
Demographic history

Neutrality tests of Tajima's D revealed non-significant
negative values in many individual populations, pooled
samples and the four regional samples for both the Chs
and Lfy datasets (Table 2). Non-significant negative Fu's
Fs values were also obtained for all populations, regional
samples, and the pooled samples for Chs data. Similar
results were also seen for most populations and regional
samples with Lfy data; however, significant negative Fu's
Fs values (P < 0.05) in the KS population, SW regions, and
pooled samples were found (Table 2). Fu's Fs is considered to be more sensitive in detecting population expansion and suggesting possible past population growth, but
the expansion may have been restricted to separate local
areas that resulted in the non-significant negative Fu's Fs
values for most populations and regions. Moreover,
either population reduction, population subdivision, a
recent bottleneck, or migration which resulted in secondary contact among previously differentiated lineages
could have caused the discrepancy in detecting population expansion using the pooled samples with these two
neutrality test statistics [67,68]. Non-significant or small
negative values of Tajima's D and Fu's Fs were found in
many individual populations suggesting stationary in C.
kanehirae populations. We also calculated the raggedness
index under the demographic expansion model for each
population and found that many individual populations
had a high raggedness index (Table 2). We further analyzed the mismatch distribution under the spatial expansion model considering population subdivision [60-62].
Analysis of the mismatch distribution showed a multimodal pattern characteristic of population differentiation
which corresponds to demographic growth and a subsequent bottleneck [[61], data not shown]. It is probable
that loss of haplotypes due to the recent bottleneck would
have caused the multimodal mismatch distribution.
According to the mismatch distribution analysis, the
hypothesis of spatial expansion could not be rejected in
pooled samples (SSD = 0.021, P = 0.502 for Chs and SSD
= 0.011, P = 0.38 for Lfy, Table 5). A good fit of the spatial
expansion was also observed for regional samples according to the non-significant SSD values; however, different
expansion times of regional samples estimated by τ were
found due to different coalescent histories of Chs and Lfy
sequences (Table 5). The relatively longer expansion time

and smaller migration rate of the NW region for both
sequence sets (τ = 8.95 and M = 0.02 for Lfy; τ = 25.8 and
M = 0.89 for Chs) implies a far-distant spatial expansion
for older lineages of NW regional samples. In contrast to
NW samples, SE regional samples revealed a relatively
shorter expansion time and larger migration rate (τ = 2.50
and M = 8.08 for Lfy; τ = 5.5 and M = 1.65 for Chs), which
indicates a recent spatial expansion.
The BSP analysis suggested a past increase in the effective population size of C. kanehirae for both nuclear
markers (Figure 4, Additional file 4). An increase in the
effective population size inferred by Chs was smaller than
that inferred by Lfy. Moreover, the time of population

growth inferred by Chs was later than that inferred by Lfy.
Slight differences in trends of the population size increase
and expansion time are likely due to different coalescent
histories of the two loci and uncertainty of molecular dating [69]. On the other hand, a clear recent bottleneck was
revealed by the pooled samples of Chs sequences, but Lfy
data showed only a slight decrease in population size
after the last glacial maximum (LGM) expansion. In addition, regional samples of western, WC, and SE revealed a
more-obvious population decline for Chs than for Lfy
(Figure 4). Moreover, NW samples displayed a history of
a prolonged population decline followed by a recent sudden expansion based on Lfy variations.

Discussion
Genetic diversity

Figure 4 Bayesian skyline plot revealing the demographic trends
of Chs and Lfy intron lineages of Cinnamomum kanehirae. The
population size was measured as the effective population size per generation. MIS, marine isotope stage.

Historical demographic events and population sizes of
most natural populations fluctuated and left traces in patterns of their genetic diversity. In this study, C. kanehirae
had higher or comparable nucleotide diversities for both
Chs and Lfy or either one of them separately compared to
the nucleotide diversity in population studies of nuclear
genes such as Chs in the Hippophaë rhamnoides species
complex [70], the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pdh) gene in Q. glauca [71] and the nucleotide

Liao et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:124
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/124

diversity of G3pdh in Manihot esculenta [72], the PHYP
and PHYO loci in Pinus sylvestris [73], and the fruit vacuolar invertase gene in Solanum pimpinellifolium [74].
Although the comparison of nucleotide diversity using
nuclear DNA sequence data might not be complete, the
high level of allozyme variation found also suggests a
great potential for high genetic variation in nuclear DNA
sequences of C. kanehirae [35]. High nucleotide diversity
of nuclear genes may reflect a long evolutionary history
of a large, stable population, or mixing of differential lineages via range expansion [75-77] and is consistent with
field surveys of the contiguous range distribution of C.
kanehirae in the past [25,26].
Historical and recent demography of Cinnamomum
kanehirae

Overall, it can be seen that the demographic history of C.
kanehirae is far more complex than previously thought,
with evidence of historical range expansion and a very
recent bottleneck (Table 2, Figure 4). While population
expansion was rejected by Tajima's D and Fu's Fs test statistics in most population and regional samples, the high
raggedness index estimated for individual populations
suggests the occurrence of bottleneck events [78]. Population bottlenecks were also evident when analyzed with
the BSP (Figure 4). On the other hand, the mismatch
analyses failed to reject a spatial expansion model for all
datasets including pooled and regional samples (Table 5).
Historical spatial expansion was also revealed by the BSP
analysis (Figure 4). From these results the demographic
history of C. kanehirae conformed to the hypothesis of
past spatial range expansion followed by a very recent
population bottleneck. However, the past spatial range
expansion might not display a molecular signature of a
unimodal distribution characteristic of sudden expansions in un-subdivided populations, even though populations had expanded by several orders of magnitude after
the past expansion [61] and was evident through analysis
with the MIGRATE software, which might reflect a historically large stable population of C. kanehirae (Figure
3). The level of nucleotide diversity of C. kanehirae might
therefore be a species-associated feature, and also a result
of its past evolutionary history as well as contemporary
events.
The climate during interglacial periods in Taiwan was
mostly humid and warm (in contrast to glacial periods)
[79,80], and therefore habitats at different elevations were
appropriate for the growth of C. kanehirae. Population
expansion after the LGM was inferred for several plant
species including C. kanehirae based on cpDNA variations [21,37,40,81]. Further information on the demographic history of C. kanehirae was revealed by nuclear
DNA variations. It is likely that larger genetic variability
that accumulated in nuclear markers coalesced into a lon-

Page 13 of 17

ger genealogy relative to cpDNA, reflecting greater sensitivity in revealing insights into both recent and older
events. Moreover, C. kanehirae is an insect-pollinated
hermaphrodite with male and female flowers at different
times possibly promoting outcrossing and therefore at
least a 2-fold higher effective population size of nuclear
loci relative to cpDNA makes it more sensitive to population oscillations. The vegetational history traced by pollen records illustrates rapid growth of Alnus,
Liquidambar, Mallotus, Trema, and the Chenopodiaceae
in subtropical forests of Taiwan [82]. Characteristics of a
slow growth rate and long generation time (approximate
20 years) may be limiting factors in habitat establishment
for C. kanehirae when competing with other plant species, which thus reinforced the present-day bottleneck.
Loss of genetic diversity due to anthropogenic factors
might not be apparent because of the high genetic diversity that accumulated during past range expansions and
resulted in only a slight decline in the recent effective
population size as estimated by the BSP analysis. Nevertheless, this small decline in the recent population size
reveals a commencing phase of a bottleneck in C. kanehirae inflicted by anthropogenic factors. The past increase
in gene flow and spatial expansion should have assisted
the dispersal of population- and region-specific haplotypes; however, human interventions including overdeforestation and habitat destruction caused declining of
population size and fewer opportunities for colonization
of these specific haplotypes.
Contemporary genetic structure and gene flow

Cinnamomum kanehirae is a plant species with bird-dispersed seeds. Forest birds in the warm period of the last
interglacial [83] could have facilitated seed dispersal of
Lauraceae species and accelerated gene flow between C.
kanehirae populations. Cinnamomum kanehirae has a
similar pattern of diversity distribution as that of Machilus thunbergii (Lauraceae) based on cpDNA variations
with most populations possessing the ancestral haplotype
[40,84]. A shared ancestral polymorphism was the cause
of the lack of genetic differentiation among populations
in these species. In this study, relatively low levels of
genetic differentiation (FST) and a high degree of gene
flow were also found by estimates of M based on nuclear
DNA variations. Moreover, the haplotype network
depicted no clear patterns of geographic structuring, further supporting the regional migrations of haplotypes
(Additional file 3). The overall spatial genetic differentiation estimated among all C. kanehirae populations was
not purely stochastic, but instead probably reflects the
effect of secondary contacts through migration due to
range expansion after the LGM (Figure 3, Table 5).
Rates and patterns of dispersal and migration between
populations will affect the genetic structure of species:

Liao et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:124
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/124

the higher the dispersal ability, the lower the population
structuring [85]. The AMOVA revealed a certain level of
significant genetic structuring in C. kanehirae populations, but the level of the genetic structuring of the two
nuclear DNA loci assayed was relatively low on average at
all hierarchical levels. Relatively low levels of genetic differentiation in C. kanehirae, especially among populations west of the CMR (Table 3), can be attributed to two
possibilities: first, gene exchange between long-term isolated populations and a second, recent fragmentation of a
large population with recurrent gene flow. A similar consequence of a lack of genetic structuring and low population differentiation was observed for these two
possibilities; however, there were slight differences in the
outcomes. In the situation of long-term isolation, each
separate population would have independently experienced genetic drift, and resulted in high frequencies of
rare haplotypes in each population [86]. On the other
hand, if the populations were recently separated, there
would insufficient time for genetic drift to have occurred
in each small fragmented population, and most populations would share common haplotypes [87]. Sharing of
haplotypes was frequently found among populations and
among regions (Table 1, Figure 2), although some haplotypes were region- and/or population-specific, however,
with relatively low proportions. Therefore, the hypothesis
of recent fragmentation of a large population with recurrent gene flow is highly probable. A general lack of IBD, at
a regional scale to the west of the CMR, is typically considered to be the result of a large, stable population with
historically recurring gene flow, which was further supported by the high migration rates among both populations and regions (Figure 3).
The implications of incomplete drift-migration equilibrium can further explain the contemporary genetic structure of C. kanehirae, which is the outcome of the
interaction between inherent past spatial expansion with
the barrier effect of the CMR and recent bottleneck
events. Taiwan is a continental island which began to rise
approximately 4 Mya by tectonic compression of the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates. The CMR geographically
separates the landscape into eastern and western parts
[13]. The barrier effect of gene flow by the CMR in Taiwan was observed in several plant and animal studies
[37,81,88]. The AMOVA indicated some level of geographic structuring resulted in haplotypes specific to
either the eastern or western populations of C. kanehirae,
which might be related to the barrier effect of the CMR,
and this was statistically supported (Table 4). The occurrence of population- or region-specific haplotypes may
have resulted from a recent bottleneck event due to
human interventions that caused the loss of haplotypes in
other populations and regions; however, the possible fail-

Page 14 of 17

ure to discover haplotypes due to the small sample size
cannot be excluded. Historically, recurrent gene flow
between populations, across geographic regions and
across the CMR possibly diminished the level of genetic
differentiation and the influence of the CMR barrier.
Therefore, common haplotype distributions between
geographic regions and relatively shallow genetic structuring are the result of historical gene flows. Under the
drift-migration equilibrium, patterns of exclusivity are
not expected, particularly for a large population size or a
short isolation time. In this scenario, common haplotypes
should be more abundant than private ones in an individual population. However, rare or population-specific haplotypes occurred in almost all of the populations
examined (Table 1).
Dispersal after the LGM

Historical and extrinsic ecological events can leave signatures in the spatial genetic structure of a species and provide insights into understanding the species' evolutionary
history [75]. In Taiwan, six subtropical tree species have
been phylogeographically studied using cpDNA variations, and the SE part of Taiwan was inferred to be a
major diversity center based on average FST divergences
from populations of other regions [22,37,40,71,81,84,89],
and that was further suggested by this study because a
higher average FST divergence from other regions was
found when the SE was compared to other regions (Table
3). However, the SE region being postulated as a diversity
center in this way may only reflect its long isolation from
other regions, which was suggested by the high level of
regional-specific haplotypes and very recent expansion
southward. In contrast, the southerly expansion event of
the NW region to the west of the CMR was older according to the TMRCA estimates (Table 5). The trend of a
temperature rise after cold climatic periods of the Pleistocene was inferred to have occurred from south to north
assisted by the warm Kuroshio Current that flow northward offshore of the east coast of Taiwan [90]. Although
the South China Sea Warm Current flowed through the
Taiwan Strait after the LGM when sea levels again rose,
the magnitude of the temperature rise might not have
been significant, as the area west of the CMR faces cold
fronts from the north as well as the barrier effect of the
CMR in receiving warm temperatures from the south
carried by the Kuroshio Current. Thus, a deferred timing
of the temperature rise may have occurred in western
populations of C. kanehirae (except populations in the
SW region). The onset of a temperature rise after the
LGM for populations located in the SE region preceded
that of populations located in other regions, thereby facilitating the migration from SE to SW regions by C. kanehirae.

Conclusions
Distributions of genetic variations in wild populations
provide insights into a species' evolutionary history and
its future continuity [75,91]. Cinnamomum kanehirae is
confronted with conditions of being rare, fragmented,
and threatened at the present time, consistent with the
genetic survey that revealed a pattern of population
growth followed by an ongoing bottleneck. Despite the
declining effective population size of C. kanehirae, the
genetic diversity of remnant individuals showed no dramatic reduction in genetic diversity. In C. kanehirae, a
tree with a long generation time, the rapid population
decline probably began decades ago due to anthropogenic
interventions for two or more generations. Thus information on the loss of genetic diversity might not be spontaneously revealed, but will probably be seen within two or
more generations if the populations are not restored. In
light of the declining effective population size, the condition of the true population size of C. kanehirae at present
may be far more severely threatened. In addition to the
continuing illegal selective cutting for cultivating the
medicinal fungus, A. cinnamomea, the loss of habitat is
another serious issue contributing to population declines
of C. kanehirae. Elevations where C. kanehirae grows
range 200~2000 m, and overdevelopment for farming
vegetables, tea, and fruit crops has destroyed the natural
habitats of primeval forests, including habitats of C. kanehirae. Therefore, loss of the population size of C. kanehirae was mainly caused by human overexploitation. In
consequence, it is essential that this valuable species be
conserved through habitat restoration, which can
advance the restoration of the effective population size of
C. kanehirae. Further field surveys to locate plants and
grafts for ex situ conservation are another requirement to
conserve this species. Management strategies should also
consider reinforcing local populations with individuals
originating from populations showing the closest genetic
relatedness to produce larger population with higher
genetic variability. In summary, conservation strategies
must therefore aim for habitat restoration and remnant
diversity preservation, and avoid the occurrence of
genetic inbreeding in populations of C. kanehirae.
