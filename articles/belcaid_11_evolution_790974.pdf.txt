Abstract
Background: A large family of viruses that infect bacteria, called phages, is characterized by long tails used to
inject DNA into their victims’ cells. The tape measure protein got its name because the length of the corresponding
gene is proportional to the length of the phage’s tail: a fact shown by actually copying or splicing out parts of
DNA in exemplar species. A natural question is whether there exist units for these tape measures, and if different
tape measures have different units and lengths. Such units would allow us to retrace the evolution of tape
measure proteins using their duplication/loss history. The vast number of sequenced phages genomes allows us to
attack this problem with a comparative genomics approach.
Results: Here we describe a subset of phages whose tape measure proteins contain variable numbers of an 11
amino acids sequence repeat, aligned with sequence similarity, structural properties, and simple arithmetics. This
subset provides a unique opportunity for the combinatorial study of phage evolution, without the added
uncertainties of multiple alignments, which are trivial in this case, or of protein functions, that are well established.
We give a heuristic that reconstructs the duplication history of these sequences, using divergent strains to
discriminate between mutations that occurred before and after speciation, or lineage divergence. The heuristic is
based on an efficient algorithm that gives an exhaustive enumeration of all possible parsimonious reconstructions
of the duplication/speciation history of a single nucleotide. Finally, we present a method that allows, when
possible, to discriminate between duplication and loss events.
Conclusions: Establishing the evolutionary history of viruses is difficult, in part due to extensive recombinations
and gene transfers, and high mutation rates that often erase detectable similarity between homologous genes. In
this paper, we introduce new tools to address this problem.

Background
In 1984, Katsura and Hendrix [1] showed that when a
specific gene of the phage l was shortened, the resulting
viruses’ tails were proportionally shorter. The corresponding tape measure protein has since been identified
in a large number of phages and prophages. These proteins often have a variable number of tandem repeats
with highly conserved tryptophan (W) and phenylalanine (F) amino acids at fixed positions that are used as

anchors by small auxiliary proteins to stretch the tape
and scaffold the actual tail construction (see, for example, [2]). The regular spacing between these anchors, or
period, seems to be a key structural property of the tape
measure protein and acts as a marking on the tape.
Phages are believed to be, by far, the most abundant
form of life on the planet [3], a fact reflected by the
large number of phage and prophage genomes currently
available. This wealth of data allowed us to literally shop
for tape measures that had specific properties in terms
of length, period, composition and level of similarity.

orthologous segments (pairs of segments on the same
line of the parallel alignment) compared to paralogous
segments (pairs occurring in the same species) led us to
conclude that these two sequences share the same

duplication history. Additional File 1 contains a detailed
discussion of this issue.
Reconstructing duplication histories has been an
intensively studied combinatorial problem in the last ten
years or so (see [4] and [5] for reviews), following an
initial, more biology oriented work, by Walter Fitch in
1977 [6]. Recent advances on duplication history reconstruction extend the previous models by allowing more
operations such as inversions [7] or segmental duplications [8]. All these approaches suppose a fixed boundaries model, meaning that duplication events may only
occur at a fixed set of breakpoints, that does not apply
very well to virus duplications (see Additional File 2).
However, the basics of the theory of reconstructing
unrestricted duplications was developed by Benson and
Dong [9] in 1999, and constitutes the starting point of
the present study. The idea of their heuristic is to evaluate the number of mutations for each putative duplication event, and choose to contract the segment with
minimum, or near minimum, number of mutations.
We tested most available algorithms and heuristics with or without the fixed boundaries hypothesis -using
the amino acid sequences and the corresponding DNA
sequences of the two viruses in Figure 1. Unfortunately,
despite the striking similarity of the sequences, the two
versions of the duplication history of their presumed
common ancestor were always different. Since their
divergence, each virus seems to have added embellishments to the original story, by the way of mutations,
that eventually blur the common origin of their duplication history.
Here we develop a method that uses, in parallel, the
information from two or more sequences to detect the
most recent duplication event of their ancestor. It is
based on an algorithm that computes the expected
number of mutations that occurred before any speciation event.

Results and discussion
The units of the tape measures

The telltale of units in tape measure proteins is tandem
repeat sequences, that can be detected with existing
software [10,11]. However, since these tools are based
on sequence similarity, that can be barely detectable in
some cases, they must be complemented by alternative
tools. Figure 2 shows a motif generated by the Meme
Motif Discovery software [12] with three tape measure
proteins of Staphylococcus phages SAP-26, 69 and D139
(accession numbers [YP_003857082], [YP_239580] and
[ZP_0632492l]). This motif indicates a possible repeat
unit of 11 amino acids, with the amino acid tryptophan
(W) as a marker.
The structural analysis of Siponen et al [2] suggested
that amino acid phenylalanine (F) could be an alternate

Page 3 of 12

marker, and that a pattern with mixed period (11-11-18)
could also be present. This information was used to
construct two search patterns - in ProSite format:
Pattern 1: [FW]-x(10)-[FW]-x(10)-[FW]-x(10)-[FW]-x
(10)-[FW]-x(10)-[FW]-x(10)-[FW]
Pattern 2: [FW]-x(10)-[FW]-x(10)-[FW]-x(17)-[FW]-x
(10)-[FW]-x(10)-[FW]-x(17)-[FW]
Using the BLAST package algorithm seedtop (ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) we found that Pattern 1 has
occurrences in 191 of the 5608 proteins records in Genbank that have an explicit reference to “tape measure
phage protein”, and Pattern 2 has occurrences in 102 of
the 5608 proteins (as of April 22, 2011). Of these, 16
sequences have occurrences of both patterns, yielding a
total of 277 sequences that contain at least one occurrence of either pattern, or nearly 5% of the 5608
sequences. Note that these results poorly reflect the real
number of tape measure proteins with such periods,
since many proteins highly similar to known tape measure proteins are annotated with various descriptors that
range from “minor tail protein” to “hypothetical
protein”.
This was an encouraging first result that yielded
examples of tandem repeats that are discussed in the
next paragraphs. However, further investigations, both
computational and biological, are needed to discover, if
they exist, the repeated units of the remaining annotated
tape measure proteins. Current automated tandem
repeat finders rely on internal similarity to identify
repeated units, and many tape measure proteins fail to
show them. Biological evidence of conserved structures
- such as the work described in [2] -are key observations
that allow to construct alignments using these structures, but are based on protein crystallography experiments, thus not widely available.
Reconstruction of the duplication history

We initially tried to reconstruct the duplication history
of the two phage DNA sequences that code for the
sequences in Figure 1 by applying the Benson & Dong
algorithm [9] separately to each sequence. The algorithm computes a normalized distance between each
tandem pair of segments, and chooses as the most plausible recent duplication a pair that minimizes the distance. The normalized distance is obtained by
computing the number of mutations necessary to transform one segment into the other, normalized by dividing by the length of the segments. Minimizing this
distance yields a most parsimonious duplication event
with respect to the average number of mutations necessary to explain it. (For further details, see the Method
section.) For example, comparing the two consecutive
segments of length 33 starting at position p = 210 yield
the normalized distances shown in Figure 3(a).

Figure 2 Units on the tape A motif, with 15 occurrences, generated by the Meme Motif Discovery software [12] using three tape measure
protein sequences shows the period of 11 amino acids and tryptophan (W) as a “marker” on the tape.

The Benson & Dong algorithm requires these distances to be evaluated for each possible position and
each possible multiple of the period, here 33 base pairs.
In this first experiment, both sequences predict that the
most recent duplication is a segment of length 33
nucleotides, but disagree on where it should be. The
two top curves of Figure 4 plot the distance versus position for the two phage sequences: the curves often
widely disagree, including on where the minima are
attained. The graph for phage A2_Kyoto reaches its
minimum at each position in interval [95..101], and the
graph for phage Ba4_657, at position 102, and in intervals [111..119] and [173..187].

Assuming that the two sequences are indeed orthologous, the origin of disagreements between the curves
lies in mutations that occurred after speciation. Consequently, if the data of both sequences are to be used to
reconstruct the duplication history, it is necessary to
develop a scoring technique, detailed in the Methods
section, that can discriminate between “recent” mutations and “ancient” mutations.
Contrary to the classic distance that counts the number of positions in which two sequences are different,
the new distance is based on the simultaneous comparison of four sequences. An example of computation
taken at position p = 210 is shown in Figure 3(b). In

Figure 3 Examples of distance computations Part (a) shows the computation of normalized distance between two pairs of segments. The
distance is the number of positions with different nucleotides divided by the length of the sequence. Part (b) shows the new normalized
distance using information from the four segments. This distance is computed by evaluating the number of mutations that precede speciation,
assuming that the speciation event followed the duplication event. (See Methods for the details of the computation).

Figure 4 Evaluating the position of the most recent duplication Each of the three curves evaluates the cost of a duplication of length 33 at
position p along the sequence of tape measure genes. The two top curves, obtained by independently computing the distances using the two
orthologous sequences of Figure 1, do not even agree on positions where minimum cost occur. The bottom curve combines the information of
the two sequences by discriminating between “recent” mutations, and mutations that occurred before the speciation event.

this example, only three columns have a positive score:
the first and third columns contain the motifs actc and
tgtc and get a score of 0.8, reflecting the expected number of mutations that preceded the speciation event; the
second column contains the motif tata and gets a score
of 1. The combined normalized distance is thus (2.6)/33.
This combined normalized distance applied to all possible positions yields the bottom curve of Figure 4. The
new curve smooths out the differences between the first
two curves, and narrows the search for the position of
the most recent duplication: it reaches its minimum
value at each position of interval [97..102]. This
approach can be used recursively in order to reconstruct
the recent duplication history of these sequences (data
not shown) but going further might stretch too far the
use of a heuristic on limited input. However, pinpointing the possible positions of the most recent duplication
can be useful in establishing the phylogenetic relationships between tape measure proteins, as we show in the
next section.
Duplication or loss?

We now turn to a group of closely related phages that
infect bacteria of the Cereus group. Figure 5 shows the
self-alignments of three tape measure proteins from prophages labeled by the strain of Bacillus in which they
were found (accession numbers anthracis [NP_846030:
337..622], thurigiensis [YP_003664881: 223..508] and

mycoides [ZP_04158128: 746..987]). One of them,
mycoides, is shorter than the others by 44 amino acids.
The heuristic of the preceding section applied to
anthracis and thurigiensis predicts that the most recent
duplication of their common ancestor is 132 nucleotides
long, or 44 amino acids. It is thus natural to conjecture
that mycoides is a descendant of the pre-duplicated
ancestor. However, there is always the possibility of a
loss of a bloc of 44 amino acids in an ancestor of
mycoides.
When two tandem repeat sequences are suspected to
differ by one duplication or loss event, it is possible to
estimate at which position this event occurred, regardless of the nature of the event (see Methods for the theoretical aspects). If the most recent event is a
duplication event, its position can be determined by the
techniques of the preceding section. In theory, there are
two cases:
1. The two predictions agree. Then the most recent
event is either a duplication, or a loss of a recently
duplicated segment.
2. The two predictions disagree. Then the most recent
event is a loss.
Figure 6 shows the two sets of predictions: the
curve giving the cost of a duplication at position p for
the combined sequences of anthracis and thurigiensis;
and the curve indicating the cost of a duplication/loss
event at position p when comparing mycoides to the

acids is repeated four times in the first two sequences, and three times in the third one. Each sequence comes from of a prophage genome,

consensus of anthracis and thurigiensis. The two
curves reach their minimal, or near minimal, values
in disjoint intervals, giving more weight to the
hypothesis that the event was a loss rather than a
duplication.

This result illustrates the difficulty of deciding
between duplication and loss. Indeed, as simulations
show (see the Methods section), the shape of the curve
that determines the position of the most recent event is
also an indication of its nature.

Figure 6 Discriminating between duplications or losses The blue curve (A+T recent duplication) evaluates the cost of the most recent
duplication of the ancestor of anthracis and thurigiensis being at position p. The red curve evaluates the cost of a duplication/loss event at
position p when comparing the consensus of anthracis and thurigiensis to mycoides. The intervals where these costs are minimal, or near
minimal, are disjoint..

Methods
Heuristic for duplication reconstruction

The duplication reconstruction heuristic proposed in [9]
compares every possible pair of consecutive segments of
length np where n is an integer greater than 0, and p is
the period of the repeat. Each comparison results in a
score that is divided by np, and the duplication with the
lowest score is a candidate for contraction. A contraction merges together the two consecutive segments by
using the Fitch procedure: let S and T be the sets of
nucleotides at position j in each segment, if S ∩ T ≠ ∅,
then the new position j is filled by S ∩ T, otherwise it is
filled by S ∪ T.
In the original paper of Benson and Dong, the
sequences were scored by the number of unions performed in the comparison, which is proportional to the
number of mutations that separates the two segments.
In this paper, we want to apply the same heuristic, but
with a different scoring technique that uses two or more
DNA sequences whose common ancestor underwent
the duplication events. To do this, we must be able to
evaluate the number of mutations that occurred before
the speciation event(s).
Orthologous and paralogous nucleotides

The self-alignments of Figure 1 are gapless, and this
property holds also for the alignment of the underlying
DNA sequences. This allows us to apply the classical
terminology of paralogs and orthologs to single nucleotide positions.

Suppose that a sequence of length p undergoes a series of duplications of lengths np, where n is an integer
greater than 0. For example:
abcd → abcdabcd
→ abcdabcdabcd
→ abcdabcdabcdabcdabcd

The length of the resulting sequence will also be a multiple of p, and any two nucleotides in the resulting sequence
whose positions differ by a multiple of p were created by a
duplication event, thus can be called paralogs. In our
model, two tape measure proteins that have a good parallel
alignment, such as the one in Figure 1, are presumed to
share the duplication history of their common ancestor.
Under this hypothesis, all duplications occurred before the
speciation event, and nucleotides that are in the same
respective position in each sequence can be called orthologs.
Figure 7 shows the orthology and paralogy relations
among four nucleotides, and the corresponding Fitch
diagram depicting the duplication and the speciation
events. Given such a diagram, whose leaves are labeled
by a motif x1, y1, x2, y2 of 4 nucleotides, a first problem
is the following:
Problem 1 Suppose that a duplication event created
paralogous nucleotides x and y, and that a subsequent
speciation event created orthologous viruses 1 and 2,
yielding the two pairs of orthologs x1 and x2, and y1 and
y 2 , what is the expected number of mutations that
occurred before the speciation event?

captured by a Fitch diagram.

F-trees and the Fitch algorithm

To discuss the properties of the model, we need the following definition and notations, illustrated in Figure 8.
Definition 1 An F-tree is a duplication-speciation tree
with 4 ordered leaves labeled by sets A, B, C, D that are
subsets of the set of nucleotides {a, c, g, t}.
• The left node is the parent of the leaves labeled by
sets A and C. It is labeled by L = A ∩ C, if this set is
non-empty, otherwise by L = A ∪ C.
• The right node is the parent of the leaves labeled by
sets B and D. It is labeled by R = B ∩ D, if this set is
non-empty, otherwise by R = B ∪ D.
• The ancestor node is labeled by X = L ∩ R, if this set
is non-empty, otherwise by X = L ∪ R.
The number N of mutations of an F-tree is the number of set unions necessary to construct the sets L, R
and X. A labeling of an F-tree is a labeling of its leaves

L

and nodes by nucleotides, such that each leaf is labeled
by a nucleotide that belongs to its set label, and such
that the number of mutations - that is, edges with different labels at their extremities - is equal to N. Note
that it is not mandatory that nucleotides that label internal nodes belong to the corresponding set label, L, R or
X.
The procedure outlined in Definition 1 was originally
proposed be W. Fitch [13] as a way to compute the
minimum number of mutations for a given tree, it was
later proven correct by D. Sankoff [14]. The sets computed for a parent node by this rule are called Fitch sets.
A mutation occurs before the speciation event in a
given labeling if it occurs between the root and one of
its children, otherwise it occurs after the speciation
event. If an F-tree has several labelings, we denote by
Nb the average number of mutations that occurs before

speciation among all possible labelings, and by Na, the
average number of mutations that occurs after speciation. Clearly, Nb + Na = N.
We first compute, as an example, the values of N and
Nb in the case all sets A, B, C and D are singletons. The
general proof is presented in the next section. There are
44 = 256 different motifs of 4 nucleotides. With respect
to our problem, they can be partitioned into 7 classes
with the following representatives: aaaa, aaat, atta,
caat, tata, acat, and actg. Of these, the first four cases
yield Nb = 0.
The tata-motif is the simplest of the remaining cases,
since only one mutation is required to generate it. This
motif can be described as two pairs of equal orthologous
nucleotides. Figure 9(a) shows the two possible labelings,
and the single mutation can only be assigned before the
speciation event.
The actg-motif, on the other hand, requires a minimum of three mutations. Figure 9(b) shows 3 of the 12
possible labelings and, on average, 2/3 mutations occur
before the speciation event, and 7/3 after. Note that the
third labeling is not obtainable by the Fitch traceback
algorithm since the label of the right child of the root is
not contained in the union of the labels of its children.
The acat-motif is the most complex and is shown in Figure 9(c). It has one pair of equal orthologous nucleotides,
and requires a minimum of two mutations. Three labelings have nucleotide a as an ancestor, one has nucleotide c
and one has nucleotide t. On average, 4/5 mutations occur
before the speciation event, and 6/5 after.
In the next sections, we will show how these observations can be generalized to trees labeled by sets.

t

When the leaves of an F-tree are labeled by sets containing more than one element, the possible labelings
can include more than one motif. For example, if:
A = {a, t}, B = {a, t}, C = {t}, D = {a}
then the Fitch procedure yields N = 1 mutations. Four
possible labelings achieve this minimum: two with tata
labeling the leaves, one with aata, and one with ttta.
The motif atta is excluded since it requires N = 2
mutations.
In order to solve the general case, given the sets A, B,
C and D, consider the following parameters:

mutations that occur before speciation in an F-tree with
leaves labeled by the sets A, B, C and D, with N > 0

Nb =

2n tata
.
2n tata + n aaat

Proof. There is only one mutation when exactly one of
the sets A ∩ C, B ∩ D or L ∩ R is empty. If L ∩ R is not
empty, then either A ∩ C = ∅ or B ∩ D = ∅. If A ∩ C is
empty, then the single mutation occurs in the left subtree, there is at least one motif with three equal nucleotides implying naaat > 0, ntata = 0, and Nb = 0, thus the
result holds. The case B ∩ D is similar.
If L ∩ R is empty, then any motif with two different
nucleotides may be present, but only motifs with orthologous equal nucleotides (the tata-motif), or motifs with
three equal nucleotides, yield N = 1. The tata-motif has
two different labelings, as seen in Figure 9(a), both of
which assign the mutation before the speciation event.
The aaat-motif has only one labeling, and the mutation
occur after the speciation event. Thus N b = 2n tata /
(2ntata + naaat).
Lemma 2 When N = 2, the average number of mutations that occur before speciation is given by:
Nb =

4n acat
.
5n acat + 2n atta + n caat

Proof. We first consider the case L ∩ R ≠ ∅. Both A ∩
C = ∅ and B ∩ D = ∅, implying nacat = 0. Since [(A ∪
C) ∩ (B ∪ D)] ≠ ∅, then at least one of the sets A ∩ B,
A ∩ D, C ∩ B or C ∩ D is not empty. In this case, ncaat
may be 0 when both |A ∩ B| and |C ∩ D| are non zero,
or both |A ∩ D| and |C ∩ B| are non zero, but in these
cases, natta > 0, thus we have (2natta + ncaat) > 0. The
atta-motif has two possible labelings, both of which
assign the two mutations after speciation, and the caatmotif has only one labeling, also with the two mutations
after speciation, thus Nb = 0 and the formula holds.
When L ∩ R = ∅, then one of A ∩ C or B ∩ D is not
empty and nacat > 0. As seen on Figure 9(c), there are
five possible labelings of acat-motifs, four of which have
a mutation preceding speciation. However, atta-motifs
and caat-motifs may also be present, for example with:
A = {a, t}, B = {c, g}, C = {a, g}, D = {t}.
Thus, Nb = 4nacat/(5nacat + 2natta + ncaat).
Lemma 3 When N = 3, the average number of mutations that occur before speciation is given by Nb = 2/3.
Proof. In order to have N = 3, all three sets A ∩ C, B ∩
D and L ∩ R = (A ∪ C) ∩ (B ∪ D) must be empty, thus
the four sets are singletons, and, by the case study of
Figure 9(b), Nb = 2/3.
Detecting duplication and loss events

In this section, we discuss the problem of detecting a duplication or loss event when comparing two tandem repeat

sequences. We first discuss this problem in the fixed
boundary context. Formally, we are given two sequences:
b = b1…bj–1bj+1…bn
c = c1…cj–1cjcj+1…cn
each of them composed of segments of the same
length, and both sharing a common ancestor a that contained all segments, except possibly the segment at position j. The relation between the sequences is either a
duplication creating segment c j in the lineage of
sequence c, or a loss of segment b j in the lineage of
sequence b. The Hamming distance between two segments is denoted by H(s, t) and measures the number of
position with different nucleotides in segments s and t.
Under these hypothesis, the problem is the following:
Problem 2 Given sequences b and c, what is the position j of the duplication or loss event that minimizes the
distance between the sequences?
Define c| i = c1 …ci−1 c i+1 …cn , as the sequence c with
segment at position i removed. Then we have:
Proposition 1 If H(b i, ci) ≤ H(b i, cℓ), for ℓ ≠ i, then
the function H(b, c|i) attains a minimum when i = j.
j −1
n
Proof. We have H(b, c| j ) = ∑ k =1 H(b k , c k ) +∑ k = j +1 H(b k , c k ) . If
i <j then

H(b, c|i ) =

∑ H(b , c

k = j +1

thus, since H(bk, ck) ≤ H(bk, ck+1), we have:

H(b, c|i ) ≥

k = j +1

= H(b, c| j )

The same reasoning holds when i >j.
The hypothesis that H(b i, ci ) ≤ H(b i , c ℓ) reflects the
fact that the duplication event(s) that created the segments at position i and ℓ preceded the speciation event

Figure 10 Simulation of loss events Three different loss events were simulated in the prophage tape measure gene of A2_Kyoto. The graphs
of the function H(c|[p,p+33), c|[i,i+33)) exhibit a clear minimum around the corresponding values of p, at position 100, 232 and 364. Position 100
corresponds to a loss at the position of the most recent duplication. When the loss event is far from the position of the most recent duplication,
the curve is markedly sharper near the minimum.

that created sequences b and c. In real data, the hypothesis might not hold for all values of i and ℓ, but it
should hold on average.
Without the assumption of repeats with fixed boundaries, it is still possible to use Proposition 1 to obtain an
estimate of the position of a duplication or loss event by
testing all possible sets of boundaries. This is equivalent
to computing, for each position i of the nucleotide
sequence c, H(b, c|[i,i+d) ), where d is the difference in
length of the two sequences, and c|[i,i+d) is the sequence
c with all nucleotides between positions i and i + d – 1
removed.
We also simulated loss events in prophage A2_Kyoto
of Figure 1, whose most recent duplication, according to
the graph of Figure 4, occurs around position p = 100
and is of length 33. Figure 10 shows the graph of function H(c|[p,p+33), c|[i,i+33)) for three different loss events,
one at p = 100, one at p = 232 and one at p = 364.
Each curve exhibits a clear minimum around the position of the simulated loss event, but the shape of the
curve differs depending on the distance between the
position of the loss event and the position of the most
recent duplication.

Conclusions
In this paper, we developed a variety of tools to study
the evolution of tape measure proteins. We relied on
existing software to identify repeated units and markers,
and we have already identified hundreds of sequences
that have a clear repetitive structure. However many

tape measure proteins do not have readily identifiable
repeat sequences, or markers, and new methods must
be developed to classify them.
In order to study the duplication histories of this first
set of sequences, we developed new theoretical tools
that could use in parallel the information provided by
slightly divergent sequences. For the time being, these
analysis are restricted to pairs of sequences for two
main reasons: (1) the algorithm assumes an established
rooted phylogeny of the studied sequences, and, given
the high rate of recombinations between phages [15,16],
this is not a trivial task; (2) the computational complexity of extending the algorithm to more than two species
is unknown, but suspected to be hard.
