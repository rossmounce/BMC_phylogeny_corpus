Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic trees are widely used to visualize evolutionary relationships between
different organisms or samples of the same organism. There exists a variety of both free and
commercial tree visualization software available, but limitations in these programs often require
researchers to use multiple programs for analysis, annotation, and the production of publicationready images.
Results: We present TreeViewJ, a Java tool for visualizing, editing and analyzing phylogenetic trees.
The software allows researchers to color and change the width of branches that they wish to
highlight, and add names to nodes. If collection dates are available for taxa, the software can map
them onto a timeline, and sort the tree in ascending or descending date order.
Conclusion: TreeViewJ is a tool for researchers to visualize, edit, "decorate," and produce
publication-ready images of phylogenetic trees. It is open-source, and released under an GPL
license, and available at http://treeviewj.sourceforge.net.

Phylogenetic trees are widely used to visualize evolutionary relationships between different organisms or samples
of the same organism. There is a variety of both free and
commercial tree visualization software [1-5] available, but
limitations in these programs often require the user to use
multiple programs for analysis, annotation, and display
for publication. For some applications, such as epidemiological studies, the visualization of sample collection
dates along with the tree would provide further insight
into relationships. However, no currently available visualization packages provide this functionality.

only the node name and branch length information. Others, like the New Hampshire Extended [5] and Nexus[7]
formats, can be used to store other data such as formatting
and sequence data. Other file formats, such as the Lucid
[8] and Structure of Descriptive Data (SDD) [9] formats
have been used for the description of taxonomic data.
Recently, a draft standard for an XML-based format, PhyloXML [10], has been released. XML-based formats are
ideal for storing phylogenetic data because they can be
easily interpreted by readily available general purpose
software (thus eliminating the need for customized parsers), easily allow for annotation, and are extensible.

A variety of file formats exist for the storage of phylogenetic trees. Some, like the New Hampshire[6] format store

We have designed a visualization program, TreeViewJ,
which will allow researchers to annotate, edit and produce

publication-ready figures of phylogenetic trees, and to visualize sample collection date information using a timeline. With the use of PhyloXML, there is more flexibility
for editing trees – trees can be edited before visualization
with an XML parser, as well as within the tool. We have
also implemented an algorithm for sorting taxa by date,
while keeping the structure of the tree the same.

Implementation
TreeViewJ is written in Java, against JDK 1.5. The Swing
and Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT) libraries are used
for the graphical user interface, and the Java2D libraries
are used for drawing tasks. This allows the application to
be platform independent. While it is meant to be a standalone application, the object-oriented design of

http://www.scfbm.org/content/2/1/7

TreeViewJ allows straightforward integration with other
Java applets or applications.

Results and discussion
Graphical User Interface
The main user interface for TreeViewJ, shown in Figure 1,
is composed of two panels. The left panel displays open
files (referred to as "forests") and the trees stored within
them. Tooltips are used to display a description of the tree,
if one exists. The user can move trees between files by
either copying and pasting, or using drag and drop. Trees
may also be deleted from forests. Visualization and editing options are easily accessible via menus and toolbars.
The right panel contains a scroll pane which displays the
currently selected tree.

File Input and Output
TreeViewJ offers full read support for Newick and PhyloXML formatted files. Trees in Nexus [7] and Extended
Newick [5] format can be imported, though some information contained in these files may be lost. Currently,
there is no support for Lucid or SDD file formats, but
these could easily be added in the future. PhyloXML files
are read using the Apache Xerces Document Object Model
(DOM) parser [11]. Newick files are parsed using code
adapted from the Phylogenetic Analysis Library (PAL)
[12], and Nexus files are parsed with a custom parser. Files
are written to XML documents using Xerces.

Each file may contain multiple phylogenies. Forests may
be saved to PhyloXML format, and individual trees can be
exported to Newick format.
Visualization
TreeViewJ can represent phylogenies as slanted cladograms, rectangular cladograms, circular cladograms, and
phylograms. The tree drawing code was adapted from
TreeViewX [4], an open source project based on TreeView
[3]. Trees are drawn using the Java2D libraries.

Once a tree is drawn the user can zoom in and out, change
the draw color, and toggle internal and leaf labels on and
off. Zooming and resizing are achieved using affine transforms to avoid redraws. Nodes of the tree can be selected
by right clicking or clicking and dragging and their labels
may be copied to the clipboard and pasted into other
applications.

http://www.scfbm.org/content/2/1/7

the XML document as such are mapped to the leaf nodes
using a timeline, as shown in Figure 1. The JFreeChart [14]
library, along with some additional code, was used to create timelines. Java2D libraries were used to draw lines
from the leaf nodes to their dates. Dates are mapped at a
minimum resolution. For example, if the dates span less
than two years, dates are displayed as mm/yyyy. If the
dates span less than a year, then the dates are displayed as
mm/dd/yyyy.
Date Sorting
Phylogenic trees are sorted by date in the most straightforward way possible: a depth-first post-order sort of the children at each node. Leaf nodes are assigned the dates of the
samples they represent. Internal nodes are assigned the
minimum (ascending) or maximum (descending) date of
its children. The resulting tree is isomorphic to the original tree, with the taxa sorted in ascending (oldest samples
on top) or descending (youngest on top) order (Figure 2).

Conclusion
We present TreeViewJ, an easy to install, easy to use, open
source tool for visualizing and editing phylogenetic trees.
It is written in Java, and therefore is platform independent. It is the first tree viewer to include support for date
mapping and sorting. The ability to draw, edit, analyze,
and produce publication-ready vector graphics makes
TreeViewJ an ideal tool for phylogenetic visualization,
and an excellent complement to full-featured phylogenetic suites such as Mesquite [15] and PAUP [16].

Availability and requirements
Once the tree is drawn, it can be printed or exported to
either Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or JPEG format. The
Apache Batik [13] toolkit is used to create SVG documents.

Editing
Node editing is started by clicking on one of the nodes in
the tree. At this point, the node editing dialog is shown.
The editor allows changes to be made to node name and
font color, as well as the branch width and color. Possible
uses for this functionality would be easily highlighting
parts of the tree that are described in the text, or adding
label to the parent node of a clade. Once editing is completed, the changes are made to the XML document and
the tree is refreshed to display the changes made. Nodes
can also be searched for using Java regular expressions or
plain string mapping.
Date Mapping
Currently, the PhyloXML standard does not provide any
way to store date information. We have proposed an addition to the schema which allows for the addition of sample dates, using the ISO 8601 date format. Dates stored in
