Abstract
Background: The interaction between the Blue Moon butterfly, Hypolimnas bolina, and Wolbachia
has attracted interest because of the high prevalence of male-killing achieved within the species, the
ecological consequences of this high prevalence, the intensity of selection on the host to suppress
the infection, and the presence of multiple Wolbachia infections inducing different phenotypes. We
examined diversity in the co-inherited marker, mtDNA, and the partitioning of this between
individuals of different infection status, as a means to investigate the population biology and
evolutionary history of the Wolbachia infections.
Results: Part of the mitochondrial COI gene was sequenced from 298 individuals of known
infection status revealing ten different haplotypes. Despite very strong biological evidence that the
sample represents a single species, the ten haplotypes did not fall within a monophyletic clade
within the Hypolimnas genus, with one haplotype differing by 5% from the other nine. There were
strong associations between infection status and mtDNA haplotype. The presence of wBol1
infection in association with strongly divergent haplotypes prompted closer examination of wBol1
genetic variation. This revealed the existence of two cryptic subtypes, wBol1a and wBol1b. The
wBol1a infection, by far the most common, was in strict association with the single divergent
mtDNA haplotype. The wBol1b infection was found with two haplotypes that were also observed
in uninfected specimens. Finally, the wBol2 infection was associated with a large diversity of mtDNA
haplotypes, most often shared with uninfected sympatric butterflies.
Conclusion: This data overall supports the hypothesis that high prevalence of male-killing
Wolbachia (wBol1) in H. bolina is associated with very high transmission efficiency rather than
regular horizontal transmission. It also suggests this infection has undergone a recent selective
sweep and was introduced in this species through introgression. In contrast, the sharing of
haplotypes between wBol2-infected and uninfected individuals indicates that this strain is not
perfectly transmitted and/or shows a significant level of horizontal transmission.

Background
Inherited symbionts are an important component of the
evolution and ecology of many species. One interaction
whose dynamism makes it particularly interesting is that
between the Blue Moon butterfly, Hypolimnas bolina, and
the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia. One of the Wolbachia
strains within this species, wBol1, possesses male-killing
ability. Attention was first brought to this strain by the
presence of extreme sex ratio bias within certain H. bolina
populations, with up to 100 adult females to each male
[1], associated with 99% of females carrying the wBol1
infection [2]. H. bolina lives on islands throughout the
Pacific, and as these islands vary in wBol1 frequency, so
does their population sex ratio [3]. The variation in population sex ratio affects rates of multiple mating by females,
and the size of spermatophore transferred by males during copulation [4].
Variation in the frequency of wBol1 is therefore a very
important driver of the reproductive ecology of the butterfly host. The wBol1 strain is also of interest because the
extreme prevalence achieved can drive fast evolution in
the host, in the form of the spread of suppressor genes that
stop the action of the male-killer, and restore the sex ratio
to parity [5,6]. When suppressed, the strain wBol1 is
maintained by virtue of its ability to induce a second phenotype, cytoplasmic incompatibility, where infected
males effectively sterilize uninfected females, driving the
infection frequency upward [7]. Accordingly, nearly all
females and males recently collected in South East Asia
and Samoa are infected with wBol1, and also carry the
suppressor of its male-killing activity.
Thus, wBol1 shows spatial variation in both prevalence
and phenotype. Indeed, there are also some islands where
wBol1 is absent. In the majority of these islands, a distinct
infection, wBol2, is present. This strain causes cytoplasmic
incompatibility; males carrying wBol2 are incompatible
with both uninfected and wBol1-infected females. This
incompatibility makes wBol2-infected populations resistant to wBol1 invasion. The wBol2 infection also affects the
pattern of gene flow within the species, producing unidirectional reproductive isolation (male immigrants to
islands that carry wBol2 do not contribute nuclear genes
unless the recipient population also carries wBol2) [8].
The interactions between H. bolina and its resident infections therefore represent a particularly interesting case
study of the ecology and evolution of Wolbachia-host
interactions. However, we have a rather poor understanding as to why this system is the way it is. One of the outstanding questions is what allows wBol1 to achieve its
extreme prevalence. Theory suggests that for male-killing
infections to obtain high prevalence, one of two conditions is necessary (but not sufficient). First, if high rates of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/64

horizontal transmission occur in addition to maternal
transmission, infection is expected to be present at very
high frequency [9]. In the absence of horizontal transmission, standard population genetic models of male-killer
dynamics indicate very high vertical transmission efficiency (>99.5%) or a very strong positive impact of infection on the production of host daughters, is required to
establish high prevalence [10].
We can investigate these aspects of the H. bolina – Wolbachia interaction by examining the association between
infection status and mtDNA variation. Because intracellular bacteria and mitochondria are co-inherited through
the egg cytoplasm, mtDNA can give insight into inherited
bacteria transmission patterns, the timing of the spread of
an infection, and also the source of infection [11-13].
With respect to transmission patterns, if infections are
transmitted with very high efficiency between generations
and there is no horizontal transmission between lineages,
then the mtDNA of infected and uninfected individuals
will evolve to be distinct, because there is little or no flow
of mtDNA between infected and uninfected individuals –
they represent different subpopulations. In contrast,
either inefficient vertical transmission of the bacterium or
regular horizontal transmission result in populations of
uninfected and infected females becoming homogeneous
for their mtDNA diversity [14]. If infection status is a predictor of mtDNA haplotype, this therefore indicates that
horizontal transmission is very low, and either vertical
transmission rates are very high, or infection is very recent,
such that inefficient transmission has not generated uninfected individuals with the 'infected' haplotype. If infection status does not predict mtDNA haplotype, then either
there is inefficient vertical transmission or there is horizontal transfer between lineages, or both.
In this study, we obtained partial sequences of the mitochondrial locus CO1 from 298 H. bolina individuals of
varying infection status, spanning 28 populations. We
report on the diversity of mitochondrial haplotypes
found, and analyze how mtDNA variation is partitioned
by infection status. The structure revealed was surprisingly
complex, prompting further exploration of the Wolbachia
diversity, and the discovery of genetic variation within
strains. Overall, these data reject the hypothesis that high
prevalence of wBol1 in this system is associated with regular horizontal transmission, and support the hypothesis
that high prevalence is associated with very high transmission efficiency. The results also suggest that this infection
has undergone a recent selective sweep and was introduced in H. bolina through introgression.

Methods
Adult H. bolina were collected from across the species
range during the period June 2000 to April 2006 (Figure

1, Table 1). DNA was extracted and the Wolbachia infections assayed by PCR as previously described [3]. To confirm the PCR-based identification, single strand sequences
of the wsp gene were obtained from 35 specimens following amplification using primer pair 81F-691R [15].
Partial sequences of the mitochondrial locus CO1 were
obtained from 298 specimens using the primer pair COIf
and COIr of Brunton & Hurst [16], yielding a 414 bp
sequence. PCR products were sent to Macrogen, Inc. for
purification and single strand direct forward sequencing.
Any new haplotype was sequenced again using reverse
primer to eliminate errors and complete the 5'end of the
sequence. Sequences were edited in Sequencher 4.6 (Gene
Codes Corporation) and deposited in Genbank (accession nos. AJ844898, AJ844900 – AJ844907). To improve
the power of the phylogenetic analysis, sequences of the
same locus were obtained from one specimen of each
haplotype using the primer pair LCO/HCO [17], yielding
a 658 bp sequence.
To assess molecular variation within the wBol1 group in
relation with mitochondrial haplotype, we sequenced the
five MLST genes of different strains [18], and also utilized
the close relatedness of wBol1 to wPip. The wPip strain is
polymorphic for a variety of phage element insertion
within the genome [19]. We attempted amplification of
these elements from wBol1 template using the 16 primers
pairs from Duron et al. [19]. Amplification was successful
using three pairs (orfs Gp1b, Gp2e, Gp3c).
Differentiation among geographic groups and heterogeneity between the haplotypes of wBol1, wBol2 and uninfected hosts was tested using AMOVA in R [20] using the
package seqinR [21].
The phylogenetic relationships amongst the COI H. bolina
sequences and previously described COI sequences of
other Hypolimnas species were investigated. Based on previous phylogenetic analysis [22], one species of the genus
Precis was chosen as outgroup. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed using maximum likelihood as implemented in
Treefinder [23]. The GTR+G substitution model was chosen following a modeltest analysis [24] as implemented in
the HyPhy package [25]. Node support values were calculated using the aLRT (approximate likelihood ratio test)
method [26]. To test the hypothesis that the H. bolina haplotypes form a monophyletic group, we used Treefinder to
compare the likelihood scores of the best tree reconstructed without constraint versus the best tree under the
monophyly constraint.

Results
Partial CO1 sequences were obtained from 298 H. bolina
specimens, spanning 28 populations (figure 1) and com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/64

prising 100 wBol1-infected specimens (89 females and 11
males), 68 wBol2 specimens (34 females and 34 males)
and 130 uninfected specimens (70 females and 60 males)
(Table 1). Across these 298 sequences, 41 polymorphic
sites were observed within the 414 bases sequenced that
allowed us to distinguish 10 different sequences. The 10
haplotypes are coded 1 to 10 throughout the text. In addition to PCR-based detection and identification, sequencing of the wsp gene confirmed the identity of the infection
on a subset of the sample under study (19 wBol1 specimens and 16 wBol2 specimens).
We investigated the phylogenetic relationships amongst
the H. bolina haplotypes and previously described COI
sequences from the same genus. To improve the power of
this analysis, longer sequences of the same locus were
obtained from one specimen of each haplotype using the
primer pair LCO/HCO [17] (except haplotype 7 due to
DNA degradation in specimens from American Samoa).
The best tree is shown in figure 2. Notably, H. bolina haplotypes do not form a monophyletic group in this topology. Whilst haplotypes 2 to 10 do form a monophyletic
group, comprising most of the species mtDNA diversity,
haplotype 1 falls within another clade also comprising
sequences from H. pandarus, H. alimena, H. octocula and
H. antilope. To further test the hypothesis that H. bolina
haplotypes form a monophyletic group, we compared the
likelihood scores of the best tree reconstructed without
constraint versus the best tree under the monophyly constraint. The hypothesis that the constrained tree is the correct tree was rejected (Approximately Unbiased test, p <
0.01). Notably, all the other topology comparison tests
implemented in Treefinder (ELW, BP, KH, SH and WSH
tests) lead to the same conclusion (p < 0.04). Thus, we
conclude that H. bolina haplotypes do not form a monophyletic group, suggesting haplotype 1 was introduced in
this species through Wolbachia-driven introgression.
The genetic distance between H. bolina haplotype 1 and
the other H. bolina haplotypes is considerable by normal
standards of intraspecific variation, with around 5%
divergence from all other haplotypes. Presence of divergent mtDNA haplotypes within a sample is often regarded
as an indicator of the presence of cryptic species. We can
reject this hypothesis in the case of H. bolina. Males carrying haplotype 1 (associated with the wBol1 infection) are
virtually absent from the field, because of male-killing [3].
However, females carrying haplotype 1 are as efficiently
fertilised as females carrying haplotype 2–10 [4]. Given
that there are no other Hypolimnas species present on
many of the islands studied (Fiji, Samoa, French Polynesia), this demonstrates that females carrying haplotype
1 (and the wBol1 infection) readily mate in the field with
uninfected H. bolina males (haplotypes 2 through 10).
The 'biological species' is also attested in the laboratory

Geographic location of the populations sampled and distribution of mtDNA haplotypes among islands, partitioned by WolFigure 1

Geographic location of the populations sampled and distribution of mtDNA haplotypes among islands, partitioned by Wolbachia infection status. Arrow heads indicate geographic origin of the samples. Sample number within each
box corresponds to "Sample #" in Table 1. Within each island, the colours within bars indicate the relative proportion of haplotypes within each infection status. Numbers within bars indicate the number of specimens. u = uninfected, 1a = wBol1a, 1b =
wBol1b, 2 = wBol2. Details on the distinction between wBol1a and wBol1b are given in the Results section, paragraph five.

where females of haplotype 1 taken from the field readily
produce progeny without further mating, and the subsequent haplotype 1 lineages have been routinely maintained over more than three generations by crossing to
sympatric field caught males carrying haplotypes 2
through 10 [3,6,27]. Strikingly, the wBol1 infection is
found in association with two very distantly related mitochondrial lineages (Figure 2). Most commonly (90 specimens), wBol1 is found associated with haplotype 1. On
rare occasions (10 specimens), haplotypes 3 or 6 (forming
a small clade within H. bolina) were detected in association with wBol1. Such association with distinct and
strongly divergent mitochondria is suggestive of a horizontal transfer of Wolbachia, either within H. bolina itself,
or from an as yet unidentified external source. However, it
should be noted that the data also indicates that wBol1
very rarely undergoes horizontal transmission. Horizontal
transmission would move wBol1 onto the mtDNA background of any sympatric uninfected individuals. In contrast, wBol1 is absent from the majority of mtDNA

haplotypes found in sympatric uninfected H. bolina (figure 1).
To further investigate the presence of wBol1 in different
mtDNA haplotypes, we sequenced the 5 Wolbachia MLST
loci from 5 specimens (two bearing haplotype 1 and three
bearing haplotype 6). The same sequences (EF589952 to
EF589956) were obtained from all specimens, confirming
the wBol1 strains present in haplotype 1 and haplotype 6
are closely related, as previously attested by wsp
sequences. However, neither wsp nor MLST sequences are
suitable to distinguish between very recently isolated Wolbachia lineages. To increase our discriminatory power, we
amplified phage WO loci using PCR primers designed for
the wPip Wolbachia strain [19], which is closely related to
wBol1. PCR products were obtained using 3 of the 15
primer pairs. One of these loci (Gp1b) showed a clear variation in amplicon size between specimens, with some
products being long (~1000 bp estimated from agarose
gel) and others short (~330 bp). We obtained sequences

Phylogeny and distribution of Wolbachia infections among haplotypes. The left part of the figure shows the phylogeny of the 10 H. bolina mtDNA haplotypes with respect to H. alimena, H. octocula, H. antilope, H. pandarus, H. missipus, H. anthedon, H. usambara, with Precis tugela as an outgroup. The tree was constructed via Maximum Likelihood estimation in Treefinder;
aLRT (approximate likelihood ratio test) scores are given next to the nodes (only for internal nodes for clarity) and branch
length indicates the number of substitution per site. H. bolina haplotypes are in italics. Genbank accession numbers are given in
parenthesis. The right part of the figure gives the distribution of the various Wolbachia infections status (u: uninfected, wBol1a,
wBol1b, wBol2) observed with each haplotype. Note the relative proportions of the infections are not representative of the
prevalence within the species since sampling was aimed at representing the different infection status in even proportions.
from 3 long and 2 short products (Genbank accession
numbers FJ215870 and FJ215869). Alignment between
sequences was straightforward over the entire length of
the short fragment, which corresponds to the 5' region of
the long fragment. The two sequences differ by three substitutions across the alignment. We performed the discriminating PCR assay on 57 wBol1-infected specimens.
All 48 wBol1-infected individuals associated with haplotype 1 contained the large Gp1b fragment, while individuals associated with the haplotype 3/6 group always
contain the small fragment (n = 9). Hence, this PCR assay
distinguishes two wBol1 sub-types hereafter called wBol1a
(long Gp1b PCR product, strictly associated with mitochondrial haplotype 1) and wBol1b (short Gp1b PCR
product, associated with haplotypes 3/6).

The wBol2 infection was found in association with a wide
diversity of haplotypes within H. bolina (figure 2). Indeed,
seven different haplotypes were retrieved from 68 of the
wBol2 specimens examined. In addition, no haplotype is
private to wBol2-infected specimens, except haplotype 7,
which was observed in four specimens.
We used AMOVA to formally assess and test for association between Wolbachia infection status and mitochondrial sequence variation. In our dataset, infection status
(with four possible levels: uninfected, wBol1a, wBol1b
and wBol2) explains 89% of the mtDNA molecular variance (p < 0.001 based on 1000 permutations). Because
infection shows geographic structure, we then tested separately for each infection type (wBol1a, wBol1b and

wBol1b subgroup does not appear to be significantly differentiated from uninfected sympatric populations
(wBol1a vs uninfected: p < 0.001; wBol1b vs uninfected: p
> 0.38; wBol2 vs uninfected: p < 0.001). This is not surprising given the two haplotypes found in association
with wBol1b are also observed in uninfected individuals.

Discussion and Conclusion

We then examined in detail the evidence for efficient vertical transmission and horizontal transmission rates for
wBol1 variants. Efficient vertical transmission and low
rates of horizontal transmission would be reflected in differentiation in mtDNA carried by infected and uninfected
individuals. We examined differentiation on the 12
islands where wBol1a is found sympatrically with uninfected individuals. All 70 wBol1a individuals on these 12
islands carried haplotype 1. This haplotype was found in
only one of 103 sympatric uninfected individuals. Thus,
there is clear differentiation between wBol1a-infected
individuals and their uninfected sympatric equivalents.

We investigated the evolutionary history of Wolbachia
infections in H. bolina using CO1 sequences from 298
specimens. Four general conclusions can be drawn from
this analysis, which we will discuss in more detail: (1) H.
bolina is paraphyletic at the mtDNA level, with up to 5%
divergence among haplotypes within what observational
and breeding studies indicate is one species; this pattern
likely follows from Wolbachia-driven introgression; (2)
wBol1, the infection competent to kill males, was found
with three different mtDNA haplotypes, and examination
of wBol1 genetic variation revealed the existence of two
cryptic subtypes, wBol1a and wBol1b, wBol1a being
found with a single mtDNA haplotype, and wBol1b with

In contrast to wBol1a, both wBol1b and wBol2 exist with
more than one mtDNA haplotype, and these haplotypes
are shared with uninfected sympatric individuals. Thus,
these infections are subject to either inefficient transmission or horizontal transmission or both, and we can gain
no definitive information concerning presence/absence of
a selective sweep.

the other two; (3) the haplotype observed in wBol1ainfected specimens is extremely rare among sympatric
uninfected specimens; in other words, mtDNA allows us
to infer that wBol1a has very low levels of effective horizontal transfer, and a very high effective vertical transmission rate (4) no mtDNA variation is found in the
haplotypes associated with wBol1a; this pattern is suggestive of a recent selective sweep; in contrast, the wBol2
infection is associated with a large diversity of haplotypes,
suggesting it is either ancient and imperfectly transmitted,
or shows a significant level of horizontal transmission.
H. bolina is associated with an unusual diversity of mtDNA
There has been an explosion of studies of mtDNA diversity in insects associated with DNA barcoding programmes [28]. These programmes generally find low
levels of intraspecific diversity (typically <1%), and high
levels of inter-specific diversity (typically >2%). Within
the barcoding ethos, there is a 'barcoding gap' between
intra and inter-specific variation, and high levels of diversity within a classical species lead to the hypothesis that
cryptic species are present. In our case we can be definitive
that the H. bolina specimens typed for mtDNA are of one
species notwithstanding the high level of diversity
observed. The evidence base for this derives from a series
of observations. First, where male-killing is active, there
are few if any sympatric haplotype 1 males with which
females can mate in the field, as these are killed by the
bacterium. In many islands, H. bolina is the only member
of the genus present, and thus H. bolina haplotype 2–10
males represent the only source of male partners. Second,
wBol1-infected individuals carrying haplotype 1 are collected from the field in copula with males of haplotypes 2–
10. Third, we have routinely maintained wBol1 matrilines
carrying haplotype 1 in the laboratory through crosses
with sympatric H. bolina males of divergent haplotypes.

The breakdown of barcoding as a reliable means of species
resolution seen in this case is relatively common in symbiont-infected species [29-31]. It can occur because symbionts drive introgression of mtDNA following
hybridization events – the transfer and spread of the symbiont results in spread of the mtDNA from the neighbouring species as observed in Drosophila [11,32], and Acraea
butterflies [12]. This hypothesis would be reflected in paraphyly in a species mtDNA. The best supported tree for
mtDNA in the Hypolimnas clade does indeed have H.
bolina mtDNA as paraphyletic, and we can statistically
exclude a monophyletic origin of H. bolina mtDNA. The
fact that the divergent mtDNA lineage is in tight association with the wBol1a strain strongly suggests this pattern
results from Wolbachia driven-introgression. This interpretation relies on the hypothesis that H. bolina males are (or
have been in the recent past) capable of producing fertile
female offspring following mating with females of other
Hypolimnas species (belonging to the H. antilope/H. octoc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/64

ula/H. pandarus group), which remains to be verified.
While barcoding studies can be a useful first step in species discovery (revealing potentially new cryptic species),
caution must be taken to rule out the action of symbiontdriven introgression as an explanation of unusually high
mtDNA diversity within a species.
Mitochondrial variation reveals cryptic Wolbachia
variation
Sequencing of the wsp or MLST genes revealed no molecular variation within the H. bolina male-killing Wolbachia,
wBol1. However, we observed that this infection was
found in association with very divergent mtDNA haplotypes (5% distinct). We therefore refined our examination
of wBol1 to look for fine scale molecular variation associated with more variable phage insertion loci, as found in
detailed studies of Wolbachia variation in Drosophila and
Culex [19,33,34]. Variation within wBol1 was observed,
and there was a perfect association in our tested specimens between the length of the amplified phage region
and mtDNA haplotype. The wBol1a strain, defined by the
large fragment, is by far the most frequent in this species,
and is found only alongside haplotype 1; wBol1b, defined
by the short fragment, is less common, and is found in
haplotypes 3 and 6.

What is not clear is how such micro-variation in the
mtDNA-Wolbachia association arose. If the transmission
of wBol1 has been strictly vertical since its establishment
in the species, then the mtDNA and wBol1 have both
diversified since this time, and the male-killer went extinct
in the majority of mtDNA haplotypes. If this hypothesis is
correct, then the level of mtDNA divergence between the
haplotypes (5%) implies that this infection has been in H.
bolina for a protracted period. Alternate scenarios rely on
horizontal transmission. One hypothesis is that following
the arrival of the infection in H. bolina, there was a single
horizontal transmission event to another mtDNA lineage
at some point in the past, moving the infection from one
haplotype into the other, followed by fixation of different
alleles at the locus in question in the two lineages. An
alternative hypothesis is that wBol1 arrived in H. bolina at
two points in the past, either from one single source or
two distinct sources outside the species.
High prevalence of wBol1a is associated with very high
vertical transmission rates
We observed that haplotype 1 was almost private to
wBol1a-infected individuals: out of 92 specimens carrying
haplotype 1, 90 were infected by wBol1a and only 2 were
uninfected. When the data are restricted to the 12 populations where mtDNA sequences were obtained from both
wBol1a and uninfected specimens, 70 wBol1a-infected
and 1 uninfected specimens carrying haplotype 1 were
found, alongside 102 sympatric uninfected individuals of
haplotype 2–10.

Had the spread of wBol1a through populations occurred
through horizontal transmission, this would be reflected
in the presence of wBol1a in the majority if not all sympatric mtDNA haplotypes. That there is a distinct partitioning
of mtDNA variation in our study clearly demonstrates that
the wBol1a male-killer infection in H. bolina shows effectively no ongoing horizontal transmission to individuals
of haplotype 2–10, and that vertical transmission is the
route by which wBol1a propagates over ecological time.
High prevalence can then be achieved in the presence of
very high transmission efficiency with low drive (i.e.
infected females produce a few more surviving adult
daughters than uninfected females), or lower transmission efficiency but with very strong drive (infected females
produce many more surviving adult daughters than uninfected females). There is evidence in our data, and in natural history observations, for the former hypothesis.
When transmission is inefficient, new uninfected lineages
are created that then carry the haplotype of the infected
one. If these are viable, then this haplotype will pass into
future uninfected individuals and their frequency will
build up over time until infected and uninfected lineages
carry the same mtDNA profile [14]. Given we know from
laboratory studies that uninfected haplotype 1 individuals
created by antibiotic treatment are viable and fertile [35],
the near absence of this mtDNA haplotype in sympatric
uninfected individuals implies either vertical transmission is very efficient, or that the infection is very recent
such that there has been insufficient time for the 'drip' of
the haplotype 1 to build a significant frequency in the
uninfected population. Three facts argue for the former.
First, we have yet to observe an 'inefficient transmission'
event in the laboratory [27] (Charlat unpublished
results). Second, the infection has been present on some
of these islands for over 100 years – sufficient time for
uninfected individuals of these haplotypes to build up
(Hopkins, 1927; Simmonds, 1923; 1926). Third, the
extreme prevalence seen on some islands (99% in Samoa)
is incompatible with transmission rates below 99.5% [2].
This system is thus compatible with the theory that very
high transmission efficiency predisposes to very high
prevalence. However, high transmission alone is insufficient to produce high prevalence. The same lack of uninfected females carrying haplotype 1 (that implies very
high vertical transmission efficiency) is observed throughout the species range, notwithstanding whether wBol1a
prevalence is 25% or 99% [2,8,27]. Thus, we can also infer
that perfect vertical transmission does not necessarily produce high prevalence. One possibility is that the equilibrium prevalence is very high, but most populations have
not yet attained equilibrium. Alternatively, other and as
yet unknown mechanisms might provide the explanation
for the variation in prevalence across H. bolina populations.

The contrasted evolutionary histories of wBol1 and wBol2
infections
The results of the present study permit certain inferences
to be made about the history of the association between
wBol1a and its host. The finding that the wBol1a-infected
population exhibits little variation in mtDNA sequence,
whilst the uninfected population maintains diversity, suggests that the male-killer infection has undergone a relatively recent selective sweep in this species. Simple
absence of diversity in mtDNA in a species can be associated with either a genome wide bottleneck effect or a
selective sweep on mtDNA alone. However, comparison
between the mtDNA diversity of infected and uninfected
individuals allows us to 'internally control' the history of
the genome. Where prevalence exceeds 50% of females,
the effective population size of infected individuals is
greater than that of uninfected individuals. In this case,
the neutral expectation is for higher diversity in infected
than uninfected individuals. In contrast, haplotypic diversity differs significantly between infected and uninfected
individuals, but it is the wBol1a infected population that
bears just the single mtDNA haplotype, and its diversity is
significantly less than found in the uninfected population.
We therefore conclude that the data indicate either a
recent spread of the male-killer into the population, or a
recent selective sweep of a new strain of an existing malekiller. The system is, in this respect, like that of male-killing Wolbachia in both Acraea encedon and Acraea encedana
[12], but in contrast to the equilibrium situation observed
in the male-killing Wolbachia/Drosophila innubila interaction [36].

We can also make some comments concerning the
dynamics and history of the wBol2 infection (non-malekilling) within H. bolina. The sharing of haplotypes
between wBol2-infected individuals and uninfected individuals indicates that this Wolbachia is either not perfectly
transmitted, or shows a low level of horizontal transmission, in contrast to the male-killing infection. In addition,
the finding that the wBol2 infection is associated with a
relatively diverse array of mtDNA haplotypes indicates
that, with the assumption that horizontal transmission is
rare, this infection has not undergone a recent selective
sweep and is not a very recent acquisition.
