Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the principal etiologic agent of human tuberculosis (TB) and a member
of the M. tuberculosis complex (MTC). Additional MTC species that cause TB in humans and other mammals include
Mycobacterium africanum and Mycobacterium bovis. One result of studies interrogating recently identified MTC
phylogenetic markers has been the recognition of at least two distinct lineages of M. africanum, known as West
African-1 and West African-2.
Methods: We screened a blinded non-random set of MTC strains isolated from TB patients in Ghana (n = 47) for
known chromosomal region-of-difference (RD) loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A MTC PCR-typing
panel, single-target standard PCR, multi-primer PCR, PCR-restriction fragment analysis, and sequence analysis of
amplified products were among the methods utilized for the comparative evaluation of targets and identification
systems. The MTC distributions of novel SNPs were characterized in the both the Ghana collection and two other
diverse collections of MTC strains (n = 175 in total).
Results: The utility of various polymorphisms as species-, lineage-, and sublineage-defining phylogenetic markers
for M. africanum was determined. Novel SNPs were also identified and found to be specific to either M. africanum
West African-1 (Rv1332523; n = 32) or M. africanum West African-2 (nat751; n = 27). In the final analysis, a strain
identification approach that combined multi-primer PCR targeting of the RD loci RD9, RD10, and RD702 was the
most simple, straight-forward, and definitive means of distinguishing the two clades of M. africanum from one
another and from other MTC species.
Conclusion: With this study, we have organized a series of consistent phylogenetically-relevant markers for each of
the distinct MTC lineages that share the M. africanum designation. A differential distribution of each M. africanum
clade in Western Africa is described.

Background
Mycobacteria that cause human and/or animal tuberculsosis (TB) are grouped together within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). The MTC is
comprised of the classical species M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium microti, and
Mycobacterium bovis (along with the widely used vaccine strain M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin [BCG])

[1-3], as well as newly recognized additions Mycobacterium caprae and Mycobacterium pinnipedii [4,5].
Although they are not presently officially described
microorganisms, “Mycobacterium canettii“ (proposed
name), the oryx bacillus, and the dassie bacillus are
additional widely-accepted members of the MTC [6-8].
M. tuberculosis is the predominant cause of human TB
worldwide but M. africanum and M. bovis remain
important agents of human disease in certain geographical regions. Of note, M. bovis is naturally resistant to
pyrazinamide, a first-line anti-TB drug [9], and so treatment of human TB caused by M. bovis should not
include pyrazinamide. Therefore, the correct identification of MTC isolates to the species level is important to
ensure appropriate patient treatment, as well as for the

collection of epidemiological information and for implementing necessary public health interventions.
Mycobacteriological laboratory methods have traditionally utilized a series of tests based upon growth,
microscopic, phenotypic, and biochemical properties in
order to segregate the classical members of the MTC
[10]. However, these tests can be slow-to-results, cumbersome, imprecise, non-reproducible, time-consuming,
may not give an unambiguous result in every case, and
may not be performed by every clinical microbiology
laboratory. The relatively recent identification of DNA
sequence level differences amongst the species of the
MTC has greatly improved our capacity for performing
molecular epidemiology, phlylogenetic structuring of the
MTC evolutionary tree, and MTC species determination. Molecular techniques, such as PCR, either alone or
followed by sequence analysis or restriction fragment
analysis (RFA), have proven particularly useful for the
characterization of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and/or chromosomal region-of-difference (RD)
loci (such as insertions, deletions, and rearrangements)
that are either lineage-, species-, or strain-specific [7].
Several groups have reported on the development of
molecular protocols for the definitive identification of
unknown MTC isolates to the species level by RD and/
or SNP analysis [2,7,11-13] and clinical laboratories are
now beginning to integrate such home-brew protocols
into their routine identification protocols for acid-fast
bacilli. The only currently available commercial protocol
for MTC species identification is the GenoType MTBC®
assay (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) that can differentiate M. tuberculosis from M. africanum, M.
microti, M. caprae, M. bovis, and M. bovis BCG [14-16].
However, this test is limited in that it cannot differentiate all species of the MTC and it is not commercially
available for diagnostic purposes in the USA.
In the past, M. africanum strains were generally identified by default, having first ruled-out both M. tuberculosis and M. bovis by the traditional battery of tests.
Two biovars of M. africanum were commonly described
that lay along the phenotypic continuum between M.
tuberculosis and M. bovis [17]. We now understand that
most strains formerly designated as M. africanum
subtype II strains were actually M. tuberculosis
[1,2,7,18-23], while strains formerly characterized as M.
africanum subtype I can be segregated into two distinct
genealogical clades on the basis of multiple genome
sequence-level differences [1,2,7,23]. Several names have
been given to each of the subtype I lineages in order to
distinguish them. In this report we refer to the subtype
I groupings as M. africanum West African-1 and M.
africanum West African-2 [24,25]. For reference, as first
described by Mostowy et al. [23], strains of M. africanum West African-1 (also known as clade 1 [26])

uniquely possess the long sequence polymorphism (LSP)
RD713, while M. africanum West African-2 (also known
as clade 2 [26]) carries the defining LSPs RD701 and
RD702. Huard et al. [7], recently confirmed the clade
specificity of these RDs, identified and validated the first
SNPs restricted to either M. africanum West African-1
or M. africanum West African-2, and placed several
additional previously known and novel polymorphisms
into a unified phylogenetic context vis à vis M. africanum West African-1 and M. africanum West African-2.
In the present study, we characterized the content of
known phylogenetically relevant RDs and SNPs in a
blinded, and M. africanum-enriched, set of MTC strains
isolated from TB patients in Ghana. The results of this
evaluation established the utility of several consistent
RD and SNP markers for M. africanum identification
and clade differentiation and allowed us to settle upon a
focused approach for future evaluations. In addition,
novel SNPs were identified and validated against a large
and diverse collection of MTC species and found to be
specific to either M. africanum West African-1
(Rv1332523) or M. africanum West African-2 (nat751),
thereby further expanding the limited number of genetic
markers that can be used to unambiguously differentiate
the two M. africanum lineages.

Methods
MTC strains analyzed

A total of 175 unique isolates that represent all of the
presently described members of the MTC were included
in the analysis and were derived from three strain collections, maintained at different institutions. One set of
strains (n = 47) came from the National Reference Center for Mycobacteria in Forschungszentrum, Borstel,
Germany and was collected in 2001-2003 from patients
with pulmonary TB in Ghana. This set of Ghana strains
was provided in a non-random blinded fashion but was
known to contain both M. africanum and M. tuberculosis (as controls). All strains were previously characterized using the GenoType MTBC® assay, as per the
manufacturer’s instructions, and these results were provided subsequent to the derivation of species identity
using RD markers. A complete listing of the Ghana collection isolates by strain number accompanies a recent
article by Wirth et al. [24] (excepting all M. bovis from
Ghana and the non-M. bovis strains 10514/01, 1473/02,
and 5357/02) and was recently made available as part of
the MIRU-VNTRplus database http://www.miruvntrplus.org/MIRU/index.faces[27]. Another 124 isolates
were of a well-described strain collection from the Weill
Medical College of Cornell University, New York. The
extensive molecular characterization of the Cornell

Vasconcellos et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/80

collection, and a complete listing by MTC species,
unique identifier, and origin, was previously reported
[7]. Only one isolate from that collection (M. tuberculosis strain W) was not included in the current evaluation.
This sampling was composed of “M. canettii“ (n = 5),
M. tuberculosis (n = 44), M. africanum West African-1
(n = 12) (note: given previously as M. africanum subtype
Ib), M. africanum West African-2 (n = 18) (note: given
previously as M. africanum subtype Ia), the dassie bacillus (n = 4), the oryx bacillus (n = 2), M. microti (n =
10), M. pinnipedii (n = 7), M. caprae (n = 1), M. bovis
(n = 14), and M. bovis BCG (n = 8). Lastly, 15 DNA
samples were provided from the collection of the
National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, the Netherlands [28]. These
included strains of M. tuberculosis (strains 13 and 22),
“M. canettii“ (strains 116 and 119), M. africanum West
African-1 (strain 92), M. africanum West African-2
(strains 6 and 85), M. microti (strains 25 and 62), M.
pinnipedii (stains 76 and 81), M. bovis (117 and 128),
and M. bovis BCG (2 and 71) (note: some strain identities are corrected as per [2,22]). The 4 strains underlined in the above were unique and the remaining 11
were also included in the Cornell collection [7]. All
strains from the Ghana collection were screened for
every marker of interest while strains of the Cornell and
RIVM collections were screened selectively, as described
in each respective section of the Results.
PGG Analysis

Frequently observed SNPs in the genes katG 463 and
gyrA95 are routinely assessed in order to broadly categorize isolates into defined MTC phylogenies, known as
principal genetic groups (PGG) [29]. The distribution of
SNPs in katG 463 and gyrA 95 suggests that PGG1 M.
tuberculosis strains more closely resemble the most
recent common ancestor of all M. tuberculosis strains
than PGG2 strains, and PPG2 strains more so than
PGG3 strains. MTC species along the M. africanum®M. bovis evolutionary track are also PGG1 [1,2].
SNP analysis of katG203 was used to further segregate
PGG1a isolates from PGG1b strains [7,30]. Representatives of each PGG were included in the Cornell collection of MTC strains.
MTC PCR-typing Panel

In previous reports we described [2], and then expanded
upon [7], a PCR-based protocol for the differentiation of
the various MTC species on the basis of genomic deletions. This MTC PCR-typing panel targets eight independent loci for amplification (16S rRNA, cfp32
[Rv0577], MiD3 [IS1561’], RD4 [Rv1510], RD7 [Rv1970],
RD1 [Rv3877-Rv3878], RD9 [Rv2073c], and RD12
[Rv3120]), each of which either results in an amplicon
of an expected size or fails, depending upon the

Page 3 of 16

genomic content of the MTC strain being evaluated.
The resulting band-pattern that is observed following
agarose gel electrophoresis is indicative of MTC species
identity. Of note, the RD12 target region in M. bovis
and M. caprae overlaps a specific LSP in “M. canettii“
(RD12can), while the RD1 target region in M. bovis BCG
overlaps a specific LSP in the dassie bacillus (RD1das).
With this protocol, the pattern of bands for M. microti
and M. pinnipedii are identical, while the pattern of
bands for the orxy bacillus is the same as that of M.
africanum West African-2. The MTC PCR-typing panel
has been successfully applied to collections of MTC
strains from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Kampala,
Uganda, in order to characterize the diversity of MTC
species within these locales [21,31].
PCR amplification primers and conditions

Purified DNA was prepared for PCR as previously
described [2]. For some strains, culture thermolysates
(80°C for 30 min) were used as the source of DNA in
PCR amplifications. The primers used for the MTC
PCR-typing panel, the RDRio flank multiplex, RD174,
RD701, RD702, RD711, RD713, in addition to targets
containing the the pks15/1 micro-deletions and SNPs at
aroA285, 3’cfp32311, gyrA95, gyrB1450, hsp65540, katG203,
katG463, PPE552148, PPE552154, narGHJI -251, RD13174,
rpoB1049, rpoB1163, Rv15101129, and TbD1197, were the
same as described earlier [7,32,33]. For analysis of the
loci RD8, RD9, RD10, RD701, and TbD1 additional new
site-specific 3-primer combinations were designed for
each, similar to as previously detailed [32], and each
included two deletion flanking primers and one primer
internal to the deletion. The 3-primer PCRs were each
designed to amplify a product of one size when the target locus is intact or to produce a different band size
when a known LSP is present. New primers were also
designed to amplify a 1069-bp nat gene fragment and
the SNP-containing targets in nat 751 and Rv1332 523 .
New primers, along with expected band sizes and the
PCR program used to amplify, are listed in Table 1. The
general PCR protocol was identical to that used previously [2,7]. PCR amplification from purified DNA was
performed using the following cycling conditions: Program 1a (with an initial denaturation step of 5 min at
94°C, followed by 45 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at
60°C, and 1 min at 72°C, and ending with a final elongation step for 10 min at 72°C) or program 2a (similar to
program 1a but with an annealing temperature of 65°C).
PCR testing of DNA thermolysates was performed in a
similar manner using the following cycling conditions:
Program 1b (with an initial denaturation step of 5 min
at 94°C, followed by 45 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min
at 60°C, and 4 min at 72°C, and ending with a final
elongation step for 10 min at 72°C) or program 2b

for RD loci, expected band sizes given as intact/deletion present

(similar to program 1b but with an annealing temperature of 65°C). Programs 1b and 2b were also used to
amplify from purified DNA when potential target PCR
fragments were greater than 1,250 bp. PCR products
were visualized as previously described by agarose gel
electrophoresis [2]. Negative or unexpected positive
PCR results were repeated at least once for confirmation. Importantly, all PCR tests included parallel samples
containing DNA of M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv (ATCC
27294T) and either M. africanum West African-1 strain
Percy16, M. africanum West African-2 strain ATCC
25420T, or M. bovis strain ATCC 19210T, where appropriate, as controls. All controls consistently provided the
expected results for each particular marker screened.
Negative control PCRs, lacking input DNA, were also
included to control for DNA contamination.
PCR of the nat gene (1069 bp) was performed by a
slightly different protocol. PCR Program 2a and a PCR
reaction mix in 50 μl, with 40 pmol of each primer, 5
mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1U Taq polymerase

(Invitrogen, Brazil), PCR-buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, pH 8.3) (Invitrogen, Brazil),
10% glycerol, and 10 ng of target DNA were used in
this case.
It should be noted that the M. africanum West African-1- and M. africanum West African-2-restricted
LSPs were amplified by RD flanking primers [23] and
analyzed as previously described [7] with the results
based upon a size estimation of the PCR products on
agarose gel. PCR amplification of RD713 in M. africanum clade 1 strains typically yields a 2,798 bp amplicon,
while amplification of this locus in other MTC strains
either results in a 4,248 bp product (PGG2 and PGG3
M. tuberculosis) or no PCR product (PGG1a MTC species with the partially overlapping RD7 deletion and
PGG1b M. tuberculosis which possess additional genomic content at this locus [7]). In PCR amplification of
RD711, most, but not all, M. africanum clade 1 strains
are expected to yield a 944 bp amplicon while the
remaining M. africanum West African-1 strains and

Vasconcellos et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/80

MTC species amplify a 2,885 bp product. With respect
to RD701, all M. africanum West African-2 strains are
expected to generate a 340 bp amplicon while strains
from the other MTC species amplify a 2,081 bp PCR
fragment. Likewise, for RD702, all M. africanum West
African-2 strains are expected to amplify a 732 bp product while strains from the other MTC species produce
a 2,101 bp PCR fragment. For this study, RD9 (as part
of the MTC PCR typing panel), TbD1, and RD701 were
evaluated by both 2-primer and 3-primer PCR tests.
SNP analysis by PCR-RFA and sequencing

Characterization of the SNPs at gyrA 95 , gyrB 1450 ,
hsp65 540 , katG 203 , katG 463 , narGHJI -251 , rpoB 1049 ,
rpoB1163, and Rv15101129 was performed by PCR-RFA
[7,33]. For the analysis of the SNPs in aroA 177 ,
3’cfp32311, mmpL6551, nat751, and TbD1197 novel PCRRFA procedures were developed, similar to those previously detailed [2,7]. The restriction enzymes and
expected digest band sizes for each PCR-RFA are listed
in Table 2. Amplified products from M. tuberculosis
H37Rv and a second appropriate MTC species (see
above) were included in all digest reactions as controls.
All unexpected digestion results were repeated least
once for confirmation. For each PCR-RFA evaluation,
the PCR fragments from at least one strain of each
digest pattern were sequenced in order to confirm the
presence or absence of the target SNP.
Because it was not possible to develop a PCR-RFA
based approach for characterization of the SNPs at
PPE55 2148 , PPE55 2154 , RD13 174 , and Rv1332 523 , SNP
analysis for these markers was performed by direct
sequencing of the PCR products. The same procedure
was used for verification of micro-deletions in the
pks15/1 locus [34]. In most cases, the primers for PCR
amplification primers were also used for sequencing, as
previously described [2,7], with the exception of the
1069 bp nat fragment which was also sequenced using
internal primers Table 1). Sequencing was performed
using the BigDye Terminator kit (PE Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer, either at the Cornell University BioResource Center (Ithaca, NY) http://
www.brc.cornell.edu or at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation
(PDTIS DNA Sequencing Platform/FIOCRUZ, Rio de
janeiro, RJ.); http://www.dbbm.fiocruz.br/PDTIS_Genomica/) and the results were analysed as previously
described [2,7].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

Gene fragment sequences containing novel SNPs were
submitted to GenBank for M. africanum West African-1
(Rv1332523; accession number FJ617580) and M. africanum West African-2 (nat 751 ; accession number
FJ617579). Previously identified polymorphic gene

fragment sequences are now available for M. africanum
West African-1 (aroA 285 [FJ617581] and TbD1 197
[FJ617582]) and M. africanum West African-2 (hsp65540
[FJ617583]; Rv15101129 [GU270931]; and rpoB variants
[FJ617584, FJ617585, FJ617586]).

Results
Genetic characterization of MTC isolates by PCR deletion
analysis

For this study we applied the MTC PCR-typing panel to
a blinded, M. africanum-enriched, challenge collection
of MTC strains isolated from patients with TB in
Ghana (n = 47). As a result, 18 M. tuberculosis isolates,
20 strains of M. africanum West African-1, and 9 M.
africanum West African-2 strains were putatively differentiated [7]. Strains were identified as M. tuberculosis
by the successful amplification of targets internal to the
RD9 and RD12/RD12can loci. Strains were identified as
M. africanum West African-1 on the basis of failure of
amplification of the RD9 locus but the successful amplification of the RD7 target region, while M. africanum
West African-2 strains were putatively identified on the
basis of failure of amplification of the RD9 and RD7
loci but the successful amplification of regions within
the RD1bcg/RD1das , RD4, and RD12 loci. No M. bovis
strains (which would have shown a pattern lacking in
amplicons for RD4, RD7, RD9, and RD12) or other
MTC species were identified (see ref. 7 for the expected
MTC PCR typing panel patterns of “M. canettii“, M.
microti, M. pinnipedii, and the dassie bacillus). Of note,
all strains amplified for the cfp32 (Rv0577) gene, a target that has been previously proposed to be MTCrestricted and may be necessary for pathogenesis
[2,7,35]. The segregation of M. tuberculosis from M.
africanum in this collection by the MTC PCR typing
panel paralleled the results derived from the GenoType
MTBC® assay, which assigned these isolates as either M.
tuberculosis (n = 18) or M. africanum subtype I (n =
29). These identifications were consistent with independently derived data for this strain set [24]. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical MTC PCR-typing panel profile for M.
tuberculosis, M. africanum West African-1, M. africanum West African-2, and M. bovis. A summary of all
molecular test results derived in this study is provided
in Table 3 and illustrated schematically in Fig. 2. With
respect to the RD markers interrogated above, note
their phylogenetic positions in Fig. 2 at nodes 1, 6, 9,
14, and 16-19.
An exception to the common M. tuberculosis MTC
PCR-typing panel profile occurred with 9 M. tuberculosis strains from Ghana, which failed to amplify the
IS1561’ target (see Fig. 1B). Previously, strains with this
particular band pattern were found to share a clonal
deletion called RD Rio that defines a major, newly

recognized, lineage of M. tuberculosis that is the predominant cause of TB in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and that
has disseminated to many countries around the world
[7,31,32]. However, multiplex PCRs for both the RDRio
LSP and the coincident RD174 deletion [32] showed
that these Ghanaian strains were not RDRio genotype M.
tuberculosis. Rather, data from the MIRU-VNTRplus

website identified these strains as being of the RD726harboring Cameroon genotype (ST61 and variants) and
lists the strains as lacking IS1561’ [27]. The Cameroon
genotype therefore appears to possess an undefined LSP
of IS1561’ that overlaps RDRio (Fig. 2; see node 4) and
the MiD3 locus in M. microti and M. pinnipedii (Fig. 2;
see node 16) [7,31].

phylogenetically relevant polymorphisms present at each juncture. TbD1-positive M. tuberculosis is also known as “ancient” M. tuberculosis and
TbD1-negative M. tuberculosis is also known as “modern” M. tuberculosis [1]. WA - West African.

In addition to the MTC PCR-typing panel, some PCR
targets used in SNP analysis, as will be described below,
amplify from genomic regions that are deleted is some
MTC species or lineages [7]. The successful amplification of the 3’cfp32 and RD13 loci in all the strains of
the Ghana collection confirmed the species distribution
obtained using the MTC PCR-typing panel, as these targets are deleted in either “M. canettii“ (Fig. 2; see node
1) or both M. caprae and M. bovis (Fig. 2; see node 17),
respectively [7]. Furthermore, PPE55 is located proximal
to IS1561’ and so the failure to amplify PPE55 from the

9 Cameroon genotype M. tuberculosis isolates is consistent with a single genomic deletion in the region of
IS1561’ (Fig. 2; see node 4). Lastly, TbD1 is an important phylogenetic marker that categorically divides M.
tuberculosis into two major lineages [1]. All M. tuberculosis isolates in the Ghana collection failed to amplify
from targets internal to TbD1 (Fig. 2; see node 2), while
all M. africanum clades 1 and 2 strains yielded an
amplicon of the correct size, consistent with the previous finding that isolates from the M. africanum®M.
bovis evolutionary tract are all TbD1-positive and likely

Vasconcellos et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/80

a branch off of a TbD1-positive M. tuberculosis lineage
[1,24].
We next evaluated the Ghana strain collection by PCR
(using LSP flanking primers) for RDs that have been
described previously as being either specific to M. africanum West African-1 (RD713), restricted to a subgroup of M. africanum West African-1 (RD711), or
specific to M. africanum West African-2 (RD701 and
RD702) [7,23]. All M. africanum West African-1 strains
(n = 20) yielded amplification products for RD711 and
RD713 of shorter band sizes that were consistent with
amplicons that bridge a deletion (Fig. 2; see nodes 7 and
8). All M. tuberculosis strains (n = 18) contained the
RD711 and RD713 regions, while each M. africanum
West African-2 strain (n = 9) yielded PCR fragments
suggestive of intact RD711. Each M. africanum West
African-2 strain (n = 9) also failed to produce any
amplification products from the RD713 locus region, as
expected, owing to the overlapping RD7 [7]. Likewise,
all M. africanum West African-2 strains produced shortened RD701 and RD702 amplicons (Fig. 2; see node
11), while each M. tuberculosis and M. africanum West
African-1 strain exhibited PCR fragments representative
of intact sequences within these loci. The M. africanum
clade-specific bridge-deletion PCR results were therefore
congruent with the MTC PCR-typing panel data.
A drawback, however, of the MTC PCR-typing assay
as it was designed is that overlapping polymorphisms
may occur in the target regions of the panel. Such
hypothetical LSPs would therefore have the potential to
cause a failure in amplification and to confuse the interpretation of banding patterns which may, in turn, lead
to erroneous species determinations. To begin to
address this issue, with respect to loci relevant to the
species within the current Ghana collection, we developed new 3-primer combination sets for RD8, RD9,
RD10, RD701, and TbD1 (Table 1). As was expected
from previous phylogenetic evaluations [1,3,7], each of
the test loci were found to be intact in the Ghana collection PGG2 M. tuberculosis strains, excepting TbD1.
Moreover, excepting RD9, each of the studied RDs were
intact in the M. africanum West African-1 strains, while
in the M. africanum West African-2 strains only TbD1
remained intact, i.e. the RDs 8-10 and RD701 were
deleted. Overall, no inconsistencies were observed with
respect to species identification within the Ghana MTC
strain collection across the different strategies for PCR
deletion analysis that were employed.
Genetic characterization of MTC isolates by SNP analysis

For the second stage of this study we screened the
Ghana MTC collection for known phylogenetically relevant SNPs. With respect to the M. tuberculosis strains,
we determined that all were PGG2 (n = 19) (Fig. 2; see

Page 10 of 16

nodes 3 and 5). Consistent with this determination, the
7-bp pks15/1 micro-deletion was observed in all the M.
tuberculosis strains; this polymorphism is positioned at
the same point along the MTC evolutionary tree as the
katG463 CTG®CGG SNP that marks PGG2 M. tuberculosis strains (Fig. 2; see node 3). Likewise, an SNP in the
narGHJI operon promoter (-215 C®T), that is phylogenetically coincident with TbD1 [33] was also present
in all of the Ghanaian M. tuberculosis isolates evaluated
(Fig. 2; see node 2). Lastly, the gyrB 1450 G®T polymorphism (also a target of the GenoType MTBC® assay
[14-16]) is known to coincide with the RD9 deletion
and likewise segregated the M. tuberculosis isolates
from the strains of the M. africanum strains (Fig. 2;
see node 6).
The following considers SNPs that inform the phylogenetic interrelationships among most of the non-M.
tuberculosis MTC species. First, all the M. africanum
strains (n = 28) were PGG1. Previously, an ACC®ACT
SNP at katG203 has been used to segregate PGG1 strains
into PGG1a and PGG1b [30]. Huard et al. [7] reported
that this SNP is present in M. africanum West African2 and all downstream species in the MTC evolutionary
tree (Fig. 2; see node 9). As expected, the Ghana collection M. africanum West African-1 strains were determined to be PGG1b, while the M. africanum West
African-2 strains were PGG1a by katG203 analysis. Additional inter-species-specific SNPs that colocalize with
the katG203 SNP and segregate the M. africanum clades
(and are also notably coincident with RD7, RD8, and
RD10) have also been reported at 3’cfp32 311 (G®A),
PPE55 2148 (A®G), PPE55 2154 (A®G), and RD13 174
(G®A), in addition to a 6-bp pks15/1 micro-deletion
(Fig. 2; see node 9) [7,34]. These loci were interrogated
and indeed found to partition the M. africanum West
African-2 strains from the M. africanum West African-1
and M. tuberculosis strains of the Ghana collection, consistent with previous reports [7,34]. Lastly, we also
screened for an inter-species-specific SNP in mmpL6551
(AAC®AAG) [1,7] that is not observed in M. africanum
West African-1, M. africanum West African-2, nor the
dassie bacillus, but is present in all of the remaining distal species along the oryx bacillus®M. bovis evolutionary track of the MTC phylogenetic tree [1,7,26]. As was
expected, we found mmpL6551 to be unaltered in the M.
africanum West African-1 and West African-2 strains of
the Ghana MTC collection (Fig. 2; see node 15). The
mmpL6551 SNP occurs within a TbD1 locus gene and
was thus deleted in the TbD1-negative M. tuberculosis
strains of the Ghana collection.
We then investigated SNPs that have been previously
described to be restricted to either M. africanum West
African-1 or M. africanum West African-2 within the
MTC [7]. SNPs at aroA285 (G®A) and TbD1197 (C®T)

Vasconcellos et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/80

were found to be limited to the M. africanum West
African-1 strains of the Ghana MTC collection, thereby
coinciding with the M. africanum West African-1-specific LSP RD713 (Fig. 2; see node 7). Point mutations at
Rv1510 1129 (G®A), hsp65 540 (C®G), and rpoB 1163
(C®T) were also screened and found to be restricted to
the M. africanum West African-2 strains (Fig. 2; see
nodes 10-12); a previously noted sublineage-specific
SNP at rpoB1049 (C®T) was not observed (Fig. 2; see
node 13). However, from previous data [7], only
hsp65540 has been shown to be truly M. africanum West
African-2-specific and to associate pylogenetically with
RD701 and RD702. In fact, Rv15101129 was previously
found to be an inter-species-specific SNP that M. africanum West African-2 shares with the dassie bacillus, and
is indicative of a common ancestor between these species, while not all M. africanum West African-2 strains
possess the rpoB1163 and rpoB1049 SNPs [7]. These latter
point mutations appear to have been acquired in a stepwise sequential order and to define the branch points of
sublineages within the M. africanum West African-2
species. All Ghana M. africanum West African-2 strains
evaluated in this study therefore fell into the second of
three potential rpoB sequence-based sublineage
branches. Overall, each of the known MTC inter-species-specific, species-specific, and sublineage-specific
SNPs for which the Ghana MTC collection was evaluated were entirely consistent with the current RD analyses and showed a species distribution that paralleled
previous descriptions [7].
Identification of a novel Mycobacterium africanum West
African-1-specific Rv1332523 SNP

In the process of sequencing the RD711 bridge amplicon to confirm its correct amplification in an M. africanum West African-1 strain, we noted a nonsynonomous
G®T SNP in the region 5’ of the RD711 deletion breakpoint and within the Rv1332 gene, affecting nucleotide
523 (Rv1332523; V175L). To investigate the distribution
of this Rv1332 523 SNP amongst the MTC species, we
generated a new primer pair to amplify the SNP-containing region upstream of RD711. We then performed
PCR and sequence analysis of the amplified products
upon samples from select MTC strains of the Cornell
collection representing each of the MTC species and
major M. tuberculosis lineages, i.e., “M. canettii“ (n = 2),
TbD1-positive M. tuberculosis PGG1 (n = 2), TbD1negative M. tuberculosis PGG1 (n = 2), M. tuberculosis
PGG2 (n = 2), M. tuberculosis PGG3 (n = 3), M. africanum West African-1 (n = 12), M. africanum West African-2 (n = 2), the dassie bacillus (n = 2), the oryx
bacillus (n = 2), M. microti (n = 2), M. pinnipedii (n =
2), M. caprae (n = 1), M. bovis (n = 2), and M. bovis
BCG (n = 2). Only the 12 M. africanum West African-1

Page 11 of 16

strains possessed the Rv1332523 substitution. When the
Ghana collection was subsequently evaluated (n = 47),
the Rv1332523 SNP was likewise restricted to the 20 M.
africanum West African-1 strains. In total, 85 MTC isolates were screened, 32 of which were M. africanum
West African-1. The data thus supported that the
Rv1332523 SNP is a specific marker for M. africanum
West African-1 and is only the third such polymorphism reported to date (Fig. 2; see node 7) [7].
Identification of a novel Mycobacterium africanum West
African-2-specific nat751 SNP

Previously, the nat (Rv3566c) gene product arylamine Nacetyltransferase has been investigated as a potential
contributor to reduced isoniazid susceptibility in M.
tuberculosis [36]. In the course of those investigations,
SNPs were identified in the nat gene that were
restricted to different M. tuberculosis lineages. We
found a novel nonsynonomous G®A SNP in two M.
africanum West African-2 strains at nat nucleotide 751
(nat751; E251K) upon amplification and sequencing of a
1069-bp nat fragment using samples from a subset of
MTC representative strains (RIVM collection; n = 15).
Test sequencing of the 1069-bp nat amplicon from 16
MTC strains from the Cornell collection supported the
limited distribution of the nat751 SNP. We then developed a PCR-RFA protocol for the nat751 SNP, amplifying a shorter product using new primers and employing
the restriction enzyme BcgI, and applied the protocol to
all strains of both the Cornell (n = 124) and Ghana collections (n = 47). Consistent with the preliminary test
results, all MTC isolates amplified nat successfully.
However, only the 27 M. africanum West African-2
strains possessed the nat 751 polymorphism, as determined by PCR-RFA. The West African-2 strains showed
a 4-band digest pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis as
opposed to the remaining MTC strains that showed a 3band digest pattern (see Table 2). Thus, this SNP
appears to be a specific marker for M. africanum West
African-2 (n = 175 unique MTC strains evaluated in
total) and is only the second SNP reported to be
restricted to this clade (Fig. 2; see node 11) [7]. Of note,
both the nat751 and hsp65540 M. africanum West African-2-specific SNPs are present in the genomic sequencing project of M. africanum strain GM041182 that is
currently nearing assembly completion http://www.sanger.ac.uk/sequencing/Mycobacterium/africanum/.

Discussion
M. africanum has been reported to be an important
cause of TB in the West African countries of GuineaBissau (52%) [37], The Gambia (38%) [38], Sierra Leone
(24%) [39], Senegal (20%) [17], Burkina Faso (18.4%)
[40], Cameroon (9%) [41], Nigeria (8%) [42], and Côte

Vasconcellos et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/80

D’Ivoire (5% of cases) [22]. M. africanum has also been
identified in the West African countries of Benin, Mauritania, and Niger [7,43]. Many of the previous M. africanum reports appeared, however, before molecular
markers distinguished two different clades within this
species [1,7,23,25,26]. Therefore, this study is one of the
few to use clade-specific molecular markers to investigate the diversity of M. africanum strains causing TB
within a specific African locale. Previous MTC species
surveys that characterized strains using truly informative
phylogenetic markers identified M. africanum West
African-1, but not West African-2, in Cameroon and
Nigeria [41,42] or M. africanum West African-2, but
not West African-1, in The Gambia [38,44] and GuineaBissau [23,45]. In contrast, with this study, we highlight
the fact that both clades of M. africanum are contributing to the TB burden in Ghana [24]. However, because
the Ghana MTC collection was not representative, the
current study does not allow us to estimate the proportion of TB caused by the various MTC clades in this
country. Such a systematic survey of MTC population
structure in Ghana is currently in progress.
In actuality, few reports have definitively shown an
overlap in the geographic ranges of M. africanum West
African-1 and M. africanum West African-2. Previously,
Huard et al. [7] studied isolates derived from patients in
Niger that constituted both M. africanum clades; both
lineages were likewise found to coexist in Sierra Leone
[39]. In the absence of a molecular analysis similar to
that presented herein, it is not known for certain which

Page 12 of 16

M. africanum clade predominates in many of the other
M. africanum-endemic West African countries or if their
ranges coincide elsewhere. However, a cross-comparison
of molecular epidemiologic evidence presented in some
earlier reports [17,46] and more recent data [7,41,43]
does suggest that M. africanum clades 1 and 2 may both
occur in at least Côte D’Ivoire, a country that borders
Ghana. The picture that emerges from the combined studies [7,17,22-24,30,37-48] is of a differential geographic
distribution of the M. africanum lineages, with West
African-1 predominating in Eastern-West Africa (Cameroon, Nigeria), West African-2 in Western-West Africa
(the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal), and the two clades
overlapping in Central-West Africa (Côte D’Ivoire,
Ghana, Niger, Sierra Leone) (Fig. 3). A conceptually similar gradient of M. africanum prevalence across Western
Africa was recently hypothesized by de Jong et al., but
their analysis did not make a distinction between the two
M. africanum clades [48]. Lastly, although TB caused by
M. africanum is concentrated in sub-Saharan West African countries, with immigration and international travel,
sporadic cases have also been reported in the USA, the
Caribbean, and Europe [28,43,49], including one outbreak of multi-drug resistant M. africanum at a Parisian
hospital [17,50]. With improved molecular methods of
identification, we expect that further cases of infection
will be identified outside of the traditional endemic areas
of M. africanum.
Molecular systems are preferred for the differentiation
of M. africanum from M. tuberculosis and M. bovis

Figure 3 Map of sub-Saharan West Africa illustrating the differential geographic distribution by country of the M. africanum clades.
Current evidence suggests that only M. africanum West African-1 is found in Eastern-West Africa (Cameroon, and Nigeria; black) and M.
africanum West African-2 alone is found in Western-West Africa (the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Senegal; speckled), but that the two clades
overlap in Central-West Africa (Côte D’Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, and Sierra Leone; grey).

given the heterogeneous phenotypic patterns among M.
africanum strains, and the prolonged time-to-results
and subjectivity inherent to the interpretation of some
tests. Importantly, previous data indicate that there are
no definitive phenotypic characteristics that can be
exploited to differentiate the individual M. africanum
clades [17,22,45]. In this study, we identified novel M.
africanum clade-defining SNPs and confirmed the MTC
distribution of several other phylogenetically relevant
markers among the MTC. Multiple validated intra-species-specific molecular markers are important because
they cross-corroborate each other and increase confidence in a given MTC species identification. By the
markers described herein, M. africanum West African-1
would be defined genotypically as possessing RD713 and
SNPs at aroA285, Rv1332523, and TbD1197, while M. africanum West African-2 would be defined genotypically
by RD701 and RD702, as well as the intra-species-specific SNPs at hsp65540 and nat751. Other SNPs and RDs
that mark particular branches of the MTC phylogenetic
tree, such as gyrB1450, Rv15101129, RD9, and RD10 are
also informative of M. africanum clade identity and provide further cross-referencing options. However, a
streamlined protocol that employs 3-primer PCRs for
RD9, RD10, and RD701 was the most rapid, simple,
straight-forward and definitive means of differentiating
the two clades of M. africanum from one another and
from other MTC species. This approach limits the number of individual PCR reactions required for identification and eliminates the need for secondary procedures,
such as restriction digestion, sequence analysis, or hybridization. Of note, some methods cannot distinguish the
two clades of M. africanum, such as the GenoType
MTBC line-probe assay [14-16]. Because PCR-RFA for
SNPs specific to one of the M. africanum clades, as
described herein, is a relatively simple approach, it may
be of benefit for confirmation of species identification in
laboratories with limited access to more advanced molecular methods. Other methods for M. africanum identification, such as by real-time PCR, microarray analysis,
and spoligotyping (a DNA typing method) may also present advantages to laboratories with these capabilities,
but these modalities were not evaluated in the current
study.
Indeed, all strains of M. africanum are also known to
lack spacers 9 and 39 in their spoligotype profile, similar
to M. bovis, but possess one or more spacers that are
consistently absent in certain other MTC species [7,25].
Previous data [17,23,37,46] suggest that many, but not
all, M. africanum West African-1 strains demonstrate
an absence of spacer 8 in addition to 9 and 39 (known
as spoligotype signature AFRI_2) [43], while M. africanum West African-2 strains may further uniformly lack
spacers 7-9 and 39 (known as spoligotype signature

Page 13 of 16

AFRI_1). As provided on the MIRU-VNTRplus website,
all M. africanum West African-1 strains from the
Ghana collection lacked spacers 8, 9, and 39, while each
M. africanum West African-2 strain from the Ghana
collection lacked spacers 7- 9, and 39 [27]. Spoligotyping
may therefore provide a preliminary indicator for each
M. africanum clade [51,52], however, the validity of
these associations remains to be conclusively determined
using a sample set of isolates with diverse geographical
origins.
In addition to identification, MTC species and sublineage specific markers are of importance for genealogical purposes, as they allow the construction of more
accurate phylogenetic trees. In recent years, SNP typing
has been used to group strains of M. tuberculosis
[53,54], while LSP analyses and DNA sequencing
approaches have been used to establish congruent phylogenies for the M. tuberculosis complex [25,51,55]. The
species- and sublineage-specific polymorphisms examined in this study for the M. africanum clades may
therefore be of benefit when characterizing the evolutionary history of MTC strain sets in the future. SNPs
in rpoB, for instance, demarcate the sequential divergence of sublineages within M. africanum West African2 [7]. Similarly, we previously highlighted that RD711 is
deleted in most, but not all of the RD713-harboring M.
africanum West African-1 strains that were evaluated
[7], and so defines a major sublineage within this species. (Studies that would use deletion of RD711 as the
single marker to define M. africanum West Aftican-1
strains may therefore risk mis-categorizing some isolates.) Nonetheless, all the M. africanum West African-1
strains in the Ghana strain collection had RD711 deleted
and, as part of another study [24], could be further subdivided phylogenetically based upon differences in
mycobacterial tandem repeats numbers. Although not
evaluated in this study, Mostowy et al. [23] recently
reported that RD742 was also variably distributed
among M. africanum West African-2 strains and a set
of phylogenetically informative SNPs for M. africanum,
different from those screened herein, has been published
[51]. Overall, the combined data illustrate the continued
evolutionary diversification of the M. africanum clades
and advance the process of organizing a set of variable
markers that may be used to construct meaningful phylogenetic trees for M. africanum. To this end, RD715
and RD743 were identified within M. africanum West
African-1 strains [23] and single nucleotide changes
located within the RD1 locus of M. africanum West
African-2 strains were recently noted in select strains
[38], but the utility of these polymorphisms as phylogenetic markers remains to be determined. It should also
be mentioned that at least one M. africanum-like strain
has been described with RD9 deleted, but RD7, RD10,

Vasconcellos et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/80

RD702, RD711, and RD713 intact [56]. Combined, these
data indicate that there is greater M. africanum/MTC
diversity yet to be characterized.
Our understanding of the nature of M. africanum as a
species and its position within the MTC has evolved
considerably in recent years. Based upon hard genome
level sequence evidence, the name M. africanum subtype II is no longer applied [2,7,20,22,23], while strains
denoted as M. africanum subtype I are now, ironically,
recognized to constitute two relatively genetically distinct lineages emerging from separate nodes along the
MTC evolutionary tree [1,7,25,26]. This opinion is reinforced by the data provided in the current report. Interestingly, the above mentioned unique M. africanum-like
strain was isolated from a patient originating from the
Democratic Republic of Congo, a central African country [56]. As it has been postulated that the MTC originated near the horn of Africa [57], this strain may
therefore be a remnant M. africanum precursor that
evolved from M. tuberculosis as humans migrated from
Eastern to Western Africa [55]. Indeed, the M. africanum clades possess the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of sequential intermediary genotypes in the
evolution of M. bovis from M. tuberculosis [1,7,24,26].
In so being, there have been suggestions that an M. africanum transmission cycle may exist between humans
and an unknown animal reservoir [23]. Reports of M.
africanum isolation from a bovine source in Nigeria and
from a goat in Guinea Bissau support this hypothesis
[37,42]. Therefore, a study of animal MTC isolates
employing genetic markers, such as those we have organized herein, should be made a priority effort to rule
out M. africanum as an important source of zoonotic
and/or anthropozoonotic TB in Western Africa.

Conclusions
With this study, we have organized a series of consistent
phylogenetically-relevant markers for each of the distinct
MTC lineages that share the M. africanum designation,
highlighting those polymorphisms that can be used for
specific clade identification. A review of molecular studies of M. africanum reveals a differential distribution
of each M. africanum clade in Western Africa. Because
M. africanum continues to be an important agent of disease, more M. africanum-focused studies are needed to
increase our understanding of MTC pathobiology, epidemiology, and evolutionary history, all of which could
lead to new strategies for TB prevention.
