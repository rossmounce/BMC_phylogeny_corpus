DISCOVERY NOTES

Lack of conservation of bacterial type promoters in
plastids of Streptophyta
Discovery notes

Vassily A Lyubetsky*, Lev I Rubanov and Alexandr V Seliverstov

Abstract
: We demonstrate the scarcity of conserved bacterial-type promoters in plastids of Streptophyta and report widely
conserved promoters only for genes psaA, psbA, psbB, psbE, rbcL. Among the reasonable explanations are: evolutionary
changes of sigma subunit paralogs and phage-type RNA polymerases possibly entailing the loss of corresponding
nuclear genes, de novo emergence of the promoters, their loss together with plastome genes; functional substitution
of the promoter boxes by transcription activation factor binding sites.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Dr. Arcady Mushegian, and by Dr. Alexander Bolshoy and Dr. Yuri Wolf (both
nominated by Dr. Purificación López-García).
Background
Genes evolve at different rates. Various hypotheses try to
explain, or at least to correlate, the evolutionary rate
(sequence conservation) and the functional properties of
the protein-coding gene. As far as we know, there is no
published evidence on searching for the plastid promoters at the genome scale. This problem should probably be
addressed separately for nuclear, plastome and mitochondrial genomes, different taxonomic lineages and different
RNA polymerase types. In particular, multisubunit RNA
polymerase (PEP), which has the core enzyme encoded in
plastome and the sigma subunit in nucleome, binds bacterial type promoters (PEP-promoters); and monosubunit
RNA polymerases (NEP), which is nucleome-encoded,
binds NEP-promoters. Here we report a study of PEPpromoters of plastome genes in representatives of the
green line (Viridiplantae, including Chlorophyta and
Streptophyta; Euglenozoa, Rhizaria, in particular Cercozoa; Glaucocystophyceae) and the red line (Rhodophyta,
stramenopiles, including Bacillariophyta, Pelagophyceae,
Raphidophyceae, Xanthophyceae; Cryptophyta, Haptophyceae, Apicomplexa). Add. file 1 describes the complete list of studied species with plastids, organized
according to the NCBI Taxonomy. Plastid genes are

believed to be evolutionarily conserved across large taxonomic lineages [[1], section 9.7c], although the authors
are unaware of systematic studies on their promoters
conservation. Instead, there is ample published research
on the promoter comparisons within small lineages,
largely the studies of the promoters and their transcription factors in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria [2]. Further, some pairs of closely related species have been
shown to possess largely diverged promoters [3,4]. We
have reported an evolutionary labile promoter for the
ndhF gene in a narrow lineage of dicotyledonous angiosperm plants and described four different promoter
types, which are likely to have replaced each other during
evolution [5].
In this study we aimed at searching for widely conserved PEP-promoters in plastomes of the above mentioned taxa. By "widely conserved" we mean the cases
when the regions upstream of orthologous genes across
the high-level taxonomic divisions can be aligned. The
promoters confined to only vascular plants or the red line
lineages are not examined here (e.g., the NEP-promoter
of gene clpP in vascular plants). In our analyses using the
fixed consensus as a query produced massive under-predictions, or, alternatively, massive over-predictions,
which suggests that querying without taking into account
the alignment of 5'-leader regions is obviously misleading.

Materials and methods
The regions of up to 1000 bp length upstream from all
protein-coding genes (90 genes per species at average) in
plastomes of species listed in Additional file 1 were
extracted from GenBank, and multiple alignments of the
regions were constructed. Searches of promoters were
conducted using two original algorithms: the first to preselect leader regions with candidate PEP-promoters (several candidates were found per region), and the second to
build a multiple alignment keeping one of the candidate
promoters in each of the regions. The alignment was constructed to reveal the two bacterial type boxes and cover
the taxonomic diversity of the above mentioned lineages
as wide as possible. In a positive prediction, the alignment
of the boxes, linker and some flanking regions was
required to have a good quality (see below). Otherwise, a
negative prediction is produced and a PEP-promoter is
not detected with our method. Evidently "positive prediction" means the prediction of a PEP-promoter and "negative prediction" means the lack of positive prediction.
Notably, the positive predictions contained experimentally proved PEP-promoters and often their TG-extensions, which indicates that these are not false positives.
Also, in all negative predictions the alignment had a considerably lower quality compared to the minimal quality
among all positive predictions. All predicted PEP-promoters were located within approximately 40 bp-long
highly conserved regions flanked by less conserved 3'areas and highly variable 5'-areas.
The idea of the first algorithm. Given is a set of n leader
regions. The goal is to find a subset of the set with one
potential promoter in each region such that their total
pair-wise similarity is maximal comparing to any other
collection of potential promoters in that subset; the subset size is simultaneously maximized. In order to increase
search speed, randomly selected regions are set as
"linked" and the promoter similarity is estimated only
within the linked pairs of regions. It formally means that
we consider a graph with n vertices, each assigned a
leader region, but only linked regions are connected by an
edge in the graph. As a result, the complexity of comparing all pairs of candidate promoters to determine their
total similarity is reduced in our algorithm by means of
considering a large number of randomly defined sets of
edges, i.e. randomly constructed graphs with n vertices
assigned the same regions but connected by different
edges. By doing so, the computing time becomes square
to number n of the regions and cubic to their average
length. The algorithm is designed for effective parallelization to enable mass processing of large amounts of long
regions in feasible time. The enhanced performance of
the parallel implementation allows to compute a solution
closer to the maximum quality of the alignment. The
algorithm is highly scalable and provides for the approxi-

mately linear growth of performance with the number of
available processors up to 2000.
The idea of the second algorithm. Along a fixed phylogenetic species tree, the algorithm aligns leader regions
with respect to one of the candidate promoters selected
by the first algorithm, from the promoter start up to the
start codon. It uses a common observation that promoters, as well as transcribed regions, can be well aligned, in
contrast to the region upstream of the promoter. The
algorithm takes a non-binary (which is often the case)
species tree and during the run reduces it to a binary tree
in a variety (or even all) possible ways. Each leaf of the
tree bears an orthologous gene leader region from the
corresponding species. The alignment is constructed as
follows. First, each leaf is assigned a nucleotide frequency
distribution at each position of the sequence: the distribution contains a unity for the observed nucleotide type
and three zeros for the unobserved. A zero distribution
contains four zeros. Then, at each inner node, two distribution sequences at its descendant nodes are aligned by
any applicable algorithm, with an award for matching two
distributions not pre-defined, but calculated anew at each
position j taking into account the length of each descendant branch. The award is estimated as a scalar square of
the difference between two nonzero distributions
weighted for different nucleotide types. The penalty for
inserting a gap symbol (i.e., for the alignment of zero and
nonzero distributions) is a decreasing function of the
number of contiguous gaps: the longer the gap region, the
lower the penalty. Two zero distributions are forbidden to
align. At each position of the alignment, the distribution
in the ancestral sequence is a half-sum of the two distributions in the descendants. When the root distribution
sequence is constructed, the algorithm projects the gaps
along the tree to its leaves onto the extant sequences, thus
obtaining the final multiple alignment. The complexity is
linear to the number of leaves. Different binary tree resolutions are compared on the basis of the corresponding
alignment quality, which is estimated as follows:
Ns

(N a + N s )b + ∑ (b + s)(l i − 1) + N bc , where Na is the
j =1

number of totally conserved (containing the same character) single columns, Ns - the number of totally conserved
regions (two or more contiguous totally conserved columns, li is the number of columns), Nb - the number of
"nearly" conserved columns (with one non-matching
character); b, c and s are parameters. Computing an alignment of 16 sequences with the length of 120-223 bases
requires less than one second on a 3 GHz Pentium-4 PC.
The automatically computed alignments were manually
checked and minor corrections were introduced if so
required. Both algorithms are implemented as 32-bit
command line utilities written in ANSI C, which can be

compiled with many popular compilers and run under
Windows or Linux. The algorithms and their detailed
descriptions are available from [6,7].
Testing of the algorithms and their comparison with
"common" local alignment algorithms (see the introduction and the list of references in [8]) are described in [911].

Results
Table 1 contains the species from add. file 1 predicted to
possess at least one widely conserved promoter in the
plastome. Predictions are identical for their close relatives
with a corresponding orthologous gene (not shown).
Within flowering plants the promoter sequences are similar and well aligned, therefore we illustrate results on
Arabidopsis thaliana and Spinacia oleracea only. The five
positive predictions are described below. Our analyses
suggest that widely conserved promoters are absent elsewhere in streptophyte plastomes.
Gene psbA (protein D1 of the photosystem II active
center) in plastomes. Promoters of this chloroplast gene
were experimentally studied in selected species, including Arabidopsis, mustard, and spinach [3,12,13], for
which our predictions are in good agreement with the
experiment. The algorithm predicted candidate conserved promoters upstream of this gene in most Streptophyta, primary and secondary endosymbionts,
Bigelowiella natans from the Chlorarachniophyceae, and
Cyanophora paradoxa from the Glaucocystophyceae (ref.
to Fig. 1, psbA). The gene alignments are given in Fig. 1,
per-site nucleotide frequency distributions are given in
Fig. 2 (constructed with the Weblogo program [14]). We
suggest that this ancient promoter with the consensus
TTGACA-15-TGTwATAmT is ancestral for at least all
Streptophyta. The linker between the boxes is usually 18
bases long, but is 17 bases in Cycas taitungensis, Adiantum
capillus-veneris, Staurastrum
punctulatum,
Mesostigma viride and B. natans. Many predictions possess the 5'-extension (TG or TGTG) of the "-10" box,
which enhances the promoter efficiency. In the gymnosperm C. taitungensis, the predicted "-35" box essentially
differs from the alignment consensus and the bacteriallike promoter. The psbA promoter was not found in the
hornworts Anthoceros formosae, although in other bryophytes it is highly conserved. In the early emerging alga
Chlorokybus atmophyticus only the "-35" box was identified, while the complete promoter was found in M. viride.
Two dodder species (Cuscuta gronovii, C. obtusiflora)
with a largely reduced plastome also lack the psbA promoter, which, however is found in their close relatives (C.
exaltata, C. reflexa) and most angiosperm plants. The
lack of promoters correlates with the reduction of
genomes: Cuscuta gronovii and C. obtusiflora do not photosynthesize and lack most of the photosynthetic genes.

Although the psbA gene retains an open reading frame, it
lacks the PEP-promoter and is probably poorly expressed
compared to photosynthetic species.
Gene psbB (a chlorophyll apoprotein of photosystem II
CP47) in plastomes of Streptophyta. For this gene, the
transcription start is experimentally identified in spinach
(S. oleracea) [15]; it adjoins the 3'-end of the accordingly
named sequence in Fig. 1, psbB. A conserved promoter is
predicted in most vascular plants: in angiosperms (A.
thaliana, S. oleracea), gymnosperms (Cycas taitungensis,
Cryptomeria japonica, Welwitschia mirabilis, Pinus spp.)
and pteridophytes (Adiantum capillus-veneris, Angiopteris evecta, Psilotum nudum, Huperzia lucidula). A
related promoter is predicted in some algae (Chaetosphaeridium globosum, Chara vulgaris, Staurastrum punctulatum,
Zygnema
circumcarinatum,
Chlorokybus
atmophyticus, Mesostigma viride), ref. to Fig. 1, psbB.
This promoter is highly conserved in C. taitungensis, C.
japonica, pteridophytes and streptophyte algae C. globosum, C. vulgaris, S. punctulatum, and less conserved in Z.
circumcarinatum, C. atmophyticus and M. viride. It possesses the "-10" box TG-extension. In the early branching
C. atmophyticus and M. viride, several potential promoters are predicted in 5'-leader regions; however these cannot be unambiguously added to the alignment of
Streptophytina (Fig. 1, psbB), especially in the regions
between the boxes and start codons. Therefore, the promoters closest to the start codon are selected and shown
for C. atmophyticus and M. viride. In bryophytes (Aneura
mirabilis, Anthoceros formosae, Marchantia polymorpha,
Physcomitrella patens), a conserved promoter was not
found. Notably, the psbB sequence of A. mirabilis is annotated as a pseudogene in NCBI GenBank. The usual
linker of 18 bp between the boxes is reduced to 17 bp in
W. mirabilis and some algae (C. atmophyticus, S. punctulatum, Z. circumcarinatum). In the pines Pinus koraiensis
and P. thunbergii, the sequence differences are not shown
(they occur in between the end of the sequence in Fig. 1,
psbB and the conserved processing site shown in Fig. 3).
Gene psbE (photosystem II cytochrome b559 protein
alpha subunit) in plastomes of Streptophyta. Promoters
were predicted in most land plants and the algae Chaetosphaeridium globosum, Staurastrum punctulatum,
Zygnema circumcarinatum, ref. to Fig. 1, psbE. Negative
predictions were obtained for the algae Chara vulgaris,
Chlorokybus atmophyticus and Mesostigma viride, even
though the region is conserved in their closer relatives.
This gene is a pseudogene in the Aneura mirabilis plastome.
Gene rbcL (the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase) in plastomes of Streptophyta. The
promoter was experimentally characterized in spinach (S.
oleracea) [13], and mustard (Sinapis alba) [12]. It was
predicted in all land plants and in the streptophyte algae

Gene psaA (apoprotein A1 of photosystem I P700) in
plastomes of Streptophyta. Promoter and the transcription initiation site for this gene were experimentally characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana [16]. In Aneura
mirabilis it is a pseudogene. The promoter was predicted
in almost all land plants and streptophyte algae, except
for Chlorokybus atmophyticus and Mesostigma viride, see

Fig. 1, psaA. This promoter differs from all other predictions and the bacterial σ-70 promoter. Its "-10" box consensus is CATAAT, which differs from the bacterial type
at the first position. At the 5'-end of the box a conserved
putative extension is found with the consensus TrTGT.
The predicted "-35" box is even more divergent from its
counterparts, despite being located within a long conserved region.
Although the alignments shown Fig. 1 are unambiguous within the lineages, neither can be extended onto the

Figure 3 The 5'-leader regions upstream of gene psbB. In the cells of first column only first occurrences of each taxon name are given. Numbers
to the left of the sequences are distances from the 5'-edge to the start codon, which location is specified in the last column ("c" stands for complement
sequences). In spinach the region is located precisely between the mRNA cleavage site and the start codon. Conserved putative mRNA-protein binding sites downstream of the cleavage site are shown in green. Conserved putative ribosome binding sites close to the start codon are in yellow.

Euglenozoa, Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, Cryptophyta,
diatom and other algae with plastids similar to those of
the Rhodophyta, see add. file 1.
Normally, the entire promoter region, not only the
boxes, is more conserved comparing to the rest of the
leader region, which hampers distinguishing between
regulated and non-regulated promoters.
We illustrate the comparison between wide and local
conservations on the PEP-promoters of genes ycf1, rps4
and psaJ. The promoters were experimentally identified
in Arabidopsis thaliana. These genes are among the 85
protein-coding genes in the plastome of A. thaliana.
They are not widely conserved.
The ycf1 gene encodes an unknown function protein
and has PEP-promoter ycf1-34 with a smaller distance
between the "-35" and "-10" boxes than normally [3]. This
promoter overlaps with NEP-promoter ycf1-39. PEP-promoters very similar to ycf1-34 with unambiguous multiple alignments of the 5'-UTR regions are found in most
eudicotyledonous, magnoliid and basal magnoliophyte
plants. Some species (including Cucumis sativus) possess
a much longer 5'-UTR region, while in others (including
Ranunculus macranthus) the ycf1 PEP-promoter is not
found. In monocotyledonous (Liliopsida), gymnosperm
and pteridophyte plants possessing the ycf1 gene, its
putative PEP-promoters are found but differ considerably
from those in eudicotyledons, magnoliids and the basal

Magnoliophyta. The promoter in A. thaliana is most similar to that from the cycadophyte Cycas taitungensis.
In A. thaliana the gene rps4 encoding ribosomal protein S4 has PEP-promotor rps4-123 [3]. Similar promoters with unambiguous 5'-UTR multiple alignment are
found only in selected species of Brassicaceae: Arabis hirsuta, Barbarea verna, Crucihimalaya wallichii, Draba
nemorosa, Lepidium virginicum, Lobularia maritima,
Nasturtium officinale and Olimarabidopsis pumila. The
plastomes of B. verna, D. nemorosa, L. maritima and O.
pumila contain single nucleotide insertions in between
the boxes;Arabis hirsute has a single nucleotide deletion.
The promoter region is variable even across close species
(Aethionema cordifolium, A. grandiflorum, Carica
papaya, Citrus sinensis) but their 5'-UTR regions can still
be well aligned.
A. thaliana was experimentally found to possess a Sig2dependent promoter upstream of gene psaJ encoding
photosystem I active center subunit IX, with a 37 nucleotide-long 5'-UTR [17]. Although well aligned across all
eurosids II, its 5'-UTR regions are conserved only within
Brassicaceae and diverge already in C. papaya.

Discussion
Conserved promoters are found in the monophyletic
Streptophyta and in two distant species, B. natans and C.
paradoxa. Notably, even though B. natans belongs to the

Lyubetsky et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:34
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/34

Cercozoa, its plastome is similar to that of green algae
[18]. On the contrary, the plastome of C. paradoxa is different in many respects [19,20].
There are many reasons why PEP-promoters upstream
of the protein-coding plastome genes are scarce. Their
loss may be related to the evolutionary changes of sigma
subunit paralogs and phage-type RNA polymerases that
lead to rapid replacements of the PEP-promoter. Indeed,
the PEP sigma subunits vary already between maize, poplar and thale cress: e.g., maize possesses two Sig2 paralogs
and lacks Sig4, while in poplar sig4 is a pseudogene, and
thale cress possesses a Sig4 and only one Sig2, [21]. Also,
promoters can be lost with their nuclear sigma subunitencoding genes, such as the Sig4-dependent ndhF promoter in poplar [5]. Some dicotyledonous plants, including Arabidopsis and Nicotiana, have gained the additional
phage-type RNA polymerase RpoTmp, which is active in
chloroplasts and mitochondria of these plants but is
missing from monocotyledonous plants (unpublished
dissertation by K. Kühn, 2006). Only one phage-type
RNA polymerase, RpoTp, is known from plastids of
monocots (Zea, Triticum), two phage-type RNA polymerases - from plastids of dicots (Arabidopsis, Nicotiana): RpoTp in chloroplasts and RpoTmp in both
chloroplasts and mitochondria. The moss Physcomitrella
patens also has two phage-type polymerases, RpoT1 and
RpoT2, which target both chloroplasts and mitochondria
[22]. Promoters can emerge de novo, as has been shown,
e.g., for the ndhF promoter [5]. Others are lost together
with plastome genes, e.g., the chlL promoter in flowering
and some other plants (according to the GenBank
records). Another possible factor in rapid promoter turnover in plastids may be tissue-specific differentiation of
plastid types, especially in vascular and, particularly,
flowering plants, which evolved a rich diversity of sigma
subunits [21] and phage type RNA polymerases. Often
the promoter boxes are functionally substituted by the
transcription activation factor binding sites [4].
In parasitic, non-photosynthesizing plants, such as
dicotyledonous dodder (Cuscuta spp.) and liverwort
Aneura mirabilis, many chloroplast genes are pseudogenes [23] and promoters of these genes are lost too. The
promoter conservation might become lower in the presence of alternative promoters. The promoter might have
undergone rapid evolution [3,5] and become unrecognizable. It also might be located beyond the 1000 bp distance
from the start codon and thus be overlooked in our analyses.
Given these multiple reasons to expect fast evolution
and rapid turnover of the chloroplast promoters, one may
ask why some of them, such as the five promoters
described above, are so widely conserved? One possible
explanation is that three of the conserved promoters regulate the expression of the photosystem components and

Page 8 of 11

that the stability of the promoter structure is important to
maintain high expression of genes psbA, psbB, psaA; due
to the light-dependent translation regulation of psbA, a
high amount of mRNA is built up in the dark and translated under light [24]. Conserved promoters upstream of
psbA and psaA may also be required to form polycistronic mRNAs, which encode, along with the photosystem components, tRNA and proteins involved in
translation that also have to be expressed at high levels:
psbA appears to belong to the same operon as histidine
tRNA, while psaAB and rps14 are in an operon with
methionine tRNA. The psbEFLJ operon and psbBTHpetBD operon might be formed likewise. The other conserved promoter regulates rbcL, the large subunit of a key
enzyme involved in the carbon dioxide fixation during
the Calvin cycle, the most abundant enzyme in the biosphere, whose gene also must be highly expressed. When
a gene is highly transcribed and regulated by a single promoter, the selection pressure prevents any considerable
change in the promoter's structure to provide for its
effective binding to the polymerase.
Relatively lower conservation of the PEP-promoters of
housekeeping genes (viz., tRNA, rRNA, ribosomal protein and PEP subunit-encoding genes, etc.) might be
explained by the presence of NEP transcription: e.g., the
rpoB transcription is entirely NEP-mediated, although
most genes possess both PEP and NEP-promoters. This is
the case of the ycf1 and clpP genes, which were experimentally shown in Arabidopsis thaliana to be under several promoters recognized by PEP with different subunits
and two NEP, RpoTp and RpoTmp, [22].
Operonic organization and RNA polymerase competition are important factors explaining the effect of genome
rearrangements on the evolution of promoters. Thus, the
loss of the common ndhF promoter and the emergence of
a new one upstream of gene ndhF in poplar (Populus
alba, P. trichocarpa) concur with the deletion of a neighboring gene [5].
Some conserved promoters might be overlooked. For
instance, the well studied psbC promoter is located within
a coding region of other gene (according to the GenBank
records) and its conservation cannot be assessed without
estimating the synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitutions ratio, which is yet to be incorporated in our
approach. Similar promoter-like regions were observed
within other coding areas (unpublished data), but their
role awaits explanation.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Arcady Mushegian, Stowers Institute
The manuscript by Lyubetsky et al. examines the conservation of promoters in the choroplast genes of Streptophyta. The evidence is presented that, across large

Lyubetsky et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:34
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/34

evolutionary distances (i.e., larger than the flowering
plants clade) only a handful of promoter sequences contains conserved regions. This is an interesting observation suitable for publication in the Discovery Notes
section of Biology Direct.
1) 1st paragraph: the authors assert that there is no
published evidence on searching for promoters at the
genome scale. This is not true and needs to be qualified:
there are many papers about eukaryotes and several
about either methods to detect or databases of detected
promotors in various groups of bacteria, some of which
have been obtained using intergenomic conservation as
one of the criteria. Citing the research behind J.ColladoVides databases or RegulonDB might be in order.
Response: This sentence lacks the word "..plastid.."
which occurs widely in our text and is present in the title.
We now refer to the works by professor Collado-Vides
[2], which contain references to databases on promoters
and regulation factors including the RegulonDB database.
These databases and other citations in [2] are related to
selected gamma-, alpha-proteobacteria and eukaryotic
nucleoms. We do not see them as directly related to the
"searching for the plastid promoters at the genomic
scale". Particularly, the RegulonDB database does not
contain photosynthesis and many other plastome genes
because they lack in E. coli. The intergenomic conservation ideology is used in our algorithms [6,7] but in a form
different from that in [2].
2) Methods: references 4 and 5 are links to the authors'
website with the documentation of their software. Why
the reliance on the original code instead of the established methods of motif search and sequence alignment?
Please explain crucial differences in the algorithms and
how the homegrown ones were tested.
Response: Studies [9,10] report testing of the "first"
algorithm in our approach in the comparison with established local alignment algorithms. The "second" algorithm and its testing was reported during a conference
[11]. Widely used "standard" programs did not produce
better promoter predictions (they are described in [8] and
many related references). An explanation might be that
we define a PEP-promoter as two boxes separated by a
region (sometimes with a TG extension) variable in terms
of structure and length; the imposed requirements are
the degree of the variability of this region, the linker
between the "-10" box and the start codon and the 5'-end
of the "-35" box. The alignment of leader regions was
built based on the precomputed two-boxed structures. It
is more efficient to build it along a (usually known) species tree and not construct the alignment and the tree
anew together as some approaches do. Ideologically the
algorithms are described in the text, full details are given
in [6,7] and demonstrate their different performance
comparing to other published methods.

3) A suggestion that may help to provide a more complete picture of the evolutionary trends in chloroplast
promoter conservation: A. thaliana chloroplast has 85
protein-coding genes. Can we have a table that shows, for
each gene, how broadly its promoter is conserved?
Response: The "Results" section now contains an analysis of PEP-promoter conservation upstream some coding
genes in A. thaliana. An analysis of all 85 genes would be
a subject for a separate publication. We show (as also
noted in [5]) a typical problem in finding non-widely conserved promoters. Thus, well studied gene ndhF in A.
thaliana is found to have only one PEP-promoter out of
the four types known in Magnoliophyta, which is conserved across the Brassicaceae and predicted in all
sequenced eurosids II and in Vitis vinifera [5]. Chloroplast PEP-promoters are experimentally unidentified for
many coding genes in A. thaliana, while for many they
are [3]. These promoters are conserved also in the Brassicaceae but already in eurosids II their recognition
depends on imposed cut-offs and requires biological validation. For widely conserved promoters over-prediction
is much lower than for promoters conserved within a thin
lineage where the leader regions did not diverge to a
noticeable extent.

Reviewer's report 2
Alexander Bolshoy, University of Haifa (nominated by
Purificación López-García, Université Paris-Sud)
In the paper of Lyubetsky et al. conservation and variability of the plastid promoters is studied, and, to the best
of my knowledge, for the first time at the whole genome
level. Undoubtedly, the problem is important and nontrivial. The authors obtained unexpected result: promoter regions in plastids are less conservative than corresponding coding sequences. To identify promoters the
authors proposed an original method of searching short
motifs surrounded by certain other motifs. Thus, the proposed article includes an interesting problem, original
methods to solve it and non-trivial results of analysis of
promoter regions. It makes this article suitable for publication in the Discovery Notes section of Biology Direct.
My remarks:
1) In Background section you use a term "lower conservation". Can you show how have you compared protein
conservation with promoter conservation? Response:
Comparing to the PEP-promoters, their regulated proteins are always widely conserved and well aligned. A
family present in vascular pants is almost ubiquitous,
while known widely conserved PEP-promoters are only
five. PEP-promoters might be more abundant than NEPpromoters: the knockout of RpoTp-NEP is not lethal for
A. thaliana, while the PEP-promoter loss (e.g. in Epifagus
virginiana) entails the loss of numerous genes. The
authors are unaware of detailed estimates.

2) In Background section you use the term "widely" to
indicate that the leader region sequences upstream
orthologous genes can be aligned across high-level taxonomic divisions. Please, give some details for better
understanding of the term "widely conserved"?
Please refer to Response #3 to Yu.W.
3) In Background section the following phrase "... using
the fixed consensus as a query produced massive underpredictions, or, alternatively, massive over-predictions..."
needs some explanation.
Response: A simple approach to the promoter search is
to define a conserved query mask. Using masks very close
to, e.g., the bacterial sigma-70 consensus, will lead to
under-predictions because reliable PEP-promoters of different structure will be overlooked. Using diverged masks
will lead to numerous false predictions. We believe that
using a fixed per-site nucleotide frequency queries is not
a perspective.
4) Materials and methods. Please, give a short description of your algorithms.
Response: We developed an original approach to the
promoters search. At the first stage we find a two-boxed
signal via local multiple alignment (the first algorithm,
ref. to Response to A.M #2). For each leader region the
algorithm predicts a number of candidate "-35" and "-10"
boxes. The second algorithm aligns the promoter region,
about 20 nucleotides upstream its "-35" box and the transcribed region up to the start codon (the part of the alignment is given in Fig. 1) and chooses the putative boxes
taking into account the distance between them (typically
17-18 nucleotides) and their affinity on the species tree
(closer species have more similar sequences). The algorithms are described in detail in [6,7].
5) Results. Why the authors insist to strengthen differences between plastid REP-promoter of psaA gene and
bacterial σ-70 promoters?
Response: The psaA leader regions have a reliable long
alignment, which accents the fact that this promoter considerably differs from the bacterial sigma-70 consensus.

Reviewer's report 3
Yuri I. Wolf, National Center for Biotechnology Information (nominated by Purificación López-García, Université
Paris-Sud)
The authors report the virtual lack of conservation of
Plastid-Encoded Polymerase promoters among the various lineages of plants. The finding is quite noteworthy
and would be of interest to those who study the evolution
of regulatory elements and plastid genomes.
1) p. 2. "Plastid genes and their promoters are believed
to be evolutionarily conserved across large taxonomic
lineages". This is a strong statement that requires at least
a couple of references, indicated who, when and in what
form expressed these beliefs.

Page 10 of 11

Response: In [2, 9.7c] (this reference is added) the
authors state that "The structure of chloroplast... genes is
widely conserved across lineages. Their evolutionary rate
is much lower than that of nuclear genes." This seems to
be a common knowledge from textbooks (references can
be added if necessary). Our logic was first straight: highly
conserved genes cannot have low conserved promoters.
But out results show the opposite. The phrase "and their
promoters" is now removed.
2) p.3 and throughout. "The term "widely" is used to
indicate...". The authors attempt to clarify the usage of the
term "widely", but actually just substitute it by no less
vague "across high-level taxonomic divisions". I suggest
to specify the "high-level taxonomic divisions" used in the
definition of "widely" and avoid the italicized usage of this
term further in the text.
Response: An alignment was called "widely conserved"
when included the Magnoliophyta and at least two representatives (at least one must not be a vascular plant) from
Cycadophyta, Coniferophyta, Gnetophyta, Moniliformopses, Lycopodiophyta, Marchantiophyta, Bryophyta,
Charophyceae, Coleochaetophyceae, Zygnemophyceae,
Mesostigmatophyceae, Chlorarachniophyceae or Glaucocystophyceae. Each high lineage from Fig. 1 is represented by few species because other species can usually
be unambiguously aligned. These lineages are unbalanced in terms of molecular taxon sampling and are here
represented by similar numbers of species. The term
"widely conserved" will hopefully be given a more precise
definition in the future.
3) pp. 4-6. The gene-specific section of the Results
reads like a verbal narration of the content of the Table 1.
It is not clear why the authors need such a detailed listing
of facts that don't seem to lead to any particular conclusions. I would recommend considering the possibility of
removing this part from Results altogether, joining
Results and Discussion and use the extra available space
to somewhat expand the Methods section.
Response: The "Results" do not just state the fact of the
widely conserved promoter and its distance from the
gene (which is indeed evident from Table 1) but also comparisons of the orthologous gene promoters supported by
the alignment analyses and interpretations of published
data. The authors believe this section should be kept at
least structurally. It might be technically merged with the
Discussion but its contents should remain. Discussion
elements in the Results are directly related to the details
described. If the note is to be reduced, we argue for moving Fig. 2 (and, if needed, Table 1) into the supplementary
data.
4) Promoter blocks for different genes seem to be
aligned, but all shown sequences have different lengths.
This leads to a seemingly paradoxical result - the magenta
mark for the experimentally identified transcription initi-

ation site in psbB of Spinacia oleracea highlights an
empty space.
Response: The Figure 1 shows a good alignment, which
length cannot be amended. If the psbB alignment is
appended some columns to the right, its quality will
decrease. In magenta is now a character existing in this
position in spinach an experimentally proved to be at the
transcription start.
