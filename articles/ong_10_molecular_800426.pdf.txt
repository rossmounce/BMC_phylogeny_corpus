Abstract
Background: Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common nosocomial infection in the
United States and is caused by a range of uropathogens. Biofilm formation by uropathogens that cause CAUTI is often
mediated by cell surface structures such as fimbriae. In this study, we characterised the genes encoding type 3 fimbriae
from CAUTI strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter koseri and Citrobacter freundii.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of the type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkABCD) from 39 strains revealed they clustered into five
distinct clades (A-E) ranging from one to twenty-three members. The majority of sequences grouped in clade A, which
was represented by the mrk gene cluster from the genome sequenced K. pneumoniae MGH78578. The E. coli and K.
pneumoniae mrkABCD gene sequences clustered together in two distinct clades, supporting previous evidence for the
occurrence of inter-genera lateral gene transfer. All of the strains examined caused type 3 fimbriae mediated
agglutination of tannic acid treated human erythrocytes despite sequence variation in the mrkD-encoding adhesin
gene. Type 3 fimbriae deletion mutants were constructed in 13 representative strains and were used to demonstrate a
direct role for type 3 fimbriae in biofilm formation.
Conclusions: The expression of functional type 3 fimbriae is common to many Gram-negative pathogens that cause
CAUTI and is strongly associated with biofilm growth. Our data provides additional evidence for the spread of type 3
fimbrial genes by lateral gene transfer. Further work is now required to substantiate the clade structure reported here
by examining more strains as well as other bacterial genera that make type 3 fimbriae and cause CAUTI.
Background
Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is
the most common nosocomial infection in the United
States and a frequent cause of bacteremia [1]. Nosocomial CAUTI is caused by a range of different bacterial
pathogens [2] and these are often resistant to multiple
antibiotics [3].
Biofilm formation is a trait commonly found among
CAUTI isolates and results in the growth of bacteria on
the inner surface of the urinary catheter. Biofilm formation promotes encrustation and protects the bacteria
from the hydrodynamic forces of urine flow, host
defenses and antibiotics [4]. A perquisite to biofilm
growth is adherence to the catheter surface. A number of
mechanisms by which Gram-negative pathogens mediate

adherence to biotic and abiotic surfaces have been
described and include fimbriae (e.g. type 1, type 3, type
IV, curli and conjugative pili), cell surface adhesins (e.g.
autotransporter proteins such as antigen 43, UpaH and
UpaG) and flagella [5-16].
The expression of type 3 fimbriae has been described
from many Gram-negative pathogens [17-28]. Type 3
fimbriae are 2-4 nm wide and 0.5-2 μm long surface
organelles that are characterised by their ability to mediate agglutination of tannic acid-treated human RBC (MR/
K agglutination) [29]. Several studies have clearly demonstrated a role for type 3 fimbriae in biofilm formation
[17,28,30-33]. Type 3 fimbriae also mediate various
adherence functions such as binding to epithelial cells
(from the respiratory and urinary tracts) and extracellular
matrix proteins (e.g. collagen V) [31,34-36].
Type 3 fimbriae belong to the chaperone-usher class of
fimbriae and are encoded by five genes (mrkABCDF)
arranged in the same transcriptional orientation [29,37].

The mrk gene cluster is similar to other fimbrial operons
of the chaperone-usher class in that it contains genes
encoding major (mrkA) and minor (mrkF) subunit proteins as well as chaperone- (mrkB), usher- (mrkC) and
adhesin- (mrkD) encoding genes [37,38]. A putative regulatory gene (mrkE) located upstream of mrkA has been
described previously in Klebsiella pneumoniae [37]. The
mrk genes have been shown to reside at multiple genomic
locations, including the chromosome [39], on conjugative
plasmids [17,30] and within a composite transposon [40].
Transfer of an mrk-containing conjugative plasmid to
strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Kluyvera species has also been demonstrated [17]. Taken
together, these data strongly support spread of the mrk
genes between Gram-negative pathogens by lateral gene
transfer.
Recently, we identified and characterised the role of
type 3 fimbriae in biofilm formation from an Escherichia
coli strain isolated from a patient with CAUTI [28]. We
also demonstrated that the mrkB chaperone-encoding
gene and the ability to mediate MR/K agglutination was
common in uropathogenic Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter koseri strains (86.7%, 100%
and 100% of strains, respectively) but rare in uropathogenic E. coli and Citrobacter freundii strains (3.2% and
14.3% of strains, respectively) [28]. Despite the occurrence of type 3 fimbriae genes among a range of different
Gram-negative bacteria that cause CAUTI, little is known
about their molecular relationship. In this study, we have
examined the phylogenetic correlation between type 3
fimbrial (mrk) genes from 33 CAUTI strains representing
five different uropathogens (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K.
oxytoca, C. koseri and C. freundii). We also demonstrate
functional expression of type 3 fimbriae in each of these
strains and describe a common role for type 3 fimbriae in
biofilm formation.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of the mrkABCD genes from
uropathogenic bacterial genera

To investigate the phylogenetic relationship of the mrk
genes from 33 CAUTI strains (representing E. coli, K.
pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, C. koseri and C. freundii) we
amplified and sequenced an internal segment of the
mrkA, mrkB, mrkC and mrkD genes from each strain. We
also examined the corresponding sequence from six additional mrk gene clusters available at GenBank. A majority-rule consensus maximum likelihood (ML) tree was
constructed from the 39 concatenated mrkABCD fragments. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the
sequences clustered into five major clades (referred to as
clade A to E) with good bootstrap support (Fig. 1). The
five clades range from one member (clade C, represented

Page 2 of 12

by C. freundii M46) to 23 members (clade A, represented
by K. pneumoniae MGH78578), with an average interallelic diversity of 11.2%. Whereas the 10 C. koseri
sequences clustered in a single clade (clade E), clade B (3
sequences) and clade A (23 sequences) consist of
sequences from both K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony or distance-based methods produced tree topologies very similar to those
obtained by using DNA maximum likelihood (data not
shown).
The incongruence between the mrk consensus tree and
the established phylogeny for enteric bacteria [41] is
prima facie evidence for lateral gene transfer (LGT) of
mrk alleles. All K. pneumoniae chromosomal alleles cluster in Clade A, along with several plasmid-borne or chromosomal alleles from E. coli. In some cases, the K.
pneumoniae and E. coli alleles are identical (e.g.
Ec_pOLA52/Kp_M20; EcM202/Kp_MGH78578). Similarly, in clade B, two identical E. coli mrkABCD sequences
(M184 and ECOR28) share high nucleotide sequence
identity (98%) to the plasmid-borne K. pneumoniae
pIA565 mrkABCD. The mrkABCD concatenated nucleotide sequences of K. pneumoniae pIA565 (clade B) and
K. pneumoniae MGH78578 (clade A) share only 78.2%
nucleotide sequence identity. When analysed individually, the mrkA, mrkB, mrkC and mrkD gene fragment
alignments produced essentially the same tree topology
as the concatenated sequence (data not shown) with little
variation in within-group diversity (Table 1). In contrast
to other chaperone-usher systems, the mrkD adhesin is
more divergent than the mrkA major subunit and contributes the most of all mrk alleles to the inter-group
diversity (Table 1).
Sequence comparison of the mrk locus from strains of C.
freundii, C. koseri, E. coli and K. oxytoca

We compared the mrk gene clusters from representatives
of each of the five clades: 5 mrk regions were available
from GenBank, 3 were sequenced in this study (Fig. 2). As
expected, the mrkABCD gene order is conserved in all
clades. Predicted insertion sequences were identified
flanking both ends of the pMAS2027 and pOLA52 clusters (clade A), and at the 5' end of clusters from ECOR28
(clade B) and C. freundii M46 (clade C), indicative of
recent lateral gene transfer. Downstream of mrkF, a conserved 717 bp gene was present in five of the strains,
including one from each of the five defined clades. This
gene (labelled cko_00966 and kpn_03274 in the genomes
of C. koseri ATCC BAA895 and K. pneumoniae
MGH78578, respectively) encodes a central EAL domain
(Pfam:PF00563, E = 1.7e-29) suggesting that it may have a
role in signalling, however, no close homologs have been
functionally characterised. PCR primers designed from
these sequences demonstrated that this region was also

Notably, cko_00966 homologs were not encoded downstream of the plasmid-borne mrk clusters in E. coli
pMAS2027 and pOLA52, and there is no corresponding
sequence information available for this region in pIA565
[37]. The putative mrkE regulatory gene originally identified in pIA565 [37] was not present in any of the strains
examined.

and type 3 fimbriae, the mrk locus was deleted from thirteen strains (E. coli MS2027, M184, ECOR15, ECOR28;

employing λ-red mediated homologous recombination.
The strains were selected on the basis of their transformation efficiency and included at least one representative
from each of the mrk phylogenetic clades. Several different assays were employed to compare the thirteen sets of
wild-type and mrk deletion strains. First, SDS-PAGE
analysis of crude cell lysates and subsequent Western
blotting was performed using a type 3 fimbriae-specific
antiserum. A predominant 15 kDa band representing the
MrkA major subunit was detected from all wild-type
strains except C. freundii M46, which failed to react positively in this assay. In contrast, no reaction was observed
for any of the mrk deletion mutants (Fig. 3 and data not
shown). Next, the wild-type and mrk mutant strains were
compared for their ability to mediate MR/K agglutination. Only the wild-type strains produced a positive phenotype (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Finally, the presence
of type 3 fimbriae was confirmed by immunogold labelling employing type 3 fimbriae-specific antiserum for E.
coli ECOR15 and C. koseri M546, but was absent in their
corresponding mrk deletion mutants (Fig. 5). Taken
together, the results demonstrate that MR/K agglutina-

The thirteen sets of isogenic wild-type and mrk deletion
strains generated above were examined for their ability to
produce a biofilm following growth in M9 minimal
medium (containing 0.2% glucose) under dynamic culture conditions. Strong biofilm growth was observed
from all wild-type strains except C. freundii M46. In contrast, deletion of the mrk gene cluster caused a significant
reduction in biofilm growth (p < 0.0001) in all strains
except E. coli M184 (Fig. 6). Similar results were also
observed following growth in synthetic urine (data not
shown). Thus, type 3 fimbriae contribute significantly to
biofilm formation when expressed in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca and C. koseri.

Discussion
Type 3 fimbriae are adhesive organelles produced by a
range of Gram-negative pathogens that cause CAUTI.
Here we show that type 3 fimbriae (mrkABCD) genes
from 33 CAUTI isolates representing C. freundii, C. koseri, E. coli, K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae cluster into five
well-supported clades on the basis of nucleotide
sequence. Type 3 fimbriae were expressed by all of these
strains as indicated by their positive MR/K agglutination.
Type 3 fimbrial expression was also associated with biofilm growth in the majority of these strains. This is the
first report describing the distinct grouping of type 3 fimbrial genes into phylogenetic clades at the species level,
with strong evidence supporting inter-species lateral
gene transfer. We also demonstrate the functional expression of type 3 fimbriae by strains of C. koseri and C. freundii.
Phylogenetic analysis with individual and concatenated
mrkABCD sequences revealed five distinct clades (A-E)
which were strongly supported by long internal branches.
The majority of the sequences grouped in clade A, which
is represented by the chromosomal mrk gene cluster from
the genome sequenced K. pneumoniae strain
MGH78578. Clades A and B contained mrk gene clusters
from K. pneumoniae (both chromosomal and plasmid
origin) and E. coli (plasmid origin). Two mrk loci have
been fully sequenced from E. coli; in both cases the mrk
genes are located on a conjugative plasmid (pMAS2027
and pOLA52, respectively) and flanked by transposonlike sequences [30,40]. While the genomic location of the
mrk genes in the additional seven E. coli strains identified
in this study remains to be determined, the data presented here and in previous studies strongly suggests
inter-genera lateral gene transfer of the mrk cluster
[17,28]. In contrast, the composition of clade E is entirely

C. koseri sequences, while clades C and D are represented
by a unique sequence from C freundii and K. oxytoca,
respectively. The presence of cko_00966 homologs downstream of representative mrk clusters in all 5 clades
strongly suggests that the ancestral mrkABCD locus was
also encoded next to a cko_00966 homolog and that the
clades are largely related by linear descent. Notably, the
relationship determined here is not congruent with the
known evolutionary relationship of Klebsiella, Citrobacter, and E. coli [41], supporting the occurrence of
lateral gene transfer. We propose that clade A represents
the K. pneumoniae lineage, with mrk regions laterally
transferred to E. coli (e.g. pMAS2027 and pOLA52) and
clade E represents the C. koseri lineage. Clades B, C and
D, which contain mrk sequences from K. pneumoniae, E.
coli, C. freundii and K. oxytoca, are clearly under-represented and additional type 3 fimbrial gene sequences are
required to confirm the groupings.

Among the four genes used in the phylogenetic analysis, mrkD exhibited the highest inter-group diversity
(Table 1). Thus, from the partial sequence comparisons
performed in this work, the MrkD adhesin displayed
greater sequence variability than the MrkA major subunit. This is inconsistent with other chaperone-usher
fimbriae such as type 1 and P fimbriae, where the
sequence of the adhesin (e.g. FimH, PapG) is more conserved than the major subunit protein (e.g. FimA, PapA).
We note, however, that these findings require substantiation via comparison of the entire sequence of each structural subunit from multiple strains. The MrkD adhesin
mediates several phenotypes, including MR/K agglutination, as well as adherence to human endothelial cells, urinary bladder cells, basement membranes and ECM
proteins such as collagen IV and V [5,31,34,35]. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that sequence
variations in the MrkD adhesin are associated with differential binding properties [42-44]. Our study demon-

deletion mutants, M546mrk, ECOR15mrk, M126mrk, M692mrk and M46mrk were negative for agglutination.

provides additional evidence for the spread of type 3 fimbrial genes by lateral gene transfer, further work is
required to substantiate the clade structure reported here
by examining more strains as well as other genera that
make type 3 fimbriae and cause CAUTI such as Proteus
and Providentia.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids & growth conditions

Figure 5 Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrating expression of type 3 fimbriae in E. coli ECOR15 and C. koseri M546.
Expression of type 3 fimbriae at the cell surface was demonstrated by
abundant labelling with anti-type 3 fimbriae-gold particles. In contrast,
the deletion mutants, E. coli ECOR15mrk and C. koseri M546mrk were
virtually devoid of gold labelling. Scale bar represents 1 μm.

The strains and plasmids used in this study are described
in Table 2. Clinical UTI isolates were obtained from urine
samples of patients at the Princess Alexandra Hospital
(Brisbane, Australia) and have been described previously
[45]. E. coli ECOR15, ECOR23 and ECOR28 were from
the E. coli reference (ECOR) collection [46]. Cells were
routinely grown at 37 °C on solid or in liquid Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics unless otherwise stated. M9 minimal medium and
synthetic urine were formulated as previously described
[47,48].
DNA manipulations and genetic techniques

strates that the degree of sequence variation in MrkD
might be even greater than previously predicted [44].
CAUTI is associated with biofilm formation on the
inner surface of indwelling catheters. Thirteen independent mrk deletion mutants were generated and used to
examine type 3 fimbriae associated phenotypes including
MR/K agglutination and biofilm formation. All of the mrk
mutants were unable to cause MR/K agglutination, confirming that this property is highly specific for type 3 fimbriae. In biofilm assays, 11/13 mrk mutants displayed a
significant reduction in biofilm growth compared to their
respective parent strain, demonstrating that type 3 fimbriae contribute to this phenotype across a range of different genera and species. The exceptions were C.
freundii M46 and E. coli M184. C. freundii M46 failed to
produce a significant biofilm in the assay conditions
employed irrespective of its mrk genotype. Although this
strain caused MR/K agglutination, we were also unable to
detect the MrkA major subunit protein by western blot
analysis. E. coli M184 showed no reduction in biofilm
growth upon deletion of the mrk genes. It is likely that E.
coli M184 contains additional mechanisms that promote
biofilm growth and therefore deletion of the mrk genes
did not result in loss of this phenotype.

Conclusions
This study demonstrated that the expression of functional type 3 fimbriae is common to many Gram-negative
pathogens that cause CAUTI. Biofilm growth mediated
by type 3 fimbriae may be important for the survival of
these organisms on the surface of urinary catheters and
within the hospital environment. Although our analysis

Plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Australia). Restriction endonucleases
were used according to the manufacturer's specifications
(New England Biolabs, USA). Chromosomal DNA was
purified as previously described [48]. PCR was performed
using Taq polymerase according to the manufacturer's
instructions (New England Biolabs, USA). DNA sequencing was performed by the Australian Equine Genome
Research Centre. Deletion mutants were constructed
essentially as previously described using either pKD46
[49] or pKOBEG199 [50,51], with the exception that C.
freundii and C. koseri strains were heated at 42°C for 2
min prior to electroporation. Primers used to generate
deletion mutants were as follows: 1293 and 1294 (E. coli
MS2027), 1456 and 1457 (E. coli ECOR15 and K. pneumoniae strains), 1458 and 1459 (E. coli ECOR28), 1456
and 1459 (E. coli M184), 1460 and 1459 (K. oxytoca
strains), 1456 and 1461 (C. koseri M546), 1462 and 1459
(C. freundii M46) (Table 3). All deletion mutants were
checked by PCR using specific primers (Table 3) in conjunction with primers targeting the kanamycin or
chloramphenicol resistance gene [49] and further confirmed by sequencing. Sequence information outside the
mrk cluster was obtained by inverse PCR (using primer
combinations 1450/1452, 1450/1454, 1450/1453, 1451/
1455, or 1451/1453) or standard PCR employing primers
designed from the genome sequenced K. pneumoniae

shaking cultures in M9 minimal medium. Strains which
produced a negative result in this assay were enriched for
type 3 fimbriae production by three successive rounds of
48 h static growth in M9 minimal medium and then retested.

Biofilm formation on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surfaces
was monitored by using 96-well microtitre plates (Falcon)
essentially as previously described [16]. Briefly, cells were
grown for 24 h in M9 minimal medium (containing 0.2%
glucose) or 48 h in synthetic urine at 37°C under shaking
conditions, washed to remove unbound cells and stained
with crystal violet. Quantification of biofilm mass was
performed by addition of acetone-ethanol (20:80) and
measurement of the dissolved crystal violet at an optical
density of 595 nm. All experiments were performed in a
minimum of eight replicates.

Crude cell lysates were prepared from overnight cultures
and boiled in acid as previously described [14]. Protein
samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting as previously described [52] employing a type 3 fimbriae specific antiserum. Immunogold labelling was
performed using the same Type 3 fimbriae specific antiserum as previously described [14]. Cells were examined
under a JEOL JEM1010 TEM operated at 80 kV. Images
were captured using an analysis Megaview digital camera.
Phylogenetic and sequence analysis

PCR products were generated from an internal region of
mrkA (416 bp), mrkB (243 bp), mrkC (657 bp) and mrkD
(778), respectively, from each of the 33 CAUTI strains
and sequenced on both strands. These sequences correspond to nucleotides 112 to 530 of mrkA, 66 to 308 of
mrkB, 173 to 829 of mrkC and 157 to 934 of mrkD in the
reference strain K. pneumoniae MGH78578 (CP000647).

CAUTI strains (and six additional mrk sequences available at GenBank from strains causing other infections;
accession numbers: CP000647, EU682505, CP000964,
M55912, CP000822, EU370913) were aligned using
ClustalX [53], and subjected to phylogenetic analysis
using PHYLIP [54]. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were
built from a concatenated alignment of 2104 nucleotides
(comprising 1269 conserved sites and 775 informative
sites) using the dnaml algorithm in PHYLIP [54]. A consensus tree of 500 ML bootstrap replicates was prepared
using the majority rule method as implemented by Split-

stree version 4 [55,56]. We were unable to amplify mrkD
from E. coli M202 and only used the mrkABC concatenated fragments in the analysis. For comparative analysis,
the complete mrk cluster (and adjacent regions) from E.
coli ECOR28, C. freundii M46 and K. oxytoca M126 were
amplified using an inverse PCR strategy and sequenced.
Statistical analysis

Differences in biofilm formation between wild-type and
mrk mutant strains were analysed using the ANOVA single factor test (Minitab 15 Statistical Software).
