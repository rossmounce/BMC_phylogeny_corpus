Abstract
Background: The CyaB protein from Aeromonas hydrophila has been shown to possess adenylyl
cyclase activity. While orthologs of this enzyme have been found in some bacteria and archaea, it
shows no detectable relationship to the classical nucleotide cyclases. Furthermore, the actual
biological functions of these proteins are not clearly understood because they are also present in
organisms in which there is no evidence for cyclic nucleotide signaling.
Results: We show that the CyaB like adenylyl cyclase and the mammalian thiamine triphosphatases
define a novel superfamily of catalytic domains called the CYTH domain that is present in all three
superkingdoms of life. Using multiple alignments and secondary structure predictions, we define the
catalytic core of these enzymes to contain a novel α+β scaffold with 6 conserved acidic residues
and 4 basic residues. Using contextual information obtained from the analysis of gene
neighborhoods and domain fusions, we predict that members of this superfamily may play a central
role in the interface between nucleotide and polyphosphate metabolism. Additionally, based on
contextual information, we identify a novel domain (called CHAD) that is predicted to functionally
interact with the CYTH domain-containing enzymes in bacteria and archaea. The CHAD is
predicted to be an alpha helical domain, and contains conserved histidines that may be critical for
its function.
Conclusions: The phyletic distribution of the CYTH domain suggests that it is an ancient
enzymatic domain that was present in the Last Universal Common Ancestor and was involved in
nucleotide or organic phosphate metabolism. Based on the conservation of catalytic residues, we
predict that CYTH domains are likely to chelate two divalent cations, and exhibit a reaction
mechanism that is dependent on two metal ions, analogous to nucleotide cyclases, polymerases and
certain phosphoesterases. Our analysis also suggests that the experimentally characterized
members of this superfamily, namely adenylyl cyclase and thiamine triphosphatase, are secondary
derivatives of proteins that performed an ancient role in polyphosphate and nucleotide metabolism.

Background
Organic phosphate compounds are the central metabo-

lites of all biological systems [1,2]. Some are the basic
building blocks of nucleic acids, some like ATP and GTP,

are additionally, cellular energy stores, others like cAMP
or cGMP are messengers in signal transduction, and, yet
others, such as FAD, NAD, thiamine phosphates and pyridoxal phosphate are cofactors for a range of enzymes
[1,2]. Protein domains belonging to a relatively small set
of structural folds are known to bind or catalyze reactions
that utilize these organic phosphate compounds (see
SCOP database: [http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/])
[3,4]. Several of these folds trace back to some of the earliest phases of the evolution of the protein world, and participate in a wide range of disparate biological functions
in extant proteins [4,5]. Some folds, such as the P-loop
fold, the Rossmann fold and the Hsp70-like fold, have
been well studied, and comprise mainly of dedicated nucleotide binding or hydrolyzing proteins [6–9]. Others,
such as the palm-domain, which is found in adenylyl cyclases and various nucleic acid polymerases, belong to
more generalized protein folds that contain representatives with diverse biochemical activities [4,10,11]. Current
availability of extensive genome sequence data, allows
one to identify less numerous, nevertheless biological important organic phosphate-binding domains that may
have previous eluded detection. The identification of such
domain superfamilies, containing enzymes with several
different activities, often throws considerable light on
their evolution, structure and catalytic mechanisms
[4,12].
The majority of previously known nucleotide cyclases belong to two major folds. The classical adenylyl cyclases,
guanylyl cyclases and the GGDEF (diguanylate cyclase)
domains share the catalytic palm domain with the family
B DNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases and eukaryote-type primases
[4,13,14]. The pathogenic adenylyl cyclases of several bacteria and the CyaA-like proteobacteria adenylyl cyclases
are extremely divergent versions of the catalytic domain
seen in the Pol-β family of nucleotidyl transferases [15]
(also see SCOP database:
[http://scop.mrclmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/]). While the catalytic domains of
these two superfamilies have very different folds, they follow a similar reaction mechanism that is dependent on
two Mg2+ ions coordinated by a cluster of acidic residues.
However, the CyaB adenylyl cyclase, which was identified
in the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila is unrelated to any
of these above superfamilies of enzymes [16]. Though
close relatives of this enzyme exist in some bacteria, like
Yersinia pestis and Borrelia burgdorferi and the archaea, its
antecedents or catalytic mechanism have not been understood. Using sensitive sequence profile comparison methods, we show that the CyaB-like adenylyl cyclases are
homologs of the soluble mammalian thiamine triphosphatases [17], and they define a novel superfamily of enzymes that utilize ATP and other organic phosphates. We
present evidence that a representative of this domain was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/3/33

present in the last common ancestor of all extant life
forms. The primary biological function of these proteins
appears to be related to polyphosphate and nucleotide
metabolism. Cyclic AMP generation and thiamine triphosphate hydrolysis appear to be secondarily acquired
activities. We also identify the potential active site- and
substrate interacting-residues and postulate that these enzymes are likely to catalyze a two-metal ion dependent reaction on structural scaffold that is completely different
from that seen in the other two superfamilies of adenylyl
cyclases.

Results and discussion
Identification of the CYTH domain
In order to understand the evolutionary affinities and
provenance of the CyaB adenylyl cyclase from Aeromonas
hydrophila, we carried out database searches using sensitive sequence profile analysis methods. As CyaB is a small
protein with no detectable low complexity regions, we
used it as a seed to initiate a PSI-BLAST search [18] (run to
convergence, with expect-value for inclusion in profile =
.01). The search resulted in the detection of its obvious orthologs from Yersinia and various archaea at significant
expect (e) values ranging from from 3 × 10-43 to 8 × 10-5.
The second iteration recovered proteins from more archaea, eukaryotes (e-value: 3 × 10-7), Clostridium (3 × 108) and Borrelia (6 × 10-8). Further iterations, run to convergence, recovered the soluble mammalian thiamine triphosphatases (3 × 10-4), and the N-terminal region of E.
coli YgiF. At convergence, several bacterial proteins, that
showed a conserved EXEXK (where X is any amino acid)
characteristic of this family, and a region C-terminal to a
P-loop like uridine kinase domain in plants were also recovered at borderline e-values (e value ~0.01 – 0.05). Reciprocal searches initiated with the E. coli YgiF protein
(residues 1–200), not only recovered its bacterial orthologs, archaeal CyaB homologs and eukaryotic proteins, but also several others such as Bacillus subtilis YjbK,
Methanosarcina Ma2350, and Mesorhizobium loti Mll4592
with e-values in the range of 10-4–10-6 upon first detection. Additionally, transitive searches initiated from the
region C-terminal to the uridine kinase of the plants
(49D11.13 from Oryza sativa, region: 250–410) recovered
archaeal CyaB homologs confirming their relationship to
with the other proteins detected in these searches. Regular
expression searches with the conservation pattern found
in these CyaB homologs also recovered the most of the
members detected in the above-mentioned profile searches, but failed to recover any new candidates.

In all these searches, the alignments more or less spanned
the entire length of the CyaB protein and typically contained the same set of conserved residues. The Gibbs sampling procedure revealed the presence of seven conserved
motifs, with a probability of chance occurrence less than

10-14, in the search space comprising of the 70 or so proteins that were identified in the above searches as having
this domain. We clustered these proteins using the BLASTCLUST program in several smaller clusters and prepared
multiple alignments for the individual clusters and predicted secondary structure for these set using the PHD
program. A nearly complete congruence was seen in the
comparison of the secondary structures of the individual
clusters. In many cases, the region of similarity to CyaB
comprised the entire length of the target protein detected
in these searches. However, in some cases it only comprised a part of the protein, with rest of the protein being
made of other globular domains. These observations, taken together, suggested that CyaB and soluble mammalian
thiamine triphosphatases define a novel superfamily of
conserved domains, which may either occur by itself or in
combination with other domains. We named this domain
the CYTH (CyaB, thiamine triphosphatase) domain after
the two experimentally characterized proteins in which it
is present.
Sequence conservation, structure and biochemical activities of the CYTH domain
All complete CYTH domain sequences were aligned using
the T_Coffee program, and this alignment was further refined based on the PSI-BLAST HSPs, conserved motifs detected in the Gibbs sampling procedure and predicted
secondary structure for the individual groups (Fig. 1). A
text copy of the alignment is being provided as an additional file (see additional file1 and additional file 2). The
predicted secondary structure for this domain indicated
an α+β fold, with 6 conserved β-strands and 6 conserved
α-helices. Neither the predicted secondary structure, nor
the pattern of the conserved residues revealed an obvious
relationship with any previously recognized fold. Given
that the CYTH domain is the only globular domain in the
enzymes, thiamine triphosphatase and CyaB, it is predicted to be an enzymatic domain. While the reactions catalyzed by these two enzymes are distinct, their substrates,
respectively thiamine triphosphate and ATP, are both organic triphosphates. The CYTH domain is also present Cterminal to the catalytic P-loop containing domain in the
plant and slime mold uridine kinase homologs. In these
proteins it is likely to interact with nucleoside diphosphates or triphosphates, which are substrates for these kinases. These observations suggest that the CYTH domains
are likely to be domains specialized to bind nucleotides
and other organic phosphates. A multiple alignment of
this superfamily reveals the presence of several nearly universally conserved charged residues that are likely to form
the active site of these enzymes (Fig. 1). The most prominent of these are an EXEXK motif associated with strand1 of the domain, two basic residues in helix-2, a K at the
end of strand 3, an E in strand 4, a basic residue in helix4, a D at the end of strand 5 and two acidic residues (typ-

ically glutamates) in strand 6 (Fig. 1). The presence of
around 6 conserved acidic positions in the majority of the
CYTH domains suggests that it coordinates two divalent
metal ions. Analogous active sites, that coordinate two
metal ions, are observed in domains with similar activities, such as the classical adenylyl/guanylyl cyclases, family B DNA polymerases, pol-β fold nucleotidyl transferases,
and triphosphatases or phosphoesterases of the HD and
DHH superfamilies [11,15,19,20]. Consistent with these
observations, both CyaB and ThTPase have been shown to
require Mg2+ ions for their nucleotide cyclase and phosphatase activities [16,17].
The four conserved basic residues in the CYTH domain are
most probably involved in the binding of acidic phosphate moieties of their substrates (Fig. 1). The conservation of these two sets of residues in the majority of CYTH
domains suggests that most members of this group are
likely to possess an activity dependent on two metal ions,
with a preference for nucleotides or related phosphatemoiety-bearing substrates. The proposed biochemical activity, and the arrangement of predicted strands in the primary structure of the CYTH domain imply that the may
adopt a barrel or sandwich-like configuration, with metal
ions and the substrate bound in the central cavity. The
only prominent exceptions to the basic conservation pattern of the CYTH domains are the versions found in the
plant and Dictyostelium pyrimidine kinase homologs (Fig.
1, At1g26190-like). These versions lack 5 of the 6 conserved acidic residues, but retain 3 of the 4 conserved basic
residues (Fig. 1). This leads to the prediction that these
CYTH domains are catalytically inactive. However, as they
retain the basic residues, they probably still bind the organic phosphate substrates, and function as regulatory domains that are linked to P-loop kinase domains.
Phyletic patterns, evolutionary history and potential biological functions of the CYTH domains
CYTH domains are present in most of the major lineages,
for which sequence information is currently available,
from the three principal superkingdomains of life (Fig. 2).
We used the multiple alignment of the CYTH domain to
construct phylogenetic trees using the least squares, neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods (see Materials and Methods). The monophyletic clusters that
emerged in this analysis were essentially the same as those
that were derived through similarity based clustering using BLASTCLUST. The majority of archaeal and eukaryotic
proteins formed a monophyletic cluster to the exclusion
of most of the bacterial proteins (RELL Bootstrap support
77%) (Fig. 2). This cluster was also supported by a unique
synapomorphy (a shared derived character) in the form of
a conserved motif (Dh; where h is a hydrophobic residue)
associated with the second strand (Fig. 1). This phylogenetic tree topology resembles that of several proteins in-

volved in core cellular functions such as the DNA
recombinase RecA, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, RNA
polymerase and other RNA metabolism proteins [21–23].
This suggests that a CYTH domain was present in the last
universal common ancestor of all extant life forms and the
extant forms are in part vertically inherited from this ancestral form.
However, there are certain anomalies to this pattern. The
CYTH domains are entirely absent from the small genomes of pathogenic bacteria such as Rickettsia and Chlamydia

as well as some of the large genomes such as Deinococcus
radiodurans. At least, a single copy of the CYTH domain is
seen in most archaeal and eukaryotic genomes sampled to
date, with the exception of Thermoplasma and the yeasts,
where it is absent. This implies that the CYTH domain has
been lost independently on a number of occasions in evolution. CyaB homologs from Aeromonas, Clostridium,
Borrelia, and Ralstonia lie firmly (RELL Bootstrap >= 70%)
within the archaeal and eukaryotic clusters, rather than
with their bacterial counterparts (Fig. 2). These bacterial
forms also share the unique sequence signature in the secPage 5 of 11

ond strand with this group suggesting that they have been
derived through horizontal transfer from different archaeal and eukaryotic sources (Fig. 1). In particular the CyaB
homolog from Ralstonia groups very strongly with the animal versions and appears to be a recent horizontal transfer in this bacterium from the latter clade. The possibility
of lateral transfer of Aeromonas CyaB from an archaeal
source has been previously suggested, and is consistent
with the enzyme being optimally functional under high
temperature [16]. There are 3 distinct CYTH domains in
the euryarchaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans, in addition
to the version which groups with the CYTH domains that
are found, in single or duplicate copies, in other archaea
and eukaryotes. These former versions, strongly group
with CYTH domains from actinobacteria (Rell Boostrap
77%) to the exclusion of other lineage (Fig. 2). Further-

more, they share a fusion to a novel conserved domain
with characteristic histidines (see below) with the actinobacterial versions. Thus they appear to have been transferred laterally from the actinobacteria into the
Methanosarcina lineage followed by a small lineage specific expansion in the latter. Bacteriophages, like RB49, that
contain a solo CYTH domain, which is closer to the version seen in its proteobacterial hosts, could have served as
conduits for the lateral distribution of this domain.
The phyletic pattern of the CYTH domain is not very typical of signaling enzymes like nucleotide cyclases. Classic
adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases show a far more sporadic
distribution, and are often present in multiple copies
fused to a variety of signaling domains such as the cyclic
nucleotide binding domains [24]. Cyclic nucleotide gen-

erating activity is not known to exist in a subset of the archaea [25], though most of them contain a well-conserved
copy of the CYTH domain. Experimental analysis on the
Methanococcus CyaB homolog revealed no adenylyl cyclase activity comparable to that seen in Aeromonas CyaB
[16]. Likewise, there is no evidence for a widespread presence of the ThTPase activity in the organisms that contain
CYTH domain proteins [17]. Hence, the principal biological function of the CYTH domains may be different from
those of the experimentally characterized members of this
family. General conservation of this domain across a
range of organisms, and its presence in the LUCA suggests
the possibility of an important general role in cellular
process of free-living organisms. In order to decipher the
potential biological roles of this domain we used different
forms of contextual information regarding these domains,
in the form of domain architectures, gene neighborhoods
(predicted operons) and experimental evidence for interactions between proteins. Both domain architecture and
operon analysis have been used extensively to make functional predictions of poorly characterized domains or
genes [26–29]. Moreover, the presence of evolutionarily
conserved operons often correlates with the involvement
of the component genes in a sequential pathway or physically interacting complex [30,31]. We summarize the different forms of contextual information that we extracted
from the CYTH domains in the form a network diagram
(Fig. 3).
The CYTH domain shows a small array set of fusions to
other conserved domains (Fig. 3). One of the most prevalent fusions is to an uncharacterized domain, with a characteristic pattern of conserved histidines and other
charged residues. This domain is predicted to adopt an αhelical fold and is according referred to as CHAD (CHAD:
conserved histidine α-helical domain; Fig. 4). The sequence conservation pattern (Fig. 4) suggests that this domain is likely to contain two repeat units, with at least 4
helices each, at its core. While no clear functional prediction can be made for the CHAD, the conserved charged
residues could form a strongly polar surface that could
participate, either in metal chelation, or act as phosphoacceptors. Another notable fusion is with a specific version of the HD hydrolase domain [19], which is also
found fused to the C-terminus of the HSP70-fold domain
in the exopolyphosphatase (PPX) (Fig. 3). HD domains
typically possess phosphoesterase activity, and are fused
to catalytic domains that possess nucleotide kinase, nucleotidyltransferase, nucleotide cyclase or diguanylate cyclase activity [19,29]. This fits well with the observed cyclase
activity seen in CyaB, but is also consistent with phosphotransferase or nucleotidyl transferase for the CYTH domain. Finally, catalytically inactive versions of the CYTH
domain are found fused to the nucleotide kinase domain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/3/33

in uridine kinase homologs and may serve as an allosteric
nucleotide-binding site in these enzymes (Fig. 3).
In terms of conserved gene neighborhoods, CYTH-domain-encoding genes, like mll4592 from α-proteobacteria, are frequently found in the neighborhood of genes
encoding solo CHADs (Fig. 3). Additionally, in Methanosarcina the CYTH-encoding genes are found in predicted operons or in the neighborhood of genes encoding
exopolyphosphatase (PPX) and polyphosphate kinase
(PPK). Furthermore, in Sulfolobus, a gene for a CHAD protein is in a predicted operon along with genes for thymidylate kinase and PPX. CHAD- and CTYH-encoding genes
are also found in the neighborhood of PPK and PPX in
Chlorobium tepidum and Geobacter metallireducens, respectively (Fig. 3). Genes for CYTH domains also co-occur in
predicted operons with genes for another polyphosphate
utilizing enzyme, the polyphosphate-dependent NAD kinase (PPNK), in certain cyanobacteria (eg. Prochlorococcus
marinus) and Gram positive bacteria like Oceanobacillus
iheyensis. Other potential connections are furnished by the
co-occurrence of genes for CYTH-domain proteins with
genes involved in with nucleoside polyphosphate metabolism. These include co-occurrence with the gene for adenosine tetraphosphatase (APAH; eg. in Magnetococcus sp.)
and with genes encoding the YjbM-domain in Gram-positive bacteria. The YjbM domain, most often, occurs fused
to pentaphosphate guanosine-3'-pyrophosphohydrolase
(SpoT) and GTP pyrophosphokinase (RelA), suggesting a
role for it in the metabolism of the stringent-response nucleoside polyphosphate.
These contextual connections are consistent with the participation of CYTH domains in organo-phosphate biochemistry, and circumstantially associate it with the
metabolic network related to polyphosphates and nucleoside polyphospates (Fig. 3) [32]. Specifically, PPK and
PPX have been shown to, respectively, lengthen or shorten
polyphosphate polymers [32]. These two enzymes also
appear to interact with the nucleotide metabolism of the
cell. In particular PPK and PPNK can utilize Poly(P) to
synthesize nucleoside polyphosphates, while PPK along
with adenylate kinase can carry out polyphosphate-dependent phosphorylation AMP [33–35]. Hence, it is likely
that the CYTH domain proteins participate directly in this
biochemical network along with these proteins. One possibility is that the CYTH domains utilize polyphosphates
to synthesize different organo-phosphate derivatives including nucleotides. Alternatively, they could also function as phosphoesterases that hydrolyze particular
nucleoside polyphosphates. These leads could aid further
experimental investigations on the CYTH domain that
might help in uncovering ancient, as-yet-unexplored links
between polyphosphate and nucleotide metabolism.

Figure 4
Multiple alignment of the CHAD domain The coloring scheme, secondary structure abbreviations and species abbreviations are as in Fig. 1. The coloring reflects the consensus at 90% conservation.

Finally, at least in some lineages, the CYTH domain proteins may have been secondarily recruited for other functions. The CyaB protein may represent one such case
where after the original transfer from an archaeon into the
proteobacterial lineage it may have acquire the novel
function as an adenylyl cyclase. However, it is entirely
possible that even in this case the adenylyl cyclase activity
is secondary to some other uncharacterized metabolic activity. The vertebrate soluble thiamine triphosphatase has
undergone accelerated divergence, as it is present on a
long branch in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). ThTPase is
also unusual in lacking the 3rd conserved acidic domain of
the CYTH domain. Hence, it may represent a case of relatively recent acquisition of a new catalytic activity.

Conclusions
We show that Aeromonas adenylyl cyclase CyaB and thiamine triphosphatase define a novel superfamily of catalytic domains that act on nucleotides and organo-phosphate
substrates. These domains are widely distributed in all the
3 superkingdoms of life and can be traced back to the last
ancestor of all life forms. We identify 6 conserved acidic
residues, that are likely to form the active site of these en-

zymes, and 4 conserved basic residues, that may participate in interactions with phosphate-moiety-containing
substrates. We postulate that these enzymes are likely to
chelate 2 divalent cations and are likely follow a bimetal
reaction mechanism similar to what has been proposed
for nucleotide cyclases, nucleic acid polymerases, or certain phosphoesterases such as those of the HD and DHH
superfamilies. A version of the CYTH domain, which is
fused to the catalytic domain of nucleotide kinases, lacks
the predicted catalytic residues, and probably function as
an allosteric regulatory domain. Additionally, we detected
a novel domain, termed CHAD, which occurs fused to the
CYTH domain or is encoded by genes occurring in the
same operon as those encoding CYTH domains. CHAD
contains conserved histidines that are predicted to either
chelate metals or serve as phosphoacceptors. Based on
phyletic distribution and contextual information, we conclude that these enzymes may play a critical role in the interface between nucleotide and polyphosphate
metabolism.

Methods
The non-redundant (NR) database of protein sequences
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH,
Bethesda) was searched using the BLASTP and PSI-BLAST
programs [18]. Profile searches using the PSI-BLAST program were conducted either with a single sequence or an
alignment used as the query, with a profile inclusion expectation (E) value threshold of 0.01 and were iterated
until convergence. Additionally, hidden Markov model
based searches using a multiple alignment of known
members were run using the HMMER2 package [36]. The
Gibbs sampling procedure, as implemented in the MACAW program was used to detect and evaluate statistically
significant conserved motifs [37]. Multiple alignments
were constructed using the T_Coffee program [38], followed by manual correction based on the PSI-BLAST results. Protein secondary structure was predicted using a
multiple alignment as the input for the JPRED and PHD
programs [39,40]. Preliminary clustering of proteins was
done using the BLASTCLUST program with empirically
determined length and score threshold cut off values (For
documentation see [ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/README.bcl]). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor joining or least square method
followed by local rearrangements using the maximum
likelihood algorithm to predict the most likely tree. The
robustness of tree topology was assessed with 10,000 Resampling of Estimated Log Likelihoods (RELL) bootstrap
replicates. The MOLPHY and Phylip software packages
were used for phylogenetic analyses [41,42].
