Divergence of gene regulation through
chromosomal rearrangements
Wolfgang Goettel, Joachim Messing*

Abstract
Background: The molecular mechanisms that modify genome structures to give birth and death to alleles are still
not well understood. To investigate the causative chromosomal rearrangements, we took advantage of the allelic
diversity of the duplicated p1 and p2 genes in maize. Both genes encode a transcription factor involved in maysin
synthesis, which confers resistance to corn earworm. However, p1 also controls accumulation of reddish pigments
in floral tissues and has therefore acquired a new function after gene duplication. p1 alleles vary in their tissuespecific expression, which is indicated in their allele designation: the first suffix refers to red or white pericarp
pigmentation and the second to red or white glume pigmentation.
Results: Comparing chromosomal regions comprising p1-ww[4Co63], P1-rw1077 and P1-rr4B2 alleles with that of
the reference genome, P1-wr[B73], enabled us to reconstruct additive events of transposition, chromosome breaks
and repairs, and recombination that resulted in phenotypic variation and chimeric regulatory signals. The p1-ww
[4Co63] null allele is probably derived from P1-wr[B73] by unequal crossover between large flanking sequences. A
transposon insertion in a P1-wr-like allele and NHEJ (non-homologous end-joining) could have resulted in the
formation of the P1-rw1077 allele. A second NHEJ event, followed by unequal crossover, probably led to the
duplication of an enhancer region, creating the P1-rr4B2 allele. Moreover, a rather dynamic picture emerged in the
use of polyadenylation signals by different p1 alleles. Interestingly, p1 alleles can be placed on both sides of a large
retrotransposon cluster through recombination, while functional p2 alleles have only been found proximal to the
cluster.
Conclusions: Allelic diversity of the p locus exemplifies how gene duplications promote phenotypic variability
through composite regulatory signals. Transposition events increase the level of genomic complexity based not
only on insertions but also on excisions that cause DNA double-strand breaks and trigger illegitimate
recombination.

Background
An exciting challenge of biological research has been to
understand phenotypic diversity within a species, which
affects virtually every organ and cell type. In plants, this
intraspecific diversity is often readily visible in the size,
shape, color and number of flowers, fruits and seeds.
Diversity can occur in every region of the gene, in coding regions or in regulatory sequences including
upstream promoter and enhancer sequences, 5’ and 3’
UTRs and regulatory introns [1,2]. Changes in regulatory regions affecting allele expression and transcript
amount can be simple, such as small and large indels, or

more complex, such as transposon insertions and structural rearrangements. Molecular mechanisms responsible for the sequence modifications are replication errors,
recombination and transposition. Although the majority
of allelic variation is due to nucleotide polymorphisms,
phenotypic differences can be caused by epigenetic
modifications such as DNA methylation [3,4].
Sequence comparisons among inbred lines revealed
that maize is a highly polymorphic species regarding
genes and intergenic space [5]. Consequently, maize
lends itself to studying the molecular basis of phenotypic
variation. As an example for a detailed allelic analysis, we
chose the p1 locus, which maps to the short arm of chromosome 1, for several reasons: 1) p1 produces a visible,
quantitative phenotype in different tissues (Figure 1A).

Figure 1 Phenotype, structure and function of p1 and p2 alleles. (A) p1 alleles. p1 alleles are phenotypically classified according to their
pericarp (i.e. the outer layer of the kernel) and cob glume pigmentation. The first suffix of the allele designation refers to pericarp color (r for
red, w for white or colorless, p for patterned), while the second suffix stands for glume color. (B) Genomic structure of p1 and p2 alleles.
p1 alleles with the exception of P1-rr and p2 alleles contain three almost identical exons depicted in red. They also share a basal promoter
sequence. However, enhancer regions that were identified in P1-rr are absent from p2. p regulatory elements are drawn in shades of green. The
p2 coding sequence is flanked by fragments of Eninu (E) and Ji (J) retrotransposons. The P1 protein is a Myb-like transcriptional regulator of the
phlobaphene biosynthesis pathway that activates transcription of the target genes a1, chi1 and c2 by binding to a CCt/aACC site. p1 is also a
QTL for maysin accumulation. Maysin is a C-glycosyl flavone found in silk that confers resistance to corn. earworm (Helicoverpa zea, Boddie).
While p2 does not control phlobaphene pigmentation, it is involved in maysin synthesis. PCR primers designed for p2 allele cloning and
sequencing are indicated. Corn earworm image courtesy of Marlin E. Rice, Iowa State University Department of Entomology http://www.ent.

It encodes a R2R3 Myb-like transcription factor that
activates the structural genes c2, chi1 and a1 of the phlobaphene biosynthesis pathway (Figure 1B) [6]. Phlobaphenes, which are reddish flavonoid pigments,
accumulate in male and female floral organs. 2) The p1
gene is dispensable for the organism. Loss-of-function or
change-of-function alleles will not be eliminated from
the gene pool. 3) The p1 gene is characterized by its tremendous allelic diversity. More than hundred p1 alleles
with distinct spatial and temporal expression pattern are
reported although only few are molecularly defined [7].
4) Approximately 2.75 million years ago, the p1 gene
arose as a tandem duplication of the p2 gene [8]. If the
p2 gene is the older of the two, it probably is the orthologous gene copy to the p3 gene on chromosome 9 because
maize arose by allotetraploidization about 5 mya [9,10].
Therefore, we also refer to p2 as ortholog and p1 as paralog. The p2 gene is not involved in phlobaphene pigmentation, but like p1, is a QTL for maysin production
(Figure 1B) [11].
Phlobaphene pigmentation is most readily visible in the
pericarp, i.e. the outer layer of the kernel, and the cob
glumes. Traditionally, p1 alleles are phenotypically categorized and named based on expression in these tissues.
The p1 gene designation is followed by a two-letter suffix
that refers to pericarp and cob color, respectively. For
instance, the P1-rr allele exhibits red pericarp and red
cob glume pigmentation while the P1-rw allele has red
pericarp and white or colorless cob glumes (Figure 1A).
Each phenotypic p1 group may consist of structurally
very different alleles. Only few p1 alleles have been structurally determined of which only a small number has
been completely or partially sequenced. P1-rr4B2 [12]
and P1-rw1077 [13] are single copy genes that both were
introgressed into the inbred line 4Co63. This inbred line
contains a loss-of-function p1-ww allele. P1-wr in inbred
line B73 is a multi-copy allele, consisting of 11 P1-wr tandem repeats that are flanked by p2/p1 and p1/p2 hybrid
genes upstream and downstream of the cluster, respectively [10]. A large retroelement cluster is inserted in the
3’ UTR of the p1/p2 hybrid gene.
The p1-ww alleles do not encode a functional P1 transcription factor; therefore pericarp as well as cob glumes
are colorless (Figure 1A). While loss-of-function alleles
often result in deleterious or even lethal conditions for
the organism, non-functional p1 alleles do not cause any
impairment that would reduce the fitness of the mutant
plant. The p1-ww alleles can vary in origin and structure. Most of the structurally known p1-ww alleles are
derived from P1-rr by transposon insertions and/or excisions. The p1-ww1112 null allele, for example, arose
from a transposon-induced recombination event
between the 5.2-kb direct repeats, which led to the deletion of the entire coding sequence [14]. However, the

origin of p1-ww allele in the inbred line 4Co63 is not
known, but p1-ww[4Co63] is often used in genetic
crosses. Brink, for instance, introgressed more than
100 p1 alleles in the inbred line 4Co63 [7]. Knowledge
of the p1-ww[4Co63] sequence could help clarify
whether p1-ww[4Co63] is derived from P1-rr [12], P1-wr
[10,15], P1-rw [13] or even a different p1 allele and provide further insights into other intermediates of chromosomal rearrangements.
To shed light on the origin of p1 allelic variability, we
analyzed here three p1 alleles in their chromosomal context, namely p1-ww[4Co63], P1-rr4B2 and P1-rw1077.
First we resolve the structural organization of these p1
alleles and their corresponding p2 alleles on the singlenucleotide sequence level. Subsequently we compare
their sequences also to the recently sequenced P1-wr
[B73] cluster [10] to find large and small scale nucleotide
polymorphisms that enable us to infer mechanisms for
genome rearrangements. In particular, we focus on evolutionary changes in p1 alleles that occurred in the putative distal enhancer region and in the 3’ UTRs.

Results
The structural organization of p1-ww[4Co63] and linked
p2 gene

A partial genomic lambda library was constructed using
EcoRI-digested 4Co63 DNA. Filters were screened with
the probe p15 (Figure 2), which hybridizes to a distal
enhancer region thought to be present in all p1 alleles
at the time of p1-ww[4Co63] cloning. A lambda clone
containing 11,073-bp genomic DNA was isolated and
sequenced [GenBank:HM454274]. Interestingly, this
sequence is 99.7% identical to the displaced p1/p2[B73]
3’ UTR and its 3’ intergenic region, starting from an
EcoRI recognition sequence in the retrotransposon Opie,
and ending in an EcoRI site in the retroelement Shadowspawn (Figure 2).
The extensive similarity with the p1/p2[B73] 3’ end
and intergenic region together with the identical
Shadowspawn insertion suggests that both sequences
continue to be similar past the end of the lambda clone.
To confirm this assumption, we extended the sequence
by genomic PCR from the Shadowspawn element to
neighboring genes that are unrelated to p and therefore
do not participate in potential p recombination events.
PCR primer pairs were designed based on the equivalent
P1-wr[B73] cluster, and PCR products were cloned and
sequenced [GenBank:HM454275]. The analysis of 6,587
bp revealed that 4Co63 and B73 are virtually identical in
this sequence; they consist of the 3’ end of the Shadowspawn retroelement, a gene encoding a calmodulinbinding protein, part of a gene encoding a protein of
unknown function, and intergenic regions (Figure 2).
The calmodulin-binding protein, which in 4Co63

Figure 2 Schematic alignment of p non-coding sequences. p non-coding regions, which include regulatory elements (distal and proximal
enhancer and promoter), can be located upstream, downstream or on both sides of p coding sequences. However, only cis-elements in the
upstream non-coding regions have been shown to have regulatory function. P1-wr[B73] is the only p1 allele shown with a multi-gene structure,
as indicated by exon 3 stemming from a neighboring P1-wr[B73] repeat. Due to the tandem array, each P1-wr[B73] coding region is flanked by
this non-coding sequence. The p1/p2[B73] 5’ end (not shown) is identical to the P1-wr[B73] 5’ end. The p1/p2[B73] 3’ end is detached from the
p1/p2[B73] coding region due to retrotransposon insertions. Opie (light turquoise rectangle), Eninu (light yellow rectangle) and the displaced
former 3’ UTR of p1/p2[B73] (red bar) are displayed. A shadowspawn retroelement (not drawn to scale) is inserted further downstream. p1-ww
[4Co63] is virtually identical to the displaced p1/p2[B73] 3’ end. P1-rw1077 and P1-rr coding regions are bordered by large direct repeats (blue
rectangles). Both 5’ and 3’ repeats are depicted with their adjacent exons indicating the omitted coding region. p1-ww[4Co63] and the p1/p2
[B73] 3’ end are flanked by the same 5’ sequences as P1-rr and P1-rw1077 (namely Opie, Eninu and the displaced 3’ UTR). In addition, p1-ww
[4Co63] and p1/p2[B73] share the 3’ flanking sequences with P1-rr and P1-rw1077 as indicated by the downstream gene coding for a calmodulinbinding protein (cbp, pink pentagon). Notice that P1-wr[B73], P1-rw1077 and P1-rr vary mainly in a region that contains a fragmented MULE
insertion (purple rectangle) and a sequence specified by light blue rectangles, which is partially and completely duplicated in P1-rw1077 and
P1-rr, respectively. The orange bar stands for the MULE TIR that is missing in the 5’ P1-rr repeat. Regulatory elements, i.e. distal and proximal
enhancer and basal promoter, depicted in shades of green, were only determined for P1-rr. In other p genes or alleles, green rectangles merely
refer to sequence similarity with P1-rr. Functional homology has not been investigated. The dark yellow rectangle represents a further Mu-like
transposon that overlaps with the proximal enhancer and promoter region. A Heartbreaker MITE (blue bar) is part of the proximal enhancer
region. Transposable elements of various families are shown as triangles above the schematic sequences. Notice the missing Tourist MITE in
p1-ww[4Co63] and the displaced 3’ end of p1/p2[B73]. Exons (red rectangles) are added with the intention to facilitate orientation. The EcoRI
cloning sites and the hybridization site of probe 15 used to screen the lambda library for p1-ww[4Co63] sequencing are marked.

measures 361 aa, is 7 aa larger than in B73 and also
contains two amino acid substitutions due to 3 indels
and 10 SNPs. Based on maize and other EST data, this
gene is transcribed and is very conserved in grass species such as rice, sorghum and barley.
Although we could not find any remnants of p1 in the
3’ flanking regions, we also needed to extend the analysis to the 5’ flanking regions. We knew that a functional
p2 gene, as visualized in silk browning reactions, still
had to be present. The browning reaction of freshly cut
back silk correlates with silk maysin concentration and
is therefore induced by both p genes [16]. To extend the

sequences of p1-ww[4Co63] up to the p2 gene, we used
a genomic PCR approach by taking advantage of existing
p2, p2/p1[B73] and p1/p2[B73] sequences for the primer
design. We sequenced a total of 10,753 bp that include
the complete p2 and flanking sequences [GenBank:
HM454271] (Figure 3). No p1 fragments or traces were
detected. The p2[4Co63] and p2[p1ww1112] alleles with
their flanking sequences are 94.56% identical. They differ in 57 SNPs and multiple indels, of which the largest
consists of a Heartbreaker MITE insertion of 317 bp in
the second intron. Because the 1,008 bp coding
sequences of the two duplicated genes only vary by one

Figure 3 Schematic alignment of p1 and p2 alleles. P1-wr[B73], p1-ww[4Co63], P1-rw1077 and P1-rr4B2 alleles are represented as dark red and
their corresponding p2 alleles as light green pentagons with their apex pointing in the direction of transcription. The retrotransposon cluster
downstream of p2 that was only entirely sequenced in P1-wr[B73] is 68 kb in size. In all remaining lines only the end sequences of the cluster
that consist of Eninu (E), Ji (J) and Opie (O) retroelement fragments were determined. Downstream flanking genes, which encode a calmodulinbinding protein (here labeled as cbp) and an expressed protein (ep), are illustrated as pink pentagons. Both genes are conserved in grasses and
arranged in opposite transcriptional orientation to p alleles. Purple rectangles refer to a sequence that most likely originated as the 3’ intergenic
region of an ancestral p gene. Due to the duplication event that gave rise to p1 and p2, this region also became present upstream of p1 alleles
(see Figure 2 for details). The triangles on top of some purple rectangles stand for retrotransposon (Shadowspawn) insertions. The coding regions
of p2/p1[B73], p1/p2[B73] and P1-rw1077 consists of p2 and p1 sequences. In P1-rw1077, the 5’ end of exon 1 can be attributed to p1 while the 3’
end of exon 1, exon 2 and 3 and flanking retrotransposon sequences are derived from p2 [13]. Interestingly, the retroelements are followed by a
truncated P1-wr[B73] exon 3. Note that the drawing is not in scale.

synonymous substitution each in exon 2 and 3, their
deduced P2 protein sequences of 335 aa are identical
(Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1). RT-PCR
experiments confirm that p2[4Co63] is expressed in silk
tissue as predicted by the silk browning reaction (data
not shown).
The sequence 246 bp downstream of the p2 stop codon
is composed of a partial Eninu retroelement of 540 bp
followed by a Ji retrotransposon, which covers the
remaining 1,322 bp of the available sequence (Figure 3
and 4B). The 4Co63 p2 allele differs from the B73 p2
sequences extracted from the p2/p1[B73] and p1/p2[B73]
alleles in many SNPs and indels including transposon
insertions, suggesting that p1-ww[4Co63] may not have
arisen from P1-wr[B73] by recombination events in a
direct lineage.
Interestingly, the retrotransposons at the 3’ end of p2,
namely Eninu and Ji, and at the 5’ end of the above
described “p1-ww“ lambda clone, namely Opie and Eninu,
are identical to the retroelement cluster of P1-wr[B73] in

sequence, insertion site and consequently target site duplications. Although we did not clone and sequence the complete retroelement cluster in p1-ww[4Co63] it is most
likely that both clusters in 4Co63 and B73 are identical, at
least in their initial transposition of Eninu and their nested
insertions of Ji and Opie (Figure 3).
In brief, whereas p2 is present and functional in the
4Co63 inbred line, p1 coding and regulatory sequences are
missing with the exception of the distal enhancer region.
The structure of the p1-ww[4Co63] allele does not unambiguously point to a single known p1 allele where p1-ww
[4Co63] is derived from, although, mechanistically,
unequal crossing over between flanking sequences of the
p1 gene could have been involved as discussed below.

Figure 4 Polyadenylation sites of P1-wr[B73], P1-rr4B2 and p2. Figures A to C display the partial 3’ UTR sequences of P1-wr, p2 and P1-rr,
respectively. Numbers on the x-axis refer to the nucleotide position after the stop codon. The y-axis reflects the percentage of transcripts that
were polyadenylated at each nucleotide. (A) P1-wr[B73] polyadenylation sites. 18 polyadenylation sites are shown for P1-wr transcripts isolated
from pericarp tissue. The most frequently used polyadenylation sites are 298 nt and 301 nt downstream of the stop codon. (B) Polyadenylation
sites of p2 are located in a flanking LTR region. The sequence highlighted in yellow belongs to an Eninu retrotransposon that inserted 1.38 mya
in p2. The target site duplication (TSD) AAGAC upon insertion is highlighted in green. The first and second bp of the LTR are mutated from
TGCTGT to AACTGT. The majority of transcripts are polyadenylated within the LTR sequence. (C) Polyadenylation sites of P1-rr4B2 are located in a
flanking MULE sequence. The MULE sequence is highlighted in yellow and the potential TSD in green. Note the sequence gap 161-430 bp after
the stop codon, which does not contain any polyadenylation sites. All P1-rr4B2 transcripts are polyadenylated within the transposon.

pericarp and red glumes? P1-rr4B2 contains two large
repeats flanking the coding sequence, which are about
5.2 kb in size [6,12,17]. Interestingly, the sequence
upstream of the 5’ large repeat contains fragments of
Opie and Eninu retroelements inserted in the same position as in p1-ww[4Co63] and p1/p2[B73] as described
above (Figures 2 and 3). Likewise, Eninu is bordered by
the detached p 3’ UTR sequence of 78 bp. Subsequently,
P1-rr is highly similar to a single P1-wr[B73] copy with
few exceptions: the upstream regulatory region is more
complex in P1-rr than in P1-wr[B73] (Figure 2) and
both sequences diverge shortly after the stop codon (see
below). By sequencing two plasmids, SA206 and PA103,
which contain the 3’ large repeat and are derived from
lambda clones used for the isolation of P1-rr 5’ and coding sequences [18] (see Methods), we extended our
P1-rr sequence analysis by 8,923 bp past the 3’ large
repeat and into flanking genes [GenBank:HM454276].
By aligning both large repeats we found 14 polymorphisms including the insertion of a transposable element
of 1,616 bp in the 5’ repeat (Figure 2). This element is
flanked by 8-bp direct repeats (CCAGTGAG), which is
typical for transposons of the hAT superfamily. The 3’
large repeat following the upstream regulatory sequence
resembles p1-ww[4Co63] but does not contain the Shadowspawn retrotransposon insertion (Figures 2 and 3).
Furthermore, the final 4,341 bp of the plasmid insert,
not related to P1-rr, are highly similar to the equivalent
p1-ww[4Co63] and P1-wr[B73] sequences (Figures 2 and
3). The 3’ flanking sequence contains one complete
gene and one partial gene in opposite transcriptional
orientation compared to P1-rr. The first gene, which is
separated from P1-rr by 1,175 bp (measured from the
end of the 3’ P1-rr repeat to the stop codon), encodes
the 4Co63-type calmodulin-binding protein consisting
of 361 amino acids. No more than 609 bp of intergenic
sequence divide the first from the second gene, of which
only the final two exons are present in the plasmid
clone.
The P1-rr sequence analysis revealed that P1-rr is
located between the retroelement cluster and the gene
encoding a calmodulin-binding protein. Most interestingly, the corresponding site in p1-ww[4Co63] and P1wr[B73] is empty, i.e. this region does not contain a p1
gene copy (Figure 3). Based on the first maize p2 allele
that was isolated from a line which contains the p1ww1112 allele [8] we assume that a functional p2 allele
of P1-rr4B2 is present upstream of the retroelement
cluster because p1-ww1112 and P1-rr4B2 are both
derived from the same allele. Furthermore, the p2[p1ww1112] allele ends in Eninu and Ji retroelement fragments exactly like p2[4Co63] and p1/p2[B73] suggesting
structural similarity among these alleles. Therefore, we
decided to extend our sequence analysis to the p2 allele

Page 7 of 19

that is linked to P1-rr4B2. We used the same genomic
PCR strategy as described above to clone and sequence
10,423 bp of p2[P1-rr4B2] [GenBank:HM454272].
Indeed, the alignment of p2[P1-rr4B2] with p2[p1ww1112] showed no SNPs but only four 1-bp indels
that are not part of exons or putative regulatory
sequences. Hence both p2 alleles are coding for an identical P2 protein (Additional file 1: Supplemental
Figure S1). As expected, p2[P1-rr4B2] is also flanked by
Eninu and Ji retroelement sequences. Introgression of
P1-rr4B2 in 4Co63 probably included p2 as well because
p2[P1-rr4B2] differs from p2[4Co63].
The structural organization of P1-rw1077 and linked p2
gene

The P1-rw allele specifies red pericarp and colorless
cob glumes (Figure 1A). In general, the structure of
P1-rw1077 resembles P1-rr4B2 [13]. P1-rw1077 is a single-copy gene, which consists of a coding region flanked
by two 6.3-kb direct repeats (Figure 2). The coding
sequence of P1-rw1077 is chimeric in nature. While the
5’ UTR is similar to p1, the remaining coding region
and adjacent Eninu and Ji retroelements (spanning
about 6.9 kb) are p2-like (Figure 3) [13]. Sequence alignments establish that the p2 fragment is more closely
related to p2[P1-rr4B2]/[p1-ww1112] than to p2[4Co63].
Interestingly, the Ji retrotransposon is followed by a
truncated P1-wr-like exon, which is not included in the
P1-rw1077 transcript. This organization of sequences
suggests that P1-rw1077 originated from a gene conversion event between p1 and p2 [13]. The P1-rw1077
sequence upstream of the 5’ large repeat is very similar
to the corresponding P1-rr4B2 region, suggesting that
both alleles occupy the same chromosomal location. We
confirmed this by PCR-amplification and sequencing of
a 1,651-bp fragment that connects the 3’ large repeat of
P1-rw1077 with the gene encoding the calmodulin-binding protein. P1-rw1077 was introgressed in 4Co63, and
indeed the 3’ end of the intergenic region between the
3’ large repeat and the neighboring gene is indistinguishable from 4Co63. Since P1-rw1077 and P1-rr4B2
occupy the same chromosomal position we wanted to
find out whether the similarity extends to the region
upstream of the retrotransposon cluster (Figure 3). We
performed genomic PCR as described above to amplify
and subsequently sequence 11,313 bp [GenBank:
HM454273] that are 99.8% identical to the p2[4Co63]
sequence. The 18 SNPs and 3 short indels, which are
distributed over a consensus sequence of 10,703 bp, are
not included in the p2[P1-rw1077] coding sequence and
consequently do not alter the P2 protein sequence
(Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1). The polymorphisms between p2[P1-rw1077] and other p2 alleles
suggest that this p2 sequence was introgressed together

Goettel and Messing BMC Genomics 2010, 11:678
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/678

with P1-rw1077 into the 4Co63 background. This
implies that the p2 part of P1-rw1077, which is p2[P1rr4B2]-like, is derived from a p2 source other than p2
[P1-rw1077]. The p2[P1-rw1077] 3’ sequence is also
flanked by Eninu and Ji retroelement fragments, linking
p2[P1-rw1077] to P1-rw1077 across the retrotransposon
cluster (Figure 3).
In summary, while p1 alleles can be located on both
sides of the retroelement cluster (Figure 3), complete p2
alleles have so far only been found upstream of the retroelement cluster.
Evolution of a putative distal enhancer by nonhomologous end-joining and transposition

Because all known p1 alleles produce almost identical
P1 proteins (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1),
differential expression of p1 alleles could have evolved
through changes in regulatory sequences, which control
time-and tissue-specific p1 expression [17]. Sequences
containing regulatory elements are only determined for
P1-rr [19,20], but based on sequence similarities have
likely the same function in other p1 alleles as well.
While all known p1 alleles share the P1-rr promoter
and proximal enhancer sequences, they differ in the
sequence arrangement that contains the distal P1-rr
enhancer. Comparing putative distal enhancer regions of
p1 alleles reveals that the single P1-wr[B73] gene carries
the simplest and therefore possibly the most ancestral
form, which is confirmed by the presence of an almost
identical enhancer region at the 3’ intergenic region of
the p2 gene in a wild relative of maize (Teosinte accession Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) [8]. Complexity of
this chromosomal region increased with P1-rw1077 and
then P1-rr4B2. Therefore, we can use the changes in
sequence organization to explain the origin of the
P1-rw1077 and P1-rr4B2 enhancer region within the P1wr repeat context, where the 3’ end of one copy equals
the 5’ end of the downstream copy.
P1-rw1077 is a complex allele that must have been
shaped by multiple recombination events (Figure 3) [13].
Interestingly, the sequence following the p2 portion
resembles the junction of two P1-wr[B73] copies in a
head-to-tail arrangement, suggesting that P1-rw1077 arose
from P1-wr-like tandem repeats. The sequence similarity
between P1-rw1077 and P1-wr[B73] starts with the truncated exon 3. P1-rw1077 and P1-wr[B73] are identical
until they diverge 1,001 bp after the truncated P1-rw1077
exon 3. The next 734 bp of P1-rw are of mixed origin and
mostly unrelated to P1-wr. P1-rw continues its homology
with P1-wr 3’ of the 734-bp insertion, but not at the
sequence where both alleles deviate from each other.
Instead, the P1-rw sequence downstream of the insertion
is identical to the region of P1-wr upstream of the insertion, i.e. the insertion is flanked by a 203-bp repeat

sequence. The sequence after the point of divergence originated from an unknown Mu-like transposable element
(MULE) in reverse orientation (Additional file 2: Supplemental Figure S2). Based on BLASTN searches, the
sequence consists of two MULE fragments that in a putative autonomous MULE would be separated by approximately 444 bp (for additional information on this new
MULE family in the maize B73 genome see Additional file
3). While the initial 279 bp, starting with the TIR
(GGAAAAAATT...), are derived from the MULE 3’ end,
the remaining 446-bp fragment stems from a sequence
partially encoding the C-terminus of the MULE transposase. The final 9 bp (AACCTATGT) of the 734-bp insertion may represent filler DNA (see bottom panel of Figure
5). The 9-bp fragment is identical to a P1-wr[B73]
sequence, which is located 27 bp downstream of the point
of P1-rw1077 and P1-wr[B73] alignment. Filler DNA,
which is usually found at repair sites of DNA doublestrand breaks can be simple as described here or complex,
consisting of a patchwork of multiple sequences. Filler
DNA is associated with non-homologous end-joining and
is usually derived from nearby sequences of either end of
the break [21-23] (for additional information on the
mechanism of NHEJ see Additional file 4).
P1-rr is structurally more complex than P1-rw1077 and
a single P1-wr[B73] gene. P1-rw1077 and P1-rr contain
the same MULE fragments and filler DNA inserted in
exactly the same sequence position. However, a 1.2-kb
duplication in P1-rr that partially includes the fragmented MULE suggests that P1-rr is derived from
P1-rw1077. This duplication results in the addition of a
fourth exon, which is unique to P1-rr. A closer look at
the P1-rr 3’ UTR may help to shed light on the evolution of the P1-rr enhancer region (see bottom panel of
Figure 6).
Whereas P1-rw1077 and P1-rr are identical in the
initial 3’ UTR, they diverge 35 bp following the stop
codon. The next 13 bp (ATAATTGGGTCAC) in P1-rr
originated from two separated P1-rw1077 sequences,
1,410 bp apart, implying a deletion event in P1-rr compared to P1-rw1077. The 13-bp (ATAATTGGGTCAC)
insertion in P1-rr can be assigned to P1-rw1077
sequences upstream and downstream of the deletion
site. ATAATTGGG is duplicated 59 bp downstream
and includes the first two bp of the MULE TIR.
Obviously, the adjacent TCAC occurs frequently within
the P1-rw1077 sequence. However, the closest TCAC
can be located 21 bp upstream of the insertion site. The
13-bp P1-rr sequence subsequent of the point of divergence with P1-rw1077 is suggestive of filler DNA, indicating that a previous DNA double-strand break in
P1-rw1077 was restored by the NHEJ pathway. A tandem duplication of 1,269 bp that comprises the majority
of both MULE fragments and 3’ flanking enhancer

P1-rw1077 end adjacent to a P1-wr repeat. The top bar represents schematically a full length P1-wr repeat flanked by partial P1-wr copies on
both sides (drawn as dark grey, tan and light grey rectangles, respectively). The green rectangle indicates part of a sequence that was proven to
have enhancer function in P1-rr. A model demonstrating the progression from a P1-wr sequence to a unique P1-rw1077 enhancer structure is
briefly outlined. A DNA double-strand break was initiated by the excision of a Mu-like transposable element (purple triangle) and the resulting
gap was expanded by exonuclease activity. DNA repair was accomplished by non-homologous end-joining as implied by the presence of filler
DNA (yellow rectangle). The filler DNA AACCTATGT is derived from a sequence close to the deletion end point (see light grey balloon). The
neighboring 725 bp (purple rectangle) originated from the excised MULE. The light blue rectangles specify sequences that are duplicated due to
the deletion of less than a full-length P1-wr repeat. Note that the terminal P1-wr copy only contains the 5’ end and is similar to the 3’ large
repeat of P1-rr and P1-rw, which does not have any gene function and therefore should be considered as intergenic region. Due to the
unknown origin of P1-rw1077 and P1-rr, we use the designation P1-wr also for P1-wr-like alleles that share regulatory and coding regions with
P1-wr[B73].

sequences generated the current P1-rr 3’ end and
enhancer region.
In summary, DNA double-strand breaks in a P1-wrlike tandem array were probably repaired by NHEJ
events that could have resulted in the rearrangements
and duplications of enhancer-carrying sequences and
consequently in novel p1 alleles as discussed below.
The p alleles differ in their 3’ UTRs and polyadenylation
sites

Although p1 and p2 share nearly the same coding
sequences, their downstream sequences vary remarkably
(Additional file 5: Supplemental Figure S3). Sequence
alignments of p1 and p2 alleles revealed that the
P1-rr4B2 and p2 divergence from P1-wr[B73] is caused
by transposon insertions. In P1-rr4B2, a Mu-like element was placed 109 bp downstream of the stop codon
probably due to a deletion event (see above), and p2
alleles are followed by an Eninu retroelement 248 bp

after the stop codon. The insertion sites close to the
stop codon raise the question whether these transposable elements eliminated the transcription termination
signals and the polyadenylation sites in the P1-rr4B2
and p2 3’ UTRs. In general, the 3’ UTR is also important for post-transcriptional regulation such as microRNAs and translational control, and gain or loss of cis
elements within the 3’ UTR could contribute to allelic
diversity. Therefore, we decided to map the polyadenylation sites of these alleles.
The P1-wr[B73] coding sequence is not flanked by transposons, and its 3’ UTR probably represents the original 3’
UTR structure of all p alleles before transposon modifications. We performed 3’ RACE experiments to identify the
P1-wr[B73] 3’ UTR using three different gene-specific primers (p1 race 5’-1 to 3, see Table 1) and three independent pericarp tissue sources. RNA was extracted 20 days
after pollination (DAP) from plants that contain the P1-wr
[B73] cluster. Since the combination of different primers

Figure 6 Model for the origin of the unique P1-rr 3’ end and enhancer region by non-homologous end-joining and unequal crossover.
The bottom bar represents the unique P1-rr 3’ end with tandem direct repeats. The top bar shows schematically the junction sequence of two
P1-wr repeats drawn as tan and grey rectangles. The P1-wr copy at the right side was modified into a P1-rw-like sequence as outlined in Figure
5 (see MULE, filler DNA and repeats depicted as purple, pink and light blue rectangles, respectively). The green rectangle stands for part of a
sequence, which was shown to have enhancer function in P1-rr. A model explaining the conversion from a P1-wr and P1-rw1077 sequence to a
unique P1-rr structure is briefly described. A DNA double-strand break of unknown cause was expanded by exonuclease activity. DNA repair
occurred by non-homologous end-joining as evidenced by filler DNA (yellow rectangle). While the initial 9 bp (ATAATTGGG) of the filler DNA
stem from a sequence 55 bp downstream of the deletion end point (see light blue balloon), the adjacent 4 bp TCAC correspond to a sequence
21 bp upstream of the insertion site (tan balloon). The MULE fragment contains an 8-bp sequence TCGATGCC also found 1269 bp further
downstream (shown on top of the grey rectangle). Unequal crossover at the 8-bp site resulted in the duplication of the 1269-bp sequence in
tandem fashion and addition of a fourth exon.

and tissues gave the same result we merged the data sets
as shown in Figure 4A. Interestingly, we detected 18 polyadenylation sites in P1-wr[B73] that are spanning 189 nt
from 141 to 329 nt after the stop codon. However, 36% of
transcripts are polyadenylated 301 nt after the stop codon.
The P1-wr[B73] cluster consists of 11 P1-wr tandem
repeats and a p2/p1[B73] hybrid gene that differ by few
polymorphisms in their transcribed regions. As these 18
polyadenylation sites are not specific for a particular
repeat, the polymorphisms apparently do not affect the
polyadenylation signals.
RT-PCR results indicated that p2[4Co 63], p2[P1rr4B2] and p1/p2[B73] are expressed in silk tissue.
Accordingly, we carried out 3’ RACE experiments
using total RNA from silk and three different primers
(p2 race 5’-1 to 3, see Table 1), which hybridize to
exon 3 of p2. The RNAs extracted from p2[4Co63],
p2[P1-rr4B2] and p1/p2[B73] lines produced almost
identical results with all PCR primers, which allows
us to combine the data for ease of presentation

(Figure 4B). We found 19 polyadenylation sites in a
218-bp interval that is located between 139 and 356
nt past the p2 stop codon. Whereas seven minor
polyadenylation sites (adding up to 21% of the total
events) are upstream of the retrotransposon, 12 sites
lie within the LTR, including the major site (33% of
polyadenylated p2 mRNAs), which is 269 nt from the
stop codon and 22 nt into the LTR. The sequence
alignment between p2 and P1-wr[B73] shows that the
main polyadenylation site of P1-wr[B73] is 87 bp past
the point of p2 and P1-wr[B73] divergence. The
equivalent p2 fragment was displaced by retroelement
insertions, and therefore cannot serve its original
function. Nevertheless, p2 was able to recruit alternative polyadenylation signals and sites located mostly
in the Eninu LTR.
Subsequently, we performed 3’ RACE experiments on
P1-rr4B2 total RNA extracted from silk and one primer
binding (p2 race 5’-3, see Table 1) to exon 3. This exon
contains the 3’ UTR of the alternatively spliced P1-rr4B2

Goettel and Messing BMC Genomics 2010, 11:678

transcript, which encodes the functional P protein. We
sequenced significantly fewer clones compared to P1-wr
[B73] and p2 and obtained fewer polyadenylation sites.
While polyadenylation sites are distributed over 403 nt
from 143 to 545 nt measured from stop codon, the first
site is used most often (31%) (Figure 4C). All seven polyadenylation sites are located in the MULE fragments, two
within the TIR, the remainder in the transcribed part.
Due to the partial deletion of the former 3’ UTR alternative polyadenylation signals and sites had to be employed
from adjacent sequences as described above. Note that
the MULE borders P1-rr4B2 in opposite transcriptional
orientation. A transcript from an intact member of the
same MULE family could therefore produce antisense
RNA that is complementary to P1-rr4B2 mRNA.

Discussion
Models for the evolution of p1 alleles

A distinguishing feature of the p locus is its tremendous
allelic diversity, which makes it a preferable locus to
study evolutionary changes and chromosomal dynamics
on a larger and smaller scale. Although the grass family
arose by an ancient whole genome duplication (WGD)
event [24], the p gene has only a single ortholog in rice
and sorghum, indicating that one copy was lost from
the paleoploid ancestral genome. However, the more
recent allotetrapolidization event, which formed the
ancestor of maize about 5 mya [9], gave rise to two p
copies located in the homoeologous regions of chromosomes 9 and 1. The copy on chromosome 1 was then
duplicated in tandem 2.75 mya, thereby evolving into
the current p2 (ortholog) and p1 (paralog) genes [8,10].
The bulk of retrotranspositions in most grasses occurred
more recently. A series of nested insertions that split
approximately 80 bp of the p 3’ UTR occurred between
1.4 to 0.2 mya [10]. Although retroelements are highly
repetitive in the genome, insertions of retroelements in
a nested fashion create unique sequence junctions and
become chromosomal markers [25]. However, we do
not know whether the retroelements transposed into the
paralog or ortholog repeat, or maybe even into a latergenerated copy. A model proposed for the evolution of
single-copy alleles states that the retroelement insertion
occurred in the 3’ UTR of p2, thereby separating p1,
which turned into P1-rr and P1-rw [8,17] (Figure 3).
In contrast, transposition into the 3’ UTR of p1 retains
the repeat structure and allows the amplification of
additional copies by unequal crossover as suggested for
the evolution of the multi-copy P1-wr[B73] allele [10]
(Figure 3). Theoretically, only few recombination events
are needed to transfer p1 and p2 sequences across the
retroelement cluster. Therefore multi-copy alleles in a
tandem array could have been created upstream, downstream or on both sides of the cluster simultaneously.

Page 11 of 19

These intermediate structures that enable us to discover
the step-by-step evolution of all p alleles might still exist
in the maize germplasm. Our current analysis allows us
to present new and refined models for the evolution of
p1-ww[4Co63], P1-rr4B2 and P1-rw1077.
Models for the evolution of p1-ww[4Co63]

p1-ww is a null allele because p1 specific sequences such
as coding-, promoter-and proximal enhancer sequences
are absent in 4Co63 (Figure 3). Is it possible that p1-ww
[4Co63] represents a haplotype where the tandem duplication of the ancestral p gene never took place? According to this hypothesis, the nested retroelement
insertions in 4Co63 that are identical to alleles containing p1 and p2 sequences must have happened before
the p duplication event. However, since the p duplication occurred 2.75 mya, 1.37 million years before the
first retroelement insertion, we can disregard this possibility [8,10]. Thus, the alternative explanation that a
functional p1 allele was deleted to give rise to p1-ww
[Co63] is more likely. The p1-ww[4Co63] structure does
not reveal the functional p1 allele(s) and their deletion
or recombination events that resulted in the current
null allele. Considering that p1 alleles are located on
both sides of the retroelement cluster, multiple recombination events could have occurred to create the p1-ww
[4Co63] allele.
One possible scenario for the origin of p1-ww in
inbred line 4Co63 is that the null allele, which carries a
functional p2, is derived from P1-wr[B73]. While
unequal crossover among repeat sequences can lead to
an increase of copy numbers, the alternative outcome is
a reduction of repeats. During the evolution of the P1wr[B73] allele, unequal crossover between the flanking
genes of the cluster, namely p2/p1[B73] and p1/p2[B73],
could have caused the deletion of all P1-wr[B73] repeats,
and would still have generated a functional p2 gene
(Figure 7A). However, p2 in 4Co63 differs by various
SNPs and indels from the corresponding p2/p1[B73]
and p1/p2[B73] sequences of P1-wr[B73], indicating that
P1-wr[B73] might not be the immediate progenitor for
p1-ww[4Co63].
p1-ww[4Co63] also could have evolved by a recombination event that involved two different p1 alleles.
Unequal crossing over between p2 of P1-rr4B2 and p1/
p2[B73] of P1-wr[B73] could have generated the current
p1-ww[4Co63] structure and could have restored the p2
copy (Figure 7B). Even then, the deletion of the original
paralog would have been derived from the P1-wr[B73]
allele. Nevertheless, this could not have happened
recently (on an evolutionary time scale) because of
sequence polymorphisms in the participating alleles.
Interestingly, both p1-ww[4Co63] and P1-wr[B73] carry
as a signature the Shadowspawn retroelement in the

Figure 7 Models for the origin of p1-ww[4Co63]. Various models may help explain the evolution of p1-ww[4Co63]. Notice that the same color
code is used here as in Figure 3, which illustrates schematic alignment of p1 and p2 alleles. (A) Expansion and contraction of the p locus
generates P1-wr[B73] and p1-ww[4Co63], respectively. A simplified representation of the P1-wr[B73] cluster is shown. Unequal crossing over
between p2/p1[B73] (or p2) and p1/p2[B73] could have caused the deletion of the internal P1-wr[B73] repeats. Such a recombination event could
have occurred any time during the evolution of the cluster, independent of the P1-wr copy number, retroelement insertions at the 3’ end and
the deletion at the p2/P1-wr junction sequence. (B) Similarly, alignment along the retrotransposon cluster and crossover between P1-rr and P1-wr
[B73] could have generated the p1-ww[4Co63] structure. (C) A misalignment at the repeat sequences of P1-rw-like alleles, which contained the
simple P1-wr[B73] distal enhancer region, and unequal crossover could have led to a duplication or deletion event giving rise to p1-ww[4Co63].
However, this model does not account for the Shadowspawn retroelement in p1-ww[4Co63].

same position, indicating that p1-ww[4Co63] most likely
derived from P1-wr[B73] in multiple steps.
In addition, we can envision a P1-rw-like allele, which is
similar to P1-wr[B73] in the distal enhancer structure. Such
a P1-rw allele has been described [17]. An unequal crossover between the large repeats flanking the coding regions
duplicates the p1 gene or deletes the coding sequences,
resulting in the p1-ww[4Co63] structure (Figure 7C). This
scenario resembles the origin of p1-ww1112 [14]. However,
this model does not directly account for the Shadowspawn
retroelement in p1-ww[4Co63]. All models demonstrate the
complexity of the p locus and reveal the countless possibilities for recombination to occur whenever paralogous
sequences are present.
Model for the evolution of P1-rw1077 and P1-rr4B2, with
focus on regulatory sequences

Despite the repeat structure of the P1-wr[B73] cluster, a
single P1-wr[B73] copy has the least complicated p1

Page 13 of 19

allele composition, followed by P1-rw1077 and then
P1-rr4B2. We hypothesize that P1-rw1077 originated
from a P1-wr-like tandem array (Figure 5) because
P1-rw1077 comprises a sequence fragment downstream
of the p2 section that is virtually identical with the junction sequence of two P1-wr[B73] repeats in a head-totail assembly. This P1-wr tandem array could have been
located on either side of the retroelement cluster.
A plausible sequence of events is as follows. A
Mu-like element inserted into one of the P1-wr repeats
1,204 bp after exon 3 of the previous copy. Then an
aberrant transposition event (abortive excision event) of
this MULE caused a DNA double-strand break that
enabled exonucleases to digest the unprotected DNA
ends (Figure 5) thereby extending the gap into the adjacent P1-wr repeat. The deletion would have included
MULE sequences (about 3.5 kb compared to a putative
autonomous element) and almost the entire length of a
P1-wr repeat (more than 12 kb). Non-homologous endjoining [21-23,26], copying a 9-bp sequence (AACCTATGT) that is located 27 bp downstream from the
deletion endpoint, must have repaired the break. Due to
the nature of tandem repeats, the large deletion
described above results in small repeats of 203 bp that
are flanking the MULE fragments. Interestingly, this
duplication is part of a 1.2-kb sequence that contains
the enhancer element of P1-rr.
A single P1-wr-like allele downstream of the retroelement cluster that is flanked by large repeats due to the
retroelement insertion in p2 could have been converted
into a tandem array by unequal crossover between the
large repeats (Figure 7C). Gene conversion events then
could have transferred the altered region that originated
at the 3’ large repeat to the 5’ large repeat where the
distal enhancer sequence functions [17]. Alternatively,
P1-rw1077 arose from P1-wr repeats upstream of the retrotransposon cluster. The sequence 3’ of this cluster,
which corresponds to the 3’ intergenic region of p2 as
found in the P1-wr[B73] cluster and p1-ww[4Co63], is
nearly identical with the 5’ end of a P1-wr[B73] repeat
over a stretch of 5.2 kb (Figure 2 and Additional file 6:
Supplemental Figure S4A). Due to this sequence similarity, a recombination event between p1-ww[4Co63] and
the proposed P1-rw1077 precursor could have occurred
that positioned P1-rw1077 downstream of the retrotransposon cluster (Additional file 6: Supplemental Figure
S4A). This arrangement assumes that the P1-rw1077
allele resembles p1-ww[4Co63] at the 5’ end. After the
recombination break point, P1-rw1077 has to be closer to
P1-wr[B73] because, based on our model, P1-rw1077 is
derived from P1-wr. Indeed, a sufficient amount of polymorphisms between the p1-ww[4Co63] and P1-wr[B73]
alleles enables us to verify the predicted structure and to
place the possible recombination site between 567 and

Goettel and Messing BMC Genomics 2010, 11:678
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/678

713 bp after the point of p1-ww[4Co63] and P1-wr[B73]
alignment. Further recombination/gene conversion
events contributed to the evolution of the present
P1-rw1077 allele.
The presence of the MULE fragments and filler DNA
in P1-rr in exactly the same sequence context as in
P1-rw1077 agrees with our model that P1-rr continued
to evolve from P1-rw1077. In our model for the origin
of P1-rr, we propose a second DNA double-strand break
(DSB) that occurred in P1-rw1077 in between the stop
codon and the MULE insertion (Figure 6). In contrast
to the first DSB, there is no evidence for the participation of a TE, leaving the cause for the DSB unknown.
Exonuclease activities expanded the gap until both ends
were joined in a NHEJ fashion by synthesizing two short
DNA pieces (filler DNAs) from sites close to the deletion end points into the repair site. The DSB repair
caused a deletion of 1,410 bp across the repeat junction
that spanned almost the entire sequence from the stop
codon to the MULE fragments. Interestingly, this intermediate P1-rr structure can be found at the 3’ end of
P1-rr1088, P1-rrCFS36 and P1-rwCFS342 [17].
The 5’ transposon fragment happened to contain an
8-bp sequence close to the TIR (55-62 bp) that is present 1,269 bp further downstream as well. Unequal
crossover between those 8 bp resulted in a tandem
direct duplication of this 1,269 bp sequence. Accordingly, the final 318 bp of exon three, being part of the
repeat, were replicated, too. A sequence at the 3’ end of
the first repeat was adopted as a splice acceptor site
thereby generating a fourth exon. Although alternative
splicing of exon 1, 2 and 4 has been reported, the protein product is of unknown function or may not have
any function at all [27].
This putative evolutionary pathway explains how the
P1-wr 3’ UTR was almost entirely replaced by a MULE,
how the fourth exon unique to P1-rr was generated and
how the 1,269 bp SalI fragment containing the P1-rr
distal enhancer was nearly completely duplicated (the
initial 175 bp of the enhancer region are missing from
the first repeat). Subsequently, gene conversion events
could have placed part of the modified enhancer
sequence of the downstream copy to the upstream large
repeat [17]. Alternatively, if this P1-rr module arose on
the P1-wr[B73] side of the retroelement cluster as we
also discussed for P1-rw1077, then a recombination
event between p1-ww[4Co63] and the P1-rr ancestor
could have transferred the P1-rr end to a position
downstream of the retrotransposon cluster (Additional
file 6: Supplemental Figure S4B). The crossing over took
place in the 595 bp sequence between the duplicated
MULEs, which is why the repeat structure of P1-rr at
the 5’ end differs from the 3’ end whereas they are identical in P1-rw1077. Lastly, a 1.6 kb hAT-like

Page 14 of 19

transposable element inserted 340 bp upstream of the
MULE or 159 bp 5’ of the enhancer region. This transposition did not occur in P1-rr1088 [17]. Taken
together, the novel distal enhancer structure of P1-rr
could be the result of a MULE insertion and excision,
deletion and repair by NHEJ, and duplication and deletion by recombination. This series of events from P1-wr
to P1-rr confirms the sequential model of P1-rw and
P1-rr evolution based on phylogentic analysis [17].
Function of the enhancer region rearrangements on p1
expression

When the p1 paralog was formed, it probably included
the complete p coding sequence and the basal promoter
that controls p expression in silk tissue. Then the paralog
acquired two additional regulatory sequences adding
equally to the basal expression in pericarp and glume.
The enhancer sequences were identified and tested in
transient and transgenic plants using P1-rr fragments
fused to a GUS reporter gene [19,20]. A 1-kb sequence
adjacent to the promoter contains a regulatory sequence
termed proximal enhancer while a 1.2-kb fragment
further upstream includes a distal enhancer (Figure 2).
The proximal enhancer region corresponds mostly to a
truncated MULE that captured part of a host gene in
between the TIR [10]. The proximal enhancer region and
the basal promoter sequence are virtually identical in all
sequenced p1 alleles to date (Figure 2). In contrast, the
distal enhancer region varies in all p1 alleles as described
above. Therefore, we hypothesize that the different spatial and temporal expression patterns of p1 alleles are
caused by distinct distal enhancer regions [17]. The distal
enhancer as defined in P1-rr is located within a 1,269-bp
SalI fragment [19,20], out of which 671 bp are derived
form the Mu-like transposon (Figure 2). Although this
MULE fragment is missing in P1-wr[B73], transgenes
constructed from P1-wr upstream regulatory sequences
linked to P1-rr cDNA produced red pericarp and cob
glumes in transgenic plants [28], indicating that the
enhancer sequence is included in the 589-bp region
downstream of the MULE. Since this 589-bp region is
duplicated in P1-rr, P1-rr has two enhancer sites that are
separated by the MULE fragment. Additional P1-rr
alleles, namely P1-rr1088 and P1-rrCFS36, were shown to
have the same enhancer structure as P1-rr4B2 with
exception of the missing hAT insertion in P1-rr1088 [17].
Therefore, the hAT transposable elements inserted in the
upstream copy of the enhancer region of P1-rr4B2 and
P1-rrCFS36 obviously do not disrupt the enhancer
sequence and function. Compared to P1-rr, P1-rw1077
has a deletion of 381 bp in the upstream repeat, which
causes the loss of cob glume pigmentation [13]. Interestingly, two additional P1-rw alleles, P1-rwCFS302 and P1rwCFS342, lack the entire upstream repeat and the MULE

Goettel and Messing BMC Genomics 2010, 11:678
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/678

fragment, thus having the identical enhancer arrangement
as a single P1-wr[B73] copy [17]. Taken together, the analysis of three P1-rr and three P1-rw alleles revealed that
P1-rr alleles contain two copies of the specific enhancer
sequence while P1-rw alleles only have one [17]. Interestingly, this region coincides with a tissue-specific DNase Ihypersensitive site that remains closed in pericarp tissue of
P1-pr, a silenced epiallele of P1-rr4B [29]; the P1-pr phenotype is shown in Figure 1A. It was reasoned that the
upstream enhancer repeat that is missing in P1-rw1077
controls the glume-specific expression in a positiondependent manner, since the identical enhancer region is
located 671 bp further downstream [13]. An alternative
explanation was prompted by the fact that p1 expression
in pericarp is weaker and delayed in P1-rw1077 compared
to P1-rr. We hypothesize that the transcriptional strength
of p1 alleles is correlated with the enhancer copy number,
which is supported by similar findings in human upstream
enhancers [30]. Consequently, P1-rw1077 produces less P1
protein than P1-rr in all expressing tissues. Also, each p1
allele is not expressed uniformly in female and male floral
tissues within a plant. For example in P1-rr, p1 transcription is usually higher in pericarp than in cob glumes [15].
Therefore, we propose that the presence of only one
distal enhancer site in the P1-rw1077 allele results in
weak expression in pericarp tissue but no expression in
cob glumes. Due to the duplication of the enhancer
sequence as outlined in our model, p1 transcription in
pericarp and glume tissue was equally elevated such that
p1 is strongly expressed in pericarp and weakly
expressed in glumes, thereby giving rise to P1-rr alleles.
Note that comparisons with P1-wr alleles are not appropriate due to their post-transcriptional silencing, which
potentially is repeat induced [31]. This model is supported by an analysis of the spatial expression pattern in
transgenic plants where various p1 constructs were
expressed only in few p expressing tissues, resembling
P1-rr or P1-rw phenotypes. It was shown in these transgenic plants that p1 expression follows a spatial hierarchy that begins with pericarp and continues with cob
glumes, husk, silk, and tassel glumes in decreasing order
[32,33]. For instance, if the transgenes had been
expressed in only one tissue, then it would have had to
be in pericarp, in the case of two tissues then in pericarp and glumes, and so on.
The p alleles differ in their 3’ UTR

Polyadenylation is involved in many facets of mRNA
metabolism including enhancement of mRNA stability,
transport of mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and regulation of mRNA translation. Although
polyadenylation signals in plants are less conserved than
in mammals [34], three signals were identified in maize,
rice, and Arabidopsis: the far upstream element (FUE,

Page 15 of 19

located -150 to -35 nt upstream of the cleavage site),
the near upstream element (NUE, situated -35 to -10 nt
upstream of the cleavage site) and the cleavage element
(CE, positioned -10 to +15 nt upstream and downstreams of the cleavage site) [35,36]. As we have shown
above, a fragmented MULE was placed adjacent to the
P1-rr4B2 stop codon possibly due to a NHEJ event. All
mapped polyadenlation sites of the P1-rr4B2 transcript
are located within the MULE sequence, indicating that
P1-rr4B2 successfully recruited alternative polyadenylation signals in the transposon. Similarly, a Mu insertion
in the 3’ UTR of the rf2a locus also resulted in the
adoption of new polyadenylation signals and sites [37].
Retroelements, the most common transposons in maize,
also insert in 3’ UTRs without disrupting polyadenylation as demonstrated above for the p2 alleles. Our
results suggest that polyadenylation in maize is a highly
dynamic process which despite its importance for the
cell is not tightly regulated. The large amount of polyadenylation sites found in our analysis of P1-wr[B73]
transcripts that do not contain a transposon insertion
supports this conclusion. A genome-wide analysis of
genomic and transcript data could shed light on the
mechanism of polyadenylation in maize and could establish the proportion of genes that terminate in transposable elements. Interestingly, it has been shown that many
polyadenlylation signals in human and mouse genes
have been derived from transposable elements [38].
Besides polyadenylation signals, transcriptional as well
as translational regulators have been identified in the
3’ UTR of plant and animal genes, and their gain or loss
could cause allelic diversity. For example, targets of
microRNAs are often located in 3’ UTRs [38,39].
Gene copying events promote allelic diversity

Recombination is crucial for the evolution of genomes
[40,41]. In particular, the non-homologous recombination pathway is frequently used to repair DNA doublestrand breaks in somatic plant cells [26]. Previously, we
reported a probable NHEJ event involved in the formation of the P1-wr[B73] cluster [10] that produced a
hybrid gene due to the ligation of deletion end points
located within two genes. Similarly, deletions and repair
by NHEJ in the above mentioned alleles could have
resulted in the restructuring of an enhancer region and
formation of a novel 3’ UTR.
The exceptional allelic variation at the p locus
prompts the question about its similarities and differences to genes that exhibit less variation. We propose
that the main cause for the diversity might lie in tandem
gene amplification [8,17,42,43]. Once a gene underwent
an initial tandem duplication, multiple unequal recombination events can follow as seen in the P1-wr[B73]
multi-gene cluster [10]. A single crossing over or gene

Goettel and Messing BMC Genomics 2010, 11:678
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/678

conversion event between misaligned paralogous gene
copies can generate many new alleles including deletion
and amplification derivatives. Interestingly, in plants
such events can occur mitotically and can be transmitted into the next generation, thereby increasing allelic variation [44]. This explanation then implies that
other loci exhibiting an increased allelic variation are
multi-copy genes as well. Indeed, the complex r1 locus
in maize is analogous to p1 in many aspects. The r1
locus, which also encodes a transcription factor, confers
bluish anthocyanin pigmentation to various vegetative
and floral plant tissues. Two r1 alleles, R-st and R-r, are
molecularly well characterized. R-st contains various r1
genes, four of which are in tandem orientation [45]. R-r
consists of one complete and three truncated r1 genes
that originated from tandem duplication [46,47]. Comparable to p1 in complexity, both alleles undergo recombination and transposition events creating numerous
derivative alleles. Paralogous gene copies in maize were
also found at the pl1 [48] and a1 loci [49]. Especially
the prolamine gene family with nearly 50 copies distributed over several chromosomes exemplifies the outcome
of gene duplications [50]. Actually, a large proportion of
genes are tandemly duplicated in Arabidopsis, rice, and
maize [51-53]. Considering the amount of paralogous
sequences and their possibilities to recombine, a single
reference genome providing just one allele can obviously
not reflect this allelic potential of the maize genome.
Not surprisingly, a recent genomic comparison between
the B73 and Mo17 inbred lines [54] revealed a large
quantity of copy number variations and presence/
absence variations confirming previous results [55].
Nonetheless, epialleles remain invisible in a traditional
sequence comparison. Allelic diversity studies as presented here are essential for our understanding of the
remarkably dynamic maize genome.

Conclusion
Allelic diversity is the source for evolution and domestication. While allelic variation in wild species ensures the
best possible adaption to changing environmental conditions, humans have profited from allelic pools in crop
plants by selecting phenotypic variations that best meet
their needs. Alleles differ most often in small-scale
nucleotide polymorphisms but also in large-scale
sequence rearrangements. Maize has been shown to be
a highly polymorphic species well suited to study
genome dynamics and the underlying molecular
mechanisms. In particular, the maize p locus with its
well-established genetic history offers a tremendous
amount of ancient allelic variations, some representing
intermediate steps in large-scale sequence rearrangements. The tandemly duplicated p1 and p2 genes
encode virtually identical Myb-like transcriptional

Page 16 of 19

activators, but only p1 controls the accumulation of reddish flavonoid pigments in maize female and male floral
organs. Because all P1 proteins are almost identical, the
phenotypic variation must be due to p1 regulation.
Therefore, this locus represents an ideal example of how
genomic rearrangements can contribute to novel regulatory elements.
Here, we used targeted genome sequencing to apply
comparative genomics to the maize genome. Sequence
alignments of orthologs and paralogs of different genotypes of a single genomic region allow us to reconstruct
the repair of double strand breaks from transposition
events within gene copies and their flanking regions.
Such drastic invasions of new sequence elements in
flanking regions result in the de novo creation of regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional and
post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression that
differentiate gene copies in their function. Interestingly,
sequence chimerism in the 3’ untranslated portion of
the mRNA gave rise to multiple poly-A addition signals
with similar strength, indicating a more relaxed
sequence restriction of the 3’ processing machinery than
previously believed.

Methods
Plant material

Seeds containing P1-rr4B2 and P1-rw1077 alleles, which
were introgressed in a 4Co63 background, were thankfully provided by Tom Peterson, Iowa State University.
The inbred lines B73 and 4Co63 carrying P1-wr and
p1-ww alleles, respectively, were obtained from the Maize
Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (maizecoop.cropsci.
uiuc.edu) collection. Traditionally, p1 alleles are classified
and named according to their pericarp and cob glume
pigmentation, implicating that phenotypically similar but
structurally different alleles share the same name. In this
report, we use the inbred line where the p1 allele was originally described in as additional allelic designation such
as P1-wr[B73] and p1-ww[4Co63]. Similarly, the inbred
line will be used as allele description for p2, for example
p2[4Co63]. Whenever the p2 source is unknown, the
name of the linked p1 allele will be added to p2, such as
p2[P1-rr4B2] and p2[P1-rw1077].
p1-ww[4Co63] isolation and sequencing

The inbred line 4Co63 contains a p1-ww allele, according to the colorless pericarp and cob phenotype of
4Co63 ears. We constructed a size-restricted lambda
library using a lambda DASH II/EcoRI vector kit (Agilent Technologies) and EcoRI-digested 4Co63 genomic
DNA. The lambda library was screened by hybridizing
filters with probe 15 [12], which is derived from a distal
enhancer fragment of P1-rr and is unique to p1 alleles.
Two positively hybridizing lambda clones were isolated

Goettel and Messing BMC Genomics 2010, 11:678
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/678

and subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ vectors (Agilent
Technologies). Insert size and both end sequences of
each clone were determined and found identical. A
transposon minilibrary (Finnzymes) of one clone was
constructed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed with the ABI PRISM
BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
kit and an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer (Applied BioSystems). Sequence assembly and analysis were carried
out using Lasergene (DNAstar) programs. Sequence
gaps were closed by primer walking.
p2 amplification and sequencing

Genomic PCR was performed to amplify p2 alleles. PCR
primers (see Table 1) (Figure 1B) were designed based
on p2 sequences from p2[p1-ww1112] [8], p2/p1[B73]
and p1/p2[B73] [10]. The PCR-amplified products were
cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The individual clones were completely sequenced using primers
that are spanning the entire repeat length (approximately one primer every 300 bp, primer sequences available upon request). The sequencing reactions were
carried out with the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit and analyzed on
an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer (Applied BioSystems).
The sequences were assembled and evaluated with the
Lasergene software (DNAstar).
Sequencing of P1-rr 3’ noncoding region and flanking
genes

The majority of P1-rr sequence was determined in
P1-ovov1114 (orange variegated pericarp and cob) that
is derived from P1-vv. The Ac element of P1-vv located
in the second intron excised and reinserted 161 bp
further upstream in the opposite direction [56], still
allowing a considerable amount of phlobaphene accumulation in pericarp and cob. Similarly, P1-rr4B2 is a
P1-rr revertant that also originated from P1-vv by Ac
excision. When not otherwise specified, we use P1-rr
(without additional allele designation) to refer to functional P1-rr alleles that are derived from the same P1vv. Two EcoRI fragments, isolated from P1-ovov1114,
were cloned in lambda using two EcoRI recognition sites
outside of P1-ovov1114. The third site was provided by
the Ac transposon [18]. The 3’ fragment of 14.5 kb was
further divided in two plasmids, SA206 and PA103,
which we gratefully received from Thomas Peterson. A
transposon minilibrary of both plasmids (Finnzymes)
was constructed as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Clones were sequenced using transposon primers, ABI
3730 capillary sequencers, and the ABI PRISM BigDye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit
(Applied BioSystems). Both plasmids contain 12418 bp
non-overlapping P1-rr and 3’ flanking sequences.

Amplification and sequencing of p1 intergenic region and
flanking genes

Genomic PCR was performed to amplify p1 intergenic
region and flanking genes. PCR primers (see Table 1)
were designed based on corresponding sequences from
B73 [10] and P1-ovov1114 (this study). The PCR products were cloned, sequenced and analyzed as described
above for p2.
Amplification of 3’ cDNA ends (3’ RACE)

Total RNA was extracted from pericarp tissue 20 days
after pollination and emerging silk with the RNeasy
Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was reverse-transcribed
to cDNA using the GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen) with the
GeneRacer oligo(dT) primers. cDNA was PCR amplified
with the GeneRacer 3’ primer and a gene-specific primer
(see Table 1). In general, 96 RT-PCR products per primer pair (but only 18 for P1-rr4B2 samples) were
cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and
sequenced with universal primers. DNA sequences were
analyzed with Lasergene (DNAstar) software. Polyadenylation sites were only plotted in Figure 6A to 6C, when
they occurred more than once.
Sequence annotation and GenBank accession numbers

The maize sequences were manually annotated using
homology searches in various GenBank databases with
multiple BLAST programs [57]. The sequences were
submitted to GenBank and were assigned following
accession numbers: p2[4Co63]: HM454271, p2[P1rr4B2]: HM454272, p2[P1-rw1077]: HM454273, p1-ww
[4Co63]: HM454274, p1-ww[4Co63] 3’ flanking region:
HM454275, P1-ovov1114 3’ end: HM454276
