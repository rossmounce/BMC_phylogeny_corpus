Abstract
Background: Although many genomic features have been used in the prediction of proteinprotein interactions (PPIs), frequently only one is used in a computational method. After realizing
the limited power in the prediction using only one genomic feature, investigators are now moving
toward integration. So far, there have been few integration studies for PPI prediction; one failed to
yield appreciable improvement of prediction and the others did not conduct performance
comparison. It remains unclear whether an integration of multiple genomic features can improve
the PPI prediction and, if it can, how to integrate these features.
Results: In this study, we first performed a systematic evaluation on the PPI prediction in
Escherichia coli (E. coli) by four genomic context based methods: the phylogenetic profile method,
the gene cluster method, the gene fusion method, and the gene neighbor method. The number of
predicted PPIs and the average degree in the predicted PPI networks varied greatly among the four
methods. Further, no method outperformed the others when we tested using three well-defined
positive datasets from the KEGG, EcoCyc, and DIP databases. Based on these comparisons, we
developed a novel integrated method, named InPrePPI. InPrePPI first normalizes the AC value (an
integrated value of the accuracy and coverage) of each method using three positive datasets, then
calculates a weight for each method, and finally uses the weight to calculate an integrated score for
each protein pair predicted by the four genomic context based methods. We demonstrate that
InPrePPI outperforms each of the four individual methods and, in general, the other two existing
integrated methods: the joint observation method and the integrated prediction method in
STRING. These four methods and InPrePPI are implemented in a user-friendly web interface.
Conclusion: This study evaluated the PPI prediction by four genomic context based methods, and
presents an integrated evaluation method that shows better performance in E. coli.

Background
Uncovering all protein-protein interactions (PPIs), or, the
interactome, of an organism is essential for understanding
its complex biological processes [1,2]. Recently, many
high-throughput experimental and computational methods have been developed and applied to model organisms
such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), yeast, and humans [3-10].
High-throughput experimental methods can directly
detect the set of PPIs in a genome, but the capacity to identify PPIs is still limited by present technology. Computational approaches, which usually mine and then utilize
the features from the known PPIs and the genomic information from one or multiple genomes, can largely meet
this strong demand [11]. The major limitation in both the
computational and experimental approaches is their
uncertain confidence in the identification of PPIs, with
high false-positive and false-negative rates [12,13].
Genomic context information has been frequently used in
the computational methods for PPI prediction. There are
four major genomic context based methods: the phylogenetic profile method [14], the gene cluster method [3], the
gene fusion method [15], and the gene neighbor method
[16]. Each method mainly utilizes one specific genomic
context feature; thus, its prediction has biases towards the
information it relies on [12]. There is one comparison of
the phylogenetic profile, gene fusion, and gene neighbor
methods, suggesting that the gene neighbor method
might outperform the other two [17,18]. To date, there
have been no other systematic evaluations of these four
methods. It is likely that an integration of these methods
would take advantage of different genomic features and
thus outperform each of these four methods [12]. Indeed,
investigators now realize the importance of integration
[19,20]. The integration strategy has been applied in two
methods: the joint observation method [3,14,21] and
STRING [22]. The joint observation method selects the
PPIs that are predicted or identified by more than one
method [10,21]. Its rationale is based on the understanding that the confidence of PPI prediction relies on the
amount of supporting evidence, and that the confidence
increases with more evidence (i.e., methods). This strategy
was successfully demonstrated in Uetz et al. [23] and von
Mering et al. [12]. However, the joint observation method
results in a strong decrease of the coverage, especially
when the number of methods becomes large. Since an
efficient approach to inferring PPIs needs to consider both
coverage and accuracy, the joint observation method has
limited applications [12,24]. STRING calculates a combined score for each pair of proteins assuming that the features from various sources are independent [22]. While
this scoring algorithm has been implemented in the
STRING database, there is no evaluation on the improvement of PPI prediction.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/414

In this study, we first performed a systematic evaluation
on the prediction efficacy of these four genomic context
based methods by using three gold standards of positive
datasets obtained from the KEGG [25], EcoCyc [26], and
DIP databases [27], respectively. We used E. coli K12 in
this study because it is the most studied prokaryotic
organism and its protein annotations are available in several databases. Our evaluation indicated that there is no
consensus among these methods and no method could
outperform the others in all tests. Based on these comparisons, we developed a new method to integrate the features used in all four methods. We named the method
InPrePPI (an Integrated method for Prediction of ProteinProtein Interactions). InPrePPI first calculates a score for
each protein-protein pair predicted by each method, then
optimally weighs the score, and finally obtains an integrated score. Based on the integrated score, InPrePPI
extracts the PPIs with high confidence from all of the predicted protein pairs. Our comparison of InPrePPI with the
joint observation method and STRING indicates that
InPrePPI in general outperforms the others. Finally, we
implemented the four genomic context based methods
and InPrePPI in a user-friendly platform-independent system.

Results
Comparison of the PPIs predicted by the four methods
We performed a systematic evaluation on the prediction
of PPIs in E. coli K12 by four genomic context based methods: the phylogenetic profile, gene cluster, gene fusion
and gene neighbor methods. Throughout the rest of this
paper, we will abbreviate these four methods as "PPM",
"GCM", "GFM", and "GNM", respectively. The prediction
results are summarized in Table 1. The number of predicted PPIs was 45,437 (PPM), 2,437 (GCM), 6,728
(GFM), and 3,595 (GNM), respectively. These numbers
varied greatly; for example, the number of PPIs predicted
by the PPM is approximately 19 times more than was predicted by the GCM.

We next examined the average degree for the PPIs predicted by the four methods. The degree is the most elementary characteristic of a node in a biological network
[28]. If the average degree in the predicted network is
much lower than the expected, it may reflect that the prediction does not have a good coverage of the PPIs in the
genome. Conversely, if it is much higher than the
expected, it may reflect many false positive results in the
prediction (i.e., low accuracy). Note that this comparison
does not directly test the performance. We measured the
average degree by the average number of links in the predicted PPIs. The average degree was close to 1 in the GCM
or GNM, remarkably lower than that in the PPM (21.4) or
GFM (5.4) (Table 1). According to the previous estimations, an average degree should be in a range of 2 to 10

links for each protein in a typical functioning cell [29,30].
Thus, it seems that only the GFM had a reasonable average
degree. Overall, the prediction of PPIs varied greatly
among these four genomic context methods.
Finally, we examined the PPIs that were similarly predicted by more than one method. A total of 1,155 PPIs
were predicted by both the GCM and GNM. They
accounted for 47% of the total predicted PPIs by the GCM
and 32% by the GNM (Table 1). For the PPIs predicted by
the GFM and PPM, 1,532 overlapped, which accounted
for 23% of the total PPIs by the GFM and 3% by the PPM,
respectively. The number of overlapped PPIs in the
remaining comparisons between two methods was
smaller (Table 1). Furthermore, there were only 298 PPIs
that were predicted by three or more methods. Of those
298 PPIs, 55 were predicted by all four methods. The comparison suggests that (1) GCM and GNM, which likely
share some common genetic context information, have
similar predictions of PPIs to some extent, and (2) there
was no consensus in the prediction of PPIs by these methods that utilize different features of genomic context. The
lack of consensus in prediction by different methods was
similarly reported in the previous study [17], implying
that they could complement each other.
Biological biases of the PPIs predicted by the four methods
We further compared the features of these four methods
by evaluating the performance of PPI prediction using
three well-defined datasets from the KEGG, EcoCyc, and
DIP databases. The KEGG dataset included pathway information, the EcoCyc included protein complexes, and the
DIP included the protein interactions with evidence. The
performance of each method was measured by an AC
value, which is an integrated value of the accuracy and
coverage (see Methods), because an assessment of the prediction needs to consider both accuracy and coverage
[12].

Figure 1 shows the AC values of the four methods using all
three datasets. The results can be summarized in the following three points. First, among the four methods, the
GFM had the highest AC value in the KEGG dataset; in

contrast, it had the lowest value in the EcoCyc and DIP
datasets. Further examination of the KEGG dataset, which
included 1,386 E. coli proteins, found a total of 117 pathways, of which 103 were in the category of metabolism.
This indicates that most proteins in the KEGG dataset are
involved in metabolism. The preference of the GFM in
metabolic proteins is consistent with Tsoka and
Ouzounis' previous report [31]; thus, it suggests that the
GFM performs well in the prediction of PPIs involved in
metabolisms. Second, the GCM had the highest AC value
in the EcoCyc dataset, which is consistent with the concept that genes in the same operon often encode proteins
involved in the protein complexes. Third, in contrast to
the GFM and GCM, the PPM had the highest AC value in
the DIP dataset but the lowest value in the KEGG dataset.
This suggests that the PPM may be suitable for prediction
of PPIs involved in protein interactions but not in the
pathways. Overall, no method outperformed the others
among these three datasets.
We combined all non-redundant protein pairs in the
KEGG, EcoCyc, and DIP datasets and calculated the AC
values for these methods. The AC values in the GCM and

InPrePPI method
The results in the above two sections indicate that each
method has its own superiority and no one outperforms
the others. Thus, we developed a new method, InPrePPI,
which weighs the genomic context information utilized in
these four methods and integrates it into a system that can
optimize the prediction. Specifically, the InPrePPI uses
the AC values of the four methods based on three positive
datasets (KEGG, EcoCyc, and DIP). A constant, k, is used
in the integration process (see Methods). This k can be
obtained by a heuristic approach. We tested k values from
0 to 1 (in an interval 0.1) and from 1 to 30 (in an interval

ˆ
1). For each k, we calculated the integrated score ( S ) for
each protein pair and then obtained a set of PPIs with the
highest scores (InPrePPI_high, see Methods). The optimal
k value is found when it results in the highest AC value in
the InPrePPI_high class. Figure 3 shows the AC values
using different k values and the InPrePPI_high class. The
AC values increased when k increased until k reached 15.
Thus, the optimal k was set to 15.
When k = 15, we assigned an integrated score to each of
the 54,911 pairs predicted by the four methods (Table 1).
These 54,911 pairs were separated into three classes based
on the prediction confidence: InPrePPI_high (1,194
pairs), InPrePPI_medium (5,403), and InPrePPI_low
(48,314). The data are available at InPrePPI web site [32]
or upon request.

Comparison of InPrePPI with other methods
We first compared the PPI prediction by InPrePPI with the
four individual methods. The AC value was higher in
InPrePPI than each of the four methods (Figure 2).

Next, we compared the performance of InPrePPI with the
two existing integrated methods: the joint observation
method (JOM) [21] and STRING [22]. In JOM, we calculated the accuracy and coverage for the PPIs that were predicted by at least one, two, three, or four methods (PPM,
GCM, GFM, and GNM), respectively, using three positive
datasets (KEGG, EcoCyc, and DIP). Confidence of the PPI
prediction is expected to increase when a pair is simultaneously predicted by multiple methods. This was confirmed, i.e., the accuracy increased from 8.79% by at least
one method (JOM≥1) to 78.18% by all the four methods
(JOM4) using the KEGG dataset (Table 2). However, the
coverage values decreased drastically. In the KEGG dataset, the coverage value decreased from 10.98% (JOM≥1) to
only 0.1% (JOM4). A similar pattern was observed in the
EcoCyc and DIP datasets (Table 2). In InPrePPI, when the
confidence level of the three classes (InPrePPI_high,
InPrePPI_medium, and InPrePPI_low) increased, the
accuracy also increased in all three positive datasets,
whereas the coverage decreased in the KEGG and DIP
datasets. However, the extent of the decrease was much
weaker than that in the JOM. Interestingly, the coverage of
InPrePPI increased greatly in the EcoCyc dataset. We
noted that the accuracy values in the InPrePPI_high class
were lower than those in JOM4 and JOM≥3, but higher
than those in JOM≥1 and JOM≥2. Because numbers of PPIs
in the JOM4 and JOM≥3 were small, its applications are
limited. Overall, InPrePPI outperforms JOM.
The PPI data predicted by the methods in STRING were
retrieved from the STRING database (see Methods) and
used in our comparison. These data were separated by the
STRING algorithm into three groups based on the confi-

the high confidence class in the EcoCyc dataset, all AC values in InPrePPI were higher than those in STRING (Figure
4). In fact, in the high confidence class of the EcoCyc dataset, InPrePPI had a slightly smaller AC value than STRING
(Figure 4). This comparison indicates that InPrePPI overall performed better than the prediction in STRING.

The data were separated into three groups with the high,
medium, and low confidence.

Protein annotations of Clusters of Orthologous Groups
(COG) have been used in the assessment of PPI prediction [33,34]. Here we used COG annotations for E. coli
K12 proteins to assess the prediction performance by
InPrePPI and STRING. There are 25 COG functional categories, including 22 well-characterized and 3 poorly characterized or unknown categories. A predicted pair is
counted as a true positive when its two proteins are within
the same COG well-characterized category and as a false
positive otherwise. The fractions of true positives were
0.408 (487 true positives over the 1,194 predicted pairs,
487/1,194) for InPrePPI_high, 0.356 (1,926/5,403) for
InPrePPI_medium, and 0.139 (6,722/48,314) for
InPrePPI_low, respectively, while the corresponding fractions in STRING were 0.280 (639/2,279) for
STRING_high, 0.091 (407/4,458) for STRING_medium,
and 0.065 (644/9,970) for STRING_low. Based on this
metric, InPrePPI had better prediction performance than
STRING (Figure 5).
Implementation
A web-based, user-friendly application (InPrePPI) for PPI
prediction was implemented by Java. This InPrePPI web
interface [32] allows the user to predict PPIs using one of
the four methods (PPM, GCM, GFM, and GNM) or
InPrePPI. If the user chooses InPrePPI, the application
first predicts PPIs using the four methods and then assigns

ˆ
an integrated score ( S ) to each pair of the predicted PPIs.
The user has the option to set or modify parameters such
as BLASTP E-value, target organism, or list of reference
organisms. This package can be downloaded at no cost

Because the system was designed to provide flexibility in
PPI prediction, the data are not pre-computed. This may
lead to a long computation time; therefore, we recommend that the user retrieve the results via email or run it
directly in a local computer.

Discussion
Many biological features have been explored in the prediction of protein-protein interactions and it has been
found that there is limited prediction power when utilizing only one genomic feature. Investigators are now moving toward integration [12,22,35]. A systematic
assessment of the existing methods is a prerequisite to an
effective integration. In this study, we focused on four
major methods (PPM, GCM, GFM, and GNM) that utilize
genomic context information. Each method characterizes
in its own way. We hypothesized that an efficient integration of these four major methods would improve prediction performance. We first performed extensive
comparisons of these four methods using three positive
datasets (KEGG, EcoCyc, and DIP). We found that these
four methods lacked consensus but complemented each
other to some extent. Based on these comparisons, we
developed an integrated method, InPrePPI, which optimally weighs the scores of protein pairs predicted by the
four methods. Our performance comparison indicates
that InPrePPI outperforms each individual method (Figure 2) and, in general, the other two integrated methods:
the JOM and STRING (Table 2, Figures 4 and 5).
However, InPrePPI did not outperform the JOM or
STRING in all tests. In the JOM, the accuracy values were
higher for the PPIs that were consistently predicted by at

least three methods. Such high values were reached by
dramatically decreasing the coverage. This makes JOM
impractical when multiple methods or supporting evidence is employed. InPrePPI does not have this limitation
because it uses an integration score, rather than an intersection of multiple data. Compared to STRING, InPrePPI
had consistently higher accuracy values and its coverage
values were higher or close, in most cases, except in the
high confidence class of the EcoCyc and DIP datasets. In
the latter two cases, the difference was not as remarkable
as it was in the comparison between the JOM and
InPrePPI. For example, the coverage value in InPrePPI was
33.19% in the high confidence class of EcoCyc; this is
comparable to the 42.33% in STRING but much higher
than the 2.65% in the JOM4 (Table 2). When we considered both the accuracy and coverage values, InPrePPI outperformed STRING in all tests except in the high
confidence class of EcoCyc (Figure 4). Furthermore, our
independent test using COG annotations indicates that
the fractions of true positives in InPrePPI were consistently higher than those in STRING in all three classes of
predicted PPIs (Figure 5).
The STRING database provides a comprehensive, high
quality collection of protein-protein associations for a
large number of organisms [22]. The association data
were compiled from high-throughput experimental data,
mining of other databases and literature, and the predicted PPIs by genomic context approaches. We demonstrated that InPrePPI has an overall better performance
than the prediction methods (phylogenetic co-occurrence, conserved neighborhood, and gene fusion methods) in STRING. However, InPrePPI is limited to the
evaluation and prediction of protein-protein pairs based
on the genomic context features and its web site provides
only prediction function rather than a comprehensive evidence collection. While the STRING database provides a
powerful system for proteomics research, the amount of
PPI data collected by the high-throughput experiments, or
from the existing literature, is still very limited at present
in most organisms in nature and is likely to be limited for
some time. Computational approaches are expected to
play an important role in uncovering the interactomes of
most genomes. Although one recent study failed to
improve the prediction by adding more features [35], the
InPrePPI method demonstrates that an integration, if
appropriate, can improve prediction power. Thus, our
integrated method based on the genomic context, which
is to be further optimized and enhanced, can be applied
to the prediction of PPIs in many other (prokaryotic)
genomes and also integrated into the comprehensive
database such as STRING.
InPrePPI integrates four genomic context based methods.
These four methods are currently the best computational

methods for prokaryotic genomes. This implies that
InPrePPI may be applied to the discovery of PPIs at least
in prokaryotic genomes. InPrePPI uses a constant, k, to
normalize the AC value and calculate the weight of each
method. This constant depends on the data used and the
methods integrated and can be obtained by a heuristic
approach. When true positives are available in a genome,
the optimal k value and weight of each method can be
directly obtained by the method in this study. To predict
PPIs in a genome without true positive data, which is very
challenging at present and always relies on the knowledge
in other well-studied organisms, we may use the optimal
k value and the weight available in E. coli or any other
genome that is related to the target genome and then
refine it after some of the predicted PPIs have been validated (i.e., true positives). InPrePPI may be extended to
eukaryotic genomes as well. Recent assessments of phylogenetic profiling in the E. coli and yeast confirmed the
similar strategy of reference organism selection in the construction of phylogenetic profiles [36-38] and indicate
that phyletic patterns of proteins in prokaryotes alone are
adequate to predict functional linkages between proteins
in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes [37]. Some studies
have reported that neighboring genes have similar expression patterns in higher eukaryotes, implying possible
interactions [39-41]. Qi et al. [13] found that gene coexpression is consistently the most important feature in
their comprehensive evaluation of PPI prediction in yeast
using an integrated framework, which supports the previous finding that the most obvious co-expression comes
from permanent complexes such as ribosome and proteasome [42,43]. Therefore, we may consider both the
genomic context information and the gene co-expression
data when we extend InPrePPI to eukaryotic genomes.
We used the gold standards of positives to evaluate the PPI
prediction methods. In previous studies, positive data was
selected from the standardized SWISS-PROT keywords
[3,30], the metabolic map in KEGG [22], the pathway
information in COG [33], or the protein complexes [12].
So far, there has been no complete biological database to
serve as a gold standard of positives. To avoid a biased
selection of positive data, we used three well-documented
datasets: (1) biological pathway information from KEGG,
(2) protein complexes from EcoCyc, and (3) protein-protein interactions identified by experiments from DIP. The
prediction performance of each method varied among
these three datasets (Figure 1), suggesting that the selection of positive control data should be made carefully and
should consider the types of interactions.

Conclusion
Computational prediction will play a major role in the
exploration of the interactomes of many genomes. However, a computational method that relies on one specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/414

genomic context feature has limited power in PPI prediction. We believe that an integration approach, which efficiently takes advantage of the different genomic features,
will outperform individual methods. In this study, we first
evaluated the prediction performance of the four major
genomic context based methods (PPM, GCM, GFM, and
GNM), then we developed a novel integrated method
(InPrePPI) based on the comparisons of these four methods in three datasets (KEGG, EcoCyc, and DIP). We demonstrated that InPrePPI, which is an evaluation rather
than prediction method, outperforms these four individual methods and, in general, the other two existing integrated methods (JOM and STRING).

Methods
Data sources
We downloaded genes and their annotations (e.g., name,
length, orientation, and protein sequence) in the 226
available complete genomes from the NCBI RefSeq database [44]. We chose E. coli K12 as the target organism and
the remaining 225 organisms as reference organisms. The
predicted operons in prokaryotes were downloaded from
SHOPS [45]. We downloaded the PPI data in STRING
from its web site [46] and then retrieved those PPIs predicted by the methods (phylogenetic co-occurrence, conserved neighborhood, and gene fusion) in STRING. We
retrieved the COG annotations for E. coli K12 proteins
from the NCBI E. coli K12 genome database [47].
Four genomic context based methods
We predicted PPIs using the genome datasets collected
above by four genomic context based methods: the phylogenetic profile method [14], the gene cluster method
[3,33], the gene fusion method [15], and the gene neighbor method [16]. We briefly describe these methods
below; the details of these methods are provided in their
original publications.

In the phylogenetic profile method, we used the refined
method described in Sun et al. [48] to obtain an optimal
reference organism set from the 225 available complete
genomes. The homology of a protein was identified by the
BLASTP program [49] with an E-value < 1 × 10-4. We chose
the E-value threshold of 1 × 10-4 because of its optimal
performance in our previous evaluation [48]. The phylogenetic profile for each E. coli protein was then constructed and assessed using the mutual information (MI)
value calculated by the method in Date and Marcotte [50].
The MI value of each protein pair reflects the confidence
level of the link between the two proteins. To identify the
candidate interactions, we calculated the threshold of
mutual information (TMI) values using the method in
Sun et al. [48]. A pair of proteins was considered to interact when its MI value was higher than the TMI value.

In the gene cluster method, the genes that belong to one
operon in E. coli and have homologues also belonging to
another operon in the reference genome(s) were considered to have functional links with each other. In the gene
fusion method, two or more proteins were identified to be
functionally linked when they were not encoded by neighboring genes in E. coli but were uniquely homologous to
a single protein in a reference organism [15]. In the gene
neighbor method, we identified those genes that were
located as neighbors (i.e., physically linked) among multiple genomes [51].
Identification of each protein pair is based on the
genomic context within a variety of genomes; some were
closely related while the others were not. Thus, we
assigned a score to each protein pair by the evolutionary
distance between the target organism and the reference
organism where the pair was present. We used the conserved 16S rRNA gene to estimate the evolutionary distance between E. coli and the other prokaryotic genomes.
We downloaded the 16S rRNA gene sequences in E. coli
and the other 211 prokaryotic genomes from NCBI [44].
We then aligned them using the ClustalW program [52].
After a manual check and adjustment of the alignments,
we estimated the genetic distance using the PHYLIP package [53]. Finally, we calculated the score for each protein
pair, which is the sum of the evolutionary distances
between E. coli and the other genomes where the protein
pair was present.
Gold standard positives and negatives
Assessment of the prediction performance in a computational method needs control datasets including gold
standard positives (i.e., proteins that do interact) and gold
standard negatives (i.e., proteins that do not interact). We
collected three datasets for gold standard positives from
the following established databases: (1) pathway information from the KEGG database [25], (2) protein complexes from the EcoCyc database [26], and (3) proteinprotein interactions from the DIP database (version:
Ecoli20060116) [27]. In the EcoCyc database, we downloaded the file 'protcplxs.col'; this file lists the genes that

encode the subunits of the complex. Among these databases, the proteins that were involved in the same complex or pathway were compiled and served as the
positives. We used the data in KEGG Orthology (KO) [54]
for gold standard negatives. We first removed all of the
proteins that were involved in more than one functional
category at the first level of KO. Then, we selected two proteins each time from the remaining proteins to form a
pair. Because the two proteins in each pair were from different functional categories at the first level, they served as
negative controls, assuming that two proteins from different broad functional categories did not interact [12].
Table 3 summarizes the processed positive and negative
functional association data used in this study. No overlap
was found between the negative and positive data.
Evaluation of PPI prediction
To assess the performance of PPI prediction, we calculated
the accuracy and coverage in each method and then
obtained an integrated value (AC value) by the following
equations:

Accuracy =

TP
,
TP + FP

(1)

Coverage =

TP
,
TP + FN

(2)

AC = ( Accuracy)2 + (Coverage)2 .

(3)

In the equations above, TP (true positive) is the number
of the predicted PPIs that were found in the positive control dataset, FP (false positive) is the number of the predicted PPIs that were not found in the positive control
dataset, and FN (false negative) is the number of PPIs in
the positive control dataset that failed to be predicted by
the method.

GNM. There are three steps to calculate an integrated score
for each protein pair. First, the AC value for each method
is normalized by
(− k / ACi , j )

AC ’i , j = e

AC ’ ∈ [0,1]

where k is a positive constant whose optimal value can be
empirically obtained by comparing the AC values using
the predicted PPIs with high confidence (InPrePPI_high,
see below and the Results), i is an index of positive datasets (i.e., KEGG, EcoCyc, and DIP), and j is an index of
methods (i.e., PPM, GCM, GFM, and GNM). Second, for
each method j, we calculate the weight (Wj) by

Wj = 1 − ∏ (1 − AC ’i , j ) Wj ∈ [0,1].

We categorized the predicted PPIs into three groups
according to their prediction confidence. We first
obtained two average scores to serve as the cutoff values:
Score_P, the average score among the predicted protein
pairs whose interactions are known to be true (i.e., in the
positive dataset), and Score_N, the average score among
the predicted protein pairs whose interactions are known
to be false (i.e., in the negative dataset). The predicted protein pairs whose scores were higher than Score_P were
considered to have high confidence and were categorized
into the InPrePPI_high class. The predicted protein pairs
whose scores were lower than Score_N were considered to
have low confidence and were categorized into the
InPrePPI_low class. The remaining protein pairs, whose
scores were between Score_N and Score_P, were categorized into the InPrePPI_medium class.
