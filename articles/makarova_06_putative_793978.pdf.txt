Abstract
Background: All archaeal and many bacterial genomes contain Clustered Regularly Interspaced
Short Palindrome Repeats (CRISPR) and variable arrays of the CRISPR-associated (cas) genes that
have been previously implicated in a novel form of DNA repair on the basis of comparative analysis
of their protein product sequences. However, the proximity of CRISPR and cas genes strongly
suggests that they have related functions which is hard to reconcile with the repair hypothesis.
Results: The protein sequences of the numerous cas gene products were classified into ~25
distinct protein families; several new functional and structural predictions are described.
Comparative-genomic analysis of CRISPR and cas genes leads to the hypothesis that the CRISPRCas system (CASS) is a mechanism of defense against invading phages and plasmids that functions
analogously to the eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi) systems. Specific functional analogies are
drawn between several components of CASS and proteins involved in eukaryotic RNAi, including
the double-stranded RNA-specific helicase-nuclease (dicer), the endonuclease cleaving target
mRNAs (slicer), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, none of the CASS
components is orthologous to its apparent eukaryotic functional counterpart. It is proposed that
unique inserts of CRISPR, some of which are homologous to fragments of bacteriophage and
plasmid genes, function as prokaryotic siRNAs (psiRNA), by base-pairing with the target mRNAs
and promoting their degradation or translation shutdown. Specific hypothetical schemes are
developed for the functioning of the predicted prokaryotic siRNA system and for the formation of
new CRISPR units with unique inserts encoding psiRNA conferring immunity to the respective
newly encountered phages or plasmids. The unique inserts in CRISPR show virtually no similarity
even between closely related bacterial strains which suggests their rapid turnover, on evolutionary
scale. Corollaries of this finding are that, even among closely related prokaryotes, the most
commonly encountered phages and plasmids are different and/or that the dominant phages and
plasmids turn over rapidly.

Conclusion: We proposed previously that Cas proteins comprise a novel DNA repair system.
The association of the cas genes with CRISPR and, especially, the presence, in CRISPR units, of
unique inserts homologous to phage and plasmid genes make us abandon this hypothesis. It appears
most likely that CASS is a prokaryotic system of defense against phages and plasmids that functions
via the RNAi mechanism. The functioning of this system seems to involve integration of fragments
of foreign genes into archaeal and bacterial chromosomes yielding heritable immunity to the
respective agents. However, it appears that this inheritance is extremely unstable on the
evolutionary scale such that the repertoires of unique psiRNAs are completely replaced even in
closely related prokaryotes, presumably, in response to rapidly changing repertoires of dominant
phages and plasmids.

Background
The discovery of the elaborate and versatile systems of
RNA silencing in eukaryotes is one of the pivotal advances
in biology of the last decade [1-6]. There are two major,
distinct forms of regulatory small RNAs involved in
eukaryotic gene silencing: small interfering (si) RNAs and
micro (mi) RNAs. siRNAs are produced from doublestranded RNAs of viruses and transposable elements,
which are processed by the dicer nuclease, one of the
essential components of the RNA-Induced Silencing
Complexes (RISCs) [7-9]. Dicer cleaves long dsRNA molecules into short, 21–22 nucleotide duplexes which are
subsequently unwound by the RISC to yield mature siRNAs. The RISC-siRNA complex then binds to the target
mRNA which is cleaved by the slicer nuclease, another
crucial component of RISC, to release the RISC-siRNA
which acts as a recyclable catalyst [9,10]. In addition to
silencing genes of exogenous agents, a distinct class of
longer, 28 nt siRNAs, the so-called repeated-associated
siRNAs (rasiRNAs), silence expression of chromosomal
copies of transposons and transposon-like repeats [1113].
Unlike the siRNAs, 21–25 nt-long miRNAs are encoded in
eukaryotic genomes and are either perfectly (in plants) or
imperfectly (in animals) complementary to sequences in
the 3'-untranslated regions of specific endogenous
mRNAs [6,13]. Base-pairing of miRNAs with the target
mRNAs, which is mediated by a distinct form of RISC,
results either in RNA cleavage or in down-regulation of
translation [8]. Evidence is rapidly accumulating that
numerous, probably, thousands of miRNAs in animals
and plants are major players in development regulation
and chromatin remodeling [6].
Prokaryotes have apparent functional counterparts to the
miRNA system, i.e., regulation of bacterial gene expression by small antisense RNAs. The best characterized of

these pathways employ the RNA-binding protein Hfq for
small RNA presentation and RNAse E for target degradation [14-17]. Escherichia coli has ~60 microRNA genes, and
comparable numbers of expressed, small antisense RNAs
have been detected in the archaea Archaeoglobus fulgidus
[18] and Sulfolobus solfataricus [19], suggesting an important role of this regulatory mechanism in prokaryotic
physiology. In addition, small antisense RNAs have been
shown to regulate plasmid replication and killing of plasmid-free bacterial cells by silencing specific plasmid genes
[20-22]. In contrast, counterparts to the eukaryotic siRNA
mechanism so far have not been described in prokaryotes.
Here, we apply comparative genomics and in-depth computational analysis of protein and RNA sequences and
structures to predict a distinct prokaryotic siRNA-like system and the associated enzymatic apparatus.
In a previous comparative-genomic study, which has been
originally conceived as a test case for methods for conserved gene neighborhood analysis we have developed,
we characterized an extensive set of genes that included
several proteins related to DNA or RNA metabolism and
was, mostly, specific to thermophiles [23]. These genes
comprise a complex array of overlapping neighborhoods
that are partially conserved but highly diversified, in terms
of both gene composition and gene order, and are represented in all archaeal and many bacterial genomes
[23,24]. At the time of its discovery, we hypothesized that
these genes encoded an uncharacterized, versatile repair
system, largely, associated with the thermophilic lifestyle
[23].
Independently and almost simultaneously, Jansen and
coworkers found [25] that at least several genes from this
gene neighborhood were tightly associated with the socalled Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome
Repeats (CRISPR); the acronym cas (for CRISPR-associated) genes was thus coined. The CRISPR are a distinct

class of repetitive elements that are present in numerous
prokaryotic genomes. A CRISPR element consists of a
direct repeat of ~28–40 base pairs (bp), with the copies
separated by a unique sequence of ~25–40 bp. Typically,
CRISPR form tandem arrays containing from 4 to >100
elements. Most of the genomes contain a single array of
CRISPR in which the sequences of the repeats are (nearly)
identical; some, however, possess multiple CRISPR cassettes that may have substantially different sequences
[24,25]. The repeats in CRISPR from different genomes
show only limited similarity, but often retain distinct,
conserved motifs shared even by distant species including
archaea and bacteria [18,26]. There seems to be a strict
link between CRISPR and cas genes, suggestive of a
(nearly) mutualistic relationship: the great majority of the
genomes that contain CRISPR also have at least a minimal
set of cas genes, and vice versa.
Recently, Mojica and coworkers reported that the unique
inserts in some of the CRISPR are homologous to fragments of bacteriophage and plasmid genes [27]. This led
to the hypothesis that the CRISPR might have a function
in the defense of prokaryotes against invading foreign replicons and that there could be functional analogies
between this putative defense system and eukaryotic RNA
interference. Similar findings have been independently
reported by two other groups [28,29].
The recent rapid growth of the number and diversity of
sequenced prokaryotic genomes has led to a dramatic
increase in the complexity of the identified cas gene arrays
[24]. Here we describe the results of an exhaustive
sequence analysis of the Cas protein sequences which
yielded a classification of these proteins, several new functional predictions, and a reconstruction of evolutionary
relationship between these genes. We propose that the cas
genes encode the protein machinery of a prokaryotic
siRNA-like system that performs, primarily, but perhaps,
not exclusively, defense functions and is generally similar,
in some respects, to eukaryotic siRNA, and in other
respects, to the vertebrate immune system. The predicted
enzymatic machinery of this system seems to be functionally analogous, but not homologous, to the protein apparatus involved in the eukaryotic RNA-mediated gene
silencing. Finally, we outline possible molecular mechanisms of the predicted prokaryotic siRNA system. The
hypothesis on the involvement of Cas proteins in an
RNAi-type mechanism supplants the previous proposal
that these proteins might comprise a novel DNA repair
system [23] which is hardly compatible with the tight
association of these proteins with CRISPR and the existence of unique CRISPR inserts homologous to phage and
plasmid sequences.

Results and discussion
Identification, classification and evolutionary analysis of
cas genes
In the original study of the cas gene neighborhoods,
which was performed with ~40 genomes, we identified
~20 protein families that were tightly or more loosely
associated with the system we now call CASS. A recent
update by Haft and coworkers with >200 genomes yielded
a diverse "guild" of ~45 Cas protein families [24]. Many of
the Cas proteins show very low sequence conservation
which makes identification of homologous relationship
between them a non-trivial task. We employed an iterative
approach to the exhaustive analysis of the Cas protein
sequences. The protein sequences of each Cas family were
compared to the protein sequences from all available
prokaryotic genomes using PSI-BLAST [30,31], the proteins encoded in the neighborhoods of all identified candidates were used as queries for further searches, and the
process was iterated until convergence. The sequences of
Cas proteins were, in addition, carefully compared to each
other, in an attempt to identify possible traces of common
origin of some of these genes that have so far eluded
detection [for a complete list of Gene Identification (GI)
numbers of the detected Cas proteins, see Additional file
1].
COG1518, a universal marker of CASS
In agreement with the previous observations [23], we
found that Cas1 (COG1518 in the Clusters of Orthologous Group of proteins classification system [32]) is the
best marker of the CRISPR-associated systems (CASS).
This gene encodes a highly conserved protein and that is
represented in all cas neighborhoods, with the single
exception of Pyrococcus abyssii. A PSI-BLAST search for
COG1518 members in the completely sequenced
prokaryotic genomes revealed the presence of at least one
representative of this COG in 77 of the 177 analyzed
genomes.

Given that COG1518 is represented in all versions of
CASS, the distribution of this gene among prokaryotic lineages serves as a proxy for the distribution of CASS itself
(P. abyssii was included as having CASS, the absence of
COG1518 notwithstanding); this distribution is, obviously, non-uniform (Fig. 1). All sequenced archaeal
genomes, including, notably, the tiny genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans, encode this protein. In contrast, in each
of the bacterial lineages with a representative set of
sequenced genomes, half or more species do not have
COG1518. We came across several cases of differences in
the presence of CASS among closely related bacterial species and even between strains of the same species. Thus,
Corynebacterium diphtheriae has a COG1518 gene but
Corynebacterium efficiens does not; similarly, CASS was
detected in Mycobacterium tuberculosis but not in Mycobac-

terium bovis or Mycobacterium leprae; significant differences
in the composition of CASS were noticed even between
strains of several bacterial species, e.g., Thermus thermophilus [33].
Phylogenetic analysis of COG1518 combined with gene
neighborhood comparisons yields a clear classification of
CASS based on gene composition and (predicted) operon
organization (Fig. 2a) which is, generally, in agreement
with the recent study of Haft et al [24]. Altogether, we
delineated 7 distinct versions of CASS which show substantial differences in gene composition and predicted
operon organization. Only four CASS variants (CASS1-4)
have a more or less stable operon organization. While a
distinct operon organization motif is recognizable in the
other CASS variants as well (Fig. 2a), these versions have
undergone numerous, complex rearrangements in different prokaryotic genomes including gene duplications,
fusion with other CRISPR-related operons, insertion of
additional genes, and others. Thus, in line with the observation that CASS is often eliminated from genomes during evolution, this plasticity of CASS operon organization
suggests that the CRISPR-associated genomic regions are
"hot spots" of recombination and ensuing genome rearrangement. Taken together, all these observations demonstrate the extraordinary evolutionary mobility of CASS.
The recent work of Haft et al has identified a "guild" of
over 45 protein families comprising the CASS [24]. Here
we refine this classification by unifying many of the families into superfamilies and also expand the list of CASS-

linked genes to include those that are found in cas operons less commonly and comprise the "cloud" surrounding the core CASS components. Only COG1518 and
COG1343 (see below) are invariably present in all versions of CASS (with the exception of P. abyssii and several
bacterial species that carry disrupted COG1518 gene). A
few genomes that have a cassette of CRISPR-associated
genes without COG1518 also possess another CRISPRassociated operon in a different genomic location that
does include this gene. Altogether, we end up with ~25
gene families that are tightly associated with CASS (Table
1)
COG1343 and its relatives – distant homologs of VapD
COG1343 (cas2) is another gene that is common in CASS.
Typically, this gene is located immediately downstream of
the COG1518 gene (Fig. 2a). Exhaustive PSI-BLAST search
starting from COG1343 proteins identified proteins of
COG3512 as homologs of COG1343 such that these
COGs could be unified in a single superfamily. The members of this superfamily are small (80–120 amino acids)
proteins with distinct structural motifs, in particular, an
N-terminal β-strand followed by a polar amino acid, most
often, aspartate or asparagine (see Additional file 2). In
CASS2, which is typified by the cas operon of E. coli, there
is an uncharacterized gene coding for a small protein
immediately downstream of the COG1518 gene. Analysis
of the multiple alignment of the homologs of this protein
revealed motifs highly similar to those in COG1343, suggesting that these proteins actually are diverged COG1343
homologs. Only CASS3 does not seem to contain a gene
for a small protein that potentially could be a COG1343
homolog. However, we found that, in CASS3, the next
gene after COG1518, which codes for the CASS helicase
(cas3 or COG1203) is unusually long and contains a
small domain preceding the HD-hydrolase N-terminal
domain present in many COG1203 proteins. We analyzed
this domain separately and found that its size and motifs
were consistent with a homologous relationship with
COG1343 (see Additional file 2). Thus, it appears that,
either as a stand-alone protein or as part of a multidomain
protein, the COG1343 domain is present in all CASS
(except for a few highly degraded and, probably, nonfunctional ones) and, accordingly, could be essential for
the CASS functions. Furthermore, searches started with
the sequences of many proteins of COG3512 showed
some sequence similarity to vapD (COG3309 family), a
family of uncharacterized proteins that are functionally
linked to the VapBC operon [34]. The VapBC operon
encodes a variant of the bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA)
module which includes an HTH-containing transcription
regulator and a PIN-domain nuclease. The PIN domain
has been shown to possess ribonuclease activity that in
eukaryotes is involved in pre-rRNA processing, nonsensemediated decay (NMD) of aberrant mRNAs, and RNAi

[35-37]. It has been proposed that there is an evolutionary
connection between eukaryotic NMD and bacterial TA
systems, and that the functioning of the TA module might
involve mRNA degradation as well [38].Together, these
observations seem to establish links between CASS and
the TA system and, through the latter, between CASS and
eukaryotic NMD and RNAi, but do not directly shed light
on the function of the COG1343 domain. However, the
COG1343 proteins and VapD show some generic similarity to the PIN domain in terms of size and the signature
motifs (COG1343 proteins contain several partially con-

served aspartates; see Additional file 2) which makes it
tempting to speculate that these proteins represent yet
another family of nucleases.
COG1857 – another putative enzyme found in most CASS versions
Another conserved CASS family that resists straightforward functional prediction is COG1857. This gene is
present in most CASS, with the exception of the "minimal" variants, CASS 4, 6, and 7. The COG1857 proteins
consist of ~350 aa and typically have an N-terminal βstrand followed by a loop containing a conserved asparag-

ine (see Additional file 3). Although no other motifs containing potential catalytic residues seem to be conserved
throughout COG1857, perhaps, due to the extensive
divergence between the subfamilies of this family, the
observed conservation pattern suggests that this protein is
an enzyme, perhaps, yet another nuclease. COG1857 proteins are typically encoded immediately upstream of
another widespread CASS gene, COG1688 (named Cas5
by Haft et al. [24]). We have previously identified
COG1688 as a member of the Repair-Associated Mysterious Protein (RAMP) superfamily [23] that has been
renamed to Repeat-Associated Mysterious Protein (preserving the acronym) by Haft and coworkers [24]. In
CASS3, COG1688 is replaced by the y1726 family which
we found to include another set of RAMPs distantly
related to COG1688 (Figs. 2a and 3A).
The Repeat-Associated Mysterious Proteins (RAMPs)
The RAMPs are the most diverse class of CASS genes. In
addition to the previously identified 5 distinct families of
RAMPs, we detected several additional ones, namely,
BH0337-like, y1726-like, YgcH-like, y1727-like, and
MJ0978-like families, as well as numerous diverged members of the previously described families (Fig. 3A). Despite
the dramatic sequence divergence, all these protein contain the RAMP signature, the G-rich loop at the C-terminus (Fig. 3A). One family of RAMPs, COG1853/
COG5551, is often encoded outside the CASS operons or
on the periphery of these. Moreover, analysis of the gene
context of this gene in Aquifex aeolicus led us to the identification of yet another member of RAMP superfamily,
COG1851. This protein family does not appear to be
linked to CASS at all.

With the identification of these new families of RAMPs, it
now becomes apparent that all CASS versions, with the
apparent exception of the minimal CASS4, include at least
one RAMP. The crystal structure of one of the RAMPs from
the newly detected YgcH-like family has been solved as
part of one of the structural-genomics projects (PDB:
1wj9). The structure of this protein from Thermus thermophilus reveals that the RAMP module is a duplication of
a ferredoxin-like fold domain. Each domain has a twolayer α+β architecture and is composed of four β-strands
and two α-helices topologically arranged as a repeat of
two βαβ units (Fig 3B, A1-A86, β1 through β4; and A87A211, β5 through β8 for the first and the second domains,
respectively). The N-terminal ferredoxin-like domain contains two additional α-helices (α1' and α1", Fig 3A)
inserted before and after the first α-helix. The C-terminal
domain has two disordered regions and houses the conserved Gly-rich loop situated between the last α-helix and
β-strand (Fig. 3A). Various structure similarity search programs detect ferredoxin fold proteins as the first hits to
RAMP domains. In particular, for the N-terminal RAMP

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/7

domain, DALI [39], first match is the anticodon-binding
domain of Phe-tRNA synthetase (PDB Entry 1eiy, chain B)
with Z-score 4.8 and RMSD (squared Root of Mean Square
Deviations) 2.9Å over 67 aligned residues. The VAST program [40] finds ribosomal protein S6 (PDB Entry 1fjg
chain F) as the top hit for the C-terminal RMAP domain
with P-value 0.039, RMSD 2.6 Å over 64 residues.
Thus, at least six gene (super)families seem to comprise
the stable core of the CASS: COG1518 (cas1), COG1343
(cas2), COG1203 – a helicase often fused to a HD-family
hydrolase (cas3) plus free-standing versions of the HDhydrolase (COG2254), COG1468 (cas4) – a RecB family
nuclease usually containing a C-terminal Zn cluster,
COG1857, and RAMPs. This exact set of genes is seen only
in a few genomes; most versions of CASS have substantial
variations around this core – loss of some core genes in
the minimal versions and addition of other genes and
whole gene cassettes in others (Fig. 2a,b).
The second major module of CASS – the pol-cassette
The most notable non-core CASS module which, in a
sense, constitutes a second, even if non-ubiquitous, central part of CASS may be called the "pol-cassette" after the
predicted palm-domain RNA or DNA polymerase of
COG1353. The pol-cassette also includes several distinct
RAMPs and a few uncharacterized genes. The pol-cassette
is strictly linked only to CASS5 and CASS7 and also, in
some instances, is found in CASS1,2,4,6 (Fig. 2c),
although, in some genomes, the pol-cassette is not adjacent to the CASS-core gene array. The phylogenetic tree for
the predicted polymerase (COG1353), which consisted of
two major branches corresponding to two distinct operon
organizations (Fig. 2c), showed essentially no topological
congruence with the COG1518 tree (for those CASS that
have both components; compare the two trees in Fig.
2a,c). Thus, it appears that the pol-cassette comprises a
distinct evolutionary unit that is often transferred horizontally independently of the CASS-core. Notably, the
pol-cassette is strongly, although not strictly, linked to
thermophily – the great majority of the species containing
this module, typically associated with CASS5 and CASS7,
are thermophiles. Additionally, several species possess a
third module containing a diverged form of COG1353
with an apparently intact HD hydrolase domain but an
inactivated polymerase (PALM) domain (Fig 2c).
Ancillary CASS components
The CASS-core and the pol-cassette together comprise the
extended central componentry of CASS that consists of six
COGs plus the RAMP superfamily (Table 1). In addition,
~20 other families were consistently found in CASS, even
if in a minority of the CASS-containing species (Table 1).
It has to be taken into account that most of the CASS proteins have highly diverged sequences, and further unifica-

tion as well as expansion and the ensuing rise in status of
some of the families remains a possibility. For example,
COG1517 is such a growing family. Typically, the
COG1517 genes are located on the periphery of pol-cassettes and, in many cases, contain fused helix-turn-helix
(HTH) domains. The core domain of COG1517 is ~150
aa; several proteins, e.g. TM1812, contain a duplication of
this domain, and several fusions, in addition to the one
with HTH, were detected. The sequences of COG1517
proteins tend to be highly diverged, and some of these
were detected in genomes with no CASS, indicating that
the association of this gene with CASS is not as tight as it
is for the extended core of CASS. For one such protein
from Vibrio cholerae, the 3D structure has been solved,
again, in one of the structural genomics projects (PDB:
1xmx). The structure is composed of three domains. The
N-terminal domain (A-1-A137, β1 through β7, Fig. 4) is a
modified Rossmann-like fold, with the next to the last βstrand (β6) being antiparallel to the rest of the strands.
The middle domain (A161-A249, α6 through α10) is a
winged helix-turn-helix (HTH) with an additional α-helix
on each terminus (α6 and α10, respectively). The C-terminal domain (composite of A250-A383 and A138-A156,
α11 through α14 plus α5 and β8) belongs to the restriction endonuclease superfamily. In the 1xmx structure, the
endonuclease domain is positioned between the HTH and
the Rossmann-like domain (Fig. 4). The lowest VAST Pvalues of the matches between each of the 1xmx domains
and the respective domains with known folds are highly
statistically significant (<10-5) which is strongly suggestive
of homologous relationships.
The functions of several other CASS gene families remain
obscure. For instance, CASS1, 5, 7 contain genes upstream
of COG1857 that encode large (500–600 amino acids),
homologous proteins; the best conserved family in this set
of proteins is represented by BH0338 and its orthologs.
Some members of the BH0338 family contain a Zn-ribbon in the middle of the sequence but otherwise have no
recognizable domains or motifs. Among several conserved motifs of these proteins, are two conserved aspartates and a distal conserved glycine, a combination that
resembles the motifs seen in the PALM polymerase
domain (not shown). Although we were unable to obtain
additional evidence of the potential connection of this
family with polymerases, it is tempting to speculate that
these proteins might contain an extremely diverged version of the PALM domain. Similar, albeit less pronounced, motifs are detectable in the MTH1090 family
proteins which are present in CASS5 and CASS7. This similarity and the fact that the respective genes occupy the
same position in the corresponding operons suggest that
the BH0338-family and the MTH1090-family proteins are
highly diverged homologs. CASS2 also includes a large
protein (YgcL-family), some of which contain Zn-clusters;

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/7

however, the conserved motifs of these proteins and their
position in the respective operons are different from those
of the MTH1090 and BH0338 families. CASS4 contains
another huge protein (COG3513, ~1150–1400 aa) with
two recognizable domains, a McrA/HNH nuclease and a
RuvC-like nuclease (RNAseH fold). These observations
emphasize the striking diversity of still poorly characterized CASS components, particularly, the plethora of predicted nucleases of various classes and potential novel
ones.
Hypothesis: CASS is a prokaryotic defense system that
functions on the RNAi principle
Based on the properties of CRISPR and Cas proteins, we
speculate that this system is a functional analog of the
eukaryotic siRNA systems and propose possible mechanisms of the putative prokaryotic small RNA interference.
The crucial observation reported independently by Mojica
et al [27], Pourcel et al [29], and Bolotin et al [28] is that
a certain fraction (~10% according to [27]) of the unique
inserts in CRISPR units are homologous to fragments of
viral (bacteriophage) or plasmid genomes. Only a miniscule fraction of the existing phage and plasmid sequences
is currently available, whereas the total diversity of
prokaryotic mobile elements is humungous and apparently exceeds the diversity of prokaryotes at least by an
order of magnitude [41,42]. Thus, it is not far fetched to
propose that most, if not all, CRISPR inserts are derived
from mobile replicons [29].

Should that be the case, it seems more or less obvious that
CASS is a prokaryotic defense system against foreign replicons that functions on the antisense RNA principle.
More specifically, it seems likely that the inserts are transcribed and silence the cognate phage or plasmid genes
via the formation of a duplex between the prokaryotic
small interfering (psiRNA) and the target mRNA followed
by cleavage of the duplex or translation repression.
Indeed, Mojica et al [27] mention the analogy between
the CRISPR and eukaryotic RNA interference systems but
propose no specific mechanisms for the action of the
putative defense systems and, crucially, do not explore the
connection between the putative psiRNA and the predicted activities of Cas proteins. Important supporting evidence has been independently obtained through the
analysis of the small non-messenger RNA expression in
the euryarchaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus which showed
that CRISPR are transcribed (from a leader-promoter
sequence), apparently, in the form of a multiunit precursor that is subsequently cleaved into CRISPR monomers
and oligomers [18]; very similar observations have been
subsequently reported for the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus [19]. Furthermore, as noticed by Pourcel and
coworkers [29], one of the unique CRISPR inserts in the
MIGAS strain of the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes is

homologous to a prophage present in other strains of the
same bacterium that, conversely, do not carry the CRISPR.
This is compatible with the possibility that the insert
makes the bacterium immune to the given phage.
Here, we pursue these lines in an attempt to present a
coherent, even if speculative, description of the putative
prokaryotic siRNA system. Circumstantial but crucial evidence in support of the psiRNA hypothesis comes from
analogies between the predicted functions of CASS proteins and the protein components of eukaryotic RNA
interference systems, in particular, the RISCs [7-9] (Table
2). The core parts of RISCs are a helicase fused with two
RNAse III domains, dicer, and the exonuclease of the argonaute family, slicer [9,10,43]. Both dicer and slicer are
represented by variable numbers of paralogs in eukaryotes, and different paralogs are included into RISCs with
distinct functions [9,10]. Various RISCs also contain additional RNA-binding proteins and nucleases [9,44]. Putative functional analogs of all these proteins can be gleaned
among the CASS proteins. The dicer analog is immediately apparent: the COG1203 helicase that is either fused
or encoded next to a predicted nuclease of the HD family
(Fig. 2a); we tentatively designate this protein p-dicer
(prokaryotic dicer). Identification of the slicer counterpart
(p-slicer) is less straightforward because of the diversity of
predicted nucleases within the CASS. One candidate is the
predicted RecB-family nuclease (COG1468). Alternatively
or additionally, the slicer function could be performed by
a novel, still unidentified nuclease, such as COG1857.
Indeed, the possibility cannot be dismissed that different
or even the same version of CASS employ multiple p-slicers, in a parallel with the multiple, paralogous eukaryotic
slicers of the argonaute family. We further propose that
RAMP proteins, by far the most diverse components of the
CASS, play a major role in the prokaryotic siRNA mechanism as RNA-binding proteins that display a degree of
specificity to the psiRNAs, most likely, by specifically
binding psiRNAs of different sizes. The RAMPs, diverse
representatives of the same protein superfamily, can be
functional analogs of the more structurally diverse RNAbinding proteins of eukaryotic RISCs (Table 2). The presence of two ferredoxin-fold domains in RAMPs (Fig. 3B)
is compatible with this proposal given that this fold is
seen in a broad variety of RNA-binding proteins, such as
the ribosomal proteins S6 and S10, several spliceosomal
subunits, and others. Although the structural similarities
between the two domains of RAMP and ferredoxin-like
domains are not particularly strong, it might be significant
that the top structural neighbors for each of the RAMP
domains are different RNA-binding domains (see above).
Figure 5a presents our current hypothesis on the basic
mechanism of the functioning of the prokaryotic RNAi
system. We speculate that CRISPR regions are transcribed

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/7

from a promoter located in the AT-rich CRISPR leader.
Transcription might be regulated with the participation of
one of the Cas proteins and, conceivably, would be stimulated by stress, such as phage infection, although the
results of expression analysis in A. fulgidus suggest some
level of constitutive transcription [18]. The work of Tang
and coworkers further indicates that the primary transcript is likely to encompass the entire CRISPR repeat
region. This transcript would be cleaved into 70–100 nt
pre-psiRNA, conceivably, by the putative p-dicer, the
COG1203 protein (Fig. 5a). We further postulate that pdicer catalyzes the second, perhaps, slower (judging by the
results of Tang et al) processing step that releases mature
psiRNA species (Fig. 5a). The psiRNA molecules would
bind RAMPs in a size-specific manner and anneal to the
target mRNA. The resulting complex would recruit pslicer, forming the minimal form of the prokaryotic analog of RISC (pRISC) that would cleave the mRNA and
could be recycled to attack the next target molecule, thus,
silencing the respective gene (Fig. 5a).
Figure 5b shows a version of this pathway that involves
the activity of the CASS polymerase, by analogy with the
eukaryotic RdRp, which participates in some RNAi pathways in most eukaryotes, but apparently has been lost in
arthropods and chordates [45-47]. The initial steps in this
scheme are the same as in the basic one (Fig. 5a) – transcription of the CRISPR, processing of the psiRNA precursor, and annealing of psiRNA to the target mRNA
mediated by the pRISC – but, at the next step, psiRNA is
postulated to serve as the primer for elongation by the
CASS polymerase, yielding an extended double-stranded
form of the target (Fig. 5b). This form would be cleaved by
p-dicer analogously to the cleavage of viral and transposon dsRNAs by the eukaryotic dicers. The p-dicer might
function as a complex with the respective RAMP to form a
distinct version of pRISC. This could be the endpoint of
the pathway, or else, the dsRNA degradation products
could be utilized as new psiRNAs, resulting in amplification of the silencing effect (Fig. 5b). The CASS polymerase
is most common in thermophiles, and it is tempting to
speculate that the prevalence of this form of the psiRNA
pathway has to do with the instability of the psiRNA-target duplex under the high ambient temperatures of these
organisms.
The most complex and uncertain aspect of the putative
prokaryotic RNAi system discussed here is the formation
of new CRISPR units containing unique psiRNA genes
specific for new targets encountered by the organism (Fig.
5c). The path to the creation of new psiRNAs would begin
just like the response pathway, i.e., with transcription of
the CRISPR locus and the first processing step yielding the
70–100 nt psiRNA precursors (compare Fig. 5c with Fig.
5a). At the next step, however, there must be a mechanism

to replace the unique insert within the pre-psiRNA with a
new fragment of foreign (e.g., phage) RNA. The nature of
this mechanism remains unclear. In principle, two possibilities can be envisaged: i) reverse transcription with copy
choice whereby a reverse transcriptase, most likely, the
predicted CASS polymerase (COG1353) switches from
using the pre-psiRNA as a template to using a phage
mRNA, and then back, and ii) direct, non-homologous
RNA recombination between a pre-psiRNA and a foreign
mRNA, followed by reverse transcription of the resulting
recombinant RNA (Fig. 5c). Both mechanisms are nontrivial in their molecular choreography and are unlikely to
occur with high efficiency. Nevertheless, there are precedents for both in the molecular biology of retroviruses
and other RNA viruses. In particular, reverse transcriptase
switches templates in each cycle of retrovirus first-strand
cDNA synthesis although, in this case, copy-choice is facilitated by the spatial juxtaposition of the two templates
within the virus particle; a similar mechanism is responsible for recombination in retroviruses [48]. In addition,
and probably, more relevantly to the psiRNA case, reverse
transcription with copy-choice is thought to be involved
in the incorporation of copies of cellular genes, such as
oncogenes, into retroviral genomes [49,50]. The alternative, namely, direct recombination between RNA molecules might seem far fetched, but such a process has been
demonstrated, by several groups independently, to occur
in RNA viruses, apparently, via a protein-independent
mechanism [51,52]. During the formation of new psiRNA
species, these low-frequency processes might be facilitated
by the high abundance of the phage mRNAs involved.
Indeed, it has been shown that the unique inserts in
CRISPR most often correspond to fragments of essential,
highly conserved phage genes that are typically expressed
at a high level in infected bacteria[27]. Once the dsDNA
molecule consisting of a CRISPR unit with the new,
unique insert is produced, by one of the mechanisms outlined here or, perhaps, via a different pathway, it must
insert into the CRISPR array via homologous recombination (Fig. 5c). We suspect that this process is mediated by
the COG1518 protein, the universal marker of CASS containing conserved motifs resembling those of different
nucleases [23]. It seems likely that this protein functions
as the CRISPR integrase/recombinase, perhaps, in cooperation with the COG1343 protein, another universal component of CASS.
Additional lines of evidence relevant for the predicted
RNAi function of CASS
Genes loosely associated with CASS
In addition to the bona fide (even if not ubiquitous) CASS
components, a variety of genes were found in association
with CRISPR and CASS in only one or a few closely related
genomes. Thus, functional association of these genes with
CASS appears uncertain. However, examination of the list

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/7

of such genes clearly indicates that they are not a random
set (Table 3). Similarly to the common CASS components, there are several nucleases on this list. More notable
is the presence of the reverse transcriptase (RT) which, on
at least two independent occasions, has been fused to the
COG1518 gene (Fig. 2a and Table 3). This fusion suggests
the intriguing possibility that, in the respective variants of
CASS, the RT (probably derived from retron-type elements) takes over the proposed function of the CASS
polymerase (Fig. 5c); this appears to provide indirect but
substantial support for the reverse-transcription-mediated
mechanism of CASS function. Perhaps, the most remarkable observation is the presence of the archaeal homolog
of the eukaryotic argonaute protein (the slicer) in one of
the CASS operons of the archaeon Methanopyrus kandleri
(Table 3). This suggests the possibility of a functional
association of this protein with CASS, at least in some
archaea, and provides the only putative (even if weak –
until other archaeal genomes with such a gene arrangement are found) link between CASS and the eukaryotic
RISCs at the level of homologous proteins.
A connection between CRISPR and RAMPs
We searched for CRISPR in the 89 complete prokaryotic
genomes containing cas genes and found remarkable
diversity, in both the number of repeat units and the
spacer size, even among closely related species and strains,
which is in agreement with previous observations [25,2729]. Given our hypothesis that RAMPs are size-specific
psiRNA-binding proteins, we examined possible connections between the number of RAMP genes, the number of
CRISPR units (which is the same as the number of unique
inserts) and the length heterogeneity of the unique inserts
in prokaryotic genomes. The number of RAMPs showed
strong positive correlations both with the number of
CRISPR units (Fig. 6a) and with the variance of the insert
lengths (Fig. 6b) which seems to be compatible with our
hypothesis on the psiRNA-binding function of RAMPs.
Significant correlations were observed also between the
number of CRISPR and the variance of the insert length,
and between each of these variables and the number of
COG1518 proteins, COG1517 proteins or all Cas proteins minus the RAMPs. However, the correlations seen
for the RAMPs and the CRISPR inserts were the strongest,
suggesting that these were the biologically most relevant
links (Table 4). It should be emphasized that, given the
extreme sequence divergence of the RAMPs, it is most
likely that the correlation between the number of encoded
RAMPs and the number of CRISPR units present in a
genome is due to the RAMPs discriminating between
inserts (by size, under our hypothesis) rather than recognition of the repeats themselves.

Putative psiRNAs: relationships with phage and plasmid
genes and secondary structure
We sought to reassess the relationship between the unique
CRISPR inserts and bacteriophage and plasmid genes with
the currently available, increased collection of prokaryotic
and phage genomes. Using somewhat more stringent criteria than those adopted by Mojica et al. [27], we found
that only a small fraction the unique CRISPR inserts
showed significant similarity to any sequences in the current databases. Altogether, we identified 83 inserts with
apparent homologs, or ~2% of all available CRISPR
sequences. Importantly, the great majority of these inserts
were indeed homologous to fragments of phage or plasmid genes rather than to sequences from bacterial or
archaeal chromosomes (Table 5). Rather unexpectedly, it
turned out that CRISPR inserts homologous to phage and
plasmid genes came in both the sense and the antisense
orientations (Table 5). Although determination of the
direction of transcription for CRISPR cassettes is ambiguous because the leader sequence thought to include the
CRISPR promoter is hard to identify, it is certain that
some of the CRISPR cassettes contain inserts of both orientations (Table 5). This finding presents a complication
to the schemes of CRISPR functioning presented in Fig. 5
because sense fragments of genes, obviously cannot
silence the respective targets directly. There seem to be
three possible solutions to this problem, all based on the
assumption that the recombination process in the scheme
shown in Fig. 5c is random with respect to direction. The
first possibility is that the sense inserts are non-functional
by-products of indiscriminate recombination. Alternatively, it is conceivable that both sense and antisense

inserts are converted to duplexes, probably, by the CASS
polymerase, after which the sense strand is destroyed
whereas the antisense strand becomes part of the pRISC.
A very similar mechanism involving the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase has been described for one of the endogenous siRNA pathways in plants [53]. The third, more
exotic possibility is that psiRNA actually function not by
silencing mRNAs but by promoting degradation of the
target DNA, in which case both sense and antisense psiRNAs could be active. This option is further discussed in the
Conclusions section.
Importantly, the CRISPR insert sequences from even
closely related bacterial strains are unrelated to each other,
with only a few exceptions among enterobacterial strains
(data not shown). This suggests that the inserts are
replaced rapidly on the evolutionary scale, perhaps, via
the mechanism outlined in Fig. 5c. A broader implication
is that the dominant phages and plasmids encountered by
even closely related bacteria are different leading to the
rapid generation of distinct repertoires of psiRNAs.
In terms of their ultimate function, the putative psiRNAs
appear to be conceptually most similar to eukaryotic siRNAs in that they are homologous to foreign, rather than
endogenous, genes and are predicted to function as part of
a defense system. However, the psiRNAs also share a
major feature with the miRNAs in that they are embedded
in and, probably, cleaved from a specific precursor molecule, rather than from a long dsRNA like the siRNAs (Fig.
5). In an attempt to elucidate common features of the
psiRNA precursors, we predicted the secondary structures

of all available CRISPR units. The results were somewhat
ambiguous as shown in Fig. 7. The folding free energies of
GC-rich CRISPR units were substantially lower than those
for the shuffled CRISPR units; notably, the CRISPR folding energies were distributed similarly to those of miRNA
precursors (Fig. 7a), with numerous CRISPR units capable
of folding into highly stable secondary structures. These
observations suggest the possibility that psiRNA precursors possess a distinct secondary structure that could be
important for recognition by p-dicer, RAMPs or other proteins. However, the folding energy distribution for AT-rich
CRISPR shows only a slight shift compared to the distribution for shuffled sequences and is completely different
from the distribution for miRNA precursors of the same
base composition (Fig. 7b). Thus, AT-rich psiRNA precursors, which comprise approximately half of the CRISPR,
on average, do not seem to be capable of folding into stable secondary structures. Thus, the existence of a functionally relevant consensus structure of psiRNA precursors
remains uncertain.
Figure 8 shows two predicted secondary structures of
putative psiRNA precursors in which the inserts are
homologous to phage or plasmid genes. The relatively

GC-rich sequence from Xanthomonas axonopodis forms a
stable secondary structure, whereas the AT-rich sequence
from Streptococcus thermophilus can fold only into a weak
stem-loop structure. Curiously, in both cases, the unique
insert contributes significantly to stem formation. Clearly,
further analysis of the structures of putative psiRNA precursors by computational and experimental means is
required to identify their functionally important features.

Conclusion
Obviously, the entire concept of the prokaryotic CASS
defense system functioning on the RNAi principle currently remains a hypothesis. However, we believe that
three lines of evidence make such a mechanism, in its
broad outline, almost a logical inevitability: i) the indisputable origin of at least some of the unique CRISPR
inserts from phage and plasmid genes, ii) the demonstration of transcription and processing of the CRISPR loci in
A. fulgidus and S. solfataricus, and iii) the abundance of
CASS components that are clearly implicated in nucleic
acid degradation, processing, and possibly, recombination. The only substantial variation on the theme of RNAi
could be an antisense mechanism acting on DNA. Such a
mechanism is, obviously, much less common than post-

transcriptional gene silencing by small RNAs, but is not
without precedent. Indeed there are strong indications
that elimination of intergenic DNA sequences in the
macronucleus of the ciliate Tetrahymena occurs via a
siRNA-mediated mechanism, with the participation of a
specific dicer-slicer pair [54,55]. In principle, this mechanism is compatible with the finding of both sense and
antisense sequences among CRISPR inserts homologous
to phage and plasmid genes (Table 5). Nevertheless, given
the much wider prevalence of silencing pathways and, in
particular, the demonstrated instances of antisense RNA
regulation in bacteria, it seems most likely that CASS acts
by silencing genes from invading replicons. This being
said, it should be emphasized that the mechanisms
depicted in Figure 5 are only rough outlines of some of the
ways in which this system could function. There is no
doubt that experimental studies will reveal mechanisms
different from these, at least, in detail. However, regardless of the specific mechanisms and even whether the predicted psiRNA systems acts on RNA or on DNA, it appears
certain that its main function is RNAi-mediated defense
against alien replicons invading archaea and bacteria.
The predicted psiRNA system resembles the eukaryotic
counterparts not only in its functional principle but also
in the general characteristics of the implicated proteins.
What is most striking is the comparable complexity, diver-

sity, and plasticity of the protein machineries involved.
Both systems consist of one or more helicases, a broad
spectrum of nucleases, a specific polymerase, and a variety
of RNA-binding proteins. Both in CASS and in RISCs, only
two or three protein subunits appear to be truly indispensable; the rest come and go, resulting in a variety of RISCs
with their distinct functions, many of them still poorly
understood [7-9], and, presumably, in a comparable
diversity of CASS. Remarkably, however, not a single protein belonging to the bona fide CASS has an ortholog in
eukaryotes, involved in RNAi or otherwise. The single
direct link could be the argonaut protein which is the central active moiety of eukaryotic RISCs (slicer) and might
have some functional connection to CASS in archaea as
tentatively suggested by the M. kandleri CASS operon
structure; admittedly, however, the indications of potential involvement of argonaut in the CASS functioning are
currently quite weak.
The eukaryotic RNAi systems come in two basic varieties:
i) siRNAs that are produced from dsRNAs of viruses and
transposons and protect the host from the respective
agents via perfect base-pairing with the respective target
mRNAs, and ii) miRNA that regulate translation of endogenous genes via either perfect (plants) or imperfect (animals) base-pairing [6]. CASS appears to be the functional
counterpart of the siRNA mechanism inasmuch as it

seems to be involved in defense against infecting agents,
the psiRNAs seem to be derived from the invading
genome and are predicted to function via perfect basepairing with the target. From a different viewpoint, however, this system is similar to miRNA in that the active
small RNA moieties are encoded in the prokaryotic
genomes rather than produced from the foreign dsRNA.
The closest eukaryotic analogs of the CASS system might
be the rasiRNAs that, like the putative psiRNAs, are
encoded in the genome, are generated by processing of
double-stranded molecules formed by symmetric transcripts of transposons (or repeats thought to be of transposon origin) and silence the latter, which contributes to
heterochromatin formation [11-13,56]. In contrast, the
bacterial small antisense RNA regulatory pathways that
employ Hfq and RNAse E that target regular, chromosomal bacterial genes, rather than those of infectious
agents or transposons [14-16], seem to be the functional
counterpart of eukaryotic miRNA systems. Thus, prokaryotes seem to have at least two distinct RNAi systems none
of which is operated by homologs of eukaryotic RNAi protein machinery components. Furthermore, unlike the case
of eukaryotes where the siRNA, rasiRNA, and miRNA systems are operated by substantially overlapping sets of proteins [8], the prokaryotic systems seem to be completely
independent from one another.
Clearly, our interpretation of the probable functions of
CASS is based, in large part, on the analogy with the
eukaryotic siRNA system. There might be danger in heavily relying on analogy as a prediction method because, if
the basic premise is false, the entire scheme will fall apart.
However, in the case of CASS and eukaryotic siRNA, the
analogy stems from two a priori independent lines of evidence, namely, the discovery of CRISPR inserts homologous to phage and plasmid genes and the functional
similarity between Cas proteins and components of
eukaryotic RNAi systems, e.g., dicer. Should there be no
bona fide functional analogy between CASS and RNAi,
there would be no basis for this congruence. By contrast,
the homology of CRISPR inserts to phage and plasmid
genes and, more generally, the association of cas genes
with CRISPR have no explanation in the context of our

previous hypothesis that CASS is a repair system [23]
which forces us to abandon this interpretation of the
CASS function.
All the analogies notwithstanding, the predicted psiRNA
system shows at least one fundamental difference from
the eukaryotic counterpart: the coding segments for the
putative psiRNAs are derived from genes of invading
agents and incorporated into the host genome to confer
heritable immunity to the respective agent. As an acquired
immunity mechanism, CASS resembles more the vertebrate immune system than the eukaryotic RNAi pathways
but, again, with the crucial difference that the animal
immunity is not inheritable. Furthermore, the wide
spread of CASS that spans a great variety of prokaryotic
lineages contrasts the narrow presence of classical immunity which appears to be a mechanism specific to jawed
vertebrates; the recent discovery of a dramatically different
immunity system in jawless vertebrates [57] emphasizes
the status of the immune system as a lineage-specific evolutionary novelty. More generally, it appears that CASS is
one of the most ancient if not, indeed, the primordial biological defense system that probably emerged at an early
stage of prokaryotic evolution, considering that diverse
viruses, in all likelihood, have accompanied cellular life
from its very beginning. Given the ubiquity of CASS in
archaea and its less prominent presence in bacteria, one
scenario is that CASS emerged in an ancient ancestor of
archaea and spread to bacteria horizontally.
Interestingly, as a mechanism of inheritance of acquired
traits, CASS seems to come closest to a true Lamarckian
mode of evolution among all known systems of heredity.
Remarkably, however, this putative system of Lamarckian
inheritance appears to be extremely volatile on the evolutionary scale as indicated by the lack of conservation of
the psiRNA sequences even between closely related
strains. A general implication of this aspect of CASS evolution is that the diversity of mobile replicons (phages,
plasmids, transposons etc) in nature might be even more
enormous than it is currently estimated [58,59] such that
even closely related bacteria occupying similar niches are
predominantly invaded by different agents. Additionally

or alternatively, it is conceivable that, in many niches, the
dominant phages and plasmids rapidly turn over with
time, making existing CRISPR cassettes obsolete as
defense means and triggering their exchange.
Finally, a practical note. It seems that, once the psiRNA
mechanism described here is investigated experimentally,
it could be exploited to silence any gene in organisms that
encode CASS. The simple design of such experimental
gene silencing in prokaryotes will involve transfection
with a plasmid containing the desired psiRNA inserted
between CRISPR to facilitate homologous recombination.

Methods
Genome sequences, databases and sequence analysis
The complete bacterial and archaeal genome sequences
were retrieved from National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI, NIH, Bethesda) FTP site. The nonredundant database of protein sequences at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NIH, Bethesda)
was iteratively searched using the PSI-BLAST program
[31]. The cut-off of E < 0.01 was normally employed for
inclusion of sequences in the position-specific weight
matrices. Each retrieved sequence was used as the query
for additional searches until no new sequences could be
detected. For detecting subtle sequence conservation, the
PSI-BLAST search results were visually examined and
sequences with greater E-values, but containing signature

Phylogenetic analysis
Distance trees were constructed from multiple protein
sequence alignments after excluding poorly aligned positions, by using the least-square method as implemented
in the FITCH program of the PHYLIP package [65,66].
Maximum likelihood trees were constructed using the
ProtML program of the MOLPHY package, with the JTT-F
model of amino acid substitutions, by optimizing the
least-square trees with local rearrangements [67,68].
Identification and analysis of CRISPR repeats
Search for repeats was performed as follows: first, all
exactly matching 20-mer anchor substrings were identified in the nucleotide sequence of a bacterial or archaeal
genome. Alignments around these anchors were
expanded in both directions, to include all adjacent positions with information content above or equal to 1.5 bits
[69]. All identified high-similarity fragments were used as
queries in nucleotide BLAST [70] search (word size 7; mismatch penalty -1; both gap opening and extension costs 1; E-value threshold 0.001) to detect more diverged versions of the repeats as well as the instances of the repeat in
the opposite strand. To determine the repeat boundaries
more precisely, sequences of all loci with short (20 nt)
flanks added were collected and aligned using the MUSCLE program [61]. Alignments were trimmed from the 5'
and 3' termini up to columns with information content
exceeding 1.3 bits. Repeat families that shared the spatial
arrangement typical of CRISPR (median repeat length of
20–50 nt; median spacer length of 15–60 nt) were identified as CRISPR candidates and further examined for chromosomal proximity to cas genes. The custom PERL scripts
used for this analysis are available upon request.

Sequences of eukaryotic miRNAs precursors, CRISPRs,
and randomly shuffled CRISPR sequences were computationally folded, and the free energy of the most stable secondary structure was calculated using a a dynamic
programming algorithm that employs nearest neighbor
parameters to evaluate free energy [71]. Energy minimization was performed by dynamic programming method
that finds the secondary structures with the minimum free
energy by summing up the contributions from stacking,
loop length, and other structural features, using improved
thermodynamic parameters [72].

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Eric Bapteste, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada

Main comments:
The scientific quality of this paper and its methodology is
certain. There has been a lot of good and interesting work
done here. As indicated by its title, it thus provides multiple information and one hypothesis about RNA-interference in prokaryotes. Because of this broad scope, the
manuscript is quite large. In fact, several of its parts could
be read on their own, depending on the reader-specific
interest, this is notably the case for the part dealing with
the hypothesis of a RNAi prokaryotic immune system. I
would thus suggest that a shorter version of the paper,
centered around this very interesting hypothesis could be
proposed online (with the first part turning into Supp.
Mat.), because I feel that this part is going to receive more
attention anyway, and it would be unfortunate if some
readers did not consider this aspect because they are
scared by the overall size of the paper. But this is simply a
suggestion, and the authors are more than welcome to disregard my opinion.
Author response: While we fully understand the sentiment
and agree that the hypothesis on prokaryotic RNAi is of greater
general interest than the detailed presentation of the protein
sequence-structure analysis, we strongly feel that the latter provides a badly needed foundation for the hypothesis as well as
important information in its own right. Furthermore, we tend

to believe that the general spirit of online publication is to
present complete results of a study (of course, there are exceptions). The reader can easily navigate between sections, so the
length of a paper does not represent a particularly severe problem. Furthermore, we made certain modifications to the protein
analysis part in response to similar but more specific comments
of Martijn Huynen, in particular, introduced additional subheadings which, hopefully, makes this part of the paper more
reader-friendly.
The seductive hypothesis of a RNAi based immune system
is presented as an analogy with the eukaryotic RNAi system. The use of analogy is potentially challenging: on the
one hand, it allows a powerful and elegant presentation of
many complex genomic results, but on the other hand, it
is questionable, since the analogy may impose an a priori
model to interpret biological features, and if this model is
incorrect, if the analogy does not hold, there is a risk that
the genomics data receive a fairly biased interpretation. In
this respect, it would be interesting if the authors discuss
whether an homologous immune system could have been
possible in eukaryotes and in prokaryotes, and why it is
not found. Indeed, such an homologous system would be
a more natural reference to interpret the data than an analogy.
Author response: We understand the epistemological concerns regarding the role of analogy in this study. However, as
indicated by the reviewer himself, the analogy is strong. Moreover, this analogy is manifest at two different levels: i) the presence of inserts homologous to phage and plasmid genes in
CRISPR units and ii) presence of predicted activities compatible with a siRNA-like system among cas gene products, in particular, the dicer analog. Had the analogy been false, there
would be no reason whatever for this congruence. We briefly
comment to that effect in the revised manuscript. The idea of
homologous immune systems in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
seems a little far-fetched. Nevertheless, this comment prompted

had led to too relaxed definitions of CASS. In another situation, by contrast, the use of the analogy could perhaps
be too strict. On page 18, the authors wonder how to
identify «the slicer counterpart (p-slicer)» in prokaryotes.
They explain that this identification is «less straightforward because of the diversity of predicted nucleases
within the CASS». But, after all, why should there be only
one p-slicer, as in eukaryotes? It is possible that prokaryotes have multiple «p-slicers».

us to incorporate a brief comparison of the evolutionary histories
of RNAi and classical immune systems.
This being said, I do not feel that the use of the analogy
was a problem here, as it is convincingly presented and
argued by the authors. We could eventually question
more if all the so-called CASS genes are really involved in
the prokaryotic immune systemand deserve their label:
some may just be present in the genomic proximity of
CRISP, yet having nothing to do with the RNA interference. They might just be mobile «travelling» genes. A further study of the genomic distribution of the homologs of
the CASS genes in bacterial genomes may help to clarify
which genes are strongly and exclusively CRISP related
and which ones can be found also in alternative locations
in different genomes. Then, perhaps the «striking diversity
of still poorly characterized CASS components» described
on page 16 would appear less striking if some CASS categories are simply not relevantly defined, and include unrelated proteins, since maybe, the use of the analogy would

Author response: Yes, we agree, the possibility of multiple
slicers exists, and we modified the text to acknowledge this.
With regard to the rest of this comment, however, we feel that
the current diversity of prokaryotic genomes is already sufficient
to make conclusions on the strength of the association of individual genes with CASS, and the genes are classified here
accordingly, as true CASS components and loosely associated
"satellites". As far as the latter are concerned, inferences on
involvement with CASS functions are made only for those genes
whose activities appear clearly relevant, like the RT or Argonaut.
Finally, the strong suspicion about the analogous and
intricate functions of COG1518 and COG1343 (cf. page
21) could be similarly toned down. Maybe these genes do
play the essential analogous role of CRISPR integrase/
recombinase consistently with the analogy, but maybe
they fulfill several different tasks. Perhaps the authors
would like to comment more on some of these minor
points.
Author response: Actually, this prediction is not based on
analogy with eukaryotic RNAi systems but rather on the mutualistic association of these genes to CRISPR and the features of
the proteins themselves. We dropped the "strong" suspicion but,
generally, we strongly believe that this is the best possible prediction. Reference to multitasking might not be particularly
productive unless there are good ideas regarding what these
multiple functions might be (this is different from the above
possibility that there are multiple slicers which is, indeed, compatible with the data).
Also, to go back to the CASS gene evolution, the authors
mention, page 8, « the extraordinary evolutionary mobility of CASS». It is unclear to me how this statement has
been tested, and how the authors have established that
CASS genes are more mobile than any average gene randomly picked in the same collection of prokaryotic
genomes. For this reason, I am not sure if, as claimed by
the authors, on page 14 «the pol-cassette comprises a distinct evolutionary unit that is often transferred horizontally independently of the CASS-core». Does the CASScore really have an established vertical mode of inheritanceor, as the authors stated before, a «non-uniform» distribution (cf. page 8)? This might be more strongly argued.

Author response: Several distinct issues are addressed here.
With regard to the 'extraordinary mobility' of CASS, this is
demonstrated by the trees in Fig. 2(more trees have been published previously in our own 2002 paper and by Haft et al.),
but even more convincingly, by the persistent pattern of presence-absence of CASS in closely related species and even strains
of bacteria. We consolidated the argument such that this
becomes clear the first time "extraordinary" mobility comes up.
It is true that we did not compare the mobility of the CASS components with that of garden-variety prokaryotic genes in a rigorous, quantitative manner. While this is doable, in principle,
all methods we are aware of are open to debate, and we feel that
the exercise is beyond the scope of this paper. Given the above
argument, we believe that, qualitatively, it is clear that CASS
is unusual in this respect. With regard to the pol-casette, we
believe that the discrepancy between the topologies of the two
trees in Fig. 2is quite sufficient for the statement on independent HGT. As for the "vertical mode of inheritance" of CASS,
there seems to be a semantic issue here. We do not really claim
vertical inheritance for CASS but neither is such a pattern necessary to detect horizontal mobility. What is required is a predominant pattern of vertical inheritance among other genes
that allows us to use a species tree to detect HGT. Of course, we
realize that there are substantial arguments for abandoning
"tree thinking"[73]altogether but, on balance, we still believe
that a species tree conceptualized as a central trend in the evolution of gene ensembles [74]is, at least, a useful tool for analysis of genome evolution.
These few questions show a strength of the present work
which interestingly opens perspectives and suggests that
some additionnal analyses should now be conducted,
because the topic deserves consideration. Maybe the
authors would feel like addressing some of the points
below in a revised version of the current paper, or in
future analyses.
Author response: These are, indeed, very interesting questions, we appreciate them. Some are for future studies but we
can provide certain answers now.
Further study could iclude the following:
-Do other genomic regions harboring concentrations of
nucleasescomparable to the ones around CRISP exist elsewhere in the genomes?
Author response: Hardly. As indicated in the paper, the
CRISPR neighborhood is the second most prominent (i.e., the
one that ranks second in the number of genes) neighborhood in
prokaryotic genomes after the ribosomal superoperons, so it is
quite outstanding. However, there are other, considerably small
constellations of nucleases, such as the classical recBCD operon
encoding repair proteins, some restriction-modification systems,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/7

and, perhaps, others that are still poorly understood and deserve
investigation.
- If yes, is there more than one prokaryotic immune system definable on this analogous ground? Notably, did
bacteria without CRISPR evolve a totally different
immune system?
Author response: There is no evidence of that. Furthermore,
as repeatedly emphasized in this paper, CASS shows extreme
evolutionary volatility, apparently being lost quite easily, in a
short time, on evolutionary scale. It is hardly imaginable that
these bacteria evolved a distinct immune system in the short
time elapsed since the loss of CASS. Of course, purely hypothetically, one could perceive the possibility that another immune
system is disseminated horizontally, like CASS, and prokaryotes
having both, could differentially lose one of them. However, we
are unaware of any support for such a scenario. Another prominent prokaryotic defense mechanism is restriction-modification; it would be interesting to examine the relationship
between RM systems and CASS, that could be a subject for a
future study.
-How did the psiRNA pathway arise in thermophiles(cf.
page 20)? Does it result from a transfer? Was it ancestral?
Author response: Very interesting, fundamental questions,
indeed. In response, we expanded the discussion of these and
other aspects of evolution of CASS. The specific preponderance
of CASS in thermophiles, noticed already in the 2002 paper,
when we thought that this was a thermophile-specific repair system, remains a mystery. Whatever the nature of this association, it seems likely that CASS is ancestral in thermophiles (at
least in hyperthermophiles).
- Could we imagine that multiples promoters exist, both
sense and antisense, which would activate the transcription of CRISPR, generating even more RNAi(cf.p 24)?
Author response: In principle, existence of multiple promoters cannot be ruled out. However, the leader sequence seems to
be the only natural candidate for the promoter function. The
rest of the CRISPR cassette is homogeneous (repetitive), so it is
unclear where an alternative promoter would be located. Further, in the two archaeal systems that have been studied experimentally (Archaeoglobus and Sulfolobus) all transcription of
CRISPR loci appear to be unidirectional.
-Finally, it might be challenging, though interesting to test
in vitro on bacterial cultures if, as proposed by the
authors, the presence of CRISP and CASS, has really an
impact on the fitness of prokaryotes in presence of viruses.
Author response: We certainly hope that the computational
analyses and predictions described in this paper stimulate a lot

Page 21 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:7

of experimentation aimed at elucidation of the biological functions of CASS and roles of its individual components.
We greatly appreciate these insightful and stimulating comments.
Minor comments/questions:
On page 7: «functionally analogous» is redundant.
Author response: We see the point but do not really agree.
The word "functionally" seems to add clarity.
On page 8: the sentence «the distribution of COG1518
and, by implication, CASS among prokaryotic lineages...»
is too «bold» for me: even if the conclusion is correct, I am
not sure one can generalize as suggested here from the
case of one protein only.
Author response: Indeed, we can. Rephrased to clarify and
emphasize this.
On page 15: «several other CASS gene families remain
mysterious» is a mysterious sentence. I am not sure what
this does really mean.
Author response: That there is no clue as to the possible functions of these proteins; modified to clarify.
On page 21: I miss the idea of the sentence starting by «In
addition, and probably, more relevantly etc.» to «retroviral genomes». Could you rephrase it to explicit it a little bit
more?
Author response:Rephrased – hopefully, to clarify.
On page 23: what is the criterion retained for homology
between the plasmid genes, fragments of phages and the
CRISPR sequences?
Author response: The following quote from the Methods
addresses this issue:
"Nucleotide sequences of inter-CRISPR spacers were used as a
query in MEGABLAST [70]searches (word size 11; e-value
threshold 0.01) against GenBank; hits to virus or plasmid
sequences and to distantly related prokaryotes were counted separately for each source organism."
On page 48: To me, the multiple positive correlations
evoke multiple causalities and the possibility of some hidden correlations. Would you say that all the relevant combinations have been considered here?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/7

No, we won't claim that. More complex multiple regression
analysis would be required to separate correlations that reflect
true causality; for the purposes of this paper, we felt it was sufficient to note the strongest correlations.

In this very important paper, Makarova and coworkers
propose a detailed mechanism for a putative procaryotic
antiviral immunity system mediated by CRISPS sequences
and their associated Cas proteins (the CAS system, CASS
sensu the authors). Their model is based on the hypothesis
that these elements represent a prokaryotic-specific antiviral mechanism analogous to the eukaryotic RNAi system.
In procaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) there is no
homologs of the proteins involved in the eucaryotic RNAi
system. Untill recently, it was therefore widely believed
that restriction-modification mechanisms were the only
defense available to procaryotes to fight viral infections.
However, it has been proposed last year by several groups
that procaryotic CASS could also play a significant role in
fighting viral aggression in archaea and bacteria (Mojica et
al. 2005, Pourcel et al., 2005, Bolotin et al., 2005).
CRISPR sequences, which are transcribed but non-coding,
are formed by the tandem repetition of units containing
both a conserved element (similar all along a given
CRISPR) and a variable element, the spacer, different from
one unit to the other. The spacer sequences have strikingly
no homologous sequence in databases, except for viral or
plasmid sequences. Both Mojica et al. (2005) and Bolotin
et al., (2005) have suggested that transcription of CRISPR
sequences produce anti-sense RNA that can inhibit transcription of incoming viral (plasmid) sequences and
Mojica et al. (2005) mentioned the analogy of such system with eukaryotic RNAi. However, these authors did
not elaborate on the specific mechanism involved and
how the cas proteins could be involved in the processing
of viral RNA.
In this work Makarova and co-workers have first performed an updated analysis of cas proteins using genomic
context analysis and sensitive methods (iteration
approaches) to detect low level of similarity and to classify
cas proteins in families and superfamilies. They were able
to identify several new putative cas proteins and to define
25 superfamilies of cas proteins and 7 different types of
CASS organization (named CASS1 to 7). They have also
analyzed all available CRISPR repeated sequences and
their putative secondary structures. More importantly,

Page 22 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:7

they try to predict the biological function of the cas proteins and their mechanism of action in the framework of
the RNAi hypothesis. Previously, it has been suggested
that cas proteins were involved in the formation and
spreading of the CRISPR. For instance, Bolotin et al. Have
predicted that cas proteins are acting at the DNA level by
promoting cleavage, recombination and ligation.
Makarova and al are the first to suggest that several cas
proteins should instead interact at the RNA level, by promoting RNA degradation and RNA-RNA hybridization.
They specifically suggest the existence of procaryotic
homologs of eucaryotic dicer (helicase-nuclease) and
splicer (nuclease). They also propose that a previously
suspected DNA polymerase could be an RNA dependent
RNA polymerase used to stabilize RNA/RNA hybrid by
extending iRNA hybridized to their viral mRNA target.
They also suggest the involvement of a reverse transcriptase in the formation of the linker sequences from
viral (plasmidic) mRNA. In my opinion, all these proposals are reasonnable and very convaincing. Another prediction is that RAMP proteins recognize linker sequences of
different sizes. This is supported by a correlation between
the number of linker sequences and the number of
RAMPs encoding genes (Fig. 6). In that case, it's not clear
to me why this could not be due to the binding of RAMPs
to the repeated units, since these units exhibit conserved
sequences and their number (identical to the number of
linkers) should be also correlated with the number of
RAMPs.
Author response: That RAMPs discriminate, one way or
another, between CRISPR inserts, is strongly suggested by the
extreme sequence divergence of RAMPs which is hardly compatible with recognition of identical repeats. To be explicit
about it, we added a clarification at the end of this section.
The search for specific secondary structure associated to
the repeated units did not give convincing results and suggest for me that the dyad symmetry observed in many
repeat units could be due to the binding of proteins with
repeated structure (possibly the duplicated ferredoxin-like
fold present in RAMPs) and not the formation of secondary structures in the transcribed repeats.
Author response: It is hard to see how one excludes the other:
it stands to reason that CRISPR do form distinct secondary
structures which bind to symmetrical proteins.
The model proposed (including possible variation) thus
implies many predictions that could be experimentally
tested. Surprisingly, to my knowledge, only one cas protein has been studied at the bench up to now (ref 70 in the
manuscript). This protein turns out to have DNAse activity in vitro, but I suspect that the authors have not tested a
possible RNAse activity. This is surprising because the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/7

importance of these proteins was already highlighted in
2002 by two in silico papers that in one case suggested
their participation to a "mysterious DNA repair system
and in the other described their association with CRISPR
sequences. The present paper, with much more specfic
predictions, should hopefully strongly stimulate biochemists and molecular biologists to jump onto this really
exciting story. As noticed by the authors in their conclusion, if their hypothesis turned out to be correct, this
prokaryotic RNAi system could be exploited to silence any
gene in organisms that encode CASS. Furthermore, the
experimental study of this system should help us to get
new critical insights on the dynamic relationships
between viruses and archaeal/bacterial populations in
nature.
Finally, I would like to know if the authors have some idea
about the origin of this CAS system. Why is it present in
all archaeal genomes sequenced so far? Is it possible that
this system originated in Archaea and was later on introduced in bacteria by LGT?
Author response: Given the horizontal mobility of CASS, we
can only speculate on the point of its origin. We expand such
speculation in the revised conclusion including the possibility of
archaeal origin.
- In some case, the authors should be more cautious in
their statement. For instance, when they talk about the
pol-cassette, it might led some reader to believe that the
polymerase actvity of the COG1353 protein has been
experimentally validated, which is not the case.
Author response:We added a few more "predicted". However, we did not want to abandon the term 'pol-cassette' as it is
descriptive and succinct.
Reviewer's report 3
Martijn Huynen, Nijmegen Center for Molecular Life Sciences
University Medical Center St. Radboud p/a Center for Molecular and Biomolecular Informatics, Nijmegen, Netherlands

This paper provides a highly interesting and well documented hypothesis about a cluster of genes that E. Koonin
and co-workers have discovered some time ago. By combining biological knowledge with bioinformatics methods and creative thinking the authors propose that
Archaea and to a bit lesser extent Bacteria posses an RNAinterference-based immune system involving CRISPR and
cas genes, that is analogous the eukaryotic RNA interference systems. Although aspects of this hypothesis have
been published before, specifically with respect to
CRISPR, this paper is, as far as I can tell, the first that
makes the analogy between the cas genes and the RNA
interference system. The idea that prokaryotic genomes

Page 23 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:7

would internalize pieces of foreign DNA in order to be
able to defend themselves against it, thus having an
immune system with a memory, would be an interesting
example of Lamarckian evolution.
I do have some questions and editorial comments that I
think should be addressed.
1) Do the authors have any idea why this system has the
phylogenetic distribution that it does, being present in
such a small genome as the nanoarchaeon, but not in e.g.
the majority of Firmicutes
Author response: No mechanistic idea, unfortunate as this
might be. We added some additional discussion of the ultimate
origin of CASS (see the response to Patrick Forterre).
2) concerning the feasibilty of the system proposed by the
authors: Is there anything known about how many fiendly
DNAs a prokaryote encounters in daily life, and how does
that compare to the number of different elements in a
CRISPR ?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/7

Author response: The situation when the insert forms a stem
of varying stability with parts of the repeats is common but not
universal. The positions of the inserts are not exactly the same
although they are, indeed, very similar, and the stems in which
the inserts are involved are imperfect. Of course, the exciting
possibility exists that the CRISPR inserts are specifically selected
for their ability to base-pair with the repeats, however, we do
not have enough data to make that claim.

However, it is well known that phages are extremely abundant,
much more so than bacteria or archaea, and in the revised

3) Regarding the Lamarckian scheme: That the unique element of the CRISPR correspond to highly conserved,
essential elements of phage genes suggests that selection
on genetic variation also plays role here. So the scheme
would be partly Lamarckian.
Author response: Probably, so. The way we state it in the text
"CASS seems to come closest to a true Lamarckian mode of evolution among all known systems of heredity" is compatible with
this view.
4) I am not so convinced by the argument on page 3 that
the results imply that even among closely related prokaryotes the most commonly encountered phages are different. First of all, it is more a corollary of the hypothesis, but
second, it could also reflect the high turnover of phages
over time, rather than niche.
