Abstract
Background: HBV-HIV co-infection is associated with an increased liver-related morbidity and mortality. However,
little is known about the natural history of chronic hepatitis B in HIV-infected individuals under highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) receiving at least one of the two drugs that also affect HBV (TDF and LAM).
Information about HBeAg status and HBV viremia in HIV/HBV co-infected patients is scarce. The objective of this
study was to search for clinical and virological variables associated with HBeAg status and HBV viremia in patients
of an HIV/HBV co-infected cohort.
Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed, of HBsAg-positive HIV-infected patients in
treatment between 1994 and 2007 in two AIDS outpatient clinics located in the São Paulo metropolitan area, Brazil.
The baseline data were age, sex, CD4 T+ cell count, ALT level, HIV and HBV viral load, HBV genotype, and duration
of antiretroviral use. The variables associated to HBeAg status and HBV viremia were assessed using logistic
regression.
Results: A total of 86 HBsAg patients were included in the study. Of these, 48 (56%) were using combination
therapy that included lamivudine (LAM) and tenofovir (TDF), 31 (36%) were using LAM monotherapy, and 7
patients had no previous use of either one. Duration of use of TDF and LAM varied from 4 to 21 and 7 to 144
months, respectively. A total of 42 (48. 9%) patients were HBeAg positive and 44 (51. 1%) were HBeAg negative.
The multivariate analysis revealed that the use of TDF for longer than 12 months was associated with undetectable
HBV DNA viral load (serum HBV DNA level < 60 UI/ml) (p = 0. 047). HBeAg positivity was associated with HBV DNA
> 60 UI/ml (p = 0. 001) and ALT levels above normality (p = 0. 038).
Conclusion: Prolonged use of TDF containing HAART is associated with undetectable HBV DNA viral load. HBeAg
positivity is associated with HBV viremia and increased ALT levels.
Keywords: hepatitis B virus, HIV, virological outcome, tenofovir

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) co-infection is a frequent event because
both viruses share the same routes of transmission. Studies conducted in North America, Europe, and Australia
have shown that between 5% and 10% of all HIVinfected patients are also infected with HBV [1]. In Brazil, this prevalence ranges from 1. 6% to 8. 5% [2-8].

HIV infection has a negative impact in all phases of
the natural history of hepatitis B, leading to increased
rates of persistent infection, higher HBV DNA levels,
and lower rates of hepatitis B and antigen loss [9-11].
Progression of fibrosis, development of cirrhosis, and
liver-related mortality are more frequent among HIVHBV co-infected patients than among individuals
infected with either one alone [9-11].
However, it is still unknown what kind of impact

tenofovir (TDF) (two drugs that are also active against
HBV), may have on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B in co-infected individuals The impact of the use
of antiretroviral therapy in HBeAg status and HBV viremia has rarely been investigated among HIV-infected
patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate clinical and virological variables that may influence
HBeAg status and HBV viraemia in a HIV/HBV coinfected cohort followed up in São Paulo Metropolitan
area, Brazil, that were under antiretroviral therapy which
included anti-HBV drugs, such as lamivudine (LAM)
and tenofovir (TDF).

Methods
Study Design

A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in
two AIDS outpatient clinics located in the São Paulo
metropolitan area, Brazil. HIV-HBV co-infected patients
were included in the study.
Patients

This retrospective study evaluated the medical records
of all HIV patients under treatment between November 1994 and November 2007 in an attempt to identify patients who were also infected with HBsAg.
Clinical, demographic, and serological data contained
in the medical records of HIV patients who had antiHIV antibodies confirmed by Western blot and positive HBsAg serum for longer than 6 months were
analyzed.
The data collected at the time a serum sample was
drawn were: age, sex, CD4 T-cell count, use of antiretroviral therapy, plasma HIV-RNA level, TDF and LAM
therapy and time of use of these drugs, HBeAg status,
HBV viral load, HBV genotype, presence of hepatitis C
infection and hepatitis D super-infection, presence of
advanced liver disease, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
level, and compliance with therapy.
Antiretroviral therapy (including TDF and LAM)
usage was defined as the use of any antiretroviral medication for longer than 6 months at any time prior to the
time a serum sample was drawn. Compliance to therapy
was assessed by the assistant physician. Patients were
considered compliant when their medical records indicated that they had used at least 80% of the medication
prescribed by their doctor.
The Local Ethics Research Boards approved this study
these were the “Comissão de Bioética-CoBi, do
HCFMUSP” (Ethics Commission-Hospital das Clinicas,
Sao Paulo University Medical School) and “Comissão de
Ética da FMABC” (Ethics Commission-ABC Foundation
Medical School). All patients who participated in the
study signed an informed consent form.

Laboratory Testing

Hepatitis B serological testing was performed according
to standard procedures and using licensed assays,
including HBsAg, total anti-HBc, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and
anti-HBe.
Absolute quantification of HBV DNA was carried out
by an in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) [12] assay using primers capable of amplifying
HBV genotypes A to H (28 samples), or by the commercially available COBAS Amplicor HBV Monitor Test
assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (58 samples), as previously described [13,14].
HBV-positive DNA was further amplified and followed
by sequencing of the 737 bp PCR fragment covering
amino acids 48 to 288 to determine genotypes and antiviral resistance. We used primers FHBS1, FHBS2,
RADE1M, and RADE2M described in previous studies
to amplify a larger informative region of the Polymerase
gene [15,16].
Hepatitis C virus infection was defined by the presence of anti-HCV antibodies (ELISA, 3rd generation).
Current HCV infection was confirmed by PCR.
Hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) co-infection was defined
by the presence of positive anti-HDV antibodies by
ELISA. Current HDV infection was confirmed by PCR,
and HDV genotype was determined by sequencing and
phylogenetic analysis, as previously reported [16].
Alanine transaminase (ALT) level was examined at
baseline and on at least two separate occasions during
the 12 months before baseline. A normal ALT level was
considered when at least three consecutive normal ALT
results were obtained during a follow-up of 12 months.
Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were carried out using Stata software
(Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). We initially
conducted an analysis of frequency distribution for each
selected variable. Continuous parameters were compared
between groups using Student’s t-test, except for continuous variables without normal distributions or those for
small groups, in which case the parameters were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. For categorical
variables, the Pearson c2 or Fisher’s exact test were used
according to group size. Differences were considered
statistically significant when p < 0. 05. Multivariate
logistic regression analysis was performed to examine
the association of several variables and HBeAg status
and HBV viremia.

Results
A total of 3,259 patients from the two AIDS outpatient
clinics with confirmed HIV infection and serological
markers for hepatitis B were included. Among them,

154 (4. 7%) were HBsAg-positive. Of these 154, only 86
for whom blood samples were available were included
in the study.
The main characteristics of the study population are
shown in Table 1. Most of the patients were males (96.
5%) and the mean age was 42 years. Patients were analyzed according to their risk factors for hepatitis B infection. Sixty-four (74. 4%) were men who had sex with
men and 16 (18. 6%) were intravenous drug users.
Seventeen patients (19. 7%) presented clinical evidence
of advanced liver disease (splenomegaly, ascites, and
esophageal varices). Nine patients (10. 4%) were not
compliant to the therapy.
Among the 86 patients, 81 (94. 1%) declared previous
use of antiretroviral therapy. For the two drugs that also

work against HBV (LAM and TDF), 79 (91. 8%)
declared previous use of the former and 48 (55. 8%) of
the latter. At the baseline, 31 (36%) and 48 (56%) of
them were under LAM monotherapy or combination
therapy of both drugs, respectively. All patients under
TDF monotherapy were changed to combination therapy with LAM. Time of exposure to TDF and LAM varied from 4 to 21 and 7 to 144 months, respectively.
Among the 34 patients with detectable HBV viremia, 5
had never received any anti-retroviral treatment, 29 had
used LAM, and 13 had also used TDF (LAM + TDF).
Sixteen patients with detectable HBV viremia were on
LAM monotherapy and among them, eight patients presented LAM-resistant mutations. Thirteen patients
under LAM + TDF presented detectable HBV viremia
and among them, LAM-resistant mutations were
detected in five patients. Among the 34 patients with
HBV detectable viremia, no TDF-resistant mutations
were observed.
Forty-two patients (48. 9%) were HBeAg positive and
44 (51. 1%) were HBeAg negative. Baseline plasma HBV
viral load was above 60 UI/mL among 34 (39. 5%)
patients and below 60 UI/mL among 50 (58. 1%) out of
86 patients.
Among the 34 patients with detectable HBV DNA,
HBV genotype distribution was: A-21 (61. 8%); D-5 (14.
7%); G-5 (14. 7%); F-3 (8. 8%). Genotypes B, C, and E
were not detected. Electropherogram analysis did not
show any evidence for the presence of mixed infections
with different genotypes.
Presence of anti-HCV was observed in 20 out of 86
patients (23. 2%) and HCV-RNA was confirmed in 18
patients.
Only one (1. 1%) anti-HDV positive patient was identified. Current HDV infection was confirmed by PCR
and the genotype of this case was determined by phylogenetic analysis of the sequence as HDV-1.
The mean CD4 T-cell count of the 86 patients was
545 (± 250) cells/μ1. Eighty-five percent of patients (73/
86) had baseline HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL. A total of
37% of patients (32/86) had elevated ALT values. ALT
levels were on average twice the upper normal limit.
In univariate analysis, presence of HBeAg was associated with HBV-DNA viral load > 60 IU/ml (p < 0.
001) and ALT level > 1. 5 times the upper normal limit
(p = 0. 002) (Table 2). After multivariate analysis, presence of HBeAg remained associated with the same variables: HBV-DNA > 60 UI/mL (OR 5. 442891; 95% CI 1.
92026-15. 42763; p = 0. 001); and ALT > 1. 5 × ULN
(OR 3. 970025; 95% CI 1. 077474-14. 62782; p = 0. 038).
For HBV viral load, the univariate analysis showed that
HBV-DNA < 60 IU/ml was associated to previous exposure to either LAM or TDF (p = 0. 005), exposure to TDF
(p = 0. 005), exposure to TDF for longer than 12 months

Discussion
Our cross-sectional study evaluated the factors associated to HBeAg status and hepatitis B viremia in HIVHBV co-infected patients in São Paulo, Brazil. Among
86 HIV/HBV co-infected patients with prior use of
either LAM or TDF (or both), we showed that individuals receiving combination therapy with prolonged use
of TDF were significantly more likely to have

undetectable HBV DNA. We also found that presence
of HBeAg was associated with detectable HBV viremia
(HBV DNA > 60 IU/ml) and increased ALT levels. On
the other hand, prolonged TDF use was not associated
to HBeAg seroconversion.
In HBV mono-infected patients, successful HBV therapy can reduce the risk of developing complications
related to liver disease [17,18]. Recent recommendations
advocated undetectable HBV DNA as a treatment goal
in HBV mono-infected patients and co-infected patients
[19-23]. Reaching undetectable HBV DNA also minimizes the risk for developing drug-resistant HBV, which
is one of the most undesirable complications of hepatitis
B treatment [19].

The Brazilian AIDS treatment program provides free
access to highly active antiretroviral therapy for all persons living with HIV/AIDS who seek treatment. The fact
that LAM has been used at large in the country as antiHIV therapy since the mid-1990s means that a great
number of HIV patients in Brazil who are also infected
with HBV, have received this drug for many years. This
situation provides an opportunity to investigate the
effects that this drug, and also TDF, have on HBV when
used for long periods by HIV-HBV co-infected patients.
Most patients included in our study had previously
used antiretroviral therapy, which included LAM (91.
8%). All patients receiving TDF had previous use of
LAM. Among our group of patients, time of exposure
to TDF and LAM varied from 4 to 21 and 7 to 144
months, respectively. Nevertheless, only the prolonged
use of TDF (more than 12 months) was associated with
undetectable HBV viral load.

In patients already using LAM, the use of TDF can
eventually lead to a slower decrease in HBV viremia
[24-27]. This probably explains why we only observed
association between undetectable HBV viremia and prolonged TDF use. Among our patients, the use of TDF
was typically associated with undetectable or low HBVDNA level. Our results are in accordance with previous
studies that addressed the same question [27-29].
Current guidelines recommend the use of TDF and
emtricitabine (FTC), or TDF and LAM, as the nucleos(t)
ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone of
antiretroviral regimens in HIV/HBV co-infected individuals. The benefit of a combination therapy in which
TDF is included over its use as a monotherapy for HBV
has not been definitively demonstrated in any patient
population, including HBV/HIV co-infected patients.
More studies are needed to determine whether TDF
maintains its efficacy for longer periods.

We were able to determine the HBV genotypes in 34
of the patients with detectable HBV viremia. Among
them, the HBV genotype distribution was as follows: A21 (61. 8%); D-5 (14. 7%); G-5 (14. 7%); F-3 (8. 8%).
Genotypes B, C, and E were not detected. Genotypes B
and C are typical from Asian descendants living in Brazil although we do not have any patient with this ancestry in our study, while genotype E has only been found
in Brazil in African immigrants [30].
Our findings suggest that the risk for virological nonresponse is not associated to HBV genotype, as previously suggested by other studies [31]. This may be
explained by the fact that data on HBV genotype distribution were not available before patients started the
therapy. Therefore the genotype distribution reflects
that among patients under the use of LAM or TDF and
presenting detectable viremia, which may not reflect the
genotype distribution of all patients included in our
study.
In our population, five cases of genotype G were identified. This genotype is uncommon in Brazil
The presence of genotype G has been associated by
some authors with a sexual transmission among males
[32]. Indeed, the five patients in our study carrying this
genotype were homosexual males. Additional studies
with larger sample populations that analyze HBV genotypes in individuals with different sexual behaviors will
be enlightening.
Among the 86 HBsAg-positive patients, 42 (48. 8%)
were HBeAg positive and 44 (51. 1%) were HBeA negative. These results agree with other studies also describing a predominance of cases of patients with HBeAg
positivity among HIV-HBV co-infected patients
[29,31,33,34]. Because only a few genotypes were not A
genotypes we were unable to analyze the distribution of
HBeAg seropositivity in the sera of individuals carrying
different HBV genotypes.
Our data showed an association between HBeAg positivity and HBV-DNA viremia. Several studies have
already addressed this question in HIV-HBV co-infected
patients. Our study confirm this data [34,35].
In HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg and
HBV DNA levels are supposed to follow parallel
changes in their levels as they both indicate viral replication. It is noteworthy that despite the fact that in our
study prolonged use of TDF was associated with undetectable HBV DNA, HBeAg was still detectable in most
patients. This finding reflects the initial effects of TDF
in the replicating viral DNA. Its efficacy in decreasing
HBeAg and even HBsAg levels takes longer, as it reflects
a decrease in the translation of viral mRNAs that
depends on decreasing levels of the viral DNA in the
hepatocyte nuclei, especially the cccDNA.

Page 6 of 8

Among mono-infected HBeAg-positive patients, HBe
seroconversion rates are of the order of 20%, after one
year of TDF use. Among co-infected patients on TDF
use, higher rates of seroconversion have been shown in
some cohorts (33%-36%), but only in antiretroviral-naïve
individuals and not when TDF was introduced as a second-line agent. This might be a consequence of immune
reconstitution and acquisition of either enhanced pathogen-specific innate or adaptive immune responses to
HAART [36-39].
Most of our patients had previous use of TDF as a
second-line therapy. Therefore it is reasonable to suppose that for this group of patients a longer follow-up
would be necessary in order to observe HBeAg seroconversion. We have not applied in this study quantitative
assays for HBe or HBsAg that would allow us to follow
their levels during the treatment.
In our study, HBeAg positivity was also associated
with ALT levels 1. 5 times the upper limit of normality.
In patients with HIV-HBV co-infection, little is known
about the association between HBeAg positivity and
ALT levels. Previous studies, mostly in the pre-HAART
era, have suggested that liver damage (assessed by ALT
levels) is less severe in persons with HIV infection and
active HBV replication [40,41]. Nevertheless, the natural
histories of HIV and HBV infections have been touched
by the advent of HAART.
These multidrug regimens changed the course of liver
disease in co-infected patients. The primary mechanism
of HBV-associated liver damage is cell-mediated
immune response. In the present study, most patients
were on HAART, which most likely resulted in at least
partial immunological reconstitution. At baseline, the
mean CD4+ T-cell count of the patients was 545 cells/
mm3. Most of the patients (91. 8%) had previous experience with LAM and resistance mutations were frequently found among patients. We wonder whether the
rise in ALT levels is linked to the partially reconstituted
immune status of these patients.
ALT is considered a marker of hepatic necrosis and
inflammation. As stated above, our study had a crosssectional design, precluding analysis of serially tested
specimens and precluding determination of the evolution of ALT variations over time. It would also be reasonable to suppose that for this group of patients a
longer follow-up would be necessary in order to observe
ALT normalization, assuming that patients would be
adherent to treatment. Rises in ALT in patients with
HIV have multiple etiologies, including antiretroviral
therapy, alcohol and other drug use, as well as opportunistic infections. No particular cause has been identified
in the present study although none of these etiologies
can be ruled out either.

It is noteworthy that the presence of anti-HCV was
also observed in 20 out of 86 patients and HCV-RNA
was confirmed in 18 patients. HCV co-infection may
also have contributed to elevation in ALT observed in
this group of patients.
Furthermore, hepatitis delta virus (HDV) was found in
only one out of 86 patients analyzed. The prevalence of
anti-delta antibodies in HIV patients with detectable
HBsAg ranges from 15% to 50%, depending on geographical region and risk group category [42]. In Brazil,
HDV is endemic in the northern part of the country
(Amazon Basin) and is only exceptionally found outside
this area [43]. This fact probably explains why only one
patient with hepatitis delta was identified. It is interesting to note that the genotype of this case was determined by phylogenetic analysis of the sequence as
HDV-1.
This study has some limitations. First, it has a crosssectional design, precluding analysis of serially tested
specimens and precluding determination of the evolution of serological markers (in particular to follow the
evolution of HBeAg status) or HBV viral load before
antiviral therapy usage. HAART status and HBV characteristics were assessed at a single time point (at
baseline) and data associated to HBV and HIV prior to
HAART initiation were not uniformly acquired. Thus,
we cannot rule out that the associations we observed
were already present before these drugs were introduced. Second, compliance with therapy was not confirmed. Finally, we believe that follow-up of this cohort
will be needed to determine if the associations
observed in our study regarding HBeAg status and
HBV viremia will remain over time and to determine
factors that might be associated with the development
of TDF resistance.

Conclusions
In summary, prolonged use of TDF was able to control
HBV replication in most HIV-HBV co-infected patients.
The prescription of HAART containing anti-HBV drugs,
particularly TDF, had a positive impact on the virological outcome of hepatitis B in HIV-HBV co-infected
patients, regardless of previous LAM treatment.
