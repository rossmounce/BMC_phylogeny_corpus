Abstract
Background: The usefulness of available vaccine and serological tests for leptospirosis is limited
by the low cross-reactivity of antigens from numerous serovars of pathogenic Leptospira spp.
Identification of genus-specific protein antigens (GP-Ag) of Leptospira would be important for
development of universal vaccines and serodiagnostic methods. OmpL1, a transmembrane porin of
pathogenic leptospires, was identified as a possible GP-Ag, but its sequence diversity and immune
cross-reactivity among different serovars of pathogenic leptospires remains largely unknown.
Results: PCR analysis demonstrated that the ompL1 gene existed in all 15 official Chinese standard
strains as well as 163 clinical strains of pathogenic leptospires isolated in China. In the standard
strains, the ompL1 gene could be divided into three groups (ompL1/1, ompL1/2 and ompL1/3)
according to their sequence identities. Immune electron microscopy demonstrated that all
products of the different gene types of ompL1 are located on the surface of leptospires. The
microscopic agglutination test revealed extensive yet distinct cross-immunoagglutination among
the antisera against recombinant OmpL1 (rOmpL1) and leptospiral strains belonging to different
ompL1 gene types. These cross-immunoreactions were further verified by ELISAs using the OmpL1
proteins as the coated antigens in serum samples from 385 leptospirosis patients. All the antisera
against rOmpL1 proteins could inhibit L. interrogans strain Lai from adhering to J774A.1 cells.
Furthermore, immunization of guinea pigs with each of the rOmpL1 proteins could cause crossimmunoprotection against lethal challenge with leptospires from different ompL1 gene types.
Conclusion: Three types of the ompL1 gene are present in pathogenic leptospires in China.
OmpL1 is an immunoprotective GP-Ag which should be considered in the design of new universal
vaccines and serodiagnostic methods against leptospirosis.

Background

Results

Leptospirosis, caused by infection with pathogenic Leptospira species belonging to different serogroups and serovars, is one of the most prevalent zoonotic diseases in the
world [1-3]. A wide variety of serogroups and serovars
have been identified along with endemicity which varies
from region to region [4-6]. The leptospiral vaccines used
currently are mainly multivalent dead whole-cell mixtures
made of several local dominant serovars in different countries and regions. These vaccines, however, do not confer
cross-protective immunity to the serogroups that are not
represented in the vaccine [7,8], allowing the unrepresented serovars to continue causing outbreaks of leptospirosis. For instance, in a central province, Anhui, and
an eastern province, Zhejiang, of China, L. interrogans
serogroup Sejroe serovar Medanensis caused local outbreaks of leptospirosis [9-12]. In addition, vaccination
with the whole-cell vaccines may lead to incomplete,
short-term immunity as well as serious side effects [1315]. A universal vaccine against leptospirosis is not available yet, making the identification of genus-specific protein antigens (GP-Ag) that display extensive crossimmunity very valuable for developing new vaccines and
serodiagnostic methods.

Amplification of ompL1 genes in the standard and clinical
strains
All the 15 standard strains and 163 isolates of pathogenic
Leptospira species (Table 1) carried the ompL1 gene, since
amplicons with the expected size were produced by PCR
from all the strains and isolates (data no shown).

Outer membrane proteins (Omps) are important pathogenic components and highly conserved in different serogroups and serovars of pathogenic leptospires. OmpL1, a
transmembrane Omp with 320 amino acid residues, first
reported by Haake and his colleagues in 1993, is a porin
expressed by all the tested pathogenic Leptospira species
[16-19]. However, the diversity of ompL1 gene sequences
from different pathogenic Leptospira spp. and the distribution of the ompL1 gene in clinical isolates had not been
characterized until now. Moreover, the cross-immunogenicity and immunoprotective effects of OmpL1 were
mostly unknown.
In this study, we sequenced and analyzed ompL1 genes
cloned from standard pathogenic strains of leptospires
prevalent in China. Several prokaryotic recombinant
products of the gene (rOmpL1) were expressed and their
rabbit antisera were prepared. rOmpL1-based ELISAs were
established to examine specific antibodies in sera from
leptospirosis patients. In parallel, the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was performed to detect the crossimmunoagglutination of different antisera against
rOmpL1 proteins, and immunoelectron microscopy
(IEM) was employed to localize OmpL1 on the leptospires. Finally, immunoprotection of rOmpL1 was tested
in guinea pigs. Taken together, our results suggest that
OmpL1 could be used as a major component of a universal and efficient immunogen for vaccination and also for
diagnosis of leptospirosis.

Molecular phylogeny and gene-typing of ompL1 gene
Based on the molecular phylogenetic relationship of their
nucleotide sequences (GenBank Accession No.:
AY622658–AY622672) and putative amino acid
sequences (Figure 1, see Additional file 1 for details),
ompL1 genes from the pathogenic leptospires could be
classified into three groups: ompL1/1, ompL1/2 and ompL1/
3 (Table 2). Sequence identity of the putative amino acid
sequences between ompL1/1 and ompL1/2, ompL1/1 and
ompL1/3, and ompL1/2 and ompL1/3 gene types was
92.50%–93.44%, 85.31%–86.88%, and 85.31%–
86.25%, respectively. In addition, the ompL1 gene
sequencing data of 39 clinical strains also supported the
classification into three groups (Table 2). Both the nucleotide and putative amino acid sequence identities among
the clinical strains with the same ompL1 gene type were
above 98% (data not shown).
Data of secondary structure analysis of OmpL1 proteins
All the three gene types of OmpL1 proteins had very similar predicted secondary structures and antigenic indexes
(Figure 2, see Additional file 2 for details). The OmpL1
proteins had five main putative surface-membrane
regions (70–80, 115–120, 145–150, 235–245, 305–310
amino acid residuals) and seven transmembrane regions
(10–40, 120–130, 160–190, 215–225, 240–250, 270–
280, and 295–305 amino acid residues). The only salient
different was the presence of less alpha-helix in the N-terminal and beta-sheet in the C-terminal region of the
OmpL1/3 sequence, compared to the sequences of
OmpL1/1 and OmpL1/2.
Identification of expressed rOmpL1 proteins and titers of
rabbit antisera
rOmpL1/1, rOmpL1/2 and rOmpL1/3 were well
expressed after induction with IPTG and showed single
bands in gel after purification by Ni-NTA-chromatography (Figure 3). Western blot analysis also indicated that
serum samples from leptospirosis patients could recognize rOmpL1 proteins (Figure 4), implying that the proteins are immunogenic during natural infection.
Immunodiffusion titers of all the rabbit antisera against
rOmpL1 proteins were at least 1:4.
Localization of OmpL1 proteins on leptospires

the surface of L. interrogans serovar Autumnalis strain Lin
4 (ompL1/1 gene type), serovar Lai strain Lai (ompL1/2
gene type), and L. borgpetersenii serovar Ballum strain
Pishu (ompL1/3 gene type) (Figure 5).
Titers of MAT
The antisera against rOmpL1/1, rOmpL1/2 and rOmpL1/
3 were able to cross-agglutinate with MAT titers of 1:100
to 1:800 for all the 15 standard strains and 163 clinical
strains of pathogenic leptospires (Table 3).
Detection of antibodies against rOmpL1 proteins in
leptospirosis patients
In ELISA assays using rOmpL1/1, rOmpL1/2 and
rOmpL1/3, the positive rates for IgG in specimens from
385 leptospirosis patients using 1:100 and 1:200 serum
dilutions were 87.8% (338/385) and 78.2% (301/385),
95.1% (366/385) and 82.1% (316/385), and 77.7%

(299/385) and 65.5% (252/385), respectively (Table 4).
When using 1:50 and 1:100 serum dilutions from the
same specimens, the positive rates for IgM were 83.4%
(321/385) and 72.7% (280/385), 87.0% (335/385) and
77.4% (298/385), and 74.3% (286/385) and 63.1%
(243/385), respectively (Table 4).
Inhibition of adherence by antisera against rOmpL1
proteins
Anti-rOmpL1/1 (1:200 dilution), anti-rOmpL1/2 (1:300
dilution) or anti-rOmpL1/3 (1:50 dilution) sera could
completely inhibit the adherence of L. interrogans serovar
Lai strain Lai to macrophages (Figure 6), demonstrating
cross-inhibition effects among the different anti-sera.
Immunoprotection due to immunization with rOmpL1
proteins
Immunization of guinea pigs with rOmpL1/1, rOmpL1/2
and rOmpL1/3 conferred a significant level of resistance

against lethal challenge with pathogenic leptospires from
the three different ompL1 groups (Table 5). However, the
immunoprotective rates against the same ompL1 gene type
leptospiral infection as the immunizing recombinant protein (62.5%–87.5%) were higher than when strains and
proteins from different ompL1 gene types were used
(25.0%–62.5%).

Discussion
Outer membrane proteins exposed on the surface of leptospires are known to react with the host cell and environment. Interestingly, lipopolysaccharide fractions confer
protective immunity against challenge with homologous
but not heterogonous leptospires, whereas protein extract
induced significant protection against both types of challenge [20]. Thus far, a number of outer membrane proteins of leptospires, such as OmpL1, LipL32, LipL36,
LipL41, LigA and LigB, have been cloned and characterized, and some of them have been shown to stimulate
specific immunity in animal models [21-24]. Among all
the leptospiral Omps, OmpL1 is a unique transmembrane
protein that was confirmed to function as a porin, contribute to the survival of leptospires, and display synergetic
immunoprotection with LipL41 [16-18]. However, major
questions such as the distribution of ompL1 gene types in
leptospiral strains, the exact localization of OmpL1, and
cross-immunogenicity and immunoprotective effects of
OmpL1 proteins remain unaddressed.

This study reveals that the ompL1 gene is present in the
genomes of all the pathogenic leptospires tested. According to our alignment and phylogenetic analysis from the
15 standard strains of pathogenic Leptospira spp., three
groups of ompL1 (ompL1/1, ompL1/2 and ompl/3) exist.
However, the predicted secondary structure of the OmpL1
proteins revealed that there is little difference among the
three groups. Thus, the differences in nucleotide
sequences in the ompL1 gene types may not affect the
immunogenicity and OmpL1 proteins, identifying
OmpL1 as a genus-specific protein antigen.
Surface exposure is a key characteristic for an effective
antigen. Although OmpL1 may be an outer membrane
protein according to previous reports, the precise localization of OmpL1 still remained unclear. Leptospires possess
both inner and outer membranes, but only the proteins
expressed in the outer membrane are capable of interacting with the host immune system. To begin to characterize
the localization, we used the prokaryotic recombinant
expression technique to obtain a large amount of homogeneous OmpL1 proteins for preparation of immunoresponsive antisera from rabbits. Visualization by immunoelectron microscopy using anti-OmpL1 anti-sera confirmed that OmpL1 is located at the surface of the outer
membrane of leptospires. MAT is a standard method for
serodiagnosis of leptospirosis and serological classification of leptospires, for which live leptospiral cells are typ-

ically used [23]. In this study, we used MAT to examine
cross-immunoagglutination among the antisera from
rOmpL1 proteins and a large number of strains belonging
to different pathogenic leptospiral serogroups/serovars.
The results indicated that there is extensive cross-immunoagglutination between the different ompL1 gene types
of pathogenic leptospiral strains and the OmpL1 antisera,
and not surprisingly, the highest agglutination was
observed between antisera from the same ompL1 gene
types as the leptospiral strains. Furthermore, ELISA results
revealed that OmpL1s-specific antibodies are produced in
all the sera from leptospirosis patients, and the trends in
cross-immunoreactivities in the different ELISA tests are
also similar to those of MAT.
At least 75 serovars of pathogenic leptospires belonging to
18 serogroups have been found to date in China, but only
a few of them frequently cause leptospirosis. According to
the annual reports on leptospirosis from Chinese CDCs,
L. interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae serovar Lai
is the most dominant pathogenic leptospires, responsible
for approximately 75% of the morbidity in the country.
The other pathogenic leptospires causing leptospirosis are
the Grippotyphosa, Autumnalis, Australis, Pomona and

Hebdomadis serovars [3,11,25]. Our study showed that
all the 163 clinical strains of different pathogenic Leptospiral serogroup/serovars belong to either the ompL1/1
or ompL1/2 group (data not shown). Thus, we conclude
that leptospires from the ompL1/1 and ompL1/2 groups are
the most prevalent strains in China.
In this study, immunization with either rOmpL1/1,
rOmpL1/2 or rOmpL1/3 proteins could enhance significantly survival of guinea pigs lethally challenged with
pathogenic Leptospira species (Table 5). The immunoprotective rates in the groups, in which animals received a
rOmpL1 for immunization and challenge with the same
ompL1 gene type, appeared to be higher than those being
challenged with different ompL1 gene types.
In a previous study [35], we found L. interrogans serovar
Lai strain Lai could adhere to macrophages, and we here
show that adherence to macrophages could be blocked
with antisera against any of the rOmpL1 proteins, confirming cross-immunogenicity of OmpL1 proteins from
the three different groups. All these data collectively suggest that OmpL1 is likely a genus-specific antigen.

Conclusion
OmpL1 is a transmembrane protein extensively expressed
in pathogenic leptospires. Although the ompL1 gene can
belong to any of three different gene types, the OmpL1
proteins expressed by different gene types have conserved
immunogenicity and the specific antibodies generally
exist in sera of leptospirosis patients. OmpL1 should thus
be viewed as a potential candidate of genus-specific antigen for the development of new universal vaccines and
serodiagnostic methods for leptospirosis.

Methods
Leptospiral strains and serum specimens
The National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical
and Biological Products (NICPBP) in Beijing, China, pro-

vided all 15 official Chinese standard strains belonging to
fifteen different pathogenic serogroups of Leptospira. In
addition, 163 clinical pathogenic Leptospiral isolates and
385 serum specimens from leptospirosis patients with
MAT titers of ≥ 1:100 were provided by the Centers of Disease Prevention and Control of Sichuan, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces in China during 2004–2007 (Table 1). All
the leptospiral strains were cultured in liquid Korthof
medium containing 8% rabbit serum at 28°C [2,25]. All
the patients were clinically diagnosed suffering from acute
leptospirosis based on their medical history and clinical
symptoms, including fevers, jaundice, hemorrhaging,
myalgia and lymphadenectasis, as well as laboratory
examination. Finally, 36 sera samples with negative
results by MAT from healthy individuals for routine soma-

USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(GiBco), and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Amplification and sequencing of ompL1 genes
Leptospiral DNA was extracted using Bacterial Genomic
DNA Extraction Kit (BioColor BioScience & Technology
Co., Shanghai, China) and then dissolved in TE buffer.
Density and purity of the extracted DNAs were detected by
UV spectrophotometery. One pair of primers was applied
to amplify the entire ompL1 gene. The upstream primer
was 5'-CCG CATATG (Nde I) ATC CGT AAC ATA AGT
AAG-3' and the downstream primer was 5'-CCG CTCGAG
(Xho I) GAG TTC GTG TTT ATA ACC-3'. A High Fidelity
PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), in which Taq-Pfu mixture is used as DNA polymerase, was used to amplify the
target gene. The total volume per PCR was 50 μl which
included 20 pmol of each of the primers, 2.5 U Taq-Pfu

Purification Kit (BioColor) and then ligated into plasmid
pMD 18-T using T-A Cloning Kit (TaKaRa) [26]. The
cloned ompL1 genes of 15 standard strains and 39 clinical
strains were sequenced by Invitrogen (Shanghai, China).
Phylogenetic analysis and secondary structure prediction
of OmpL1 protein
The similarity and homology of sequences were first evaluated with the BLASTN program of NCBI. Alignments
were carried out using ClustalX 1.83 software [27] and
manually adjusted using GeneDoc 2.7 software. The
amino acid sequences were deduced from their nucleotide
sequences. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out with
Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Maximum Likelihood
(ML) optimality criteria of the PAUP* package (Version
4.0b10) [28] and MEGA 3.1 software [29]. And the probability prediction for secondary structures [30,31], including antigenic analysis [32] of OmpL1 proteins, was
computed using the protean program in DNAStar™ software package.

digested with Nde I and Xho I (TaKaRa). The recovered
ompL1 segments were respectively linked with the linearized pET42a by T4 DNA ligase (TaKaRa) and then transformed into E. coli BL21DE3 (Novagen). The three
constructed prokaryotic expression systems were induced
with 0.5 mM IPTG in LB medium to express recombinant
OmpL1 (rOmpL1). Expression of rOmpL1 was examined
by SDS-PAGE plus Gel Image Analyzor (BioRad, USA).
The expressed rOmpL1 proteins were extracted and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. New Zealand
white Rabbits provided by the Laboratory Animal Center,
Zhejiang University, were immunized intradermally with
each of the purified rOmpL1 proteins pre-mixed with Freund's adjuvant for four times at an interval of once a week.
On the 15th day after the last immunization, the rabbit
sera were collected and the Immunodiffusion test was
used to examine the titers of antisera [24].

Western blot assay
Western blot analysis was used to identify the immunoreactivity of rOmpL1 proteins using 12 serum samples from
the patients diluted at 1:1000 (the same dilution of normal human sera was used as control) as the primary antibodies, and 1:3000 diluted HRP-labeled goat anti-human
IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., USA) as
the secondary antibody.

and 163 clinical isolates of leptospires, in which normal
saline was used as negative control [2,33].
ELISA assay with rOmpL1 proteins
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were
used to detect rOmpL1/1 or rOmpL1/2-specific IgM or
IgG. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 50 μg/ml
rOmpL1/1 or rOmpL1/2 (100 μl per well) at 4°C overnight, and then incubated with 5% FBS for 30 min to
block unspecific binding. Using the diluted serum specimens from patients or normal individuals (1:50 or 1:100
dilution for IgM detection, and 1:100 or 1:200 dilution
for IgG detection) as the primary antibody, HRP-labeling
goat anti-human IgM (1:3000 dilution) or IgG (1:4000
dilution) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) as the
secondary antibody, and o-phenvlenediamine (OPD) as
the substrate, the rOmpL1 proteins-specific IgM or IgG
were examined under a Microplate Reader (Model 550,
BioRad). OD490 values over the mean plus 3 SD of the 36
normal serum specimens were defined as positive [34].
Adherence inhibition test
J774A.1 cells (1 × 105 cells in 1 ml medium per well) were
inoculated in 12-well plates (Corning, USA) containing
glass cover slips, incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Freshlygrown cultures of L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai were
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 15°C, and the
precipitates were then suspended in antibiotics-free RPMI
1640 medium (GiBco) to a final concentration of 108/ml.
The antisera against rOmpL1 proteins were serially double-diluted with antibiotics-free RPMI 1640 medium (1:2
to 1:32), then mixed with the same volumes of each leptospiral suspension. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C
for 1 h. The medium in the 12-well plates was removed,
and then the plates were repeatedly washed with antibiotic-free RPMI1640 medium. The mixtures were added
into the plates to incubate at 37°C for 1 h. After the incubation, the plates were repeatedly washed with PBS to
remove non-adhered leptospires, and the Fontana silverstained leptospires adhering J774A.1 cells were observed
under light microscope [35]. In this test, preimmune rabbit serum instead of the antisera was used as control.
Immunoprotective test in guinea pigs
Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (150 ± 5 g, 3 weeks old) used
in this study were provided by Laboratory Animal Center
of Zhejiang University (certificate no. SCXK [zhe]20070030). L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai, serovar Autumnalis strain Lin 4, and L. borgpetersenii serovar Bullum
stain Pishu were maintained by serial passage in guinea
pigs for preservation of virulence before use for challenge.
Eighteen groups of guinea pigs (A1–6, B1–6, and C1–C6)
were subcutaneously immunized twice at an interval of
once a week with different dosages of rOmpL1/1,
rOmpL1/2 and rOmpL1/3, respectively. In addition,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/223

another three groups of guinea pigs (D1-3) were immunized with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, USA) as
control. Each protein antigen was pre-mixed with 0.7 mg
aluminum hydroxide (Sigma) [36]. On the 15th day after
the last immunization, the animals were challenged intraperitoneally with lethal doses of strain Lai, strain Lin 4 or
strain Pishu and then observed for another 7 days.
