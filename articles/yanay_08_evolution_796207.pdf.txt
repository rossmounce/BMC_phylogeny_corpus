<p>A presynaptic study of human versus insects sheds light on the composition and assembly of protein complexes in the insect synInsect comparative proteomes

Abstract
Background: The molecular components in synapses that are essential to the life cycle of synaptic
vesicles are well characterized. Nonetheless, many aspects of synaptic processes, in particular how
they relate to complex behaviour, remain elusive. The genomes of flies, mosquitoes, the honeybee
and the beetle are now fully sequenced and span an evolutionary breadth of about 350 million years;
this provides a unique opportunity to conduct a comparative genomics study of the synapse.
Results: We compiled a list of 120 gene prototypes that comprise the core of presynaptic
structures in insects. Insects lack several scaffolding proteins in the active zone, such as bassoon
and piccollo, and the most abundant protein in the mammalian synaptic vesicle, namely
synaptophysin. The pattern of evolution of synaptic protein complexes is analyzed. According to
this analysis, the components of presynaptic complexes as well as proteins that take part in
organelle biogenesis are tightly coordinated. Most synaptic proteins are involved in rich protein
interaction networks. Overall, the number of interacting proteins and the degrees of sequence
conservation between human and insects are closely correlated. Such a correlation holds for
exocytotic but not for endocytotic proteins.
Conclusion: This comparative study of human with insects sheds light on the composition and
assembly of protein complexes in the synapse. Specifically, the nature of the protein interaction
graphs differentiate exocytotic from endocytotic proteins and suggest unique evolutionary
constraints for each set. General principles in the design of proteins of the presynaptic site can be
inferred from a comparative study of human and insect genomes.

Background

The completion of the Drosophila malengaster genome in
the year 2000 provided the first glimpse at the make-up of
animals with a complex nervous system [1,2]. The availability

of several genomes from insects, representing an evolutionary distance of 250 to 300 million years, provided a unique
opportunity to evaluate the foundation of a functional synapse [3]. With many additional animal genomes now

available, including those of primates, marsupials, fish and
birds, a molecular correlation between genes and brain complexity is being actively sought [4,5].
Drosophila has been used for decades as a model in which to
study synapse formation, embryogenesis, development, and
neurogenesis [6]. A combination of biochemical, cell biologic,
genetic, morphologic, and electrophysiologic studies have
unravelled the molecular mechanisms of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis in the fly [7,8] and compared these
with the corresponding mechanisms in vertebrates [9]. In all
neurons, communication across the synapse is mediated by
neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles. Because the
entire process may take only a fraction of a millisecond (in
fast releasing synapses), additional processes ensure the
priming, targeting, and docking of synaptic vesicles at the
active zone [10].
Only the basic mechanism of vesicle fusion is shared between
yeast and human [11]. Specifically, the minimal set of SNARE
(Soluble NSF Attachment protein [SNAP] REceptor) functions is a unified mode of vesicle trafficking. The proper targeting and docking of synaptic vesicles is mediated by a
cognate interaction between vesicular SNAREs (v-SNAREs)
and target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs). The genuine synaptic vesicle protein associated membrane protein (VAMP;
also called synaptobrevin) acts as v-SNARE, whereas the presynaptic membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25 (SNAP of
25 kDa) are t-SNAREs. The multimeric ATPase NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion ATPase) is later recruited to the
SNARE complex by SNAPs [12] and acts to break the
extremely stable SNARE complex, thus reactivating the individual SNAREs for future fusion events. Unlike yeast secretion and vesicle trafficking, synaptic vesicle fusion in the
presynaptic structure requires a large body of regulators to
ensure the spatial and temporal resolution of neurotransmitter release [13].
Regulators of the SNAREs are numerous, and many of them
are conserved throughout evolution. Examples are the Rabs
and their direct regulators [14]. Specifically, Rab3, Rab5,
Rab27, and Rab11 regulate vesicle transport, docking, and
exocytosis of synaptic vesicles [15]. Many of the other Rabs
function in membrane trafficking in general and are strongly
conserved [16,17].
Recently, the composition and the stoichiometry of proteins
and lipids of synaptic and transport vesicles from rat brain
were presented [18]. Based on Mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics technology, about 80 proteins were identified. The
synaptic role of many of these proteins was already established, mainly based on the genetics of model organisms such
as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabtidis elegans [2].
Schematically, the proteins of the synaptic vesicles are associated with the following functional groups: organizers and
cytoskeletal scaffold proteins; transporters and channels;

sensors and signal transduction proteins; priming, docking,
and fusion apparatus [19,20]; endocytotic and recycling
machinery [7,21-23]; and linkers between the presynaptic
and postsynaptic membranes [2].
In addition, scaffolding proteins are critically important during the development and shaping of new synapses [24]. These
proteins are a combination of adhesion, cytoskeleton, and signaling proteins. The specificity of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) is primarily defined by the composition of
receptors, transporters, and ion channels in the presynaptic
and postsynaptic density (PSD) structures [25]. In addition to
their role in neuronal transmission through ion channels,
PSD proteins are essential in establishing a protein network
that bridges the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix [2].
Herein, we focus on the basic function of the synapse, and
specifically the trafficking, exocytosis, and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and analyze it in molecular terms. We compiled
a list of 120 gene prototypes, called 'PS120', which comprises
the core set of proteins associated with synaptic vesicles and
presynaptic structures. This list includes components of the
SNARE complex and their regulators, as well as components
of the trafficking and organization apparatus of the active
zone. In comparison with humans, there are many fewer paralogous genes in the four insects whose genome sequence has
been completed (namely fly, mosquito, honeybee, and beetle). This comparative view is instrumental for in silico
genome annotations but it also exposes instances in which a
specific gene or a regulation network is lost. We show that the
number of protein-protein interactions in which a protein
participates and the degree of sequence conservation from
insects to human are positively correlated. The architectures
of proteins responsible for processes in the synapse such as
exocytosis and endocytosis differ markedly. We show that a
systematic comparative genomics view of the fly, honeybee,
mosquito, and beetle proteomes reveals general principles in
the design of presynaptic structures.

Results
Evolutionary relationships among insects
Insects are an ancient group of animals, the first of which
probably appeared 360 to 400 million years ago. Analyses of
insect genomes and proteomes provide a unique opportunity
to compare evolution between the model organism D. melanogaster and numerous additional insect genomes. The
insects whose genomes were sequenced ensure coverage of a
valuable phylogenetic breadth, spanning the fruit fly (D. melanogaster(, the honey bee (Apis mellifera), the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), the mosquitoes (Anopheles
gambiae and Aedes aegypti), the silk worm (Bombyx mori)
and the wasp (Nasonia vitripennis). All together, about
330,000 protein sequences from insects are currently available in public protein databases, which already include 12
additional Drosophila genomes. A current list of insect

The 120 presynaptic representatives from human (PS120) are indicated by their official gene names. Sequence conservation between human and
insect proteomes is indicated by A to E. Sequence similarity index (S) is divided into five levels marked: A = >75%, B = >65%, C = >50%, D = >35%,
and E = <34%. In the 'M' columns, an asterisk indicates that the gene is absent from the public protein databases. Detailed information on PS120 is
provided in Additional data files 2a,2b.

genome projects is accessible in Additional data file 1. In the
present study we refer only to representative genomes that
are substantially divergent and include the beetle, honeybee,
mosquito, and fly (with D. melanogaster being the reference).
We focus on establishing a functional synapse whose molecular assembly governs learning and memory as well as the
complex behavior of the organism.

A catalog of presynaptic gene representatives from
human and insects
We compiled an extended catalog of mammalian presynaptic
proteins based on the detailed anatomy of the synaptic vesicle
[18], data from functional annotations by Gene Ontology
(GO) [26], and a manual collection of genes of presynaptic
function [27]. This collection is compared with insect proteomes. A summary of the sequence conservation of each
gene (a total of 120 representative genes) with the insect proteome is shown in Table 1. Analyzing this catalog (PS120 presynaptic 120 genes) revealed that 50% are well conserved
and have a sequence similarity in excess of 65% for most of
the sequence. Among them, 60% are at a similarity level in
excess of 75% for most of the sequence. Thus, the majority of
proteins that participate in human presynaptic structures are
extremely well conserved.

Most of the PS120 proteins belong to gene families, with some
of the families being very large. For example, synaptotagmins
and Rabs have numerous alternative spliced variants in addition to their large number of genes (17 and 60, respectively).
For most instances, the size of the gene family in insects is
smaller and on average is only 40% when compared with
human. To exemplify this observation, we investigate the syntaxin family. There are 12 genes in human (and additional
variants) that can be divided into subfamilies. The human
subfamily of syntaxin 1, which functions as the t-SNARE in
synaptic vesicle fusion (including Stx1, Stx2, Stx3, Stx4, and
Stx11), is represented by only two genes in the fly (namely
dStx1 and dStx4) [1] and in the other insects. However, in
general, there are more gene variants that result from alternatively splicing events in the fly genome relative to the other
insects.
A search of insect homologs for the PS120 clearly shows that
even within the most conserved set between human and
insects (60 genes), there are 12 genes for which there is no
clear homolog in the current protein databases in at least one
of the insect representatives (honeybee, beetle, mosquito, and
fly). The same applies to about 30 additional proteins from
the remainder of the PS120 gene list. Additional information

on protein partners and protein length, and detailed information on the levels of sequence conservation is provided in
Additional data files 2.

Recovering missed annotation genes by comparative
genomics
The completion of genomes for at least four insect representatives and the additional information from partially assembled genomes (Additional data file 1) makes it possible to
revisit some of the apparently missed genes (Table 1 and
Additional data file 2). Evidently, comparing related genomes
enhances the quality of in silico genome annotations [28]. A
search in the public non-redundant database revealed that
about one-third of the PS120 homologous sequences were
missing in at least one of the insect representatives (Table 1).
Moreover, for a small number of genes, no homologs were
detected in any of the insects. In cases in which significant
sequence similarity in all four insect representatives is
absent, we strongly argue that these genes are genuinely
absent in insects. This is supported by a lack of significant
similarity in additional fly genomes, and in the silkworm and
the wasp genomes (Additional data file 3).
Additional data file 3 provides information on apparently
missing genes that are not apparent from protein databases
(see Materials and methods, below). For 70% significant similarity in the genome-assembled sequences was identified.
This high similarity is often supported by the existence of an
expressed mRNA. For a few genes, only limited evidence on
transcription levels exists. More importantly, for 11 genes no
homologs were detected in insects by searching protein data
against translated insect genomes. Among these genes are
growth-associated protein (GAP)-43, which is implicated in
cytoskeleton and protein kinase C signaling during synapse
establishment [29], and two large proteins that shape the
cytoskeletal mesh at the active zone: bassoon (about 3,900
amino acids) and piccolo (about 5,100 amino acids) [30]. In
addition, the SNARE regulator complexin 4, the syntaxintubulin binding protein syntabulin (FLJ20366), and SNAP25-interacting protein are not detected in insects. Although

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R27

Yanay et al. R27.6

most proteins of the synaptic vesicle membranes are strongly
conserved, we were unable to detect SV31 (also called
TMEM163; a genuine protein of the synaptic vesicle (SV)
membranes) [31] or synaptophysin (one of the most abundant proteins in mammalian synaptic vesicles). Furthermore,
no sequence similarity was noted for the syntaxin regulators
amisyn (STXBP6) [32] and syntaphilin [33]. Syntaphilin,
which has been implicated in regulation of exocytosis and
endocytosis [34], is conserved from human to pufferfish and
zebrafish but was lost in the branch of the frogs and insects. A
borderline similarity to dynactin and α-liprin suggests that
the function in cytoskeletal remodeling and in cell-matrix
interactions may be taken over by other proteins. Interestingly, many of the genes that are not conserved from human
to insects are functionally related to active zone architecture
and specifically to the underlying cytoskeleton mesh of the
synapse.

Insights into the most conserved proteins of the
exocytosis core complex
In the PS120 gene list, rather close conservation is evident
between insect and human genes (measured by a similarity
>75% throughout the sequence) for 16 genes. This small set
includes the v-SNARE VAMP2, the t-SNARE syntaxin 1A, and
a few small GTP proteins (Ral, Rab3A, ARF1, and ARF6). In
addition, this set includes essential components of the endocytic machinery (dynamin 1, AP2, AP3, EHD1, and clathrin)
and proteins that activate transduction pathways (calmodulin
and 14-3-3). That the function of these gene products is indispensable was expected, but proteins that coordinate synaptic
vesicles with the active zone are also included in this selected
list, namely cytohesin-1 [35] and Mals-1 [36]. Both of these
proteins share a function in determining the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles and are critical for
replenishing this pool.
In an attempt to gain new information on the structure and
function of presynaptic proteins, we applied a comparative
view and conducted multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
analysis of human and insects for representatives of the exo-

cytotic machinery, VAMP-2, and synaptotagmin 1 (Figure 1).
VAMP-2 is a short, evolutionary conserved protein of 120 to
220 amino acids with a SNARE-interacting domain and a single transmembrane domain (TMD) that crosses the synaptic
vesicle membrane. Short signatures in VAMP's sequence that
serve as recognition sites for tetanus and botulinum toxins
[37] and the amino acids that are critical for VAMP targeting
[38] are conserved from human to insects (Figure 1a). The
sequence difference in the MSA is restricted to VAMP2 protein tails. A short proline-rich region that is responsible for
VAMP2 interaction with synaptophysin [39] is not conserved.
This is in accordance with the lack of synaptophysin in insect
synaptic vesicles [40] (Table 1). On the other hand, a short
region facing the synaptic vesicle lumen is highly conserved
among all insects. Interestingly, there are two VAMP variants
in honeybee that differ only in their luminal domain, enforcing a functional difference between these two variants (Figure
1). The possibility that a functional binding domain is located
in the luminal domain is consistent with findings for other
synaptic vesicle proteins, including synaptotagmin [41] and
SV2 [42].

are suggested (syntaxin; Additional data file 5). These
sequences are probably essential in interactions between yet
undefined partners that are common to mammals and
insects. Most MSAs of PS120 show that the level of conservation is much higher among the insect sequences as compared
with human or other organisms. We emphasize that MSA
from insects to human for strongly conserved proteins (synaptotagmin, syntaxin 1A, and VAMP2) and for much less conserved genes (stoned B, SCAMP1, and synapsin 1) is
instrumental in detecting overlooked sequences that may be
important for protein interactions, protein modifications,
and regulatory functions. The MSA for syntaxin 1 and synapsin 1 is included in Additional data file 5.

MSA of highly conserved sequences from human to insects
was also performed for synaptotagmin (Figure 1b). Synaptotagmins belong to a large and diverse gene family that coordinate multiple signals with trafficking and with membrane
fusion [5,43,44]. In the mammalian synapse, synaptotagmin
1 (and 2) is a genuine synaptic vesicle protein that serves as
the calcium sensor and interacts with SNAREs as well as with
the calcium channel [45]. In addition, synaptotagmin is a
linker to the endocytotic adaptor protein AP2 [46]. The overall similarity of synaptotagmin between mammals and insects
is high throughout the cytoplasmic region, but this similarity
does not extend to the luminal region. In the cytoplasmic
region, the domain that was postulated to interact with AP2
and with neurexin is strongly conserved, suggesting that not
only is the main function of the protein conserved but also is
its engagement in a rich protein interaction network.

The exocyst is a large complex that was initially identified at
the tip of the yeast bud. It participates in tethering vesicles to
the plasma membrane. It coordinates exocytosis with small
G-protein signalling molecules such as Ral-A, Arf6, and
Rab11 [47]. The exocyst is composed of eight subunits that are
denoted EXOC1 to EXOC8 (Figure 2a) and are homologs of
the yeast Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and
Exo84 genes [48]. The level of conservation of the various
subunits between human and fly range from 30% to 50%
sequence identity (50% to 70% sequence similarity; Figure 2).
The homologous relationship is evident and is supported by
alignments that cover the entire protein length. However,
among the insects, the mutual sequence conservation for
EXOC8 is rather low (Figure 2a), because the honeybee and
beetle homologs for EXOC8 are further diverged; hence, an
apparent homology could not be assigned. Because the function of the exocyst relies on coordination of its subunits, we
anticipated that EXOC8 would be missed during the task of
genome annotation. This is further supported by the observation that several interacting proteins of the exocyst such as
Ral-A [47] and septin 5 [49] are strongly conserved in all
insects (Figure 2b). A search for sequence similarity in the
honeybee and beetle genomes identified a supported mRNA
for EXOC8 in honeybee and an apparently unprocessed
sequence in the beetle genome (for details, see Additional
data file 3). We conclude that physical complexes co-evolved
because of similar evolutionary constraints.

Because endocytosis and membrane recycling are integral
processes in presynaptic function, we compared stoned B
(STNB) between human and insects [46] (Additional data file
4). Stoned genes (in insects StnA and StnB) are part of the
protein lattice network that is involved in clathrin-mediated
endocytosis at synapses. The conservation level of human
stoned B (called SALF) is rather low (<50% sequence similarity). Several short signatures along the proteins act in the
binding of AP2 subunits (for example, AP50 for StnB and αadaptin for StnA). The number and the positions of these
short signatures are not conserved in vertebrates and insects
(Additional data file 4). In addition to the binding of AP2 by
StnB, it binds to synaptotagmin 1 within the 300 amino acids
in the carboxyl-terminal in the fly and human homologs.
Stoned proteins may support synaptotagmin 1 recycling by
mediating the association with the AP2 complex. Based on
the MSA analysis, additional strongly conserved sequences

Sequence conservation among the subunits of the
exocyst complex
We tested whether the comparative genomics perspective is
informative in studying the evolution of physical and functional complexes in exocytosis and trafficking. To this end, we
tested the conservation levels for the various components of
the exocyst.

and the retrograde retrieval of recycling proteins from late to
early Golgi compartments. COP-1 is composed of 7 genes (α,
β, β ', γ, δ, ε, and ζ subunits, additional genes resulting from
duplication events, γ2 and ζ2) that are different in sequence
and length. For example, whereas COPA (human homolog of
α) is composed of 1,200 amino acid, COPZ (human homolog
of ζ) consists of only 200 amino acids. Figure 3a shows the
sequence identity of COP-1 components relative to human,
for all four insect representatives. As may be observed, in
eight of the nine genes the degree of conservation between
human and insects varies little across insect species. An
exception is COPE (εCOP-1), which, in addition to being the
least conserved in the fly and mosquito, exhibits a large variation in the levels of conservation among insects. The honeybee COPE is significantly more conserved than that of the fly,
mosquito or beetle homologs. We anticipate that COPE may
display a different pace of evolutionary change that may be a
result of its specific role in the COP-1 complex. Indeed, a role
for this component in stabilizing rather than in the assembly
of the COP-1 complex has been proposed [52].
The synapse is a compact structure with multiple organelles,
including transport vesicles, early and late endosomes, lysosomes, and peroxisomes. Indeed, many of the PS120 representatives function in vesicle trafficking and sorting. Snapin
(SNAPAP) is among the genes that are missing in some but
not all insects. Snapin was initially identified as a SNAP-25
binding protein and a regulator of the interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNAREs [53]. The relevance of snapin in
neurotransmitter release regulation was questioned [54], and
instead it was postulated to be part of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex (BLOC) [55,56]. We compared the conservation of the subunits of BLOC-1 in human
and insect (Figure 3b). The BLOC-1 complex is composed of
eight short proteins (12 to 15 kDa) that are rich in helical
structures. The composition of BLOCs is based on biochemical purifications and on localization studies [57], but the function of the individual subunits of BLOC-1 remains elusive.
A human homolog of snapin (SNAPAP; Table 1) is detected in
honeybee, fly, and mosquito, but cannot be detected in the
beetle genome (see Additional data files 2 and 3). BLOC1S2
and cappuccino are also missing in the beetle proteome,
whereas BLOC1S3 is missing in all insects (Figure 3b). A
detailed pair-wise interaction analysis showed that BLOC1S3
is peripheral and its interaction with other BLOC-1 subunits
is only through BLOC1S2 [57]. Another component of BLOC1 is dysbindin (DTNBP1). DTNBP1 is weakly conserved in
insects (identity 26% to 28% from human to fly and beetle),
and the fact that it is missing in both mosquitoes (Anopheles
and Aedes) indicates that this is probably not due to annotation mistakes (Figure 3b). Interestingly, defects in DTNBP1
and other BLOC-1 components are linked to severe pathologies in humans [58]. Our findings are consistent with the
notion that BLOC-1 is functional despite some missing com-

ponents and suggest that there is some level of redundancy
among BLOC-1 subunits in insects.

Coordination in sequence conservation in biogenesis
and trafficking protein complexes along the
phylogenetic tree
The analysis of BLOC-1, COP-1, and the exocyst complexes
(Figures 2 and 3) implies that the conservation levels for most
subunits are similar within each complex and functional
group. To test the generality of this observation along the evolutionary tree, we quantified the level of sequence identity in
proteins that function in trafficking complexes and organelle
biogenesis. The pair-wise sequence identity serves to reflect
the conservation index. We tested the following organisms
relative to human: mouse (Mus musculus), chicken (Gallus
gallus) bony fish (Zebrafish; Danio rerio), frog (Xenopus laevis) and fly (D. malanogaster). Figure 4 shows the conservation relative to human proteins (measured as the percentage
identity) for vesicle trafficking and organelle biogenesis complexes. We tested the presynaptic site protein complexes
(exocyst and COP-1) and organelle biogenesis sets (BLOC-1
and peroxin biogenesis [PEX] genes, which participate in peroxisome biogenesis) and complexes from the postsynaptic
site: the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), a complex
that serves as a link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle cells [59]; and the active signaling complex of the metabotropic glutamate receptor
(mGC), which includes glutamate receptors and their partners, such as cytoskeletal and post-translational modification
enzymes.
In general, for the four sets of presynaptic sites, all tested species maintain a conservation index in a rather tight range, in
which each complex exhibits a unique profile along the evolutionary tree. Specifically, the conservation of fly to human is
in accordance with a high degree of coordination among these
four complexes. The exocyst and COP-1 are the least diverged
whereas the organelle biogenesis complexes (PEX and BLOC1) exhibit a more active evolutionary divergence for at least
some of their components (Figure 4). Although the components of COP-1 and BLOC-1 physically interact, the PEXs
(peroxisome-related proteins) are a dynamic group of proteins with 14 gene products that function in executing the peroxisomal life cycle [60,61]. Each PEX protein is unique in
length, structure, and function. The evolutionary conservation pattern is preserved across the five species included in
this analysis, throughout the various components of the complexes. Presumably, the shared functions of the different
components lead to their co-evolution.
To explore whether the coordination within complexes and
functional groups along the evolutionary tree holds for other
physical or functional complexes, we examined the DGC [59]
and the active signaling complex of the mGC from the postsynaptic membrane [62]. Among the various proteins of these
postsynaptic complexes, each species exhibits a different level

Figure 4 (see previous among
Evolution conservationpage) components of synaptic complexes
Evolution conservation among components of synaptic complexes. Conservation is measured by sequence identity (y-axis [%]) between human and five
species: mouse (Mus musculus; dark blue), chicken (Gallus gallus; green) frog (Xenopus laevis; gray), zebrafish (Danio rerio; orange), and fly (Drosophila
melanogaster; light blue). Data are sorted according to human-fly conservation. The conservation of each component in the complexes is shown. Shown
are findings regarding the synaptic complexes that are associated with functional organization of the postsynaptic membrane: exocyst (EXOC; eight
proteins; see Figure 2a), coatomer protein (COP)-1 (nine proteins; see Figure 3a), biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex (BLOC)-1 (eight
proteins; Figure 2b); peroxisome biogenesis (PEX; 14 proteins); dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC; 11 proteins); and metabotropic glutamate
receptor (mGC; 12 proteins). Note that the conservation range for fly proteins of the DGC and mGC spreads on a broad range, and for these complexes
the conservation along the evolution tree is poorly coordinated.

of conservation relative to human. For example, DGC, the
frog DMD (dystrophin), and UTRN (utrophin) [63] are
almost identical to human, whereas SGCB and SGCD (β-sarcoglycan and δ-sarcoglycan) are poorly conserved. On the
other hand, in zebrafish utrophin is poorly conserved whereas
β-sarcoglycan and δ-sarcoglycan are more similar to human.
A similar uncoordinated profile for conservation was shown
for the mGC. We propose that for biogenesis, exocytosis, and
trafficking complexes of the presynaptic sites (but not for
postsynaptic signaling complexes), evolutionary constraints
have led to co-evolution of the components.

supported by evidence from the literature, experimental data,
and strong homology. Only high confidence interactions are
shown (see Materials and methods, below). These proteins
are as follows: VAMP8, a synaptic vesicle and exocytosis
related protein; neurexin-1 (NRXN1), which acts in synaptogenesis and in the pre-post synaptic junctions; synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1) and dynamin 1 (DNM1), which are
endocytotic proteins that function in synaptic vesicle recovery
and in clathrin-based endocytosis, respectively; and Rim-1
(RIMS) and Cast (ERC2), which are two active zone
organizers.

Presynaptic proteins participate in interconnected
protein interaction graphs

The protein valence (defined as the number of direct edges
from the vertex representing the protein) ranges from seven
for ERC2 to 23 for DNM1. The graphs of RIMS, ERC2, and
NRXN1 have relatively low connectivity. Specifically, in the
NRXN1 graph there are only 14 edges, and for RIMS (with a
valence of 15) just 29 connecting edges are observed. The density of the different graphs and their network conservation
scores are marked (Figure 6). Note that for some of the interacting proteins no insect homologs are known (marked by a
yellow circle; Figure 6). The low connectivity graphs are characteristic for additional proteins of the active zone and for
some master regulators such as RAB3A (Figure 5) and LIN7A
(Additional data file 6). DMN1, which is one of the central
proteins of endocytosis, exhibits a mixed property in the protein interaction graph. Most edges are of low connectivity, but
about one-third of the edges are highly connected. DMN1 and
SYNJ1 valence is rather high (23 and 20, respectively) with
only an intermediate network conservation score of 0.42 and
0.43, respectively. Note that for exocytosis proteins (namely
VAMP2 and VAMP8), both the network conservation score
and the density values are higher (Figures 5 and 6).

Sequential protein interactions are fundamental to the lifecycle of the synaptic vesicle and to trafficking and organelle biogenesis in synapses. This leads to proteins that are engaged in
multiple protein interactions. For example, more than 60
different interactions have been reported for syntaxin 1 and
tens of interactions for synaptotagmin. Although some findings may result from spurious interactions, many have been
experimentally confirmed and others are yet to be discovered.
We illustrate this via VAMP2 as a prototype for an extremely
conserved protein from human to insects. Figure 5 shows a
graph centered on human VAMP2 along with 20 of its highfidelity interacting proteins. Nineteen of these (excluding
only synaptophysin) are conserved in all insects, and conservation for most of them (18/19) is very high (network conservation is 0.86). Another extreme case is that of the Rab3A
protein (Figure 5b). Although the valence of Rab3A is very
high (19), the properties of the two graphs are substantially
different (Figure 5). Few Rab3A partners are missing in all
insects and additional ones are missing in some insects, leading to a low conservation (network conservation 0.3).
The fraction of connecting edges in the graph relative to the
maximal possible edges is a measure of the connectivity
among interacting proteins. Density values for the interacting
proteins of VAMP2 and RAB3A are 16.8% and 6.4%, respectively. Figure 5 illustrates proteins of the presynaptic apparatus that differ substantially in their valence, network
conservation score, and density value.
We illustrate the properties of protein-protein interaction
graphs for several representative proteins from the PS120 set
(Figure 6; gene names are according to official symbols; see
Additional data file 2). The protein interaction networks are

The interaction graphs for VAMP2 (Figure 5), VAMP8 (Figure 6), α-SNAP (SNAPA) and synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1; Additional data file 6), syntaxin 1 (STX1), and SNAP25 (not
shown) are characterized by relatively high conservation and
by high density values. The properties of the graphs for DNM1
and SYNJ1 are valid for numerous endocytotic proteins,
including AP2A (Additional data file 6), clathrin, and
amphiphysin (not shown).

Valence of proteins in the interaction graphs and
sequence conservation levels are positively correlated
Almost all proteins in the PS120 gene list are engaged in multiple protein interactions (Additional data file 2). Interactions

between proteins in the synapse occur throughout the processes of endocytosis, membrane fusion, protein recruitment,
transport of vesicles, and organelle biogenesis. We tested
whether conservation (as reflected by percentage sequence
identity from insects to human) and the valence of all proteins
are correlated. We considered only interactions with high
confidence (see Materials and methods, below) and tested the
two quantitative measures. Figure 7a shows the sequence
similarity of all PS120 proteins as a function of the valence of
human proteins. It is evident that the two quantities are positively correlated. Among the PS120 proteins, some exhibit
extremely high numbers of interacting proteins (up to 50), as
evident for signal transduction proteins, whereas others have
no interacting partners. The latter could also be due to lack of
current knowledge. Detailed information on PS120 protein
conservation and valence is available in Additional data file 7.
Note that correlation between conservation and protein
valence is strongly associated with sequences that share
greater than 50% identity (Figure 7). The positive correlation
between conservation and protein valence is based on the full
PS120 list. A similar analysis of components of functional
complexes in trafficking (COP-1 and PEX; Figure 7b) is in
accordance with the overall trend observed for PS120. (Note
that these additional 25 proteins of COP-1 and PEX are not
included in PS120.) We conclude that despite a relatively narrow range of sequence conservation among the components
of each complex (Figures 2 and 3), a greater conservation
score between insect and human is correlated with higher
valence.
The next question that was addressed is whether the subsets
of proteins that function primarily in endocytosis and in exocytosis exhibit different properties of sequence conservation
and protein valence. To this end, we compiled two nonoverlapping subsets for endocytosis and exocytosis (24 proteins
each; see Materials and methods, below). These two lists
excluded proteins that are bona fide participants of both
processes (for instance, DOC2, UNC13, PSCD1, and RIMS) or
are connected to cytoskeleton modulation (such as ADD2,
bassoon, CADPS, DLG1, KIF1A, and MYRIP). In the set of
exocytotic and endocytotic proteins, the average protein
valences are 10 and 7.9, respectively (P value for being identical = 0.423; Additional data file 8). However, for the

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R27

Yanay et al. R27.15

exocytotic set the average valence for proteins with low conservation (<50% sequence identity) is 4.5, and 13.9 for those
that share greater than 50% sequence identity. This result is
significant (P = 0.034). In the endocytotic set, the valences of
low and highly conserved proteins (<50% and >50% identity)
were not significantly different (P = 0.605) and measured to
be 7.2 and 8.6, respectively (Additional data file 7).

Endocytotic proteins are long and composed of several
repeated domains
We observed that the protein interaction graphs differ substantially with regard to their properties between essential
proteins of the exocytotic and endocytotic sets (Additional
data file 8). Specifically, several of the endocytotic proteins
interact with proteins that are less conserved between insects
and human (Figure 6). We tested the underlying molecular
architecture of exocytotic and endocytotic proteins. Figure 8
shows a set of 15 proteins from each of the exocytotic and
endocytotic sets. On average the endocytotic proteins are
longer: 850 and 340 amino acids for the endocytotic and exocytotic proteins, respectively.
Additional features that were tested include the fraction of
low complexity and coiled coil regions. It was shown that in
both protein sets approximately 10% of the sequences are
occupied by low complexity regions. However, coiled coil
domains are detected mostly in endocytotic proteins. The
most obvious difference is in the architecture of the exocytotic
and endocytotic proteins, in that most endocytotic proteins
are multi-domain proteins, some of them repeating several
times within a protein and across the protein set. Examples
are clathrin (CLTC; clathrin domains repeat seven times) and
intersectin (ITSN2; with multiple SH3 domains). (For
consistency, we applied the domain assignment according to
Pfam [64].) Such features are rare among the exocytotic protein set (Figure 8). Some highly represented domains in the
endocytotic protein set are short (Figure 8). These domains
coordinate interactions with either short signatures (SH3),
lipid moieties (PX and PH), or signaling ions (EF-hand).
These are abundant domains that appear thousands of times
in the animal kingdom and are used in a variety of cellular
contexts, including outside the synapse.

Presynaptic proteins participate in interconnected protein-protein graphs
Presynaptic proteins participate in interconnected protein-protein graphs. The protein-interacting graphs are extracted from STRING tool and supported
by the literature, experimental data, and strong homology inference. Only high confidence interactions are shown (see Materials and methods). The
central protein in each graph (marked with a red frame) is a representative for (a) synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1; a key signaling protein in endocytosis), (b)
NRXN1 (in presynaptic membrane interaction and synaptogenesis), (c) ERC2 (an active zone organizer), (d) RIMS (a genuine component of the active
zone), and (e) vehicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)8 (a component of the exocytosis). Protein names are according to the official gene symbols
(as in Table 1 and Additional data file 2). Protein valences (the number of direct edges from the vertex) are marked in parenthesis. Note that the graphs
for RIMS, ERC2, and NRXN1 are of a relatively low connectivity. Protein vertices are colored according to the conservation index; proteins with a
sequence similarity above 65% relative to a human homolog are framed in black, otherwise they are marked in light blue. Proteins that were missing in one
or more of the insect representatives are framed in orange. Proteins that do not have insect homologs (as in Table 1 and Additional data file 2) are marked
by a yellow circle. A quantitative measure for the density of protein-protein interactions in the graph is added as well as the network conservation score
(Con).

The abundance of short domains with a broad specificity is
rare in the exocytotic context. The domains marked as vSNARE and t-SNARE, Synaptobrevin and Sec1 (Figure 8) are
engaged in protein-protein interactions. Specificity is often
achieved through elongated interfaces in helical regions [65].
An exception is the C2 domain, which appears in synaptotagmin. Although synaptotagmin is a genuine protein of exocytosis, it has some resemblance in its architecture to endocytotic
proteins. Specifically, the C2 domain is broadly used in signaling proteins that are regulated by calcium in a context of
membrane interactions. Many C2-containing proteins in the
synapse are actually linkers of exocytosis and endocytosis
[66], including BAIAP3, SYTL4, RIMS, and MUNC13
(Additional data file 2 [part b]). Roles of synaptotagmin and
synaptotagmin-like proteins as linkers between exocytosis
and endocytosis [46] and the cytoskeleton [67] have been
proposed.

Discussion

Comparative analysis of insect genomes focuses on evolutionary events on a scale of hundreds of millions of years. The
numerous fly-related genomes (as in the case of Drosophila
pseudoobscura) provide a snapshot of the evolutionary processes that occurred over tens of millions of years [3]. In this
study we show that the rich source of data from insect proteomes is instrumental in deriving insights into the design
principles of presynaptic function. It is demonstrated that
comparative proteome analysis of insects to mammals provides new information on individual proteins (Figure 1); coevolution of protein complexes that are involved in trafficking
and organelle biogenesis (Figures 2 to 4), and the evolutionary constraints on proteins that are engaged in multiple interactions (Figures 5 to 7). This analysis takes advantage of the
rich cellular and molecular data in the context of the CNS [68]
from model organisms such as the worm, fly, and mouse
[69,70].

Membranous synaptic vesicle protein composition
from human and insects is different
Mammalian synaptic vesicles were characterized by three
major proteins [71]: SV2, synaptotagmin, and synaptophysin.
Many of the synaptic vesicle membranous proteins appeared
to be regulators of SNAREs and thus control neurotransmitter release. Examples are the transporter-like SV2, which
controls synaptoagmin 1 [72], and synaptophysin, which
controls VAMP-2 [73]. Based on a recent study on the composition of a generic mammalian synaptic vesicle [18], it was calculated that VAMP2 and synaptophysin are at a 2:1 molar
ratio and both are the most abundant proteins of the synaptic
vesicle membrane. In synaptophysin knockout mice, no
changes in synapse function and brain morphology have been
detected, but VAMP2 concentration on the synaptic vesicle
membrane was shown to be markedly altered [74]. Along this
line, the absence of synaptophysin gene in insects is intriguing (Table 1). Synaptophysin is part of a small family of four-

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R27

Yanay et al. R27.18

transmembrane proteins that includs synaptogyrin, pantophysin, and synaptoporin, all of which are missing in insects.
A genomic search revealed a weak similarity to synaptogyrin
in honeybee supported by a transcript (XR_015081.1; hypothetical LOC552402 having mRNA of 704 nucleotides) and a
weak homology in beetle for Synaptoporin (XM_967892.1;
similar to synaptoporin, LOC661749). Despite its abundance
in mammalian synaptic vesicles, Synaptophysin and the other
members of the four-transmembrane protein set must be dispensable for the functionality of synaptic vesicles. This is in
agreement with the findings of a recent study on C. elegans
[75], in which complete removal of the synaptophysin gene
family
resulted
in
normal
synaptic
properties,
synaptogenesis, and neuronal architecture. It is plausible that
in insects VAMP accessibility is regulated by an alternative
regulator. The extension of VAMP's luminal domain in
insects is consistent with the possibility that such a domain is
used for regulation (Figure 1). Candidates for insect synaptic
vesicle proteins that face the lumen are synaptotagmin and
SV2.
Synaptotagmin (Syt), the calcium sensor for neurotransmitter release in synapses, functions in the coupling of synaptic
vesicle fusion to recycling. In mammals, synaptotagmin
belongs to a large gene family of 16 genes. Among them, synaptotagmins 1 and 2 are exclusively functional in the synaptic
vesicle lifecycle. In the fly genome, there are six representatives (close homologs of Syt1, Syt4, Syt5, Syt7, Syt9, and
Syt12), four in mosquito (A. aegypti and A. gambiae), and
four in the honeybee (close homologs of mammalian Syt1,
Syt4, Syt5, and Syt7). Interestingly, several synaptotagminlike proteins and alternatively spliced transcripts are detected
in the fly. Among these are close homologs of Syt1 (CG3139,
isoform D) and Syt7 (CG2381, isoform F); both variants lack
the amino-terminal domain, including the transmembrane.
These variants, although soluble, fully maintain their potential to bind endogenous synaptic regulators and to act as calcium sensors.
Although insects have only six genes, as opposed to 17 synaptotagmin genes in human, this is not the case for SV2, which
is a transporter-like gene family of the synaptic vesicle membrane [76,77] that was implicated in modulating synaptotogmin [72]. The SV2 family is actually expanded in insects. At
least three genes and three variants are evident in each of the
insect representatives, suggesting the importance of multiple
genes (Additional data file 9). Many expressed sequence tags
and mRNA for SV2 homologs were detected from the fly head
(not shown). This apparent high expression supports the
notion that regulation of synaptotagmin might be executed by
the rich collection of SV2 gene products. It is not known
whether the different SV2 variants are all expressed in the
same synaptic vesicle or whether they describe several subtypes. In general, the sequences of the variants and genes
among insects are quite divergent. The expansion of the SV2
family in insects is shown in Additional data file 9.

Among the proteins that are missing in some of the tested
insects is the Rab3 and its regulators. Rab function is controlled by a large group of regulators that affect interaction with
the cytoskeleton, activation and inactivation of the GTP state,
interaction with the membrane, and more [78]. For example,
RAB3IL1, which is the GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) for Rab3A, is missing in both flies and mosquitoes, but a
close homolog is found in honeybee and beetle genomes.
RAB3IL1 associates with inositol 6-phosphate kinase and
provides another tier of Rab3 regulation in synaptic vesicle
exocytosis. On the other hand, Rab3 GTPase-activating protein (Rab3GAP), which is responsible for switching between
the active and inactive form [79,80], is missing from the honeybee genome. There is support for the indispensability of
RAB3GAP in mammalian synapses in the literature; a mutation in the gene causes a severe brain developmental defect
[81].
Surprisingly, many of the genes that are missing in one or
more of the insects are linked to Rab3 regulation (Figure 5).
We postulate that once some regulators are lost or impaired
in their function, no positive selection is imposed on the other
regulators. The result might be a rapid divergence beyond the
level of detection by sequence similarity.

Comparative genomics perspective on functional
complexes
Comparative genomics approaches are powerful tools for
gaining insights into evolution [82]. We suggest that these
approaches be expanded to investigate functional groups and
protein complexes (Figures 2 and 3). Some functional complexes bear more constraints than others (Figure 4). For
example, in the fly exocyst components are within the 20% to
40% conservation index, and for COP-1 the range is from 40%
to 80%. In these two complexes, the frog and zebrafish maintain about 80% conservation index throughout and thus are
less informative. On the other hand, inspecting the conservation index of BLOCS1S3 shows that in all tested organisms
(mouse, chicken, frog, zebrafish, and fly) it is the most
diverged relative to the other components, and thus its specialized role in the BLOC-1 can be postulated.
We showed that within the COP-1 complex, only the ε-COP in
insects exhibits a specialized evolutionary profile (Figure 3).
This is in accordance with the observation from the mammalian COP-1 assembly [83]. It was demonstrated that ε-COP is
the last subunit to be added during the assembly, and consequently the assembly of any other component is not dependent on its presence. Furthermore, in yeast ε-COP (called
Sec28p) is shown to interact with α-COP genes. Unlike other
COP genes, however, it is nonessential for cell viability. It was
proposed that ε-COP is not necessary for the in vivo assembly
of COP-1 coatomer but for stabilizing α-COP [52].
The co-evolution in components of the same complex is not a
general trend in the synapse. The DGC is part of the overall

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R27

Yanay et al. R27.20

architecture of the nerve-muscle postsynaptic site. Indeed,
the DGC in the skeletal muscle membranes shows that the
components evolve in an uncoordinated mode across individual species. More than ten proteins strongly interact to form
the DGC functional complex. The importance of this complex
in mammals is evident because mutations in many of the
genes account for the pathologies of muscular dystrophies
[59,84]. There are numerous complexes of the postsynaptic
sites that in the CNS are localized to the PSD. These complexes show a similar trend to DGC, including mGC (Figure
4), the NMDA-MaGuk-associated (NRC/MASC) and the
AMPA receptor (ARC) complexes [62] (not shown). We
attribute this to the functional composition of the PSD complexes. The individual components are a combination of
cytoskeleton, scaffolding, signaling enzymes, receptors, channels, and adaptor proteins. The assembly of such complexes
is a result of the multiple PDZ and a few adaptors [85]. We
attribute the evolutionary differences in coordination (Figure
4) in the presynaptic and PSD complexes to the fact that the
latter include a plethora of components, many of which are
not exclusive to the synapse. We argue that a careful comparative analysis of functional complexes identified distinctive
design principles for the complex in trafficking and biogenesis versus postsynaptic complexes. The architectural properties of the PSD resemble adhesion molecules and their
evolutionary constraints [86].

Architectural design principles in exocytosis and
endocytosis
The PS120 represents the core of the presynaptic gene list.
The two subsets could (somewhat artificially) be divided into
the exocytotic and endocytotic proteins. It is clear that the two
processes are tightly connected in time and space [23,87].
Nevertheless, fundamental differences could be assigned to
each of the subsets in terms of protein length, conservation
level and protein valence, abundance of coiled coil regions,
membranous interactions, and so on. We argue that most of
these features underlie the design principles for the functional distinction between these two processes.
Based on protein-protein interaction graphs, a positive correlation between the presynaptic protein conservation score
and their valence was demonstrated (Figure 7). Although the
average protein valence is high (7.9 to 10 interacting proteins
on average), it is not significantly different for the set of exocytotic and endocytotic proteins. The trend seen in Figure 7 is
reflected mostly by the exocytotic but not the endocytotic proteins (Additional data files 7 and 8).
In the animal kingdom, the exocytic event is rapid (ranging
from milliseconds to seconds), accurate, and triggered by a
combination of depolarization and calcium signals that lead
to synaptic vesicle fusion. On the other hand, the endocytotic
machinery is slower and more diverged. For example, after a
massive synaptic vesicle exocytosis from the Torpedo electric
organ, the synaptic vesicles are recovered within 18 hours

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R27

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/2/R27

Genome Biology 2008,

[88], and after repeated stimuli in the mouse brain the
replenishment of synaptic vesicle pools is completed within
10 to 20 minutes and the recovery of a single synaptic vesicle
is over within a few seconds [89]. We suggest that the modes
for synaptic vesicle recovery are subject to large variations,
and in evolutionary terms the high connectivity for the
involved proteins has remained despite substantial sequence
divergence. This observation is not restricted to insect endocytotic proteins. A recent study on the properties of endocytotic proteins [90] indicated that the high connectivity in
protein-protein interaction reflects the spatial and temporal
constraints of the process. Furthermore, endocytosis is not
restricted to presynaptic function and the proteins often act
in many cellular contexts, often by interacting with nonsynaptic protein partners.
Many of the endocytotic proteins have pleiotropic functions
that are of varying importance in different species. This property differs from most exocytotic proteins. For example, in the
mouse, amphiphysin (AMPH; Figure 8) regulates but it is not
essential for synaptic vesicle recycling. In the fly,
amphiphysin is responsible for the organization and structure
of the muscle postsynaptic membrane and is not involved in
synaptic vesicle recycling [91]. Thus, even amphiphysin,
which is one of the hallmarks of the synaptic vesicle recycling
apparatus, appears to be replaceable and prone to rapid
changes in its sequence. We assume that this pleiotropicity
functions in the endocytotic set of proteins (also applied to
PSD proteins and adhesion proteins; not shown), underlying
their relatively rapid evolution.
In addition to the protein valence and conservation argument, the protein structure and domain composition of endocytotic and exocytotic proteins are substantially different
(Figure 8). What are the principles that led to the substantial
difference in the exocytotic and endocytotic proteins that is
maintained throughout the evolutionary tree? The abundance of repeated domains in endocytotic proteins (Figure 8)
underlies the need to recruit multiple partners in parallel and
to create a physical mesh of proteins. A partition of endocytotic proteins by the properties of their interaction graphs was
presented [90]. Because numerous proteins and interacting
domains were structurally resolved within the context of exocytotic [92] and endocytotic proteins, we currently seek a
framework that combines analytical measurements of synaptic protein evolution and their structural features.
On a functional rather than structural level, the processes of
endocytosis and exocytosis rely on multiple preparatory steps
[23]. We attribute the difference between the processes
mainly to these steps. In exocytosis, a sequential exchange of
protein-protein interactions leads to priming and SNARE
complex formation [19]. During the preparatory steps for
endocytosis, an intimate interaction with the lipid properties
must occur. The properties that are needed for recognizing
lipids dominate the domain architecture of most endocytotic

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R27

Yanay et al. R27.21

proteins. These proteins include the adaptors, sensors for
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, domains that induce
membrane curvature and others (for details, see Additional
data file 2). Among the domains that are enriched in endocytotic proteins (Figure 8 and Additional data file 8) are PX and
PH, which bind phosphoinositides with different specificity;
SH3, which binds to a short proline-rich signature; ENTH
(epsin amino-terminal homology) domain, which forms a
binding pocket for inositol triphosphate ligand; and BAR
(Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domain, which participates in membrane curvature; among others. Most exocytotic domains
such as v-SNARE and t-SNARE still bind to different partners, but the binding is different in that it is sequential and
exclusive, and it covers a large extended protein-protein
interface segment [65]. An extreme example is the four-helix
buddle SNARE complex [93].
Many of the exocytotic proteins but not the endocytotic proteins contain one or more TMDs (Additional data file 8). This
leads to two important outcomes for the exocytotic proteins:
the location of membranous proteins to the appropriate site
in the synapse is already dictated through the secretory pathway by the sorting machinery; and most of these proteins
carry post-translational modifications that were acquired
during their maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi. Exceptions are proteins such as Rab3A and SNAP-25
that, although lacking a TMD, are modified to ensure their
covalent membrane association. Clearly, in cases in which a
modification is associated with a protein function, this leads
to additional evolutionary constraints on the modification
sites. For example, synaptotagmin undergoes both N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation. The N-glycosylation was shown
to be essential for redirecting synaptotagmin to the synaptic
vesicle membranes [94], whereas the O-glycosylation is
enhanced and triggered by VAMP-dependent interaction.
Indeed, for synaptotagmin both sites are fully conserved
along a broad evolutionary distance [67]. At present, experimental data on the functional importance of conservation of
post-translational modifications from insect to human and
along the evolutionary tree are lacking for large number of
presynaptic proteins.
Several endocytotic proteins (but notably not the exocytotic
proteins) include regions that are defined as coiled-coil
domains (Additional data file 2 [part b]). Surprisingly, many
of the architectural principles of endocytotic proteins are
shared with the complexes of the PSD. This unified principle
ensures multiple and rich connections to the cytoskeleton (in
the case of PSD) and the lipids (in the case of endocytosis). As
a result of their structural architecture, the PSD core proteins
are subjected to rapid divergence, leading to a faded signal in
the sequences from human to insects. We propose that this
same principle is valid for the lack of bassoon and piccolo in
insects genomes.

Conclusion

Analysis of key presynaptic proteins from numerous insect
proteomes yields insights into evolutionary processes that
occurred more than 350 million years ago. We demonstrated
how an approach based on comparative genomics reveals
erroneous and missing annotations. This methodology also
reveals instances of gene gain and loss in insect genomes. We
conclude that strong evolutionary constraints have led to the
co-evolution of protein complexes that are involved in trafficking and organelle biogenesis. Furthermore, presynaptic
proteins that participate in multiple protein interactions in
exocytosis exhibit high sequence conservation. The analogous
statement does not apply, however, to endocytosis. Finally,
we discuss the relationship between connectivity and
sequence conservation in these two protein sets. We explain
these differences in terms of the particular architectural
design of these proteins, which is adapted for specific phases
in the synaptic vesicle's lifecycle.

Materials and methods
Compiling the presynaptic PS120 collection
The list of proteins known as PS120 is a compilation of human
genes that are related to the function of the synaptic vesicle
life cycle. The proteins are indexed by their human official
gene symbol. The conversion of the official gene symbol to
protein accessions (from UniProt or National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] protein collection) is performed using Protein Information Resource retrieval system
[95]. This protein list provides a partial but overlapping union
of collections from several resources: Mass spectrometry
(MS) proteomics analysis from biochemical purified synaptic
vesicles [18]; biochemical and genetic studies and literature
[9,96]; SynDB collection, which includes synaptic process
genes and their orthologs in multiple species, including
human and fruit fly [97]; GO assignments [26] for the terms
'asymmetric synapse', 'exocytosis', 'synaptic vesicle', 'endocytosis', 'pre-synapse'; and the presynaptic gene index of mammalian genes [27]. The list was compiled manually to avoid
redundancy.
The PS120 is an apparently complete collection of representatives of proteins that participate in vesicle trafficking, synaptic vesicle lifecycle, and presynaptic organization. Note that
the 150 set of presynaptic genes accounts for 45 genes that are
included in our PS120, but the additional 75 proteins were not
represented in the report by Hadley and coworkers [27]. For
example, there the 17 synaptotagmins and 15 syntaxins [27]
that are represented by three synaptotagmins (synaptotagmin 1, 5, and 9) and one syntaxin (syntaxin 1A) in the PS120.
From the approximately 60 Rab proteins known in human,
only a small number of representatives that are directly
involved in synaptic vesicle function is listed (Rab27 and
Rab3). In addition, protein variants are not listed; for
instance, only Rab3A (but not Rab3B, Rab3C, and Rab3D) is
listed. We excluded proteins that function in signal

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R27

transduction, including kinases and phosphatases. Specifically, the ten calcium calmodulin protein kinases that are
included in the 150 gene collection [27] are excluded. We also
excluded proteins that function in cell adhesion [98,99]; synapse maintenance and development, including growth factors
and extracellular matrix; presynaptic channels and G-protein-coupled receptors [100]; and neurotransmitter transporters and multiple uptake mechanisms [101].

Identifying orthologs in insects
Orthologs for each of the human PS120 list with insects were
defined by the top reciprocal hit using BLAST2 [102]. BLAST
searches were restricted to the nonredundant insect database
from NCBI [103] and to the UniProt protein database [104].
The insect representatives that were used throughout are the
fruit fly D. melanogaster, the honey bee (A. mellifera), red
flour beetle (T. castaneum), and one of the two mosquitoes
(A. gambiae and A. aegypti). The identification was compared with the preprocessed list of Ensembl database [105].
Detecting homologs in a genomic scale followed the procedure described in the ProtoBee database [106], in which
annotations are assigned through hierarchical classification.
Sporadic poor alignments and large deviation in protein
length were used as evidence of false homology assignments.
In instances in which an orthologous relation could not be
validated, a direct search in Genome Sequences Centers and
in specialized insect database was performed. The tBLASTn
[103] was applied using a protein sequence against the
translated nucleotide database in all six frames. Top hits were
manually tested to separate spurious similarity for missed
annotated genes. We applied the following to detect remote
homologs and to resolve borderline similarity level: VectorBase, which focuses on A. gambiae, A. aegypti, Ixodes scapularis, Culex pipiens, and Pediculus humanus [107]; FlyBase,
which focuses on a comparative view for a dozen Drosophila
species. [108]; Baylor Genome Center (for Honeybee and
Beetle genomes) and other genome centers (see list in Additional data file 1); and position-specific iterative BLAST [102].
The percentage identity and similarity were used as comparative measures. Conservation score was determined based on
the fraction of proteins in the graph with at least 65%
sequence identity between a human protein and its closest
insect protein, and the total numbers of proteins in the graph.
BLAST identity and similarity levels were recorded and both
measures are strongly correlated (R2 = 0.9315). For simplicity
we used the identity measure (expressed as a percentage)
unless stated otherwise. ClustalW [109] was used to produce
MSAs. ClustalW MSA was used for neighbor-joining phylogeny reconstruction.

Protein-protein interaction graphs
Networks of protein-protein interactions are based on the
STRING web tool [110]. The database of STRING unifies most
types of protein-protein associations, including direct and
indirect associations. Most high quality experimental data

covers model organisms. In some instances inference of
known interactions from model organisms to other species
based on orthology of the respective protein was considered.
The numerical confidence score used was >0.9. The score was
based on homology, experimental data, and text mining. The
high confidence (>0.9) ensured that many of the interacting
partners were supported by independent evidence types. We
used a threshold for up to 50 interacting proteins and a score
of >0.9 throughout. The maximal number of interacting was
limited to 50 (only for calmodulin and 14-3-3 was this
number below the reported interactions).
Density value was calculated from the ratio of the high-quality edges in a graph (following removal of the central protein
and its direct edges) and the maximal edges possible. In a
graph with n vertices, the maximal number of edges is n (n 1)/2.

Functional assignments
The nonoverlapping sets of endocytosis and endocytosis sets
(24 proteins each) are based on GO annotations [26] and
assignments in SynDB [97]. Because coverage of GO annotations for the PS120 is limited, we added proteins from the
manual assignment of SynDB [97]. The endocytotic set is
mostly based on 'endocytosis' and 'recycling', and for the exocytotic set we merged 'trafficking' and 'exocytosis'. We deleted
proteins that are genuine linkers of the two processes from
these lists.
Statistical significance (P value) of the properties of nonoverlapping sets of endocytosis and endocytosis sets was calculated by a standard Student's t-test, with the null hypothesis
that the means of two independent sets are equal.

Additional data files

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this paper. Additional data file 1 lists the proteomes
from multiple insect species and their evolutionary relatedness. Additional data file 2 lists the set of 120 presynaptic
protein prototypes in human relative to their insect
homologs. Part a provides a detailed information on gene
names, synonyms, major partner proteins, and conservation
levels from human to insect homologs. Part b is a complementary table based on the UniProtKB database [104].
Additional data file 3 lists the 44 genes that had no clear
homologs in certain insects. Additional data file 4 is a ClustalW based MSA of stoned B and SCAMP. Additional data file
5 is a ClustalW-based MSA of the SNARE syntaxin 1 and synapsin. Additional data file 6 shows representative graphs of
interactions for six proteins, based on the STRING tool [110].
Additional data file 7 provides a detailed table of the PS120
gene set, including the level of sequence identity and similarity (as a percentage between human and insects), and the protein valence according to the STRING tool. Additional data
file 8 presents a detailed table of gene functions in
endocytosis and exocytosis (24 genes each). Additional data
file 9 is the ClustalW-based MSA of the family of SV2 in
insects and a tree-like representation based on distances from

Sequence features and domains
Pfam (version 22, 9300 protein families) [64] was used for
domain assignment. TMHMM2 was used to predict the location and topology of transmembrane helices [111]. Coiled coils
are detected using the method of COILS [112]. Low complexity regions are predicted using the SEG program and activated by the ProteinPredict meta-server [113].
