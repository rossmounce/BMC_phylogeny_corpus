Abstract
Background: ChIP-chip data, which indicate binding of transcription factors (TFs) to DNA regions
in vivo, are widely used to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks. However, the binding
of a TF to a gene does not necessarily imply regulation. Thus, it is important to develop methods
to identify regulatory targets of TFs from ChIP-chip data.
Results: We developed a method, called Temporal Relationship Identification Algorithm (TRIA),
which uses gene expression data to identify a TF's regulatory targets among its binding targets
inferred from ChIP-chip data. We applied TRIA to yeast cell cycle microarray data and identified
many plausible regulatory targets of cell cycle TFs. We validated our predictions by checking the
enrichments for functional annotation and known cell cycle genes. Moreover, we showed that TRIA
performs better than two published methods (MA-Network and MFA). It is known that coregulated genes may not be co-expressed. TRIA has the ability to identify subsets of highly coexpressed genes among the regulatory targets of a TF. Different functional roles are found for
different subsets, indicating the diverse functions a TF could have. Finally, for a control, we showed
that TRIA also performs well for cell-cycle irrelevant TFs.
Conclusion: Finding the regulatory targets of TFs is important for understanding how cells change
their transcription program to adapt to environmental stimuli. Our algorithm TRIA is helpful for
achieving this purpose.

Background
By organizing the genes in a genome into transcriptional
regulatory modules (TRMs), a living cell can coordinate
the activities of many genes and carry out complex functions. Therefore, identifying TRMs is useful for understanding cellular responses to internal and external
signals. Advances in high-throughput tools such as DNA
microarray [1,2] and chromatin immunoprecipitation-

chip (ChIP-chip) [3,4] have made the computational
reconstruction of TRMs of a eukaryotic cell possible.
Genome-wide gene expression analysis has been used to
investigate TRMs controlling a variety of cellular processes
in yeast [5-9]. Clustering and motif-discovering algorithms have been applied to gene expression data to find
sets of co-regulated genes and have identified plausible
binding motifs of their TFs [7,10,11]. Such approaches

have also been expanded to incorporate existing knowledge about the genes, such as cellular functions [12] or
promoter sequence motifs [13]. Moreover, some researchers used model-based approaches such as random
Boolean networks [14] and Bayesian networks [15,16] to
infer regulatory network architectures. However, this
approach provides only indirect evidence of genetic regulatory interactions and does not identify the relevant TFs.
On the other hand, the ChIP-chip technique was developed to identify physical interactions between TFs and
DNA regions. Using ChIP-chip data, Simon et al. [17]
investigated how the yeast cell-cycle gene-expression program is regulated by each of nine major transcriptional
activators. Lee et al. [18] constructed a network of TF-gene
interactions and Harbison et al. [19] constructed an initial
map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code. However, a
weakness in the ChIP-chip technique is that the binding
of a TF to a gene does not necessarily imply regulation. A
TF may bind to a gene but has no regulatory effect on that
gene's expression. Even if a TF does regulate a specific
gene, the ChIP-chip data alone does not tell whether the
regulation is activation or repression. Hence, additional
information is required to solve this ambiguity inherent
in ChIP-chip data.
To overcome this problem, several algorithms have been
developed to combine gene expression and ChIP-chip
data to infer the regulatory targets of a TF. For instance,
NCA [20] and MA-Network [21] both use multivariate
regression analysis and MFA [22] uses modified factor
analysis of gene expression data to classify a TF's binding
targets inferred from ChIP-chip data into regulatory and
non-regulatory targets. In this paper, we use a different
approach to explore the different biological possibilities
for the same phenomenon. We develop a method, called
Temporal Relationship Identification Algorithm (TRIA),
which uses time-lagged correlation analysis between a TF
and its binding targets to identify its regulatory targets.
Our rationale is that a TF has a high time-lagged correlation with its regulatory targets, but has a low time-lagged
correlation with its binding but non-regulatory targets.
Time-lagged correlation analysis has the ability to infer
causality and directional relationships between genes
[23,24]. It has also been used to reconstruct the reaction
network of central carbon metabolism [25] and the gene
interaction networks of Synechocystis sp [26]. Therefore,
time-lagged correlation analysis has the potential to be
used to identify a TF's regulatory targets from its binding
targets which may or may not be regulated by the TF.

Results
Identification of the plausible regulatory targets of a TF
Two previous papers [18,19] used a statistical error model
to assign a p-value to the binding relationship of a TF-gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/188

pair. They found that if p-value ≤ 0.001, the binding relationship of a TF-gene pair is of high confidence and can
usually be confirmed by gene-specific PCR. Therefore, we
include a gene in the set B+ if the TF-gene binding p-value
in the ChIP-chip data is ≤ 0.001, i.e. B+ consists of genes
that are significantly bound by a TF. Further, a gene in B+
is assigned into B+R+ if it has a temporal relationship with
the TF but into B+R- otherwise. A TF-gene pair is said to
have a temporal relationship if the gene's expression profile is significantly correlated with the TF's regulatory profile possibly with time lags (see Methods). Our hypothesis
is that the genes in B+R+ are more likely to be the regulatory targets of a TF than are the genes in B+R-. TRIA is
developed to classify B+ into B+R+ and B+R-.
Only a subset of the binding targets are plausible
regulatory targets of a TF
We considered nine cell cycle TFs that have both sizes of
B+R+ and B+R- ≥ 25 (i.e. at least 25 genes in each group).
The number of genes in each group (B+R+ and B+R-) is
listed in Table 1. On average, 55% of significantly bound
genes are identified as the plausible regulatory targets of a
TF, similar to the result (58%) of [21], and 64% of the
inferred regulatory targets have expression profiles that
are positively correlated with the TF's regulatory profile
possibly with time lags. Moreover, only 16% of the
inferred regulatory targets and the TF are co-expressed (i.e.
identified time lag = 0). That is, 84% of the inferred regulatory targets may not be found if we use the conventional
correlation analysis that can only check whether a TF-gene
pair are co-expressed or not (see Additional file 1 for
details). The following analyses were performed to validate our method.

Table 1: Classification of the binding targets of a TF into
plausible and non-plausible regulatory ones. The numbers of
genes in B+, B+R+ and B+R- are shown for each of the nine cell
cycle TFs under study. B+R+ is further divided into two subsets
depending on whether the gene's expression profile is positively
(TlC > 0) or negatively (TlC < 0) correlated with the TF's
regulatory profile, possibly with time lags (see Additional file 1
for details).

Enrichment for specific functional categories
B+R+ is shown to be more enriched than B+R- for specific
MIPS functional categories with adjusted p-value < 0.05
(after the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests) using
the cumulative hypergeometric distribution (see Additional file 2 for details). In most cases (7/9), except for
Rap1 and Swi5, the number of enriched MIPS functional
categories in B+R+ is larger than that in B+R- (see Figure 1).
This result suggests that our criterion for distinguishing
the plausible from non-plausible regulatory targets of a TF
is reliable because co-regulated genes should have a
greater probability to be involved in the same functional
categories than non-co-regulated genes.
Enrichment for cell cycle genes
We compute the proportions of genes of B+R+ and B+Rthat belong to the known cell cycle genes identified by
Spellman et al. [7]. We then test whether the enrichment
of the known cell cycle genes in B+R+ is statistically higher
than that in B+R-. The cumulative hypergeometric distribution is used to assign a p-value for determining the statistical significance (see Appendix for details). In most
cases (7/9), except for Abf1 and Ace2, the cell cycle genes
are more enriched in B+R+ than in B+R- (see Table 2). This
result also suggests that our criterion for distinguishing
the plausible from non-plausible regulatory targets of a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/188

cell cycle TF is reliable because regulatory targets of a cell
cycle TF should be more enriched for the known cell cycle
genes than should non-regulatory targets.
Taken together, the results mentioned above convincingly
demonstrate that TRIA is a good method for identifying
the plausible regulatory targets of a TF from its binding
targets.
Identifying highly co-expressed genes among the plausible
regulatory targets of a TF
It is known that co-regulated genes may not be coexpressed [28]. Therefore, it is useful to identify highly coexpressed genes among co-regulated genes because these
co-regulated and highly co-expressed genes should be
more likely to be simultaneously co-activated or corepressed by the same TF and involve in the same cellular
process.

TRIA has the ability to identify subsets of highly coexpressed genes among the regulatory targets of a TF. First,
we use TRIA to identify the plausible regulatory targets
(B+R+) from the binding targets (B+) of a TF. Then, we classify B+R+ into subsets Ai and Ri, where Ai (Ri) contains all
genes whose expression profiles are positively (negatively) correlated with the TF's regulatory profile with a lag
of i time points. Finally, we test whether the expression
coherence of Xi is statistically higher than that of B+R+,
where Xi = Ai or Ri. The expression coherence of genes in a
set G (i.e. EC(G)) is defined as the fraction of gene pairs in
G with a correlation in expression level higher than a
threshold T [27]. The threshold T was determined to be
the 95th percentile correlation value of all pairwise correlations between 2000 randomly chosen genes in the yeast
genome. Note that 0 ≤ EC(G) ≤ 1. The cumulative hyperTable 2: Enrichment of cell cycle genes. The proportions of genes
that belong to the 793 cell cycle genes identified by Spellman et
al. [7] are calculated for B+R+ and B+R-. We then test whether the
enrichment of the known cell cycle genes in B+R+ is statistically
higher than that in B+R-. The cumulative hypergeometric
distribution is used to determine the statistical significance (see
the Appendix for details). In most cases (7/9), except for Abf1
and Ace2, the known cell cycle genes are more enriched in B+R+
than in B+R-.

geometric distribution is used to assign a p-value for
rejecting the null hypothesis EC(Xi) = EC(B+R+), where Xi
= Ai or Ri (see the Appendix for details).
Table 3 lists all subsets of Xi's that contain highly coexpressed genes with p-value < 0.001. This result shows
that in general several groups of highly co-expressed genes
can be extracted from the co-regulated genes, consistent
with the result of [28]. These co-regulated and highly coexpressed genes should be more likely to be simultaneously co-activated or co-repressed by the TF and can be
used as candidates for further experimental studies. As
shown in Table 3, different subsets may have different

functional roles, indicating the diverse functions a TF
might have.
Performance comparison with existing methods
To identify the regulatory targets of a TF, Gao et al. [21]
developed MA-Network that uses multivariate regression
analysis of gene expression data and Yu et al. [22] developed a modified factor analysis (MFA) approach. We
compare the identified regulatory targets of the TFs that
are available in our study and at least one of the other two
studies. On average, only 53% of our identified regulatory
targets are also found by MA-Network and only 31% of
our identified regulatory targets are also found by MFA.
There is little overlap between the above three studies.

Table 3: Identification of highly co-expressed genes among the regulatory targets of a TF. The expression coherence (EC) of B+R+, Ai
and Ri are calculated. We then test whether the expression coherence of Xi is statistically higher than that of B+R-, where Xi = Ai or Ri.
The cumulative hypergeometric distribution is used to assign a p-value for rejecting the null hypothesis EC(Xi) = EC(B+R+). Only those

Xi′ s that have p < 0.001 (i.e., -log10 p > 3) are shown (see the Appendix for details). In addition, we show the most enriched MIPS
functional category for each Xi.

This is not surprising biologically since the three methods
study different biological possibilities for the same phenomenon. However, since the results of the three methods are not highly congruent, a performance comparison
of these three methods should be done. Since a TF has to
bind to its regulatory targets to regulate their expressions,
enrichment of the high-confidence TF binding motifs
among the identified regulatory targets of a TF can be used
as a criterion for performance comparison. The high-confidence TF binding motifs were derived using six motif
discovery methods, also including the requirement for
conservation across at least three of the four related yeast
species [19]. Let S1 (T1) be the set of regulatory targets of a
TF that are identified by TRIA but not by MA-Network
(MFA) and S2 (T2) be the set of regulatory targets of a TF
that are identified by MA-Network (MFA) but not by
TRIA. We tested over-representation of the high-confidence TF binding motifs in S1 and S2 (T1 and T2). The
cumulative hypergeometric distribution is used to assign
a p-value to the motif enrichment (see the Appendix for
details). We found that in four of the five (4/5) cases the
high-confidence TF binding motifs are enriched in S1 with
p-value < 0.001 but only two of the five (2/5) cases in S2
are enriched (see Table 4). Similarly, we found that in six
of the eight (6/8) cases the high-confidence TF binding
motifs are enriched in T1 with p-value < 0.001 but none of
the eight (0/8) cases in T2 is enriched (see Table 5). The
results show that TRIA has a better ability to identify the
regulatory targets of a TF than do MA-Network and MFA.

Discussion
Many researchers used ChIP-chip data to study regulatory
networks of the yeast [17-19,29,30]. Most of them (except
[29]) regarded that a gene is regulated by a TF if the gene
is bound by the TF with a p-value ≤ 0.001 in the ChIP-chip
Table 4: Performance comparison of TRIA with MA-Network.
We tested over-representation of the high-confidence TF binding
motif in S1 and S2, where S1 is the set of regulatory targets of a TF
that are identified by TRIA but not by MA-Network and S2 is the
set of regulatory targets of a TF that are identified by MANetwork but not by TRIA. The proportions of genes, whose
promoter regions contain the high-confidence TF binding motif is
calculated for S1 and S2. The cumulative hypergeometric
distribution is used to determine the statistical significance of
over-representation (see the Appendix for details). In four of the
five (4/5) cases the high-confidence TF binding motifs are
enriched in S1 with p-value < 0.001 but only two of the five (2/5)
cases in S2.

data. However, a TF that binds to a gene may have no regulatory effect on that gene. Therefore, additional information is required to solve this uncertainty. TRIA was
developed to overcome this problem and was applied to
gene expression and ChIP-chip data to identify the plausible regulatory targets of nine cell cycle TFs. The effectiveness of TRIA was validated by statistically testing for the
enrichment of functional groups and known cell cycle
genes.
Since co-expressed genes are not necessarily co-regulated
and vice versa [28], it is important to develop a method
that can identify co-regulated genes that are not coexpressed. TRIA has the ability to do this task. Through
identifying a TF's binding targets that have temporal relationships with the TF, we can find the TF's regulatory targets that may not be co-expressed. We can further identify
subsets of highly co-expressed genes among the inferred
regulatory targets according to the identified time lags and
regulatory directions. These co-regulated and highly coexpressed genes should be more likely to be simultaneously co-activated or co-repressed by the TF and can be
used as candidates for further experimental studies.
TRIA has been successfully used by two previous studies to
investigate other biological problems. First, Tsai et al. [31]
developed TFBSfinder, which utilizes several data sources
(DNA sequences, phylogenetic information, microarray
data and ChIP-chip data), to identify cell cycle TF binding
sites in yeast. TRIA was used to select reliable target genes
of a TF in the first step of their algorithm. The target gene
selection is a important step that strongly enhances the
performance of TFBSfinder [31]. Since the performance of

Page 5 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:188

TFBSfinder is shown to be better than three well-known
TF binding site identification algorithms (AlignACE,
MDscan and MEME) [31], this confirmed that TRIA does
have ability to identify the plausible regulatory targets of
a TF. Second, Wu et al. [32] developed MOFA, which integrates gene expression and ChIP-chip data, to reconstruct
transcriptional regulatory modules (TRMs) of the yeast
cell cycle. TRIA was used as the first step of MOFA to refine
the noisy raw ChIP-chip data and construct a binding
score matrix. The quality of the binding score matrix
strongly affects the performance of MOFA [32]. The TRMs
identified by MOFA was validated by using existing experimental data, enrichment for genes in the same MIPS
functional category, known DNA-binding motifs, etc. In
addition, MOFA is capable of finding many novel TF-target gene relationships and can determine whether a TF is
an activator or/and a repressor [32]. Since MOFA can
reconstruct biologically relevant TRMs of the yeast cell
cycle, this also attests to the usefulness of TRIA.
In this paper, TRIA is used to identify regulatory targets of
cell cycle TFs. For a control, we show that TRIA can also
perform well for cell-cycle irrelevant regulators. In this
regard, we apply TRIA to identify regulatory targets of TFs
that are activated by amino acid starved stress. The
genome-wide gene expression and ChIP-chip data under
amino acid starved growth condition are download from
[8,19]. As shown in Figure 2, in most of the cases, B+R+ is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/188

more enriched than B+R- for specific MIPS functional categories with adjusted p-value < 0.05 (after the Bonferroni
correction for multiple tests) using the cumulative hypergeometric distribution. This result suggests that TRIA performed well for cell-cycle irrelevant TFs.
The development of TRIA was motivated by two biological observations. First, it is known that TF binding affects
gene expression in a nonlinear fashion: below some level
it has no effect, and above some level the effect may saturate. This type of behavior can be modeled using a sigmoid function. Therefore, we define a TF's regulatory
profile as a sigmoid function of its expression profile as in
previous studies [33-35]. Although this may not be true
for TFs that are activated at the post-translational stage
[20,36], it is not a serious problem for many cell cycle TFs
whose expression levels significantly varies with times,
indicating that they are under transcriptional control
[24,33,34,37-39]. Second, the regulatory effect of a TF on
its target genes may not be simultaneous but has a time
lag [23,24,26,35,37,38,40-42]. This makes TRIA more
general than previous studies [20-22,28] that regard a
gene to be regulated by a TF only when the gene's expression profile are co-expressed with the transcription factor
activity (TFA) profile. Actually, we found that TRIA performed better than two previous algorithms (MA-Network and MFA) [21,22]. This may result from the fact that
TRIA is designed for cell cycle TFs and also considers a
time-lagged correlation between a cell cycle TF and its regulatory targets.
In this study, we use time-lagged correlation analysis
between a TF and its binding targets to identify its regulatory targets. However, in some cases, TFs may interact with
each other and together regulate a group of target genes.
This issue will be addressed in the future. We will try to
define an overall regulatory profile of a TF complex and
apply TRIA to identify target genes that are co-regulated by
the same TF complex.

Conclusion

Enrichment in functional annotation for the stress response
Enrichment in functional annotation for the stress
response TFs under study. The numbers of significantly
enriched MIPS functional categories in B+R+ (blue) and B+R(brown) for each of the 27 amino acid starved stress TFs
under study are shown.

An algorithm called TRIA is developed to identify the
plausible regulatory targets of a TF from its binding targets. Since the binding of a TF to a gene does not necessarily imply regulation, TRIA is used to solve this ambiguity.
We validated the effectiveness of TRIA by checking the
enrichments for functional annotation and known cell
cycle genes. Moreover, the performance of TRIA was
shown to be better than two published methods (MA-Network and MFA). Moreover, TRIA has the ability to identify
subsets of highly co-expressed genes among the regulatory
targets of a TF. In addition, TRIA has been successfully
applied to identify high-confidence cell cycle TF binding
sites [31] and to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory
modules of the yeast cell cycle [32]. Finally, for a control,

TRIA is shown to perform well for cell-cycle irrelevant TFs.
In conclusion, TRIA can find biologically relevant results
and should be useful for systems biology study.

Methods
Data sets
Three types of data are used in this study. First, the ChIPchip data of the cell cycle TFs under the rich media are
downloaded from [19]. Second, the gene expression data
of the yeast cell cycle are downloaded from [7]. Although
it is an old data set, it is still the best cell cycle data set that
are available in the public domain. Genes that have only
one missing point in their gene expression profiles are
reconstructed by the spline algorithm [43], but genes that
have more than one missing value in their gene expression
profiles or have no ChIP-chip data are excluded. Third, the
genome-wide distribution of the high-confidence TF
binding motifs was downloaded from [19]. The high-confidence TF binding motifs were derived by using six motif
discovery methods, with the requirement for conservation
across at least three of four related yeast species [19].
Temporal Relationship Identification Algorithm (TRIA)
Temporal Relationship Identification Algorithm (TRIA) is
developed to identify TF-gene pairs that have a temporal
relationship. A cell cycle TF and its binding target are said
to have a positively (negatively) temporal relationship if
the target gene's expression profile is significantly positively (negatively) correlated with the TF's regulatory profile possibly with a time lag. It is known that TF binding
affects gene expression in a nonlinear fashion: below
some level it has no effect, and above some level the effect
may become saturated. This type of behavior can be modeled using a sigmoid function. Therefore, we define a TF's
regulatory profile as a sigmoid function of its expression
profile as in previous studies [33-35].

of the TF's regulatory profile considered. In this study, we
set L = 8 meaning that we compute the correlation
between a gene and a TF with all possible time lags that
are less than one cell cycle. The time lag may be interpreted as the time for a TF to have a regulatory effect on a
gene.

Then we test the null hypothesis H0: r(k) = 0 and the alternative hypothesis H1: r(k) ≠ 0 by the bootstrap method
(see the Appendix) and get a p-value p(k). The time-lagged
correlation (TlC) of y and RP( x ) is defined as r(j) that
has the smallest p-value (i.e. TlC( y , RP( x )) = r(j) if p(j) ≤
p(k) ∀k ≠ j). Note that -1 ≤ TlC( y , RP( x )) ≤ 1. Two possible temporal relationships between y and RP( x ) can
be identified by TRIA: y and RP( x ) are (1) positively correlated with a lag of j time points if TlC( y , RP( x )) = r(j)
> 0 &p(j) ≤ pThreshold and (2) negatively correlated with a lag
of j time points if TlC( y , RP( x )) = r(j) < 0 &p(j) ≤ pThreshold.
The pThreshold is chosen to ensure that we have at most a 5%
false discovery rate (FDR) [44]. We may consider that TF
x, after a lag of j time points, activates (represses) gene y if
y and RP( x ) are positively (negatively) correlated with a
lag of j time points.

Appendix
Let x =(x1, ..., xN) be the gene expression time profile of
cell cycle TF x and y = (y1, ..., yN) be the expression profile
of gene y. The regulatory profile RP( x ) = (f(x1), ..., f(xN))
of TF x is defined as a sigmoid function:

f ( xi ) =

1
1 + e −( xi − x ) / s)

i = 1, 2,

We calculate:

where x is the sample mean and s is the sample standard
deviation of x . Compute the correlation between y and
RP( x ) with a lag of k time points [24,25]:

Statistical test used in Table 3
The expression coherence (EC) of sets B+R+, Ai and Ri are
calculated, where Ai (Ri) contains all genes in B+R+ whose
expression profiles are positively (negatively) correlated
with the TF's regulatory profile with a lag of i time points.

We want to test whether the expression coherence of Xi is
statistically higher than that of B+R-, where Xi = Ai or Ri.
The p-value for rejecting the null hypothesis EC(Xi) =
EC(B+R+) (the alternative hypothesis is EC(Xi) >
EC(B+R+)) is defined as in Equation (A1). N is the number
of gene pairs in B+R+, M is the number of gene pairs in Xi,
where Xi = Ai or Ri, na is the number of gene pairs in B+R+
that have correlations higher than the threshold T, and ma
is the number of gene pairs in Xi that have correlations
higher than the threshold T.
Statistical tests used in Tables 4 and 5
The proportions of genes whose promoter regions contain
the high-confidence TF binding motif are calculated for S1
(T1) and S2 (T2), where S1 (T1) is the set of regulatory targets of a TF that are identified by TRIA but not by MA-Network (MFA) and S2(T2) is the set of regulatory targets of a
TF that are identified by MA-Network (MFA) but not by
TRIA. Only 5 TFs (Abf1, Ace2, Fkh2, Swi4, Swi5) are studied for both TRIA and MA-Network. Only 8 TFs (Abf1,
Ace2, Fkh1, Fkh2, Rap1, Swi4, Swi5, Swi6) are studied for
both TRIA and MFA.

The high-confidence TF binding motifs were derived by
using six motif discovery methods, under the requirement
for conservation across at least three of the four related
yeast species [19]. The yeast genome has 6229 ORFs. Only
817 genes contain Abf1 binding sites, 65 genes contains
Ace2 binding sites, 461 genes contain Fkh2 binding sites,

We tested over-representation of the high-confidence TF
binding motif in S1 (T1) and S2 (T2). The cumulative
hypergeometric distribution is used to determine the statistical significance. The p-value is defined as in Equation
(A1), where N = 6229 is the number of genes in the yeast
genome, M is the number of genes in G, where G = S1 (T1)
or S2(T2) (e.g. M = 62 for Abf1 if G = S1 and M = 56 for
Abf1 if G = S2; M = 72 for Rap1 if G = T1 and M = 36 for
Rap1 if G = T2), na is the number of genes in the yeast
genome that contain binding sites of a TF under study
(e.g. na = 817 for Abf1; na = 379 for Rap1) and ma is the
number of genes in G that contain binding sites of a TF
under study (e.g. ma = 46 for Abf1 if G = S1 and ma = 28 for
Abf1 if G = S2; ma = 32 for Rap1 if G = T1 and ma = 7 for
Rap1 if G = T2).
