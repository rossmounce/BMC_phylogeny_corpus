Abstract
Background: The reactive oxygen-generating NADPH oxidases (Noxes) function in a variety of
biological roles, and can be broadly classified into those that are regulated by subunit interactions and
those that are regulated by calcium. The prototypical subunit-regulated Nox, Nox2, is the membraneassociated catalytic subunit of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase. Nox2 forms a heterodimer with the
integral membrane protein, p22phox, and this heterodimer binds to the regulatory subunits p47phox,
p67phox, p40phox and the small GTPase Rac, triggering superoxide generation. Nox-organizer protein 1
(NOXO1) and Nox-activator 1 (NOXA1), respective homologs of p47phox and p67phox, together with
p22phox and Rac, activate Nox1, a non-phagocytic homolog of Nox2. NOXO1 and p22phox also regulate
Nox3, whereas Nox4 requires only p22phox. In this study, we have assembled and analyzed amino acid
sequences of Nox regulatory subunit orthologs from vertebrates, a urochordate, an echinoderm, a
mollusc, a cnidarian, a choanoflagellate, fungi and a slime mold amoeba to investigate the evolutionary
history of these subunits.
Results: Ancestral p47phox, p67phox, and p22phox genes are broadly seen in the metazoa, except for the
ecdysozoans. The choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, the unicellular organism that is the closest relatives
of multicellular animals, encodes early prototypes of p22phox, p47phox as well as the earliest known Nox2like ancestor of the Nox1-3 subfamily. p67phox- and p47phox-like genes are seen in the sea urchin
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the limpet Lottia gigantea that also possess Nox2-like co-orthologs of
vertebrate Nox1-3. Duplication of primordial p47phox and p67phox genes occurred in vertebrates, with
the duplicated branches evolving into NOXO1 and NOXA1. Analysis of characteristic domains of
regulatory subunits suggests a novel view of the evolution of Nox: in fish, p40phox participated in regulating
both Nox1 and Nox2, but after the appearance of mammals, Nox1 (but not Nox2) became independent
of p40phox. In the fish Oryzias latipes, a NOXO1 ortholog retains an autoinhibitory region that is
characteristic of mammalian p47phox, and this was subsequently lost from NOXO1 in later vertebrates.
Detailed amino acid sequence comparisons identified both putative key residues conserved in
characteristic domains and previously unidentified conserved regions. Also, candidate organizer/activator
proteins in fungi and amoeba are identified and hypothetical activation models are suggested.
Conclusion: This is the first report to provide the comprehensive view of the molecular evolution of
regulatory subunits for Nox enzymes. This approach provides clues for understanding the evolution of
biochemical and physiological functions for regulatory-subunit-dependent Nox enzymes.

Background
Nox enzymes (reactive oxygen-generating NADPH-oxidases) diverged early in evolution into calcium-regulated
Noxes (e.g., Nox5 and the Duox enzymes) and Noxes that
are activated by binding to regulatory subunits [1,2]. The
most extensively studied of the latter is the phagocyte
NAPDH-oxidase (Phox), whose role in host defense has
been documented at length [3-8]. Professional phagocytes
such as neutrophils and macrophages produce large
amounts of superoxide, with secondary production of
other microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide is generated by the Phox, which consists of the catalytic subunit gp91phox (a.k.a. Nox2), along with the
regulatory subunits p22phox, p67phox, p47phox, p40phox,
and the small GTPase, Rac [3,6,9-11]. The importance of
the oxidase is demonstrated by the inherited condition,
chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), in which absent
or mutated Phox proteins result in an inability of phagocytes to kill microbes [4,12,13].
Nox2 and p22phox are integral membrane proteins that
form a heterodimer referred to as flavocytochrome b558. In
resting cells, flavocytochrome b558 is inactive and
p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox are all present in the cytoplasm. Cell activation is accompanied by phosphorylation of p47phox and probably other Phox-regulatory
subunits [3,10,14-16], and by guanine nucleotide
exchange factors that convert Rac-GDP to Rac-GTP [3,17].
These events trigger assembly of these proteins at the
membrane, resulting in activation of Nox2. An intricate
set of protein-protein interactions facilitates the binding
of the regulatory subunits to the membrane components
and to each other, and these interactions are mediated by
well-characterized modular interaction domains. For
example, p47phox and p67phox bind via a C-terminal proline-rich region (PRR) in p47phox and a C-terminal Src
homology 3 (SH3) domain in p67phox [18]. In the nonactivated cell, the p47phox-p67phox complex fails to bind
to flavocytochrome b558, due to an unusual autoinhibitory
mechanism. In the resting cell, tandem SH3 domains in
p47phox (referred to as the bis-SH3 domain) bind to an
auto-inhibitory region (AIR), preventing the bis-SH3
domain from binding to the PRR of p22phox. Upon cell
activation, serine residues of the AIR become phosphorylated, releasing the bis-SH3 domain so that it can now
bind to p22phox [19-22]. In addition, p47phox possesses
another membrane-binding region, the PX domain,
which binds to the headgroups of phosphatidylinositols
present in the membrane [23-25]. Together, these interactions with membrane lipids and p22phox promote the
assembly of p47phox and p67phox with flavocytochrome
b558. Concurrently, Rac-GTP translocates to the membrane
where it interacts with the N-terminal tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR) region of p67phox [26-28]. An activation
domain (AD) in p67phox, which is conformationally reg-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/178

ulated by Rac binding [29], activates the hydride transfer
from NADPH to FAD in Nox2. Subsequent electron transfer through two heme groups permits reduction of oxygen
to form superoxide [30,31]. p40phox binds through its
Phox/Bem 1 (PB1) domain to a partner PB1 domain in
p67phox and facilitates the assembly of p67phox-p47phox
at the membrane through lipid binding via its PX domain
[32-34]. Although no CGD patients have been described
with mutations in p40phox, neutrophils from p40phoxknockout mice exhibit CGD-like severe defects in Nox2derived oxidant-dependent bacterial killing [35], also suggesting that p40phox is a crucial component for Nox2
function.
The first homologue of gp91phox identified was Nox1,
which is abundantly expressed in non-phagocyte cells
including gastrointestinal epithelium and vascular
smooth muscle [9,36]. Subsequently, additional homologues were identified, and the Nox/Duox family in
humans now consists of seven members: Nox1 though
Nox5, Duox1 and Duox2 [9,37]. All members of Nox/
Duox family contain the six transmembrane α-helical
heme-binding domain and an FAD domain containing an
NADPH binding site, which together constitute the "Nox
domain"[1]. Nox5 and Duox1/2 contain a calcium-binding EF-hand motif. The evolution of these Noxes and their
calcium-binding domains were considered in the recent
article [1] and are not discussed here. The remaining
Noxes, Nox1-4, require p22phox for activity, and Nox1-3
all require additional Phox-like regulatory subunits,
reviewed recently [10,11,37].
Nox1, like gp91phox, is activated by regulatory subunits:
NOXO1 (Nox-organizer protein 1) is a homologue of
p47phox and NOXA1 (Nox-activator protein 1) is a homologue of p67phox [38-41]. Recent studies have also demonstrated activation of the Nox1 system by Rac1 [42-45].
NOXO1 and NOXA1 are co-expressed with Nox1 in colon
epithelium and gastric mucosa [39,43,46], consistent
with in vivo regulation of Nox1 by these novel subunits.
Activation of Nox1 by regulatory subunits differs in two
major respects compared to gp91phox. First, NOXO1 lacks
the AIR and its associated regulatory phosphorylation
sites that are present in p47phox. Consistent with the
domain structure, NOXO1 co-localizes with Nox1/
p22phox complex constitutively at/near the plasma membrane in vivo [40,41]. On the other hand, a recent study
revealed that the bis-SH3 domain of NOXO1 bind to the
extremely C-terminal PRR of NOXO1 [47]. Phosphorylation-independent disruption of the intramolecular interaction facilitates NOXO1 binding to the PRR of p22phox.
Second, NOXA1 lacks critical basic amino acid residues in
its PB1 domain that are important for binding to p40phox.
NOXA1 does not interact with p40phox, making human
Nox1 activity independent of p40phox [40]. Furthermore,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:178

human NOXA1 lacks the central SH3 domain that is
present in p67phox [38-40], but whose function is
unknown. Like Nox1, Nox3 is also regulated by p22phox
and NOXO1, but in humans does not require NOXA1
[48-51]. In comparison, Nox4 requires p22phox for activity, but other known regulatory subunits are not needed
[52-54].
Another subfamily of the Noxes is the NoxA/NoxB group,
found in a slime mold amoeba and fungi. These fungal
Nox genes have been identified in most ascomycetes
except for hemiascomycete yeasts, and also in higher
basidiomycetes and chytridiomycotes (reviewed in [55]).
No Nox gene has been identified in fungi that belong to
Zygomycota and Micropordia. These NoxA/NoxB genes
are closely related to the subunit-regulated Noxes according to taxonomy [1]. A non-animal homologue of
p67phox/NOXA1 was described in slime mold amoeba
Dictyostelium discoideum (D. discoideum) [56]. The p67phox
homolog (referred to here as the Dd-p67-like) of D. discoideum possesses the N-terminal TPR region and PB1
domain characteristic of p67phox, but lacks the SH3
domain [56]. A p67phox homolog Nox-regulator (NOXR)
was also reported in some fungi including ascomycetes
and higher basidiomycetes [55,57]. The basic motif structure of NOXR is similar to that of D. discoideum. A NOXRdeficient mutant of the ascomycete Epichlöe festucae shows
decreased ROS-generation [57]. Taken together, these
data suggest that NOXR regulates NoxA and/or NoxB in
the slime mold and fungi, although this has not been
tested directly.
Herein, we assembled and analyzed experimentally
cloned and computationally predicted amino acid
sequences of the Phox-related regulatory subunits
p47phox, NOXO1, p67phox, NOXA1, p40phox, p22phox,
and NOXR from 10 vertebrates, one urochordate, one
echinoderm, one mollusc, one cnidarian, one choanoflagellate, 13 fungi, and one slime mold amoeba. Using this
large set of amino acid sequences, we report: (i) the occurrence and origin of Phox-like subunits during evolution,
(ii) identification of putative key amino acid residues conserved in regulatory subunits, (iii) the description of putative new modular regions that are conserved among Phoxrelated regulatory subunits, (iv) the molecular evolution
of characteristic domains of the Phox-related regulatory
subunits, and (v) a prediction of novel fungal and amoebal Nox organizer/enhancer subunits based on sequence
analysis.

Results and discussion
Occurrence of Phox-related regulatory subunits
Figure 1A summarizes the occurrence of subunit-dependent-like Nox orthologs along with the Phox-like regulatory
subunit orthologs in the genomes of deutrostomes, fungi,

a slime mold amoeba. The tetrapods [human Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), dog Canis familliaris (C. familliaris), rat
Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus), mouse Mus musculus (M.
musculus), chicken Gallus gallus (G. gallus), frog Xenopus
tropicalis (X. tropicalis)], and the two teleost fish [zebrafish
Danio rerio (D. rerio), medaka Oryzias latipes (O. latipes)]
have two isologs of Nox organizer proteins (p47phox and
NOXO1), two isologs of Nox activator proteins (p67phox
and NOXA1), and single isologs of p40phox and p22phox
(Figure 1A, the sequences are provided in Additional file
1). The pufferfish Takifugu rubripes (T. rubripes), which has
a compact genome size, ~400 megabase (Mb) [58], lacks
NOXO1 and NOXA1 although it possesses both Nox1
and Nox2 as well as p22phox, p47phox, p67phox, and
p40phox (Figure 1A), in contrast to D. rerio and O. latipes
that have less compact genomes (1680–2280 Mb and
870–1100 Mb, respectively, according to the Animal
Genome Size Database [59]). Interestingly, Tetraodon
nigroviridis (T. nigroviridis), another species of pufferfish,
which also possesses a compact genome, ~340 Mb [60],
encodes a NOXO1 ortholog, but not NOXA1 (Figure 1A).
The earlier chordate Ciona intestinalis (C. intestinalis) possesses a Nox2 ortholog, but not Nox1 or Nox3 [1,61]. The
sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (S. purpuratus)
belongs to Echinodermata, which diverged early from an
ancestor common to urochordates and vertebrates [62]. S.
purpuratus, possesses two Nox2 genes, Nox2A and Nox2B,
and an analysis of the taxonomy Noxes demonstrates that
these Nox2 genes are related to the common ancestor
gene of vertebrate Nox1, Nox2 and Nox3 [1]. C. intestinalis
possesses single copies of p47phox-, p67phox-, and
p22phox-like genes [61], which presumably regulate its
Nox2 ortholog (Figure 1A). The S. purpuratus genome possesses single copies of p47phox- and p67phox-like genes
(Figure 1A). No p22phox ortholog of S. purpuratus was
identified using a BLAST search of recently published
genome sequences [63]. Because the S. purpuratus
p47phox-like protein has a highly conserved tandem SH3
region that in other species binds to the C-terminal proline-rich region (PRR) of p22phox, it seems likely that S.
purpuratus has an as-yet unidentified p22phox homologue.
Using the estimated time of evolution of deuterostomes
based on Hox gene clusters to construct a phylogenetic
tree [64], we illustrate the occurrence during evolution of
the Phox-related regulatory subunits(Figure 1B). The phylogenic tree suggests an evolutionary model in which
duplication of both the p47phox gene and the p67phox
gene occurred at a time corresponding to the appearance
of vertebrates, with the NOXO1 and NOXA1 genes subsequently evolving as distinct regulatory subunits in vertebrates (Figure 1B). This appearance of NOXO1 and
NOXA1 coincided with the emergence of Nox1 [1]. The
pufferfish T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis are considered to

186 million years ago [64]. This tree suggests that NOXA1
and NOXO1 of T. rubripes and NOXA1 of T. nigroviridis
have been lost during the decrease in genome sizes in

these species (Figure 1B). In contrast to the co-appearance
of p47phox and p67phox orthologs with the earliest Nox2
ortholog in S. purpuratus, p40phox appeared later, in vertebrates, and was not found in the genomes of either C.

intestinalis or S. purpuratus (Figure 1B). The situation of the
regulatory subunits of other primitive animals and a choanoflagellate is described below.
A homologue of p67phox/NOXA1 occurs in the slime
mold amoeba (D. discoideum) [56] (Figure 1A). Fungal
genomes of Aspergillus nidulans (A. nidulans), Magnaporthe
grisea (M. grisea), and Fusarium graminearum (F. graminearum), all members of Ascomycota, also possess NOXR, a
homolog of p67phox [55] (Figure 1A). However, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) that also belongs to Ascomycota does not possess any Nox or NOXR orthologs [1,55]
(Figure 1A). Some basidiomycetes [Coprinopsis cinerea (C.
cinerea), Laccaria bicolor (L. bicolor), and Postia placenta (P.
placenta)] also possess NOXR and NoxA/B genes (Figure
1A). The situation of the regulatory subunits of other
fungi is described below. Interestingly, the fungi seem to
lack precise homologues of p47phox/NOXO1 or its binding partner p22phox (Figure 1A). Recently, the possibility
of p22phox-like gene in the D. discoideum genome was suggested [56], but it is not clear whether the gene represents
an ancestral p22phox, a later adaptation or a functionally
unrelated protein. We discuss the possibilities below
based on a comparison of the amino acid sequences of
amoebal p22phox and other p22phox orthologs. In addition, we identified other predicted proteins encoded in
fungal and amoebal genomes that may function as (a)
binding partner(s) of the Nox activator proteins
(described below), suggesting the early evolutionary origin not only of the activator protein, but also possibly of
a rudimentary organizer subunit.
Synteny of NOXO1 ad NOXA1 genes in vertebrates
An extensive BLAST search has failed to identify the
NOXA1 gene in the pufferfish T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis
genomes, as indicated in Figure 1. In addition to the
absence of NOXA1, T. rubripes seems to have lost the
NOXO1 gene. To substantiate that the NOXO1 and
NOXA1 genes were indeed absent, we compared chromosomal synteny (the preserved chromosomal order of
genes among organisms) of NOXO1 in vertebrates. The
human NOXO1 gene is preceded by SYNGR3 and GFER
genes on chromosome 16 (Figure 2A, abbreviations of
gene names are shown in Additional file 2), and followed
by TBL3, RPS2 and RPL3L. Synteny was preserved in
mammals and the chicken G. gallus. The frog X. tropicalis
lacks SYNGR3, but other markers are preserved. Among
fish, T. nigroviridis conserved part of the mammalian synteny: NOXO1, TBL3, RPS2, and RPL3L and instead of
SYNGR3 and GFER, C17orf39 is positioned next to
NOXO1. Synteny of the T. rubripes genome was very similar to that of T. nigroviridis, although it lacks a NOXO1
ortholog (Figure 2A). Two fishes, D. rerio and O. latipes,
genomes possess NOXO1 genes, but with greater variations in synteny;although TBL3 and C17orf39 were

present in the same chromosome as NOXO1, other linked
markers were not seen (Figure 2A). The gene markers
C17orf39 and TBL3 of O. latipes are present on a separate
chromosome from that of NOXO1. Thus, the synteny
analysis of the T. rubripes genomes shows that the NOXO1
gene was indeed lost during evolution.
The synteny of genetic markers surrounding NOXA1 was
highly conserved in H. sapiens, C. familliaris, M. musculus,
G. gallus (Figure 2B). Both NOXA1 and the linked markers
of R. norvegicus were present in chromosome 3, with a
long insert between NOXA1and ENTPD8 (Figure 2B). In
the genome of X. tropicalis, synteny was more varied in
that NOXA1 and ENTPD8 were present in the same scaffold, but other markers were not seen. Synteny of fish
NOXA1 was preserved among the class but different from
other vertebrates. O. latipes and D. rerio NOXA1 genes are
preceded by MAN1B1 and DPP7 on chromosome 9 and
5, respectively (Figure 2B). T. nigroviridis possesses two

markers MAN1B1 and DPP7, but lacks the NOXA1
ortholog. Synteny of T. rubripes is similar to that of D.
rerio, but a NOXA1 ortholog is absent. Thus, the synteny
of NOXA1 had considerable variation, and this analysis
indicates that NOXA1 orthologs were lost during the evolution of the two pufferfish genomes.

Identification of putative critical amino acids conserved
among p47phox/NOXO1 orthologs
The PX domain of p47phox binds with highest affinity to
phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4)P2],
and with lower but significant affinity to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3,
PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3)P [23-25]. The PX domain of

Page 6 of 29
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:178

human NOXO1 shows a different lipid binding specificity, with highest affinity for PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(5)P,
and PtdIns(4)P and lower affinity for PtdIns(3)P and
PtdIns(3,4)P2 [41,65]. Both PX and bis-SH3 domains are
seen in all p47phox/NOXO1 orthologs of deuterostomes
(Figure 3A). Comparison of the sequences of the organizer proteins allowed identification of amino acid residues
that are highly conserved (Figure 3A). Eleven highly conserved residues were identified in the PX domain, and 22
in the bis-SH3 domains (arrows in Figure 3A). Arg-42, Pro73, and Arg-90 of the PX-domain and Trp-193, Phe-209,
and Trp-263 of the bis-SH3 domain (human-p47phox
numbering, black boxes in Figure 3A) were previously
shown by mutational analyses to be essential for the activation of human Nox2 by p47phox [24,66-68].
While the PX and bis-SH3 domains are shared among all
p47phox and NOXO1 orthologs including those of S. purpuratus and C. intestinalis, the molecular taxonomy of the
regions (excluding the variable C-terminal regulator docking regions) reveals that vertebrate p47phox and NOXO1
families form distinct subgroups (Figure 3B), likely
accounting, for example, for differences in lipid binding
specificities [24,41]. The phylogenic tree supports an evolutionary model in which the p47phox-like proteins of S.
purpuratus and C. intestinalis (#21 and 20 of Figure 3B,
respectively) branch from a root that is closely related to
the primordial ancestors of both p47phox (#1–10 of Figure 3B) and NOXO1 (#11–19 of Figure 3B).
To maintain p47phox strictly in an inactive state that cannot bind to p22phox, human p47phox masks its bis-SH3
domain with the AIR region [21,68,69], and this region is
absent in human NOXO1 [38-41]. Therefore Nox2 activity is considered more tightly controlled than Nox1 activity. Most residues essential for the function of the AIR
(e.g., Pro-299, Pro-300, Arg-301, Arg-302, Ser-303, Ser304 and Ser-328 of human p47phox), are well conserved
among all vertebrate p47phox proteins (black boxes of Figure 3C). Interestingly C. intestinalis and S. purpuratus
p47phox proteins possessed the AIR-like region (Figure
3C). S. purpuratus possesses two Nox2-like proteins
Nox2A and 2B that are co-orthologs of vertebrate Noxes
1–3; the presence of a p47phox ortholog harboring the AIR
suggests that this primitive Nox system functions analogously to the mammalian Nox2 system. All NOXO1
orthologs lack the AIR, with one exception, the teleost fish
O. latipes, which retains the predicted AIR in both the
p47phox and the NOXO1 genes (Figure 3C). Thus, this
analysis supports an evolutionary model in which the
NOXO1 "AIR-independent" Nox1 and Nox3 activation
systems originated from the p47phox-like "AIR-dependent" Nox2 regulatory system. The O. latipes NOXO1,
which contains the AIR, represents an evolutionary rem-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/178

nant reflecting the transition from AIR-dependence to independence.
The heterodimerization of human p47phox and p67phox
is dependent on the interaction between the C-terminal
PRR of p47phox and the C-terminal SH3 domain of
p67phox [40,70-72]. Both of these regions were conserved
in vertebrate p47phox and p67phox orthologs, but not in
orthologs of lower organisms (Figure 3A). The alignment
of vertebrate p47phox and NOXO1 amino acid sequences
demonstrates that in addition to the PRR, the C-terminal
region immediately following the PRR ("C-tail" in Figure
3D) was also highly conserved. The PRR of p47phox isologs possesses four strictly conserved residues (Pro-363,
Pro-366, Arg-368, Pro-369; human-p47phox numbering),
and the C-tail region had an additional four identical
amino acids (Ile-374, Arg-377, Cys-378, and Thr-382;
human-p47phox numbering) (Figure 3D). Consistent
with these identities, the essential binding roles of three
residues (Pro-363, Pro-366, Arg-368, indicated by black
boxes of Figure 3D) were previously demonstrated by
mutational analyses [18]. The C-tail region is thought to
enhance the interaction between the PRR of p47phox and
the SH3 domain of p67phox [18], since simultaneous
mutation of six of these residues (Leu-373, Ile-374, Arg377, Thr-382, Lys-383, and Lys-385; human-p47phox
numbering, indicated by black boxes of Figure 3D) significantly decreased the binding of the p47phox PRR to the
p67phox SH3 domain [18,72]. Four of these residues (Ile374, Arg-377, Thr-382, and Lys-383) are highly conserved
among both p47phox and NOXO1 proteins, but two other
residues (Leu-373 and Lys-385; human-p47phox numbering) were conserved only in p47phox orthologs (Figure
3D). This suggests that the binding affinities of p47phox
and NOXO1 toward their respective activator protein SH3
domains may differ due to differences in these residues.
Ser-379 in the C-tail region of human p47phox is a phosphorylation site [19]; the phosphorylation of which negatively regulates binding of the PRR and C-tail regions to
the p67phox SH3 domain [72]. The threonine or serine
residue is conserved at the position in all vertebrate
p47phox and G. gallus, D. rerio and O. latipes NOXO1
(indicated by an arrow head in Figure 3D), indicating that
NOXO1 proteins of these species retain this feature of
p47phox which is subsequently lost in higher vertebrate
NOXO1.
T. rubripes C17orf39 ortholog as a candidate NOXO1like protein
The NOXO1 gene seems to have been lost from the T.
rubripes genome, as shown in Figure 2A. On the other
hand, orthologs of chromosome 17 open reading frame
39 (C17orf39) gene predicted by the ensembl transcript
model [73] are present adjacent to the NOXO1 genes in
the D. rerio and T. nigroviridis genomes (Figure 2A).

Amino acid sequences of these C17orf39 orthologs
showed conserved PRR and polybasic regions (Figure. 4B,
respectively, indicated by black boxes). In addition to the
PRR and polybasic region, the T. rubripes C17orf39
ortholog has an extended region that encodes domains
analogous to the C-terminal regions of NOXO1; these
contain the bis-SH3 domain, PRR and C-tail region (Figure 4A). The sequence of T. rubripes C17orf39 possesses
the 22 residues that are conserved in bis-SH3 domains of
p47phox and NOXO1 (Figure 4C) and the eight key residues conserved in the PRR and C-tail regions (Figure 4D).
A phosphorylation site corresponding to Ser-379 residue
of human p47phox is also conserved in the T. rubripes
C17orf39 (Figure 4D). Although the function of C17orf39
has not been established in any species, its NOXO1-like
domain structure suggests that the C17orf39 ortholog of
T. rubripes may function in place of the authentic NOXO1.

Identification of putative critical amino acids conserved
among p67phox/NOXA1 orthologs
Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the 24 Noxactivator proteins (including amoebal and fungal isologs)
identified 13 conserved amino acids in the TPR domains
(Figure 5A). This includes two residues that have been
identified as essential for binding human p67phox to Rac,
as determined by the crystal structure of the complex [21]
(Figure 5A, filled boxes). The AD was first identified by
mutagenesis of p67phox [30]. Val-204 of human p67phox
and the corresponding residue Val-205 of human NOXA1
are crucial for respective activation of Nox2 and Nox1
[30,41]. All orthologs of p67phox and NOXA1, and one
fungal NOXR (A. nidulans-NOXR) conserve this valine residue (Figure 5C). The two fungal NOXR (M. grisea and F.
graminearum) retained the hydrophobic amino acid leucine instead of valine at this position (Figure 5C). Similarly, the second AD-like region of S. purpuratus p67phoxlike protein (Sp-p67phox-C) conserved an isoleucine resi-

due at this position. In contrast, Dd-p67-like protein
lacked a typical AD sequence (Figure 5C). The N-terminal
region containing the TPR and AD can be considered as
the "Nox-activating region", a module that cooperates
with Rac to activate Nox enzymatic activity [11,29-31,74].
Taxonomy of the "Nox-activating region" (corresponding
to residues 1–212 of human p67phox) reveals distinct subgroups corresponding to NOXA1 and to p67phox, and
shows that the NOXR proteins of fungi also represent a
distinct subgroup (Figure 5B). A fourth rather diverse subgroup is comprised of p67phox-like proteins that include
those of S. purpuratus and C. intestinalis (numbers 19–21
in Figure 5B). Taken together with the taxonomy of
p47phox (Figure 3B) and of Noxes [1], these data support
an evolutionary model in which duplication of both the
p67phox and p47phox genes occurred in vertebrates at a
time corresponding to the appearance of Nox1. In contrast to fungal NOXR, Dd-p67-like protein appeared to
branch from a root shared with sea urchin-p67phox-like
genes (Figure 5B); however, the bootstrap value was only
35% raising uncertainty as to which subgroup the amoebal p67-like protein belongs. Nevertheless, amoebal p67like protein is clearly distinct from the NOXR group.
In contrast to the C-terminal SH3 domain (SH3-B) of activator proteins which is seen in all vertebrate activator proteins, the central SH3 domain (SH3-A) was seen only in
vertebrate p67phox (Figure 5A). Comparison of sequences
of all vertebrate p67phox orthologs identified 31 highly
conserved amino acids in this SH3 domain (Figure 5A and
Additional file 3). In addition, a region between AD and
SH3-A (termed here the ADSIS region for " AD-SH3 Intervening Sequence") was strictly conserved among vertebrate p67phox isologs, but was not seen in others, such as
NOXA1 and NOXR. A consensus sequence was identified
in this region (Figure 5D). A PRR-like region (residues
227–231 of human p67phox) was seen in ADSIS region,
but it does not conserve in all vertebrate p67phox isologs
based on the deduced sequences (Figure 5D). The role of
the putative region is currently unknown, but may involve
a function related to SH3-A because it coincides with the
presence of SH3-A. Despite the high conservation of SH3A among vertebrate p67phox orthologs, the role of this
domain is not defined [10,75].
The PB1 domain was present in all vertebrate p67phox, in
vertebrate NOXA1 and in fungal NOXR and amoebal p67like protein, but not in C. intestinalis and S. purpuratus
p67phox-like proteins (Figure 5A). The crystal structure of
the heterodimer between the PB1 domains of p67phox
and p40phox domain demonstrated that Lys-355 and Lys382 in human p67phox are essential to bind the PB1
domain of p40phox [32,76]. Residues corresponding to
Lys-355 and Lys-382 of human p67phox are conserved not
only in the vertebrate p67phox, but also in the NOXA1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/178

orthologs of chicken (G. gallus) and fish (D. rerio and O.
latipes) (Figure 5E). This suggests that in addition to its
well-described role in activating Nox2, p40phox probably
also participates in activating Nox1 in chicken and fish
(Figure 5E). On the other hand, NOXA1 of X. tropicalis has
lost both of these p40phox-interacting residues. Thus,
these data support an evolutionary model in which
p40phox originally participated in regulating both Nox1
and Nox2 in vertebrates, but after the appearance of mammals, Nox1 (but not Nox2) became independent of
p40phox. The lack of a PB1 domain in both C. intestinalis
and S. purpuratus p67phox-like proteins is consistent with
the absence of p40phox orthologs in these species (Figure
1B).
The analysis of PB1 domain sequences in Nox activators
also suggests an unexpected relationship between the AD
and the PB1 domain. AD regions of all vertebrate p67phox
contain a positively charged residue, e.g., Lys-196 of hp67phox (indicated by gray boxes in Figure 5C). This basic
residue is also completely conserved in NOXA1 orthologs
of G. gallus, D. rerio and O. latipes (Figure 5C), which
retain functional PB1 domains (Figure 5E), but not in the
other NOXA1 and p67phox-like proteins (Figure 5C)
(with the single exception of the C-terminal AD-like
region of S. purpuratus p67phox-like protein). Interestingly, the fungal NOXR, which possess these key basic residues in their PB1 domains (Figure 5E), also conserves
this basic residue in their AD regions (Figure 5C). Thus,
the presence of a functional PB1 domain correlates
strongly with the presence of a positively charged residue
corresponding to position 196 in the human p67phox
sequence, and may point to the functional cooperation of
these two regions, e.g. in binding to p40phox or other
functionally analogous proteins in fungi (Figure 5F).
Alternatively, the positively charged residue in AD region
might be related to the tail-to-tail interaction between vertebrate p47phox and p67phox (and NOXO1-NOXA1 of
early vertebrates) because a sequence analysis of Nox
organizers that is shown in Figure 3D suggests that the
conserved residue also co-occurs with the phosphorylation site in the C-tail region of all vertebrate p47phox and
early vertebrate NOXO1. Thus, co-appearance and co-disappearance of evolutionarily conserved residue provides a
hint to find an unknown relationship between regulatorysubunits.
SH3-B was seen in all vertebrate p67phox and NOXA1
orthologs and in S. purpuratus p67phox-like protein (Figure 5A). Among these orthologs, seven conserved amino
acid residues in SH3-B were identified (Figure 5A), and
the residues include a tryptophan (Trp-494; human
p67phox- numbering) that was previously shown to be
crucial for interaction with the C-terminal PRR of Nox
organizer proteins [40].

Identification of putative critical amino acids conserved
among p40phox orthologs
Mammalian p40phox is considered to be an enhancer of
Nox2 activation [33,35,77,78]. p40phox orthologs
emerged in vertebrates (see Figure 1B) coincident with the
appearance of the PB1 domain of p67phox-like proteins.
Fungal NOXR and amoebal p67-like proteins also possess
the PB1 domains (Figure 5E), but their genomes do not
encode a distinct p40phox ortholog. The protein
sequences of vertebrate p40phox orthologs are highly conserved; the canonical PX, SH3, and PB1 domains are all
seen among vertebrate p40phox orthologs (Figure 6A).
Alignment of ten vertebrate p40phox orthologs showed 48
conserved amino acid residues in the PX domain (see
Additional file 3), including Phe-35, Arg-57, Tyr-59, Leu65, Arg-105 (human p40phox numbering) that have been
demonstrated to be essential for phospholipid-binding
[23,24,79,80]. Phylogenic analysis using the trimmed PX
domain sequences (Figure 6B) does not reveal obvious
sub-families. Recently a novel intramolecular interaction
in p40phox between the PX and PB1 domains was
reported [81]. The interface between the PX and PB1
domains consists of a hydrophobic pocket by Phe-35 of
the PX domain and Val-257, Pro-265, Leu-273 and Phe320 of the PB1 domain and ionic interactions between
His-38, Arg-58, and Arg-60 of the PX domain and Glu-259
and Asp-269 of the PB1 domain (human p40phox numbering) [82]. The residue corresponding to the Leu-273 is
much varied among vertebrate p40phox proteins (see
Additional file 3), suggesting that the residue is less crucial
than that previously proposed if the interaction is important in other vertebrates than human. The residue to His38 is often replaced by tyrosine. The majority of other residues are conserved, but there are some exceptions: residues corresponding to Arg-60 in X. tropicalis p40phox and
to Glu-259 and Asp-269 in rat p40phox (see Additional
file 3).

To the best of our knowledge, a role for the SH3 domain
of p40phox has not been defined [10]. Eighteen amino
acids are conserved in the SH3 domain (see Additional
file 3). Between the PX and SH3 domains, we identified a
new conserved region of 15 amino acids that is rich in
proline, arginine and lysine, and is therefore designated
the "proline-basic (P-basic) domain" (Figure 6A). This
putative region is not essential for PtdIns(3)P-binding by
the p40phox PX domain [25,80]. An intramolecular interaction between the PX and PB1 domains seem not to be
related to P-basic region according to the structure of full
length p40phox [81,82]. The structural analysis demonstrates that P-basic region forms a separate motif and is situated closely to the PX domain [82], indicating that it
might support the cell membrane-binding function of
p40phox together with the PX-domain. Alternatively, the
P-basic region might interact with the SH3 domain of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/178

p40phox in a manner similar to the interaction between
the AIR and the tandem SH3 of human p47phox. Interestingly, Thr-154 of human p40phox, located in the center of
P-basic region, has been identified as a phosphorylation
site [16], and this residue is entirely conserved among all
vertebrate p40phox orthologs (Figure 6A).
The PB1 domain of human p40phox harbors acidic amino
acids forming the "OPCA (OPR/PC/AID) motif". An
OPCA motif contains four distinctive acidic residues that
are essential for binding to conserved basic residues in the
p67phox PB1 domain [32]. The four acidic residues, Asp289, Glu-291, Asp-293 and Asp-302 (human p40phox
numbering) are conserved in all orthologs with the exception of a glutamine rather than a glutamic acid in the position of C. familliaris p40phox that corresponds to Glu-291
of human p40phox (Figure 6A).
Identification of putative critical amino acids conserved
among p22phox orthologs
Human p22phox contains two predicted transmembrane
regions [83] and forms a stabilizing heterocomplex with
Nox2 as well as Nox1, Nox3, and Nox4 [51-53]. The PRR
of p22phox is the only motif in this protein whose role in
Nox activation has been demonstrated [3,10]. The PRR is
highly conserved among all p22phox orthologs (Figure 7A,
the sequences are provided in Additional file 4), consistent with its role as a docking site for the bis-SH3 domain
of organizer proteins. In addition, a total of 38 amino
acids were identical in all p22phox sequences (Figure 7A),
suggesting important additional functions, particularly
for the N-terminal regions preceding TM1. Within these
conserved residues, we identified a region rich in arginine
and lysine (Figure 7B), and is therefore designated the
polybasic region (indicated as "basic" in Figure 7A). A
short sequence containing multiple basic amino acid residues has been proposed to contribute to recruitment of
proteins to membrane sub-regions and to function in
receptor-internalization via interaction with phospholipids [84-86]. According to our preliminary data, mutation
in the polybasic region of p22phox did not affect extracellular ROS production from Nox2-transfected human
embryonic kidney 293 cells (T. Kawahara and J. D. Lambeth, unpublished observations). This implies that the
putative conserved region might function in a role unrelated to the enzymatic activity of Nox2, e.g. in phagocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis.

As shown in Figure 1, a p22phox-like protein was not identified in S. purpuratus, but because the genome sequence
of this organism is incomplete and because a p47phox-like
protein with a conserved bis-SH3 domain is present, we
suggest that this organism probably possesses an undiscovered p22phox-like protein, or a protein that serves an
analogous function. Our analysis did not provide con-

vincing evidence for a p22phox isolog in slime mold
amoeba. Lardy et al. argued that this organism may possess a membrane-associated p22phox-like protein (GenBank™ accession number AY221170); predicted p22phoxlike gene-null D. discoideum mutant is unable to produce
spores, similar to nox-null mutants [56]. However according to our analysis, this protein is highly divergent in
amino acid sequence compared with the consensus
sequence obtained from all other organisms, showing disagreement in 24 out of the 38 conserved residues shown
in Figure 7A. Thus, further investigation is needed to judge
whether the gene emerged as a later adaptation or whether
it represents a primitive p22phox gene.
Molecular evolution of domains of Nox organizers and
activators in Deuterostomia
As described above, comparisons of the amino acid
sequences of the Nox regulatory subunit orthologs
revealed certain features of the evolution of characteristic
domains. Some key residues and domains are summarized in Figure 8, which shows the proposed evolution of
organizer and activator proteins. The p47phox orthologs
of all vertebrates (top four left-hand panels in Figure 8)
have identical domain structures, which include the PX
domain, bis-SH3 domain, AIR, and PRR. On the other

hand, the domain composition of NOXO1 (right-hand
panels in Figure 8) changed during the evolution from
fish to tetrapods: the NOXO1 orthologs of tetrapods and
fish all possessed the PX domain, bis-SH3 domain, and
PRR. However, the predicted AIR (including key conserved residues, for details, see Figure 3C) is also present
in O. latipes but is absent in D. rerio and tetrapods (righthand panels in Figure 8). Despite the presence of the AIR
in O. latipes NOXO1, it is clearly distinguished by
sequence homology and synteny from a p47phox isolog,
as shown in Figure 3B. Thus, initially, following gene
duplication from p47phox, NOXO1 retained the AIR regulatory feature of p47phox, and this feature was subsequently lost.
Like vertebrate isologs of p47phox, the p47phox-like proteins of C. intestinalis and S. purpuratus possess the PX
domain, bis-SH3 domain, and AIR. However, these isologs differ considerably in the C-terminal regions that, in
higher forms, interact with p67phox isologs. The C-terminus of the C. intestinalis p47phox lacks the PRR, but motif
scanning by PROSITE [87] demonstrates the p47phox-like
protein contains, instead, additional SH3 domain [residues 340–399 of Ci-p47phox protein, GenBank™ No.
NM_001033828]. The S. purpuratus p47phox-like protein

also lacked the C-terminal PRR, but instead had two additional SH3 domains (residues 367–430 and 561–618 of
Sp-p47phox, GenBank™ No. XP_001183696) separated by
two PRRs (residues 453–460 and 476–484 of Spp47phox) (bottom two left-hand panels in Figure 8).

AD-like domains. Both TRP domains retain conserved
essential Rac-binding residues, but the second AD-like
domain was not well conserved as shown in Figure 5C.
Thus, Rac binding is likely to be an evolutionarily conserved feature among all p67phox/NOXA1 proteins.

All vertebrate orthologs of p67phox have the same
domains seen in human p67phox (Figure 8, left panels).
Importantly, all p67phox and NOXA1 proteins possess the
AD region, which has been shown to be critical for activating superoxide generation in Nox2 and Nox1 [30,31]. The
TPR motif is present in all species, and the two critical residues for Rac-binding, Asp-67 and Arg-102 of human
p67phox [21], are conserved among all vertebrate isologs
of p67phox and NOXA1 (top four panels in Figure 8), supporting the idea that binding to Rac is a conserved feature
of vertebrate p67phox andNOXA1. The N-terminal
domain structures of C. intestinalis and S. purpuratus
p67phox-like proteins are similar to those of vertebrate
p67phox and NOXA1 (Figure 8). Both p67phox-like proteins possess a TPR domain retaining the two critical Racbinding residues (Figure 8). In addition, S. purpuratus
p67phox-like protein possesses a second set of TPR and

In mammals, binding between the PB1 domains of
p67phox and p40phox has been shown to mediate heterodimer formation. The crystal structure of the heterodimer of the PB1 domains from p67phox and p40phox
[32] demonstrated that Lys-355 and Lys-382 in human
p67phox are essential to bind to the PB1 domain of
p40phox, and mutation of Lys-355 of human p67phox
abolished binding to p40phox [76]. These crucial residues
are entirely conserved in the PB1 domains of all vertebrate
p67phox proteins, which imply that they all bind to
p40phox (top four left-hand panels in Figure 8). In contrast to vertebrate p67phox, mammalian NOXA1 does not
retain these two key amino acids (a top right-hand panel
of Figure 8), explaining the failure of NOXA1 to bind to
p40phox [40]. However, the chicken G. gallus, and the fish
D. rerio and O. latipes NOXA1 completely conserve these
two residues, and an OPCA motif of p40phox (Figure 6),

which is essential for binding to the p67phox PB1 domain
are highly conserved. The conservations of key residues
suggest that in these fish, binding to p40phox may be
retained (from the second to fourth panels in right hand
of Figure 8). Thus, the loss of function of p40phox can be
traced in the evolution of NOXA1. Both C. intestinalis and
S. purpuratus p67phox-like proteins lack a PB1 domain,
consistent with the absence of p40phox orthologs.

p22phox; 2) a "Nox-activating region" that contains the
Rac-binding TPR domain and the AD, which together
cooperate to stimulate the activity of the Nox catalytic
domain; and 3) a "regulator-docking region" which uses
evolutionarily variable but paired docking modules that
link the "membrane-binding/cytochrome docking
region" of p47phox to the "Nox-activating region" of
p67phox (bottom panel in Figure 8).

The PX-domain of human p40phox specifically binds to
PtdIns(3)P [23,24,79,80]. Therefore, p40phox accumulates during phagocytosis at early endosomes, which are
rich in PtdIns(3)P [35,81,88]. T. rubripes p40phox is
expressed in a wide range of tissues including the gastrointestinal tissues [89], while Nox2 expression is restricted to
the blood and kidney. Although Nox1 expression in fish
or the other non-mammal organisms is not clear, our
analysis suggest that Nox1 of fish and birds might function, along with the p40phox orthologs, in endocytosis,
e.g., in receptor-internalization. This novel relationship
between Nox1 and p40phox may provide a clue to understanding the physiological role of Nox1 in vertebrates.

Occurrence and origin of Phox-like regulatory subunits
during evolution of Metazoa and Choanoflagellata
In addition to regulatory subunit-dependent Nox proteins
of the Deuterostomia, we assembled predicted regulatory
subunits and the subunit-regulated Nox isolog sequences
present in the genomes of following species: the sea
anemone Nematostella vectensis (N. vectensis), the limpet
Lottia gigantea (L. gigantea), the marine choanoflagellate
Monosiga brevicollis (M. brevicollis) (see Additional files 5,
6, 7, 8). According to the recent phylogeny based on small
ribosomal subunit gene and other molecular tools [90],
the bilaterian animals consist of three clades: Deuterostomia, Lophotrochozoa, and Ecdysozoa. A gastropod snail,
the limpet L. gigantea, belongs to the Lophotrochozoa,
and p67phox, p47phox, p22phox-like genes are found in
this genome (Figure 9A). The predicted motif structures
by the Pfam program are shown in Figure 9B; characteristic motifs of p67phox (TPR domain and AD-like region)
and p47phox (PX domain and AIR-like region) as well as
the key residues (detailed alignments are shown in Additional file 8) are conserved. The genome of L. gigantea also
possesses an ancestral Nox2 gene as a co-ortholog of vertebrate Nox1-3 (Figure 9A and see Additional file 6) like
Nox2 isologs in primitive deuterostomes [1]. On the other
hand, any distinct regulatory subunit genes were not
found in seven species that belongs to Ecdysozoa including two nemotodes (Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae), four insects (Drosophila melanogaster, Apis
mellifera, Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypt), and one noninsect arthropod (the waterflea Daphnia pulex) (Figure
9A).

The vertebrate p67phox and NOXA1 orthologs all have the
C-terminal SH3 domain that, in human, mediates binding to the PRR of p47phox and NOXO1, respectively. This
supports the idea that all of the vertebrate forms of these
proteins mediate protein interactions via tail-to-tail binding between the SH3 domain of the activator protein and
the PRR of the organizer protein. We further suggest that
even though the structures of the C-termini of p47phoxand p67phox-like proteins in C. intestinalis and in S. purpuratus differ from the vertebrate proteins, the same sort of
tail-to-tail binding of these p67phox-like proteins to the
corresponding p47phox-like proteins occurs as diagrammed at the bottom of Figure 8. For example, we suggest that the C-terminal putative PRRs of C. intestinalis
p67phox-like proteins (residues 256–348 of Ci-p67phox
protein, GenBank™ No. NM_001033827) binds to the Cterminal SH3 domain of the p47phox-like protein as indicated by a broken line in Figure 8, reversing the mode of
interaction seen in the vertebrate proteins but accomplishing the same function. Similarly, SH3 domains and
putative PRRs in the C-terminus of S. purpuratus p47phoxlike protein may interact with the PRRs and the SH3
domains in the C-terminus of S. purpuratus p67phox,
respectively. Thus, while domains in the C-termini of
p47phox and p67phox orthologs are not conserved during
evolution, the model shown in Figure 8 suggests that the
"docking function" has been retained. The model suggests
three functional modules within the organizer protein/
activator protein complex: 1), a "membrane-binding/
cytochrome docking region" on the organizer protein that
is comprised of the phospholipids-binding PX domain
and the tandem SH3 region that binds to the PRR of

Before the emergence of bilateral animals, cnidarians split
from the main animal lineage and the genome retained
many of the features present in last common ancestor of
animals [90]. The starlet sea anemone N. vectensis that
belongs to the Cnidaria, conserves p47phox-, p22phoxlike genes, and two ancestral Nox2 genes, Nox2A and 2B
(Figure 9A). The characteristic motifs of the putative regulatory subunits are predicted by the Pfam program and
shown in Figure 9B (alignments are shown in Additional
file 8). N. vectensis p47phox possesses PX and bis-SH3
domains. The isolog also possesses a putative polybasic
region within the sequence corresponding to the AIR of
the human p47phox gene. A polybasic region is a class III
consensus motif for binding to a SH3 domain [91]; there-

fore, this may implicate the polybasic region as a prototype of the AIR. Although the current version of the N.
vectensis genome does not encode an obvious p67phoxlike gene, the presence of multiple SH3 domains in N.
vectensis p47phox points to an unidentified p67phox
ortholog or an unknown PRR-containing binding partner.
Although cnidarians have no specialized immune cells,
the N. vectensis genome possesses orthologous genes to
Toll/Toll-like receptors, complement C3-like molecules,
and a redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factorκB that are orthologs of key components of innate immunity in vertebrates [92]. Further study needs to identify an
original role of Phox-type NADPH oxidase in the primitive multicellular animals.
One clear implication of these genomic and detailed
sequence analyses described above is that the hypothetical
ancestor of primitive animals might conserve the Phoxtype NADPH-oxidase system. In the middle of the nineteenth century, a striking structural resemblance between
the collar cells, so-called "choanocytes", of primitive animal sponges and a group of protists the choanoflagellates
has been noted ([93], reviewed in [94]). A line of recent
phylogenic analyses suggests that the metazoa including
sponges, cnidarians, and other animals constitutes a
monophyletic clade closely related to the Choanoflagellata [90,95,96]; therefore, the choanoflagellates are considered to be the organisms that are close in evolution to
the all modern animals. The unicellular marine choanoflagellate M. brevicollis has been reported as a closer relatives to the hypothetical ancestor of all multicellular
animals based on the comparative analyses of animal-specific genes [97,98]. Interestingly, the genome of M. brevicollis possesses p47phox- and p22phox-like genes (Figures
9A,B), but a BLAST searching in the current M. brevicollis
genomic database failed to identify a dinstinct p67phox
ortholog. Furthermore, Nox2-like gene is present in the
M. brevicollis genome sequence (Figure 9A). Interestingly,
a taxonomy of Nox domains demonstrates that M. brevicollis Nox2-like gene diverges from the monophyletic
clade of all metazoan Nox2 genes containing other ancestral Nox2 and all vertebrate Nox1-3, but it differs from
Nox4 and fungal NoxA/NoxB subfamilies (see Additional
file 6). The M. brevicollis p47phox-like protein possesses
AIR-like region that conserves a serine residue consistent
with a consensus motif of a putative substrate of protein
kinase C (Figure 9C); therefore, this implies that ROS-generating activity of the most primitive Nox2-like protein is
also strictly regulated by phosphorylation as seen in mammalian phagocyte NADPH-oxidase. The physiological
function of the primordial Nox2 enzyme in M. brevicollis
is unknown, but the early appearance of the Phox-like Nox
system in the unicellular flagellate suggests the presence of
a fundamental and essential role of the regulatory subunit-dependent Nox in a unicellular living.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/178

Figure 9A also summarizes the occurrence of Nox4, Nox5,
and Duox isologs in genomes of the metazoa and the choanoflagellate, adding to information published previously
[1]. Duox orthologs are present in all analyzed genomes
of the Bilateria (Figure 9A). Nox5 genes occur broadly in
the genomes of Metazoa, but not in Nematoda. Nox4
genes appear after the emergence of chordates, but is not
seen in the echinoderm S. purpuratus [1] (Figure 1A).
Interestingly, gene search that covers a wide range demonstrates that Nox4-like genes are also present in a lophotrochozoan (L. gigantea), a cnidarian (N. vectensis), but not in
the ecdysozoans (see Figure 9A, and the taxonomy of Nox
is shown in Additional file 6). The choanoflagellate M.
brevicolli do not possess Nox4, Nox5, and Duox orthologs,
at least based on the current genomic database. In the
kingdom Plantae, the moss Physcomitrella patens (P. patens) possess double EF-hand- containing Noxes like the
higher land plants Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) and
Oryza sativa (O. sativa) (Figure 9A). Despite a kingdom
distinct from plants, the oomycete Phytophthora sojae (P.
sojae) also possesses single or double EF-hand(s)-containing Noxes [55,99], at least three genes (Figure 9A). Here
we referred to them as P. patens and P. sojae rboh (respiratory burst oxidase homolog) to represent the remarkable
resemblance to the higher plant Noxes, so-called rboh, in
the respects of taxonomy of the Nox domains (Additional
file 6). In the kingdoms Plantae and Chomista, a distinct
regulatory subunit was not seen. However, higher plant
genomes possess a novel protein family conserved
domain structures similar to p67phox as descried below.
Naegleria gruberi (N. gruberi) is a widespread soil and
freshwater amoeboflagellate that belongs to the phylum
Perocolozoa, the kingdom Protozoa [100]. Although N.
gruberi is a free-living organism, it is not related to species
of the phylum Amoebozoa with sequenced genomes,
such as D. discoideum and Entamoeba histolytica, but it is
close to pathogenic relatives (e.g. Naegleria fowleri) that
can cause amoebic meningitis. We identified single Nox
gene of N. gruberi from the genome (Figure 9A), together
with five putative Fre ortholog genes that have similar
domain structures to that of Nox domain (see Additional
file 9). According to a phylogenetic taxonomy of Nox
domain, the N. gruberi Nox is close to D. discoideum NoxA/
NoxB proteins (see Additional file 6); therefore, it is
referred to as N. gruberi NoxA (Figure 9A). Nox regulatory
subunit gene has not been found in the current version of
genomic database, but it might contain a prototype of regulatory subunits according to the Nox taxonomy.
SH3PXD2 as a p47phox family member
As shown in Figure 9, a choanoflagellate and primitive
animals possess p47phox-like genes as well as ancestral
Nox2 and PRR-containing p22phox genes. On the other
hand, further BLASTP search in the animal genomes using
the M. brevicolli p47phox-like protein sequence suggested

the presence of a protein family proteins related to the
primitive p47phox in higher animals, encoding the "SH3
and PX domains 2" protein (SH3PXD2) (sequences and
alignments are provided in Additional files 10 and 11,
respectively). The encoded protein is composed of an N-

two or three additional SH3 domains in the C-terminal
half of the molecule (see the motif structure in Figure

zoan species (Figures 10A and 10B). In vertebrates, two
isozymes SH3PXD2a and 2b were found (Figure 10A).
Interestingly the M. brevicollis p47phox-like gene and other
primitive animal p47phox-like genes are related more
closely to the SH3PXD2 gene subfamily than to the vertebrate p47phox and NOXO1 subfamilies (Figure 10A). The
physiological function of SH3PXD2a is suggested by only
a few papers; human SH3PXD2a protein (a.k.a. Tks5) is
involved in the protease-driven invasion of cancer cells
and the neurotoxicity induced by amyloid-beta
[101,102]. A protein binding to SH3PXD2a is also little
known, but recently N-WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
protein) was proposed as a candidate that binds to the
third SH3 domain of the human SH3PXD2a [101]. The
physiological role as well as the binding partner of
SH3PXD2b is unknown. However, the clear phylogenetic
relationship of the SH3PXD2 gene family to the larger
family of Nox-regulatory organizing proteins suggests that
the genes might be involved in regulating Nox activity.
Alternatively, SH3PXD2 proteins may have diverged to
perform unrelated functions (e.g., to regulate other
enzymes or signaling pathways). Thus, the M. brevilcollis
p47phox-like protein evolved from a hypothetical p47phox
ancestor, and the SH3PXD2 genes diverged from the lineage of the p47phox-like gene following the emergence of
chordates but prior to NOXO1 (Figure 10B). The vertebrate p47phox and NOXO1 were somehow able to eliminate the additional SH3 domains in the "regulatordocking region", as proposed in Figure 8.
What is the regulatory subunit binding partner for fungal
NOXR?
Fungi (A. nidulans, M. grisea, and F. graminearum) belong
to Ascomycota [55] and possess the NOXR gene as a
p67phox ortholog (Figure 9A). NOXR encodes a PB1
domain homologous to that in p67phox, but these organisms do not possess a p40phox ortholog (see Figure 1A).
As shown in Figure 5E, two important basic residues in the
PB1 domains are conserved in all NOXR proteins. The
conservation of these residues implies the existence of an
unknown NOXR binding partner(s) containing a PB1
domain with an OPCA motif (Figure 11A). A BLAST
search of a database of computationally predicted amino
acid sequences [103] from the genomes of A. nidulans, M.
grisea, and F. graminearum was performed using as a query
sequence the PB1 domain of human p40phox (residues
237–339; GenBank™ No. NP_000622). In addition to
NOXR, three sequences harboring PB1 domains were
identified in the fungi. These were: "SH3-SH3-PX-SRRPB1", "CDC24-RhoGEF-PB1" and "(CBS)n-PB1" proteins
(Figure 11B and see Additional file 12), so-named for
their domain structures in sequence from N- to C-termini.
SRR indicates a serine-rich region. The three predicted
proteins were encoded in all three fungal genomes, and all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/178

three possessed acidic OPCA motifs in their PB1 domains
(Figure 11C).
The "SH3-SH3-PX-SRR-PB1" protein contains a similar
domain structure to yeast S. cerevisiae Bem1p (Bud Emergence 1, GenBank™ accession number NP_009759), but
differs in that the PB1 domain of S. cerevisiae Bem1p does
not contain the OPCA motif [76]. A speculative model for
the regulation of fungal Nox by the Bem1 ortholog is
shown in Figure 11D, wherein Bem1 ortholog is proposed
to play a role as an organizer protein, analogous to the
roles of p47phox and p40phox in mammals. According to
this model, PB1-PB1 interaction mediates the linkage
between the "regulator-docking regions" suggested in Figure 8. PX-domain of the S. cerevisiae Bem1 facilitates a
protein to anchor to a membrane lipid layer [104]. Fungi
do not have a PRR-containing p22phox ortholog (see Figure 1A), but NoxA and NoxB in the three fungi has a distinctive highly conserved a class II PRR motif [91] (e.g.
423–428 residues of Mg-NoxA) and class III (e.g. 447–
452 residues of Mg-NoxB) near the predicted NADPHbinding sub-regions [1]. Thus the hypothetical functions
of the bis-SH3 and PX domains indicate the analogous
function as a "membrane-binding/cytochrome docking
region" of Nox organizer. Because S. cerevisiae Bem1 is
involved in establishment of cell polarity [105], the proposed interaction between fungal NOXR and Bem1
orthologs may point to a function of Nox-derived ROS in
cell polarity.
A second model is suggested by the "CDC24-RhoGEFPB1" protein, which is an ortholog of S. cerevisiae Cdc24p
(GenBank™ accession number AAA82871). According to
this "exchanger model", the PB1-mediated heterodimer
formation localizes the RhoGEF domain which then catalyzes the conversion of Rac-GDP to the active Rac-GTP
(Figure 11E). The model is supported by a recent report
showed that fungal NOXR binds to the fungal Rac homologue in the GTP form [57].
An "energy sensor" function for NOXR is shown in Figure
11F, and is based on the occurrence of the CBS (cystathione beta-synthase) domain in the putative binding partner. The CBS domain senses cellular energy status by
binding adenosine nucleotides; it occurs in a range of proteins including AMP-activated protein kinase, which is
activated by AMP and inhibited by ATP via the CBS
domain [106,107]. Such a function might be related to
the requirement of Nox enzyme for reduced pyridine
nucleotide, thus affecting cellular energetics.
Fungal Nox and NOXR isologs are seen not only in fungi
belonging to Ascomycota, but also some basidiomycetes
[55]. To explore the likelihood of the fungal Nox activation mechanisms suggested in Figure 11, the occurrence of

NOXR, Bem1, Cdc24, and CBSn-PB1 isologs were compared in 13 fungal genomes spanning the four fungal divisions: Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota, and
Chytridiomycota (sequences are shown in Additional file
12). Bem1, Cdc24, and CBSn-PB1 genes are present in
most of the fungal genomes, with the exception of Cdc24
in Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (B. dendrobatidis), and
these proteins all conserved the PB1 domains with some
exceptions; Y. lipolytica NOXR and Coprinopsis cinerea
Cdc24 isologs lack the PB1 domain (Figure 12). In addition to the absence of Nox and NOXR isolog genes in S.
cerevisiae, the Nox and NOXR isologs are absent in the
genomes of Candida albicans, Yarrowia lipolytica (Y. lipolytica) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) [55]. A Nox

gene is absent in the genomes of Y. lipolytica and Phycomyces blakesleeanus (P. blakesleeanus) despite the presence of
NOXR isologs [55]. The P. blakesleeanus genome possesses
two Bem1 and CBS-PB1 genes and all conserved the PB1
domains. We investigated the conservation of two basic
residues of the PB1 domain corresponding to the Lys-355
and -382 residues of human p67phox and the four acidic
residues in OPCA motif corresponding to the Asp-289,
Glu-291, and Asp-293, -302 residues of human p40phox.
Comparison of the PB1 domains in these fungal proteins
by alignment and analyses by the Pfam program demonstrate that the two basic and four acidic residues are conserved in the fungal NOXR, Bem1, Cdc24, and CBSn-PB1
with a few exceptions; the OPCA motifs in Bem1 isologs

of the motif strongly implies that these PB1 domains

functional studies will clarify the roles of these proteins in
fungal Nox functions.

[20,109-111]. Another interesting point of the Dd-PB1-A
protein is to contain the F-box and a WD40 repeat regions
that function as a ubiquitin ligase component E3. Further
investigations to identify a binding partner will lead to
understand functional relationships between Nox and the
Dd-PB1 proteins.

Predicted binding partners for D. discoideum p67-like
protein
Like fungal NOXRs, the PB1 domain of D. discoideum p67like protein also possesses two basic residues, Lys-313 and
Lys-340 residues, as shown in Figure 5E. A BLAST search
demonstrates that the D. discoideum genome possesses
five predicted PB1 domain-containing proteins (referred
to here as "Dd-PB1-A to -E"). All except Dd-PB1-D conserve the OPCA motif (Figure 13, and see details in Additional file 15). Dd-PB1-A protein (GenBank No.
XP_639165) is partially identical to D. discoideum MEK
kinase α (GenBank No. AAC97114) [108]. It is possible
that the serine/threonine kinase domain might phosphorylate the amoebal Noxes or the p67-like protein to stimulate ROS generation, analogous to other regulatory

However, there is no report of Phox-related regulatory subunit homologs in plant genomes. Unexpectedly BLAST

(Figure 14A, and see the alignment in Additional file 17).

heteromeric or homomeric complex via PB1-PB1-interaction. In addition to the hypo-p67-L gene family, the A.
thaliana genome possessed at least 27 isolated genes
encoding the PB1 domain [e.g. protein kinase family protein (GenBank No. NP_200569), CBSn-PB1 ortholog
(GenBank No. NP_181191), see Additional file 18].
Alignment of putative AD-like domains of the A. thaliana
proteins with human p67phox and NOXA1 show that the
A. thaliana hypo-p67-L1 and -L2 proteins conserve the
functionally critical valine residue (Figure 14B). Moreover, a lysine residue corresponding to Lys-196 of human
p67phox that is correlated to the appearance of functional
PB1 domain is also conserved in two of them (Figure
14B). On the other hand, the sequences do not conserve
residues in the TPR domain known to be essential for
binding to Rac [10]. Biological functions for this putative

Conclusion
In summary, we reported here an exhaustive analysis of
the Phox-related regulatory subunits for Nox enzymes
from a total of 32 species in the Eukaryota including 10
vertebrates. The present study, viewed in the context of the
evolution of Noxes [1], reveals that regulatory subunits
co-evolved with their respective Noxes; Nox2 with
p67phox/p47phox; Nox1 with NOXO1/NOXA1; ancestral
Nox2 as co-ortholog of vertebrate Nox1-3 with p67phox/
p47phox-like proteins; fungal and amoebal NoxA/B with
NOXR (and possibly new components). By comparing
amino acid sequences of the regulatory subunits, putative
key amino acid residues and conserved region previously
undefined were identified, e.g. ADSIS. These conserved
residues are likely to be important in conserved catalytic
or regulatory functions of Nox proteins, although, the
detailed biochemical roles of most of these residues are
not yet fully understood. The analysis of the Phox-related
regulatory subunits points to a novel evolutionary history
of Nox regulatory proteins. The earliest Nox2 and
p47phox- and p22phox-like genes are appearing in the unicellular choanoflagellate before the emergence of the
metazoa. Duplication of primordial p47phox- and

p67phox-like genes occurred in vertebrates, resulting in the
emergence of NOXO1-p47phox and NOXA1-p67phox
genes, respectively. Supporting this evolutionary origin,
the NOXO1 protein in the fish O. latipes still retains the
p47phox-characteristic "AIR". A predicted motif structure
of ancestral p47phox suggests a greatly expanded family of
p47phox including SH3PXD2 in the animal lineages.
Detailed sequence analyses proposed an evolution model
that p40phox originally participated in regulating both
Nox1 and Nox2 in early vertebrates, but in mammals the
regulation of Nox1 became independent of p40phox.
Thus, this report provides keys to understand the evolutionary history of Nox and the regulatory subunits, and
provides new information that may be useful in elucidating new molecular details of the activation mechanisms of
Nox enzymes including the human orthologs.
Note: While we were in the process of revising this manuscript, a review article about structure and function of the
PB1 domain appeared [116]. The review will help to
understand the structural features of the PB1 domain that
are often mentioned in the present study. In the article,
authors also described the presence of the hypothetical
genes coding TPR and PB1 domain-containing proteins in
the A. thaliana genomes and argued about a possibility of
A. thaliana p67phox.

BLASTP searches were performed to obtain predicted regulatory subunits, related Nox genes (including genes that
has been reported such as P. sojae rboh [99], C. merolae
rboh1/2 [118], P. tricornutum rboh1 [118]), new regulator-binging partners, using the NCBI protein database for
vertebrates, C. intestinalis, C. briggsae, D. discoideum, A.

(A. nidulans, M. grisea, F. graminearum, S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, Y. lipolytica, S. pombe, C. cinerea) [119], the Doe Joint
Genome Institute database for L. bicolor, P. placenta, D.
pulex, N. vectensis, L. gigantea, M. brevicollis, P. blakesleeanus, P. sojae, P. tricornutum, P. patens [120], and the Broad
Institute FGI database for P. graminis and B. dendrobatidis
[121]. Sequences that had more than 50% identity to the
sequence of the closest template were chosen as orthologs
or isologs. Assembled sequences, including newly
defined, were annotated based on molecular taxonomy
analysis of the domains characteristic in each regulator.
Characteristic motifs of the regulatory subunits are predicted by the Pfam program [122]. All amino acid

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
were carried out with ClustalW [123] and trees were
reconstructed by the neighbor-joining method as previously described [1]. Amino acid sequences of regulatory
subunits were trimmed and aligned to the domains indicated in each figure. Bootstrap values of 1,000 replications
are shown at the branches as percentages. Equivalent to
0.1 amino acid substitutions per site indicate evolutionary
distances as inferior bars. To elucidate the synteny, we
used the Ensembl AlignSliceView program [124]. Conserved marker genes among the genomes of vertebrates
are defined (see Additional file 2).
