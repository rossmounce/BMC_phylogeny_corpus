Abstract
Background: Recombination between hepatitis C single stranded RNA viruses is a rare event.
Natural viable intragenotypic and intergenotypic recombinants between 1b-1a, 1a-1c and 2k-1b, 2i6p, respectively, have been reported. Diagnostically recombinants represent an intriguing challenge.
Hepatitis C genotype is defined by interrogation of the sequence composition of the 5' untranslated
region [5'UTR]. Occasionally, ambiguous specimens require further investigation of the genome,
usually by interrogation of the NS5B region. The original purpose of this study was to confirm the
existence of a suspected mixed genotype infection of genotypes 2 and 4 by clonal analysis at the
NS5B region of the genome in two specimens from two separate individuals. This initial
identification of genotype was based on analysis of the 5'UTR of the genome by reverse line probe
hybridisation [RLPH].
Results: The original diagnosis of a mixed genotype infection was not confirmed by clonal analysis
of the NS5B region of the genome. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that both specimens were
natural intergenotypic recombinant forms of HCV. The recombination was between genotypes 2k
and 1b for both specimens. The recombination break point was identified as occurring within the
NS2 region of the genome.
Conclusion: The viral recombinants identified here resemble the recombinant form originally
identified in Russia. The RLPH pattern observed in this study may be a signature indicative of this
particular type of intergenotype recombinant of hepatitis C meriting clonal analysis of NS2.

Background
Hepatitis C virus infects approximately 170 million individuals' world wide [1]. Chronicity develops in 50–80%
of infections [2,3]. Hepatitis C exists as a family of viruses,
divided into 6 genotypes each with multiple subtypes [4].
The management and treatment of chronic hepatitis C

virus [HCV] is in part guided by the genotype of the infecting virus [5,6]. The requirement for liver biopsy can be
guided by genotype. Current therapeutic options of
pegylated interferon and ribavirin have a population efficacy of only 50% [7]. Genotype 2 and 3 respond with efficacy of 80% in clinical trials. Duration of therapy is

determined by genotype. Individuals infected with either
genotype 1 or 4 usually have to undergo treatment for 48
weeks, while genotypes 2 and 3 usually have treatment
duration of 24 weeks. There are several methods which
can be used to determine viral genotype among which, (a)
DNA sequencing of amplicons from the 5'untranslated
region [5'UTR] (b) restriction length fragment polymorphism analysis and (c) Reverse Line Probe Hybridization
[RLPH] [8]. Determination of viral genotype using RLPH
can readily identify rare mixed genotype infections [9].
On occasion non-specific reactivity between probes and
amplicons can give an indication of an apparent mixed
genotype infection. However, upon repeat with additional specimens these ambiguities usually resolve to a
single genotype infection. RLPH may infrequently yield
ambiguous patterns which required further investigation.
It may be possible to discriminate between very similar
isolates by extension of the analysis to additional regions
of the genome [10]. Alternatively, there are genotype specific motifs present within NS5B which can then be used
to delineate strain genotype.

Results and Discussion
Following routine RLPH of specimen HC9A98987 it was
noticed that an unusual banding pattern indicative of a
putative genotype 2 and 4 mixed infection was evident
[Figure 1]. This interpretation is based on the fact that the
banding at positions 9, 10, and 11 are indicative of a genotype 2a/c. However, a specimen of genotype 2a/c can
also have a pattern of 5, 9, 10 and 11. In addition, a banding pattern of 6 and 16 is usually indicative of a genotype
4a, also, 5 and 16 is indicative of a specimen of genotype
4e. There is no banding pattern to support the existence of
a genotype 1 within this isolate. The genotype determination was repeated on several occasions for this specimen
and on an additional specimen from the same patient
(results not shown) all of which yielded the same banding
pattern. The DNA sequence analysis of the 5'UTR indicated that the specimen was of genotype 2, GenBank
[DQ417427], with no definable subtype or indication of
a mixed genotype infection with a strain of genotype 4. In
light of this fact, clonal analysis of the NS5B region from
HC9A98987 was undertaken. 14 clones were sequenced
[DQ417439–DQ417452]. A search for similarities with
previously published sequences was performed with the
program Blast. [11] The results indicated that this region
of the genome had homology to sequences of HCV 1b
[e.g., D50485, AF31916] and not the expected genotype 2
or 4. The corresponding amino acid sequences analysis
indicated that there were only 7 unique isolates, GenBank
[DQ417439, DQ417443, DQ417446, DQ417447,
DQ417449, DQ417451, DQ417452].

pattern observed was 5, 6 (weak), 9–11, 16. A banding pattern of 5, 9–11 is indicative of a genotype 2a/2c infection,
while banding at positions 6 and 16 are usually indicative of a
genotype 4a infection and banding at positions 5 and 16 can
be indicative of a genotype 4e. The nitrocellulose strip most

[DQ417434–DQ417438] indicated that these regions of
the genome were in fact homologous to viruses within the
2k subtype [e.g., AB031663]. Two clones from the core
region had synonymous mutations [DQ417430,
DQ417433]. The HCV 2k [e.g., AB031663] isolate has a
relatively high prevalence in the countries of the former
USSR. Kalinina et al reported in 2002 the identification of
a natural intergenotypic recombinant form of HCV which
had homology to 2k at the 5' end of the genome and to 1b
at the 3' end of the genome [12]. The cross over point was
identified as occurring within the NS2 region by Simplot
by Kalinina [12].

D50485 (1b)] and a phylogenetic analysis was carried
out. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the NEIGHBOR program in the PHYLIP package and genetic distances were calculated with PRODIST program in the
PHYLIP package based on Kimura's distance. [13] The
results indicated clearly that sequences corresponding to
specimen HC9A98987 are related to genotype 2k in the
core and HVR1 region (data not shown) and closely
related to genotype 1b in the NS5B region [Figure 2]. All
of these three regions are highly homologous with
AY587845 (2k/1b) the recombinant form initially identified in Russia [12].

Following these observations, the core, the HVR1 and the
NS5B amino acid sequences from HC9A98987 were
aligned against reference strains of different genotypes
[AY587845 (2k/1b), AB031663 (2k), AF313916 (1b) and

To investigate if specimen HC9A98987 was a possible
recombinant form of HCV, primers were designed with
the Primer3 program [14] to span the previously identified recombination point. A product of the expected 346

bp [3168–3413, reference strain [AY587845] (2k/1b)]
was recovered by nested RT-PCR [Table 1]. The amplicon
was cloned and the DNA sequence from 5 clones examined. Four of the 5 clones were found to be identical at the
level of amino acid sequence [DQ839386–DQ839389]
with a minor quasispecies [DQ839390]. Sequence analysis indicated that this region of specimen HC9A98987 is
homologous with the reference strain [AY587845] [Figure
3]. The recombinant form identified here likely shares the
same cross over point as the RF_2k/1b reported by
Kalinina [12]. This is the first independent identification
of this natural intergenotypic recombinant of HCV
between 2k/1b.
Following the identification of HC9A98987 as a recombinant form of HCV similar to AY587845 (2k/1b), the
laboratory investigated whether an additional specimen
(hence, HC9A99966) from another individual with the
same RLPH pattern was also a candidate natural intergenotypic recombinant form. Clonal analysis of the NS2
region was performed on this specimen from the second
patient (HC9A99966). The sequences of six clones were
determined. All six clones were of identical nucleotide
sequence [DQ904446] and were found by sequence analysis to be homologous to the natural intergenotypic
recombinant related to HC9A98987, i.e., AY587845 (2k/
1b) [Figure 3].
While, the prevalence of the 2k/1b recombinant form of
HCV is globally low, its existence poses an interesting
challenge as to what anti-viral regimen should be followed. Mechanistically the identification of a recombinant strain of HCV, a single stranded RNA virus, poses
some interesting questions. The initial recombination
event had to happen in a hepatocyte infected with a 2k
and a 1b isolate. Recombination had to maintain the
reading frame of the polyprotein. The majority of recombination events would be expected to yield fatal nucle-

otide lesions generating life cycle incompetent virions. It
is interesting to hypothesize that perhaps the generation
of this recombinant form of HCV is the result of "strand
switching" during replication rather than classical recombination-ligation of viral RNA as previously proposed
[15].
An additional natural intergenotypic recombinant
between genotypes 2i and 6p has very recently been
described [16]. The recombination break point was again
narrowed down to a region at the 3' end of the NS2 gene,
possibly extending into the NS3 gene. It is currently evident that the viable recombination occurs infrequently in
HCV biology. The frequency of this phenomenon may be
under estimated. In an attempt to estimate the prevalence
of HCV recombinants Cristina and Colina recently
reported the identification of an intragenotypic recombinant between 1a and 1c by examining only 89 full
length sequences, representative of all genotypes present
in the LANL database [17,18]. These results may give an
insight into the actual prevalence of HCV recombinant
forms but would require prospective examination to verify the findings. Molecular characterisation of these natural chimeras may yet yield some unique insights into life
cycle of hepatitis C. Recombinant forms for HIV do not
have the same sensitivity to anti-retroviral therapy as wild
type HIV-1 clade B isolates [19]. The sensitivity of recombinant forms of HCV to pegylated interferon based therapy is unknown. Intergenotypic recombinant isolates that
have genotype 1 as part of the genomic backbone will
likely require a conservative approach, with patients being
treated for 48 rather than 24 weeks.

Conclusion
The diagnostic standard for determining HCV genotype,
irrespective of methodology, is to interrogate the
sequence of the 5'UTR. The serendipitous identification of
two recombinant forms of HCV, related to the Russian 2k/

1b recombinant form, in Ireland was the result of a

confirmation of genotype by interrogation of the NS5B to
ensure that management of chronic HCV is optimal.

Methods
HCV Genotyping
The specimens referred to in this manuscript were
received as part of the routine diagnostic services provided
by the Molecular Virology Diagnostic and Research Laboratory to Cork University Hospital. The viral status of all
specimens received by the diagnostic laboratory are qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. Subsequent to confirmation of viraemia, specimens are routinely genotyped
by RLPH (Versant-Bayer, UK) [20]. The specimens used
during the study outlined here are HC9A98987 and

HC9A99966, each from separate unrelated individuals
originally from Russia and Georgia, respectively, but resident in Ireland at the time of sample acquisition.
RT-PCR
The RNA (QIAGEN, UK. Qiamp viral RNA) was randomly
primed to generate cDNA with AMV reverse transcriptase
(Promega, USA). Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, USA)
was used to amplify the core, HVR1 and NS5B amplicons.
Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche, UK) was used to amplify
the NS2 amplicon. The primers used to amplify the core
and the NS2 regions are listed in Table 1. The primers used
to amplify the HVR1 region were described by Farci et al
[21]. The core, the HVR1 and the NS2 primary and secondary PCRs were carried out under the following conditions: 94°C for 3 min., 35 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 60°C
(core), 62°C (HVR1) 55°C (primary PCR NS2) or 58°C
(secondary PCR NS2) for 30 s and elongation at 72°C for
45 s; a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min. completed the
PCR. To amplify the NS5B region, a hemi-nested PCR was

performed using primers Pr3, Pr4 first described by
Morice et al and Pr5 designed by Sandres-Saune et al under
the following PCR conditions: 95°C for 5 min., 35 cycles
of 95°C for 30 s, 58°C (primary PCR with Pr3 and Pr4) or
55°C (secondary PCR with Pr3 and Pr5) for 30 s and elongation at 72°C for 30 s; a final elongation at 72°C for 10
min. completed the PCR [22,23]. 5'UTR sequence was
determined following amplification of the region from
position -299 to 6nt (based on prototype strain
M632321).
