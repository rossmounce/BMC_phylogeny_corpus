Abstract
Background: Worldwide, hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 is observed in pigs and transmission
to humans is implied. To be able to estimate public health risks from e.g. contact with pigs or
consumption of pork products, the transmission routes and dynamics of infection should be
identified. Hence, the course of HEV-infection in naturally infected pigs should be studied.
Results: To resemble natural transmission, 24 HEV-susceptible pigs were infected either by oneto-one exposure to intravenously inoculated pigs (C1-pigs; n = 10), by one-to-one exposure to
contact-infected pigs (C2-pigs: n = 7; C3-pigs: n = 5) or due to an unknown non-intravenous
infection route (one C2-pig and one C3-pig). The course of HEV-infection for contact-infected pigs
was characterized by: faecal HEV RNA excretion that started at day 7 (95% confidence interval: 5–
10) postexposure and lasted 23 (19–28) days; viremia that started after 13 (8–17) days of faecal
HEV RNA excretion and lasted 11 (8–13) days; antibody development that was detected after 13
(10–16) days of faecal HEV RNA excretion. The time until onset of faecal HEV RNA excretion and
onset of viremia was significantly shorter for iv-pigs compared to contact-infected pigs, whereas the
duration of faecal HEV RNA excretion was significantly longer. At 28 days postinfection HEV RNA
was detected less frequently in organs of contact-infected pigs compared to iv-pigs. For contactinfected pigs, HEV RNA was detected in 20 of 39 muscle samples that were proxies for pork at
retail and in 4 of 7 urine samples.
Conclusion: The course of infection differed between infection routes, suggesting that contactinfection could be a better model for natural transmission than iv inoculation. Urine and meat were
identified as possible HEV-sources for pig-to-pig and pig-to-human HEV transmission.

Background
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive sense, non-enveloped
single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of 7.2 kb and
can be grouped into at least four genotypes [1]. Hepatitis
E virus was considered to be restricted to developing countries, but it is now considered an emerging pathogen in
developed countries [e.g. [2]]. The epidemiology of HEV,
however, differs between developed and developing
countries [1]. In developing countries all four genotypes
of HEV are found in locally acquired hepatitis E cases,
whereas in developed countries locally acquired HEV
cases are caused by genotypes 3 and 4 [3]. HEV infections
with genotypes 1 and 2 are implicated in both epidemic
and sporadic cases of HEV infection, whereas genotypes 3
and 4 have been only implicated in sporadic cases so far.
Sources for these sporadic cases in industrialized countries
are uncertain. The absence of person-to-person transmission of HEV genotype 3 among 18 household members of
acute hepatitis E patients in the Netherlands [4] suggests
that human HEV infections acquired in the Netherlands
are of environmental origin rather than person-to-person
transmission. Worldwide, HEV has been reported in environmental sources, including surface water [5], animal
species including domestic pigs and wild boar [6], sewage
of animal origin [7], and foods of animal origin [8-12].
Zoonotic foodborne HEV transmission via wild deer meat
has been proven [13], but not from other environmental
sources. An increased anti-HEV seroprevalence in people
working professionally with pigs [14,15] and presence of
infectious HEV in commercial porcine livers at retail [11]
however, suggests that swine may be a source of human
exposure to HEV. Based on the phylogenetic similarity
between HEV-sequences from human and swine, interspecies transmission was suggested [16,17].
In the Netherlands, about 7.5 × 106 fattening pigs are
raised annually [18]. HEV RNA was observed in faeces
from >50% of Dutch fattening pig farms [19] and HEV has
a high transmission potential among domestic swine
[20]. Therefore, domestic swine may be an important reservoir for human HEV infections, but to which extent is
currently unknown. To be able to estimate the public
health risk using field data on the occurrence of HEV in
pigs, the natural course of HEV infection in pigs needs to
be known. Several studies have presented experimental
data for intravenously (iv) inoculated pigs, showing onset
of faecal HEV RNA excretion at one to two weeks postinoculation and onset of viremia at two to three weeks postinoculation [21-25]. Faecal HEV RNA excretion may last
up to 7 weeks, whereas viremia is detected generally for
one to three weeks [22,24]. Faecal HEV RNA excretion is
observed in all pigs after iv inoculation, but viremia and
antibody development are not observed in all iv inoculated pigs. Antibodies to HEV infection are detected
between two and eight weeks postinoculation [22,23,26].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/5/7

Increased liver enzyme levels in serum are generally not
observed in iv inoculated pigs [21-23,25].
However, whether iv inoculated pigs display a course of
HEV infection that resembles that of naturally infected
pigs (presumably via the faecal-oral route [1]) is currently
unknown. Direct oral inoculation of HEV in pigs has been
unsuccessful in all but one pig [24]. This pig received a
dose of at least 108 HEV genome equivalents (one genome
equivalent was defined as the number of HEV genomes
present in the highest serial dilution positive by RT-PCR),
whereas two other pigs that received this dose remained
uninfected. Contact-exposure of a susceptible pig with an
infectious pig appears to lead to HEV infection more easily than direct oral inoculation [22-24]. Thus, the use of
contact-infected pigs may be a good alternative to study
the course of HEV infection for naturally infected pigs.
Contact-infected pigs are likely to reflect the natural
course of HEV-infection more accurately than iv inoculated pigs.
The aim of the current study was to describe the course of
HEV infection in contact-infected pigs by estimating the
time until and the duration of faecal HEV RNA excretion
and viremia and the time until antibody development.
Localization of HEV in the pig and liver enzyme levels in
serum were also assessed. As iv inoculated pigs were used
to generate first-, second- and third-generation contactinfected pigs [20], the data for contact-infected pigs were
compared to those for iv inoculated pigs to identify possible differences in the course of infection due to infection
route.

Results
Statistics describing the course of HEV infection
The time until and the duration of faecal HEV RNA excretion and viremia, and the time until antibody development were estimated for contact-infected and iv-pigs
(Table 1). No statistical differences were observed
between C1-pigs and C2/3-pigs (data not shown), and
therefore data for all contact-infected pigs were pooled.
Statistical differences between the two blocks were
observed for the five parameter estimates. Statistical differences were observed between contact-infected pigs and
iv-pigs for two parameters in both blocks, whereas one
parameter differed significantly between contact-infected
pigs and iv-pigs in one block only (Table 1). To conclude
whether an overall difference between contact-infected
pigs and iv-pigs existed, joint p-values were calculated.
Overall differences were observed for time until onset of
faecal HEV RNA excretion and viremia, and duration of
faecal HEV RNA excretion.

From the first faecal HEV RNA excretion onwards, the
course of the HEV RNA-titre in faeces and serum, and the

development of detectable antibodies were similar for ivpigs and contact-infected pigs (Fig. 1 and 2).
AST and ALT levels in serum
No instant elevations in serum ALT- or AST-levels were
observed for the seven contact-infected pigs and five ivpigs when the values obtained were related to the baseline
values for fattening pigs (data not shown). However, the
presence of an increasing trend was assessed per pig by
ordinary linear regression, showing a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in serum ALT-levels during the
period of faecal HEV RNA excretion for one contactinfected pig necropsied 55 days after first faecal HEV RNA
excretion and for three iv-pigs (nos. 6, 7 and 9 in Tables 2
and 3). The differences in minimum and maximum values for these pigs were 14, 42, 38 and 29 U l-1. The other
8 pigs did not show an increasing trend for ALT-levels and
none of the pigs for AST-levels.
HEV RNA in tissues, urine and bile
Five C2-pigs and five iv-pigs were necropsied at 28 days
post infection to collect tissue samples, urine and bile
(Table 2). HEV RNA was found less often in samples of
C2-pigs (24 of 74) than in samples of iv-pigs (58 of 74).
Remarkably however, urine of three C2-pigs tested HEV
RNA-positive (with Ct values of 37, 38 and 31 for pigs no.
1, 4 and 5, respectively), as opposed to none of the iv-pigs.
Sequences of the RT-PCR fragments were obtained for the
three samples by cloning and sequencing, and were
homologous to the inoculated HEV strain.

At 56 dpi, HEV RNA was detected in urine, the bronchial
and hepatic lymph nodes and the spleen of both iv-pigs.
Furthermore, HEV RNA was present in the faeces of one of
the two pigs, the other showed HEV RNA in the ileum,
jejunum and the mesenteric lymph node. The C1-pig
necropsied at 55 days after first faecal HEV RNA excretion
showed HEV RNA in the kidney and the C1-pig necropsied at 65 days showed HEV RNA only in urine. Interestingly, both urine specimens of the iv-pigs and one urine

specimen of the C1-pig contained HEV RNA at necropsy.
The urine specimen of the iv-pigs both showed a Ct >40,
whereas the specimen of the C1-pig showed a Ct of 32.5.
This C1-pig had stopped excretion of HEV in faeces about
4 weeks earlier. Clones with correct inserts were obtained
for RT-PCR fragments detected in urine of the C1-pig. Subsequent sequencing showed homology to the HEV
sequence of the inoculated strain.
HEV RNA in muscle samples
HEV RNA was detected in 12 of 20 biceps femoris muscle
samples, in 11 of 20 iliopsoas muscle samples and in 9 of
20 longissimus muscle samples at various time-points
after infection (Table 3). Muscle samples were found positive in contact-infected pigs up until 32 days after first faecal HEV RNA excretion. Out of 14 liver-positive pigs, 13
tested positive in at least one muscle sample (and eight in
all three muscle samples), while five out of six liver-negative animals tested negative in all muscle samples. In addition, HEV RNA was detected in examined serum samples
in all but one pig (no. 8) that showed HEV RNA-positive
muscle samples.
Histopathology
No gross pathological changes were observed in any of the
examined pigs. By histopathology, moderate, multifocal,
lymphohistiocytic hepatitis was observed in livers from
two of five C2-pigs (nos. 4 and 5 in Table 2) and three of
five iv-pigs (nos. 6, 9 and 10) after necropsy at 28 days
postinfection. In addition, slight subepithelial lymphohistiocytic cell infiltrations were observed in the gall bladder of one C2-pig and one iv-pig necropsied at 28 days
post infection, and of one C1-pig necropsied at 55 days
after first faecal HEV RNA excretion. In the ileum a mild
or moderate hyperplasia of Peyer's patches was observed
in four of four examined C2-pigs, four of four examined
iv-pigs and three of four pigs necropsied at the end of the
study. A mild or moderate hyperplasia in lymph nodes
was observed in one C2-pig (no. 5), two iv-pigs (nos. 6
and 7) and the C1-pig necropsied 65 days after first faecal

The pattern is represented by the threshold cycle (Ct) of the realtime RT-PCR per block (B1: Block 1, B2: Block 2) for contact-infected and iv inoculated pigs. The Ct values were used as relative marker for the amount of HEV in samples, under the assumption that efficiencies of the assay for all faecal samples are
comparable. The first HEV-positive faecal sample is taken as starting point of the pattern (i.e. sampling 1) and three samplings
represent 7 days. Ct values were averaged for contact-infected or iv inoculated pigs per sampling. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean; absence of error bars means that only one value was available for that sampling. Note that a lower Ct
usually indicates a higher HEV-concentration and Ct >40 were set at 45, because 45 cycles were completed in the RT-PCR

spleen and pancreas.

Discussion
In the current study, HEV infection in pigs due to contactexposure to HEV-infectious pigs was studied as model for
natural transmission to describe the natural course of HEV
infection in pigs. The use of intravenous HEV inoculation
as initiator of the transmission process enabled collaterally the identification of differences in the course of infection due to infection route. Furthermore, HEV RNA was
detected in several porcine tissues, muscles and excreta.

We present evidence of HEV RNA in urine in the current
study, with 6 of 14 urine samples containing HEV RNA
compared to 8 of 14 faecal samples collected at the same
time. A single observation of HEV RNA in urine of a pig
was reported before by Banks et al. [27]. Because urine
samples in the current study were collected directly from
the bladder using a sterile syringe with needle, contamination by HEV from other sources is unlikely. One HEV
RNA-positive urine sample was obtained from a contactinfected pig at 65 days after onset of faecal HEV RNA
excretion, showing a comparable Ct to that of faecal samples collected during the acute phase of infection. This

finding may suggest that HEV-excretion via urine lasts
longer than faecal HEV RNA excretion, and/or that urinal
HEV-excretion occurs at a later stage of infection. This
issue should be resolved by monitoring longitudinally the
presence of HEV in urine of contact-infected pigs.

The presence of HEV RNA in urine suggests that HEV may
be transmitted via urine. Until now, faecal-oral transmission of HEV is considered the main transmission route
among pigs. The possibility of other transmission routes
has been discussed [21,22,26], but efforts to experimentally transmit HEV between pigs via tonsil and nasal secretions, and HEV-contaminated needles have been
unsuccessful [24]. The physical condition of urine yields
easier distribution of HEV throughout a pen or stable than
with faeces. In addition, the amount of urine excreted per
pig per day is 5-fold the amount of excreted faeces [28].
Transmission of HEV via urine might occur orally, or aerogenically via droplet aspiration to the respiratory tract.
For urine to be a transmission route, however, the HEV
RNA should originate from infectious HEV particles,
which is currently unknown. The detected HEV RNA may
represent HEV that is bound to antibodies for disposal;
anti-HEV antibodies have been observed in urine samples
of human hepatitis E patients [29]. Whether or not urine
contains infectious HEV could be examined by performing cell infection experiments [30,31] or experimental

inoculation of susceptible pigs with a HEV-positive urine
sample.
HEV RNA was detected in samples from organs and muscle. These samples may contain HEV RNA either extrinsically (on the surface) due to cross-contamination during
necropsy or intrinsically (within the tissue). During
necropsy, the organs containing excreta (faeces and bile)
that can harbour high loads of HEV were sampled last to
reduce the potential for extrinsic contamination.
Although the contribution of these excreta cannot be
excluded entirely, the most likely source for extrinsic contamination is blood. This reasoning holds especially for
the muscle samples, as these were taken outside of the
abdominal cavity before any other organ sample was collected. Indeed, eight of nine examined pigs with HEV-contaminated muscle samples were viremic, suggesting a
potential role of blood in contamination. Whether this
role involves intrinsic and/or extrinsic contamination
remains to be examined, for instance by immunohistochemistry [32].
More than 50% of the muscle samples examined in the
current study contained HEV RNA. Previously, HEV RNA
was detected in skeletal muscle in pigs that were inoculated iv with HEV of genotype 3 obtained from a human
patient, but not with HEV from swine [33]. The muscle
samples examined in the current study were proxies for
commercial pork meat (pork steak, tenderloin or pork
chop). Positive samples were found until four weeks after
onset of faecal HEV RNA excretion, which suggests that
HEV RNA-contaminated meat could only enter stores
when new HEV-infections occur later in the fattening
period. For Japanese pig farms it was estimated that about
5% of the pigs were infected after five months of age [34].
In a Dutch slaughterhouse, 14% out of 80 sampled pigs
excreted HEV faecally, suggesting these pigs were in the
acute phase of infection (Rutjes et al., unpublished data).
From a public health perspective, it should be considered
whether contaminated pork meat at retail indeed contains
infectious HEV and what fraction remains infectious until
consumption. It is advisable, however, to cook pork properly prior to consumption.
In the current study, the course of HEV infection in pigs
was described for contact infected pigs. Simultaneously,
these data were collected from iv inoculated pigs, enabling
comparison between the two. The duration of faecal HEV
RNA excretion was exceeded by about 16 days for iv-pigs
compared to contact-infected pigs. In contrast, the delay
in onset of faecal HEV RNA excretion was reduced by
about 4 days for iv-pigs compared to contact-infected pigs.
This reduction may, however, be partially explained by
the required exposure-time for infection, which is absent
in the estimate for iv-pigs. From the current transmission

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/5/7

study, the rate of transmission per day was estimated at
0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.32 – 1.35) [20]. The
reciprocal of this figure gives the average exposure-time
required for infection, which equals 1.5 (0.7 – 3.1) days.
With the delay being 4.1 days (95% CI: 0.6 – 7.6), the
exposure time explains only partially the delay. The
remainder may be explained by the difference in route of
infection. Other differences possibly attributable to route
of infection were time until viremia and the higher
number of HEV RNA positive organs in iv-pigs. The
observed differences suggest a more severe infection after
iv inoculated pigs compared to contact-infected pigs.
Whether these differences are important to consider in
planning future experiments will depend on the aim. For
instance, when using swine as a bioassay to detect infectious HEV [26] these differences will not be important,
whereas in risk assessment studies the risks needs to be
estimated as accurately as possible and the differences are
important.
The HEV titres in serum and faeces were similar between
iv-pigs and contact-infected pigs in the current study once
faecal HEV RNA excretion had started. Meng et al. [23]
described that HEV titres in faeces increased about 2 log10
(representing 6.6 Ct units under ideal real time RT-PCR
conditions) when the inoculated HEV-dose increased
1,000-fold. This relationship would suggest that the HEVdoses for contact-infected pigs and iv-pigs in the current
study were comparable and that contact-infected pigs
ingested sufficient HEV to result in about 104 HEV RNA
particles entering the bloodstream. Variation in ingested
HEV-doses, however, seems likely for contact-infected
pigs, because their ingestion of HEV was uncontrolled. If
the doses differed, then similar HEV titres for contactinfected and iv-pigs suggest a plateau level of HEV released
by infected cells. It has been hypothesized that HEVrelease from infected cells may be caused by the immunological response rather than the cytopathic effect of HEV
on hepatocytes [35]. In this perspective, the apparent plateau might reflect the maximal effect of the immune system. The current data, however, leave this issue
unresolved.
Antibody development was detected in the current study
at the earliest at about two days after first faecal HEV RNA
excretion. The average time until antibody development
was two weeks after first faecal HEV RNA excretion (contact-infected pigs) or inoculation (iv-pigs). Reported times
until IgG development for iv inoculated pigs were two
weeks after inoculation at the earliest [21,23], but more
frequently reported are times between three and eight
weeks postinoculation [22,26]. The difference between
previous studies and the current study may be caused by
the principle of the ELISAs used. In the current study, the
double antigen sandwich ELISA detects IgM and IgA in

addition to IgG. The IgM antibody contains 10 antigen
binding sites as opposed to two for IgG, for which the likelihood to bind at least one immobilized antigen and one
conjugated antigen is higher for IgM than for IgG, as discussed by Rutjes et al. (unpublished data). As the onset of
IgM generally precedes the onset of IgG after infection,
total antibody development is likely detected earlier than
IgG development only. This advantage could be used in
e.g. seroprevalence screening to minimize misclassification of the subject due to the delay in antibody development.
Histopathological lesions were observed in the liver, gall
bladder, ileum and lymph nodes of HEV-infected pigs in
the current study. Four pigs showed an increasing trend in
AST and ALT levels, which might suggest a slowly progressive development of liver damage during HEV-infection.
Due to absence of control pigs in the current study these
abnormalities cannot be attributed conclusively to the
HEV-infection. However, mild hepatic lesions were previously associated with subclinical hepatitis E in naturally
infected pigs [17,36,37] and experimentally infected pigs
[21,22,25]. Therefore, a subclinical HEV-infection in
domestic pigs may initiate energy-requiring recovery processes, possibly at the expense of production aspects such
as growth rate, feed conversion or time to first estrus.
Effects of HEV-infections on litter size and preterm abortion in pregnant gilts were absent [25], but effects on the
above-mentioned production parameters have not been
examined. This information is needed to evaluate from an
economical perspective on whether intervention strategies for the reduction of the HEV-incidence among pigs
can be beneficial to pig farmers.

Experimental design
The infection experiment is described in detail elsewhere
[20]. Briefly, this study was performed in two replicate
blocks (blocks 1 and 2), each comprising 20 pigs of 3–4
weeks old at the start of the experiment. The HEV inoculum was prepared in bulk, aliquotted in 10 portions and
stored at -70°C until use. The pigs were obtained from a
conventional, SPF herd, free of the most significant pig
pathogens (PRRSV, Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia, M.
pneumoniae). Pigs were tested to be HEV RNA negative in
faeces at two weeks and one week prior to inoculation.
Furthermore, the pigs tested negative for anti-HEV antibodies in serum one week prior to the start of the experiment and on the day the experiment started. Blood
samples were tested two weeks before start of the experiment to be negative for PCV2 and PRRSV by molecular
methods.

Four pigs were allotted to each of five stables (~9 m2 each)
of a BSL2 facility, each stable containing three compartments. One pig was placed in each of two compartments
and two pigs were placed in the third compartment. One
of these two pigs was inoculated intravenously (iv-pig)
with an estimated amount of ~104 PCR detectable units of
HEV, while the other pig served as first-generation contact
pig (C1-pig). Faecal samples were taken three times per
week from the iv-pig and the C1-pig, and HEV excretion
was monitored by conventional RT-PCR. When the C1pig excreted HEV in faeces at three consecutive samplings
it was moved to the compartment containing the secondgeneration contact pig (C2-pig). When the C2-pig
excreted HEV in faeces at three consecutive samplings it
was moved to the compartment containing the third-generation contact pig (C3-pig).

Conclusion
The course of HEV infection in contact-infected pigs was
characterized by estimation of onset and the duration of
faecal HEV RNA excretion and viremia, time until antibody development, the course of AST/ALT-levels and
localization of HEV in tissues and organs. HEV RNA was
detected in 4 of 7 contact-infected pigs and may be a
source for HEV-transmission. Furthermore, 32 of 60 meat
samples contained HEV RNA, suggesting the possibility of
foodborne transmission to humans via pork products.
Additional studies are required to assess whether urine
and meat contain infectious HEV and to assess the currently unknown public health risk by contact with pigs
and by consumption of pork.

Methods
Virus
Hepatitis E virus was acquired from a liver sample of a naturally infected Dutch fattening pig and handled as
described previously [20]. The strain belonged to genotype 3.

The experiment was approved by the institutes' animal
ethical committee according to the Dutch law on animal
experiments.
All 10 iv-pigs were HEV-infected and transmitted HEV to
the C1-pigs by one-to-one exposure (Table 4). However,
only eight of ten trials could be included in the analysis of
HEV transmission from an infectious C1-pig to a C2-pig,
because one infected C1-pig excreted HEV in faeces at
three consecutive samplings, but then not from the day of
transfer onwards, and faecal HEV RNA excretion was
detected in one C2-pig prior to first exposure to an
infected C1-pig (referred to as indirect contact infection).
Seven of these C1-C2 trials were successful. However,
because two C3-pigs were already non-contact infected
and therefore out of the transmission analysis, and the
indirectly infected C2-pig could be used for the analysis of
HEV-transmission to a C3-pig, six trials were conducted to
transmit HEV from a C2-pig to a C3-pig instead of seven.
Of these six C2-C3 trials, five were successful. For two of

the three indirect-contact infected pigs the onset of faecal
HEV RNA excretion was known, and these pigs were therefore included in the current analyses. This yields a total of
24 pigs that were contact-infected (direct or indirect
through an unknown route).
Sampling
Faecal samples were taken and processed as described
elsewhere [20]. Serum samples were collected every three
to four days (twice per week) and centrifuged at 2,500 g
for 10 min to obtain serum. Part of the serum was stored
at -20°C for antibody detection at a later time, the remainder at -70°C for RNA extraction at a later time. Blood samples were collected only from those pigs that were housed
together in one compartment (i.e. where HEV transmission was analyzed). In addition, when a contact-infected
pig showed HEV RNA excretion at two consecutive samplings, a control sample was taken from the next-generation contact pig. Faeces and serum were collected from
two iv-pigs up until 56 dpi in Block 1 and from two C1pigs up until 55 and 65 days after first faecal HEV RNA
excretion in Block 2.

Five iv-pigs were necropsied at 28 dpi, five C2-pigs at 25
or 26 days after first faecal HEV RNA excretion (referred to
as 28 days postinfection), two iv-pigs at 56 dpi in block 1
and two C1-pigs at 55 and 65 days after first faecal HEV
RNA excretion in block 2. The five iv-pigs and C2-pigs
(three each in block 1 and two each in block 2) were
appointed by randomly selecting one of the five stables.
The two iv-pigs necropsied at 56 dpi were necessarily the
two remaining iv-pigs in block 1. The two necropsied C1pigs in block two came from the same stable as the two ivpigs necropsied at 56 dpi in block 1. Pigs were sedated by
injecting a high dose of barbiturates via the ear vein and
were subsequently bled. During necropsy the following
samples were collected in the specified order: blood, urine
(directly from the bladder with a sterile syringe and needle), the longissimus muscle (pork chop), the iliopsoas
muscle (tenderloin), the biceps femoris muscle (pork
steak), tonsil, lymph nodes (bronchial, mesenterial and
hepatic), pancreas, spleen, kidney, ileum, jejunum, colon,

faeces, bile (directly from the gall-bladder with a sterile
syringe and needle) and liver. Part of each tissue sample
was fixed immediately in 10% neutral buffered formalin
for histology and the other part was stored in tubes at 70°C upon return to the laboratory for RNA extraction at
a later time.
RNA extraction
RNA was extracted in a laboratory dedicated only to RNA
extraction, from 140 μl of a 10% faecal suspension, serum
or urine using the QiaAmp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen,
Venlo, The Netherlands) according to the spin protocol
supplied by the manufacturer. For bile samples, RNA was
extracted from 100 μl using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Breda, The
Netherlands). The RNA was eluted in a final volume of 35
μl elution buffer. For all tissue samples, RNA was extracted
with an optimized protocol for liver samples using
mechanical disruption of tissue samples with zirconium
beads and subsequent silica-based RNA extraction, as
described elsewhere [10].
RT-PCR
The reagents for the RT-PCR were prepared in a laboratory
dedicated to preparing reagents for (RT-)PCR, and the
RNA was added in a separate laboratory dedicated to adding RNA to the (RT-)PCR reagents. The actual RT-PCR was
performed in a third laboratory that contains only thermocyclers. This segregation of laboratories, combined
with the experience of the lab technician, should reduce
the likelihood of RT-PCR cross-contamination.

HEV RNA in all samples was detected using a real-time RTPCR assay targeting ORF3 [38]. This protocol was modified to analyze 5 μl of RNA by increasing the amount of
2× QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) to 12.5
μl and the amount of enzyme to 0.24 μl per reaction. For
confirmation, nine real-time PCRs that generated a
threshold cycle (Ct) > 38 were subjected to gel electrophoresis, showing fragments of the expected size. Nontemplate controls were included in each assay to monitor
PCR contamination. During the experiment samples were
analyzed using conventional RT-PCR directed at open read-

ing frame 2 (ORF2), as described previously [19]. Decisions for transfer of pigs to other compartments and the
point of autopsy at 28 days post infection for C2-pigs were
based on this conventional RT-PCR. After the experiment,
588 of the 591 faecal samples were re-examined for HEV
RNA with the real-time ORF3 RT-PCR used for the other
samples to enable direct comparison. Of the retested faecal samples, 278 samples tested negatively in both assays
and 260 samples tested positively in both assays. Twelve
of the conventional RT-PCR positive samples were negative by real-time RT-PCR; 38 of the real-time RT-PCR positive samples were negative by conventional RT-PCR.
These additional positive samples were frequently
observed just before or after a series of positive samples as
determined by conventional RT-PCR.
Undiluted RNA samples were examined and if samples
tested HEV-negative, then undiluted RNA and 10-fold
diluted RNA samples were tested to dilute possible amplification inhibitors in the RT-PCR assay.
Sequencing
RT-PCR fragments of the expected size were either excised
from the agarose gel or were directly purified with a mini
quick spin DNA column (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The
Netherlands), inserted in the pCRII-TOPO cloning vector
(Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands), and transformed
into chemically competent E. coli JM109 (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands). After an incubation of 20 ± 4 h at
37 C, white colonies were examined for insertion of the
correct RT-PCR fragment by PCR with M13 forward and
reverse primers. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis, for the determination of the expected size, and
were hybridized with a HEV-specific probe. Positive PCR
products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). Sequencing
was done with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, Calif.).
ELISA
Serum samples were examined for total anti-HEV antibodies (IgTot) with a double-antigen sandwich ELISA
obtained from MP Biomedicals Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. in Singapore [39]. Samples with a sample to cut-off ratio ≥ 1
were considered positive. The cut-off value equaled 0.2
plus the mean optical density (OD) of negative controls.
Clinical chemistry
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were analyzed longitudinally
by a spectrophotometric method in an automated analyzer (HumaStar 89, Instruchemie, Delfzijl, The Netherlands) for five C2-pigs and five iv-pigs necropsied at 28
days postinfection, and from the two C1-pigs necropsied

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/5/7

at the end of Block 2. The reference values in normal
feeder pigs used for ALT were 15 – 46 U l-1 and for AST 16
– 67 U l-1.
Histopathology
Samples of liver, gallbladder, ileum, spleen, mesenterial
lymph nodes, kidney and pancreas collected from five C2pigs and five iv-pigs at 28 days post infection, from the
two iv-pigs necropsied at 56 dpi and the two C1-pigs
necropsied at 55 and 65 days after first faecal HEV RNA
excretion. The formalin-fixed samples were embedded in
paraffin wax using routine procedures, sectioned at 4 μm
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Statistics
In total, five time-related parameters were estimated with
survival analysis [40]. These include: time until first faecal
HEV RNA excretion, time until first HEV-detection in
serum, time until antibody development, duration of faecal HEV RNA excretion and duration of viremia. The
period until first HEV-excretion for contact-pigs was estimated from days post exposure (dpe). For C1-pigs, exposure was assumed to start at the midpoint of the interval
between the last HEV-negative and first HEV-positive faecal sample of the respective iv-pig. For C2- and C3-pigs,
exposure started on the day the C1- or C2-pig, respectively, was introduced. All other time-related parameters
were estimated relative to the first day of faecal HEV RNA
excretion, which was assumed to start at the midpoint of
the interval between the last HEV-negative and the first
HEV-positive faecal sample. This relative comparison was
chosen because the moment of infection for contactinfected pigs is unknown, impeding the use of dpi. By
using the onset of faecal HEV RNA excretion as a reference
point the course of infection is normalized for all pigs.
This normalization makes comparisons between pigs
more appropriate.

To assess differences between contact-infected and inoculated pigs, data of the C2- and C3-pigs were pooled, as
exposure to HEV was assumed to be similar. The C1-pigs,
however, joint compartments with iv-pigs from inoculation onwards, displaying a different exposure-pattern
than C2- and C3-pigs. Therefore, statistical differences
between C1-pigs and C2/3-pigs were examined.
The differences in Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for
the five parameters were tested using the Log-rank statistic
(α = 0.05) for the three groups: C1-pigs, C2/3-pigs and ivpigs. To draw conclusions on differences between contactinfected and iv-pigs while accounting for the variation
between the two blocks, joint p-values were calculated
from the p-values per parameter per block using Fischer's

method of computing the statistic −2∑ ln(p i ) [41]. This
statistic is chi-square distributed with degrees of freedom
twice the number of p-values added.
Trends for increasing AST- and ALT-levels in time were
assessed per pig by linear regression, with AST- or ALT-levels as continuous response variable and sampling number
as continuous explanatory variable. All statistical analyses
were done using SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA).
