throughput SSRs and SNPs discovery in
Cucurbita pepo (Cucurbitaceae)

Abstract
Background: Cucurbita pepo belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family. The “Zucchini” types rank among the highestvalued vegetables worldwide, and other C. pepo and related Cucurbita spp., are food staples and rich sources of fat
and vitamins. A broad range of genomic tools are today available for other cucurbits that have become models for
the study of different metabolic processes. However, these tools are still lacking in the Cucurbita genus, thus
limiting gene discovery and the process of breeding.
Results: We report the generation of a total of 512,751 C. pepo EST sequences, using 454 GS FLX Titanium
technology. ESTs were obtained from normalized cDNA libraries (root, leaves, and flower tissue) prepared using
two varieties with contrasting phenotypes for plant, flowering and fruit traits, representing the two C. pepo
subspecies: subsp. pepo cv. Zucchini and subsp. ovifera cv Scallop. De novo assembling was performed to generate
a collection of 49,610 Cucurbita unigenes (average length of 626 bp) that represent the first transcriptome of the
species. Over 60% of the unigenes were functionally annotated and assigned to one or more Gene Ontology
terms. The distributions of Cucurbita unigenes followed similar tendencies than that reported for Arabidopsis or
melon, suggesting that the dataset may represent the whole Cucurbita transcriptome. About 34% unigenes were
detected to have known orthologs of Arabidopsis or melon, including genes potentially involved in disease
resistance, flowering and fruit quality. Furthermore, a set of 1,882 unigenes with SSR motifs and 9,043 high
confidence SNPs between Zucchini and Scallop were identified, of which 3,538 SNPs met criteria for use with high
throughput genotyping platforms, and 144 could be detected as CAPS. A set of markers were validated, being 80%
of them polymorphic in a set of variable C. pepo and C. moschata accessions.
Conclusion: We present the first broad survey of gene sequences and allelic variation in C. pepo, where limited
prior genomic information existed. The transcriptome provides an invaluable new tool for biological research. The
developed molecular markers are the basis for future genetic linkage and quantitative trait loci analysis, and will be
essential to speed up the process of breeding new and better adapted squash varieties.

Background
The botanical family Cucurbitaceae, commonly known
as cucurbits, includes several economically and nutritionally important vegetable crops cultivated worldwide,
such as cucumber, melon, watermelon and pumpkins,
gourds and squashes [1]. The cucurbit family displays a
rich diversity of many traits, being primary models for
sex expression analysis, for the study of vascular biology

and for the analysis of the mechanisms involved in fruit
ripening [2-5].
Despite the agricultural and biological importance of
cucurbits, knowledge of their genetics and genome has
been very limited till now. So far, genomic efforts have
largely focused on cucumber and melon. Recently, the
whole genome sequencing of the cucumber, C. sativus
var. sativus L., has been completed by combining traditional Sanger and next-generation Illumina GA sequencing technologies [6]. Also an effort is in progress
through a Spanish Initiative to obtain the whole genome
sequence of melon, Cucumis melo L. [7]. Many genomic

resources are available for both crops and also for
watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. &
Nakai. BAC libraries, collections of genetic markers,
detailed physical and genetic maps, mapping populations, microarrays, sequence databases and mutant collections [8-11] are facilitating the use of cucurbits by
the research community. Many genomic resources are
available at the web site of the International Cucurbit
Genomics Initiative (ICuGI) [12].
Cucurbita genus (2n = 2 × = 40), that include
squashes, gourds and pumpkins, has been less studied.
It contains some of the earliest domesticated plant species [13]. Today, three of them, C. pepo L., C. moschata
Duchesne, and C. maxima Duchesne, have considerable
impact on human nutrition, being appreciated by their
nutritional and medical properties [14-17]. In addition
to the use of the edible fruits, flowers, leaves, and vine
tips are consumed, and seeds are also important as
snacks, as a source of edible oil and protein for human
and animal consumption, and in the pharmaceutical
industry. Squashes are also popular as containers and
for ornamental purposes. The economic value of Cucurbita spp. as rootstocks for overcoming soil borne diseases in cucurbits is significant [18].
C. pepo is the most economically important species
within the genus distributed worldwide, and one of the
most variable in the plant kingdom. Cultivated C. pepo
is considered to comprise two subspecies each one
including several cultivar-groups, ssp. pepo (Pumpkin,
Vegetable Marrow, Cocozelle, and Zucchini) and ssp.
ovifera (Acorn, Scallop, Crookneck, and Straightneck)
[19,20]. Its great economic value is based mainly on the
culinary use of the immature fruits as vegetables, often
referred to collectively as “summer squashes”, but also
the Pumpkin and Acorn groups display a major use as
mature fruits, known as “winter squashes”. The great
diversity of uses makes breeding objectives quite
variable.
The currently available genetic and genomic tools for
Cucurbita are very limited. Until now three genetic
maps have been constructed: two maps from inter-specific crosses between C. pepo and C. moschata [21,22]
and the third from an intra-specific cross of C. pepo (a
USA oil-Pumpkin variety and an Italian Crookneck variety) [23]. These maps contained mostly RAPDs
(Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) and AFLPs
(Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) markers.
Only recently a collection of genomic microsatellites
(Simple Sequence repeats, SSRs) has been developed
and used to increase the map density [24]. The last map
version comprises 178 SSRs, 244 AFLPs, 230 RAPDs,
and two morphological traits (h (hull-less seed) and Bu
(Bush growth habit). It contains 20 linkage groups with
a map density of 2.9 cM and genome coverage of 86.8%.

These SSRs were also used to study synteny between
C. pepo and C. moschata [25].
The lack of denser genetic maps, larger high-throughput marker collections, and suited mapping populations
is limiting gene isolation and squash breeding. Many
C. pepo genes have been reported, mainly related to
fruit quality and resistance to poty- and other viruses
and several fungi, such as downy and powdery mildew
[26], but only the transcripts of a few have been cloned
and molecularly characterized in individual studies in
C. pepo or other Cucurbita spp, for example genes
involved in the biosynthesis or signaling pathways of
growth regulators, affecting plant development, sex
expression and response to stress [27-32].
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most
abundant variations in genomes and, therefore, constitute a powerful tool for mapping and marker-assisted
breeding. These markers are replacing microsatellites in
many model and non-model plants for saturating
genetic maps [10,33]. In genomes that have been poorly
studied, sequence availability is the limiting factor for
the discovery of SNPs.
Expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) represent a valuable
sequence resource for research and breeding as they
provide comprehensive information regarding the transcriptome. ESTs have played significant roles in accelerating gene discovery, allowing large-scale expression
analysis, improving genome annotation, elucidating phylogenetic relationships and facilitating breeding programs for both plants and animals by providing SSRs
and SNPs markers [6,8,11,34-37].
Currently, there are more than 66 million ESTs in the
NCBI public collection [38]. However, less than 1,000
EST sequences are available for Cucurbita spp (C. maxima, C. moschata and C. pepo), and approximately
500,000 for all the species in the Cucurbitaceae family,
most of them of cucumber and melon, included in the
ICUGI Cucurbit Genomics Database [12], as compared
to more than 1.5 and 2 million ESTs available for Arabidopsis and maize, respectively.
Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies allow us the large scale generation of ESTs efficiently and cost-effectively [39,40]. There are increasing
studies in which 454 technologies, combined or not
with Solexa/Illumina, are used to characterize transcriptomes in cereals and legumes [41-43]. Even in model
species, such as Arabidopsis, this deep sequencing is
allowing to identify new transcripts not present in previous ESTs collections [44]. Also specific transcriptomes
are being generated in species for which previous genomic resources are lacking [45-47]. The new transcripts
are being used for microarrays design [48], and also for
high throughput SSRs or SNPs identification. SNP
detection is performed by aligning raw reads from

Blanca et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:104

different genotypes to a reference genome or transcriptome previously available, as in maize, cucumber and
even in poliploid species such as Brassica napus [49-51].
De novo assembly of raw sequences coming from a set
of genotypes, followed by pairwise comparison of the
overlapping assembled reads has also successfully used
in species lacking any significant genomic or transcriptomic resources [52].
In this study, we describe the generation of 49,610
Cucurbita unigenes de novo assembled from about
500.000 ESTs obtained from roots, leaves and flowers of
two contrasting C. pepo cultivars (Zucchini and Scallop,
belonging to the two C. pepo subspecies) using Roche/
454 GS FLX Titanium massive parallel pyrosequencing
technology. These unigenes are functionally annotated
and represent the first C. pepo transcriptome. They
have been also screened for SSR motifs and used to
identify a large SNPs collection suited for high-throughput mapping purposes. This sequence will allow accelerating genetics and breeding of this crop. It is also an
important advance for cucurbit genomics as it is the
first genomic resource for this genus, allowing comparisons among members of the three most economically
important cucurbit genera, Cucumis, Citrullus and
Cucurbita.

Results and Discussion
EST sequencing and assembly

We performed a half 454 GS FLX Titanium run on each
of the two libraries constructed from leaves, flowers and
roots from two C. pepo cultivars with contrasting plant,
flower and fruit phenotypes, MU16 (C. pepo subsp. pepo
cv Zucchini) and UPV196 (C. pepo subsp. pepo cv Scallop). A total of 407,723 and 392,370 raw sequence reads
were obtained from each library (Table 1). Raw reads
were processed using the Ngs_backbone software [53] to
eliminate adapter sequences, low quality chromatograms
and sequences of less than 100 base pairs (bp). This
analysis gave rise to 261,962 and 250,789 processed
sequences, comprising 164.6 Mbp of sequence, with an
average length of 318.7 and 323.4 bp, respectively. The
length distribution of these expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) is shown in Figure 1. More than 85% ESTs fell
between 200 and 500 bp in length.

The reads produced by the GS FLX Titanium platform
were used for clustering and de novo assembly, independently of the genotype of origin. 459,439 ESTs were
finally assembled using the Mira assembler [54] yielding
a total of 49,610 high-confident tentative consensus
sequences (non-redundant sequences or unigenes). The
distribution of the number of ESTs per unigene is
shown in Figure 2. The majority of unigenes were
assembled from a moderate number of ESTs (from 2 to
10), with an average of 9.3 ESTs per unigene. Of all unigenes, about a 10% contained more than 20 reads, and
only 2.4% more than 50, which represented the most
abundant transcripts in these cDNA libraries. This low
redundancy is probably due to the success of the normalization process, responsible for the suppression of
superabundant transcripts. Normalization precludes
in silico analysis of gene expression, but greatly increases
the number of unigenes that can be determined by
reducing redundancy.
The assembled unigenes had an average length of 626
bp, comprising approximately 31 Mbp in total. The
length distribution of the unigenes is shown in Figure 3.
The analysis revealed that more of the 50% of unigenes
were larger than 537 bp, and only a 5% of the sequences
were shorter than 290 bp. The number of assembled
unigenes is similar to that obtained in previous transcriptome analyses in maize, Eucaliptus, Artemisia, chesnut, olive and cucumber. However, the de novo assembly
with the longer reads obtained with the GS FLX Titanium platform render unigenes that average almost two
times longer than that reported in these studies performed using 454 GS-20 and GS-FLX platforms
[45-47,51,52,55]. Our assembled unigenes were also larger than that reported for American ginseng and Glycyrrhiza uralensis transcriptomes obtained using also the
454 GS FLX Titanium platform [56,57]. Cucurbita unigenes length is comparable to that reported in melon
transcriptome using the conventional (Sanger) dideoxybased sequencing [8]. These differences in length might
be due to the different assemblers used. The longer unigenes present the advantage of being more accurately
annotated. The raw data files are available in the
Sequence Read Archive at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [58], accession number

format are available in the additional file 1:’Cucurbita
unigenes’, with unigene numbers from CUTC000001 to
CUTC049610.
Structural and functional annotation

Most unigenes, 47,626 (96%) were predicted to have one
ORF. By aligning the unigenes with the melon genomic
sequence (available for the partners of the MELONOMICS project [7]), introns were identified in 16,697 unigenes (33.7%). Annotation results regarding ORFs and

introns position are included in additional file 2: ‘Annotation of ORFs and Introns’.
Codon usage was estimated using a subset of the unigenes predicted to contain full-length ORFs, with start
and stop codons and without frame-shift errors. All
codons were found in the dataset, with the least frequent codon represented 590 times (data not shown).
As expected, the codon usage of Cucurbita shared some
similarities with that of melon, Arabidopsis and other
dicots. For example, T is the preferred base in the third
codon position for most amino acids except for glycine,

phenylalanine, serine and arginine. The preferred stop
codons were UAA and UGA that occurred in the 41.4
and 41.1% of the sequences, respectively. Suppression of
the CG dinucleotide in the last two codon positions is
very frequent in dicots, possibly as a consequence of
methylation of C in the CG dinucleotide, resulting in an
increased mutation rate; the ratio XCG/XCC for Cucurbita was 0.69, then the suppression was more intense
than in Arabidopsis (0.92), but milder than that reported
for melon (0.52) tomato (0.58), pea (0.51), potato (0.48)
or Populus (0.38). The GC content in third base position
was similar in Cucurbita as compared to melon and
Arabidopsis (46% vs 39,9% and 42%) [8,35].
In order to identify C. pepo unigenes potentially
encoding proteins with known function, a BLAST analysis [59] was performed in a sequential way using SwissProt [60], Arabidopsis proteins [61], and Uniref90 [62]
protein databases. Over 63% of the unigenes (31,159)
had at least one significant hit (E-value cutoff = 1e-20).
Most were annotated with the accurate databases SwissProt (55%) and Arabidopsis (36%) and less with Uniref
(9%). The majority of the unigenes have significant hits
with Arabidopsis proteins (67%). Hits with Cucumis and
Cucurbita previously reported proteins were also found.
Gene Ontology provides a structured and controlled
vocabulary to describe gene products according to three
categories: molecular function, biological process and cellular component [63,64]. We added GO terms using Blast2GO [65], based on the automated annotation of each
unigene using BLAST results against the GenBank non
redundant protein database (nr) from NCBI [66]. A total

of 29,676 unigenes (60%) could be assigned to one or
more ontologies. Figure 4A show the unigenes distribution
regarding the number of GOs to which they were
assigned. The number of GO terms per unigene varied
from 1 to 34. More than the 78% of the unigenes could be
assigned to more than one GO term, being the majority of
the unigenes mapped to 2 to 7 GO terms. In total, 103,045
GO terms were retrieved, 25%, 47% and 28% in the biological process, in the molecular function and in the cellular
component category, respectively. The distribution of
annotated unigenes under different GO levels of each category (Figure 4B) shows a concentration in 4-7, 3-7 and 4-7
levels respectively for biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, indicating a good accuracy
of annotation. The GO annotation analysis reinforces the
idea that a broad diversity of genes was sampled in our
multi-tissue normalized cDNA libraries.
We used the GO annotations to assign each unigene
to a set of GO Slims of the biological process and molecular function categories, which are a list of high-level
GO terms providing a broad overview of the ontology
content. A summary with the number of unigenes annotated in each GO slim term is shown in Figure 5.
GO annotations for the unigenes showed fairly consistent sampling of functional classes. Cellular process,
metabolic process, and biosynthetic process were among
the most highly represented groups under the Biological
Process category. This might be indicating the analyzed
tissues were undergoing rapid growth and extensive
metabolic activities. Genes involved in other important
biological processes such as reproduction, stress and

stimulus response, signaling, and developmental processes were also identified (Figure 5A). Under the molecular function category, assignments were mainly to the
catalitic and binding activities. A large number of hydrolases, kinases and transferases were annotated which
suggests that this study may allow for the identification
of genes involved in the secondary metabolite synthesis
pathways. Also, transcription and translation factors
were well represented (Figure 5B). The distribution of
Cucurbita unigenes follow similar tendencies to that
reported for Arabidopsis and also for the melon transcriptome [8,52,61], suggesting that the Cucurbita dataset could be representative of the whole squash
transcriptome. All annotation results, regarding BLAST
hits and GO annotations for the whole Cucurbita unigene collection are compiled in the additional file 3:
‘Blast hits and GO terms’.
Doing a reciprocal blast search, we have also identified
19,312 Cucurbita unigenes (38.9%) with an ortholog in
Arabidopsis [61] (11,022 (22.2%)) and a melon ortholog
(12,461 (25.1%)) of the ICUGI data base [12] (Table 2).

A list of the identified orthologs is included in additional file 4: ‘Arabidopsis and melon orthologs’.
Only 11,580 (23%) of the unigenes did not show significant similarity to any protein in the databases and
could not be annotated. Shorter sequences are less likely
to align with a significant E-value. However, the average
length of these non annotated unigenes was 425 bp,
with 50% being longer than 413 bp. For homology
searches against known genes, unigenes longer than 200
bp are widely accepted for the effective assignment of
functional annotations [57]. In previous studies performed with massive sequencing techniques a similar or
even higher number of unigenes did not match with
previously known sequences representing newly detected
transcripts [44,49,55,57].
Genes potentially encoding proteins involved in

of cucurbits crops. The Cucurbita unigene collection

contains genes potentially involved in disease resistance

and THH1 (Tom Three Homolog 1), genes encoding proteins that play essential roles on the tobamovirus replication [70], and also orthologs to the eukaryotic translation
factors of the EIF4 family (EIF4E, EIF(ISO)4E and
EIF4EG), known to mediate recessive resistance to potyand other RNA viruses [71-73]. Regarding fungal
responses, we have found orthologs to the Arabidopsis
RPH1 gene (resistance to Phytophthora 1), involved in
immune response to Phytophthora brassicae [74], and
other genes required for non-race specific resistance to
bacterial and fungal pathogens [75].The powdery mildew
is the main fungal disease affecting Cucurbita cultivation

Blanca et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:104
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/104

[15]. An ortholog to Arabidopsis PMR5 (powdery mildew
resistant 5) and to the MLO10 gene, belonging to the
family of Arabidopsis homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus mlo, have been identified [76,77].
Cucurbits are models for sex determination studies
due to its diverse floral sex types. Significant progress
has been made in elucidating the mechanisms of plant
sex determination by cloning several major sexdetermining genes in cucurbit species [2,78,79]. Despite
such advances, the whole mechanisms of sex determination are still unknown. Both Cucurbita sequenced genotypes are monoecious, but have large differences in the
flowering time and the femaleness tendency. The
Cucurbita unigene collection includes orthologs of Arabidopsis genes involved in flower development and flowering-time regulation (see additional file 5) [80-82]. Sex
expression in cucurbits can be regulated by plant hormones and environmental factors. Ethylene is highly
correlated with the femaleness and has been regarded as
the primary sex determination factor [6]. Some genes
related with the ethylene synthesis and also transcription
factors and receptors involved in the ethylene perception and signaling have been found (various EIN (Ethylene insensitive) and ETR (Ethylene response) genes). It
has been reported that auxin and also brassinosteroids
can induce pistillate flower formation in part through its
stimulation of ethylene production. The Cucurbita unigene collection has also different orthologs of proteins
involved in auxin and brassinosteroids signaling, affecting flowering-time in Arabidopsis (SAR, suppressor of
auxin resistance, BZR, Brassinazole resistant) [83-85].
Cucumber orthologs involved in those mechanisms have
been reported to have differential expression in Gynoecious/hermaphroditic flowers in a recent study performed with massive sequencing [51]
We also identified a number of genes putatively
involved in gibberellins (GA) biosynthetic and signaling
pathways. These specific genes might be associated with
the role of gibberellic acid in developmental regulation
and plant stress response. The cucurbits represent a
model plant system on which to examine the contents
of the phloem translocation stream. A recent study
reported a large-scale analysis of proteins from pumpkin
(C. maxima) phloem exudates [5]. Identified proteins
mainly corresponded to enzymes that carry out pivotal
roles in stress and defense pathways. Furthermore, the
detection of proteins related to GA synthesis in phloem
supports the theory that the phloem is the route for
transport and modification of GAs. Some orthologs of
the genes encoding the main phloem sap proteins are
included in our C. pepo collection.
Fruit development and ripening are the most important processes determining the fruit quality. At present
most of the molecular and genetic data available about

Page 8 of 15

fruit development and ripening come from Arabidopsis
and tomato [86]. In recent years, several genes and
quantitative trait loci controlling fruit quality traits have
been described in cucurbits [87,88]. As for the previously described processes, orthologs to genes involved
in fruit development and quality have been found in the
Cucurbita dataset (see additional file 5) [89,90]. These
include several cell wall-metabolism enzymes and genes
involved in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway (provides intermediates for the synthesis of sterols, carotenoids and chlorophylls, and also phytohormones and
terpenes involved in plant defense). Cucurbita species
are important sources of vitamins in many developing
countries due to their high carotenoids content [91].
The Cucurbita unigene collection includes some
enzymes involved in carotenoids biosynthesis (PSY, Phytoene synthase, PDS, Phytoene desaturase and ZDS,
Zeta-carotene desaturase) [92]. The root tissue also provided some root specific genes involved in root development or stress tolerance [93].
SSRs and SNPs discovery and validation

We performed a general screen on the Cucurbita unigene dataset for the presence of microsatellites, analyzing its nature and frequency [94]. A search for di-, tri-,
and tetra-nucleotide repeats yielded a total of 1,935
potential SSRs in 1,822 unigenes, that is approximately
4% of the unigenes contained at least one of the considered SSR motifs. This percentage agrees with previous
studies using EST databases that shows that approximately 3-7% of expressed sequences contain putative
SSR motifs [34,51].
The maximum and minimum lengths of the repeats
were 129 and 17, and the average length was 24 nucleotides. These were mostly tri-nucleotide (71.7%), and less
di- (15.3%) and tetra- (13%). The most common repeat
motifs are indicated in Table 3. A similar bias towards
AG, AAG and AAAG and against CG repeats has been
reported in EST-SSRs of many crops, including other
cucurbits like melon and cucumber. It has been proposed that this may be due to the tendency of CpG
sequences to be methylated which potentially might
inhibit transcription [8,51]. Genomic SSRs identified in
C. pepo and C. moschata also showed the same predominant di- and tri-nucleotide motifs [24]. The complete
list of SSRs and their corresponding information are
provided in additional file 6: ‘Cucurbita SSRs’.
Most SSRs (55%) were located in ORFs, being a similar number in the 5’ and the 3’ untranslated regions
(UTRs) (Table 4). An analysis of the localization of di-,
tri- and tetra-repeats showed that tri-nucleotides localized preferentially in ORFs, consistently with maintenance of the ORFs coding capacity, whereas di- and
tetra-nucleotides were more frequent in UTRs. It is

known that the UTRs are richer in SSRs than coding
regions, particularly the 5’-UTRs [34,95]. Thus, the prevalence of tri-nucleotide repeats in the Cucurbita dataset may account for our high proportion of ORF-SSRs.
These results agree with those reported in melon, where
the most frequent SSRs in ORFs were tri-nucleotide [8].
We selected a set of 30 ESTs-SSRs for validation, 26
(86.7%) amplified polymorphic fragments in a set of 10
genotypes of Cucurbita, 9 representative of the diversity
within C. pepo (accessions of 3 morphotypes of spp.
pepo, including several landraces and commercial types
of the zucchini type, and two morphotypes of spp. ovifera) and 1 C. moschata accession. All but one could be
transferred to the related crop C. moschata, producing
alleles unique of this species in most cases (60%). On an
average we found 3.2 alleles per primer pair in C. pepo
and C. moschata. Most of EST-SSRs assayed are useful
to detect variability within and between the two

subspecies of C. pepo. A 77% were polymorphic
between the two genotypes used for sequencing, and
50% and 88% detected variation within spp. ovifera and
within spp. pepo, respectively. Also 62% detected variation among the landraces and commercial lines of zucchini. Details of these validated SSRs are included in the
additional file 7: ‘Validated Cucurbita SSRs’.
SSR markers derived from EST sequences have
been extensively used in constructing genetic maps of
cucurbit species [9,96]. Until recently, only a few
microsatellites have been available for Cucurbita, and
transferability from other cucurbits, such as cucumber
of melon, has been demonstrated to be very low [9],
then the development of SSRs for this genus is highly
desirable. Gong et al. [24] developed SSRs-enriched
partial genomic libraries from an Austrian oil-pumpkin
variety C. pepo subsp. pepo and one accession of
C. moschata, generating a collection of 1,058 putative
SSRs. They reported a 81% validation in a set of genotypes representing the cultivar groups, also indicating a
high intra-genus transferability. EST-SSRs have several
advantages versus genomic; they are related to genes,
being functional markers that can be used as candidate
genes to study their association with phenotypic variation and the flanking sequences are more likely to be
conserved among close or distant species, making their
use as markers for comparative mapping easier. We
will use the identified EST-SSRs markers for the construction of a genetic map, using a Recombinant
Inbreed population (RILs) derived from the Zucchini
(MU16) × Scallop (UPV196) cross. They will be also
useful for fingerprinting commercial Zucchini cultivars,
breeding lines and landraces and for genetic diversity
studies within the genus, mainly performed with
RAPDs or AFLPs to date [20,97].
Massive sequencing of ESTs in a number of diverse
genotypes has been previously used for developing large
SNPs collections [49-52]. Since the ESTs generated
under the present study, using the 454 technology, are
from two different cultivars belonging to two subspecies,

with MU16 and UPV96 representing the 51% and 49%
of the EST sequences, respectively, we expected SNPs to
be frequent in our collection. The SNP calling was done
with the default parameters recommended by the
ngs_backbone software [53]. Stringent quality criteria
were used for distinguish sequence variations from
sequencing errors and mutations introduced during the
cDNA synthesis step. Only variations with allele and
mapping quality over the established thresholds were
annotated. By applying these criteria, we initially identified a total of 19,980 SNPs and 1,174 INDELs distributed in 8,147 unigenes (16.4%), averaging a total of 2.6
single variations per unigene. Different filters were
applied to facilitate the management of the variants.
INDELs can be filtered out with VKS (It is not an SNP).
The detailed information about the identified SNPs and
INDELs is included in the additional file 8:’Cucurbita
SNPs and INDELs’.
Within the detected SNPs, transitions (68%) were
much more common than transversions (32%) (Table
5). A similar number of A/G and C/T transitions and
also similar percentages of the four transversion types
(A/T, A/C, G/T, C/G) were found. A set of SNPs
could be accurately located with respect to putative
initiation and termination codons, being mostly located
in ORFs (82%).
Other filters allowed an accurate in silico selection of
the SNPs to identify the ones more suited for mapping
purposes. All located in sequences with more than 4
SNPs or INDELs per 100 bases (filtered out with HVR4)
were discarded (71, 0.36%) and also those that were
variable within one or both genotypes, MU16 and
UPV196 (10,937, 54.7%) (filtered out with NVSM2,
NVSM1 or both filters). This requirement is intended to
minimize the discovery of false polymorphisms due to
the alignment of paralogs, a potentially significant problem when aligning short sequence reads. Therefore,
only nucleotide variants in relatively conserved or
recently derived paralogs may have been incorrectly
identified as SNPs. The drawback is that some true
SNPs in hotspots of genetic diversity or genes under
high diversifying selection may be discarded.

Type and number of transition and transversions are shown for putative high

database.

From the remaining 9,043 higher confident SNPs, that
were monomorphic within and polymorphic between
the two sequenced genotypes, we selected a set that met
different criteria for facilitating validation and for their
use in a Golden Gate genotyping assay [98,99], discarding those that were closer than 60 bp to another SNP or
INDEL, and/or were located closer than 60 bp to an
intron and/or were closer than 60 bp to the unigene
edge (filtered out with CS60, I60 and CL60, respectively). Finally, 3,538 SNPs were selected that met all
criteria (see those with only a dot or a CEF tag in the
filter field in additional file 8). From these, 144 SNPs
were identified that can be detected as CAPS as they
generate allele-specific restriction targets. We selected
50 of this putative CAPS, and 39 (80%) gave amplicons
polymorphic between MU16 and UPV196 after digestion with the corresponding enzyme, which is comparable to that reported in previous studies with maize and
Eucaliptus [49,52]. Information of the validated CAPS is
included in additional file 9:’Cucurbita SNPs validated
as CAPS’. These CAPS markers are especially useful
when experience or equipment for SNPs detection using
other methods is not available.
All annotation results (ORFs, introns, descriptions,
GO terms, Arabidopsis and melon orthologs, SNVs and
SSRs) have been also added in additional file 10 using
the GFF3 standard file format of The Sequence Ontology Resources [100]. This format for annotations results
facilitates its uploading, representation and analysis.

Conclusions
The length and amount of the ESTs obtained with the
454 GSLX-Titanium platform has facilitated de novo
assembly of the transcriptome in Cucurbita pepo, species for which limited prior sequence information is
available, providing unigene sequences with length comparable to that obtained with traditional Sanger methodology. The unigene sequences constituted the first
genomic resource for the Cucurbita genus. Cucurbita,
along to Cucumis and Citrullus, are the three most economically important genera of the Cucurbitaceae family,
whose economic importance is second only to the Solanaceae. Then this resource will enhance comparative
studies within the family. The transcriptome will be
important for gene discovery in Cucurbita and for
future annotations of the Cucurbita genome sequence.
The identified genes provide candidates for resistance
genes against RNA viruses, fungal or bacterial pathogens. This is also an important resource for further
study of sex determination and fruit quality in Cucurbita. The SSRs and SNPs identified here will constitute
an important resource for mapping and marker-assisted
breeding in Cucurbita pepo and closely related crops.

cDNA sequence processing and assembly

Methods
Plant material

Two cDNA libraries were constructed using material
from the MU16 “Zucchini” Spanish cultivar (belonging
to Cucurbita pepo L. ssp. pepo) and the UPV196 “Scallop” (belonging to C. pepo L. ssp. ovifera). Seeds of both
cultivars were maintained at the COMAV Genebank.
These two genotypes are representative of the sub specific variation of C. pepo, are readily crossable and have
been selected as parentals of a RILs mapping population.
They have contrasting phenotypes for traits interesting
in squash breeding [15]: growth habit, sex expression,
fruit shape and color, parthenocarpy tendency, shelf life,
response to diseases., and are molecularly distant
enough for mapping purposes [20]. Seeds were germinated and grown in trays containing a mixture of peat
and sand. They were properly watered and grown at
day/night temperatures of 28/20°C with a 16-h photoperiod. From each variety, tissue was sampled from the
second and third true leaves, and from male and female
flowers in pre and post-anthesis stage. Also the whole
roots of 15 days-old plants were sampled. All tissues
were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C till use.
cDNA preparation and sequencing

Total RNA was extracted from each tissue using the
TRIzol ® Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). We combined
equivalent amounts of RNA from each tissue into two
pools, one per cultivar. mRNA was purified from the
total RNA using the illustraTM mRNA Purification Kit
(GE Healthcare, Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, UK). Double-stranded cDNA was then synthesized
from the two RNA pools with the SMART cDNA
Library Construction Kit (Clontech, USA). A normalization step was carried out with TRIMMER Kit (Evrogen,
Moscow, Russia) in order to prevent over-representation
of the most common transcripts. The PCR products of
cDNA were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Normalization quality of
cDNAs libraries was checked by quantitative PCR. The
cDNA length and normalization are critical factors to
have a good transcriptome representation, to have SNPs
along the whole gene sequence, and to have a high quality SNP prediction. Approximately 1 μg of doublestranded cDNA from each of the two normalized cDNA
pools were used for sequencing on a 454 GLX Titanium

The whole sequence analysis was carried out by using the
ngs_backbone pipeline [53]. The tools and analysis mentioned in the following sections were all performed by
ngs_backbone, but here the third party tools, databases,
and parameters used by ngs_backbone are described.
The raw 454 sequences were processed prior to the
assembly. To remove the adaptors an alignment with
the adaptors used during the sequencing process was
done by Exonerate [102]. The low quality regions were
removed by using Lucy [103]. Sequences shorter than
100 pb were discarded and not used for the assembly.
The processed 454 sequences were assembled with Mira
[54]. Default ngs_backbone options for this process
were used.
Cucurbita gene annotation

Structural and functional annotation was performed by
sequence comparison with public databases. All unique
assembled sequences (unigenes) were sequentially compared using blast (cutoff e value of 1e-20) with the
sequences in three major public protein databases,
prioritizing handmade annotation databases. The used
database order was Swiss-Prot [60], Arabidopsis proteins
[61] and UniRef90 [62]. Once a sequence had a blast hit
in one of the databases, a description was build from
the description of that hit. Also, a bi-directional blast
search comparison was performed in order to obtain a
set of putative orthologs with Arabidopsis [61] and
melon, using the melon unigenes contained in the
Cucurbits genomic database (ICUGI).
Additionally, we performed a functional classification of
the unigenes following the Gene Ontology (GO) scheme
[64]. Blast2GO [65] was used for this purpose. Blast2GO
used the results of a blast nr search (cutoff e value of 1e20) to infer the relevant GO terms for every sequence.
ORFs were predicted in the unigenes with the aid of the
ESTScan software [104]. We used the Arabidopsis codon
usage table to perform the ORF searching. Introns were
assigned by aligning the unigenes with the melon genomic
sequence using the Emboss: est2genome [105].
To assess codon usage, we used a set of the Cucurbita
unigenes predicted to contain full-length coding regions.
We performed a manual inspection, to ensure that no
sequences containing frame-shift errors were included
in the analysis. From this dataset, containing 4,118
sequences (529,864 codons), ORFs were defined and a
codon usage table was created.

Identification of SSRs and SNPs

SSRs were annotated using the Sputnik software [94].
Sequences containing ≥ 4 di-, tri-, or tetra-nucleotide
repeats were selected. A set of SSRs were validated using
the sequenced genotypes (the Zucchini MU16 and the
Scallop UPV96) and a set of 7 genotypes of C. pepo representative of the diversity within the species: representing 3
morphotypes of spp. pepo (3 additional zucchini, 1 vegetable marrow, 1 pumpkin, 1 Styrian pumpkin, an oil-pumpkin variety) and one additional morphotype of spp. ovifera
(1 croockneck) and 1 accession of C. moschata. Primer
pairs flanking each SSR locus were designed using the Primer3 program [106]. PCR reactions were performed in a
final volume of 15 μL with 1× PCR buffer (100 mM TrisHCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 500 mM KCl, pH 8.3), 200 μM
dNTPs, 0.15 μM each primer and 2 μL of template (aprox.
10 ng/μL). PCR was performed as follows: denaturation at
95°C for 3 min, followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s
at 65°C (with each cycle the annealing temperature
decreasing 1°C), and of 30 s at 72°C. Products were subsequently amplified for 20 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for
30 s and 72°C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 5
min. The forward primer was designed adding an M13 tail
to its 5’ end. PCR products were separated using 6% polyacrylamide gels, 1× TBE buffer in a LI-COR 4300. IRD700
and IRD800-labeled amplicons were visualized by adding
to PCR mixture 0.2 μM of fluorescent label (IR700 or
IR800) M13 tail.
This Cucurbita ESTs collection has been produced
using two representatives of the two C. pepo subspecies
appropriate for SNP discovery. Ngs_backbone was also
used to detect SNVs (Single nucleotide variations, SNPs
and INDELs) by mapping the 454 processed reads
against the unigene assembly using BWA (BurrowsWheeler Aligner) [107]. We only kept SNVs meeting
stringent quality criteria: 1) Minimum allele quality:
accumulated sequence quality for every allele; 2) Minimum mapping quality. The default threshold set by
ngs_backbone was set for both parameters.
Despite satisfying the quality criteria, not all the SNVs
seemed equally reliable. Several filters were applied in
order to maximize a successful validation and/or implementation in high throughput genotyping platforms
such as Golden gate genotyping assay [98,99]. For example, a filter to differentiate SNPs from INDELs (VKS: It
is not an SNP) was applied, and also a filter that dismisses SNVs in highly variable regions (HVR4: The
region has more than 4 SNVs per 100 bp). Other used
filter were; CS60 (SNV is closer than 60 bp to another
SNV), I60 (an intron is located closer than 60 bp), CL60
(SNV is closer than 60 bp to the sequence end),
NVSM1 (SNV is variable within UPV196 or not
sequenced in this genotype), NVSM2 (SNV is variable
within MU16 or not sequenced in this genotype).

Page 12 of 15

We also detected those SNVs that can be analyzed via
CAPS (searching for alele-specific restriction targets, filter CEF) and validated a subset of them. To do this
PCR conditions were used as described for SSRs and
fragments digested with the corresponding enzymes
were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis.
