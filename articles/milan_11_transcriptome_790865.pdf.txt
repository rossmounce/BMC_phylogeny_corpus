Abstract
Background: The Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, is one of the major aquaculture species in the world and a
potential sentinel organism for monitoring the status of marine ecosystems. However, genomic resources for R.
philippinarum are still extremely limited. Global analysis of gene expression profiles is increasingly used to evaluate
the biological effects of various environmental stressors on aquatic animals under either artificial conditions or in
the wild. Here, we report on the development of a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression profiling in
the Manila clam.
Results: A normalized cDNA library representing a mixture of adult tissues was sequenced using a ultra highthroughput sequencing technology (Roche 454). A database consisting of 32,606 unique transcripts was
constructed, 9,747 (30%) of which could be annotated by similarity. An oligo-DNA microarray platform was
designed and applied to profile gene expression of digestive gland and gills. Functional annotation of differentially
expressed genes between different tissues was performed by enrichment analysis. Expression of Natural Antisense
Transcripts (NAT) analysis was also performed and bi-directional transcription appears a common phenomenon in
the R. philippinarum transcriptome. A preliminary study on clam samples collected in a highly polluted area of the
Venice Lagoon demonstrated the applicability of genomic tools to environmental monitoring.
Conclusions: The transcriptomic platform developed for the Manila clam confirmed the high level of
reproducibility of current microarray technology. Next-generation sequencing provided a good representation of
the clam transcriptome. Despite the known limitations in transcript annotation and sequence coverage for non
model species, sufficient information was obtained to identify a large set of genes potentially involved in cellular
response to environmental stress.

Background
The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Adams &
Reeve, 1850) is a bivalve mollusc of the family Veneridae
native to the Indo-Pacific region. Because of its commercial value as seafood, this species has been introduced to other regions, where it has become
permanently established. In Europe it was first imported

in 1972 in France. Additional introductions occurred
from Oregon to the United Kingdom, followed by
numerous transfers within European waters for aquaculture purposes (Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Italy). Natural reproduction of introduced individuals favored
geographical expansion into the wild, particularly in
Italy, France, Spain and Ireland where the Manila clam
proved to be more resistant and grew faster than the
endemic carpet-shell clam, R. decussatus. Consequently,
R. philippinarum displaced its autochthonous congeneric species in most areas, and now represents the most
important species for commercial clam landings in

Europe. Globally, harvest of R. philippinarum has experienced a dramatic increase in the last 20 years, currently
representing one of the major aquacultured species in
the world (3.36 million metric tons in 2008). China is by
far the leading producer (97.4% of total annual production) while Italy has a smaller but yet conspicuous production of over 65,000 tonnes per year [1].
Despite the relevance of Manila clam landings in
world aquaculture, genomic resources for R. philippinarum are still extremely limited [2]. A small set of
genetic markers is available [3] and only 5,707 transcripts has been sequenced and are already available on
GENBANK. Although R. philippinarum is considered a
robust species, capable of adapting to a wide range of
environments, infectious diseases, chronic parasitic (e.g.
Perkinsus -like microorganisms) and bacterial (e.g.
brown ring bacterial disease) infections, it has been suffering mass mortality that have caused severe production losses in different areas (European Atlantic waters,
Yellow Sea) [1]. The impact of infections is often aggravated under particular environmental conditions, such
as extreme temperatures or limited availability of oxygen
or nutrients. However, massive mortalities are rarely
explained by a single parameter. An understanding of
the interactions among different biotic and abiotic factors influencing survival is therefore a high priority for
clam aquaculture. Functional genomics, or more specifically physiological genomics, i.e. a global analysis of
transcriptome responses to different conditions, offers
unprecedented opportunities to achieve such a goal. For
instance, a genomic analysis was recently used to investigate summer mortality in the Pacific oyster [4]. To this
end, the development of transcriptomic tools for the
Manila clam is the first necessary step.
A second and possibly more important application of
global gene expression profiling in R. philippinarum is
environmental monitoring. Genomic technologies are
increasingly used to evaluate the biological effects of
various chemical pollutants on aquatic animals under
either controlled conditions or in natural environments
(e.g. [5,6]). While several hurdles remain to be overcome, the outlook for eco-toxicogenomics is extremely
promising [7]. A sessile, filter-feeding organism living in
the seafloor sediment, R. philippinarum represents an
excellent “sentinel” species to assess the quality of marine environment. Two recent studies correlating different biochemical, cellular, and organismal markers with
levels of pollutants in the sediment [8] or accumulated
in the animals [9] support this view. However, a limited
set of multiple biomarkers is usually employed in most
of the studies. Therefore, a transcriptomic approach
could provide a much broader analysis of different biological processes allowing for an integrated description
of responses to xenobiotics [5,6].

The aim of the present study was to fill the gap in
transcriptome sequence data available for the Manila
clam and to develop a reliable and informative platform
for global gene expression profiling, to be then applied
to environmental monitoring. To this end, next-generation sequencing was coupled with a technology, in situ
synthesized oligo array, which has provided a robust and
flexible microarray platform in other species using conventional Sanger sequencing [10-18].
To date, 454 mollusc data are available only for Mytilus galloprovincialis and Bathymodiolus azoricus [19,20],
and to our knowledge, this is the first report of an oligo
DNA microarray developed using ultra-high throughput
pyrosequencing in a mollusc species. A free web-accessible database including extensive transcript annotation
and a blast search option was also developed in support
of the gene expression platform.
In order to assess the feasibility of this newly developed R.philippinarum microarray to toxicogenomics, a
preliminary investigation has been performed by profiling gene expression in gills and digestive glands of
clams sampled in the industrial area of Marghera, a
highly polluted site of the Venice Lagoon, compared to
animals sampled in a clean area of the lagoon of Venice.

Results and Discussion
Next-generation sequencing and hybrid contig assembly

Starting from a total of 463,424 sequences (see Methods), a first run of hybrid assembly grouped 191,624
reads (41%) into 40,477 contigs. The resulting assembled
sequences and the remaining singletons were then used
as input for a second MIRA run (see methods) of
assembly in order to produce meta-contigs from a fraction of partially redundant contigs obtained by the first
run. This approach produced a set of 32,606 contigs.
Summary statistics of the ESTs generated for R. philippinarum and their assembly are reported in Table 1.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of sequence length and
the relationship between length and average quality for
the 32,606 contigs. All Roche 454 FLX reads have been
deposited in GenBank (GenBank:SRR058508.1SRR058508.457717).
Transcriptome annotation

Putative identities of assembled contigs and meta-contigs were obtained by running Blastx and Blastn similarity searches on several protein and nucleotide databases
(see Additional file 1). Of 32,606 unique sequences,
7,907 (24%) showed at least one significant match (e <
10-5) in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. The
use of Blast2GO software allowed the association of one
or more GO terms to 6,867 R. philippinarum data base
entries. Of these, 2,788 were linked to “Biological Process” (BP) GO entries, 2,880 to “Cellular Component”

for MF. A simplified view of these GO terms using a
“Generic GO Slim” showed 46 BP, 30 CC, and 34 MF
classes (see Additional File 2).
In addition to the annotation with Blast2GO, Blast
searches against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database, UniProtKB/TrEMBL database and 26 different species-specific
data bases (see Additiona file 1) were implemented in order
to further increase the number of putatively annotated R.
philippinarum contigs (see Methods for details). This
approach provided a significant match for additional 1,840

transcripts, which showed no previous correspondence with
either the NCBI non-redundant protein or nucleotide database, and brought the final number of clam entries associated with a known protein or transcript to 9,747 (30%).
RuphiBase, a Ruditapes philippinarum database

All 32,606 contig sequences as well as different layers of
results for data analysis are available through RuphiBase
[21], a free web-accessible database implemented using
MySQL and Django web framework. RuphiBase is centered on contig sequence and annotation, and can be
searched by contig ID and key word match on different
textual fields. Moreover, it allows the user to conduct a
local BLAST search on the fly against the transcripts
database, in order to identify one or more transcripts
significantly similar to a given query sequence. Indeed,
massive and customizable data retrieval is provided by a
browsing system. For each contig, a gene-like entry
shows different data and bioinformatic analyses results
according to the scheme detailed below:
• Contig information. For each contig, identified by an
ID and a preliminary description, the FASTA sequence
is given, along with an informative contig description,
which is defined by the Blast2GO natural language text
mining functionality, applied to BLAST hits description.
The best hit is used when a BLAST2GO description is
unavailable.
• Assembly. The list of reads belonging to the contig is
given together with two FASTA files which include all
read sequences, contig with reads and ESTs sequences
and ACE format multiple alignment of the contig with
reads and ESTs.

Microarray quality assessment

A total of seven microarray experiments (three biological replicates for gills and four for the digestive gland)
were carried out. After data extraction, hybridization
success for each probe was inferred if flag “glsFound”
values was equal to 1 (see Methods). Across all experiments, only 131 probes (0.3%) never showed a signal
higher than the background, while 19,360 probes (46%)
were always successful and 37,379 (88%) were successful
in at least four experiments.
To evaluate the repeatability of the array results,
microarray data for the digestive gland (four biological
replicates, each replicate consisting of a pool of five
individuals) were normalized. The degree of mutual
agreement between replicates was assessed by estimating
the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) on the entire set

of expression values. Pairwise comparisons of replicate
experiments showed correlation coefficients with r >
0.99 and were always significant (p-value < 0.01) (see
Table 2), confirming a good reproducibility of the
microarray platform. Normalized fluorescence data for
these comparisons have been deposited in the GEO
database [22] under accession numbers GEO:GSE24050.
The Manila clam microarray platform is characterized
also by the presence of two duplicated probes, at different coordinates on the same array, for a total of 2,000
annotated transcripts. The variability between two identical probes for the same transcript was evaluated using
the ratio between the two probe intensity levels (foldchange, FC) as a measure of signal difference. This ratio
is expected to assume a value around 1. In Figure 2
each box plot describes the distribution of observed
fold-changes between Probe_1 and Probe_2 for each
array experiment in the digestive gland and gills pools.
This is symmetrical, centered around 1 and equal across
all the experiments. Concordance of hybridization signal
for probe pairs was confirmed by estimating Pearson
correlation coefficients between Probe_1 and Probe_2
for each gene across seven experiments. The correlation
coefficient was always greater than 0.95 and highly significant (p < 0.0001) (data not shown).
Comparison of gene expression in the digestive gland
and gills

Fluorescence data microarray experiments of three biological replicates consisting of pooled digestive glands
and three pools of gills sampled in Alberoni, a clean
area in the Venice Lagoon, were normalized and used to
identify genes that were differentially expressed in different tissues.
Digestive glands and gills were chosen because of their
relevant role on detoxification of xenobiotics as well as
filtration of suspended matter and as defense barrier,
respectively. These are cellular/organismal processes
crucial in the response to chemical pollutants and/or
pathogens exposure. Processed data were deposited in
the GEO database [22] under accession number
GSE24101. A two-unpaired class Significance Analysis
of Microarray (SAM) test was carried out on normalized
data, enforcing a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 3%. A
list of 10,159 significant probes, corresponding to 8,512
unique transcripts, was obtained. A total of 2,880 transcripts were up-regulated in pooled samples of digestive

gland compared to gills with a FC ranging from 3 to
23,550, while a total of 7,279 transcripts was up-regulated in the gills compared to the digestive gland with a
FC ranging from 3 to 18,200. A putative annotation
could be obtained for 3,491 genes that were differentially expressed in the two tissues (see Additional file 3).
A more systematic functional interpretation of the set of
differentially expressed genes was obtained by an enrichment analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software

[23] with two alternative strategies. In the first case, R.
philippinarum entries were matched to human Ensembl
Gene IDs, while in the second strategy R. philippinarum
entries were associated with zebrafish Ensembl Gene
IDs (see Methods). Human or zebrafish IDs corresponding to differentially expressed Manila clam transcripts
and to all genes represented on the array were then
used to define a “gene list” and a “background” in
DAVID, respectively. This allows functional annotation
of differentially expressed genes through enrichment

were involved in typical liver and pancreas metabolic
processes such as cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of xenobiotics, retinol metabolism and glutathione
metabolism. The digestive gland of molluscs is also
called “hepatopancreas” and integrates functions that
are liver- and pancreas-specific in vertebrates. A notch
signaling pathway was found among enriched KEGG
pathways, although with a low statistical significance
value (P = 0.09). This pathway has a role in timely cell

lineage specification of both endocrine and exocrine
pancreas.
Enrichment analysis on genes that were up-regulated in
gills showed 10 KEGG pathway terms, 36 BP-GO terms,
35 CC-GO terms and 11 MF-GO terms, all significantly
over-represented (see table 4). Genes over-expressed in
the gills were involved in different cellular functions,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.
Two signaling pathways, Wnt and JAK-STAT, appeared
to be significantly over-represented. The Wnt signaling
pathway, with 13 genes over-expressed in gills, describes a
complex network of proteins with a broad role in embryogenesis as well as in several cell processes of adult animals.
The JAK-STAT signaling pathway transduces information
from various chemical signals outside the cell to transcriptional regulation and it is involved in a wide array of cell
activities. Other significant pathways, RIG-I-like receptor,
NOD-like receptor, and Toll-like receptor signaling suggest a relevant role of immune response for the gills. This
is supported by the large amount of hemocytes present in
the gills and the presence of lectins and lysozyme among
differentially expressed genes (data not shown). Enrichment in genes involved in blood vessel and vascular development is expected in a highly vascularized tissue as the
gills, while over-representation of microtubule-associated
proteins might reflect the importance of cytoskeletal structures in gill epithelia.
Strand orientation and antisense transcripts

As already mentioned, a great majority of probes
showed a higher-than-background signal in four or
more experiments, and nearly all of them in at least
one. Since for 16,052 transcripts two probes with opposite orientation were designed, bi-directional transcription appears a common phenomenon in the clam
transcriptome. In fact, it is now clear that animal

genomes are transcribed on both strands [24-26] and it
is not to be excluded that part of the analyzed transcripts has a functional role [27]. In order to further
explore this issue, microarray data for digestive glands
and gills were analysed by examining sense-antisense
probe pairs. After the exclusion of probes with missing
data, absolute mean fluorescence signal values (f)
obtained across biological replicates after normalization
were divided into four classes (f < 10, 10 < = f < 100,
100 < = f < 1000, f < = 1000). Class assignment was
conducted by considering the mean fluorescence value
of the probe showing the lower signal for each pair
comparison. Likewise, Fold Change (FC) between sense
and antisense probes for each probe pair was assigned
to four classes (FC < 1.5, 1.5 < = FC < 3, 3 < = FC < 10,
FC > = 10). Our results showed that 75% and 73.5% of
probe-pairs had a signal ratio >3 in the gills and digestive gland, respectively, and 60% reported a signal ratio
>10 in both tissues (see Table 5). This suggested a prevalent strand-orientation for the majority of transcribed
regions in the clam genome. On the other hand, the
absolute fluorescence for the “minor” strand was greater
than 100 for 1,267 (8.8%) and 985 (6.5%) probe-pairs in
the gills and digestive gland, respectively. In addition, a
signal ratio < 3 and a minimum of fluorescence >100
was recorded for 223 (1.6%) probe-pairs in the gills and
151 (1%) probe-pairs in the digestive gland. These
results suggested that natural antisense transcripts
(NATs) may be present in the clam transcriptome. Natural antisense transcripts have been originally identified
by searching for EST collections, and appear to be widespread across species, although at different frequencies
[28]. Various putative functions have been proposed for
NATs [29]. For instance, an important role in the production of endogenous siRNAs is increasingly recognized [30]. A relevant question is whether NAT

The number of probes belonging to each Fold Change (FC) classes (FC < 1.5, 1.5 < = FC < 3, 3 < = FC < 10, FC > = 10) is reported. Probes are also distinguished
according to the mean fluorescence value of the probe showing the lower signal (FLS, Fluorescence Lower Signal).

transcription is correlated, either positively or negatively,
with the expression of their sense counterpart or it is
independent of it. This was evaluated by analyzing gene/
transcripts represented with both sense and antisense
probes pairs with SAM, in order to identify those that
were differentially expressed in gills and digestive glands
(see Table 6). Setting a threshold for FC to 1.5 and
enforcing a relatively stringent FDR (< 0.01), for 688
genes both probes presented a significant q value. Of
these, 658 showed concordant direction in sense/antisense regulation, while for 30 genes the two probes
were up-regulated in the gills and the digestive gland,
respectively. Under a less stringent FDR (< 0.1), 3,042
probe-pairs resulted differentially regulated, with a proportion of paired probes expressed in opposite directions (0.05) similar to the one observed above (0.04)..
Clam genomic markers for environmental monitoring

A wide array of biochemical, cellular, and whole-organism markers have been applied to evaluate the biological
effects of different types of pollutants in aquatic animals
and to assess the status of marine ecosystems [31,32].
For instance, over-expression of metallothioneins (MTs)
has been associated with exposure to heavy metals, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with organophosphorous, pesticide exposure, and induction of
Vitellogenin (Vg) proteins (egg-yolk precursors) with the
presence of xenoestrogens (endocrine-disruptors).
In the R. philippinarum platform developed in this
study at least four transcripts (ruditapes_c21946, ruditapes_c30181, ruditapes_c7664, ruditapes_c12315) that
appear to be AChE precursors and ten different
expressed sequences (ruditapes_lrc32058, ruditapes_lrc32676, ruditapes2_c61, ruditapes2_c830, ruditapes2_lrc2117, ruditapes2_lrc4331, ruditapes2_lrc4377,
ruditapes2_lrc4388, ruditapes2_lrc5136, ruditapes2_lrc5747) coding for a putative metallothionein
were incorporated into the microarray. Finally, a transcript (ruditapes_c16240) showing a significant match
with invertebrate Vg proteins was also included. It is
worth mentioning that the lack of a specific anti-Vg
antibody for many species impairs direct measure of
such biomarker, and only indirect estimates of Vg concentration can be obtained using an alkali-labile phosphate (ALP) assay.

At the cellular level, loss of lysosomal membrane
integrity has been observed as a consequence of oxidative stress induced by several class of chemicals.
Reduced lysosomal membrane stability is also linked to
increased autophagy [33]. To which extent these biochemical and cellular markers might be mirrored by
gene expression markers present in RuphiBase based on
GO-CC annotation, 73 lysosomal proteins including several cathepsins and other hydrolases could be found in
the current clam transcriptome. Of note is a putative
homolog (ruditapes_c23093) for Autophagic Transcript
12 (ATG12), an ubiquitin-like modifier necessary for
macroautophagy, while several RuphiBase entries match
with p14/ROBLD3, which is part of a protein complex
that recruits mTOR (Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin),
a key negative regulator of autophagy, to the lysosome
membrane [34]. Further studies may be conducted to
test whether chemical pollutants affecting lysosomal stability can induce alterations in expression levels of lysosomal and/or autophagy-related proteins. Indeed,
tributyltin chloride has recently been shown to inhibit
mTOR in neuronal cells [35].
A separate discussion is required for GSTs, which constitute a large protein family [36], with a pivotal role in
detoxification of xeno-compounds. These enzymes,
involved in the conjugation of reduced glutathione to
electrophilic centers on a wide variety of substrates, contribute to the detoxification of endogenous compounds
(e.g. peroxidised lipids) as well as xenobiotics, and an
increased GST activity has been observed after exposure
to a broad set of pollutants. A total of 118 RuphiBase
entries were annotated as putative GSTs of different subfamilies. Apart from four microsomal GSTs, putative
cytosolic GSTs were divided into five subfamilies: 61
GST-s, 21 GST-θ, 11 GST-π, 7 GST-μ, 4 GST-ω and 10
unclassified GST isoforms. Comparison of clam transcripts against single-species complete transcriptomes
revealed the highest number of matches (69) with zebrafish., 33 a-like GSTs, 7 GST-μ, and 29 GST-π isoforms
were identified. Human-clam comparison returned only
36 matches, although subfamily classification was more
complex with 6 GST-μ, 10 GST-π, 1 GST-ξ, 15 GST-θ
and 4 GST-ω isoforms. To further explore the incongruence between different annotations, we conducted a
detailed analysis of the 29 GST-π isoforms classified on

the basis of similarity against zebrafish. Eight transcripts
showed an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative complete coding sequence for GST, while four transcripts presented an ORF encoding a partial GST coding
sequence. The remaining sequences (17) contained either
partial or complete GST coding sequences with reading
frames interrupted by stop codons. Comparative
sequence analysis revealed that these frame-shifts were
always due to insertions/deletions (indels) within short
homopolymeric stretches, a known problem with 454
pyrosequencing technology [37]. A phylogenetic tree was
then reconstructed (see Figure 3) using the eight complete RuphiBase GSTs together with the best matching

protein from GenBank as well as from human and zebrafish putative homologs (see Methods). It is clear that the
classification based on comparison with zebrafish is
incorrect, hiding two groups of sequences, one belonging
to the s subfamily, the other containing bona fide GST-π
proteins. Using Blast results, the remaining 21 partial
and/or interrupted ORFs were assigned to one GST
sequence present in the tree in Figure 3, to obtain a classification of all 29 sequences originally assigned to the π
subfamily. A tree-like representation is better suited to
analyze and display the evolution of protein families or
sub-families including a large number of multiple gene
copies. The gene genealogy in Figure 3 is just an example

of what is expected in case of a significant multiplicity is
observed, as is the case of the the subset of GST-encoding transcripts analyzed here. To which extent different
GST sequences reflect the presence of distinct GST loci
in the clam genome? Pairwise comparison of best matching clam sequences across 29 GST-encoding transcripts
(average length 742 bp, range 286-1130 bp) showed that
one third of sequence differences (145 out of 14,042 surveyed bp, average 1%, range 0-3%) was due to indels, a
likely consequence of sequencing errors, but the majority
(269, average 1.9% range 0.1-11%) are nucleotide replacements, which are much less frequently observed with 454
pyrosequencing technology. For 15 sequences the closest
match has 1% sequence divergence, for 11 more than 2%.
Therefore, although part of the observed sequence diversity might be explained as different alleles of single GST
loci, a substantial number of GST isoforms appear to be
encoded by different genes. It should also be reminded
here that this is a conservative estimate because in most
comparisons only a fragment of the total sequence for
each transcript, generally the one encompassing the coding
region, was aligned (average 79%, range 33-100%). A similar problem of classification affects 21 sequences assigned
to the θ GST subfamily, with 18 transcripts finding a Pleuronectes platessa (plaice) θ GST as their best match in SwissProt. This plaice θ GST has been recently re-assigned to a
novel GST class, r [38]. Therefore, most clam sequences
attributed to the θ class might actually belong to this specific GST protein group, similar to the only putative θ GST
from a mollusk species isolated so far [39]. On the other
hand, the remaining three sequences matched either a
mammalian or a avian θ GST protein and might represent
the first evidence of molluscan θ GSTs.
A correct classification of GST proteins is often difficult [36], but it is mostly important when correlating
the expression of different GST-encoding genes with
exposure to specific groups of environmental pollutants,
as the various GST classes show diverse substrate specificities, catalytic properties, and tissue distribution.
Gene expression profiling of Manila clam sampled in a
polluted area of the Venice lagoon

The Venice lagoon, the largest in the Mediterranean sea,
is characterized by the presence of complex mixtures of
xenobiotics, derived from both industrial and domestic
effluents, which reach higher concentrations in specific
areas, mainly close to the industrial zone of Marghera.
Gene expression profiles of digestive glands and gills
from Manila clams harvested in a cleaner area (Alberoni) of the Venice lagoon were compared to the corresponding tissues of clams sampled within the industrial
area. This area shows high levels of contamination with
different xenobiotics, as confirmed in various studies
[40] and it is currently restricted for clam harvesting.

Page 10 of 18

For each tissue and comparison, raw and normalized
fluorescence have been deposited in the GEO data base
[22] under accession number GEO:GSE27194. A twounpaired class SAM test was carried out separately for
digestive glands and gills on normalized data, enforcing
a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 10% and Fold Change
(FC) of 1.5.
Comparison of expression profiles between the two
areas revealed a remarkably large number of differentially expressed transcripts in both tissues, respectively
1,127 in the digestive gland and 2,432 in the gills. A limited set of transcripts (99) showed differential expression
in both tissues. Fold-change differences varied from
-174- to 1,446-fold in the gills, with a prevalence for upregulated transcripts (1,412) compared to down-regulated ones (1,020) in samples collected in the industrial
area. This trend is reversed for transcripts displaying the
strongest signal, as 93 probes showed FC > 5 (13 with
FC > 10), whereas 120 ones presented FC < -5 (22 with
FC > 10). In the digestive gland, FC ranged between
-30- and 62-fold. A significant bias toward up-regulated
transcripts (852, 75% of all differentially expressed
sequences, binomial test p < 0.00001) was observed in
animals sampled in the industrial area, a bias that was
even stronger for transcripts showing FC larger than ±
5-fold (94 with FC > 5, 26 with FC < -5; binomial test p
< 0.000001).
Putative annotations were obtained respectively for
321 digestive gland- and 830 gills-specific transcripts by
comparison against the NCBI protein non redundant
database. When using the zebrafish transcriptome as a
reference, respectively 247 (digestive gland) and 730
(gills) differentially expressed sequences could be associated with one D. rerio Ensembl Gene IDs (see Addition file 4).
In a comparison between natural population samples
different environmental and/or physiological factors can
influence gene expression profiles. The objective of the
present study was to assess the role of chronic exposure
to high levels of chemical pollution. To control for the
effects of other factors, histological examination of collected animals was carried out showing similar sex ratio
(1:1), comparable levels of parasitic contamination, average size (12.3 gr vs 14 gr), and reproductive stage (data
not shown). Water temperature and salinity showed no
significant differences between the two analyzed areas.
Indeed, the temperature and salinity recorded at the
time of sampling were 18°C and 32 ‰ and 20°C and
34‰ in Marghera and Alberoni respectively. Likewise, it
seems quite difficult that strong genetic differentiation
occurs at a such a small geographic scale (few kilometres), in the presence of a planktonic larval phase and
a sustained water circulation within the Venice lagoon.
Although evidence on population genetics for the

Manila clam is limited, it has been shown that no
genetic structure was present across four population
samples in the Adriatic Sea, including the Venice lagoon
[41].
Systematic functional annotation of differentially
expressed transcripts, carried out through enrichment
analysis in DAVID (see Methods) confirmed a putative
role of pollution in the regulation of gene expression in
the examined samples, especially in the digestive gland.
This organ has been generally associated with response

to pollutants, particularly with detoxification of xenobiotics. Three significantly enriched GO_BP terms (see
Table 7), response to organic substances (GO:0010033),
to cadmium ion (GO:0046686), and to methylmercury
(GO:0051597), two enriched KEGG pathways, drug
metabolism (dre00982) and metabolism of xenobiotics
by cytochrome P450 (dre00980), support the evidence
that the digestive gland is responsible for detoxification
of environmental pollutants and suggests it as a target
organ for the detection/identification of biomarkers of

pollution. Manual annotation of significant transcripts
identified additional genes in the digestive gland with a
known role in the response to environmental pollution.
Four transcripts encoding MTs (ruditapes2_lrc4377,
ruditapes_lrc32058, ruditapes2_c830, ruditapes2_lrc4331)
and two encoding sulfotransferase (SULT) (ruditapes_c20565, ruditapes_c28883) (see Additional file 4)
are over-expressed in samples from the industrial zone.
MTs provide protection against metal toxicity, are
involved in the regulation of physiological metals (Zn
and Cu) and provide protection against oxidative stress.
MTs can be induced either by essential metals (Cu and
Zn) or non-essential ones (Cd, Ag and Hg) in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Increased levels of MTs after
experimental exposure to high Cu concentrations had
been already reported in the digestive gland of R. philippinarum [42], while higher MT protein expression had
been found in clams collected at sites nearby the industrial zone of Marghera [43-45].
SULTs, a family of phase II detoxification enzymes,
are involved in the homeostasis of endogenous compounds as well as in the protection against xenobiotics.
It is well known that sulfated products of environmental
xenobiotics are more water-soluble and easily excreted
from the body. Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)
exposed to Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
showed a marked induction of phenol-type sulfotransferase enzyme activity [46]. In addition, SULT1 was upregulated in Gadus morhua male sampled in two contaminated sites of western Norway [47]. Although these
genes play a documented role in the defense from chemicals [48], to our knowledge they have never been proposed as biomarkers in bivalve species.
AChE enzymatic activity is inhibited in response to
organophosphate insecticides and exposure to other pollutants. Eight different clam transcripts encoding a peptide with putative cholinesterase activity are represented
in the R. philippinarum microarray.
In the present study, an AChE-encoding gene (ruditapes_c12315) was over-expressed in both gills and digestive glands of clams sampled in Marghera. A similar
finding has been already reported by Somnuek et al.
(2009) [49], who demonstrated up-regulation of AChE
gene expression in hybrid catfish exposed to chlorpyrifos
and proposed this gene as biomarker for detecting the
effects of organophosphate insecticides. The apparently
opposite transcriptional response on AChE gene expression likely represents a compensatory modification to
counteract inhibition of enzyme activity after xenobiotic
exposure.
Several GST-coding transcripts were also found upregulated in samples collected in the polluted area. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) catalyses the conjugation of

variety of substrates. This activity detoxifies endogenous
compounds (e.g. peroxidised lipids) as well as xenobiotics and an increased of GSTs activity has been observed
after exposure to a broad set of xenobiotics.
GST-coding genes that are over-expressed in clams
sampled in Marghera either in the gills or in the digestive gland are different, except for a single transcript,
which is up-regulated in both tissues (Table 8). Tissuespecific expression and sensitivity to dose/type of chemicals has been already reported in bivalves [50,51], suggesting a complex regulation of these effectors in the
response to toxicants. Results obtained in the present
study show also that various GST classes/isoforms are
putatively involved in response to toxicants and emphasize the need for a proper classification of GST-coding
genes. Five classes of cytosolic GSTs are differentially
regulated together with a microsomal isoform in samples from the industrial area. Of special interest are two
distinct genes, both encoding a GST-θ isoform. As mentioned previously GSTs belonging to the θ class have
never been isolated in molluscs, and GSTθs apparently
represent a numerically minor component of the GST
arsenal in the Manila clam (3 putative θ isoforms
among over 100 GST-encoding transcripts), yet two
GSTθ-like genes showed marked up-regulation in putatively contaminated samples of the same species (see
Table 8). GST-like activity is one of the most relevant
biochemical parameters that are measured in environmental studies on chemical pollution, commonly using
1-choloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as a substrate
[52,53]. GST-θ enzymes, however, have a peculiar substrate specificity. GST- θ1 KO mice showed no difference for in vivo processing of CDNB, while GST-activity
against other substrates [1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)
propane (EPNP), dichloromethane (DCM), and 1,3-bis
(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU)] was significantly
lower after GST- θ 1 gene deletion. The results reported
in the present study suggest that measuring GST-like
enzymatic activity might not completely represent that

complex GST-based response to toxicants in bivalves.
Accurate characterization of GST-encoding genes in
species that are used for environmental monitoring
coupled with transcriptome analysis could provide a
more precise analysis of such a response, differentiating
tissue-specificity and disentangling GST isoform
diversity.

Conclusions
Whole-transcriptome analysis holds the promise to shed
light on the genetic mechanisms underlying cellular and
organismal response to physiological and pathological
conditions (environmental stress, infections, chemical
pollution). This is of particular importance for improved
shellfish aquaculture and for cost-effective environmental monitoring. The aim of the present paper was to lay
the foundations for transcriptomics in the Manila clam.
To which extent this goal has been achieved? As
demonstrated in previous studies [54], the use of nextgeneration sequencing technology yielded a number of
expressed sequences unattainable until only recently. In
our study, sequence assembly, annotation and development of a dedicated database resulted in a searchable,
functionally annotated transcriptome for R. philippinarum (RuphiBase), which was then used to design a
species-specific in-situ synthesized oligo microarray.
This genomic platform has proven to provide reliable
and highly reproducible results for global gene expression profiling [10-18]. Moreover, validation of the clam
oligo microarray showed tissue-specific expression profiles and highly significant correlations across biological
replicates. The current version of RuphiBase appears to
offer already a good representation of the clam transcriptome, as shown by the broad array of potential
markers of response to xenobiotics. Of particular relevance is the large number (>100) of GST-encoding transcripts observed in the Manila clam, which suggested a
potential relationship between filter-feeding behaviour,
ability to cope with high levels of pollution and availability of a wide array of detoxifying enzymes. The possible use of this microarray platform for toxicogenomic
studies has been also demonstrated by comparative analysis of digestive glands and gills pool of Manila clam
sampled in areas with different levels of chemical pollution of the Venice Lagoon.
On the other hand, despite the use of ultra-high
throughput sequencing on normalized cDNA libraries
constructed from all adult tissues, representation of the
clam transcriptome is still incomplete. For instance, the
signaling pathway for autophagy consists of at least 18
different components [55], yet only one of these,
ATG12, a protein involved in autophagic vescicle assembly, was identified. The problem of incomplete representation of protein-coding transcripts will likely be solved

Page 13 of 18

in the near future, when reduction of sequencing costs
and an increase in sequencing throughput will allow a
much deeper sequence coverage even for non-model
species transcriptomes. A more difficult issue to solve is
the limited percentage of clam transcripts that can be
matched against a known protein-coding gene. The
large phylogenetic distance of the phylum Mollusca
from other metazoan model species (e.g. Drosophila
melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Mus
musculus, Homo sapiens) greatly reduces the power of a
comparative approach for functional annotation. The
only molluscan genome sequenced so far is that of L.
gigantea, a gasteropod snail, which is functionally and
evolutionarily distant from the class Bivalvia.
To conclude on a positive note, the next “call on
(genomic) stage” is for the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea
gigas. For this bivalve mollusk species, a high quality
draft genome sequence is expected in 2011 thanks to
the efforts of the Oyster Genome Consortium. Furthermore, worldwide aquaculture production of oysters
amounts to over 4 million metric tons. The economic
importance of the Pacific oyster has fuelled a large number of studies on the ecology, physiology, immunology,
and genetics of C. gigas populations, and the possibility
of targeted gene knock down has been recently demonstrated [56]. The opportunity of having a bivalve model
species available would allow a more accurate genome
annotation for other important molluscs such as the
Manila clam.

Methods
Sampling, cDNA library costruction and sequencing

Samples of R. philippinarum were bought in a local
market in Faro. In order to improve RNA representatively, clams were stressed by submitting them to quick
changes of temperature and salinity prior to be sacrificed. Total RNA was extracted from all tissues of 20
individuals using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method [57].
Two libraries were constructed, one using a mixture
of adult tissues and a second one using gonadal tissues
and 2 to 4 mm long larvae.
A cDNA library was constructed using equal amounts
of RNA and normalized for sequencing. The SMART
(Switching Mechanism At 5’ end of RNA Template) kit
from BD Biosciences Clontech was used to construct
the cDNA libraries which were later normalised using
the duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) method [58].
Approximately 15 μg of normalized cDNA were used
for sequencing library construction at the Max Planck
Institute, following procedures described in [59].
Sequencing was performed using GS FLX Titanium series reagents and using one single region on a Genome
Sequencer FLX instrument. Bases were called with 454

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/234

software by processing the pyroluminescence intensity
for each bead-containing well in each nucleotide incorporation. Reads were trimmed to remove adapter
sequences.
Contigs assembly

A total of 457,717 sequence reads were produced using
Roche 454 FLX technology from the normalized cDNA
library constructed using a mixture of adult tissues (see
above). The same library was previously used to obtain
2,866 ESTs with Sanger sequencing. An additional set of
2,790 ESTs was available from a second normalized
cDNA library (whole larvae and adult gonads). In addition, 51 mRNA sequences available in NCBI (as to 11th
November 2009) for R. philippinarum were available.
454 Sequence reads and all previously ESTs accessible
in the NCBI database were then assembled into contigs,
representing putative transcripts, by using a custom procedure based on two runs of MIRA3 assembly [60] and
quality-based filtering. All contigs obtained with the first
run of hybrid assembly were used for a second run to
eliminate contig redundancy. Threshold values on contigs length and sequence quality were then applied to
obtain a final set of contigs representing R. philippinarum transcripts.
Transcripts annotation

The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was
used to perform annotation of R. philippinarum contigs.
Batch Blast similarity searches for the entire set of contigs were locally conducted against NCBI (National Centre for Biotechnology Information) amino acidic non
redundant (nr) database (release of October 4 2009)
using Blastx option. Alignments with an E-value of at
most 1 E-3 were considered significant and up to 20
hits per contig were taken into account.
To improve the number of annotated contigs five different approaches were attempted (see Additional file 1):
i) blastx searches (cut off e-value of < 1.0 E-3) against
protein database UniProtKB/SwissProt and UniProtKB/
TrEMBL [61], ii) blastx (cut off e-value of < 1.0 E-3)
and blastn (cut off e-value of < 1.0 E-5) searches against
proteins and high quality draft trascriptomes of Danio
rerio, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Oryzias latipes, Takifugu
rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster available on Ensembl Genome Browser (release 56) [62], iii) blastx (cut off e-value of < 1.0
E-3) and blastn (cut off e-value of < 1.0 E-5) searches
against proteins, transcripts and assembly scaffolds of
Lottia gigantea v1.0 database [63], iv) blastn search (cut
off e-value of < 1.0 E-5) against D. rerio, L. gigantea, O.
latipes, T. rubripes, Salmo salar, H. sapiens, Oncorhynchus mykiss databases stored in NCBI UniGene database [64], v) blastn search (cut off e-value of < 1.0 E-5)

Page 14 of 18

against Crassostrea gigas transcripts database [65] and
Argopecten irradians EST database [66].
The Gene Ontology (GO) terms associations for “Biological process”, “Molecular function” and “Cellular
component” were performed using Blastx algorithm
against the NCBI amino acid nr database implemented
in Blast2GO software [67]. The “Generic GO slim” [68]
set of the CateGOrizer program [69] was used to have
an overview of the gene ontology content by simplifying
the results of the GO annotation.
DNA microarray design

Probe design started with selection of target sequences
to be represented onto the R. philippinarum microarray.
All annotated entries (9,747) were included. Non annotated transcripts were considered only if sequence length
was ≥400 bp and average Phred sequence quality was
≥30, yielding 24,291 target sequences. As most sequence
reads were obtained from a non directional cDNA
library, sense strand orientation was inferred putatively
from that of homologuous protein sequences of other
species (see Methods).
One probe for annotated transcripts with known orientation was designed to construct a high-density oligoDNA microarray, while two probes with both orientations were designed for contigs with ambiguous orientation. The same strategy was applied to unknown unique
transcripts. For 8,239 contigs, the putative orientation
was unambiguous across different databases and a single
sense probe was designed. Two probes with opposite
orientation (sense and antisense) were designed for a
fraction of clam annotated transcripts (1,508 contigs)
with ambiguous putative orientation and for non annotated sequences (14,544). Probe design was carried out
using the Agilent eArray interface [70], which applies
proprietary prediction algorithms to design 60 mer oligoprobes. Microarrays were synthesized in situ using the
Agilent ink-jet technology with a 4 × 44 K format. Each
array included default positive and negative controls.
A total of 40,332 out of 40,343 (99.9%) probes, representing 24,281 R. philippinarum transcripts were successfully obtained. Of these, 2,000 probes designed on
known-orientation transcripts, were synthesized in
duplicate on the array in order to test for “reproducibility-within-array”. The percentage of annotated transcripts represented on the microarray was 40.1%. Probe
sequences and other details on the microarray platform
can be found in the GEO database [22] under accession
number GEO:GPL10900.
Sample collection, RNA extraction, labeling and
hybridization

The common bivalves R. philippinarum were collected
during autumn 2009 in two different areas of Venice

Milan et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:234
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/234

Lagoon characterized by different levels of environmental pollutants: Marghera and Alberoni (see Additional
file 5).
Digestive gland and gills were dissected from 20 Manila clamsfor each sampling area. Four and three independent pools, for digestive gland and gills respectively,
each consisting of 5 digestive gland or gills, were
created.
Total RNA was extracted from pooled tissue samples
using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was determined using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, NanoDrop® ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, USA). RNA integrity and quality was
finally estimated on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).
Sample labeling and hybridization were performed
according to the Agilent One-Color Microarray-Based
Gene Expression Analysis protocol. Briefly, for each
pool 200 ng of total RNA were linearly amplified and
labeled with Cy3-dCTP. A mixture of 10 different viral
poly-adenilated RNAs (Agilent Spike-In Mix) was added
to each RNA sample before amplification and labeling,
to monitor microarray analysis work-flow. Labeled
cRNA was purified with Qiagen RNAeasy Mini Kit, and
sample concentration and specific activity (pmol Cy3/μg
cRNA) were measured in a NanoDrop® ND-1000 spectrophotometer. A total of 1,650 ng of labeled cRNA was
prepared for fragmentation adding 11 μl 10X Blocking
Agent and 2.2 μl of 25X Fragmentation Buffer, heated at
60°C for 30 min, and finally diluted by addition with 55
μl 2X GE Hybridization buffer. A volume of 100 μl of
hybridization solution was then dispensed in the gasket
slide and assembled to the microarray slide (each slide
containing four arrays). Slides were incubated for 17 h
at 65°C in an Agilent Hybridization Oven, subsequently
removed from the hybridization chamber, quickly submerged in GE Wash Buffer 1 to disassembly the slides
and then washed in GE Wash Buffer 1 for approximately 1 minute followed by one additional wash in
pre-warmed (37°C) GE Wash Buffer 2.
Data acquisition and analysis

Hybridized slides were scanned at 5 μm resolution using
an Agilent G2565BA DNA microarray scanner. Default
settings were modified to scan the same slide twice at
two different sensitivity levels (XDR Hi 100% and XDR
Lo 10%). The two linked images generated were analyzed together and data were extracted and background
subtracted using the standard procedures contained in
the Agilent Feature Extraction (FE) Software version
9.5.1. The software returns a series of spot quality measures in order to evaluate the goodness and the reliability of spot intensity estimates. All control features

Page 15 of 18

(positive, negative, etc.), except for Spike-in (Spike-in
Viral RNAs), were excluded from subsequent analyses.
Spike-in control intensities were used to identify the
best normalization procedure for each dataset. After
normalization, spike intensities are expected to be uniform across the experiments of a given dataset. Normalization procedures were performed using R statistical
software [71]. Quantile normalization always outperformed cyclic lowess and quantile-normalized data were
used in all subsequent analyses.
Statistical tests implemented in the program Significance
Analysis of Microarray (SAM) [72] were used to identify
differentially expressed genes between digestive gland and
gill tissues. The same approach was used to identify differentially expressed genes in both digestive glands and gills
between MA and AL sampled individuals.
Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated within
and among arrays with Statgraphics Centurion XVI to
evaluate repeatability and precision of the obtained
microarray data.
Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes

Functional annotation analysis of differentially expressed
genes was performed using the DAVID (Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)
web-server [23].
Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
between gills and digestive glands was achieved using
DAVID software. “Biological process”, “Molecular function” and “Cellular component” annotation was carried
out by setting gene count = 10 and ease = 0.05. KEGG
pathway analysis was then performed with gene count =
4 and ease = 0.05. David analyses of differentially
expressed genes between Manila clam tissues sampled
in Alberoni and Marghera were performed by setting
gene count = 2 and ease = 0.1 Since DAVID databases
contain functional annotation data for a limited number
of species, it was necessary to link R. philippinarum
transcripts with sequence identifiers that could be
recognized in DAVID (Ensembl Human Gene IDs and
Ensembl Zebrafish Gene IDs). This was carried out
through dedicated Blast searches implemented as follows: i) blastx and blastn options were both used to
search significant matches of the Manila clam sequences
directly against human Ensembl proteins and transcripts
respectively, ii) a first search was performed using either
blastn or blastx against all zebrafish Ensembl proteins.
Finally, Homo sapiens Ensembl Gene IDs were obtained
from the corresponding Ensembl protein entries using
the BIOMART data mining tool [73].
Evolutionary analyses

Evolutionary analyses were performed to determine patterns of divergence of the GST genes in R.

philippinarum and to define putative orthology between
GST genes in different species. Protein sequences of
GST domains were aligned using TCoffee [74] applying
default settings, while GBlock [75] was used to eliminate
poorly aligned positions and divergent regions prior to
phylogenetic analysis.
GST sequences described from Homo sapiens, Haliotis
discus, Unio timidus, Cristaria plicata, Mytilus edulis,
Mytilus galloprovincialis, Danio rerio, Dreissena polymorpha, Chlamys farreri, Corbicula fluminea, Mercenaria, mercenaria, Laternula elliptica, Mactra
veneriformis, Cipangopaludina cathayensis were
included in the alignment.
Phylogenetic trees were inferred by the maximum likelihood (ML) method [76] using the Phyml 2.4.4 program
[77]. Non-parametric bootstrap resamplings were performed to evaluate the robustness of tree topology.
