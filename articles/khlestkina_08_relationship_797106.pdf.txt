Abstract
Background: The patterns of expression of homoeologous genes in hexaploid bread wheat have
been intensively studied in recent years, but the interaction between structural genes and their
homoeologous regulatory genes remained unclear. The question was as to whether, in an
allopolyploid, this interaction is genome-specific, or whether regulation cuts across genomes. The
aim of the present study was cloning, sequence analysis, mapping and expression analysis of F3H
(flavanone 3-hydroxylase – one of the key enzymes in the plant flavonoid biosynthesis pathway)
homoeologues in bread wheat and study of the interaction between F3H and their regulatory genes
homoeologues – Rc (red coleoptiles).
Results: PCR-based cloning of F3H sequences from hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),
a wild tetraploid wheat (T. timopheevii) and their putative diploid progenitors was employed to
localize, physically map and analyse the expression of four distinct bread wheat F3H copies. Three
of these form a homoeologous set, mapping to the chromosomes of homoeologous group 2; they
are highly similar to one another at the structural and functional levels. However, the fourth copy
is less homologous, and was not expressed in anthocyanin pigmented coleoptiles. The presence of
dominant alleles at the Rc-1 homoeologous loci, which are responsible for anthocyanin
pigmentation in the coleoptile, was correlated with F3H expression in pigmented coleoptiles. Each
dominant Rc-1 allele affected the expression of the three F3H homoeologues equally, but the level
of F3H expression was dependent on the identity of the dominant Rc-1 allele present. Thus, the
homoeologous Rc-1 genes contribute more to functional divergence than do the structural F3H
genes.
Conclusion: The lack of any genome-specific relationship between F3H-1 and Rc-1 implies an
integrative evolutionary process among the three diploid genomes, following the formation of
hexaploid wheat. Regulatory genes probably contribute more to the functional divergence between
the wheat genomes than do the structural genes themselves. This is in line with the growing
consensus which suggests that although heritable morphological traits are determined by the
expression of structural genes, it is the regulatory genes which are the prime determinants of allelic
identity.

Background
The flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is central to the formation of the phenolic compounds involved in many
plant traits, including resistance to abiotic and biotic
stresses [1-4]. One branch of the pathway is responsible
for the generation of anthocyanin, which is present in various plant organs in most plant species, including the allohexaploid crop species, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).
Two major groups of anthocyanin pigmentation genes are
present in wheat: the first includes Rc-1, Pc-1, Pan-1, Plb-1
and Pls-1 which encode the pigmentation in, respectively,
the coleoptile, culm, anthers, leaf blades and leaf sheaths;
while the second consists of Pp and Ra, which are
expressed in, respectively, the pericarp and auricle [5]. The
former genes are closely linked to one another on each of
the short arms of the homoeologous group 7 chromosomes. An orthologue of maize gene c1 (which encodes a
Myb-like transcriptional factor controlling tissue-specific
anthocyanin biosynthesis [6]) was mapped earlier on
each of the short arms of wheat homoeologous group 7
chromosomes, too [7] in positions highly comparable to
those of Rc-1 (red coleoptile) genes [5,8]. Furthermore, it
was shown that c1, when transferred to wheat, was able to
induce anthocyanin pigmentation in non-pigmented
wheat coleoptiles [9]. At the same time Rc-1 was shown to
upregulate a number of wheat flavonoid biosynthesis
pathway genes – DFR (dihydroflavonol-4-reductase),
ANS (anthocyanidin synthase) and UFGT (UDPG flavonol 3-0-glucosyl transferase) [10,11]. Recognizing elements for c1 have also been identified in the promoter
sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana F3H gene (flavanone 3hydroxylase – one of the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoid compounds [12]), suggesting that
Rc-1 can probably exert a regulatory role for wheat F3H,
too. F3H orthologues have been isolated in barley and
maize [13,14] as well as in a range of other plant species

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Database/, but have yet to
be described in wheat.
The patterns of expression of homoeologous genes in
wheat have been intensively studied in recent years [1521], but the interaction between structural genes and their
homoeologous regulatory genes is unclear. The question
remains as to whether, in an allopolyploid, this interaction is genome-specific, or whether regulation cuts across
genomes. The Rc-1 and F3H genes are a suitable model to
investigate just this issue, as the expression of Rc-1 generates a clear phenotype, and the latter are well-characterized at the molecular level. In this paper, we describe the
cloning, sequence analysis, mapping and expression of
F3H orthologues in bread wheat and its relatives, and the
interaction between F3H and the Rc-1 homoeologues.

Results
Sequence analysis of F3H genes in wheat and its relatives
Nine F3H copies were isolated by PCR cloning from bread
wheat (genome AABBDD), the tetraploid wild wheat T.
timopheevii (AAGG) and the presumed diploid progenitors of the A, B/G and D genomes (A: T. urartu, B/G:Ae.
speltoides, D: Ae. tauschii) (Table 1). Four of the copies
were isolated from bread wheat. The length of the coding
sequence, which was split into three exons, was 1137 bp,
and the first intron varied in length among the homoeologues by some hundreds of base pairs (Figure 1). The
sequence of the segments of the first intron of the bread
wheat copies F3H1, F3H2 and F3H3 not affected by deletions/insertions shared over 80% homology, but the first
intron of F3H4 was quite distinct. Sequence alignment of
T. aestivum F3H sequences (coding regions) with barley
F3H [13] is shown in Figure 2a. Sequence comparisons
between exon 2 of the Triticum and Aegilops F3H genes (as
well as other F3H sequences lodged in GenBank) are illus-

trated as dendrogram in Figure 2b. The F3H4 sequence
departs significantly from that of the other Triticum and
Aegilops copies (Figure 2). T. aestivum F3H1 and T.
timopheevii F3H1t sequences are probably derived from the
A genome, whereas F3H2 and F3H2t are suggested to
belong to the genomes D and G, respectively (Figure 2b).
F3H3 occupies an intermediate position between the two
main Triticum-Aegilops clusters (Figure 2b). Patterns of
sequence divergence across the structural region of wheat
F3H1 and F3H2 suggest that the second exon is the most
variable at the nucleotide level, but is most well conserved
at the amino acid level (Figure 3, Table 2). Exon 2, intron
2 and the beginning of exon 3 (Segment 3, see Figure 1)
were re-sequenced from a panel of seven diverse bread
wheat genotypes, but no intraspecific variation was
detected.
Chromosomal assignment and physical mapping of F3H
genes in hexaploid wheat
Primer pairs amplifying specifically fragments from individual F3H copies (referred further as "gene copy-specific
primer pairs") were designed and used in PCR analysis of
'Chinese Spring' nulli-tetrasomic lines. It was shown that
F3H1 and 2 are on, respectively, chromosomes 2A and
2D, while 3 and 4 both map to chromosome 2B (Table 1,
Figure 4). A deletion line analysis was then used to define
the intra-chromosomal location of F3H1 to the sub-terminal bin (2AL3) of chromosome 2AL, both F3H3 and F3H4
to the terminal bin (2BL6) of chromosome 2BL, and
F3H2 to the terminal bin (2DL6) of chromosome 2DL
(Figure 5). Since the location of F3H3 and F3H4 could not
be distinguished by this method, an introgression line
derived from the cross T. aestivum × T. timopheevii, which
contains a 2BL/2GL breakpoint within chromosome bin
2BL6 between the microsatellite loci Xgwm1067 and
Xgwm0526 [22], was used to show that F3H3 and -4 are
discrete loci (Figure 6a and 6b, respectively). F3H3 lies
proximal to the to the 2BL/2GL breakpoint, whereas F3H4
location is distal. A specific PCR assay for the T. timopheevii
F3H2t sequence (Figure 6c) proved that it, like T. aestivum
F3H3, too lies proximal to the 2BL/2GL breakpoint, thus
suggesting that these two loci, along with F3H1 and F3H2,
belong to an F3H homoeoallelic series, whereas F3H4
appears to be a non-homoelogous duplication. Accordingly, the genes were re-designated F3H-A1 (F3H1), F3H-

B1 (F3H3), F3H-D1 (F3H2), F3H-G1 (F3H2t) and F3H-B2
(F3H4).
Expression analysis of F3H in lines with and without
pigmented coleoptiles
To explore the role of the Rc-1 (red coleoptile) genes as
regulators for F3H expression, eight progeny from the
cross 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7B) × 'TRI 2732', along with
a set of six different chromosome 7D introgression lines
of Ae. tauschii into 'Chinese Spring', varying with respect
to the dominant allele at either Rc-B1 or Rc-D1, were subjected to RT-PCR analysis from cDNA derived from four
day old seedlings. The parental genotypes with pigmented
coleoptiles ('Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7B) and 'Chinese
Spring (Ae. tauschii 7D) both showed a high level of F3H
expression, whereas those with non-pigmented coleoptiles showed either little ('TRI 2732') or none ('Chinese
Spring') (Figure 7). When this result was compared with
the microsatellite-based genotype of the lines [8,23], the
regulator of F3H expression on chromosome 7B was
mapped between Xgwm0263 and Xgwm0573, co-segregating with Rc-B1 (Figure 7a); similarly, the equivalent locus
on chromosome 7D co-segregated with Rc-D1 within the
genetic interval Xgwm0044 and Xgwm0111 (Figure 7b).
RT-PCR was also used to study contribution of single
genes F3H-A1, F3H-B1, F3H-B2 and F3H-D1 to total F3H
expression. It was shown that F3H-B2 is not expressed
whether or not the coleoptiles are pigmented (Figure 8).
In contrast, F3H-A1, F3H-B1 and F3H-D1 were actively
expressed in lines with pigmented coleoptiles ('Chinese
Spring' ('Hope' 7B) and respective recombinant lines; Figure 8, lines 1, 3, 4, 9, 10), whereas those with non-pigmented coleoptiles ('TRI 2732' and respective
recombinant lines) showed a low level of expression of
only F3H-A1 and F3H-B1 (Figure 8: faint bands in lines 2,
5–8, respectively).
Temporal pattern and the genome specificity of F3H
expression
To investigate the possibility of more subtle differences
between expression levels of the F3H homoeologues in
presence of particular alleles of Rc-1, quantitative RT-PCR
was applied to a set of cDNAs sampled from two to six day
old seedlings (Figure 9). The test genotypes were 'Chinese
Spring' ('Hope' 7A) [Rc-A1b], 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7B)

[Rc-B1b] and cv. 'Mironovskaya 808' [Rc-D1b], along with
the control 'Chinese Spring' which carries the non-pigmented alleles at all three Rc-1 loci. In the latter, none of
the F3H copies was expressed at any time during the sampling period. F3H-B2 was not expressed in any of three
test line seedlings, but F3H-A1, F3H-B1 and F3H-D1 were
all expressed in these lines. No within genotype significant difference (p = 0.05) in the expression level of the
three homoeologues could be detected at any of the sampling times (Table 3). However, the overall level of F3H
expression differed very significantly between each pair of
lines (Table 4). The level was lowest in 'Mironovskaya
808' and highest in 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7A). The
highest expression level in 'Mironovskaya 808' was
reached three days after germination, while in 'Chinese
Spring' ('Hope' 7A) and 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7B), the
maximum was detected on the fourth day. In 'Chinese
Spring' ('Hope' 7B), expression started later and declined
more rapidly than in 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7A). The
delayed start and lower total level of expression in 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7B) was consistent with the observed
temporal development of pigmentation in the coleoptiles.
Overall, therefore, each Rc-1 gene appeared to regulate the
expression of the three F3H homoeologues equally, but
the level of F3H expression was dependent on the identity
of the dominant Rc-1 allele present.

Discussion
Cloning and analysis of F3H sequences
F3H genes have been isolated from barley, maize and Arabidopsis thaliana [13,14,24] as well as from a range of other
plant species http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Database/. In

wheat, only one single partial F3H sequence has been
published to date [11]. The relationship between the
wheat and Aegilops sp. F3H sequences reported here (with
the exception of F3H-B2) and those lodged in GenBank
(Figure 2) is consistent with standard taxonomic treatment [25] and with known phylogenies within the Triticum/Aegilops complex [26]. The F3H sequences of diploid
progenitors of wheat were useful for the genome assignment of the homoeologous gene copies in polyploid
wheat. The substantial structural divergence between F3HB2 and that of three F3H-1 homoeologues is accompanied
by a functional difference. The lack of F3H-B2 expression
in pigmented coleoptiles does not reflect its complete
non-functionality, since a highly identical root EST has
been reported (Table 1, Figure 10). The presence of two B
genome copies of F3H is not a particularly unusual result,
as F3H copy number in diploids varies from one
[13,14,24] to two [27,28]. Silent divergence (Ka/Ks)
appears to be homogeneously distributed throughout the
coding region of Arabidopsis thaliana F3H, being rarest in
the second, and most frequent in the third exon [29]. A
similar pattern applies to the wheat A and D genome F3H
homoeologues (Figure 3, Table 2).
A PCR-based cloning approach has been used to clone
other flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes in hexaploid
wheat (Table 5), whereas in barley and other diploid species they have been isolated from cDNA libraries [13,30].
It has recently become clear that not all members of a
homoeologous series in wheat are co-expressed
[16,18,31], so the genomic PCR-based cloning approach
is probably the more preferable strategy to capture a full

set of homoeologues. Although PCR-based cloning has
some disadvantages when applied in an allopolyploid
(specifically in the generation of PCR chimeras – however,
this problem can usually be overcome by the cloning and
sequencing of several replicates), it is an effective strategy
for the design of gene copy-specific primers, the chromosomal localization of genes and expression analysis.
Expression of the three homoeologous F3H loci in lines
with and without pigmented coleoptiles
The patterns of expression of flavanone 3-hydroxylase in
lines with and without pigmented coleoptiles indicated
that Rc-B1 and Rc-D1 are coincident with the genes regu-

lating its expression (Figure 7). This is in accordance with
the suggestion that Rc-1 genes exert a regulatory role for
F3H genes, which could be made on the base of combined
results obtained earlier [5-9,12]. The patterns of temporal
expression among the F3H homoeologues in the presence
of different dominant Rc-1 alleles allowed for an examination as to whether, in an allopolyploid context, there are
any genome-specific relationships between the structural
and regulatory genes. No such relationship was apparent,
since in pigmented coleoptiles, F3H-A1, F3H-B1 and F3HD1 were all expressed at a similar level (Figure 9). Many
sets of wheat homoeologous genes are known to be
equally expressed in this way [16,19,21], but in others, the

expression of one or more members may be either completely [16,18,31] or partially [15,20,21] suppressed.
Generally, when F3H homoeologues are expressed
actively (as in pigmented coleoptiles), then they are
expressed equally, but where overall F3H transcription
level is low, then selective expression of F3H homoeologues could be observed (i.e. F3H-A1 and F3H-B1 were
expressed in the green coleoptiles of 'TRI 2732', but F3HD1 was not; Figure 8). These outcomes are consistent with
the activity-selectivity principle [32] acting at the transcriptional level.
Functional difference between homoeologous Rc-1 genes
Whereas each dominant Rc-1 allele affects the expression
of each of the three F3H homoeologues equally, overall
F3H expression was dependent on the identity of which

dominant Rc-1 allele was present (Figure 9). This difference was observed not only at specific time points, but
also from the total amounts of F3H mRNA produced over
the period of coleoptile pigmentation. The delayed start of
expression and the lesser level of transcript present in
'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7B) compared to 'Chinese
Spring' ('Hope' 7A) was consistent with the observed
accumulation of pigmentation in the coleoptile, both in
the present experiments and in those reported earlier [33].
In order to test for background effects on F3H expression
or variability within transcriptional factors encoded by
dominant Rc-1 alleles in other genotypes, it would be of
interest to investigate the extent to which the profiles of
F3H expression of 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7A), 'Chinese
Spring' ('Hope' 7B) and 'Mironovskaya 808' are typical,
i.e. for instance to compare profile of 'Mironovskaya 808'

to those of some other varieties carrying the same dominant allele (Rc-D1).

Conclusion
There are at least four flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene copies in the hexaploid genome of bread wheat, three of
which are the homoeologues on chromosomes 2AL, 2BL
and 2DL, highly similar at structural and functional level,
while the fourth one represents a distinct non-homoeologous copy on chromosome 2BL with suppressed expression in red coleoptiles.
Expression of the F3H homoeologues (F3H-1) in wheat
coleoptiles is determined by the presence of dominant
alleles in Rc-1 (red coleoptiles) loci. Rc-1 and F3H-1 genes
represent a suitable model to investigate relationship
between homoeologous regulatory and homoeologous
structural genes in allopolyploid wheat genome (which
have never been studied before). The lack of any genomespecific relationship between F3H-1 and Rc-1 observed in
the present study implies an integrative evolutionary process among the three diploid genomes, following the formation of hexaploid wheat.
Furthermore, based on F3H expression analysis it was
observed for the first time that activity-selectivity principle
[32] acts at the transcriptional level.
Our general conclusion is that regulatory genes probably
contribute more to the functional divergence between the
wheat genomes than do the structural genes themselves.
This is in line with the growing consensus which suggests

Plant materials and RNA extraction
The bread wheat cultivars 'Chinese Spring', 'Opata', 'Flair',
'Prinz', 'Golubka', 'Novosibirskaya 67', the synthetic hexaploid wheat 'W7984', tetraploid T. timopheevii k-38555
(AAGG) and the diploids T. urartu TMU06 (AA), Aegilops
speltoides TS01 (SS) and Ae. tauschii TQ17 (DD) were used
for PCR-based cloning. The complete set of 'Chinese
Spring' nulli-tetrasomic lines [34], a subset of homoeologous group 2 chromosome deletion lines [35], introgression line 842 derived from the cross T. aestivum cv.
'Saratovskaya 29' × T. timopheevii [22] were exploited to
establish chromosome bin locations. Eight progeny from
the cross 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7B) × 'TRI 2732' [8] and
a set of six homozygous lines each containing a different
chromosome 7D segment derived from Ae. tauschii in a
'Chinese Spring' background [23] were used for RT-PCR.
Quantitative examination of F3H expression was measured in 'Chinese Spring' and 'Mironovskaya 808' and the
single chromosome substitution lines 'Chinese Spring'
('Hope' 7A) and 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7B). DNA was
extracted from seven day old seedlings following the procedure described earlier [36]. RNA was extracted from
seedlings grown at 20°C under a 12 h day/12 h night
regime using the QIAGEN http://www1.qiagen.com/
Plant Rneasy Kit, followed by DNAse treatment. For RTPCR, RNA was extracted on the fourth day after germination. For quantitative RT-PCR, RNA was extracted every 24
h from two to six day old seedlings.

OLIGO software (Table 6) [38], with one primer pair as
described earlier [11]. PCR reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 50 ng template, 67 mM Tris HCl pH8.8, 1.8 mM
MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 18 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 mM
dNTP, 0.25 mM each primer and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR amplifications began with a 94°C/5 min incubation, followed by 45 cycles of 94°C/1 min, 60°C/2 min,
72°C/2 min, and a final extension of 72°C/10 min. PCR
fragments were recovered from 1% agarose gels, purified
using a QIAGEN MinElute Gel Extraction Kit, and cloned
with a QIAGEN PCR Cloning Kit. Between five and ten
clones per each primer combination per diploid genome
were sequenced in both directions to eliminate PCR and

sequencing errors or PCR-generated chimeras. Sequencing
was effected using an ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing ready reaction kit ("Perkin Elmer") with pUC/
M13 forward and reverse primers. Full-(or partial) length
sequences of various F3H gene copies were constructed
from overlapping sequences. Cluster analysis was performed on MEGA v3.1 software [39] using the UPGMA
(unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average)
algorithm and 500 bootstrap trials.
Chromosomal assignment and physical mapping of F3H
Specific primer pairs were designed to amplify each wheat
F3H copy (Table 6). To obtain a unique amplification
product, the 3' end of at least one of the two primers
matched the copy-specific sequence. A touchdown PCR
protocol was used to amplify from templates of the 'Chinese Spring' nulli-tetrasomic and deletion lines and the T.
aestivum × T. timopheevii introgression line 842 in 20 μl

reactions by applying a denaturing step of 94°C/2 min, 13
cycles of 94°C/15 s, 65°C/30 s (decreasing by 0.7°C/
cycle), 72°C/45 s, 24 cycles of 94°C/15 s, 56/30 s, 72°C/
45 s; and a final extension of 72°C/5 min. The specificity
of the amplifications was confirmed by cloning and
sequencing of the PCR product from 'Chinese Spring'. The
microsatellite analysis of the 'Chinese Spring' deletion
lines was performed using procedures described earlier
[40]. The microsatellite genotypic data of the T. aestivum ×
T. timopheevii introgression line 842 have been published
[22].
RT-PCR and qRT-PCR
Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg total
RNA using a (dT)15 primer and the QIAGEN Omniscript
Reverse Transcription kit in a 20 μl reaction mixture. RTPCR was performed with F3H primers published earlier
[11] or with F3H gene copy-specific primers (Table 6). The

standardization of cDNA template was performed using
ubiquitin (UBC) primers [11]. PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. F3H gene copyspecific primers were also applied for qRT-PCR, which
used a QIAGEN QuantiTect SYBR Green kit. UBC and
GAPDH primers were used to standardize the cDNA template. The amplifications were performed in an Applied
Biosystems 7900 HT fast real time PCR system. Pre-determined amounts of cloned cDNA were used to generate
standard curves. Each sample was run in three replicates.
The specificity of the qRT-PCR products was confirmed by
2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Statistical significance of
differences in F3H expression level either between F3H
homoeologues or between different genotypes was
assessed by Student's t-test for matched pairs. When F3H
homoeologues were compared, T-values were calculated
for each pair (F3H-A1 vs F3H-B1, etc.) in each genotype

(Table 3), and 'matched pairs' were represented by expression level values obtained for respective pair of F3H
homoeologues at the same day in the same genotype.
When comparison was made between genotypes, T-values
were calculated for each pair of genotypes ('Chinese
Spring' ('Hope' 7A) vs 'Chinese Spring' ('Hope' 7B), etc.;
Table 4), and 'matched pairs' were represented by expression level values obtained in respective pair of genotypes
at the same day for the same F3H gene copy.
