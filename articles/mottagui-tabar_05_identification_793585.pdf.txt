Abstract
Background: Over 4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are currently reported to
exist within the human genome. Only a small fraction of these SNPs alter gene function or
expression, and therefore might be associated with a cell phenotype. These functional SNPs are
consequently important in understanding human health. Information related to functional SNPs in
candidate disease genes is critical for cost effective genetic association studies, which attempt to
understand the genetics of complex diseases like diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc. Robust methods for
the identification of functional SNPs are therefore crucial. We report one such experimental
approach.
Results: Sequence conserved between mouse and human genomes, within 5 kilobases of the 5prime end of 176 GPCR genes, were screened for SNPs. Sequences flanking these SNPs were
scored for transcription factor binding sites. Allelic pairs resulting in a significant score difference
were predicted to influence the binding of transcription factors (TFs). Ten such SNPs were selected
for mobility shift assays (EMSA), resulting in 7 of them exhibiting a reproducible shift. The full-length
promoter regions with 4 of the 7 SNPs were cloned in a Luciferase based plasmid reporter system.
Two out of the 4 SNPs exhibited differential promoter activity in several human cell lines.
Conclusions: We propose a method for effective selection of functional, regulatory SNPs that are
located in evolutionary conserved 5-prime flanking regions (5'-FR) regions of human genes and
influence the activity of the transcriptional regulatory region. Some SNPs behave differently in
different cell types.

Background
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most
common form of genomic variations occurring on average

every 1000 nucleotides. The vast majority of SNPs are neutral allelic variants, however the few that do influence a
phenotype in a measurable way, are important for

understanding the underlying genetics of human health.
SNPs are the focus of a large number of human genetics
studies attempting to understand their impact on complex
diseases like Alzheimers, Parkinsons, diabetes, etc. Most
SNPs, by the virtue of their location within genes (introns,
3'-UTRs, etc) or between genes, are considered most likely
to be benign and not to contribute to a phenotype,
whether it may be the manifestation of a disease or
quicker metabolism of a drug. Among the group of SNPs
located within coding regions of genes and causing a
change in the peptide sequence (non-synonymous SNPs
or 'nsSNPs') or among SNPs located within promoters
(regulatory SNPs or rSNPs), a majority may not influence
the overall activity of the protein or the gene expression.
With the per-SNP validation and genotyping cost relatively high, it is increasingly important to develop strategies to predict functionally relevant SNPs in silico. The SNP
databases in public domain, like NCBI/dbSNP and HGVbase, have facilitated this by highlighting all nsSNPs and
also further classifying the location of the amino acid
within the encoded proteins [1] to more accurately predict
the detrimental effects of a change in peptide sequence.
Several recent studies have attempted to focus on the subset of nsSNPs that most likely influence phenotype [2-6].
Of the approximately 4.5 Million SNPs in dbSNP [7], an
estimated 10,000 nsSNP exist and approximately 10–15%
of those are projected to be damaging [6]. Comparatively
fewer attempts have been made to predict and validate
functional promoter SNPs [8].
Transcriptional regulatory regions in the 5'-FR of human
genes encode short (often < 25 bp) [9,10] sequences
which serve as targets for binding of transcription factors
(TFs). Understanding the conditions of binding, specificity and identity of the factors would help us understand
the mechanism of regulation of human genes. Eukaryotic
TFs tolerate considerable sequence variation in their target
sites and recent bioinformatics works [11-13] have developed methods to model the DNA binding specificity of
individual TFs [10]. Such matrices, although highly accurate [9,14], are less specific in the identification of sites
with in vivo function [11], mainly due to our limited
understanding of additional factors involved in TF specificity such as factor cooperative binding, protein-protein
interactions, chromatin superstructures and TF concentrations. Currently the most successful approach to overcome this information gap is based on the assumption
that sequences conserved between species (here human
and mouse) would most likely mediate biological function [15-19].
The 7TM (7 trans-membrane domain proteins), also
known as the hetero-trimeric GTP-binding protein (G
protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are members of a
large family with an estimated 700 genes in the human

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/18

genome [20]. By some estimates, nearly 60% of drugs
marketed today target directly or indirectly the GPCR family members [21]. Several studies have collectively analyzed the occurrence, and importance, of coding SNPs to
pharmaceutical efforts, in this family of genes [22-24].
Characterizing polymorphisms that are located in the 5'FR of these genes and that influence expression has been
reported earlier. We therefore selected a subset of clinically and pharmacologically important GPCR genes and
their 5'-FR sequences to test our bioinformatics and laboratory experimentation approach for prediction of functionally important SNPs in regulatory regions. Our
selection system evaluates the influence of SNPs on TFDNA complex stability, and further investigates the influence of such SNPs on promoter activity. We present a
proof-of-concept for such a strategy and identify issues
and problem-areas for future developments.

Results
The lists of the full names and Ensembl ENSG numbers
[25] of the 176 GPCR genes are shown in additional files
[See Additional file 1]. From a total of approximately 800
SNPs in proximal 5 kb regions, less than 200 were
mapped to regions of mouse-human genome conservation. Of these approximately 200 SNPs, 36 were predicted
to influence TF binding, in regions of sequence conservation of over 70% in human-mouse; the alignments for
two such regions are indicated in additional files [See
Additional file 2]. Table 1 lists the 21 genes, along with
the SNPs, TFs and TFBS sequences and positions relative
to transcription start site. These 36 candidate SNPs in
Table 1 were qualified by our selection criteria, as
described in the methods section, and were predicted to
influence the binding of TFs in a qualitative manner. The
absolute binding score of the TF differed by at least 2 units
between the two alleles. Ten SNPs within the 5'-FR of 7
genes were selected for EMSA tests and are shown in bold
letters in Table 1. The choice of these genes was based on
our understanding of their significance in human physiology and relevance to research interests within the GPCR
research community. Table 2 shows the results from the
EMSA experiments, where values in each column for
Allele 1 and Allele 2 are the ratios of measurements from
each of the 5 different concentrations of the competitor
oligomers (labeled × 5 through × 25 in Table 2 and in Figure 1) divided by the measurements without competitor
(labeled 'C' in Figure 1). The decrease in level of the
labeled product as a consequence of increasing nonlabeled oligomer concentration is an indication of the
efficiency of displacement, thereby reflecting the relative
stability of the DNA-protein complex. A marginal increase
in level of radio-labeled complex, instead of a decrease
(Table 2 rs1800508) is generally considered to be due to
additional factor involvements. Table 2, column 'Ratio'
shows the difference, calculated for the highest

concentration of the non-labeled competitor (25-fold),
between the efficiency of competition between a perfectmatch competitor and the allelic mismatch competitor.
Values close to 1.00 indicate no difference in rate of competition between the two alleles, and therefore no relative
difference in stability of the DNA-protein complex. While
4 SNPs exhibit mobility shift with a difference of 2-fold or
more (rs267412, rs509813, rs945032 and rs2528521),
three SNPs exhibit a moderate, nevertheless reproducible
shift (rs1799722, rs2882225 and rs1538251). Finally,
three SNPs fail to show any significant shift (rs968554,
rs267413 and rs1800508). In all, seven out of ten polymorphic markers indicated reproducible binding differences between the alleles. Figure 1 shows pictures of
EMSA gels for two of the SNPs, rs1799722 and
rs2528521.

Polyacrylamide gels from electromobility shift
assays. Polyacrylamide gels showing the decrease in
amounts of protein complex with labelled oligomer as the
concentration of the competing non-labelled oligomer
increases (lanes marked x5 through x25). Lane marked ’C’
has no competitor and represents the basal levels of labelled
complex. The measure of displacement of the labelled oligomer is expressed as a ratio of radio-labelled product, for
each lane, divided by the basal value, presented in Table 2.
Comparison of allele specific DNA-protein complex stability
is a ratio of the highest competitor concentration (x25) of
each of the two alleles. Thus for rs1799722 (A) allele A binds
proteins 1.66 times better than allele G and for rs2528521
(B) allele A binds proteins 2.62 times better than allele G
(Table 2, extreme right column).

For EMSA-positive markers with no validation information at dbSNP, HGVbase or Celera Discovery Systems™ we
did a validation analysis using RFLP (restriction fragment
length polymorphism) on DNA samples from 25 healthy
Nordic individuals. The three SNPs which failed to show
positive gel-shift results (serotonin receptor 5HT-1A:
rs968554; DRD1: rs267413; and BK-2: rs1800508) were
not investigated any further. For dopamine receptor D1
(DRD1) polymorphism (rs267412) the genotype distribution was found to be TT = 30%, AA = 20% and AT =
50%, and for calcitonin receptor promoter (CT-R) polymorphism rs2528521, it was GG = 40%, AA = 30% and
GA = 30%. While rs267412 was found to be in Hardy
Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), rs2528521 was not. A
larger population sample should be genotyped to accurately measure HWE for both these loci. Bradykinin B2
(BK-2) promoter polymorphism rs1799722 is noted to be
polymorphic (major allele C: 56%) at NCBI/dbSNP. The
polymorphic nature of this locus (rs1799722) was also
confirmed by crosschecking at Celera Discovery Systems™.
Also for the second BK-2 SNP rs945032, the allele frequency information was found at dbSNP (major allele =
80%). NCBI's dbSNP provided no allele frequency information about rs1538251 adenosine-A3 receptor
(ADORA3), and on sequencing 20 DNA samples this
marker proved to not be polymorphic in Nordic sample
population, and was eliminated from further analysis
(data not shown). The genotype frequency of muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1) SNP rs509813 was
documented at Celera Discovery Systems™. The contigposition of rs2882225 (follicle simulating hormone
receptor; FSHR) was not in agreement between the three
major public genome databases, i.e. NCBI, Ensembl and
Santa Cruz Genome Assembly (UCSC). It was mapped
within the transcript for FSHR by NCBI/dbSNP, and completely absent from Ensembl and UCSC [26]. Therefore of
the seven SNPs exhibiting positive EMSA, five SNPs (in

four genes) qualified for analysis of their influence on
promoter activity.
For expression analysis in living cells, the published promoter regions, or putative regulatory 5'FR of up to 2 Kb,
were cloned and basal levels of luciferase were monitored.
Repeated attempts to clone the promoter region of DRD1
failed (data not shown). Furthermore the position of
rs267413 is mapped at -4446 nucleotides with respect to
the transcription start site, whereas the minimum length
of the genomic fragment known to drive DRD1 expression is limited to 2571 nucleotides. Considering the distal
position of the marker, we decided not to examine
rs267413 further in this study. The promoter regions of
BK-2, CHRM1 and CT-R were cloned successfully. A total
of four dissimilar human cell lines (HeLa, Hep2G and SKN-MC, HEK293) were used to monitor the influence of
the four SNPs (rs945032, rs1799722, rs2528521 and
rs509813) to investigate differences in expression that are
possibly due to differences in TF expression in different
cell types. BK-2 promoter SNPs rs945032 (genotype =
GG) and rs1799722 (genotype = AA) showed
approximately 40%-60% higher activity in HeLa cells as
compared to their other homozygote alleles AA and GG,
respectively (Figure 2). The BK-2 SNP rs945032 behaves
in a reciprocal manner in two (HeLa, and HEK293) cell
types. The BK-2 SNP rs1799722 allele 'C' increases expression only in HeLa while decreasing expression in the other
three cell types, similar to CHRM1 marker rs509813. CTR marker rs2528521 and CHRM1 marker rs509813 failed
to show any influence on luciferase expression levels in
HeLa and SK-N-MC cells. Finally, the CT-R SNP
rs2528521, allele 'C', influences expression in a significant
manner, but only in one cell line (Hep2G). Hence, different alleles behave differently in different cell
environments.

Discussion
SNPs that are located within coding regions and result in
a change in the peptide sequence may be classified as
'damaging' or 'altering' if predicted to be in structurally or
functionally important sites of the three dimensional
structure of the protein. It is less straightforward to predict
the functional importance of SNPs within regulatory
regions. TFs tolerate variation in their binding sites and all
positions in a site do not contribute equally to the binding
energy. Therefore, the quantitative effect a given rSNP has
on gene expression depends on its position and the bases
involved. Complex human diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes and obesity are polygenic diseases, where many predisposing genetic and environmental factors together,
over a period of time, cause a disease state. Differences in
expression of genes and cellular concentrations of proteins due to common polymorphisms in 5' regulatory
regions could equally elucidate gene function as the examination of non-synonymous SNPs in coding regions. We
decided to test the 5'-FR of a group of physiologically and
clinically important genes, for SNPs within TFBS, which
could potentially influence the kinetics of binding
affinity.
A common strategy for modeling the binding preferences
of a transcriptions factor is to construct a position weight
matrix (PWM) from known binding sites. PWMs are probabilistic models that capture the nucleotide preference at
each position of a TFBS as well as the differential contribution of positions to the overall binding energy. When a
putative binding site sequence is assessed using a PWM, a
score is obtained that theoretically should be proportional to the binding energy between the TF and that
sequence [10]. It has been convincingly shown, and generally accepted, that by considering DNA sequence conservation between mouse and human, the over-predictive

Table 2: Oligonucleotide sequences used for EMSA. For every SNP, 4 oligonucleotides (2 complimentary pairs) were synthesized, one
pair for each allele. One oligonucleotide sequence from each pair had additional GG dinucleotide overhangs at the 5'end for fill-in
labeling reaction. Care was taken to make sure that the additional GG-dinucleotide did not influence the predicted TF binding
capability. The complementary sequences lacked the GG pairs. Only the allelic sequence predicted to bind most stably was chosen for
the fill-in labeling reaction (marked *) while the gel shift assays were carried out using competitor with a perfect match versus a
competitor with the allelic mismatch. The polymorphic site is underlined. Column 'Ratio' shows the difference in competition
between the labeled and non-labeled oligomers at 25-fold excess, by dividing Allele2 (x25) values by Allele1 (x25).

nature of TFBS modeling can be significantly remedied.
Therefore we chose for this work, not to include 'negative
controls', that is, SNPs from outside of mouse-human
conserved regions. We do indeed think that larger studies
in the future should perhaps incorporate certain number
of such negative controls to validate the theoretical predictions. Thus, using PWMs it should be possible to overcome the difficulties with rSNP detection stated above.

We reasoned that if the score difference between alleles is
large, it should correspond to a difference in gene expression that is reproducible in living cells. Using the JASPAR
database of PWMs [27] and a phylogenetic footprinting
strategy previously shown to be successful [17], we developed a method to detect putative TFBS and identify rSNPs
likely to affect TF binding significantly. By incorporating
phylogenetic footprinting, the method reported in this

far. Of the four SNPs tested in a promoter-less expression
vector, two (rs945032 and rs1799722) indicated
significant influence on promoter activity, while two
showed convincing and reproducible, yet comparatively
limited influence (rs2528521 and rs509813) on promoter
activity. The influence of these polymorphisms (rs945032
and rs1799722) indicate that any given functional variation within a regulatory region might exert a measurable
influence within the context of a cell type determined by
the TF expression profile of the cells and perhaps competitive binding of the TF to overlapping multiple binding
sites.

study emphasizes SNPs present in genomic regions that
are highly conserved between human and mouse, thereby
increasing the probability of a downstream functional
influence of variations within theses sequences.
Electromobility Shift Assays (EMSA) produce DNA-protein binding interactions in artificial conditions. Therefore in silico prediction methods based on other in vitro or
in vivo selection technologies, like 'systematic evolution of
ligands by exponential enrichment' (SELEX), may not
agree with the experimental outcome of EMSA procedures. Since the construction of PWMs is often concluded
from published records based on SELEX enrichment
approaches, it is informative to experimentally validate
the predicted binding site using methods like EMSA.
Therefore, we validated a subset of our predictions with in
vitro electro-mobility shift. We used a stringent selection
criterion, that is, qualified only alleles demonstrating an
absolute binding score difference of 2.0 or more. A stringent selection criterion would no doubt decrease excessive
hits and false positives at the expense of certain loss of true
positives. Our results showed that approximately 60%70% (i.e. 7 out of the selected 10 SNPs) of predicted sites
(Table 2) bind proteins from HeLa nuclear extracts.
We finally attempted to correlate the EMSA findings from
the 10 SNPs with influences on actual promoter activity
within living cells. Due to mapping discrepancies of one
SNP and failure to clone one promoter, we tested only
four out of the seven EMSA-positive SNPs identified thus

There are several factors in the current approach which
indicate that there are far more rSNPs than currently
detected using available technologies. The EMSA assays
employ HeLa nuclear extract, thereby limiting our findings to the TF expression repertoire of only HeLa nuclei.
The TFBS package used a limited collection of high quality
PWMs, which unfortunately represent only a small part of
the approximately 2,000 known human and mouse TFs.
The theoretical thresholds set for selections of alleles
which are predicted to differentially bind TF require further rigorous testing to ensure that the present selection is
optimal.

Conclusions
From a total of approximately 200 SNPs in evolutionally
conserved 5'-FR of 176 human GPCR genes, our prediction algorithm selected 36 SNPs with possible influence
on TFBS. When ten of these 36 SNPs were tested for
mobility shifts, seven exhibited a positive result, and four
of these were further tested for influence on promoter
activity using an in situ reporter system. Finally, two of the
four showed significant and reproducible influences
which were dependent on the cell environment. Thus
starting from a large pool of potential regulatory SNPs, we
successfully identified a small fraction that actually influenced promoter activity. We therefore propose a method
for effective selection of functional, regulatory SNPs, in
evolutionary conserved 5'-FR regions of human genes, as
a means for identification of candidate SNPs for genetic
association analysis studies.

Methods
Sequence alignment and TFBS detection
The GPCR genes were selected from Ensembl [25].
Human and mouse genome assemblies (versions hg12
and mm2, respectively) and mappings of GenBank and
RefSeq cDNA sequences to the assemblies were retrieved
from the UCSC Genome Browser Database [26]. In addition, cDNA sequences for the 176 7TM or GPCR genes
(online supplement) were mapped to the human genome
assembly and 50,821 mouse cDNA sequences from the
RIKEN project [29] were mapped to the mouse genome

assembly using the client/server version of BLAT [30] with
default settings. For each of the 176 GPCR-encoding
human cDNAs, we retrieved the genomic mapping with
the highest number of matching bases. Orthologous
mouse loci were identified by similarly retrieving mouse
genomic mappings for mouse cDNAs defined as
orthologs to the human cDNAs in GeneLynx [31]. To
more reliably identify transcriptional start sites we
searched for other cDNA mappings overlapping the
retrieved mappings and indicating similar gene structures.
For each gene, the cDNA mapping extending furthest 5'
was then used for further analysis. We extracted human
genomic sequences from -5000 to +100 relative to starts
of human cDNA mappings and mouse genomic
sequences from -30000 to +100 relative to starts of mouse
cDNA mappings. Orthologous genomic sequences were
aligned using BLASTZ [32] with default settings. Aligned
regions preceding human cDNA mappings were searched
for putative rSNPs as follows. SNP data for the human
genomic regions was retrieved from dbSNP, build 114.
For each SNP within an aligned region, two allelic versions of a 110-bp alignment slice centered around the
SNP were searched for putative TFBS using the TFBS Perl
modules [33] and all position-weight matrices in the JASPAR database describing vertebrate TFBS and having an
information content of at least 7 [27]. Hits fulfilling the
following 3 criteria were considered putative TFBS: (a) situated within regions of at least 70% sequence identity
(conservation) over 50 base pairs; (b) situated at corresponding (aligned) positions in human and mouse
sequences; (c) having a relative matrix score of at least 0.5
in both human and mouse sequences. Selected for further
analysis were putative TFBS with a relative matrix score
exceeding 0.8 in one of the human alleles and either
undetected in the other allele or having a difference in
absolute matrix score of at least 2 between the human
alleles.
Electromobility Shift Assays (EMSA)
Table 2 lists the sequences of oligonucleotides used for
EMSA tests. For setting up of EMSA experimental procedures, an earlier published positive shift assay was reproduced using a polymorphism in the gene MMP12 [34].
Method modifications were then applied as described
below.

Double stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized with
5'-GG dinucleotide overhangs. The 3'-end of the complementary strand was labeled with [α32P] dCTP with fill-in
reaction using Klenow flagment. The labeled oligonucleotide were passed through ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Columns (Pfizer-Pharmacia Inc) and the concentration was
adjusted to 0.035 nM. A 0.8 µl volume portion was mixed
with 1.6 µl HeLa Nuclear Extract (Promega™), 1.6 µl 5x
Gel Shift Binding 5x Buffer (Promega™), and 3.2 µl water.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/18

After 10 min incubation at room temperature, 0.8 µl of
non-labeled competitor DNA, either one allele or the
other allele, was added in varying concentrations (5-, 10-,
15-, 20- and 25-folds greater than the radio-labeled oligonucleotide). After 20 min room temperature incubation,
the entire 8 µl reaction was loaded on polyaclylamide gel
(5% 22.5 mM Tris/22.5 mM boric acid/0.5 mM EDTA
buffer in, BIO RAD™). Thereafter, electrophoresis was performed in TBE for 20 min at 200 V. Gels were placed on
Whatmann 3 MM™ filters and to facilitate drying a BIO
RAD™ gel-dryer was used for 30 minutes. The dried gel
were exposed to intensifying screen and analyzed by
Typhoon Image Analyzer 9400 (Pfizer-Pharmacia Inc™).
Sequencing and RFLP (Restriction fragment length
polymorphism)
The frequency of Dopamine receptor D1 polymorphism
rs267413 was determined by sequencing a 174 base-pair
fragment of the promoter in 10 DNA samples from
healthy Swedish individuals. The sequence of the forward
primer used for PCR was 5'-GGGGTACCACTTGACCGTTCTGTTGCTTT-3' where a KpnI restriction site (GGTACC)
and GG-dinucleotide was added to the 5' end. The
sequence of the reverse primer was 5'-TCTTTTAAGCTCTACTGTGGGTGA-3'. Calcitonin receptor promoter polymorphism rs2528521 was analyzed by RFLP (fragment
length was 334 bp, restriction enzyme Tsp45I). Forward
primer sequence used for PCR was 5'-ACCCCCAAGGTGTCTCTTCT-3' and reverse primer: 5'- GAGGGACCCGAGTTAGACCT-3'. The primer sequences for
Bradykinin promoter SNP rs1799722 were as follows:
Forward primer 5'-CCAGGAGGCTGATGACGTCA-3'. The
fourth base from 3'-end was changed from A to G from
original genomic sequence to create a Tsp45I restriction
site for RFLP analysis.

Reverse primer: 5'-TCAGTCGCTCCCTGGTACTG-3'. Fragment length amplified was 150 bp. PCR conditions for all
RFLP and sequencing reactions were as follows: 94 C (4
min), followed by 42 cycles of 94 C (1 min), 61 C (30 sec)
and 72 C (30 sec).
Luciferase expression system for promoter activity analysis
A promoter-less luciferase vector (Basic PGL3, Promega™)
was used for cloning known promoter regions between
restriction sites KpnI and BglII of the plasmid vector. Primers for CHRM1: Forward: 5'-GGGGTACCGCAGGACCCACATCTCTAGG-3'
Reverse
=
5'GAAGATCTTCACCAGGGCACCCAAT-3'. Primers for BK2: Forward = 5'-GGGGTACCATCTGAGACTCTGTTTCCC3' reverse = 5'-GAAGATCTTTCAGTCGCTCCCTGGTACT3'. Primers for CT-R: Forward = 5'-GGGGTACCCCTTGGAATCAACTTGCCT-3' reverse = 5'-TTCTCGAGCGTCCTTGGAATCAACTTGC-3'. Genomic DNA of 27
individuals of Nordic origin were amplified and

sequenced to identify the genotype of sample DNA.
Cloned DNA were sequenced by using primer set
GLprimer2 : 5'-CTAGCAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3' and 5'CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCC-3'. HeLa cells were plated
in 24 well plates one day before transfection in appropriate medium with serum without antibiotics. Basic PGL3
Plasmids containing the cloned promoter region (180 ng)
were co-transfected with 20 ng of pRL-TK plasmid, using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen™). Luciferase activities
were determined using a dual Luciferase Reporter Assay
system (Promega™) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
