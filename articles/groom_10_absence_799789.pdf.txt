Abstract
Background: Detection of a retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV), has recently been
reported in 67% of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. We have studied a total of 170 samples from chronic
fatigue syndrome patients from two UK cohorts and 395 controls for evidence of XMRV infection by looking either
for the presence of viral nucleic acids using quantitative PCR (limit of detection <16 viral copies) or for the
presence of serological responses using a virus neutralisation assay.
Results: We have not identified XMRV DNA in any samples by PCR (0/299). Some serum samples showed XMRV
neutralising activity (26/565) but only one of these positive sera came from a CFS patient. Most of the positive sera
were also able to neutralise MLV particles pseudotyped with envelope proteins from other viruses, including
vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating significant cross-reactivity in serological responses. Four positive samples were
specific for XMRV.
Conclusions: No association between XMRV infection and CFS was observed in the samples tested, either by PCR
or serological methodologies. The non-specific neutralisation observed in multiple serum samples suggests that it
is unlikely that these responses were elicited by XMRV and highlights the danger of over-estimating XMRV
frequency based on serological assays. In spite of this, we believe that the detection of neutralising activity that did
not inhibit VSV-G pseudotyped MLV in at least four human serum samples indicates that XMRV infection may
occur in the general population, although with currently uncertain outcomes.

Background
In 2006, pursuing a link between prostate cancer and an
inherited mutation in the RNASEL gene, Urisman and
colleagues identified a novel gammaretrovirus [1]. Using
PCR methodology, this virus was shown to be present in
9/86 (10%) prostate tumours examined. It showed close
sequence similarity to xenotropic murine endogenous
retrovirus elements and was thus named xenotropic
murine leukaemia virus related virus (XMRV). A subsequent study demonstrated receptor usage typical of
murine xenotropic virus [2]. Phylogenetic analyses place
XMRV firmly within the murine endogenous retroviruses [3] even though no identical element has so far

been identified within the mouse genome [4]. More
recently, additional groups of samples from patients
with prostate cancer have been examined for the presence of XMRV with both positive [5] and negative [6,7]
results.
Very recently, a paper reporting the PCR detection of
XMRV in PBMC from 68/101 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been published [8]. Replicating
virus could be isolated from stimulated PBMC with
sequences almost, but not quite identical to the viruses
isolated from prostate cancer patients. Providing apparently compelling evidence against the possibility of
laboratory contamination, a number of the patients were
shown to have mounted an immune response against
XMRV. Interestingly, around 4% of control patients
appeared to harbour the virus [8].

Replication of these results and the possible identification of roles for XMRV in the aetiology of prostate cancer and/or CFS would be of great medical significance.
Detection of XMRV might provide potentially useful
diagnostic tools and might also suggest therapeutic avenues for treatment. Further, widespread distribution of a
potentially pathogenic virus would have important
implications concerning its role as a co-factor in other
conditions and in the safety of the blood supply. We
therefore set out to investigate the distribution of
XMRV in UK CFS patients, using PCR to search for the
presence of XMRV DNA and neutralisation assays to
detect an anti-XMRV immune response. In this study
we did not find any association between XMRV infection and CFS.

Methods
Sample collection

Samples from the following three centres were tested; St
George’s University of London (SGUL), Barts and the
London Hospital Trust (BLT) and Glasgow Caledonian
University (GC).
The SGUL cohort comprised 142 adult CFS patients
and 157 healthy blood donors. Both groups were aged
between 18 and 65, and the male to female ratios were
45:97 (CFS) and 43:114 (blood donors). At the time of
sampling, 2003-2008, blood was collected into three
tubes (an EDTA blood tube for DNA preparation; a
Paxgene tube for RNA preparation and a plain tube for
serum preparation from clotted blood). CFS patients
were recruited from clinics in Bristol, Dorset, London,
Birmingham, Norfolk and Epsom, and all patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria of Fukuda et al. [9]. Blood samples were taken between 1.5 and 4 years following
diagnosis. Healthy normal blood donors were enrolled
from the National Blood Service (NBS), in Dorset, UK.
All subjects provided informed consent, and these studies were approved by Wandsworth Research Ethics
Committee, St George’s Hospital, Cranmer Terrace,
London SW17 0RE.
The BLT cohort comprised 226 anonymised serum
samples taken in 2008-2009 (57 from the antenatal
clinic; 58 with haematological disorders; 55 liver patients
and 56 from the renal clinic). Clotted blood was separated by centrifugation, and the serum supernatant was
removed, stored at -20°C and defrosted once. Ethical
approval for the use of these samples for assay development was issued by UCLH NHS trust and adopted by
chairman’s action at BLT.
The GC cohort comprised 28 CFS patients (20 sera
and 8 plasma samples) and 12 controls (8 sera and 4
plasma samples) from the West of Scotland catchment
area. CFS patients were aged between 28 and 79, with a
male to female ratio of 16:12. Samples were collected

Page 2 of 10

between 1995 and 2003. Controls were aged between 23
and 63, with a male to female ratio of 7:5. Samples were
collected between 2002 and 2004. Some controls were
relatives of the patients, and some were hospital staff
volunteers. All patients met the Fukuda criteria (9).
Ethical permission for blood samples to be analysed for
the presence of viruses was granted by Southern General
Hospital NHS Trust Local Ethics Committee.
PCR

Genomic (g)DNA was prepared from PBMC from SGUL
patients and controls using the QIAamp DNA mini kit
(Qiagen) and amplified using the RepliG Ultrafast Mini
Kit (Qiagen), which provides highly uniform amplification
of all sequences, with negligible sequence bias. The concentrations after amplification ranged from 108 - 586 ng/
μl. Initially, 48 CFS patient gDNA samples were screened
by single-round PCR for gag and env genes, as well as
GAPDH, as outlined by Lombardi et al. [8] (Table 1). This
PCR was performed in a 50 μl reaction volume consisting
of 25 μl amplitaq gold PCR mastermix and a final DNA
concentration of 2-5 ng/μl. Cycling was modified as
appropriate to our mastermix; 95°C for 5 min, (95°C for
30 sec, 57°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 60 sec) for 45 cycles,
hold at 72°C for 7 min, store at 4°C. Products were visualized on 3% agarose gels by ethidium bromide staining. As
we did not amplify any products using this PCR, we developed two more sensitive real-time qPCR assays which targeted 2 regions of the env gene, beginning at nt 6173 and

6682, respectively (Table 1). These were used to screen
samples of gDNA (prepared from PBMC) or cDNA (prepared from total RNA extracted using the Paxgene system
from Preanalytix, UK) from CFS and normal blood
donors. In total, 136 CFS gDNA and 140 CFS cDNA samples and 95 control gDNA and 141 control cDNA samples
were analysed, such that all 142 CFS patients and 157
blood donors were screened for XMRV using these assays
in either genomic DNA, cDNA or both. GAPDH was also
amplified as a control using a commercial primer and
probe set (Hs_99999905_m1 from Applied Biosystems).
Real-time qPCR reactions were performed in 10 μl total
volume, consisting of 5 μl PCR mastermix, 0.5 μl (20×)
Taqman primers/probe mix, 4.5 μl sample (for gDNA, 1 μl
gDNA (100-590 ng) and 3.5 μl DEPC-treated water
(Ambion); for cDNA, 4.5 μl cDNA). Cycling times and
temperatures were as follows. Initial denaturation
occurred for 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 15 sec and combined primer
annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 min. Data were displayed using SDS 1.3.1 software (ABI).
Plasmids

VP62 XMRV clone was a gift of Robert Silverman [2].
HG1 is a replication-incompetent XMRV clone constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of VP62 (the packaging signal was removed by deleting nucleotides 293-388,
as numbered in GenBank EF185282; and nucleotides
7720-8108 were replaced by a BsrG1 site to remove the
U3 region). Moloney-MLV Gag-Pol was expressed from
KB4, a vector synthesized by cloning the gag-pol region
from pMD-MLV GagPol [10] into pcDNA3.1. Viral
genomic RNA was expressed from an MLV-based retroviral vector encoding b-galactosidase (LTR-LacZ [10]),
and envelope proteins were encoded by constructs for
either NZB xenotropic envelope, MLV(X) (a gift of Massimo Pizzato), Moloney-MLV env (MOSAF, a gift of
Yasu Takeuchi), Friend-MLV env [10], or the G-protein
from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) [11].
Virus production

Replication defective XMRV virus was prepared for neutralisation assays by co-transfecting 293T cells with
HG1 and LTR-LacZ. Pseudotyped MLV was prepared
by co-transfecting 293T cells with KB4, LTR-LacZ and
an envelope-encoding plasmid (either MLV(X), MOSAF,
Friend or VSV-G). After ~18 hours, cells were washed,
and fresh media was added for a further ~24 hours,
before viral supernatants were harvested, filtered, and
the viral titre was measured by ELISA for RT activity
(Cavidi tech). Viral stocks were titrated on D17 cells, an
established, easily infectable dog cell line, or NIH-3T3
cells for Friend- and Moloney- pseudotyped MLV. After
48 hours, the cells were assayed for b-galactosidase

activity using the Galacto-Star system (Applied Biosystems). The amount of virus to be used in the neutralisation assays was determined as the volume of
supernatant added to 3.5 × 103 cells that resulted in ~4
× 104 counts per second of chemiluminescence.
Neutralisation assays

Neutralisation assays were performed as reported in
[12]. Monoclonal antibodies to MLV Env proteins
(shown in Table 2) were gifts from Leonard Evans and
have been previously described [13,14]. They were provided and used as untreated hybridoma cell supernatants that were serially diluted two-fold before adding to
virus to assess neutralisation activity as for serum,
detailed below. Serum samples were heat inactivated at
56°C for 30 min. 5 μl serum were then added to 95 μl
media in a 96-well tissue culture plate, and samples
were serially diluted two-fold, leaving 50 μl at each dilution. 50 μl virus-containing supernatant were then
added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37°C
for 1 hour. Following incubation, 100 μl containing 3.5
× 103 D17 cells (or NIH-3T3 cells for Friend or Moloney-MLV neutralisation) were added to each well, and
the plate was incubated at 37°C. After 48 hours the cells
were lysed, and b-galactosidase activity was measured.
Infectivity corresponded to counts per second of
chemiluminescence.

Results
PCR screening

Lombardi et al. have recently detected XMRV DNA in
67% of CFS patients by PCR [8]. To confirm an association of XMRV with this disease, we performed PCR for
gag, env and GAPDH on 48 (of 142) CFS patient gDNA
samples from SGUL using the previously published

single-round PCR methodology (Table 1 and [8]. However, although all samples were positive for GAPDH, we
found no evidence of XMRV DNA in any of the samples
(data not shown). In case we were missing low levels of
viral DNA, we devised a more sensitive qPCR-based
approach. To test the sensitivity of this method, triplicate, serial 1:10 dilutions of VP62 plasmid encoding the
full length XMRV genome were added to PBMC DNA
from a healthy donor and tested by Taqman PCR with
either env 6173 or env 6682 primers (Table 1). All replicates calculated to contain 16 copies of XMRV routinely
yielded a product within 37 cycles whereas only one of
three replicates of the next dilution scored positive (Figure 1). We concluded that our assay was capable of reliably detecting as little as 16 copies of proviral DNA and
was therefore likely to be as sensitive, if not more so,
than the assays previously used [8]. We then tested the
entire SGUL panel of 142 CFS samples and 157 of the
control samples (either gDNA, cDNA or both) with
both env 6173 and env 6682 primers. Although positive
for GAPDH, all samples were negative for XMRV. To
exclude the possibility of specific sample-mediated PCR
inhibition, we spiked 3 normal control cDNAs, which
had previously tested negative for XMRV nucleic acid,

Page 4 of 10

with XMRV VP62 DNA, to a final concentration of 2.3
× 10 -6 ng/μl and repeated the qPCR using both env
6173 and env 6682 primer sets. We successfully amplified the VP62 in these reactions, proving that the PCR
should have amplified XMRV from the patient samples
if it was present.
Neutralisation assays

In light of the negative data obtained using PCR assays,
we set out to search for evidence of XMRV infection
using a second method. Viral infection can elicit a neutralising antibody response [12]. Demonstration of such
a neutralising activity can be taken as evidence for a
viral infection, perhaps in cell types that were not
sampled in blood. Defining neutralisation is difficult in
the absence of known positive and negative sera. However, a number of neutralising monoclonal antibodies
directed against the Env protein of murine retroviruses
have been described [13,14]. We therefore obtained several of these (gifts of Leonard Evans) and tested them
for neutralisation of XMRV and NZB xenotropic MLV
(X) as well as ecotropic Friend and Moloney MLV
(Table 2) by assaying for a reduction in virus infectivity
following incubation of virus-containing supernatant

Figure 1 Sensitivity of PCR screening for XMRV in PBMC DNA. VP62 plasmid was serially diluted 1:10 into PBMC DNA from a healthy donor
and tested by Taqman PCR with env 6173 primers and probe. The final amount of VP62 DNA in the reaction was A, 2.3 × 10-2 ng, B, 2.3 × 10-3
ng, C, 2.3 × 10-4 ng, D, 2.3 × 10-5 ng, E, 2.3 × 10-6 ng, F, 2.3 × 10-7 ng or G, 2.3 × 10-8 ng. The limit of sensitivity was 2.3 × 10-7 ng (shown by
trace F) which equates to 16 molecules of VP62 XMRV clone.

with the monoclonal antibody. As anticipated, some
monoclonal antibodies were able to neutralise XMRV
(83A25’ and 609) whilst others had no effect on XMRV
infectivity. Interestingly, we identified three monoclonal
antibodies that neutralised MLV(X) but not XMRV
(603, 610 and 613) and one that neutralised XMRV but
not MLV(X) (609). These reagents may therefore be
useful tools with which to distinguish XMRV from
other xenotropic MLVs in future investigations. From
these experiments we defined two negative (603 and
613) and one positive (83A25’) antibody controls for

further experiments. To validate the neutralisation assay
and examine the possible range of responses to “normal
serum”, we tested neutralisation using a panel of 226
serum samples from BLT. Previous investigations have
detected XMRV DNA in ~1-6% of control samples
[5,6,8]. Of our panel only a handful showed possible
neutralisation activity, giving curves similar to that
shown in Figure 2A, with reductions in viral infectivity
similar or greater than that seen with the positive control, monoclonal 83A25’. Over 90% of the samples
tested had less than a 2-fold effect on infectivity (Figure

reciprocal of serum dilution for two positive sera, top panel sample Q488 and bottom panel sample Q610.

3A). From these data, we have defined a positive as a
sample that reduces viral infectivity by at least 70% at a
dilution of 1/40 and gives a reduction of 50% at a 1/80
dilution. According to this definition, the BLT sample
set contains 3 neutralising sera, identifying 1.3% of samples as positive.
To confirm that the neutralisation activity demonstrated was specific for XMRV, we tested a subset of sera
for neutralisation of XMRV alongside MLV particles
pseudotyped with different envelope proteins from MLV
(X), Friend-MLV or VSV. As shown in Figure 2B, of
these four virus preparations, only XMRV infectivity was
inhibited by any of the sera tested. Even the infectivity of
particles expressing the closely related MLV(X) envelope
that is 94% identical to XMRV was unaffected by sera
that inhibited XMRV (Figure 2B, squares). Thus, it seems
that the neutralising activity is specific for XMRV.
We therefore felt this assay was sensitive and specific
enough to examine the neutralising ability of the SGUL
cohort of blinded patient serum samples. After unblinding the samples, it emerged that of the 142 CFS patient
sera tested none was positive as defined by the criteria
above (Figure 3B). These results suggested that there
was no link between XMRV and CFS. By contrast, the
control group of 157 blood donors contained 22

positives, a frequency of 14%, considerably higher than
that seen in the BLT group (Figure 3C). It was also
noticeable that the neutralising activity of all but one of
the SGUL positive samples was much stronger than the
BLT positive samples (compare Figure 2A with Figure
4A). In fact, most of the SGUL positive sera reduced
XMRV infectivity by 100 fold at both 1/40 and 1/80
dilutions. Intriguingly, many of these serum samples
were collected from a single blood donation session.
Some samples from this session, however, were negative.
Surprisingly, PCR analyses of DNA samples corresponding to the positive sera from the SGUL controls were
uniformly negative. We therefore investigated the specificity of this response by testing 21 of the positive sera
for neutralisation of MLV pseudotyped with the envelope proteins from MLV(X), Friend-MLV or VSV. In
every case, the serum was able to neutralise additional
viruses to XMRV, including particles pseudotyped with
the non-retroviral envelope from VSV (Figure 4B and
Table 3). This implied that the strong positive neutralising activity demonstrated by the SGUL blood donor
controls was not specific to XMRV, and in all likeliness
was not elicited by this virus.
To test whether the SGUL cohort of CFS patients was
unique, we also tested 40 samples (including some

plasma samples as well as sera) from a separate CFS
cohort in our neutralisation assay. This GC cohort
revealed a solitary positive out of 28 CFS samples
(3.6%), and no positives out of 12 control samples. The
positive CFS patient serum was also able to neutralise
MLV pseudotyped with either MLV(X) or Friend envelopes, although interestingly, it was not able to neutralise
VSV-G pseudotyped MLV (Table 3). Neutralisation data
from the different cohorts are summarized in Table 4.
Thus, in summary, we found no association of XMRV
with either CFS cohort.

Discussion
We set out with the intention of confirming the results of
Lombardi et al. [8] concerning the association of XMRV
with CFS. In total, we tested 142 CFS samples for both
the presence of XMRV DNA in PBMCs by PCR and for
the presence of neutralising antibodies against XMRV in
our viral neutralisation assay, and a further 28 CFS samples for neutralising antibodies only. However, in contrast to Lombardi et al., we found no evidence of XMRV
DNA in any patient samples tested, and only a single
neutralisation-positive patient serum. Our findings

therefore appear inconsistent with the previous report
that isolated XMRV from PBMCs of CFS patients. We
are confident that, although we are unable to replicate
the PCR detection of XMRV in PBMC DNA from CFS
patients, our PCR assay is more sensitive than the published single round PCR method and should have possessed the necessary sensitivity to detect XMRV if it was
indeed present (Figure 1). Furthermore, we were able to
detect neutralising activity in one patient and in several
control serum samples (Table 4 and Figure 3), implying
that our neutralisation assay also has the required sensitivity. The lack of neutralising activity in CFS samples
compared to controls could reflect an inability to mount
an immune response in these patients. However, in that
case, the virus would be expected to replicate to higher
levels in CFS patients making it easier to detect by PCR.
As we could not detect any evidence of XMRV infection
by our PCR assays, we think this is an unlikely

explanation. Thus, in our cohorts, we found no association of XMRV with CFS. This is in stark contrast to the
result of Lombardi et al. [8]. However, it is thought likely
that the term CFS defines multiple diseases [15-17], and
it remains formally possible that a fraction of these are
associated with XMRV. During the submission of this
manuscript another report was published by Erlwein et
al. that also failed to detect XMRV in CFS patients by
PCR [18]. The publication of these results has promoted
much discussion and controversy amongst CFS researchers and patients alike, and has highlighted the need for
additional investigations in this area. Following the findings reported here, it would seem a prudent next step for
subsequent studies to compare samples and protocols
between different laboratories around the world.
There have also been conflicting reports describing
the association of XMRV with prostate cancer. Two studies from the USA [1,5] have found an increased

prevalence of the virus in prostate cancer patients,
although they differed as to whether this was dependent
on the RNASEL genotype of the patient. Conversely,
two German studies failed to establish a link between
the virus and disease [6,7]. Nevertheless, XMRV has
been detected in the control groups in multiple investigations [5,6,8], with the incidence varying between 1
and 6%. In our serological studies we have also identified neutralising activity against XMRV in around 4% of
all the samples examined. Remarkably many (but not
all) of the seropositive samples were identified in a relatively small group of blood donors within the SGUL
cohort, possibly suggesting a local outbreak of infection.
There is no evidence that this group are related or that
they have a particularly high risk of acquiring a retroviral infection. Therefore, an outbreak of this kind
seems unlikely. Moreover, all but one of the positive
samples from the SGUL set we tested were also able to
neutralise MLV pseudotyped with the envelope protein
from VSV (Table 3). The one serum that failed to neutralise VSV-G pseudotyped MLV was, however, able to
neutralise MLV particles pseudotyped with other retroviral envelopes. We therefore consider these positives
from healthy blood donors to be non-specific cross
reacting responses. The remaining four positive samples
from the BLT and GC cohorts had much weaker neutralisation activities and did not neutralise VSV-G pseudotyped MLV, although, again, the positive serum from
GC did neutralise particles expressing other retroviral
envelopes (Table 3). Although we cannot rule out the
possibility that the activity of these samples against
XMRV is also non-specific, one possible explanation for
these serological findings remains that XMRV infection
has occurred in around one percent of the population.
This figure is consistent with the general prevalence in
control samples previously reported. Given the common
oncogenic properties of gammaretroviruses [19] and the
reported link between XMRV and prostate cancer [1,5],
such an observation might be of considerable significance, particularly for the blood transfusion services. It
should, however, be noted that we have so far been

unable to reliably detect bacterially expressed XMRV
Gag proteins by using these sera in immunoblotting
experiments. It is therefore conceivable that these neutralising activities were not elicited by XMRV. Further
investigations are required to determine the nature of
these antiviral activities.

Conclusions
In summary, we have studied 299 DNA samples and
565 serum samples for evidence of XMRV infection. We
have not identified XMRV DNA in any samples by PCR,
however, some serum samples were able to neutralise
XMRV infectivity in our assay. Only one of these positive sera came from a CFS patient, implying that there
is no association between XMRV infection and CFS.
Furthermore, most of the positive sera were also able to
neutralise MLV particles pseudotyped with other envelope proteins, indicating there may be cross reactivity
with other retroviruses and even other enveloped
viruses. It therefore seems unlikely that these responses
were elicited by XMRV. However, the detection of neutralising activity that did not neutralise VSV-G pseudotyped MLV in at least four human sera may indicate
that XMRV infection does occur at in the general population, although the outcome of such infections is currently uncertain.
