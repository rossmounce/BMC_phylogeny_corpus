Abstract
Background: Prokaryotic plasmids have a dual importance in the microbial world: first they have a great impact
on the metabolic functions of the host cell, providing additional traits that can be accumulated in the cell without
altering the gene content of the bacterial chromosome. Additionally and/or alternatively, from a genome
perspective, plasmids can provide a basis for genomic rearrangements via homologous recombination and so they
can facilitate the loss or acquisition of genes during these events, which eventually may lead to horizontal gene
transfer (HGT). Given their importance for conferring adaptive traits to the host organisms, the interest in plasmid
sequencing is growing and now many complete plasmid sequences are available online.
Results: By using the newly developed Blast2Network bioinformatic tool, a comparative analysis was performed on
the plasmid and chromosome sequence data available for bacteria belonging to the genus Acinetobacter, an
ubiquitous and clinically important group of g-proteobacteria. Data obtained showed that, although most of the
plasmids lack mobilization and transfer functions, they have probably a long history of rearrangements with other
plasmids and with chromosomes. Indeed, traces of transfers between different species can be disclosed.
Conclusions: We show that, by combining plasmid and chromosome similarity, identity based, network analysis,
an evolutionary scenario can be described even for highly mobile genetic elements that lack extensively shared
genes. In particular we found that transposases and selective pressure for mercury resistance seem to have played
a pivotal role in plasmid evolution in Acinetobacter genomes sequenced so far.

Background
Plasmids are among the most important players in the
evolution of prokaryotes and in their adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions [1-3]. They are actually involved in many accessory functions and
constitute, together with “not essential” chromosomal
regions, what is referred to as the “dispensable genome”
in the microbial pan-genome concept [4]. Typically, a
plasmid includes one or more essential genes encoding
replicative functions. In addition, it may harbor one or
more genes coding for a variable panoply of accessory
metabolic processes and functions that are, in general,
different from those encoded by chromosome(s) [2,5,6].
Actually, plasmid architecture is more flexible than the
chromosomal one, concerning both gene content and
gene organization, even within members of the same

bacterial genus. Plasmids genes are in fact under differential selection while moving through the prokaryotic
community [3], and consequently, they frequently gain
and lose genes, revealing a very dynamic organization
[2,7,8]. This flexibility is mostly due to the abundance of
transposable elements they harbor and that facilitate
intra- and intermolecular recombination by creating
homology regions. Moreover, plasmids can be both vertically and horizontally inherited in a prokaryotic community, giving rise to the possibility that the very same
plasmid molecule can be hosted in different genomic
contexts, boosting the rearrangement of their functions
and of gene organization [9-11].
Despite the key-role of plasmids in the prokaryotic
world, the evolutionary dynamics of plasmids have been
poorly explored, mainly because of the lack of extensive
similarities between them, except for genes involved in
replication and transfer functions [12,13], which hampers classical phylogenetic analyses based on gene

genealogy and synteny [14]. However, a computational
biology approach (Blast2Network) based on similarity
networks reconstruction and phylogenetic profiling has
been recently proposed and applied in a study-case to
depict the similarities among plasmids from Enterobacteriaceae [15]. The bioinformatic package Blast2Network
(hereafter designated B2N) provides an immediate visualization of the similarities, existing among aminoacidic
or nucleic sequences [15]. This, in turn, opens the possibility to trace the evolutionary dynamics and history of
entire plasmids and not only of single genes and/or
operons harbored by them. In this context, bacteria
belonging to the genus Acinetobacter may represent an
excellent study-case, because strains of this genus are
commonly found in soil, water and in association with
animals [16,17]. Besides, some of them are well-known
human pathogens, often responsible for opportunistic
infections in hospitalized patients [16,18,19]. A striking
recent manifestation of A. baumannii is the occurrence
in severely wounded soldiers coming back from Iraq
[20]. Currently, the genus Acinetobacter comprises 19
species with valid names and at least 13 putative species
[21]. More than 975 strains have been recorded in the
Taxonomy Browser of NCBI at July, 2 2009, but the
precise taxonomy of these strains is not always clear
since many have not been identified by unambiguous
genotypic identification methods [21,22]. Acinetobacter
strains are of special interest for the huge variety of
environments they can colonize and the diverse metabolic abilities they display, as inferred from the occurrence of, e.g., hydrocarbon degrading strains in oil spills,
human pathogens resistant to a plethora of antibiotics,
rhizospheric bacteria and strains inhabiting bioreactors
or insect guts [6,23-29]. Moreover, a special interest for
members of this genus also relies on the ability of some
strains, i.e. those belonging to the species A. baylyi, to
undergo natural transformation [9,30]. This attribute
has made the A. baylyi strain ADP1 (also named
BD413) an exceptional tool for genetic analysis and
engineering [31].
It has been reported that several Acinetobacter strains,
especially those sharing particular ecological niches that
require specific adaptations, like polluted environments
and bioreactors, harbor plasmid molecules of different
sizes undergoing frequent molecular rearrangements
[32-34]. Particularly interesting among Acinetobacter
plasmids is the pKLH2 family [35], a group of evolutionary related plasmids harboring mercury resistance genes
(mer) embedded in a single compact operon that, in
turn, has been suggested to represent an aberrant mercury resistance transposon (namely TndPKHLK2) that
has lost genes responsible for transposition [36].
Recently, some Acinetobacter genomes and plasmids
have been completely sequenced. On March 31, 2009,

Page 2 of 15

the sequences of 7 genomes and 29 plasmids were available (Table 1). The Acinetobacter “pan-plasmidome”,
that is the complete set of plasmids harbored by members of this genus (comprising plasmids isolated from
both pathogenic and environmental strains), is then particularly attractive to study its evolutionary dynamics
because of the eclectic lifestyle of their host strains and
the possible frequent genetic exchanges between its
members.
Therefore, in this work, a detailed comparative analysis of the completely sequenced Acinetobacter plasmids,
available in public databases, was performed with the
aim to i) reconstruct their evolutionary dynamics and ii)
investigate the evolutionary cross-talk between them
and the chromosomes of Acinetobacter strains.

Results
Plasmid networks

The first aim of the work was the identification and the
analysis of the possible evolutionary relationships existing among the 29 Acinetobacter plasmids. To this purpose, all the 493 retrieved sequences of Acinetobacter
plasmid-encoded proteins were used as input for the
B2N software (see Material and Methods), generating a
set of networks showing all the sequence identities existing among these proteins. In these networks nodes
represent proteins, whereas links indicate the existence
of sequence identity among them (Figure 1 and [Additional file 1]). The degree of sequence identity threshold
is a priori selected. In principle, the higher the threshold
used, the lower the number of links existing between
proteins encoded by different plasmids. In addition, it
can be assumed that the higher the degree of aminoacid
identity between two proteins, the more recent would
be the event (recombination/transposition/duplication/
vertical transmission) responsible for the presence of the
two orthologous/paralogous coding genes in different
plasmids. We selected a minimum of 50% identity
threshold since this degree of sequence identity is sufficiently high to guarantee that in most cases the interconnected proteins perform the same function (i.e., they
are encoded for by orthologous genes) [37,38]. The
three networks shown in Figure 1 (at 100%, 90%, and
50% identity thresholds) and the other three reported in
[Additional file 1]. (at 60%, 70%, and 80% identity
thresholds) were obtained by reiterating the analysis
using different identity thresholds.
Analysis of links

The analysis of the networks reported in Figure 1
revealed that:
a) as expected, the number of links and interconnected nodes decreased with the increase of identity
threshold (Table 2). At 50% of sequence identity, 213
out of the 493 plasmid-encoded proteins were linked

Sequences were downloaded from the NCBI web-site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genlist.cgi?taxid=2&type=1&name=Bacteria%20Complete%
20Chromosomes and from the FTP repository ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/plasmid/ (as on 31st March 2009 ). N.d. “not determined”, A.N. “accession
number”.
*These plasmids were retrieved in strains lacking a clear taxonomical affiliation [56,57]

together. The other 280 proteins remained isolated
because each of them did not share any link with the
others and these were excluded from further analysis
(see the Phylogenetic profiling section). The number of
linked proteins decreased to 133 at a 100% sequence
identity threshold. Still this number is unexpectedly
high and suggests that the plasmids sharing at least one
gene underwent recombination events very recently.
b) Three main groups can be recognized (Figure 1):
Cluster 1 includes the eight plasmids pKLH2, pKLH201,
pKLH202, pKLH203, pKLH204, pKLH205, pKLH207,
and pKLH208 (hereinafter designated as the pKLHfamily plasmids) that are highly interconnected although
they have been isolated from different Acinetobacter

spp. strains (Table 1). Cluster 2 is constituted by fifteen
plasmids isolated from 8 A. baumannii strains, and
Cluster 3 includes the remaining six plasmids isolated
from Acinetobacter species different from A. baumannii.
c) Four plasmids (pRAY, pAC450, pYA1, and
p4ABAYE) harbor genes encoding proteins that do not
share any link neither between them nor with other proteins in the network.
d) Concerning the connections within each group
(intra-links), the analysis of Figure 1 reveals that plasmids of cluster 1 (pKLH family) maintain a very high
number of links at the 100% threshold, whereas the
number of intra-links of plasmids belonging to clusters
2 and 3 strongly decreases from the 50% to the 100%

threshold. Overall, this finding suggests that pKLH plasmids share a more recent evolutionary pathway than
that exhibited by the other plasmids. In addition to this,
the finding that such pKLH plasmids have been isolated
from different strains belonging to the same or to different Acinetobacter species suggests a high degree of horizontal flow of these plasmids (or at least of the shared
genes). The biological significance of these data relies
mainly on the fact that these plasmids harbor the
genetic determinants for mercury resistance (mer genes,

Fondi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/59

see [Additional file 2]) that are positively favored in an
environment under a strong selective pressure, i.e. in
the presence of high mercury concentrations.
e) Regarding the connections between plasmids
belonging to different clusters (inter-links), no link was
observed between pKLH-family plasmids and those
belonging to the other two clusters at the 100% threshold. However, at the 90% and 50% thresholds, many
inter-links between cluster 1 and cluster 2 plasmids
were observed. This interconnection was mainly due to
plasmid pACICU1 and involves proteins predicted to be
involved in DNA transposition, recombination and replication. Interestingly proteins assigned to OXA-58 oxacillinase and AraC binding protein were shared between
pACICU1 and pABIR up to the 90% identity threshold.
The connections existing between cluster 2 and some
cluster 3 plasmids were in some cases retained also at
higher thresholds (90-100%), for instance with proteins
of pAV1 and pAV2 plasmids from A. venetianus. These
links at high threshold between clusters suggest that the
plasmids involved shared at least some common steps in
their evolutionary pathways.
f) In some cases, for instance plasmid pAV2, it is possible to recognize the traces of paralogous duplications
within the same molecule.
g) The analysis of plasmids from the same strain
revealed that, almost in all the cases, they did not share
any link at the 100% threshold except for plasmids
p2ABSDF and p3ABSDF (both from A. baumannii
SDF), which had two links corresponding to two
sequences assigned as “hypothetical proteins”. The
absence of links shared by these molecules may suggest
the absence of recent genetic exchanges between plasmids in the same host.
Analysis of nodes

To analyze the functional classes of clustered/unclustered proteins, we made use of the uniform visualization
output of the B2N software. The uniform visualization
of the proteins involved in link formation obtained at
50% and 100% protein sequence identity is shown in
Figure 2. At the 50% threshold the 213 proteins were
clustered into 46 groups comprising at least 2 proteins
per group. As might be expected, the number of clusters
decreased to 32 at the 100% sequence identity threshold.
Still, this number is surprisingly high and includes several cases (32) of genes shared at least by two plasmids
of different Acinetobacter species.
On the basis of the above assumption, each cluster
was numbered and named according to the functional
assignment of the most represented proteins in the cluster (Table 3). The analysis of data reported in Table 3
revealed that:
1) a high number of protein clusters (1-8) were constituted by proteins involved in DNA transposition.

Page 5 of 15

2) Two protein clusters (9-10), comprising 2 and 4
nodes at the 50% threshold, respectively, included proteins encoded by mob genes, that is genes involved in
plasmid transfer and/or mobilization. These two clusters
disappeared at the 100% threshold.
3) Eight protein clusters (11-18), including a high
number of plasmids (8), comprised proteins related to
mercury resistance.
4) Fourteen protein clusters (19-32) included proteins
whose function could not be assigned to a single cellular
process.
5) Lastly, protein clusters numbered from 33 up to 46
(mainly composed by only two nodes) include only
hypothetical proteins.
Overall, the number of nodes per cluster decreased
from the 50% to the 100% threshold. However, clusters
11-18 (mer-related proteins) maintained a high number
of representatives (ranging from 5 to 8) also at the 100%
threshold. This is responsible for the high number of
connections existing between plasmids belonging to
plasmid cluster 1 of Figure 1, which is (mainly) due to
the sharing of genes involved in mercury resistance.
Concerning the 280 isolated proteins, a further analysis revealed that most of them (190) perform unknown
functions and cannot be included in a functional category. Among the remaining 90 proteins, 46 of them are
involved in a known information storage and processing
and more precisely in translation and DNA replication,
recombination and repair. The other functional categories are less frequent, except for ten sequences
assigned to the COG database function “Energy production and conversion” (see [Additional file 3] for a deeper
analysis).
The information stored in these networks was then
used for the analyses presented in the next section.
Phylogenetic profiling

In order to try to depict the relationships existing
between the Acinetobacter plasmids, phylogenetic profiles at the 100% and 50% identity thresholds were computed. Data obtained are reported in Figure 3 and
[Additional file 4].
Analysis of plasmid dendrograms

The analysis of the phylogenetic profiles revealed that
the branching order in the plasmid dendrogram at 50%
identity is in partial agreement with the subdivisions
reported in the similarity network shown in Figure 1. In
details, (at least) two main clusters can be identified (c1
and c2 in Figure 3a), whereby the first one (c1) embeds
all the pKLH-family plasmids. This clustering is in
agreement with data presented in the previous sections
(Figure 1 and 2). The second cluster (c2) contains most
of the plasmids belonging to A. baumannii strains, the
two A. venetianus plasmids (pAV1 and pAV2) and the

plasmid ptet5605 from Acinetobacter strain LUH5605.
The remaining plasmids (those with no connection
between them and with the other plasmids) and the
plasmid pACICU2 and those present indifferent Acinetobacter strains, are not embedded in any of the two
clusters.
As expected, the dendrogram built when increasing
the threshold up to 100% identity possessed both
longer branches and a less defined clustering of plasmids [Additional file 4]. However, in agreement with
the data shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, the pKLH
plasmids formed a coherent cluster clearly separated
from the other plasmids. It is quite interesting that in
most cases (5 out of 6) plasmids isolated from the
same strain are more related to plasmids from other
strains/species rather than to the other plasmids from
the same strain.
The only exception to this observation is represented
by the three plasmids isolated from A. baumannii SDF.
Indeed, all of them are embedded in the same coherent
group (at 50% identity) and two of them are related also
at the 100% threshold [Additional file 4].
Analysis of protein dendrograms

The information stored in the adjacency matrix (see
Material and Methods) and previously used to build plasmids similarity dendrograms, can also be used to identify
those proteins that are commonly found together (cooccurrence) in the plasmids of the dataset. The obtained
protein co-occurrence dendrograms (Figure 3b and
[Additional file 4]) identified three main groups at the
50% identity threshold (cp1, cp2, mer). In this dendrogram all the Mer-related proteins belong to the same
cluster (mer cluster) comprising both proteins whose
function is strictly related to mercury resistance/efflux
process (their functional assignments include a cation
efflux system, periplasmatic mercuric ion binding, a mercuric ion reductase and mercury ion transport) and proteins apparently not related to heavy-metal resistance
and assigned with functions related either to regulation
or DNA mobilization. These latter may co-occur with
mercury resistance to provide accessory functions that
are necessary for the transposition and the integration of
the mer operon. In this context, it is worth noting the
presence of a common core of mer genes, which is constituted by those seven proteins with distance equal to
zero in the dendrogram at the 50% identity threshold

Figure 3 Neighbor joining dendrograms built using the Jaccard distance matrix values between phylogenetic profiles of the proteins
in the dataset (see text for details) obtained with an identity threshold of 50% for plasmids (a) and protein clusters (b).

(Figure 3b). The co/occurrence profile of these sequences
suggests that their simultaneous presence within a plasmid might be essential for mercury resistance to occur.
Indeed, this clade comprises proteins involved in mercuric ion binding, reduction and transport, although regulatory proteins are present (MerR). The main feature of
cluster cp1 is the perfect co-occurrence of OXA-58 oxacillinase with a protein assigned as AraC binding protein.
The former belongs to a well-known class of carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes (OXA-type) [39], conferring
reduced susceptibility to carbapenem to the bacterial
host cells, whereas the latter is a regulator of transcription that changes the way in which it binds DNA when
the protein forms a complex with its monosaccharide
ligand, L-arabinose [40]. Quite interestingly, the finding
that the genes encoding these two proteins are found
always together on the same plasmid molecule might
reflect the way the carbapenem resistance process is
regulated and this, in turn, provide a good target for an
experimental validation.
Cluster cp2 (Figure 3b) mainly includes proteins
whose function has not been characterized yet and,
although proposing a set of good candidates for further
experimental studies, is poorly informative for the purposes of this work.
Relationships between Acinetobacter plasmids and
chromosomes

In order to check for the existence of genes shared
between plasmids and chromosomes and to look for
possible indications of past and/or recent rearrangements between them, we compared the 493 plasmid

proteins at different identity thresholds with all the proteins of each of the available Acinetobacter genomes. It
is reasonable to assume that the higher the degree of
sequence identity shared by a chromosomal and a plasmid encoded protein, the greater the probability that the
corresponding coding gene has been exchanged between
them. For this reason, similarity (identity based) networks using each of the seven Acinetobacter completely
sequenced genome available in NCBI GenBank (A. baumannii 17978, A. baumannii AYE, A. baumannii SDF,
A. baumannii AB0057, A. baumannii AB307, A. baumannii ACICU and A. baylyi ADP1) and the 29 plasmids were constructed at different thresholds of
identity. A preliminary analysis at 50% identity including
all the 24,086 chromosomal encoded and the 493 plasmid encoded proteins was carried out, thereafter only
those chromosomal proteins sharing at least one link
with plasmid proteins were selected for comparisons at
higher thresholds. In this way, we obtained a “minichromosome” for each of the seven Acinetobacter chromosomes comprising only those proteins sharing a link
with (at least) one plasmid encoded protein. All the proteins (498) of these mini-chromosomes were then compared by B2N with the 493 plasmid encoded proteins.
The identity networks obtained are shown in Figure 4
and [Additional file 5].
Data obtained can be summarized as follows:
1. At the lowest threshold (50%) six plasmids (pYA1,
pAC450, p4ABAYE, p1ABAYE, p1ABSDF, and pAV1)
did not exhibit any link with any of the chromosomally
encoded proteins. Three of them (pYA1, pAC450,
p4ABAYE) did not share any link also with the other

(see text for the details of mini-chromosomes construction) are shown in the center and plasmids are circularly arranged. 100%, 90% and 50%
identity threshold are shown. For clarity purposes, only the name of the corresponding strain is reported on minichromosomes. Plasmids color

Fondi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/59

plasmids (see Figure 1), suggesting that these plasmids
may have originated outside these Acinetobacter strains.
The number of isolated plasmids raised to 18 at the
100% threshold. In total, at the 50% identity threshold,
359 isolated plasmid nodes were found. Most of them
(245) did not retrieve any functional assignment when
probing the COG database. Most of the 114 remaining
sequences (74) were found to be involved in translation
and DNA replication, recombination and repair
processes.
2. The pKLH-family plasmids are strongly interconnected (74 links) with the A. baumannii AYE chromosome, a connection degree which is maintained also at
higher thresholds (90% and 100%, 42 and 20 links,
respectively). Such connection, even though at a lesser
extent, was also disclosed with the A. baumanni B0057
chromosome. More in detail, at the 100% identity
threshold, connections still exist between plasmid
encoded MerC, MerR and MerE and their counterparts
on the A. baumannii AYE chromosome (in the case of
A. baumanni B0057, only MerC is connected to its
chromosomal counterpart). Lastly, two transposases
from each of the two chromosomes are linked with plasmid encoded counterparts (on the pACICU1 plasmid).
This finding strongly suggests a recent transfer of some
genes between these, either one of the two or both
chromosomes and the pKLH plasmids.
3. Concerning the DNA molecules (plasmids and
chromosomes) present in the same cytoplasm, it can be
highlighted that three (p1ABAYE, p2ABAYE, and
p4ABAYE) of the four plasmids isolated from A. baumannii AYE did not share any link with the corresponding chromosome, even at the lowest threshold (50%).
Hence, the corresponding genes have not been
exchanged between them and the host chromosome.
Their origin is unclear since they do not share any link
with the other six chromosomes either. However, it is
worth noting that plasmid p2ABAYE has several links
with other plasmids (see Figure 1) from different A.
baumanni strains. The fourth and larger plasmid
(p3ABAYE) showed only a limited connection degree
with the corresponding chromosome. Concerning the
two plasmids (pAB1 and pAB2) from strain A. baumannii 17978, pAB2 exhibited just one link with the corresponding chromosome, that disappeared at the 70%
threshold (see [Additional file 4]). A similar scenario
can be depicted for the three plasmids isolated from A.
baumanni SDF. No link, neither with its corresponding
chromosome nor with the six other ones, was disclosed
for plasmid p1ABSDF. Each of the other two plasmids
were related to the corresponding chromosome via a
single protein (assigned as transposases), which was connected to multiple (279) almost identical proteins
located on the corresponding chromosome. The only

Page 10 of 15

exception is represented by plasmids isolated from A.
baumanni ACICU, which appeared to be related to
their corresponding chromosome as well as to other A.
baumanni chromosomes.
4. At the chromosome level, at the 50% threshold the
most interconnected one was that of A. baumannii SDF
(296 shared proteins), while that with least proteins
shared with plasmids was the Acinetobacter baylyi
ADP1 chromosome (4 proteins) (Table 3). At the same
identity threshold (Figure 4c), also the plasmids of the
pKLH-family (particularly pKLH208, pKLH2, pKLH204)
and p3ABAYE showed extensive links with A. baumanni SDF chromosome. In this case three plasmid
proteins, (GI codes 14141701 from pKLH2, 30502913
from pKLH204 and 24411190 from pKLH208), all
assigned as putative transposases, were responsible for
most of the links. The functional assignment of proteins
linked at the threshold of 50% identity between chromosomes and plasmids (Table 4) revealed that the large
majority of the proteins shared are transposases or integrase. This is mostly due to as many as 279 out of 296
proteins in A. baumannii SDF and 9 out of 46 in A.
baumannii ACICU. The other proteins, excluding 26
and 59 proteins with no functional assignment and no
Pfam/COG hits respectively, were assigned to possible
transcriptional regulators, membrane proteins and
transporters, mercury resistance and detoxification.
Interestingly, A. baumannii AYE and A. baumannii
AB0057 share the highest amount of mer related proteins and integrases (4 and 2 respectively) among all the
other Acinetobacter genomes.

Discussion
The genus Acinetobacter comprises strains and species
playing an important role in different ecological niches
including soil and insects, whereas particular species
have emerged as opportunistic pathogens. Several Acinetobacter strains recovered so far harbor plasmid molecules, some of which have been correlated to the
peculiar adaptation to environmental conditions (e.g.,
pathogenicity, resistance to heavy-metals and antibiotics,
biodegradation of hydrocarbons). In this work we have
analyzed the entire set of 29 available plasmid sequences
(the currently available/accessible pan-plasmidome),
together with seven Acinetobacter fully sequenced genomes, to try to depict a possible evolutionary scenario of
plasmids within a bacterial genus, and to describe the
horizontal gene flow within this genus.
Data obtained indicate that the 29 plasmids can be
divided, by the extent of identity degree of the proteins
they code for, into different groups. In particular we
found that the group of pKLH-family plasmids and, to a
lesser extent, those harbored by different strains of A.
baumannii, are still interconnected at a high (90-100%)

amino acid sequence identity value. This finding suggests that they might be the outcome of an evolutionary
molecular history starting from ancestral plasmid backbones, which very likely underwent several and different
rearrangements during the flow in different hosts, capturing and/or losing genes from their genomes. The
analysis of networks constructed, excluding from the
analysis those sequences responsible for heavy metal
resistance and located on pKLH2-family plasmids (data
not reported), reveals that pKLH2-family plasmids share
a number of links higher than that exhibited with the
other plasmids. Besides, some of these proteins are
linked at a 100% threshold. The interconnected proteins
belonging to these pKHL2-family plasmids are involved
in processes, such as DNA synthesis and DNA translocation (cinH like), apparently not related to mercury
resistance. This finding fits with the model proposed by
Kholodii et al. [36] to explain the evolution of pKLH2
plasmids, according to which plasmids harboring mer
operons are relics of an ancient plasmid that has undergone several rounds of fusions with other plasmids, followed by deletions, stabilizing the resulting mercury
resistance plasmids. Hence, the occurrence of several
independent recombination events might have led to the

evolutionary relatedness of pHLK2, involving also the
flanking regions of the mer operon. Moreover, these
results reinforce data presented in other comparative
studies and stating that plasmids from different and
often geographically separated taxa may still share similar “core” genes [41-43]. Moreover, the finding that plasmid pAV2 (from A. venetianus VE-C3), shares some
interconnections (at 100% identity) with plasmid pAB1
from a different host species (A. baumannii), suggests
that pAV2 might be the result of recombination events
that occurred between its ancestor and (at least) the
ancestor of pAB1. This may be the case for several
other plasmids in this study. The possibility that different plasmids may have inhabited the same host cells is
emphasized by the finding that only for a few of them
Inc-like proteins, causing co-existence incompatibility
between plasmids, have been found (p3ABAYE,
pACICU2, data not shown).
From the 50% identity threshold plasmid network,
some additional information can be retrieved. In fact,
pAV1 from A. venetianus VE-C3 shows several links
with A. baumannii plasmids, while plasmids of
the pKLH family (isolated from different Acinetobacter
species) are linked with A. baumannii plasmids.

Fondi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/59

Furthermore, the finding that plasmids sharing the same
genes have been isolated from different strain/species
may suggest the existence of both an intra- and interspecific flow of these molecules through horizontal gene
transfer mechanisms. These data may suggest a timescale of events, from the older to the most recent, paralleled by the increasing identity thresholds. In other
words, some of the recombination events should have
occurred very recently since the shared proteins exhibit
a very high degree of sequence identity (up to 100%),
whereas others (involving the genes coding for proteins
sharing a low degree of sequence identity, i.e. 50%)
should be more ancient.
Based on homology relationships, a total of 46 clusters
were found among the proteins identified as connectors
between different plasmids. At the 50% identity threshold, 8 clusters are composed by proteins involved in
recombination, while the others mostly reflect the relationships between pKLH-family plasmids, being composed by genes of the mer operon involved in mercury
resistance encoded by that plasmid family.
The finding that some plasmids (or their ancestors)
might have ‘inhabited’ different cells belonging to different Acinetobacter species raises the question of what
mechanism was responsible (i.e. transduction, conjugation and/or transformation) for their transfer between
different hosts. Because most of the plasmids analyzed
are relatively small molecules and do not harbor tra
and/or mob genes, it is plausible that they might have
been transmitted through transformation and/or transduction, the latter by uptake in a bacteriophage. In fact
some bacteriophages, like P22 of Salmonella typhimurium have been shown to transduce plasmids in addition
to chromosomal markers [44] other than transconjugation. Actually, the species A. baylyi with ADP1 (BD413)
being the most widely studied strain has been shown to
be naturally competent [45-50]. For other species, this
property is largely unknown although in the literature
there are numerous unfounded assumptions that natural
competence is a general feature of the genus.
Despite the large number of links connecting most of
the plasmids in our dataset, four of them, namely pAC450,
pRAY, pYA1 and p4ABAYE, did not possess any of the
proteins identified in the similarity network and consequently did not show any link. With the exception of
pRAY, they did not share any link with the Acinetobacter
chromosomes either. The differences in gene content
exhibited by these plasmids suggests possible evolutionary
pathways that did not cross those of the other Acinetobacter plasmids and chromosomes analyzed.
To investigate more deeply the evolutionary scenario
of our plasmid dataset, we analyzed the relationships
between plasmid-borne proteins and the completely
sequenced genomes available. In fact, although

Page 12 of 15

prokaryotic plasmids have played and are still playing a
key role in metabolic and genome evolution little is
known about the evolutionary relationships existing
between them and the chromosome(s), including the
molecular rearrangements they underwent during their
flow throughout the microbial community world. Data
obtained in this work show the existence of extensive
links between all Acinetobacter chromosomes and most
plasmids (at 50% and even at 90% identity threshold).
The finding that several connections were maintained
up to the 90% identity threshold implies that the degree
of divergence between the plasmid and chromosomal
encoded proteins was very limited, which in turn
strongly suggests that the encoding genes were
exchanged (relatively) recently, independently from the
possible recombination events that may have occurred
between plasmids sharing the same protein coding gene.
This is particularly relevant for the A. baumanni AYE
chromosome, which seems to be the major contributor
of plasmid genes, since it shares at least one link with
12 out of the 29 plasmids analyzed at a 90% identity
threshold and for the A. baumanni SDF chromosome,
which shows several links with the corresponding plasmids p2ABSDF and p3ABSDF. Even though it cannot
be a priori completely excluded, the possibility that
some of the plasmids might have inherited some genes
from other species of the genus Acinetobacter or even of
other genera, the degree of sequence similarity is sufficiently high to suggest evolutionary recent exchanges
between those chromosomes and the plasmids.
It is also interesting to note that plasmids from the
same host (as pAV1 and pAV2, pAB1 and pAB2, pMAC
and pAB02) show links with different Acinetobacter
chromosomes, suggesting independent evolutionary
pathways not related to the particular host in which
they have been isolated.
Plasmids pYA1 and pAC450, i.e. two of the three that
do not share any link with the other plasmids, did not
share any link with any of the chromosomes at the identity threshold of 50%, suggesting that they may have
acquired/exchanged these genes from/with other bacterial chromosomes. However, the lack of knowledge on
the genome sequences of their respective current hosts
hampers discussion about their co-evolution with their
host’s chromosomes. In fact, the presence of a large
pangenome for the genus Acinetobacter with a core genome accounting for only 50-70% of the total genome
[51], strongly limits a full evolutionary reconstruction of
plasmid life histories. This gap will probably be filled in
the near future, when more sequence data from other
representatives of this genus will be released.
In agreement with the presence of a large mobile gene
pool, transposases are the most important functional category of shared proteins, especially for A. baumannii SDF.

Fondi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/59

This result is in line with previous findings of comparative
genomics [51] that showed that A. baumannii SDF is
riddled with numerous relics of mobile elements, including transposons, insertion sequences and prophage elements. As expected, A. baumannii AYE shares the highest
amount of mer related proteins and integrases among all
the other Acinetobacter genomes. Actually A. baumannii
AYE possesses mercury resistance genes (mer operon)
[52], whereas all the other Acinetobacter strains are not
apparently capable to detoxify mercury [51,53,54]. These
data indicate that a HGT event might have been responsible for the appearance of resistance to heavy metal in A.
baumannii AYE. According to this idea, this strain might
have acquired the whole mer resistance operon and integrated in its chromosome after a recombination event
(possibly with a pKLH2 plasmid). This finding is in agreement with data proposed by Osborn et al. [35] who suggested that transposition events appear to have been
extensively involved in the evolution of mer determinants
in Gram-negative bacteria. It is to be noticed that an event
of HGT in the opposite direction, i.e. from the Acinetobacter baumannii AYE chromosome to one or more plasmids, cannot be a priori excluded. However, since all the
other chromosomes lack the mer operon, we reckon the
first scenario as the most parsimonious and the most
probable. However, the reconstruction of the complete
evolutionary scenario of the mer genes will be possible
only when the genome sequences of strains harboring
pKLH plasmids will be available.
Increasing the threshold from 90% to 100% identity
resulted in the elimination of all the links between most
plasmids and the chromosomes. Surprisingly, also the
highly interconnected A. baumannii SDF chromosome
lost all the links between its proteins (mostly transposases) and plasmids. This latter result might be
accounted for by the hypothesis of the absence of particular structural/functional constraints acting on the
transposases, leading to a (relatively) rapid diversification of proteins during evolution. On the contrary
A. baumannii AYE, B0057 and ACICU maintained most
of the links with the plasmids, revealing either strong
functional constraints over the sequences of the shared
proteins (mainly involved in heavy-metal resistance) or,
alternatively, recent HGT events.

Conclusions
Data obtained in this work reveal that the absence of
mobilization and transfer functions in most of the
Acinetobacter plasmids seems not to pose particular barriers to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) since they have
probably a long history of rearrangements with other
plasmids and with chromosomes. Furthermore, a phylogenetic profiling pipeline was applied to the whole body
of plasmids encoded sequences, revealing interesting

Page 13 of 15

co-occurrences that, in turn, may help to shed some
light in the functioning mechanisms of proteins involved
in antibiotic resistance and mercury detoxification. In
fact, in our opinion, this analysis provides promising
candidates for further experimental validations in the
field of antibiotic resistance and bioremediation. Lastly,
we have shown that, by combining plasmid and chromosome similarity, identity based, network analysis, we
have been able to describe an evolutionary pathway also
for highly mobile genetic elements that lack extensively
shared genes. In particular, we found that transposases
and selective pressure for mercury resistance seem to
have played a pivotal role in plasmid evolution in Acinetobacter genomes sequenced so far.

Methods
Sequence data source

The dataset used in this work is composed of all the
proteins encoded by all the available completely
sequenced Acinetobacter plasmids and chromosomes,
downloaded from the NCBI ftp websites ftp://ftp.ncbi.
nih.gov/refseq/release/plasmid and ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/
genomes/Bacteria/, respectively (Table 1). On March 31
2009, 29 completely sequenced plasmids (whose lengths
range between 2,726 and 94,413 bp) were available for a
total of 493 amino acid sequences encoded. In addition,
the genomic sequences of 7 Acinetobacter strains were
also available, encoding for a total of 24,086 putative
proteins.
Network construction and phylogenetic profiling

Similarity, identity based, networks were constructed
using the tools implemented in the software B2N [15].
Networks, whereby the nodes represent the proteins and
the links connecting them represent the shared identity
values, were visualized and analyzed using the software
Visone http://visone.info/. Phylogenetic profiling dendrograms were constructed taking as input the matrix
composed by all the plasmids under analysis (rows) and
all the protein clusters (columns) identified [15]. Each
position of the phylogenetic profile matrix will be “1” in
the case a given plasmid (row) possesses (at least) one
protein in the corresponding protein cluster (column),
whereas it is filled with “0” in the opposite case. B2N
calculates the Jaccard distance for both dimensions of
the phylogenetic profiles matrix, which corresponds to
the distance between plasmids in term of shared genes,
and the distance between occurrence patterns of protein
clusters in plasmids. The Jaccard distance matrices are
then used for the construction of two neighbor-joining
dendrograms. The first one describes similarities in gene
content of the plasmids, the other one groups together
those protein clusters with the most similar occurrence
pattern within plasmids. Finally, random permutations
