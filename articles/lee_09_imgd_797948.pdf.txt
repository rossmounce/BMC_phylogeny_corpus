Abstract
Background: Sequences and organization of the mitochondrial genome have been used as
markers to investigate evolutionary history and relationships in many taxonomic groups. The
rapidly increasing mitochondrial genome sequences from diverse insects provide ample
opportunities to explore various global evolutionary questions in the superclass Hexapoda. To
adequately support such questions, it is imperative to establish an informatics platform that
facilitates the retrieval and utilization of available mitochondrial genome sequence data.
Results: The Insect Mitochondrial Genome Database (IMGD) is a new integrated platform that
archives the mitochondrial genome sequences from 25,747 hexapod species, including 112
completely sequenced and 20 nearly completed genomes and 113,985 partially sequenced
mitochondrial genomes. The Species-driven User Interface (SUI) of IMGD supports data retrieval
and diverse analyses at multi-taxon levels. The Phyloviewer implemented in IMGD provides three
methods for drawing phylogenetic trees and displays the resulting trees on the web. The SNP
database incorporated to IMGD presents the distribution of SNPs and INDELs in the mitochondrial
genomes of multiple isolates within eight species. A newly developed comparative SNU Genome
Browser supports the graphical presentation and interactive interface for the identified SNPs/
INDELs.
Conclusion: The IMGD provides a solid foundation for the comparative mitochondrial genomics
and phylogenetics of insects. All data and functions described here are available at the web site
http://www.imgd.org/.

Background
The mitochondrial genomes of members of the superclass Hexapoda (generally referred to as the 'insects') are
typically approximately 15 kilobases (kb) in length and
encode 37 genes, including 13 protein coding genes
(PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), and 22 transfer
RNA genes (tRNAs). Owing to its small size, high copy
number, and relatively infrequent gene rearrangements,
the mitochondrial genome has been extensively used for
phylogenetic analyses [1-4]. Phylogenetic analysis based
on the mitochondrial gene sequences is often limited to
closely related species, due to the high rate of nucleotide
substitutions. However, variations in the mitochondrial
gene content and order have been utilized to elucidate
evolutionary relationships among distantly-related species, on the basis of shared derived characteristics that
denote the common ancestry of a given group [5].
Recent years, the number of sequenced mitochondrial
genomes has been increasing fast due to rapidly growing
sequencing capacity [6]. For example, more than 1,200
metazoan mitochondrial genomes have already been
sequenced completely [7,8]. The abundance of available
mitochondrial genomes has led to the development of the
following web-based relational databases that are specialized for archiving the resulting data: GObase [9], AMiGA
[10], Mitome [8], MamMibase [11], OGRe [7], and NCBI
Organelle Genome Resources [12]. Some of these
resources also provide tools for data analysis and/or
viewing: MamMibase provides a web-based phylogenetic
analysis tool for studying evolutionary relationships on
the basis of the archived mitochondrial genomes [11] and
Mitome provides a graphical mitochondrial genome
browser [8]. In order to more effectively support uses of
the rapidly accumulating mitochondrial genome
sequences, an integrated platform that provides a diverse
array of analysis tools is necessary.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the insect
mitochondrial genome sequences can support fine-scale
phylogenetic analyses, as illustrated in the following
examples. Twenty-four biotypes of Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), which could not be distinguished by
morphological characteristics, were resolved [13]. SNPs
in the cytochrome c oxidase subunits I (COI) locus of
Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Cuclicidae) were used to differentiate four strains [14]. Based on the fully sequenced
mitochondrial genomes in the genus Flustrellidra (Ctenostomata: Flustrellidridae), a SNP analysis was conducted to identify a suitable gene maker for
distinguishing morphologically similar species [15].
Partially sequenced mitochondrial genes from a very
large number of species also provide valuable markers
for phylogenetic analysis. For example, the COI gene has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/148

been used extensively for species identification in the
'DNA barcoding' projects [16,17]. In particular, in
Hexapoda, DNA barcoding projects covering multiple
orders have been conducted [18-21], resulting in at least
50,000 partial sequences of COI loci in the NCBI.
Because the cytochrome c oxidase subunits II (COII)
locus is relatively small (approximately 600 bp) and can
be amplified well by PCR from diverse species [22,23],
many researchers have sequenced this locus, yielding
more than 15,000 sequences from Hexapoda. Due to the
large number of characterized insect species, sequences
of these loci are an excellent resource for comprehensive
phylogenetic analyses of insects; however, such data have
not yet been archived in the currently available
mitochondrial genome databases.
A new integrated platform named the Insect Mitochondrial Genome Database (IMGD; http://www.imgd.org/)
was developed to better integrate available mitochondrial gene and genome sequences and to provide
bioinformatics tools for efficient data retrieval and
utilization. The IMGD archives the sequences of 112
completely sequenced and 20 nearly completed mitochondrial genome sequences, as well as partial sequences
of 113,985 mitochondrial genomes (Tables 1, 2, 3) from
25,747 insect species using the standardized framework
of the Comparative Fungal Genomics Platform (CFGP;
http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr/) [24]. SNPs in the mitochondrial
genomes of multiple isolates within eight species were
identified via the SNP Analysis Platform (SAP; http://sap.
snu.ac.kr/; J. Park et al., unpublished) and presented
through the SNU Genome Browser (http://genomebrowser.snu.ac.kr/) [25]. BLAST [26], tRNAScan-SE [27],
and mFold [28] were also incorporated into IMGD.
Additionally, three phylogenetic analysis tools, including
ClustalW, PHYML, and PHYLIP [29-31], were integrated
into IMGD to facilitate analyses across multiple species:
these tools are available through the web interface
supported by Phyloviewer (http://www.phyloviewer.
org/; B. Park et al., unpublished). To assist the
comparison of these sequences and phylogenetic analysis within selected taxa, a new user interface, termed the
Species-driven User Interface (SUI), was designed and
implemented. The IMGD provides a highly integrated
environment for conducting evolutionary studies of
insects using their mitochondrial gene/genome
sequences.

input and output interfaces, and iii) the web-based user
interface, including the Species-driven User Interface
(Figure 1A). In order to support the efficient archiving
and analysis of a very large number of heterogeneous
mitochondrial gene sequences (Table 2 and Table 3), a
standardized structure for sequence data was required:
this requirement was solved using CFGP [24], which has
demonstrated its reliability and expandability via several
published databases [32-37].
To support phylogenetic studies using the archived
hexapod mitochondrial sequences, ClustalW (Version
1.83), PHYLIP (Version 3.68), and PHYML (Version 3.0)
[29-31], which support the Neighbour Joining (NJ),
Maximum Parsimony (MP), and Maximum Likelihood
(ML) methods, respectively, were incorporated. The

visualization and management of the resulting phylogenetic data are supported by the Phyloviewer (http://
www.phyloviewer.org/), which has been successfully
employed in other platforms [24,34,35]. BLAST [26]
was integrated with datasets containing mitochondrial
gene sequences and hexapod taxonomy information,
and tRNAscan-SE (Version 1.23) [27] and mFold
(Version 3.2) [28] were embedded to allow for the
display and comparison of secondary structures of tRNAs
and anticodon sequences.
The user interface of IMGD provides the Mitochondrial
Genome Browser, which is founded on the SNU Genome
Browser (http://genomebrowser.snu.ac.kr/) [25], to support the browsing and comparison of mitochondrial
genome sequences in both the text and graphical forms
via an interactive interface, and the Partial Sequence
Browser to allow for the browsing of partially sequenced
mitochondrial sequences. The IMGD also provides the
Object Browser, which can collect and move selected
sequences in IMGD into the Favorite, a personalized
virtual storage space, for further data analyses using the
analysis tools in both IMGD and CFGP [24]. The IMGD
archives sequences and taxonomical information from
more than 25,000 hexapod species. To facilitate the
organization and presentation of data according to the
taxonomic position/grouping of the species of origin, a
new interface named the Species-driven User Interface
(SUI) was designed and implemented in IMGD.
Pipeline for updating the IMGD data warehouse
To support periodic updating of the IMGD data warehouse, the following automatic analysis pipeline was
developed (Figure 1B). In the first step, completely and
partially sequenced mitochondrial genome sequences
are downloaded from NCBI using proper keywords after
filtering out unpublished sequences. The downloaded
sequences are subsequently filtered using several stop
words in order to remove non-mitochondrial sequences.
Secondly, the mitochondrial genome parsers, which were
written in PERL, parse and store the filtered data into the
data warehouse. Thirdly, adjoined stop codons at the 3'end of the PCGs that overlap with neighboring PCGs or
tRNAs in the mitochondrial genome [38], are manually
checked to determine whether they are correct or not.
Lastly, certain properties of the genome, including the
CG content, AT skew, and codon usage, are calculated for
graphical representations via SNU Genome Browser, and
various cache tables are updated. In the final step, BLAST
datasets, tRNA annotation information via both tRNAScan-SE [27] and mFold [28], and SNP databases are
updated.

*Nearly completely sequenced mitochondrial genome.

Taxonomic origins of the sequences data
archived in IMGD
The IMGD archives 132 hexapod mitochondrial genomes and 113,985 GenBank accessions of partially
sequenced mitochondrial genes, consisting of 102,430
PCGs, 19,452 rRNAs, and 17,944 tRNAs, from 25,747
species belonging to 33 orders (Table 1). More than
10,000 mitochondrial gene sequences were derived from
>1,000 species in the orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera,
Hymenoptera, and Diptera. In particular, members of
Diptera and Coleoptera account for 26 (20.00%) and 12
(9.23%) mitochondrial genomes, respectively, reflecting
active researches on these orders [39,40]. In contrast, the
following 13 orders (39.39%) are represented only by
less than 50 species in total: Dermaptera, Siphonaptera,
Zygentoma, Grylloblattodea, Mantophasmatodea,
Embioptera, Diplura, Archaeognatha, Strepsiptera,
Megaloptera, Raphidioptera, Protura, and Zoraptera
(Table 1). The underrepresentation of mitochondrial
gene sequences from many orders suggests that to
adequately support the analysis of evolutionary relationships within the Hexapoda, these underrepresented
orders require more attention.

Notable features in hexapod mitochondrial genomes
The genome size, GC content, and the number of PCGs,
tRNAs, and rRNAs of the 132 mitochondrial genomes
archived in IMGD (Table 2 and Table 3) were assessed
(Figure 2). The GC content ranges from 13.22% to
35.18% with an average of 25.09%, showing the
association at the order level (Figure 2A). The genome
sizes vary from 12,984 bp to 19,517 bp, with an average
of 15,617 bp with no clear correlation at any taxon levels
(Figure 2B). Analyses of gene order in the 112
completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes revealed
several interesting features. In 42 genomes (37.50%),
which represent 12 orders, at least 222 gene insertions,
deletions, inversions, and translocations were identified
relative to the gene arrangement of the ancestral insect
Drosophila yakuba [3,41] (Lee et al., in preparation). Gene
translocations and inversions were detected in the
following 12 orders: Collembola, Archaeognatha, Zygentoma, Hemiptera, Thysanoptera, Psocoptera, Phthiraptera, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera,
Lepidoptera, and Diptera. Gene insertions and deletions
were detected in Collembola, Ephemeroptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Phthiraptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera.

is based on BLAST. A total of 856 SNPs and 30 insertion
and deletions (INDELs) were identified (Table 4) from
187 kbp of aligned mitochondrial genome sequences
(6 pair-wise comparisons of mitochondrial genomes).
Among these, 621 SNPs (72.55%) were identified in 13
PCGs and designated as cSNPs. Figure 4 shows the
average number of cSNPs in each species, order and
PCG. Bactrocera oleae (BO), Drosophila simulans (DS), and
Reticulitermes flavipes (RF) exhibited the highest frequency of cSNPs, similar to the results from previous
genome sequence analyses [47-49]. Among the 13 PCGs,
the COI, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4), and/or
NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) genes showed
the highest frequency of SNPs in Diptera (COI and ND5)
and Isoptera (cytochrome b, ND4, and ND5) (Figure 4).
These regions can serve as potential molecular markers in
population genetic studies of these three orders.
Figure 1
The system architecture and pipeline of IMGD.
(A) Each rectangular box shows three layers. In the
standardized data warehouse, diverse databases are placed.
The middleware platform manages not only BLAST,
tRNAScan-SE, and mFold but also six phylogenetic tools
managed by Phyloviewer (http://www.phyloviewer.org/). The
web-based user interface supports browsing all information
deposited in IMGD. (B) The pipeline for archiving hexapod
mitochondrial sequences and calculating their properties was
presented as a flowchart diagram.

Examples of phylogenetic analyses results
using insectmitochondrial genomes
To demonstrate the utility of IMGD for phylogenetic
analysis and also to test the system, many phylogenetic
analyses using the data archived in IMGD have been
conducted (e.g., Figure 3). Figure 3A shows an ML
phylogenetic tree based on 19 completely sequenced and
5 nearly completed mitochondrial genomes in the order
Hemiptera, which clearly shows two major suborder
clades (Sternorrhyncha + Auchenorrhyncha and Heteroptera). The MP trees based on the COI gene sequences
(Figure 3B and 3C) revealed more comprehensive
phylogenetic relationships than those derived from
previous studies in the orders Phthiraptera [42-44] and
Mantophasmatodea [45,46].
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms among
9 insect mitochondrial genomes
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight
species with more than one mitochondrial genome
having been sequenced (Table 4), were analyzed via
the SNP Analysis Platform (http://sap.snu.ac.kr/), which

Utilities and discussion
Species-driven User Interface (SUI)
The SUI of IMGD supports efficient data retrieval and
analysis at multi-taxon levels. The SUI was developed
using Ajax technology, which supports faster performance than other methods (e.g. JavaScript and Java
applets). The SUI helps the users of IMGD search
hexapod taxa using the 'Species search' and supports
the addition and deletion of selected insect species via
the 'Species cart' function, which is similar to the cart
functions commonly used on online shopping sites
(Figure 3). After placing the taxa of interest in the cart,
they can be analyzed in the following ways: i) downloading nucleotide and protein sequences and/or storing
them into the Favorite with various options, ii) comparing gene orders, GC content/AT skew, codon usage and
position among mitochondrial genomes, iii) displaying
tRNA secondary structures predicted by tRNAScan-SE
[27] and mFold [28], iv) executing ClustalW for multiple
sequence alignment and calculating phylogenetic trees
based on three methods, including NJ, MP, and ML, with
a bootstrapping option, v) executing a BLAST search
against the selected taxa, and vi) saving species information into the Favorite for future analyses (Figure 5). Since
SUI was designed using a standardized application
programming interface (API), additional programs can
be easily incorporated into SUI.
Gene order browser for graphical presentation
of elements on the mitochondrial genome
Gene rearrangement events in the mitochondrial genomes can be used for tracing the evolutionary history of
the mitochondrial genomes in Hexapoda (Lee et al., in
preparation). The gene order browser implemented in
IMGD was designed for efficient graphical presentation

of PCGs, tRNAs, and rRNAs in the mitochondrial
genome. To display different features on the genome
graphically, the browser uses three different colors for
PCGs, tRNAs, and rRNAs, and presents names of
individual units (Figure 6). Moreover, the gene order
browser displays the gene organizations using a specific
gene as the start site for the linear genome diagrams
regardless of the arbitrary start position given to
individual mitochondrial genomes. Users can choose
the number of mitochondrial genomes to be displayed
by selecting them via SUI.

Integrated platform for phylogenetic analyses
supported by Phyloviewer
The Phyloviewer (http://www.phyloviewer.org/) provides
four phylogenetic analysis programs (ClustalW, DNAPARS/
PROTPARS, DNAML/PROML, and PHYML [29-31]) via a
common interface to support phylogenetic studies based on
the mitochondrial gene/genome sequences archived in
IMGD. Three different methods of drawing phylogenetic
trees (NJ, MP, and ML) are currently available. In addition,

sequence alignments and selecting and storing all sequences

SNU Genome Browser (http://genomebrowser.snu.ac.kr/)
[25] was implemented. This recently developed genome
browser provides an interactive user interface that supports
visualization of the alignment region between genomes
with the capability of comparing multiple genomes
simultaneously (Figure 7). It also supports the text browser
function for displaying nucleotide sequences of a selected
region, supporting the confirmation of SNPs and INDELs.
The table browser provides a list of individual elements
present in the selected region with their positional
information in a tabular form.

Favorite, a personalized virtual space for storing
data and conducting further analysis
Most of the data analysis and/or retrieval interfaces in
IMGD provide the Object Browser, which allows users to
save all or selected sequences and/or species shown into
Favorite. This will help users manage their own datasets
via IMGD. Through the interface of Favorite, BLAST, six
different phylogenetics programs, and four data analysis
tools are available for further analyses (Figure 8). The
Favorite is linked to CFGP (http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr/), which
provides not only diverse bioinformatic tools but also a
data warehouse containing complete sequences of 19
insect nuclear genomes [24], so that further analyses
with diverse resources can be conducted easily via this
web interface.

analysis tools via Phyloviewer, which supports the
interactive graphical presentation of resultant phylogenetic trees. The IMGD, supported by the SNP analysis
platform and the SNU Genome Browser, provides a
graphical view of mitochondrial genome comparisons.
In the near future, additional analysis tools, such as
PAML [50] for the determination of positive/negative

selection based on dS/dN values, will be integrated into
IMGD. Moreover, based on the database of widely
sequenced mitochondrial genes, an insect species identification system based on multiple loci can be developed.
The IMGD is expected to significantly enhance evolutionary studies on the superclass Hexapoda using rapidly
accumulating insect mitochondrial genome sequences.
