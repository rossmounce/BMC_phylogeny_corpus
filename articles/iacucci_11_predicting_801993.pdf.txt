Predicting receptor-ligand pairs through kernel
learning
Ernesto Iacucci, Fabian Ojeda, Bart De Moor and Yves Moreau*

Abstract
Background: Regulation of cellular events is, often, initiated via extracellular signaling. Extracellular signaling occurs
when a circulating ligand interacts with one or more membrane-bound receptors. Identification of receptor-ligand
pairs is thus an important and specific form of PPI prediction.
Results: Given a set of disparate data sources (expression data, domain content, and phylogenetic profile) we seek
to predict new receptor-ligand pairs. We create a combined kernel classifier and assess its performance with
respect to the Database of Ligand-Receptor Partners (DLRP) ‘golden standard’ as well as the method proposed by
Gertz et al. Among our findings, we discover that our predictions for the tgfb family accurately reconstruct over
76% of the supported edges (0.76 recall and 0.67 precision) of the receptor-ligand bipartite graph defined by the
DLRP “golden standard”. In addition, for the tgfb family, the combined kernel classifier is able to relatively improve
upon the Gertz et al. work by a factor of approximately 1.5 when considering that our method has an F-measure
of 0.71 while that of Gertz et al. has a value of 0.48.
Conclusions: The prediction of receptor-ligand pairings is a difficult and complex task. We have demonstrated that
using kernel learning on multiple data sources provides a stronger alternative to the existing method in solving
this task.

Background
Regulation of cellular events is initiated, often, via extracellular signaling. Extracellular signaling occurs when a
circulating ligand interacts with one or more membrane-bound receptors. Identification of receptor-ligand
pairs is thus an important and specific form of proteinprotein interaction (PPI) prediction. While the problem
of predicting PPI has been highly studied, little effort
has been placed on the sub-problem of predicting receptor-ligand interactions.
A tremendous amount of research has been applied to
the problem of predicting PPI. Foremost in the field has
been prediction via phylogenetic profile analysis. Generally, this type of investigation studies the similarity of
the phylogenetic history of a protein A and its putative
protein partner B. Broadly speaking, the assortment of
these types of phylogenetic studies examine the most
accurate measure of similarity between the phylogenetic
histories of A and B. Findings from these studies

support the idea that proteins which interact have similar phylogenetic profiles, as these proteins should coadapt as they are under the same evolutionary pressures
[1,2].
Bhardwaj et al. [3] make use of the phylogenetic information strategy while introducing expression data to
predict PPI. Their findings support the idea that integrating gene expression profile and phylogenetic information increases the accuracy of predictions than
phylogenetic analysis alone. The rational of using coexpression as an indicator of PPI originates from the
observation that proteins which interact for the purpose
of performing a similar function are likely to be coexpressed as they will need to be present at the same
time to carry out their common biological activity [4,5].
The notion of combining expression and phylogenetic
information to predict PPI is clearly a step in a direction
which leads us to consider a wider variety of data integration. Here we propose a framework in which other
sources of data (such as domain content) can be applied
to a kernel solution to the problem. The rational behind
incorporation of domain content information is as

follows: as certain domains are known to interact, it is
self evident that this data would provide additional
insight into the problem of determining receptor-ligand
pairs.
One of the groups which have tackled the receptorligand prediction task is Gertz et al. [6]. In their work,
they match members of the chemokines and tgfb ligand
families with their respective receptor families. They
used distance matrices of the receptors and ligands
families to measure similarity between the groups.
Through a Metropolis Monte Carlo optimization algorithm, they explored and scored possible matches
between the two matrices, until they reached optimal
solutions. While their work was successful, they rely
only on phylogenetic distance matrices, here we propose
the integration of multiple data sources to help make
more accurate matches.
We look into the use of creating a combined kernel
classifier to carry out this learning task. While many
kernel-based machine learning techniques have been
applied to the PPI task [7,8], it has hitherto never, to
our knowledge, been used on the receptor-ligand problem. Kernel learning provides the means to utilize
enigmatically related data (such as expression measures,
domain content, etc.) and perform classification in
higher dimensional space via kernel methods. In our
work, we apply the least-squares support vector
machines (LS-SVM) method based on the conclusions
by Suykens et al. [9] which shows this implementation
to be robust. As different data sources are used, separate
LS-SVM kernel classifiers were built and the combined
output used to provide a final result.
While the task addressed here is the predictions of successful protein ligand-receptor pairings, a related area of
research is the protein-chemical interaction prediction
task for which kernels have, sometimes, been applied. For
example, Nagamine et al. [10] approach this task through
the use of a SVM trained on vector representations of
protein-chemical pairs. Building on this, Jacob et al. [11]
demonstrate the utility of using hierarchical kernels to
match proteins with chemical ligands in a similar learning task. This line of research was then further advanced
by Bleakley et al. [12] who introduce the use of bipartite
local models which use kernels to successfully predict
several reported drug-target interactions.
We first describe our combined kernel classifier
method to predict receptor-ligand pairings. We then
present the bipartite-graph we derive from our findings
and compare it to our “Golden Standard” and to results
previously published by Gertz et al. [6]. Following this,
we interpret the performance of our method with
respect to this comparison. To conclude, we discuss the
benefits and limitations of our method and possible
future directions for this work.

Methods
1. Problem Formulation

Our objective is to predict candidate receptor-ligand pairs;
more specifically, we seek to create a method to identify
known pairs as well as to determine putative pairs for
further research. Our method involves using multiple data
sources (expression, phylogenetic, and protein-domain
content information), computing separate kernels for each
data type, creating LS-SVM classifiers and combining the
results to predict receptor-ligand pairs.
2. Data Sources

For the datasets used, our setting is as follows, candidate
receptor and ligand sequences were retrieved for seven
species (Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens,
Pan troglodytes, Canis familiaris, Cavia porcellus, and
Bos taurus) from ensemble build 51 [13]. The sequences
were then aligned using ClustalW [14]. Once aligned,
the sequences were edited so as to eliminate the positions which had the 5% lowest substitution scores across
the seven orthologous sequences. The pair-wise alignment score was then taken for each possible species to
species comparison between the edited orthologous
sequences (as seven species are used, a total of 21 pairwise comparisons for each candidate is created). The
distance scores form a phylogenetic vector [2] which
will then be used to create the phylogenetic kernel.
The expression for the candidates was taken from the
well-known GNF human expression atlas (79 tissues)
[15], the data was normalized (values were mean-zeroed
and the standard deviation was set to one) and was
further transformed into the expression kernel.
The domain content of each candidate protein (receptor or ligand) was taken from the Interpro Database
[16]. A vector for each candidate protein was created
where the presence of a protein domain was indicated
with a’1’ and the absence of a domain was indicated by
a ‘0’. This data was then transformed to create the
domain content kernel.
3. Kernels and LS-SVM Classifier

The above mentioned data matrices (phylogenetic, expression, and domain content) were used to create three kernels for each receptor-ligand family. LS-SVMs [9] were
trained using the three kernels to predict outcomes for
receptor-ligand pairs known from our Database of LigandReceptor Partners (DLRP) “Golden Standard”.
Our kernel function measures the similarity between
two proteins A and B (K(A,B)), one a candidate receptor
(A) and the other a candidate ligand (B). Our LS-SVM
classifier is a binary predictor which assigns new examples
in “interacting” or “non-interacting” classes. Creating the
kernels from these matrices involved trials with different
kernel functions (radial based function, linear, and

polynomial), linear functions being found to give the best
performance in all cases. A combined kernel approach was
also considered but empirical results determined that a
combined classifier approach was preferable. The regularization parameters for the LS-SVMs were tuned using a
two tier grid search which, at first, uniformly ranged from
10-6 to 106 in 101 unit steps followed by a second finer
search with 100.1 unit steps. For each candidate, data was
partitioned into training and validation sets and parameters were tuned using a 5-fold validation strategy (300
random partitions of the data were performed). The final
output of the classifiers was achieved by a leave-one-out
strategy. The classifier values were scaled (minimum set to
zero, maximum set to one) and combined, as defined in
(1), for a final result. Figure 1 provides an overview of the
workflow as described above.

4. Construction of the Receptor-Ligand Bipartite Graph

We take as our “Golden Standard” the receptor-ligand
dataset from the The Database of Ligand-Receptor

Matrix

Partners (DLRP) [17]. In this dataset, cytokines and
interleukins (as well as other ligands) are taken and
paired with their corresponding receptor partners.
These interactions are then represented in an adjacency
matrix where an interaction is represented as a ‘1’ and
lack of interaction is represented as a ‘0’. These are the
values we are ultimately trying to predict.
In order to compare the pairings predicted by the
combined kernel classifier, we compared the known
bipartite receptor-ligand graph (constructed from the
known DLRP values) with the predictions from [6] and
from the combined kernel classifier. As the combined
classifier values are continuous and known values (from
DLRP) are binary, it is necessary to determine a threshold value t to distinguish between the two classes. The
thresholds for each ligand are considered and evaluated
as follows. Edges between receptor and ligands are
assigned based on the decision function defined in (2),
the predicted edge set is then compared to the “golden
standard“ and the precision and recall are calculated.
The optimal threshold t is then determined by taking
the average classifier value of the maximal “F-measure“
(3) for each ligand. The bipartite graph is then constructed using the edge set resulting from the optimal

Results and Discussion
The known tgfb receptor-ligand set used by Gertz et al.
[6] consists of 18 known matches. Gertz et al. [6] predicted 15 edges, 8 of which were supported and 7 of
which were unsupported. In contrast, our tgfb set consists of 79 known edges, and our approach predicts 90
edges, 60 of which were correct and 30 of which were
unsupported. The detailed pairings for this family are
shown in Table 1.
We discover that our predictions for the tgfb family
accurately reconstruct over 76% of the supported edges

(0.76 recall and 0.67 precision) of the receptor-ligand
bipartite graph defined by the DLRP. In addition, the
combined kernel classifier is able to relatively improved
upon the Gertz et al. [6] work by a factor of approximately two as the Gertz et al. [6] work reconstructs 44%
of the supported edges (0.44 recall and 0.53 precision)
of the receptor-ligand bipartite graph defined by the
DLRP. For this family of receptors and ligands, there
exists an advantage in our approach to make predictions
as we reconstruct more known edges and introduce less
noise. Comparing F-measures, we see that our method
improved upon that of Gertz et al. [6] significantly as
our method has an F-measure of 0.71 while that of
Gertz et al. [6] has a value of 0.48.
The known chemokine receptor-ligand set used by
Gertz et al. [6] consists of 63 known matches. Gertz et
al. [6] predicted 38 edges, 14 of which were supported
and 24 of which were unsupported. In contrast, our chemokine set consists of 53 known matches, and our
approach predicts 98 edges, 22 of which were correct
and 76 of which were unsupported. Our classifier was

constructed using ligands which have at least two receptor partners as this greatly improved the precision (0.67
recall and 0.12 precision when all the ligands are used
in the classifier). The detailed pairings for this family are
shown in Table 2.
We also find that our predictions for the chemokine
family accurately reconstruct over 65% of the supported
edges (0.65 recall and 0.23 precision) of the receptorligand bipartite graph defined by the DLRP. In addition,
the combined kernel classifier is able to relatively
improved upon the Gertz et al. [6] work by a factor of
approximately three as the Gertz et al. [6] work reconstructs 22% supported edges (0.22 recall and 0.37 precision) of the receptor-ligand bipartite graph defined by
the DLRP. While the precision of the Gertz et al. [6] is
higher, the recall of our method is about three fold
higher. Comparing F-measures, we see that our method
improved upon that of Gertz et al. [6], slightly as our
method has an F-measure of 0.33 while that of Gertz et
al. [6], has a value of 0.27.
Qualitatively, the performance of our method also
seems to be matching the performance of Gertz et al.
[6], as the novel interaction of CCR1 with SCY11 [18]
reported in their work is also discovered using our
method.
The overall results presented here support the notion
that kernel learning presents a useful methodology for
elucidating receptor-ligand pairing. Using disparate data
sources, we propose a combined kernel classifier which
is able to reconstruct the majority of known edges in
the chemokine and tgfb receptor-ligand bipartite graphs.
In order to evaluate our pairings, we consider the bipartite graph which we construct from our results (see Figure 2). The success of the results are summarized by
two performance measures; the recall and the precision
of the edges predicted in the tgfb and chemokine bipartite graphs. The relative performance of each method
examined here is evaluated using the F-measure.
The combined classifier performs better using the tgfb
family of receptors and ligand than using the chemokine
family of receptors and ligands. This can be attributed
to two reasons. Firstly, the tgfb has more positive examples than the chemokine family to train with. Secondly,
the tgfb family is more evolutionarily related while the
chemokine family is related by function. Thus, it is
more difficult to learn with data from the chemokine
family as there is less evolutionarily related structure
inherent to the data for the LS-SVM to learn with.
The benefits of the combined kernel classifier method
are clear. Foremost in the advantages are the ability to
predict multiple ligands for one receptor, which

represents an imperative feature for receptor-ligand
research. In addition, as the classifier output is continuous, the results can be considered to be prioritized, this
presents a major convenience to researchers as often the
set of candidate ligands are large and resources to validate few. The major limitation of the method rests in
the need to have training examples for receptor-ligands
which one is trying to predict. This is particularly true
for predicting the pairing in the chemokine dataset as
when we consider only ligand candidates with two or
more receptor pairings, the precision performance of
our method improves (0.79 recall and 0.31 precision)
(see Table 1).
The advantage of using the three sub-classifiers
instead of a global classifier which combines all features
is two fold. The first reason is that the data sources
used here are disparate and heterogeneous. A global
classifier would require a mapping step which may
introduce some noise. The second reason is that using

separate sub-classifiers would allow for removal and
addition of sub-classifiers. For example, if a better
micro-array dataset becomes available in the future, it
would be an advantage to be able remove the existing
expression-based kernel with one derived from the new
dataset without having to the retrain a global classifier.
Also, if additional data sources become available, adding
an additional sub-classifier based on the new data
source would take less time to train than adding the
data source and retraining the global classifier.
A practical advantage of using three sub-classifiers in
our work became apparent when considering the performance of the individual classifiers versus that of the
combined kernel classifier. More specifically, the combined kernel classifier performed equally as well or better than any of the individual classifiers. In the case of
the chemokine family, the performance of all three individual classifiers was not nearly as good as the combined kernel classifier. In the case of the tgfb family, the

Iacucci et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:336
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/336

expression classifier performed nearly as well as the
combined kernel classifier (see Additional File 1, Table
S1).

Conclusions
The prediction of receptor-ligand pairings is a difficult
and complex task. We have demonstrated that using
multiple data sources provide an advantage over single
data sources in solving this task. The use of multiple
data sources allows us to extend our method as new
data becomes available. Among our main contributions
we count the ability of our method to prioritize candidate pairs, which represents an imperative feature for
receptor-ligand research. As in-vivo validation is costly
and time consuming, it’s important that researchers
have a ranking of a, potentially, large number of candidates. In addition, we provide a method which has high
recall (0.76 and 0.67) and improved F-measures when
compared to Gertz et al. [6] (0.71 for Iacucci et al. vs
0.48 for Gertz et al. [6] when evaluationg the tgfb family
and 0.33 for Iacucci et al. vs 0.27 for Gertz et al [6]
when evaluating the chemokine family). Thus, the
method is reliable in so far that it will retrieve a large
portion of the true positives while not introducing too
much noise. As more high throughput data becomes
available, we expect to extend the current methodology
to accommodate it.
