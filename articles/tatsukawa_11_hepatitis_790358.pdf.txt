Abstract
Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of hepatocarcinogenesis.
To identify mutations relevant to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, we compared the full genome
sequences of HBV from the sera of patients with and without HCC.
Methods: We compared the full genome sequences of HBV isolates from 37 HCC patients (HCC group 1) and 38
patients without HCC (non-HCC group 1). We also investigated part of the core promoter region sequences from
40 HCC patients (HCC group 2) and 68 patients without HCC. Of the 68 patients who initially did not have HCC, 52
patients remained HCC-free during the follow-up period (non-HCC group 2), and 16 patients eventually developed
HCC (pre-HCC group 2). Serum samples collected from patients were subjected to PCR, and the HBV DNA was
directly sequenced.
Results: All patients had genotype C. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the HBV genome between HCC
group 1 and non-HCC group 1 revealed that the prevalence of G1613A and C1653T mutations in the core promoter
region was significantly higher in the HCC group. These mutations tended to occur simultaneously in HCC patients.
Multivariate analysis with group 2 revealed that the presence of HCC was associated with aging and the double
mutation. Future emergence of HCC was associated with aging and the presence of a single G1613A mutation.
Conclusions: G1613A and C1653T double mutations were frequently found in patients with HCC. A single G1613A
mutation was associated with future emergence of HCC. These mutations may serve as useful markers in
predicting HCC development.

Background
Approximately 2 billion people worldwide have been
infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Of these, 350
to 400 million are chronic carriers of the virus [1,2]. The
clinical state of HBV infection is variable, ranging from
acute hepatitis to various forms of chronic liver disease,
such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) [1].

Chronic HBV infection is a risk factor for HCC. Chronic
inflammation and liver fibrosis caused by chronic HBV
infection contributes to the occurrence of HCC [1]. However, in addition to these host factors, HBV itself has a
direct role in the development of HCC [3,4]. A significant
proportion of HBV-related HCCs arise in otherwise normal livers [5,6], and animal models transfected with this
virus genome develop HCC; these observations confirm
the oncogenic potential of HBV in the liver [3,7]. Although
a considerable amount of research has been conducted,
the molecular basis of HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis
remains unknown [8,9].

If HBV were directly oncogenic, variations in HBV
could account for some of the heterogeneity in the clinical course of HCC development. Several studies have
examined mutations within the HBV genome that may
be associated with HCC. Genotypic diversity is related
to differences in clinical and virological characteristics.
For example, genotype C infected patients have more
severe chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and
HCC [5,10]. As for deletions and point mutations,
which are more subtle genetic variations than genotype,
previous studies have found some clues, such as codon
38 in × gene, A1762T/G1764A basal core promoter
(BCP) mutation, and deletion of pre-S and × protein
[11-13], but definitive conclusions have not yet been
made.
Bias might be created by studying a limited number of
patients, a limited section of the HBV-DNA sequence,
and patients with different genotypes of HBV. Therefore,
whole sequences of HBV-DNA from a genetically similar
cohort of patients infected with the same HBV genotype
might reduce viral genotypic and host genetic biases. In
the present study, we investigated whole genome
sequences of circulating HBV-DNA from the sera of
HCC patients who were infected with HBV genotype C
in the western part of Japan.

Methods
Patients

Between 1988 and 2004, a total of 575 patients in our
hospital were diagnosed as having HBV-related chronic
liver diseases, and 138 of these patients developed HCC.
Seventy-five patients were diagnosed with HCC at their
first visit, and 63 patients were diagnosed with HCC during the subsequent follow-up period. The patient age
range was from 29 to 75 years old, and there were 27
women and 111 men.
We excluded patients who were presumed to have
acute hepatitis B based on their sexual history, intravenous drug use or exposure to blood products, serological
markers including high IgM-HBc antibody positivity and
imaging findings showing no chronic liver disease with
ultrasonography or computed tomography. Patients who
had a history of alcoholism or other causes of hepatitis,
such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis,
and Wilson’s disease were also excluded. We also
excluded patients with a very low viral load due to our
inability to extract HBV DNA from their serum. In total,
we studied 217 serum samples from 183 patients with
chronic HBV. Informed consent was obtained from each
participant. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Okayama University Hospital.
Diagnosis of HCC was based on positive findings
on ultrasonography, computed tomography and/or
angiography.

Design of the study

The overall study consisted of the following: (1) a
matched case-control study was designed to find HBV
mutations (from the entire HBV genome) significantly
associated with HCC; (2) an unmatched case-control
study was designed to validate the mutations associated
with HCC; and (3) a nested case-control study in a
cohort designed to see if the mutations found in the previous two case-control studies at baseline can predict the
occurrence of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Isolates used for complete genome sequencing

Complete viral genome sequencing was performed on viral
DNA isolated from the sera of 37 patients who had HCC
(HCC group 1) and 38 patients who did not have HCC or
develop HCC during the follow-up period (non-HCC
group 1). The mean follow-up period was 8.1 years. Serum
samples from patients in non-HCC group 1 were collected
at their first visit. The ages and sex of non-HCC group 1
patients were matched with HCC group 1 patients. The
patients from HCC group 1 and non-HCC group 1 had an
HBV titer that was sufficient to extract enough DNA to
determine the entire nucleotide sequence of the HBV genome. Patients did not have on nucleos(t)ide analogue
treatment at the time of serum correction to extract
enough DNA for sequencing. Liver histology was available
for only 12 patients in non-HCC group 1 and was not
used for statistical analysis. Three patients had stage 1
fibrosis; 6 patients had stage 2 fibrosis; and 3 patients had
stage 3 fibrosis.
The characteristics of these patients are shown in
Table 1. We could not calculate the MELD (Model for
End-Stage Liver Disease) score as a liver function marker because prothrombin time data for many patients
were unavailable. We compared the sequences of the
entire HBV genome between the two groups.
Isolates used for core promoter sequences

To define the reliability of correlations between core promoter mutations and hepatocarcinogenesis drawn by the
whole genome analysis, we sequenced a small part of the
core promoter region of an additional 108 isolates. Forty
isolates were obtained from the HCC patients (HCC
group 2), and 68 isolates were from the patients without
HCC at their first visit. Of these 68 patients, 16 patients
who developed HCC during the follow-up period were
defined as pre-HCC group 2, and 52 patients who did not
develop HCC were labeled as non-HCC group 2.
The mean follow-up period was 5.8 years for the nonHCC group 2 and 9.5 years for the pre-HCC group 2.
Extraction and amplification of serum HBV DNA

Serum samples were stored at -30°C until use. Nucleic
acids were extracted from 200 μL of serum using a

commercially available kit (QIAamp DNA Blood Mini
Kit; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA).
To obtain a full-length HBV DNA sequence from the
nucleic acids, we performed nested PCR to amplify two
overlapping fragments with a PfuTurbo polymerase kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR primer sequences
and the relative positions of these PCR fragments on the
genetic map of HBV DNA are shown in Table 2.
For sequencing a small part of the core promoter
region, we performed PCR using 5F/5R primers

using a Chi-square test with Bonferroni’s correction.
Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the likelihood of a nucleotide change due to the influence of various factors related to the risk of HCC development.
Cumulative HCC incidence curves were determined
using the Kaplan-Meier method and the differences
between groups were assessed with the log-rank test. Cox
proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify significant factors that influence future HCC
development.

Nucleotide sequencing of PCR products

Results

PCR products were sequenced directly by the dideoxy termination method using the Big Dye Terminator cycle
sequencing Ready Reaction Kit ver. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with modifications and an automatic sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyser;
Applied Biosystems). PCR products were sequenced in
forward and reverse directions. Sequence alignment was
performed by using the multiple-alignment algorithm in
MegAlign (DNASTAR, Windows version 5.06, WI).

Genotyping

Statistics

SAS software (Version 6, SAS Institute Inc., NC) was
used to conduct the statistical analysis. Continuous data
were expressed as mean ± SD and were analyzed with
one-way ANOVA for normally distributed data and with
the Kruskal-Wallis test for other data. Categorical data
were analyzed with Pearson’s Chi-square test. If a statistical difference was found, we compared the groups by

Phylogenetic trees that were constructed using the
neighbor-joining method revealed that all patients in
our study had genotype C and subgenotype C2.
Analysis of full sequences

To identify mutations associated with hepatocarcinogenesis, we studied the complete nucleotide sequences of
the HBV genome isolated from the sera of patients who
had HCC (HCC group 1; [DDBJ: AB670237-AB670273])
and who had not developed HCC (non-HCC group 1;
[DDBJ: AB670274-AB670311]).
Several deletions were found in the HBV genome. Most
deletions were located in the pre-S and × regions. However, there were no significant differences between HCC
group 1 (2 patients with pre-S1 deletions, 1 patient with
pre-S2 deletion) and non-HCC group 1 (2 patients with
pre-S1 deletions, 3 patients with BCP/X deletions).

promoter region. The results of the core promoter region
analysis were similar to our results from the whole genome sequencing. The rate of the G1613A and C1653T
mutations were significantly higher in patients with HCC
(Table 4). The rate of the G1613A and C1653T mutations was 50% and 50% in HCC group 2, while each of
these mutations was found in only 12% of the non-HCC
group 2 (p < 0.05). Statistical analysis revealed that
G1613A and C1653T mutations were dependent on each
other. The rate of the G1613A mutation was significantly
higher in isolates with the C1653T mutation as compared
to isolates without the C1653T mutation (65% vs. 34%, p
< 0.05) and vice versa (65% vs. 34%, p < 0.05). The combination of these mutations was significant in HCC
group 2. The G1613A and/or the C1653T mutations
were found at a significantly lower frequency in the nonHCC group 2. Clinical parameters, such as aging, albumin level and platelet count, showed a tendency to be
related to HCC group 2 (Table 1), indicating that these
mutations might occur with liver fibrosis progression.
However, the double mutation rate was high only in
HCC group 2 (Table 4).

We determined whether the positivity of the HBe antigen
(HBeAg) was related to the mutations. The G1613A
mutation was found in 32% of HBeAg-positive patients
and 24% of HBeAg-negative patients (N.S. data not
shown). The C1653T mutation was found in 27% of
HBeAg-positive patients and in 31% of HBeAg-negative
patients (N.S.). The double mutation rate was not different with positivity of the HBeAg (14% HBeAg-positive vs.
18% HBeAg-negative). The positive rate of HBeAg did
not correlate with these mutations (Table 5). The mutations tended to occur with aging in HCC group 2,
although this tendency was not statistically significant.
The ratio of mutation was not different with aging in
non-HCC group 2.

To identify point mutations relevant to HCC, we compared each nucleotide of the whole sequences of the
HBV genome between HCC group 1 and non-HCC
group 1. Of all 3215 base pairs, only two nucleotides
showed significant differences between HCC group 1 and
non-HCC group 1 (Table 3). The two mutations were
both located in the core promoter region. A G-to-A
mutation at nucleotide 1613 occurred in 38% of HCC
group 1 and 10% of non-HCC group 1 (p < 0.008). A Cto-T mutation at nucleotide 1653 occurred in 45% of
HCC group 1 and 19% of non-HCC group 1 (p < 0.05).
The A1762T/G1764A BCP mutation rate was not different between HCC group 1 and non-HCC group 1
(75% vs. 72%). However, the BCP mutation was frequently found in conjunction with the G1613A mutation or the C1653T mutation. The odds ratio of the
BCP mutation was 8.2 in the G1613A mutant and 4.62
in the C1653T mutant as compared to wild type (p <
0.05).
Comparison of sequences in the core promoter region

We suspected that the two mutations in the core promoter region were relevant to hepatocarcinogenesis. To
determine the reliability of this result, we examined an
additional 108 isolates to sequence a part of the core

Multivariate analysis

To evaluate the effect of the mutations on the development of HCC, multiple logistic regression analysis was
performed with the clinical features and the G1613A
and C1653T mutations (Table 6).
In our first analysis, we used HCC group 2 and nonHCC group 2 to evaluate the effect of the double mutation on the presence of HCC. The following characteristics, which were proven to be statistically significant
with univariate analysis, were used for multiple logistic
regression analysis: age ≥45, Plt (×10 4 /μl) ≤14, ALT
(≥70), and the presence of G1613A and C1653T. The
presence of HCC was associated with the double mutation and increased age.

In our second analysis, we used non-HCC group 2
and the pre-HCC group 2 to evaluate the effect of the
mutation on the later occurrence of HCC. The following
characteristics, which were proven to be statistically significant with univariate analysis, were used for multiple
logistic regression analysis: age ≥45 years, male, and the
G1613A mutation. The presence of the G1613A mutation was significantly higher in the group that later
developed HCC. However, cox proportional hazard

regression analysis showed only low platelet count to be
the predictor of later HCC occurrence.

Discussion
In the present study, we compared the whole HBV genome sequence of 37 HCC patients with 38 non-HCC
patients. All patients were infected with genotype C
viruses, and the most common mutations were G1613A
and C1653T. Patients with both mutations were at a

particularly high risk for the presence of HCC. The
association between these mutations and hepatocellular
carcinoma development was confirmed in an analysis of
183 subjects. An analysis of HCC development during
the patient follow-up period revealed that the presence
of G1613A and/or C1653T mutations was more prevalent in patients who developed HCC long afterward, as
compared to the patients who never developed HCC.
Several studies have revealed the relationship between
mutations and hepatocarcinogenesis [9,13-18]. Our hospital is located in the western side of Japan, where genotype C is endemic [19], population mobility is low and
the ethnicity is homogeneous. The resulting similarities
among study subjects support the reliability of our
results.
The risk for hepatocarcinogenesis is higher in genotype
C HBV patients as compared with other genotypes [20]. In

different genotypes, the effect of a single point mutation
on the function of viral proteins could be different. Our
results shed light on the risk of viral mutations on hepatocarcinogenesis in high-risk HBV genotype C (subgenotype
C2)-infected patients.
The G1613A and C1653T mutations are both located
in the core promoter region [21]. Mutations in the core
promoter region have clinical consequences to the host
caused by changes in viral characteristics, such as transcription of the pregenomic and pre-C RNAs.
The nucleotide at position 1613 is located at the Nterminal end of the negative regulatory element, upstream
of Enhancer II (ENII), which can repress the function of
ENII [22]. Mutational analysis has shown that the
sequence from 1612 to 1615 is responsible for the repression activity of the negative regulatory element [23]. The
1613 mutation can result in the failure of the repression
function of the negative regulatory element and in the proliferation of virus-related proteins that might induce hepatocarcinogenesis. Nucleotide 1613 is also located within
overlapping open reading frames, the × gene at codon 80
(which results in a synonymous change in × protein) and
polymerase gene, which contains the C-terminal side of
the RNaseH domain (A to K change).
The nucleotide at position 1653 is located in the core
upstream regulatory sequence (CURS) region, which has a
strong stimulatory effect on the basic core promoter independent of enhancer II [24]. CURS is divided into two
regions, A (5’-half; nucleotides 1636-1703) and B (3’-half;
nucleotides 1704-1743), which can independently stimulate BCP activity. The 1653 position is located in the box
alpha domain that might change the stimulatory effect on
BCP. Nucleotide 1653 is also located within the × gene at
codon 94. × protein binds and affects several intracellular
signal transduction pathways, cell cycle progression, and
apoptosis regulation [25]. Codon 94 of × protein is
included in area of several transcription factor binding
sites, such as CREB, RPB5, TFIIB, XAP-1, C/EBPalpha,

Tatsukawa et al. BMC Cancer 2011, 11:458

and XAP-3. Although this region does not directly bind
p53 protein, it contains a p53-dependent transcriptional
repression binding site that is necessary for negative regulation of a p53-induced viral-specific DNA enhancer
[21,26].
Several previous studies have reported the association
of the mutations at 1613 or 1653 with HCC development.
In a Japanese study, Takahashi et al. found that G1613A
and C1653T occurred in 38% and 40%, respectively, of 40
HCC patients [15]. However, their study did not include
a non-HCC control group and did not analyze confounding host factors. Shinkai et al. reported that the combination of C1653T and/or V1753 mutations in addition to
T1762/A1764 mutations was differentially associated
with HCC in HBeAg-positive genotype C patients [27].
Although nucleotide 1613 was outside the range of their
sequence analysis, their data were partially consistent
with our observations. A recent study from China
revealed that 1613 and 1653 mutations were included in
mutations frequently detected in HCC patients; however,
core region mutants A2189C and G2203W were independent risk factors for HCC [18]. A meta-analysis of 43
studies revealed that PreS mutation, C1653T, T1753V,
and A1762T/G1764A were dominant in HCC [28]. PreS
mutation in genotype C virus was more strongly associated with HCC than PreS mutation in genotype B virus.
We could not find any significant differences of the PreS
region. Our patient population had an average age of 38
years, which might be too young to accumulate such
mutations or large deletions.
Although there have been many reports of important
mutations, a definite consensus regarding the significance
of mutations in HCC development has not yet been
reached. Several factors have made it difficult to reach a
consensus. It is difficult to define non-HCC patients, and
even when patients are HCC-free for several years, they
may eventually develop HCC. Moreover, there are many
confounding factors in hepatocarcinogenesis, such as
patient age, HBeAg status, and liver cirrhosis. Another
limitation of previous studies was the relatively small number of subjects (40 or less) and the mixture of several HBV
genotypes. We compared 37 HCC patients with 38 nonHCC patients. Our multivariate analysis with 40 HCC
group 2 patients and 52 non-HCC group 2 patients
revealed that HCC was associated with increased age and
the presence of the 1613/1653 double mutation. The
mutations might increase with aging; however, the age
matched case-control study revealed the significance of
the mutations. The future emergence of HCC is correlated
with only G1613A mutation, while the double mutation
was associated with the presence of HCC. Acquiring the
double mutation might affect the carcinogenesis. Further
studies regarding the functional changes in HBV DNA

induced by this combination of mutations are clearly
needed.
The BCP or precore mutations have been reported to be
associated with patient characteristics, such as age, sex,
HBeAg-positive status and the clinical course as fulminant
hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, especially in genotype C
[21,29-31]. Since these mutations are frequently found
among patients without HCC, the use of these mutations
as a marker for HCC surveillance may not be cost effective
[32]. In the present study, the BCP mutation was found in
75% of HCC patients and 72% of non-HCC patients,
which is not statistically different. Since our subjects all
had genotype C virus, this high frequent BCP mutation
rate is appropriate. In genotype C virus infected patients,
the BCP mutation is reported to accumulate as aging and
associated with an increased risk of HCC, however, when
the BCP mutation coexisted with precore mutation, the
risk of HCC have decreased [33,34]. Probably the BCP
mutation needs combination of other several mutations to
induce hepatocarcinogenesis. Our patients’ ages were 37
for HCC group 1 and 38 for non-HCC group 1 suggesting
young enough not to accumulate these mutations. The
G1613A and C1653T mutations were not associated with
sex or HBeAg-positive status. Our follow-up analysis
revealed that the G1613A mutation was prevalent in
patients who would later develop HCC. This result suggests that these mutations could predict HCC development. In our study, the mean follow-up period was 8.1
years. Although this amount of time is not a measure of
the whole lifetime of patients with chronic HBV infection,
it is long enough to evaluate the incubation period of
HCC.
The PreS mutation in genotype C virus is more strongly
associated with HCC than the PreS mutations in genotype
B virus [35]. Deletions of preS2 or × have been reported to
be associated with HCC development [33,34]. However, in
our study, deletions in the pre-S1/S2 gene were observed
similarly in the HCC group and non-HCC group. Our
patient population might be too young to accumulate
such mutations or large deletions as BCP were. Pre-S2 variants have been revealed that could not express pre-S2 and
normal sized pre-S1 proteins, resulting in the retention of
HBs antigen (HBsAg) in the cytoplasm with a subsequent
decrease in HBsAg and HBV-DNA in serum [34]. In the
present study, we included only the subjects with high
viral load that was sufficient to analyze the whole genome
sequences. This may be one additional reason why we did
not frequently find pre-S2 variants, which should be found
in patients with a low viral load.
The predictive value of the mutation results is relatively
high. This might be the results of small number of the
cohort as the 95% confidence interval is wide. For more
precise analysis, we need more number of the patients.

We had attempted to add more samples for sequencing.
However, recently diagnosed patients are almost all treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues. As a result, the viral
DNA levels are very low, and it is difficult to add more
samples.

Conclusions
We analyzed the full-length sequence of peripheral
blood serum HBV DNA of HCC and non-HCC patients.
Two mutations in the core promoter region, G1613A
and C1653T, were associated with hepatocarcinogenesis.
A single G1613A mutation was associated with future
emergence of HCC that could be a marker for predicting HCC development.
