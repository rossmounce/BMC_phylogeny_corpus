Abstract
Background: The transition from water to land was a key event in the evolution of vertebrates
that occurred over a period of 15–20 million years towards the end of the Devonian. Tetrapods,
including all land-living vertebrates, are thought to have evolved from lobe-finned (sarcopterygian)
fish that developed adaptations for an amphibious existence. However, while many of the
biomechanical and physiological modifications necessary to achieve this feat have been studied in
detail, little is known about the sensory adaptations accompanying this transition. In this study, we
investigated the visual system and visual ecology of the Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri,
which is the most primitive of all the lungfish and possibly the closest living relative to the ancestors
of tetrapods.
Results: Juvenile Neoceratodus have five spectrally distinct retinal visual pigments. A single type of
rod photoreceptor contains a visual pigment with a wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) at
540 nm. Four spectrally distinct single cone photoreceptors contain visual pigments with λmax at
366 (UVS), 479 (SWS), 558 (MWS) and 623 nm (LWS). No double cones were found. Adult lungfish
do not possess UVS cones and, unlike juveniles, have ocular media that prevent ultraviolet light
from reaching the retina. Yellow ellipsoidal/paraboloidal pigments in the MWS cones and red oil
droplets in the LWS cones narrow the spectral sensitivity functions of these photoreceptors and
shift their peak sensitivity to 584 nm and 656 nm, respectively. Modelling of the effects of these
intracellular spectral filters on the photoreceptor colour space of Neoceratodus suggests that they
enhance their ability to discriminate objects, such as plants and other lungfishes, on the basis of
colour.
Conclusion: The presence of a complex colour vision system based on multiple cone types and
intracellular spectral filters in lungfishes suggests that many of the ocular characteristics seen in
terrestrial or secondarily aquatic vertebrates, such as birds and turtles, may have evolved in shallow
water prior to the transition onto land. Moreover, the benefits of spectral filters for colour
discrimination apply equally to purely aquatic species as well as semi-aquatic and terrestrial animals.
The visual system of the Australian lungfish resembles that of terrestrial vertebrates far more
closely than that of other sarcopterygian fish. This supports the idea that lungfishes, and not the
coelacanth, are the closest living relatives of the ancestors of tetrapods.

Background
Lungfishes (Dipnoi) diverged from the main vertebrate
stock in the early Devonian (ca. 390 MYA) [1] and
together with coelancanths and the extinct osteolepimorphs comprise the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish). While it
is generally agreed that tetrapods evolved from sarcopterygian fish, phylogenetic relationships within the Sarcopterygii have been the subject of considerable debate [2,3].
A recent consensus, based on the analysis of nuclear DNA
[4] mitochondrial DNA [5] and ribosomal RNA gene
sequences [6], is that lungfishes rather than coelacanths
are the closest living relatives of the tetrapods.
Worldwide, there are six extant species of lungfishes: four
in Africa, one in South America and one in Australia. All
African (Protopterus sp.) and South American (Lepidosiren)
lungfishes belong to the Lepidosirenidae; the Australian
lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri; Fig. 1) is the only surviving
species in the Ceratodontidae [4,7]. Compared with the
other species of lungfishes, which have paired lungs,
Neoceratodus has a single lung and uses predominantly gill
respiration, only breathing air during periods of increased
activity or when water quality is poor [7]. Based on this
and other morphological, molecular and palaeontological evidence, Neoceratodus is considered to be the more
primitive lungfish species [8,9].
Although originally considered to be rather degenerate
[10] and of little behavioural importance [11], the visual
system of the lungfish represents something of a conun-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/21

drum. The eyes of lungfishes are small relative to body
size when compared with other vertebrates [12-14] and
have low spatial resolving power [15,16]. Moreover,
behavioural studies of both captive and wild populations
of Neoceratodus suggest that, except during the breeding
season, they are predominantly crepuscular or nocturnal
in habit [7,17]. Nevertheless, the retina of Neoceratodus
has at least three morphologically distinct cone photoreceptor types, some of which contain brightly coloured oil
droplets or spectral filters [15,18], and expresses multiple
visual pigment opsin genes [19]. Coloured oil droplets/
spectral filters (combined with multiple spectral subtypes
of cone photoreceptor) are characteristic of strongly diurnal (and generally terrestrial) non-mammalian vertebrates, such as birds, turtles and lizards [10] and are
thought to improve colour vision by tuning the spectral
sensitivity functions of the cones [20,21]; densely pigmented spectral filters are generally absent from nocturnal
or crepuscular species [10] because they absorb light and
reduce absolute sensitivity.
Thus, the polychromatic visual system of the lungfish is at
odds with its known behavioural characteristics and raises
a number of interesting questions with regard to the neuroethology of the lungfish, the function and utility of coloured oil droplets and the evolution of the tetrapod visual
system. To investigate these issues, we have measured
some of the most important parameters of the visual ecology of Neoceratodus forsteri: the spectral absorption characteristics of the visual pigments and spectral filters
(pigmented oil droplets and diffuse pigment in the ellipsoid and paraboloid regions) of the retinal photoreceptors, the spectral transmittance of the ocular media, the
spectral distribution of the ambient light in a typical lungfish habitat and the spectral reflectance of relevant objects
in its environment. Using these data, we have modelled
the performance of the lungfish visual system with respect
to its ability to distinguish both real and theoretical coloured objects.

Photoreceptor visual pigments, spectral filters and spectral
sensitivity
The retina of the Australian lungfish is duplex, containing
both rod and cone photoreceptors. Microspectrophotometry showed that juvenile lungfish possess four types of
single cone photoreceptor with visual pigments maximally sensitive to ultraviolet (UVS, λmax 366 nm), short(SWS, λmax 479 nm), medium- (MWS, λmax 558 nm) and
long-wavelengths (LWS, λmax 623 nm; Table 1 and Fig.
2A) and, therefore, have the potential for tetrachromatic
colour vision. UVS cones are the only photoreceptor type
not found in the retina of the adult lungfish. The retinae
of both juveniles and adults also contain a single type of
MWS rod (λmax 540 nm). We did not observe double

bandwidth and the fit of the absorbance spectra to visual
pigment templates [22], all visual pigments are considered to be porphyropsins (visual pigments utilising the
vitamin A2-based chromophore, 3,4-didehydroretinal), as
is typical of other freshwater fish [23].

The inner segments of UVS and SWS cones contain one or
more colourless oil droplets with minimal absorbance

Spectral
Spectral characteristics of retinal photoreceptors and ocular media in juvenile and adult Australian lungfish
(Neoceratodus forsteri). (A) Normalized absorbance spectra of cone photoreceptor visual pigments. UVS, SWS, MWS and
LWS refer to the pigments found in the ultraviolet-, short-, medium- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones, which have wavelengths of maximum absorbance (λmax) at 366, 479, 558 and 623 nm, respectively. The absorbance spectrum of the rod pigment (λmax 540 nm) is not shown. All pigments are found in juvenile lungfish (j), but the UVS cones are absent from adults (a).
(B) Absorptance spectra of intracellular organelles and spectral filters. R, E and C refer to the red oil droplets, yellow ellipsoid
pigment and colourless oil droplets in the LWS, MWS and SWS/UVS cones (spectra pooled), respectively. The absorptance
spectrum of the yellow paraboloid pigment in the MWS cones of adult Neoceratodus (not shown) is almost identical to that of
the ellipsoidal pigment in juveniles. (C) Normalized transmittance spectra of the combined ocular media (lens, cornea, etc.) of
adult and juvenile lungfish. Note the increased absorption of shorter wavelength light by the ocular media of the adult. (D) Calculated quantal spectral sensitivities of the 4 cone types in juveniles and 3 cone types in adults, taking into account the spectral

soid of the LWS cones and absorbs all wavelengths below
560 nm. Calculations of spectral sensitivity, taking into
consideration the filtering effect of the coloured intracellular spectral filters (Fig. 2B) and the ocular media (Fig.
2C), reveal peak sensitivities for the four cones in juvenile
lungfish at 379 nm, 484 nm, 568 nm and 634 nm (Fig.
2D). In adult lungfish, increased absorption of short

wavelengths by the ellipsoidal (and paraboloidal) pigments in the MWS cones and the red oil droplet in the
LWS cones shifts the peak sensitivities of these photoreceptors to 584 nm and 656 nm, respectively (Fig. 2D). To
the best of our knowledge, the calculated peak sensitivity
of the adult lungfish LWS cone is the most long-wave-

date.
The spectral transmittance characteristics of the ocular
media of the juvenile and adult lungfish differ considerably, particularly at short wavelengths (Fig. 2C). The ocular
media of the juvenile transmit well across most of the
measured spectrum, but absorb strongly below about 390
nm and block all wavelengths below 300 nm. The ocular
media of the adult eye appear yellow to the human eye
and transmittance decreases gradually as wavelength
decreases; light below 400 nm is absorbed completely.
The effect of spectral filters in lungfish cone
photoreceptors on colour discrimination ability
Assuming that the four cone types in the juveniles and the
three cones types in the adult subserve tetrachromatic and
trichromatic colour vision systems, respectively, we modelled the effect of intracellular spectral filters on the colour
vision abilities of the lungfish. To do this, we estimated
the total number of theoretical surface colours that the visual systems of both adult and juvenile lungfish can discriminate, with and without spectral filters (Table 2). All
surface colours occupy an elementary volume (see Methods) within a mathematical representation of observer
colour space known as an 'object-colour solid' [24]. The
reduction of overlap between adjacent spectral channels
due to the coloured filters is beneficial for colour discrimination, because it increases the volume of object-colour

G and G0 denote the shape factor (essentially volume) of the object
colour solid with and without spectral filters in the cone
photoreceptors, respectively; b is the gross benefit due to the change
in shape of the colour solid and is defined as G/G0; d is the factor
describing the cost of the spectral filters due to increased signal noise.
The overall (net) benefit is given as r = b/d. Discrimination thresholds
are assumed to be limited by noise in receptor channels arising from
fluctuations in the number of absorbed photons, i.e. shot noise under
dim-light conditions. The benefit of spectral filters should be greater
in brighter conditions; for details see Methods and [25]. Because at a
depth of 1.25 m UV light is not present in significant amounts (Fig.
4A), the UV receptor was not used in calculations for the juvenile
lungfish at this depth. The overall benefit to colour discrimination of
the spectral filters in dim light is a factor of about 1.3 and is similar
between juvenile and adults and between different habitat depths.

solid [24,25] (Fig. 3). However, the cost of spectral filtering is an increase in signal noise due to the decreased
quantum catch of the visual pigment.
Calculations made with real habitat irradiance spectra
measured at the surface of the water and also at 1.25 m
depth (Fig. 4A) show that, even in dim light when fluctuations in the number of absorbed quanta (i.e. shot noise)
limit visual performance, the yellow ellipsoidal/paraboloidal pigments and red oil droplet filters should improve
the ability of juvenile and adult lungfish to discriminate
colours by a factor of about 1.3 (Table 2). Although not
modelled here, the improvements to colour vision should
be more prominent in bright light, when noise in the photoreceptor channels is no longer determined by shot noise
[25].
Reflectance spectra from objects of likely behavioural relevance to lungfish, such as macrophytes, rocks, sandy substrate and lungfish body colours (Figs. 4B, C), were
plotted in the trichromatic colour space ('Maxwell triangle') of the adult and the tetrachromatic colour space (colour tetrahedron) of the juvenile (Figs. 5A–D). For both
juvenile and adult lungfish, receptor colour spaces were
calculated with and without the spectral filtering effects of
red oil droplets and yellow ellipsoid/paraboloid pigments. In each case, the colour loci of theoretical monochromatic stimuli, which define the extent of the colour
space, were also plotted at 5 nm intervals across the spectrum. In both age groups, the presence of spectral filters in
the cone photoreceptors displaces the monochromatic
loci towards the vertices and expands the available colour
space. This is analogous to the expansion of the volume of
the object-colour solid shown in Fig. 3. Most of the 'real'
objects (especially some weeds, sand and rock) have relatively low absolute reflectances and/or reflectances that
vary relatively little across the spectrum. Consequently,
these data plot close to the achromatic point at the centre
of the colour space (black star in Figs. 5A–D). Nevertheless, the loci of these real spectra are more widely dispersed (i.e. more easily discriminated) than they
otherwise would be if the lungfish lacked intracellular
spectral filters in the MWS and LWS single cones.
Although these results are largely qualitative (given that
important visual performance parameters, such as behaviourally determined discrimination thresholds for the
lungfish, are not available) the modelling suggests that
the presence of coloured filters has the potential to
improve the colour discrimination ability of both juvenile
and adult lungfish, as is thought to be the case for birds
and turtles [21,25].

tem based on either trichromacy (adults) or tetrachromacy (juveniles). They also show that, by reducing
the overlap of the spectral sensitivities of adjacent spectral
cone types, short-wavelength-absorbing spectral filters in
certain cone types improve colour discrimination ability,
despite the unavoidable reduction in total photon catch.
Previous studies have highlighted the theoretical advantages of retinal spectral filters for colour discrimination in
terrestrial birds and semi-aquatic freshwater turtles
[21,25], but this is the first study to demonstrate the
potential benefits to a purely aquatic animal, even in dim
light where shot noise would limit visual performance. It
is possible that the increase in signal noise due to absorption of light by the coloured filters is partially offset by the
comparatively large diameter of the lungfish's photoreceptor inner and outer segments (Table 1), which would
capture more light than the narrower photoreceptors typically found in the retinas of, for example, teleost fish living in a similar habitat [e.g. [26]]. Similar to Neoceratodus
in this regard is the upstream migrant of the southern
hemisphere lamprey, Geotria australis, which also has relatively large photoreceptors compared to other aquatic
vertebrates and has dense, granular yellow pigmentation
in the ellipsoid region of certain cone types [27].
It remains to be determined whether or not the red cone
oil droplets in lungfish and tetrapods are derived from a
similar structure in a common ancestor. To date, lungfish
are the only truly aquatic animals to have red oil droplets.
Some ray finned (actinopterygian) fish, such as the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus [28], four-eyed fish Anableps anableps [29], sturgeon Acipenser shrenckii [30] and the bowfin
Amia calva [31] have oil droplet-like structures in their
cone ellipsoid region that are either non-pigmented or, in
the case of Anableps, contain a pigment resembling
reduced cytochrome c that absorbs strongly below 450
nm [29]. Amongst the Amphibia, which diverged from
the main vertebrate stock some 30 million years after the
Dipnoi [ca. 360 MYA, [32]], only some frogs (Anura) have
photoreceptor oil droplets. In the green frog, Rana clamitans, the oil droplets are described as "colourless" [33],
although they are reported to have considerable absorption of wavelengths below about 500 nm (and, theoretically, should appear pale yellow). The strawberry poison
frog, Dendrobates pumilio, is a diurnal species and its oil
droplets are truly colourless, having negligible absorption
across the spectrum [34]. In fact, of the extant 'higher' vertebrate taxa, red oil droplets are only found in birds and
turtles. Although red oil droplets are retained in, and presumably useful to, both marine [35] and freshwater turtles [36], the fact that these groups are secondarily aquatic
[37] suggests that either they evolved independently in
terrestrial reptiles, or were lost from the lineage that gave
rise to the amphibians.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/21

The red oil droplets of lungfish LWS cone photoreceptors
resemble closely those of some terrestrial vertebrates and,
therefore, provide circumstantial support for the findings
from molecular genetic studies that lungfishes are more
closely related to the ancestors of the tetrapods than other
extant sarcopterygian fish [e.g. [4]], which lack coloured
oil droplets. However, the considerable plasticity of the
vertebrate visual system requires that we must exercise
caution in making such inferences, as other members of
the Sarcopterygii, such as the ancestors of the coelacanth,
may have lost coloured oil droplets/spectral filters following their divergence from the tetrapod lineage.
There may be other reasons for having yellow and red
spectral filters besides colour vision. These include the
absorption of scattered short-wavelength light, which
would improve visual contrast detection by the MWS and
LWS single cones in the same way that UV-blocking 'haze'
or yellow filters improve contrast in photography [31].
Ultraviolet-absorbing filters may also protect the retina
against damaging short-wavelength light [38]. However,
the presence of a dedicated UVS cone type in the retina of
the juvenile lungfish suggests that ultraviolet wavelengths
are important in lungfish behavioural ecology, at least
during specific lifecycle stages, and that they have strategies to cope with any UV-induced retinal damage.
UVS cones were not found in the retina of the adult lungfish and, although they may have been present in such
low numbers that they were overlooked during the microspectrophotometric study, the greatly increased absorption of short wavelengths by the ocular media of adults,
compared to those of juveniles (Fig. 2C), suggests that the
amount of ultraviolet light reaching the adult retina is relatively very low and that ultraviolet sensitivity may be of
little importance to the adults. Hatchling lungfish are predominantly carnivorous, feeding on worms and small
crustaceans [7]. As their dentition develops, from sharp
cones to crushing molariform tooth plates, their diet
changes to include snails and other molluscs, larger crustaceans and, eventually, considerable amounts of plant
material, such as the macrophyte Vallisneria spiralis [7]. UV
sensitivity may be important to hatchling lungfish that
prey on Daphnia or other planktonic prey; zooplankton
often absorb or scatter UV wavelengths differently to the
surrounding water and this enhancement in visual contrast may be used by predators for initial detection of, or
discrimination between, preferred prey species [39,40].
However, ultraviolet sensitivity does not appear to be
essential for zooplanktivory, at least in certain habitats:
seahorses and pipefish (Sygnathidae) are highly specialised visual zooplanktivores that apparently lack UV visual
pigments and have ocular media that block wavelengths
below 400 nm [41]. Moreover, the juvenile lungfish
examined in this study that were found to have UVS cones

BMC Ecology 2008, 8:21

would probably no longer feed predominantly on planktonic prey.
The apparent loss of UVS cones from the adult lungfish
retina reflects the situation observed in some teleost fishes
that also show ontogenetic shifts in preferred habitat. For
example, surface-feeding juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens) have small single cones containing a 400 nm λmax
visual pigment that are lost entirely from the retinal
mosaic as the fish matures and becomes demersal [39].
Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) also lose their UVS cones (λmax 340–360 nm) during
development [42,43] and, like the lungfish, may revert
from a potentially tetrachromatic colour vision system
based on 4 cone visual pigments as juveniles to a trichromatic system as adults. Ultraviolet light is absorbed rapidly with increasing depth, especially in fresh water ([44],
and see Fig. 4A). Perhaps unsurprisingly, older trout lacking UVS cones tend to live in deeper water than UVS conebearing juveniles [42], an ontogenetic trend reflected in
the behaviour of Neoceratodus [7,17] that may explain the
absence of UVS cones in the adult retina.
At the other end of the spectrum, the peak sensitivity of
the LWS cone (656 nm) in adult Neoceratodus is, to our
knowledge, the most long-wavelength-shifted of any vertebrate photoreceptor studied to date. A shift in spectral
sensitivity towards longer wavelengths may be adaptive
for animals living in nutrient-laden 'green' freshwater
habitats, which are relatively richer in red light compared
to most marine environments [23]. Habitat irradiance
may, at least in part, explain the use of 3,4-didehydroretinal as the visual pigment chromophore in many freshwater fish [45], lampreys [27,46] and also Neoceratodus. This
chromophore creates visual pigments with long-wavelength-shifted λmax compared to the same visual pigment
(opsin) protein when conjugated with 11-cis retinal, and
extends the extreme long wavelength limit of vertebrate
visual pigment λmax (without additional spectral filters)
from about 575 to 625 nm [47,48]. Moreover, taken
together with the peak sensitivity of the MWS cones (584
nm), which is long-wavelength-shifted from the location
of the visual pigment λmax by the yellow ellipsoidal/paraboloidal pigmentation, the enhanced long-wavelength sensitivity of Neoceratodus suggests that the discrimination of
objects differing in their reflectance at long wavelengths is
very important. In this regard, it is interesting to note that
many of the macrophytes, including those (e.g. Vallisneria
spiralis) that lungfish use for food, shelter or spawning [7],
have reflectance spectra that differ predominantly at wavelengths above 500 nm (Fig. 4C); our modelling (Figs. 5A–
D) shows how the red and yellow spectral filters potentially improve the ability of lungfish to discriminate
between these macrophytes visually.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/21

The spectral sensitivity of the rod photoreceptor of Neoceratodus is also shifted considerably towards longer wavelengths, having a visual pigment with a λmax at 540 nm.
This spectral shift is mostly the result of the use of 3,4didehydroretinal rather than 11-cis retinal as the chromophore and is similar to the situation observed in the 3,4didehydroretinal-based rod visual pigments of teleost fish
such as the rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (λmax 540 nm)
[49] and the European perch Perca fluviatilis (λmax 540
nm) [45]. Like Neoceratodus, these fishes often inhabit
green fresh water bodies that are relatively richer in long
wavelengths of light.
The enhanced long-wavelength-sensitivity of the photopic
visual system of Neoceratodus may also play a role in the
assessment of body colouration in conspecifics. Neoceratodus are strongly countershaded (Fig. 1), having an olivegreen to dark brown colouration on the dorsal surface and
a pale underside that varies from light orange to pinkish
red in adults (Fig. 4B). Juveniles are generally lighter in
colour. The pink belly colour is apparently brighter in the
breeding season, particularly in males [7], and the assessment of body colouration may be involved in mate
choice, although this has yet to be investigated behaviourally.

Conclusion
The lungfish has a complex retina with a single type of rod
and either 3 (adults) or 4 (juveniles) cone photoreceptor
types. Some of the cones possess coloured intracellular filters that tune the spectral sensitivity functions of the photoreceptors, enhancing the ability to discriminate between
objects on the basis of colour, including those of ecological significance. In this respect, the visual system of the
lungfish is much more like that of a turtle or a bird than
an amphibian or a fish. The close phylogenetic relationship of the lungfish to the ancestors of the tetrapods, suggests that many of the ocular characteristics seen in extant
terrestrial vertebrates may have evolved in water prior to
the transition onto land.

Methods
Microspectrophotometry of retinal photoreceptors
Two adult lungfish (total length, TL, 105 and 110 cm)
were caught from the Enogerra Reservoir, Queensland,
Australia. Three captive-bred juvenile lungfish (TL 24, 28
and 32 cm) were donated by Prof. Jean Joss of Macquarie
University, Australia. Animals were kept in large freshwater aquaria at the University of Queensland under a 12:12
light:dark cycle and fed a diet of commercial fish food.
Animals were dark-adapted overnight, anaesthetised with
benzocaine (Sigma-Aldrich Inc, St. Louis, MO, USA; predissolved in acetone, dose 50 g l-1) and euthanased by spinal cord transection followed by pithing. All procedures

were approved by the University of Queensland Animal
Ethics Committee.
Eyes were removed under dim red light and all subsequent procedures were conducted under infra-red illumination with the aid of a dissecting microscope fitted with
an infra-red image converter (ElectroViewer Series 7215,
Electrophysics Corporation, Fairfield, NJ, USA). The retina was removed from the eye and placed in physiological
saline [50]. Small pieces of retina (ca. 1 mm2) were dissected away and mounted on a 24 × 60 mm No. 1 glass
coverslip in a drop of physiological saline containing 10%
dextran (MW 282,000; Sigma-Aldrich Inc.). The retina
was gently teased apart using mounted needles and the
preparation covered with a 22 × 22 mm No. 0 glass coverslip. The edges of the top coverslip were sealed with nail
varnish to prevent dehydration and movement of the retinal tissue.
Transverse absorption spectra (330–800 nm) of the inner
and outer segments of retinal photoreceptors were made
using a single-beam, wavelength-scanning, computercontrolled microspectrophotometer described in detail
elsewhere [51,52]. Briefly, a sample scan was made by
aligning the measuring beam of the microspectrophotometer within the photoreceptor and recording the amount
of light transmitted at each wavelength. A baseline scan
was then made of a cell-free area of the preparation adjacent to the photoreceptor and subtracted from the sample
scan to create a 'pre-bleach' spectrum. Outer segments
were bleached for 3 minutes with full spectrum 'white'
light from the monochromator and identical sample and
baseline scans were made to create a 'post-bleach' spectrum. The post-bleach spectrum was subtracted from the
pre-bleach spectrum to generate a difference spectrum.
Spectra were converted to either absorbance (outer segments) or absorptance (inner segments) and analysed as
described elsewhere [22,53-55]. Individual spectra that
satisfied established selection criteria [56,57] were
retained for further analysis.
Spectral transmittance of the ocular media
The spectral transmittance (300–900 nm) of the ocular
media was measured in eyes taken from one of the juvenile and one of the adult lungfish used for microspectrophotometric analysis. In the adult, the cornea and lens
were measured separately and the transmittance spectra
combined. In the juvenile, a portion of the sclera at the
back of the eye directly opposite the pupil was removed
and the ocular media (including aqueous and vitreous
humours) measured in toto. In each case, light from an
Ocean Optics PX-2 Pulse Xenon Lamp (Ocean Optics,
Dunedin, FL, USA) was delivered to the rear of the eye/
lens/cornea using a 1000 μm diameter quartz fibre optic
and transmitted light collected by a 50 μm diameter

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/21

quartz fibre optic connected to an Ocean Optics S2000
spectroradiometer [58]. Transmittance spectra were
smoothed with an 11-nm unweighted running average
and normalized for display.
Environmental light and spectral reflectance of
biologically relevant colours
Downwelling irradiance spectra (300–800 nm) were
measured using an Ocean Optics S2000 spectroradiometer in a typical Neoceratodus habitat: at the entrance to Chinaman's Creek in the Mary River, near Tiaro, Queensland,
at midday on the 3rd October 2003 (near the end of the
dry season). Measurements were made 2 m out from the
riverbank with readings taken at the surface and at various
depths up to 1.25 m, as described elsewhere [52,59].
Water depth in the creek ranged to approximately 3 m.
The water was green to our eyes but of relatively low turbidity. The substrate was mostly mud and sand, with
sparse weed and log cover.

Spectral reflectance measurements (300–800 nm) of
objects of potential biological relevance to Neoceratodus
were made using an S2000 spectrometer, as described previously [60]. Measurements were made from stones, mud,
sand and several macrophytes: Vallisneria spiralis, Nitella
sp., Ceratophyllum demersum and Elodea canadensis taken
from the Brisbane River at College's Crossing, Ipswich,
Queensland, where lungfish are known to spawn (Ann
Kemp, pers. comm.). Reflectance measurements were also
made of the scales on the dorsal surface and two different
areas of the ventral surface (one pink and one orange to
the human eye) of an adult lungfish (TL 110 cm). All
reflectance spectra were measured relative to a white
standard (Spectralon; > 99% reflectance 400–1500 nm;
Labsphere, North Sutton, NH, USA) and were smoothed
with an 11-nm unweighted running average.
Modelling spectral sensitivity, colour discrimination ability
and receptor space
The quantal spectral sensitivity of each cone type in both
juvenile and adult lungfish was calculated as the product
of outer segment axial absorptance, oil droplet or ellipsoidal/paraboloidal pigment axial transmittance and ocular
media transmittance [61]. The photoreceptor dimensions
necessary for these calculations – which correct for the fact
that we measured transverse rather than axial absorptance
– were determined from images of the retina, projected
onto a television screen during the microspectrophotometric experiments, using a calibrate acetate overlay. The
specific absorbance of the visual pigment was 0.014 μm-1.
Spectral sensitivity calculations were also made for the
theoretical case where coloured filters are lacking from the
cone inner segments, for comparison in the modelling of
visual performance described below.

To determine the theoretical visual benefit of spectral filters (oil droplets and ellipsoidal pigments) within the
inner segment of lungfish photoreceptors, we first used
the 'object-colour solid' method of Vorobyev [24,25].
Briefly, a colour can be represented in the visual system of
an observer as a point in n-dimensional colour space,
where n is the number of photoreceptor types involved in
colour vision. All theoretically possible surface colours
occupy a part of that colour space, and together form a
conceptual shape known as an object-colour solid. Each
colour locus within the colour space is surrounded by an
elementary volume containing very similar colours from
which it is indistinguishable. The number of colours that
can be discriminated by a given visual system is defined as
the total number of these elementary volumes contained
within the object-colour solid.
When fluctuations in the number of quanta (photons)
absorbed by the cones determines colour discrimination
thresholds, this elementary volume is proportional to the
product of the square roots of the number of quanta
absorbed by each receptor channel per integration time
and per receptive field [24]. This allows us to calculate the
benefit of spectral filtering independently of the intensity
of ambient light. The overall (net) benefit (r) is given as r
= b/d, where b is the (gross) benefit due to the change in
shape of the object-colour solid and d is the factor describing the cost of the spectral filters due to the increased
noise resulting from reduced transmission of photons to
the visual pigment; b = G/G0, where G and G0 denote the
shape factor of the object colour solid with and without
oil droplets, respectively [24]. In bright light, neural noise
rather then quantum noise sets the threshold for colour
discrimination and, theoretically, the benefit of oil droplets increases as the illumination becomes brighter [25].
The benefit of filtering in bright light can be calculated if
the magnitude of this neural noise in the different receptor channels (i.e. Weber fraction) is known [24]; because
the magnitude of neural noise in Neoceratodus is not
known we do not present the data for bright light illumination. However, for the limiting case of dim light illumination, both the cost and benefit of coloured spectral
filters can be calculated using microspectrophotometric
data alone [25].
We also modelled the cone photoreceptor 'colour space'
of Neoceratodus to investigate the appearance of real,
behaviourally relevant objects found in their environment. While the object-colour solid method allows us to
draw conclusions based on all possible colours and examine the ultimate limits of the lungfish colour vision system, receptor space modelling allows us to address more
ecologically driven questions, such as the ability to discriminate between different types of vegetation and detect
subtle differences in conspecific body colouration.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/21

The calculation of receptor spaces (and their associated
chromaticity diagrams) is described in detail by Kelber et
al. [62]. Briefly, a visual system with n receptors is represented as an n-dimensional receptor space, the co-ordinate axes of which correspond to the relative photon
catches of each cone photoreceptor type. Assuming that
the colour-opponent mechanisms responsible for colour
discrimination in the lungfish retina signal only chromatic (colour) differences between an object and the
background against which it is viewed (a reasonable
assumption for animals with duplex visual systems under
photopic conditions), achromatic (intensity) information
can be disregarded [63]. Receptor space can then be displayed as a chromaticity diagram with n-1 dimensions. In
such a plot, pure excitation of any one cone type is represented by a locus at the relevant vertex; colours that excite
more than one cone type are plotted according to their relative excitation ratios. The end result is a series of points
whose relative distance from each other provides an indication of the likely discriminability of the colours to the
visual system under examination, based on hue alone.
Reflectance spectra of lungfish colours and other relevant
objects, measured relative to a white standard as described
above, were multiplied by the downwelling irradiance
spectrum (habitat light) and then multiplied by the quantal spectral sensitivity of each cone type. The resultant
photon catch for each cone type was then divided by the
sum of the photon catches for all cone types (to give relative photon catch) and plotted on the chromaticity diagram. The modelling was performed for both the juvenile
and adult lungfish visual system, with and without the filtering effect of the coloured intracellular filters taken into
account. Because there are no measurements of photoreceptor channel noise (Weber fractions) in lungfishes, we
were unable to quantify the physiological relevance of any
changes in colour distances.
