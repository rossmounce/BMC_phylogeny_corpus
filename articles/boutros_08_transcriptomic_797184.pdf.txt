Abstract
Background: Mouse and rat models are mainstays in pharmacology, toxicology and drug
development – but differences between strains and between species complicate data interpretation
and application to human health. Dioxin-like polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons represent a
major class of environmentally and economically relevant toxicants. In mammals dioxin exposure
leads to a broad spectrum of adverse affects, including hepatotoxicity of varying severity. Several
studies have shown that dioxins extensively alter hepatic mRNA levels. Surprisingly, though,
analysis of a limited portion of the transcriptome revealed that rat and mouse responses diverge
greatly (Boverhof et al. Toxicol Sci 94:398–416, 2006).
Results: We employed oligonucleotide arrays to compare the response of 8,125 rat and mouse
orthologs. We confirmed that there is limited inter-species overlap in dioxin-responsive genes.
Rat-specific and mouse-specific genes are enriched for specific functional groups which differ
between species, conceivably accounting for species-specificities in liver histopathology. While no
evidence for the involvement of copy-number variation was found, extensive inter-species variation
in the transcriptional-regulatory network was identified; Nr2f1 and Fos emerged as candidates to
explain species-specific and species-independent responses, respectively.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that a small core of genes is responsible for mediating the similar
features of dioxin hepatotoxicity in rats and mice but non-overlapping pathways are simultaneously
at play to result in distinctive histopathological outcomes. The extreme divergence between mouse
and rat transcriptomic responses appears to reflect divergent transcriptional-regulatory networks.
Taken together, these data suggest that both rat and mouse models should be used to screen the
acute hepatotoxic effects of drugs and toxic compounds.

Background
In laboratory animals the environmental contaminant,
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, "dioxin")
causes a wide variety of toxic effects, even at extraordinarily low levels of exposure (reviewed in: [1]), leading to
concern about potential harm to health of humans
exposed to these agents [2].
All major toxic effects of TCDD and related halogenated
aromatic hydrocarbons appear to be mediated by a soluble protein, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) [3,4].
The AHR resides quiescent in the cytoplasm in a multicomponent complex until ligand-binding [5], which triggers a conformational change that leads to nuclear translocation. Once in the nucleus, the AHR and its
heterodimerization partner, ARNT, can function either as
a transcription-factor [6], a coactivator [7,8], or potentially as an E3 ubiquitin ligase [9]. As a transcription-factor, the AHR binds to a cognate response element termed
the AHRE-I (Aryl Hydrocarbon Response Element I) [10].
As a coactivator, the AHR interacts with other DNA binding proteins including the estrogen receptor [8,11], Sp1
[12], and other uncharacterized transcription-factors [7].
Despite a fairly detailed molecular understanding of the
manner in which the AHR regulates expression of genes,
such as those encoding CYP1A enzymes [13], the linkage
between the AHR molecular mechanism and biological
manifestations of TCDD-induced toxicity remain, with
few exceptions [14-16], elusive. The primary difficulty is
that the AHR regulates – either directly or indirectly –
hundreds of genes, often in tissue-specific patterns [1724]. Many groups, including our own, have sought to
associate specific genes with specific toxicologic outcomes
by using intra-species models, where different strains vary
in their sensitivity to TCDD (reviewed in [2] and [25]).
However, these intra-species models are confounded by
the extensive strain-to-strain variability observed in both
mice [26] and rats (Boutros et al. submitted). Further, generating model systems where animals vary in sensitivity is
a difficult problem lacking a general solution.
These challenges of intra-species models are not exclusive
to TCDD but are common to the study of all drugs and
toxicants in model organisms. One alternative approach is
to compare the response to a drug or toxicant between
closely-related species. For example, because mice and rats
show largely similar phenotypic responses to TCDD one
might hypothesize that transcriptional responses will be
conserved. To test this hypothesis, Boverhof and coworkers compared the changes in mRNA abundance induced
by TCDD in C57BL/6 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats using
custom cDNA arrays [27]. They tested 3,087 orthologous
genes and found only 33 that responded to TCDD in both
species. This set of conserved, species-independent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/419

responses represents only 15.1% of rat genes and 12.8%
of mouse genes that respond to TCDD. Thus approximately 85% of responses to TCDD are species-specific.
This has major implications for the use of mouse and rat
as model organisms to study toxic responses, making it
important to evaluate and extend this finding. We analyzed the transcriptional response to TCDD in TCDD-sensitive strains of mouse (C57BL/6) and rat (Long-Evans
[Turku/AB]; L-E) using commercial oligonucleotide arrays.
Our arrays contained 8,125 orthologous genes, allowing
us to analyze a much larger portion of the transcriptome
than the previous study. We confirmed that a very small
fraction of TCDD-responsive genes show conserved patterns in mouse and rat liver, and that these represent specific GO categories. Further, we performed library-based
and de novo transcription-factor binding-site analyses to
rationalize the patterns of expression. Finally we validated
our results with a gene-by-gene comparison to a public
dataset.

Results
We used mRNA expression microarray analysis to study
the transcriptional response to TCDD in young adult male
C57BL/6 mice and L-E rats. Eleven mice were used, five
treated with corn-oil vehicle and six treated with 1000 μg/
kg TCDD for 19 hours [28]. Eight rats were used, four
treated with corn-oil vehicle and four treated with 100 μg/
kg of TCDD for 19 hours. For both C57BL/6 mice [29,30]
and L-E rats [31] the respective TCDD doses given in this
study are about 5-fold higher than the single-dose LD50
values for male animals (Pohjanvirta et al. in preparation). At the 19-hour exposure time, we expect that most
responses are likely to represent primary events although
some early morphological manifestations of hepatic toxicity emerge within one day, at least in mice [27]. RNA
extracted from each animal was hybridized to an oligonucleotide array. All microarray data have been deposited in
the GEO repository (accessions GSE10769 and
GSE10770). We carefully validated array quality; none
were excluded (Additional file 1).
Overall Transcriptional Response to TCDD
We first analyzed the rat and mouse data separately. The
arrays from each species were pre-processed independently and subjected to ProbeSet-wise linear modeling. Following a multiple-testing correction, we identified
extensive responses to TCDD in both species (Figure 1A).
The MOE430-2 array used for the mouse studies contains
45,101 ProbeSets while the RAE230A array used for the
rat experiments contains only 15,293. This difference may
contribute to the larger apparent transcriptional response
in mouse relative to rat (Figure 1A). Complete gene lists
are available (Additional files 2 and 3).

The induction of phase-I enzymes in response to TCDD
treatment is well-characterized [2] so we hypothesized
that more genes would induced by exposure to TCDD
than would be repressed. To test this we plotted the fraction of differentially-expressed genes that were induced as
a function of the threshold (Figure 1B). At stringent pvalue thresholds (padjusted < 10-3) both species exhibited primarily inductive responses. At less stringent
thresholds, however, the rat showed similar amounts of
induction and repression whereas the mouse response
remained predominately induction (Figure 1B).
Next, we selected those genes that are most variable in
each species and subjected them to pattern-recognition
analysis [32]. This unsupervised analysis perfectly separated treated from control animals for both rats (Figure
1C) and mice (Figure 1D), indicating that the largest trend
in the dataset is the differential response to TCDD, not
inter-individual variability.
Conserved Transcriptional Responses to TCDD
To control for the different sizes and contents of the rat
and mouse microarrays used in this study we performed
an ortholog mapping. We used build 58 of the Homologene database to identify orthologous genes based on
their Entrez Gene IDs. For each ortholog pair we selected
a single representative ProbeSet. We tested four independent ProbeSet-selection techniques: maximum mean signal, maximum absolute fold-change, minimum p-value,
and a Probe-to-Gene mapping that remapped all Probes
on the array into ProbeSets corresponding to distinct Entrez Gene IDs [33]. Because all four methods yielded similar results (Additional file 4) all downstream analyses
focused on ProbeSets aggregated using the minimum pvalue method.

In total 8,125 orthologous genes were represented on
both microarray platforms (Additional file 5). Of these
only 33 exhibited statistically significant (padjusted < 0.01)
changes in response to TCDD in both species (Table 1).
Further, 3 of these 33 genes (Ccbl1, Fmo1, and Tpm1)
showed divergent responses – they were induced in one
species and repressed in the other. The remaining 30
genes form a common "core" of species-independent
responses to TCDD and include many of the best-characterized TCDD-inducible genes, such as Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2,
Cyp1b1, Nqo1 and Tiparp. Some genes, despite being
altered in both species, showed responses of divergent
magnitude. For example, Inmt was repressed 2.3-fold in
mouse liver, but 48.5-fold in rat liver. Pmm1 was induced
23.6-fold in mouse liver, but only 3.1-fold in rat liver.
These divergences may reflect, in part, differences in the
basal mRNA levels across species, but specialized microarray platforms are required to evaluate this [34].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/419

To assess if the direction of response to TCDD was conserved across species we plotted the fold-changes of the rat
and mouse orthologs against one another (Figure 2A).
The fold-changes are moderately but statistically significantly correlated (Spearman's rho = 0.32, p < 2.2 × 10-16),
suggesting that orthologs respond similarly in the two
species. This result is independent of the padjusted threshold
of 0.01 used (Additional file 1).
To corroborate this finding we again exploited machinelearning techniques. We extracted the GCRMA-pre-processed signal intensities for orthologous genes showing evidence for differential expression (padjusted < 0.01) in either
species. To normalize signal across species we employed
gene-wise median-centering and root-mean-square-scaling. The normalized matrices were then merged gene-wise
and subjected to divisive hierarchical clustering (Figure
2B). The six TCDD-treated mice (red) and four TCDDtreated rats (pink) cluster separately from the five control
mice (dark blue) and four control rats (light blue). This
demonstrates that a core response to TCDD is conserved
across species. These results are independent of the significance threshold employed (Additional file 1). Scaling
genes within each species is critical: if this normalization
step is omitted (Additional file 1) or is performed after the
two species are aggregated (Additional file 1) artefacts
caused by the different microarrays used for each species
predominate over the transcriptomic response.
Divergent Transcriptional Responses to TCDD
Boverhof and coworkers found that 15.1% of rat genes
and 12.8% of mouse genes that respond to TCDD show
conserved responses [27]. Having constructed a list of 33
conserved responses to TCDD (Table 1), we asked if the
low-level of conservation observed in the Boverhof et al.
study would be replicated in a larger fraction of the transcriptome (8,125 orthologous genes in our study compared to 3,087 in the Boverhof analysis). Additionally,
while we kept the mouse strain constant, we considered LE rather than Sprague-Dawley rats: it has been established
that different rat strains show large basal differences in
their transcriptomes (Boutros PC et al., submitted).

After surveying a large portion of the transcriptome we
confirmed that only a fraction of TCDD-responses are
conserved between mouse and rat (Figure 3A). Of the 278
genes that respond to TCDD in the mouse 10.8% are
altered in the same direction in the rat. Of the 200 genes
that respond to TCDD in the rat 15.0% are altered in the
same direction in the mouse. Importantly these results are
based on an analysis of only those 8,125 orthologous
genes whose mRNA abundances were assayed in both species. These findings are independent of the p-value threshold selected (Additional file 1).

Following pre-processing, a linear-modeling approach was used to identify ProbeSets associated with TCDD response in each species. ProbeSets
were mapped to Entrez Gene IDs using the Affymetrix annotation (version na24). Orthologous genes were identified using the Homologene
database (build 58). This table lists genes that display statistically significant (padjusted < 0.01) changes in mRNA abundance in both species. The Mvalues represent the magnitude of difference in expression caused by TCDD exposure in log2 space. For example, Cyp1a1 has an M-value of 11.1 in
rat, indicating 2,194-fold induction in response to TCDD treatment

Given the weak correlation between changes in mRNA
abundance in the two species (Figure 2A), we tested the
possibility that the differences in gene-identities result
from differences in statistical significance and thus represent artefacts of threshold selection. For example, genes
that are TCDD-responsive in mouse might tend to show
higher inter-animal variability in the rat, leading to the
observed lack of overlap. We plotted the adjusted p-values
for each gene on a log-scale (Figure 3B). No positive correlation was observed, disproving the hypothesis of
threshold selection bias and suggesting that differences
are caused by other factors. Indeed, a strongly negative
correlation between p-values in the two species was calculated (Spearman's rho = -0.60, p < 2.2 × 10-16) indicating

that genes that respond to TCDD in one species are less
likely to respond in the other than predicted by chance
alone. Again, this finding is independent of the padjusted
parameter selected (Additional file 1)
Functional Analysis of TCDD-Responsive Genes
The above analyses identified large numbers of genes
whose hepatic mRNA levels are altered by exposure to
TCDD in a species-dependent manner, far more than are
in a species-independent manner. Mice and rats exhibit
mostly similar toxic outcomes to TCDD exposure,
although they show some distinct morphological features
in the liver (discussed further below). This could result
from at least three mechanisms. First, aspects of hepato-

Figure 2 (see Rat and Mouse
Correlation of previous page) Responses to TCDD
Correlation of Rat and Mouse Responses to TCDD. To assess the variability of the response to TCDD between mice
and rats we took the pre-processed and linearly-modeled data and selected all ProbeSets with evidence for differential mRNA
abundances (padjusted < 0.01) in at least one species. We mapped homologs between the two species using the Homologene
database. A) To determine if genes showed similar trends in their profiles we plotted the fold-change in log2 space (M-values)
for all homologs. The two profiles are well-correlated (Spearman's rho = 0.32, p < 2.2 × 10-16), showing similar trends. B) To
determine if these similarities were the strongest pattern within the dataset we selected all genes with evidence for TCDDinduced changes in mRNA abundance (padjusted < 0.01 in one or both species) and selected the pre-processed values for all animals in both species. These values were then median-centered and root-mean-square-scaled separately within species before
being subjected to divisive hierarchical clustering using the DIANA algorithm. The rat (pink) and mouse (red) TCDD animals
cluster together, separately from the rat (light blue) and mouse (dark blue) controls. This unsupervised clustering suggests that
species differences are less prominent than conserved TCDD-induced changes in mRNA abundances.

toxicity common to both species may be mediated by the
small "core" of species-independent responses. Second,
toxicity might not be mediated by any of the mRNA
changes in the liver. Third, toxicity might be mediated by
different genes in each species, but these genes may ultimately lead to dysregulation of a common set of pathways, thereby leading to phenotypic similarities.

Gene-Wise Differences in Rat and Mouse Responses to
Gene-Wise Differences in Rat and Mouse Responses
to TCDD. A) The specific identity of genes showing TCDDinduced changes in mRNA abundances diverges significantly
between rats and mice. Only 33 genes are found altered in
both species and, of these, 3 are altered in different directions. Thus only 15% of rat responses (30/200) and 10.8% of
mouse responses (30/278) to TCDD are conserved in
homologs from the other species. B) To test if genes with
strong evidence (low p-values) for differential expression in
one species would have similarly strong evidence (low p-values) in the other we plotted the adjusted p-values for the
two species in log10 space. Surprisingly these values are
strongly anti-correlated (Spearman's rho = -0.60, p < 2.2 ×
10-16), suggesting that genes that have strong evidence for differential expression in one species are generally likely to
have weak or no evidence in the other.

To test this third possibility, we studied the functional
enrichment of genes that respond to TCDD in mice-only,
in rats-only, or in both species using gene ontology analysis [35]. We identified the GO terms most significantly
enriched in each group based on their false-discovery rate.
Selected conditions are shown in Table 2 and the complete dataset is in Additional file 6. Several GO categories
were strongly enriched in species-independent responders, including microsomal localization, electron transport, and unfolded protein response. One term,
oxidoreductase activity, was enriched in all three groups.
This indicates that a common core set of genes with oxidoreductase activity is dysregulated by TCDD in both species, with additional dysregulation of mouse- and ratspecific oxidoreductases. Finally, several species-specific
pathways were identified, including mouse-specific dysregulation of translation (as previously identified [28]).
Overall only one functional group met our initial criteria
of showing regulation in both species through different
gene sets – lipid metabolic processes.
Genomic Localization of TCDD-Responsive Genes
Having demonstrated large-scale differences between the
rat and mouse transcriptional responses to TCDD and
having shown that these differences lead to alterations in
specific pathways, we next considered mechanism. One
obvious mechanism for differences in mRNA expression
is changes in gene dosage. Indeed many mRNA expression
studies, including those of untreated rat liver, have found
localized domains or "islands" of differential expression
(Boutros PC et al., submitted). We assessed the genomic
localization of species-specific and species-independent
responses to TCDD in both species. No large regions or

Genes differentially expressed in each species were selected at padjusted < 0.01 using linear-modeling analysis. The set of genes whose mRNA levels
were altered by TCDD in only mice, only rats, or in both species were separately subjected to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to identify
specific pathways or functions modulated. A selection of enriched GO terms is shown. The numeric values are false-discovery rates estimated by
1,000 permutations of the input data. Only a subset of GO categories is shown. Bold text indicates those categories significant at a 10% falsediscovery rate.

enriched for the Nr2f1 (COUP-TF1) binding-site in
mouse, but depleted for it in rat. Only one motif, Fos, was
enriched in the species-independent genes in both rat and
mouse but not in any of the other datasets.

Transcriptional Regulation of TCDD-Responsive Genes
Another mechanism that might underlie differences in the
transcriptional response to TCDD between mouse and rat
is the differential activity of one or more regulatory genes.
Alterations in the activities of a small number of regulatory genes, such as transcription factors, could lead to the
large number of mRNA differences observed between species. One way to find evidence for differential transcription factor activities is to use transcription-factor bindingsite (TFBS) enrichment analysis [36]. We searched the promoter regions of rat-specific, mouse-specific and common-responders for enrichment using the JASPAR library
of TFBSs [37]. These searches were performed using both
the rat and mouse promoters in an effort to understand
species-differences in promoter architecture.

To help visualize and rationalize this divergence we
employed unsupervised machine-learning. We selected all
motifs that were enriched or depleted in at least two of the
six datasets and set the p-values to 0.5 for all not-significant values. When the resulting matrix was clustered (Figure 5A) a clear separation between the mouse and rat
promoters was revealed. Rather than clustering according
to TCDD-responsiveness, the data clustered according to
the species of origin. This strongly suggests that speciesspecific regulatory differences predominate, in agreement
with the divergent transcriptional profiles observed.

Sixty separate TFBS motifs were enriched in at least one of
the six datasets searched (Additional file 7). For example,
the p53 binding-site is enriched in the mouse promoter
regions of all TCDD-responsive genes, regardless of
whether or not those genes responded in the rat. Surprisingly neither the three AHRE-I variants nor the AHRE-II
motif exhibited enrichment in any of the six datasets.
Instead the anomalous Cyp1b1 complex identified in
mouse was found to be enriched in the promoters of the
mouse orthologs of rat-specific genes [38]. Visual inspection did not reveal significant similarity between the
mouse and rat orthologs; indeed in some cases they
showed divergent trends: species-independent genes were

While TFBS enrichment analyses can rationalize expression profiles, they are limited by the size and scope of the
underlying TFBS library. Because only a small fraction of
transcription factors have been analyzed in sufficient
detail to have a position-weight matrix generated, a large
fraction of regulatory genes are necessarily omitted. To
complement this approach we thus chose to use a second
technique: pattern-discovery analyses.
Pattern discovery algorithms search for recurrent motifs
within sequences. To identify novel sequence motifs associated with species-dependent and species-independent
responses to TCDD we employed the well-established
MotifSampler algorithm [39] to identify novel motifs
associated with each group of genes. This analysis identified a series of novel motifs putatively associated with the
response to TCDD (Additional file 8). Two of these

previous work [27]. To directly compare the specific genes
detected in the two studies, we performed a gene-by-gene
comparison. We first focused on the 32 genes identified
by Boverhof and coworkers as responding to TCDD in
both species and mapped them to our dataset using
mouse Entrez Gene IDs (Figure 6A). Four of the 32 genes
could not be mapped. We assessed the TCDD response of
the remaining 28 genes in our dataset: 8 were TCDD
responsive in both species, 8 were TCDD responsive in
one species, and 12 were unresponsive. In total, 57% (16/
28) of the genes previously identified by Boverhof et al.
responded to TCDD in our dataset in at least one species.
We next replicated this analysis by looking at the list of
rat-specific (Figure 6B) and mouse-specific (Figure 6C)
genes identified in the Boverhof study. In each of the species-specific datasets we see greater overlap between the
Boverhof findings and those reported here for the same
study. For example, 225 genes were identified as responding to TCDD in mice only in the Boverhof study. Of these,
19 responded in our mouse analysis but only 4 in our rat
analysis. Notably, more genes showed TCDD responsiveness in only one of the two studies than did in both studies.

Analysis 5 Transcription-Factor Binding-Sites
Analysis of Transcription-Factor Binding-Sites. To
rationalize the observed patterns of species-dependent and
species-independent expression we performed two separate
transcription-factor binding-site analyses. A) We employed a
library-based position-weight matrix enrichment analysis
using the JASPAR library and the clover algorithm. We separately tested rat (rows with yellow boxes) and mouse (rows
with blue boxes) promoter sequences from rat-specific,
mouse-specific, and common genes. Thus the first row indicates the analysis of the promoter sequences of the rat
orthologs of genes displaying mouse-specific TCDD expression. Each column represents a separate position-weight
matrix, and only matrices enriched or depleted in at least
two datasets are included. The colour bar indicates the pvalue based on 10,000 randomizations. B) and C) We also
performed de novo motif discovery using the MotifSampler
algorithm. Two matrices enriched in genes showing speciesindependent responses to TCDD were converted into
sequence logos and are displayed here. Neither sequence
appears to match a known transcription-factor binding-site.

Reasoning that many differences between the two studies
might reflect the different statistical methodologies and
numbers of animals, we next compared the magnitude of
TCDD responses for the 28 mapped genes that showed
species-independent responses (Figure 6D). The resulting
plots are highly correlated for both mouse and rat, indicating that indeed the two array studies generated highly
similar results.

motifs, derived from the promoters of species-independent genes, are shown as sequence logos in Figure 5B. Neither of these motifs appears to match the affinities of any
currently known transcription-factor.

We exploited oligonucleotide arrays that contain 8,125
ortholog pairs – 2.6-fold more than previously studied.
We used a single dose, chosen to represent approximately
equivalent multiples of the individual species' LD50 values. We assessed expression after 19 hours of TCDD exposure. The selected dose should be sufficient to eventually
induce all major overt toxicities of TCDD and the selected
time-point should be early enough to allow us to focus on

Discussion and conclusion
The goal of this study was to compare and contrast the
transcriptional response to TCDD in two closely-related
rodent species, the rat and the mouse. Because these are
the two most commonly used model organisms in pharmacology and toxicology, large divergences in their
response to particular compounds is of broad interest.
Previous work using cDNA microarrays containing 3,087
orthologous genes found that, while hundreds of genes
responded to TCDD, only a small core of 10–20% was
common to both species [27]. We sought to evaluate and
extend these findings.

Comparison With Previously Published Data
Comparison With Previously Published Data. We compared our findings with those of Boverhof and co-workers by
performing a gene-by-gene comparison. Responsive genes were identified in our dataset as those having padjusted < 0.05. A)
First, we looked at the 32 genes that responded to TCDD in both species in the Boverhof et al. study and assessed their
response in our dataset. Four genes could not be mapped to homologs on arrays, while 57% (16/28) genes responded to
TCDD in one or two species in our study. We then repeated this analysis looking at the rat-specific (B) and mouse-specific (C)
genes identified in the Boverhof study. In total 24 of the 185 rat-specific genes and 31 of the 225 mouse-specific genes could
not be mapped to the 8,125 ortholog pairs present on our oligonucleotide arrays. Next we mapped the specific fold-changes
observed in the two studies for both species (D). Highly similar patterns were observed for both mouse (Spearman's rho =
0.83, p = 4.4 × 10-8) and rat (Spearman's rho = 0.88, p = 1.06 × 10-9).

primary responses rather than on the secondary manifestations of toxicity. We further broadened the mouse/rat
comparison by using the highly TCDD-sensitive L-E
strain, whereas the Boverhof study analyzed SpragueDawley rats.
We found that responses to TCDD are moderately correlated between the two species (Figure 2A), suggesting a
broad trend towards similar responses. Further, a novel
bi-species clustering approach shows in an unsupervised
and unbiased way that the strongest signal within the
dataset is the response to TCDD, not the difference
between species (Figure 2B). We also show that hundreds
of genes respond to TCDD in each species (Figure 1A), but
only a small core of 10–20% was common to both – corroborating the findings of Boverhof and coworkers (Figure 3A).
This core set of species-independent TCDD-responsive
genes contains many well-characterized genes, including
Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, Nqo1, and Tiparp – all of
which have been previously detected in high-throughput
studies [27,28,40]. However, several species-independent
genes have not previously been well-characterized for
their response to TCDD but have functions that may be
related to the clearance of xenobiotics. For example: indolethylamine N-methyltransferase is an enzyme that methylates indoles such as tryptamine, tagging them for
degradation; cysteine conjugate-beta lyase metabolizes
cysteine conjugates of alkanes and alkenes. Gene ontology
analysis shows that the species-independent genes are
enriched for microsomal genes, genes involved in the
unfolded protein response, and genes involved in ERnuclear signalling.
The 30 genes showing concordant responses to TCDD in
rat and mouse represent prime candidates for explaining
TCDD-induced hepatotoxicities. However, these toxicities
might result in at least three other ways. First, toxicities
may arise from events outside the liver and thus be independent of changes in hepatic mRNA levels. Indeed, it has
been shown that hematopoietic cells contribute to the
hepatic lesions caused by TCDD [41]. Second, if toxicities
arise from a cell-type present at a low frequency in the
liver rather than from hepatocytes, relevant mRNA
changes may be below the threshold of detection of our
platform. For example, the Kupffer cells appear to play a
central role in the hepatic response to many toxic and carcinogenic agents [42] and the Ito (stellate) cells are
responsible for retinoid storage and metabolism in liver
[43], a target for TCDD action [44]. Third, toxicities may
arise by perturbation of common pathway through different genes in each species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/419

Testing the first two hypotheses will require the use of tissue-specific transgenic animals and are thus beyond the
scope of this study. To test the idea that toxicity results
from the dysregulation of a pathway common to mouse
and rat we used gene-ontology enrichment analysis. We
searched for dysregulated functional groups in the lists of
rat-specific and mouse-specific genes and found only one
pathway dysregulated in both species – cellular lipid
metabolism. Because this minimal overlap could occur by
chance alone, and with caveats regarding tissue-specificity
and transcriptome-coverage, it appears likely that the
genes mediating TCDD-induced toxicity are amongst
those reported in Table 1. While these species-independent genes appear skewed towards up-regulation, it is not
clear that highly up-regulated genes are mediators of
hepatic toxicities. For example, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are
both highly induced in the liver of TCDD-resistant Han/
Wistar (Kuopio) rats [25]. CYP1A1 can modulate some of
the hepatotoxic effects of TCDD, as shown by lack of
hepatocyte hypertrophy and uroporphyria in Cyp1a1-/mice [45], but induction of CYP1A enzymes is not, in
itself, sufficient to cause hepatotoxicity.
It would be of interest to repeat our analysis using expression profiles collected 96 to 240 hours after TCDD exposure, when overt toxicities are manifest. At these later
time-points it would no longer be possible to discern primary from secondary events, but instead there would be
an increased ability to contrast the final toxic pathways
perturbed in each species.
While about 15% of TCDD-responsive genes are speciesindependent and thus potentially mediate TCDD toxicities, the roles of the remaining 85% of genes are intriguing
to consider. There are two key questions. First, does
altered expression of these genes have functional consequences? Second, what mechanisms mediate species-specific responses?
If the species-independent genes had no functional consequence we might expect them to be randomly distributed
across different functional classes. Instead, gene-ontology
enrichment analysis (Table 2) shows that they represent
specific responses. In particular, the formation and function of ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in translation is significantly dysregulated in mice but not in rats. In
our study of AHR-knockout mice we showed that this
effect is AHR-dependent [28] and suggested that it may
mediate some TCDD-toxicities. Because this effect is
absent in the rat, this pathway may contribute to degenerative changes induced by TCDD that are more prominent
in mouse liver relative to rat liver.
The vast majority of TCDD toxicities are common to both
species, but some species-specific differences do exist. For

Page 12 of 17

example, multinucleated giant hepatocytes occur only in
rats, while hydropic degeneration, fat accumulation,
inflammatory cell infiltration as well as apoptosis and
necrosis are more pronounced in mice [27,40,41,46-48].
We selected our TCDD dose to reflect approximately
equal multiples of the LD50 values for each species to
ensure that a similar ultimate phenotype was being considered. Nevertheless it is possible that the type of hepatic
injury is species-specific and that this leads to the
observed differences in transcript profiles. Several lines of
evidence suggest against this possibility, including the
evolutionary proximity of rat and mouse, the similar
responses of known TCDD-responsive genes, and the
inter-species similarity of the vast majority of morphological changes. Further work will be needed to clarify
between these two situations.
Many different mechanisms can be proposed to explain
the large species-specific responses observed, including
copy-number variation, differences in transcription-factor
binding affinities, and differential transcription-factor
activities. We did not find evidence that copy-number variation plays a role (Figure 4), so we focused on the potential role of transcription-factors in species-specific
responses.
It has been established that transcription-factor binding is
poorly correlated with changes in mRNA expression [49].
Further, when the transcriptional regulatory networks
were compared between human and mouse liver, they
were found to differ dramatically [50]. To determine
whether specific transcription-factors are associated with
the species-specific responses we performed two separate
analyses of transcription-factor binding-site motifs. First
we used a library-based enrichment analysis [51] with a
database of 130 known motifs that we supplemented with
5 AHR-associated motifs [37]. Because the majority of
sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins do not have
known binding-site motifs, we complemented this analysis with an unsupervised analysis using the MotifSampler
pattern-discovery algorithm [39].
Our library-based analysis identified numerous motifs
enriched in both species-dependent and species-independent manners, some clearly associated to the biology
of dioxin-toxicity. For example, the enrichment of p53
motifs in mouse promoters suggests that a p53-dependent
apoptotic response was initiated in mouse, but not in rat.
Apoptosis is a common sequela to TCDD exposure in
mouse liver [41,47] and, while it also occurs in rats, it
appears less frequent [52]. One motif, Nr2f1 (COUP-TF1)
showed divergent enrichment between the promoters of
mouse and rat that responded similarly to TCDD. The
AHR has been shown to directly bind COUP-TF1 in
human cells [53]. When we consider the overall patterns

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/419

of TFBS-enrichment in an unbiased manner using unsupervised machine-learning, however, we found that species-specificity was the dominant trend. This suggests that
the transcriptional regulatory networks are sufficiently
diverged in mouse and rat as to make non-phylogenetic
motif analysis highly challenging [50].
MotifSampler is a variant of Gibbs sampling that introduces a higher-order Markov background model and
incorporates a Bayesian mechanism to estimate the missing value: the number of motifs occurring in each
sequence [39]. MotifSampler was applied here to six different promoter datasets to successfully identify novel
motifs. Biochemical analyses are required to demonstrate
the functionality of these motifs, especially in the absence
of an appropriate validation dataset, but the success of
this analysis suggests that significant components of the
AHR transcriptional network remain to be elucidated.
We directly compared our results to those of Boverhof and
coworkers at the gene- level (Figure 6). This is important
because the two studies differed in animal handling, timepoints, strain of rat used, gender and age of animals, array
platforms employed, and statistical methodologies.
Despite all these differences Spearman's correlations
above 0.8 were observed between the two studies for both
mouse and rat – an outstanding concordance. However,
despite this correlation it is notable that the majority of
genes identified as TCDD-responsive were found in only
one of the two studies. This provides a cautionary note to
the use of toxicogenomics for high-throughput testing,
and stands in contrast to the optimistic findings of the
MAQC study [54,55].
Thus we have shown that most TCDD-responsive genes
are species-specific and that the small core of species-independent genes shares both common functions and common transcriptional-regulatory elements. Taken together
these data suggest that the vast majority of dioxin-responsive genes play no direct role in the toxic responses.
Rather, it may be that a small number of regulatory genes
under direct AHR control lead to dramatic inter-species
differences. It would be highly advantageous to further
refine the list of genes associated with dioxin-toxicities by
profiling the transcriptional response of additional strains
of mouse and rat, or by exploiting additional rodent species.
This study has significant implications for the use of
rodent models to understand mechanisms of pharmacological or toxicological compounds. If transcriptional
responses have been extensively remodelled in rat and
mouse since their last common ancestor then hepatic
expression studies may yield contradictory and speciesspecific results. It may be necessary to test both species

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:419

and focus on the subset of overlapping genes. An optimal
study design might include several strains of mice and several strains of rat, thereby focusing the list of transcriptional responses to a small number that exhibit both
intra- and inter-species homogeneity and are thus highly
likely to be directly involved in the phenotypic effects of
the compound under investigation.

Methods
Animal Handling
Rats
The Long-Evans (Turku/AB) (LE) strain of rat was selected
for these analyses because it harbours a wild-type Aryl
Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) and is the most TCDD-sensitive rat strain reported, with an acute LD50 of 9.6
(females) or 17.7 (males) μg/kg [1]. Male animals, 10–12
weeks of age, were grown in breeding colonies of the
National Public Health Institute, Division of Environmental Health, Kuopio, Finland. All animals were males
10–12 weeks old. They were housed in groups of 4 rats
(an entire treatment group per cage) in suspended stainless-steel wire-mesh cages with pelleted R36 feed
(Lactamin, Stockholm, Sweden) and tap water available
ad libitum. The temperature in the animal room was 21 ±
1°C, relative humidity 50 ± 10%, and lighting cycle 12/12
hours light/dark. The study plans were approved by the
Animal Experiment Committee of the University of Kuopio and the Kuopio Provincial Government. Liver was
harvested between 8:30 and 11:00 from rats treated by
gavage with a single 100 μg/kg dose of TCDD or with corn
oil vehicle for 19 hours. Four control (corn-oil treated)
and four experimental (TCDD-treated) rats were used in
this study.
Mice
Wildtype (Ahr+/+) C57BL/6 mice harbouring wild-type
AHR alleles were bred at the National Public Health Institute, Kuopio, Finland from stock originally obtained from
The Jackson Laboratory. At 15 weeks of age mice were
given a single dose of 1000 μg/kg TCDD or corn oil vehicle by gavage. TCDD initially was dissolved in ether and
added to corn oil; the ether subsequently was evaporated
off. Liver was harvested 19 hours after treatment, sliced,
snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until homogenization. Five control (corn-oil treated) and six experimental (TCDD-treated) mice were used in this study.

TCDD for both experiments was purchased from the UFAOil Institute (Ufa, Russia) and was >99% pure as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
Total RNA was extracted from both rat and mouse livers
using Qiagen RNeasy kits according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada). Total RNA
yield was quantified by UV spectrophotometry and RNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/419

integrity was verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
Pre-Processing and Statistical Analysis of Microarray Data
Affymetrix RAE230A and MOE430-2 arrays were run
according to manufacturer's protocols at The Centre for
Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children
(Toronto, Canada). Four independent biological replicates (individual rats) were analyzed for each condition (8
total arrays), while five control and six treated mice were
analyzed (11 total arrays). The raw array data have been
deposited into the GEO repository with accessions
GSE10769 (mouse) and GSE10770 (rat).

Microarray data were loaded into the R statistical environment (v2.6.2) using the affy package (v1.16.0) [56]. These
data were pre-processed using the GC-RMA version of the
RMA pre-processing algorithm [57], as implemented in
the gcrma package (v2.10.0). Data were investigated for
spatial and distributional homogeneity. The mouse data
are part of a study of AHR-/- animals described elsewhere
[28], but were pre-processed separately for this study to
avoid introducing bias by including AHR-/- mice in the
quantile-normalization step of pre-processing. The data
for control rats have been analyzed separately elsewhere
(Boutros et al. submitted), while the data from TCDDtreated rats have not. Again, pre-processing was performed separately for this study to avoid introducing bias.
All clustering analyses employed divisive hierarchical
clustering using the DIANA algorithm as implemented in
the cluster package (v1.11.10) and with Pearson's correlation as a similarity metric. Heatmaps were visualized
using the lattice (v0.17-6) and latticeExtra (v0.3-1) packages. Subsets for clustering were selected using global variance thresholds. When both species were clustered
together, scaling was performed separately for the mouse
and the rat arrays to ensure that probe, normalization or
loading differences did not bias the analysis.
ProbeSet Annotation and Homolog Identification
To identify TCDD-induced changes in mRNA abundance
model-based t-tests were fit using the limma software
package (v2.12.0) and subjected to an empirical Bayes
moderation of the standard error [58]. P-values from this
analysis were corrected for multiple testing with a falsediscovery rate adjustment [59]. We set our significance
threshold at padjusted < 0.01 for most downstream analyses.
At this level we would expect no more than 1% of our hits
to be false-positives. We also considered the p-value sensitivity of the overall analysis by varying the threshold
from 10-1 to 10-7 in log steps and calculating the number
of differentially-expressed ProbeSets at each threshold.

Genes were annotated with version na24 of the Affymetrix
NetAffx annotation http://www.affymetrix.com. Genomic
localization of TCDD-responsive genes was performed
using the geneplotter (v1.16.0), annotate (v1.16.1),
mouse4302 (v2.0.1) and rae230a (v2.0.1) packages, all in
version 2.6.2 of the R statistical environment.
Homologs were mapped between the two arrays using the
Homologene database (build 58). Genes were mapped
according to Entrez Gene ID to Homologene IDs and only
genes present in both species were retained for downstream analyses. When multiple ProbeSets were present
for a single Entrez Gene ID they were collapsed by selecting the ProbeSet with the minimum p-value. We compared this approach to selecting the ProbeSet with the
maximum coefficient or the one with the maximum average signal, and only minor differences were observed
amongst the three strategies. We also contrasted these
three approaches with a sequence-based annotations provided by the custom CDF annotations mapping individual Probes to Entrez Gene IDs, as provided in
BioConductor (v1.9) [33].
Transcription-Factor Binding-Site Analysis
We used a library-based method to search for transcription-factor binding-sites enriched or depleted in specific
gene sets [36]. Using the CLOVER software package [51]
we queried a 2005 version of the JASPAR database containing 130 position-weight matrices [37]. We supplemented the JASPAR matrix with five AHRE-associated
motifs as previously tested using phylogenetic footprinting [60]. To ensure that our results were robust, three separate permutation tests were used. We employed simple
mononucleotide and dinucleotide randomization. Additionally, a background dataset containing the promoters
of all 8,125 genes present on both arrays was generated
and used. For each permutation test 10,000 randomizations were performed with a p-value threshold of 0.05 and
a score threshold of 5. Only motifs significantly enriched
or depleted in all three tests are reported. Genomic
sequences from -1,000 to +1,000 relative to the transcriptional-start site were used, for sequences with a total
length of 2,001 bp. These sequences were extracted from
build rn4 of the rat genome and build mm8 of the mouse
genome using annotation from the UCSC genome
browser database downloaded on 2007-04-07 [61]. We
separately tested the promoters in both species for motif
enrichment in genes common to both species, genes specific to mouse, and genes specific to rat, leading to six total
comparisons.

These same comparisons were also made using a patterndiscovery algorithm, MotifSampler [39]. First, the promoter regions for all orthologous pairs included in our
expression array analyses were extracted from the genome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/419

for each species, as described above. Next, a third-order
background model was generated for each species from all
promoter regions by using the background-generator program provided with MotifSampler. Next, each dataset was
analyzed at three pattern-lengths – 6, 8, and 10 bp – and
at each length the analysis was repeated twice with the five
highest scoring motifs retained from each run. Thus we
analyzed three datasets, each in two species, and each
dataset was analyzed at three pattern lengths. For each pattern-length ten motifs were generated, leading to a total of
180 novel motifs generated in this pattern-discovery analysis.
Unsupervised machine-learning was performed as
described above, using divisive hierarchical clustering
through the DIANA algorithm as implemented in the
cluster package (v1.11.10) and with Pearson's correlation
as a similarity metric. Heatmaps were visualized using the
lattice (v0.17-6) and latticeExtra (v0.3-1) packages.
Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis
Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the
GOMiner tool [35]. Analysis was done using all mouse
databases, look-up options, ontologies, and evidence levels. False-discovery rates were estimated with 1,000 randomizations and a 10% FDR threshold was set.

Authors' contributions
PCB performed most bioinformatic and all statistical
analyses and wrote the first draft of the paper. RY performed the motif-discovery analyses. ABO and RP guided
the study design. All authors contributed to the study
design and provided input into the final manuscript.
