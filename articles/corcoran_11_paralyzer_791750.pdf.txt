Abstract
Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) protocols have made it possible to identify transcriptome-wide RNAprotein interaction sites. In particular, PAR-CLIP utilizes a photoactivatable nucleoside for more efficient crosslinking.
We present an approach, centered on the novel PARalyzer tool, for mapping high-confidence sites from PAR-CLIP
deep-sequencing data. We show that PARalyzer delineates sites with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Motif finding
identifies the sequence preferences of RNA-binding proteins, as well as seed-matches for highly expressed
microRNAs when profiling Argonaute proteins. Our study describes tailored analytical methods and provides
guidelines for future efforts to utilize high-throughput sequencing in RNA biology. PARalyzer is available at http://

Background
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in the
life cycle of a transcript, from its nascence by RNA polymerase until its decay by RNases. All steps of RNA processing and function, including splicing, nuclear export,
localization, stability, and small RNA-mediated regulation,
are controlled by different RBPs and ribonucleoproteins
[1]. The identification of which RBPs or ribonucleoproteins interact with which transcripts, how they interact,
and where the interaction occurs, has been the focus of
many studies. Recent advancements in high-throughput
genomic technologies have resulted in profiles of transcriptome-wide RNA-protein interactions in vivo. Two of
the most established methods for the investigation of
these interactions are RIP-Chip [2] or RIP-seq [3,4] and
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) [5]. RIPChip was the first method to use immunoprecipitation to
identify RNA targets bound by specific RBPs at genomewide scale [6]. Associated mRNAs are isolated, and then
quantified using mRNA arrays or, more recently, subjected
to high-throughput sequencing. This allows for the identification of all transcripts targeted by a particular RBP,
but not for direct identification of where, or how many,

RNA-protein interactions occur within a transcript. The
second method, CLIP, typically uses short wave UV
254 nm crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation and
partial RNase digestion of the bound transcript. Conversion of the residual RNA segments into cDNA libraries
and characterization by high-throughput sequencing yields
small size windows in which the RNA-protein crosslinking
occurred.
PAR-CLIP (photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) is a powerful modification of the CLIP technology for the isolation of protein-bound RNA segments [7]. Cells are first cultured with
a photoreactive ribonucleoside analogue, typically 4thiouridine (4SU), to boost RNA-protein crosslinking.
This is followed by high-throughput sequencing of cDNAs
generated from the crosslinked immunopurified RNA
fragments. During cDNA generation, preferential base
pairing of the 4SU crosslink product to a guanine instead
of an adenine results in a thymine (T) to cytosine (C) transition in the PCR-amplified sequence, serving as a diagnostic mutation at the site of contact. The pattern of T =
> C conversions, coupled with read density, can thus provide a strong signal to generate a high-resolution map of
confident RNA-protein interaction sites.
Here we present a new strategy specific for analysis of
PAR-CLIP data to generate a transcriptome-wide highresolution map of RNA-protein interaction sites. Our
new method, dubbed PARalyzer, is designed to exploit

the T = > C conversions introduced by the PAR-CLIP
technology to generate high-resolution interaction sites
that contain RBP binding sites with a strong signal-tonoise ratio. Combining PARalyzer interaction site identification with the motif-finding algorithm cERMIT [8],
which is tailored to the analysis of high-throughput
quantitative genomic data, reliably identifies the enriched
common sequence patterns. Together, these two steps
can be used to elucidate the transcriptome-wide set of
RBP-mRNA interaction sites as well as the preferential
binding motifs of the factors. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach on four published datasets, and provide guidelines and strategies for the analysis of future
PAR-CLIP datasets. Both of these stand-alone commandline tools are available online [9].

Results
PAR-CLIP datasets

We focused our analysis on human PAR-CLIP datasets
described in Hafner et al. [7], which profile the targets of
four distinct mRNA-interacting factors. Three of the
datasets were generated from immunoprecipitation data
of the sequence-specific RBPs Quaking (QKI), Pumilio2
(PUM2), and Insulin-like growth factor 2 binding protein
1 (IGF2BP1). While QKI is a well-studied splicing factor
in the nucleus [10], Pumilio RBPs are involved in mRNA
stability and translation in the cytoplasm [11]. The functions of Pumilio are widely studied in a variety of species,
and its global RNA targeting properties has been examined across a large phylogeny [12-17]. IGF2BP1 belongs
to a family of proteins that are able to regulate translation
by their direct binding to target mRNAs [18].
The fourth dataset consists of pooled libraries assaying
members of the Argonaute (AGO) family of RBPs, central
components of the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC), which directs microRNAs (miRNAs) to their target transcripts, thereby negatively impacting gene expression [19]. Different from the other RBPs, Argonaute
members do not have a specific mRNA recognition site;
rather, their targets are specified by the interaction of the
miRNA in RISC with partially complementary sequences
in the target mRNAs [19]. The seed region of the miRNA
is regarded as the important sequence determinant in target mRNA interactions [20]. AGO crosslinking is currently
a popular method to directly identify miRNA targets, but
the libraries contain a mixture of all targets of those miRNAs expressed in a particular cellular context.
Evaluating datasets for proteins with known sequence
preferences allowed us to compare the interaction sites
identified by PARalyzer with baseline methods, in terms of
the presence of putative binding motifs normalized to the
total size of the identified interaction sites. Initial analysis of
PAR-CLIP data revealed that interaction sites of different
proteins exhibit particular patterns of T = > C conversions,

likely reflecting the accessibility of nucleotides in the RNA
bound by the protein. Therefore, conversions do not have
to include all thymines of a sequence motif equally, and
may not even fall directly on top of conserved motifs at the
interaction sites. Most notably, miRNA seed matches were
observed to be largely devoid of T = > C conversions, and
conversions were predominantly located directly upstream
of the seed match.
Methodology overview

T = > C conversion events that occur at the site of RNAprotein crosslinking can be used to identify the actual RBP
interactions at high resolution, and subsequently, which
sequence motifs are found at or close to these interaction
sites. We have developed a toolkit that employs a nonparametric kernel-density estimate classifier, PARalyzer
(PAR-CLIP data analyzer), to identify the RNA-protein
interaction sites from a combination of T = > C conversions and read density. In a second step, PARalyzer interaction sites can be provided to de novo motif finders to
elucidate sequence preferences; we adapted our recently
published cERMIT algorithm for this task, and for the
analysis of AGO libraries as an important special case.
PARalyzer

Reads are first aligned to the genome, and those overlapping by at least a single nucleotide are grouped together.
To exploit available read data in an effective way, we utilize relatively lenient alignment parameters. We allow
reads to be as short as 13 nucleotides after adapter stripping, and a read may contain up to 2 mismatches
restricted to T = > C conversions (in comparison, the analysis by Hafner et al. [7] used a read length of at least 20
nucleotides, and allowed for one T = > C mismatch).
Within each read-group, PARalyzer generates two
smoothened kernel density estimates, one for T = > C
transitions and one for non-transition events. Nucleotides
within the read groups that maintain a minimum read
depth, and where the likelihood of T = > C conversion is
higher than non-conversion, are considered interaction
sites.
Initial interaction sites are extended either to encompass the full underlying reads that contain a conversion
event or by a generic window size (an example for the
PUM2 dataset can be seen in Figure 1). The choice
between these methods is dependent on the crosslinking
properties of the analyzed RBP. For example, extending
the region by five nucleotides on each side efficiently captures PUM2 binding sites, where crosslinking occurs
directly at the motif. In contrast, when assaying the Argonaute protein family in which the miRNA-mRNA interaction site is protected from both digestion and T = > C
conversion events, extending the region based on the
underlying reads will include the location of conversion

as well as the bound site, that is, the miRNA seed
matches (Figure 2).
Motif finding

When sequence preferences are known, PARalyzer interaction sites can be examined for matches to the binding
motif of the assayed factor. However, the majority of RBPs
do not have known binding motifs. Furthermore, only a
subset of miRNAs are expressed in any given cell type and
available to be incorporated into the RISC. For the purposes of motif finding, current PAR-CLIP datasets fall into
two distinct scenarios: (1) ‘single binding motif analysis’ in
the case of sequence-specific RBPs (for example, QKI,
PUM2, IFG2BP1); and (2) ‘multiple motif analysis’ in the
special case of miRNA-mediated AGO-RNA crosslinking.
For the single binding motif analysis we apply the conserved Evidence Ranked Motif Identification Tool (cERMIT) [8], which was designed for de novo motif discovery
based on high-throughput binding data (for example,
ChIP-seq) and has been shown to exhibit highly competitive performance in the context of transcription factor
binding site discovery [8]. There are two essential components of the motif discovery algorithm implemented by
cERMIT: an enrichment function to score evidence of
binding for a given sequence motif represented as a k-mer
over the alphabet of IUPAC symbols ‘A, C, G, U, W, K, R,
Y, S, M, N’; and a search strategy that explores the motif
space for high-scoring motifs. cERMIT differs from most
other motif identification tools by making use of the complete quantitative evidence for a genome-wide set of regulatory regions. Rather than identifying a motif
overrepresented in a pre-specified number of top candidate sequences, cERMIT ranks all putative target regions
based on their binding evidence and identifies sequence

motifs of flexible length that are highly enriched in targets
with high binding evidence.
cERMIT is based on the assumption that evidence was
available for an input set of potential regulatory target
regions, independent of a specific analyzed factor (for
example, all upstream regions for small genomes such
as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or regions of open chromatin in higher eukaryotes). Here, the regions to be evaluated are the PARalyzer interaction sites that are
assigned evidence of RBP crosslinking. The binding evidence for PARalyzer-generated interaction sites is
reflected in the number of observed (log2-transformed)
T = > C conversions. In the data analyzed here, the
number of observed T = > C conversions correlated
well with the total number of reads (Additional file 1),
which suggested that the motif finding strategy can also
be applied to CLIP-seq datasets [5] by using the (log2
transformed) number of reads as binding evidence for
each interaction site.
In the context of multiple motif analysis of AGO data
sets we take advantage of the well-established mechanism
of miRNA-based gene regulation [20,21], which is largely
based on the 5’ complementarity of miRNAs to target
mRNA transcripts. Instead of performing a de novo motif
search, the microRNA Enrichment Analysis Tool (mEAT)
thus limits the search to a pre-specified seed list of known
miRNAs, for example, as defined in miRBase [22]. In particular, we represent each miRNA by a short list of canonical end seed types: 8 mer-A1, 8 mer-m1, 7 mer-A1, 7
mer-m1, 7 mer-m8, 6 mer2-7, and 6 mer3-8. By rephrasing the original motif scoring within a classical linear
regression framework, we can additionally allow for flexible and easily extensible accounting of biases unrelated to

miRNA mediated AGO-mRNA interaction, such as
sequence composition or interaction site size.
Delineation of individual binding sites for sequencespecific RNA-binding proteins

After applying PARalyzer to the four PAR-CLIP datasets
described above, we observed that most of the interaction
sites fell in the genomic regions expected for each of the
different factors (Figure 3). The majority of Argonaute
interaction sites were found in 3’ UTRs, the region known
to contain functional targets of the miRNA-associated
RISC [19]. Similarly, the largest number of interaction
sites was found in 3’ UTRs for both Pumilio2 and
IGF2BP1. Pumilio2 is a known regulator of mRNA translation and stability, which is facilitated by its binding to
target gene 3’ UTRs (reviewed in [17]). IFG2BP1, though
less studied than Pumilio2, has also been shown to

Page 5 of 16

regulate translation and stability by binding either the 3’
UTR or 5’ UTR of its target genes [18,23]. In contrast, the
majority of interaction sites found for Quaking, a known
splicing regulator, were found in intronic regions [10].
A previously described baseline approach for the identification of interaction sites used groups of overlapping
reads that contained at least a single T = > C conversion
event [7], with more confident interaction sites being
defined as those with higher numbers of T = > C conversion events. Reads had to be at least 20 nucleotides long,
and contain at most one mismatch corresponding to a T =
> C conversion. Our more lenient mapping parameters
generally led to a larger number of initial read groups for
each of the RBPs, but the number of interaction sites
remained approximately the same for each dataset at a
required read depth of 5. For the PUM2 dataset, we
applied PARalyzer with the parameter option that

extended the interaction sites by five nucleotides on each
side of the positive signal. A comparison of the PUM2
results showed a 33% increase in the signal-to-noise ratio
for the PARalyzer method (Table 1). Had we used the
baseline parameter option of extending the interaction
sites based on the underlying reads, we would have still
seen a 20% increase in the signal-to-noise ratio. PARalyzer
identified approximately the same number of motif
instances, but interaction sites contain 29% fewer
nucleotides.
The current biases of the PAR-CLIP protocol (notably,
the identity of the single photoactivatable nucleoside, as
well as the endonuclease used for digestion), and the particular biochemistry of protein-RNA interactions place
some constraints on the PARalyzer method. In available
datasets, a good example is the QKI motif, where the preferred crosslinking occurs at the second nucleotide from
the 5’ end of the motif; when that nucleotide is a ‘U’,
crosslinking occurs at a very high frequency; when it is a
‘C’, however, we cannot observe this event (Figure 2b).
Use of a different photoactivatable nucleoside would
likely result in the capture of this particular variation of
the binding motif. Another good example is the identified
IGF2BP1 motif ‘CWUU’, for which there is no dominant
conversion event within or at a close, consistent distance
to the binding motif (Figure 2d). In these particular
cases, the uridines that are found within the preferred
binding motif are protected from crosslinking, or show
no particular likelihood of crosslinking over the background. When situations like this arise, interaction sites

cannot be tightened beyond the extend-by-read option;
the best choice is to identify regions of crosslinking and
then extend the interaction site based upon the underlying reads that showed at least one conversion. In the case
of Quaking, our mapping strategy in combination with
PARalyzer results in the identification of 16% more sites
at a cost of 5% signal-to-noise. In contrast, we identify
only about half the number of IGF2BP1 motif instances
that are found in the Hafner et al. [7] study, but at a signal above the expected background (Table 1).
While we limited our signal-to-noise analysis to interaction sites that were located on protein coding genes, it did
not go unnoticed that there were many sites that fell
within intergenic regions in each of the datasets (Figure 3).
Analysis of intergenic interaction sites that met the same
stringency cutoffs used above revealed that the number of
motif matches per nucleotide is only slightly lower than
for those sites that fall within known transcripts for both
PUM2 and IGF2BP1, while not being as high for QKI or
AGO (Additional file 2). This suggests that the PAR-CLIP
libraries contain reliable RBP-mRNA interactions in currently unanotated, possibly non-coding transcripts.
Even though we employed a more lenient mapping
strategy than the initial study, we still only mapped
approximately 28% of the reads in each of the libraries to
the genome. By relaxing mapping parameters further,
and allowing up to three mismatches not necessarily limited to T = > C conversions, we find that a large number
of the additional interaction sites generated are located in
repeat regions of the genome. This includes short and

The Argonaute results are specific to only the 3’ UTR region and contain only non-redundant seed matches. Summary of the motif matches for Pumilio2 (PUM2),
Quaking (QKI), and Insulin-like growth factor 2 binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) were generated from the analysis of the full transcript of all genes, including 5’ UTRs,
3’ UTRs, introns and coding regions. The Hafner et al. [7] crosslink-centered regions (CCRs) are those provided in their manuscript.

long nuclear elements as well as other non-coding RNAbased families, suggesting nonspecific pull-down of
highly abundant non-coding RNAs. A smaller fraction of
these interaction sites contain preferred sequence motifs,
and requiring of multiple T = > C conversion locations
results in the elimination of many of these regions from
subsequent analysis (Additional file 3).
Overall, the PARalyzer method resulted in significant
improvements. First, the size of the interaction site tends
to be much smaller and therefore identifies sites at higher
resolution (Figure 4a). Second, this approach can identify
multiple sites within the same group of overlapping reads.
Finally, our interaction sites never extend to regions that
have zero read depth, as can be the case when selecting
fixed-size windows around sites with observed conversion
events. The simple approach of grouping reads leads to a
strong influence of protocol (size selection) and/or
sequencing technology (reliable read length), both of
which should ideally not influence the identification of
sites. The lenient short-read mapping in combination with
PARalyzer thus provides a more comprehensive and
higher resolution map of protein-RNA interaction sites.
The method is easily adjustable when additional knowledge is available for the particular conversion pattern of
an RBP. In any case, requiring at least two T = > C conversions in a read group is a strong indicator of the presence of binding for any RBP, even when lacking
conversion directly at the consensus motif, possibly indicative of general non-site-specific interactions for stabilization of the RNA-protein interaction. This observation
demonstrates the advantage of PAR-CLIP over other
crosslinking protocols: even if conversions are not directly
at the motif, they help to provide signal over noise.
Examination of miRNA interaction sites

Different from sequence-specific RBPs, the baseline
approach for the identification of Argonaute interaction
sites in the PAR-CLIP study performed by Hafner et al.
[7] was to use crosslink-centered regions (CCRs). CCRs
are 41-nucleotide windows re-centered on the initial read
group location that has the highest percentage of T = > C
conversion events. A recent follow-up study suggested
that CCRs could be used for all RBPs [24]. The 3’ UTR is
the specific region on a transcript where miRNA interactions have been shown to have the most significant impact
on gene regulation [21,25]. Using PARalyzer, the signal-tonoise ratio of miRNA binding sites across 3’ UTRs of
genes known to be expressed in HEK293 cells was
increased in the top expressed miRNAs (Table 1; Figure
4c); this ratio fell below the background level for miRNAs
with very low or no expression in these samples (Figure
4d). A similar signal-to-noise ratio for seed-matches to the
highly expressed miRNAs was observed for interaction
sites within coding regions (Additional file 4). In contrast,

Page 7 of 16

the CCRs reported by Hafner et al. [7] led to lower signalto-noise for highly expressed miRNAs, and remained close
to the background level for lowly expressed miRNAs, indicating that the presence of seed motifs for these miRNAs
was simply due to random matches in larger CCRs. This
demonstrates that our method indeed created a higher
resolution map of miRNA binding sites. Furthermore,
conserved and putatively functional miRNA seeds have
been reported to be located near the beginning of the 3’
UTR and near poly-adenylation sites [26-28], and this pattern was confirmed for PAR-CLIP-derived binding sites
(Figure 4b).
To examine crosslinking and conversion levels in more
detail, we identified miRNA seed-matches for each of the
top 20 expressed miRNAs within reads restricted to 3’
UTRs or coding regions. Stratifying the interaction sites
by canonical seed-match type resulted in the identification of distinct patterns of T = > C conversions (Figure
2a). For 8-mer and 7-mer matches, the highest likelihood
of conversion fell one nucleotide upstream of the seedmatch. The likelihood of a conversion event occurring
within the seed-match tended to be at or below the background conversion rate. This confirmed previous observations that the miRNA-mRNA base pairing prevents
crosslinking between the protein and any 4SU on the
mRNA within the seed region, and that conversions largely fall just outside the seed region where Argonaute
proteins are in close proximity to the single-stranded target mRNA molecule. Contrary to 8- and 7-mer matches,
conversion events were more likely to occur within
6-mer seed matches than the surrounding area. These
trends were also observed in seed matches identified in
reads that map to coding regions (Additional file 4).
While 6-mer matches are more likely to occur by chance,
and some might be non-functional even when located in
PAR-CLIP interaction sites, these differences may reflect
structural transitions that are induced by more extensive
seed pairing [29], altering the protein conformation and
RNA crosslinking efficiency.
Several studies have pointed out that the nucleotide
composition surrounding a miRNA binding site plays a
role in that site’s effectiveness to regulate the target gene
[26,30], and in agreement, we observed that the nucleotides
immediately adjacent to any type of seed match in 3’ UTRs
were AU rich (Figure 2a). While the overall AU content
was high in 3’ UTRs, it was lower in sites present in coding
regions (Additional file 5), and normalizing for AU content
of the different genomic regions reduced the effect. Interestingly, binding sites for the other RBPs (QKI, PUM2 and
IGF2BP1) also occurred within AU-rich regions, with an
under-representation of guanines surrounding the interaction sites. The latter may be due to the fact that the RNase
T1 enzyme, used in the preparation of the analyzed PARCLIP libraries, preferentially cleaves next to Gs. Cleavage

of Gs immediately surrounding the binding sites could
result in short RNA fragments, too short in fact to be
included in the library because of a read size selection step
that specifically collects reads approximately 30 nucleotides
in size. Given that the RBPs studied here protect a region

of 6 to 12 nucleotides, fragments with Gs immediately next
to the site are likely to be too short to pass the size selection step. Alternatively, it is also possible that the high AU
richness of these binding regions is necessary for RBP
accessibility.

Evidenced-ranked de novo motif identification

Hafner et al. [7] successfully applied standard motif discovery approaches (PhyloGibbs [31], MEME [32]) on the
subset of the top 100 most highly confident read-groups
to predict RNA binding preferences. Choosing an arbitrary cutoff is well justified in cases where the targetbinding motif is of low degeneracy and/or long and
hence contains high discriminative signal relative to the
background sequence. When this is not the case, a larger
set of example sequences with the motif occurrence, with
possibly variable binding affinity, can facilitate the search
process.
For the single binding motif analysis we therefore used a
recently developed method, cERMIT [8], which was specifically designed for de novo motif discovery based on highthroughput binding data (for example, ChIP-seq) and
shown to exhibit highly competitive performance in the
context of transcription factor binding site and miRNA
seed discovery [8]. Motif identification on the QKI and
PUM2 datasets was successful in recovering their respective reported consensus binding motifs [7,10,33] (Additional files 6 and 7). The motif for IG2BP1, which had not
previously been identified, was highly similar to the one
reported by Hafner et al. [7] (Additional file 8). For this
analysis, we used all PARalyzer interaction sites mapping
to a genic region not flagged as a repeat.
For the multiple motif analysis on the combined AGO
PAR-CLIP datasets, we took all human miRNAs available
in miRBase v16 as input for mEAT, which adapts cERMIT
to a restricted motif analysis over miRNA seed matches.
Despite starting from all known human miRNAs, our analysis automatically ranked the top expressed miRNAs in
the cell line on the top of the list of predicted enriched
miRNA seed clusters (Table 2). Therefore, this enrichment
analysis can be used to identify those miRNAs with the
strongest impact on mRNA targeting, even in the absence
of miRNA expression information. While the initial PARCLIP study reported that seed matches could explain
about 50% of CCRs, this was based on 6-mer matches to
the top 100 expressed individual miRNAs. As our analysis
above showed, only the matches of the top approximately
60 or so miRNAs provide a signal above background. The
de novo motif analysis here confirms this: the top 5
expressed miRNAs alone can explain approximately 18%
of all targets, but collectively, all 25 significantly enriched
seed match families covered only approximately 30% of
the interaction sites.

Discussion
As with many new short-read deep-sequencing protocols,
the PAR-CLIP approach to elucidate RNA binding sites
enables specific opportunities for in-depth analysis and
interpretation of genomic data. In addition to mapping
sequence-specific RBPs such as PUM2, QKI or IGF2BP1,

Page 9 of 16

an anticipated popular application of this protocol will be
to study binding by members of the RISC, making it possible to identify the joint set of transcriptome-wide
miRNA targets under specific conditions. To address the
challenges posed by these two scenarios, we described
the PARalyzer approach, which uses a kernel density estimate classification to generate a high-resolution map of
RNA-protein interaction sites. In addition, we described
an extension of our previous motif finding algorithm,
cERMIT, to subsequently identify binding motifs for
sequence-specific RBPs or over-represented miRNA seed
matches.
Analysis of the Argonaute datasets showed that miRNA
seed matches allowed for refining several previous findings
on miRNA targeting. As reported, miRNA binding sites
are located within AU-rich regions, but this was limited to
sites in the 3’ UTR; miRNA seed matches found in the
coding regions of genes did not exhibit this nucleotide
bias. While the overall number of interaction sites found
in coding regions was smaller than in 3’ UTRs, the signalto-noise ratio of the identified coding interaction sites
almost reached the levels at seed matches found in 3’
UTRs. The evidence for binding alone obviously does not
imply that these sites have similar functional consequences
to those found within the 3’ UTR. Confirming previous
studies based on sequence or expression, but not direct
binding, miRNAs were most likely to interact with their
targets near the ends of the 3’ UTRs, including alternative
poly-adenylation sites.
A detailed study of sequence-specific RBPs (PUM2, QKI
and IGF2BP1) revealed the strengths and current limitations of the PAR-CLIP protocol, and as a consequence,
methods for the analysis of PAR-CLIP data. PUM2 data
showed a high likelihood of T = > C conversion occurring
directly at the RNA-protein interaction site and within the
conserved binding motif. In such cases, our approach can
identify the true transcriptome-wide interaction sites at
(nearly) single nucleotide resolution. On the other hand,
analysis of QKI data exhibited differences: while the
‘AUUAAY’ binding motif showed strong likelihood of T =
> C conversion at a particular nucleotide in the recognition motif, the ‘ACUAAY’ motif had no specific site where
a conversion event could be detected. In such cases, the
lack of a particular location of conversion prevents single
nucleotide resolution of the interaction site, and at first
glance seems to erase the strengths of PAR-CLIP compared to standard CLIP data. However, requiring T = > C
conversions to occur in the vicinity is still a good method
to enrich for true binding sites: while no particular nucleotide near the binding motif exhibited conversion preferences, it suggested that non-specific, possibly stabilizing
interactions of another component of the RBP with the
RNA molecule gave PAR-CLIP an advantage over other in
vivo RBP-RNA interaction detection protocols.

Clustering is based on highly similar miRNA seeds (third column). Predictions are ordered based on the enrichment scores assigned by the motif analysis
performed using mEAT. For each cluster prediction we report the expression rank (fourth column), the mEAT enrichment score (fifth column), the P-value
estimate based on permuting the binding evidence assignment (100 draws) combined with a parametric fit to a Gaussian distribution (sixth column), the number
of targets that represents the total number of regions with a match to at least one of the canonical seeds of the cluster members (seventh column), and the
cumulative number of targets that corresponds to the union of the predicted targets of the current cluster with all others preceding it (eighth column). miRNAs
that were not reported as expressed in Hafner et al. [7] were assigned ‘NA’ values; some of these are recently identified miRNAs not known at the time of
measuring expression levels.

The different, and in many cases unknown, crosslinking
properties for RBPs presents a challenge for all CLIP protocols, and requires small adjustments as to how to call
and expand interaction sites to ensure the inclusion of the
binding site. In instances of newly studied proteins, for
which the motif or conversion pattern is not known-for
example, the recently analyzed HuR protein [34]-it is thus
best to use PARalyzer with the ‘extend-by-read’ option in
combination with the output of motif finding to determine
if significant top-scoring motifs tend to have specific locations of high conversion. If there is at least one location of
high conversion, as is, for example, the case for PUM2,
then a tighter extension can be used to reduce the size of
the interaction map.
In addition to the RBP-specific sequence affinity preferences, the RBP-RNA interaction has been shown to be
influenced by the secondary structure of the targeted
RNA sequence and has been successfully exploited in
previous work on RBP motif discovery [35-37]. Incorporating information on the RBP structural preferences into
the motif analysis proposed in the current work could be
implemented by means of a prior distribution on the
binding evidence for individual sequence regions inferred
by PARalyzer, biasing the motif discovery towards highscoring sequence patterns that contain favorable
sequence context for RBP binding. This could help filter
out non-specific interactions with highly abundant
mRNAs. In the context of AGO-mediated regulation, a
prior based on the predicted miRNA-mRNA duplex stability could be used in a similar fashion
Due to the use of 4SU nucleoside analogue in the original PAR-CLIP protocol, the ‘U’ content of an actual binding site and its vicinity will obviously impact the
identification of RBP binding sites. If a recognition site
does not contain any uridines, precise delineation using
this approach is compromised; on the other hand, many
U residues may either cause problems with alignment due
to the potential of many mismatches, and/or to spread
out the signal over multiple positions. The current investigations of additional amenable photoactivatable nucleosides [38], complemented by the use of different digestion
enzymes [24], are expected to reduce potential biases, and
can easily be specified in PARalyzer. As such, our pipeline
provides a standardized solution for the analysis of RBP
binding sites via PAR-CLIP, for subsequent motif finding
for sequence-specific RBPs, and for the elucidation
of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and
networks.

Materials and methods
Processing, mapping, and grouping of short-read data

Short read libraries were downloaded from the Short Read
Archive [39] (SRX020777, SRX020781-6). Reads from the
deep sequencing libraries were first stripped of the 3’

Page 11 of 16

adapter sequence using the FASTX toolkit [40]. Reads that
were less than 13 nucleotides in length or contained an
ambiguous nucleotide were discarded. The remaining
reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) by the
Bowtie algorithm [41], with up to two mismatches
allowed. Mapped locations were only reported for the
optimal mismatch-stratum for each read up to a maximum of ten different locations. All T = > C mismatches
between a read and the genomic sequence were subtracted
from the mismatch count at each mapped location. Only
reads that mapped to a single genomic location with no
mismatches after conversion subtraction were used for
further analysis. The location that a read mapped to, relative to a known transcript, was determined based on the
ENSEMBL database (release 57) [42]. If a read mapped to
a location that could be placed in multiple categories, it
was assigned based on the following order of preference:
3’ UTR, coding sequence, 5’ UTR, miRNA, intron, intergenic. Reads that overlapped by at least a single nucleotide
were grouped together to form read groups. The location
of a read group relative to known transcripts was determined in the same way as for individual reads. Original
clusters and CCRs were obtained from Hafner et al. [7]
and converted to hg19 coordinates using the liftover tool
from the UCSC genome browser [43].
Repetitive sequence regions were identified by RepeatMasker [44] and the specific locations were downloaded
from the UCSC genome browser [43]. The following
repeat types were collected for this analysis: low complexity repeat family (low complexity), long interspersed
nuclear elements (LINE), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE), DNA transposons (DNA), RNA repeat
families (RNA), satellite repeat family (Satellite), rolling
circle (RC), unknown repeat family (Unknown), long
terminal repeats (LTR) and other repeats (Other).
Identification of motif matches

Motif matches for PUM2 were identified by a string
search for ‘UGUANAUA’ in all read groups that were
found in 3’ UTRs, 5’ UTRs, coding regions or introns.
Local nucleotide composition around each site was determined by collecting ± 5 nucleotides from each binding
site. The heatmap shown in Figure 2c includes each
motif match, regardless of the number of reads that map
to that particular location. The T = > C conversion graph
associated with the heatmap is based on all reads that
map at or around the motif match, and therefore is not
normalized by the number of reads at any particular position. Motif matches and figures for the QKI and IGF2BP1
proteins (Figure 2b) were prepared in the same way, but
with string searches for the Quaking motifs ‘AUUAAY’
and ‘ACUAAY’, or ‘CAUU’ and ‘CUUU’ for IGF2BP1.
Seed matches for miRNAs in the Argonaute dataset
were collected for non-redundant matches to the top 20

Corcoran et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R79

expressed miRNAs. Expression rank of the miRNAs was
provided in Hafner et al. [7] and was determined by deep
sequencing libraries generated in parallel with the PARCLIP libraries. Seed-matches were identified in order from
longest to shortest, and overlapping seed matches of different length were only included in the analysis of the
longest possible seed match. The preference of seed match
was searched in the following order: 8 mer-m1, 8 mer-A1,
7 mer-m1, 7 mer-A1, 7 mer-m8, 6 mer2-7, 6 mer3-8. 8
mer-m1 is a seed-match between the mRNA and nucleotides 1 to 8 of the miRNA seed sequence, 8 mer-A1
matches nucleotides 2 to 8 of the seed sequence paired
with an A at position 1. 7 mer-1 m and 7 mer-A1 are similarly defined for nucleotides 1 to 7; 7 mer-m8 is a match
utilizing nucleotides 2 to 8 of the seed sequence. 6 mer2-7
is a match utilizing nucleotides 2 to 7 of the seed
sequence, and 6 mer3-8 utilizes nucleotides 3 to 8 of the
sequence. The heatmaps and barplots for the different
seed-match types (Figure 2a) were calculated in the same
manner as those described for PUM2. Sites found to be
targeted by multiple miRNAs in the top 20 expressed were
only included once for the most highly expressed miRNA.
PARalyzer

For each read group that contained at least five reads and
two T = > C conversion locations, a kernel-density-based
classifier was utilized to more precisely delineate the
region of crosslinking (’signal’) versus non-crosslinking
(’background’). The minimum number of five reads was
motivated by the need to reliably estimate the densities,
and can be adjusted to higher numbers in more comprehensive sequence libraries. Class-specific densities were
estimated using a Gaussian kernel density estimator with
globally fixed precision parameter l = 3. The signal-tonoise results are fairly robust to the setting of the bandwidth parameter (Additional file 9).
More formally, for a given read group of length L we
define x(i) and x(i) , i ∈ { 1,...,L} to be the number of
T→T
T→C
observed conversion and non-conversion events, respectively, at an offset i relative to the start, and with a minimum read depth of 5 to be able to estimate conversion
frequencies. The read depth is the number of individual
reads that map to a region overlapping a particular nucleotide. Let nT®T and nT®C be the total number of conversion and non-conversion events in the group. For any
position j Î {1,..., L} we define:

which, after normalization, produces a non-parametric

kT→T (j) =

fT→T (j)
L
j=1 fT→T (j)

Nucleotide positions j for which kT®C(j) > kT®T(j) are
considered to be interaction sites.
Interaction sites derived from the PUM2 read groups
were extended up to five nucleotides in each direction as
long as a minimum read depth of 5 was maintained; sites
that overlapped upon this extension were combined into
a single interaction site. Interaction sites for Argonaute,
QKI and IGF2BP1 were extended in both directions, up
to the most distal end of reads that overlapped the interaction site by at least one nucleotide and had at least a
single T = > C conversion event; extension in either
direction was halted where the read depth fell below the
cutoff of five reads, and interaction sites that overlapped
were joined to a single site. This is considered the
‘extend-by-read’ option. This extension strategy was suitable for the identification of miRNA binding sites
because crosslinking events were observed to occur adjacent to the seed match and not directly at the interaction
site. This approach also worked for QKI and IGF2BP1
factors because the conversions happened near the site,
despite Us within their binding motifs being protected
from crosslinking. We did not believe an interaction site
should be called based on only a single read as done previously; however, PARalyzer maintains a similar signalto-noise ratio when analyzing read-groups that contain at
least five reads, but not necessarily at a depth of 5 at any
one position (Additional file 10). Locations of interaction
sites relative to known transcripts were determined in
the same manner as for individual reads.
Signal-to-noise estimation

Hafner et al. [7] utilized HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays
to determine the expression value for all known genes
in the HEK293 cell line for comparison with their PARCLIP experiments. All probes were assigned to genes
according to ENSEMBL release 57 when possible. The
average value of two biological replicates was used for
each probe. When multiple probes were available for
the same gene, the highest expression value was used
for that particular gene. All genes with expression values
above the 80th percentile of all background probes
(those that were not associated with a gene) were considered expressed.

Signal-to-noise was calculated as the number of sites
per nucleotide in a given set of read-groups, CCRs, or
PARalyzer interaction sites, divided by the sites per
nucleotide in the background set. For PUM2, IGF2BP1
and QKI, the complete gene sequences for all protein
coding genes were used as background set (UTRs, coding sequence and introns as identified in ENSEMBL
release 57 [42]). In instances where multiple isoforms
are known for a specific gene, the sequence for the
longest transcript was used. For the Argonaute miRNA
analysis, we used the sequence of the 3’ UTRs, or separately, the set of all coding regions. For instances where
more than one 3’ UTR was identified for a specific gene,
the sequence for the longest 3’ UTR was used; the same
approach was applied for coding sequences. Signal-tonoise was calculated from only those genes that were
identified as expressed by the microarray analysis.
Alternative 3’ UTRs

Coordinates of experimentally verified 3’ UTRs were
collected from PolyA_DB (version 2) [45] and additionally curated as previously described in Majoros and
Ohler [27]. Genes found in both PolyA_DB and
ENSEMBL release 57 were used in further analysis. Each
3’ UTR was normalized to a length of either 100% or
200%, based on whether the gene had one or two or
more annotated poly-adenylation sites. The midpoint of
the interaction site was used as reference location within
the normalized 3’ UTR.
Evidence-ranked motif identification in PAR-CLIP data

Let si, i Î {1,..., n} be a set of sequence regions (for example, interaction sites or read groups as reported by
PARalyzer) and yi be the corresponding binding evidence
for each region (here, log2[#T = > C]). We define the
candidate set of putative motifs to be mj, j Î {1,...T}. We
typically consider k-mers of length 6 to 10 with a limited
number of degenerate positions, assuming that a motif
has a conserved core of at least three to five nucleotides,
where binding tends to occur. A match of motif m j in
sequence region si is given by the binary indicator variable xij. If we denote the number of motif occurrences in
{si }n by:
i=1

xij , and y =

nj =

where m*
cERMIT denotes the top predicted motif using
the strategy described in Georgiev et al. [8].
Upon re-analysis of a previous benchmark yeast ChIP
dataset [8], we noticed improved prediction accuracy (an
additional approximately 17% of successfully recovered
motifs) by using the full set of 7-mer non-degenerate oligomers (instead of 5-mers) as a starting point for the
cERMIT motif search (improved motif space exploration), and requiring a minimum target set size of 5%
(improved motif score stability), and therefore adopted
these search parameters for all sequence-specific PARCLIP analyses in this study. In addition to an RNA binding profile description in the form of a position-specific
scoring matrix, we report the set of predicted motif
occurrences in decreasing order of binding evidence for
the corresponding sequence region, in order to facilitate
downstream analyses of biological function and potential
regulatory network reconstruction. For visualization,
resulting motifs were represented as logos using the
WebLogo tool [46].
microRNA enrichment analysis

With some notable exceptions, post-transcriptional regulation of miRNAs is largely mediated by sequence
complementarity of the canonical miRNA 5’ seeds to
mRNA transcripts [20,21]. Argonaute pull-down data
generated by PAR-CLIP protocol provides the ensemble
of such targeted transcripts in the cell. To identify
highly abundant mRNA transcripts, complementary to
canonical seeds of known/highly expressed miRNAs, we
implemented a tailored version of cERMIT, mEAT. In
mEAT, we limit the search for enriched functional
sequence motifs to a pre-specified list of known miRNAs-for example, as defined in miRBase-and evaluate
over all those miRNAs instead of a greedy de novo motif
search. When additional information on miRNA expression is known, this list can be further restricted to the
subset of (top) expressed miRNAs. In the spirit of previously published work [47-49], we used a linear regression model for the interaction site binding evidence,
which closely resembles the cERMIT scoring strategy
described above [8].
Let the regression coefficient for motif mj be denoted
as bj, then a simple linear regression model for the binding evidence is:
y* = xij βj + εi , εi ∼ N(0, σ 2 )
i

Using the classical ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator for the regression coefficient:
1
ˆ
βOLS =

nj

n

1[xij = 1] × y∗
i
i=1

Corcoran et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R79
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/8/R79

we define the motif enrichment score to be:
reg

Sj

=

ˆ
βOLS
j
σj
ˆ

=

1
× ScERMIT
j
Aj

which results in the top prediction:
reg

m* = arg max Sj
reg
j∈{ 1,..,T}

In the typical scenario, in which the size of the motif target set is small relative to the number of all sequence
reg
regions (nj < < n), this results in Aj ≈ 1, and Sj ≈ ScERMIT.
j
We extended this basic model to a regression approach in
which the evidence for each interaction site is modeled as
a linear combination of a binary indicator variable for the
presence of a motif, and additional confounder covariates
with some added noise. We here use a single type of confounder, the di-nucleotide counts in each sequence region,
and represent the miRNA by the list of seven canonical
seed types mentioned above. Using this confounder is
motivated by using observed PAR-CLIP interaction sites
as inputs, and allows us to control for the locally higher
AU content around miRNA target sites in 3’ UTRs compared to the overall transcript background.
More generally, consider p confounders and define the
matrix of covariates to be Z j = (x j , c 1 ,...c p ) where x j
denotes the column vector of binary indicators of the jth miRNA seed type, j Î {1,..., 7}, and c k Î ℜ n , k Î
{1,..., p} denote the di-nucleotide counts (hence p = 16),
mean-centered and normalized to have sample standard
deviation of 1. With corresponding regression coefficients bj = (b1j,..., bp+ij)T Î ℜp+1 the linear regression
model for the binding evidence becomes (using matrix
notation):
Y∗ = Zj βj + ε,

ε ∼ N(0, σ In×n )

We estimate the regression coefficients using OLS,
ˆ
βj = ZT Zj
j

−1

ZT Y* , ˆ βj = ∼ σ 2 ZT Zj
ˆ
ˆ
j
j

−1

, which can be

expected to produce stable results in the typical setting
with a large number of clusters. An independent regression model is fit for each miRNA seed type for j Î {1,...,
7}, and the miRNA score is defined as the average score
of all (positively scoring) seed types:
SREG =
j

ˆ
∼ β 1j
(∼ ˆ ∼βj )
ˆ

⇒ SREG =
11

7

REG
j 1[Sj

> 0]

1[SREG > 0] SREG
j
j
j=1

Alternative definitions (for example, maximum score,
sum of scores) and scoring schemes (principal components regression) produced similar results, yet required
additional assumptions (for example, specification of the
number of components, and so on). An additional filtering step helps avoiding inflated miRNA scores due to

random chance. A set of randomized scores is generated
by permuting the binding evidence B (default of 100)
times, with scores SREG(b), b Î {1,..., B} estimated using
OLS. From these scores, we fit an empirical null distribution using a Gaussian parametric model; the observed
miRNA score SREG is considered significant if it is found
to be larger than a user-specified number of standard
deviation relative to the mean of the null distribution
(default of 3 standard deviations). The corresponding
P-value can be used as a guide to the significance of the
reported individual miRNA enrichment scores.
Many of the top scoring miRNAs will have canonical
seeds that are very similar (for example, varying in a single flanking position). As a result, their matches to
mRNA target sequences and resulting enrichment scores
are too similar to be distinctive. For this reason, we add
a post-processing step that clusters miRNAs with highly
similar seeds around ‘cluster centers’ defined to be distinct miRNAs with the highest score that are not part of
an existing cluster. We initialize the clustering procedure by setting the first ‘cluster center’ to be the top
scoring miRNA in the whole set of candidates. When
deciding upon cluster membership, two miRNAs are
considered to be similar to each other if they share a
canonical motif that is at least seven consecutive nucleotides long.
