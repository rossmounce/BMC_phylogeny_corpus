Abstract
Background: Dengue is a major health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. In Colombia,
dengue viruses (DENV) cause about 50,000 cases annually, 10% of which involve Dengue
Haemorrhagic Fever/Dengue Shock Syndrome. The picture is similar in other surrounding
countries in the Americas, with recent outbreaks of severe disease, mostly associated with DENV
serotype 3, strains of the Indian genotype, introduced into the Americas in 1994.
Results: The analysis of the 3'end (224 bp) of the envelope gene from 32 DENV-3 strains recently
recovered in Colombia confirms the circulation of the Indian genotype, and surprisingly the cocirculation of an Asian-Pacific genotype only recently described in the Americas.
Conclusion: These results have important implications for epidemiology and surveillance of
DENV infection in Central and South America. Molecular surveillance of the DENV genotypes
infecting humans could be a very valuable tool for controlling/mitigating the impact of the DENV
infection.

Background
Dengue viruses (DENV) belong to the genus Flavivirus,
transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and constitutes a major
concern in public health, infecting millions of people per
year in tropical and subtropical areas throughout the
world. DENV causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans, ranging from a flu-like illness, known
as Dengue Fever (DF), to the more severe Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome
(DSS).

DENV are enveloped viruses with a positive sense ssRNA
of about 11 kb coding a single open reading frame for
three structural and seven non-structural proteins [1].
Additionally, DENV comprises four distinct serotypes
(DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) and infection
with any of them can produce the most severe manifestations of illness [2].
Although four DENV serotypes can be differentiated by
immunofluorescence, it does not provide information

about epidemiologic origin and phylogenetic relationship
between strains from different geographic regions. In fact,
studies of evolution and molecular epidemiology of
DENV have demonstrated the occurrence of genotype
clusters within each serotype [3-9]. For this reason, genetic
characterization of DENV has become a critical issue for
understanding epidemic patterns of viral spread. The
increase in virus transmission over the last 50 years has
possibly increased its adaptive potential, resulting in more
virulent genotypes which could be associated with DHF/
DSS [10,11].
In Colombia, the four serotypes of DENV have been
involved in epidemics, although DENV-1 and DENV-2
have had the higher circulation rate since 1971. Moreover,
since the time when the first case of DHF was described, at
the end of 1989, these two serotypes have been particularly associated with severe disease. DENV-4 was first
detected in 1984 and since then has been sporadically isolated from mild cases of DF.
On the other hand, DENV-3 was detected in Colombia for
a short time in 1975 and was then thought to have disappeared from the country [12]. Nevertheless, DENV-3 reappeared in Latin America in 1994 in Panama [13], and
over the next six years rapidly spread to Central, South
America and Caribbean countries, causing outbreaks of
DF, particularly in Nicaragua, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela
http://www.paho.org/english/hcp/hct/vbd/
dengue_timeline.xls. DENV-3 was first reported in Venezuela in 1999, and was subsequently detected in Peru and
Ecuador in 2000 and Brazil in 2001. In Colombia, 24
years after it had disappeared, DENV-3 was again detected
in the state of Santander in 2001 [14], and officially
reported by National Health Institute (Instituto Nacional
de Salud, INS, Bogotá, Colombia) in early 2002 in state of
La Guajira. It then dispersed all over the country, especially in those areas where dengue is endemic. Between
2003 and 2005, DENV-3 was the most frequent serotype
reported by the INS. By the year 2006, co-circulation of
DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 was increasingly being
detected, particularly in endemic areas (Mendez JA,
unpublished data).
In order to determine the arrival and dispersal patterns of
DENV-3 in Colombia, a molecular phylogenetic analysis
was done using the 3' region of the envelope (E) gene
from 32 isolates, showing circulation of genotype III, in
agreement with previous reports from neighbouring
countries [10,15-17]. Additionally, the data shown here
support the detection of genotype I, coincident with genotype III. These findings are in accordance with the spatial
and temporal co-circulation of distinct genotypes, which
could have important implications for the epidemiology
of the disease.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic reconstruction of DENV-3
As shown in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1), in this study
DENV-3 circulation in Colombia was detected since the
beginning of 2002. The results were consistent between
distance and character-based methods, with minimal differences in topologies (Figure 1, Additional file 1, and
data not shown). The most important findings are the
detection of genotype I (or Southeast Asia/South Pacific
genotype) in Colombia and its co-circulation with genotype III (or Indian genotype) [6,18] in three states from
Colombia, La Guajira, Guaviare and Huila (Figure 2).
Genetic diversity within 3'end of the E gene of DENV-3
throughout the world allowed resolution of previous clustering in four lineages (genotypes) [6], and the presence of
a basal clade in genotype I, would be consistent with a
fifth genotype [19].
Genetic diversity within DENV-3
Diversity within DENV-3 has been previously identified
and classified [20], but they have found that genetic distance between genotypic groups is low when compared to
genetic diversity in DENV-1 and -2, showing that the fixation rate is also lower [18]. By contrast, it has been published that DENV-3 has the higher substitution rate
between the dengue viruses (about 7,48 substitutions/
site/year) [21]. Our results shows that overall mean distance for DENV-3 as estimated for 84 sequences of 224
bp, with MEGA software is 0,070; for 104 DENV-1
sequences is 0,065 and for 60 DENV-4 sequences is 0,053.
Overall mean distance for DENV-2 has not been determined in this study.
Molecular epidemiology of DENV-3 in Colombia
In the Americas, DENV-3 circulation was reported in the
1960's and 1970's, and all sequenced strains were clustered within genotype IV or American genotype [6,18].
After these isolations, genotype IV has not been identified
in any country and could be considered as an extinct genotype. In Colombia, circulation of DENV-3 was reported
from 1975 – 1977 [12]. The identification was made by
viral isolation in mosquito cells (C6/36) and indirect
immunofluorescence, but molecular detection was not
carried out. Therefore, sequences of isolated strains during
this period have not been determined. It is highly probable that Colombian isolates from this period would cluster within genotype IV, like Puerto Rico strains isolated in
the same year [GenBank: L11434].

In the present study, we attempted to amplify historical
Colombian strains of DENV-3 isolated in 1977, but it
could not be achieved, maybe due to poor samples, or
improper maintenance or storage during this time. The
recovery of these samples could enrich the basal clade of
genotype IV, or might help in explaining the presence of

informative region for genotyping [22]. Nevertheless, the

Since DENV-3 genotype III has been present in northeastern and southwestern Colombia since early 2002, different routes of introduction are possible. First, The

Venezuelan origin is supported by high similarity of
sequences and circulation of this genotype in Venezuela
in August of 2001, when the largest epidemic caused by
DENV there since the 1989 DENV-2 epidemic ended [17].
The Venezuelan origin of Colombian strains is also supported by the first isolation in La Guajira, along the frontier with Venezuela. Second, it is possible that DENV-3
genotype III had come across the frontier with Peru and/
or Ecuador. The high similarity between a strain from
Ecuador (DQ177898_Ecuador00) and a strain from Putumayo, Colombia (352_Putu02), a state along the border,
offers hard support for this idea. Finally, the entry of genotype III into the Americas was first reported in Panama
and Nicaragua in 1994 [13], so another possibility is its
introduction into Colombia through the northwestern
border with Panama. However, results do not support this
hypothesis, not only due to the genetic distance between
strains of Colombia and Panama but also mainly due to
distribution of strains on northeast and southwest of
Colombia. Surely not only one introduction event had
occurred, but probably at least two events, via northeast
and southwest of Colombia.
DENV-3 genotype I was recently described in the Americas
from nine cases in Brazil, as a result of phylogenetic analysis using two fragments corresponding to C-prM and partially the E gene [23]. Here, we report the presence of this
lineage in Colombia from a different region of the E gene,
without recent closely-related sequences available on
GenBank to date. Moreover, the related sequences corresponding to Asian strains were isolated in 1973 in Japan
as an imported case and in 1980 in Guangxi, China (GenBank: AB111085 and AF317645). Samples that clustered
in this lineage are located in a basal branch into genotype
I, with high bootstrap support (86%) and mean distance
between clades of 5%, estimated with Tamura-Nei model
to be classified as a fifth different genotype, referred to as
genotype V in [19]. Variability within genotype I has been
demonstrated as the presence of into-clade nucleotide
substitutions and branching in few years (Figure 1).
The presence of DENV-3 genotype I only in Colombia,
and its close relation with Asiatic strains from 1973 and
1980, suggests that strains circulating in Colombia during
the 1970's would have not been of genotype IV, like other
American strains from that period, but, perhaps a strain of
Asiatic origin that had been circulating without detection
for over 25 years until 2002. This speculation needs more
data to support it, because there is no evidence for genotype circulation in Colombia in the past, and explaining
possible silent circulation without causing outbreaks for
more than twenty years could be a challenge.
The presence of the Southeast Asia/South Pacific genotype
has recently been detected not only in Colombia, but also
in Brazil [23].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/101

DENV-3 genotype IV was last reported in Puerto Rico in
1977 (as corroborated by sequencing) [24], but to date
Colombian isolates from the same year have not been
sequenced because of lack of good samples from these
years. Reintroduction of other genotypes clearly has not
signified displacement of genotype IV, probably because it
was not present for more than twenty years, so co-circulation was not possible.
Intra-serotype recombination has been detected in natural
populations of DENV [22,25-29]. Nonetheless, the significance of recombination events for increasing genetic
diversity is unknown. The topology of the phylogenetic
tree could be affected by recombination between strains,
and then the results could be misinterpreted. Our findings
obtained by using a short fragment could be a product of
recombination. For this reason, we achieved sequencing
of complete E gene of strains corresponding to both
DENV-3 Colombian genotypes. The results of the phylogenetic reconstruction (Additional file 1) were consistent
with the presence of genotypes III and I (genotype V
according to [19]). Additionally, a recombination analysis
using the complete E gene was carried out, but recombination events were not detected (data not shown).
As known, the potential for causing severe disease has
been described for all four serotypes of DENV, and the
main factors considered to explain its pathogenicity are
host genetic susceptibility, antibody dependent enhancement and differences in virulence among strains [30]. It is
evident that phenotype is not segregating with phylogeny,
but is an evolutionary convergence, resulting from interaction of the viruses with hosts and moulded by selection
to enhance its transmission and persistence [31].
Determinants of virulence have been located in three
genomic regions [32] and have been tested in vitro [33], so
the genotypes have been more or less related with potential to cause DHF. Recent studies have concluded that the
spread of genotype III of DENV-3 from the Indian subcontinent to Africa and then to Latin America was correlated
with an increase in severe cases of dengue disease [10,34].
The ability of all serotypes to cause severe disease is an
indicator of adaptive selection of this character during
independent evolution of DENV serotypes. However,
more efforts should be made to understand the role of
viral genetics in human pathogenesis.
Although the origin of genotype I is uncertain, the co-circulation with genotype III could have epidemiologic
implications if it has intra-serotype antigenic variation
related with differential generation of protective antibodies and immune response [6]. It is important to take into
account the low sample size, because the possibility of a
more wide distribution of the genotypes I and III into the
country (Figure 2).

The relevance of these results is the detection of two different genotypes in the same country, one of them of Asiatic
origin, only recently described in the Americas [23]. The
results underscore the need for a global strategy of genotypes circulation surveillance, because disease dynamic is
more than a regional problem, involving neighbouring
countries as well. The establishment of a Pan-American
program would provide very useful epidemiological
information about the potential of strains for causing outbreaks.

Methods
Clinical samples
The strains included in the study, with locality, year and
GenBank accession numbers, are listed in table 1. Samples
were collected by local hospitals in Medellín (Colombia)
and Public Health Laboratories of the National Network
all around the country and remitted to the National Institute of Health (Colombia) for diagnostic and epidemiological surveillance. Serum or plasma was obtained and
kept at -70°C until processing. The samples cover a period

of four years since reintroduction and detection of DENV3 in Colombia (2002 – 2005).
Virus isolation
C6/36 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM), were infected with 0.15 ml of samples
and incubated for 10 days at 28°C, washed with PBS,
removed by hitting the culture tubes manually and seeded
on slides. Cells were then fixed with acetone and the indirect immunofluorescence procedure was carried out incubating the cells with serotype-specific monoclonal
antibodies (kindly donated by Dr. Elizabeth Hunsperger,
CDC Puerto Rico) for 60 minutes and then washed with
PBS and incubated for another 60 minutes with a commercial secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein
isotyocianate.
RNA extraction
Aliquots of 140 μl of serum or supernatants of cell cultures were placed into 540 μl of AVL buffer with Carrier
RNA and used to extract the viral RNA with QIAamp Viral

RNA Minikit (QIAGEN, Germany) as indicated by manufacturer. RNA obtained in 60 μl of AVE buffer was stored
at -70°C and used in the RT-PCR. Alternatively, the total
RNA of some samples was extracted by the use of TRIZOL®
LS (INVITROGEN, Inc., USA), and a final volume of 15 μl
was recovered in these cases.
RT-PCR and nested-PCR
The RT-PCR and nested-PCR have been previously
described [35]. When viral load was too low, nested-PCR
was used to detect DENV directly on clinical samples, so
sensitivity of detection was increased more than five logarithms and passage of viruses in cell cultures was avoided
(data not shown). RT-PCR primers were designated to
amplify an intergenic region E/NS1 of 776 bp, and nestedPCR to amplify an internal region of 350 bp.
DNA sequencing
Products of RT-PCR or nested-PCR were purified using
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany).
Sequencing reactions on both strands were performed
with 10 pmol of the primers used for the second round of
amplification, and the ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS,
USA), and analysed using an ABI model 377 automated
sequencer (APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS, USA).
Sequence editing
Four sequences were obtained for each sample, two
sequences with sense and two with antisense primer. Editing and consensus obtaining were performed with the
SeqMan module of Lasergene (DNASTAR Inc. Software,
Madison, Wis.).

Sequences on GenBank corresponding to different lineages of DENV-3 were downloaded and aligned with the
consensus sequences obtained in this study, using Clustal
W software [36]. Additionally, a visual correction of alignment was done. A fragment of 224 bp was used for phylogenetic reconstructions corresponding to the 3' end of
the E gene (nucleotides 1256 to 1479). The portion of the
NS1 gene amplified with the nested-PCR was excluded
from the analysis due to the absence of this portion in the
majority of reported sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignment of the sequences obtained in the present study
(n = 32) (Table 1) and homologous sequences for DENV3 available on GenBank (n = 68) (Table 2) were used for
phylogenetic reconstructions. Many sequences of different strains were completely identical to the fragment analysed, and so one sequence was used for analysis,
corresponding to the first isolation.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/101

The strain 359_Caqu03 was completely identical to
363_Caqu03, 366_Caqu03, 367_Caqu03, 368_Caqu03,
and 464_2003; strain 449Meta05 was identical to
456_Guav05 and 461Guav05; strain 352_ Putu02 to
484_Putu02; strain 221_Guaj02 to 233_Guaj03,
517_Caqu03,
518_putu04,
247_Guav05
and
530_Guav05; and finally, strain 375_SAnd03 was identical to 389_Guaj03, 395_NSan04, 417_Guav04,
429_Huil04, 535_Huil04 and DV06_Ant05.
The phylogenetic trees were estimated for the 224 bp fragment, corresponding to the 3' end of the E gene. Initially,
the neighbour-joining algorithm was used with 10000
bootstrap replicates and the Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution with MEGA 3.1 software [37]. Maximum parsimony and Maximum Likelihood trees were
obtained with PAUP* [38]. For selecting the model of
substitution, MODELTEST software and current dataset
were used and the resulting parameters were used for running maximum likelihood analysis. Trees were rooted
using genotype IV, only for graphical purposes.

Conclusion
The more important finding of this work is the co-circulation of genotype III of DENV-3, widely distributed, and
the recently reported genotype I, never before described in
the Americas, in three Colombian states. Co-circulation of
different genotypes in an area could be related with the
current association between DENV-3 infection and severity of disease. Moreover, intra-serotype antigenic variation
related with differential generation of protective antibodies and immune response could be one of the reasons for
the high epidemiological impact of DENV-3 in the Americas.

Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of the DENV-3 E gene corroborating
the presence of two different lineages. The Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model was used to estimate distance matrix. Sequences obtained in
present study marked with circles and boxes correspond to genotype I and
III, respectively. Bootstrap values major of 50% were maintained in the
tree supporting clustering in genotypes after 1000 pseudo-replications.
Horizontal branch lengths are drawn to scale.
