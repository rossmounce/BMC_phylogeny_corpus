Abstract
Background: Currently, there exists tens of different microbial and eukaryotic metabolic
reconstructions (e.g., Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis) with many more
under development. All of these reconstructions are inherently incomplete with some
functionalities missing due to the lack of experimental and/or homology information. A key
challenge in the automated generation of genome-scale reconstructions is the elucidation of these
gaps and the subsequent generation of hypotheses to bridge them.
Results: In this work, an optimization based procedure is proposed to identify and eliminate
network gaps in these reconstructions. First we identify the metabolites in the metabolic network
reconstruction which cannot be produced under any uptake conditions and subsequently we
identify the reactions from a customized multi-organism database that restores the connectivity of
these metabolites to the parent network using four mechanisms. This connectivity restoration is
hypothesized to take place through four mechanisms: a) reversing the directionality of one or more
reactions in the existing model, b) adding reaction from another organism to provide functionality
absent in the existing model, c) adding external transport mechanisms to allow for importation of
metabolites in the existing model and d) restore flow by adding intracellular transport reactions in
multi-compartment models. We demonstrate this procedure for the genome- scale reconstruction
of Escherichia coli and also Saccharomyces cerevisiae wherein compartmentalization of intra-cellular
reactions results in a more complex topology of the metabolic network. We determine that about
10% of metabolites in E. coli and 30% of metabolites in S. cerevisiae cannot carry any flux.
Interestingly, the dominant flow restoration mechanism is directionality reversals of existing
reactions in the respective models.
Conclusion: We have proposed systematic methods to identify and fill gaps in genome-scale
metabolic reconstructions. The identified gaps can be filled both by making modifications in the
existing model and by adding missing reactions by reconciling multi-organism databases of reactions
with existing genome-scale models. Computational results provide a list of hypotheses to be
queried further and tested experimentally.

Background
The genome of several microorganisms has been completely sequenced and annotated in the past decade [1-4].
This information has aided the metabolic reconstructions
of several microbial and eukaryotic organisms using
experimental evidence and bioinformatics based techniques providing single compartment (e.g., Escherichia coli
[5]) and multi-compartment models (e.g., Saccharomyces
cerevisiae [6]). All of these reconstructions are inherently
incomplete with some functionalities missing due to the
lack of experimental and/or homology information.
These missing reaction steps may lead to the prediction of
erroneous genetic interventions for a targeted overproduction or the elucidation of misleading organizational principles and properties of the metabolic network. A key
challenge in the automated generation of genome-scale
reconstructions is the elucidation of these gaps and the
subsequent generation of hypotheses to bridge them. This
challenge has already been recognized and a number of
computational approaches have been under development
to resolve these discrepancies [7-11].
Most of the aforementioned efforts are based on the use of
sequence homology to uncover missing genes. Specifically, sequence homology is used to pinpoint genes in
related species that have significant similarity with an
unassigned ORF of the curated microorganism [12].
Green et al formalized and further extended this concept
by introducing a method that identified missing enzymes
in a metabolic network using sequence homology related
metrics within a Bayesian framework [11]. Alternatively,
non-homology based reconstructions have been implemented by identifying candidate genes by measuring the
similarity with metrics such as mRNA co expression data
[8] and phylogenetic profiles [10] while also taking into
account the local structure of the existing partially reconstructed metabolic networks. A recent advancement in
this direction uses multiple types of association evidence
including clustering of genes on the chromosome and
protein fusion events in addition to phylogenetic profiles
[9]. All methods described above postulate a set of candidate genes and then evaluate the likelihood that any of
these candidate genes is present in the microorganism's
metabolic network of interest using a variety of scoring
metrics. In addition to these approaches, various genomic
context analyses have also been used to identify missing
metabolic genes [7,13-16]. Specifically, a recent study
exploits the availability of highly curated metabolic networks to hypothesize gene reaction interactions in less
characterized organisms [16]. These aforementioned
methods predict missing enzymes in the metabolic network by conducting sequence based comparisons of
entire genomes and inferring possible metabolic functions across different microorganisms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/212

Alternatively, a recent systems based computational
approach identifies the location of missing metabolic
functions in the E. coli iJR904 model by pinpointing discrepancies between in silico model predictions and known
in vivo growth phenotypes [17]. Subsequently, an optimization based algorithm is used to resolve these discrepancies by searching for missing metabolic functions from a
candidate database of reactions. In this paper instead, we
pinpoint metabolites that cannot carry any flux through
them and subsequently generate hypotheses to restore
connectivity. To this end, we introduce an optimization
based procedure (GapFind) to first identify such gaps in
both single and multi-compartment metabolic networks
and subsequently using an optimization based procedure
(GapFill) restore their connectivity using separate pathology resolving hypotheses. In contrast to the previous
methods which fill gaps only by identifying missing
enzymes [8-11,17] or adding transport reactions [17], we
also explore whether these gaps can be filled by making
intra model modifications. Figure 1 pictorially illustrates
how such gaps arise in metabolic reconstructions and
introduces the definitions proposed in this paper to precisely describe these pathologies.
Gaps in metabolic reconstructions are manifested as (i)
metabolites which cannot be produced by any of the reactions or imported through any of the available uptake
pathways in the model; or (ii) metabolites that are not
consumed by any of the reactions in the network or
exported based on any existing secretion pathways. We
refer to these metabolites as root no-production (e.g.,
metabolite A) and root no-consumption metabolites (e.g.,
metabolite B) respectively. At steady-state conditions no
flow can pass through them due to the incomplete connectivity with the rest of the network. Clearly, such
pathologies are not physiologically relevant and thus

there being a reaction that produces it, it can carry no flux as
A cannot be produced in the network. Equivalently, B and D
are defined as root and downstream no-consumption metabolites.

must be caused by omission and/or errors in the model
reconstruction process. Notably, the lack of flow in root
no-production metabolites and root no-consumption
metabolites is propagated downstream/upstream respectively giving rise to additional metabolites that cannot
carry any flow. We refer to these metabolites that are indirectly prevented from carrying flow as downstream no-production (e.g., metabolite C) metabolites and upstream noconsumption metabolites (e.g., metabolite D) respectively.
It is important to note that by restoring connectivity for
the root problem metabolites all upstream/downstream
metabolites are also automatically fixed. We concentrate
on resolving only no-production metabolites in the case
of cytosolic metabolites. In the case of non-cytosolic (i.e.,
present in internal compartments) metabolites, we identify mechanisms to resolve both no-production and noconsumption metabolites.
For single compartment metabolic networks (where we
have only cytosolic metabolites), we postulate three separate mechanisms for fixing no-production metabolites
(see also Figure 2). We explore whether (i) reversing the
directionality of existing reactions in the model (Mechanism 1), (ii) adding new reactions from a multi-species
database (e.g., MetaCyc [18]) (Mechanism 2) or finally
(iii) allowing for the direct importation of the problem
metabolite restores flow into the no-production metabolite (Mechanism 3). For multi-compartment models,
(e.g., S. cerevisiae) (Figure 3) we treat gaps in the cytosol
differently than gaps in compartments (e.g., mitochondria, peroxisome etc). For cytosolic no-production metabolites, in addition to the three connectivity restoration
mechanisms proposed for single compartment models,
we additionally explore whether they can be fixed by adding intracellular transport reactions between compartments and the cytosol (Mechanism 4). For non-cytosolic
problem metabolites, present in internal compartments,
direct importation from the extracellular space is not possible. Thus, their connectivity to the network is attempted
to be restored based solely on reversing directionalities,
adding external reactions or adding transport reactions
with the cytosol. In both single and multi-compartment
models, downstream/upstream no-production/consumption metabolites are automatically fixed by restoring connectivity to their corresponding root no-production/
consumption metabolite. Alternatively, we identify connectivity restoration mechanisms for downstream problem metabolites in addition to the indirect mechanisms
through the fixing of root problem metabolites.
The proposed procedures are demonstrated on two widely
used genome-scale metabolic models: E. coli [5] and S.
cerevisiae[6]. The resultant connectivity resolving modifications in these models then serve as hypotheses. Specifically, we test if reactions can be reversed in the E. coli

model (Mechanism 1) using two independent methods.
First, we query the EcoCyc database [19] about the reversibility of the tested reaction and subsequently we examine
the reaction free energy change ÎG values as approximated by Henry et al [20]. Values of ÎG close to zero are
indicative of a reversible reaction because the sign of ÎG
will be sensitive to small concentration changes in the participating metabolites. Given the limited information
(compared to E. coli) available to thermodynamically
characterize reactions in S. cerevisiae, we only employ the
first method of testing for the latter model. We test if reactions are reversible by querying the MetaCyc database for
corresponding information; if no such information is
available, we check if the same reaction is reversible in
other organisms.
Evidence for the presence of newly added reactions in the
model is identified by checking for sequence similarity
based on bidirectional BLAST scores searches [21]. Next,
we determine whether a particular metabolite has an
external uptake/secretion route (Mechanism 3) by searching for evidence in the open literature. Finally, in the case
of multi-compartment models, we validate added intracellular transport reactions by examining whether metabolites with similar structures have known transport
reactions in the metabolic network. The developed mathematical frameworks for identifying and filling gaps are
discussed in the Methods section. The next two sections
describe in detail the results obtained by applying the
above procedures to the two most highly cited genomescale models of E. coli [5] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [6].

Results
E. coli
In this study, we first identify all no-production metabolites (both root and downstream) using the (GapFind)
formulation using the most recent E. coli genome-scale
model [5]. All metabolites in the iJR904 model [5] that are
identified as transport metabolites are allowed to enter
and leave the cell. All metabolite and reaction abbreviations used in this section are taken from the iJR904 model
[5]. Figure 4 summarizes the results obtained by using the
(GapFind) formulation on the iJR904 model. As shown in
Figure 4, there are 64 no-production metabolites; 28 of
these metabolites are root and 36 are downstream no-production metabolites. Of the 64 identified no-production
metabolites, 31.2% belong to Cofactor and Prosthetic
Group Biosynthesis, 25% belong to Alternate Carbon
Metabolism, 14% belong to Oxidative phosphorylation,
10.9% belong to Cell Envelope Biosynthesis, 7.8% belong
to Nucleotide Salvage and the remaining 12.5% are not
assigned to any pathway. The presence of so many unbalanced metabolites is quite surprising given how extensively this model has been curated and how widely it is
used.

(GapFill). The numbers in the boxes indicate the mode of
flow restoration for problem metabolites in E. coli.

We next proceed with the gap-filling procedure using the
(GapFill) formulation. We first identify the metabolites
for which production mechanisms are established by
reversing directionalities of existing reactions in E. coli. As
shown in Figure 4, for 26 out of 64 no-production metabolites, production pathways are established by reversing
directionality of existing reactions in E. coli. Also, 19 out
of these 26 require a single reaction directionality reversal
while three (i.e., 3dgulnp, 5prdmbz, adocbip, bbtcoa,
ctbtcoa) require the reversal of directionality of two reactions while four metabolites (adocbi, dmbzid cbi and
pc_EC) require the reversal of three reactions respectively.
To ensure that all 26 metabolites are produced in the network, (GapFill) identifies that the directionalities of at
least twenty eight reactions have to be reversed. It is
important to note that the identified reaction directionality reversals leading to the establishment of production
routes for the problematic metabolites are to a large extent
unique. Specifically, only two additional reaction reversal
are identified when the (GapFill) model is re-solved
(using integer cuts) to exhaustively identify all possible
reaction reversals capable of resolving all no-production
metabolites (See Table 1). These results indicate that the
production of most of the no-production metabolites can
be enabled by expanding the directionality of existing
reactions in E. coli rather than adding new ones.
The validity of the identified reaction directionality reversals is examined by employing two independent procedures as stated above. First we queried the identified
reaction directionalities in the EcoCyc [19] database. We
found that eleven out of the identified 30 reactions are
listed as reversible in EcoCyc even though they are treated
as irreversible in the iJR904 [5] model (Table 1). This pro-

vides independent verification for allowing reversing the
directionality of these eleven reactions to be reversed
when they are used in the context of the E. coli genomescale model. As shown in Table 1 seven out of the eleven
reactions belong to Cofactor and Prosthetic Group Biosynthesis, while two belong to Alternate Carbon Metabolism, one to Cell Envelope Biosynthesis and one is not
assigned to any specific pathway. Notably, four of these
eleven reactions which are treated as reversible in EcoCyc
[19] (ADOCBLS, ACBIPGT, NNDMBRT and RZ5PP) are
involved in enabling the production of more than one noproduction metabolite. Of the remaining nineteen reactions for which the EcoCyc database does not provide positive evidence, the directionality of two reactions is
unspecified whereas nine reactions take place in the direction specified in the iJR904 model. There is no information regarding the remaining eight reactions in the EcoCyc
database.
As a second method of testing, we used the free energy
change values ÎG of the identified reactions as approximated by Henry et al [20]. It should be noted here that ÎG

values are available for only seventeen out of the 30 candidate reactions. It is likely that reactions that have calculated ÎG values closer to zero are reversible. These ÎG
values are contrasted against the ÎG of all the reactions
present in the E. coli iJR904 model according to the procedure of Henry et al [20] (see Figure 5). Upon quantifying
the uncertainty in the approximated ÎG values based on
the procedure by Henry and coworkers most of the identified reactions (fourteen out of seventeen) involve free
energy ranges that span both negative and positive values
(see Figure 6). This indicates that there is a reasonable
likelihood that these fourteen reactions are reversible.
Interestingly, five out of these fourteen reactions are also
independently deemed as reversible based on the EcoCyc
data (Figure 6). Using these two separate tracks of validation we find 35.71% unanimity in the prediction between
the two methods.
The second mechanism restores production routes by
adding reactions from the database described in the previous section. As shown in Figure 4, eleven out of the 64 noproduction metabolites are reconnected by adding reac-

tions from the customized external database. The reactions and the corresponding metabolites are shown in
Figure 7. (GapFill) identifies that at minimum nine reactions from the external database must be added. As seen
from Figure 7, metabolites tcynt and cyan require the
addition of the same set of five reactions from MetaCyc.
Interestingly, two of these reactions L-carnitine dehydratase and putative cyanide hydratase are E. coli reactions
that are present in the MetaCyc database but absent in the
iJR904 model. Notably, the reaction putative cyanide
hydratase is mentioned in [5] as a possible annotation for
a conserved protein which is transcribed by the gene ygiU.
For the remaining added reactions, we determine e-values
obtained by checking for sequence similarity using the
BLAST [21] algorithm between the candidate enzymes
and the ORFs in the E. coli genome are shown in Table 2.
The enzyme with the best bidirectional BLAST score of
(1e-21,2e-23) phenylpyruvate decarboxylase, is involved
in enabling the production of four no-production metabolites (Table 2). An e-value of 1e-21 indicates that only an
expected number of 1e-21alignments with equivalent or
better bit scores can occur in the database search by
chance. The obtained low e-value four enzymes (see Table
2) are indicative that these functions may indeed be
present in E. coli. Since the focus of this study is to provide
testable hypotheses and not to conduct a thorough bioinformatics based analysis of missing enzymes, we believe
that BLAST scores are sufficient. Alternatively, more elaborate scoring matrices based on Bayesian analysis and
BLAST searches have been published by Green et al [11].
The connectivity restoration for five out of the sixty noproduction metabolites requires the combination of
Mechanisms 1 and 2 (see Figure 4). Specifically, for two of
these metabolites (peamn and g3pi), in addition to
requiring the reversal of directionality of existing reactions
in the iJR904 model (see Table 1) additional reactions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/212

need to be added from MetaCyc to enable their production. Interestingly for metabolite 3dhguln the added reaction L-xylulose kinase is present in EcoCyc but absent in
the iJR904 model [5].
The production of the remaining twenty two no-production metabolites (Figure 4) is possible only by the uptake
of the corresponding metabolite from outside the cell.
Four of these twenty four metabolites (dms, dmso, tma
and tmao) even though they have an extracellular component in the iJR904 model, there are no corresponding
reactions which explicitly allow transport into the cell
(i.e., no reactions of the form metabolite A [e] --> A [c]).
Due to their presence as extracellular components, it is
reasonable to assume that the corresponding transport
reactions may also be present. For the remaining twenty
metabolites, the validity of adding uptake routes is tested
by searching for corresponding evidence in literature.
While no direct evidence was retrieved for the existence of
uptake reactions for any of these sixteen metabolites,
there exists evidence that trans-acontitate is formed spontaneously from cis-acontitate which is an intermediate in
the citric acid cycle [22,23]. Note that all the hypotheses
generated to fill gaps are available in an additional file
[see Additional File 1]. In the next section we describe the
results obtained by applying the (GapFill) and the (GapFind) procedures to the genome-scale model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [6].
S. cerevisiae
In this study, we first identify the no-production metabolites using the modified form of (GapFind) for multi-compartment models in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae iND750
model [6]. All metabolite and reaction abbreviations used
in this section are taken from the iND750 model [6]. Figure 8 shows the distribution of no-production metabolites across the different compartments in the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae iND750 model. As shown in Figure 8(A), a majority of the problem metabolites are in the
cytosol, the mitochondria and the peroxisome. Surprisingly, Figure 8(B) reveals that none of the metabolites in
either the peroxisome or the golgi apparatus are accessible. On the other hand, all the metabolites in the endoplasmic reticulum are connected. Also, as shown in Figure
9, there are a number of common problem metabolites
between the cytosol and the inner compartments. Notably, as shown in the figure, more than 25% of the problem
metabolites in the mitochondria also cannot be produced
in the cytosol. This suggests that identifying production
pathways for cytosolic no-production metabolites may
automatically fix some of the corresponding downstream
problem metabolites in the inner compartments. Taking
this into account, we restore flow through problem
metabolites in two steps: First we identify production
mechanisms for cytosolic no-production metabolites.

generated hypotheses to enable production of the remaining problem metabolites in non-cytosolic compartments.
As shown a majority of the metabolites are fixed by reversing directionalities of existing reactions in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. Also, as shown in Figure 11, a large
number of metabolites are fixed adding missing reactions
from the MetaCyc database. However, it should also be
noted that (GapFill) cannot identify production mechanisms for about 17.5% of all metabolites in the inner
compartments. This means that none of these metabolites
can be fixed by adding missing reactions from the MetaCyc database, reversing the directionalities of existing
reactions in the model or adding intracellular transport
reactions between the cytosol and the other compartments. Resolving these remaining inconsistencies would
require currently absent functionalities and/or metabolites in the multi-species reaction database.
As an example, we examine in detail the results obtained
for the golgi apparatus. As shown in Figure 12(A), (GapFind) identifies that the lack of flow in the root no-production metabolite, macchitppdol, results in fifteen
downstream problem metabolites. (GapFill) does not
identify a production mechanism for macchitppdol
which would automatically enable production of the
remaining fifteen metabolites. Instead, it fixes ten of the
sixteen no-production metabolites by adding a reaction
which is downstream of macchitppdol as shown in Figure
A)

Figure 10 shows the distribution of the production mechanisms identified by (GapFill) to enable production of
cytosolic no-production metabolites. As shown, a majority, i.e., 14 metabolites are fixed by adding transport reactions from other compartments to the cytosol. Also 14
metabolites are fixed by adding missing reactions from
the MetaCyc database and 19 metabolites are fixed by
reversing the directionalities of existing reactions in the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. Interestingly, 33 no-production metabolites are fixed by more than one of the
above mechanisms. Finally, since (GapFill) does not identify production mechanisms for any of the remaining fifteen no-production metabolites, we enable their
production by enabling transport reactions for them from
the environment. As shown in Figure 10, production
pathways for seven peroxisomal and seventeen mitochondrial metabolites are automatically identified by fixing
cytosolic no-production metabolites. Thus, identifying
production pathways for cytosolic metabolites restores
connectivity to 24 out of the 199 non-cytosolic problem
metabolites.

organisms and twelve do not even have any information
about the presence or absence of the corresponding
enzyme in MetaCyc. Interestingly reversing the directionalies of FAO80p, a reaction that oxidizes Octanoyl-CoA as
part of the fatty acid degradation pathway in the peroxisome, and FA80tp, a reaction that transports octanoate
into the peroxisome from the cytosol, fixes 83% of all
problem metabolites in the peroxisome. Notably,
FAO80p is treated as reversible in other organisms in MetaCyc. A detailed list of hypotheses generated through
(GapFill) are provided in the supplementary material [see
Additional File 2].
Fifteen reactions are added to the existing Saccharomyces
cerevisiae model to enable the production of 47 problem
metabolites (43 exclusively by adding reactions and 4 by
a combination of adding missing reactions and other
mechanisms). Of these, 18 are cytosolic metabolites (Figure 10) and 29 are non-cytosolic metabolites (Figure 11))
metabolites the model. Table 3 shows the e-values
obtained by checking for sequence similarity between the
candidate enzymes and the ORF's in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome by performing the bidirectional BLAST
analysis. As shown, eight of these enzymes have e-values
less than 10-13 in both the forward and reverse directions.
This is indicative that these candidate enzymes and the
corresponding best hits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
genome are orthologs and not paralogs [24]. Notably,
four of these eight enzymes that fix non cytosolic metabolites are already present in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
genome as cytosolic reactions. This means that, in addition to identifying missing reactions in the metabolic network, (GapFill) predicts potential activities of existing
enzymes across compartments in the model and hence, it
could be used effectively to aid in deciphering additional
potential locations for activities of existing enzymes in a
genome-scale metabolic reconstruction.
The production of the 65 (33 exclusively and 32 in combination with other mechanisms) problem metabolites in
the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model is enabled by adding 22
intracellular transport reactions between the cytosol and
the remaining compartments (Figures 10 and 11). The 43
cytosolic problem metabolites are fixed atleast partially
(Figure 10) by adding 5 transport reactions from the other
compartments; specifically three transport reactions
between mitochondria and the cytosol (transporting the
metabolites acACP, ACP, and malACP) and two transport
reaction between the peroxisome and the cytosol (ttccoa,
hexccoa transport). Examination of the prevalent transport mechanisms in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model
reveals that eight different fatty-acyl carrier protein groups
can be transported between the cytosol and the mitochondria. Taking into consideration the structural similarity
between different acyl carrier proteins, we can hypothe-

size that the three added intracellular transport reactions
between the cytosol and the mitochondria transporting
ACP, malACP and acACP are likely to be present in the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. Also, because there are
seven reactions that transport metabolites with Coenzyme
A groups from the cytosol to the peroxisome, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the transport reactions transporting ttccoa and hexccoa between the peroxisome and the
cytosol may indeed be present. Moving to the mitochondria, fifteen transport reactions added between the cytosol
and the mitochondria serve to atleast partially (taking
into account metabolites fixed by more that one mechanism) fix 16 problem mitochondrial metabolites. Two of
these transport reactions serve to transport gdp and gtp
between the cytosol and the mitochondria. Also, the three
problem metabolites in the vacuole are fixed by adding
transport reactions to transport adp and atp from the
cytosol and the vacuole. Finally the production of fifteen
cytosolic metabolites is enabled by uptaking them directly
from the extracellular space. We found no evidence in the
literature to support or contradict these uptake mechanisms.

Discussion and conclusion
In this paper, we introduced two optimization based procedures, (GapFind) and (GapFill), to identify and fill gaps
in genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. This was
achieved by pinpointing metabolites can cannot be produced or consumed in the network using (GapFind) and
then using (GapFill) to generate hypotheses that restored
flow through these metabolites. These procedures were
demonstrated on the single compartment model of E. coli
and the multi-compartment model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae[6]. When applied to the single compartment model
of E. coli, the (GapFind) procedure identified that about
10.4% of all metabolites were disjoint from the rest of
metabolism. Flow through a majority of these metabolites
was restored by reversing directionalities of existing reactions in the E. coli model. As many as 40% of them could
not be fixed by any of the postulated mechanisms instead
requiring their free uptake from the extracellular space.
Flow through the remaining metabolites was restored by
either exclusively adding missing reactions from MetaCyc
or a combination of reversing directionalities of existing
reactions in the model and adding missing reactions.

Candidate reactions from the MetaCyc database (along with BLAST scores) added to enable production of no-production metabolites in S.
cerevisiae.

Interestingly, for almost 50% of the reactions identified as
reversible by (GapFill) had supporting evidence in the
information obtained from the EcoCyc database. In the
case of the multi-compartment model of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, (GapFind) identified that approximately 30%
of all metabolites in the model were disconnected. Flow
through 22% of them was restored by adding intracellular
transport reactions in the model. Connectivity in the
remaining 78% of the metabolites was restored by a combination of the mechanisms discussed in the case of E.
coli. This left approximately 17.5% of all metabolites in
the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model whose connectivity restoration cannot be accomplished though the postulated
mechanisms.
For both models we found that a substantial percentage of
the metabolites are disconnected from metabolism and
cannot carry any flux. Despite these gaps in silico growth
predictions using models of E. coli and S. cerevisiae are typically in good agreement with in vivo results [6,25]. This is
primarily due to the fact that none of the identified gaps
are in the well characterized central metabolism pathways
and thus have no effect on growth prediction results.
However, we anticipate that in de novo metabolic reconstructions of less well curated microorganisms using software applications such as the hole filler algorithm in the
Pathway Tools software [26] gaps in central parts of
metabolism are likely to be present leading to erroneous
in silico predictions. We believe that for such automated
reconstructions of less well studied microorganisms the
utility of (GapFind) and (GapFill) will be even more pro-

nounced. We have already applied some of these concepts
in the reconstruction of the metabolic model of Mycoplasma genitalium currently underway in our group.
Clearly, the role of (GapFill) is to simply pinpoint a
number of hypotheses which need to subsequently be
tested. Using the basic set of our validation test we were
able to relatively confidently validate or invalidate
approximately 53% of the reversal of directionality of
reactions that were predicted by (GapFill). An increase in
experimental data, such as more information regarding
ÎG values of reactions, which would help determine more
accurately the thermodynamic feasibilities of transformations, will help increase this percentage. Also, use of
recently developed computational procedures which
combines available ÎG values with heuristic rules to elucidate thermodynamic constraints in genome-scale models [27] may also further sharpen the elucidation of
correctness of the generated hypotheses. Furthermore,
moving beyond the bidirectional BLAST hits that we used
to validate newly added reactions in this study, the likelihood of the presence of the added enzymes can be more
accurately assessed by using previously developed cost
functions [8-10]. Also, by adopting concepts first proposed by Reed and co-workers [17], the gap-filled model
can further be refined by contrasting in silico predictions of
growth phenotypes with experimental observations. An
inherent limitation of (GapFill) is the reliance on a candidate database of reactions. One could envision extending
(GapFill) to consider hypothetical reactions in the spirit
of the methods proposed by Hatzimanikatis and cowork-

ers [28]. In conclusion, here, we introduced a systematic
procedure to identify and fill gaps in metabolic reconstructions. As seen by the results obtained, these procedures can be used to curate existing metabolic
reconstructions. In the future, we plan to deploy these
methods during the generation phase of metabolic reconstructions of less curated microorganisms.

Methods
(GapFind): Identification of no-production metabolites
First we describe a straightforward procedure to identify
root no-production metabolites in the metabolic network
under steady-state conditions. Under steady-state conditions, metabolite balances for a metabolic network comprised of M metabolic reactions and N metabolites yield:

â Sij v j = bi

âi = 1...N

jâM

(1)

In single compartment models, the identification of
downstream no-production metabolites cannot be
accomplished by simply inspecting the entries of the Sij
matrix. Instead, an optimization procedure is proposed to
pinpoint downstream no-production metabolites. It is
assumed that for all cytosolic metabolites a consumption
term is assured because of the diluting effect of cell division acting as a metabolite sink, consumption by nonDNA controlled reactions, participation in macromolecular processes absent from the model involved in protein
and DNA formation or simply export based on simple diffusion through the cell membrane. To incorporate this
assumption, constraint (1) is rewritten as

â Sij v j â¥ 0

âi = 1...N

â§1
x npi = â¨
â©0
â§1
wij = â¨
â©0

if metabolite i can be produced in the network
otherwise
w
if reaction j that produces metabolite i in the metabolic network is active
otherwise

Given a parent metabolic network consisting of a reaction
set M and a set N of metabolites, the solution of the following optimization formulation (GapFind) identifies all
downstream no-production metabolites in addition to
the root no-production metabolites:

Maximize â ( x npi ) (GapFind)

(4)

Sijvj â¤ Mwij â i â N, j|(Sij > 0 and j â IR)

(5)

i

where bi is a parameter which signifies if metabolite i is
uptaken (bi is negative) or secreted (bi is positive), vj is the
flux in reaction j of the metabolic network, Sij is the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite i in reaction j. A
metabolite i is inferred to be a root no-production metabolite by simply scanning the ith column of the matrix containing the Sij elements and examining whether there exist
any positive entries (for irreversible reactions) or non-zero
(for reversible reactions) signifying production/uptake
terms. If no such entries are present then there is neither a
direct production nor importation route for the tested
metabolite implying that it forms the root node of a noproduction branch (see Figure 1a). Note that root no-consumption metabolites can be identified in the metabolic
network by scanning the stoichiometric matrix and
employing a procedure symmetric to the one that identifies root no-production metabolites.

jâM

The identification of the no-production metabolite set NP
(a subset of N) requires first the introduction of binary
variables xnpi and wij which are defined as:

(2)

s.t

Sijvj â¥ Îµ - M(1 - wij) â i â N, j|(Sij â  0 and j â R)
(6)
Sij"vj â¥ Mwij â i â N, j|(Sij â  0 and j â R)

wij â {0, 1}, âi, j
{j' â M|(Sij > 0 and j â IR) or (Sij â  0 and j â R)}
In (GapFind), sets R and IR comprise of reversible and
irreversible reactions in the model respectively. Constraints (4) and (5) ensure that for each irreversible reaction that produces the metabolite i, the binary variable wij
assumes a value of one only if the reaction produces
atleast Îµ units of metabolite i (i.e., Sijvj â¥ 0). Similarly, constraints (6) and (7) ensure that for each reversible reaction
in which the metabolite i participates, the binary variable
wij assumes a value of one only if the reaction produces Îµ
units of metabolite i. Constraint (8) then ensures that

Page 13 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:212

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/212

metabolite i must have at least one production route if xnpi
= 1 by requiring a minimum of that atleast for one reaction j that can produce metabolite i, the value of a wij = 1
consequently implying that atleast Îµ units of the metabolite i is produced. Constraint (9) restricts the fluxes in the
reactions present in the model organism between predetermined upper and lower bounds, UBj and LBj (LBj = 0 for
irreversible reactions). The net positive balance assumption which led to (2) is incorporated in constraint (10).
Finally the objective function (3) maximizes the sum of
the binary variables xnpi over all metabolites ensuring the
identification of all metabolites that have at least one production route given a set of available substrates. Therefore, if at the optimal solution xnpi is equal to zero then
metabolite i is a no-production metabolite thus belonging
to set NP. By using this procedure, all no-production
metabolites are identified. Metabolites identified previously as root no-production are subsequently subtracted
from the list to yield only the downstream no-production
metabolites.
The (GapFind) procedure is slightly modified for multicompartment models. As shown in Figure 3, cytosolic
metabolites can be drained out into the extracellular space
while non-cytosolic metabolites can only be transported
out into the cytosol. This implies that for metabolites
present in compartments the production term must
match exactly the consumption term (see constraint (12))
as they cannot freely drain into the extracellular space.
This implies that the balance constraint (10) in (GapFind)
is replaced by the following two constraints in multi-compartment models.

â Sij v j â¥ 0 â i â cytosol

entries between compartments (in the case of multi-compartment models). It should be noted here that all the
reactions in the MetaCyc database are treated as reversible
in the model. These reactions define set Database comprised of candidate reactions while set Model is composed
of the original genome-scale model reactions. It should be
noted that if none of the above two/three mechanisms is
capable of connecting the cytosolic no-production metabolite in single/multi-compartment models then an uptake
reaction is arbitrarily added to the model to restore connectivity. However, if a non-cytosolic metabolite (in the
case of multi-compartment models) present in an inner
compartment cannot be fixed by any of the above mechanisms it is flagged as unfixable given the employed mechanisms.
In addition to the binary variable wij defined previously,
the proposed (GapFill) formulation relies on the binary
variables yj defined as follows:
h
â§1 if reaction j from the external database is added to the parent network
yj = â¨
â© 0 otherwise

For the case of single compartment models, the task of
identifying the minimal set of additional reactions that
enable the production of a no-production metabolite i* is
posed as the following mixed integer linear programming
problem (GapFill).

(GapFill): Gap resolution based on minimal metabolic
model modifications
Upon the identification of all no-production metabolites
in the model the next step involves filling these gaps using
minimally the three mechanisms described earlier. We
first explore whether reaction directionality reversal and/
or addition of reactions from Metacyc [18] absent from
the original model links the problem metabolite with the
present substrates. This is accomplished by using a database of candidate reactions consisting of (i) all reactions
in the original model with their directionalities reversed
and (ii) reactions from a curated version of the MetaCyc
database including allowable transport mechanism

In (GapFill), the objective function (13) minimizes the
number of added reactions from the Database so as to
restore flow through metabolite i*. Constraints (14) and
(15) are identical to (6) and (7). Constraint (16) ensures
that these additions are subject to a minimum of Î´ units
for the no-production metabolite i* being produced. Constraint set (17), as in (GapFind), allows for the free drain
of all cytosolic metabolites while bounds on reactions
present in the Model are imposed by constraint set (18).
Constraint set (19) ensures that only those reactions from
the Database that have non zero flow are added to the
model. This formulation restores flow through no-production metabolites in single compartment models. For
multi-compartment models, the (GapFill) formulation is
modified. First gaps in the cytosol are filled using the
mechanisms described earlier for single compartment
models. Specifically, the (GapFill) formulation is modified by replacing constraint (17) with constraints (11) and
(12) reflecting the fact that no net production term can be
imposed for metabolites present with compartments incapable of communicating directly with the extracellular
space. The solution of formulation (GapFill) once for
each no-production metabolite i* identifies one mechanism at a time for resolving connectivity problems in the
model. It should be noted that through the use of integer
cuts [29] multiple hypotheses can be generated to resolve
these connectivity problems. In this study, we evaluate the
merit of generated hypotheses and subsequently choose
the most probable one using the following three criteria
sequentially a) The added hypotheses should not have
cycles: since the MetaCyc database consists of multiple
copies of the same reaction (which are present in different
organisms), there is a proclivity to fix metabolites by adding two copies of the same reaction in opposite directions
(since all reactions in the MetaCyc database are considered reversible) thereby forming a cycle, b) We choose the
hypotheses which enables production of the problem
metabolite with the least number of modifications and c)
We choose a hypotheses that has higher probability of
being accurate based on our validation metrics (e.g., if two
reactions are added, we choose the one with the better
blast score). Note that a GAMS implementation of (GapFill) is available as an additional file [see Additional file
4].
