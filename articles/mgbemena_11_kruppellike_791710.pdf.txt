Krüppel-like factor 6 regulates transforming
growth factor-b gene expression during human
respiratory syncytial virus infection
Victoria Mgbemena, Jesus Segovia, TeHung Chang and Santanu Bose*

Abstract
Background: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with airway remodeling and
subsequent asthma development. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF) plays a crucial role in asthma
development. The mechanism regulating TGF gene expression during RSV infection is not known. Kruppel-like
factor family of transcription factors are critical regulators of cellular/tissue homeostasis. Previous studies have
shown that Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) could function as a trans-activator of TGF gene; however, whether KLF
members play a role during infection is unknown. In the current study we have evaluated the role of KLF6 during
TGF expression in RSV infected cells.
Findings: Silencing KLF6 expression by shRNA led to drastic inhibition in TGF production during RSV infection, as
assessed by ELISA analysis of medium supernatants. RT-PCR analysis revealed loss of TGF expression in KLF6
silenced cells. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay conducted with RSV infected cells showed binding of KLF6
protein to the TGF promoter during RSV infection. We further observed reduced RSV infectivity in KLF6 silenced
cells and in cells incubated with TGF neutralizing antibody. In contrast, enhanced RSV infection was noted in cells
incubated with purified TGF.
Conclusion: We have identified KLF6 as a key transcription factor required for trans-activation of TGF gene during
RSV infection. Moreover, TGF production is required for efficient RSV infection and thus, KLF6 is also required for
efficient RSV infection by virtue of KLF6 dependent TGF production during infection.
Keywords: Krüppel-like factor 6, human respiratory syncytial virus, transforming growth factor-β, gene expression,

Findings
Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a non-segmented negative strand single-stranded RNA (NNS)
virus that causes severe lung diseases upon infection of
airway epithelial cells. RSV infection among high risk
individuals (e.g. infants, children, immuno-compromised
individuals) manifests in inflammatory diseases like
bronchiolitis and pneumonia [1]. It is also evident that
airway remodeling during RSV infection leads to asthma
development and exacerbation [2,3].
One of the hallmarks of RSV infection is enhanced airway hyper-responsiveness due to airway remodeling.

Airway remodeling leads to asthma development and
RSV infection has been linked with progression and
exacerbations of asthma [2,3]. Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) production during RSV infection may play
a role in asthma development, since TGF-b is a key
player associated with asthma development [4-7]. TGF-b
also regulates immune response against RSV infection of
infants by modulating cytokine production [8]. Although
TGF-b plays an important role during RSV-induced lung
disease infection, the mechanism regulating TGF-b gene
expression during RSV infection is unknown. In the current study, we have identified Krüppel-like factor 6
(KLF6) as a critical transcription factor required for
TGF-b gene-expression during RSV infection of human
lung epithelial cells. Although Krüppel-like factor (KLF)

transcription factor family regulates important biological
processes [9], their role during infection was not known.
Herein, we have uncovered the ability of Krüppel-like
factors like KLF6 to function as a trans-activator of a
host gene (i.e. TGF-b gene) during virus (RSV) infection.
KLF6 positively regulates TGF-b gene expression

A549 cells are routinely used as model type-II human
alveolar epithelial cells and the alveolar cells are specifically infected by RSV during productive infection of
human airway. A stable cell line lacking KLF6 was generated from A549 cells by utilizing KLF6-specific shRNA
expressing lentiviral particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA). The efficiency of silencing is evident from
lack of KLF6 mRNAs in cells stably expressing KLF6

specific shRNA (Figure 1). KLF6 mRNA was assessed by
reverse transcription-PCR or RT-PCR described previously [10,11]. The control cells represent stable cells
that were generated following transduction of lentivirus
expressing scrambled shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA). The primers utilized for the RT-PCR assay is
listed in table-1.
Control and KLF6 silenced cells were infected with purified RSV (1 MOI) [10-13], since KLF6 regulates TGF-b
gene expression during hepatic fibrosis [14,15] and thus,
we examined whether KLF6 play a similar role during
virus infection. Medium supernatant derived from control
and KLF6 silenced cells infected with RSV were used to
detect TGF-b protein levels by TGF-b ELISA kit from
eBioscience, CA, USA. Total RNA collected from these

that yielded similar results.

cells was used to examine TGF-b mRNA levels by RTPCR. TGF-b expression/production is regulated by KLF6;
since drastic reduction in TGF-b production was observed
from infected cells devoid of KLF6 (Figure 1B). The loss of
secreted TGF-b protein was due to reduced TGF-b
mRNA levels in KLF6 silenced cells (Figure 1C). Thus, our
results demonstrated that KLF6 positively regulates TGF-b
transcription during RSV infection of lung epithelial cells.
Binding of KLF6 to TGF-b promoter during RSV infection

Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChiP) assay [16] was
performed to examine binding of KLF6 to TGF-b promoter during RSV infection. Chromatin isolated from RSV (1
MOI) infected A549 cells was immuno-precipitated overnight at 4°C with either anti-KLF6 antibody or isotype
matched control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA,
USA). The precipitated DNA was analyzed using promoter-specific PCR primer pairs encompassing the KLF6
binding site at the TGF-b promoter. PCR primer pairs
corresponding to the TGF-b promoter site that do not
bind to KLF6 served as a negative control. The KLF6DNA complex was analyzed by standard PCR using primer specific for KLF6 binding site on TGF-b promoter
[14]. The primer sequences used for the ChiP assay are
listed in table-2.
KLF6 binding to TGF-b promoter was not observed in
un-infected cells, whereas RSV infection resulted in binding of KLF6 to TGF-b promoter at 24 h post-infection
(Figure 2), which corresponds to maximal TGF-b production from infected cells (Figure 1B). KLF6 binding to TGFb promoter was specific, since immuno-precipitation with
control IgG did not yield any amplified product. Similarly,
no amplified product was observed following amplification
with primers that do not correspond to KLF6 binding site

on TGF-b promoter. These studies demonstrated that
KLF6 directly trans-activates TGF-b gene expression following its association with TGF-b promoter during RSV
infection.
RSV replication is regulated by KLF6

Since KLF6 is critical for expression of TGF-b, a gene
that is known to modulate RSV infection [6,7], we next
evaluated the role of KLF6 in regulating RSV infectivity.
For these studies, control and KLF6 lacking cells were
infected with RSV. Medium supernatant collected from
RSV infected control and KLF6 lacking cells were used to
determine infectious viral titer by plaque assay. Expression of KLF6 is also required for RSV replication, since
number of infectious plaque (representing viral infectivity/replication) was reduced by approximately 40% in
KLF6 silenced cells (Figure 3). This result implicated an
essential role of KLF6 in supporting optimal RSV replication/infection in lung epithelial cells.
KLF6 mediated production of TGF-b is required for
optimal RSV infectivity

Since KLF6 expression is crucial for optimal RSV infectivity (Figure 3), we next investigated whether TGF-b
confers such activity. A549 cells were pre-incubated
with purified TGF-b (a kind gift from Dr. LuZhe Sun,
University of Texas Health Science Center) for 2 h prior
to RSV infection. RSV infection was performed either in
the presence or absence of TGF-b protein. Viral infectivity was assessed by plaque assay of medium supernatant. As shown in Figure 4A, treatment of cells with
purified TGF-b enhanced viral infectivity by approximately 160%, suggesting that indeed TGF-b posses proRSV activity.

The role of TGF-b during RSV infection was further
confirmed by using neutralizing anti-TGF-b antibody
(anti-TGF). A549 cells pre-incubated (for 2 h) with either
isotype matched control antibody (control IgA2) or antiTGF-b (anti-human TGF-b IgA) were infected with RSV
in the presence or absence of the corresponding antibodies. Control and TGF-b neutralizing antibodies were
purchased from Invivogen, San Diego, CA. Viral infectivity
was assessed by plaque assay analysis of medium supernatant. Neutralization of TGF-b activity during RSV infection resulted in reduction of viral titer by approximately
40% (Figure 4B). Interestingly, the reduction in viral titer
was similar to that was observed following infection of
KLF6 silenced cells (Figure 3). These results demonstrated
that KLF6 mediated production of TGF-b is required for
optimal RSV infectivity.
TGF-b gene expression is tightly regulated since TGF-b
contributes to development of chronic disorders like
asthma [4,5]. Infection with respiratory viruses like RSV
and rhinovirus leads to development of asthma, probably

due to airway remodeling by TGF-b produced during
infection [4,5,17]. TGF-b also regulates RSV infectivity
and immune response in infected host. For example, previous studies have reported the requirement of TGF-b to
support RSV replication [6,7] and regulate the immune
response in infected infants [8]. Despite the multi-functional role of TGF-b during RSV infection, the mechanism regulating TGF-b gene expression during RSV
infection was unknown. In the current study, we have
identified KLF6 as a critical transcription factor required
for TGF-b gene-expression/production during RSV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both KLF6 and
TGF-b is required for optimal RSV infection of lung
epithelial cells.
The family of Krüppel-like factor (KLF) transcription
factors controls a wide spectrum of biological processes
including cell growth, cell proliferation and differentiation [9]. KLF transcription factors regulate the function

of various organ systems (hematological, digestive, cardiovascular, respiratory systems) and have been implicated
in the development/progression of diseases like cancer,
metabolic disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory
diseases [9]. KLF6 factor is known to regulate gene
expression in various tissues by acting as a trans-activator or repressor of gene expression [18,19]. In addition,
KLF6 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene
associated mainly with prostate cancer [20]. KLF6
mediated TGF-b expression was shown to contribute to
the development of hepatic fibrosis [15,21]. During
hepatic fibrosis, KLF6 directly associated with the TGFb gene [14,15]. Although KLF factors have been implicated in regulating normal cellular/tissue homeostasis,
their role during infection has not been examined yet.
In the present study we have shown that indeed, KLF
factors like KLF6 play an essential role during infection
by regulating the expression of TGF-b gene during RSV
infection.
Our studies have demonstrated that KLF6 directly
binds to TGF-b promoter during RSV infection and this
event results in trans-activation of TGF-b gene. Interestingly, KLF6 is expressed in the lungs [22] and KLF4
(both KLF4 and KLF6 are phylogenitically related since
both belong to group-2 of KLF factors) expression in
lung is potentially associated with pulmonary fibrosis
and enhanced inflammation of the airway [23]. Thus, we
speculate that similar to KLF4, KLF6 may play a similar
role during RSV infection of the respiratory tract since
KLF6 regulates expression of TGF-b, which is involved
in lung remodeling and airway fibrosis. Further studies
are required to establish these regulatory functions of
KLF6 by using conditionally knockout transgenic mouse
once they are available because KLF6 knockout results
in embryonic lethality.
