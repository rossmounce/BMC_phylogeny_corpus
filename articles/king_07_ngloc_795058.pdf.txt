We present a method called ngLOC, an n-gram-based Bayesian classifier that predicts the
localization of a protein sequence over ten distinct subcellular organelles. A tenfold cross-validation
result shows an accuracy of 89% for sequences localized to a single organelle, and 82% for those
localized to multiple organelles. An enhanced version of ngLOC was developed to estimate the
subcellular proteomes of eight eukaryotic organisms: yeast, nematode, fruitfly, mosquito, zebrafish,
chicken, mouse, and human.

In this study we address the task of estimating the subcellular
proteome through development of a computational method
that can be used to annotate the subcellular localization of
proteins on a proteomic scale. A fundamental goal of computational methods in bioinformatics research is to annotate
newly discovered protein sequences with their functional
information more efficiently and accurately. Protein subcellular localization prediction has become a crucial part of
establishing this important goal. In this task, predictive models are inferred from experimentally annotated datasets containing subcellular localization information, with the
objective being to use these models to predict the subcellular
localization of a protein sequence of unknown localization.

information

The methods developed for predicting subcellular localization have varied significantly, ranging from the seminal work
by Nakai and Kanehisa [5] on PSORT, which is a rule-based
system derived by considering motifs and amino acid compositions; to the pure statistics based methods of Chou and
Elrod [6], which employed covariant discriminant analysis; to

interactions

Subcellular or organellar proteomics has gained tremendous
attention of late, owing to the role played by organelles in carrying out defined cellular processes. Several efforts have been
made to catalog the complete subcellular proteomes of various model organisms (for review [1,2]), with the aim being to
improve our understanding of defined cellular processes at
the organellar and cellular levels. Although such efforts have
generated valuable information, cataloging all subcellular
proteomes is far from complete. Experimental methods can
be expensive, often generating conflicting or inconclusive
results because of inherent limitations in the methods [3,4].
To complicate matters, computational methods rely on these
experimental data, and therefore they must be resilient to
noisy or inconsistent data found in these large datasets. These
dilemmas have made the task of obtaining the complete set of
proteins for each subcellular organelle a highly challenging
one.

the numerous methods available today, which are based on a
variety of machine learning and data mining algorithms,
including artifical neural networks and support vector
machines (SVMs) [7,8]. All methods must choose a set of features to represent a protein in the classification system.
Although the majority of methods use various facets of information derived from the sequence, others use phylogenic
information [9], structure information [10], and known functional domains [11]. Some methods scan documents and
annotations related to the proteins in their dataset in search
of discriminative keywords that can be used as predictive
indicators [12,13]. Regardless of the representation, the
sequence of a protein contains virtually all of the information
needed to determine the structure of the protein, which in
turn determines its function. Therefore, it is theoretically possible to derive much of the information needed to resolve
most protein classification problems directly from the protein
sequence. Furthermore, it has been proposed that a significant relationship exists between sequence similarity and subcellular localization [14], and the majority of protein
classification methods have capitalized on this assumption.
In addition to different classification algorithms and protein
representation models, subcellular localization prediction
methods also differ in exactly what they classify. Some consider only one or a few organelles in the cell [15,16]. Others
consider all of the major organelles [5,6,8,11]. Methods often
limit the species being considered, such as the PSORTb classifier for gram-negative bacteria [17]. Others limit the type of
proteins being considered, such as those related to apoptosis
[18]. We refer the interested reader to a review by Dönnes and
Höglund [19], which provides an overview of the various
methods used in this vast field.
High-throughput proteomic studies continue to generate an
ever-increasing quantity of protein data that must be analyzed. Hence, computational methods that can accurately and
efficiently elucidate these proteins with respect to their functional annotation, including subcellular localization, at the
level of the proteome are urgently needed [20]. Although a
variety of computational methods are available for this task,
very few of them have been applied on a proteome-wide scale.
The PSLT method [21], a Bayesian method that uses a combination of InterPro motifs, signaling peptides, and human
transmembrane domains, was used to estimate the subcellular proteome on portions of the proteome of human, mouse,
and yeast. The method of Huang and Li [22], a fuzzy k-nearest
neighbors algorithm that uses dipeptide compositions
obtained from the protein sequence, was used to estimate the
subcellular proteome for six species over six major organelles.
Despite the availability of an array of methods, most of these
are not suitable for proteome-wide prediction of subcellular
localization for the following reasons. First, most methods
predict only a limited number of locations. Second, the scoring criteria used by most methods are limited to subsets of

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R68

proteomes, such as those containing signal/target peptide
sequences or those with prior structural or functional information. Third, the majority of methods predict only one subcellular location for a given protein, even though a significant
number of eukaryotic proteins are known to localize in multiple subcellular organelles. Fourth, many methods exhibit a
lack of a balance between sensitivity and specificity. Fifth, the
datasets used to train these programs are not sufficiently
robust to represent the entire proteomes, and in some cases
they are outdated or altered. Finally, many methods require
the use of additional information beyond the primary
sequence of the protein, which is often not available on a proteome-wide scale.
In this report we present ngLOC, a Bayesian classification
method for predicting protein subcellular localization. Our
method uses n-gram peptides derived solely from the primary
structure of a protein to explore the search space of proteins.
It is suitable for proteome-wide predictions, and is also capable of inferring multi-localized proteins, namely those localized to more than one subcellular location. Using the ngLOC
method, we have estimated the sizes of ten subcellular proteomes from eight eukaryotic species.

Results

We use a naïve Bayesian approach to model the density distributions of fixed-length peptide sequences (n-grams) over ten
different subcellular locations. These distributions are determined from protein sequence data that contain experimentally determined annotations of subcellular localizations. To
evaluate the performance of the method, we apply a standard
validation technique called tenfold cross-validation, in which
sequences from each class are divided into ten parts; the
model is built using nine parts, and predictions are generated
and evaluated on the data contained in the remaining part.
This process is repeated for all ten possible combinations. We
report standard performance measures over each subcellular
location, including sensitivity (recall), precision, specificity,
false positive rate, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC),
and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. MCC provides a measure of performance for a single class being predicted; it equals 1 for perfect predictions on that class, 0 for
random assignments, and less than 0 if predictions are worse
than random [23]. For a measure of the overall classifier performance, we report overall accuracy as the fraction of the
data tested that were classified correctly. (All of our formulae
used to measure performance are briefly explained in the
Materials and methods section [see below], with details provided in Additional data file 1.) To demonstrate the usefulness
of our probabilistic confidence measures, we show how these
measures can be used to consider situations in which a
sequence may have multiple localizations, as well as to consider alternative localizations when confidence is low.

the dataset. Although CSK and GOL had the lowest sensitivity, their precision was very good, which is typical when a
class is under-predicted. Specificity is very high across all

plasma membrane (PLA), nuclear (NUC), and cytoplasm
(CYT), had the lowest specificity, which is typical for highly

All of our tests are based on the standard ngLOC dataset
(detailed in the Materials and methods section [see below]),
which was selected with a minimum sequence length of 10
residues allowed. We ran a test using only single localized
sequences, as well as the entire dataset including multi-localized sequences. For a 7-gram model, the overall accuracy of
both models on single-localized sequences only was 88.8%
and 89%, respectively. The results for the model built using
the entire dataset is shown in Table 1, and will be the model of
choice because it will enable prediction of multi-localized
sequences as well.

comment

In the context of proteins, an n-gram is defined as a subsequence of the primary structure of a protein of a fixed-length
size of n. First, we determined the optimal value of n to use by
evaluating the predictive performance of ngLOC over different size n-gram models up to 15-grams. For this test only, we
used only single-localized sequences, and set the minimum
allowable length sequence to be 15 to enable testing of models
up to 15-grams. Our results show that the 7-gram model had
the highest performance, with an overall accuracy of 88.43%.
However, both the 6-gram and 8-gram models are close to
this level of performance, with accuracies of 88.12% and
87.53%, respectively (Figure 1). The results reported in the
rest of this report use the 7-gram model, unless otherwise
stated.

between 0.78 and 0.92. On the other end are the classes with
the smallest representations in the dataset, including lysosome (LYS), peroxisome (POX), CSK, and GOL, whose MCC
values range between 0.63 and 0.90. Surprisingly, LYS and
POX, the two classes with the smallest representation in the
dataset, had good MCC values (0.902 and 0.836, respectively). We determined the percentage of n-grams that were
unique (occurred in only one organelle) in each of these four
organelles (LYS, POX, CSK, and GOL) and discovered that
LYS and POX had the highest percentage of unique n-grams
with respect to the total number of n-grams in the organelle
(data not shown). This suggests that the proteins in these
locations are highly specific and distinctive compared with
those proteins localized elsewhere, and could explain the
superior performance of these locations despite their having
the smallest representation in the training dataset. We also
observed that n-grams in CSK and GOL had the lowest percentage of unique n-grams compared with any other class in
the data, suggesting that n-grams in these organelles are
more likely to be in common with n-grams in other
organelles, and therefore the proteins in these organelles will
be difficult to predict. The remaining classes performed well,
with MCC values of 0.87.
An ROC curve depicts the relationship between specificity
and sensitivity for a single class. The ROC curve for the perfect classifier would result in a straight line up to the top left
corner, and then straight to the top right corner, indicating
that a single score threshold can be chosen to separate all of
the positive examples of a class from all of the negative exam-

ples. Figure 2 shows the ROC curve for each class in ngLOC.
Each point in the curve is plotted based on different confidence score (CS) thresholds. For all classes except CYT and
NUC, the ROC curves remain very close to the left side of the
chart, primarily because the majority of classes have very high
specificity at all CS thresholds. This is a desirable characteristic of ROC curves. Although PLA and mitochondria (MIT)
have a high rate of false positives at the lowest score thresholds, the rate of true positives remains high, indicating that a
good discriminating threshold exists for these classes. CYT
has a high rate of false positives for lower score thresholds,
again confirming that CYT is a class that is prone to over-prediction. This is also confirmed by its low precision (0.828).
The other class that is prone to over-prediction is NUC, exhibiting the lowest precision of all 10 classes (0.807). NUC has
the lowest specificity as well. This is probably a result of the
characteristics of the short nuclear localization signals (NLSs)
that exist on nuclear proteins. These NLSs can vary significantly between species. The ngLOC method, which uses a 7gram peptide to explore the protein sample space along the
entire length of the protein, is probably discovering many of
these NLSs in the nuclear sequences. Because the dataset
contains many examples of nuclear proteins among many
species, many candidate NLSs will be discovered, thereby
leading to over-prediction of nuclear proteins.
To obtain the sensitivity for multi-localized sequences, we
consider two types of true positive measures: at least one of
the two localizations had the highest probability, and both
localizations had the top two probabilities. The overall accuracy of at least one localization being correctly predicted was
81.88%, and for both localizations being correctly predicted it
was 59.7%. When considering the accuracy of both localizations being predicted to be within the top three most probable
classes, the accuracy increased to 73.8%, suggesting that this
method is useful in predicting multi-localized sequences.

A probabilistic confidence measure is an important part of
any predictive tool, because it puts a measure of credibility on
the output of the classifier. Table 2 demonstrates the utility of
our CS (range: 0 to 100) in judging the final prediction for
each sequence. We found that a score of 90 or better was
attributed to 37.5% of the dataset, with an overall accuracy of
99.8% in this range. About 86% of the dataset had a CS of 30
or higher. Although the accuracy of sequences scoring in the
30 to 40 range was only 70.1%, the cumulative accuracy of all
sequences scoring 30 or higher was 96.2%. We found that the
overall accuracy of the classifier proportionally scaled very
well across the entire range of CSs.
In Table 2, we present the performance of ngLOC under the
restriction that the correct localization for a given sequence
was predicted as the top most probable class. To understand
how close ngLOC was on misclassifications, we expanded our
true positive measure by considering correct predictions

It is known that a significant number of sequences in eukaryotic proteomes are localized to multiple subcellular locations;
a predominant fraction of such sequences shuttle between or
localize to both the cytoplasm and nucleus. To differentiate
single-localized sequences from those that are multi-localized, we developed a multi-localized confidence score
(MLCS). We evaluated the MLCS on the entire dataset, and
considered the accuracy on multi-localized sequences over
different MLCS thresholds. For accuracy assessment in this
test, a prediction is considered to be a true positive if both correct localizations are the top two most probable classes, which
is the most stringent requirement possible. As shown in Table
4, 76% of the multi-localized sequences scored an MLCS of 40
or higher, whereas 81% of the single-localized sequences have
MLCS scores under 40. Over 20% of multi-localized
sequences received a score of 90 or better, as compared with
only 0.2% of single-localized sequences in this range. Multilocalized sequences in this range had both localizations correctly predicted 98.7% of the time. These results are very
promising, considering that multi-localized sequences comprise less than 10% of our entire dataset. In general, the
higher the MLCS, the more likely the sequence is not only to
be multi-localized but also to have both correct classes as the
top two predictions. Table 5 shows examples of the MLCSs
and CSs output by ngLOC for a few multi-localized sequences.

This table shows how the confidence score associated with each prediction relates to the overall accuracy. The higher the score, the more likely the
prediction is to be the correct one. For example, all sequences scoring 90 or better had an accuracy of 99.8%. About 80% of the dataset was scored
40 or higher with a cumulative accuracy of 98.3%.

within the top four most probable classes. As shown in Table
3, for single-localized sequences, the overall accuracy jumped
from 88.8% to 94.5% when the correct prediction is considered within the top three most probable classes. Although this
improved accuracy has no meaning for single-localized
sequences, it indicates that the majority of misclassifications
were missed by a narrow margin. For multi-localized
sequences the classifier predicted both correct localizations
as the top two most probable classes 59.7% of the time; however, the classifier predicted both correct localizations within
the top three or four classes with accuracies of 73.8% and
83.2%, respectively. We also considered the accuracy of only
those sequences localized into both the cytoplasm (CYT) and
nucleus (NUC), because they represent 51.6% of our set of
sequences with two localizations. As expected, the accuracy
increased, with at least one correct localization predicted
within the top three with an accuracy of 99.5%, and both
localizations predicted at an accuracy of 96.3% in the top four
most probable classes. The high performance for sequences
localized to both CYT and NUC is partly attributed to the fact
that this combination of organelles has the largest representation of all multi-localized sequences in the dataset (1,120
out of 2,169).

[LYS], and perixosome [POX]), which are typically difficult to
predict.

sequences from the PLOC dataset that are localized into the
chloroplast and vacuole, because we do not consider plant
sequences. We built both a 6-gram and a 7-gram model using
our entire dataset, and used the PLOC dataset for testing purposes. We had overall accuracies of 88.04% and 85.64%,
respectively, both of which compared favorably with the
78.2% overall accuracy reported by PLOC. It is important to
note that the optimal value of n in ngLOC is dependent on the
amount of redundancy in the data being tested. A 6-gram
model performed better than a 7-gram one, which confirms
the lower redundancy in the PLOC dataset than in the ngLOC
dataset. We observed that there were some predictions with a
CS of 90 or greater but were misclassified by ngLOC. We
discovered that all sequences predicted with this level of confidence that were misclassified by ngLOC were due to incorrect annotation, probably because of the PLOC dataset being
outdated (see Additional data file 1 [Supplementary Table 1]
for some examples). Each one was verified in the latest SwissProt entry as matching our prediction. We also found
instances in which some of the predictions misclassified by
ngLOC were actually multi-localized and should have been
considered correct as well (Additional data file 1 [Supplementary Table 2]. Our performance results are without correcting

For our next comparative test, we found a similar dataset that
has been used by the research community, namely PLOC
(Protein LOCalization prediction) [8]. The primary
differences between our data and PLOC's are in the version of
the Swiss-Prot repository from which the sequences were
acquired, the level of sequence identity assumed in the dataset, and the multi-localized annotation in our dataset.
Sequences with up to 80% identity were allowed in the PLOC
dataset, whereas all sequences with less than 100% identity
were allowed in the ngLOC dataset. We disregarded

Mouse (M. musculus)

We extended the core ngLOC method to allow classification of
proteins from a single species. We call this method ngLOC-X,
which is based on the model depicted in equation 9 (see Materials and methods, below). Assessing the performance of
ngLOC-X proved challenging, because only a small percentage of each proteome has subcellular localizations annotated
by experimental means, and therefore it is impossible to infer
an exact accuracy measurement on proteome-wide predictions. However, subsets of these proteomes are represented
in the ngLOC dataset, and so performance analysis can be
inferred from these subsets. We chose two species for performing extensive analysis: mouse (3,596 represented
sequences out of 23,744) and fruitfly (753 represented
sequences out of 9,997). (Human had the largest set, with
5,945 represented sequences; we did not test this subset
because of the amount of data that would need to be removed
from the core ngLOC dataset.) For each species, we extracted
the represented protein sequences from the ngLOC dataset
and trained ngLOC on the remaining data. After training, we
ran a 10-fold cross-validation on the extracted data, comparing the performance results between the standard ngLOC
model against ngLOC-X. For this test, we examined the predictions of only single-localized sequences, resulting in 3,214
sequences from mouse and 683 sequences from fruitfly for
analysis.

For our final comparative test, we modified ngLOC to predict
12 distinct classes, and used the complete PLOC dataset (with

annotations in the PLOC dataset, as well as updates that label
multi-localized sequences, would further improve the accuracy of ngLOC on the PLOC dataset.

and testing on our method, using a 10-fold cross-validation
for performance analysis. On a 6-gram model, the overall
accuracy was 82.6%, which again compared favorably with
PLOC's accuracy of 78.2%. We found numerous misclassifications that had a correct second-highest prediction (see
Additional data file 1 [Supplementary Table 3] for example
predictions). In fact, out of 12 possible classifications, ngLOC
predicted the correct localization to be within the top two
most probable classes 88.7% of the time. It is interesting to
note that even in this test we discovered some sequences that
were misclassified according to PLOC annotations, but the
prediction by ngLOC was consistent with the latest release of
Swiss-Prot (Swiss-Prot:P40541 and Swiss-Prot:P33287). We
also discovered instances where the sequence is multi-localized, and ngLOC predicted the location that was not annotated in the PLOC dataset (for instance, Swiss-Prot:P40630
and Swiss-Prot:P42859]. Nevertheless, we believe that these
annotations were correct at the time the PLOC dataset was
constructed. These results underscore the robustness of our
method and usefulness of its CS, because we were able to
identify outdated annotations in the PLOC dataset, identify
potential multi-localized proteins in data not annotated
accordingly, and consider alternate localizations beside the
predicted class when the CS is low, suggested by the high
accuracy when considering the top two classifications.

This chart presents the location-wise percentages of the proteome predicted to localize into one organelle. (For example, 9.55% of the yeast
proteome is localized to the mitochrondria only.) These percentages sum to the total size of the proteome estimated to be single-localized. We also
present the estimated percentage of the proteome that is localized to multiple organelles. The percentage of the proteome estimated to localize to
both the cytoplasm and nucleus is also displayed. The coverage is determined with a confidence score (CS) threshold of 15. Multi-localized

and increased to 80.5% for fruitfly. The average sensitivity
(often reported as normalized overall accuracy) improved as
well, increasing from 86.9% to 87.5% in mouse, and from
72.6% to 74.0% in fruitfly. Although the gains in overall accuracy and sensitivity are not significant, we noted a significant
increase in the number of sequences predicted with high confidence. For mouse, ngLOC predicted 39.1% of the data with
a CS above 90 at 99.8% accuracy, whereas ngLOC-X predicted 52.9% of the data in the same range at the same accuracy. Fruitfly exhibited the same effect, with ngLOC
predicting 28.1% of the data with a CS above 70 at 99.0%
accuracy, whereas ngLOC-X predicted 38.7% of the data in
the same range at 99.2% accuracy. We are sure that this is an
artifact of adjusting the n-gram probabilities to reflect the
proteome being predicted. Nevertheless, this test showed us
that incorporating the proteome for species X in the model, as
required for ngLOC-X, did not have a negative effect on the
performance compared with the standard ngLOC model,
while improving the coverage of the proteome predicted with
high confidence.
We sought to determine how the predictions would be
affected when ngLOC-X was trained on the proteome of one
species, and tested on a different species. When testing the

mouse sequences on ngLOC-X trained for fruitfly, the overall
accuracy and normalized accuracy again stayed the same.
However, when testing fruitfly on ngLOC-X trained for
mouse, the overall accuracy dropped from 80.5% to 79.2%,
which was slightly worse than the standard ngLOC model.
These tests showed us that a species with high representation
in the training data will not result in any improvement in
overall accuracy by tuning the model for a specific proteome,
but that a species with low representation will yield the
greatest benefit when the model parameters are tuned specifically for that species.
Our next test was to examine the instances in these proteome
subsets in which ngLOC and ngLOC-X generated different
predictions. For the mouse data, we found 62 sequences out
of the 3,214 single-localized sequences predicted that resulted
in different predictions between the two methods. The
standard ngLOC method had 15 of these sequences predicted
correctly, whereas ngLOC-X had 16. For the fruitfly predictions, there were 38 sequences out of the 683 sequences with
different predictions. Of these, ngLOC had 10 instances that
were predicted correctly, whereas ngLOC-X had 17 correct
predictions.

We can only offer educated speculation regarding the results,
because accurate annotation is not available. However, the
proteome-wide predictions obtained by ngLOC-X are closer
to what we expect than those obtained by ngLOC. For
example, in our previous work, in which we used a completely
different method [16], we estimated that 6.3% of the pro-

refereed research

Our final test was to compare location-wise predictions
between ngLOC and ngLOC-X on the entire proteome for
mouse and fruitfly. For this test, we trained both methods
using the entire ngLOC dataset, and then applied each
method on the entire Gene Ontology (GO)-annotated proteome data obtained. Table 6 shows the percentage of
sequences localized into each possible class. The prediction
for each sequence is determined by observing the most probable class predicted, and assigning that class as the prediction. In this test, all predictions are considered, meaning that
no CS threshold is assumed, and neither are multi-localized
sequences determined. Mouse had 56.8% of the 23,744 predictions for ngLOC generated with a CS of 40 or greater, as
compared with 58.1% for ngLOC-X. Fruitfly had 26.3% of the
9,997 predictions for ngLOC generated in the same range, as
compared with 35% for ngLOC-X. Again, we observed a more
substantial increase in coverage for ngLOC-X in the predictions for the fruitfly proteome, a species with low representation, whereas mouse showed little increase in coverage for the
same range. There were 2,555 out of 23,744 (10.76%) different predictions between ngLOC and ngLOC-X for mouse, and
1,126 out of 9,997 (12.02%) different predictions for fruitfly.
This test showed us that when considering predictions on a
proteome level, even a highly represented species such as
mouse will result in many predictions of low confidence, and
thus can potentially benefit from ngLOC-X as well.

deposited research

Although most of these improvements demonstrated by
ngLOC-X are statistically insignificant, fruitfly exhibited a
relatively greater improvement from the ngLOC-X method
than did mouse. We also discovered in both cases that almost
all sequences with different predictions between the two
methods were instances predicted with a low CS (for example,
a CS value <40.) These results may be explained by
recognizing that low-confidence predictions are more likely
for sequences from a species that does not have a high representation of an evolutionarily close species in the training
data. The ngLOC dataset has a higher number of proteins
from species closely related to mouse (the mammalian proteins) than to fruitfly. This is confirmed by the overall accuracies reported from ngLOC for mouse and fruitfly, which were
93.5% and 79.5%, respectively; it is also confirmed by the fact
that 90.8% of the mouse data were predicted with a CS of 40
or greater, whereas fruitfly only had 66.6% of the data predicted in the same CS range. Moreover, we believe that
ngLOC-X will have the most benefit on the predictions from a
species with low representation in the training data. This is
confirmed by the following observations. First, there was a
noticeable increase in the overall and normalized accuracy
between ngLOC and ngLOC-X on fruitfly, whereas mouse did
not benefit from ngLOC-X. Second, our cross-species test
showed that testing mouse predictions on ngLOC-X trained
for fruitfly did not affect the accuracy, whereas fruitfly
showed slightly worse performance than the standard ngLOC
method when tested on ngLOC-X trained for a mouse. Based
on these findings, it is evident that ngLOC-X will show
improvement in the accuracy of low-confidence predictions
over ngLOC. If the sequences from a species being predicted
have a high representation of evolutionarily closer species in
the training data (such as mouse), then ngLOC-X has little
value in final predictive accuracy. In either case, ngLOC-X
never resulted in a decrease in performance compared with
ngLOC, and resulted a significant increase in high confidence

teome of the fruitfly and 4.6% of the proteome of the mouse is
localized in the mitochondria. Our 5.4% and 4.8% predicted
with ngLOC-X for fruitfly and mouse, respectively, compared
favorably with our former results, and showed significant
improvement for mitochondrial estimates over ngLOC in
both cases. All of our comparative tests of ngLOC versus
ngLOC-X showed that ngLOC-X was a valuable addition to
the core ngLOC method.

Estimation of subcellular proteomes of eight
eukaryotic species
We have used ngLOC-X to estimate the subcellular proteomes
of eight different eukaryotic species. With the exception of
yeast, proteomes of eukaryotic model organisms have a
significant portion of hypothetical proteins (about 25% to
40%). To avoid predictions on hypothetical proteins, we generate predictions on a subset of the proteome containing at
least one annotated GO concept, namely those proteins that
have been experimentally validated or closely related to proteins with experimental validation at some level. We then use
these predictions to generate estimates of the subcellular proteome for each species.
To generate the complete results, we trained ngLOC-X using
the entire ngLOC dataset. Predictions were generated for the
GO-annotated subset of sequences for each proteome. We
selected a CS threshold that allows inclusion of all predictions
except those of very low confidence. One reason why we did
this was that ngLOC predicts only 10 subcellular locations.
However, there are other relatively minor organelles in
eukaryotic cells that proteins may localize into. (For example,
ngLOC does not predict sequences targeted for the vacuole.
Although this organelle is nearly nonexistent in higher
eukaryotic cells, it is significant in yeast cells.) These
sequences will probably result in a very low CS, because they
have no representation in the training data. The other reason
why we selected a CS threshold was that sequences that have
a low homology measure with respect to any other sequence
in the ngLOC training data will be hard to classify, and will
also result in a low CS. For these two reasons, we chose a CS
threshold (CSthresh) of 15 as the cutoff value to aid in
eliminating these sequences from the proteome estimation.
With this threshold, ngLOC covered an impressive range of
94.52% to 99.82% of the tested proteomes (Table 7). The proteome estimations are based on the percentage of sequences
predicted with a CS of greater than or equal to CSthresh. We
chose an MLCS threshold (MLCSthresh) of 60 to estimate the
percentage of the proteome that is multi-localized. According
to Table 4, in a tenfold cross validation test, 42% of the multilocalized sequences in ngLOC were predicted with an MLCS
of greater than or equal to 60 at an accuracy of 93.9%,
whereas only 2.4% of single-localized sequences were incorrectly predicted as multi-localized at this threshold. This is a
conservative threshold chosen to emphasize higher accuracy
on multi-localized sequences without over-prediction. We
also report the percentage of the proteome multi-localized

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R68

into both the cytoplasm (CYT) and nucleus (NUC), because
more than half of the multi-localized sequences in the ngLOC
training dataset are localized between these two organelles.
Table 7 shows the complete results. (See Additional data file 1
[Supplementary Table 4] for the corresponding chart containing numeric estimates of the fractions in Table 7.)
Overall, the fractions of subcellular proteomes scaled consistently across the different species, as shown in the last column
of Table 7. We observed that the percentage of sequences
localized into the endoplasmic reticulum (END), golgi
apparatus (GOL), and perixosome (POX) tend to remain relatively consistent across species, with average percentages of
3.0%, 1.44%, and 0.5%, respectively. In contrast, the fractions
of the subcellular proteomes with relatively large percentages
(cytoplasm [CYT], mitochondria [MIT], nuclear [NUC],
plasma membrane [PLA], and extracellular [EXC]) varied
widely across different species. This variation is expected,
because as multicellular eukaryotes evolved with higher complexity, consolidation of specific cellular functions to defined
organelles took place, resulting in the sequestering of corresponding proteins to these organelles. As a result, more
variation is observed in the proteome sizes of larger
organelles. Nevertheless, the fraction of subcellular proteomes reported for mouse and human are very similar,
which is expected because of their close evolutionary distance. The size of the yeast mitochondrial proteome estimate
in this study (9.55%) agrees with those previously reported
(about 10%) by computational methods [9,16], and closely
matches the experimental estimates reported (13%) [25].
Similarly, about 1,500 nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins have been estimated in the human mitochondria [4,26]
and our estimate of 4.8% corresponds to 1,730 proteins
(Table 7 and Additional data file 1 [Supplementary Table 4]
contain numeric proteome estimates), suggesting that
ngLOC-X estimates are on par with those obtained by other
computational and experimental approaches.
Some of the organelles indicate a trend related to the evolutionary complexity of the species being predicted. The fraction of proteomes localized to the cytoskeleton (CSK) and
golgi (GOL) appear to exhibit an increasing trend with the
evolutionary complexity of the species, whereas mitochrondria (MIT) and nucleus (NUC) indicate a slight decreasing
trend. For the other organelles, such trends are not noticeable. Nevertheless, we should like to point out that the proteomes compared in this study are not evolutionarily
equidistant, which makes it difficult to infer trends in the evolution of organellar proteomes.

From the protein feature space point of view, a different sized
n-gram will map protein surface features differently. We
believe that the high performance exhibited by 6- to 8-gram
models (Figure 1) is due to the fact that these n-gram peptides
are ideal for mapping the secondary structure space of proteins. Secondary structure elements are vital for attaining a
proper fold of a protein, and consequently are vital for its
function. Hence, these secondary structures are distinctly

interactions

A multinomial naïve Bayes model is a simplistic yet effective
model when used in conjunction with the n-gram model for
representing proteins. The n-gram model is able to capture
sequence homology while allowing for differences due to
insertion, deletion, or mutation. This model effectively
shrinks the protein sequence space, thereby allowing a higher
degree of redundancy between proteins of different classes
that could not be achieved by considering the entire protein
sequence. It should be noted that the optimal value of n chosen is highly dependent on two factors: the number of
sequences in the training data and the measure of sequence
similarity in the training data. Generally, both large datasets
and datasets with high sequence similarity will need longer ngrams for effective classification, although larger values of n
will result in a model that overfits the training data. Additionally, this has an affect on the CS. If the dataset is large and
highly similar, we found that short n-grams lead to
probabilities that are all relatively close in value, which
results in CSs that all fall within a very tight range. The reason
for this is that the total number of n-grams in equation 4 is
proportionally large with respect to the size of the dataset. For
example, when using a 2-gram model on our dataset, the
scores for the entire dataset all ranged between 8.41 and
11.72, but when we use a 7-gram model the range is 0.0 to
99.21. Although the scores were in a tight range for the 2gram, we observed the same relationship between relative
score value and overall accuracy. It would be easy to re-scale
the scores for performance analysis to fall within similar
ranges across all models.

It is well known that functional domain regions of proteins
are highly conserved because they define a vital part of the
overall functionality of the protein. From our previous studies, we observed that about 74% of the functional domains are
localized exclusively to only one of the 10 subcellular locations [11]. Hence, we wondered whether we could observe any
relationship between discriminatory n-grams and their
occurrence in the domain regions in a protein. To perform
this test, we downloaded domain definitions from the InterPro database [27]. Only domains definitions that were at least
as long as the n-gram length used in the ngLOC model were
considered. We mapped these domain definitions onto the
single-localized proteins in the ngLOC dataset. This resulted
in 15,109 protein sequences that had some portion of its
sequence mapped to a functional domain. Overall, 75.5% of
the n-grams in these sequences were mapped to a domain.
(We say that an n-gram is mapped to a domain only if the
entire n-gram falls within the bounds of a domain.) Different
localization classes had different coverage of n-grams in
domain regions, ranging from 53.7% (nuclear [NUC]) to
86.8% (lysosome [LYS]). Additional data file 1 (Supplementary Table 5) provides the complete results of this analysis.

a specific localization. We consider a very conservative, strict
definition of a discriminatory n-gram as an n-gram that
occurs at least five times over all sequences but in only one
localization class in the ngLOC dataset. Based on this definition, we found that only 15.0% of all n-grams were highly-discriminatory. However, 91.4% of all discriminatory n-grams
occurred entirely within a domain region, suggesting that the
discriminatory n-grams indeed originate from the domain
regions. It should be noted that the number of discriminatory
n-grams found in domain regions vary among different subcellular classes (ranging from 80.2% to 97.5%). Nevertheless,
all of these occurrences are statistically significant compared
with their expected values, as shown in Additional data file 1
(Supplementary Table 5).

We compared our estimates with those generated using the
PSLT method [21]. Our estimates of the human subcellular
proteome largely agree with those reported by PSLT, with the
exception of a difference in the number of multi-localized
sequences (16.0% versus 9.7% reported by ngLOC-X), which
is probably due to our conservative choice for MLCSthresh
(≥60). (For comparison, an MLCSthresh ≥50 resulted in
13.4% of the predictions being multi-localized.) We also show
a significant difference for those proteins targeted for the
plasma membrane (17.1% versus 24.1% reported by ngLOCX). This may be significant, because our predictions are based
on 24,638 sequences from the human proteome, as compared
with PSLT's predictions on 9,793 sequences. Moreover, proteins localized to the plasma membrane have large coverage
in the ngLOC dataset. These reasons suggest that our estimates are certainly plausible. Additional data file 1

age multi-localized value in Table 7. Although sequences
localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus occupy a significant portion of the multi-localized subcellular proteome, we
found that approximately one-third of the sequences localized into the cytoplasm were predicted to localize into other
organelles as well. This is probably because the cytoplasm is
the default location for protein synthesis as well as the hub of
cellular core metabolism. Similarly, almost 1% of the proteome consisted of secreted proteins that were also localized
to the plasma membrane.

conserved across proteins with different functions and from
different subcellular locations.

Comparison with other methods
Many recent methods, including PLOC, were based on SVMs
[8,28,29]. As successful as some of these models have been,
we determined that SVMs were not suitable for our needs.
First, we plan to explore the most discriminatory n-grams in
proteins between different subcellular organelles. With
ngLOC, it will be easy to extract n-grams of interest from the
model, because the relation between each n-gram and the
integer identifier generated for use by the classifier is symmetric. However, with SVM-based methods, the kernel in the
SVM projects the features of the data to a higher dimensional
space to increase the likelihood of making the data linearly
separable. Although one might discover excellent SVM
parameters for a particular classification problem, it will be
difficult to understand how the translated feature space is discriminating between classes. Second, as we have illustrated, a
probabilistic measure ought to be considered a crucial part of
any predictive model. Therefore, we determined that a pure
probabilistic model was desired. Deriving this measure is a
difficult feat for SVMs because of their nonprobabilistic output. Any attempt to derive such a measure with SVMs can be
done only by creating another layer of classification to simulate a probability measure from the output of the SVMs. The
risk of the simulated probability distribution overfitting the
data used to generate the distribution is a known artifact with
these methods [30]. The pure probabilistic confidence measure derived directly from the probabilities calculated from a
method such as ngLOC will have a more consistent, scalable
probability measure.

Estimation of subcellular proteomes
Our model, ngLOC, was enhanced to allow dynamic adjustment of the model parameters specific to a proteome being
estimated. This model, termed ngLOC-X, is useful for predicting the subcellular localization of the proteome of any
species. Our proteome prediction results showed that
although a single model can be used on a variety of species,
better results can be had if the model is tuned for a specific
species being considered (Table 6). If a single model is being
used across numerous species, it is very important to include
a broad spectrum of data across all species. Unfortunately,
this is not possible because of the imbalanced nature of protein sequence data in the public domain. Our model, ngLOCX, essentially extends the core ngLOC model by introducing a
bias toward a single species being predicted. The accuracy
and coverage of our model across species will continue to burgeon as the proteomes of new eukaryotic species become
available. The eukaryotic species selected in this study
represent a broad spectrum in the eukaryotic superkingdom
(not including plants). Despite this, corresponding fractions
of each subcellular proteome fall within a reasonable range
across species (Table 7). This suggests that the proteome size
corresponding to the core functionality of an organelle

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R68

remains unchanged across species, whereas the observed variation in size allows for functionalities required by specific
species for their adaptation. This hypothesis can be tested by
studying the organellar proteomes at the domain level, and
we aim to continue this work in the future.

Discriminatory n-grams and functional domains
It is known that targeting signals such as KDEL/HDEL (for
endoplasmic reticulum) and SKL (for peroxisomes) play a
distinct role in transporting a protein to its destination in the
cell. Nevertheless, ngLOC does not require prior knowledge
regarding such signal peptides, and neither does it explicitly
consider such information in the prediction process. Despite
this, ngLOC is able to perform better than methods that
explicitly use such information because each discriminatory
n-gram is analogous to such signals. To support this argument, we demonstrated that 91.4% of all discriminatory ngrams originate from the domain regions of proteins (Additional data file 1 [Supplementary Table 5], which define the
core function of a protein. The observations suggest that
ngLOC predictions are based on functionally significant
regions (domains) of the protein sequences, which are represented by n-grams covering the entire sequence space. In contrast, methods that rely on target signals generally scan only
the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal regions of protein
sequences, where such signals are located. It is likely that if
the targeting signals are shorter than the n-gram, then the
discriminatory n-grams represent both the signal as well as
its neighborhood (which is often very important for transport). Similarly, if protein transport requires motifs that are
longer than the n-gram, such motifs would be represented by
multiple and mostly contiguous n-grams. Therefore, ngLOC
need not have prior knowledge of specific targeting signals,
because it is likely that analogous signals (discriminatory ngrams) are inherently identified de novo and used in establishing the localization prediction of the protein. Because of
this plasticity, the ngLOC method has the ability to perform
well on a number of locations, and hence it is highly suitable
for proteome-wide prediction of subcellular localization.

Conclusion

In this new age of proteomics there is great need for computational methods that can classify newly discovered proteins
using information derived only from the primary sequence.
Methods that predict the subcellular localization of a protein
are an important part of meeting this need. In our study we
have developed the ngLOC method, a Bayesian classifier that
can predict the subcellular localization of a protein with superior performance against other methods of similar scope.
Because ngLOC is a probabilistic method, we were able to
generate an extremely useful probabilistic confidence score
(CS) that places a measure of credibility on each prediction.
We have shown how this measure was used to determine the
most likely localization for new proteins and possible annota-

We report standard performance measures over each subcellular location class, denoted as cj, including the following:
sensitivity (recall), which is the fraction of data in class cj that
were correctly predicted; precision, which is the fraction of
data predicted to be in class cj that were actually correct; specificity, which is the fraction of data not in class cj that were
correctly predicted; false positive rate, which is the fraction of
data not in class cj that were incorrectly predicted to be in
class cj; and MCC. The latter provides a measure of performance for a single class being predicted, where it equals 1 for
perfect predictions on that class, 0 for random assignments,
and less than 0 if predictions are worse than random [23].
We also report overall accuracy, defined as the fraction of
data that were classified correctly, as a comparative measure
of the overall performance of the classifier. Finally, we show a
ROC curve as a graphical means of measuring the performance for each class. (All of our formulas used to measure performance are detailed in Additional data file 1.) All
performance measurements are based on a standard 10-fold
cross validation unless otherwise stated.

The dataset used for this task is a set of protein sequences

contains experimentally determined annotations on subcellular localization. We applied the following filters to obtain
high-quality data for testing and training our program: only
eukaryotic, nonplant sequences were considered; sequences
with predicted or ambiguous localizations were removed;
sequences shorter than 10 residues in length were removed;
all redundant sequences were removed; and sequences
known to localize in multiple locations were manually
checked and sorted to avoid errors caused by automated keyword-based sorting. The final set of training data consisted of
a set of 28,056 sequences. Of these, 2,169 sequences were

1,120 were localized to both cytoplasm and nucleus. Locationwise distribution of this dataset is shown in Table 9.

As with most computational models, the accuracy of ngLOC is
completely dependent on the quality and coverage of the
dataset used to train the model. Although many methods are
unable to use large datasets because of computational limitations, ngLOC does not have these limitations. Clearly, modern day proteomics will continue to produce increasing
amounts of experimentally determined data. The simplicity
of the ngLOC model will enable it to easily incorporate these
new data as they become available, thereby increasing the
accuracy and coverage of ngLOC in the future. ngLOC can

The n-gram model for protein representation
Letting S denote the feature space used to represent all proteins, we develop S and our predictive model in light of the
significant work that has been accomplished in the field of
document classification. Cheng and coworkers [33] showed
that using document classification techniques on the primary
sequence can achieve good results on classifying protein families. In a typical document classification model, S is
constructed by considering all possible words that may
appear throughout the entire set of documents. Here, we consider subsequences of a protein of fixed length n as the equivalent of words in a document. In literature, these protein
subsequences have been commonly called n-grams, n-mers,
n-peptides, or simply words or subsequences of length n
[34,35]. We adopt the term n-gram. In protein classification
tasks using the n-gram model, S is constructed by considering
all possible n-grams.
Formally, we let Σ represent the set of all possible amino
acids, and |Σ| = 20. Given a dataset of protein sequences D,
let di be a sequence in D having k residues in length, where di
= (s1s2 ... sk) and each si ∈ Σ. In an n-gram model, the size of
the feature space grows exponentially with n, because |S| =
|Σ|n. To illustrate, an integer variable typically requires four
bytes of memory. If such a variable was used to keep track of
the frequency of each of the possible 5-grams, the model
would require 4 bytes × 205 features = 12.8 MB of memory, a
6-gram model would require 256 MB, and a 7-gram requires
5.1 GB of memory. Fortunately, for large values of n, relatively
few n-grams actually occur in nature because of the evolutionary selection process, which requires a delicate mixture of
various amino acid combinations in a peptide to sustain a

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R68

fold. A simple analysis on the entire National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant dataset (2.7 million
protein sequences at the time of this analysis) showed that an
n-gram length as small as n = 5 had examples that never
occurred. Therefore, to allow n-gram models for n > 5, we
take advantage of the sparse nature of higher order n-grams
by developing a one-to-one mapping between unique ngrams and the set of integers to be used as indices, as needed.
This requires memory allocation only for n-grams that occur
in the training data, thereby allowing exploration of large values of n.

Naïve Bayes classifiers and subcellular localization
Bayesian predictive models have been effectively used in a
variety of classification problems, including both document
and protein classification tasks [33,36-38]. We give a brief
derivation of the model in the context of protein subcellular
localization prediction, using similar notation as depicted by
McCallum and Nigam [36].
Given a protein sequence di, a probabilistic approach to subcellular localization prediction is to develop a model to estimate the probability that di is localized into each cj ∈ C, where
C represents the set of all possible localization classes. The
classifier h predicts the localization of di to the class that has
the greatest posterior probability. Equation 1 shows this in
probabilistic terms, and shows how the well known Bayes rule
is used to derive an estimate for this probability.

h(di ) = arg max P (c j | di ) = arg max
cj

cj

P (di | c j ) P (c j )
P (di )
(1)

An accurate Bayesian classifier is dependent on accurate estimates for the probabilities on the right-hand side of equation
1. The denominator P(di) is dropped because it is constant.
The prior probability of each subcellular localization cj,
denoted P(cj), is estimated from D by counting the number of
sequences assigned to class cj, divided by the total number of
sequences in D:

P (c j ) =

c j

(2)



P(di | cj), the posterior probability of protein sequence di given
location cj, is the difficult parameter to estimate. As
discussed, we use the n-gram model to represent proteins. We
make the naïve Bayes assumption, in which the occurrence of
the tth n-gram in S, denoted wt, is identically and independently distributed (IID) with respect to every other n-gram in
S, where each wt follows a Bernoulli distribution. In reality,
this is not a correct assumption, because n-grams are clearly
not independent of each other. An accurate probabilistic
model based on n-grams would need to consider a joint distribution over all possible combinations of n-grams, which is

with the sum of the scores over all classes totaling 100. This

probability of class cj, given sequence di and the n-gram
model used.
The multi-localized confidence score for sequence di (equation 8) is derived from the CSs of the two most probable
classes for that sequence, denoted as CS1 and CS2, respectively. This score is designed to give a relative measure of the
likelihood that sequence di is multi-localized into two
organelles.

built using datasets from sequences over many species across
the eukaryotic superkingdom. In fact, the ngLOC dataset
exhibited in Table 9 contains proteins from 1,923 different
species. This introduces another variable that can be
observed. Although some methods indirectly observe the
relationship between the species and the dependent variable
by incorporating phylogenic information in their model, it is
usually not directly observed. However, it is known that in the

An advantage in using a probabilistic model, such as a naïve
Bayes classifier or a Hidden Markov Model, over nonprobabilistic approaches is that the probability of the model generating a given sequence is inherently reported for every class.
Although the prediction is based on the model with the highest probability, the probability can also be used as a comparative measure against other classes. If the predicted class had
a low probability, it might suggest that the second or third
highest predictions should also be considered. If the top two
classes predicted were relatively high compared to the rest of
the classes, it might suggest the possibility that the sequence
is localized into both locations. We develop a probabilistic CS
for sequence di for each possible class cj, denoted CS(di | cj),
and show how this is used to address each of the above issues.
We also derive a multi-localized confidence score, denoted
MLCS(di), that gives a probabilistic measure of sequence di
being multi-localized.

an impossible task because of the exponential amount of
memory required and because sequences vary in length.
Fortunately, the IID assumption has worked well in practice.
With these assumptions, each sequence di is viewed as a collection of unordered n-grams generated by a random process
following a multinomial distribution [36]. Estimating the
posterior probabilities for each class simply involves counting
n-gram occurrences in the dataset for each class separately
(Figure 4). If a sequence in the dataset is multi-localized, then
it will have multiple class labels. In this case, the count of ngrams for each class that sequence is localized to will be
updated equally. We let Nit be the count of the number of
occurrences of n-gram wt in sequence di. Under these distribution assumptions, we can derive an estimate for the probability of a sequence, given a class, as follows:

classes varies among species. For example, one study of mitochondrial proteins estimates that 9.9% of the yeast proteome
is localized in the mitochondria, as compared with an estimated 4.8% of the human proteome [16]. Another study estimated that as much as 13% of the yeast proteome is localized
in the mitochondria [25]. It is clear that the predictions for
the proteome of a specific species can be improved if the prior
probability P(cj) is known for the species being predicted.
Unfortunately, this information is not available before
classification.
We extend equation 1 by introducing another random variable X that will represent the species being predicted. We will
refer to the model that incorporates the proteome in this
manner as ngLOC-X:

We only need to consider the two terms in the denominator
for reasons stated previously. We solve for P(di | cj, X), the
probability of a protein sequence, given subcellular localization cj and species X, by assuming a mixture model of two
independent conditional probability distributions over the
space of protein sequences. One distribution is over proteins
with known subcellular localization but unknown species,
and the other distribution is over proteins of a known species
but unknown subcellular localization. This forms a mixture
model of two distributions, formally stated as follows:
P(di | cj, X) = αj P(di | cj) + (1 - αj) P(di | X)

(10)

The component P(di | cj) is estimated as given in equation 3.
The component P(di | X) is estimated in the same way; however, we let Nit be the count of the number of occurrences of
n-gram wt in the proteome for species X, and P(wt | cj) is
replaced by P(wt | X), which is the probability of n-gram wt,
given species X. To estimate α, the mixture proportion for
P(di | cj), we use the following:

( Total n − grams in class c j )
αj =

The mixture model allows us to consider the distribution of ngrams over an entire proteome by adjusting the probabilities
of each n-gram in the training data to represent more accurately the distributions of n-grams in the proteome being
classified. The result is that the distribution of P(wt | cj) over
all n-grams will be more similar to that of the proteome, while
retaining the relative probabilities of each class within individual n-grams learned from the labeled data.
Solving for P(cj | X) is difficult because we do not know the
distribution of subcellular localizations in a given species, and
neither can it be observed before classification. However, we

incorporate the proteome for species X using a LaPlaceantype of estimate, adding the proteome data to each class. The
result is shown in equation 12, where Dx represents the dataset consisting of sequences from the proteome of species X:

(

)

P cj | X =

c j +  X

(

 +  X

)

(12)

This method can cause the probability estimates for P(cj | X)
to become more uniform in proportion to the size of the dataset of the proteome (Dx) being considered. We accept this tendency, because it implicitly factors in a measure of
uncertainty proportional to the size of the proteome being
considered, meaning the larger the proteome, the more
uncertainty there is in regard to the exact prior probabilities
of each subcellular localization. In this case, the priors should
not be based solely on the exact percentages of the ngLOC
training data.
