Diversity, mobility, and structural and functional
evolution of group II introns carrying an unusual
3’ extension
Nicolas J Tourasse1,2*†, Fredrik B Stabell1,3† and Anne-Brit Kolstø1

Abstract
Background: Group II introns are widespread genetic elements endowed with a dual functionality. They are
catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) that are able of self-splicing and they are also mobile retroelements that can invade
genomic DNA. The group II intron RNA secondary structure is typically made up of six domains. However, a
number of unusual group II introns carrying a unique extension of 53-56 nucleotides at the 3’ end have been
identified previously in bacteria of the Bacillus cereus group.
Methods: In the present study, we conducted combined sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of
introns, host gene, plasmid and chromosome of host strains in order to gain insights into mobility, dispersal, and
evolution of the unusual introns and their extension. We also performed in vitro mutational and kinetic
experiments to investigate possible functional features related to the extension.
Results: We report the identification of novel copies of group II introns carrying a 3’ extension including the first
two copies in bacteria not belonging to the B. cereus group, Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 and Bacillus sp. 2_A_57_CT2,
an uncharacterized species phylogenetically close to B. firmus. Interestingly, the B. pseudofirmus intron has a longer
extension of 70 bases. From sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses, several possible separate events of
mobility involving the atypical introns could be identified, including both retrohoming and retrotransposition
events. In addition, identical extensions were found in introns that otherwise exhibit little sequence conservation in
the rest of their structures, with the exception of the conserved and catalytically critical domains V and VI,
suggesting either separate acquisition of the extra segment by different group II introns or a strong selection
pressure acting on the extension. Furthermore, we show by in vitro splicing experiments that the 3’ extension
affects the splicing properties differently in introns belonging to separate evolutionary branches.
Conclusions: Altogether this study provides additional insights into the structural and functional evolution of unusual
introns harboring a 3’ extension and lends further evidence that these introns are mobile with their extension.

Background
Group II introns are genetic elements that are widespread in bacteria and in the organelles of eukaryotes.
They are self-splicing catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) that
remove themselves from precursor mRNA transcripts
and ligate their flanking sequences (exons). Group II

introns are also mobile retroelements which can invade
genomic DNA sites [1-5]. Splicing can proceed through
two major competing pathways, branchpoint or hydrolytic splicing [6-10]. Branchpoint splicing (or branching)
involves two transesterification reactions, where the first
reaction is initiated by nucleophilic attack on the 5’
intron-exon junction by the 2’ hydroxyl group of a specific bulged adenosine residue (the branchpoint) in
domain VI near the 3’ end of the intron. In the second
reaction, the flanking exons are ligated and a branched
intron lariat containing a 2’-5’ linkage is released [1,2,5].

The hydrolytic pathway also consists of two steps; in the
first step a water molecule acts as the nucleophile, and a
linear intron is released after transesterification in the
second step. Mobility occurs through reverse-splicing of
the intron RNA into DNA and subsequent reverse-transcription by a multifunctional protein encoded by the
intron (IEP, intron-encoded protein). Group II introns
recognize and insert predominantly into cognate (homologous) intron-less sites in a process called retrohoming.
Homing sites cover ~30 bp, and during splicing and
reverse-splicing base-pairing interactions are made
between a subset of these nucleotides (intron-binding
sites, IBS, spanning positions -12 to +1 relative to the
insertion site) and the complementary motifs in the
intron RNA (exon-binding sites, EBS), while the distal
regions are recognized by the IEP [1,2,4]. In addition,
group II introns can insert into non-cognate (ectopic)
sites that share partial similarity to the homing site in a
process called retrotransposition, which occurs at a
much lower frequency. In bacteria, group II introns are
also often associated with other mobile genetic elements, such as insertion sequences and plasmids, that
act as vectors for horizontal transfer [11-13].
The secondary structure of the group II intron RNA typically consists of six domains (numbered I to VI) that are
linked by a network of tertiary interactions, and introns are
classified based on structural features and IEP phylogeny
[1,2,5,14-16]. However, we identified 15 copies of six unusual and different group II introns that carry a related 53/
56-nucleotide (nt) extension at the 3’ end [17-19]. All these
introns were found in bacteria of the Bacillus cereus group,
including B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. mycoides, and B.
pseudomycoides. These bacterial species are genetically closely related and are known to harbor a range of mobile elements such as plasmids and introns [13,20-23]. Functional
analysis demonstrated that the extra segment is part of the
intron RNA molecule and affects the self-splicing reaction
in vitro, and thus could be considered as a domain VII
[17,18,24]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the unusual
introns belong to two subgroups a and b within the bacterial B class [17,18]. In the present study we report the
identification of the first introns with a 3’ extension in bacterial species from outside the B. cereus group. Using the
complete and diverse set of introns with an extra segment
we conducted a detailed sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the introns together with their host genes and strains
in order to gain insight into mobility, dispersal, and evolution of these elements and their domain VII. Functional
studies were also carried out to investigate possible features
related to the extension.

Results and discussion
Sequence similarity searches of public sequence databases using BLASTN conducted in the present study

revealed six additional group II introns carrying a 3’
extension similar to those previously identified in refs
[19,17], and [18] (Table 1). Interestingly, while all
introns with a 3’ extension known to date were found in
closely related bacteria forming the B. cereus group, two
of the newly discovered elements are encoded by strains
of unrelated species, namely Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4
(previously classified as B. firmus OF4; [25]) and the
uncharacterized Bacillus sp. 2_A_57_CT2. Phylogenetic
analysis based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequences indicated that B. sp. 2_A_57_CT2 is close to B. firmus and
that B. sp. 2_A_57_CT2, B. pseudofirmus OF4, and the
B. cereus group are distantly related among the Bacilli
(Additional file 1: Figure S1; [26]). These findings therefore extend the distribution of introns carrying an extra
domain from the B. cereus group to the Bacilli.
Indirect evidence for mobility of the unusual introns with
their extension

With respect to the phylogeny of the introns themselves,
many of the introns with a 3’ extension belong to the b
subgroup within the bacterial B class [17,18], and in particular eight are highly similar to the B.th.I6 intron from
B. thuringiensis kurstaki BGSC 4D1/HD1 (Table 1). The
B.th.I6-like introns (B.th.I6 and B.c.I16) are all inserted
in the same homing site within the pXO1-42 plasmid
gene, and the two intron copies (B.th.I6a and b) found
in B. thuringiensis kurstaki BGSC 4D1/HD1 were suggested to be the result of intron mobility [17,18]. Here,
by combining all the available sequence data, supplemented by a PCR screen for pXO1-42, and by using the
high sequence similarity between the introns and
between the host genes, together with reconstructions of
the phylogenetic relationships of the host genes and
host strains, we attempted to detect further signs of
intron mobility and to identify the events that have driven the dispersal of the unusual introns.
Altogether, the dataset included pXO1-42 sequences
for 40 strains, including 12 sequenced large plasmids
(180-560 kb) belonging to the “pXO1-like” family [28].
Phylogenetic analysis of the pXO1-42 sequences
revealed interesting patterns. Firstly, the pXO1-42 phylogeny was largely inconsistent with the chromosomal
MLST phylogeny (Figure 1), which indicates that there
has been extensive horizontal transfer of “pXO1-like”
plasmids disseminating this gene within the B. cereus
group. Indeed, large plasmids are the main vectors of
group II intron spread in this bacterial group [13]. Secondly, the pXO1-42 sequences were divided into two
clusters separated by a long evolutionary branch and
supported by a high statistical value (Figure 1A). This
division is further supported by comparison of full plasmid or genome sequences, which confirmed that it corresponds to two groups of plasmids within the “pXO1-

The entire nucleotide sequences (IEP-encoding ORF included) of B.c.I4a, b, c, and d are identical and inserted in the corresponding host gene. B.th.I5a and b
differ at three nucleotide positions only. B.th.I6b, c, and d are identical to each other, while B.th.I6a and e are 98.4% and 99% identical to the former introns,
respectively, and B.th.I6f differs from B.th.I6b, c, and d at a single nucleotide position. B.c.I16a and b/c are ~90% identical to the various B.th.I6 copies. All B.th.I6
and B.c.I16 copies are located in the same host gene. Due to missing sequence data, it could not be confirmed whether the B.c.I16 intron is present in one or
two copies in the B. cereus F65185 strain. The entire nucleotide sequences of B.th.I7a and c are identical. Part of the IEP-encoding ORF sequence of B.th.I7b is

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree of pXO1-42 sequences from B. cereus group bacteria (A) and comparison with genetic relationships of the
strains (B). Specific groups of strains have been colored to emphasize the incongruence between the two trees. In A), the tree was
reconstructed from the nucleotide sequences of pXO1-42 using the Neighbor-Joining method applied to a pairwise distance matrix computed
following Tamura’s 3-parameter model. For strains with known plasmids, the plasmid name is given in parentheses. Strains whose pXO1-42
sequence contains an intron are shown in bold (intron name given in square brackets and yellow background; due to incomplete sequence
data, it could not be confirmed whether strain F65185 carries one or two copies of B.c.I16). Numbered curly brackets indicate four pXO1-42
groups (strains labeled in different colors) sharing identical sequences around the intron’s homing site, while remaining strains (in black) have
variable sequences not belonging to these groups (sequences shown in Figure 2A). In B), the tree was extracted from a supertree of 1403
isolates based on multiple locus sequence typing (MLST) data of chromosomal housekeeping genes available in the SuperCAT database http://
mlstoslo.uio.no/. No MLST data are available for strain BGSC 4I5. Strains whose genome has been completely sequenced are marked with
asterisks. In A) and B) numbers next to branch nodes indicate statistical support values when > 50%. Scale bars are in average numbers of
nucleotide substitutions per site. Origin and information about the strains can be found at the University of Oslo’s typing website, http://
mlstoslo.uio.no/. pXO1-42 was identified in four additional strains (AH1271, AH1272, AH1273, and AH717), however they were not included here
because their genotyping data are conflicting (see [29])

like” family, herein named “A” and “B” (Additional file 1:
Figure S2). Thirdly, B.th.I6-like introns are distributed in
both groups. Identical copies are present in distantly
related pXO1-42 sequences, as exemplified by B.th.I6b
and c/d and by B.c.I16a and b/c. This strongly suggests
mobility of the individual introns rather than transfer of
the whole locus containing host gene and intron (Figure
1A). A different example of intron mobility is given by
the B. cereus Q1 strain which harbors B.c.I16a. This
strain is part of a clonal complex including isolates
AH819, AH825, and AH831 that has emerged recently

in the MLST supertree (Figure 1B). The latter three isolates encode pXO1-42 sequences closely related to that
of Q1 (with an identical homing site) but that are
intron-less. This indicates therefore that an independent
integration of B.c.I16a must have occurred in B. cereus
Q1 quite recently in evolution. A last piece of evidence
for mobility of B.th.I6-like introns is given by the fact
that the sequence of the B.th.I6/B.c.I16 homing site also
correlates with the phylogeny of the full pXO1-42 gene
(Figures 1A and 2A). As this sequence interacts with the
intron directly by basepairing, the presence of identical

intron copies in different homing sequences strengthens
the idea that this is the result of retrohoming by the
introns.
Examination of the insertion sites of the B.th.I7a and b
copies indicated that the B.th.I7 intron as well must be
mobile with its extension. These two intron copies are
inserted in different genes in B. thuringiensis kurstaki
BGSC 4D1/HD1 (Table 1) and BLAST sequence similarity searches revealed that the genomic contigs containing B.th.I7a and B.th.I7b matched plasmidic and
chromosomal B. cereus group sequences, respectively
(data not shown). While the nucleotide sequences of the
two intron copies are identical, the insertion sites exhibit little similarity, with the exception of the IBS2 motif
(Figure 2B). This can be taken as evidence of retrotransposition of B.th.I7 into ectopic sites. This finding,
added to the results presented above for the B.th.I6-like
introns, shows that both retrohoming and retrotransposition of unusual group II introns in plasmid or chromosomal loci have occurred in B. cereus group genomes.
However, no insight into the direction and precise history of these events could be inferred. B.th.I7 and the B.
th.I6-like introns respectively belong to the a and b
phylogenetic subgroup within the bacterial B class of

group II introns [17,18], indicating that introns from
both subgroups are (or have been) intrinsically mobile
with their 3’ extension.
Identical 3’ extensions in divergent introns: independent
acquisition or high selection pressure?

In addition to providing evidence for mobility of the
group II introns carrying an extra domain, detailed
bioinformatic comparative analysis also revealed features
that may be relevant to the structural evolution of these
unusual introns. The first major feature is that divergent
introns can share identical 3’ extensions. This is case for
the B.th.I6-like introns, where B.th.I6 from various B.
thuringiensis strains and B.c.I16 from B. cereus Q1 and
F65185 are 90% identical overall and have identical 54nt extensions (Additional file 1: Figure S3A). Even more
remarkable are the related B.my.I1 and B.ps.I1 introns
from B. mycoides Rock1-4 and B. pseudomycoides DSM
12442, respectively, which also share a nearly identical
extension with B.th.I6, but are more divergent overall,
exhibiting only 60% nucleotide sequence identity to the
B. thuringiensis B.th.I6 intron in domains I-VI (Additional file 1: Figure S3B; note that even though strain
Rock1-4 is classified as B. mycoides, it actually belongs

to the B. pseudomycoides lineage in the B. cereus group
phylogenetic tree, see [18]). While the B.th.I6, B.c.I16, B.
my.I1, and B.ps.I1 introns all belong to the b phylogenetic subgroup, there is also a case of an identical extension shared by introns of different subgroups: the 53-nt
extension of Ba.sp.I2 from B. sp. A_2_57_CT2 (a subgroup) is identical to that of B.th.I5 from B. thuringiensis BGSC 4D1/HD1 and CT-43 (b subgroup; Additional
file 1: Figure S3C). The presence of the same 3’ extension in group II introns that otherwise show little conservation overall in the rest of their sequences could
suggest that the extension may have been acquired independently by the different introns. Alternatively, as
domain VII is important for the self-splicing reaction of
the unusual introns [17]; see below), this could imply
that there is a very strong selection pressure on the
extension for structural and/or functional reasons, as is
the case for domains V (the catalytic center of the ribozyme) and VI (containing the branchpoint), which, like
domain VII, are highly conserved in sequence among
introns of the B class (Additional file 1: Figure S3; [30]).
One may also hypothesize that the conservation of
domains V and VI could have favored homologous
recombination events that could have mediated the
transfer of domain VII between introns that are divergent in the rest of their sequences.
A novel group II intron with a longer 3’ extension of 70
nt in B. pseudofirmus

A second feature relating to the evolution of introns
harboring a domain VII is given by the B. pseudofirmus OF4 intron, named B.psf.I1. While the 3’ extra
segment of all other unusual introns is 53-56 nucleotide long, the extension of B.psf.I1 spans 70 bases (Figure 3). It is predicted to fold into a 2-stem-loop
structure (S1 and S2) similar to that of the B. cereus
group elements, and, interestingly, the pattern of
sequence and structure conservation between the
extensions of B.psf.I1 and the B. cereus group introns
is the same as that observed previously between the
latter introns [17]. That is, first, the small stem S1 is
highly conserved in sequence among all the unusual
introns, including B.psf.I1. Second, while the S2 stem
of B.psf.I1 is somewhat longer than that of the other
unusual introns and is not conserved overall, the invariant internal loop representing a putative 11-nt tetraloop receptor motif present in B. cereus group introns
[17] is identical in sequence in B.psf.I1, and is located
at the same relative position within S2, i.e., 3 bp from
the bottom of the stem (Figure 3). This conservation
underscores that this motif must be important for
intron structure and/or activity, as suggested by mutational analyses which showed that unpairing the G:C
pair beneath the internal loop triggered a significant

Page 6 of 12

slowdown of the second splicing step [17]. Therefore,
although being substantially longer, the 3’ extension of
the B. pseudofirmus B.psf.I1 intron shares all the features common to that of the other unusual introns and
shows that domain VII itself can undergo evolutionary
change while maintaining the key features.
The 3’ extension affects the splicing reaction differently
in introns from the a and b subgroups

The bioinformatic analyses presented above have given
examples of the structural evolution of group II introns
carrying a 3’ extension. As RNA structure and function
are intimately linked, in vitro mutational and kinetic
analyses performed using introns belonging to the a
and b phylogenetic subgroups revealed that these
introns also evolved at the functional level. We showed
previously that, while the B.c.I4 intron of B. cereus
ATCC 10987 (a subgroup) has adapted to function with
the 3’ extra domain, the extension was not essential for
splicing since the intron could splice nearly as efficiently
as wildtype (WT) when the entire extension was deleted
[24]. However, the deletion construct (B.c.I4_dS1S2)
appeared to produce somewhat more linear form of the
intron, suggesting more hydrolytic splicing without the
3’ extension [17,24]. In the present study, we conducted
time-course kinetic analyses of the self-splicing of the B.
c.I4 WT and dS1S2 constructs. These analyses confirmed that the linear form is not the major product of
the splicing reaction of WT B.c.I4, even in buffers containing KCl, which is known to promote the hydrolytic
splicing pathway [8-10]. In KCl buffer the linear species
only accounted for ~5% of the intron-containing products after 60 mins, whereas the fraction of free lariat
was ~70% (Figures 4B and 5B). In comparison, splicing
of the B.c.I4_dS1S2 construct produced a linear and lariat fraction of ~40% and ~45%, respectively, after the
same time period (Figures 4A and 5B). These results
demonstrate that the 3’ extension has a clear impact on
the balance between a hydrolytic or transesterification
reaction in the first step of splicing. This may imply that
the B.c.I4 intron with the 3’ extension is either less
prone to be hydrolyzed at the 5’ splice site or is more
efficient at branching. The bulged branchpoint adenosine in domain VI was therefore removed from the WT
and dS1S2 constructs to investigate whether the
increased hydrolysis of 5’ splice site for dS1S2 could still
be observed when there is no competition from this
nucleophilic adenosine and the branching pathway.
Comparison of the splicing of these two branchpointdeleted mutant constructs, B.c.I4_dA and B.c.
I4_dA_dS1S2, showed that the amount of free linear
intron produced was very similar (Figures 4C and 4D
and 5C). This suggests that the extension does not affect
the rate of hydrolytic splicing directly. A more likely

Figure 4 In vitro self-splicing of B.c.I4 and B.th.I6a wild-type (WT) and mutant constructs in KCl-containing buffer. (A) B.c.I4 deleted of
the entire 3’ extension (B.c.I4_dS1S2); (B) B.c.I4 WT; (C) B.c.I4 deleted of the entire 3’ extension and the branchsite adenosine (B.c.I4_dA_dS1S2);
(D) B.c.I4 deleted of the branchsite adenosine only (B.c.I4_dA); (E) B.th.I6a WT; and (F) B.th.I6a deleted of the entire 3’ extension (B.th.I6a_dS1S2).
Splicing was performed in 40 mM MOPS (pH 7.5), 500 mM KCl, and 100 mM MgCl2 at 47°C. Samples were separated on a 7 M urea 4%
polyacrylamide gel. The various splicing products are labeled on the sides. The weak bands corresponding to the linear forms of B.th.I6a (panels
E and F) are marked by arrowheads and were identified by size. “dS1S2” and “dA” refer to deletion of the entire 3’ extension or the branchsite
adenosine, respectively

I6a_dS1S2) also appeared to give an increased amount
of free linear intron in KCl-containing buffer (~10% as
opposed to 0% for WT; see Figures 4E and 4F and 5D),
in sharp contrast to B.c.I4, splicing of B.th.I6a_dS1S2 in
(NH4)2SO4 and KCl buffers showed a dramatic inhibition of the second splicing step. This was revealed by
the accumulation of the first step intermediate “lariat +
3’ exon” product compared to the B.th.I6a WT construct containing the extension (Figures 4E and 4F and
5D). The strong negative effect on the second splicing
step observed for B.th.I6a is remarkable and shows that,
unlike B.c.I4, B.th.I6a is dependent on the entire extension for efficient splicing. Together, this functional difference underlines that the two introns have adapted
differently to the presence of a similar extension. B.c.I4
and B.th.I6a belong to separate evolutionary branches
and exhibit sequence and structural differences that may
be the basis for the observed splicing properties related
to the extension.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the sequence, phylogenetic, and experimental data presented in this study have revealed that
the group II introns containing a 3’ extension and their
domain VII have had a dynamic relationship during evolution, both at the structural and functional levels. In
addition, the data provided indirect, but clear, evidence
that some of the unusual introns must be mobile with
their extra segment. Altogether, this warrants structural
and functional studies to better understand the

structure-function relationship in group II introns carrying a domain VII, and to investigate the role and impact
of the 3’ extension in the mobility reaction.

Methods
Sequence homology searches

The nucleotide sequences of the previously identified B.
cereus group introns carrying a 53/56-nt 3’ extension
[17-19] were used as queries to search the NCBI Genbank database [31] using BLASTN [32] for additional
group II intron ribozymes having a similar extension.
BLASTN was run with default parameters, except that
the nucleotide match reward was set to 2 (-r 2). The
genome sequence of B. thuringiensis kurstaki HD1 available at the Microgen website (Laboratory for Genomics
and Bioinformatics, University of Oklahoma Health
Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, USA; http://www.
micro-gen.ouhsc.edu/b_thuring/b_thuringiensis_home.
htm) was searched as well. Strain HD1 corresponds to
strain BGSC 4D1, whose genome has also been
sequenced by our laboratory and the Norwegian HighThroughput Sequencing Centre, University of Oslo,
Norway (O. A. Økstad and L. Nederbragt, unpublished
data). Introns were named following the nomenclature
used in the Group II Intron Database [30].
The 86 completely sequenced B. cereus group strains
publicly available in Genbank and Microgen at the time
of analysis were screened for the B.th.I6 intron’s host
gene, pXO1-42, using BLAST. The BLAST search was
conducted using the pXO1-42 sequence of the pXO1

of the branchsite adenosine only (B.c.I4_dA) or deleted of the branchsite adenosine and the entire 3’ extension (B.c.I4_dA_dS1S2) spliced in KCl
buffer; and (D) B.th.I6a WT and B.th.I6a deleted of the entire 3’ extension (B.th.I6a_dS1S2) spliced in KCl buffer. Splicing was performed in 40 mM
MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mM MgCl2 and either 500 mM (NH4)2SO4 (panel A) or 500 mM KCl (panels B, C, and D) at 47°C. The relative fractions of
released lariat intron were computed from the intensities of the radioactive bands using a phosphorimager. The values shown represent
averages with standard deviations of one replicate from two different RNA preparations

plasmid of B. anthracis Ames Ancestor strain (locus tag
GBAA_pXO1_0064) as query, and was performed both
at the amino acid and nucleotide levels (run with default
parameters, except E-value set to 0.01; -e 0.01).
An additional 36 isolates were screened by PCR, and
positive products were sequenced. PCR was performed
as previously described using the B.th.I6a_exon_left/
right and B.th.I6b_exon_left/right oligonucleotide primer
pairs [17]. Strains covering the phylogenetic diversity of
the B. cereus group were selected for screening, including strains closely related to those harboring B.th.I6 and
the B.th.I6-like B.c.I16 intron, based on the multiple
locus sequence typing (MLST) supertree of chromosomal housekeeping genes available in the SuperCAT
database at the University of Oslo’s typing website
([33,29]; http://mlstoslo.uio.no/).

Secondary structure predictions

The secondary structures of the B.ps.I1, B.psf.I1, and Ba.
sp.I2 intron RNAs (IEP-encoding ORF removed) were
computationally predicted by constrained folding using
the MFOLD 3.1 package [34,35] following the consensus
structures of group IIB (B class) introns [31,36]. That is,
conserved and identifiable sequence motifs corresponding to the consensus structures were forced during the
folding computation.
Phylogenetic analyses

Homologous pXO1-42 nucleotide sequences were
aligned using CLUSTALW 2 [37,38], followed by manual corrections done in SEAVIEW 4 [39,40]. A phylogenetic tree based on the multiple alignment was then
reconstructed using the Neighbor-Joining method [41]

Tourasse et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:564
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/564

applied to a matrix of pairwise distances between
sequences. Evolutionary distances were computed
according to Tamura’s 3-parameter model [42], which
takes into account multiple substitutions at a given site,
differences between the rates of transitions and transversions, and G + C content bias. For strains with completely sequenced genomes or plasmids (marked with
asterisks in Figure 1B) the full pXO1-42 sequence (~3.5
kb) was used, whereas a partial fragment of only ~400
bp that includes the homing site of B.th.I6-like introns
was available for the strains that were screened by PCR.
Thus, sites with gaps were removed in a pairwise manner when computing distances. Statistical support for
branches in the tree was assessed by 1000 bootstrap
replicates [43]. Phylogenetic analyses were done with
MEGA 4.0.2 software [44].
The chromosomal phylogeny of the B. cereus group
strains encoding the pXO1-42 gene was reconstructed
using the MLST data available in the SuperCAT database ([33,29]; http://mlstoslo.uio.no/). The data included
the nucleotide sequences of 7 to 26 chromosomal
housekeeping genes, depending on the strain. According
to information in culture collections, B. thuringiensis
kurstaki BGSC 4D1 and ATCC 33679 should be the
same strain and both correspond to strain HD1. However, typing studies revealed that the former two strains
exhibit genotypic differences [29,45]. Thus, the sequence
data for strains BGSC 4D1 and ATCC 33679 were
included in the phylogeny. A supertree of 1403 B. cereus
group isolates was reconstructed using the matrix representation by parsimony (MRP) technique as done in
SuperCAT (see [33] for details), and the subtree containing the 40 pXO1-42-encoding strains was extracted
from the supertree (pXO1-42 is also present in strains
AH1271, AH1272, AH1273, and AH717, however these
strains were not included in further analyses because
their genotyping data are conflicting, see [29]). In order
to obtain branch lengths that are proportional to numbers of nucleotide substitutions, branch lengths in the
supertree were recomputed using PHYML 3.0 [46,47]
and the Felsenstein-1984 nucleotide substitution model
[48] supplemented with a gamma distribution (F84 + Γ).
This model allows for unequal base frequencies, transition/transversion rate bias, and gamma-distributed substitution rate variation among sites. Statistical support
for branches in the supertree was assessed by approximate likelihood ratio tests with Shimodaira-Hasegawalike support values [33,46,49].

unlabelled RNA were conducted as previously described
[24].
In vitro self-splicing of ribozyme

In vitro generated transcripts were denatured and
refolded using a GenAmp 2700 PCR machine (Applied
Biosystems), by incubating the transcripts in 10 mM
MOPS, pH 7.5 at 90°C for 1 min, 75°C for 5 min, and
then slow cooling to the splicing temperature of 47°C.
Intron transcripts were spliced with 70000 cpm RNA or
~0.1 μg unlabelled transcripts in 40 mM MOPS, pH 7.5,
100 mM MgCl2, and either 500 mM (NH4)2SO4 or 500
mM KCl at 47°C. Reactions were initiated by adding
pre-warmed splicing buffer to the transcript RNA giving
a total reaction volume of 40 μl. At each time point of
the time-course analysis, 2 μl were taken out, quenched
with loading buffer (Ambion) and storing samples on
dry ice. Samples were then heated to 95°C and cooled
on ice, before being separated on a 7.5 M Urea 4% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were then vacuum dried, exposed,
and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860
Phosphorimager.
For subsequent RT-PCR and sequencing of these splicing products, either unlabeled spliced transcripts, purified with Nucleotide purification kit (Qiagen), or labeled
spliced transcript species, excised from gels, were used
as templates.
For kinetic analysis, the intensities of the radioactive
bands were quantified using the ImageQuant 5.0 software. The relative fractions of unspliced precursor and
free lariat RNA were computed from the intensities of
the radioactive bands of all intron-containing products.
