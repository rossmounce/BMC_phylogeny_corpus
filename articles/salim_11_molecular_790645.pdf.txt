based on ITS1 rDNA and RoTat 1.2 VSG gene in
the Sudan

Abstract
Background: Internal transcribed spacer one (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA is known to be a suitable target for PCRbased detection of trypanosomes. The analysis of this region provides a multi-species-specific diagnosis by a single
PCR. Using ITS1 primer-based PCR, a cross sectional study was carried out in the period from September to
November 2009 on samples collected from 687 camels from geographically distinct zones in the Sudan to detect
all possible African trypanosomes, which can infect camels.
Results: The results showed that all PCR-positive camels were infected with a single parasite species; Trypanosoma
evansi. The highest prevalence, 57.1% (117/205), was observed in the Butana plains of mid-Eastern Sudan and the
lowest, 6.0% (4/67), was in the Umshadeeda eastern part of White Nile State. In another experiment, the RoTat 1.2
gene encoding the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) of T. evansi was analyzed for its presence or absence by a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using T. evansi species-specific primers. The study showed that the RoTat 1.2 VSG
gene was absent in thirteen out of thirty T. evansi-positive samples.
Conclusions: It is concluded that camel trypanosomiasis in Sudan is apparently caused by a single parasite species
T. evansi and there were no other typanosomes species detected. In addition, the disease is highly prevalent in the
country, which strengthens the need to change control policies and institute measures that help prevent the
spread of the parasite. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular diagnosis report, which gives a picture of camel
trypanosomiasis covering large geographical areas in Sudan.

Findings
Trypanosoma evansi is the most widely distributed pathogenic animal trypanosome, affecting domesticated livestock in Asia, Africa, Central and South America, Europe,
and recently a case of human infection has been reported
in India making it a potential human pathogen [1].
In arid-semiarid areas in Africa (Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, Nigeria and French West Africa), camels
are affected most by the parasite. In Central and South
America, horses are the main hosts followed by cattle [2].
Trypanosoma simiae was identified as the cause of an
outbreak in dromedaries in a Kenyan national park, confirming the susceptibility of camels to this pathogen [3].
T. simiae was also documented as a camel pathogen in

Somalia [4]. Wernery and Kaaden [5] experimentally
confirmed that dromedaries were sensitive to T. brucei
and particularly to Trypanosoma congolense.
Many molecular markers are used to detect, differentiate and study trypanosome species. The rRNA internal
transcribed spacer one (ITS1) and internal transcribed
spacer two (ITS2), which are separated by the 5.8S gene
and flanked by the small subunit and large subunit
rRNA genes in most eukaryotes are subject to higher
evolutionary rates leading to greater variability in both
nucleotide sequence and length [6]. The ITS1 and ITS2
spacers have been found to be reliably valuable in more
discrete phylogenetic separation of closely related species including piroplasms and their subspecies [7-9] and
trypanosomes. Generally, the ITS region has been used
extensively in characterization of T. evansi [10-13]. The
ITS1 region has been successfully used as target for
PCR-based detection of trypanosomes by [14,15]. These

authors documented specific PCR product length corresponding to each Trypanosoma species, which was the
base of differentiation among Trypanosoma species. For
example, T. congolense savannah, an ITS1 PCR product
is 700 bp, 400 bp for T. simiae and 250 bp for T. vivax.
The product for T. evansi and T. brucei subspecies was
the same size, 480 bp. The variable surface glycoprotein
of trypanosomes RoTat 1.2 VSG is a predominant variant antigen type thought to be expressed in all T.
evansi stocks examined so far [16]. It has been used in
routine diagnostic antigen tests such as card agglutination test CATT/T. evansi, but negative CATT/T. evansi
reactions in T. evansi parasitaemic animals have been
reported [17,18]. Thereafter, it has been shown that a
number of T. evansi in Kenya were not detected by tests
based on RoTat 1.2 VSG gene and four of the isolates
lacking the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene [19].
Camel trypanosomiasis is of great concern to Sudan,
which possesses the second largest camel population in
the world being estimated at nearly 4,623,000 heads
(Annual Report of Ministry of Animal Resources and
Fisheries, Sudan, 2010). Although the disease is generally
believed to be caused by T. evansi, other species cannot
be ruled out pertaining to the wide distribution of hosts
and the various trypanosome species potentially present
in hosts, or vectors. Previous immunological studies
which were carried out in Sudan [20,21] would not be
able to survey camels for other trypanosome species,
and this an advantage of the ITS1-PCR method used
here.
We undertook this study to provide information on
the disease prevalence, its local enzootic situation and
the possible causative agents in camels from geographically distinct regions.
Sample collection

Blood spots on Whatman FTA® Card (Whatman, Inc.)
were collected in a surveillance conducted in autumn
2009 (September 20 to November 10). Camels were

sampled from four geographically distinct areas in
Sudan. The samples numbers and coordinates of their
collection locations are shown in Table 1 & Figure 1.
Microscopic examination and DNA extraction

A total of 687 blood samples were collected from camels
in FTA cards (Whatman FTA® Classic Cards, Whatman,
UK). Of these, 365 samples from Darfur were collected in
a way that each five were pooled onto one spot of the
FTA-card, which reduced the number of spots to 73 samples (Table 1). DNA was extracted from five punches to
ensure correct estimation of prevalence as shown by [22].
DNA was eluted from the FTA cards using a modified
methanol fixation method as described by [23]. Extracted
DNA samples were stored at -20°C until used.
PCR

Extracted genomic DNA of 687 samples were subjected to
a PCR test, which amplifies the ITS1 region of the rDNA
gene of all African trypanosomes by using ITS1 CF/BR
[14] FP: 5’-CCGGAAGTTCACCGATATTG-3’, RP: 5’TGCTGC GTTCTTCAACGAA-3’. The 480 bp PCR product was amplified using GoTaq® Colorless Master Mix,
2X (Promega Co. USA) in a 10 μl total volume. Each reaction included 5 μl GoTaq® Colorless Master Mix, 10 mM
of each primer, 1 μl RNase-free water and 2 μl extracted
DNA. Thermocycling profile started with initial hold for 2
min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 58°C
for 30 sec. and 72°C for 1 min and final extension step of
5 min. at 72°C. PCR products were electrophoresed in 2%
agarose Zebra (BioTools Inc, Japan) in (Tris-acetate
EDTA) buffer and stained using GelRed dye (Biotium, Inc.
Hayward, CA Biotium, Inc., USA) before being visualized
under UV light.
Thirty positive ITS1 T. evansi isolates were further
subjected to PCR test specific for T. evansi, in which a
primer set that amplifies 151 bp of the T. evansi RoTat
1.2 VSG gene fragment was used [24]. This was TeRoTat920F 5’-CTGAAG AGGTTGGAAATGGAGAAG-3’

lower prevalence of 6.0% (4/67) recorded in Umshadeeda (Table 1). Samples from Kassala showed prevalence of 24.0% (12/50) and those from South Darfur
showed prevalence of 35.6% (26/73) taken into account
that the actual number samples from Darfur was 356
samples (Table 1). Samples were first tested using agarose S electrophoresis for visualizing positive samples.
The presence or absence of fragment size differences in
the positive T. evansi samples was then tested by using
2% agarose Zebra (BioTools Inc, Japan) with high resolution capability of differentiating small base pairs differences. No size difference was observed in all samples
(Figure 2).
PCR amplification was carried out targeting RoTat 1.2
VSG gene on 30 ITS1-positive T. evansi indicated that
13 out of these were negative for RoTat1.2 (Figure 3A
and 3B). Figure 3A showed 16 samples from different
geographical regions, of which 3 samples were shown
RoTate 1.2 VSG negative. Figure 3B shown 14 samples
all from South Darfur, of which only 4 samples where
RoTate 1.2 VSG positive.
There was a significant difference in prevalence
between the regions. The prevalence of T. evansi was

profile were as mentioned above.
The differences in prevalences between different
regions were computed using the Chi-square test with

The ITS1-PCR performed to screen camels from four
regions in the Sudan (Figure 2), showed higher prevalence in Halfa “Butana region” of 57.1% (117/205) with

significantly higher in Halfa (Butana region) than in
Kassala and Umshadeeda (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006
respectively), while in Halfa (Butana region) the prevalence was significantly higher than in Umshadeeda (p <
0.001). The prevalence of T. evansi in South Darfur
(when assuming 1 in 5 camels infected) was significantly
different from Kassala and Halfa (Butana region) (p <
0.001 for both) but was not significantly different from
Umshadeeda (p = 0.733). In contrast, when assuming
that all the five camel pooled blood samples were
infected, the prevalence was found be significantly different from Halfa (Butana region) and Umshadeeda
region (p < 0.001 for for both), but not significant from
Kassala (p = 0.104).
The ITS1-PCR detection method constitutes a powerful molecular diagnostic tool for T. evansi detection and
discrimination from other trypanosomes in one PCR
that is currently available for molecular epidemiological
studies of pathogenic African trypanosomes.
Although camels are largely kept without close association with other animals and do not often share the same
husbandry conditions as cattle, nonetheless, they do
come into contact with donkeys, goats, sheep and horses
in the Sudan. The existence of carrier animals in the vicinity of susceptible camels makes transmission by biting
flies possible. Therefore, we hypothesized that we might
find additional species of trypanosmes apart from T.
evansi when using ITS1 CF and BR [14]. The ITS1 results
clearly revealed that all camels in the investigated areas
were infected with trypanosomes of the subgenus Trypanozoon, most likely T. evansi. Indeed, most samples were
also positive with RoTat 1.2 PCR, which is specific for T.
evansi. However, the possibility of finding tsetse transmitted trypanosomes in naturally infected camels still
cannot be excluded especially when animals are raised
within, or came into vicinity of other hosts within the
tsetse fly zone. This will need further investigations.
The higher prevalence rate which was detected in
Butana plains of mid-Eastern Sudan is in agreement
with the findings of Elamin et al. [21], who showed the
higher prevalence was in the dry season (November to
May) in the area. They also found that the parasitaemia
was higher in the dry season than in the wet season
(June to October) possibly due to the increased activity
of biting flies. Our study, which was carried during a
similar period (dry season, late September to November), supports the idea of congregation of camel herds
at the scarce water holes, which brings the animals into
close proximity and facilitates efficient transmission of
the parasite by the flies. Other factors which presumably
predispose to high infection and probably patent parasitaemia are prolonged drought and a low plane of nutrition during the later part of the dry season. It is worth
to mention that the dry season of 2009 was severe in

term of pasture availability. Conversely, lower prevalence
rates in camels from the Umshadeeda region, eastern
part of White Nile State, could be linked to the low fly
densities in these areas [25].
These data show that wet film studies detected a
much lower prevalences than the ITS1-PCR studies
reported here. This raises the question as to whether
these differences represent differences in sampling sites
or, more importantly, whether the wet film technique is
underestimating the prevalence of T. evansi infection in
camels in Sudan. This question still remains to be
addressed. In the case of Darfur, although the prevalence was not accurate because it was estimated per 5
samples, the current results could give an overview of
the disease status in the region.
The absence of RoTat 1.2 VSG gene from some T.
evansi in Sudan has an implication that direct card
agglutination test CATT/T. evansi based on the predominant variable antigen-type (pVAT) RoTat 1.2 VSG
gene has some drawbacks because a considerable number of positive cases will be missed. Most of RoTat 1.2
VSG gene negative samples found during this study
were from Darfur region, but also other regions have
shown T. evansi RoTat 1.2 VSG gene negative results.
Further investigations are required to examine the suitability of implementing RoTat 1.2 VSG gene PCR and
CATT/T. evansi in epidemiological surveys or diagnosis
of trypanosomiasis in Sudan.
In conclusion, the study showed out that only T.
evansi was detected in camels in the Sudan and no
other trypanosomes have been detected. In addition,
some samples tested negative by RoTat-PCR and positive by ITS1, so that ITS1-PCR is recommended.
