A highly conserved NB-LRR encoding gene cluster
effective against Setosphaeria turcica in sorghum
Tom Martin1*, Moses Biruma2,3, Ingela Fridborg1, Patrick Okori2 and Christina Dixelius1

Abstract
Background: The fungal pathogen Setosphaeria turcica causes turcicum or northern leaf blight disease on maize,
sorghum and related grasses. A prevalent foliar disease found worldwide where the two host crops, maize and
sorghum are grown. The aim of the present study was to find genes controlling the host defense response to this
devastating plant pathogen. A cDNA-AFLP approach was taken to identify candidate sequences, which functions were
further validated via virus induced gene silencing (VIGS), and real-time PCR analysis. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed to address evolutionary events.
Results: cDNA-AFLP analysis was run on susceptible and resistant sorghum and maize genotypes to identify
resistance-related sequences. One CC-NB-LRR encoding gene GRMZM2G005347 was found among the up-regulated
maize transcripts after fungal challenge. The new plant resistance gene was designated as St referring to S. turcica.
Genome sequence comparison revealed that the CC-NB-LRR encoding St genes are located on chromosome 2 in
maize, and on chromosome 5 in sorghum. The six St sorghum genes reside in three pairs in one locus. When the
sorghum St genes were silenced via VIGS, the resistance was clearly compromised, an observation that was
supported by real-time PCR. Database searches and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the St genes have a
common ancestor present before the grass subfamily split 50-70 million years ago. Today, 6 genes are present in
sorghum, 9 in rice and foxtail millet, respectively, 3 in maize and 4 in Brachypodium distachyon. The St gene
homologs have all highly conserved sequences, and commonly reside as gene pairs in the grass genomes.
Conclusions: Resistance genes to S. turcica, with a CC-NB-LRR protein domain architecture, have been found in
maize and sorghum. VIGS analysis revealed their importance in the surveillance to S. turcica in sorghum. The St
genes are highly conserved in sorghum, rice, foxtail millet, maize and Brachypodium, suggesting an essential
evolutionary function.

Background
The immune system has developed in a stepwise manner
by progressive sophistication of basic functions that helped
ancestral organisms to survive in their hostile environment. Recognition of pathogens in a species-specific way
results in the generation of a very robust mode of surveillance system in plants. This form of protection termed
resistance (R) protein-mediated or effector-triggered
immunity is induced when a plant encoded R protein
“perceives” the presence of a pathogen-derived effector
molecule, represented by specific avirulence (Avr) gene
products [1]. Following recognition of the pathogen, one

or more signal transduction pathways are induced in the
host plant and these lead to the prevention of colonization
by the pathogen.
The majority of characterized R proteins encode a
nucleotide-binding site (NB) and leucine-rich repeats
(LRR). NB-LRR-encoding genes make up one of the largest and most variable gene families found in plants, with
most plant genomes containing several hundred family
members [2-6]. The N-terminal ends of R-proteins are
predominantly composed of a TIR (Toll/Interleukin-1
Receptor) homologous domain or form a coiled-coil (CC)
motif. Monocots in particular, have numerous CC-NBLRR proteins in their genomes. Accumulating data suggest
furthermore that N termini of R-proteins may interact
with a range of pathogen-derived proteins. However, the
LRR domain may determine the final outcome of this

recognition, leading to downstream signaling and initiation
of defense responses [7].
Many R-genes are located in clusters that either comprise several copies of homologous sequences arising from
a single gene family or co-localized R-gene sequences
derived from unrelated gene families [8,9]. This genomic
make-up assists multiple proteins to become modified via
various genic and intergenic processes enabling rapid evolution and adaptation to changes in a pathogen genome
[10]. R-genes can also act in pairs [11,12]. The R-gene
pairs can differ in genomic location and protein domain
structure but also to their interaction with different pathogen isolates.
The heterothallic ascomycete Setosphaeria turcica (Luttrell) Leonard & Suggs (anamorph: Exserohlium turcicum,
former Helminthosporium turcicum) causes turcicum or
northern leaf blight disease on maize. This fungal pathogen also attacks sorghum and related grass species, for
example Johnson grass [13,14]. Turcicum leaf blight is one
of the most prevalent foliar diseases in most maize-growing regions of the world. The disease causes periodic epidemics associated with significant yield losses, particularly
under conditions of moderate temperature and high
humidity [15-17]. Resistance to S. turcica has mainly been
characterized in maize. S. turcica was earlier named
Helminthosporium turcicum and resistance has hitherto
been designated Ht and conferred by major race-specific
genes (Ht1, Ht2, Ht3 or HtN) or via partial resistance,
reviewed by Welz and Geiger [18]. In our work we
designate the new resistance genes as St referring to
Setosphaeria turcica.
Maize and sorghum are the most important staple cereals for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). While maize is an
introduced crop [19], sorghum is believed to have been
domesticated in SSA particularly in the Nile basin or
Ethiopia, as recently as 1000 BC [20]. Sorghum like many
other crop species experience large problems with plant
pathogens, particularly fungal diseases. Turcicum leaf
blight incited by S. turcica is one main problem [21].
This disease has been considered as of minor importance
in Uganda until 1988 when it caused extensive yield
losses on maize [22]. By introducing improved resistance
in new varieties the threat posed by the disease was subsequently reduced. Severe and sporadic outbreaks of turcicum leaf blight have now reappeared in East Africa
[23-25]. A change in the S. turcica population has been
suggested to be the main cause of this shift in disease
pattern. In order to detect potential new changes of the
S. turcica pathogen and the turcicum leaf blight disease,
a survey was undertaken in Uganda to examine the sorghum - S. turcica pathosystem in terms of disease severity and incidence, race patterns and new resistant
resources [26]. It can be concluded from those studies
that fungal isolates from sorghum could infect maize.

Upon cross inoculation on maize differential lines harboring different Ht genes, four S. turcica isolates were
identified as race 1, two as race 2, and one isolate corresponded to race 0 and race 3, respectively, whereas 10
isolates were unclassified. Highly resistant sorghum
accessions originating from a regional collection were
also identified.
In this work, we used cDNA-amplified fragment length
polymorphism (AFLP) on resistant and susceptible maize
and sorghum genotypes to identify differentially expressed
genes, when challenged with S. turcica. This was followed
by functional assessment of selected gene candidates by
virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) using a Brome mosaic
virus vector. We found one R-gene cluster, containing six
CC-NB-LRR encoding genes residing as three pairs in the
sorghum genome, of importance for defense to S. turcica.
Genome data further showed that the St genes are highly
conserved within monocots.

Results
Identification of an up-regulated R-gene family in maize
and sorghum in response to S. turcica inoculation

In order to identify important defense genes to S. turcica,
cDNA-AFLP analysis was carried out on susceptible (S)
and resistant (R) sorghum and maize genotypes following
fungal infection. In our case, the Ugandan sorghum genotypes GA06/18 (R) and Sila (S) and the maize A619Ht1
(R) and A619 (S) lines were used. The sorghum material
had earlier been evaluated on various agronomical traits
including important fungal diseases. Apart from S. turcica responses, GA06/18 was found to be susceptible to
Cercospora sorghi, and Colletotrichum sublineolum,
whereas Sila was susceptible to C. sorghi and resistant to
C. sublineolum.
In total, approximately 3000 transcript-derived fragments were monitored ranging from 50 to 600 bp in size
using different primer combinations (Additional file 1).
Unique, up- or down-regulated transcripts in the resistant
genotypes compared to the susceptible, sampled at 24, 48
and 72 hours post inoculation (hpi) were excised, amplified, sequenced and analyzed for putative function. The
final transcript-set comprised of 68 sorghum and 82 maize
gene candidates. Among these genes, 11 and 13, respectively, were putative stress-related according to closest
genes identified in other organisms using BLASTP.
One CC-NB-LRR encoding putative R-gene
(GRMZM2G005347), a member of a homologous gene
pair with GRMZM2G005452 in the same locus on chromosome 2, and uniquely expressed in the resistant maize
genotype, was further studied (Figure 1D). Genome analysis revealed presence of 6 homologous genes in sorghum
(Figure 1A). These six genes were given the prefix St referring to S. turcica and designated St1A (Sb05g008280), St1B
(Sb05g008140), St2A (Sb05g008350), St2B (Sb05g008030),

The six St genes in sorghum form three gene pairs in a
cluster on chromosome 5 and share a common ancestor
(Figure 1; Additional file 2; Additional file 3). St gene
orthologs were also found in clusters when searching
the rice, maize, foxtail millet and Brachypodium genome
databases. The St gene encoded proteins from the other
grass species, grouped with the sorghum St proteins
with high edge support (100) (Additional file 2). The
rice genome contains orthologs of sorghum St1A, St1B,
St2A, St2B and an St3 gene (Figure 1A, B). This indicates that the ancestor of rice and sorghum likely had a
copy of these genes. Sorghum St3A and St3B are likely a
result of a more recent genome duplication event after
the split between the rice and sorghum species (Figure
1G). The rice genome also contains multiple copies of

St3A (Sb05g008250), and St3B (Sb05g008270). Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed furthermore that five (St1A,
St2A, St2B, St3A and St3B) of the six St genes showed
high relative transcript levels when the sorghum resistant
GA06/18 plants were challenged with S. turcica (Figure 2).
One gene, St1B, was expressed to a much lower extent
compared to the other St genes, outside the limit of detection. In Sila, only St2B and St3A showed a significant
increase (P < 0.005) in expressions when challenged with
S. turcica (Figure 2).

St1A, St2A and St2B orthologs, likely produced from
gene duplications after the species split from sorghum.
Likewise, the Setaria italica (foxtail millet) genome contains orthologs of St1A, St1B, St2A and St2B, with seven
of the nine genes found in a cluster within the same
scaffold, as complete chromosome annotation have yet
to be determined (Figure 1C). An St3 homolog was not
found in millet. In addition to the maize gene pair identified in our cDNA-AFLP analysis, BLASTP and
BLASTN searches revealed a third single gene homolog,
GRMZM2G050959, St2A on maize chromosome 2 (Figure 1D). The model grass Brachypodium genome, on
the other hand, has a gene pair orthologous to St1B on
chromosome 4, and one to St2B on chromosome 5, but
lacks all other gene homologs (Figure 1E). The St gene
cluster is maintained between sorghum, rice and possibly millet genomes but is smaller in maize and Brachypodium with St genes located across or on different
chromosomes.
Sequence homology was also found between sorghum St
proteins and Arabidopsis CC-NB-LRR encoding genes
(Figure 3; Additional file 4). All six St proteins formed a
cluster together with the CC rather than TIR domain containing R proteins from Arabidopsis indicating a closer
evolutionary relationship as expected. The nearest related
Arabidopsis gene is RPM1, a gene mediating resistance to
Pseudomonas syringae isolates expressing the avrRpml or
avrB genes [27].

Adapting the VIGS system on sorghum

Genetic transformation of sorghum and maize is possible
but laborious and requires other genotypes than those
used in this study to be successful [28,29]. Hence, our
candidate genes were further studied using virus induced
gene silencing (VIGS) using the Brome mosaic virus
(BMV) system, previously used to silence genes in monocots [30]. VIGS was followed by fungal inoculation to
assess the potential defense function of the St genes. In
our hands, the VIGS procedure was not successful when
applied to the A619Ht1 maize genotype. Because the St
genes were up-regulated upon fungal inoculation with
S. turcica in our sorghum GA06/18 genotype (Figure 2),
we continued the studies on our sorghum materials.
Two VIGS constructs (1 and 2) with high identity to
the 6 St genes in sorghum were designed (Figure 4)
including examination for their off-target gene silencing
capacity. The highest non-St sorghum gene similarity
belongs to a related R-gene pair, Sb10g028720 and
Sb10g028730, located in a different subgroup upon phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 2), and used as a control for off-target gene silencing. The selected sequences
were amplified and ligated into the third plasmid
(pF13m) in the BMV system, and used to infect the sorghum plants.

Fungal colonization and growth on plants inoculated with
the different VIGS constructs compared with control
material was carefully monitored. The different phenotypic
observations are summarized in Figure 6; and Additional
file 5. Fungal growth was further assessed by detaching
infected leaves and placing them in a petri dish containing
moist filter paper followed by incubation in the dark at
25°C for two days, as described by Levy [31]. The development of conidiophores protruding through leaf lesions followed by rapid asexual spore development indicated
fungal colonization of the leaf material, and a susceptible
phenotype.
A hypersensitive response (small dark/red spots)
occurred at 2 dpi on the resistant GA06/18 genotype
upon fungal challenge while the plants treated with
empty vector produced a somewhat delayed HR phenotype 3 dpi. When VIGS construct 1 was applied to
GA06/18 plants prior to fungal inoculation, larger and
more numerous lesions with chlorotic halos developed
compared to the control plants. Disease lesions spread
laterally along the leaf and fungal conidiophores and
spores were produced under sporulating conditions.
Similarly, when the effect of construct 2 was assayed,
the disease lesions were seen 2 dpi and spread laterally
to form large lesions that produced large numbers of
fungal spores. The disease lesions were larger than those
induced by construct 1, at 7 dpi. On the susceptible Sila
plants clear disease symptoms, necrotic spots, and
chlorotic halos around fungal appressoria were seen

The VIGS procedure was first optimized. Sorghum
seeds were surface sterilized before sowing to minimize
additional stress by other microorganisms. mRNA was
produced by in vitro transcription, added to inoculation
buffer and rubbed directly onto the second leaf of three
week old sorghum plants. No intermediate step involving
barley as virus host was used. The virus spreads systemically throughout the plant with silencing greatest in the
second and third leaves above the inoculation site and
complete silencing rarely achieved [30]. Seven days post
infection (dpi), light green colored streaks were visible on
the third leaf, indicating viral symptoms and successful
infection by the virus. In order to confirm onset of silencing quantitative real time-PCR was carried out on leaf
samples from the VIGS treated plants (Figure 5). There
was a significant decrease in the relative transcript levels
in relation to control plants inoculated with empty plasmid suggesting a clear down-regulation of five of the six
targeted genes, particularly by construct 1, in both sorghum genotypes. Relative transcript levels of
Sb10g028720 and Sb10g028730 were not influenced in
VIGS treatments indicating no off-target silencing.

disease symptoms occurred 2 dpi. In contrast, on Sila
plants inoculated with our VIGS construct 1, slightly
larger and more frequent lesions appeared compared to
control plants. The disease symptoms were further
amplified when construct 2 was used, resulting in larger
necrotic lesions, and profuse fungal sporulation. In
order to correlate these observed disease phenotypes
with fungal growth, fungal DNA was quantified in the
VIGS materials (Figure 7). S. turcica DNA increased to
1.5 ± 0.4 pg/ng sorghum DNA in GA06/18 leaves
inoculated with VIGS construct 1, and to 3.6 ± 0.9 pg/
ng sorghum DNA when using construct 2, from a near
zero level in control plants (non-VIGS and empty vector). A significant (P < 0.005) increase in fungal DNA
was also found in samples from Sila inoculated with
construct 1 (1.2 ± 0.4 pg/ng sorghum DNA), and construct 2 (0.8 ± 0.9 pg/ng sorghum DNA), compared to
control samples with approximately 0.5 pg/ng sorghum
DNA.
Taken together, as expected the resistant GA06/18 genotype showed a compromised defense response when
inoculated with VIGS construct 1 or 2 prior fungal inoculation. Interestingly, we observed enhanced disease phenotypes on the susceptible Sila genotype upon corresponding
VIGS treatments.

Discussion
Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] serves as a
major food staple and fodder resource especially in arid
and semi-arid regions of the world [32]. It is mainly a
self-pollinating and diploid grass species (2n = 2x = 20),
with a genome size of 1C = 730 Mbp, which is about 25%
the size of the maize genome [4,5]. In the sorghum genome, 211 NB-LRR encoding R-genes are present, which
is approximately half the number found in rice and
slightly more compared to Arabidopsis [4]. The number
of NB-LRR encoding genes in the small genome of the
wild grass Brachypodium is estimated to 178 [6]. But in
the much larger maize genome, 95 NB-LRR encoding
genes have up to now been identified [33]. However,
depending on search programs and threshold settings,
slightly different R-gene numbers in each grass species
are published.
It is postulated that the high numbers of R-genes in
plant genomes and their large sequence diversity are
essential evolutionary factors in the surveillance machinery to resist pathogen attacks. Resistance genes evolve
through duplication, unequal crossing over, recombination and diversification leading to clusters of paralogous
genes [10,34]. The proliferation of R-genes is also
coupled with rapid turnover of gene copies, eventually

leading to deletion or expansion and thus dynamic Rgene clusters [33]. Resistance gene clusters have also
been found to be conserved between different species in
Poaceae [35], although, such clusters are in the minority
with 71.6% being specific to a species [33].
Whole genome duplications occurred when the grass
subfamilies diverged from each other and genome data
suggest further, that paleo-duplicated gene pairs in sorghum and rice remained extant in about 17% of the cases
[36]. Recent duplications of chromosomal segments are
particularly found on rice chromosomes 11 and 12, and
corresponding regions on chromosome 5 and 8 in sorghum. Chromosome 5, in the sequenced BTx623 sorghum genotype, where the St genes are located showed
the highest abundance (62) of R-genes [4]. Thirty-six of
these NB-LRR encoding genes are affected by recent
duplication events based on the bioinformatic analyses
presented by Wang et al. [36], including St3A and St3B,
which is in agreement with our results (Figure 1; Additional file 2). Interestingly, the rice genome contains
orthologs of St1A, St1B, St2A, St2B and a single ortholog
of the St3 genes, all in one single locus. This indicates
that this gene cluster predates the species split of rice
and sorghum. In the grass family, sorghum, maize and
millets belong to the same sub-family (Panicoideae),
whereas rice is located in Ehrhartoideae [37]. It is

estimated that these two subfamilies diverged from a
common ancestor 50-70 million years ago together with
Pooideae, the subfamily to which Brachypodium, wheat,
and barley belong.
In a genome-wide comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana
and A. lyrata, the evolutionary pattern of the R-genes
could be divided into two distinct groups, the positively
selected (> 50%) with high sequence divergence between
the two species, or the stably selected genes (< 30%) [38].
The remaining genes were only found in one genome and
absent from the other. The St genes found in this work
have experienced few sequence exchanges resulting in low
divergence, and hence more resemble the description of
stably selected genes, although the copy numbers vary
between the five grass genomes compared (Figure 1). That
NB-LRR encoded R-genes remain conserved between different grass species is presently believed to be a common
phenomenon [33].
Sorghum plants, particularly genotypes with red seed
color, accumulate a range of phenolic substances in
response to pathogen attacks [39]. Large amounts of redpigmented flavonoids induced at the site of infection were
also seen in our materials, particularly in the resistant genotype. Whether flavonoids contribute to the defense
response against S. turcica is not elucidated but a genetic
link has been found in the sorghum - C. sublineolum
interaction, produced via the presence of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins [40]. Reinforcement of plant cells via callose
deposition upon pathogen attacks have been observed in
many pathosystems. Enhanced callose deposition has also
been reported as a resistance response to S. turcica in
maize [41]. Despite extensive staining efforts, no callose
accumulation was seen in either of our sorghum genotypes
(data not shown).
Furthermore, our gene silencing work resulted in an
enhanced susceptible response in Sila, our susceptible sorghum cultivar. This observation may suggest that by targeting the St genes in this genomic background, effects on
downstream signaling masked in the resistant sorghum
genotype are revealed, and could potentially constitute a
fraction of the quantitative traits earlier found [41]. This
hypothesis is speculative and remains to be included in
future functional studies of the St genes. Future studies do
also comprise a search for important effectors in the genome recently released from JGI http://www.jgi.doe.gov. In
parallel, the sequence information from the St gene cluster
is presently converted into molecular markers and used in
germplasm assessments and breeding programs in East
Africa, an important development to sustain sorghum and
maize crop production in this part of the world.

Conclusions
Our cDNA-AFLP analysis on susceptible and resistance
maize and sorghum genotypes challenged by S. turcica

Martin et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:151
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/151

resulted in identification of a CC-NB-LRR encoding
gene in maize. This gene resides in two loci on maize
chromosome 2. In sorghum, 6 St orthologous genes are
present in a cluster of three pairs, on chromosome 5.
Upon gene-silencing of the sorghum St genes, the resistance was clearly compromised, an observation that was
supported by real-time PCR analysis and fungal DNA
quantification. Database searches and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the St genes have a common ancestor
present before the subfamily split, 50-70 million years
ago, and the genes are highly conserved in sorghum,
rice, foxtail millet, maize and Brachypodium.

Methods
Plant and fungal materials

Resistant (R) and susceptible (S) Sorghum bicolor genotypes from Uganda, GA06/18 (R) and Sila (S), and maize
lines A619Ht1 (R) and A619 (S) provided by USDA ARS,
were used in the study. The plants were grown in a growth
chamber (Percival) using a 12/12 h photoperiod at 22°C. A
single spore isolate from S. turcica infected sorghum (Ig1),
or infected maize (Mb1), collected from Iganga and
Mbale, Uganda, was used for all sorghum and maize analysis, respectively. The fungal DNA was extracted using a
modified CTAB method [42]. DNA was analyzed by using
S. turcica specific ITS1 and ITS2 primers (F -GCAACAGTGCTCTGCTGAAA and R-ATAAGACGGCCAACACCAAG). PCR was carried out using the following
conditions: 10 ng of template DNA was added to a 24 μl
mix consisting of H2O, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 μl Taq buffer
(Fermentas, Helsingborg, Sweden) 0.2 mM of each dNTP,
0.25 μM of forward and reverse primers and 1 U of Taq
polymerase (Fermentas) with: 3 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of
(1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, and 1.5 min at 72°C), and
final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products
were separated on 1% agarose gels to confirm fragment
size, (344 bp) followed by sequencing (Macrogen Inc.,
Seoul, Korea).
Fungal inoculation of plant material

Three-week old seedlings were inoculated on the third leaf
whorl with 25 μl conidia suspension (5 × 105 conidia/ml)
as described by Carson [43]. Inoculated leaves from three
to four plants were pooled and harvested at 24, 48, and
78 hours post inoculation (hpi) for cDNA-AFLP analysis.
Water treated control samples were harvested at the same
time-points.
RNA extraction and cDNA-AFLP analysis

Total RNA was isolated from the leaf samples using the
BioRad RNA isolation kit (BioRad, California, USA) followed by mRNA preparation with the mRNA capture kit
(Roche, California, USA). cDNA was synthesized with
Oligo-dT primer and RevertAid™ H Minus M-MuLV

Page 8 of 11

Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas). Second strand was
synthesized using E. coli DNA Polymerase I (Fermentas).
The double stranded cDNA was digested with BstY1 and
Mse1 (Fermentas) and ligated to respective adaptors, preamplified and later selectively amplified using the BstYI
+N (33P labeled) and MseI +N primers. Pre-amplification
was carried out with the adapter-ligated cDNA, Taq
DNA Polymerase (Fermentas) and the non-selective primers specific to the BstYI and MseI adapters using 25
cycles of 94°C for 30 s; 56°C for 1 min and 72°C for
1 min. The pre-amplified reaction mixture was diluted
600-fold and 5 μl was used for final selective amplification with 24 primer combinations, carried out with BstYI
+N (33P labeled) primers (Additional file 1) and touchdown amplification [44]. The selective amplification products were resolved on 6% polyacrimide gel run at
100 W until 4300 Vh was reached. Gels were dried and
exposed to Kodak Biomax film (Amersham Pharmacia,
California, USA) for 5-7 days.
Isolation and sequencing of transcripts

Approximately 150 transcripts (unique, up and downregulated) from the resistant genotypes in relation to the
susceptible genotypes, were excised from the dried PAGE
gels, eluted in H 2 O and PCR amplified using the nonselective primers under the same conditions as earlier
described in the pre-amplification step. The products were
cloned into the pJET 1.2 blunt vector (CloneJET™ PC,
Fermentas) and sequenced. The sequences were analyzed
using the BLASTN and BLASTX programs [45] and compared with sequences deposited in NCBI, GRAMENE and
PHYTOZOME databases. Identified fungal sequences
were excluded.
Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) in sorghum

The VIGS system used is based on the monocot-infecting
Brome mosaic virus (BMV) as previously described [30]
but pre-inoculation on barley was excluded. The BMV
VIGS vector consists of three plasmids harboring BMV
RNA1 (p1-1), RNA2 (p2-2) and RNA3 (pF13m, formally
pF3-5/13A/G), respectively. To generate VIGS constructs,
PCR fragments ranging from 246 to 253 bp in size were
amplified from the sorghum candidate gene using genomic DNA of the resistant GA06/18 genotype and genespecific primers harboring NcoI and AvrII restriction
sites using the Primer 3 version 0.4.0 http://frodo.wi.mit.
edu/primer3/ software (Additional file 6). Prior to PCR
amplification, off-target gene searches were undertaken
to design optimal VIGS constructs (Figure 4). After
restriction, each fragment was cloned into the corresponding site of the pF13m plasmid. The identity of the
inserts was verified by sequencing. P1-1, p2-2 and the
pF13m containing different constructs were digested
with SpeI, PshAI and PshAI, respectively. Infectious RNA

Martin et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:151
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/151

transcripts were synthesized from linearized plasmids
through in vitro transcription using T3 Polymerase (Fermentas), according to manufacturer instructions. 1 μl of
the reaction product was run on a 1.5% agarose gel to
confirm presence of a transcript.
Plant inoculation procedures were performed as
described [30] with slight modifications. A 10 μl aliquot of
the transcription mix from each of the plasmids p1-1, p22 and pF13m-insert was combined with 30 μl FES inoculation buffer and used directly to rub inoculate the second
and third leaves of 3-week-old sorghum and maize plants.
As a control, plants were inoculated in the same way with
water or combined transcripts from p1-1, p2-2 and empty
pF13m. Maize and sorghum plants were challenged with
S. turcica as earlier described one week after viral inoculation (when faint chlorosis and vein clearing started to
appear) to assess the effect of the different constructs.
Plants were randomized and coded to reduce potential
bias in the scoring of fungal colonization and growth.

Genome analysis

The amino acid sequences of St1A (Sb05g008280), St1B
(Sb05g008140), St2A (Sb05g008350), St2B (Sb05g008030),
St3A (Sb05g008250) and St3B (Sb05g008270) were aligned
to sorghum, maize, millet, rice, Brachypodium and Arabidopsis genome databases using BLASTN and BLASTP
(PHYTOZOME). Predicted domains were identified using
coiled-coil prediction [47]), LRRfinder [48] and CD-Search
[49]. St-like gene loci were identified using Genomic
Viewer (PHYTOZOME). Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using Treefinder and maximum likelihood and 10,
000 replicates [50]. The JTT+G model [51] was found to
best fit the data using ProtTest v2.4 [52]. Confidences
were calculated using local rearrangement of expected
likelihood weights (LR-ELW) [53]. Phylograms were
drawn using Treeview 1.6.6 [54].

Quantitative real-time PCR

Prior to fungal inoculation of the VIGS treated sorghum
plants, approximated 3 cm of the second leaf above the
VIGS inoculated leaf was collected from 3 independent
plants in triplicates for each condition and used for RNA
extraction as previously described. First strand-cDNA was
synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA, with Oligo-dT primer
and RevertAid™ H Minus M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was carried out using the first strand
cDNA in an iQ5 cycler (Bio-Rad). Maxima Sybr Green/
Fluorescein qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas) was used for
PCR amplification in a 20 μl total reaction volume consisting of 10 μl of SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix, 0.3 μM forward and reverse primers and 5 ng of cDNA template. All
PCRs were performed in triplicate under the following
amplification conditions; 10 min at 95°C followed by
40 cycles of 95°C, for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for
30 s, followed 1 min at 95°C, and melt curve analysis. Primers sequences for St genes were designed using the Primer 3 version 0.4.0 http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/
software (Additional file 7). The sorghum elongation factor 1-alpha (Sb02g036420) and Actin (Sb01g010030) were
used as reference genes and relative transcript values were
calculated. All calculations and statistical analyses were
performed as described in the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence
Detection System User Bulletin #2 (Applied Biosystems,
USA) slightly modified by Vetukuri et al. [46]. Quantification of S. turcica DNA on VIGS material 7 days post fungal inoculation was carried out as earlier described [41].
Approximately 3 cm of leaf material from three plants was
pooled and DNA extracted. Three biological samples per
treatment were analyzed. Statistical significance was calculated using Student’s t-test.
