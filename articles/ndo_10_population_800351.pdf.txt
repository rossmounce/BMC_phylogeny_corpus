Abstract
Background: Anopheles nili is a widespread efficient vector of human malaria parasites in the humid savannas and
forested areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding An. nili population structure and gene flow patterns could be
useful for the development of locally-adapted vector control measures.
Methods: Polymorphism at eleven recently developed microsatelitte markers, and sequence variation in four genes
within the 28s rDNA subunit (ITS2 and D3) and mtDNA (COII and ND4) were assessed to explore the level of genetic
variability and differentiation among nine populations of An. nili from Senegal, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Nigeria,
Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Results: All microsatellite loci successfully amplified in all populations, showing high and very similar levels of genetic
diversity in populations from West Africa and Cameroon (mean Rs = 8.10-8.88, mean He = 0.805-0.849) and much lower
diversity in the Kenge population from DRC (mean Rs = 5.43, mean He = 0.594). Bayesian clustering analysis of
microsatellite allelic frequencies revealed two main genetic clusters in the dataset. The first one included only the
Kenge population and the second grouped together all other populations. High Fst estimates based on microsatellites
(Fst > 0.118, P < 0.001) were observed in all comparisons between Kenge and all other populations. By contrast, low Fst
estimates (Fst < 0.022, P < 0.05) were observed between populations within the second cluster. The correlation
between genetic and geographic distances was weak and possibly obscured by demographic instability. Sequence
variation in mtDNA genes matched these results, whereas low polymorphism in rDNA genes prevented detection of
any population substructure at this geographical scale.
Conclusion: Overall, high genetic homogeneity of the An. nili gene pool was found across its distribution range in
West and Central Africa, although demographic events probably resulted in a higher level of genetic isolation in the
marginal population of Kenge (DRC). The role of the equatorial forest block as a barrier to gene flow and the
implication of such findings for vector control are discussed.
Background
The recent shift in strategic emphasis from malaria control to elimination and eradication has highlighted major
gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed before such
achievement is contemplated [1-3]. Vector control is a
cornerstone of malaria prevention strategies and it has
been widely acknowledged that renewed efforts in this
field should be considered a central aspect of the new
malaria eradication strategy [4-6]. Basic knowledge in

mosquito vectors biology, ecology and genetics is crucially needed for the development of innovative, integrated and biologically lucid vector management
strategies. This is especially true in the malaria heartlands
of sub-Saharan Africa, where a number of mosquito species efficiently transmit malaria to humans simultaneously, or replace each other seasonally sustaining yearround transmission [7-9]. Any strategy aiming at reducing transmission down to the level where elimination is
within reach will need to transcend the relevant biodiversity of the malaria vector system. However to date, most
studies in Africa focused on Anopheles gambiae s.l. and,
to a lesser extent, Anopheles funestus whereas research on

other important vectors has critically lagged behind.
Here, the first results of a large-scale population genetics
analysis of the level and distribution of (neutral) genetic
diversity in the mosquito Anopheles nili are presented.
Anopheles nili is a widespread efficient vector of Plasmodium parasites in the humid savannas and forested
areas of sub-Saharan Africa [9-14]. It is the nominal taxon
of a group of closely related species including An. nili
sensu stricto, Anopheles somalicus, Anopheles carnevalei
and Anopheles ovengensis [7,15]. The members of this
group can be distinguished through slight morphologic
diagnostic characters observable at the larval and/or
adult stages [15,16] and a molecular diagnostic tool based
on segregating sequence differences in the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
[17]. Of these four species, An. nili s.s. (hereafter An. nili)
is the most important malaria vector although An. carnevalei and An. ovengensis have been found infected with
Plasmodium falciparum in natural conditions [9,15,18].
Anopheles somalicus is mainly zoophilic and is not
involved in human malaria transmission [19,20]. Infection rates reaching 3% have been observed in An. nili and
the species was shown to sustain entomological inoculation rates over 200 infected bites per man per year in villages close to fast running streams and rivers where its
larvae develop [9-11,18]. Recent investigations of the ecological requirements of An. nili in Cameroon, a country
in Central Africa at the core of the species range, showed
that lotic rivers exposed to sunlight, with vegetation or
debris were the best predictors of An. nili larval abundance [21] and that habitats characterized by high water
vapor pressure and rainfall, as typically observed in forest-savanna transition areas were of highest quality for
the development of the species [14]. Anopheles nili however is scarce in deep forest environments, where it is
replaced by other members of the group, namely An. carnevalei and An. ovengensis [18,21]. The strong reliance of
An. nili on permanent aquatic habitats for larval development suggests a patchy geographic distribution throughout the species' range, owing to the discontinuous nature
of the hydrographic networks. This may lead to significant population genetic structure and behavioural differentiation. However, to date, very few studies have
addressed the level and extent of genetic structuring
within and between An. nili populations in sub-Saharan
Africa. Sequence variation in two nuclear loci within the
rDNA cluster (e.g., ITS2 and D3 domain in the 28S rDNA
subunit, [17]) and isoenzymes [22] did not reveal any signature of genetic heterogeneity among An. nili populations collected throughout south Cameroon. However,
the low polymorphism of the genetic markers used and
the limited geographical scales covered by these studies
precludes extrapolation of these findings outside of the
study area and calls for further investigations.

Here, genetic polymorphism in An. nili was investigated and compared among collections from nine locations from throughout its distribution range in West and
Central Africa using 11 recently described nuclear microsatellite DNA markers [23] and sequence variation in two
nuclear (rDNA) and two mitochondrial (mtDNA) genes.
It is shown that recently developed microsatellite markers
are suitable tools to explore the population genetic structure of wild An. nili in Africa. All molecular markers suggested that An. nili populations from West Africa are
genetically homogeneous with very low levels of genetic
differentiation between them, whereas the rainforest
domain in Central Africa might act as a geographical barrier to gene flow. Implications of these findings for vector
control are discussed and areas for future research are
highlighted.

Methods
Mosquito sampling and field processing of specimens

Mosquitoes were collected between June 2006 and March
2008 in nine localities across six countries from West and
Central Africa (Figure 1), including Kedougou (12°38'N,
12°14'W) in Senegal, Soumousso (11°01'N, 4°03'W) in
Burkina Faso, Gansé (8°37'N, 3°54'W) in Ivory Coast,
Akaka (6°58'N, 3°44'E) in Nigeria, Simbock (3°49'N,
11°28'E), Mbébé (4°10'N, 11°04'E), Magba (5°57'N,
11°13'E) and Tibati (6°28'N, 12°36'E) in Cameroon and
Kenge (5°19'S, 19°58'E) in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC). All these sites are located along different
river systems in humid savanna areas except Simbock and
Mbébé situated in the degraded forest area of southern
Cameroon. The closest localities were Simbock and
Mbébé situated 60 km apart, and the most distant ones
were Kedougou and Kenge situated c.a. 3,000 km apart
(Figure 1).
Anopheline female mosquitoes were collected by
human landing catches and/or indoor pyrethrum spray
catches. In the field, An. nili s.l. specimens were visually
sorted from other anophelines according to morphological identification keys [19,24]. All specimens were stored
individually in tubes containing a desiccant. All tubes
were kept at -20°C until further analysis.
DNA extraction and molecular identification

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole mosquito using
a standard protocol described earlier [25]. Since distinction between members of the An. nili group is often difficult in the field because of very slight and stage-specific
diagnostic differences between species, the molecular
diagnostic PCR-based assay [17] was then performed to
confirm morphological identification. Only An. nili mosquitoes were included in the analysis.

Microsatellite genotyping and analysis

Anopheles nili mosquitoes were genotyped at eleven microsatellite loci (Table 1) [23]. All microsatellite loci are
dinucleotide repeats. One primer of each pair was labeled
with a 5' fluorescent dye (NED, PET, VIC or 6-FAM) to
allow multiplex electrophoresis. PCR amplifications were
carried out in 15 μL reaction volume from approximately
2 μL of template DNA (1/50 of the crude extract). The
reaction mixture contained 1× PCR buffer (5 Prime Inc.,
Gaithersburg, USA), 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP,
8 pmoles of each primer and 0.15 unit of Taq DNA Polymerase (5 Prime Inc.). Amplification runs were performed under the following conditions: an initial
denaturation step at 94°C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles
of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at the appropriate annealing temperature (52°C to 56°C, see [23]) and 30 s at 68°C, followed by
a final elongation step of 20 min at 68°C. PCR products
were pooled with other compatible products according to
allele size range and fluorescent dye. Mixtures were run
on an ABI 3130XL DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, USA) using 500 Liz internal size standard.
Fragments (allele) sizes and genotypes were scored using
GENEMAPPER V4.0 software (Applied Biosystems).

Genetic diversity by locus, within each geographical
population and overall was assessed by estimates of allelic
richness [26] and allelic frequencies using FSTAT V2.9.3
[27]. Allelic richness was used instead of the number of
alleles per locus to account for differences in sample
sizes. Estimates of expected heterozygosity under HardyWeinberg equilibrium [28] were obtained using
GENETIX V4.02 [29].
Goodness-of-fit to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) for each locus and linkage disequilibrium
between all pairs of loci were assessed using FSTAT, for
each geographical population and overall. Whether deviations from HWE resulted from a deficit or an excess of
heterozygotes was tested using F-statistics [30]. Significance tests were conducted using a randomization
approach as implemented in FSTAT. The frequency of
null alleles at each locus within each population was
determined using GENEPOP V4.0 [31,32], and the allele
and genotype frequencies were then adjusted accordingly
in MICROCHECKER V2.2.3 [33]. The null allele adjusted
dataset was compared to the original dataset to explore
the effect of null alleles on estimations of genetic differentiation.

To investigate biased genetic differentiation caused by
demographic instability such as bottlenecks and/or population expansion, heterozygosity tests were implemented
to test for Mutation-Drift Equilibrium (MDE) using
BOTTLENECK V1.0.02 [34]. BOTTLENECK compares
two estimates of expected heterozygosity, one based on
allele frequencies (He) and the other based on the number of alleles and sample size (Heq). In a population at
MDE, both estimates should not differ significantly (He ≈
Heq). If a population experiences a bottleneck, rare alleles
will be lost by genetic drift, and Heq will decrease faster
than He (He > Heq). The resulting apparent excess of
heterozygotes is an indicator of recent bottleneck event,
whereas the opposite (He <Heq) may signal an expansion
process. Estimates of Heq were computed using two
mutation models for microsatellites evolution: the TwoPhased Mutation model (TPM) [35] with fractions of
multistep mutations set to 30%, 20% and 10%, and the
Stepwise Mutation Model (SMM) [36]. Wilcoxon signedrank tests were used to determine whether deviations
from MDE were statistically significant.
Population genetic differentiation was measured by the
fixation index Fst [30,37] and statistical significance was
assessed by the exact test of genotypic differentiation
available in FSTAT. Isolation by distance was investigated
as a potential cause of genetic structuring using the Mantel test implemented in GENEPOP. The correlation
between pairwise genetic differentiation and geographical distance was assessed by the regression of Fst/1-Fst on
the logarithm of geographical distances between sampling sites [38]. The Bonferroni correction was used
throughout to account for multiple testing [39].

Finally, a Bayesian clustering analysis was carried out
using STRUCTURE V2.1 to cluster individuals into K
groups while minimizing Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and gametic phase disequilibrium between loci
within groups, with no a priori assumptions [40,41]. The
software was run with the option of admixture, allowing
for some mixed ancestry within individuals, and α was
allowed to vary. Ten independent runs were done for each
value of K (1 to 5), with a burn-in period of 100,000 iterations and 100,000 replications. The method implemented
by Evanno et al [42] was used to estimate the most likely
number of clusters in the dataset.
DNA sequencing and analysis

Sequence variation was examined in the second Internal
Transcribed Spacer (ITS2) and Domain-3 (D3) of nuclear
28S rDNA, and in the Cytochrome oxidase subunit II
(COII) and the NADH deshydrogenase subunit IV (ND4)
genes on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Ten specimens
per sites, among those used for microsatellite analysis,
were randomly selected for sequencing. The ITS2, D3,
COII and ND4 regions were amplified in 25 μL reaction
mixtures containing 2.5 μL of 10× reaction buffer (QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France), 200 μM of each dNTP
(Eurogentec, Angers, France), 0.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, and 10 pmol each of the forward and reverse
primers. ITS2 and D3 rDNA regions were amplified using
the primers sets ITS2a/ITS2b and D3a/D3b described in
Kengne et al [17]. COII and ND4 were amplified using
the following primers:

measures of divergence were computed using DnaSP
V4.10.9. [45]. Statistical tests of Tajima [46], Fu and Li
[47] and Fu [48] also implemented in DnaSP were used to
test for non neutral evolution and deviation from MDE.
Phylogenetic relationships between An. nili haplotypes
were inferred in NETWORK V4.5.1.0 software to create
an unrooted haplotype network, using star contraction
[49].

Results
Microsatellite analysis
Genetic diversity

Genotypes at 11 microsatellites loci were analysed in a
total of 341 An. nili specimens originated from nine localities in six countries across West and Central Africa (Figure 1, Table 1). Individual genotypes are available upon
request to the corresponding author. All loci amplified
successfully and were highly polymorphic in all populations. Mean allelic richness (Rs) across populations
ranged from 5.04 at locus 2C157 to 12.62 at locus F41,
and average expected heterozygosity (He) across all samples ranged from 0.621 at locus A14 to 0.929 at locus
1A27 (Table 1). Populations from West Africa and Cameroon displayed very similar mean allelic richness (Rs =
8.10-8.88) and mean expected heterozygosity (He =
0.805-0.849) (ANOVA: P > 0.05). Both estimates were significantly lower (ANOVA: P < 0.05) in the Kenge population from DRC (Rs = 5.43, He = 0.594) (Table 1).
Departure from HWE (P < 0.05 after correction for
multiple testing) were detected in 8 of 11 (72.72%) loci
when all samples were pooled and considered as a single
gene pool. All significant deviations were associated with
a deficit in heterozygotes (positive values of Fis), suggesting population substructure (Table 1). When samples
were split into geographical populations, 11 tests of 99
(11%) remained significant after the sequential Bonfer-

Page 6 of 13

roni procedure was applied. Three loci 1A27, A154 and
A14 were particularly involved in nine of these deviations. No deviation was detected in three of the four samples from Cameroon (Magba, Mbebe and Simbock). The
populations from Burkina Faso and Senegal with three
deviations each had the highest number of loci out of
HWE. All these deviations were attributed to the presence of null alleles, with frequency of unobserved alleles
ranging from 0.088 to 0.184 in loci with significant
heterozygote deficiency (see Additional file 1). However,
null alleles did not significantly bias our interpretation, as
re-analysis of adjusted datasets returned similar results.
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) tests were performed
between all pairs of loci in all populations. Out of 495
comparisons, 7 (1.41%) were found significant at the single test level (P < 0.05): one in Gansé (1F43 × 1G13) and
Kenge (A154 × F56), two in Simbock (1A27 × F41 and
F56 × 1G13) and three in Tibati (2 Ateta × F56, A154 ×
B115 and 2C157 × 1G13). None of these tests remained
significant after the sequential Bonferroni procedure was
applied. These results suggest that loci segregate independently and confirm that null alleles are the most likely
cause of the heterozygote deficiencies observed. Accordingly, all loci were included in the analysis and each geographical population was considered as a panmictic unit.
Heterozygosity tests were performed to explore demographic stability in An. nili populations and compliance
to MDE. No signature of a recent bottleneck event was
detected in any population. However, significant deviations (P < 0.01) from MDE which may suggest population
expansion (He < Heq) were found in all populations
under the SMM. In Kenge, deviations associated with
strong heterozygote deficiencies were detected under all
mutation models (Table 2).
Population genetic structure and isolation by distance

A Bayesian clustering analysis performed with the software STRUCTURE revealed that the most likely number
of genetic clusters in the dataset is 2. The first cluster
included the sample from Kenge (DRC) and the second
cluster grouped together all other samples (Figure 2).
Clustering analysis was repeated without the Kenge population to examine whether any further sub-structuring
was present within the second cluster and did not detect
any additional sub-structuring.
All populations displayed similar allele profiles, with a
lack of rare alleles in the An. nili population from Kenge,
which appeared highly differentiated from the rest (Table
3). High Fst estimates (Fst = 0.119-0.153, P < 0.001) were
observed between this population and all the other ones.
In contrast, low genetic differentiation (at least one order
of magnitude lower) was detected among the remaining
populations (i.e., within cluster 2 identified above). To
verify whether genetic differentiation between Kenge and
the rest was specific to particular loci, jackknifed Fst esti-

In total, 76 sequences were generated for ITS2 and D3
each. These sequences perfectly matched those published
by Kengne et al. [17]. Of the 451 bp of ITS2, no variable
sites were found, whereas only one variable site (mutation) was found in one specimen in Kenge (DRC) among
the 392 pb of the D3 domain (GenBank Accession Number:GU947798). These results are consistent with the fact
that all An. nili populations analysed belonged to the
same taxonomic unit.

This analysis provided consistent results reflecting
homogeneity of Fst estimates across the set of loci (Table
4).
Because geographical isolation is often the main force
driving population differentiation, the level of genetic differentiation which could be attributable to the geographical distance between collection sites was assessed using
Mantel tests. A positive and significant correlation was
found between Fst/(1-Fst) and logarithm of geographic
distance (Mantel test: P < 0.05) when all samples were
included in the analysis (Figure 3), suggesting that geo-

The nucleotide sequence was determined along 603 bp of
the COII gene (coding region) in a total of 78 individual
mosquitoes. In addition, a fragment of 320 bp within the
coding region of ND4 gene was obtained for 84 mosquitoes. All segregating sites and the sequence variants (haplotypes) are shown in Figure 4 and summary statistics for
both genes are given in Table 5.
Overall, low polymorphism was found in both mitochondrial genes. Across the whole dataset, there were
only 6 (0.99%) and 8 (2.5%) polymorphic sites for COII
and ND4, respectively. This low number of variable sites
resulted in low nucleotide diversity (π < 0.001 in all samples, Table 5) and low haplotype diversity (hd < 0.42,
Table 5) across samples. Among the 78 COII sequences,
seven haplotypes (overall hd = 0.375) were found and
three of them appeared in a single copy (singleton) in the
dataset. The most frequent haplotype was identical to the
reference sequence published by Marshall et al [50] (GenBank Accession Number: DQ069720). GenBank Accession numbers for the other 6 COII haplotypes are

again suggested recent population expansion.

Discussion
This is the first study using microsatellite markers to
explore An. nili population genetic structure. All loci successfully amplified in each population and were highly
polymorphic compared to the isoenzyme markers previously used [22]. This is consistent with previous studies
comparing microsatellite to isoenzymes markers in
anophelines species [e.g., [51-53]]. Likewise, microsatellite loci were more polymorphic than the rDNA and the
mtDNA genes used in this study. This pattern may reflect
the small sample sizes used for sequencing and/or insufficient resolution of the molecular markers [54]. Moreover,
a biological process such as different evolutionary rates of
the markers or locus/region-specific selective constraints
could also be involved [55,56]. Nonetheless, despite this
heterogeneity in overall polymorphism across molecular
markers, the same trends emerged whereby An. nili populations from West and Central Africa (i.e., from Senegal
to Cameroon) appeared genetically homogeneous,
whereas mosquitoes sampled in DRC were highly differentiated from the species' core populations. In addition,

although individual inferences were rather weak, all
markers showed a pattern of diversity and distribution of
molecular polymorphisms that is consistent with recent
demographic expansion of An. nili throughout its distribution range in West/Central Africa.
Genetic homogeneity within the rDNA genes is not
surprising, given the particular evolutionary dynamics of
the rDNA operon subject to concerted evolution [e.g.
[57]], rendering it extremely useful for the resolution of
deep phylogenies and/or to distinguish between cryptic
species but conversely, of little use for within-species
population genetics analysis [55,58]. Mitochondrial DNA
evolves faster than the nuclear genome and has been
widely used for population genetics and phylogenetics,
including arthropod vectors of human diseases
[54,55,59]. Because of strongly biased AT content, this
non-recombining molecule is however subject to saturation, leading to a rapid lost of phylogenetic signal through
homoplasy [55,59]. On the other hand, its lower effective
population size (1/4th that of nuclear markers due to
maternal inheritance and haploidy) together with
increased selection against slightly deleterious mutations
[60] can rapidly increase divergence between lineages
within species and reduce local genetic diversity due to

enhanced genetic drift and/or molecular hitchhiking
resulting in selective sweep throughout the mitochondrial genome [61,62]. This is in agreement with increased
differentiation of the An. nili population from DRC
observed with both mtDNA genes. Apparent segregation
of different haplotypes between these two genetic clusters in An. nili prompts for further investigation to
increase sample sizes and the geographic span of sampling eastwards and southwards of the present study area.
Reduced variability and increased differentiation of the
DRC population was also detected using nuclear DNA
microsatellite markers. Within each geographical population, HWE was generally respected. Evidence for null
alleles at certain loci, as formerly observed by
Berthomieu et al [23], did not obscure the pattern of differentiation between populations, suggesting the set of
loci used in this study were able to capture the main patterns of genetic variability within the dataset. Extensive
allele sharing between populations and homogeneity
across loci in the level of genetic differentiation suggests
enhanced genetic drift in the DRC population, rather
than selection was responsible of the pattern observed.
Unfortunately, the chromosomal locations of the markers
remain unknown in the absence of a reliable chromo-

somal map for An. nili but linkage equilibrium between
markers suggests that they are, at least statistically independent and the results might reflect a genome-wide pattern. Reduced variability and increased differentiation is
typically observed in populations leaving in marginal
habitats at the edge of species' ranges [63] and the
sparsely populated evergreen forest block of Central
Africa is known to be of low overall quality for the development of An. nili which is more frequent at the savanna/
forest ecotone [14,21]. Deviation from MDE observed
under a range of mutation models in this isolated population indeed suggests unstable demography, although no
evidence for a recent bottleneck was obtained. All molecular markers suggested recent demographic expansion in
the Kenge and, to a lesser extent, in all other An. nili populations sampled. Detection of this pattern in multiple
independent loci make it possible to distinguish it from
the effect of selection, which is locus-specific, and attribute it to past demographic change. This is reminiscent
of the situation observed in other major vectors of human
malaria in Africa and elsewhere [64], and prompts for
further studies to disentangle the confounding effect of
shared ancestral polymorphism from that of ongoing
gene flow between geographical populations [59]. Moreover, the role of the evergreen forest block as a geographic barrier to gene flow between An. nili populations
needs to be further explored, given the low dispersal ability of this mosquito in this environment [65]. Clearly,
extending the sampling area eastwards and southwards is
needed to provide an overall picture of the level and distribution of genetic diversity within An. nili throughout
its distribution range on the continent, and identify both
geographic barriers that prevent gene flow between populations and areas of extensive gene exchange as seems to
be the case throughout West Africa. Such knowledge is
needed to devise efficient, locally adapted and sustainable
strategies for the management and control of these vector
populations. It is interesting to note that recent investigations of the population genetic structure of An. moucheti
sampled in the same localities as presented here (at least
in Cameroon and the DRC) did not detect such high level
of population differentiation within and across the forest
block [53,66]. Combined analysis of genetic and ecological data in a comparative framework should reveal further insights into the population biology and
demographic history of these neglected malaria vectors,
and provide relevant information for their control. Recent
advances in theoretical population genetics and the rapidly evolving field of spatial genetics [e.g., [56]] together
with the development and democratization of high
throughput sequencing technologies provide the necessary tools for such endeavor in non model species.
