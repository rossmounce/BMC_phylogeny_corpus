Evidence for positive selection in the gene
fruitless in Anastrepha fruit flies
Iderval S Sobrinho Jr*, Reinaldo A de Brito

Abstract
Background: Many genes involved in the sex determining cascade have indicated signals of positive selection and
rapid evolution across different species. Even though fruitless is an important gene involved mostly in several
aspects of male courtship behavior, the few studies so far have explained its high rates of evolution by relaxed
selective constraints. This would indicate that a large portion of this gene has evolved neutrally, contrary to what
has been observed for other genes in the sex cascade.
Results: Here we test whether the fruitless gene has evolved neutrally or under positive selection in species of
Anastrepha (Tephritidae: Diptera) using two different approaches, a long-term evolutionary analysis and a
populational genetic data analysis. The first analysis was performed by using sequences of three species of
Anastrepha and sequences from several species of Drosophila using the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
rates of evolution in PAML, which revealed that the fru region here studied has evolved by positive selection.
Using Bayes Empirical Bayes we estimated that 16 sites located in the connecting region of the fruitless gene were
evolving under positive selection. We also investigated for signs of this positive selection using populational data
from 50 specimens from three species of Anastrepha from different localities in Brazil. The use of standard tests of
selection and a new test that compares patterns of differential survival between synonymous and nonsynonymous
in evolutionary time also provide evidence of positive selection across species and of a selective sweep for one of
the species investigated.
Conclusions: Our data indicate that the high diversification of fru connecting region in Anastrepha flies is due at
least in part to positive selection, not merely as a consequence of relaxed selective constraint. These conclusions
are based not only on the comparison of distantly related taxa that show long-term divergence time, but also on
recently diverged lineages and suggest that episodes of adaptive evolution in fru may be related to sexual
selection and/or conflict related to its involvement in male courtship behavior.

Background
Several genes related to reproduction have shown higher
rates of divergence than other genes in the genome
[1,2]. This fast differentiation has been explained most
often by positive selection mediated by sexual selection
and/or sexual conflict [1,3,4], though some have suggested relaxed selective constraints [5,6]. Because these
genes show high levels of divergence and may possibly
be directly involved with reproductive isolation, some
authors have suggested that such genes may be the best
candidates to distinguish species that diverged recently
and should actually be considered speciation genes [7,8].

Most evolutionary studies on genes related to sex differentiation have focused on a portion of those rapidly
evolving genes involved in fertilization or male-female
interaction and only a few on the genes responsible for
sexual differentiation themselves. In Diptera, transformer
(tra) and doublesex (dsx) are two of the main genes that
control sexual differentiation that have been studied
[5,9-11]. Another important gene in the sex-determination cascade is fruitless (fru), which controls the male
courtship behavior by the establishment and development of a male-specific neuronal circuitry [12-14] along
with dsx [15]. Its genomic organization is conserved in
several lineages of insects [6,16] being composed of four
main regions: sex-specific domain, dimerization domain
(BTB), connecting region and DNA-binding domains

(zinc-fingers) [12] (Figure 1A). The fru gene is alternatively spliced in a sex-dependent way from the P1 promoter, where the female transcript translation is
interrupted by the binding of TRA/TRA-2 complex,
whereas the male product is functional [17]. In sex-specific transcripts the exon (S) makes the first domain
whereas, in non-sex-specific transcripts the first domain
is composed by the BTB exons (Figure 1C). Depending
on the species, the BTB domain is formed by one or
two exons (C1-C2). In the same way the connecting
region is formed by two to four exons depending on the
taxonomic group (C3-C5). Finally, the DNA-binding
domain at the 3’ end is composed of one of four different exons (A-D), selected by differential splicing [6,16].
In addition to the sex-specific transcripts, sex-nonspecific products are expressed by three different promoters
(P2, P3 and P4) downstream to the exon S, which confers to fru a complex pattern of expression in different
tissues and stages of the development [18,19] (Figure
1C).
Considering that fru is one of the key elicitors of male
courtship behavior, variation in its nucleotide sequence
could be subjected to sexual selection and thus be
involved in lineage isolation and differentiation. Should
this be the case, we would expect a pattern of rapid

Page 2 of 16

divergence in fru, especially in regions under positive
selection. Indeed, the comparison among different insect
lineages shows that the N-terminal and the connecting
region are the most divergent [6,16], which has been
hypothesized to be either a consequence of these
regions not being essential for the proper function of
FRU protein, or because they would contain information
for species-specific male courtship behavior [6].
Although the hypothesis of species-specific signature
was rejected by the rescue of fru function via ectopic
expression [6], a formal study of selection patterns on
this gene has not yet been performed.
In this work we study patterns of genetic variability in
fru in tephritid (Diptera) species of the group fraterculus
to contrast the hypotheses that the high divergence of
the connecting region is due to a relaxed selective constraint or to positive selection over the region. These
Anastrepha species from the group fraterculus are generally identified by subtle differences in morphological
traits, particularly the aculeus [20], which limits the
identification to females. The problem of identifying
species in this group is further enhanced by the inherent
plasticity of the aculeus [21] and possible existence of
many cryptic species in the group [22]. This problem
has not been placated by the use of some molecular

markers, such as mtCOI [23], doublesex [24] and transformer [25], which have, in general, shown low phylogenetic resolution. Therefore, even though we would like
to test whether the gene fru would provide good genetic
markers to discriminate species from the fraterculus
group, notably A. fraterculus, A. sororcula and A. obliqua, we are mostly interested in determining the effects
of selection in this region, which is non-trivial since we
are contrasting species and populations that diverged
recently, where the use of standard dN/dS methods
[26-28] has been shown to be problematic [29]. Even
though there is a plethora of neutrality tests already
developed to detect departures from selection at the
population level [30-32], the majority perform frequency
analyses per nucleotide [30,31,33], and few have used
haplotype information [34,35] or the phylogenetic relationships [36,37] as a framework to investigate patterns
of departure from neutrality. Here, we propose a test
that uses such information to detect patterns of selection using population polymorphism data rather than
fixed differences among lineages.

that part of the C3 exon differentiated by positive
selection.
Using Bayes Empirical Bayes we estimated that 16 sites
were evolving under positive selection with posterior probability greater than 0.95 (Table 2; Figure 3). Figure 3 shows
that positively selected sites are concentrated in the 5’ half
of the C3 exon, and that selectively constrained sites predominates in the terminal portion of the exon. The investigation of selection on amino acid properties in
TreeSAAP analyses indicate that all 31 physicochemical
properties examined showed significant departure from
neutrality in the goodness-of-fit test, under a 0.05 cutoff
limit (Table 3). Nevertheless, only three properties had significantly positive z-scores under the radical changes categories (6 to 8): a-helical tendencies (Pa); Hydropathy (H)
and Molecular weight (Mw). The sliding window analysis
in TreeSAAP also indicates positive-destabilizing selection
in the 5’ end of C3 exon (Figure 4). These macroevolutionary contrasts indicate presence of positive selection at the
5’ end of C3 exon, whereas there is purifying selection at
the 3’ end of this exon.

Table 4 summarizes estimates of nucleotide variability
for the region sequenced (I3 intron and C3 exon). Considering only the C3 exon of the 50 individuals
sequenced from the three species, 167 polymorphic sites
were found, nine with more than one nucleotide variant,
violating the infinite allele model. The I3 intron had 28
polymorphic sites, six of them with more than one
nucleotide variant (Table 4). The comparison among
sequences also revealed 38 different intron haplotypes
and 94 C3 exon haplotypes, with the majority composed
by unique haplotypes, revealed by the high haplotype
diversity levels both for intron and exon. Diversity
indexes for the coding regions show that synonymous
nucleotide diversities (π s) are greater than nonsynonymous nucleotide diversities (πa) (z-values for all πa × πs
comparisons were lower than -30, p < 0.001) (Table 4).
Because recombination may affect nucleotide diversity
and may destroy historical information in a region, we
used the software RDP, which failed to detect any significant signal of recombination.

For the long-term evolutionary study of the fru connecting region, we amplified a region of 802 bp containing
an 81 bp intron (I3 intron) and 721 bp of the first exon
from the connecting region (C3 exon) from three closely
related Anastrepha species (A. fraterculus, A. sororcula
and A. obliqua) (Figure 1B). The selective pressures over
the fru C3 exon were investigated by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous rates ratio. Table 1 shows the
parameters inferred for the null models M1a and MA as
well as for the alternative MA model. The relaxed
branch-site test rejected the null model of selective constraint (0 < ω ≤ 1) indicating that the foreground branch
(Figure 2) diverged in this region by relaxed selective
constraint or by positive selection (Table 2). We contrasted the restricted MA versus MA models in the
strict branch-site test to discriminate between the two
hypotheses, and again the null model of selective constraint was rejected (Table 2) in favor of the hypothesis

Figure 2 ML phylogenetic tree of fru C3 exon used for detection of selection. The foreground branch is highlighted in gray. The genetic
distances are in nucleotide substitutions per codon.

We performed several neutrality tests on the populational data separated by species. The analyses on the
exon of A. obliqua revealed that all tests were significantly negative, whereas only Fay and Wu’s H and Tajima’s D were significantly negative for A. fraterculus and
A. sororcula. On the other hand, when these tests were
performed on the intron data, we only got significant
departures from neutrality in A. obliqua for the Tajima’s
D test and Fay and Wu’s H and in A. fraterculus for the
Fay and Wu’s H test (Table 5). We used statistical parsimony to establish haplotype networks for the C3 exon
(Figure 5) and for the I3 intron (Figure 6). Because
these haplotype networks fail to indicate long branches
separating the different species here studied, we also
performed the neutrality tests combining all sequences
in a single set. When we do so, all neutrality tests performed either on the intron or on the exon data are significantly negative (Table 5).

The topology of the haplotype network was then
used to compare the probability of survival through
time of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations by
estimating the number of haplotypes defined by each
type of substitution. We observed 86 tip nonsynonymous mutations to 93 tip synonymous mutations, and
23 interior nonsynonymous to 44 synonymous mutations. The data from fru gene in Anastrepha (Table 6)
indicate that, in spite of their smaller number, nonsynonymous mutations define, on average, haplotypes
with higher frequencies than those defined by synonymous mutations. This is indicated by a significant
two-tailed Mann-Whitney ranking test (U = 106; p <
0.02), in which we observe that nonsynonymous mutations have a mean rank of 29.7 and mean number of
derived haplotypes of 27.8, whereas synonymous substitutions have a mean rank of 22.7 and mean number
of derived haplotypes of 6.2.

Discussion
Positive selection in fru C3 exon

Comparisons of fru sequences from insects of very distinct evolutionary lineages show that regardless of the

high evolutionary conservation of the BTB and DNAbinding domains, the connecting region show high
divergence across the different species studied [6,16].
These results are compatible with relaxed selective

constraint on the latter portion of the gene or with
divergence by positive selection. Here we contrast these
two hypotheses using both, population and species level
data from three species of Anastrepha to show that in
all levels our data are better explained by positive selection acting on specific portions of the gene, rather than
relaxed constraint in the connecting region (C3 exon).
The combination of the relaxed branch-site test (M1a
vs. MA models) (Table 2) and the strict branch-site test
(restricted MA vs. MA) demonstrates that part of the
differentiation in the connecting region C3 exon from
fru between the background (Drosophilidae) and

foreground (Tephritidae) lineages is due to positive
selection (Table 2). A BEB analysis detected at least 16
sites under positive selection, 14 of which were inserted
in regions where positive-destabilizing selection was
inferred by the MM01 analysis (Table 3, Figure 3 and
Figure 4)
Because the BTB domain and the DNA-binding
domains are generally conserved while the connecting
region is highly divergent, it was suggested that the connecting region would either play no important role in
FRU function or it would contain species-specific information. According to the first hypothesis, the higher
divergence of the connecting region would be due to
relaxed selective constraint or neutral evolution, whereas
according to the second hypothesis its variation would
be explained by adaptive selection. Gailey et al. [6]
rejected this latter hypothesis because the transgenic
expression of Anopheles fru in D. melanogaster rescued
the Muscle of Lawrence (MOL) development, a structure that is specified only by male FruM protein, which
would imply that relaxed selective constraint or neutral
evolution should be invoked to explain its variation.
However, our studies on selective pattern in fru C3
exon from connecting region show signals of adaptive
evolution in this region.

The gene fru is the most complex in terms of genomic
organization, when compared to the other main genes
from sex-determination cascade (doublesex and transformer). Due to alternative splicing, fru may be expressed
in at least four different male isoforms and four nonsex-specific isoforms [12] (Figure 1C). The combination

of these isoforms is required for the correct development of some neuronal circuitry and connections necessary to control courtship and copulation behavior [38]
All these isoforms share four exons that are commonly
expressed that include the BTB region and the connecting region. We sequenced a large portion of the latter

selection offer opportunities for positive selection to
occur over some segments of this gene. These several
distinct aspects of sexual differentiation could be
affected by the connecting region differently than the
MOL development, hence the rescue of the latter does
not mean that other subtler aspects of the behavior
effected by fru such as male courtship song [39],
response to sex-pheromones [40] and female post-copulatory behavior [41], would respond similarly. This pattern is akin to what has been described for some central
genes in gene networks which are co-opted and assume
new functions in different developmental contexts [42].
Such patterns have been observed in several developmental genes, such as some HOX genes, which affect
basic pattern formation as well as wing and other
appendages formation in arthropods [43,44]. It should
be mentioned, though, that caution should be taken
when considering sexual selection as a sole explanation
for the positive selection here found, because fru also
codes for non-sex-specific transcripts [12], so it is possible that the signal of adaptive selection may be the
result of selection over phenotypes not related to sexual
behavior.

Selective pattern in low divergence lineages of
Anastrepha

Both dN/dS and MM01 analyses require that the differences among sequences represent fixed substitutions
among very well defined lineages [29,45,46]. When dealing with data from recently diverged lineages, few fixed
substitution are found among sequences, and consequently, the power of the tests to discriminate between
positive and purifying selection is reduced [47]. Additionally, recently diverged lineages, such as the species
A. fraterculus, A. sororcula and A. obliqua here considered, may still segregate ancestral polymorphisms. For
this reason, standard interpretation of dN/dS and
MM01 statistics could lead to equivocal conclusions and
other approaches are required.
Our data cannot be subject to the McDonnald-Kreitman [36] test since there is no fixed interspecific variation for any of the species considered. We may,
however, use the same rationale of contrasting recent
and old synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in
the framework of the haplotype network. The McDonnald-Kreitman test considers two categories of contrasts,
polymorphic and fixed, or recent and old, but there is
more information available from the network, particularly the relative frequency of each mutation, which may
be an indication of the relative age of a mutation [48].
In a neutrally evolving region, older mutations would
tend to be in higher frequencies than new mutations
[49], that is why we performed a contrast between
synonymous and non-synonymous mutations using a

Sobrinho and de Brito BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:293
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/293

non-parametric Mann-Whitney test which investigated
the pattern of differential survival between synonymous
and nonsynonymous in evolutionary time (Table 6).
This Mann-Whitney test rejects the null hypothesis that
synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations come from
the same distribution, and indicates that nonsynonymous mutations survived longer than synonymous
mutations (p < 0.02). The excess of low-frequency variants could be explained by many other factor besides
positive selection, such as population demographic
change and background selection, however, only positive
selection and very specific demographic scenarios are
able to explain the excess of high frequency mutations
[32]. Then the excess of nonsynonymous mutations
found in the fru C3 exon reveals the action of positive
selection driving the increase in frequency of such
mutations in the C3 exon. Because this test is dependent
on the topology of the haplotype network, which has
been shown to vary due to stochastic processes [50], we
are currently evaluating the power of this test in different evolutionary scenarios using forward and reversetime simulations, which will be the dealt with elsewhere.
The excess of high frequency mutations detected in
the Mann-Whitney test was also detected by the significantly negative Fay and Wu’s H which measures the frequency of high derived mutations (Table 5). The
Tajima’s D and the Fu and Li’s D statistics were also significantly negative and indicate an excess of low frequency variants. The joint analysis of different neutrality
tests allows for a better evaluation of the influence of
selection over this region, since each one is sensitive to
a particular aspect of the site frequency spectrum [51].
One evident signal of hitchhiking effect by positive
selection is the excess of low and high frequency variants coexisting in the a population after many generations from the selective sweep [32], while the expected
pattern for purifying selection would be only the excess
of low frequency variants. Therefore, the joint analysis
of these neutrality tests confirms that fru C3 exon from
Anastrepha shows signals of positive selection, if not in
the region itself, in a closely linked region.
Selective sweep in fru connecting region

The diversity indexes of the C3 exon are significantly
lower than those of the I3 intron (all z-values < -5, p <
0.001) (Table 4), which would suggest that the intron has
been evolving in a less constrained way. This is not surprising since it is expected that non-coding regions, such
as introns, would evolve neutrally, though some introns
have been described to evolve more conservatively than
adjacent coding regions [52]. Interestingly, when we partition the diversity estimates by species we observe a
reduction in the diversity levels for the intron in A. obliqua, but not in the adjacent exon. In A. obliqua, π and θ

Page 10 of 16

values for the intron are three times lower than those
estimated for A. fraterculus and A. sororcula (z-values <
-4, p < 0.001) (Table 4). Even the haplotype diversity was
twice smaller than the values for the other two species
(z-values < -4, p < 0.001). If we consider that the intron
has evolved neutrally, we would expect similar diversity
levels for the three species. Departures from these expectations would suggest that populations have experienced
distinct demographic scenarios or different selection
events have acted upon the intron or contiguous regions.
Because the reduction in intron diversity in A. obliqua
was not observed in the contiguous connecting region, it
is not likely that it was caused by a recent demographic
event, otherwise it should have affected equally the
genetic variation in the intron and the coding region
[53,54]. On the other hand, a selective sweep would lead
to a reduction in local genetic variation with increase in
frequency of the few polymorphisms associated with the
sweep, and depending on its intensity could lead to complete fixation in the region [54]. When only drift and
mutation are contributing to the increase of the diversity
after such reduction, it takes on average 4N generations
for the diversity to reach Fisher-Wright equilibrium
levels. If there is purifying selection it would take longer
for the equilibrium to be reached, whereas when there is
positive selection the favored alleles, or others linked to
them, will rapidly recover their high allele frequencies.
Therefore, the existence of a previous selective sweep
should have longer lasting effects on the genetic variation
of neutral regions than on regions under positive selection. The similar genetic variability in the coding region
of the three species, coupled with a reduction in the variation in A. obliqua intron, suggests a selective sweep in
A. obliqua, from which the intron variation is still recovering, while the variation in the coding region, subjected
to positive selection, has already recovered, or was never
completely lost. This scenario is more likely if more than
one site has been subject to positive selection at the same
time [55], as it seems to be the case here. The hypothesis
of a recent selective sweep is also corroborated by a starlike haplotype network with an excess of rare haplotypes
for the intron, and lower Fay and Wu’s H estimates for
the coding region than for the intron (Figure 6).
fru as species-specific marker

The lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms makes
recently diverged species share alleles throughout their
genome causing a conflict between gene tree and species
tree for several genes or DNA segments [56]. When
only neutral markers are considered it is expected that
most of the loci attain reciprocal monophyly only after
9N e generations from the speciation event [57,58],
which would take a long time if the species have large
effective sizes. Considering that Anastrepha species from

Sobrinho and de Brito BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:293
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/293

the fraterculus group have diverged recently [23,59] and
should have large effective population sizes, we expect
that species in this group will still show high degree of
shared ancestral polymorphisms throughout their genome, which has been suggested by previous studies
using both mitochondrial and nuclear genes [23,25,60].
Even though we did not observe strict reciprocal monophyly when using data from fru, most specimens of A.
obliqua are separated from the other species by a
branch with several mutations, mostly amino acid replacements. In fact, only five haplotypes of this branch
belong to specimens that were diagnosed as A. fraterculus and four as A. sororcula (Figure 5). When studying
genes directly involved in the species reproductive isolation, the ancestral polymorphisms associated with
regions under selection would be wiped away at a faster
rate, and consequently, one or both diverging groups
would be fixed for species-specific variation at that gene
before other genome regions [61]. Multilocus studies of
closely related species have reported extensive ancestral
polymorphisms sharing, but exclusive variation in some
genes related to reproductive traits such as pheromone
production [62], seminal proteins [7,63] or spermatogenic function [61]. It is possible that the fast evolutionary rate in fru may explain, per se, its more accurate
phylogenetic resolution in Anastrepha species, but it
may also be due to the fact that this gene is adaptively
diverging, and has a role in determining courtship behavior, which could somehow affect reproductive isolation.

Conclusions
Contrary to Gailey et al. [6], who had considered the
high diversification of fru connecting region solely as a
consequence of relaxed selective constraint, here we
conclude that part of such diversification is due to positive selection. These conclusions are based not only on
the comparison of distantly related taxa that show longterm divergence time, but also on recently diverged
lineages and suggest that the episodes of adaptive evolution in fru may be related to sexual selection and/or
conflict related to its involvement in male courtship
behavior. Because the findings of an association between
fru variation and the isolation of A. obliqua may only be
because they had occurred historically concurrently, we
need a more detailed study that considers the entire fru
gene, as well as its interaction with other genes from
the sexual differentiation cascade in more species to better investigate the role of the fru gene in the differentiation of this group and others.
Methods
Fruits from different plant species that are known to be
infested by Anastrepha were collected from 33 localities
in Brazil (Table 7) and set in vermiculite for 14 days

Page 11 of 16

when pupae were separated. After emergence and
maturation, flies that were identified as belonging to the
A. fraterculus group, mostly A. fraterculus, A. obliqua
and A. sororcula, were separated and immediately processed or preserved in 95% ethanol until DNA extraction.
DNA extraction and sequencing

DNA was extracted following the modified protocol of
[64], in which the exoskeletons were maintained intact
for future morphological analyses. We amplified a
region from the end of the BTB domain to next the end
of first exon of the connecting region of fru (C3 exon)
(Figure 1B), using degenerate primers created from
homologous sequences of closely related species: (5’AGTTCGCTGCCGATGTTYCTCAA-3’ and 5’GACAGRCACTAYCCGCAGGACTCTCAG-3’). This
region was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA in a
thermocycler PTC-200 (BioRad) using an admixture of
Taq polymerase and Pfu polymerase to reduce incorporating errors [65]. PCR products were purified by PEG
8000 precipitation [66] and cloned with InsTAclone kit
(Fermentas). At least two recombinant colonies were
sequenced with forward and reverse M13 primers using
the DYEnamic™ET dye terminator kit (GE Healthcare)
and resolved either in a MegaBace 1000 (GE Healthcare)
or in an ABI 3730 (Applied). DNA sequencing was
mostly carried out at MACROGEN INC, Korea. Quality
of base-calling was visually inspected in Chromas version 2.31 http://www.technelysium.com.au. The GenBank accession numbers for the 97 sequences from A.
fraterculus, A. sororcula and A. obliqua are [HQ003715
- HQ003811. We used the translation of these Anastrepha exon sequences to proteins to align this region to
more distantly related taxa. The protein alignments
were used as reference to correct alignments of nucleotide sequences, which were used in the phylogenetic
tree estimation. Sequences were aligned and visually
inspected using Clustal W in BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor software [67]. When sequenced clones from
an individual differed by less than 3 mutations, additional recombinant colonies (up to five total) were
sequenced to confirm results.
fruitless evolution

We used a hierarchical strategy to test for selection on
fru sequences. First we evaluated patterns of long-term
evolutionary response to selection (i. e., a deeper phylogenetic level), by contrasting a sample of sequences
from Anastrepha species against sequences from other
Muscomorpha. We also tested for patterns of selection
which may be detected at the population level, contrasting fru sequences from the connecting region and preceding intron gathered from Anastrepha collected from
several localities in Brazil.

Phylogenetic tree reconstruction

To reconstruct the phylogenetic tree an optimal nucleotide substitution model was determined by Akaike information criterion (AIC) using MODELTEST ver. 3.7 [68]
implemented in the HyPHy package ver 0.95 beta [69].
A phylogenetic tree using sequences from fru C3 exon
was estimated by maximum likelihood using the software PhyML ver. 3.0 [70] under the TIM+G nucleotide
substitution model estimated previously. For the phylogenetic tree reconstruction we used one sequence from
each of the Anastrepha species studied in this work (A.
fraterculus [GenBank accession number: HQ003715], A.
sororcula [GenBank accession number: 1376936] and A.
obliqua [GenBank accession number: HQ003765]) to
represent the Tephritidae lineage, and 10 different
sequences from Drosophilidae available in GenBank: D.

simulans - [AF297054.1]; D. sechellia - [AF297055.1];
D. melanogaster - [D84437.1]; D. erecta - [AF298222.1];
D. yakuba - [AF297056.1]; D. heteroneura [AF051668.1]; D. silvestris - [AF051665.1]; D. grimshawi
- [AF105124.1]; D. virilis - [AY028967.1] and D. pseudoobscura - [AF297059.1].
Long-term response to selection in fruitless

In order to investigate selective pressures that modeled
the evolution of fru, we performed a relaxed branch-site
test and a strict branch-site test [71,72] using the software CODEML, implemented in PAML ver. 4 [73]. The
nonsynonymous/synonymous substitutions rate ratios
(dN/dS = ω) were measured to infer the selective pressure at the protein level. A ω > 1 at a specific site would
indicate positive selection, because nonsynonymous

Sobrinho and de Brito BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:293
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/293

substitutions would have higher fixation probabilities
than synonymous mutations due to selective advantages.
On the other hand, a ω < 1 would indicate purifying
selection, caused by selective constraints at the codon
position. The branch-site tests consider the phylogenetic
tree to test different selective scenarios. The phylogenetic tree was separated in foreground branches, at
which positive selection is tested, and background
branches, represented by the other lineages. We established the Anastrepha branch as foreground and the
other Drosophila species as background. Positive selection was inferred by a contrast of hypotheses using a
maximum likelihood approach. Both relaxed branch-site
test and strict branch-site test use the MA model as
alternative model, in which the codons in the foreground
were allowed to have ω > 1, and the codons in background were constrained to ω ≤ 1. The relaxed branchsite test null model (M1a) assumes the same evolutionary rates for all sites and branches, with all sites varying
ω values from 0 and 1. On the other hand, the strict
branch-site test fixes the ω > 1 category to 1 in the null
model (restricted MA), that is, all sites with ω > 1 are
forced to evolve neutrally (ω = 1). Positive selection is
inferred when a log likelihood ratio test (LRT) of these
values results in a significant value. To assess significance of the LRT we used a chi-squared null distribu2
tion composed of a mixture of point mass 0 and  1 .
Under such null distribution the critical values at 0.05
and 0.01 levels were 2.71 and 5.41, respectively [71].
Bayes Empirical Bayes [28] method was used in conjunction with the branch-site test to estimate which
sites were under the influence of positive selection. We
used the MA model parameters to estimate the Bayes
Empirical Bayes posterior probabilities. Because some
models are prone to show a problem of lack of convergence in a likelihood framework, we ran the analyses
twice with different initial ω values.
Positive selection was also investigated through the
MM01 method of McClellan et al. [46] which evaluates
whether nonsynonymous substitutions favored or not
structural or functional changes in the protein. The analyses were carried out in TreeSAAP version 3.2
[46,74,75] and considered the changes in many physicochemical properties brought forth by each nonsynonymous substitution. A global deviation from neutrality is
verified by a goodness-of-fit test between a neutral
expected distribution and the observed distribution of
the selected physicochemical properties [46]. Furthermore, TreeSAAP also separates the magnitude of nonsynonymous changes in a range going from conservative
to very radical substitutions, according to the change in
specific physicochemical properties. The lowest classes
(1 to 3) represent the more conservative changes and

Page 13 of 16

the highest classes (6 to 8) represent the more radical
changes [46]. McClellan et al. [46] conservatively
defined stabilizing selection as a selection that tends to
maintain the original biochemical attributes of the protein, despite the fact of the inference of positive selection, and destabilizing selection as a selection that favors
structural and functional shifts in a region of a protein.
In this way, positive-destabilizing selection represents a
signature of molecular adaptation.
We considered 8 categories of magnitude change for
the analysis and followed the categorization given in
McClellan et al. [46]. Only amino acid properties identified by significant positive z-score in the magnitude
categories 6, 7 or 8 were considered to be affected by
positive-destabilizing selection. To verify which specific
regions were affected by positive-destabilizing selection,
we performed a sliding window analysis using the amino
acid properties which were significant for this type of
change. Sliding windows of 20 amino acid length with a
sliding step of one codon were selected for showing the
best signal-to-noise ratio [45].
Genetic diversity and population evolutionary analyses

General diversity indexes, such as haplotype (Hd) and
nucleotide (π) diversity [76], number of polymorphic
sites, synonymous nucleotide diversity (πs) and nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (π a ) were calculated
using DnaSP version 5 [77]. The significance of comparison among diversity indexes were accessed by a two
sample z-test for comparison between means [78]. fru
C3 exon and I3 intron haplotype networks were inferred
by TCS v 1.21 software [79] using statistical parsimony
with a 95% connection significance [80], and was manually converted to Newick tree format for some of the
neutrality tests. Because recombination interferes with
phylogenetic inferences, we performed three different
methods to detect recombination events: GENECONV
[81] and RDP both implemented in RDP version 3b14
[82]. Tajima´s D [30], Fu and Li´s D and F [31] and Fay
and Wu’s H [32] neutrality tests were performed in
DnaSP version 5 [77] using a sequence from Drosophila
melanogaster (GenBank access number: D84437.1) as an
outgroup for the fru C3 exon analysis and from Ceratitis
capitata (GenBank access number: AF124047.1) for
intron analyses. We used different outgroup sequences
because the C. capitata sequence available on GenBank
included only a small portion of the C3 exon, and the
D. melanogaster intron showed higher divergence in
relation to the sequences obtained in this work, and, as
a consequence, its correct alignment was impaired.
One test commonly used to analyze populational data
is the McDonnald-Kreitman’s test [36], which contrasts
fixation and polymorphism levels of synonymous and
non-synonymous substitutions for two species in a

Sobrinho and de Brito BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:293

contingency table [36]. Our data cannot be subjected to
McDonnald-Kreitman test since there is no fixed interspecific variation for any of the species considered. We
may, however, use a modification of the test proposed
by Templeton [37] which implements the contrast of
synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in tip
and interior haplotypes (populational equivalents to the
young and old haplotypes contrast of McDonnald-Kreitman test, respectively). Under neutrality synonymous
and nonsynonymous substitutions are expected to occur
in a same rate both in tip and interior haplotypes,
whereas at purifying or positive selection such rate are
biased toward synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions, respectively. We propose here an alternative test
of selection which evaluates whether synonymous substitutions have a greater probability of surviving in the
population when compared to nonsynonymous substitutions. In a neutrally evolving region, we expect that the
probabilities of survival of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions through time should come from the
same probability distribution. On the other hand, if the
region is under purifying selection, we expect that nonsynonymous substitutions have a higher chance of being
eliminated [83], whereas if the region is under positive
selection, we would find several advantageous nonsynonymous substitutions with higher probability of surviving and spreading in the population [54]. In order to
detect this pattern in selection signals, we evaluate the
number of haplotypes that derived from each mutation
directly from a haplotype network. Because recent mutations, such as those present as singletons or doubletons
in the tips of the haplotype network, may not yet have
passed through the evolutionary test of survival and
reproduction over time [37] and are more affected by
drift and chance, we only consider mutations present in
at least three haplotypes. To contrast the differential
survival probabilities of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in the population, we ranked internal synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in the
haplotype network according to the number of descendent haplotypes derived from them and calculate the
difference in synonymous and nonsynonymous ranks
summation (R1 and R2) in an improved normal approximation to the Mann-Whitney test [84]. If synonymous
and nonsynonymous mutations come from the same
distribution, we do not expect to see a significant difference in their ranks, i.e., in neutrality, we expect that
synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations should
have similar probabilities of survival in a population,
and therefore, similar ranks. On the other hand, if nonsynonymous mutations have been selected against, we
expect that synonymous mutations would be on average
older, and therefore have higher ranks than nonsynonymous mutations, and the opposite would be true if the

region is under positive selection. Because it has been
shown that tests of selection that rely on the comparison of rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions have limited power when contrasting sequences
with little differentiation [29,47], this test is adequate to
look for patterns of selection at the population level by
using information derived from the phylogenetic relationships amongst the haplotypes.
