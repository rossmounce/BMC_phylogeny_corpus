Conclusion: These results indicate that although DNA sequence fixes boundaries for gene
expression variability, there remain considerable latitudes of expression within these genomedefined limits that have the potential to influence phenotypes. The extent of normal or expected
natural variability in gene expression may provide an additional level of phenotypic opportunity for
natural selection.

Biological entities such as individual cells, organs, and entire
organisms display phenotypes that are simultaneously dictated and constrained by the composition of nucleic acids
comprising their genomes. Differences in DNA sequence

between individuals within the same species may produce
qualitative and quantitative alterations in gene expression
that influence biochemical processes conferring disease susceptibility and the beneficial or adverse responses to pharmacological intervention [1,2]. Thus, a critical component of

Results: In this study we compared microarray-based measures of hepatic transcript abundance
levels within and between five different strains of Mus musculus. Within each strain 23% to 44% of
all genes exhibited statistically significant differences in expression between genetically identical
individuals (positive false discovery rate of 10%). Genes functionally associated with cell growth,
cytokine activity, amine metabolism, and ubiquitination were enriched in this group. Genetic
divergence between individuals of different strains also contributed to transcript abundance level
differences, but to a lesser extent than intra-strain variation, with approximately 3% of all genes
exhibiting inter-strain expression differences.

Background: Qualitative and quantitative variability in gene expression represents the substrate
for external conditions to exert selective pressures for natural selection. Current technologies
allow for some forms of genetic variation, such as DNA mutations and polymorphisms, to be
determined accurately on a comprehensive scale. Other components of variability, such as
stochastic events in cellular transcriptional and translational processes, are less well characterized.
Although potentially important, the relative contributions of genomic versus epigenetic and
stochastic factors to variation in gene expression have not been quantified in mammalian species.

biomedicine centers on establishing the cause, extent and
result of gene expression variability with an aim toward
establishing pathological associations. To this end, the development of technologies such as DNA microarrays have
allowed for quantitative assessments of transcriptional activity for thousands of genes simultaneously [3]. Microarraybased methods have been used to measure transcriptional
variance in a variety of organisms, including yeast [4], flies
[5], fish [6], mice [7], and men [8]; usually in the context of
assessing the contribution of gene expression to phenotypic
attributes of age, sex, strain, or disease. While the major component of phenotypic diversity within species is thought to be
provided by combinations of heritable variations in DNA, it is
readily apparent that individuals sharing nearly identical
genomes, such as inbred mouse strains and monozygotic
twins, may exhibit strikingly different characteristics [9,10].
To assess the extent and nature of gene expression variability
both within populations of genetically identical individuals
and between genetically heterogeneous individuals, we
selected five strains of commonly used laboratory mice;
inbred 129, Balb/c, and FVB, and outbred CD1 and CFW, isolated RNA from the livers of three males from each strain, and
quantified transcript abundance levels by comparative
hybridizations to cDNA microarrays.

Results

Mice bred for more than 60 generations should fix the vast
majority (potentially all) of genetic contribution to variation
[11], and thus individual mice within each inbred strain are
considered genetically identical. We studied the liver in view
of its important contribution to a wide variety of metabolic
processes as well as practical considerations involving sample
quantities and the ease of tissue procurement. To account for
technical inconsistencies and facilitate comparisons within
and between strains, each array hybridization used a common
reference consisting of RNA combined from the liver, testes,
and kidney of all mice used in the experiments. Two replicate
arrays were performed for each individual mouse liver sample
with each of two different fluorescent dyes to control for
potential dye bias, thereby generating 4 replicate arrays per
mouse and a total of 60 arrays.
We anticipated that three major sources of measurable variation in transcript levels would be represented in this dataset.
The first involves the technical inconsistencies in experimental procedures and was assessed by the four replicate arrays
performed for each mouse sample. The second source of variation is represented predominantly by intrinsic and extrinsic
non-genetic factors influencing gene expression. This variance component was measured through the determination of
transcript levels between mice of the same strain with identical genomes. All mice were matched for age, and were provided consistent diets and living environments. The third
source of gene expression variability was expected to be

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/3/R26

driven by differences in DNA sequence or genome structure
between the different mouse strains. This inter-strain variability was measured by determining transcript abundance
levels between mice of different strains.
To identify genes whose transcript levels varied between
genetically identical individuals, we first used an ANOVA
model with a conservative assessment of significance [7]. This
method yielded the following number of variable genes within
each strain: 129, 37 genes; Balb/c, 36 genes; CD1, 26 genes;
FVB, 21 genes; and CFW, 11 genes. Our previous study of liver
gene expression in C57BL/6 mice identified 21 variable genes
(0.8% of all genes assessed), indicating that the overall experimental results are quite consistent [7]. While this method
identifies variable genes with high confidence, we concluded
that the approach has a high rate of false negatives and is
unduly restrictive when one is interested in assessing overall
levels of variability rather than focusing on any particular
gene product.
We next employed a less conservative strategy that involves
controlling the positive false discovery rate (pFDR) [12]. We
chose a level of acceptable false positives of 10% such that
among the identified variable genes, about 10% probably do
not actually vary. Separate analyses within each strain identified 554 (23%) genes exhibiting variability among individual
129 mice, 1,059 (44%) genes among Balb/c mice, 749 (31%)
genes among CD1 mice, 610 (26%) genes among FVB mice,
and 661 (28%) genes among the CFW mice (Table 1). In a
joint analysis in which all strains were evaluated simultaneously, 1,876 genes (79%) varied within strain at a pFDR of
10% (see Materials and methods). Overall, mice in the Balb/c
strain exhibited greater liver gene expression variability than
mice from other strains. For a gene to be identified as variable, either the transcript level difference between individual
mice is large, or the array variance - in this case the technical
variability - is small. We specifically re-evaluated the array
variability and did not identify a lower array variance in the
Balb/c experiments.
Of the genes exhibiting variable expression levels within
strains, 33 were variable within all 5 strains, and 154 were
variable in 4 of the 5 strains (see Additional data file 2, supplemental Table 2). To determine how many genes are
expected to be in common by chance if genes were chosen
randomly, we undertook a simulation study with 50,000
datasets generated by randomly selecting groups of 554,
1,059, 749, 610, and 661 genes from the 5 strains for each data
set and determined the number of genes represented in all 5
sets. The greatest number of genes in common, by chance
alone, was 19, though typically fewer than 10 genes were
found in common. This analysis indicates that the 33 genes
identified in our study represent a highly significant level of
overlap (p < 0.00002). Searches based on gene ontology (GO)
classification indicated that genes associated with cell growth

To determine if the intra- and inter-strain gene expression
measurements were reproducible, we examined selected
genes in 3 additional mice from each strain, all males between
68 and 72 days old. To ensure that inconsistencies in RNA
isolation and cDNA synthesis procedures were not contributing to variance, we resected the livers from the additional
mice, divided each liver into four sections, and separately isolated RNA from each portion. We used quantitative RT-PCR
to measure transcript levels for three genes that varied
between strains but were stable within strain (Cth, ApoA4,
Dnase2a), two genes that varied within strain (Cish and
Socs2), and one gene that was stable both within and between
strains (S16). The results demonstrated highly reproducible
intra-individual measurements in the RNA samples isolated
from the same mouse (standard deviation ± 0.4-fold), a result
that indicates minimal technical variation associated with
RNA preparations (Figure 2). Concordant with the results

reports

We next sought to assess the gene expression variability
between different mouse strains. For this analysis we used an
ANOVA model in which we considered the F ratio of mouse
(between strain) to mouse (within strain) effect, where the
significance of the F statistic is determined again by the pFDR
(see Materials and methods). Using a pFDR of 10%, the analyses of individual mice identified 66 transcripts out of 2,382
(2.8%) that exhibited greater inter- than intra-strain variability (Figure 1a). Several transcripts exhibited substantial interstrain variability, and we confirmed the microarray results for
four of these genes by quantitative PCR (Figure 1b). Apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA4) message levels varied 5.7-fold between
mice of the 129 strain and mice of the FVB strain, a finding
that confirms previous studies demonstrating a high level of
expression variability for this gene [13,14]. ApoA4 is synthesized in the liver and intestine, and is a mediator of plasma
lipid transport. Human studies have identified polymorphisms in the ApoA4 gene that associate with ApoA4 plasma
levels, inter-individual variability in cholesterol levels, and
risk of coronary heart disease [15]. The regulation of ApoA4
expression involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes influenced by genetic variation in the gene
itself [14]. Other genes exhibiting high inter-strain differences in expression levels encode proteins modulating cellular oxidative stress responses. These include NADPH oxidase
4 (Nox4), cytochrome p450 4a14 (CYP4a14), glutathione S

transferase pi (Gstp), peroxiredoxin 4, and ferritin light chain
(Ftnl) (Figure 1a). Our results are consistent with previous
studies that have demonstrated substantial mouse strain differences in basal iron status, ferritin levels and the potential
for modulating oxidative hepatic stress. Immunoquantitation
of total liver ferritin levels in four mouse strains determined a
three- to fourfold difference between the SWR and C57BL/6
strains, with Balb/c and DBA/2 strains having levels between
these extremes [16]. Our results identified the highest levels
of Ftl expression in CD1 mice, a strain not examined in the
previous report. This study and our previous work each determined that stress-response genes exhibit substantial individual or within-strain variability [7]. Thus, these inter-strain
measurements represent a level of consistency superimposed
on the underlying gene expression variability. The specific
reason for the high representation of the stress-response
genes in these experiments has not been determined. A rapid
physiological response to the process of CO2-induced death
could be contributory. If so, then these results indicate a
robust strain-dependent physiological difference in the
response to sacrifice. Alternatively, these gene expression
patterns might reflect fundamental differences between
strains relating to the generation and control of oxidative
stress that could correlate with differences in lifespan and disease susceptibility.

reviews

metabolism [GO:0009308], and the ubiquitin ligase complex
[GO:0000151] were enriched among the genes with consistent intra-strain variation, when compared to the array as a
whole. All genes showing significant inter-individual variability in our previous study of C57BL/6 mice [7] also varied in at
least one strain analyzed in the current study. Moreover,
genes previously found to exhibit substantial hepatic intrastrain variability, including CisH, Hhex, Cyp4a14, and
Gadd45a, varied in at least three out of the five strains. Interestingly, four genes identified in the current study are
involved in the ubiquitination process; Wsb1, Arih1, Cdc27,
and Chordc1. This finding suggests the possibility that normal
variability in protein degradation pathways could provide an
additional level of global gene expression variability either
through direct targeting of specific proteins or via a cascade of
indirect effects influencing transcriptional regulation.

Based on the analyses of transcript levels in individual mice,
we found the greatest contribution to overall gene expression
variability occurred among genetically identical individuals:
23% to 44% of all genes exhibited measurable variation,
depending on strain (see Additional data file 2, supplemental
Figure 3). Substantially less variance was attributable to
genome differences between strains (about 2.8%). Few studies assessing natural gene expression variability in mammalian species that might provide a context for these findings

refereed research

Comprehensive studies of gene expression in model organisms such as Saccharomyces and Drosophila have delineated
the contributions of age, sex, and genotype to corresponding
variations in transcript levels. However, the size constraints
of these species necessitates the use of sample pools
composed of hundreds to millions of discrete organisms, an
approach that eliminates the ability to assess variability at the
level of the individual. In contrast, assessing the relationships
between the genome and gene expression variability in
humans is hampered by the inability to precisely control the
multitude of environmental influences that profoundly influence gene expression in qualitative and quantitative ways. In
this context, the mouse represents a useful model system
highly suited for establishing that component of variability
that is independent of diversity directly encoded in the
genome. Measurements of intra-strain gene expression levels
reflect the allowable latitudes of gene expression in any single
individual in a fixed environment at a given point in time. The
inter-strain measurements reflect the additional contribution
of heterogeneity at the level of the genome.

deposited research

To assess the effects of pooling on the ability to characterize
inter-strain variation in liver gene expression, we performed
a separate microarray analysis using RNA samples combined
from the three mice of each strain. Four replicate arrays were
hybridized for each of the five pooled strain samples with two
replicates in each dye orientation. We identified 374 genes
(about 15% of all genes included in the analysis) that varied
significantly between strains using a pFDR of 10%. Of the 66
genes exhibiting significant inter-strain variability determined from analyses of individual mice, 60 were evaluable in
this experiment and 41 (68%) were also determined to be variable in the analysis of pooled samples. These results indicate
that a large portion of genes presumed to be variable between
mouse strains and representing potential genetic determinants of quantitative phenotypic traits are actually quite noisy

Discussion

reports

We anticipated that transcripts expressed differentially
between mouse strains would primarily reflect heritable differences in strain genomes. As such, mice sharing a common
ancestry might be expected to exhibit similar variability in
gene expression compared to more distantly related mice.
Supporting this concept are studies in humans showing less
variability in lymphocyte transcript levels between identical
twins relative to siblings, and siblings relative to unrelated
individuals [8]. We performed hierarchical clustering on the
subset of genes exhibiting significant inter-strain differences
and arranged the different mouse strains according to their
similarities in expression profiles (Figure 3). Clustering based
on the entire list of genes, either unweighted or weighted by
F-values, produced similar results (data not shown). Comparing this expression-based dendrogram with the known phylogenetic relationship of these strains supports a genetic basis
for a component of the expression variability [17].

among individuals. This conclusion is easily visualized by
plotting the transcript levels for individual mice and for
pooled mice (Figure 4a). Genes, such as Cystathione gammalyase (Cth), that vary significantly in both the individual and
pooled analyses showed relatively steady expression within
each strain (Figure 4b), while genes that vary significantly
only in the pooled analysis, such as CisH, tend to have high
intra-strain variance (Figure 4c). This result emphasizes that
for many genes the intra-strain or within-genotype variation
is large, and a single pool of a small number of mice will not
accurately reflect the population mean for the most variable
genes.

reviews

from the original mice, Cth exhibited a low level of intrastrain variability, but was expressed approximately fourfold
lower in the FVB and CFW strains (Figure 2a). Measurements
of ApoA4 and Dnase2a expression were also highly concordant with the original results (see Additional data file 2, supplemental Figure 1a,b). CisH and Socs2 expression again
exhibited substantial within-strain variability, with measurements differing by up to 50-fold between Balb/c mice (Figure
2b; Additional data file 2, supplemental Figure 1c), while S16
expression remained quite stable across individuals and
strains (Figure 2c).

have been reported. Analyses of transcript levels in skeletal
muscle between five mouse strains found greater inter-strain
than intra-strain differences. [18]. This suggests that muscle
tissue exhibits a narrow range of normal variation relative to
liver. However, the study design in which two mice per strain
and two microarrays per mouse were compared provides substantially less statistical power to detect differences within
strain. Interestingly, concordant with the findings reported
here, Balb/c mice demonstrated the greatest level of intrastrain variation. A comparative analysis of mRNA abundance
levels in the hippocampus of mice from 8 mouse strains identified more than 200 genes with significant strain differences
using very stringent statistical criteria [19]. The experimental
design involved tissue pooled from six mice of each strain,
rather than individual mice. This pooling strategy was apparently based in part on the results of a prior microarray study
indicating that transcript levels of genes expressed in the hippocampus of genetically identical mice were quite similar
with only about 0.1% of all transcripts called differentially
expressed [20]. It is possible that there is lower inter-individual variability in hippocampus than in liver. However, this
previous study directly compared only pairs of mice in a headto-head fashion, and the criteria for differential expression
were based on a 1.7-fold change in abundance level, and not
on statistical criteria.
Overall, we found that the expression of most hepatic genes in
mice housed in standard 'steady-state' laboratory vivarium
conditions is similar between individuals of the same or different strain. However, the transcript levels of a sizeable
minority varied substantially. The proportion of genes exhibiting significantly variable expression between individual fish
(18%) [6], yeast strains (24%) [4], and fly genotypes (25%) [5]
is similar to that observed here between individual mice (23%
to 44%). Analyses of gene expression in human tissues have
also shown considerable variability between individuals.
Importantly, substantial contributions to this variation cannot be attributed to genotypic differences between subjects
[8,21,22]. Comparisons of transcript and protein levels
between humans and non-human primates identified significantly greater variation among the human subjects than

Conclusion

In the context of complex multicellular organisms, the endresult of phenotypic diversity in the setting of a fixed genome
has long been appreciated. Toxicology studies have repeatedly shown differing susceptibilities to drug effects, such as
carcinogen-induced tumor promotion within isogenic mouse
strains [30]. Genetically identical animals aged under tightly
controlled environments exhibit wide ranges in lifespans [31].
Indeed, the seeming incongruity between genetic homogeneity and phenotypic variability was recognized more than 40
years ago [32]. Importantly, the magnitude of gene expression variability measured in this study suggests either a tolerance for wide abundance ranges of certain transcripts, or
potentially an organismal advantage for maintaining a state
of gene expression variability offering an additional level of
phenotypic opportunity for natural selection.

Mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA), maintained in a barrier facility and cared
for in accordance with an approved Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) protocol. All mice were between 68 and
73 days old and were housed in identical environments with
the same diet (Harlan Teklad 8664), constant temperature
(20 to 22°C), and consistent light and dark cycles (controlled
photoperiod of 12 hour light/12 hour dark). Water was provided ad libitum. Three male mice were sacrificed from each
of the following strains (nomenclature in italics is used
throughout this paper): 129S4 (129), Balb/cAnNCrlBR
(Balb/c), Crl:CD-1®(ICR)BR (CD1), FVB/NCrlBR (FVB), and
Crl:CFW®(SW)BR (CFW); CFW is sometimes referred to as
'Swiss Webster'. Each mouse was brought individually into a
separate room for sacrifice and killed in a CO2 chamber. The
liver, left kidney, and left testis were removed from each
mouse and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Care
was taken to ensure that the minimum amount of time
elapsed from the sacrifice of the first mouse to the last. Total

A second potential contributor to individual differences in
gene expression centers on epigenetic regulation. Methylation of cytosine residues in the CpG islands of gene promoters
and the covalent modifications of histones represent two
important epigenetic modifications that influence gene
transcription. Recent studies emphasize the importance of
these regulatory mechanisms for dictating phenotypes in
individuals with minimal divergence in genome sequence. A
provocative report by Rakyan et al. [27] determined that the
penetrance of the highly variable kinky-tail phenotype found
in the well-studied Axin-fused (AxinFu) mouse strain correlated with the differential methylation of a retrotransposon
within AxinFu. Importantly, the methylation state of the retrotransposon was inherited transgenerationally after both
maternal and paternal transmission, and was influenced by
strain background. Striking differences in DNA methylation
and histone acetylation have been observed in identical twins
with increasing 'epigenetic drift' associated with advanced
age [28]. Similar age-related epigenetic shifts have been
reported in mice [29]. In the studies reported here, we found
several genes that exhibited high variability in more than one
strain, suggesting that certain genomic loci may be prone to
imprecise regulatory control.

One component of inter-individual variability could be represented by stochastic events or noise. Recently, gene expression measurements at the level of the single cell have
provided direct experimental evidence of quantifiable contributions of stochastic biochemical noise to phenotypic variation in isogenic populations [24,25]. The end-result of this
component of variability has long been appreciated through
studies of developmental processes that revealed requirements for feed-back amplifications of initial asymmetrical
noise for cell fate determination [26].

reviews

There are several possible contributors to the gene expression
variability observed in genetically identical individuals. Technical factors include subclinical disease states, unrecognized
differences in environments and diet, or heterogeneity in the
cell-type compositions of the analyzed tissues. We attempted
to precisely control environmental and handling effects during the design of this study, and we did not observe any histological differences in the cellular composition of livers within
or between strains. The ideal experiment would assess temporal variation in tissue transcript levels within an individual
mouse, but in the case of liver gene expression these measurements would be confounded by changes resulting from
repeated tissue biopsies. Importantly, our analyses of separate liver samples acquired from the same mouse yielded
highly concordant transcript measurements.

comment

between humans and chimpanzees [23], a finding further
supporting the conclusion that a sizeable component of transcript abundance measurements reflects non-genomic
variation.

Comparison
Comparison of transcript levels exhibiting inter-strain variability determined by analyses of individual samples and pooled samples. (a) Examples of genes
that demonstrated significant inter-strain variance after pooling the RNA from three mice of each strain. The relative expression values are shown for the
three mice individually (1, 2, 3) and for the three mice pooled (P). Note that the individual and pooled results are data from independent hybridizations. Qvalues are listed for both the individual mouse experiment (q1) and the pooled mouse experiment (q2), and values less than 0.1 are shaded gray to indicate
statistical significance. Genes with low intra-strain variability (stable within strain) were statistically significant in both the individual and pooled
experiments, while genes that had large intra-strain variability (noisy within strain) were significant only in the pooled experiment. Asterisks denote genes
that were verified by quantitative PCR. (b) Genes such as Cth were relatively stable within strain. (c) Genes such as CisH were relatively noisy within
strain. Error bars indicate standard deviations of four microarray experiments.

RNA was extracted from the tissue using the TRIzol reagent
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. For an RNA reference standard,

equal quantities of total RNA were combined from all three
organs of all the mice. This same reference RNA was used on
every array to standardize comparisons between arrays. For

systemic variation due to any experimental variable such as
different batches of arrays or RNA preparations. Therefore,
no scale adjustment was performed on the arrays before combining data across samples.
The expression of genes that vary among mice within each
strain was evaluated using an ANOVA model (Pritchard et al.
[7]). Here, an F-value with degrees of freedom 2 and 8 was
used to assess the variability of mouse variance within each
strain.
To identify genes that varied among strains of mice, a nested
mixed effects ANOVA model was used. Specifically, the model
is written as:
y = overall mean + dye + strain + mouse within strain

and Y are the means of normalized ratios for the ith mouse
in the jth strain, all mice in jth strain, and over all strains,
respectively. An F-value with degrees of freedom 4 and 10 for
each gene is used to assess how variable the gene is among
strains. An ANOVA table for this analysis is provided in Additional data file 2 (supplemental Table 1). To examine a possible dependence of statistical significance and signal intensity,
we plotted the F-values versus the log2(intensityCy3 +
intensityCy5). There was no dependence on intensity for the
significant genes either within strain or between strains (see
Additional data file 2, supplemental Figure 2). The significance of these F-values was determined through estimating
the pFDR, which is the proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses among the rejected hypotheses for pre-selected critical
values [12]. As the overall goal here is to assess how genes
vary among and within strains, it is natural to control the proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses among the rejected

For each array spot, the intensity levels of the two fluorophores were obtained by subtracting median background
intensity from median foreground intensity. A gene was only
considered expressed if the fluorescence intensity of the corresponding spot was at least six foreground pixels greater
than four standard deviations above background on every
array. For each gene, the logarithm base 2 ratios (referred to
henceforth as log ratios) of the two channels were calculated
to quantify to relative expression levels between the experimental and reference samples. To allow for inter-array comparisons, each array was normalized to remove systemic
sources of variation. This normalization was accomplished by
means of a print-tip-specific intensity-based normalization
method. [33]. A scatter-plot smoother, which uses robust
locally linear fits, was applied to capture the dependence of
the log ratios on overall log-spot intensities. The log ratios
were normalized by subtracting the fitted values based on the
print-tip-specific scatter-plot smoother from the log ratios of
experimental and control channels. Examination of the
spread of the normalized log ratios via boxplots indicated no

reviews

Each microarray comprised 5,285 mouse cDNAs obtained
from the Research Genetics' sequence-verified set of IMAGE
clones (Research Genetics, Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). All cDNA clones used for array construction were
sequence verified and annotated accordingly. Clone inserts
were amplified by PCR, purified, verified by gel electrophoresis and spotted onto polylysine-coated glass microscope
slides using a GeneMachines (San Carlos, CA, USA) robotic
spotter as described previously [7]. cDNA probes were generated from 50 µg of total RNA in a reaction volume of 30 µl
containing oligo(dT) primer/0.2 mM amino acid-dUTP
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA)/0.3 mM dTTP/0.5 mM
each dATP, dGTP, and dCTP/380 units of Superscript II
reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). The purified cDNA
was combined with either Cy3 or Cy5 monoreactive fluorophores (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA (formerly
Amersham Pharmacia)) that covalently couple to the cDNAincorporated aminoallyl linker in the presence of 50 mM
NaHCO3 (pH 9.0). The experimental and reference probes
were combined and competitively hybridized to microarrays
under a coverslip in a volume of 24 µl for 16 h at 63°C. Slides
were washed in graded sodium chrolide/sodium citrate
buffer (SSC, 1× SSC = 0.15 M NaCl/0.015 M sodium citrate,
pH 7) and spun dry. Array images were collected for the Cy3
and Cy5 emissions using a GenePix 4000A fluorescent scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA). The image
data were extracted and analyzed using GENEPIX 3.0 microarray analysis software (Axon Instruments).

ones while examining the genes that vary among/within
strains. In this paper, the pFDR level was set to be 0.10. This
means that we expect 10% of our rejected hypotheses ('significant' genes) to have been falsely rejected. The pFDR level of
0.10 is a somewhat liberal cutoff as we are most interested in
assessing overall levels of variation rather than defining a
small subset of genes that vary with high confidence. A qvalue that measures the strength of the F-value with respect
to pFDR was also calculated for each gene using the algorithm
proposed by Storey and Tibshirani [12]. The q-value is the
minimum pFDR that occurs when rejecting a statistic with
the observed F-value for the set of nested rejected regions. To
avoid the distributional assumption, 1,000 bootstrap samples
were used to calculate the pFDRs for a series of critical values
and the q-values for all the genes.
To determine which gene ontology terms were enriched
among the variable genes we used EASE software. EASE compares the proportion of genes that are assigned a given GO
term among the list of variable genes to the proportion of
genes with that GO term on the array as a whole. A statistical
score similar to a p value is generated based on the upper
bound of the distribution of Jackknife Fisher exact probabilities. For genes that varied within strain we performed separate EASE analyses for each strain, and then reported the GO
terms that were enriched by >1.5-fold in at least 4 out of 5
strains and had the lowest average EASE score (cell growth,
0.35; amine metabolism, 0.25; cytokine activity, 0.39; ubiquitin ligase complex, 0.43).
Hierarchical clustering was performed using Cluster 3.0 software (Michael Eisen, Stanford University). We used complete
linkage clustering for both genes and arrays with a correlation
(uncentered) similarity metric with data either unweighted or
weighted by F-value.
The normalized log ratios, F-values, q-values, and mean
squares for the 2,382 genes assessed in the unpooled analysis
are included in Additional data file 1. In addition, information
about the microarray used in this study and the unprocessed
gpr files may be obtained through the ArrayExpress website
