Abstract
Background: Cyclophilin A (CypA) expression is associated with malignant phenotypes in many cancers. However,
the role and mechanisms of CypA in liver fluke-associated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) are not presently known. In
this study, we investigated the expression of CypA in CCA tumor tissues and CCA cell lines as well as regulation
mechanisms of CypA in tumor growth using CCA cell lines.
Methods: CypA expression was determined by real time RT-PCR, Western blot or immunohistochemistry. CypA
silence or overexpression in CCA cells was achieved using gene delivery techniques. Cell proliferation was assessed
using MTS assay or Ki-67 staining. The effect of silencing CypA on CCA tumor growth was determined in nude
mice. The effect of CypA knockdown on ERK1/2 activation was assessed by Western blot.
Results: CypA was upregulated in 68% of CCA tumor tissues. Silencing CypA significantly suppressed cell
proliferation in several CCA cell lines. Likewise, inhibition of CypA peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity
using cyclosporin A (CsA) decreased cell proliferation. In contrast, overexpression of CypA resulted in 30% to 35%
increases in proliferation of CCA cell lines. Interestingly, neither silence nor overexpression of CypA affected cell
proliferation of a non-tumor human cholangiocyte cell line, MMNK1. Suppression of CypA expression attenuated
ERK1/2 activity in CCA M139 cells by using both transient and stable knockdown methods. In the in vivo study,
there was a 43% reduction in weight of tumors derived from CypA-silenced CCA cell lines compared with control
vector CCA tumors in mice; these tumors with stable CypA silencing showed a reduced cell proliferation.
Conclusions: CypA is upregulated in majority of CCA patients’ tissues and confers a significant growth advantage
in CCA cells. Suppression of CypA expression decreases proliferation of CCA cell lines in vitro and reduces tumor
growth in the nude mouse model. Inhibition of CypA activity also reduces CCA cell proliferation. The ERK1/2
pathway may be involved in the CypA-mediated CCA cell proliferation. Thus, CypA may represent an important
new therapeutic target for liver fluke-associated CCA.

Background
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant tumor derived
from bile duct epithelium. Although it is relatively rare in
Europe and North America, CCA occurs at a much
higher incidence in Southeast Asia; incidence and

mortality rates from CCA are increasing worldwide [1,2].
In the northeast of Thailand, CCA is the most common
liver cancer and represents a major health problem in
this area. Several clinical risk factors are associated with
CCA carcinogenesis. Among these, colonization with the
liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini appears to be the most
important risk factor for CCA development in this endemic area of Thailand [3].

Clinical treatment options for this cancer are very limited
because CCA is refractory to conventional chemotherapy
and radiation treatment [4]. At present, complete surgical
excision represents the only chance for survival. Unfortunately, distant metastasis, extensive regional lymph node
metastasis and vascular invasion frequently preclude resection [5]. Patients with unresectable CCA generally survive
fewer than 12 months after diagnosis [6]. It is clear that
future research should focus on developing novel chemopreventive and adjuvant therapeutic strategies for CCA; to
do this, we have focused on selecting molecular targets
that may impact clinical outcomes.
Cyclophilin A (CypA) is an 18 kDa cytosolic protein that
is thought to be the major intracellular target of the
immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) [7]. CypA
possesses a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase)
activity that interconverts the cis and trans isomers of peptide bonds that precede the amino acid proline [8]. In
addition to its enzymatic properties, CypA is conserved
throughout the phylogenetic tree from yeast to human; as
such, CypA is believed to be a key molecule in many biological functions including molecular chaperoning, protein
folding [9], protein trafficking [10], immune modulation
[11] and cell signaling [12]. Also, although CypA is present
intracellularly, it can be secreted from cells in response to
inflammatory stimuli such as hypoxia, infection and oxidative stress [13-16]. A secreted CypA appears to be
mediated through its Ig-like membrane receptor, CD147,
and stimulate a Ras-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway [17,18].
CypA protein has been found to be expressed at unusually high levels in several types of cancers including
non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma, oral cancer and buccal squamous cell carcinomas [19-22]. Several studies have shown
that CypA promotes cancer cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic phenotype, migration/invasion, and drug resistance in
various cancer cell types [23-25]. However, the role of
CypA in CCA has not been determined. The purposes of
this study were to examine the expression of CypA in
CCA tumor specimens and cell lines and to determine the
functions and mechanisms of CypA in CCA cell lines in
vitro and in vivo. CypA could be a potential therapeutic
target for CCA.

RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin
EDTA, Opti-MEM I medium and Lipofectamine™ 2000
transfection reagent were purchased from Invitrogen Life
Technology. Puromycin and mouse anti-b-actin antibody
were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co (St Louis,
MO). Rabbit anti-CypA antibody was purchased from

Page 2 of 15

Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Mouse anti-Ki-67 antibody
was obtained from Novacastra, United Kingdom. Goat
anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and goat anti-mouse IgG (H&L)
antibody conjugated to HRP were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology Laboratories, Inc. Rabbit anti-ERK1/2
antibody, mouse anti-pERK1/2 antibody, and CsA were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other chemicals were from Sigma.
CCA tumor specimens and CCA cell lines

Fifty-seven paraffin-embedded histologically proven CCA
tumor specimens were obtained from the specimen bank
of the Liver Fluke and Cholangiocarcinoma Research
Center, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University,
Thailand; patients had undergone liver resection at Srinakarin Hospital, Thailand. Informed consent was obtained
from all patients prior to analysis, and the research protocol (#HE471214) was approved by the Human Research
Ethics Committee at Khon Kaen University. Specimens
were fixed in 10% neutral formalin buffer, embedded in
paraffin, and cut into 5 μm thick sections and examined
by pathologists for histological confirmation.
Six distinct CCA cell lines, M055, KKU100, M156,
M139, M213 and M214, were established from different
histological types of primary tumors from patients living
in the Opisthorchis viverrini endemic area of Northeast
Thailand who were admitted for surgical treatment [26].
Cell line M055 and KKU100 originated from patients
with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. M156 and
M214 were derived from patients with moderately differentiated, while M139 and M213 were established from
squamous carcinoma and adenosquamous tumor origin,
respectively. An immortalized human cholangiocyte cell
line, MMNK1, was established as previously described
[27] and was used in this study as a non-tumor cell line
for comparison. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium with 10% FBS as previously described [21].
Immunohistochemistry

Tumor specimens from patients with CCA and mouse
tumors were fixed overnight in formalin and processed
into 5 μm thick sections. The formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded sections were stained for CypA and/or Ki-67
using standard immunohistochemistry protocols. Briefly,
tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in
xylene and ethanol, boiled for 3 minutes in 0.1 M citrate
buffer at pH 6.0 to unmask the antigens, and then endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked in a 0.6% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) solution. Samples were then
blocked for 1 hour, followed by incubation of primary
antibody for 1 hour and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. The primary

Obchoei et al. Molecular Cancer 2011, 10:102
http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/10/1/102

antibody dilutions used were 1:100 rabbit anti-CypA antibody and 1:1,000 mouse anti-Ki-67 antibody. The secondary antibody dilutions used were 1:100 HRPconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and 1:100 HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Sections incubated with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) instead of primary antibody served as negative controls. The sections then
underwent treatment with 0.05% 3, 3’-diaminobenzindine
tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and 0.1% H 2O 2 in 50 mol/L
Tris-HCl pH 7.8; and were counterstained with hematoxylin. CypA expression was examined as previously
described [28]. Briefly, the frequency of CypA positive
cells was semi-quantitatively scored on the basis of the
percentage of positive cells, with 0% = negative; 1-25% =
+1; 26-50% = +2; and >50% = +3. The intensity of CypA
expression was scored as weak = 1, moderate = 2 and
strong = 3. The CypA immunoreactivity index of each
section was calculated as intensity multiplied by
frequency.
RNA extraction from cells and tissues

Total RNA was extracted using Ambion RNAqueous4PCR kit (Austin, TX) as previously described [29]. Briefly,
cells were lysed using Ambion lysis buffer and then transferred to an Ambion mini-column and centrifuged at
10,000 × g for 1 minute. The column was washed 3 times
with washing buffer and eluted in 100 μl of elution buffer.
RNA solution was treated with DNAse I to remove any
trace amounts of genomic DNA contamination, using the
Ambion DNA removing kit. For the mouse tumor tissues,
the frozen tissues were soaked overnight in RNAlater-ICE
buffer (Ambion) before being lysed in Ambion lysis buffer.
Real-time PCR

CypA mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time reverse
transcriptase-PCR as previously described [21]. Briefly,
mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the
iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The PCR reaction of
100 nM of each primer, diluted cDNA templates and iQ
SYBR Green Supermix, ran for 40 cycles of 95°C for 20
seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. Each cDNA sample was
run in triplicate. The b-actin primer was included in every
plate to account for sample variations. The mRNA level of
each sample was normalized to that of b-actin mRNA. The
relative mRNA level was presented as unit values of 2[Ct(bactin)-Ct(CypA)]
. The primers for human CYPA gene and the
housekeeping gene b-actin were designed [21]. The primer
sequences for the human CYPA gene [GenBank:
NM_0211130.3] were 5"GTCAACCCCACCGTGTT
CTTC3” (sense) and 5"TTTCTGCTGTCTTTGGGA
CCTTG3” (antisense), and for the housekeeping gene bactin, primers were 5"CTGGAACGGTGAAGGTGACA3”
(sense) and 5"AAGGGACTTCCTGTAACAATGCA3”
(antisense).

Western blot

Cells were lysed with radio immuno-precipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer (Pierce Biotechnology) for 30 minutes in
ice. Cell lysates were then collected after centrifugation
at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Protein lysate
(15 μg) was loaded for CypA, ERK1/2, and pERK1/2 protein analysis. Protein bands were separated with 4-20%
Tris-Glycine gradient SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transblotted for 1 hour at 4°C onto
Hybond-P PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences,
Arlington Heights, IL). The membrane was probed with
rabbit anti-CypA antibody (1:2,000), rabbit anti-ERK1/2
antibody (1:2,000), mouse anti-pERK antibody (1:1,000),
or anti-b-actin antibody (1:10,000) at room temperature
for 1 hour and washed 3 times with 0.1% Tween 20-Trisbuffered saline (TBS). Then, the membrane was incubated in a HRP-linked secondary antibody (1:20,000) for
1 hour at room temperature and then washed 3 times
with 0.3% Tween 20-TBS; the immunoactive bands were
detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
plus reagent kit.
Plasmid transfection

All plasmids used in the present study were purchased
from OriGene. The effects of CypA silence and overexpression were studied in CCA cell lines and MMNK1.
M139, M213, M214, and MMNK1 cells were transiently
transfected with HuSH 29mer shRNA construct against
CypA (shCypA) to elicit silencing, which was compared
to cell lines transfected with the shRNA pRS non-effective GFP plasmids (shV) as a negative control. The
CypA shRNA sequence used for this study was as follows: 5’CCACCGTGTTCTTCGACATTGCCGTCGAC3’. M055, KKU100, and MMNK1 cells were
transiently transfected with pCMV6-XL5-CypA (OXCypA) for CypA overexpression or pCMV6-XL5 empty
vector (V). To do this, the CCA cells (2 × 10 5 cells)
were seeded onto 6-well plate for 24 hours. The Lipofectamine™ 2000 and cDNA plasmids were diluted in
Opti-MEM I medium and then combined at a ratio of
1:1. The cells were incubated with the diluted transfection complex in a total volume of 1 mL for 6 hours.
Transfected cells were collected 48 hours after transfection and used for subsequent analysis.
Stable cell line selection

Stable cells expressing shCypA were selected in M139
cells with retrovirus vector (OriGene). Briefly, Phoenix™
Ampho Cells (OriGene) were transfected with either
shCypA or shV plasmids. Viral supernatants were collected and transduced into the parental M139 cells.
Stable cell lines expressing CypA-shRNA (M139shCypA) or negative control vector (M139-shV) were
selected with the addition of 0.5 μg/mL puromycin into

Obchoei et al. Molecular Cancer 2011, 10:102

the medium; stable cell lines were cultured for at least 2
weeks before confirming the expression levels of CypA
by real-time PCR and Western blot.
Cell proliferation assay

The effects of CypA silence and overexpression on cell
proliferation were determined by measuring cell viability
using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay.
Briefly, the cells transiently and stably transfected with
shCypA or shV and transiently transfected with pCMV6XL5-CypA or pCMV6-XL5 empty vector (OriGene) were
seeded onto 96-well plates (2 × 10 3 cells/well) and
serum-starved (0% FBS) for 24 hours. Then, they were
incubated with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
2% FBS. Cell growth was assessed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days.
Twenty μL of MTS reagent mixed with 100 μL serum
free RPMI 1640 medium was added to each well and
incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Absorbance was recorded
at 490 nm with an EL-800 universal microplate reader
(Bio-Tek instruments).
Proliferation was also assessed in the presence of CsA.
M139 cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate (5 × 103 cells/
well) and serum-starved for 24 hours; then, RPMI 1640
medium containing 10% FBS and CsA (0, 0.01, 0.1, and
1 μg/mL) was added. Cells were incubated for 48 hours
and subjected to MTS analysis as described above.
Wound healing assay

The M139-shCypA and M139-shV cells were seeded onto
6-well plates (1.5 × 10 6 cells/well) and incubated in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 hours.
Wounds were generated on the surface of confluent
monolayers using a sterile pipette tip, followed by incubation with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0%, 2%,
and 5% FBS. Pictures of a representative field were taken
at 0 and 24 hours after scarification. Cell-free spaces were
measured by ImageJ software and calculated as the wound
width as a measure of cell migration. The wound width
measured at 24 hours for each experiment was normalized
to that measured at initial wound (0 hour), generating the
relative migration distance.
Animal model

The following animal work was approved by the Office
for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) and Animal
Welfare Act guidelines under an animal protocol
approved by Baylor College of Medicine Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. The cells (3 × 106) in a
volume of 100 μL were inoculated into the subcutaneous
tissue of the right flank of 5 to 6-week-old male nude
mice (NCI Charles River); five animals per group were
used. The tumor size was measured weekly using a digital

Page 4 of 15

caliper (VWR international). After 4 weeks, all mice were
euthanized and tumors and organs (liver and lungs) were
harvested; half of each specimen was fixed in buffered
neutral formalin and the remaining half was snap-frozen
in -80 °C.
Statistical analysis

Experimental data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 Windows Evaluation software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All
quantitative data were expressed as mean ± SD. Twotailed Student’s t-test was used for comparison between
two groups. Statistical significance was established at
P < 0.05.

Results
CypA is overexpressed in liver fluke-associated CCA tissue
specimens

Immunostaining for CypA was performed in 57 paraffinembedded tissue specimens from patients with CCA in
order to determine CypA protein expression patterns in
CCA tumors in comparison with adjacent normal bile
duct cells. Strongly positive staining for CypA was frequently observed in tumor specimens, while negative to
moderately positive staining was observed in tumor-adjacent normal bile duct lining cells (Figure 1A). From these
data, a semi-quantitative CypA immunoreactivity index
was generated (Figure 1B). In the 57 tissue specimens,
68.4% (39 of 57) of the specimens had a higher CypA
immunoreactivity index in the tumor tissue when compared with respective adjacent normal bile duct lining
cells; 26.3% (15 of 57) demonstrated equal degrees of
staining; and, only 5.2% (3 of 57) showed weakly positive
staining in normal bile ducts and lack of staining in tumor
areas. From the box plot in Figure 1C, The overall median
CypA immunoreactivity index was significantly higher in
CCA as compared with that of normal bile ducts (P <
0.05; n = 57). This upregulation of CypA in CCA tissues
confirms its potential as a molecular target for CCA
therapy.
Endogenous expression of CypA in CCA cell lines
correlates with cell growth phenotypes

We observed different endogenous CypA mRNA (Figure
2A) and protein (Figure 2B) levels among the 6 CCA
cell lines studied. Comparing with a non-tumor cell line
MMNK1, we divided the CCA cell lines into 2 groups.
The first group had relatively high CypA expression
(M139, M213 and M214); the second group had relatively low CypA expression (M055, KKU100 and M156).
We further observed that, as shown in Figure 2C, the
cells with low CypA levels demonstrated lower rates of
cell proliferation than the cells displaying high CypA
levels.

compared to the adjacent normal bile duct tissue (P < 0.05; n = 57).

Suppression of CypA reduces proliferation of M139 CCA
cells in vitro and reduced proliferation may be mediated
by reduction in PPIase activity

To further study the function of CypA on CCA cell
growth, we determined the effects on cell proliferation
of CypA silencing in M139, M213 and M214 cell lines
(high-CypA cell lines) and CypA overexpression in
M055 and KKU100 cell lines (low-CypA cell lines). For
comparison, MMNK1 cells were included in both gene
silence and overexpression studies. First, we performed
CypA silence. The M139 cells were stably transfected
with a shCypA (OriGene), and this led to about 65%
and 76% CypA silence by real-time PCR (Figure 3A)
and by Western blot analysis (Figure 3B), respectively.
M139 cell transfected with a vector control shV showed
no significant difference in CypA expression relative to
parental M139 cells.
To determine whether the CypA silence affected cell
proliferation, we performed MTS assays on M139shCypA and M139-shV cells. As shown in Figure 3C,

silencing of CypA in M139-shCypA cells was associated
with a 25% reduction in cell proliferation by day 5, compared with that seen in M139-shV cells (Figure 3C, P <
0.05; n = 3).
To examine whether the PPIase activity of CypA could
play a role in cell proliferation, M139 parental cells were
incubated with CsA, an inhibitor of CypA PPIase, at concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg/mL for 48 hours.
Then, MTS assay was performed. Just as was seen with
shRNA-mediated depletion of CypA, CsA treatment inhibited M139 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion
(Figure 3D).
Suppression of CypA reduces migration of M139 CCA
cells in vitro

The effect of CypA silence on cell migration was also
performed. A cell scratch test was carried out using
M139-shCypA cells and the control M139-shV cells.
Briefly, a sub-confluent monolayer of M139-shCypA and
M139-shV cells was wounded at time 0, creating a cell-

M156) had relatively low CypA expression levels, and 3 cell lines (M139, M213, and M214) demonstrated relatively high CypA expression at both

medium supplemented with different serum concentrations (0, 2 and 5% FBS) and monitored by phase-contrast microscope at 0 and 24 hours after wounding. The
representative images taken from the same field at 0
and 24 hours are shown in Figure 4A. A smaller wound
width following incubation, then, indicated a stronger
migration capacity. The semiquantitative data showed
that, for any serum concentration used, the M139-

shCypA cells migrated into the cell free space significantly slower than the control cells (Figure 4B). Thus,
CypA silence significantly reduces CCA cells’ capacity
for migration.
The inhibitory effect of CypA silence on CCA cell
proliferation is not limited to M139 cells

Overall, we assessed the effects of CypA silence on CCA
cell proliferation in three CCA cell lines displaying

shCypA or scramble control shV using Lipofectamine™
2000 as a transfection reagent. ShCypA transfection
reduced CypA mRNA levels to 63%, 75%, 77%, and 70%
in M139, M213, M214, and MMNK1 respectively, in
comparison with levels in the cells transfected with only
the shV control vector. No difference in CypA mRNA
level was observed between the cells transfected with
shV and cells transfected with only Lipofectamine™
2000 (Figure 5A). MTS assay was again used to measure
the cell proliferation. As shown in Figure 5B, silencing
of CypA reduced cell proliferation in all three CCA cell
lines but not in MMNK1. By day 5, proliferation was
reduced by 65% in M139-shCypA cells, 41% in M213shCypA cells, and 44% in M214-shCypA cells, compared
with their respective vector controls (P < 0.05; n = 3).
The cell proliferation of MMNK1 was not different
between two groups.

Forced overexpression of CypA increases CCA cell
proliferation in vitro

We next examined the effects of CypA overexpression in
MMNK1 and two CCA cell lines with relatively low endogenous CypA expression: M055 and KKU100. These cells
were transfected with a pCMV6-XL5-CypA overexpression construct (OriGene) or with pCMV6-XL5 empty vector as a control. Overexpression of CypA in MMNK1
(MMNK1-OX-CypA), M055 (M055-OX-CypA), and
KKU100 (KKU100-OX-CypA) cell lines was confirmed
with real-time PCR (Figure 5C). When compared with
their respective vector control cells (MMNK1-V, KKU100V, and M055-V), CypA mRNA levels increased by 6-fold,
10-fold, and 55-fold in MMNK1-, M055-, and KKU100OX-CypA cells, respectively, 48 hours after transfection.
Cell proliferation was assessed using MTS assay; this
revealed that forced overexpression of CypA in CCA cells
resulted in faster cell proliferation rates when compared
with cells transfected with the empty vector. As shown in
Figure 5D, at day 5 after seeding, cell proliferation rates

Figure 4 Stable silence of CypA reduces wound healing ability, and thus migration ability of M139 cells in vitro. To measure cell migration
potential, wound healing assay was carried out in M139-shV and M139-shCypA cells using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0%, 2%, and 5%
FBS. The wound width measured at 24 hours for each experiment was normalized to that measured at initial wound (0 hour), generating the
relative migration distance. (A) Representative images taken from the same field at 0 and 24 hour. (B) Average relative wound width (relative

for M055-OX-CypA and KKU100-OX-CypA were 30%
and 35% higher than those of M055-V and KKU100-V,
respectively (P < 0.05; n = 3). Again, CypA forced overexpression had no effect on cell proliferation of MMNK1
cells.
CypA depletion attenuates ERK1/2 activity in M139 cells

The Ras-dependent ERK1/2 pathway plays a central role
in controlling cell proliferation [30]. Several reports
demonstrate that CypA-induced cancer cell proliferation
is mediated by its membrane receptor CD147 and the
ERK1/2 signaling pathway [14,17,18,22]. However, it is
not clear whether these molecular mechanisms are
involved in CCA. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide duplexes were designed to specifically target
a 21 base pair nucleotide sequence within CypA mRNA,
corresponding to nucleotide position 334-354 (siCypA;
QiaGen). Scrambled-sequence siRNA duplexes were

used as a negative control (SC; Invitrogen). Transient
suppression of CypA using siCypA in M139 cells inhibited the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a time-dependent
manner; the semi-quantitative analysis showed a positive
correlation between the CypA protein level and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 protein (Figure 6A). Furthermore, the effect of CypA on the ERK1/2 activity was
determined in stable CypA knockdown clones; ERK1/2
activity was substantially decreased in M139-shCypA
cells compared with that in M139-shV cells (Figure 6B).
Thus, CypA appears to be involved in the ERK1/2 signal
transduction pathway.
Suppression of CypA leads to slower tumor growth and
decreased cell proliferation in vivo

The effect of CypA silence on tumor growth was analyzed
in vivo using an immunodeficient nude mouse model (n =
5 for each group). Four weeks after s.c. implantation,

Figure 6 CypA depletion attenuates ERK1/2 activity in M139 cells in vitro. ERK1/2 phosphorylation in CypA knockdown cells was
determined by Western blot analysis. (A) Transient knockdown CypA decreased pERK1/2:ERK1/2 ratio in a time dependent fashion, and CypA
protein level is positively correlated with ERK1/2 activity (phosphorylation). M139 cells (2 × 105 cells) were seeded in 6-well plate for 24 hours
before being transfected with 100 pmole/mL siRNA against CypA or negative control siRNA for 6 hours before replacing with complete medium.
Lipofectamine™ 2000 was used as a transfection reagent. Total proteins were collected at 24, 48, and 72 hours after transfection. (B) Stable
knockdown CypA cells had lower ERK activity (phosphorylation) than the control cells. Protein samples were collected from M139-shV and M139shCypA cells grown in complete medium for 24 hours. All samples were subjected to Western blot analysis for CypA, ERK1/2 and pERK1/2
detection, and b-actin was used as a loading control. Intensity of the immunoreactive bands was measured by ImageQuant TL software (GE
Healthcare). Protein level of each sample was normalized to b-actin prior to comparison between samples. The pERK1/2:ERK1/2 ratio value
reflects ERK1/2 activity.

tumors were removed, weighed and processed for further
histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Tumors
from mice injected with M139-shCypA cells were smaller
in size and weight compared with those from mice treated
with M139-shV cells; there was a 43% reduction in weight
in the M139-shCypA tumors (0.138 ± 0.107 g vs 0.240 ±
0.187 g, Figure 7A). Furthermore, we confirmed that
CypA silence persisted in the M139-shCypA cell line-

derived tumors by real-time PCR and immunostaining for
CypA (Figure 7B and 7C). We also determined that
tumors from M139-shCypA injected mice demonstrated
reduced cell proliferation, as indicated by fewer Ki-67
positive staining nuclei than observed in vector control
tumors (P < 0.05; Figure 7C and 7D). These results indicate that CypA silence had a significant effect on tumor
growth in vivo.

Discussions
CCA is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and has
an extremely poor prognosis; therefore, the identification
of novel molecular targets for the diagnosis, prognosis,
and treatment of CCA is a critical task for investigators.
There are numerous studies suggesting a role for CypA in
tumorigenesis and progression of human cancer, and overexpression of CypA in various tumor tissues has been
shown to both confer growth advantage and correlate with
poor clinical outcomes [31]. At present, however, little is
known about the expression of CypA in CCA tissue specimens. Using expressed sequence tags, CypA was reported
to be upregulated in intrahepatic CCA compared with
normal liver tissues [32]. In this study, however, using
immunohistochemistry, we provide evidence for the first

time that CypA is localized in tumor bile duct epithelia
and upregulated in CCA tumor tissue samples as compared with tumor-adjacent normal bile duct lining cells. In
addition, we determined that normal bile ducts along the
margins of tumor areas, as well as proliferative normal bile
ducts, frequently display stronger positive staining for
CypA than seen in more geographically distant points
along the bile ducts. These observations suggest that “normal” bile duct near the tumor margin and proliferative
bile duct are probably not normal molecularly, regardless
of their histological appearance. Furthermore, we observed
that normal liver tissues in all specimens either lack CypA
staining or demonstrate weak background staining, which
implies that using CypA as a molecular target for CCA
treatment may be feasible.

In the present study, we demonstrated that reducing
PPIase activity of CypA by CsA also significantly
decreased proliferation of CCA cell lines. CsA is an active
compound which specifically inhibits the activity of
cyclophilin family, of which CypA is the major and tightest-binding CsA target identified to date [33,34]. It binds
with sub-nanomolar affinity to CypA via contact within
the hydrophobic pocket of CypA and inhibits its PPIase
activity [35]. As an inhibitor of CypA PPIase activity,
either as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, CsA induced antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects at clinically achievable levels [36-38].
In addition, CsA and its non-immunosuppressive derivative NIM811 were shown to have similar capability of
inducing apoptosis of malignant melanoma cells in vitro
and in vivo studies [39]. Thus, targeting CypA using CsA
as a chemosensitizer, CsA derivatives without immunosuppressant activity, and novel inhibitors of CypA may
likely improve cancer treatment including CCA.
Importantly, our in vitro cell proliferation studies
clearly showed that CypA positively regulates CCA cell
proliferation. CypA silence significantly reduces cell proliferation in M139, M213, and M214 cells, while forced
overexpression of CypA in two other CCA cell lines,
M055 and KKU100, had the converse effect; M055 and
KKU100 cells overexpressing CypA demonstrated significantly higher rates of cell proliferation than the respective vector control cells, which had relatively low
endogenous CypA expression. On the other hand, it
seems that CypA does not play significant role in controlling cell proliferation of a non-tumor cholangiocyte cells
as manipulating CypA levels by gene knockdown and
overexpression experiments had no effects on MMNK1
cell proliferation. A previous study reported that CypA is
a key factor for vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation;
in contrast, it induces endothelial cell apoptosis [40].
These different results reflect multiple functions of CypA
in different cell types depending on intracellular contexts,
binding partners as well as its positive/negative
regulators.
The functional role of CypA in cancer cell differentiation is not clear. Our data indicate that malignant phenotypes, including cell proliferation, migration, and drug
resistance properties, of CCA cells are not necessarily
correlated with cell differentiation. For example, M055
cell line, which derived from poorly differentiated cholangiocarcinoma is the slowest growing cell compared with
other CCA cell lines, and it is also most susceptible to
apoptosis. In the present study, we observed that the
CypA level in parental CCA cells agreed with the cell
proliferation rate of each cell line regardless of the degree
of cell differentiation, implying that CypA may be one of
the molecules that play an important role in CCA cell
proliferation.

Page 12 of 15

Tumor weight measured in shCypA-inoculated mice
was higher than that of shV-inoculated mice; cell proliferation in using Ki-67 staining clearly showed reduced
cell proliferation rates in CypA silence tumors (93 ±
12.5) compared with tumors expressing scramble control vector (186 ± 36.0, P < 0.05). These results were
consistent with previous studies in endometrial carcinoma [25], osteosarcoma [23] and lung cancer [41].

Conclusions
We demonstrated that CypA is upregulated in human
CCA samples; CypA expression correlates with a malignant cell growth phenotype in CCA cell lines; inhibiting
CypA expression reduces CCA cell proliferation and
migration in vitro, with the effects on proliferation likely
mediated by reduced enzymatic activity and that the
ERK1/2 pathway may be involved; overexpression of CypA
enhances cell proliferation; and, finally, that suppression of
CypA reduces tumor size and cell proliferation in vivo. As
an autocrine/paracrine mechanism, extracellular CypA
could activate the ERK1/2 pathway via CD147. Reduction
of intracellular CypA levels via shRNA may lead to insufficient extracellular CypA levels, which in turn reduce cell
proliferation. On the other hand, intracellular CypA itself
may mediate gene expression or act as a chaperone for its
membrane receptor CD147 [22,42,43]. Based on our
results and other published data, we schematically show
the possible mechanisms of CypA-mediated cell proliferation in CCA (Figure 8). CypA is upregulated in CCA cells,
and several carcinogenic factors including cell stress
response genes, HIF-1a and activated p53, may increase
CypA expression [44,45]; the high CypA levels could
directly or indirectly activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and NF-B pathway [46], which in turn mediate gene
transcription of interleukin (IL)-8, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 3 and 9 [47]. CypA may act as a chaperone
protein to facilitate CD147 membrane expression and stabilization; and CypA may be secreted by CCA cells and
act as an autocrine/paracrine molecule via CD147, thereby
activating the ERK1/2 pathway and stimulating cell proliferation. In the future, detailed studies on molecular
mechanisms by which CypA affects cancer progress in
CCA will help us to understand more about this devastating cancer and develop new chemotherapeutic agents. For
examples, specific inhibitor of CypA without immunosuppressive effect and a CD147 inhibitor, Licartin, should be
included in future investigations [48,49]. Presently, we are
engaged in an ongoing project focused on the roles of
extracellular CypA and its trans-membrane receptor
CD147 as well as the subsequent downstream signaling
pathway; we hope to gain new insight into the molecular
mechanisms by which CypA promotes CCA cell proliferation. These studies may be further extended into an investigation of the role of CypA in the regulation of CCA cell

Figure 8 A schematic representation of a proposed mechanism involved in CypA-mediated cell proliferation in CCA. CypA is
upregulated in CCA cells, and several carcinogenic factors such as HIF-1a and p53 may regulate CypA expression. Unusual high CypA protein
level may lead to sustained activation of ERK1/2 and NF-kB through direct or indirect mechanisms, which in turn activate cell survival,
proliferation, and tumor progression. CypA may be secreted from the cells and act as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor via interacting with
its membrane receptor CD147. Using specific inhibitor against CypA or against CypA/CD147 binding may inhibit CCA cell proliferation and
tumor progression.

growth in the complex tumor environment. Finally, treatment with non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives, novel
CypA inhibitors and/or inhibitors of CypA-mediated signaling may lead to better treatment outcomes for CCA
patients with high CypA expression.
