Abstract
The prehistory of African trypanosomiasis indicates that the disease may have been an important
selective factor in the evolution of hominids. Ancient history and medieval history reveal that
African trypanosomiasis affected the lives of people living in sub-Saharan African at all times.
Modern history of African trypanosomiasis revolves around the identification of the causative
agents and the mode of transmission of the infection, and the development of drugs for treatment
and methods for control of the disease. From the recent history of sleeping sickness we can learn
that the disease can be controlled but probably not be eradicated. Current history of human
African trypanosomiasis has shown that the production of anti-sleeping sickness drugs is not always
guaranteed, and therefore, new, better and cheaper drugs are urgently required.

Background
African trypanosomiasis is an infectious disease of
humans and animals of similar aetiology and epidemiology. The causative agents of the disease are protozoan parasites of the genus Trypanosoma that live and multiply
extracellularly in blood and tissue fluids of their mammalian hosts and are transmitted by the bite of infected tsetse
flies (Glossina sp.). The distribution of trypanosomaisis in
Africa corresponds to the range of tsetse flies and comprises currently an area of 8 million km2 between 14
degrees North and 20 degrees South latitude [1]. Throughout history, African trypanosomiasis has severely
repressed the economic and cultural development of Central Africa.
African animal trypanosomiasis or nagana disease is
caused by T. congolense, T. vivax and T. brucei spp. In wild
animals, these parasites cause relatively mild infections
while in domestic animals they cause a severe, often fatal
disease. All domestic animals can be affected by nagana
and the symptoms are fever, listlessness, emaciation, hair
loss, discharge from the eyes, oedema, anaemia, and

paralysis. As the illness progresses the animals weaken
more and more and eventually become unfit for work,
hence the name of the disease "N'gana" which is a Zulu
word that means "powerless/useless" [2]. Because of
nagana, stock farming is very difficult within the tsetse
belt.
Human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness is
caused by two subspecies of T. brucei, T. brucei gambiense
and T. brucei rhodesiense, while the third subspecies, T. brucei brucei, is only infectious to animals. T. b. gambiense is
responsible for the chronic form of sleeping sickness in
West and Central Africa, whereas T. b. rhodesiense gives rise
to the acute form of the disease in East and Southern
Africa. There are two distinct stages during the course of
sleeping sickness. The first or early stage of the disease,
also known as the haemolymphatic phase, is defined by
the restriction of the trypanosomes to the blood and
lymph system [3]. The symptoms of this stage are fever,
headaches, joint pains and itching. The second or late
stage of the disease, also known as the neurological phase,
is characterised by the presence of the parasites in the cerPage 1 of 8

ebrospinal fluid [3]. In general, this is when the typical
signs of the disease occur: confusion, disturbed sleep pattern, sensory disturbances, extreme lethargy, poor condition and coma. If left untreated, sleeping sickness patients
die within months when infected with T. b. rhodesiense or
within years when infected with T. b. gambiense. Wild and
domestic animals may play a major role as parasite reservoirs for human infections with trypanosomes [3-5].

Prehistory
Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the genes coding for
the small subunit ribosomal RNA suggested that all Salivarian trypanosomes (to which African trypanosomes
belong) separated from other trypanosomes approximately 300 million years ago [6]. Probably soon after
their emergence, Salivarian trypanosomes became gut
parasites or commensals of early insects, which evolved
around 380 million years ago. With the appearance of
tsetse flies some 35 million years ago, trypanosomes have
been transmitted to mammals by these bloodsucking
insects. The long coexistence of both tsetse flies and game
animals may explain why most African wildlife species are
tolerant of trypanosomiasis: they become infected by the
parasite but show no ill effects [7]. In contrast, domestic
animals have yet been unable to develop tolerance or
resistance to trypanosome infections within the 13000
years of their breeding.
It is likely that trypanosomiasis has played an important
role in early hominid evolution. Probably, the disease had
an important role in the selection of trypanosome-resistant early terrestrial hominids. This is evident from the
observation that arboreal primates are susceptible to
trypanosomiasis while humans, with the exception of T.
b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infections, are resistant
[7]. The fact that humans are resistant to all other African
trypanosome species indicates that human African
trypanosomiasis is a recent event in human development.
Presumably the sustained transmission of trypanosomes
between tsetse flies and humans in West Africa has led to
the evolution of the less virulent T. b. gambiense subspecies
[7]. In contrast, the T. b. rhodesiense subspecies has
remained ill-adapted to humans and is transmitted from
game animals to humans [7]. The infectivity of T. b. rhodesiense to humans is due to a serum-resistant-associated
(SRA) gene [8]. It seems that the SRA gene originated in a
single event and then spread through T. brucei in East
Africa by genetic exchange [9].

Antiquity
It is well established that in ancient times the north coast
of the African continent held more lush vegetation than
today [10]. Also the flora and fauna of the Nile valley during the Old Kingdom (3000 BC – 2000 BC) was quite different and probably similar to the current region of the

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/3

Gazelle River (one of the major tributaries of the Nile
River) in Sudan [2]. The distribution of tsetse flies should
therefore have extended much more northwards and
ranged into the Nile delta. Hence, it is reasonable to
assume that shepherds and livestock breeders in these
regions experienced the problem of trypanosomiasis. This
is also evident from the fact that the Egyptians of the Old
Kingdom kept their cattle together with game animals [2].
The ancient Egyptians did this not because they were inexperienced in breeding but could only successfully rear
trypanotolerant animals. Further evidence for the presence of trypanosomiasis in ancient Egypt comes from the
Veterinary Papyrus of the Kahun Papyri dating from 2nd
millennium BC [11] in which a cattle disease is described
that resembles nagana (Fig. 1). It seems that an ointment
made from the fat of particular birds was used as treatment against the bite of flies [12]. During the course of the
Middle Kingdom (2000 BC – 1300 BC) the stream course
of the Nile River was adjusted and thus the breeding sites
of tsetse flies were largely destroyed. At that time the Egyptians gave up raising game animals and discontinued
growing pure breeds of the trypanotolerant aurochs (Bos
primigenius). Instead, they interbred the aurochs with the
more efficient Indian zebu cattle (Bos indicus) [2]. The
gradual eradication of the tsetse fly due to the progressing
regulation of the Nile River eventually allowed the ancient
Egyptians to raise pure breeds of zebu cattle [2]. In addition, it is told that the horse, which was not introduced
until the 16th century BC, was also difficult to breed in
ancient Egypt [2]. It is probable that failure in horse breeding was also due to trypanosome infections by tsetse flies.

Middle Ages
There are only a few written reports giving evidence for the
occurrence of trypanosomiasis in Africa during the Middle
Ages. Most of these reports are from the Arabs who kept
close trade relations with the West African kingdoms such
as Benin, Ghana, Mali and Songhai. One of the first historical records on human trypanosomiasis is by the
famous Arabian geographer Abu Abdallah Yaqut (1179–
1229). During his journey into Africa he found in the
"Country of Gold" (Wangara [13]) an underground village whose inhabitants and even their dogs were just skin
and bones and asleep [2]. This scene is reminiscent of the
devastating sleeping sickness epidemic in Uganda at the
turn of the 20th century. A first case report of sleeping sickness comes from the Arabian historian Ibn Khaldun
(1332–1406). In his historical work he reported that a fellow countryman told him about the death of the Sultan
Mari Jata, Emperor of Mali, who died of an illness which,
according to the description, corresponds to human
trypanosomiasis [14]: "He told me that Jata had been
smitten by the sleeping illness, a disease which frequently
afflicts the inhabitants of that climate, especially the chieftains who are habitually affected by sleep. Those afflicted

from 2nd millennium BC. The translation reads as follows: (1) Title: Treatment of the eyes (?) of a bull with ushau in winter.

are virtually never awake or alert. The sickness harms the
patient and continues until he perishes. He said that the
illness persisted in Jata's humour for a duration of two
years after which he died in the year 775 AM (= 1373/74
in our calendar)."
A striking example of the impact of trypanosomiasis on
the life and destiny of people is the eastward migration of
the Fulbe (Fulani) in the northern parts of West Africa [2].

It is believed that in ancient times the Fulbe people have
moved from Egypt or Ethiopia to the area of present-day
Senegal. At the beginning of the 13th century when the
Sahara was getting increasingly dryer, they were forced to
relocate southwesterly into the savannah area. As cattlebreeding was their economic basis, the Fulbe did not risk
continuing their migration southward otherwise they
would have entered the tsetse belt and lost their herds.
Hence, they moved eastward and settled south of the

Sahara but north of the tsetse belt in regions with sufficient grazing land.

Modern Times
Early Modern Times
In early Modern Times, the history of human African
trypanosomiasis is closely linked to the slave trade. First
accounts of sleeping sickness came from ship doctors and
medical officers who worked for slave-trade companies.
As sleeping sickness caused increasing losses, ship-owners
and slave-traders pressed their ship doctors to investigate
this eerie disease. In 1734, the English naval surgeon John
Aktins (1685–1757) published the first accurate medical
report on African sleeping sickness [15]. However,
whereas Aktins described only the neurological symptoms
of the late stage of sleeping sickness, the English physician
Thomas Winterbottom (1766–1859) published in 1803 a
report referring to the characteristic sign of swollen lymph
glands along the back of the neck in the early stage of the
disease [15]. He also mentioned that this symptom was
known long ago by Arabian slave-traders who refrained
from buying slaves with this sign [2]. Although throughout the 19th century, reports on sleeping sickness
increased and human African trypanosomiasis became a
well-recognised disease, no one had any real idea about
the nature of the illness [15].
Discovery of the tsetse fly-trypanosome complex
It was the Scottish missionary and explorer David Livingston (1813–1875) who first suggested that nagana is
caused by the bite of tsetse flies. In 1852, he reported the
occurrence of a disease in the valleys of the Limpopo and
Zambezi rivers as well as at the banks of the lakes Nyasa
and Tanganyika from which all the cattle he carried died
after they have been bitten by tsetse flies [2]. However, it
took another 40–50 years until trypanosomes were identified as the causative agents of nagana and sleeping sickness. In 1895, the Scottish pathologist and microbiologist
David Bruce (1855–1931) (Fig. 2) discovered T. brucei as
the cause of cattle trypanosomiasis (cattle nagana) [16].
The first unequivocal observation of trypanosomes in
human blood was made by the British Colonial surgeon
Robert Michael Forde (1861–1948) in 1901 when he
examined a steamboat captain in The Gambia [17]. He
first thought that the organisms he found were worms
[15] but the English physician Joseph Everett Dutton
(1874–1905) identified them as trypanosomes a few
months later and proposed in 1902 the species name
Trypanosoma gambiense (now T. b. gambiense) [18]. In the
same year, the Italian physician and pathologist Aldo Castellani (1878–1971) found trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid of sleeping sickness patients and suggested
that they cause sleeping sickness [15,19]. One year later,
Bruce provided conclusive evidence that sleeping sickness
is transmitted by tsetse flies [15,20]. At that time, how-

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/3

ever, he believed that trypanosomes were transmitted
mechanically by tsetse flies [15]. It was the German military surgeon Friedrich Karl Kleine (1869–1951) who
showed in 1909 the cyclical transmission of T. brucei in
tsetse flies [21]. This prompted Bruce to change his original opinion of mechanical transmission of trypanosomes,
and instead describe the full developmental cycle of the
parasites within their insect host [15]. In the meantime,
the two other animal pathogenic trypanosome species T.
congolense and T. vivax were discovered in 1904 and 1905
by the Belgian physician Alphonse Broden (1875–1929)
[22] and the German naval doctor Hans Ziemann (1865–
1905) [23], respectively. The second human pathogenic
trypanosome species, T. rhodesiense (now T. b. rhodesiense), was eventually recovered in 1910 by the parasitologists John William Watson Stephens (1865–1946) and
Harold Benjamin Fantham (1876–1937) [24].
Epidemics and control of the disease
In the 20th century, Africa saw three severe sleeping sickness epidemics. The first one began in 1896 and lasted
until 1906, and affected mainly Uganda and Congo [3]. It
was a devastating epidemic with 300,000 and 500,000
people estimated to have died in the Congo Basin and the
Busoga focus in Uganda and Kenya, respectively [20,25].
The disastrous effects of the epidemic worried the colonial
administrations to such an extent that they sent out scientific missions to investigate the disease (see above) and to
develop a cure [2,20]. The French physician Charles Louis
Alphonse Laveran (1845–1922) and the French biologist
Félix Mesnil (1868–1938) were the first to report in 1902
that sodium arsenite was effective in infected laboratory
animals [15]. In 1904, a paper was published by the Canadian doctor Harold Wolferstan Thomas (1875–1931),
and the Austrian doctor and zoologist Anton Breinl
(1880–1944), informing that the arsenical drug atoxyl
could cure experimentally infected animals [2]. It was
thought to be better than any other arsenical compound
tested so far and relatively atoxic (hence the name) [2].
However, the German physician Robert Koch (1843–
1910), who investigated the trypanocidal activity of atoxyl
on sleeping sickness patients on the Ssese Islands located
in the northwest of Lake Victoria, found that the drug was
by no means nontoxic; of 1622 atoxyl-treated patients
Koch observed 22 cases of atrophy of the optic nerve with
complete blindness [2]. In 1907, Koch informed the German scientist Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915) about these complications and advised him to improve the drug atoxyl [2].
Already in 1904 Ehrlich had become interested in the
chemotherapy of trypanosomiasis and had developed the
dye trypan red, which proved to be both curative and prophylactic for T. equinum (a species of trypanosomes that
causes Mal de Caderas in horses in Central and South
America) in mice but not for T. brucei [26]. Eventually, it
was Ehrlich's former assistant Wilhelm Roehl (1881–

1929) who in 1916, with the help of a small team of
chemists and the German chemical and pharmaceutical
company Bayer, developed the first effective drug for treatment of sleeping sickness. The compound, Bayer 205,
(later named suramin) is still in use in the therapy of
early-stage T. b. rhodesiense infections [2]. A year earlier,
the American chemist Walter A. Jacobs (1883–1967) and
the American immunologist Michael Heidelberger
(1888–1991) discovered the organo-arsenical tryparsamide. This was the first drug to treat late-stage sleeping
sickness alone, or in combination with suramin, and was
also employed in the treatment of animal trypanosomiasis [26]. Both drugs helped to fight the second major
sleeping sickness epidemic which began in a number of
African countries in 1920 and died down by the late
1940s (Fig. 3) [3,27]. Another important measure towards
the control of the 1920s sleeping sickness epidemic was
the introduction of mobile teams [20]. This method of
systematic case detection and treatment with the aim of
elimination of the parasite reservoir was suggested by the
French military surgeon Eugène Jamot (1879–1937). In
1926, after long opposition by his superiors in Paris,
Jamot was allowed to set up a special service in Cameroon
that showed the effectiveness of his approach; within 11

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/3

years the prevalence levels of sleeping sickness declined
from 60% in 1919 to 0.2–4.1% in 1930 [20]. Subsequently, other colonial powers introduced the method of
mobile teams for T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness control
[20]. Other approaches to the control of African trypanosomiasis were vector control, host reservoir control and
game destruction [20]. Vector control was already introduced in 1910 and included the use of differently
designed traps and bush clearing. Between 1920 and
1940, reservoir host control and game destruction, which
was practised mainly in East Africa on the recommendation of Bruce, resulted in a significant reduction, but never
in the extermination, of the tsetse fly population [20]. A
third drug for treatment of the early stage of T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness, pentamidine, was developed by the
English chemist Arthur James Ewins (1882–1958) of the
pharmaceutical company May and Baker in 1937 [28].
With the discovery of its insecticidal properties in 1939,
DDT was used by 1949 in the hope of freeing large parts
of endemic areas from tsetse flies [2,20]. Also in 1949, the
arsenical melarsoprol, which was developed by the Swiss
pathologist, microbiologist and chemist Ernst Friedheim
(1899–1989), was introduced for the treatment of late
stage human African trypanosomiasis. It was the first and
is still the only effective drug for late stage T. b. rhodesiense
sleeping sickness. Since the 1950s, several drugs have
become available for chemotherapy of animal trypanosomiasis. These include the phenanthridine derivatives
homidium bromide (Ethidium®, Novidium®) and isometamidium chloride (Samorin®, Trypamidium®), the aminoquinaldine derivative quinapyramine (Anthrycid®) and
the aromatic diamidine diminazene aceturate (Berenil®)
[29]. Eventually, the combined employment of chemotherapy, systematic case detection and vector control led
to a dramatic reduction in the incidence of sleeping sickness at the beginning of the 1960s (Fig. 3) [27].
Other factors that affected the epidemiology of sleeping
sickness in the first half of the last century are the socioeconomic conditions created during the colonisation of
Africa. An excellent example of this is the sleeping sickness
epidemic in the north-central Uele district of the former
Belgian Congo, now known as the Democratic Republic
of Congo [30]. Colonisation of this region in the first decade of the 19th century was protracted and brutal. Large
numbers of people were displaced and many of them
experienced famine. This created an ideal environment for
spreading the disease and sleeping sickness became
increasingly entrenched and epidemic in this region over
the next 15 years. It was not until the mid 1920s that medical services were introduced in the Uele district by the
colonial powers. Five years later, the epidemic was under
control due, as claimed by the Belgian authorities, to the
medical interventions. However, improvements in nutrition and hygiene are likely to have had as much to do with

the decline of sleeping sickness as the medical interventions [30]. By the 1930s, many people in Belgian Congo
no longer suffered from intense social and economic disruption and learned how to better cope with the rules and
controls of the colonial powers while the Belgians at the
same time ceased their social engineering practice of
abrupt resiting of whole communities [30].
By the mid 1960s, most of the trypanosomiasis-endemic
countries became independent and were no longer supported by their former colonial powers. In the aftermath
of decolonisation, many African countries experienced
political instability and economic ruin with a disastrous
effect on the health services. After a decade of low endemicity, the control of trypanosomiasis was no longer a priority. As a consequence, control programmes were
stopped and population screening declined to very small
numbers of people (Fig. 3) [27]. Concerns about the environmental effect of DDT led to a ban of the insecticide in
disease vector control worldwide in the 1970s. The result
of all this was that since the mid 1970s there has been a
steady increase in the number of reported sleeping sickness cases (Fig. 3) [27]. This was the beginning of the third
and most recent sleeping sickness epidemic in the 20th
century, mainly affecting Angola, Congo, Southern Sudan
and the West Nile district of Uganda [3,20]. The situation
remained unchanged until 1990 when eflornithine (DLα-difluoromethylornithine, DFMO), a selective inhibitor
of ornithine decarboxylase, was introduced for treatment
of late stage T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness. Eflornithine
was initially developed by scientists at the Merrell

Research Institute in Strasbourg for treatment of cancer
[31], but was then found to be an effective therapeutic
agent against T. b. gambiense. Although the administration
regime is strict and difficult, eflornithine was a welcome
alternative to melarsoprol treatment as it is less toxic.
Recent developments and current situation
At the turn of the millennium, the scale of sleeping sickness had almost reached, yet again, the levels of the epidemics seen at the beginning of the century (Fig. 3)
[27,32]. The situation got even worse as the production of
eflornithine was ceased and that of melarsoprol was
threatened to be discontinued. Fortunately, in 2001 the
World Health Organization (WHO) reached an agreement with the pharmaceutical companies Aventis (now
Sanofi-Aventis) and Bayer AG to provide sleeping sickness
drugs free of charge for endemic countries [3,32]. The aid
organisation Médicins Sans Frontières was commissioned
with the distribution of the drugs. By 1997, surveillance
had been reinforced and since 1998 the number of new
cases has dropped steadily (Fig. 3) [33]. At present, the
estimated number of infected patients is thought to be
between 50,000 and 70,000 [3].

In 2001, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)
launched a new initiative, the Pan African Tsetse and
Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) to
eliminate the tsetse fly from Africa [34]. It was planned to
employ an area-wide approach using odour-baited traps,
insecticide-treated targets and pour-ons and ultra-low volume aerial spraying of insecticides to reduce the tsetse fly

population, and finally the sterile male technique to
ensure total elimination of the target Glossina species [34].
The sterile male technique was successfully used in the
eradication of tsetse flies and thus trypanosomiasis on the
island of Zanzibar in 1997 [35]. However, in contrast to
the Zanzibar project, which worked because it was on an
island (isolated area of 1,651 km2) infested with only one
tsetse fly species, the PATTEC initiative has to deal with a
vast area of sub-Saharan Africa (~10 million km2) inhabited by at least 7 different Glossina species recognised as
vectors for transmission of sleeping sickness. Therefore,
many scientists are sceptical that the PATTEC project will
succeed as similar eradication campaigns failed in the past
because the tsetse fly infested areas could not be isolated
[36]. The huge costs associated with the eradication
project are also a concern as most of the countries
involved belong to the most heavily indebted poor countries in the world [36].
The only new drug candidate currently in development for
treatment of sleeping sickness is the diamidine pafuramidine (DB289). In January 2007, pafuramidine had completed enrolment for Phase III clinical trials in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola [37,38] which
is the final step before the compound can be registered as
a drug against human African trypanosomiasis. If successful, pafuramidine would be the first orally available treatment for early stage sleeping sickness. Another approach
to improve the treatment of sleeping sickness is the development of a combination therapy. Currently, the antiChagas disease drug, nifurtimox, is being tested in combination with melarsoprol or eflornithine in a randomized
clinical trial in Uganda [39,40].
There is also an urgent need for accurate tools for the diagnosis of human African trypanosomiasis. The existing
tests for diagnosis are not sensitive and specific enough,
due to the characteristically low number of parasites
found in the blood of sleeping sickness patients. Therefore, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics
(FIND) and the WHO launched, in 2006, a new initiative
for the development of new diagnostic tests to support the
control of sleeping sickness [41]. It is expected that the
new test will allow for early case detection and simplified
staging and, thus, will improve disease management and
support for the elimination of sleeping sickness as a public health problem.

appropriate method for the control of sleeping sickness
and that discontinuation of these control measures will
lead to re-emergence and spread of the disease. History
has also shown that African trypanosomiasis always prevented the introduction of stock farming in endemic
areas. A consequence of this is that much of tropical Africa
is still present today and has not been converted into
grassland for cattle breeding.

Conclusion
The history of African trypanosomiasis gives an example
of how a disease not only affected the evolution of
humans but also the cultural and economic development
of people in sub-Saharan regions. From the historical
events of the 20th century one can learn that a concerted
approach of systematic case detection and treatment is the
