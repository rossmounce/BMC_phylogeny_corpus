Abstract
Background: Group I introns have spread into over 90 different sites in nuclear ribosomal DNA
(rDNA) with greater than 1700 introns reported in these genes. These ribozymes generally spread
through endonuclease-mediated intron homing. Another putative pathway is reverse splicing
whereby a free group I intron inserts into a homologous or heterologous RNA through
complementary base-pairing between the intron and exon RNA. Reverse-transcription of the RNA
followed by general recombination results in intron spread. Here we used phylogenetics to test for
reverse splicing spread in a taxonomically broadly sampled data set of fungal group I introns
including 9 putatively ancient group I introns in the rDNA of the yeast-like symbiont Symbiotaphrina
buchneri.
Results: Our analyses reveal a complex evolutionary history of the fungal introns with many cases
of vertical inheritance (putatively for the 9 introns in S. buchneri) and intron lateral transfer. There
are several examples in which introns, many of which are still present in S. buchneri, may have
spread through reverse splicing into heterologous rDNA sites. If the S. buchneri introns are ancient
as we postulate, then group I intron loss was widespread in fungal rDNA evolution.
Conclusion: On the basis of these results, we suggest that the extensive distribution of fungal
group I introns is at least partially explained by the reverse splicing movement of existing introns
into ectopic rDNA sites.

Background
Group I introns are autocatalytic RNAs that are widespread in organellar and nuclear genomes of eukaryotes,
in eubacteria, and in phages and viruses [reviewed in [14]]. How these elements "move" within and between
genes and between natural populations and species is
poorly understood [4,5]. Two mechanisms are invoked to

explain group I intron spread. The first is homing and is
initiated by an intron-encoded endonuclease (homing
endonuclease gene [HEG]) that recognizes and cleaves an
intron-less allele at or near the intron insertion site
[reviewed in [6]]. Following endonuclease cleavage at a
specific 15 – 20 nt target sequence, the intron-containing
allele is used as the template in a double-strand break

repair pathway resulting in insertion of the intron and coconversion of flanking exon sequences [7,8]. HEGs appear
to be recurrently gained, degenerate, and lost in a cyclical
manner and the intron-HEG combination is eventually
lost from a population after all individuals are fixed for
these elements [9]. A recent analysis in our lab of HEGs in
nuclear rDNA group I introns showed that these coding
regions are mobile elements (as has been shown for many
organellar group I introns [reviewed in [6]]) that move
either to introns in homologous rDNA sites or to introns
in neighboring sites in often evolutionarily distantly
related species [4,10,11]. The invading HEGs can then
mobilize their new intron partners and achieve rapid
spread within populations. However, our in-depth phylogenetic analyses of the HEGs failed to show the involvement of these endonucleases in the movement of group I
introns into distant rDNA sites [10]. This type of long-distance (e.g., >50 nt) movement has, however, been suggested by phylogenetic studies that show group I introns
from sites such as SSU rDNA S287 and S1199 (numbering
based on the Escherichia coli gene) to be closely related
[12].
Long-distance intron movement can in principle be
achieved by reverse splicing that facilitates intron mobility
through an RNA intermediate [13-16]. In reverse splicing,
group I introns recognize their target sequence through
complementary base pairing with a short (4–6 nt) inter-

nal guide sequence (see Fig. 1) followed by integration
into the transcript [e.g., [14]] and then putatively reversetranscription, and general recombination to achieve
spread. The importance of this pathway in group I intron
movement in nature, however, remains to be established
because reverse splicing-mediated intron movement has
not been demonstrated in genetic crosses. Furthermore,
whereas homing is highly efficient in spreading introns in
populations, it is likely that reverse splicing with its reliance on chance integration followed by two additional
steps (i.e., reverse-transcription, recombination) would
be less efficient in promoting intron movement. An additional constraint is that rDNA exists as a multi-copy gene
family necessitating that alleles containing transferred
introns must rise to high frequency (presumably through
concerted evolution or less parsimoniously, repeated
reverse splicing events) in individuals and in populations
to ensure survival and ultimately, fixation. If group I
introns are weakly deleterious, then fixation may occur
only in species with small population sizes [17]. These
considerations suggest that rare reverse splicing events
may be most successfully recognized in the context of
broadly sampled host and intron phylogenies in which
many potential candidates for reverse splicing movement
are studied. The large collection of fungal group I introns
that has recently accumulated provides an ideal opportunity to test comprehensively the contribution of reverse
splicing to the extant intron distribution.

This tree is inferred from a combined data set of nuclear SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA, and RPB2 from 84 species of the Ascomycota with one basidiomycete species used as the outgroup. The phylogram represents the majority rule consensus tree of
40,000 post-burnin trees sampled by the Bayesian search algorithm. The lengths for each branch were averaged over all trees
having this branch (sumt option in MrBayes v30b4). Numbers above internodes are posterior probabilities (when ≥95%). Values below the internodes are NJ bootstrap proportions. If both the Bayesian posterior probabilities are ≥95% and the NJ bootstrap support are ≥70%, the internal branch is shown as a thicker line. The grey box delimits the genus Symbiotaphrina (bluish

To assess whether phylogenetic evidence exists that is consistent with a reverse splicing mechanism of group I
intron spread, we analyzed a large group I intron data set
(189 sequences) from the Pezizomycotina. These fungi
are particularly intron-rich with some taxa containing up
to 10 ribozymes in the rDNA (e.g., Physconia perisidiosa).
In addition, we included 10 rDNA group I introns from
the yeast-like fungal symbiont of anobiid beetles, Symbiotaphrina spp. [18]. We addressed two questions with this
study: 1) Is there phylogenetic evidence for the reverse
splicing-mediated spread of group I introns in the Pezizomycotina fungi? 2) Are the multiple group I introns in
Symbiotaphrina spp. that are shared with other fungi the
result of independent lateral transfers into the rDNA genes
of these taxa, or have some or all of these introns been vertically inherited in the fungi? For the latter question we
were particularly interested in determining whether Symbiotaphrina, which lives in the gut of beetles and could
therefore theoretically come in contact with many different cells, be a potential vector for group I intron spread.
Although many studies have provided evidence for the
movement of group I and group II introns across broad
evolutionary lines [e.g., [5,12,19-22]], there is little
known about the vectors that facilitate their spread. Our
analyses demonstrate a complex evolutionary history of
the fungal introns with many cases of vertical inheritance
(putatively for the 9 introns in S. buchneri) and intron lateral transfer. In addition, there are several examples in
which introns, many of which are still present in S. buchneri, may have spread through reverse splicing into heterologous rDNA sites.

Results and discussion
General patterns of fungal group I intron inheritance
We took advantage of the most group I intron-rich of all
eukaryotes, the Pezizomycotina fungi (in particular, the
lichen-forming fungi [12,23]), to address the movement
and long-term evolution of these mobile elements. The
nuclear group I introns are found exclusively in rDNA
genes with some taxa containing 7 (Gymnoderma coccocarpum), 8 (Diplotomma epipolium), 9 (Symbiotaphrina
buchneri), or 10 insertions (Physconia perisidiosa
[12,23]) in their SSU and LSU rDNA. To facilitate the
analysis of fungal group I introns, we first inferred a
"host" tree of the Pezizomycotina based on the analysis of
SSU and LSU rDNA + RPB2 data (Fig. 2). The rDNA
sequences for the four S. kochii strains were identical
(each encoded a single group I intron at position L1921).
The rDNA coding regions of S. buchneri JCM9740 were
interrupted by 5 introns in the SSU rDNA coding region
(S114, S287, S1052, S1210, S1506) and by 4 introns in
the LSU rDNA (L1094, L1921, L2066, L2449). In the host
tree, S. buchneri and S. kochii form a clade with Bayesian
but not bootstrap support, providing weak evidence for
their monophyly (see grey box in Fig. 2). This result was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/68

previously found in a more limited analysis of partial
small subunit rDNA sequences [24]. In our tree, the Symbiotaphrina species diverge before the split of most of the
major lineages of lichen fungi (i.e., Lecanoromycetes +
Eurotiomycetes), but again without bootstrap support. If
the early divergence of Symbiotaphrina is correct, then the
fungal host tree suggests that under a model of vertical
inheritance, in intron trees, the nine S. buchneri group I
introns should each form independent monophyletic
groups containing other fungal introns at the respective
insertion sites. The S. buchneri sequences should not cluster on the basis of their common occurrence in this species
and ideally, they should branch after the Sordariomycetes
but before the Lecanoromycetes + Eurotiomycetes group
(see Fig. 2).
Given these expectations, we first analyzed the 189sequence intron data set that was used as input for the JCNJ and Bayesian inference of phylogeny (results not
shown). This tree was consistent with a model of vertical
inheritance with the fungal introns assorted primarily on
the basis of their sites of rDNA insertion and not intermixed, which would result if they had been frequently laterally transferred to ectopic sites ([3,10,12,22,25] for
exceptions, see below). A JC-NJ analysis using a subset of
116 sequences provided the same results (Fig. 3) but with
higher bootstrap support due to the reduced number of
taxa in the data set. In particular, the nine S. buchneri
group I introns (green filled triangles in Fig. 3) are distributed in the tree on the basis of their site of rDNA genic
insertion, often in clades with bootstrap and/or Bayesian
support. The same holds for the P. perisidiosa group I
introns (yellow filled circles) in Fig. 3. These results argue
for a separate evolutionary history for the different introns
although within each intron lineage there could be a combination of vertical inheritance and lateral transfer
between fungi [e.g., [10]]. This would result if some of the
introns were targeted (i.e., fixed) at the homologous
rDNA site in other species resulting in their monophyly;
i.e., supporting intron vertical inheritance even though
the ribozymes had moved between species. This phenomenon is best addressed with targeted analyses of specific
intron lineages and the fungi that contain these introns
[e.g., [23,25]].
In general the introns in S. buchneri are either limited to
the Lecanoromycetes (S114, S1052, S1210) or are more
closely related to homologs in this group than in the Sordariomycetes, as would be expected under a model of vertical inheritance (e.g., L1921, L2449). The single L1921
group I intron in S. kochii appears however to have an origin through lateral transfer from a sordariomycetes source
(albeit without bootstrap support, Fig. 3). We tested the
hypothesis of independent origins of the S. buchneri group
I introns by forcing the monophyly of these sequences

Page 4 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:68

from different sites in the tree inferred from the 51sequence data set (see Fig. 4). The Shimodaira-Hasegawa
statistical test significantly rejected trees, for example, in
which the S. buchneri S1210 and S114 (S1210 branch
moved to S114, or S114 branch moved to S1210, P <
0.01), the S287 and L2449 (S287 to L2449, or L2449 to
S287, P < 0.001), or the S114 and S1506 (S114 to S1506,
or S1506 to S114, P < 0.001) introns were united in one
clade. Forcing the monophyly of any of the S. buchneri IC
and IE introns resulted in the greatest differences in log
likelihood arguing for a long evolutionary separation of
these intron subgroups. The only tree rearrangement that
did not result in significant SH-test scores was for the
union of the S. buchneri S1052 and S1506 group I introns
(S1052 to S1506, P = 0.153; S1506 to S1052, P = 0.195).
This suggests a potential common evolutionary origin of
these introns.
In summary, our data are consistent with the idea that the
S. buchneri group I introns have independent origins and
that they been vertically inherited in many fungi. Our data
argue most strongly for the view that the S. buchneri
introns have not recently spread in rDNA through ectopic
transposition within this taxon. Consistent with these
ideas, detailed analysis of the Sordariomycetes support
the hypothesis of long-term group I intron vertical evolution [25]. We cannot, however, unambiguously ascertain
the extent of intron lateral transfer between all Pezizomycotina because of the uneven and sporadic distribution of
the data (i.e., the Sordariomycetes and Lecanoromycetes
contain the majority of fungal group I introns. If the S.
buchneri introns are ancient as we postulate, then group I
intron loss was widespread in fungal rDNA evolution
because these sequences are not present in many fungi
(e.g., completely absent, to date, in the Dothideomycetidae and rare in the Eurotiomycetidae [Reeb et al. unpublished data]). Within the Lecanoromycetidae, detailed
analysis of this group using SSU rDNA comparisons
shows that entire derived lineages (e.g., Bacidiaceae, Peltigeraceae, Rhizocarpaceae) are intron-free even though
their sisters often contain multiple different group I
introns (e.g., Acarosporaceae [Reeb et al., unpublished
data], Cladoniaceae, Physciaceae [12,23]).
Evidence for group I intron spread
Although group I introns form monophyletic groups in
Figure 3, there are also cases of a close relationship (bootstrap and/or Bayesian support) between intron clades at
ectopic rDNA sites. Inspection of Figures 3 and 4 suggests
seven potential transposition events (marked with filled
boxes). These same cases were also present in the 189sequence data set (results not shown). The intron movements involve four cases that were previously found in
more limited phylogenetic analyses of clades S114 –
S303, S1046 – S1052, S287 – S1199 (without bootstrap

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/68

or Bayesian support in Fig. 3, but see Fig. 4A), S1506 –
S1516 [12] and three putative new cases found in this
study (S497 – S1210, S934 – L1025, S296 – L2449 [again,
see Fig. 4A]). Perhaps most interesting in this analysis is
the finding that five of the nine S. buchneri SSU rDNA
introns (S114, S287, S1052, S1210, S1506) are nested
inside, or sister to introns at heterologous sites in the Lecanoromycetidae (see Figs. 3 and 4). This suggests that the
five potentially ancestral SSU rDNA introns that were
present in S. buchneri may have spread into 5 novel sites
(i.e., S303, S1199, S1046, S497, S1516, respectively) during fungal evolution resulting in 10 different intron lineages. The timing of these intron movements suggests that
most have occurred in derived members of the Lecanoromyectidae, in particular the lichenized Physicaceae [12].
The S1052 to S1046 movement, for example, must have
been relatively recent because, despite extensive sampling
[12,23], the novel S1046 intron is known only from the
closely related taxa, Gymnoderma coccocarpum, Physcia
stellaris, Lecanora dispersa, and Cladonia spp. (Lecanorales). The S114 to S303 movement is also likely to be
recent because the derived S303 intron is limited to two
members of the Physciaceae (Buellia georgei and Rinodina cacuminum). Other intron movements that are independent of S. buchneri include the S934 – L1025 and
S296 – L2449 (see Figs. 3 and 4A,4B) sites. These groupings are only weakly supported in Fig. 3. All of the phylogenetic analyses with the 51-sequence data set suggest
however that the Acarospora cf. dissipata S934 group I
intron shares a specific evolutionary relationship with the
intron at the L1025 site in a member of the Lecanoromycetidae (Porpidia albocaerulescens) and the Ostropomycetidae (Coccotrema pocillarium [Fig. 4A]). The majorityrule Bayesian consensus tree inferred from the intron core
regions is consistent with these results showing that the
intron transpositions are supported even when a restricted
number of sites from the most highly conserved regions of
the ribozymes are used in the analysis (Fig. 4B). This result
argues against the spurious clustering of introns in Figures
3 and 4A resulting solely from long-branch attraction of
divergent sequences.
Taken together, our phylogenetic analyses provide evidence not only for the ancient origin of many fungal
introns that can be traced back to their presence in S. buchneri, but also provide indirect evidence for the spread of
some of these introns into novel sites, thereby giving rise
to additional vertically inherited sequences. Given this
hypothesis, we predict that some taxa may maintain
introns at both the ancestral and novel sites. This prediction is met for the S114 – S303 (Rinodina capensis), S287
– S1199 (Physconia perisidiosa, R. cacuminum), and S1506
– S1516 introns (e.g., P. perisidiosa). The low number of
taxa containing both ancestral and derived introns suggests again that intron loss is widespread in fungal rDNA

Phylogeny of group I introns
Phylogeny of group I introns. Phylogeny of fungal group I introns implicated in reverse splicing movement. This is a JC-NJ
tree that was inferred for 116 fungal introns. The results of a JC-NJ bootstrap analysis are shown above the branches, whereas
the results of an unweighted maximum parsimony bootstrap analysis are shown below the branches. The thick branches represent ≥95% Bayesian posterior probability. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see legend).
The Symbiotaphrina spp. group I introns are marked with the filled triangles and the P. perisidiosa introns are marked with the
filled circles. The intron insertion sites in small (S) and large (L) subunit rDNA are shown. The filled squares at the nodes
denote the putative cases of intron movement. The colors for the different introns reflect the taxonomic position of the host
cell containing the ribozymes (consistent with the scheme shown in Fig 2).

because in most cases one or both of the ribozymes have
been lost from the genes. We cannot yet identify, however,
the source of many introns that are putatively of a putative
recent origin but are unrelated to the introns in Symbiotaphrina (e.g., S1389, L800, L1090). Clearly, external
sources such as viruses or bacteria may also play an important role in the introduction of group I introns in fungal
rDNA.
Reverse splicing group I intron spread
We suggest that reverse splicing may be an important
mechanism of group I intron spread into distant rDNA
sites in fungal nuclear rDNA for the following reasons: 1)
Virtually none of the Pezizomycotina rDNA group I
introns (including all of those implicated here in movement) contain endonucleases [10,26,27]. If endonucleases (encoded within the intron sequences) did mediate
the lateral transfer of rDNA introns, then one would have
to postulate complete loss of these coding regions after
the introns had attained their present distribution. When
endonucleases have been found in nuclear group I introns
[see [10]], they appear to have been inserted into existing
intron sequences and generally do not contain extensive
deletions but rather frame-shift mutations or short truncations that result in their inactivation [e.g., [26,28], Reeb et
al. unpublished data]. No large insertions (i.e., >200 nt)
have been found in these introns that could be the remnant of an inactivated endonuclease open reading frame.
2) Generally, intron homing requires extensive exon
flanking sequence identity (15 – 20 nt [2,7,8]) that is not
found among the different rDNA group I intron movements (Fig. 4C). 3) In the cases of intron transposition
shown here, all of the heterologous rDNA sites show high
conservation of only 4 – 8 nt of the 5' exon flanking
sequence (all exon sequences are from S. buchneri rDNA).
This region is involved in the internal guide sequence
interaction that is required for both forward- and reverse
splicing (Fig. 1). In our analyses, the S287 – S1199 and
S1046 – S1052 introns share the 5' flanking exon
sequences 5'UAACRGGU3' and 5'UGKKGGU3', respectively
(Fig. 4C). A close evolutionary relationship between the
S497 – S1210 introns is also supported by this analysis
(5'CCCU3'). This pattern of sequence conservation is predicted for reverse splicing-mediated intron spread [13,15].
A recent analysis of the S956 twin-ribozyme in the myxomycete Didymium iridis demonstrates that it can accurately reverse-splice into the homologous site in both E.
coli and yeast rRNA [29]. Surprisingly, this intron does
not integrate into related heterologous rRNA sites as has
been reported for the T. thermophila ribozyme, which
was shown to partially reverse-splice into 69 sites and
completely integrate into one site in E. coli large subunit
rRNA [16]. The S934 – L1025 intron group also displays a
conserved motif at the site of insertion (5'CACCAC3') but
one of these introns appears to have "slid" along the exon

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/68

by one nucleotide either at the time of reverse splicing or
sometime thereafter.

Conclusion
Given the results of our exhaustive study, we propose that
reverse splicing is potentially an important mechanism of
intron spread in Pezizomycotina nuclear rDNA. Our analyses provide strong support for the idea that the evolutionary history of nuclear group I introns may
differentiate itself markedly from organellar group I
introns which appear to rely primarily on homing for
spread and may be characterized by massive and independent invasions into the homologous DNA sites of
related taxa [e.g., [10,30]]. In contrast, the nuclear introns
often have protracted histories in the host genomes [e.g.,
[12,23,25,31]] and their spread into novel sites may be a
direct consequence of this long-term stability; i.e., existing
introns reverse-splice at different times into heterologous
sites. The availability of reverse transcriptase in the cell
and the fixation rate of intron-containing alleles in the
multi-copy rDNA gene family are likely the primary determinants of the rate of reverse splicing-mediated movement. Limited analyses of intron+ and intron- strains fail
to show any clear advantage or disadvantage to the host
cell when introns are present [32,33]. This suggests that
mobile group I introns may be "silent" parasites that have
no measurable phenotype [34,35]. The neutral nature of
group I introns suggests that their spread and loss may be
stochastic events with rare movement occurring through
reverse splicing and the more frequent intron loss occurring most likely through chance or when intron mobility,
splicing, and/or processing (e.g., degradation) poses a cost
to the host cell [7]. Successful group I intron excision is of
critical importance because these sequences are normally
found in functionally important regions of rDNA [36,37].
Our study suggests that the beetle gut symbiont S. buchneri
[see [38]] contains a set of introns that has likely been vertically inherited in later-diverging fungi with reverse-splicing spread of some of these ribozymes into ectopic rDNA
sites, particularly in the intron-rich Lecanoromycetes. Our
data do not support the idea that S. buchneri is a vector for
facilitating intron spread in the fungi. We did not find an
unexpectedly close phylogenetic relationship between any
of the introns in this taxon with others in our data set,
which would have indicated a recent later transfer event.
The phylogenetic positions of the S. buchneri introns relative to other ribozymes (when bootstrap and/or Bayesian
support is found) are generally consistent with the expectations of host relationships. However, these group I
intron data do not have enough resolving power to allow
us to address the possibility of more ancient transfer
events involving S. buchneri. In conclusion, it is apparent
from our work that nuclear group I introns in the fungi
have remarkably complex evolutionary histories, there-

fore our analyses are likely only scratching the surface of
intron movement in these taxa. More detailed studies of
specific intron lineages [e.g., [11,23,25]] will more accurately reveal the dynamics of fungal rDNA group I intron
evolution.

Methods
Fungal cultures, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification
Five cultures of Symbiotaphrina spp. were acquired for
this study: S. buchneri (JCM9740) and S. kochii
(JCM9739, CBS250.77, CBS588.63, CBS589.63). DNA
was isolated from these cultures using the Puregene Kit
(Gentra Systems) following the manufacturer's protocol
for filamentous fungi. The nuclear small (SSU) and large
subunit (LSU) rDNA were amplified for each strain by
PCR. In addition we amplified the RPB2 (second-largest
subunit of RNA polymerase II) nuclear gene from S. buchneri JCM9740 and S. kochii CBS589.63. PCR products
were purified from agarose gels using GELase (Epicenter)
and directly sequenced on both strands using an ABI
PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and Big
Dye (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems). The PCR primers used in this study came from various sources [39-47]
or were designed specifically for Symbiotaphrina spp. The
rDNA and RPB2 sequences for Symbiotaphrina spp. are
available from GenBank under the following accession
numbers respectively: S. buchneri JCM9740 (rDNA =
DQ248313; RPB2 = DQ248315), S. kochii CBS589.63
(rDNA = DQ248314; RPB2 = DQ248316).
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses
Fungal host phylogeny
To provide a framework for understanding group I intron
evolution in the fungi, we reconstructed a phylogeny of
the Pezizomycotina that included Symbiotaphrina spp.
This tree was inferred from a combined DNA data set of
nuclear SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA, and RPB2 DNA (2100 nt)
from 84 ascomycetes with one basidiomycete as the outgroup. These data are available from GenBank. The combined data set was analyzed using a GTR + Γ + I model of
evolution for each of the five data partitions (SSU, LSU,
RPB2-1st, -2nd, -3rd codon positions). Bayesian analysis
(MrBayes V3.0b4 [48]) was initiated using a random tree
from the combined dataset with four chains running
simultaneously for 5,000,000 generations, and trees sampled every 100 generations. The first 10,000 trees were discarded (burnin) and a majority rule consensus tree was
generated from the remaining 40,000 (post burnin) trees.
A neighbor-joining analysis was also used to calculate
bootstrap support values for nodes in the Bayesian consensus tree. The supra-generic taxon names used in this
tree follow [49].

rDNA group I intron phylogeny
The ten group I introns found in Symbiotaphrina spp.
were aligned with 179 fungal group I introns at 28 different rDNA sites. The non-Symbiotaphrina introns are published [e.g., [12]] and available either from GenBank or
from the Comparative RNA Web Site [50]. The introns
from the 28 rDNA sites represent well the diversity of fungal rDNA group I introns although we excluded a small
number of introns from other sites that were either difficult to align or to unambiguously identify their rDNA
genic position (e.g., S940, S1049, S1201). The 189 group
I introns were aligned through juxtaposition of the secondary structural elements P1–P9 found in nuclear group
I introns [31,51,52]. For this procedure we used, wherever
possible, existing secondary structures from representatives of different intron insertion sites [e.g., [10,11,53-55]]
to guide the alignment. We did not attempt to include all
available fungal group I introns (there are nearly 1200
group I introns in this group [see [50]]) but sampled
(given the taxonomic distribution) evenly the different
lineages. Our approach was designed to provide an overall
view of fungal group I intron phylogeny and is not
expected to detect lateral transfers within intron lineages
that would be apparent in detailed analyses of introns at
particular rDNA sites and the host phylogeny [e.g.,
[10,11,20,23,25,55]]. Given the large number of introns
and rDNA genic sites to consider, we divided the phylogenetic analyses into increasingly more focused data sets.
The initial data set of 189 introns was used to gain broad
insights into group I intron phylogeny and in particular,
the distribution of the S. buchneri introns within the tree.
This tree provided evidence for the vertical evolution and
movement of introns. Thereafter, we reduced the data set
to a representative group of 116 introns to increase the
phylogenetic resolution. Finally, we included the putative
reverse splicing candidates in data sets of 51 and 34
sequences. The sequences were pruned approximately
uniformly from the trees to retain the diversity of introns
at the different rDNA sites. This approach was necessary to
gain meaningful insights into group I intron evolution
because phylogenetic methods often perform poorly
under the situations used here; i.e., the interrelationships
of many divergent lineages need to be resolved with a relatively small data set.

A total of 136 aligned positions were selected for the initial phylogenetic analyses (alignment available from DB
upon request). For these data, we used two different
approaches to infer the phylogeny. First, we used the single parameter Jukes-Cantor (JC) evolutionary model [56]
with neighbor-joining (NJ) tree reconstruction to estimate
a tree. This "simple" model is potentially useful for large
data sets with short (in this case, highly divergent)
sequences when multiple parameter estimates are
expected to have high associated variances [e.g., [57,58]].

Testing putative cases of group I intron reverse splicing
Testing putative cases of group I intron reverse splicing. Phylogeny of fungal introns and analysis of rDNA flanking
exons to assess putative cases of group I intron reverse splicing. A) Distance matrix phylogenetic tree of a reduced data set of
51 fungal introns. The results of a distance bootstrap analysis are shown above the branches on the left of the slash marks,
whereas the results of a maximum likelihood bootstrap analysis are shown on the right of the slash marks. The values shown
below the branches result from an unweighted maximum parsimony bootstrap analysis. The thick branches represent ≥95%
Bayesian posterior probability. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see legend). The S.
buchneri group I introns are marked with filled triangles and the P. perisidiosa introns are marked with the filled circles. The
putative cases of intron movement are denoted with the filled squares on the internal nodes. The rDNA intron insertion site is
shown for each ribozyme. B) Majority-rule consensus tree inferred from a Bayesian analysis of 34 fungal group I introns. Only
the core regions of the ribozymes were used in this analysis. The colors for the different introns in panels A and B reflect the
taxonomic position of the host cell containing the ribozymes (consistent with the scheme shown in Fig 2). C) Alignment of
exon sequences (all from S. buchneri) at heterologous group I intron sites. Regions required for the IGS interaction that are
implicated in reverse splicing intron movement are shown in the boxed areas.

Under such conditions, the maximum likelihood method
may give an incorrect topology [59]. Branch lengths will,
however, be underestimated under the JC model. The JCNJ tree was inferred using PAUP* (V4.0b10 [60]) and
bootstrap analyses (2000 replications) were done to
assess the support for monophyletic groups in the JC-NJ
tree. In the second approach, we used the parameter-rich
GTR + Γ model ([61] i.e., estimated proportion of invariant sites = 0.0147) in a Bayesian inference as described

above to calculate posterior probabilities for nodes in the
intron tree. In this analysis, a random starting tree was initiated and run for 3,000,000 generations with trees sampled every 1000th generation. To increase the probability
of chain convergence, the first 2,000 trees were discarded
as burnin and the remaining 1,000 were used to calculate
the posterior probabilities.

Based on the analysis of the 189-sequence data set, we
generated a second reduced intron data set of 116
sequences that maintained the diversity of intron sites in
the large data set. A JC-NJ tree was inferred from these data
(with bootstrap support values) and Bayesian posterior
probabilities were calculated for the tree as described
above. In addition, we did an unweighted maximum parsimony (MP) bootstrap analysis of the data. For this
method, a heuristic search was used with each of the 2000
bootstrap pseudosamples and starting trees were obtained
using random additions (10 rounds) with tree bisectionreconnection branch swapping. The 51-sequence data set
(138 nt in this alignment) was analyzed with the JC-NJ,
MP, and Bayesian methods as described above. In addition, we did a maximum likelihood bootstrap analysis of
these data. In this approach, the gamma value (with 4 rate
categories) and the transition/transversion ratio were estimated using PAUP*. Bootstrap analyses (100 replicates)
were then done using DNAML (PHYLIP V3.6b [62]) with
1 random taxon addition and global rearrangements. We
also generated a second reduced alignment of 34 introns
that included only the catalytic core (66 nt) of the fungal
group I introns [11]. Analysis of the core region alignment
allowed us to assess whether the most highly conserved
region of these ribozymes resulted in essentially the same
tree as when the more variable regions were included. For
the core alignment, we used Bayesian inference (as
described above) to infer a 50% majority-rule consensus
phylogeny from the final 1000 trees in the posterior distribution. In all of these intron phylogenies, the evolutionarily distantly related group IE introns [5,37] were
used to root the subtree of IC introns [10]. Finally, we
used the maximum likelihood-based Shimodaira-Hasegawa statistical test [63] to assess likelihood support alternative intron topologies.
