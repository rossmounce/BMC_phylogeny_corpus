Abstract
Background: The importance of in silico predictions for understanding cellular processes is now widely accepted, and
a variety of algorithms useful for studying different biological features have been designed. In particular, the prediction
of cis regulatory modules in non-coding human genome regions represents a major challenge for understanding gene
regulation in several diseases. Recently, studies of the Wnt signaling pathway revealed a connection with
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. In this article, we construct a classification tool that uses the
transcription factor binding site motifs composition of some gene promoters to identify new Wnt/β-catenin pathway
target genes potentially involved in brain diseases.
Results: In this study, we propose 89 new Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes predicted in silico by using a method
based on multiple Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. We used as decision variables the presence of
transcription factor binding site motifs in the upstream region of each gene. This prediction was validated by RT-qPCR
in a sample of 9 genes. As expected, LEF1, a member of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor family
(TCF/LEF1), was relevant for the classification algorithm and, remarkably, other factors related directly or indirectly to
the inflammatory response and amyloidogenic processes also appeared to be relevant for the classification. Among
the 89 new Wnt/β-catenin pathway targets, we found a group expressed in brain tissue that could be involved in
diverse responses to neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease (AD). These genes represent new candidates
to protect cells against amyloid β toxicity, in agreement with the proposed neuroprotective role of the Wnt signaling
pathway.
Conclusions: Our multiple CART strategy proved to be an effective tool to identify new Wnt/β-catenin pathway targets
based on the study of their regulatory regions in the human genome. In particular, several of these genes represent a
new group of transcriptional dependent targets of the canonical Wnt pathway. The functions of these genes indicate
that they are involved in pathophysiology related to Alzheimer's disease or other brain disorders.
Background
Gene expression is the mechanism through cells organize
which genes can be up-regulated or repressed in response
to both, changes in their environment [1] or internal programs [2]. Primary control of gene expression occurs
through transcriptional regulation of mRNA levels,
where one or several transcription factor (TF) proteins

recognize and bind specific motifs in the DNA, calling TF
binding sites to modulate the activity of the basal transcriptional machinery [3]. In eukaryotes, the combination
of TF binding sites clustered together near the transcription start sites in the promoter of genes are known as cis
regulatory modules (CRMs), and changes in the combination of TFs bound to their respective binding sites contribute to up or down-regulate gene expression levels [4].
The computational identification of functional TF binding sites or CRMs is challenging. In general, methods that
scan genome sequences to identify matches with a con-

sensus binding site or a position weight matrix [5] produce high false positive rates owing to the low specificity
of most of the profiles and the vast stretches of genomic
sequences that have to be scanned. At the same time,
prior knowledge has to be provided by the users to produce an unbiased genome survey of CRMs. New bioinformatics tools have been developed to avoid these
problems in genome-wide predictions of mammalian cis
regulatory regions. A novel method that involves binding
affinity for TFs has been used to predict enhancers at the
genomic scale [6]. Another strategy for cis regulatory
modules prediction has been used in the analysis of
human and mouse genomes based on finding phylogenetically conserved binding sites for different TFs [7,8]. The
increasing amount of information available from
microarray experiments [9,10] and TF binding sites
[11,12] requires the development of new tools to improve
our understanding of gene expression and transcriptional
regulation. Based on the principle that co-expressed patterns emerge as the result of the combined action of TFs,
several in silico methods have been used to elucidate the
relationship between conserved motifs upstream of genes
that are believed to be co-regulated [13,14]. These studies
revealed that transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes
works under a cooperative principle involving the binding sites for one or more TFs that are closely spaced in
regulatory regions [15,16] and for which the composition
is non-randomly distributed in various gene promoters
[17]. The information arising from this kind of data
allows to better understand how gene expression changes
in response to environmental or internal programs,
thereby connecting TF binding sites information with signaling pathways such as the Wnt pathway involved in
many cellular processes.
The Wnt pathway is implicated in numerous aspects of
development [18], cell differentiation [19-21], and several
diseases [22,23]; notably, it was recently discovered a relation with cancer and neurodegenerative diseases like AD
[24-26]. In the well-known Wnt pathway -- the highly
conserved canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
[27] -- the secreted glycoprotein Wnt interacts with Frizzled, a seven-transmembrane receptor that transduces its
signal through the activation of Dishevelled, which in
turn inactivates GSK-3β kinase that resides in a protein
complex assembled by the scaffolding protein Axin and
adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) product, a tumor
suppressor. As a consequence of the GSK-3β inactivation,
hypophosphorylated levels of cytosolic β-catenin
increase, allowing it to bind to components of the high
mobility group family of transcription factors T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF), and this complex is then translocated to the nucleus where it activates
gene expression [28]. In the absence of the Wnt ligand,
Axin is stabilized and the interaction between APC and

Page 2 of 15

β-catenin is facilitated. In this complex, β-catenin is
phosphorylated by GSK-3β and destined for ubiquitinproteasome-mediated degradation; as a result, the
expression of Wnt signaling pathway target genes is
repressed [29].
Several methods have been used to find new Wnt signaling pathway target genes based on the interaction
between β-catenin and the evolutionarily conserved
TCF/LEF, the most well known family of DNA binding
factors involved in gene regulation through Wnt signaling: (1) reporter constructs based on TCF/LEF binding
sites [30], (2) serial analysis of chromatin occupancy
(SACO) [31] and (3) combined microarrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) [32]. All of these methods have disadvantages: reporter constructs shows
discrepancies and may not reveal the complexity of gene
regulation [33], and whole-genome SACO and ChIP
strongly depend on high quality antibodies and represent
just a particular point in the interaction between TFs and
regulatory regions. In particular, these methods have
been used with colon cancer cell lines, a more complex
background to study TCF/LEF-dependent gene regulation, and predicted motifs for NF1, HNF4 or AP-1,
among others, were discovered flanking TCF4 binding
sites [32]. The method described by Hallikas et al. [6] was
also used to identify targets for TCF4, a well-characterized member of the TCF/LEF family of TFs [34] downstream of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and suggested that
Hedgehog signaling is involved in the Wnt pathway via
GLI transcription factor motifs found close to the TCF4
binding sites.
Following the hypothesis that transcription factors
work cooperatively to define gene expression, in this
work we propose a multiple Classification and Regression
Tree (CART) approach to identify new Wnt/β-catenin
pathway target genes within the human genome, based
on the presence of transcription factor binding site motifs
in their regulatory regions. The CART method has
already been used to classify acetylated or methylated
promoters based on the binding site composition of a set
of differentially expressed genes [35] or to identify relationships between gene expression levels and regulatory
motifs in microarray experiments [36]. More directly,
classification trees have been used to identify structural
relationships between transcription factor binding sites
and gene expression levels in order to discover regulatory
motifs [36]. A similar approach was used to identify cis
regulatory modules in differentially expressed genes of D.
melanogaster germline [37].
In this work we used the predicted TF binding site
motifs for a group of 15,476 genes in the human genome
where 66 of them were known to be regulated by the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway [38] to build a decision rule classifying genes as Wnt/β-catenin pathway target candidates

based on the occurrences of these TF binding site motifs
in their upstream regions.

Generation of candidate genes to be Wnt/β-catenin
pathway targets

We trained independently a series of 1,500 CART trees
using the information of the presence of transcription
factor binding site motifs in the upstream region of
15,476 genes of the human genome where 66 of them are
known to be Wnt/β-catenin pathway targets. We evaluated the 15,476 genes in the 1,500 CART trees and we
ranked them using a "score" calculated as the number of
times each one was classified as a Wnt/β-catenin pathway
target among the 1,500 trees (Figure 1 and Additional File
1). Finally, a "threshold" value for the scores was proposed

defining a "decision rule" to classify whether a gene is a
Wnt/β-catenin pathway target. To define the score
threshold we considered the highest percentile. Besides
the 66 known target genes, this threshold produced 89
new candidates (Additional File 1). All previously known
Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes were correctly classified.
Interpretation of the relevant transcription factors in the
CART method

To provide a biological interpretation of the results generated by the method we studied the importance of variables in the classification, i.e. the usage of TF binding site
motifs in the upstream region of the gene, and therefore
the associated TFs. We used a primary index, giving more
importance to variables appearing near the root in most
of the 1,500 CART trees and a secondary index that just
take the score or number of times that variables are used
in the 1,500 trees. In Additional File 2 we provide a complete list of TF binding site motifs with the corresponding
indexes and in Table 1 we provide the TFs associated to
some of the variables considered to be the most relevant
according to both indexes and a biological criterion.
Finally both criteria revealed essentially similar results.
As expected, within the most relevant TFs used in the
decision tree we found LEF1 and TCF-1. The complex
formed between these regulator and β-catenin in
upstream regions is necessary to regulate gene expression
of canonical Wnt signaling pathway targets. Also, PAX3
transcription factor has been detected in vitro as part of a
complex formed by LEF1 and repressor Grg4 in melanocyte stem cells [39]. The proposed model indicates a
turnover between PAX3 and β-catenin for activation of
dopachrome tautomerase gene (Dct) and the activation of
a melanogenic cascade that leads to terminal differentiation of hair follicles. The presence of HNF4α transcriptional regulator as relevant for the predictor is also
interesting. The study conducted by Hatzis et al. [32]
revealed that binding sites motifs for this TF are present
surrounding the specifically enriched TCF4-binding
region identified by ChIP. In particular, Benahmed et al.
[40] reported the cooperation between HNF4α, β-catenin
and TCF-4 to regulate the expression pattern of the
homeobox Cdx2 in mouse gut development. Recently it
has been suggested that HNF4α could mediate gene
expression of several drug transporter proteins in human
and rat choroid-plexus [41]. Also recently, it has been
demonstrated that transcriptional regulator GR (or
NR3C1) is involved in down-regulation of cyclin D1 by
targeting the TCF/β-catenin complex [42]; furthermore,
it has been reported GR and β-catenin as part of the same
immunocomplex in regulatory regions for cyclin D1 in
human osteoblastic cells [43]. Regulatory sites for MAZ
(also known as SAF-1) have been reported upstream of

[44]. Interestingly, the MT1-MMP gene is up-regulated in
colon carcinomas mediated by a direct interaction of βcatenin/TCF4 complex and their 5' flanking region, indicating that it is a direct target of Wnt pathway.
In summary, besides the presence of LEF1/TCF1 complex, some of the most relevant transcriptional regulators
used by the predictor have been previously described to
be associated to the regulatory regions of genes that also
respond to Wnt canonical pathway, suggesting that
changes in gene expression of the new Wnt/β-catenin
pathway target genes can involve other factors acting on
promoter regions of these genes.
Gene Ontology analysis of new Wnt/β-catenin pathway
target genes

Classical targets of the Wnt signaling pathway have been
related to different biological processes ranging from
development to diseases [28], and these targets mediate
Wnt function in diverse cell types and tissues. In order to
know in which processes our predicted targets are
involved, we used Ontologizer software [45] to assign
Gene Ontology (GO) terms to the 66 known and the 89
proposed Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes, and also
some other highly ranked genes in the boundary of the
threshold score. We used GO-Slim annotation [46], a
subset of GO terms, to avoid the large number of GO
terms and get a general comparison of the annotations.
This annotation was also used to obtain a general view of
which ontology terms were represented in both sets of
data [47]. The number of genes in each category was calculated considering the parent-child union relationship
to avoid over representation of terms in each dataset,
caused by the direct acyclic graph nature of GO terms.
We found that the candidates to be Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes present a similar distribution under the
three ontology categories (Additional File 3, Figure S1).
Only one biological process categories (membrane
fusion) was not present in the proposed Wnt/β-catenin
pathway target genes (Additional File 3, Figure S1-A). On

the other hand, under the molecular function ontology
six categories (translational regulator, lyase, ligase,
isomerase, helicase and electron transport activities)
were present only in the proposed Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes (Additional File 3, Figure S1-B). The
complete list of terms using full GO annotation can be
found in the supplementary material files (Additional File
4). For biological process ontology, we detected an
enrichment of some categories in the training set (adj. pvalue < 0.1) compared against the terms for the complete
human genome dataset used in CART procedure (Figure
2). None of them was significantly enriched in the new
candidates group, even when in some cases the number
of terms was similar like in each case. To explore in which
tissue or cell type our new proposed target genes are
expressed, we used gene expression data from two different human microarray platforms, GNF1H and U95
Affymetrix chips information obtained from BioGPS
(former SymAtlas) [48]. When data was clustered (Pearson coefficient distance and average linkage) to produce
similar profiles, we found a group of genes in the same
cluster (Additional file 5). This group represents the gene
expression data from 18 cerebral tissues in one platform
(GNF1H, using two normalizations approaches: MAS5
and gnRMA) and 10 cerebral tissues in the other one
(U95A). Because the Wnt signaling pathway is present in
several biological processes, these expression profiles led
us to consider in which processes our Wnt/β-catenin
pathway target genes could be represented.
To obtain more information regarding the bests ranked
genes represented in these clusters, we selected a subgroup of genes activated in the two databases (Table 2).
One of the new proposed targets, tropomyosin alpha, is
involved in the contractile system of striated and smooth
muscles and in non-muscle cells, and tropomyosin forms
an integral part of the cytoskeleton and is involved in the
regulation of cellular contraction [49]. In particular, tropomyosin is associated with neurofibrillary pathology of
AD [49]. Within this cluster, we identified other interesting genes that could be involved in neuroprotection

against Aβ toxicity. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CamK4) gene is up-regulated in response
to both Wnt ligands and lithium [50] to promote neuronal survival. Another candidate we identified was synapsin 2 (SynII). Synapsin is an abundant synaptic vesicle
protein that belongs to a family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins that are highly concentrated in pre-synaptic
nerve terminals. Synapsin is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles, playing a key role in neurotransmitter release and in the formation and
maintenance of synaptic contacts among central neurons

[51]. Synapsin II co-precipitates with fibrillar Aβ, and
there is a regional loss of synapsin I in the hippocampus
of patients with late-stage AD [52,53], suggesting that the
regional decrease in synapsin is associated with cytoskeletal changes as well as with Aβ deposits [54]. Interestingly, Ryk (receptor related to tyrosine kinase) gene was
also found as a putative Wnt target gene. Ryk functions as
a co-receptor with Frizzled for Wnt ligands through the
activation of a β-catenin-independent signaling pathway
[55-58]. In fact, Ryk is able to bind to Dishevelled, thereby
activating the canonical Wnt pathway. Ryk function is

related to axon guidance and neurite outgrowth, making
it an interesting target for Wnt activation [59,60].
Among the new target genes, we also found a member
of the phosphatidylinositol phosphatases, synaptojanin 2
(Synj2). A spliced form of the mRNA from this gene partially overlaps the function of synaptojanin 1 (Synj1) in
nerve terminals, with additional roles in neurons and
other cells [61]. From the AD perspective, haploinsufficiency of Synj1 exerts its protective effect on oligomers
Aβ-mediated down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol
(4,5) diphosphate phosphatase 2 and impairment of synaptic function [62]. In fact, other genes involved in inositol metabolism, phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate 5phosphatase A (PIB5PA), or in phosphatidylinositol signaling, as inositol 1,3,4-triphosphate 5/6 kinase (ITPK1)
and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3γ
(PIK3R3), were identified by our method, which is consistent with the potential connection between AD and phosphoinositides [63].
Another interesting Wnt-regulated gene candidate is
the inhibitory subunit for protein phosphatase 1
(PPP1R1B), a dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein also known as DARPP-32 [64]. Through its inhibition of protein phosphatase 1, DARPP-32 controls the
state of phosphorylation and the activities of several key
proteins, including ion channels, ion pumps, neurotransmitter receptors, and transcription factors; thus, DARPP32 controls the physiological characteristics of neurons
containing dopamine receptors [65]. Interestingly, inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 strongly stimulates soluble
amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) secretion and inhibits
Aβ formation [66]; therefore, Wnt-dependent up-regulation of DARPP-32 provides a potential route for the prevention of AD.
Another new target is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R. Products of these families of genes play

important roles in regulating neural-specific pre-mRNA
splicing, thereby contributing to the regulation of neural
function and development [67]. Therefore, their neuronspecific regulation and function reveals new insights into
physiological and pathological events. Ectodermal-neural
cortex 1 (ENC-1), which is a component of the TCF/βcatenin complex, is another new target that is up-regulated in colorectal carcinomas [68]. Interestingly, ENC-1
is a nuclear matrix protein abundantly expressed in the
brain and appears to be localized in primary neurons and
is up-regulated in brain tumors, suggesting that it might
be involved in brain tumorigenesis [69]. These results
suggest that the Wnt pathway can transcriptionally modulate a neuroprotective response against Aβ peptide, promoting neuronal survival and rescuing changes in
activation or sub-cellular localization of Wnt components
[21].
Biological validation

To test whether new targets of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway predicted by our method change their expression
depending of pathway activation we used RT-qPCR [70].
We measured changes in mRNA levels between HEK-293
that over-express and secrete Wnt ligands and HEK-293
wild-type cells. Table 3 shows expression fold-change for
seven genes assigned to class 1 by the method and covering a wide range of scores, and 4 genes not selected as
Wnt/β-catenin pathway targets by the method. Two of
them appear in the first 2% of the highest scores and two
are controls with very low scores. We observe that five of
the nine genes analyzed, having different scores in our
method, exhibited significant changes in gene expression.
Among them, a link between AD and phosphoinositides
has been previously mentioned for IPTK1 and PIK3R3.
Also, we found significant differences in the expression of
adrenomedullin (ADM), a peptide involved in a wide

range of physiological and pathological processes [71]. In
particular, ADM prevents damage caused by oxidative
stress through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent pathway, and it was recently [72] reported that lack
of ADM in mouse brain results in behavioral changes. On
the other hand, high levels of ADM in plasma have been
found in patients with chronic Schizophrenia [73], which
confirms its role in brain disorders. Two other new target
genes that also change their expression levels are involved
in neuronal and brain development. The first one, CRKL,
is part of the Reelin pathway, which is necessary for
embryonic development of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus [74]. In particular, CRKL is
required for dendritogenesis but not for axonogenesis in
cultured hippocampal neurons cells [75]. Mice lacking
expression of a CRKL ortholog exhibits several defects in
cardiac and neural crest formation during early stages of
development. CRKL exerts its function as a scaffold protein interacting with phosphorylated tyrosine domains of
dab-1 effector protein. The last gene is Neurogenin 3
(NEUROG3) that is involved in gliogenesis during the
development of the central nervous system [76]. In particular, over-expression of NEUROG3 changes the morphology of dendrites in hippocampal neurons through
reduction of synaptic contacts [77].
Results from RT-qPCR revealed that, at different scores
(even after the first 1%), the assignment of CART procedure identified several new targets for the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway that exhibit changes in their expression levels in
response to Wnt ligand.

Discussion
The majority of known genes regulated through the Wnt
and TCF/β-catenin pathways are important in develop-

mental and differentiation mechanisms in complex
organisms. The training set selected for the proposed
multiple CART strategy is based on this information, and
Gene Ontology analysis revealed that this group of genes
is enriched in categories like multicellular organismal
processes, which involve GO terms like cell differentiation, embryonic development and anatomical structural
development with respect to the whole-genome ontology
information. The genes selected by our method have a
similar distribution of ontology terms but no enrichment
was found. The fact that both groups of genes can be distributed in the same ontologies, lead us to argue that the
loss of enrichment is more related with the change in the
number of genes analyzed than the genes in the group of
candidates themselves. Indeed, the Benjamini-Hochberg
method for multiple testing corrections uses the length of
the data to adjust the p-value. Clustering of gene expression results revealed that our predicted new Wnt/βcatenin pathway target genes in brain tissues have expression profiles similar to those of colorectal cancer cell
lines, which have high levels of accumulated β-catenin.
This similarity suggests a conserved mechanism to regulate the expression of these genes, based in β-catenin and
TCF/LEF interactions. Our RT-qPCR results indicated
that some of the new Wnt/β-catenin pathway targets
assigned using the multiple CART method change their
expression levels when Wnt/β-catenin ligands are overexpressed. The physiological role for some of these new
targets revealed that these genes are particularly involved
in brain pathologies. We also associated the database
from Hatzis et al. [32] (containing TCF4 chromatin occupancy data) with our predicted new candidates involved
in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and we found that 24
genes from our list had been detected in a ChIP-coupled

DNA microarray. TNFRS21 is an example of a gene that
did not change its expression level in the presence of
exogenous Wnt expression; however, this gene has been
reported as Wnt target by ChIP with colorectal cancer
cell lines and TCF4 antibodies [32]. Remarkably,
TNFRSF21 receptor gene, also known as Death receptor 6
(DR6), is widely expressed in neurons and regulates axon
pruning and neuronal death [78]. In addition to the role
DR6 plays in neuronal development, APP was also identified as a ligand for this receptor, and their interaction
activates a caspase-dependent self-destruction program,
suggesting that extracellular fragments of APP may contribute to AD [78].
Other genes assigned as Wnt/β-catenin pathway targets
by the proposed method may be involved in brain or nervous systems abnormalities other than AD. For example,
elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (EEF1A2) corresponds to an
isoform belonging to the elongation factor family complex. This isoform has been predominantly detected in
brain, heart and muscle tissues [79] and has been implicated as an oncogene in ovarian and breast tumors
[80,81]. A spontaneous autosomal recessive mutation in
EEF1A2 is responsible for the waste phenotype in mouse,
which, among others effects, shows abnormalities in the
spinal cord and brain stem and leads to severe motor neuron degeneration [82,83]. Finally, the oncogene PIM2,
which is dysregulated in acute leukemia [84], has recently
been shown to be up-regulated in a microarray screen
using post-mortem brain-derived microglia [85]. The
expression level of EEF1A2 and PIM2 did not change in
our RT-qPCR measurements, suggesting that another
condition or synergistic signaling pathway is required to
regulate their expression in response to Wnt ligands. In
this direction, the fact that some of the relevant transcription factors used by the proposed method have been
described acting together with β-catenin supports the
idea that other regulators besides LEF1 can control gene
expression. More interesting, the presence of nuclear
receptors as GR and HNF4α suggests a crosstalk between
hormone regulation and Wnt/β-catenin pathway to control gene expression in brain.
A more detailed analysis of each one of these Wnt/βcatenin target genes is required to prove in vivo whether
their change in gene expression levels is a direct response
to Wnt pathway activation or corresponds to more complex signaling networks that operate in brain tissues.
However, to our knowledge, this study represents the first
approach to use cis regulatory module information and a
CART strategy to propose a global analysis to detect new
genes involved in brain diseases and AD.

Conclusions
In this study, we developed a method to identify new
Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes based on the analy-

sis of the number of times that each of 432 selected transcription factors binding site motifs appear in the
promoter region of the genes (1,000 bp upstream and 200
bp downstream of the gene transcription start site) in the
human genome. We developed a strategy based on the
use of the CART method to detect genes in which the
presence of TF binding site motifs is similar to the one in
the known targets of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Through the classification method, we proposed 89
new candidates in which transcriptional regulation could
be controlled under the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The tissue-specific expression profiles of these genes
revealed a common pattern between brain tissues and,
notably, are similar to colorectal carcinoma profiles,
where increased levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin are
responsible for activating expression of several groups of
genes [31]. In agreement with these results, several of the
new candidates bind to LEF1, and it is well established
that TCF/LEF1 forms a complex with β-catenin to activate the expression of genes under the canonical Wnt
pathway [28].
The Wnt pathway potentially promotes neuronal survival and rescues deficiencies resulting from alterations in
the expression of Wnt components [21]. Among the new
candidates, we found several genes that could be regulated through the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and
their function is to regulate neuronal physiology and
brain tumorigenesis, to decrease the levels of Aβ fibrils
and to promote soluble APP forms. Further analysis is
required to demonstrate a direct interaction between
TCF/LEF1 transcription factors with the promoter
regions of these genes in response to the activated Wnt/
β-catenin, but the predictions made by the proposed
CART method revealed a strong connection between the
canonical Wnt pathway and the cooperative control of
gene transcription in brain physiology and neuropathology, in particular AD.

Methods
Multiple CART predictor algorithm

In this work we developed a supervised classification
method; that is, a method that uses a set of examples with
known classification to train a predictor, which can then
be used to classify a new sample. In this case, we classified human genes using as characteristic variables the
number of times each TF binding site motif from a list of
432 motifs obtained from [86] occurs in the upstream
region of the gene (more precisely, 1,000 bp upstream and
200 bp downstream of the gene transcription start site,
but for simplicity we call it the "upstream region"). We
classified with respect to two classes: class 1 containing
known Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes and class 2
containing the remaining genes.

The group of Ron Shamir [86] used PRIMA and position weight matrices for 432 TRANSFACT motifs to perform a footprinting analysis of 15,476 human promoters
for the region between 1,000 bp before and 200 bp after
the transcription start site. These motifs are associated to
290 transcription factors. We downloaded their data
from http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/prima/PRIMA.htm and built
a matrix of 15,476 rows (representing genes) by 432 columns (representing TF binding site motifs), where each
entry in the matrix contains the number of times each
motif was found in the upstream region of the gene
(Additional File 6).
We obtained from The Wnt Homepage [38] a list of 107
known target genes for the Wnt pathway and we filtered
it to select β-catenin/LEF1 target genes. To further refine
this list, we selected only human genes in which LEF1
interaction with the promoter regions has been experimentally proven using electrophoretic mobility shift
assays, ChIP or reporter assays. Finally, 66 genes (Additional File 1) were considered as the initial set of Wnt/βcatenin pathway target genes. We observe that these
genes were included in the 15,476 genes obtained from
Shamir's web page.
Our classification method proposes the use of a series
of 1,500 "Classification and Regression Trees" (abbreviated CART). This last is a supervised classification
method which builds, based on a training sample, a hierarchy of variables that are used to recursively split the
sample into coherent groups, until a certain degree of
separation of the sample is achieved. This chain of splits
can be visualized as a binary tree (called CART tree),
which can be used to classify a new individual. In our
case, each internal node of the tree (including the root
and excluding the leaves) is associated to a TF binding
site motif identifier and a threshold value c (Figure 3).
The leaf nodes are only associated to a class label. The
classification of an individual gene starts at the root node.
If the TF binding site motif corresponding to the node
appears more than c times in the upstream region of the
gene, one moves to the node corresponding to the "right
child", if not, one moves to the "left child". This procedure
continues until a leaf node is reached, and its class label
defines the class attributed to the gene.
To start the training of a single CART tree, we put in
class 1 the 66 genes experimentally validated as Wnt/βcatenin pathway targets described above, and we formed
class 2 with 8,000 genes randomly generated among the
remaining 15,410 genes. These 8,066 genes are associated
to the root node of the tree. The training algorithm,
described in detail in [87], partitions at each iteration the
training set associated to an internal node into two
groups according to a particular choice of a TF binding
site motif and a threshold c; one determines a subset of
genes associated to the left child and the other one a sub-

than c1. The resulting nodes are further subdivided to determine the
assigned class.

set of genes associated to the right child as explained
before. The splitting (i.e. selection of the TF binding site
motif and the threshold c associated to the node) is performed in such a way that the "average Gini impurity" < G
> is minimized, where:
< G >=

N LG L + N RG R
,
NL +N R

NL, NR are the number of genes associated to the node
we are splitting that are candidates to pass to the left and
to the right branches respectively, and for b = L and b = R

Gb = 1 −

N b,12 + N b,2 2
(N b,1 + N b,2 ) 2

with Nb,1 and Nb,2 the number of genes initially in class
1 and class 2 moving to branch b respectively. The change
in the Gini impurity can be interpreted as a measure of
the effectiveness of a given TF binding site motif to characterize or determine the class of a gene. That is, in our
context, if it is a target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
This algorithm stops once the Gini impurity decrease is
zero at all leaf nodes. We observe that no pruning is

Hödar et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:348

achieved at this step. In fact, to obtain robust predictions
for the whole population we used "sample test": only a
part of the labeled sample is used to construct the first
tree and the rest is used to test and to prune the tree,
searching a minimal misclassification. Thus, after this
first tree was constructed, we started the evaluation and
pruning of the tree using a second set of 8,000 randomly
chosen genes. We put in class 2 the set difference of this
new collection with the first randomly chosen set of 8,000
genes (approx. 4,000 genes remain in practice), and in
class 1 remained the same previously used 66 genes since
its size is too small. Essentially as in the classical theory of
CART [87], in this step we used the option of considering
only splits whose impurity decrease is greater than a
given cost to obtain a sub-tree (or pruned tree) of the first
one. We kept the sub-tree that minimizes the classification error in this second set of genes. This finishes the
procedure to build a single CART tree.
Using the procedure described above we built 1,500
independent CART trees and each one of the 15,476
genes was classified either in class 1 or class 2 by each
tree. The score of a gene was defined as the number of
trees among these 1,500 that classify it in class 1. Another
criterion is to use Random Forest [88].
Finally, we considered a gene as a candidate to be a Wnt/
β-catenin pathway target if its score was above a threshold C (Figure 1). We chose a simple way to determine the
value of C. That is, we ordered genes with respect to their
scores and C is the value determining the highest percentile. A general view of the method is provided in Figure 4.
This method was implemented on the R statistical package using rpart library. To accelerate the procedure the
implementation considers the use of a distributed system
of computers. It is available in Additional File 7.

Figure 4 General structure of the proposed method. We trained
1,500 CART trees using 66 known target genes marked as black dots
and two groups of 8,000 randomly chosen genes from a list of 15,476
genes in the human genome. The first group is used to produce a first
tree and the second to prune and evaluate it. The classification method
is the consolidation of the results of the 1,500 CART trees.

Ranking of transcription factors

To quantify the importance for the classification of each
TF binding site motif we analyzed each one of the 1,500
CART trees produced by the method. We considered the
number of times a TF binding site motif was associated to
a tree and the depth of the nodes it is associated. Then we
defined two indexes. The first one (I1) was used to rank
"primary variables", i.e. more weight is given to the variables used to partition the population near the root. For
each TF binding site motif m, it is given by the following
formula:
1,500

I1(m) =

∑ ∑

2 −depth(n) ,

i =1 n∈NTi (m)

where NTi(m) is the set of internal nodes of the ith-tree
associated to m and depth(n) is the depth of node n in

such tree. The second index (score) simply counts the
number of trees where each motif was used.
Then we constructed two rankings, one for each index.
With both we found interesting biological interpretations. In Table 1 we show the TFs that appeared to be
more relevant from the biological point of view using
both criteria.
Cross-validation of the method

In the discussion below we already analyzed the biological relevance of the results of the application of our strategy. From the methodological point of view, we used the
"leave-one-out cross-validation" methodology to study
how sensitive is the proposed method to detect known
Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes. The leave-one-out
cross-validation was applied as follows: one of the 66
known Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes was isolated
and the remaining 65 genes were used to train the multi-

ple CART predictors as described before. After, we generated the list of proposed new Wnt/β-catenin pathway
target genes using the highest percentile criterion and we
computed the indexes of the variables. We obtained that
100% of the known Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes
were correctly classified when not considered in the
training set, and at least 144 (93%) of the predicted target
genes were the same as when no gene was excluded from
the training set.
We also evaluated the robustness in relation to changes
in the training sets by performing four independent
instances of our method and comparing their predictions.
Over 95% of the proposed genes are recovered when our
method is used with different samplings, and the known
Wnt/β-catenin genes are always detected as seen in Table
4. Among the coincidences the most relevant were calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CamK4),
for which there exist strong evidences for up-regulation
in response to both Wnt ligands and lithium [50], and tropomyosin 1 (alpha) that is associated with neurofibrillary
pathology of AD [50].
Comparison with other classification methods

To compare the performance of our strategy with other
classification methods, using the same data we produced
classifiers with classical implementations of K nearest
neighbours method (KNN), for K taking values from 1 to
5, Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, with radial
basis, and standard CART method, as implemented in
the R statistical platform in the libraries 'class', 'e1071' and
'rpart'. All data (15,476 genes) was classified using those
methods (see results in Additional File 1) and we computed the sensitivity of classifying known Wnt/β-catenin
pathway target genes, as shown in column 'Prior' in Table
4. KNN was performed using directly 'knn.cv' routine
(which also implements a leave-one-out test) over all data
and it did not recover the known Wnt/β-catenin pathway
target genes. When K = 1 this method proposed 30 candidates and only one of them coincides with our predic-

tions; when K = 2 there are 17 proposed target genes,
none of them coincides with our prediction; and for K
greater than or equal to 3 all genes were classified as nontargets. The SVM method (trained using 10-fold crossvalidation) recovered all known target genes but all others were classified in class 2 of non-target genes. This is
probably a result derived from over-fitting, which is
expected given the huge asymmetry between the two
classes. The single CART was trained using all 66 known
Wnt/β-catenin target genes and a sample of 8,000 genes
not a priori related to this pathway, and then pruned as
described previously. In this case 44 of the 66 known
Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes were recovered and
46 new targets were proposed. The coincidence with our
method was 37%, that is, 58 genes appeared in all
instances of our method. Table 4 summarizes the coincidences of these methods and indicates the number of
known genes recovered by each one.
Database analysis of tissue-specific gene expression and
Gene Ontology analysis

Gene Ontology analysis was performed using Ontologizer software [46]. Overrepresentation of GO terms was
calculated considering the parent-child intersection relationship [89]. Benjamini - Hochberg FDR procedure for
multiple test correction was applied.
The Wnt target candidate tissue expression was analyzed using the online tool BioGPS available at http://
biogps.gnf.org[90]. This database represents an extensive
collection of data from human gene expression samples
across a diverse array of tissues, organs and cell lines.
These samples were predominantly obtained from physiologically normal humans, and thus this dataset represents a preliminary but substantial portion of the normal
mammalian transcriptome [91]. Gene expression data
values were downloaded from two microarrays platforms:
GNF1H with MAS5 and gcRMA normalization procedures and U95A. Data were used to perform cluster analysis considering Pearson distance and average linkage.

Biological validation

We chose HEK 293 as our experimental model as it has
been widely used as an appropriate cellular model for
Wnt activation experiments. In this study we have used a
stable clone for the expression of Wnt-3a ligand, and for
this purpose we have considered HEK 293 cells that have
been successfully used in the past for Wnt ligand production [92-94]. Interestingly, initial results obtained by
DNA microarray analysis of HEK 293 cells showed that
293 cells stain strongly and specifically with antibodies to
several neurofilament proteins, which are generally
thought of as excellent markers for neuronal lineage cells
[95]. Two cell lines were generated to verify the response
of predicted Wnt targets. Human embryonic kidney 293
(HEK-293) cells were stably transfected with a pcDNA/
Wnt expression vector to ensure over-expression of Wnt
ligands. The same cells were also transfected with empty
vector pcDNA as a control. Anti-Hemagglutinin epitope
tag (HA) immunodetection was used to confirm the presence of Wnt ligands in the media as previously described
in [96]. RNA from both cultures was extracted using the
TRI Reagent kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNAs were then treated with an
RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed
with Oligo-dT and Superscript II (Invitrogen). RNA isolated from HEK-293 cells was spiked (1:2,000) with RNA
synthesized from Bacillus subtilis Dap (ATCC 87486) as a
control to normalize replicates. Changes in mRNA levels
were determined by RT-qPCR using LightCycler realtime PCR system (Roche). The primers are shown in
Table 5. Real-time amplification data were analyzed using
the DD-CT method [97], and statistical significance was
determined by a t-test.
