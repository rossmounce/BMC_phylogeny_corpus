Abstract
Background: With the publication of the draft chicken genome and the recent production of
several BAC clone libraries from non-avian reptiles and birds, it is now possible to undertake more
detailed comparative genomic studies in Reptilia. Of interest in particular are the genomic events
that transformed the large, repeat-rich genomes of mammals and non-avian reptiles into the
minimalist chicken genome. We have used paired BAC end sequences (BESs) from the American
alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) and emu (Dromaius
novaehollandiae) to investigate patterns of sequence divergence, gene and retroelement content,
and microsynteny between these species and chicken.
Results: From a total of 11,967 curated BESs, we successfully mapped 725, 773 and 2597
sequences in alligator, turtle, and emu, respectively, to sites in the draft chicken genome using a
stringent BLAST protocol. Most commonly, sequences mapped to a single site in the chicken
genome. Of 1675, 1828 and 2936 paired BESs obtained for alligator, turtle, and emu, respectively,
a total of 34 (alligator, 2%), 24 (turtle, 1.3%) and 479 (emu, 16.3%) pairs were found to map with
high confidence and in the correct orientation and with BAC-sized intermarker distances to single
chicken chromosomes, including 25 such paired hits in emu mapping to the chicken Z
chromosome. By determining the insert sizes of a subset of BAC clones from these three species,
we also found a significant correlation between the intermarker distance in alligator and turtle and
in chicken, with slopes as expected on the basis of the ratio of the genome sizes.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that a large number of small-scale chromosomal rearrangements
and deletions in the lineage leading to chicken have drastically reduced the number of detected
syntenies observed between the chicken and alligator, turtle, and emu genomes and imply that small
deletions occurring widely throughout the genomes of reptilian and avian ancestors led to the
~50% reduction in genome size observed in birds compared to reptiles. We have also mapped and
identified likely gene regions in hundreds of new BAC clones from these species.

Background
Knowledge of structural changes occurring in amniote
genomes is critical for an understanding of patterns of
genome evolution and of the evolution of species in general. Structural changes include deletion and insertion of
coding or non-coding sequences, segmental translocations, and transposition. Structural variations in genomes
are likely to underlie significant functional differences
between species. Studies of the occurrence of such structural transformations between chromosomes can also
permit reconstruction of genome structure of common
ancestors. For example, many comparative studies have
been performed in the mammals, including mouse/
human comparisons [1,2] and human/chimpanzee comparisons [3]. These studies require the availability of a
large amount of molecular data (complete or partial
genome sequence, or BAC/YAC sequences). With the publication of the chicken genome [4,5], it is now possible to
investigate structural relationships between the genomes
of non-mammalian amniote species by comparative analyses.
Among the amniotes, the genome structures of reptilian
species are poorly known, although studies in this group
are increasing. Broad-scale synteny of whole chromosomes has been established between the chicken Z chromosome and chromosome 5 of turtle [6]. Recently, Kawai
et al. [7] showed that the chicken Z exhibits synteny with
various arms of autosomes in a turtle, crocodilian, and
snake. However these studies, which have been based primarily on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of BAC probes to chromosome spreads or wholegenome comparative hybridization [8,9], are still limited
in taxonomic scope. Such chromosomal studies, as well as
traditional molecular phylogenetic studies and global
analyses of genome characteristics, can enlighten the phylogenetic relationships of species, for example the position of turtles, which is now generally agreed to fall near
if not sister to the archosaur clade consisting of birds and
crocodilians [10-15].
Because of their streamlined genomes, birds are excellent
lineages taxa in which to conduct comparative and structural evolutionary genomics [16]. The chicken (Gallus gallus) is the closest species to non-avian reptiles for which
the genome has been sequenced [5]. The size of the
chicken genome size (1C) is 1.25 Gb. The emu (Dromaius
novaehollandiae) is a ratite, belonging to the palaeognathous birds, a basal avian group [17]. The genome of the
emu is 1.63 Gb [18-20] and is distributed among 40 chromosomes (1n = 1x = 40). Unlike Z and W sex chromosomes of the chicken, which are highly diverged, the sex
chromosomes of the emu exhibit little dimorphism and
exhibit evolutionary dynamics similar to emu autosomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S2/S8

[21]. The number of macro- and microchromosomes in
the ratites is very similar to the chicken [21].
The genomes sizes of the American alligator (Alligator mississipiensis; 2.49 Gb) and the painted turtle (Chrysemys
picta; 2.57 Gb) are roughly double that of chicken [22,23].
These species do not have dimorphic sex chromosomes –
in fact, both species exhibit temperature-dependent sex
determination (TSD) [24]. The American alligator karyotype is composed of 16 chromosomes, with no microchromosomes as in the chicken and the painted turtle
[25]. The Emydidae, the family to which the painted turtle
belongs, has a karyotype composed of 25 or 26 pairs of
chromosomes (12–14 pairs of macrochromosomes and
12–14 pairs of microchromosomes) [26].
With their large insert sizes and ability to provide access to
coding as well as noncoding regions, bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) libraries provide another means of
probing structural evolutionary changes in genomes
[27,28]. Sequences of BAC clones have been used frequently to perform comparative studies such as construction of shotgun contigs, analyses of copy number variants
and of physical maps, FISH mapping between species,
identification of genes involved in diseases or building of
virtual genomes [2,29-36]. BAC end sequences (BESs) are
single-pass sequences obtained from each end of a BAC
clones. These end sequences can be very specific markers
and are excellent sources of sequence information that
can be utilized in comparative genomics studies or for
identification of orthologous regions between species
[37]. In addition, because they ostensibly represent random snapshots of a given genome, BESs can be used to
access genome content, repeated elements, protein-coding and conserved noncoding regions of a genome. For
example, Shedlock et al [38] amassed several thousand
BESs amounting to over 5 Mb of sequences from two reptile BAC libraries (American Alligator alligator and
Painted painted Turtle) and used these sequences to study
the distribution of repeat elements and microsatellites in
these reptile genomes. Moreover, they documented some
of the genomic differences that underlie the disparities in
genome size between non-avian reptiles and birds. BESs
are also useful means to develop phylogenomic markers.
Thomson et al. [39] recently used several megabases of
BESs from the painted turtle to develop a suite of markers
that they used to examine rates of evolution and depths of
taxonomic coverage.
To better understand structural evolution in the Reptilia
(birds plus non-avian reptiles), we used BLAST to align
BAC end sequences from American alligator, painted turtle, and emu with the chicken genome sequence. By mapping these sequences and studying their orientation in the
chicken genome, we were able to document some of the

types of changes that have accompanied the drastic difference in genome size between non-avian reptiles and birds.

Materials and methods
Databases
The BAC libraries from the alligator, turtle and emu were
developed previously [40] and are available through the
BAC clone program of SymBio Corporation http://
www.sym-bio.com/. Each library is arrayed in 384-well
plates and offers a high level of genome coverage for each
target species (9.0×/11.2×/12.9×, respectively for alligator,
turtle and emu). The alligator and turtle data were the
same as those analyzed by Shedlock et al. [38] and were re
analyzed for this study. For these species, five plates consisting of 1,675 clones were randomly chosen from their
respective BAC libraries, clones were isolated, and both
ends of each selected BAC clone were sequenced using the
dideoxy method [38,40]. The total yield for alligator was
3,218 successful BESs (1543 BAC clones with both
sequenced ends and 132 clones with only one end) with
an average length of 770 bp and a total length of 2.5 Mb.
For turtle, 3,461 BESs (1633 clones with both ends and
195 clones with only one end) were obtained (avg. length
703 bp, total combined length 2.4 Mb). For the emu,
eight randomly chosen plates (total 2,936 clones) were
subjected to end sequencing, yielding a total of 5288 quality reads (avg. length 662 bp, total combined length 3.5
Mb, 2352 clones with both ends and 584 clones with only
one sequenced end). The alligator and turtle BES reads
were generated at The Institute for Genomic Research,
Rockville, MD http://www.tigr.org and the emu BESs at
the
Broad
Institute,
Cambridge,
MA
http://
www.broad.mit.edu using published protocols [2,27]. All
sequences were processed with Phred [41] and
CROSS_MATCH to remove poor quality bases (Q < 20)
and vector sequences, respectively. The turtle and alligator
BESs can be found in the GenBank database under accession numbers CZ250707–CZ253982 (A. mississipiensis)
and CZ253983–CZ257443 (C. picta) [38]. The emu
sequences can be accessed via the NCBI Trace Archive
website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi.

Whole genome sequences for Gallus gallus were downloaded from the Washington University at St. Louis
Genome Sequencing Center web site http://
genome.wustl.edu/. The chicken assembly that was used
here is version 2.1 from October 20, 2005 [5].
BLAST analyses
For each species, a database containing its BESs was created. The BESs in a given database were compared to each
other to detect any redundancy in sequence. Next, the
three BES databases were compared to the chicken
genome sequence using two different BLAST algorithms:
BLASTN and TBLASTX. As a start, an E value cutoff of 10-5

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S2/S8

was selected for each BLAST analysis, without any alignment length criteria. The best matches in the chicken
genome (up to 1000 for each blasted BAC end) were
stored for each BES. BESs with no similarity to known
repetitive elements (see "Repeated elements in the BESs"
section) were annotated based on their most significant
BLAST hit against the chicken genome (E value ≤ 10-20).
For each BES, we designated as a "single BLAST hit" (SBH)
the BLAST hit with the best e-value.
MySQL database
All BLAST results were stored in relational MySQL http://
www.mysql.com databases (one for each species). The
structure of the MySQL databases and the relationships
between the tables in them are presented in the Supplementary Material (Figure S1 in Additional File 1). Custom
python scripts were used to create a toolbox that facilitated comparisons within and between the sequences
databases, BLAST results, and statistical analyses (see
below).
Definition of a paired blast hit
We used the designation "paired BLAST hit" (PBH) to
describe an instance when both BESs from a particular
BAC exhibited significant alignment to the same chicken
chromosome in the same orientation regardless of the distance between hits. Additionally, the qualifier "high quality" (hqPBH) was used to describe a PBH separated by ≤
200 kb. Those PBHs that are not high quality were designated as "low quality" (lqPBH). For all the BESs from a
species, we stored the alignment position(s) on the
chicken genome assembly, the length of the alignment in
nucleotides, the distance along the chicken alignment
between both ends in the case of a PBH, and the E-values
associated with alignments.
Repeated elements in BESs
Visual analysis of the distribution of the number of paired
hit sites per BAC clone and the distance between mapped
hits in the chicken genome (see Results) suggested three
classes of blast hits for each species: BAC clones yielding a
large number of paired hits with a large genomic distance
in the chicken (> 200 kb; lqPBH1); those yielding a small
number of hits (1–4 in alligator and turtle and 1–7 in
emu) and a large chicken genomic distance between them
(lqPBH2); and finally those yielding a small number of
hits and occurring < 200 kb apart in the chicken genome
(hqPBHs).

RepeatMasker [43] was used on sequences for each of the
three classes for each species in order to identify the content for repeat elements in the BESs. RepeatMasker
accessed a database of consensus sequences of repeat elements for various mammalian species and chicken (Repbase version 20061006). The repeat content of the BAC

clone sequences was assessed using default parameters
without specifying the particular species queried or selecting human and/or chicken as the reference species. This
protocol will likely miss many reptile-specific repeats
since there are not many annotated reptile sequences in
the databases, but it is a first step.
Fingerprinting of the BAC clones
For each species, BAC clones that resulted in hqPBHs were
selected for fingerprinting [44]. Thirty-four alligator
clones and 24 turtle hqPBH clones were fingerprinted at
the Washington University at St. Louis Genome Sequencing Center. As the number of hqPBHs for the emu was
large, 50 BAC clones corresponding to hqPBHs from a single 384-well plate were selected for fingerprinting. Using
the statistics software JMP version 7.0 from SAS http://
www.jmp.com, the length of the BAC clone inserts and
the average length of the corresponding paired hits on the
chicken genome were compared for each species. The 95%
confidence plot for each linear regression was used to
assess statistical confidence.
Gene content and statistics of BESs
The diversity of known genes in each hqPBH on the
chicken genome was determined using the UCSC
Genome Browser http://genome.ucsc.edu. The results are
available as a spreadsheet in the Supplementary Material
(Additional File 2). Using JMP, we performed statistical
analyses (χ2, Van de Waerden's, Wald's and Student's ttests) on means and distributions to test various hypotheses (see below).

Results
Blast hits for clones with one characterized sequence
4,095 of the 11,967 BESs from alligator, turtle and emu
(34.2%) exhibited significant hits to the chicken genome
using BLAST. Of the 3,218 sequences from alligator, 725
(22.5%) produced a total of 517,036 BLASTN hits. 773 of
3,461 turtle sequences (22.3%) generated 620,179 BLAST
hits. 2,597 of 5,288 emu sequences (49.1%) generated a
total of 972,993 significant hits. The vast majority (94%,
95% and 82% for alligator, turtle and emu respectively) of

BAC clones with any significant E-values had a single characterized sequence, i.e. only one of the two BESs for a
clone had a significant BLAST hit. The distributions of the
number of BLAST hits per BES to the chicken genome for
each species are presented in the Table 1. For the alligator,
turtle and emu sequence sets, each BES hit on average 713,
802 and 375 sites in the chicken genome, respectively,
although there was wide variation in the number of hits
per BES. The most common result was to hit single sites in
the chicken genome (Table 1). By contrast, between 4.5%
(emu) and 6.3% (alligator) of clones with only one successfully BLASTed sequence matched the chicken genome
at greater than 100 sites (Table 1). The emu had a larger
number of clones with a small number (1–5) of hits, and
a smaller number of clones with a large number of hits,
than did alligator and turtle (Table 1). The distribution of
the length of the blast hits is quite similar in the three
query species (average hit length 38 ± 12 bp, 35 ± 21 bp,
and 39 ± 14 bp, respectively), with a similar range in alligator and turtle (24 – 908 and 968 bp, respectively) and a
somewhat shorter maximum in emu (24 – 680 bp; Supplementary Figure S1 in Additional File 1).
The diploid chicken genome is divided into 10 larger
autosomes (macrochromosomes), W and Z sex chromosomes, and 66 microchromosomes. Various studies have
revealed different evolutionary dynamics for these different types of chromosomes [5,45,46], prompting us to
divide our analyses along those same lines. The number of
hits on the chicken genome was therefore separated by
macro-, micro- and sex chromosomes. In all three species,
there is a broad correlation between the total number of
hits for each chicken chromosomal class and the fraction
of the chicken genome taken up by that chromosomal
class (Figure 1; Supplementary Table S1 in Additional File
1). However, the observed number of hits on chicken
macro-, micro- and sex chromosomes was nonetheless
significantly different than their expected frequencies
given the fraction of the genome taken up by these chromosomal classes (all tests df = 2; Alligator χ2 = 6827; Turtle χ2 = 15080; Emu χ2 = 28717; all P < 0.00001). This
difference also holds when considering only the chromo-

somal class occupied by the SBHs (alligator χ2 = 22; turtle
χ2 = 83; emu χ2 = 336; all P < 0.001). We then examined
the distribution of hits for each individual chicken chromosome. For clones with a just a single successfully
BLASTed BES, this broad correlation of hits and chromosome size extends to individual chicken chromosomes,
whether considering all hits per sequence or only the best
hit per sequence (SBH) (Figure 2; Supplementary Table S2
in Additional File 1). Nonetheless, for both situations, the
distribution of total hits among chromosomes was significantly different from the distribution predicted by
chicken chromosome size for all species (all tests df = 31;
all hits: alligator χ2 = 65113; turtle χ2 = 90374; emu χ2 =
360017; all P < 0.00001; single hits: alligator χ2 = 83.9;
turtle χ2 = 121.7; emu χ2 = 106.3; all P < 0.0001). The
number of hits per chromosome was either significantly
greater or less than expected for all chromosomes except
chicken 30 (Wald's test; Supplementary Table S3 in Additional File 1). Even chicken chromosome 16, which comprises less than half a percent of the chicken genome, is
represented by some hits from all three species, although
fewer than expected (Figure 2; Supplementary Table S2 in
Additional File 1). Considering all hits, the general pattern is that chicken macrochromosomes 1–4 (1–3 for turtle hits) and the Z chromosome are overrepresented by
hits whereas all other chromosomes are underrepresented. Considering only the SBHs, alligator hits had a
single overrepresented chicken chromosome (chr 1) and
seven underrepresented; turtle showed four overrepresented (including chicken chr 1) and three underrepresented;
and
emu
showed
four
significantly
overrepresented chicken chromosomes and two underrepresented, including the Z.

Figure 2
Distribution of BLAST hits among chicken chromosomes
Distribution of BLAST hits among chicken chromosomes.

The percent sequence identities of BLAST hits to the
chicken genome in each chromosomal class were generally very high and similar among species, falling between
97.7 – 98.6%. In all species the distribution of identities
showed a peak at the highest identity (> 99%) and a long
tail down to 80–82%, depending on the species (Supplementary Figure S2 in Additional File 1). Nonetheless, ttests show that the average percent identity among
chicken macro-, micro- and sex chromosomes within each
species showed significant variation (with the exception
of the emu micro- and sex chromosomes); for alligator
and turtle the identity for hits on the chicken sex chromosomes was significantly lower than for autosomes,
whereas for emu hits on both micro- and sex chromosomes were lower than for macrochromosomes. For all
chromosome classes the emu hits showed significantly
higher sequence identity.
Paired blast hits (PBHs)
We next examined for PBHs (those in the correct orientation on the same chicken chromosome, regardless of the
distance between them on the chicken genome). By these
criteria, approximately 3% of the alligator and turtle
clones had at least one paired hit, whereas over 18% of the
emu clones had paired blast hits on the chicken genome
(Supplementary Table S4 in Additional File 1). The large
number of hits for some clones with PHs could be
explained by a large number of highly redundant hits
(Table 2). As with clones with a single successfully
BLASTed sequence, the distributions of the number of
PBHs show that the vast majority of the BAC clones had
very few paired hits, and the most common result was to
have a single PBH (Table 2). The average length of BLAST
hits from clones with PBHs was significantly greater than
the length for hits from clones with a single successfully

BLASTed end sequence (Supplementary Table S4 in Additional File 1).
For all three species the average distances between PBHs
on the chicken genome ranged from 10 kb to more than
100 Mb (Figures 3, 4, 5). However, for each analysis, the
plots could be divided into three distinct groups: lqPBH1
and 2, and hqPBH (see Methods for definitions).
We focused on the hqPBHs. We found that for all three
species, hqPBHs nearly always have a small number of
hits in the chicken genome. (In many cases the number of
sites of hqPBHs in the chicken genome is even smaller
than we have indicated in Figures 3, 4, 5 because the
genomic coordinates of different pairs are in all cases virtually identical, within 100 bp of each other and usually
much less [see Supplementary Material – Additional File
2]. Therefore each BAC clone with hqPBHs could in fact
be represented by only one hit.) The number of clones
with hqPBHs was a very small percentage of the total
number of clones for both alligator and turtle, but for emu
this percentage was moderate (Supplementary Tables S2
and S4 in Additional File 1). In the emu a larger number
of PBHs occurring less then 200 kb apart in the chicken
genome mapped to multiple sites in the chicken genome
(Table 2). On average, hqPBHs from emu were significantly farther apart in the chicken genome (mean 108,079
± 19,788 bp) than in the alligator or turtle (means 65,306
± 19,324 bp and 86,487 ± 23,934 bp, respectively; Supplementary Figure S4 in Additional File 1).
The distribution among chicken chromosomes of hqPBHs showed a weaker relationship to chromosome size
for all species, presumably due to smaller sample size
(Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S2 in
Additional File 1). The number of hqPBHs for turtle was
significantly overrepresented on chicken chromosomes 1
and 2 and for emu hits on chicken chromosomes 12, 20
and (marginally) 26; emu hqPBHs on chicken Z were
marginally underrepresented (Supplementary Table S3 in
Additional File 1). The hqPBHs from alligator are mainly
on macrochromosomes and none occur on chicken sex
chromosomes. The turtle hqPBHs are equally represented

on macro- and microchromosomes but again are not
present on chicken sex chromosomes. By contrast, the
emu hqPBHs have orthologous sites on 25 chromosomes
of all three chromosomal classes. The number of emu

groups of data. The sequences involved in hqPBHs have
significantly fewer repeat elements (5× or 2× less for alligator or turtle, respectively) than their respective total data
sets or lqPBHs. This is especially the case for the non-longterminal repeat retrotransposons of the chicken Repeat 1
(CR1) class. The sequences in lqPBHs of the alligator and
turtle have 22 and 10 times more CR1 elements respectively than the hqPBH sequences. By contrast, the hqPBH
sequences of the emu clones have the same repeat element content as the total data set. The emu lqPBH
sequences have a slightly higher number of repeat elements.

Correlations among interspecific genomic distances
To quantify the relationship between genomic distances
between markers in the chicken genome and in the
genomes of alligator, turtle and emu, the insert sizes of
BAC clones with an hqPBH were determined via fingerprinting. All hqPBH alligator and turtle BAC clones were
fingerprinted (of which 27 and 22 were successful) and
among the 479 emu BAC clones with hqPBH(s) we chose
50 that appeared to span a wide range of distances in the
chicken genome (~40 – 160 kb). The results of eight emu
clones were disregarded because estimated insert sizes
were unrealistically large (~300 kb). Figure 7A-C shows
the correlation between the lengths of the hqPBHs
mapped on the chicken genome and the estimated insert
sizes of the corresponding BAC clones. The regressions of
the alligator and turtle BAC clones are significant with
slopes close to 0.50, remarkably close to the ratio of the
genome sizes compared to chicken (0.50 for alligator and
0.48 for turtle). The emu linear regression had a slope of
0.67, again close to that predicted by the ratio of genome
sizes (0.77), but was not significant.
Analysis of repetitive elements
We studied the genomic content of the BAC end data set,
as well as any consistent differences between classes of
BAC clones, using RepeatMasker. For each species, three
groups of clones were screened (Table 3): the complete
BAC-end data set ('total'), clones with hqPBH(s), and the
remaining sequences involved in paired hits (lqPBHs1
and 2). The alligator and turtle data sets revealed significant differences in repeat element content in the three

Gene content
To keep our analysis of gene content focused on those
results of highest priority for comparative mapping purposes, using the UCSC Genome Browser we inferred gene
content only for the 537 BAC clones with hqPBHs across
species. We mapped the two end-sequences to the chicken
genome then queried the Genome Browser as to which
gene occurred in the chicken genome between the two
landmarks. Thus there is a single inferred gene set of each
BAC clone. The complete results are included in Supplementary Material (Additional File 2). Gene predictions
included many of interest to the biology of birds and reptiles, including 25 clones mapping to all portions of the
chicken Z chromosome. These mapped genes provide useful predictions for the gene content of the original BAC
clones. For example, emu BAC clone B10 in plate 280 is
predicted to contain sequences similar to doublesex and
mab-3 related transcription factors DMRT1 and DMRS3.
Intriguingly, this emu sequence mapped with high confi-

higher stringency tests for conservation of synteny, and on
a scale complementary to that provided by techniques
such as FISH. Despite the high temporal and sequence
divergence of comparisons in our study, the relative frequency of significant BLAST hits for both single sequence
BACs and PBHs is consistent with the relative divergence
times of the alligator, turtle and emu from chicken.

Discussion

As expected, the emu sequences had the highest frequency
of significant BLAST hits (~50%) to the chicken genome.
The divergence time between the ratites and the Galliformes is around 120 My – about half the divergence time
between chicken and alligator (220 My) and that of
chicken and turtle (240 My) [11,52,53]. The similarities of
the emu sequences with the chicken genome are confirmed by the small number of hits per BAC clone
sequence and the fact that these hits are generally longer
than those of the two non-avian reptiles. For example,
870 emu BAC-end sequences (34% of the BAC-end
sequences with hits) have at least one hit longer than 200
bp. By contrast, the proportion of large hits is significantly
smaller for the alligator and turtle sequences: only 16%
and 15% of their respective BAC-end sequences have a
blast hit longer than 200 bp.

We have mapped in silico 11,967 BESs from three Reptilia,
including a basal bird: American alligator, painted turtle
and an emu. These three species are phylogenetically well
placed to better understand the origin of the chicken
genome and to put more detail on evolutionary events in
the Reptilia, the amniote group that is the sister group of
mammals. Recently hybridization methods, such as FISH
and array CGH [49], as well as in silico mapping of BAC
sequences [50], have been applied to the comparison of
two relatively closely related birds, chicken and turkey.
These studies, as well as previous chromosomal work in
birds, have found a relatively conservative pattern of chromosomal inversions, due both to the recency of divergence of these species and to the overall conservative
mode of chromosome evolution in birds, and possibly
the Reptilia in general [46,51]. This conservatism extends
to cross-hybridization studies between birds and nonavian reptiles such as turtles [6,9]. FISH studies tend to
detect broad-scale synteny and are little affected by intrachromosomal micro- or even BAC-scale changes in synteny. By contrast, in silico mapping of BESs between highly
diverged species such as we have examined here results in

The analyses of clones with PBHs revealed that their frequency in the emu was roughly five times greater than for
alligator or turtle, as compared with roughly two times
higher frequency of single hits. This difference is even
higher (eight-fold greater) when considering only hqPBHs. Whereas 16% of the emu clones had hqPBH(s), the

turtle and the alligator BAC clones have 1.3% and 2%
such hits. These results confirm that the emu genome has
retained a larger number of areas of microsyntenic regions
since the divergence of modern birds as compared with
the alligator and turtle. Griffin et al. [54] suggested that
retention of microsynteny should be the rule in avian
genomes. In an analogous study using PCR, Thomson et
al. [39] recently showed that the fraction of BESs from the
painted turtle library that could be reliably amplified from
other turtles decayed linearly with divergence time from

the painted turtle time at a rate of -0.25 to -0.32% amplifiability per million years; the fraction of painted turtle
loci amplified from target species fell from over 80%
among recently diverged species to less than 20% in some
cases for species diverged more than 200 MYA.
The analysis of repeated elements in our BAC end
sequences is also consistent with what we know about
genome structure in reptiles. In the alligator and the turtle,
the repeat element content is relatively high compared to

birds [40], thus we expected that alligator and turtle BESs
would contain more repeat elements than the emu
sequences. The chicken genome is approximately 12%
repeat elements, which are widely dispersed throughout
the genome and dominated by the CR1 family of LINEs
[5,55]. As a result, BACs in which both sequences contain
repeated elements often had very high hit numbers,
regardless of sequence length or insert size. This probably
underlies the association between high hit number and
very large inferred regions of the chicken genome delimited by paired markers (Figures 3, 4, 5). The difference in
repeat element content between hqPBHs and lqPBH
groups 1 and 2 was pronounced in alligator and the turtle,
whereas the emu sequences appears to have a relatively
low number of repeat elements (~2.5–3%), even as compared to other birds [49]. Whether or not this low repeat
content extends to the genome as a whole is an unanswered question, but we have noticed very low repeat element contents in fully sequenced BACs in the online data
bases (A. Shedlock, D. Janes, S. Edwards, unpubl.). This
pattern contrasts with the significantly larger genome size
of emus relative to chicken, which is routinely assumed to
be due to proliferation of repeated elements. The effect of
this low repeat element content in emu is to minimize the
number of spurious, non-unique hits to the chicken
genome, which might explain the high proportion of hqPBHs.
hqPBHs of the emu are present in nearly all chromosomes. The emu was the only species to have any hqPBHs
on the chicken Z chromosome. Comparisons of physical
and genetic maps among various bird lineages suggest
that this chromosome is highly conserved in its gene order
[56-59]. The emu Z and W chromosomes are similar in
size and as large as some chicken macro chromosomes;
chromosome painting revealed that the emu Z and W and
chicken Z chromosomes are broadly homologous across

their entire length [60]. In addition the psuedoautosomal
region of the emu Z chromosome exhibits levels of nucleotide diversity and recombination that are similar to emu
autosomes [61]. There was one emu clone whose best single hit was on the chicken W (Supplementary Table S2 in
Additional File 1); whether this represents a bona fide
homology remains to be seen. That the coverage of the
chicken W is still poor in draft chicken genome release 2.1
and that the W is very small in chickens may also explain
this result. Regardless, this study has identified numerous
clones that can be characterized to better understand the
emu sex chromosomes and autosomes. It is unclear
whether the lack of alligator or turtle hqPBHs on the
chicken Z is due to high levels of sequence divergence, a
lack of sex chromosomes in these species (both have temperature dependent sex determination) or insufficient
coverage in our survey. Turtle chromosome 5 was found
to be completely homologous to the chicken Z chromosome [6], and so it may be that the anonymous sequences
available through BAC ends are too diverged from chicken
for in silico mapping. Certainly there are many alligator
and turtle BAC clones whose SBH is on the Z chromosome, and these warrant further investigation.
The correlation of the distance between genomic markers
of different species and chicken was high for alligator and
turtle, but less strong for the emu, even though the emu
comparison had a higher number of intervals for comparison. In each case the slope of the fit was close to the ratio
of genome sizes between query and target species. The
weak relationship in emu could be a result of the more
similar genome sizes between the emu and chicken (1.63
Gb vs. 1.25 Gb, respectively), a difference of only 30% of
the chicken genome size. By contrast, the alligator and turtle have genome sizes roughly double that of chicken.
Nonetheless the high correlation in all species suggests
that there was a contribution to genome size reduction in

the avian lineage of many small deletions on the size scale
of BAC clones. The small genomes of birds are thought to
have arisen deep within the therapod dinosaurian lineage
from which birds evolved, and yet the deletion of retroelements from amniote ancestors has been estimated to
comprise only 15–20% of this reduction in genome size
[40]. Our analysis of hqPBHs in particular suggests that
single- or low-copy regions of the genome have also experienced reductions in size. In some lineages of birds there
appears to be a bias toward deletions comprising a few
base pairs, and this could also have contributed to maintenance of small genomes in birds.

Conclusion
BAC libraries from non-model species are powerful
resources for studying genome evolution in a comparative
context. Our results suggest a large number of BAC-scale
chromosomal rearrangements and deletions in chicken
relative to alligator and turtle, and fewer such rearrangements compared to emu. The study also suggests a substantial level of divergence at the level of sequences
between these species as detected in BLAST analyses. The
analysis shows many small deletions dispersed throughout the ancestral amniotes and reptile genomes contributed to the overall reduction in genome size in birds. Our
study has also flagged hundreds of easily locatable BAC
clones from two reptiles and a basal bird that are predicted to contain specific regions of the chicken genome
and which can now be mined for specific genes and verified as to chromosomal location via molecular methods.
Ultimately, sequencing of many of these BAC will provide
an even clearer picture of the sequence of events leading
to the streamlined genomes of birds at the nucleotide
level as well as the details of evolution of many gene
regions of interest to geneticists and developmental biologists.
