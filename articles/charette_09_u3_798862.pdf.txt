Abstract
Background: U3 snoRNA is a box C/D small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) involved in the processing
events that liberate 18S rRNA from the ribosomal RNA precursor (pre-rRNA). Although U3
snoRNA is present in all eukaryotic organisms, most investigations of it have focused on fungi
(particularly yeasts), animals and plants. Relatively little is known about U3 snoRNA and its gene(s)
in the phylogenetically broad assemblage of protists (mostly unicellular eukaryotes). In the
euglenozoon Euglena gracilis, a distant relative of the kinetoplastid protozoa, Southern analysis had
previously revealed at least 13 bands hybridizing with U3 snoRNA, suggesting the existence of
multiple copies of U3 snoRNA genes.
Results: Through screening of a λ genomic library and PCR amplification, we recovered 14 U3
snoRNA gene variants, defined by sequence heterogeneities that are mostly located in the U3 3'stem-loop domain. We identified three different genomic arrangements of Euglena U3 snoRNA
genes: i) stand-alone, ii) linked to tRNAArg genes, and iii) linked to a U5 snRNA gene. In arrangement
ii), the U3 snoRNA gene is positioned upstream of two identical tRNAArg genes that are
convergently transcribed relative to the U3 gene. This scenario is reminiscent of a U3 snoRNAtRNA gene linkage previously described in trypanosomatids. We document here twelve different
U3 snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene arrangements in Euglena; in each case, the U3 gene is linked to a
downstream and convergently oriented U5 gene, with the intergenic region differing in length and
sequence among the variants.
Conclusion: The multiple U3 snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene linkages, which cluster into distinct
families based on sequence similarities within the intergenic spacer, presumably arose by genome,
chromosome, and/or locus duplications. We discuss possible reasons for the existence of the
unusually large number of U3 snoRNA genes in the Euglena genome. Variability in the signal
intensities of the multiple Southern hybridization bands raises the possibility that Euglena contains
a naturally aneuploid chromosome complement.

Background
Euglena gracilis is a free-living protist, distantly related to
kinetoplastid protozoons [1], and whose RNA molecular
biology displays a number of peculiar features. One example is the cytoplasmic ribosome of Euglena and the genes
encoding its constituent rRNAs. Typically in eukaryotes,
hundreds to thousands of copies of the rRNA operon are
tandemly encoded on linear chromosomes. In Euglena, a
single copy of the rRNA operon is carried on an 11-kbp
extrachromosomal circular plasmid that is present in high
copy number (estimates range between 800 and 4000 per
cell) and that replicates autonomously, with few if any
integrated chromosomal rRNA genes [2-5]. Furthermore,
a number of additional, novel internal transcribed spacer
sequences in the Euglena 28S rDNA are excised during prerRNA processing [6]. Consequently, the mature LSU
rRNA, which typically consists of two stable species (5.8S
plus 28S rRNA), is composed of 14 rRNA pieces (5.8S plus
13 28S 'fragments') in Euglena [7]. A similar, but less
extensive pre-rRNA processing in trypanosomes yields a
seven-fragment LSU rRNA [8-10]. Despite the extreme
fragmentation of the Euglena LSU rRNA, the individual
pieces are able to associate in trans [11] to form functional
ribosomes [12-15]. Furthermore, ongoing mapping of
O2'-methylribose and pseudouridine positions (M.N.
Schnare & M.W. Gray, unpublished) suggests that the constituent LSU rRNA is the most highly modified rRNA of
any organism examined to date [16].
The small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) constitute a very
large family of small RNAs present in the nucleolus as
ribonucleoprotein complexes. Most snoRNAs guide the
site-specific formation of O2'-methylribose or pseudouridine modifications in rRNAs and snRNAs [17-19]. Some
of the processing and cleavage events required for the liberation of mature rRNAs from the pre-rRNA transcript are
mediated by a subset of snoRNAs. One such processing
snoRNA, the box C/D snoRNA U3, was the first snoRNA
identified [20] and has since become the most extensively
studied.
U3 snoRNA consists of 5'- and 3'-domains separated by a
hinge region [21]. The 5'-domain contains sequence elements that are complementary to regions of the 5'-external transcribed spacer (ETS) of the pre-rRNA, as well as to
the 5'-end of the 18S rRNA [22-26]. Base-pairing interactions between the pre-rRNA and its complementary
regions in U3 snoRNA guide, by a complex and incompletely understood mechanism that includes the participation of U14 [27,28] and U17/snR30 [29-31] snoRNAs,
the multiple sequence-specific pre-rRNA cleavage events
that eventually liberate the mature 5'-end of the 18S rRNA
[22-26,32]. Additional base-pairing interactions occur
between the central hinge region of U3 snoRNA and the
5'-ETS of the pre-rRNA [5,33-35]. These multiple base-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/528

pairing interactions may also confer on U3 snoRNA a
chaperone-like activity in the co-transcriptional folding of
the 18S rRNA [25]. The 3'-domain of U3 snoRNA, important in protein binding and RNA stability, contains box C/
D sequence elements characteristic of this snoRNA family
[21,24].
U3 snoRNA associates with at least 43 proteins (the four
box C/D snoRNA proteins plus 25 U-three-associated proteins (Utps) and 14 others) to form a large ribonucleoprotein complex termed the SSU processome [21,36]. In
'Miller chromatin spreads' of actively transcribed rRNA
genes visualized by electron microscopy, this massive 80S
complex of ~2.2 MDa corresponds to the terminal knobs
observed on the 5'-ends of growing pre-rRNA 'Christmas
trees' [36,37].
Information about the many players, such as U3 snoRNA
and its protein components, and the multiple, intricate
and highly coordinated events in rRNA processing and
ribosome biogenesis, has accumulated largely from studies in the phylogenetically narrow grouping of animals
and yeasts. Therefore, our current understanding of ribosome biogenesis may not be truly representative of the
many potentially different strategies used by phylogenetically disparate organisms. For this reason, the idiosyncratic features of RNA biology in E. gracilis coupled with
its key phylogenetic placement make this organism a
potentially informative alternative model system for the
study of rRNA maturation, ribosome biogenesis and the
many RNA and protein components that participate in
this highly complex process.
Euglena U3 snoRNA [38] is a 180-nt species exhibiting the
sequence motifs typical of U3 snoRNAs [21]. While considerably smaller than its homologues in yeast and vertebrates (333 nt, S. cerevisiae [21]; 217 nt, human [39]),
Euglena U3 snoRNA is comparable in size to its trypanosomatid relatives (143 nt, T. brucei [40]). Unexpectedly,
whereas U3 snoRNA is encoded by a single-copy gene in
all examined trypanosome species [40-42], heterogeneities observed in RNA sequencing along with multiple
hybridizing bands in Southern analysis [38] strongly suggested that U3 snoRNA is a multi-copy gene in the Euglena
genome. In trypanosomatids, the genomic neighborhood
of the U3 snoRNA locus is particularly rich in genes for
other small RNAs, such as tRNAs and snRNAs [41-43].
Furthermore, in these organisms, the expression of the U3
snoRNA gene is dependent upon the presence of a closely
linked, upstream and divergently oriented tRNA gene
[44,45]. Thus, we reasoned that an exploration of the
genomic contexts of the Euglena U3 snoRNA gene loci
would uncover both commonalities and differences with
respect to the trypanosomatid scenario. In addition,
insights might be gained both into the evolution of U3

snoRNA and the functional architecture of the Euglena
genome.

(Fig. 2A-C): i) a stand-alone gene, ii) linkage to tRNA
genes, and iii) linkage to a U5 snRNA gene.

Here, we describe the results of a comprehensive analysis
of E. gracilis U3 snoRNA genes and their genomic contexts. We confirm that unlike the trypanosomatid case,
where U3 snoRNA is a single-copy gene, the Euglena U3
snoRNA is encoded by a multigene family comprising at
least 14 members. As in trypanosomes, most Euglena U3
snoRNA genes are located near genes for other small
RNAs, such as tRNAs and U5 snRNA. However, notable
differences between the Euglena and the trypanosomatid
arrangements are evident, the evolutionary and functional
implications of which are considered here.

A solitary U3 snoRNA gene arrangement was identified in
a large 12-kbp genomic fragment (Fig. 2A). No additional,
recognizable genes or sequence elements were found by
BLASTn analysis.

Results
Multiple Southern hybridizing bands imply that the gene
encoding U3 snoRNA is multi-copy in the Euglena genome
A complex and reproducible pattern of multiple hybridizing bands is produced in Southern hybridization experiments with a Euglena U3 snoRNA gene probe (Fig. 1A),
implying that this gene is present in multiple copies in the
Euglena genome. The resulting hybridization patterns
show at least 13 hybridizing EcoR1, BamH1 or EcoR1/
BamH1 fragments, ranging in size from ~1.8 to ~38.5 kbp.

Unexpectedly, the multiple U3-hybridizing fragments
showed reproducible differences in signal intensity (Fig.
1B), with this apparent non-stoichiometry being confirmed by densitometric analysis. Comparison within
each sample lane revealed a number of bands with very
similar signal intensities, including the 2.5-, 3.1-, and 9.2kbp bands (signal intensities 1425, 1479, and 2138,
respectively; Fig. 1B). Bands at 1.8, 5.5, and 12.2 kbp also
displayed very similar signal intensities (3890, 4431, and
4202, respectively). On the other hand, differences in relative signal intensity within a sample lane are clearly illustrated by comparison of the 1.7-, 1.8- and 2.2-kbp bands,
whose signal intensities were 1.9×, 2.7×, and 3.9× that of
the 2.5-kbp band (2743, 3890 and 5502, respectively,
vs.1425). Similar results have been obtained with other
hybridization probes (see below). The reproducibility of
these results suggests that they are not attributable to
incomplete restriction endonuclease digestion of the DNA
or to uneven transfer of restriction fragments from gel to
membrane prior to hybridization.
Three different U3 snoRNA gene arrangements identified
in a library of Euglena genomic DNA
To investigate further the genomic organization of Euglena
U3 snoRNA, we screened a λ library of Euglena genomic
DNA using a Euglena U3 snoRNA gene probe, retrieving
several U3-hybridizing λ clones. Sequence walking in conjunction with BLASTn analysis revealed four unique U3
snoRNA gene variants in three different genomic contexts

A U3-hybridizing λ clone was found to encode a U3
snoRNA gene neighbored downstream by two identical
arginine tRNA genes, both encoded in the opposite transcriptional orientation relative to the U3 snoRNA gene
(Fig. 2B). The coding regions of the U3 snoRNA gene and
first tRNAArg gene are separated by 209 bp, whereas the
two tRNAArg genes are 70 bp apart. No additional genes
were found by BLASTn analysis. This clone contains many
short simple-sequence elements, also identified in other λ
clones, such as homopolymer and dinucleotide repeats.
In addition, unusual repetitive sequence elements are
present, such as repeat sequences that are also present
within the introns of the Euglena γ-tubulin gene paralogs
[46]. The region upstream of the U3 snoRNA gene also
contains a Euglena microsatellite sequence, EgMS7 [47].
Finally, a 52-nt region, consisting of the 3'-end and putative transcription termination sequence of this particular
U3 snoRNA gene variant, has evidently been duplicated.
The resulting sequence consists of a full-length U3
snoRNA gene and transcription termination signal followed by the 3'-terminal 22-nt of the U3 snoRNA gene (nt
159 to 180) and a nearly identical copy of the transcription termination signal.
The identified tRNAArg gene is unremarkable in sequence
and secondary structure (Fig. 3A). It adopts a conventional clover-leaf secondary structure, displays the
expected D and TΨC loops, and possesses a small loop in
the variable region.
Two different U3-hybridizing λ clones were identified in
which the U3 snoRNA gene is neighbored downstream by
a convergently oriented U5 snRNA gene (Fig. 2C1/C2).
No additional genes were detected. While the U3 snoRNA
and U5 snRNA sequences in the two clones are highly
similar, the size (255 and 160 bp) and sequence of the U3
snoRNA-U5 snRNA intergenic spacers are very different
(see below). Furthermore, the sequence of the regions
downstream of the U5 snRNA genes is equally dissimilar.
As with the other λ clones, the two U3-U5 genomic inserts
contain many short repetitive sequence elements and
stretches of extreme nucleotide bias (e.g., hompolymeric
stretches of up to 12 C or G residues).
As with most protist U snRNAs, the Euglena U5 snRNA
gene sequence was previously unknown. Its nucleotide
sequence and secondary structure (Fig. 3B) display fea-

(A) Euglena DNA was digested with BamH1 (B), EcoR1 (E) or with both (B/E) endonucleases, two restriction enzymes that do not have recognition sequences within the Euglena U3 snoRNA gene. Restriction
fragments were resolved by electrophoresis prior to Southern transfer and hybridization with a Euglena U3 snoRNA probe, all
as described in Methods. The exact number of hybridizing fragments in the 10 to 38.5 kbp size range is difficult to determine
owing to the limited resolution of this size range on standard agarose gels. (MW; a mixture of Invitrogen™ λ DNA/HindIII, 1
Kb Plus and λ DNA/High Molecular Weight Markers) (B) Densitometric analysis confirms that the multiple hybridizing bands
display unequal hybridization signal intensities. Euglena DNA, digested with EcoR1 (E), was resolved by electrophoresis in a
0.7% agarose/1× TAE gel prior to Southern transfer and hybridization. The results of densitometric analysis using ImageJ [97]
are shown to the right of the sample lane, with peak areas corresponding to the relative signal intensities of the labeled bands.
For the indicated bands, the first number gives the area under the peak while the second number represents signal intensity
normalized to that of the 2.5-kbp band (signal intensity 1425, the lowest in the lane).

tures present in U5 snRNAs from other organisms. The
Euglena U5 snRNA is 98 nt in length, the position of its 5'end inferred by comparison with other U5 snRNA
sequences. The precise 3'-end was determined by 3' RACE
analysis and by chemical sequencing of the RNA (data not
shown). The secondary structure consists, in its 5'-region,
of a stem-loop region punctuated by a central bulge. The
11-nt terminal loop I contains the invariant 9-nt sequence
(5'-GCCUUUUAC-3') known to interact with exon
sequences at the 5'- and 3'-splice sites [48]. The 3'-region
contains a conventional Sm binding site. Notably, a small
stem-loop structure, typically present near the 3'-end of
U5 snRNAs, is not found in the Euglena U5 snRNA.
Southern analysis suggests that Euglena U3 snoRNA genes
are frequently linked to U5 snRNA genes
Although intensive screening of the Euglena λ genomic
library identified only four different U3 snoRNA genes in
three distinct genomic contexts, Southern analysis of
Euglena genomic DNA revealed at least 13 U3-hybridizing
bands. Because we could not account for many U3
snoRNA genes (and their genomic arrangements), South-

ern analysis was performed to determine whether additional variants of the linkages identified in the λ genomic
fragments are present in the Euglena genome.
Southern analysis of Euglena genomic DNA using a
tRNAArg gene probe identified multiple hybridizing bands
(12 in BamHI/EcoRI, ranging in size from 2.1 kbp to 16
kbp; Fig. 4A), suggesting that the tRNAArg gene is also
multi-copy in the Euglena genome. This result was not
unexpected, considering that tRNA genes frequently constitute large, multigene families.
A single band, co-hybridizing with the U3 and tRNAArg
probes (indicated by the asterisks in Fig. 4), is suggestive
of a single U3-tRNAArg gene linkage in the Euglena
genome. Other members of the tRNAArg gene family do
not appear to be similarly linked to U3 snoRNA genes.
The authenticity of the apparent U3-tRNAArg co-hybridization was further substantiated by the observation that a
probe derived from the region upstream of the U3 gene in
the U3-tRNAArg λ clone (Fig. 2B) predominantly labeled

indicated. Solid diamonds denote simple sequence repeats that precluded effective primer design for additional primer walking.
Open diamonds with letters denote homopolymer runs (A, C or G) that prematurely terminated sequencing. Due to the technical challenges posed by the many repetitive sequence elements, the λ U3-Solitary and λ U3-tRNAArg clones were not

the band that hybridized with both the U3 and tRNAArg
probes (•, Fig. 4A). This probe also contains the Euglena
microsatellite sequence [47] mentioned above, which
likely explains the relatively high level of background
hybridization seen in this particular case.
Southern analysis of Euglena genomic DNA with a U5
gene probe identified ~14 hybridizing fragments, ranging

in size from 0.9 kbp to 13 kbp. (Fig. 4B). Thus, U5 snRNA
is also encoded by multiple genes in the Euglena genome.
Comparison of the U5 Southern hybridization result with
the U3 one revealed at least eight co-migrating hybridization bands (asterisks, Fig. 4B). Thus, the majority of U5
snRNA genes, though not all, appeared to be linked to U3
snoRNA genes in the Euglena genome.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:528

In addition, as observed with the U3-hybridizing bands,
the U5-hybridizing bands also showed reproducible differences in hybridization intensity. Furthermore, the relative signal intensities within the U5 pattern co-vary with
those within the U3 pattern.
Genomic PCR confirms multiple U3 snoRNA-U5 snRNA
gene linkages in the Euglena genome
To examine putative U3-U5 gene linkages in detail, we
used a genomic PCR strategy to amplify, clone and
sequence U3-U5 intergenic spacers (IGS) as well as the
flanking U3 and U5 genes. As expected from the sequence
of the two U3-U5 λ clones and from the results of Southern analysis, multiple PCR products were obtained (Fig.
5A). To ensure complete coverage of all U3-U5 linkages, a
total of 122 clones, from five different PCR-generated
libraries, were sequenced and analyzed, with multiple
clones of each linkage being identified. Thus, nucleotide
heterogeneities between the different U3-U5 linkages are
considered legitimate and not attributable to Taq-induced
errors or to PCR-mediated recombination [49-51].

The cloned U3-U5 PCR products ranged in size from 422
to 541 bp. Detailed sequence analysis identified a total of
12 unique U3-U5 linkages. Comparison of the unique
sequences revealed that the multiple U3 snoRNA
sequences are highly similar, as are the multiple U5
snRNA sequences, the members of each group displaying
only limited sequence heterogeneities (Fig. 5B). However,
substantial variability is seen in the size and sequence of
the IGS separating the U3 and U5 genes. Despite this variability, regions of sequence similarity within the IGS suggest that the gene linkages may be related (e.g., compare
the IGS in A1a and A1b, Fig. 5B). Thus, the 12 unique U3
snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene linkages appear to form five
families that can be further divided into sub-families (Fig.
5B).
U3-U5 family A, representing the linkage having the longest IGS sequence, comprises four members. Based on
sequence similarity, the members of this family can be
divided into two sub-families, A1 and A2, with the A1
subfamily being further divided into A1a, A1b and A1c.
Members of the A family show the highest level of identity, exhibiting only minor nucleotide changes and a 17nt indel in the IGS sequence. The A1a PCR linkage (Fig.
5B) corresponds to the U3-U5 linkage identified in the λ
genomic clone C1 (Fig. 2).
The B-linkage family contains two members, B1 and B2.
The IGS sequences of the two linkages show the lowest
level of sequence identity of any of the linkage families.
The relatedness of the members of the B-linkage family is
based on the presence of short regions of sequence identity, which are punctuated by regions of nucleotide diver-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/528

gence. Short regions of apparent sequence similarity at
both ends of the IGSs, immediately downstream of the 3'ends of the U3 and U5 genes, may correspond to transcription termination signals, in which case these regions
do not actually contribute to linkage family relatedness.
The B1 PCR linkage (Fig. 5B) corresponds to the U3-U5
linkage identified in the λ genomic clone C2 (Fig. 2).
The C-, D-, and E-linkage families each contain two members, C1 and C2, D1 and D2, and E1 and E2. Each linkage
family exhibits regions of sequence similarity interrupted
by regions of nucleotide difference and by indels. Overall,
the level of sequence identity in the members of the C, D
and E linkage families is intermediate between that of the
highly similar A family and the very divergent B family.
Some of the U3-U5 linkages were confirmed by Southern
hybridization analysis (Fig. 4C).
A similar genomic PCR approach was used to search for
other arrangements of linked U3-U5 genes, such as divergently (head-to-head) and similarly (tail-to-head) oriented genes. The possible presence of tandem U3 snoRNA
genes was also investigated. No linkages of these types
were found.
A revised secondary structure model for Euglena U3
snoRNA
The nucleotide heterogeneities identified in the U3 variants prompted a re-assessment of the likely secondary
structure of Euglena U3 snoRNA. A recent phylogenetic
comparison of U3 sequences from representative taxa [21]
has uncovered additional conserved sequence elements
and RNA motifs that are also present in the Euglena U3
snoRNA (Fig. 6). An alignment of known U3 snoRNA
sequences from representative organisms is shown in
Additional file 1. Furthermore, information from mutational studies [21,33] and from in vivo chemical and enzymatic structure-probing experiments [24,52] has resulted
in significant revision of the proposed general secondary
structure of U3 snoRNA. Accordingly, a revised conserved
sequence element and secondary structure model for
Euglena U3 snoRNA is presented here (Fig. 6).

Sequence elements in the 5' region of U3 are known to
interact with the 5' external transcribed spacer (5'-ETS) of
the pre-rRNA and with the 5' region of the 18S rRNA. The
first such element in U3 snoRNA is the GAC box, followed
by the A' box and then the A box [21]. In the identified
Euglena U3 genes, a single nucleotide heterogeneity has
been mapped to this region. The heterogeneity, an A-to-G
transition, is located downstream of the A box sequence.
The central hinge region of the Euglena U3 snoRNA contains a small stem-loop structure consisting of a 3-bp stem
with a 5-nt loop. As in other organisms [22], potential

lane to aid in the identification of hybridizing band(s).

yields multiple amplification products ranging in size from ~425 to ~550 bp. (B) Alignment of PCR products demonstrates high
sequence conservation of the U3 snoRNA and U5 snRNA genes, both within a linkage family and between linkage families.
Numbers at the ends of the alignments indicate the percent sequence identity (% ID) among family members within the IGS,
excluding the U3 and U5 coding sequences and putative transcription termination signals. Family members that are identical
within the IGS may nevertheless display nucleotide heterogeneities within the flanking U3 or U5 genes. The alignment begins at
nt 10 of the U3 snoRNA gene, owing to the location of the PCR primer.

base-pairing interactions may occur between the Euglena
U3 hinge domain (both the 5' and 3' regions) and the 5'
external transcribed spacer (5' ETS) of the pre-rRNA [5]. In
the multiple Euglena U3 genes, a sequence heterogeneity
is located in the 3' hinge region. This A-to-C transversion
is located immediately downstream of the small stemloop structure.
The 3'-terminal domain of the Euglena U3 snoRNA contains conserved sequence elements, boxes C', B, C and D,

known to interact with RNA-binding proteins [53,54].
This domain consists of an extended stem-loop structure
punctuated by a number of bulge-loop elements. In our
revised model, box C' and box D elements are juxtaposed
in the secondary structure context, as are box B and box C
elements. The box elements are mainly single-stranded,
corresponding to small bulge-loop structures; however,
some regions may form short base-pairing interactions.
More importantly, alternative base-pairing interactions in
the 3'-terminal domain allow for the formation of two

Revised 6
Figure secondary structure model of the Euglena U3 snoRNA
Revised secondary structure model of the Euglena U3 snoRNA. In this proposed model, the 5'-trimethylguanosine cap
(5'-TMG cap) is indicated in orange, the phylogenetically conserved and functionally essential box GAC, A', A, C', B, C, and D
elements are shown in blue. Pseudouridine (Ψ) residues are indicated in green. Nucleotide heterogeneities identified in the
Euglena U3 snoRNA gene variants are denoted by the red circles. Nucleotides forming a K-turn motif are highlighted on a gray

kink-turn (K-turn) RNA motifs [54-56] within the juxtaposed box C'/D and B/C elements.
Nearly all of the sequence heterogeneities identified in the
multiple Euglena U3 snoRNA variants (12 of the 14) are
located in the 3'-extended stem-loop domain. Ten of the
12 sequence heterogeneities are transitions, vs. two transversions. The majority of nucleotide heterogeneities in
helical regions result in shifts from Watson-Crick basepairings (U-A and G-C) to non-canonical interactions
(three U•G, one G•U). Three heterogeneities occur in single-stranded regions, none of which is part of a singlestranded conserved box element. Two nucleotide heterogeneities, present in the same U3 snoRNA variant near the
terminal stem-loop structure, form compensatory base
changes (C-G to U-A) and thus maintain base-pairing
interactions. Two additional nucleotide heterogeneities
map to the terminal base pairs of short stem regions,
immediately adjacent to the opening or closing of bulgeloop structures. Since neither of these heterogeneities
maintains the terminal base-pairing interactions of the
stems, a slight expansion of the adjacent bulge-loop structures results. One of the two heterogeneities is located
within the box C' element, adjacent to the 5+2 motif of
the K-turn [55,56]. Only one heterogeneity, located in a
short stem region, disrupts a standard base-pairing interaction. In sum, the distribution of the 12 sequence heterogeneities identified in the 3'-extended stem-loop domain
of Euglena U3 snoRNA results in minimal changes to the
overall secondary structure of the region.

Discussion
In Euglenozoa, U3 snoRNA genes are frequently linked to
genes for other small RNAs
In one of three patterns of U3 snoRNA gene organization
identified here, a U3 snoRNA gene is linked to two identical, downstream and convergently oriented (relative to
the U3 snoRNA gene) tRNAArg genes in the Euglena
genome (Fig. 2B). Close linkage of U3 snoRNA and tRNA
genes has been found in a number of trypanosomatids,
members of the kinetoplastid protozoa, which are the
closest relatives of the euglenids. The most dramatic
example is in Leishmania tarentolae, where a 2.7-kbp
genomic region encodes the U3 snoRNA gene along with
genes for 10 tRNAs, U1 snRNA and 5S RNA (Fig. 7) [41].
Sequence for a portion of the corresponding region in L.
major (GenBank AQ843909) reveals the same gene content organized in the same manner. In both Leishmania
cases, the U3 snoRNA gene is neighbored by a single,
downstream, convergently oriented tRNAArg gene (possessing the same anticodon, UCG, as in the Euglena case).

In Trypanosoma brucei, the U3 snoRNA gene is neighbored
upstream by a divergently oriented tRNAArg gene (having
a different anticodon, ACG); no proximal genes are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/528

encoded downstream of the T. brucei U3 snoRNA gene
(Fig. 7) [42,57]. In Leptomonas collosoma, a divergently oriented tRNALys gene is also encoded upstream of the U3
snoRNA gene [43] (no sequence is available downstream). Similarly, an upstream, divergently oriented tRNALys gene neighbors the U3 snoRNA gene in both L.
tarentolae and L. major, in addition to the downstream,
convergently oriented tRNAArg gene noted above. In all of
these trypanosomatid cases, the IGS separating the U3
and tRNA genes is 71 to 106 bp in size, compared to 209
bp in the Euglena. In the phylogenetically unrelated ciliate
Tetrahymena thermophila, a U3 snoRNA gene is also neighbored by an upstream, identically oriented tRNALys gene.
However, in this case, the U3-tRNA IGS is nearly 500 bp
in size [58]. Evidently, close physical linkage of U3
snoRNA and tRNA genes is a widespread phenomenon
within the trypanosomatids, with similar linkages in
Euglena and in Tetrahymena.
The most striking observation to emerge from the present
study is the multiplicity of distinct U3 snoRNA genes and
gene arrangements in the Euglena genome, in stark contrast to what is seen in trypanosomatids [40-43]. In addition to the U3-tRNAArg linkage, we document here 12
distinct examples of U3 snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene linkage
in the Euglena genome. In all these examples, the U5
snRNA gene is located downstream and in the opposite
transcriptional orientation relative to the U3 snoRNA
gene (Fig. 2 and 5). To date, no linked U3-U5 genes have
been identified in other organisms. Furthermore, with the
exception of tRNA genes, U3 snoRNA genes have not been
found directly linked to other genes encoding small RNAs.
Genes specifying modification-guide box C/D and box H/
ACA snoRNAs are frequently clustered, including in
trypanosomatids [59,60] and in Euglena [61]. So far, however, U3 snoRNA genes have not been found linked to
modification-guide snoRNA genes in any eukaryote, and
this also appears to be the case in Euglena.
Influence of U3 snoRNA gene organization on U3 snoRNA
gene expression
The expression of U3 snoRNA genes in trypanosomatids
and other eukaryotes has been extensively studied. In all
instances examined, trypanosomatid [62], other protist
[58] and plant [63,64] U3 snoRNA genes are transcribed
by RNA polymerase III (RNAP III). Based on the sistergroup relationship between kinetoplastids and euglenids
[1], U3 snoRNA is similarly assumed to be synthesized by
RNAP III in Euglena, although this inference remains to be
confirmed experimentally. In all cases, U3 snoRNA genes
are transcribed from their own promoter and U3 transcripts do not appear to be part of larger, polycistronic
transcripts.

Figure 7
Organization of U3 snoRNA genes within Euglenozoa
Organization of U3 snoRNA genes within Euglenozoa. The U3 snoRNA genes are shown in red, U5 snRNA gene in
green, tRNA genes in blue and all other genes are shown in black. Euglena gracilis A, B and C correspond to the arrangements
depicted in Fig. 2. Numbers shown between the various genes correspond to the sizes of the intergenic spacers separating the
two genes. Numbers on the right hand of the figure indicate the size (bp) of the respective genomic region. Note that this figure is not drawn to scale. Organisms represented include Euglena gracilis (this study), Leishmania tarentolae [GenBank:L20948],
Trypanosoma brucei [GenBank:X57047] and Leptomonas collosoma [GenBank:L32919].

In trypanosomatids, the expression of U3 snoRNA is
dependent on the linked, upstream, divergently oriented
tRNA gene. Two extragenic regulatory elements (A and B
boxes) required for trypanosome U3 snoRNA gene expression [44] correspond to the tRNA D and TΨC loops,
which are known to serve generally as intragenic RNAP III
promoter elements for tRNA genes. Furthermore, the
spacing of the A and B boxes relative to each other and to
the U3 snoRNA gene is critical. As noted above, the distance between the upstream tRNA gene and the U3
snoRNA gene varies within a narrow range (93-105 bp) in
trypanosomatids (Fig. 7). Transcription factor TFIIIC is
known to bind to the B box element of the tRNA gene,
whereupon it recruits transcription factor TFIIIB, which in

turn sequesters RNAP III for transcription initiation
[65,66] In yeast, transcription of tRNA genes by RNAP III
prevents nucleosome assembly in the immediate vicinity
of these genes, and concomitant nucleosome-mediated
repression [67]. Thus, the binding of TFIIIC to the B box
is postulated to play an indirect role, through chromatin
remodeling, in the expression of trypanosomatid tRNAlinked U3 snoRNA genes [44,62]. Whether the downstream tRNAArg genes play a similar role in U3 snoRNA
transcription in Euglena remains to be determined. The
Euglena U3 snoRNA-tRNA genes are not as closely linked
(209 bp IGS) as they are in trypanosomatids (93-105 bp
IGS). However, the presence of two tRNAArg genes in the
Euglena case might result in more efficient recruitment of

Page 12 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:528

TFIIIC to this site and a parallel chromatin remodeling
effect over a larger region. The fact remains that most U3
snoRNA genes in Euglena are evidently not linked to tRNA
genes, so any parallel with U3 snoRNA gene expression in
trypanosomatids must necessarily be limited.
Gene duplication in the generation of multiple U3
snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene linkages in Euglena
The 12 different U3 snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene linkages
described here cluster into five discrete families, based on
sequence conservation within the IGS (Fig. 5B). In the 'A'
family, three linkage variants form a sub-family (A1a-A1c)
while a fourth linkage is the sole member of the second
sub-family (A2). Linkage families B, C, D, and E contain
two U3 snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene linkages each. No
regions of sequence conservation common to all 12 linkage variants are evident within the IGS.

At this point, the origin and generation of the multiple U3
snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene linkages remains a matter of
conjecture. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the current arrangement arose via duplication of one or a few
ancestral U3 snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene linkages. The pathway of formation and fixation of the ancestral U3-U5 gene
linkage(s) is unclear, but the linkage per se presumably
was generated by random gene shuffling and perhaps
maintained by a favorable effect on gene expression. Multiple rounds of locus, chromosome and/or genome duplication followed by sequence divergence likely then
created the observed linkage families and sub-families.
In support of this proposal, accumulating evidence from
sequence analysis indicates that parts of the Euglena
genome are highly repeated and that the genome may be
evolutionarily plastic. An arrangement similar to the U3U5 linkage case has been described for the Euglena spliced
leader RNA (SL RNA) gene, which is linked to a 5S rRNA
gene [68]. As with the U5 snRNA gene, some SL RNA
genes are dispersed throughout the genome; however, the
majority are linked to an identically oriented 5S rRNA
gene. The linkage is encoded within a tandemly repeated
0.6-kbp unit, and it is estimated that up to 300 SL RNA-5S
rRNA gene linkages are present in the Euglena genome. In
the absence of large-scale linkage data, we do not know
whether the U3 snoRNA-U5 snRNA gene linkages
described here might be similarly present in the Euglena
genome as repeated arrays, although PCR amplification
results would seem to rule out any closely linked U3-U5
units.
Limited information on gene copy number for other
Euglena snRNAs gives a contrasting picture. Southern
hybridization analysis of Euglena DNA with a Euglena U1
snRNA [69] gene probe yields a single hybridizing band,
a result substantiated by PCR amplification and the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/528

sequencing of several independent Euglena U1 snRNA
clones, which revealed no nucleotide heterogeneities
(unpublished results). In contrast, when 3' RACE-based
PCR amplification was used to obtain the sequence of the
Euglena U4 snRNA [70], at least four sequence variants
were obtained (unpublished results). Additional evidence
for the repetitive nature of portions of the Euglena genome
has come from studies of Euglena modification-guide
(box C/D and box H/ACA) snoRNAs, where many cases of
multi-copy, linked snoRNA genes have been found
[16,61]. Similarly, on-going bioinformatic screens of
Euglena cDNAs have revealed multiple allelic variants of
typically single-copy ribosomal protein genes (unpublished results). Thus, it appears that many, though not all,
genes are multi-copy in the genome of Euglena.
Are U3 snoRNA genes spatially organized in the nucleus?
A recent model for the spatial organization of RNAP IIItranscribed genes in the nucleus may be relevant to the
organization and expression of U3 snoRNA genes in
Euglena, trypanosomatids and some other organisms. This
model stems from in situ hybridization studies suggesting
that the 274 tRNA genes of yeast, although dispersed
throughout the linear map of the genome, are localized to
the nucleolus [71,72]. This situation is analogous to the
three-dimensional co-localization of the multiple rDNA
genes in the nucleolus. Accordingly, it has been proposed
that chromosomal loci encoding tRNA genes also associate in three-dimensional space within the nucleus. Such
an arrangement could conceivably lead to the formation
of a tRNA transcription and processing center enriched in
RNAP III, transcription, and processing factors [71,73].
Experimental evidence suggests that U3 snoRNA genes in
human cells may associate in three-dimensional space
with coiled bodies in the nucleus [39,74]. Thus, the threedimensional clustering of genes transcribed by RNAP III
could promote the formation of 'transcription territories'
[75] that function to more efficiently recruit transcription
complexes to the region, thereby maintaining a high level
of gene expression. Although it is not known whether this
scenario applies to Euglena U3 snoRNA genes, the suggestion is a plausible one considering that Euglena U3
snoRNA genes are likely transcribed by RNAP III and for
the most part are linked either to tRNA genes or to the
RNAP III-transcribed U5 snRNA gene.
Why so many U3 snoRNA genes in the Euglena genome?
The Euglena genome encodes at least 14 different U3
snoRNA genes. While U3 snoRNA is an essential gene, it
is unclear why the Euglena genome would encode so many
copies, considering that the U3 snoRNA gene is singlecopy in trypanosomatid protozoa [40-43]. At least part of
the explanation for this evident expansion of U3 snoRNA
genes in Euglena may have to do with the unusual features
of its rRNA genes and mature rRNA species.

Page 13 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:528

In a Euglena cell, a single unit of linked rRNA genes is
encoded on each of ~1000-4000 copies of an extrachromosomal plasmid-like DNA species [2-5], in contrast to
the arrangement of chromosomally integrated tandem
rDNA arrays in most other eukaryotes. Electron micrographs show an unusual, extensively segmented nucleolar
structure in Euglena, which might reflect the organization
of the individual plasmid-like rDNA elements into a
number of distinct, higher order clusters within the
nucleus. (In Entamoeba sp., the rDNA is similarly encoded
on an extrachromosomal DNA element that is able to
induce formation of a dispersed nucleolar structure
located at the nuclear periphery [76].) If U3 snoRNA
genes are also physically and functionally localized at or
near the nucleolus, the additional numbers of U3 snoRNA
genes seen in Euglena may be required to accommodate an
atypical nucleolar organization of its rDNA genes, thereby
more efficiently coordinating U3 snoRNA expression and
function with rRNA synthesis and processing.
Another consideration is that, relative to the situation in a
typical eukaryote, many additional spacer sequences are
removed during pre-rRNA processing in Euglena, resulting
in a naturally and highly fragmented 28S rRNA equivalent
[6,7]. One suggestion is that Euglena U3 snoRNA might
participate in these additional pre-rRNA processing events
[38]. Alternatively, the additional processing steps might
result in the production of a relatively higher proportion
of defective ribosomes than in other eukaryotes, in which
case a relatively larger number of pre-rRNA transcripts
would presumably need to be processed in order to maintain an adequate number of functional ribosomes in the
cell. This requirement would in turn necessitate a greater
number of U3 snoRNA molecules, a requirement that presumably could be achieved by encoding and expressing an
expanded number of U3 snoRNA genes.
A problem with the above suggestions is that trypanosomatid LSU rRNAs are also fragmented, although not as
extensively as those in Euglena [8-10]. Nevertheless, as
noted above, the U3 snoRNA gene is single copy in
trypanosomatid genomes [40-43]. Thus, it appears
unlikely that the multi-copy nature of Euglena U3 snoRNA
genes could be a direct consequence of the particularities
of rRNA processing in Euglena.
U3 snoRNA genes and the Euglena genome
Considering the long history of Euglena gracilis as a 'laboratory workhorse', surprisingly little is known about its
genome. The varying intensities of U3 snoRNA-hybridizing bands in Southern blots of Euglena DNA suggests that
the actual number of U3 snoRNA genes may be substantially higher than the 14 we have documented here. Technical considerations in restriction endonuclease
digestion, transfer of restriction fragments and subse-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/528

quent hybridization have been eliminated as possible
sources of artifact contributing to hybridization variability, based on the reproducibility of the results under different experimental conditions.
Aneuploidy, in which a cell contains different numbers of
one or more chromosomes, appears to be the most likely
explanation for the varying intensities of hybridizing
bands. In many organisms, aneuploidy is associated with
genome instability, as in human Trisomy-21 (Down's syndrome) and many cancers. However, aneuploidy has been
postulated to occur normally in a number of protists [77]
and in fungi [77-79], although in these cases it does not
appear to result in genome instability.
Aneuploidy has been reported in a number of trypanosomatids, including Trypanosoma cruzi [77,80-83] and
Leishmania [84]. In such cases, results similar to those presented here have been obtained. In pulsed field gel electrophoretic analysis of T. cruzi DNA, the ethidium
bromide staining intensities of different chromosomal
bands varies within single samples. Furthermore, DNAcontent variability of up to 70% has been observed in cells
derived from a single clone. There is as yet no direct evidence for aneuploidy in Euglena; however, the demonstrated occurrence of aneuploidy in trypanosomatids, in
conjunction with the results presented here, makes aneuploidy a distinct possibility in Euglena.

Conclusion
The comprehensive analysis reported here has revealed
multiple U3 snoRNA genes in the protist Euglena gracilis,
in three distinct genomic arrangements: i) stand-alone, ii)
linked to two tandem, identical tRNAArg genes, and iii)
linked to a U5 snRNA gene. The multiple U3 snoRNA-U5
snRNA gene linkages, which cluster into distinct families
based on sequence similarities within the intergenic
spacer, presumably arose by genome, chromosome, and/
or locus duplications. We suggest that the evident expansion of U3 snoRNA genes in Euglena, compared to its kinetoplastid distant relatives, may have to do with the
unusual features of Euglena rRNA genes and mature rRNA
species and/or a highly recombinogenic genome. In view
of the variability in the signal intensities of the multiple
bands consistently observed in our Southern hybridization experiments, we further raise the possibility that
Euglena contains a naturally aneuploid chromosome
complement.

Methods
Extraction of total DNA from Euglena gracilis
A streptomycin-bleached, aplastidic variant of Euglena gracilis [2], derived from the UCLA variety of E. gracilis strain
Z, was grown in 1-liter cultures of medium [85] at room
temperature with gentle agitation. The medium was mod-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:528

ified by addition of ethanol to 30 mM as a carbon source
[2], CoCl2 (1.3 mg/l) and Na2MoO4 (0.2 mg/l) in place of
Co(NO3)2 and H2MoO4, respectively, and adjusted to pH
6.5 with phosphoric acid [86]. Cultures were harvested at
mid- to late-log phase (after 4-5 days of growth), at an
OD600 between 0.8 and 1.0.
Total Euglena DNA was prepared using a modified detergent/chloroform/phenol extraction procedure. Euglena
cultures, held on ice for 30 min, were centrifuged at 3,520
g for 20 min at 4°C. The cells were subsequently washed
in a total of 150 ml cold Extraction Wash Buffer (EWB =
25 mM EDTA-Tris (pH 8.5): an EDTA solution titrated to
pH 8.5 with solid Tris base), pooled, recovered by centrifugation at 3,520 g for 10 min and resuspended to a final
volume of 10 ml with room temperature EWB.
Cells were lysed by the addition of 2.5 ml 25% SDS. The
solution was gently mixed until homogeneous, after
which the lysate volume was adjusted to 25 ml with room
temperature EWB. To the lysate, 4 ml 8 M sodium perchlorate was added and the solution was gently mixed to
homogeneity. Nucleic acids were extracted twice with
chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with
an equal volume of room temperature 2-propanol. Highmolecular-weight DNA was preferentially recovered by
spooling onto a glass rod, then washed with 80% ethanol,
briefly dried and dissolved in 10 ml TE (10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.6), 0.1 mM EDTA). Once re-dissolved, the DNA
was further deproteinized by phenol-cresol extraction
until no material was visible at the interface. The DNA was
precipitated from the aqueous phase with ethanol,
washed, briefly dried and dissolved in 1.0 ml TE.
Contaminating RNA in the DNA preparation was
removed by RNase treatment. DNA was preferentially
recovered by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation
[87], which involved adjusting the solution to final concentrations of 0.5 M NaCl and 10% PEG and incubating
on ice for 30 min. The PEG-precipitated DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 11,180 g for 15 min at 4°C. The
DNA was washed twice with 80% ethanol, briefly dried
and redissolved in TE. Residual PEG was removed by additional phenol extractions and ethanol precipitations.
DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction
PCR amplifications (50 μl reactions) consisted of 200 μM
of each dNTP, 1× ThermoPol buffer (New England
BioLabs), 2.5 U Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase, 20
pmol each oligonucleotide primer [see Additional file 2]
and 100-500 ng total Euglena DNA. In certain cases,
amplifications were improved by the use of sheared
genomic DNA (50 passes through a 29-gauge syringe).
Thermal cycling conditions consisted of 96°C for 5 min
followed by 35 cycles of i) 95°C for 40 sec, ii) 55°C for 40

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/528

sec and iii) 72°C for 50 sec with a final extension at 72°C
for 7 min. PCR parameters for products intended for cloning in the TOPO TA Cloning® system (Invitrogen™) consisted of 30 amplification cycles and a final extension at
72°C for 30 min, as recommended by the manufacturer.
Purification of DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis
Small DNA fragments (<1 kbp) were resolved by electrophoresis in 1-2.5% (w/v) low-melting-point (LMP) agarose gels containing 1× TAE (100 mM Tris, 0.1 mM
Na2•EDTA, titrated to pH 8.0 with glacial acetic acid). Gel
slices (0.4-0.55 g) were transferred to 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The slices were crushed then melted by incubation at 65°C for 30 min. The melted gel was incubated
with 0.5 vol. phenol-cresol, pre-warmed at 65°C, and
incubated for 5 min at 65°C with frequent vigorous agitation. The supernatant was recovered by centrifugation and
extracted twice more with phenol. After the addition of
0.1 vol. 3 M NaOAc, the supernatant was extracted four
additional times with phenol at room temperature, or
until no material was visible at the interface. DNA was
precipitated with ethanol (facilitated by the addition of 5
μl 0.25% linear polyacrylamide carrier [88]), recovered by
centrifugation, washed in 75% ethanol, dried and redissolved in 5-10 μl TE.
Cloning of PCR products, plasmid minipreps and sequence
analysis
When necessary, PCR products were purified by gel electrophoresis using the LMP agarose/hot phenol method, or
with the Sephaglas™ BandPrep kit (Amersham Biosciences), and cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning® kit
(Invitrogen™). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the
QIAprep® Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced inhouse. Large insert clones were sequenced by primer walking [see Additional file 2]. Sequence chromatograms were
analyzed and contig assembly was performed using the
Staden Package software suite [89]. Gene sequences were
identified by BLAST [90] sequence similarity searches at
GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/. Sequence
alignments were generated using ClustalX [91] and manually edited with BioEdit [92]. RNA secondary structures
were drawn with XRNA [93].
Southern hybridization analysis
Total Euglena DNA was digested with the specified restriction endonuclease (10 U/μg DNA, in the presence of DTT
and BSA) for 5 hr at 37°C, to ensure complete digestion.
For these experiments, we used a combination of BamH1
and EcoR1, two restriction endonucleases that do not have
recognition sequences within the Euglena U3, U5 or
tRNAArg genes or in the U3-U5 IGS sequences examined.
Restriction fragments, 10-13 μg/lane, were resolved by
electrophoresis in a 0.5% agarose/1× TAE gel at 1 V/cm for
20 hr. DNA fragments were depurinated and denatured

[94,95] prior to capillary transfer in 0.4 M NaOH to a
charged nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus®, NEN® Life
Science Products) according to the manufacturer's alkaline transfer protocol. Following overnight transfer, the
membrane was neutralized in 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)/2×
SSC (1× SSC = 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate) for
5 min, washed in 2× SSC for 5 min and baked at 80°C for
~8 hr. The nylon membrane was cut into strips corresponding to groups of duplicate sample lanes.
Cloned Southern hybridization probes were either excised
from their plasmid vector by restriction digestion or
amplified by PCR from the plasmid insert, with LMP agarose/hot phenol-based gel purification when necessary.
Approximately 100 ng of each probe was labeled by DNA
synthesis in the presence of random hexamer primers [96]
and [α-32P]dATP.
Membranes were soaked in 6× SSC for 5 min, then
washed for >30 min in 6× SSC at hybridization temperature (42°C). The blots were pre-hybridized for 4-18 hr in
Southern hybridization solution (5× Denhardt's solution,
5× SSC, 25 mM Na2HPO4, 25 mM NaH2PO4, 180 μg/ml
sheared and denatured herring testes DNA, 50% formamide, 1% SDS) [38,95], then hybridized for 18-22 hr. The
membranes were washed at 42°C by five 10-min incubations in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS and once or twice for 15 min in
0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS. The relative signal intensities of the
multiple hybridizing bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using ImageJ [97] to determine the area
under each peak.
Screening of an E. gracilis Genomic DNA Library
An E. gracilis λ genomic DNA library, constructed in the
λBlueSTAR™ vector (Novagen), was screened by plaque
lift (as per the membrane manufacturer's protocol; Magna
Lift, Osmonics) and hybridization with a Euglena U3
snoRNA gene probe. Hybridization and washing conditions were identical to those described for Southern
hybridization. Positive λ plaques were excised in vivo into
plasmid clones by Cre-mediated recombination and
transferred to E. coli DH5α cells, as described in the library
kit protocol. Plasmid DNAs were prepared and sequenced
