Abstract
Background: Regulation of gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) remains poorly
understood. While over half the genes are estimated to be regulated at the transcriptional level,
few regulatory motifs and transcription regulators have been found.
Results: The study seeks to identify putative regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of 13
functional groups of genes expressed in the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle of Pf. Three
motif-discovery programs were used for the purpose, and motifs were searched for only on the
gene coding strand. Four motifs – the 'G-rich', the 'C-rich', the 'TGTG' and the 'CACA' motifs –
were identified, and zero to all four of these occur in the 13 sets of upstream regions. The 'CACA
motif' was absent in functional groups expressed during the ring to early trophozoite transition.
For functional groups expressed in each transition, the motifs tended to be similar. Upstream
motifs in some functional groups showed 'positional conservation' by occurring at similar positions
relative to the translational start site (TLS); this increases their significance as regulatory motifs. In
the ribonucleotide synthesis, mitochondrial, proteasome and organellar translation machinery
genes, G-rich, C-rich, CACA and TGTG motifs, respectively, occur with striking positional
conservation. In the organellar translation machinery group, G-rich motifs occur close to the TLS.
The same motifs were sometimes identified for multiple functional groups; differences in location
and abundance of the motifs appear to ensure different modes of action.
Conclusion: The identification of positionally conserved over-represented upstream motifs
throws light on putative regulatory elements for transcription in Pf.

Background
The life-cycle of the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), consists of several morphological forms which
occur in the mosquito, liver and blood stages (e.g., gamete, salivary gland sporozoite, ring, trophozoite, schizont,
merozoite, gametocyte). Pf generates these morphologies
by regulating its gene expression; the morphological

transformations are accompanied by changes in the RNA
and protein repertoires of the cell [1,2]. The transcriptome
of the Pf asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle
(IDC) has been analysed and transcriptional regulation
has been shown to orchestrate a continuous cascade of
gene expression, with genes being induced once per cycle,
in a "just-in-time" manner, only when the gene product is

required by the cell [3]. The question then arises as to how
such fine-tuned regulation of gene expression is achieved
in this extreme parasite.
In functional genomics, it is believed to be likely that
genes with similar mRNA expression profiles (coexpressed genes) are regulated via the same mechanism
(co-regulated); similarly, it is thought to be likely that
genes with similar functions are regulated by the same
mechanism. Co-expressed genes which also have similar
functions are more likely to be co-regulated [4]. They are
likely to have conserved DNA sequence elements, called
transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs), in their promoter regions. TFBMs act as binding sites for transcription
factors and coordinate the expression of the genes in
whose promoter regions they appear. They are about 6–8
nucleotides (nt) in length and occur upstream of the gene
transcription start site (TSS). In response to environmental and developmental cues, TFBMs are bound by their
cognate transcription factors, and, as a result, co-expression of the associated set of genes takes place, by activation or inhibition of the transcription machinery [4-7].
Transcription of Pf genes appears to take place monocistronically, and Pf promoters have a bipartite structure
consisting of a basal promoter regulated by upstream
enhancer elements [8,9]. The number of transcription
associated proteins (TAPs) encoded by the Pf genome is
about one third the number of TAPs associated with the
transcriptional process in free-living eukaryotes [10]. The
basal transcriptional apparatus (RNA Polymerase II,
TATA-box binding protein and other components) in Pf is
similar to that in free-living eukaryotes. Chromatin
remodeling complexes and histone acetylases and
deacetylases, which modulate the accessibility of DNA to
transcription factors, are also present. However, there are
relatively few proteins in Pf which show homology to
known transcriptional regulators and which contribute to
gene-specific transcriptional regulation [10]. Thus, it
would appear that a system of transcriptional regulators
(activators and repressors) might not be the sole mechanism by which coordinated expression of genes is
achieved during the Pf life-cycle.
Post-transcriptional mechanisms have been proposed to
play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in Pf [11]. The CCCH-type zinc finger domain
(CCCH stands for C-x8-C-x5-C-x3-H, where x is any
amino acid) was found to be almost twice as abundant in
the Pf genome as in free-living eukaryotes. This type of
zinc finger functions in regulating mRNA stability and
translation [10]. Further, the Pf genome encodes homologues of components of the CCR4-NOT complex, which
has cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase activity; deadenylation modifies the rates of translation initiation and is the
rate-limiting step in mRNA decay. mRNA decay rates, on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/18

a genome-wide scale, during the IDC of Pf have been
determined [12]. Globally, mRNA decay rates were found
to increase during the IDC (from 9.5 min in the ring stage
to 65 min in the schizont stage). The authors suggest that,
in the late stage parasites, the morphological changes taking place (packaging multiple nuclei into merozoites)
may complicate regulation of transcription, and, instead,
global stabilization of mRNA may be regulating gene
expression. All these observations provide evidence that
post-transcriptional mRNA processing plays an important
role in regulating protein levels during the Pf life cycle.
Translational repression has also been shown to be a
means of regulating gene expression in Pf [13]. In gametocytes, there are transcripts which are abundant, but are
in a state of translational repression. RNA binding proteins, called Puf proteins, which are upregulated in gametocytes, repress the translation of the mRNAs [14]; they do
so by binding to a UUGU motif in the 3' untranslated
region (UTR) of their respective target mRNAs. Multiple
copies of this motif occur in the 3' UTRs. Another mRNA
binding protein that has been characterized is PfIRPa, an
iron regulatory-like protein; it binds to an iron-responsive
element, a stem-loop structure formed at 5' and 3' UTRs of
mRNA, and functions to inhibit translation or to modulate the stability of mRNA [15].
The 4 stages of the Pf IDC have been considered and
changes in mRNA and protein abundance over the 4
stage-transitions in the cycle – the merozoite/ring, ring/
trophozoite, trophozoite/schizont and schizont/merozoite transitions – have been examined [16]. For 55% of
the genes, mRNA and protein abundance changes followed similar trends over stage transitions; these were
genes whose expression was regulated at the transcriptional level. For the remaining genes, response in protein
levels was not complementary to changes in mRNA levels;
for most of these genes, however, changes in mRNA and
protein levels became complementary when the mRNA
abundance changes observed over one transition were
compared with protein abundance changes over the succeeding transition (for example, when mRNA abundance
changes over the merozoite/ring transition were compared with protein abundance changes over the ring/trophozoite transition). These were genes whose expression
was regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Thus, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation appear to
be of equal importance in the Pf IDC. However, while
transcriptional regulation is important, the Pf genome
appears to encode fewer transcriptional regulators than
free-living eukaryotes [10], and while post-transcriptional
regulation is important, the mechanism by which it is
achieved is not clear [12].
Given the reasonable importance of transcriptional regulation in Pf, in the present study, an attempt has been

made to search for potential regulatory sequences in the
upstream regions of co-expressed Pf genes, using in silico
motif-discovery methods. Regulatory sites in Pf have previously been identified using such procedures. A G-rich
regulatory element upstream of several Pf heat shock protein (hsp) genes has been identified using the AlignACE
program [17]. The regulatory element, named as G-box,
has the consensus sequence, (A/G)NGGGG(C/A), and
has been shown to be required for reporter gene expression in transient transfection experiments. In another
study, computational methods have first been used to
identify modules of co-regulated Pf genes, and motif
detection tools have then been used to identify potential
TFBMs in these modules [18]. For the hsp genes, the G-box
motif, and, in addition, a TG-box motif (a G-box preceded
by a string of Ts), have been identified. For a set of 77
genes, a putative TFBM containing the core sequence
"ACACA" has also been identified. In the upstream
regions of 600 chloroquine responsive genes, a significantly over-represented GAGAGAA motif has been identified [19]. The motif formed specific RNA-protein, but not
DNA-protein complexes, suggesting that it was regulating
gene expression at the RNA level. Phylogenetic footprinting techniques have been integrated with techniques for
detecting over-represented motifs, to identify TFBMs or
cis-regulatory motifs in Pf [20]. Upstream regions of coexpressed Pf genes, together with the upstream regions of
their orthologs in P. y. yoelii, have been considered, and
AlignACE has been used to find over-represented motifs
in the mixed set of sequences. The conservation of cis-regulatory motifs among different species has been exploited
for motif detection. However, only 12 putative regulatory
motifs have been identified. Most Pf genes were shown to
have 4–5 of these regulatory elements in their upstream
regions. The hypothesis has been made that each gene is
regulated by multiple factors, with different combinations
of factors being used to obtain the variety of expression
profiles observed in the Pf life-cycle. Recently, a new algorithm called Gene Enrichment Motif Searching (GEMS)
has been developed which has the ability to identify highconfidence, cis-regulatory elements in genomes such as
those of Pf, which have a skewed nucleotide composition
and are rich in repeat sequences [21]. The algorithm has
been applied to the promoter regions of genes occurring
in 21 functionally related, co-expressed clusters, generated
from Pf life-cycle microarray data by semi-supervised clustering; 34 putative cis-regulatory elements have been identified.
The asexual IDC transcriptome of Pf has previously been
analysed and 13 functional groups of co-expressed genes
have been listed [3]. In the present study, putative control
elements in the upstream regions of each of these 13 sets
of genes have been searched for. Three motif searching
programs have been used for the purpose: MEME [22],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/18

Weeder [23,24] and AlignACE [25]. These programs identify statistically over-represented motifs in a given set of
upstream sequences. A short motif that occurs more frequently in a given set of sequences than expected, based
on its frequency of occurrence in the genome, is said to be
over-represented. The rationale behind looking for overrepresented motifs is that, in eukaryotes, transcriptionrelated regulatory motifs are repeated many times in the
upstream regions, and multiple copies of the motif are
correlated with transcriptional activity [26,27]. Thus,
methods developed for the de novo identification of regulatory motifs are based on the premise that statistically
over-represented motifs are likely to be of biological significance. Studies correlating over-represented upstream
motifs with gene expression levels, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have given validity to this assumption [28,29]. The
over-represented motifs identified in this study would be
putative regulatory elements and their actual significance
would have to be experimentally determined.
The present study differs from the study by Young et al. in
[21] in several ways. While, in the present study, over-represented motifs identified by 3 motif-discovery programs
have been compared in order to identify reliable motifs,
in [21], a new method (called GEMS) has been developed
to identify regulatory motifs. The dataset of co-expressed
gene clusters also differs in the 2 studies (13 clusters
restricted to the Pf IDC versus 21 clusters covering the
entire Pf life-cycle). In the present study, as a result of
examining the promoter regions of gene clusters expressed
in the 48-hour Pf IDC, it has been possible to identify
combinations of putative regulatory motifs that might be
controlling gene co-expression in each stage transition in
the cycle. Also, in the present study, putative regulatory
elements have been identified for organellar genes (which
are encoded in the nuclear genome but whose products
are transported to organelles such as the mitochondrion
and apicoplast). Regulatory elements identified for the
organellar genes have also been compared with those
identified for the cytoplasmic genes. Other differences
between the 2 studies are discussed below.

Results
In the asexual IDC transcriptome of Pf, it has been shown
that cellular processes take place in an orderly, programmed and continuous cascade, and that functionally
related genes along this cascade show similar expression
profiles [3]. Table S2, in [3], lists 13 groups of nuclear
encoded genes, each group consisting of functionally
related genes that share a common expression profile; the
expression data or profile for genes in each group is also
given. Pearson correlation values were calculated for all
pairs of gene expression profiles in each group; the average value for each group is given in Table 1; the values
range from 0.66 to 0.88, indicating good correlation

between the expression profiles of genes in each group.
Each group may, therefore, be looked upon as a set of coexpressed genes. The groups of genes being functionally
related and co-expressed, the chances are greater that they
are co-regulated; this makes it meaningful to search for
regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of the groups of
genes.
In Table 1, the 13 groups of functionally related genes
have been arranged in the order in which they have been
presented in [3], which is the order in which they appear
in the Pf IDC. The 48 hour Pf IDC consists of the morphological stages of ring, trophozoite, schizont and merozoite. Induction of large numbers of genes occurs in the
ring to early trophozoite transition, in the trophozoite to
early schizont transition, during the mid- and late-schizont stages, and during the early ring stage. The functional groups induced during these 4 transitions are listed
in Table 1. The results of the present study have been discussed keeping this order of appearance of the functional
groups in mind.
The aim of the study was to search the upstream regions
of each set of functionally related, co-expressed genes, in

the Pf IDC, for conserved, regulatory motifs which might
be responsible for the co-ordinate expression of the set of
genes. Upstream regions have been considered on only
one DNA strand, the strand on which each gene was
encoded; ≤2000 nt upstream of the translational start site
(TLS) of each gene have been considered for motif searching (for more details, see Methods). All sequences used
and motifs presented in this study are in the 5'- to 3'-orientation. In the literature, many methods have become
available for the task of motif discovery. A comparative
assessment of 13 of them has been carried out [30] and it
has been recommended that multiple tools, rather than a
single one, be used to search for motifs, because different
tools, based on different algorithms, predict slightly different motifs, and, therefore, cover over-represented motif
space better. It has also been recommended that the top
few predicted motifs be considered, rather than the top
most one alone. In the present study, therefore, 3 motif
discovery programs, MEME, AlignACE and Weeder, have
been used to search for over-represented motifs, and several of the top-scoring motifs have been considered.
MEME and AlignACE were selected because they have
been used in previous studies aimed at identifying regulatory sequences in the Pf genome [17-20]. The Weeder pro-

gram was selected because, in the study in [30], it
outperformed other programs by most of the measures
used.
In order to check the sequences being used, and the computations, an attempt was made to retrieve the G-box regulatory element that had previously been identified [17].
The upstream regions (2000 nt upstream of the TLS) of
the 18 hsp genes considered in the study, were extracted,
and the AlignACE program, with previously reported
parameters, was used for motif searching. The G-box
motif was retrieved, and a comparison of the results
obtained with those given in the paper showed that the
sequences being used in this study, and the computations,
were right.
Results of motif searching in the upstream regions of 13
groups of co-expressed Pf genes
The 3 motif-discovery programs, MEME, Weeder and AlignACE, were used to search for over-represented motifs in
the upstream regions of each of the 13 sets of functionally
related, co-expressed Pf genes. A total of 179 motif-sets
were identified by the 3 programs in the 13 sets of
upstream regions, and there were a total of 3847 motif
occurrences in these motif-sets (for definitions, cf., Methods). The 179 motif-sets were grouped together (as
described under Methods) to form 57 motif groups, out of
which 27 were regarded as strong motif groups (an example is given in Table 2), because they included related
motif-sets that had been identified by more than one
motif-discovery program (there were exceptions; cf.,
below and Methods). These 27 strong motif groups were
formed by grouping together 129 out of 179 motif-sets,
and included 3208 motif occurrences. Additional files 1,
2, 3 and 4 show the 57 motif groups identified in the 13
sets of upstream regions; strong and weak motif groups,
and all motif-sets, motif occurrences and sequence logos
are shown. Additional file 1 shows the motif groups identified for the 4 sets of genes expressed during the ring to
early trophozoite transition (cf., Table 1), Additional file
2 shows the motif groups identified for the 6 sets of genes
expressed during the trophozoite to early schizont transition, and, similarly, Additional files 3 and 4 show motif
groups identified for the 2 and 1 sets of genes expressed
during the schizont and early ring stages, respectively. The
27 strong motif groups are labeled as 'strong motifs' in the
Figures.

An examination of the 27 strong motif groups showed
that there were only 4 unique motifs, and that none, some
or all 4 of them appeared as over-represented motifs in the
upstream regions of the 13 sets of genes. The 4 motifs have
been referred to, in the present study, as the G-rich motif,
the C-rich motif, the CACA motif and the TGTG motif;
examples of these motifs are shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/18

4, respectively. The G-rich motif has a core sequence consisting of 3 to 4 Gs (GGG, GGGG), the C-rich motif has a
core sequence consisting of 3 to 4 Cs (CCC, CCCC), the
CACA motif has the CACA core sequence and the TGTG
motif has a core sequence of more than one TG pair
(TGTG, TGTATG). The motif groups (or, simply, motifs)
occurring in the upstream regions of each of the 13 sets of
genes are given in Table 1.
Three of the four motifs (all, except the C-rich motif) have
previously been identified [20]. The C-rich motif has been
identified as an over-represented motif by the MEME program alone, for the set of mitochondrial genes (Figure 2);
it has, nevertheless, been regarded as a strong motif
because it occurs in most of the genes in the set. The Grich motif has previously been shown to be a regulatory
element (called the G-box or the TG-box) for the Pf hsp
genes [17,18]. In the present study, G-rich motifs have
been identified in the upstream regions of several sets of
genes, other than the hsp group, suggesting that they are
not limited to the latter group. Interestingly, in eukaryotes, cis-regulatory elements, called G-strings, consisting of
runs of only Gs on one strand and only Cs on the other,
have been found to appear frequently in the upstream
regions of genes that do not contain TATA boxes, initiator
elements or CCAAT boxes [31]. Pf upstream regions,
which often lack these latter elements, are thus ideally
suited to host G-strings or G-rich motifs. The CACA motif
has previously been identified in a putative TFBM [18]. In
the present study, it is conspicuously absent in the
upstream regions of functional groups expressed during
the ring to early trophozoite transition (Table 1). The
CACA and TGTG motifs identified, in this study, are not
microsatellites. While in mammalian genomes, [CA]n
repeats occur as microsatellites, in Pf, [CA]n and [TG]n
repeats do not do so; instead, [TA]n, [T]n and [TAA]n
repeats occur as microsatellites [32]. If at the start of the
study, one had hoped to find one unique upstream motif,
per co-expressed, functional group, that would explain
why genes in the group were concomitantly turned on,
one was certainly disappointed. Instead, a total of only 4
putative regulatory motifs were identified in the 13 sets,
and 0 to all 4 of these motifs were found to appear in the
upstream regions of each set. This is in consonance with
the suggestion made previously [20] that, while Pf may
have a small number of regulators and regulatory
sequences, as compared to other eukaryotes, it uses them
in a combinatorial way to bring about the required level
of diversity in gene expression. It is also closer to the situation where a unique motif or a unique combination of
motifs per transition, would explain why sets of genes specific to that transition were concomitantly turned on.
In order to check if the strong motifs identified in Table 1
were significant, statistical validation of the motifs was

The motif-sets are related and together constitute a strong motif group.
Given, for each motif in a set, are: the gene name, the motif that was identified in the upstream region of the gene, the position of the motif in the
upstream region, and, sometimes, an *, which indicates that the motif overlaps with motif occurrences in one or more of the other motif-sets; at
the top of each motif-set, a consensus sequence for the set is given; each motif-set has been used to obtain a sequence logo which is shown in

carried out, as described under Methods. The upstream
sequences of each set of genes were shuffled 10 times to
obtain 10 sets of shuffled sequences, and motif-searching
by all 3 programs was carried out on all 10 sets. MEME, in
200 runs, did not identify any over-represented motif, in
any set of shuffled sequences, obtained from any set of
upstream sequences. Thus, over-represented motifs identified by MEME in the original sets of upstream sequences

were significant because they were not picked in any of the
randomized sequences. AlignACE identified no over-represented motifs in 128 out of 140 runs. In the remaining
12 runs, 13 motifs were identified. All motifs, however,
were random ones because their MAP scores were poor (<
3.5; all motifs presented in the study have MAP scores >
10). Weeder runs (100) did not identify the motifs presented in this study. Considering that motifs presented in

the study were each usually identified by multiple programs, and that they were not identified in the randomized sequences, one can conclude with confidence that
the motifs are significant.
The Pf genome is the most AT-rich (or GC-poor) genome
to have been sequenced to date; it has an overall GC-con-

tent of 19.4%, with the GC-content of exons being higher,
at 23.7%, and that of intergenic regions being lower, at
13.6% [33]. Given the low overall GC-content, one would
expect that the usage of GC in the genome would not be
wasteful, and that G-C containing sequences would primarily be restricted to critical regions. Consistent with
this, exons have a significantly higher GC-content than
intergenic regions. In the upstream regions of genes
(which are intergenic regions), if GC-containing motifs
are over-represented, it would be reasonable to expect that
such motifs are important and, perhaps, have a regulatory
role, because GC is sparingly used in the genome. In the
present study, therefore, greater significance has been
attached to over-represented, GC-containing motifs.
Over-represented AT-rich motifs (e.g., ATATAT, AAAAAA,
TTTTTT, etc.) have largely been ignored because, owing to
the high AT-content of the genome, these motifs were not
likely to be unique to particular sets of co-expressed genes.

The CACA and TGTG motifs (and likewise, G-rich and Crich motifs), identified in the present study, although they
are partly complementary in sequence, have been
regarded as 2 different motifs, and not as the same motif
occurring on opposite strands. This is because, motifsearching was carried out on single-stranded upstream
sequences (Methods), and the TGTG and CACA motifs
that were picked were not from complementary strands.
Further, when a regulatory motif is not palindromic
(motifs in this study are not palindromic), the cognate
protein is likely to bind in a different orientation (relative
to the TSS) to, for example, a CACA motif on the coding
strand, as compared to a CACA motif on the non-coding
strand. Moreover, motif-searching programs, too, when
run in single or double-stranded modes, report complementary motifs as separate motifs. Thus, TGTG and CACA
motifs (and likewise, G-rich and C-rich motifs) deserved
to be treated as distinct motifs because distinct TFs were
likely to recognize them.
Positional conservation of motif occurrences in the
upstream regions
The motif occurrences in the 27 strong motif groups, identified in the upstream regions of the 13 sets of genes, were
sorted [see Additional files 5 and 6] and then visualized
using feature maps (Additional file 7 and Figures 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10 and 11; cf., Methods). An interesting feature
observed in some of the feature maps was that, in subsets
of gene upstream regions, there was a preferential positioning of motifs relative to the TLS (examples discussed
below); i.e., motifs show a preference to occur at a particular upstream position relative to the start of translation.
In the literature, this has been referred to as 'positional
bias', and TFBMs are known to display such a bias or preference [25]. In [21], 'positional enrichment' of motifs relative to the start codon has been noted for some clusters
of Pf genes (sexual development, cytosolic ribosome and

regarded as an indication that the motif is functionally

In the present study, positional bias or enrichment of a
motif, relative to the TLS, has been referred to as 'positional conservation', and the latter has been regarded as
an indication that the motif is important and, perhaps,
plays a regulatory role. Putative regulatory motifs identified in the upstream sequences of each of the 13 sets of

genes have been listed in Additional file 6. To identify sets
of motifs which show positional conservation, the
upstream region (extending from -2000 to -1) has been
divided into windows of width 100 nt and the number of
motifs occurring in each window, and also the number of
sequences showing motifs in the window, have been
counted from Additional file 6. Positional conservation
seen in a window has been considered to be statistically
significant if the probability of obtaining the observed (or
higher) number of motifs, and the observed (or higher)
number of sequences with motifs, in that window, by
chance (as observed by 20,000 Monte Carlo simulations),
was less than 0.05 (Methods). Thus, positionally conserved motifs presented in the study have been statistically
validated. Further, instances of positional conservation
have been discussed only when 4 or more motifs, and 4 or
more sequences with motifs, occurred in a window.
Details for the statistically validated, positionally conserved motifs are given in Additional file 8, and the motifs
are highlighted in color in Additional file 6.
An attempt has also been made to examine if some of the
positionally conserved motifs play a regulatory role at the

the upstream sequences of the sets of genes, and searching

end of the target mRNA, one can try to search for regulatory motifs in these additional sequence stretches. The
presence of regulatory motifs occurring at or upstream of
~-300, in the ESTs of several upstream sequences of a set
of genes, at the appropriate position with respect to the
EST start codon, has been taken to suggest that the motifs
may be playing a regulatory role at the RNA level (results
discussed below). Further, regulatory motifs identified for
some sets of Pf genes have also been searched for in the
upstream sequences of orthologous genes from other Plasmodium species (results discussed below and details given

Interesting observations made for the 13 sets of upstream
regions are described below. The strong motifs identified
for the 13 sets, and the positional conservation information for the motifs, are summarized in Additional file 10.

Additional files that the reader may turn to, while following the discussion below. While referring to Additional

TLS.

for this set of genes [Additional file 10]. The majority of
4G and 3G motifs occur upstream of -400.

as strong motif groups for this set of genes; all 3 motifs
show positional conservation [Additional file 10]. The
majority of 4G and 3G motifs occur upstream of -400,
suggesting that these motifs tend to occur away from the
TLS. 4C motifs also tend to occur upstream of -400. TGTG
motif occurrences are small in number. In [21], an

upstream CCCTTA motif was identified for a cytosolic
ribosome cluster (89 genes), and the motif was found to
be positionally enriched between -700 and -999. This
motif has, however, been regarded as the approximate
reverse complement of the G-box motif (ATGGGGC)
[17]. 35 genes are common between the cluster in [21]

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:18

and the present cluster. Here, C-rich and G-rich motifs
have been reported; positionally conserved 4C motifs
have been observed at ~-900.
(iii) Glycolytic pathway
A G-rich motif was identified as a strong motif for this set,
but no positional conservation was observed [Additional
file 10]. The latter was surprising because genes in the set
are tightly coregulated [3]. This set of genes is thought to
be post-transcriptionally regulated because a delay is
observed between mRNA accumulation and protein
expression [16]. Therefore, regulatory motifs at the transcriptional level may be less important.
(iv)Ribonucleotide synthesis genes
A G-rich motif appears as a strong motif in the upstream
regions of this set (Figure 6). Distinct positional conservation is observed at ~-800, where 2 4G, 2 3G, 3 2G and 1
1G motifs occur [see Additional file 6]. Positional conservation is also observed at ~-1300, -1700 (4, 6 occurrences,
respectively) and at ~-400 (6 occurrences; interesting but
statistically weakly significant, p < 0.22). All 4G motifs,
and all except 1 3G motifs occur upstream of -400. Thus,
distinctly positionally conserved G-rich motifs are
observed for this set of genes. The G-rich motifs were also
searched for in the ESTs retrieved for the upstream
sequences of this set of genes. Motifs occurring at -400 or
-800, with respect to the EST start codon, were not
observed in any of the ESTs [details given in Additional
file 9]. This would suggest that the motif plays a regulatory
role at the transcriptional (DNA) level, and not at the
post-transcriptional (RNA) level. The G-rich motifs [listed
in Additional file 6] were also searched for in the
upstream sequences of orthologs of this set of genes in
other Plasmodium species. Oddly, the G-rich motifs
occurred infrequently in the upstream sequences of the
orthologous genes [Additional file 9]. This would suggest
that the motifs are unique to the upstream sequences of
this set of genes in Pf.
(v) Deoxynucleotide synthesis
No strong upstream motif was identified for this set, even
though it is a tightly co-expressed set (Pearson correlation
value, 0.88; Table 1).
(vi) DNA replication machinery
4 strong motifs were identified for this set of genes – the
CACA, the TGTG, the G-rich, and the (less important) Crich motifs [see Additional file 10]. The CACA motif (Figure 3) shows positional conservation at ~-300 (8 occurrences) and at ~-500 and -1000 [5, 5 occurrences,
respectively; Figure 7, Additional file 6]. The latter 2 sets of
motifs are interesting but statistically weakly significant, p
< 0.10 and p < 0.15, respectively. CACA motifs were
searched for in the ESTs retrieved for the upstream

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/18

sequences of this set of genes [details given in Additional
file 9]. In the ESTs for 6 upstream sequences, upstream
CACA motifs (occurring at -118, -34, -111, -264, ~-300
and -489) were identified. Thus, in the ESTs of 3 of these
upstream sequences, positionally conserved upstream
motifs (occurring at -264, ~-300 and -489) were observed.
Owing to this latter observation, one has to admit the possibility that the CACA motif plays a regulatory role at the
RNA or post-transcriptional level. The CACA motifs were
also searched for in the upstream sequences of orthologs
of this set of genes in other Plasmodium species. The motif
is clearly observed in the upstream sequences, occurring,
more frequently, between -1 and -600 [feature map in
Additional file 9]. The occurrence of the motif in the
upstream sequences of 'in genera' orthologs gives considerable validity to the motif being a regulatory motif. TGTG
motifs occur between -1 and -800 and between -1000 and
-1700. The G-rich motif includes a significant number of
2G and 1G (e.g., GAGAGA) motif occurrences [see Additional file 5]; in comparison, 4G and 3G occurrences are
fewer, and all of them, except 1 4G and 1 3G motifs, occur
upstream of -400. In [21], for the cluster of 100 DNA replication and chromosome cycle genes (only 12 of which
are common to the present cluster of 32 genes), an
upstream NTGTGTGA motif was identified. It has been
pointed out that this motif is observed for a large group of
genes expressed during the middle to later stages of the
IDC and that it may play a role in the regulation of the
group. In agreement with this, in the present study, the
TGTG motif was observed in most groups of genes
expressed during the trophozoite/early schizont and schizont stages (Table 1). In addition to the TGTG motif, an
interesting CACA motif has been identified for this set of
genes, which may be functioning at the RNA level.
(vii) TCA cycle
A G-rich motif was identified as a strong motif for this set
of genes [Additional file 10]. 4G, 3G and 2G motifs did
not show positional conservation.
(viii) Proteasome
The strong motifs identified for this set were the CACA,
the G-rich and the TGTG motifs [Additional file 10]. The
CACA motif showed distinct positional conservation
between ~-800 and -1000 (15 occurrences) and between 1600 and -1700 (10 occurrences) [Figure 8, Additional
file 6]. While the CACA motifs in the upstream regions of
the DNA replication machinery genes occur closer to the
TLS (-200 to -600 and -1000; Figure 7), the CACA motifs
for this set of genes occur further upstream from the TLS
(~-900 and -1700). CACA motifs were searched for in the
ESTs retrieved for the upstream sequences of this set of
genes [Additional file 9]. In the ESTs for 3 proteasome
upstream sequences, motifs matching upstream CACA
motifs (occurring at -190, -199 and -232) were observed.

Page 12 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:18

In none of the ESTs, however, were positionally conserved
CACA motifs occurring at ~-900 identified. This would
suggest a regulatory role for the motif at the transcriptional (DNA) level. The CACA motifs [listed in Additional
file 6] were also searched for in the upstream sequences of
'in genera' orthologs of this set of genes. Motifs were
observed between -1 and ~-1200 in many sequences, and
further upstream in others; some positional conservation
was also observed [Additional file 9]. The G-rich motifs –
4G+3G – show some positional conservation. The TGTG
motif occurs as the variant, TGTATG. In [21], for the cluster of 75 proteasome complex genes (15 of which are
common to the present cluster of 28 genes), no upstream
motif was identified. In the present study, 3 motifs were
identified.
(ix) Mitochondrial genes
This set of genes, encoded on the nuclear genome, generates protein products that have to travel to the mitochondrion of the parasite. The genes have to be expressed
together, in order that their protein products may arrive
together at the mitochondrion. One might, therefore,
expect to find regulatory motifs which coordinate the temporal co-expression of this set of genes. 3 strong motifs
have been identified for the set – the C-rich, the G-rich
and the TGTG motifs [Additional file 10]. The C-rich
motif (Figure 2) was identified by MEME, alone. Figure 9,
which shows the locations of 4C+3C+2C motifs, shows
that there is distinct positional conservation of motifs at
~-500 (7 occurrences – 1 4C, 5 3C and 1 2C) and at ~-100
(4 occurrences – 3 4C and 1 3C; statistically weakly significant, p < 0.08). The striking positional conservation,
together with the fact that the number of motif occurrences is limited to at most 3 per gene, suggests that the
motif may have a significant regulatory role. The C-rich
motifs were further searched for in the 244 ESTs retrieved
for the upstream sequences of this set of genes [Additional
file 9]. In a single EST for one upstream sequence, a positionally conserved upstream motif (occurring at -497) was
observed. More evidence than this would be needed to
suggest that the C-rich motif plays a regulatory role at the
post-transcriptional (RNA) rather than the transcriptional
(DNA) level. The C-rich motifs, listed in Additional file 6,
were searched for in the upstream sequences of 'in genera'
orthologs of this set of genes. Impressively, motifs were
observed between -400 and -600; they were also observed
further upstream and between -200 and -400 [map in
Additional file 9]. The occurrence of the motif in orthologous upstream sequences provides considerable support
for the motif as a regulatory motif. The G-rich motif –
4G+3G+2G+1G – showed positional conservation
between ~-200 and -300 (6 occurrences). Out of 3 4G
motifs, one occurs at -107 and one occurs at -226. TGTG
motifs occurred between -200 and -450 (8 occurrences).
The 3 motifs, individually or together, appear to play a
regulatory role, because most of the occurrences of all 3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/18

motifs lie between -200 and -600 and are suitably positioned to function as TFBMs.
(x) Organellar translation machinery
This set of genes codes for components of the apicoplast
and/or mitochondrial translation machinery. The genes
are nuclear encoded but the proteins travel to the apicoplast or mitochondrion. Strong motifs identified for the
set were the G-rich, C-rich and TGTG motifs [Additional
file 10]. Figure 10 shows that G-rich motifs are quite
numerous: there are 11 4G, 29 3G and 27 2G motifs. Positional conservation is observed close to the TLS, at ~-30
[13 occurrences – 2 4G, 6 3G, 5 2G; Additional file 6].
While in most other groups of genes, 4G and (to a lesser
extent) 3G motifs usually occur upstream of -400 (e.g.,
Figure 6), in this group, 4G and 3G motifs frequently
occur between -1 and -400. Thus, the number and location of G-rich motifs is uncharacteristic in this set of
genes. TGTG motifs also show positional conservation
[Figures 4, 11, Additional file 10]. C-rich motifs, in this
set, in comparison with the mitochondrial genes, are
more numerous (16 4C, 26 3C and 24 2C motifs), but do
show positional conservation at ~-500. This set of genes
shows homology to components of the cytoplasmic translation machinery [3]. Interestingly, the strong motifs identified for both sets of genes are the same (G-rich, C-rich
and TGTG motifs); motif occurrences in the upstream
regions of the 2 sets, however, show differences. In the
organellar translation machinery set, G-rich motifs occur
closer to the TLS, while in the cytoplasmic translation
machinery set, they occur further upstream [Figure 10 and
Additional file 7:5–7]; in the former, TGTG motifs are
more numerous and show positional conservation, while
in the latter, occurrences of the motif are far fewer [Figure
11 and Additional file 7:13]; TGTG and C-rich motifs tend
to occur further upstream in the latter as compared to the
former; finally, in the former, upstream regions are
shorter as compared to the latter. The differences may be
regulatory cues that ensure that the 2 sets of genes are
turned on at different time points in the IDC. They may
also be a reflection of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins of the 2 sets of genes.

G-rich and TGTG motifs were searched for in the 339 ESTs
retrieved for the upstream sequences of this set of genes
[Additional file 9]. Considering that many G-rich motifs
occur close to the TLS, and that motifs occurring close to
the TLS (rather than those occurring further upstream) are
more likely to be transcribed into the ESTs, it was surprising to find only a small number of upstream motifs in the
ESTs. For the upstream sequence, PF14_0132, 3 interesting ESTs were found; each EST had the start codon and 3
upstream G-rich motifs (occurring at -83, -176 and -200).
Altogether, in the ESTs of only 3 and 5 upstream
sequences, out of 33, respectively, were upstream G-rich
and TGTG motifs found, respectively. Only upstream

motifs occurring close to the TLS (between -200 and the
TLS) were observed in the ESTs. More evidence would be
needed to suggest that the G-rich and TGTG motifs
observed for this set of genes play a regulatory role at the
post-transcriptional level. The G-rich and TGTG motifs
[listed in Additional file 6] were also searched for in the
upstream sequences of 'in genera' orthologs of this set of
genes. In contrast to the considerable number of G-rich
motifs observed in the Pf upstream sequences, few motifs
were observed in the orthologous upstream sequences; an
indication, perhaps, that the G-rich motifs were unique to
the Pf upstream sequences. TGTG motifs were observed in
the orthologous upstream sequences. They occurred
between -200 and -800 where positionally conserved Pf
upstream motifs also occur [Additional file 9].
(xi) Merozoite invasion genes
4 strong motifs – TGCACA (CACA motif preceded by TG),
TGTG, C-rich, G-rich – were identified for this set [Additional file 10]. The four motifs do not show striking patterns of positional conservation. G-rich motifs tend to
occur upstream of -400.
(xii) Actin myosin motors
This is a tightly co-expressed group of genes (Pearson correlation value, 0.83; Table 1). Strong motifs identified for
this group were the TGCACA motif, the G-rich motif and
the TGTG motif [Additional file 10]. The motifs did not
show distinct patterns of positional conservation. Most
4G and 3G motifs occurred upstream of -400; several
TGTG motifs occurred between -100 and -400.
(xiii) Early ring transcript genes
Strong motifs were not identified for this set, perhaps,
because the genes are post-transcriptionally regulated
[16].

Discussion
The study by Young et al. [21] and the present study have
both used computational methods to identify putative
regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of co-expressed
genes in the Pf life-cycle. The co-expressed gene clusters
for which regulatory motifs have been identified, however, differ in the 2 studies (Introduction). For the cytoplasmic translation machinery, DNA replication
machinery and proteasome clusters, however, there is
some overlap of genes in the 2 studies. In the present
study, for each of the first 2 of these clusters, several putative regulatory motifs have been identified, including a
motif similar to the one in [21]; for the proteasome cluster, 3 motifs were identified in the present study (Results),
while none were identified in [21].
The search, in the present study, for over-represented
motifs in the upstream regions of 13 functional groups of
co-expressed genes, in the 48-hour Pf IDC, yielded several

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/18

interesting results. 4 main motifs were identified by the
methods used, and they have been referred to as the Grich, the C-rich, the CACA and the TGTG motifs. Zero to
all four of these motifs occur in the upstream regions of
each of the 13 sets of genes. Motifs, similar to these 4, have
previously been identified for different sets of genes [1721]. In this study, combinations of putative regulatory
motifs have been identified for co-expressed sets of genes
in the stage transitions of the 48-hour Pf IDC. It has previously been suggested that, rather than a large variety of cisregulatory motifs, different combinations of a small
number of motifs regulate gene expression in Pf [20]. It is
further suggested here that the combination of regulatory
motifs tends to be more similar for functional groups of
genes expressed in the same transition (Table 1). An
examination of the occurrences of each motif in the
upstream regions of the relevant group of genes showed
that, for some motifs, the occurrences were positionally
conserved in subsets of genes; i.e., in subsets of genes,
motifs occurred at similar upstream positions with respect
to the TLS, even when the genes in the subset were present
on different chromosomes. The observed positional conservation enhances the significance of the over-represented motifs identified by the motif discovery programs,
and suggests that the motifs may have a regulatory role. In
[21], 'positional enrichment' of motifs relative to the start
codon has been noted for some clusters of Pf genes. In the
present study, the observed positional conservation has
been shown to be statistically significant.
Additional file 6 lists putative regulatory motifs (including positionally conserved ones) discussed in the text. The
table would be useful to experimentalists looking for transcription regulatory elements in the Pf genome. Some
striking examples of positional conservation were
observed. In the ribonucleotide synthesis group, distinct
positional conservation of G-rich motifs was observed,
with the motifs almost occurring in columns (Figure 6). In
the set of mitochondrial genes, the C-rich motif occurs
with striking positional conservation at -500 (Figure 9). In
the proteasome set of genes, the CACA motif shows striking positional conservation at ~-900 and -1700 (Figure 8);
on the other hand, in the DNA replication machinery
genes, the CACA motif occurs closer to the TLS (-200 to 600 and at ~-1000; Figure 7). In all functional groups,
except the organellar translation machinery group, 4Gand (to a lesser extent) 3G-containing G-rich motifs
tended to occur upstream of -400; in the organellar translation machinery group, 4G and 3G motifs frequently
occurred between -1 and -400 (Figure 10); thus, the position of G-rich motifs is unusual in this set of genes. The
organellar translation machinery and mitochondrial
genes are nuclear encoded but are of prokaryotic origin;
their protein products are slated for and function in the
mitochondrion and apicoplast, organelles of prokaryotic
origin. The C-rich motif occurring upstream of the mitoPage 14 of 21

chondrial genes, and the uncharacteristically positioned
G-rich motifs occurring upstream of the organellar translation machinery genes, perhaps, help to ensure that these
genes are expressed in a timely fashion, in order that their
protein products may travel to their destination, outside
the nucleus.
As separate cytoplasmic and organellar translation
machinery gene co-expression clusters, occurring at different time points in the Pf IDC, are observed (Table 1), it
has been possible, in the present study, to make a comparison of the putative regulatory motifs in the upstream
regions of these 2 sets of genes. The upstream regions tend
to be longer in the former as compared to the latter. The
G-rich, the TGTG and the C-rich motifs were identified as
over-represented for both sets of genes (Table 1). The locations of the motifs, however, differ in the 2 sets of genes.
G-rich motifs in the former usually occur upstream of 400, while in the latter they frequently occur between -1
and -400; TGTG motifs are not numerous in the former
but are numerous in the latter; TGTG and C-rich motifs
tend to occur further upstream in the former as compared
to the latter. Thus, presumably, the control mechanisms
differ for the 2 sets of genes, even though the latter set
shows homology to the former [3]. This is necessary, too,
because the 2 sets of genes are expressed at different time
points in the Pf IDC (Table 1).
In [21], the G-box motif [17] has been regarded as the
complement of the CCCCTTA motif and it has been suggested that the motif may be associated with highly
expressed trophozoite-specific metabolic genes. Further,
the NTGTGTGA motif has been observed for a large group
of genes expressed during the middle to later stages of the
IDC [21]. In the present study, too, TGTG, C-rich and Grich motifs are observed for many clusters of genes in the
IDC (G-rich and C-rich motifs have been regarded as separate motifs; cf., Results). However, the combination of
motifs is more similar for clusters in a transition (Table 1).
Further, the CACA motif appears not to be over-represented only in the upstream regions of genes expressed in
the ring to early trophozoite transition. The presence of
the motif may ensure that genes with the motif are not
turned on during this transition. The motif is over-represented in the upstream regions of sets of genes expressed
in the trophozoite to early schizont transition (except the
mitochondrial and organellar translation machinery sets
of genes, which are unique because their protein products
are headed outside the nucleus), and also in the schizont
stage, where modified CACA motifs (TGCACA motifs) are
over-represented.
An attempt has been made to examine if some of the positionally conserved motifs might be playing a regulatory
role at the post-transcriptional level. Putative regulatory

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/18

motifs were searched for in the ESTs retrieved for the
upstream sequences of sets of genes. Upstream G-rich
motifs (at -400 and -800) and CACA motifs (at ~-900)
identified for the ribonucleotide synthesis and proteasome sets of genes, respectively, were not found in the
ESTs; this would suggest that these motifs play a regulatory role not at the RNA, but at the DNA level. Upstream
CACA motifs (at -489, ~-300 and -264) identified for the
DNA replication machinery set were observed in the ESTs,
admitting the possibility that the motifs play a role at the
post-transcriptional level. While some positionally conserved upstream motifs were observed in the ESTs for the
mitochondrial and organellar translation machinery sets
of upstream sequences, more evidence would be needed
to suggest that the motifs play a role at the RNA level. In
general, among the motifs observed in the ESTs, upstream
motifs occurring close to the TLS were the most common
while those occurring further upstream (at ~-400) were
rare. Upstream motifs at ~-700 and above were never
observed in the ESTs.
In order to validate some of the positionally conserved
motifs identified for sets of Pf genes, the motifs have been
searched for in the upstream sequences of orthologous
genes from other Plasmodium species. Upstream CACA
motifs for the DNA replication machinery and proteasome sets of genes, C-rich motifs for the mitochondrial
genes and TGTG motifs for the organellar translation
machinery genes were all observed in the orthologous
upstream sequences, sometimes at positions at which
positionally conserved motifs were observed in Pf. These
observations lend considerable validity to these motifs
being regulatory motifs. Oddly, G-rich motifs for the ribonucleotide synthesis and organellar translation machinery
sets of genes were not observed in orthologous upstream
sequences from other Plasmodium species. Since G-rich
motifs for two sets of genes were not observed, it is possible that the occurrence of these motifs, in these sets of
genes, is unique to Pf.
Some motif occurrences, in the present study, show positional conservation at positions ranging from -1 to -800
while others show conservation between -1000 and 2000. One might speculate that motifs occurring at the
former positions constitute TFBMs [25], while those
occurring at the latter positions probably constitute
upstream enhancer elements. In the ribonucleotide synthesis, proteasome, mitochondrial, organellar translation
machinery and DNA replication machinery sets of genes,
positionally conserved upstream motifs were observed.
Many of the upstream sequences in these sets are < 2000
nt in length (Table 1), ranging between 600 and 1800 nt.
Given the positional conservation of motifs, one is led to
speculate that these sets of genes are transcriptionally regulated. To conclude, it is felt that, by looking for posi-

tional conservation of motif occurrences, a way has been
found to gain more insight into regulatory elements that
might be responsible for transcriptional regulation in Pf.
If experimental approaches were to be used to evaluate the
positionally conserved motifs identified in the present
study, the functional groups on which efforts could be
focused would be the ribonucleotide synthesis, mitochondrial, organellar translation machinery, proteasome
and DNA replication machinery groups.

belonging to the upstream gene were left out. The choice
of 2000 nt was guided by a previous study in which 2000
nt upstream of the TLS of hsp genes have been considered
for motif-discovery [17]. In [21], 1000 nt upstream of the
TLS of each gene have been considered for motif-searching, after determining that Pf intergenic regions were on
average 1694 nt in length. The TLS has been used as a
proxy for the TSS because the latter has not been determined for most Pf genes.

Conclusion

(2) Definitions
In the present study, the terms – motif, motif occurrence,
motif-set, consensus motif and motif-group – have been
used and need to be explained. In a set of upstream
regions, a particular short stretch of sequence (approximately 6–12 nt in length) may be over-represented; the
short stretch of sequence has been referred to as a 'motif'.
All occurrences of this and closely related motifs, in the set
of upstream sequences, have been referred to as 'motif
occurrences'. The collective set of motif occurrences, in the
set of upstream sequences, has been referred to as a 'motifset'. The motif occurrences may be aligned and used to
obtain a 'consensus motif'. A group of related motif-sets
(explained below), identified by the same or different programs, has been referred to as a 'motif group'. In Table 2,
for example, each block of sequences is a motif-set, and
each sequence or motif in the motif-set is a motif occurrence; the sequences constituting each motif-set are
aligned and used to obtain a 'consensus motif' which is
given at the top of the motif-set; all motif-sets in Table 2
are related (explained below) and constitute a 'motifgroup'. While discussing results, however, for convenience, 'motif-group' has also been referred to, merely, as
'motif'.

The study identifies positionally conserved, over-represented motifs in the upstream regions of functionally
related, co-expressed Pf genes. Positional conservation
with respect to the TLS, observed even for genes located on
different chromosomes, increases the significance of some
of the identified over-represented motifs. The positionally
conserved arrangement of motifs in the upstream regions
of some sets of genes (e.g., the ribonucleotide synthesis
genes) suggests a regulatory role for the motifs which may
include control of co-expression of the sets of genes. Further, for the different sets of genes expressed in a transition, the observed combination of upstream motifs tends
to be similar; this may be a regulatory mechanism for coordinating the expression of sets of genes that are
expressed in the transition. Thus, the study throws light
on regulatory elements for transcription in the Pf IDC. The
identified motifs may be regarded as useful hypotheses for
experimentally probing transcriptional regulation of gene
co-expression in Pf.

Methods
(1) Dataset
The asexual IDC transcriptome of Pf has previously been
studied, and 13 groups of nuclear encoded, functionally
related, co-expressed genes have been listed in Table S2 of
reference [3]. The 13 groups of genes constituted the dataset for this study and the aim was to search for over-represented motifs in the upstream regions of each group. To
begin with, it was necessary to extract the upstream
regions. In order to do this, Pf chromosome, coding and
protein sequence files (dated February 2005) were first
downloaded from PlasmoDB [34]. A program was then
written in Perl to use the genome annotation given in the
coding sequence file, to extract, from the sequence of each
Pf chromosome, the exons, introns, upstream and downstream regions of each gene. Upstream regions were considered on only one DNA strand; this was the strand on
which the gene was encoded. All sequences used and presented in this study are in the 5'- to 3'-orientation. For the
purpose of motif searching, only 2000 nt upstream of the
TLS of each gene were considered; the remaining
upstream sequence of the gene (extending up to the nearest upstream gene) was left out. If the gene of interest was
separated from its upstream gene by < 2000 nt, then nt

(3) Motif-discovery programs used
Three motif-discovery programs have been used to search
for over-represented motifs in the upstream regions of
each of the above-mentioned 13 sets of genes. The programs were downloaded over the web and used as standalones. A description of how the 3 programs have been
used follows. Parameters not specified below were left at
their default values.

(i) MEME uses an Expectation Maximization algorithm to
discover over-represented motifs [22]. The program was
used to search for motifs of length 6–12 nt, with E-values
≤ 1, only on the forward strands of the input sequences.
For each set of upstream regions, motif searching was carried out using both 'zoops' (zero or one occurrence per
sequence) and 'anr' (any number of repetitions) options.
These options determine the distribution of motifs in the
upstream sequences. Information obtained from both the
'zoops' and 'anr' runs was found to be useful. From the
output of both runs, motif-sets with E-values ≥ 0.1 were

Page 16 of 21

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:18

discarded. Motif-sets consisting of ATATATAT, TTTTTTTT,
AAAAAAA, etc., motifs were ignored because they were
not likely to be unique to any particular set of genes
(Results). For the remaining, significant motif-sets,
sequence logos [35,36] were generated, using the motif
occurrences in each set (Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4).
(ii) Weeder uses an enumerative algorithm and a suffix
tree representation of input sequences to find over-represented motifs [23,24]. The program was run in the 'large'
mode which reports motifs of lengths 6, 8, 10 and 12 nt,
and, as a degree of approximation, allows 1, 2, 3 and 4
mutations, respectively, to occur in the instances of the
motifs. A single-stranded analysis was carried out, and 'PF'
(which stands for Plasmodium falciparum) was selected as
the organism to be used for modeling the background frequencies. The motifs were assumed to appear in 'some'
sequences of the set, and they were expected to occur once
per input sequence. The 15 highest-scoring motifs of each
length were saved. The "advice" provided in the Weeder
output file was used to select significant motifs for each set
of genes. Motifs regarded as "interesting (highest-ranking)" in the output were considered; if only AT-rich motifs
were picked in this list, motifs regarded in the output as
"interesting (not highest-ranking)" were also considered.
From both lists, motifs consisting entirely of A and T were
ignored and the remaining motifs were selected. The
occurrences of each selected motif in the input set of
sequences were picked using the 'locator' program. Occurrences with 0 or 1 mutations and with a match percentage
≥ 90% (between the motif and its occurrence) were
accepted. Motifs with too many occurrences in the set of
upstream sequences were rejected because they were not
likely to be unique. For the remaining motifs, sequence
logos were created, using the motif occurrences.
(iii) AlignACE relies on a Gibbs sampling algorithm to
find over-represented motifs [25]. While running the program, the GC-content parameter ('gcback') was set to 0.13
(the value used in [17]), which is the fractional GC-content of Pf intergenic regions. The 'numcols' parameter,
which specifies the number of nt columns to align, was
assigned values from 6 to 10, and for each 'numcols'
value, AlignACE was run twice. Thus, for each set of
upstream regions, AlignACE was run 10 times. This was
done in order to obtain a greater variety of consensus
motifs. The 'expect' value, which is the number of motif
occurrences to expect in the set of sequences, was set to 3;
the oversample parameter was also set to 3. At the end of
the AlignACE runs, only consensus motifs with MAP
(maximum a priori log likelihood) scores > 10 were
accepted, as this was the score previously used to identify
yeast TFBMs [25]. Next, the ScanACE program was used to
scan the upstream regions of all Pf genes for the presence
of the accepted AlignACE consensus motifs. For ScanACE,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/18

the GC-content parameter was set to 0.13, and the maximum number of motif occurrences to be returned was set
to 1000. The MotifStats program was next run; it uses the
output from ScanACE to calculate the group specificity
and positional specificity scores for each consensus motif.
Motifs with the smallest group and positional specificity
scores were regarded as being significant. It has been
pointed out that TFBMs in yeast show high group specificity and positional bias ([25]; both scores are < 10-10). In
the present Pf study, however, both scores were always
found to be > 10-10. The CompareACE program was next
used to perform a pairwise comparison between all consensus motifs. The motifs were then clustered (c > 0.6)
using the Tree and list_clusters.pl programs. From the
final list of consensus motif clusters, motifs with the best
group specificity scores and with good positional bias
scores were manually selected. For each of these consensus motifs, a sequence logo was created, using motif
occurrences, identified by AlignACE, on the forward
strand alone.
(4) Grouping motif-sets
After the 3 motif-discovery programs had been run for a
set of upstream regions, there would be motif-sets identified by MEME, motif-sets identified by Weeder and motifsets identified by AlignACE; each motif-set would also
have its sequence logo. The motif-sets were then compared among themselves to see if they could be grouped.
For this, the sequence logos of the motif-sets were first visually compared, and, if they appeared similar, the motifsets were tentatively grouped. Motif-sets within each tentative group were then compared. No 2 motif-sets were
ever identical; the motif occurrences and their lengths
tended to differ. Therefore, in the present study, 2 motifsets have been regarded as being strongly related, if over 2
motif occurrences in one overlapped with motif occurrences in the other. (2 motif-sets have been regarded as
being weakly related, if only 1 or 2 motif occurrences in
one, overlapped with motif occurrences in the other).
Strongly related motif-sets were then grouped together to
form a motif group. A motif group has been regarded as a
strong motif group if it included motif-sets identified by
more than one program (exception discussed below). The
motif-sets in Table 2, for example, are strongly related; in
the different motif-sets, motif occurrences which overlap
have been marked by asterisks. The motif-sets in the table,
and the corresponding sequence logos in Figure 1, constitute a strong motif-group because the group includes
motif-sets identified by more than one program. Thus,
motif-sets were grouped together, based on a manual
comparison of their motif occurrences. Each strong motif
group was regarded as a potential regulatory motif.

Greater confidence was reposed in strongly related motifsets identified by more than one motif discovery program.

If 2 programs, using different algorithms to find statistically over-represented motifs, regard nearly the same set
of sequences as being over-represented, then the chances
are greater that the set of sequences are significant and,
perhaps, biologically important. However, over-represented motifs identified by a single program have also
been considered as putative regulatory motifs if they consisted primarily of G and/or C and if they occurred frequently in a set of upstream sequences (e.g., the C-rich
motif identified by MEME, for the mitochondrial genes;
Figure 2). There were also instances, in a motif group,
when closely related motif-sets had been identified several
times by the same program (in Table 2, for example, AlignACE has identified 5 related motif-sets). However, once
the motif-sets had been grouped, all motif occurrences in
the group (all motif occurrences in Table 2, for example)
were regarded as occurrences of the same motif. All strong
and weak motif groups identified for each of the 13 sets of
genes are given in Additional files 1, 2, 3, and 4.
In order to independently check if the motif-sets grouped
together to form each strong motif group were indeed
similar, the web tool, STAMP [37], was used. The motifsets in each motif group were input to the program, which
tries to build a tree showing the similarity between the
motif-sets. Similarity tree building was attempted for all
27 strong motif groups identified in the study. For 14
strong motif groups, the worst pairwise similarity between
motif-sets was < 0.1, indicating that there was a high
degree of similarity between motif-sets in each group. This
justified the grouping of the motif-sets into their respective motif groups. For 9 more strong motif groups, no tree
was generated because there were only 2 motif-sets to be
compared, in each group; for 3 of the remaining 4, the
worst pairwise similarity between motif-sets was < 0.2 and
for 1, it was < 0.33 (this was the C-rich motif group identified for the large set of 132 cytoplasmic translation
machinery genes; Additional file 1:13). Thus, overall, the
results of STAMP corroborated the manual grouping of
motif-sets.
(5) Sorting and visualizing motif occurrences
After the motif-sets had been grouped, the next step was
to sort and visualize the motif occurrences in each motif
group. By sorting the motif occurrences, the best subset of
occurrences in each motif group was being considered. As
discussed under Results, 4 kinds of motif groups were
identified for the 13 sets of genes. They were the G-rich,
the C-rich, the CACA and the TGTG motif groups (Figures
1, 2, 3 and 4). The strong motif groups identified for each
set of genes were considered one at a time, and the motif
occurrences in the group were sorted. The Linux 'grep' filter was used to do all the sorting. Considering, first, a Grich motif group (e.g., Table 2), all motif occurrences in
the group were pooled together and were then sorted by
separating motif occurrences with a maximum of 4 (or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/18

more) Gs, 3Gs and 2Gs. Likewise, for each C-rich motif
group (Figure 2 and Additional file 2:37), motif occurrences with a maximum of 4 (or more) Cs, 3Cs and 2Cs
were separated. In each CACA motif group (Figure 3,
Additional file 2:12, 29), in order to retain only the most
significant motifs, motifs containing the sequence
ACACAC and also those where at most 2As were replaced
by Gs and at most the corresponding 2 Cs were replaced
by Ts were considered; motifs containing the sequence
ACAC or CACA and also those where one or both As were
replaced by Gs were considered. Likewise, in each TGTG
motif group (Figure 4 and Additional file 2:48), motifs
containing the sequence TGTG or GTGT and also those
where one or both Ts were replaced by Cs were considered; motifs containing the sequence TGTATG and also
those where the second T was replaced by C were considered, and motifs containing the sequence GTATGT and
also those where the first and/or third Ts were replaced by
Cs were considered. These substitutions were selected
because they were observed among the motifs picked by
the motif-discovery programs. In order to allow the
majority of motifs picked by the programs to be included
among the sorted motifs, these substitutions were permitted, during sorting. Motifs such as CATATA or TGTATA
were left out because they would be virtually indistinguishable from the TATATA sequences that occur in plenty
in the Pf genome. Motif occurrences in each strong motif
group, after sorting, are listed in Additional file 5. For
example, 4G-, 3G-, 2G- and 1G-containing motifs, in the
strong motif group in Table 2, are listed in Additional file
5, after sorting.
The next step was to visualize the positions at which the
sorted motifs occurred in the upstream regions of the
appropriate set of genes. The dna-pattern and feature map
programs were used for this [27,38,39]. The sorted motif
occurrences and the relevant set of upstream regions were
input to the dna-pattern program. For example, sorted
4G- and 3G-containing motifs, in Additional file 5, for the
transcription machinery genes, together with the relevant
set of upstream sequences, were input to the program. The
program locates all occurrences of each input motif in the
set of upstream sequences. These occurrences are input to
the feature map program which generates a graphical feature map marking the positions of the occurrences in the
upstream regions (Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11). For
each feature map discussed in the text, the sequence of
each motif occurring in the map, and the position at
which it occurs, with respect to the TLS, is given in Additional file 6. For example, the sequence and position of
each upstream motif in the feature map for the transcription machinery genes (Figure 5), is shown, in order, in
Additional file 6. Feature maps for sorted motif occurrences are shown in Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 and in
Additional file 7, and for unsorted motif occurrences in
Additional files 1, 2, 3, and 4.

(6) Statistical validations of putative regulatory motifs
(i) Testing the significance of the motifs identified by the motifdiscovery programs
The upstream sequences of 10 sets of genes in Table 1, for
which strong motif groups have been identified, were
used for testing. (The large set of 132 cytoplasmic translation machinery genes was left out because it would take
too much time to get through the tests). For testing, the
above 10 sets of upstream sequences were shuffled using
the 'shuffleseq' program in the EMBOSS software suite
[40] (the program shuffles individual sequences in each
set, while maintaining composition). From each set of
upstream sequences, 10 shuffled sets of sequences were
obtained. The 3 motif-discovery programs were then used
to search for over-represented motifs in each of the 10
shuffled sets. MEME was run 200 times – once each in
'zoops' and 'anr' modes, for each of the 10 shuffled sets,
for each of the 10 sets of upstream sequences. AlignACE
was run 140 times: 14 times for each of the 10 sets of
upstream sequences; 14 times for an upstream set,
because it was run once for each of the 10 shuffled sets
with numcols set to 6, and 4 more times with any 4 of the
shuffled sets with 'numcols' set to 7, 8, 9 and 10. Weeder
was run 100 times: once for each of the 10 shuffled sets,
of each of the 10 sets of upstream sequences. The motifs
identified in the shuffled sets (if any), and their scores
(e.g., MAP score for AlignACE motifs), were compared
with the motifs and scores obtained with the original,
unshuffled set of upstream sequences. A motif identified
in the original upstream set was regarded as significant: (i)
if it was not identified in the shuffled sets and (ii) if its
scores were better than the scores obtained for the random
motifs.
(ii) Statistical validation of positionally conserved motifs
The upstream region (extending from -2000 to -1) was
divided into 39 overlapping windows of width 100 nt.
The starting point of consecutive windows differed by 50
nt; that is, windows were considered in the following way:
-2000 to -1901, -1950 to -1851, -1900 to -1801, ..., -250
to -151, -200 to -101, -150 to -51, -100 to -1. Positional
conservation of motifs, in sets of upstream sequences, was
examined in these windows of width 100 nt. For each set
of motifs in a set of upstream sequences, the number of
motifs occurring in each window, and the total number of
sequences with one or motifs, occurring in each window,
was tabulated using the data presented in Additional file
6. The total number of motifs in a set of upstream
sequences, and the number of motifs occurring in each
upstream sequence, was also tabulated using Additional
file 6.

positions of the motifs in the upstream sequences, and
then examining the occupancy of the motifs in each of the
above windows. The null hypothesis that was to be tested
was that there were no favored regions for the motifs; i.e.,
motifs could occur anywhere in the upstream sequences
with equal probability. In each simulation, while randomly distributing motifs in the upstream sequences, care
was taken to ensure that: (i) the number of motifs occurring in each upstream sequence was the same as the
observed number of motifs in the sequence, and (ii) that
there were no overlapping motifs in any sequence. The
occupancy of motifs in the upstream windows was then
examined in the following way. Let Nmio denote the
observed number of motifs in the ith window and let Nsio
denote the observed number of sequences with one or
more motifs, in the ith window (tabulated as described
above, from Additional file 6). Analogously, let Nmi' and
Nsi' denote the corresponding values observed in each
Monte Carlo simulation. These latter values would
describe the occupancy of motifs in the upstream windows, in each simulation. A total of 20,000 simulations
were carried out for each set of motifs occurring in a set of
upstream sequences, and Nmi' and Nsi' were counted for
each simulation. The positional conservation of motifs
observed in a window (from Additional file 6) was considered to be statistically significant if the number of simulations (out of 20,000), in which Nmi' ≥ Nmio and Nsi' ≥
Nsio, was less than 1000 (this would correspond to p <
0.05; i.e., the probability of observing Nmio or more
motifs in the window, and the probability of observing
Nsio or more sequences, each with one or more motifs, in
the window, by chance, was < 0.05). Since positional
enrichment (positional conservation) has been reported
previously for similar datasets [21], the objective of the
above analysis was to examine statistical evidence in support of a similar pattern in the present dataset. We would
therefore prefer to describe our results as suggestive (and
not necessarily conclusive) of positional conservation of
motifs. Details for the statistically validated, positionally
conserved motifs are given in Additional file 8, and the
motifs are highlighted in Additional file 6.
