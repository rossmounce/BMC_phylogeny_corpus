Abstract
Background: The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor has emerged as the primary pest of domestic honey bees
(Apis mellifera). Here we present an initial survey of the V. destructor genome carried out to advance our
understanding of Varroa biology and to identify new avenues for mite control. This sequence survey provides
immediate resources for molecular and population-genetic analyses of Varroa-Apis interactions and defines the
challenges ahead for a comprehensive Varroa genome project.
Results: The genome size was estimated by flow cytometry to be 565 Mbp, larger than most sequenced insects
but modest relative to some other Acari. Genomic DNA pooled from ~1,000 mites was sequenced to 4.3×
coverage with 454 pyrosequencing. The 2.4 Gbp of sequencing reads were assembled into 184,094 contigs with an
N50 of 2,262 bp, totaling 294 Mbp of sequence after filtering. Genic sequences with homology to other eukaryotic
genomes were identified on 13,031 of these contigs, totaling 31.3 Mbp. Alignment of protein sequence blocks
conserved among V. destructor and four other arthropod genomes indicated a higher level of sequence divergence
within this mite lineage relative to the tick Ixodes scapularis. A number of microbes potentially associated with
V. destructor were identified in the sequence survey, including ~300 Kbp of sequence deriving from one or more
bacterial species of the Actinomycetales. The presence of this bacterium was confirmed in individual mites by PCR
assay, but varied significantly by age and sex of mites. Fragments of a novel virus related to the Baculoviridae were
also identified in the survey. The rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pooled mites was
estimated to be 6.2 × 10-5per bp, a low rate consistent with the historical demography and life history of the
species.
Conclusions: This survey has provided general tools for the research community and novel directions for
investigating the biology and control of Varroa mites. Ongoing development of Varroa genomic resources will be
a boon for comparative genomics of under-represented arthropods, and will further enhance the honey bee and
its associated pathogens as a model system for studying host-pathogen interactions.

Background
Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are an important agricultural commodity providing honey, other bee products,
and pollination services [1,2]. Domesticated honey bees
in the United States and elsewhere have been in decline
in recent years, despite an increasing need for honey
bee pollination services [3]. This fact is often blamed on

increasing challenges from pests and pathogens, as well
as episodes of severe decline such as the enigmatic ‘colony collapse disorder’ (CCD) [4].
Among the most detrimental of honey bee pests is the
ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor [5]. V. destructor and
its closely related congener, V. jacobsoni, are native to Asia
where they parasitize the Eastern honey bee, A. cerana.
V. destructor was only identified as a morphologically and
genetically distinct species from V. jacobsoni relatively
recently [6]. V. destructor began to appear in Asian colonies of A. mellifera during the last century and is now

widely distributed, inadvertently aided by trade in bees and
bee products.
Mite-infested bee colonies suffer directly from parasitism of pupae and adults, and indirectly from viral and
microbial pathogens that the mites vector [7,8]. Feeding
by mites induces an immunosupression in bees that
leads to increased titres of pre-existing infections [9],
further compounding their impact. The economic toll of
V. destructor on apiculture is estimated to be millions of
U.S. dollars per year, and chemical control agents are
worrisome both for their collateral effects on bee health
and the potential for honey contamination [10].
Varroa-honey bee interactions are mediated to a large
extent via chemical cues, and bees have numerous
mechanisms to control Varroa populations (reviewed in
[5,11]). Varroa mites reproduce on honey bee pupae,
using chemical signals produced by the developing
honey bee larvae to target appropriately aged hosts. The
mature female offspring of reproductive Varroa emerge
with the adult honey bee, and subsequently move to
nurse bees (which are engaged in brood care), thereby
allowing them to remain in close proximity to the brood
[12,13]. Honey bees resist ‘Varroatosis’, the infestation
of colonies by Varroa mites, via grooming of adult
infested bees, removal of infested pupae (hygienic behavior), and physiological resistance mechanisms [5].
Recent successes in breeding Varroa-resistant bees,
including the selection of ‘Russian’ bees with longstanding exposure to mites [14,15], indicate that a better
understanding of how bees and mites interact with each
other can lead to novel management strategies.
Comparative studies of the fragility of the A. mellifera V. destructor interaction, which has apparently prevented
most Asian lineages of V. destructor as well as other Varroa species from colonizing A. mellifera [6,16-18], supports the hypothesis that mite olfaction or other
requirements for mite reproduction may be suitable control targets. A molecular-genetic approach to develop
such innovative controls would clearly benefit from
further insights into Varroa genomics, which could be
exploited in conjunction with tools already extant for
honey bee. Prior to this study, genes for only two nonmitochondrial V. destructor proteins had been deposited
in GenBank, a sodium channel gene (AAN37408.1) and a
glycoprotein (ACU30143.1). Genome sequencing will
greatly expand this gene catalog, and may also uncover
unforeseen targets for novel and specific acaricides, such
as divergence in metabolic pathways between mites and
bees or the discovery of important microbial interactions.
High-throughput, shotgun sequencing of whole genomes allows the rapid identification of thousands of
genic sequences, greatly facilitating molecular and population-genetic studies that would otherwise proceed in
piecemeal and laborious fashion. Here we report an

initial sequence survey of the V. destructor genome in
conjunction with a flow-cytometric estimate of genome
size. Our annotations and analysis should aid investigators seeking molecular approaches to mite control. They
will also provide a guide for a planned full genome project for this species [19], one of several genomics initiatives that are unfolding the molecular interactions
between honey bees and a constellation of potentially
interacting pathogens [4,7,20,21].
Of the eight genetically distinct lineages of V. destructor that parasitize A. cerana in Asia, two have been identified on A. mellifera [6,18,22,23]. Anderson [24]
designated these lineages the Japan (J) and Korea (K)
‘haplotypes’ in reference to mitochondrial DNA makers,
but they are concordantly distinct at nuclear markers as
well [23]. Genetic differentiation within lineages is low
[23], likely reflecting the population-genetic impact of
life-history traits [5] such as full-sib mating and male
haploidy [25], as well as potential population bottlenecks
tied to host-shift events and subsequent range expansion
[18,23]. In this study, we have analyzed the K haplotype
of V. destructor from A. mellifera, the predominant haplotype presently found in North America [23]. We have
identified over 13,000 contigs with sequences homologous to other species; many of these have recognized
domains and/or functional annotations transferred from
other arthropods. Interestingly, V. destructor appears to
have experienced a higher rate of protein evolution than
Ixodes scapularis since their divergence from the most
recent common ancestor over 300 million years ago.
Sequences attributable to a range of microbes were identified, including a large number of sequences from one or
more novel actinomycete bacteria, the presence of which
was confirmed by PCR in individual mites but not in
adult honey bees. We also identified a novel virus related
to the Baculoviridae that was abundant in the genomic
survey. Finally, we found a low level of nucleotide polymorphism in the sequenced sample of ~1,000 mites, consistent with expectation [23]. This bodes well for future
efforts to sequence and assemble a reference genome for
this species and to identify genetic variation that correlates with host-interaction traits among Varroa strains
and species.

Results
Genome size

Flow cytometry of V. destructor nuclei (normalized to
nuclei of Drosophila virilis) yielded a haploid genome
size estimate of 565 ± 3 Mbp (Figure 1). This genome
size is larger than that of many insects but substantially
smaller than that of numerous mites and ticks for which
genome projects are underway or have been proposed
(> 2,000 Mbp, [26]. It is also lower than the general
range for ticks, which spans from roughly 1,000 Mbp in

in the ixodid hard tick Amblyomma americanum [27].
However, examples of very small acarid genomes are
known. Most notably, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, which has been advocated as a model
for genetic and developmental studies of chelicerates
[28]), has an estimated genome size of only 75 Mbp. It
is not yet clear to what extent these large differences in
genome size are driven by variation in gene content,
repetitive fraction, and/or ploidy. While the contributions of the latter two factors have been frequently
noted, the potential contribution of gene expansion has
been highlighted by recent analyses of waterflea [29]
and pea aphid [30]that reveal a roughly two-fold
increase in gene content relative to other arthropods.

estimated genome size of 565 Mbp. Table 1 provides
statistics for this assembly before and after removing
problematic or undesired sequences (detailed below).
The modest contig lengths are primarily a consequence
of low coverage, as over 97% of contigs greater than 1
Kbp terminate due to coverage gaps rather than ambiguity from repetitive sequences. In fact, contig lengths
were comparable to that expected (~3,860 bp) for an
idealized assembly of equivalent coverage and read
length, following the method of [32].

V. destructor required the collection of large numbers of

resulting assembly had a realized median contig coverage of 4.3×, but was highly fragmented and summed to

mites from multiple honey bee colonies in order to
obtain sufficient DNA for this survey. While mites were
carefully cleaned and examined under a dissection
microscope to remove any non-target organisms that
might have been collected inadvertently, whole-organism
extractions necessarily entail the possible inclusion of
associated microbes, particularly gut microbes. The gut
flora may include symbiotic, commensal, and pathogenic
prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which are often important
components of the ecology of arthropod species. We
therefore filtered the assembled contigs based on G+C
content, coverage, and sequence homology, in order to
minimize the mis-annotation of microbial sequences as
V. destructor, as well as to identify novel microbes of
interest. Comparable strategies have been successfully
applied to the classification of metagenomic samples
(e.g., [33]).
We first examined the distribution of contig-mean
coverage versus length (Figure 2), which revealed relatively few outliers, and these were found to be enriched
in mitochondrial and ribosomal sequences. Thus, the
vast majority of the assembled contigs do not appear to
contain many collapsed nuclear repeats. Based on the

Page 4 of 15

observed median and variance of coverage (Figure 2),
we excluded contigs with less than 2× coverage and
greater than 10× coverage, as well as contigs less than
300 bp in length, from the analyzed V. destructor
assembly.
We then examined G+C content of contigs (Figure 3),
which suggested that Varroa nuclear DNA falls largely
between 32-58% G+C content (40.9% G+C on average).
Contigs with lower G+C content and higher coverage
showed strong homology to mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA sequences previously reported for V. destructor, as would be expected. Contigs with higher G+C
consistently showed higher sequence similarity to bacterial sequences than to arthropod sequences. For example, Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of contigs with
BLASTX matches to the high G+C bacterial order Actinomycetales at an expectation of 10-8, plotted as a function of length and G+C content of contigs. Of these
contigs, only those above approximately 58% G+C content were better matches (by sequence similarity and
E-value) to Actinomycetales than to arthropods, or
lacked an arthropod match entirely. Based on these considerations, we removed contigs outside the range of

Figure 2 Scatterplot of contig coverage versus length for the unfiltered assembly. Fold sequence coverage of assembled contigs is
distributed relatively narrowly around the mean, with few outliers. Contigs with coverage within the range 2-10× (shaded green) were included
for further analysis as putative nuclear genomic contigs of V. destructor (see text for details). Short, high-coverage contigs are predominantly
mitochondrial or ribosomal in nature. A cluster of longer contigs approximately with 30-50× coverage appear to derive from a baculovirus (see
text); contigs in this coverage range are shaded in yellow.

Figure 3 Scatterplot of contig G+C content versus coverage. Scatterplot of contig G+C content versus fold sequence coverage shows a
clear mode of G+C content in the range of 32-56%. The long tail of low G+C contigs includes low-complexity sequences such as AT repeats, as
well as mitochondrial and ribosomal contigs. A secondary mode of high G+C contigs is also apparent; these contigs include many BLAST
matches to the bacterial order Actinomycetales (see text).

best GenBank match overall. There is a clean separation between contigs with lower G+C that are more similar, by percent identity and
expectation of BLASTX sequence alignments, to arthropod sequences and contigs with higher G+C that are more similar to actinomycete
sequences.

32-58% G+C from the analyzed V. destructor assembly
unless they contained a superior match to a eukaryotic
sequence in GenBank at an expectation of 10-8. Additional filtering was performed as described in the Methods to specifically remove sequences from organisms
that were considered potential contaminants a priori,
such as known microbial pathogens of honey bees that
are dispersed as spores.
Actinomycete discovery

The strong secondary mode of high G+C contigs in
Figure 3 and taxonomically coherent BLAST hits
(Figure 4) suggests that one or more Actinomycete
species were particularly abundant in the sequenced
sample. Together these contigs totaled ~300 Kbp of
sequence, which were further analyzed with the BLAST2GO annotation tool [34]. Additional file 1 includes
BLAST2GO output that summarizes the distribution of
BLASTX hits among these contigs with respect to
matched species, expectation, and sequence similarity.
All of the most frequently matched organisms are
members of Actinomycetales. Ribosomal sequences
were also found that had strong similarity to this
clade, the closest match (98% identity) being to the
genus Segniliparus.
To further investigate the distribution of this bacterium in Varroa mites, we designed primers specific to a
homolog of translation initiation factor TIF-3. These
primers amplified the target sequence from DNA of
individual mites, as confirmed by sequencing of the
amplicon. The rate of infection in a sample of mites
(see Methods) is shown in Table 2. Rates of infection
varied significantly (P < 0.01, c2 test) by age and sex.
Mature females were infected more often than males
(61% versus 33%). We did not detect the infection in a
small sample of eggs and it was rare in nymphs (11%).
These data suggest that horizontal transmission of the
bacteria occurs within capped cells (from which males
do not leave). We were not able to amplify the target
from A. mellifera DNA extracted from adult bee abdomens, either with these primers or another pair targeting an ABC transporter gene (see Methods). Given the

intimacy of Varroa mites with their hosts, this result
suggests that the bacterium has some specificity to Varroa. While additional surveys at broader geographical
scales are needed to confirm and extend these conclusions, the amount of sequence classified as actinomycete
is remarkable given that common microbial components
of the arthropod gut flora [35] (e.g., the Enterobacteriaceae) were not strongly evident in the initial assembly
(see Methods). However, as the mites were not surface
sterilized prior to extraction of genomic DNA, it is
unclear whether the infection is topical or internal.
Baculovirus discovery

Curiously, the longest contig in the initial assembly was
among those filtered due to high coverage across its
entire length (a mean of 56×). In fact, this contig is part
of a distinct group visible in Figure 2 that have mean
coverage around 50×, sloping down to ~30× as contig
length decreases (a frequently observed phenomenon
attributable to low-coverage at contig ends). We therefore investigated whether contigs ≥ 1 Kbp in length and
with 30-60× coverage were of a consistent type, such as
microbial DNA or a class of repetitive sequence (e.g.,
ribosomal genes or transposable elements). BLASTX
and Pfam [36] searches indicated that these high coverage contigs derive from a novel baculovirus. Baculoviruses are large DNA viruses that are common in
certain arthropod taxa and often have strong impacts on
host survival (reviewed by [37]). Known baculoviruses
range from 80 to 180 kb in length and typically encode
more than 100 ORFs, some of which are putatively
specific to Baculoviridae. Indeed, several baculovirusspecific domains were detected among the 216 methionine-initiated ORFs greater than 90 amino-acids in
length that were found on these high-coverage contigs
(Table 3). Domains related to viral genome replication
as well as other domains previously reported in Baculoviridae were also found. The baculovirus Spodoptera
litura NPV appears to be the most similar viral species
overall in GenBank, as there were strong matches to
ribonucleotide reductase subunits RR1 and RR2 and
weaker matches to a number of other peptides of this
viral species. A number of ORFs encoding low-complexity proteins were identified from these high-coverage
contigs, but it remains unclear which of these, if any,
are viral in nature (all filtered contigs and predicted
ORFs are given in Additional file 2). PCR primers specific to two separate loci (see Methods) confirmed the
presence of these sequences in the original sample pool,
but we were able to amplify these loci from only two of
fifty individual mites collected at different times from
the same colonies as the sequenced sample. Thus, the
putative baculovirus-like sequences do not appear to be
common in V. destructor, although we can infer from

their high coverage in the initial assembly that high
titres are sometimes achieved. This result also demonstrates that these sequences are not integrated into the
V. destructor genome. Because baculoviruses are important tools for arthropod transgenics and biocontrol
[38,39], efforts to clarify the nature of this virus and its
hosts are underway.
V. destructor annotation and evolutionary comparison
with other arthropods

We used BLASTX (for genomic contigs) and BLASTP
(for ORFs of 90 residues or more) to identify genic
sequences in the assembly. Sequences were initially
searched against a database of five arthropod peptide
predictions (Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Pediculus humanus [a representative non-Dipteran
insect], Daphnia pulex, and I. scapularis), with a minimum expectation of 10-8, and then secondarily against

the eukaryotic Refseq database at the same expectation.
In total, 13,031 contigs were identified with BLASTdetected similarity to database sequences (listed in Additional file 3). These contigs had a median length of
1,967 bp and summed to 31.3 Mbp, and represent
roughly 10% of the total assembled sequence (294 Mbp
after filtering). ORFs with significant Pfam domains are
listed in Additional file 4 and the sequences are provided in Additional file 5.
These annotated gene fragments are necessarily an
incomplete accounting of the number and type of genes
in V. destructor, given the limitations of the assembly
and lack of transcriptome data. Additional genomic
resources are needed for robust gene models and are in
development [19]. However, we used two approaches to
infer how well represented Varroa protein-coding genes
are in this survey. We first identified ORFs that were
putatively homologous to enzymes of the glycolysis/

gluconeogenesis pathway, using KEGG-annotated pathway components [40] from the mosquito, Anopheles
gambiae, and the tick, I. scapularis, as BLAST queries.
I. scapularis is the most closely related organism to
V. destructor for which an extensively annotated genome
sequence exists [41]. We identified 19 putative pathway
components in our search (Table 4), whereas there are
21 members in I. scapularis and 23 in A. gambiae. A
second, similar approach to assessing how well
V. destructor genes were represented in the assembly
was to query all predicted ORFs against the CEGMA set
of hidden Markov models of evolutionarily conserved
proteins [42]. A Hmmer [43] search found matches for
303 of the 458 protein models available, at an E-value
threshold of 1.0 (matches at this level also had BLASTP
matches in GenBank with E-values less than 10-10). The

same search performed on I. scapularis predicted proteins found matches for 429 models. Given that ORFs
are proxies for single coding exons, both approaches
used here are likely to under-sample V. destructor coding sequences. These comparisons nonetheless suggest
that a majority of the coding potential of V. destructor
was captured in this survey, if in fragmented form.
However, they also indicate that comparisons of genefamily or protein-domain abundance in V. destructor
relative to other arthropods may be premature.
We used RepeatMasker [44] to characterize the distribution of protein-coding transposable element classes in
V. destructor, which are summarized in Table 5. The
Mariner class of DNA transposon was by far the most
abundant transposable element identified. Some retrotransposons were also common, particularly gypsy-type

long-terminal-repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and LINEs
(long interspersed nuclear elements). Helitrons, which
replicate by a rolling-circle method, were also numerous.
Given the quasi-clonal nature of the K and J haplotypes
of V. destructor[23], comparative re-sequencing of these
two groups could uncover recently active transposable
elements. Active elements are of interest because they
are important contributors to genome evolution, including the creation of novel host genes [45], and have utility for functional genomics [46].
Although the I. scapularis genome should be a valuable guide for homology-based gene prediction in
V. destructor, these lineages are estimated to have
diverged 336 ± 26 million years ago [47]. It is therefore
of interest to assess the level of sequence divergence
between these two taxa, as well as the divergence of
these Acari from other model arthropods. We identified
730 peptide blocks, averaging 128 residues in length,
that were conserved between putative orthologs in these
two species and among their closest homologs in
Da. pulex, Dr. melanogaster, and P. humanus. We then
calculated the average genetic distance among species
for each block, using the JTT substitution matrix [48]
and weighted by block length (see Methods). The
unrooted dendrogram derived from a total of 94,146
aligned positions is shown in Figure 5. The V. destructor
branch (0.42333) is substantially longer than the I. scapularis branch (0.26667) from their shared common
ancestor, implying a high rate of amino-acid evolution

in the Varroa lineage and/or a low rate of amino-acid
evolution in the Ixodes lineage. Note that this distancebased approach does not require specifying a nucleotide
substitution model or correcting for multiple substitutions; the branch lengths are approximately proportional
to the product of the time since divergence and the
branch-specific rate of molecular evolution (see [49] for
a discussion). Furthermore, the branching order of these
taxa are well-supported by independent data [50,51]. Of
course, this result is averaged across many loci and does
not necessarily represent the pattern of sequence divergence at any given gene. It remains to be seen whether
other gene features, such as exon structure, have also
evolved at a comparably divergent rates.
Nucleotide polymorphism in V. destructor

Life-history traits of V. destructor [5] that act to reduce
genetic polymorphism within family lineages include male
haploidy [25] and a predominance of full-sib mating.
Genetic variation within a population can nonetheless be
high in principle if populations are admixtures of distinct
lineages. High-frequency polymorphisms, whether due to
admixture or heterozygosity, can cause difficulties for
shotgun assembly algorithms because they weaken the
computational discrimination of allelic and non-allelic
sequences. On the other hand, polymorphisms may be
useful as genetic markers for population-genetic studies. It
is therefore of interest to estimate levels of genetic polymorphism in the sequenced sample (~1,000 mites drawn
from three adjacent colonies). We used the program
SWAP454 [52] to estimate the occurrence of moderate- to
high-frequency SNPs, i.e. those present in reads at a minimum ratio of 0.1 to the assembly reference base. SNP calls
also required a minimum of two reads with the alternative
base, but did not require reads in both directions. Polymorphisms meeting these parameters occurred at a rate of
6.2 × 10-5 per base pair. Given a median per-contig coverage of 5.0× in the final assembly (Table 1), our ability to
detect low frequency polymorphisms is of course limited,
but such polymorphisms contribute much less ambiguity
to genome assembly.
To further investigate the potential for sequence polymorphism within a V. destructor population, we identified trinucleotide microsatellite loci in the genomic
sequence and obtained amplification products for ten of
these (see Methods). Consistent with our estimate of
SNP frequency, we found no polymorphism at these loci
in 65 individual mites collected from research apiaries at
the USDA-ARS facility in Beltsville, Maryland, the
source of the genome survey pool.

V. destructor is considered the most damaging honeybee pest and has become widespread since its host shift

from A. cerana less than a century ago. Resistance to
common acaricides has already appeared [53], and the
development of new control strategies are hampered by
our limited knowledge of the V. destructor - A. mellifera
interaction, particularly at the genetic level. The present
genome survey makes available a large number of genic
sequences for analysis and manipulation by the community of researchers. The contigs we obtained from lowcoverage shotgun sequencing were short, as expected,
such that few complete gene models are likely to be
annotated from this data set. Nonetheless, our assembly
enables the identification of genes of interest and the
cloning of complete transcripts as they are needed. The
assembly will also greatly assist the validation and annotation of transcriptome surveys and can support proteomic initiatives. We hope the resources provided here
will aid investigators already tackling the problem of
mite control with molecular methods as well as encourage the involvement of others.
Genetic approaches to the study of mite control are
promising for a number of reasons. Successful reproduction of Varroa mites requires precise coordination with
the care of honey bee brood and a sophisticated evasion
of honey bee defences. Chemosensory genes are among
those likely to play crucial roles in this process. At the
phenotypic level, there is known variation among Varroa
haplotype groups and species in their ability to successfully parasitize A. mellifera [16,17], as well as known variation in the resistance of honey bee strains [14,15,54,55].
While Varroa mites are not tractable to controlled
crosses, associative mapping of traits such as reproductive success on different hosts remains an attractive

possibility, as is the mapping of resistance traits in honey
bee. Resequencing efforts are needed to uncover genetic
variation that can be exploited for these purposes. Those
efforts would also contribute to a better understanding of
the demographic history of V. destructor and to species
relationships within the genus. Polymorphic markers
within haplotype groups would aid investigations of the
population biology of the species, particularly in light of
the difficulty of observing or manipulating Varroa mites
in their habitat. For example, estimates of outcrossing
and migration might be relevant to the design of new
mitigation strategies, particularly if the evolution of resistance traits is expected. While consistent with previous
work [23] that found low genetic polymorphism within
the predominant V. destructor lineage, our analysis nonetheless enables genome-scale mining of markers for
population-genetic studies.
Our analysis of conserved peptide blocks showed a
higher rate of protein evolution within the Varroa lineage relative to Ixodes. It remains to be clarified
whether this level of sequence divergence is characteristic of mites or peculiar to the Varroa lineage. Similarly, whether this result correlates with divergence in
other aspects of genome evolution, such as exon structure and regulatory features, will be an important
question to pursue as annotations improve for both
species. As genomic resources for V. destructor continue to improve, opportunities for evolutionary comparisons with other arthropods will be enriched. Such
comparisons are of tremendous value because they can
expose conserved elements that might otherwise elude
detection by direct experiment, and they reveal the

Cornman et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:602
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/602

relative rates at which various classes of homologous
sequence diverge. Varroa mites and others in the Parasitiformes comprise a lineage that diverged from ixodid
ticks over 300 million years ago [56], while the chelicerates as a whole branched from the insects and crustacea 725 million years ago [57]. Consequently, as a
representative of the Parasitiformes, Varroa provides a
key evolutionary landmark for comparative studies
across arthropods currently targeted for genomic
analyses.
An accessory goal of genome projects targeting
arthropod pests is the identification of novel microbes
and viruses that may be relevant to the epidemiology of
vectored diseases, or that lend themselves to biocontrol
programs. A significant finding of this study was the discovery of an actinomycete bacterium that infects
V. destructor at intermediate frequencies (albeit presumably at high titer given its abundance in the genome
sequence) but apparently does not infect A. mellifera at
appreciable levels. However, these findings are preliminary and await a more systematic survey of infection
among mites and bees. Future research should also be
directed toward isolating this bacterium and assessing
the fitness consequences of infection. Further characterization of the putative baculovirus identified in this survey is similarly a priority.
This work contributes to the relatively small body of
genomic studies to date that have applied next-generation
sequencing to a complex eukaryotic genome phylogenetically distant from other reference genomes. As the costs
and technical requirements for genome sequencing continue to decline, such studies will undoubtedly become
commonplace. In many cases, the sequencing of a single
genotype or inbred group will not be feasible, and there
may also be a significant metagenomic contribution from
associated microbes. While these factors introduce new
challenges, our results underscore the utility of these
methods for rapidly advancing the study of non-model
organisms.

Conclusions
Our results have provided general tools for the research
community and novel directions for investigating the
biology and control of Varroa mites. Ongoing development of Varroa genomic resources will be a boon for
comparative genomics of under-represented arthropods,
and will further enhance the honey bee and its associated pathogens as a model system for studying hostpathogen interactions.
Methods
Genome-size estimation

Samples were prepared for flow cytometry as previously
described [27]. For each replicate, the synganglion of a

Page 11 of 15

mature female V. destructor was placed along with the
head of a mature female D. virilis into a 2 ml tissue grinder (Kimble-Kontes) containing 1 ml of cold Galbraith
buffer, and stroked 15 times with the A pestle to release
nuclei. The preparation was filtered through 20 μm nylon
and stained with prodidium iodide to a final concentration of 50 ppm. Stained samples were held on ice in the
dark for 1-2 hr prior to analysis. The mean fluorescence
of stained nuclei in replicate preparations of Varroa and
D. virilis standard was quantified using a Coulter Epics
Elite flow cytometer (Coulter Electronic), with excitation
provided by a laser tuned at 488 nm and 25 mW. PI
fluorescence at > 615 nm was detected by a photomultiplier screened by a long pass filter. To ensure that scoring included only intact nuclei free from cytoplasmic
tags, counting was activated by red fluorescence (discrimination), and only (gated) nuclei with low forward and
side scatter were included in the analysis. The positions
of sample peaks relative to the D. virilis peak were verified by running samples without a standard. DNA content was determined from co-preparations as the ratio of
the 2C Varroa peak to the 2C D. virilis peak times the
1C genome size of D. virilis (333 Mb, after [58]).
Sample preparation and sequencing

V. destructor mites were collected on two occasions for
sequencing from infested colonies of the USDA-ARS
Bee Research Laboratory apiaries in Beltsville, MD, USA
in October, 2008. For each collection, 300 bees were
placed into a 0.5 liter glass jar containing 40 g confectioner’s sugar. The sugar and bees were thoroughly
mixed by shaking the jar for 30 s. The sugar and phoretic mites were then separated from their bee hosts by
shaking the jar contents through a 1 mm wire mesh
placed at the jar opening. Mites were shaken into a
small water bath, which was then poured through a
cheesecloth filter and rinsed twice with sterile water to
remove residual sugar. Live mites were then picked onto
sterile tissue paper and frozen at -80°C until nucleic
acid extraction.
To obtain sufficient high-quality DNA for six pyrosequencing runs, three separate DNA extractions were
made from the collected mites. DNA from one sample
of ~400 mites was extracted with DNAzol (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. A second
sample of ~400 mites was homogenized in 800 μl proteinase K buffer (10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM
ethylenediamenetetracetic acid (EDTA), and 10 μg/ul
proteinase K) and incubated 60 min at 55°C, vortexing
every 20 min. Afterwards, 180 μl of 8 M potassium acetate was added and the sample incubated on ice for 30
min. After high-speed centrifugation, DNA was precipitated from the supernatant with ethanol and re-suspended in distilled, deionized water. A third sample of

Cornman et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:602
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/602

~200 mites was homogenized in 500 μl hexadecyltrimethylammonuim bromide (CTAB) buffer (100 mM
Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, 1.4 M NaCl, 2%
CTAB, and 0.2% b-mercaptoethanol) and incubated
60 min at 65°C, vortexing every 20 min. An equal
volume of 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol was then
added and the sample centrifuged at high speed. DNA
was precipitated from the supernatant with isopropanol
and re-suspended in distilled, deionized water. For all
extractions, DNA concentration and quality were evaluated with a Nanodrop ND-8000 spectrophotometer and
were found to be comparable. DNA quality was also
checked by gel electrophoresis.
Pyrosequencing was performed at the Institute for
Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of
Medicine, on a Genome Sequencer FLX instrument
(454 LifeSciences) using GS-FLX titanium reagents.
DNA was prepared for emulsion PCR according to the
manufacturer’s protocols.
Assembly and analysis

Contigs were assembled with the CABOG package of
Celera Assembler version 5.2 [31]. The sequences were
assembled iteratively, adjusting the assumed error rate
incrementally between 0% and 6%. The assembly
selected for analysis used a 1.5% error rate because this
value maximized the length of the longest contig (18.7
Kbp). The weighted median N50 contig size was relatively stable across iterations at ~2.1 Kbp, meaning that
half of the assembled bases were consistently contained
in contigs of this size or larger across the different
assemblies.
Contigs were screened to identify sequences of organisms that were considered potential contaminants
a priori. For example, a number of contigs were found to
be nearly identical to the honey bee reference genome
[59]. These fragments included low-copy genic sequences
as well as ribosomal, nongenic, and mitochondrial
sequence. PCR primers specific to A. mellifera sequences
amplified genomic DNA extracted from adult female
mites but not from embryos (data not shown), implying
that the source of A. mellifera contamination is bee
hemolymph consumed by mites. In contrast, searches
against the genome sequences [21] of chalkbrood (Ascosphaera apis), a fungal pathogen of honey bees, and
American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae), a bacterial
pathogen, did not reveal the presence of these spore-dispersed microbes in the sample.
All contigs were also screened for general bacterial
contamination by searching ORFs of 90 codons or more
against the RAST [60] seed database of bacterial
sequences. ORFs were identified with the getorf program
of the EMBOSS package [61]. ORFs with significant
matches to the RAST database were then searched by

Page 12 of 15

BLASTP against the full GenBank nr database to determine the most closely matching organism. Candidate
microbial sequences are summarized in Table 6. As
expected (see Results), matches to the phylum Actinobacteria are the vast majority. Among the small number
of BLASTP matches to other bacterial groups, the genera Burkholderia (b-proteobacteria) and Pseudomonas
(g-proteobacteria) were the most represented taxa.
Because many organisms show distinct patterns of
codon usage [62], we compared codon usage for ORFs
from unfiltered contigs (putatively V. destructor) with
those from putatively bacterial contigs. Only ORFs with
BLAST-supported homology to GenBank sequences
were used for this comparison. We used the program
INCA [63] to plot the codon-usage statistic ‘B’ of [62] as
a function of third-position G+C (GC3) content (Additional file 6). The value of B for a given ORF is a measure of how similar its codon usage is to the overall
codon usage in the data set. GC3 is considered here
because third positions are much less constrained by
protein function than first and second positions, and
thus more indicative of background composition biases.
The distinct patterns observed for the two groups of
ORFs provide complementary evidence that these
sequences do in fact derive from different organisms.
The plot also shows that a few ORFs from contigs considered to be Varroa by our filtering methods may in
fact be bacterial in nature and merit further evaluation.
Of course, BLAST-supported ORFs are only proxies for
transcripts and thus individual points may be highly
inaccurate. In general, however, genic sequences that are
putatively from V. destructor have a cohesive pattern of
codon usage that can be distinguished form at least
some bacterial contaminants, regardless of detectable
homology.
To confirm the presence in mites of the actinomycete
bacterium and DNA virus identified in the assembly, individual eggs, nymphs, female adults, and male adults were

collected from parasitized honey bee pupae. DNA for PCR
was extracted from individual samples by grinding them
in 200 μl of 5% Chelex-100 solution (Bio-Rad), incubating
at 65°C for 30 min, pelleting the mixture by high-speed
centrifugation, and taking a 1:10 dilution in water of the
resulting supernatant. Primers for the putative actinomycete TIF3 locus were CCGATCTCGACCTTGTGGAA
(forward) and CTCGGAACATGATCGTCACC (reverse),
and for the ABC locus were GAGGTCCTCGTCTCCGAATG (forward) and CGATGTCCTGGATCCTCTGG
(reverse). The amplified TIF3 product was confirmed by
Sanger sequencing (GenBank:GU365869). Primers
designed to amplify the putative Baculovirus targeted a
ribonucleotide reductase small subunit gene (forward
ACGAACGACTATCTAGCCATGAAC and reverse
GTCCGTTTCGGAGTGCATGAC) and a thymidylate
synthase gene (forward CGCATGTACCAACAACTCGTAC and reverse CACAGTTGGTGTAGCGCAGT). The
identities of these products were also confirmed by Sanger
sequencing (GenBank:GU980896 and GenBank:
GU980897, respectively). All PCR reactions were performed using standard reagents and thermocycler protocols, with an annealing temperature of 54°C.
To identify conserved peptide blocks, we first identified
V. destructor ORFs that were reciprocal best BLASTP
matches with I. scapularis predicted peptides. These
were then used to identify the closest homologs in
Da. pulex, Dr. melanogaster, and P. humanus. Sequences
were aligned by ClustalW and then trimmed to include
only blocks of well conserved, unambiguously aligned
sequence for which we could have reasonable confidence
of orthology. Genetic-distance matrices were calculated
for each block with the protdist program of the PHYLIP
package [64], weighted by alignment length and summed,
then normalized to a maximum distance of one.
Unrooted dendrograms were constructed with the fitch
and neighbor programs of the PHYLIP package, giving
virtually identical branch lengths; the neighbor-joining
dendrogram is shown in Figure 5.
Microsatellite loci used to assess polymorphism levels
in V. destructor are characterized in Additional file 7.
PCR amplifications consisted of 1 U Taq DNA polymerase with appropriate buffer, 1 mM dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2,
0.2 μM of each forward and reverse primer in a final
reaction volume of 5 μl. Fluorescently labeled primers
were mixed with unlabeled primers at a 12:20 ratio.
Thermocycling was performed as follows: 96°C for 2
min., then 3 cycles of 96°C for 30 sec., 60°C for 30 sec.
(-1°C/Cycle), 65°C for 1 min., followed by 35 cycles of
96°C for 30 sec., 56°C for 30 sec., 65°C for 1 min, and a
final extension at 65°C for 2 min. PCR products were
diluted 1:20 and 1 μl of this dilution was added to 10
μL formamide containing the LIZ size standard. Products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using

an Applied Biosystems 3730XL instrument. Allele sizes
were scored using ABI GeneMapper version 3.7
(Applied Biosystems).
