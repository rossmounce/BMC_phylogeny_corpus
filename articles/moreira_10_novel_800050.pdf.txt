Abstract
Background: Citrus canker is a disease that has severe economic impact on the citrus industry worldwide. There are
three types of canker, called A, B, and C. The three types have different phenotypes and affect different citrus species.
The causative agent for type A is Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, whose genome sequence was made available in 2002.
Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii strain B causes canker B and Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii strain C
causes canker C.
Results: We have sequenced the genomes of strains B and C to draft status. We have compared their genomic content
to X. citri subsp. citri and to other Xanthomonas genomes, with special emphasis on type III secreted effector repertoires.
In addition to pthA, already known to be present in all three citrus canker strains, two additional effector genes, xopE3
and xopAI, are also present in all three strains and are both located on the same putative genomic island. These two
effector genes, along with one other effector-like gene in the same region, are thus good candidates for being
pathogenicity factors on citrus. Numerous gene content differences also exist between the three cankers strains, which
can be correlated with their different virulence and host range. Particular attention was placed on the analysis of genes
involved in biofilm formation and quorum sensing, type IV secretion, flagellum synthesis and motility,
lipopolysacharide synthesis, and on the gene xacPNP, which codes for a natriuretic protein.
Conclusion: We have uncovered numerous commonalities and differences in gene content between the genomes of
the pathogenic agents causing citrus canker A, B, and C and other Xanthomonas genomes. Molecular genetics can
now be employed to determine the role of these genes in plant-microbe interactions. The gained knowledge will be
instrumental for improving citrus canker control.
Background
Citrus canker is a disease with worldwide distribution
that has severe economic impact on the citrus industry
[1,2]. Disease symptoms consist of water soaked lesions
that develop into blisters, then pustules, and, finally, cankers. In severe cases, citrus canker can lead to defoliation

and premature fruit drop [3]. Eradication of infected
plants is the method of choice to control the disease
where it is not yet endemic. When the disease is endemic,
control is attempted by planting disease-free trees, limiting the spread between orchards, and using preventive
copper sprays [4-6]. However, none of these measures
controls citrus canker efficiently.
There are three types of citrus canker described in the
literature: types A, B and C. Type A originated in Asia,
probably in Southern China, Indonesia or India, and it is

the type that is most widespread and causes the greatest
economic damage [4,7]. The other two types have only
been found in South America. Type B (or false canker)
was originally identified in Argentina in 1923. This type is
present only in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay [8],
whereas type C is limited to the state of São Paulo, Brazil
[9].
The causal agent of canker A is Xanthomonas citri
subsp. citri (which we abbreviate as XAC for reasons
explained below). XAC causes disease on many citrus
species, with C. paradisi (grapefruit) and C. aurantifolia
(Mexican lime) being most susceptible in the field and C.
reticulata (mandarin/tangerine) and C. sinensis (sweet
orange) being relatively tolerant [10,11]. Importantly, no
citrus species is resistant to XAC after artificial inoculation, suggesting that there is no true genetic resistance
against XAC and that field tolerance is mainly due to variation in growth habit [3].
The genome of XAC strain 306 from Brazil was completely sequenced in 2002 [12] and compared to the
genomes of Xanthomonas species that are pathogenic in
other plants [13,14]. This comparative genomics
approach has greatly accelerated the study of the molecular basis of pathogenicity and virulence of XAC. XAC has
a hrp/hrc cluster coding for a type III secretion system
(T3SS) that is used by the pathogen to inject virulence
proteins, called effectors, into host cells. While several
genes coding for putative effectors have been identified in
the XAC genome, the single most important effector is
PthA [3,15]. Even in the absence of the pathogen, PthA
induces canker-like symptoms when transiently
expressed in plants [16]. Deletion of pthA abolishes the

Page 2 of 25

ability of XAC to cause cankers [17]. Intriguingly, PthA
induces cankers in all citrus species while it triggers plant
immunity in other plant species, thus being the prime
determinant of XAC specificity toward citrus [16,18,19].
Two variant forms of canker A have been described.
The first was found in Southeast Asia in 1998 infecting C.
aurantifolia. The pathogen was classified as XAC variant
A* [19]. The second variant was isolated in 2003 in
Southern Florida in C. aurantifolia and C. macrophyla
(alemow), and was named Xanthomonas citri variant AW
[20]. AW strains have been shown to be a sub-group
within A* [20]. These strains are primarily pathogenic on
C. aurantifolia and do not cause disease on C. paradisi,
even after artificial inoculation [19,20]. A T3SS effector,
called AvrGf1, was found to contribute to the exclusion of
C. paradisi from the A* host range [21]. A recent study
[22] suggests that A* strains (including AW) have a wider
genetic diversity than the strains that cause A-type canker.
Canker B is mostly restricted to C. limon (lemon), but
has also been found in C. sinensis and in C. paradisi [8].
Its causal agent has been described as X. fuscans subsp.
aurantifolii type B (which we abbreviate as XauB for reasons explained below). Even though symptoms are similar
to canker A, they take longer to appear, perhaps reflecting the slower growth of XauB in culture when compared
to XAC. Canker C has the same symptoms as type A, but,
similarly to XAC A* and AW, it is restricted to C. aurantifolia and does not occur in C. paradisi [23]. The causal
agent has been described as X. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii
type C (which we abbreviate as XauC for reasons
explained below). Fig. 1A summarizes observed pheno-

types in three different citrus species. Recently, what
appears to be a new type of X. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii
infecting swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi Macf. × Poncirus
trifoliata L. Raf.) has been reported in Brazil [24].
XAC, XauB and XauC have been compared phenotypically and analyzed phylogenetically. All three strains present polar flagella with perceptible motility when cultured
in semi-solid media [25]. They all grow in the presence of
lactose, manitol, and celobiose. However, only XAC is
able to grow in the presence of maltose and aspartic acid,
and it is also capable of pectate and gel hydrolysis [26].
XauB and XauC have little or no affinity for polyclonal
antisera prepared against XAC, and XAC is susceptible to
bacteriophages CP1 and CP2 while XauB and XauC are
not [19]. It is notable that XauB has fastidious growth in
culture media where both XAC and XauC grow well, for
example in Agar nutrient and tryptophan-sucrose-agar
media. All three grow well in media rich in glutamic acid
[27]. Multilocus sequence typing and other molecular
analyses [28-30] have shown that XauB and XauC are
more closely related to each other than to XAC.
Under the rationale that the availability of the genome
sequences and annotations of the causative agents of the
B and C canker types can substantially improve our
understanding of the genomic basis of the disease, we
have sequenced the genomes of XauB and XauC to draft
status. We have compared them with the genomes of
XAC and other xanthomonads. Identified commonalities
among the three canker genomes represent candidate
genes that may help explain the differences between citrus canker and diseases caused by other xanthomonads.
We have also identified numerous gene differences
between the three citrus canker genomes. Some of these
genes were previously shown to contribute to the virulence of XAC [31] and are thus primary candidates for
explaining the higher virulence of XAC compared to
XauB and XauC as well as the host range differences that
exist between the three canker types.

to the three organisms collectively as the citrus canker
strains (abbreviated by CC strains/genomes).

Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows the genome features of the three canker
strains. Even though we do not have complete genome
sequences for XauB and XauC, alignments of their scaffolds to the XAC genome suggest that all three chromosomes are highly syntenic (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).
Based on these alignments and on total length of contigs
we estimate that we have obtained 94% of the XauB
genome and 96% of the XauC genome. We estimate that
the vast majority of remaining gaps in the two incomplete
genomes is under 2 kbp. Fig. 1B shows that XAC shares
74% of its protein-coding genes with the other two
strains. The fractions for XauB and XauC are 87% and
84%, respectively. The number of XAC-specific genes is
much larger than the analogous number for XauB and
XauC. Although this difference could be attributed to the
incompleteness of the Xau genomes, we have hybridization results (see below) that suggest that many of these

A note on species abbreviations

The organisms studied in this work do not have names
that are universally accepted. At the time when its
genome was sequenced, the accepted name for XAC was
Xanthomonas axonopodis subsp. citri. In the meantime,
Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri has been validly published
as a name of this organism [32,33]. However, because the
locus tag prefix of XAC genes is 'XAC' we opted for this
abbreviation to avoid confusion along the text. Similarly,
the causative agents for the B and C cankers are known by
different names, but we use XauB and XauC as acronyms
so that they are in agreement with their respective locus
tag prefixes. For the B species we use the name X. fuscans
subsp. aurantifolii type B and for the C species we use the
name X. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii type C [33]. We refer

RNAs

For each strain the numbers are totals for the chromosome plus
plasmids. The asterisk (*) denotes that the numbers for XauB and
XauC come from their respective incompletely sequenced genomes.

XAC-specific genes are indeed absent from the other two
genomes under study.
XAC strain 306 has two plasmids, pXAC33 (34 kbp)
and pXAC64 (65 kbp). Based on similarities between contig sequences and XAC plasmid sequences it appears that
both XauB and XauC have plasmids. At least 46% of plasmid pXAC33 sequence is found in XauB contigs (46% of
plasmid pXAC33 sequence is found in XauC contigs); at
least 61% of plasmid pXAC64 sequence is found in XauB
contigs (55% for XauC). We do not have enough sequence
data to ascertain the exact number of plasmids in each
Xau genome.
The phylogenetic relationship of the three strains with
respect to each other and to fully sequenced members of
the Xanthomonas and Xylella genera based on their
shared protein-coding genes is shown in Fig. 2. The tree
shows that the three organisms under study form a welldefined group within the family Xanthomonadaceae.
This tree is in agreement with trees of the Xanthomonas
genus based on multilocus sequence analysis [34,35].
At http://bioinfo.facom.ufms.br/xanthomonas we provide an interactive tool that allows user-defined gene content comparisons among all sequenced Xanthomonas
genomes.
Genes shared by all three strains but not present in other
Xanthomonadaceae species

XAC, XauB, and XauC have 65 families of orthologous
genes specific to them when compared to all other fully
sequenced members of the genera Xanthomonas and
Xylella (Additional file 2: Table S2). Among these 65 families we have identified 11 syntenic blocks. Not surprisingly, almost half of these genes code for hypothetical
proteins of unknown function. Of the genes with a predicted function the genes encoding the predicted effectors XopE3 (XAC3224) and XopAI (XAC3230) (discussed
below) are especially noteworthy. The large number of
genes coding for various kinds of transporters are also
worth mentioning: four TonB dependent receptors
including one with homology to the Escherichia coli
receptor FepA, which is involved in transport of siderophores across the bacterial membrane [36] and seven
ABC transporters, which might be used either for translocation of substrates from the citrus apoplast into the
bacterial cell to provide nutrients for the pathogen, or,
alternatively, for secretion of toxins (either bacterial toxins or expulsion of citrus metabolites toxic to the CC
strains). An additional transporter specific to the three
CC genomes (XAC3198) is an alkanesulfonate transporter substrate-binding subunit, which is reported to
enable E. coli to use sulfonates other than taurine [37].
Besides transporters, several genes encode metabolic
enzymes (an amidase, an urea amidolyase, a peptidase,
and a nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase). This conspicu-

Page 4 of 25

ous presence of transporters and metabolic enzymes suggests that the CC strains might have adapted to specific
metabolites present in the citrus apoplast. However, this
will need to be confirmed experimentally by comparing
growth of wild type strains and strains mutated in CCspecific genes in apoplastic fluid of citrus species and of
other plant species. One other interesting gene present in
all CC genomes is a gene coding for a methyl parathion
hydrolase (XAC0726), predicted to degrade the insecticide methyl parathion [38,39]. Orthologs of this gene and
other genes that degrade organophosphates are common
in soil bacteria and in the soil-borne pathogen Ralstonia
solanacearum but have not yet been found in any other
foliar plant pathogen.
Some of these syntenic CC-specific regions are anomalous in terms of nucleotide composition as determined by
the program AlienHunter [40] and may thus have been
acquired by horizontal gene transfer.
The three CC genomes have important differences in
regard to their repertoires of type III secreted effectors

The hrp/hrc genes encoding the T3SS are basically the
same and found in the same order in all three CC
genomes. However, there are notable differences in the
three putative T3SS-secreted effector repertoires.
A list of twenty-seven T3SS effector genes predicted in
the genomes of the CC strains is shown in Table 2. Effectors are important determinants of virulence and host
range in many plant pathogenic bacteria, in particular in
Xanthomonas sp. and Pseudomonas syringae [41]. Comparison of effector repertoires between the three CC
genomes and all other Xanthomonas genomes can thus
give us important clues. The effector genes avrBs2, xopL,
xopQ, and xopX are present in all three CC genomes, in
all sequenced genomes of other Xanthomonas species,
and in all X. citri and most Xanthomonas strains that
were surveyed by PCR and hybridization for these genes
by Hajri et al. [42]. These effectors thus belong to the
Xanthomonas core set of effectors possibly important for
pathogenicity on all plants. The putative effector genes
xopK, xopR, and xopZ also belong to this group since they
can be found in all sequenced Xanthomonas genomes.
However, no data exist for these effectors in regard to
other Xanthomonas strains [42]. The effector genes xopI,
xopV, xopAD, and xopAK are present in all three CC
genomes and in several, but not all, sequenced Xanthomonas genomes. These effectors, therefore, might
contribute to disease in some plant species while they
might trigger immunity in others.
As already mentioned, PthA is well known to be an
important X. citri effector that plays an essential role in
citrus canker, while limiting the host range of CC strains
to citrus because it triggers immunity in all other tested
plant species (see references above). The pthA gene is a

member of the avrBS3 family of effector genes, members
of which are present in most Xanthomonas genomes and
in some R. solanacearum genomes [43]. However, only
PthA is known to induce citrus canker. Besides pthA
(XACb0065), three paralogs of pthA are also present in
the XAC genome (XACa0022, XACa0039, and
XACb0015). All four copies are found on plasmids. The
three paralogs do not seem to play an important role in
citrus canker [18]. We found two pthA homologs in the
XauB genome (XAUB_40130 and XAUB_28490) and two
in the XauC genome (XAUC_22430 and XAUC_24060/
XAUC_09900 [the latter is a single gene with halves in
different contigs]). Not all of these genes have been completely assembled due to the repetitive regions found in
avrBS3 family members. However, El Yacoubi et al. [44]
previously assembled a pthA homolog (pthB [GenBank:
2657482]) from the pXcB plasmid [GenBank:
NC_005240] of a XauB strain with the same repeat copy
number (i.e. 17.5) as pthA, and Al-Saadi et al. [17]
sequenced and assembled another homolog (pthC [GenBank: EF473088]) from a XauC strain. These genes functionally complemented a pthA deletion in XAC without
affecting host range [17]. The XAUC_22430 gene has 99%
nucleotide identity to pthC and thus probably corresponds to pthC and would be the functional pthA
homolog of XauC. We do not have enough data to confidently report on the repeat copy number of the other
three Xau pth homologs, but a phylogenetic analysis (see
below) suggests that XAUB_28490 is the functional pthA
homolog of XauB.To get insight into the evolution of the
pthA/avrBS3 family, a phylogenetic analysis of all available avrBS3 family members in the genus Xanthomonas
was performed (Fig. 3). The tree shows that the four XAC
pth genes group together, while the XauB and XauC
genes form two families, with one member from each
strain participating in each family. Moreover, the XauB
and XauC pth genes group separately from the XAC
genes, with good bootstrap support, which is a surprising
result when compared with the species tree (Fig. 2). The
genes that flank the pth copies in XauB do not have XAC
genes as their best BLAST [45] hits. In particular, the two
genes upstream of XAUB_40130, XAUB_40110 and
XAUB_40120, do not match any Xanthomonas genes;
instead, their best BLAST hits (e-value 10-102 and 10-99,
respectively) are gene sequences from Burkholderia
pseudomallei NCTC 13177. (In XauC the pth regions are
too fragmented to allow genomic context determination.)
We derive the following conclusions from these results:
An ancestor of the current XauB and XauC strains
already had two different copies of the pth genes; hence
the existence of the two noted families. The fact that in
XAC the four copies are nearly identical, the fact that the
Xau and XAC pth genes group in a way distinctively different from the species grouping, and the fact that the

Page 8 of 25

genomic context in which the XAC pth genes are found is
different from that of XauB leads us to believe that XAC
acquired its pth genes by a different route and that their
duplication is more recent when compared to the XauB
and XauC pth duplications. The ability to cause citrus
canker may thus have independently evolved by XAC and
by XauB and XauC, and may represent an example of
convergent evolution. Al-Saadi et al. [17], based on a
neighbor-joining phylogeny of pth genes that included
the pthB and pthC sequences, have come to the same
conclusion.
Effectors XopAI and XopE3 may play a role in citrus canker

A comparison of effectors present in all three CC strains
with those present in fully sequenced Xanthomonas species, and data from the study by Hajri et al. [42], suggest
that two additional putative effectors may play a special
role in citrus canker. These are XopAI and XopE3. Both
are present in all three CC genomes.
The putative effector xopAI is not found in any other
sequenced Xanthomonas species and it was not included
in the Hajri et al. [42] analysis. We do have evidence that
it is present in Xanthomonas vesicatoria str. 1111 (Potnis
et al., unpublished). Interestingly, the C-terminal region
of XopAI has similarity to predicted ADP-ribosyl transferase domains of the effector HopO1-1 of Pseudomonas
syringae and of hypothetical proteins in Acidovorax citrulli, Ralstonia solanacearum, and other bacteria. The Nterminus has high similarity to the N-terminus of the
effector XopE2 of X. campestris pv. vesicatoria 85-10 as
well the N-termini of a number of other Xanthomonas
and Pseudomonas syringae effectors (more on the N-terminal region of xopAI below).
XopE3 belongs to the HopX/AvrPphE family of effectors. Effectors belonging to this family have been found in
diverse phytopathogenic bacteria including Ralstonia,
Pseudomonas, Acidovorax, and Xanthomonas, suggesting
their conserved role in virulence on a wide range of hosts.
Sequences from this family have similarity to the transglutaminase superfamily of enzymes, which are responsible for modification of host proteins [46]. The HopX/
AvrPphE effector from Pseudomonas syringae has been
shown to be involved in host protein proteolysis, thereby
suppressing host defenses [46,47]. In xanthomonads,
multiple effectors belonging to this group have been
found, such as xopE1, xopE2, xopE3, xopE4. XopE1 and
xopE2 have been found in most of the xanthomonads.
XopE3 effector gene homologs have been found by PCR
and dot-blot hybridization methods in some Xanthomonas axonopodis strains belonging to the alfalfae, anacardii, glycines, phaseoli, malvacearum, fuscans, mangiferae,
indicae, and citrumelo pathovars [42]. However,
sequences of xopE3 from these strains could not be compared against homologs from CC strains since sequence

Figure 4 Region containing citrus-canker specific effector genes xopE3 and xopAI. The XAC region depicted is hypothesized to be a genomic
island [14]. The central parts of this region (gray areas) are CC-specific, being present in both XauB and XauC as well as in XAC plasmid pXAC64. Gene
mltB is not an effector but plays a role in Type III secretion.

data from the X. axonopodis strains mentioned are not
currently available. Phylogenetic analysis of hopX
orthologs shows that the xopE3 effector genes found in
the CC strains group together with hopX1 effector genes
from pseudomonads (data not shown).
Although all hopX orthologs show conservation of the
catalytic triad (Cys, His, Asp residues) as well as the conserved domain "GRGN" N-terminal to the triad, the
region C-terminal to the triad shows high degree of variability. This variable region has been hypothesized to be
responsible for targeting different host proteins [46]. In
fact, while some AvrPphE (hopX) alleles from P. syringae
pv. phaseolicola strains trigger gene for gene disease
resistance in some bean cultivars, other alleles were
shown to be virulent on these same cultivars. Amino acid
differences in the C-terminal region of AvrPphE were
identified between alleles [48]. Similarly, comparing
XopE3 homologs from different strains at the amino acid
level and their corresponding reactions on different hosts
might give clues regarding the variable C-terminal
domains of XopE3 family members and might determine
whether this variability is responsible for targeting different proteins in different host species.
Both xopE3 and xopAI belong to an interesting XAC
chromosomal region of approximately 15 kbp in size (Fig.
4) that has been hypothesized to be a genomic island [14].
An alignment of the XAC chromosome sequence with

the chromosome sequences of X. campestris pv. campestris str. ATCC33913 and X. oryzae pv. oryzae str. PX099A
strongly suggests that this region is an insertion (data not
shown). The presence of three transposase genes and two
phage-related genes in the region provides additional evidence for this hypothesis. The central part of this region
(7 kbp) duplicates a region found in XAC plasmid
pXAC64 (Fig. 4), suggesting a chromosome-plasmid
DNA exchange. In the plasmid we find the effector gene
xopE2 (XACb0011), which - as described above - shares
its N-terminal region with xopAI (XAC3230) (Fig. 4).
Transposons and phage elements in this region might
thus have been responsible for a shuffling process,
described as terminal reassortment [49], resulting in the
novel effector gene xopAI. Although we can characterize
this region completely only in XAC, XauB and XauC contigs contain the most important elements of this region
(Fig. 4). Next to xopE3 (XAC3224) we find gene
XAC3225, whose product is annotated as tranglycosylase
mltB. This gene has strong similarity (e-value 10-133, 100%
coverage) to hopAJ1 fromP. syringae pv. tomato strain
DC3000, where it is annotated as a T3SS helper protein.
Although the hopAJ1 gene is not itself a T3SS substrate, it
contributes to effector translocation [50]. A mutant with
a deletion of XAC3225 has reduced ability to cause canker (mutant phenotypes include a reduction in water
soaking, hyperplasia, and necrosis compared to wild

Moreira et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:238

type) [31]. We thus conclude that the effector and effector-related genes in this region probably play an important role in citrus canker.

Additional differences in effector repertoires among CC
genomes

In addition to the pth differences noted above, other
effectors that distinguish the XAC genome from the two
Xau genomes are XopB, XopE4, XopJ (AvrXccB), XopAF
(avrXv3), and XopAG, which are all present in both Xau

Figure 5 Genomotyping and similarity analysis between the genomes of XAC and XauC based on DNA hybridization and matching of contig sequences. (A) The hybridization results showed that 2,486 CDSs (out of a total 2,760) gave a hybridization signal greater than the estimated background noise. Of the 2,486 CDSs, 2,341 (94.2%) seem to be present in XauC (ratio Cy3/Cy5 between 0 and 1.5). The remaining 145 CDSs (5.8%) seem
specific to XAC. (B) Of these 145, most (101 = 70%) belong to regions previously described as putative genomic islands in XAC (black ovals: [14]; green
ovals: [106]; yellow ovals: [31]; the oval numbering corresponds to the original publication numbering). Pink ovals mark other nonsimilar regions between the genomes of XAC and XauC. (C) The two bottommost graphs (G+C and codon bias) show variation of these two metrics along the XAC
genome, thus presenting evidence for the putative genomic islands denoted by ovals. The numbered triangles correspond to the XAC-specific regions based on DNA hybridization. Blue horizontal bars simply denote regions in these graphs that correspond to ovals not associated with XAC-specific regions. The Heat Map shows gene groups that yielded differential hybridization signals, the vast majority of which correspond to regions marked
by ovals. The zoomed-in regions in the upper diagram show genes with differential hybridization signals but that are in regions shared by the two
genomes. The XAC and XauC genes in these regions have less similarity (from 42 to 68% identity) between them than other shared genes.

Moreira et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:238

genomes but absent from XAC strain 306. (AvrXccB
homologs were found in two XAC strains by Hajri et al.
[42].) The absence of these effectors from XAC strain 306
raises the possibility that these effectors might be responsible for limiting the host range of both B and C strains.
Interestingly, XauB and XauC strains both contain
xopAG, an effector gene belonging to the same effector
family as avrGf1 from X. citri Aw, which has been shown
to be responsible for triggering a hypersensitive defense
response in C. paradisi (grapefruit) [21]. The xopAG gene
from the B and C genomes shows 44% identity to avrGf1
at the amino acid level. The XauB and and XauC genes
are almost identical to each other, with one important difference: in XauB xopAG is interrupted by a transposon.
Therefore, the incompatibility between XauC and grapefruit and the ability of XauB to cause disease in grapefruit
could be explained by this single gene difference. The
xopE4 DNA sequence is identical in the two Xau
genomes and has similarity to avrXacE3 but only with
31% identity at the amino acid level; this is why we named
this gene xopE4 instead of xopE2. Unlike other XopE family members, XopE4 does not have a predicted myristoylation site, suggesting that it may not be targeted to the
cell membrane as the other XopE family members.
Presence of an additional effector gene, the avirulence
gene avrXccA2, has been shown in some X. aurantifolii B
(CFBP3528, CFBP3530) and X. aurantifolii C
(CFBP2866) strains by hybridization and PCR analysis
[42]. However, this avirulence gene was not found in the
two sequenced Xau genomes. A homolog of the effector
xopF1 (XAUC_20070) was found only in the XauC strain.
It is located in a 5-kbp region that lies between the T3SS
genes hrpW (XAUC_20020) and hpa3 (XAUC_20080).
The same two genes are adjacent in XauB. Two transposases are present in this region, and the sequence of xopF1
has a frameshift, suggesting that this gene is likely the
result of a recent insertion and is not active.
There are four effector genes present in the XAC and
XauB genomes that have not been found in the genome of
XauC: xopE2, xopN, xopP, and xopAE. These effectors
could explain the wider host range of XAC and XauB
compared to XauC, assuming a virulence activity of these
effectors on citrus species. XopN has been shown to
interact with the plant protein TARK1 and to interfere
with immunity triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP-triggered immunity) [51]. Further
experiments are required to determine the possible role
of XopN in extending host range to lemon, grapefruit and
sweet orange. Another effector that could have a similar
role is XopAE (a hpaF/PopC homolog) [52,53].
The harpin-like protein HrpW with a pectate lyase
domain is present in all CC strains. In the sequenced
XAC genome, it is not associated with the T3SS gene
cluster, whereas in the genomes of XauB and XauC it is.

Page 12 of 25

The role of harpin-like proteins like HrpW as virulence
factors or T3SS accessory proteins has not yet been
determined in the Xanthomonas genus. Experiments will
need to be performed to confirm translocation of the
above putative effectors and their putative function as
virulence or avirulence genes.
XAC-specific genes and genomic regions with respect to
XauB and XauC

We compared the XAC genome to the XauB and XauC
genomes both computationally and by doing experimental whole genome hybridizations. Results are summarized
in Fig. 5. The results of the two methods were consistent.
In the following sections we focus on regions and genes
specific to XAC with respect to XauB and XauC according to these results.
We have identified 25 groups of at least four consecutive genes that we term XAC-specific regions (XACSR)
[Fig. 5, additional file 3 (Table S3), and additional file 4
(Fig. S4)]. Nearly all regions contain or are flanked by
transposition elements or phage-related genes, suggesting that they could be the result of lateral transfer.
Several genomic differences are related to biofilm
formation and quorum sensing

Xanthan gum is an exopolysaccharide that plays an
important role in biofilm formation and hence in virulence of pathogens of the Xanthomonadaceae family [5456]. Moreover, the synthesis of xanthan gum is regulated
by variation in sugar concentration in the culture
medium and by the activation of regulatory rpf genes
[57,58]. These genes are also responsible for the synthesis
of diffusible signal factors, fundamental molecules for
quorum sensing processes [59,60]. Both Xau genomes
contain an identical xanthan gum operon (XauC:
XAUC_26940-27060; XauB: XAUB_007400-007410 and
XAUB_10560-10450). The Xau genomes contain gene
rpfH (XAUB_10500 and XAUC_27010), but this gene is
not found in XAC. Gene rpfI, present in the xanthan gum
operon of X. campestris pv. campestris strain
ATCC33913, is absent from all three CC genomes.
XAC and the two Xau genomes contain the xanthomonadin biosynthesis regulon as well as sugar metabolism genes. XauB however presents some important
variations that may explain its in planta and in culture
fastidious phenotype, when compared to both XAC and
XauC. Differences were found in the phosphotransferase
system (PTS-Fru), which specializes in internalization of
fructose, and in the rpfN gene, a sugar porin, which is regulated by rpf genes, which also regulate xanthan gum synthesis [57]. The importance of the PTS-Fru system and of
the sugar porin encoded by the rpfN gene for growth and
pathogenicity of certain bacteria has been reported in the
literature: PTS-Fru mutants of Spiroplasma citri, caus-

campestris pv. campestris show an increase in the level of
polygalacturonate lyase [65], an important pathogenicity
factor in bacterial plant pathogens. This result shows that
the absence of the sugar porin could cause lack of carbohydrate uptake, therefore inducing the synthesis of cell
wall degrading enzymes, in order to increase sugar supply

[58,66]. In XAC the PTS system, encoded by genes
fruBKA and rpfN, is organized in one single genomic
region (XAC2501-2504) (Fig. 6). XauC presents the same
organization (XAUC_01750-01780). In XauB fruBKA
corresponds to XAUB_05120, XAUB_05110 and
XAUB_05100 respectively, but rpfN was not found. In
addition, the fruA gene sequence contains a frameshift,
indicating that it may have become a pseudogene. XauB

needs a culture medium with glutamic acid [27], possibly
because it is used by the bacterium as an alternative carbon source. Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c, which also lacks the
PTS system and the rpfN gene, is also fastidious [67].
Experiments were carried out to compare cellular
growth and xanthan gum production in all three organisms under study. Results (Table 3) confirm the fastidiousness of XauB, whereas XAC and XauC have similar
cellular mass values. We also determined that XAC produces more than twice as much gum as XauC and almost
three times as much as XauB. We believe this variation is
due to the XauB deficiencies in the rpfN and PTS-Fru
genes discussed above. On the other hand, this result also
suggests that the lack of the rpfH and rpfI genes in XAC,
caused by the presence of transposition elements [68],
does not influence the gum production capability of
XAC. The fastidiousness of XauB would thus be related
to the low gum production and the consequent decrease
in biofilm formation together with the fact that it needs
an additional substrate source (glutamate) to support its
growth in culture.
In addition to the differences noted above, five additional XAC-specific regions (XACSR7, XACSR9,
XACSR10, XACSR14 and XACSR17) may be related to
its greater biofilm-formation capability when compared
to XauB and XauC. Several of the genes in these regions
facilitate adhesion in a process mediated by hemagglutinin [69].
XACSR7 contains two hemin storage system genes,
hmsF and hmsH, and hemagglutinin coding genes
(XAC1811-1816). Genes involved with acquisition and
storage of hemin groups (hmsRFH) and type I secretion
system genes (fhaC), and their secreted hemagglutinin
(fhaB), are found in tandem and flanked by a tRNAR in
the XAC genome (Fig. 6). In Yersinia pestis the hms genes
are present in a cluster (the pgm cluster) related to temperature-dependent storage of hemin as well as expression of a number of other physiological characteristics
[70]. Mutations in these genes cause drastic decrease in
Yersinia growth, preventing it from colonizing its point of
entrance in infected flies (bucal orifice) [71,72]. These
genes also play a role in exopolysacharide synthesis, and
reduction in biolfilm formation has also been observed in
these mutants in Yersinia [73]. Among all sequenced xan-

thomonads only XAC and X. oryzae have these genes. In
both cases they are similar to (35 to 53% identity at the
amino acid level) and syntenic with their homologs in
Yersinia, E. coli K-12 and Erwinia carotovora (data not
shown).
Recent work [74] describing mutations in the genes that
code for hemagglutinin in Xylella fastidiosa strain
Temecula (Pierce's disease) has shown that biofilm composition and virulence (adhesion and colonization) were
affected in the mutants. This is consistent with results in
XAC [69]. This is evidence that the apparent absence of
these genes in XauB and XauC might have the same effect
(Fig. 6).
XACSR9 contains 19 genes. One of them (XAC1918) is
a hemolysin-related gene. In enterobacteria hemolysins
are an important virulence factor that are associated with
proteins related to biofilm formation [75,76]. The protein
encoded by this particular gene interacts with VirD4, a
Type IV secretion system component [77], which in turn
may play a role in biofilm formation and cell aggregation,
as observed for E. coli [78].
XACSR10 contains several noteworthy genes. Gene
XAC2151 codes for the YapH protein. Its homolog
(XOO2380, 84% identity at the amino acid level) in X.
oryzae pv. oryzae KACC10331 when mutated drastically
reduced the pathogen adhesion to plant tissue, thus
decreasing its virulence [79]; in addition a homolog of
this gene in X. fuscans subsp. fuscans CFBP4834-R (the
causative agent of bacterial blight of bean, Phaseolus vulgaris), was required for adhesion to seed, leaves, and abiotic surfaces [80]. XAC2197 and XAC2198 code for
hemolysin-type calcium binding proteins, whereas
XAC2201 and XAC2202 code for hemolysin secretion
protein D (HlyD) and hemolysin secretion protein B
(HlyB), respectively. The latter four genes do not have
Xanthomonas matches in the sequence databases; they
are similar instead to protein sequences from Acidovorax,
Xylella and Pseudomonas species. The best hits are from
Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae ATCC19860, which is
also a plant pathogen.
XACSR14 contains genes related to the type IV pilusdependent system (Fig. 6). This system takes part in several processes, including adhesion, motility, microcolony
formation, and protease secretion [81]. In Xylella fastidiosa functional studies of these genes have shown that
they are crucial for the host colonization process [82-86].
XACSR17 is also related to biofilm formation. Laia et al.
[31] observed decrease in biofilm activity and virulence in
four mutants with changes in this region (XAC324514G01/14G12, XAC3263-10G07/10G09, XAC328510F02 and XAC3294-17B04) (Fig. 6). The only mutated
gene with functional assignment is rhsD (XAC3245). This
gene has been described as coding for a membrane protein related to adhesion [69]. In Xanthomonas campestris

pv. campestris a RhsD protein has been found in the outer
membrane vesicle associated with other virulence-associated proteins, such as HrpA/F/X/B4, HrcU, AvrBs1 and
AvrBs2 [87]. XAC contains a paralog of this gene
(XAC2529), but it was not found in the Xau genomes
either.
Gene wapA (XAC1305), not part of any XAC-specific
region, and which is an adhesion facilitator by way of
hemagglutinins [69], was not found in either of the Xau
genomes.
XauB contains T4SS gene clusters similar to those found in
Ralstonia solanacearum and in Agrobacterium tumefaciens

In addition to the type III secretion system, the type IV
secretion system (T4SS) also plays a role in pathogenicity.
For example, this system has been shown to contribute to
full virulence in the phytopathogen X. campestris pv.
campestris strain 8004 [88]. Genome clusters containing
T4SS genes are found in several bacterial species but with
marked differences in terms of gene presence/absence
and organization, which relate to the system's function in
the organism where it is present [89,90]. All three

genomes under study contain T4SS genes, arrayed in
clusters. In order to better understand these gene clusters
we have classified the T4SS genes found in the three CC
genomes as well as T4SS gene clusters from other organisms into four groups, using as criteria presence/absence
of genes and synteny (Fig. 7). We have found important
differences between XAC and XauB using this classification; data for XauC was too fragmented to allow a similar
general observation.
As reported by da Silva et al. [12] XAC has two T4SS
clusters, one in the chromosome and the other in a plasmid (pXAC64). In XauB we found three clusters. Only
one of them is similar to a XAC cluster (the pXAC64
cluster), and was therefore placed in group II, along with
the T4SS cluster found on plasmid pXcB (already mentioned above in the context of the pth gene discussion).
The other two XauB clusters were placed in groups I and
III, respectively, while the XAC chromosome cluster was
placed in group IV (Fig. 7A).
The XauB cluster placed in group III is similar to a cluster found in Ralstonia solanacearum [91], both in terms
of organization as well as individual gene sequence simi-

protein that participates in the T3SS apparatus [41], and that causes phenotypic changes when its gene is mutated [31]. The product of gene XAC0096,
which is next to XAC0095, interacts wirth VirD4, a component of the T4SS [77].

larity. This organization is quite different from those
found in other bacterial species. This XauB cluster is
found in a region containing 45 genes, all of which are
XauB-specific when compared to other Xanthomonas
genomes. Moreover this cluster is flanked by insertion
elements. This evidence suggests that this cluster was
likely acquired by lateral transfer.
The third XauB cluster was placed in group I, which
contains T4SS clusters similar to those found in Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 plasmid Ti [92], Xylella fastidiosa
9a5c plasmid pXF51 [93], and rhizosphere plasmids
pIPO2T and pSB102 [94,95]. This XauB cluster is most
similar to those found in the rhizosphere plasmids, in
particular to pIPO2T. The XauC draft genome sequence
did allow the identification of one T4SS gene cluster, and
it belongs to this group (Fig. 7A).
The XAC chromosomal cluster belongs to group IV
(Fig. 7A). It is flanked by regions XACSR12 and
XACSR13 (Fig. 8A). In addition, some of the genes in this

T4SS cluster had uncertain hybridizations (zoomed-in
portion of Fig. 5). This adds evidence that this cluster, as a
specific unit, is indeed absent from both Xau genomes.
XACSR12 contains genes that code for transporters,
alpha-glucosidases, hypothetical genes and transposases,
as well as a virB6-related gene. XACSR13 contains only
hypothetical genes and transposases.
One of the members of this T4SS cluster is virD4
(XAC2623). Alegria et al. [77] have identified 12 XAC
proteins that interact with VirD4. Six of these (XAC0096,
3266, 0151, 4264, 2609, 1918) are apparently absent from
the Xau genomes, and five belong to XAC-specific
regions (Fig. 8B). These genes might thus contribute to
the increased virulence of XAC when compared to XauB
and XauC.
Flagellum and motility

The XAC genome contains all genes known to be needed
for flagellum synthesis [12-14]. Three of these clusters

Figure 9 Genes related to flagellum synthesis and regulation. (A) Synteny and hybridization results between XAC e XauB/XauC. In the upper left
diagram, F1, F2 and F3 denote gene regions related to flagellar functions, whereas gene groups XACSR9 and Y appear to contain unrelated genes.
Dashed boxes denote regions apparently absent from the XauB and XauC genomes. Horizontal green bars represent hybridization signals for probes
marked with Cy3 and which are XAC-specific; yellow horizontal bars represent regions with positive hybridization results. The zoomed-in region
XACSR9 shows that it contains four transposases (in blue), twelve hypothetical genes (in gray), and one gene with assigned function (in yellow). That
gene (XAC1927) codes for a Fe-S-oxidoreductase that contains a RADICAL SAM domain. XAC mutants in this particular region (14H02 and 25D11 [31])
presented decreased virulence phenotypes. (B) Microscopy and motility test of each organism. These results validate flagellum presence and functionality in two different culture media (DYGS and TSA). (C) Flaggellum gene organization in gene clusters F1, F2 and F3, as given in panel A. The color

(which we call F1, F2, and F3) are close to the terminus of
replication and are spread out over a 126 kbp region (Fig.
9A). A fourth cluster contains just two genes, coding for
flagellar motor proteins A and B (motA and motB). All
four clusters are found in both XauB and XauC with one
exception: in XauB we did not find cluster F2 (XAC1930XAC1955, 31 kbp), which contains 26 genes, coding for
flagellum proteins that interact with bacterial membranes

and coding for flagellar motor components (Fig. 9CD).
On the other hand we have observed (microscopically)
that XauB does have a flagellar structure similar to those
of XAC and XauC, and motility tests have shown that
XauB is able to move (Fig. 9B). Although our genome
sequence data for XauB is incomplete, we believe it
unlikely that a 31 kbp long fragment would be entirely
missed; moreover, the hybridization experiment did not

Figure 10 LPS and O-antigen synthesis. (A) Model representing LPS and O-antigen synthesis in Xanthomonas. Each of the numbers in this panel
correspond to the same numbers in panel B. The model is based on the one described by Vorholter et al. [96] for X. campestris. Genes for products 12,
14, 17 and 18 are absent from XAC, XauB and XauC. (B) Genomic context of the LPS synthesis-related genes in XAC and X. campestris. The flanking

Moreover there is a group of genes that is shared and syntenic between the CC-species (in orange) and another (in green) that is specific to XAC
(XACSR18). (C) A XAC mutant for gene wzt showed a different virulence pattern [31]. The wzt homolog in XauB and XauC does not have the C-terminal

correspond to the annotations immediately below in this panel.

indicate presence of this fragment. These results suggest
that the absence of genes in cluster F2 is compensated in
XauB by other as yet undetermined genes.
We did not find in XauB nor in XauC genes that lie
between clusters F1 and F2; this region is XACSR9. In this
region the gene XAC1927 has been shown to be important for citrus canker since mutations in it significantly
decreased virulence [31] (Fig. 9A).

LPS and O-antigen genes

Two of the XAC-specific regions contain genes related to
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that may play a role in the differing phenotypes between XAC and the two Xau strains.
Region XACSR18 (XAC3596-3599) (which contains gene
rfbC, a truncated O-antigen biosynthesis protein) is
immediately downstream of a CC-specific region
(XAC3588-3595) (Fig. 10). An alignment with X. campestris pv. campestris ATCC33913 shows that these two
regions together occupy roughly the same genomic locus
as a 25-gene region related to LPS synthesis in X. campes-

Moreira et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:238

tris pv. campestris [96] (Fig. 10). Immediately downstream of XACSR18 we find genes wzt (XAC3600) and
wzm (XAC3601), also described as part of the LPS synthesis cluster in X. campestris [96]. Laia et al. [31]
obtained significant phenotypic differences in XAC (less
necrosis, more water soaking and more hyperplasia, as
compared to the wild type) by mutating gene XAC3600
(which codes for an ABC transporter ATP-binding protein). The wzt gene is present in both Xau genomes
(XAUB_16610 and XAUC_09380), although both genes
have lost the C-terminus when compared to the XAC wzt
gene (Fig. 10). The wzm gene is also present in both Xau
genomes (XAUB_ 16600 and XAUC_09370).
XACSR1 (XAC0037-0063) contains several genes
related to LPS synthesis, including two copies of asnB
(XAC0051 and XAC0059), which codes for an asparagine
synthase. A homolog of this gene in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been implicated in O-antigen biosynthesis [97].
The gene xacPNP

Gottig et al. [98] have identified a plant natriuretic peptide-like protein in XAC (xacPNP), encoded by gene
XAC2654. They have shown that a XAC2654-deletion
mutant resulted in more necrotic tissues and earlier bacterial cell death than in the wild type. XAC2654 lies
between regions XACSR13 and XACSR14, and is flanked
on both sides by phage-related genes. We have experimentally verified that neither XauB nor XauC appears to
contain a homolog of XAC2654 (Additional file 5: Fig.
S5). Therefore, xacPNP might be another gene contributing to the higher virulence displayed by XAC as compared to XauB and XauC.

Conclusions
Citrus canker continues to be an economically important
disease. The publication of the XAC strain 306 genome in
2002 opened up new avenues of research, and several
important insights into the genetics of canker have been
obtained since then, most of them cited here. Yet, understanding the genomic basis of a bacterial plant disease is a
complex undertaking. By obtaining the genome
sequences of two additional citrus canker strains we have
uncovered several new clues towards a thorough understanding of this disease.
We have approached the problem from two basic perspectives. The first was to determine commonalities
among the three CC strains that were not found in other
Xanthomonas genomes. Such traits are excellent candidates for the general genomic basis of canker and/or
adaptation to citrus hosts. The second was to carefully
compare the three CC genomes to one another, with special attention to genes that XAC has that the others
(apparently) do not, as well as genes present in the Xau
genomes but absent in XAC. Because of the draft nature

Page 19 of 25

of the Xau genomes here presented, all results concerning
gene absence in their sequences are tentative. However,
our hybridization platform provided additional evidence
for the specificity of XAC genes and regions with respect
to the other two strains.
Our most important findings are related to presence/
absence of effector genes. In addition to the already
known pthA gene, the genes xopE3 and xopAI deserve
special attention in future studies. Moreover, we have
identified several genes (such as xacPNP) that differentiate XAC from XauB and/or XauC. These genes or their
homologs in other bacterial plant pathogens have demonstrated roles in virulence and/or host specificity. Hypotheses on their role in citrus canker and in host range
differences between CC strains can now be tested experimentally.
We anticipate that knowledge in regard to CC-specific
effectors and other CC-specific genes will be used in the
future to engineer citrus species with durable resistance
to citrus canker, thus reducing the economic impact of
this disease on the citrus industry worldwide. Such
knowledge will also be crucial for dealing with new canker variants that may emerge in the field, exemplified by
the recent detection of what appears to be a new variant
of Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii in swingle
citrumelo [24].

Methods
Bacterial strains and DNA sequencing

The Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii type B
genome sequenced was strain 11122 (B-69), isolated from
a Citrus limon tree in Argentina. The Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii type C genome sequenced was
strain 10535 (IBSBF338), isolated from a Mexican lime
tree in São Paulo state in Brazil. We sequenced the
genomes using the Sanger technique as described previously [12], with sequencers ABI 3700 and ABI 3100. For
XauB we generated both shotgun and cosmid libraries;
for XauC only shotgun libraries were created. For XauB
we obtained 114,874 reads; for XauC we obtained
114,805 reads. We estimate this provided about 15× average coverage for each genome.
Microscopy and motility tests

Initial attempts to visualize the flagellum of the two Xau
strains with a scanning electron microscope by the normal routine (adhesion of the cultured bacteria on a cover
slip with the help of the cationic compound poly-L-lysine,
fixation, dehydration and critical point drying) failed
because apparently attachment of the flagellum is very
weak and it tends to fall off easily. To circumvent the
problem, a diluted suspension of the bacterial culture was
directly transferred onto a cover slip and excess of liquid
eliminated. A moist chamber was made in a Petri dish

Moreira et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:238
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/238

where the cover slip was inserted together with a small
plastic vial containing about 1 ml of 2% aqueous osmium
tetroxide. The Petri dish was sealed and wrapped with
aluminium foil and left overnight. The next morning the
cover slip was removed, air dried and sputter-coated with
gold, mounted on the stub and examined in a LEO 435
VP scanning electron microscope. Results are shown in
Fig. 9B.
For motility tests TSA and DYGS media were used [27].
The Agar concentration of both media was changed
(0.7%) so that the media were semisolid. For better
growth visualization a phenol dye of 1% was added.
Strains were placed in plates with solid media (TSA and
DYGS) where isolated colonies were grown. The colonies
were then placed in semisolid media. After 96 hours of
incubation at 28°C, bacterial growth was observed in the
test tubes, and results are given in the table in Fig. 9B.
Gum production determination

Strains were maintained both in autoclaved tap water at
room temperature and at -80°C in NA medium (3 g/l
meat extract and 5 g/l peptone) containing 25% glycerol.
The three strains were picked from -80°C stock, streaked
on solid TSA medium (10 g/l tryptone, 10 g/l sucrose, 1
g/l sodium glutamate, and 15 g/l agar) and grown overnight at 28°C. One single isolated colony from each strain
was streaked again on solid TSA medium and grown
overnight at 28°C. For XAC, a single colony was inoculated into 20 ml of liquid TSA medium (10 g/l tryptone,
10 g/l sucrose, 1 g/l sodium glutamate) in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 28°C in a rotary shaker at
180 rpm for 17 hours (1.100 OD at 600 nm). A 125 ml
Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of liquid TSA medium
was inoculated with 1 ml of XAC culture and incubated
at 28°C in a rotary shaker at 180 rpm for 5 hours (0.300
OD at 600 nm). This XAC culture was used as inoculum
for xanthan gum production. For XauB and XauC, an
inoculating loop was used to inoculate the bacteria from
the solid TSA medium plates into 20 ml of liquid TSA
medium in a 50 ml Falcon tube, followed by incubation at
28°C in a rotary shaker at 180 rpm for 24.5 hours (0.260
and 0.550 OD at 600 nm for XauB and XauC, respectively). One ml of XauB and XauC culture was inoculated
into separate 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml
of liquid TSA medium and incubated at 28°C in a rotary
shaker at 180 rpm for 15 hours (0.300 OD at 600 nm).
The XauB and XauC cultures were used as inoculum for
xanthan gum production.
For gum production, 2.5 ml of each bacterial strain in
liquid TSA medium (0.300 OD at 600 nm) was inoculated
in three (triplicate) 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing
100 ml of media for xanthan gum production (25 g/l glucose, 3 g/l yeast extract, 2 g/l K2HPO4, 0.1 g/l
MgSO4.7H2O, pH 7.0 with 4 M HCl [92]) and incubated

Page 20 of 25

at 28°C in a rotary shaker at 178 rpm for 96 h. The cells
from the 96 h culture were centrifuged at 9.666 g for 40
min. The bacterial pellets were stored at -20°C and the
supernatants were transferred to 500 ml beakers. The
gum was recovered from the supernatants by alcohol precipitation. Four grams of KCl were added to each beaker
followed by agitation at room temperature for 15 min.
Two volumes of cold isopropyl alcohol were added and
the gum from each beaker was removed to pre-weighted
plastic discs. After 16 h at 37°C the discs were weighted
again and the gum amount was calculated. The bacterial
pellet from each culture was also obtained. For this, each
pellet was transferred to a pre-weighted beaker and
weighted again after 14 h at 70°C.
DNA Microarray

From the shotgun libraries made for the sequencing of
XAC strain 306 in 2001, 2,653 clones were selected for
the design of a glass slide hybridization array. Inserts
from selected clones were amplified by PCR with the
M13-R and M13-F universal oligonucleotides. Products
were purified and placed in duplicate slides, resulting in
6,144 probes, with 768 positive controls and 624 negative
controls. Experimental validation was done by hybridization of total XAC DNA probes differentially stained, with
86% of all products with a hybridization signal greater
than the average value for the noise signal plus two standard deviations. The final XACarray contains targets for
the identification of 2,760 putative coding sequences
(61% of all annotated protein-coding genes). The XACarray was used to compare XAC and XauC, and XAC and
XauB, with XAC itself as a positive control. The results
were similar (128 CDSs considered XAC-specific had
similar ratios for both the XauB and XauC experiments,
and 101 of these are in XACSRs); we report here detailed
results only for the first experiment. Details of the array
construction are described elsewhere (Moreira LM, Laia
ML, de Souza RF, Zaini PA, da Silva ACR, Ferro JA, da
Silva AM: Development and validation of a Xanthomonas
citri subsp. citri DNA microarray platform (XACarray)
generated from the shotgun libraries previously used in
the sequencing of this bacterial genome, submitted).
XacPNP verification

Evidence for the absence of genes coding for XacPNP
homologs in XauB and XauC was obtained by PCR using
gene-specific primers (Forward: GGACCAACAACGAATATC; Reverse: ATGGGAATAGTCATGAAAC).
XAC was used as positive control.
Assembly and genome annotation

Base calling, genome assembly and visualization were
done with the phred-phrap-consed package [99-101].
Contigs were trimmed to remove low phred quality
regions at both ends. For both XauB and XauC all contigs

Moreira et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:238
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/238

larger than 1 kbp have average phred quality greater than
20, and nearly all (99% for XauB and 96% for XauC) these
contigs have average phred quality greater than or equal
to 40 (i.e. accuracy equal to or better than 1 error in
10,000 bp). To improve assembly many transposase
sequences were masked, and reads were re-assembled to
obtain the final result. We estimated the fraction
obtained of the complete genome of XauB by dividing the
total length of contigs by the total genome size of XAC,
and by adding 1% because of the removed transposases.
We did the same with XauC. To estimate the average gap
size we divided the number of contigs by the estimated
size of un-sequenced genome.
Using paired-end reads scaffolds for the XauB and
XauC chromosomes were obtained. The overall correctness of each scaffold was validated using a sliding-window GC-skew computation. Each scaffold was aligned
against the XAC chromosome using MUMmer [102].
Results are presented in additional file 1 (Fig. S1).
The XauB and XauC genomes were automatically
annotated with the Genome Reverse Compiler [103],
with a few manual refinements. Ortholog groups were
built using OrthoMCL [104].
XAC-specific regions

For determination of XAC-specific regions we relied on
published data about putative genomic islands
[14,31,105] and on AlienHunter results [40]. Islands
whose genes were not found in the XauB and XauC
genomes by BLAST [45] analysis and with differential
hybridization signals in the XACarray were considered
XAC-specific regions.
Phylogeny reconstruction
Species tree

We used a supermatrix approach as in previous work
[106]. Protein sequences of eleven Xanthomonas
genomes (ingroup) and four Xylella genomes (outgroup)
were clustered in 6,375 families using OrthoMCL [104].
We then selected families with one and only one representative from each of the ingroup genomes and at least
one outgroup protein, resulting in 1,666 families. Their
sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [107] and the
resulting alignments were concatenated. Non-informative columns were removed using Gblocks [108], resulting in 596,246 positions. RAxML [109] with the
PROTGAMMAWAGF model was used to build the final
tree.
Pth tree

The same methodology as above was used, with the following differences. Representative pth nucleotide
sequences from Xanthomonas species were retrieved
from GenBank, and added to the set of XauB and XauC
pth nucleotide sequences. A pth gene from Ralstonia

Page 21 of 25

solanacearum [GenBank: CAD1557.1] was used as an
outgroup in a preliminary round of tree construction to
ascertain root position. The list of gene sequences used
to build the tree is given in additional file 6 (Table S6).
The Tandem Repeat Finder program [110] with parameters 2,7,7,80,10,50,500,1 was used to mask the internal
repeats. The masked regions were removed and the
resulting sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. A few
manual adjustments to the multiple alignment were made
before running Gblocks, which yielded 1,679 positions.
RAxML with the GTRGAMMA model was used to build
the final tree. The bootstrap values obtained for the clade
indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 3 are given in additional
file 7 (Fig. S7).
Effector analysis

The candidate T3SS effectors in the XauB and XauC
genomes were identified using tBLASTn [45] analysis and
Pfam domain [111] searches. For tBLASTn analysis, all
known plant and animal pathogen effectors were used as
query with an e-value threshold ≤ 0.00001. Pfam domains
were searched for possible domains found in known
effectors in the predicted set of ORFs of draft genome
sequences. Candidate effectors were classified according
to the nomenclature and classification scheme for effectors in xanthomonads recently described by White et al.
[112].
Database submission

The draft genome sequences of XauB and XauC are available at GenBank under accession numbers
ACPX00000000 and ACPY00000000, respectively.
