Abstract
Background: Tanzania has a high tuberculosis incidence, and genotyping studies of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis in the country are necessary in order to improve our understanding of the epidemic.
Spoligotyping is a potentially powerful genotyping method due to fast generation of genotyping
results, high reproducibility and low operation costs. The recently constructed SpolDB4 database
and the model-based program 'Spotclust' can be used to assign isolates to families, subfamilies and
variants. The results of a study can thus be analyzed in a global context.
Results: One hundred forty-seven pulmonary isolates from consecutive tuberculosis patients in
Dar es Salaam were spoligotyped. SpolDB4 and 'Spotclust' were used to assign isolates to families,
subfamilies and variants. The CAS (37%), LAM (22%) and EAI (17%) families were the most
abundant. Despite the dominance of these three families, diversity was high due to variation within
M. tuberculosis families. Of the obtained spoligopatterns, 64% were previously unrecorded.
Conclusion: Spoligotyping is useful to gain an overall understanding of the local TB epidemic. This
study demonstrates that the extensive TB epidemic in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania is caused by a few
successful M. tuberculosis families, dominated by the CAS family. Import of strains was a minor
problem.

Background
In Tanzania, the tuberculosis (TB) incidence doubled
between 1990 and 2004 [1]. The rate of all forms of the
disease is estimated at 524/100,000 and the rate of new
sputum smear positive disease is approximately 157/
100,000 [1] with Dar es Salaam contributing about 26%
of all TB cases [2]. The World Health Organization estimates that Tanzania has the 14th highest TB burden in the
world [1]. Points of concern include the proportion of

patients lost to follow-up, currently at 9%, an average
diagnostic delay of 6 months, decreasing case detection
rate (from 55% in 1997 to 45% in 2004) and the continuing high prevalence of HIV [3]. The high case rate in
many African countries has contributed to a rise of the
global TB incidence, despite stable or declining rates in
the rest of the world [1]. Tanzania with its 37 million
inhabitants, has 701 district laboratories diagnosing TB,
three laboratories culturing M. tuberculosis and one

National reference laboratory that perform drug susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis isolates. Measures are
undertaken to establish molecular genotyping methods
such as spoligotyping [4], but currently no laboratory in
Tanzania offers this service. Previous studies have
described the molecular epidemiology of Tanzanian M.
tuberculosis collections from the first half of the 1990s [57]. Spoligotyping is a PCR-based fingerprinting method
that detects the presence or absence of 43 defined spacers
situated between short direct repeat (DR) sequences in the
genomes of members of the M. tuberculosis complex.
Important advantages of spoligotyping are that it is cheap,
easy to perform and fast. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the results are highly reproducible [8]. Unique
to spoligotyping results are tools like the SpolDB4 database [9] and the web-based computer algorithm 'Spotclust' [10] that can be used to assign new isolates to
families, subfamilies and variants (SpolDB4 only).
SpolDB4 is the largest and most up to date available global database for spoligotypes. For previously not reported
spoligopatterns, the 'Spotclust' database is a good additional tool in that it can assign these patterns to families
by using a computer algorithm based on studies of
SpolDB3 [10]. The results from local studies can thus be
analyzed and compared to the global M. tuberculosis population. This may help us better understand the worldwide spread of common M tuberculosis families and subfamilies. In order to improve our understanding of the TB
epidemic in this high-incidence country, the current
ongoing study included M. tuberculosis strains collected in
Dar es Salaam during October and November 2005. We
describe the diversity of M. tuberculosis isolates from Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, based on spoligotyping, and identify
the families and subfamilies responsible for the current
persistence and spread of TB in this high-incidence community.

ment showed that 37% of the isolates belonged to the
Central Asian (CAS) family, 22% to the Latin American
Mediterranean (LAM) family, and 17% to the East-African
Indian (EAI) family. These three main families thus
accounted for 76% of the incidences in Dar es Salaam.
This family assignment also includes the spoligopatterns
not described before. Eight isolates lacked spacers 4–7, 10
and 20–35, typical of the CAS1-kili variant, but in addition, they all also lacked spacer 2 (table 2). This spacer is
typically present in CAS1-kili lineages and its absence has
not previously been reported in these variants. We propose to name these variants CAS1-DAR, since they appear
to be abundant in Dar es Salaam.
The rate of diversity (number of spoligotypes divided by
the number of isolates) within each main family varied
substantially and was 27, 54 and 72% for CAS, LAM and
EAI, respectively. This may indicate that the CAS family is
best adapted to spread within this community. The diversity of the M. tuberculosis population in Dar es Salaam
(52%) was comparable to that described in previous studies from Tanzania [5-7]. In Delhi, India the genetic diversity of the M. tuberculosis population is 42% [11], but it is
only 25% in Harare, Zimbabwe [12]. Thus, the diversity in
high-incidence countries varies greatly and may be difficult to estimate without molecular epidemiological studies.
Phylogenetic studies
A Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree of all the isolates is shown in
figure 1. The main families were well distinguished and a
high diversity within and between families were observed.
To confirm the reliability of the NJ tree, the program
'Structure' was applied on the underlying 43-digit binary
spacer codes. The open boxes in figure 1 demonstrate the
nine groups found to be the most likely number; the NJ
branches were supported by the grouping via 'Structure'.

Results
Genetic diversity and family assignment
The 147 analyzed isolates gave 76 different spoligopatterns resulting in an overall diversity of 52%: 57 spoligopatterns occurred only once and 19 patterns comprised
90 of the isolates (61%) (table 1). Forty-nine (64%) patterns had not been described previously. The SpolDB4
database assigns isolates to families, subfamilies and
often to variants, whereas 'Spotclust' assigns isolates to
families and subfamilies, but is not designed to assign isolates to variants. Four spoligopatterns were assigned to
different families and nine patterns were assigned to different subfamilies by the two methods. SpolDB4 assigned
names were used whenever a spoligopatterns was found
in the database, as this database is much larger than the
SpolDB3 database, on which the 'Spotclust' algorithm is
built. Patterns not found in SpolDB4 were assigned to
families and subfamilies by 'Spotclust'. The family assign-

Discussion
The current study demonstrated that most isolates had at
least one other closely related isolate in Dar es Salaam.
Based on these preliminary findings, the TB epidemic
appeared to result from a gradually evolving M. tuberculosis population rather than imported strains. A spoligotyping study conducted in the Ouest province of Cameroon
found that 193 of 413 M. tuberculosis isolates belong to the
Cameroon family (LAM10-CAM) [13]. In Harare, Zimbabwe, 68 of 214 isolates are LAM11-ZWE variants [12]. Of
the 147 isolates in this study, three and eight isolates
belonged to these variants respectively. The scarcity of
these strains, abundant in other African countries, also
indicated that the TB epidemic in Dar es Salaam is local
and well established.

When live cultures are not available, two PCR based methods are preferred in order to determine the degree of clustering among M. tuberculosis. Such complementary studies
will be undertaken for the current population but are not
included in the current paper.

Spoligotyping is not necessarily the best method for phylogenetic studies, since it targets a small region of the
genome. The knowledge of the evolution of this region is
limited. It has however been proposed that transposition
of insertion sequences can lead to convergence of spoli-

gopatterns and that the evolution of the region is unidirectional (spacers can be lost but not gained). Also,
contiguous blocks of spacers and DRs can be lost in single
events [14]. These facts may obscure phylogenetic analyses using simple distance based methods. Despite these
weaknesses, spoligotypes have been shown to correlate
quite well with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP),
with the T family, constituting only 10 isolates in this
study, as a notable exception. For these reasons a NJ-tree
was used to illustrate the current results.
The success of the CAS family in particular, but also the
LAM and EAI families in this community is intriguing. The
low diversity of the highly prevalent CAS family in this
study may indicate that the family is spreading rapidly,
but could also reflect a slower evolution of the DR region
which could possibly be a result of the missing spacers in
the central part of the spoligopatterns of these strains.
The success of these three families suggests a possible coevolution between specific M. tuberculosis families and
host population, the molecular basis of which remains to
be elucidated. A study conducted in San Francisco supports the idea of co-evolution between this pathogen and
host populations [15]. In order to document such possible co-evolution, large populations should be preferred.
Internationally standardized methods such as spoligotyping and MIRU-typing, as well as SNP and deligotyping,
enable comparison of M. tuberculosis genotypes between
studies conducted at different times and locations. This
facilitates inter-study comparison and helps generate large
populations for such evolutionary scenarios. It should be
noted that the current study represents a short time period
and a small collection of strains. This complicates interpretation of recent transmission and hampers comparisons of genetic diversity with that found in studies
conducted over a longer period of time. The use of different genotyping methods also makes direct comparison
with previous studies in Tanzania [5-7] difficult.
Recent findings suggest that the tubercle bacillus emerged
in Africa and may have spread globally in parallel with the
human migrations out of Africa [15,16]. Another study
have however identified India as the center for the evolutionary radiation of M. tuberculosis [17]. These theories are
not mutually exclusive; as the spread to India might represent an early and evolutionary important step in the
radiation of M. tuberculosis out of Africa. The CAS- and
EAI-families which this study found to be abundant in
Dar es Salaam, have previously been identified to have the
most ancestral roots [17]. We demonstrate that the Beijing
family, which is highly prevalent in many Asian locations,
is not common in the current population. It therefore
appears unlikely that import of strains from Asia have had
a major impact on the M. tuberculosis population in Dar es

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/76

Salaam. The sensitivity of spoligotyping alone is insufficient for pinpointing evolutionary origins and direction
of movement, but the current findings lend support to a
view of an early African origin of M. tuberculosis.
Spoligotyping is inexpensive, fast, simple and reliable. By
using this method one can identify outbreaks, support
community-based contact tracing, describe the diversity
of a M. tuberculosis population, and compare this population to that in other parts of the world. Implementation of
spoligotyping as a routine method for molecular epidemiological studies of M. tuberculosis isolates, appear to represent a valuable investment in many high-incidence
countries.

Conclusion
Spoligotyping is very useful to gain an overall understanding of the local TB epidemic. This study demonstrated that
the extensive TB epidemic in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania was
caused by a few successful M. tuberculosis families, dominated by the CAS family. Import of new strains was a
minor problem.

Methods
DNA extraction and spoligotyping
Isolates of M. tuberculosis were collected from sputum
smear positive TB cases in consecutive patients in Dar es
Salaam during October and November 2005. Heat-killed
samples were shipped to Norway, DNA was extracted [18]
and a total of 147 M. tuberculosis isolates were spoligotyped according to Kamerbeek et al. [4].
Family assignment
The obtained spoligopatterns were first compared to the
SpolDB4 database [9] and assigned to families and subfamilies. Second, in order to assign names to the isolates
not found in the SpolDB4 database, the spoligopatterns
were analyzed with 'Spotclust'[10], using a mixture model
built on the SpolDB3 database. This model takes into
account knowledge of the evolution of the DR region and
assigns spoligopatterns to families and subfamilies.
Phylogenetic analyses
A NJ-tree [19] was constructed by converting the presence
or absence of 43 defined spacers of the 147 isolates into a
Jaccard [20] based pair-wise distance matrix with the computer program 'NTSYSpc' (Exeter Software Co., New
York). Without conversion to distance, to verify the NJ
tree, the spacer data were directly used by the program
'Structure' [21] to identify groups into which the individual isolates fit best and to calculate the best number of
groups explaining the whole data set (run with a noadmixture-model, and a burn-in of 100000 repeats and
400000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo repeats, 65%
