Abstract
Background: Establishing genomic resources for closely related species will provide comparative insights that are crucial for
understanding diversity and variability at multiple levels of biological organization. We developed ESTs for Mexican axolotl
(Ambystoma mexicanum) and Eastern tiger salamander (A. tigrinum tigrinum), species with deep and diverse research histories.
Results: Approximately 40,000 quality cDNA sequences were isolated for these species from various tissues, including
regenerating limb and tail. These sequences and an existing set of 16,030 cDNA sequences for A. mexicanum were processed to
yield 35,413 and 20,599 high quality ESTs for A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum, respectively. Because the A. t. tigrinum ESTs were
obtained primarily from a normalized library, an approximately equal number of contigs were obtained for each species, with
21,091 unique contigs identified overall. The 10,592 contigs that showed significant similarity to sequences from the human
RefSeq database reflected a diverse array of molecular functions and biological processes, with many corresponding to genes
expressed during spinal cord injury in rat and fin regeneration in zebrafish. To demonstrate the utility of these EST resources,
we searched databases to identify probes for regeneration research, characterized intra- and interspecific nucleotide
polymorphism, saturated a human – Ambystoma synteny group with marker loci, and extended PCR primer sets designed for A.
mexicanum / A. t. tigrinum orthologues to a related tiger salamander species.
Conclusions: Our study highlights the value of developing resources in traditional model systems where the likelihood of
information transfer to multiple, closely related taxa is high, thus simultaneously enabling both laboratory and natural history
research.

Background
Establishing genomic resources for closely related species
will provide comparative insights that are crucial for
understanding diversity and variability at multiple levels
of biological organization. Expressed sequence tags (EST)
are particularly useful genomic resources because they
enable multiple lines of research and can be generated for
any organism: ESTs allow the identification of molecular
probes for developmental studies, provide clones for DNA
microchip construction, reveal candidate genes for
mutant phenotypes, and facilitate studies of genome
structure and evolution. Furthermore, ESTs provide raw
material from which strain-specific polymorphisms can
be identified for use in population and quantitative
genetic analyses. The utility of such resources can be tailored to target novel characteristics of organisms when
ESTs are isolated from cell types and tissues that are
actively being used by a particular research community, so
as to bias the collection of sequences towards genes of special interest. Finally, EST resources produced for model
organisms can greatly facilitate comparative and evolutionary studies when their uses are extended to other,
closely related taxa.
Salamanders (urodele amphibians) are traditional model
organisms whose popularity was unsurpassed early in the
20th century. At their pinnacle, salamanders were the primary model for early vertebrate development. Embryological studies in particular revealed many basic
mechanisms of development, including organizer and
inducer regions of developing embryos [1]. Salamanders
continue to be important vertebrate model organisms for
regeneration because they have by far the greatest capacity
to regenerate complex body parts in the adult phase. In
contrast to mammals, which are not able to regenerate
entire structures or organ systems upon injury or amputation, adult salamanders regenerate their limbs, tail, lens,
retina, spinal cord, heart musculature, and jaw [2-7]. In
addition, salamanders are the model of choice in a diversity of areas, including vision, embryogenesis, heart development, olfaction, chromosome structure, evolution,
ecology, science education, and conservation biology [815]. All of these disciplines are in need of genomic
resources as fewer than 4100 salamander nucleotide
sequences had been deposited in GenBank as of 3/10/04.
Here we describe results from an EST project for two
ambystomatid salamanders: the Mexican axolotl,
Ambystoma mexicanum and the eastern tiger salamander,
A. tigrinum tigrinum. These two species are members of the
Tiger Salamander Complex [16], a group of closely related
species and subspecies that are widely distributed in
North America. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that
these species probably arose from a common ancestor
about 10–15 million years ago [16]. Ambystoma mexica-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/54

num has a long research history of over 100 years and is
now principally supplied to the research community by
the Axolotl Colony [17], while A. t. tigrinum is obtained
from natural populations in the eastern United States.
Although closely related with equally large genomes (32 ×
109 bp)[18], these two species and others of the Complex
differ dramatically in life history: A. mexicanum is a paedomorphic species that retains many larval features and lives
in water throughout it's life cycle while A. t. tigrinum
undergoes a metamorphosis that is typical of many
amphibians. Like many other traditional model organisms of the last century, interest in these two species
declined during the rise of genetic models like the fly,
zebrafish, and mouse [19]. However, "early" model
organisms such as salamanders are beginning to re-attract
attention as genome resources can rapidly be developed
to exploit the unique features that originally identified
their utility for research. We make this point below by
showing how the development of ESTs for these two species is enabling research in several areas. Furthermore, we
emphasize the value of developing resources in model
systems where the likelihood of information transfer to
multiple, closely related taxa is high, thus simultaneously
enabling both laboratory and natural history research
programs.

Results and Discussion
Selection of libraries for EST sequencing
Eleven cDNA libraries were constructed using a variety of
tissues (Table 1). Pilot sequencing of randomly selected
clones revealed that the majority of the non-normalized
libraries were moderate to highly redundant for relatively
few transcripts. For example, hemoglobin-like transcripts
represented 15–25% of the sampled clones from cDNA
libraries V1, V2, and V6. Accordingly, we chose to focus
our sequencing efforts on the non-normalized MATH
library as well as the normalized AG library, which had
lower levels of redundancy (5.5 and 0.25% globins,
respectively). By concentrating our sequencing efforts on
these two libraries we obtained transcripts deriving

primarily from regenerating larval tissues in A. mexicanum
and several non-regenerating larval tissues in A. t.
tigrinum.
EST sequencing and clustering
A total of 46,064 cDNA clones were sequenced, yielding
39,982 high quality sequences for A. mexicanum and A. t.
tigrinum (Table 2). Of these, 3,745 corresponded to
mtDNA and were removed from the dataset; complete
mtDNA genome data for these and other ambystomatid

species will be reported elsewhere. The remaining nuclear
ESTs for each species were clustered and assembled separately. We included in our A. mexicanum assembly an
additional 16,030 high quality ESTs that were generated
recently for regenerating tail and neurula stage embryos
[20]. Thus, a total of 32,891 and 19,376 ESTs were
clustered for A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum, respectively.
Using PaCE clustering and CAP3 assembly, a similar
number of EST clusters and contigs were identified for
each species (Table 2). Overall contig totals were 11,190
and 9,901 for A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum respectively.
Thus, although 13,515 more A. mexicanum ESTs were
assembled, a roughly equivalent number of contigs were
obtained for both species. This indicates that EST development was more efficient for A. t. tigrinum, presumably
because ESTs were obtained primarily from the normalized AG library; indeed, there were approximately twice as
many ESTs on average per A. mexicanum contig (Table 2).
Thus, our EST project yielded an approximately equivalent number of contigs for A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum,
and overall we identified > 21,000 different contigs.
Assuming that 20% of the contigs correspond to redundant loci, which has been found generally in large EST
projects [21], we identified transcripts for approximately
17,000 different ambystomatid loci. If ambystomatid salamanders have approximately the same number of loci as
other vertebrates (e.g. [22]), we have isolated roughly half
the expected number of genes in the genome.

Identification of vertebrate sequences similar to
Ambystoma contigs
We searched all contigs against several vertebrate databases to identify sequences that exhibited significant
sequence similarity. As our objective was to reliably annotate as many contigs as possible, we first searched against
19,804 sequences in the NCBI human RefSeq database
(Figure 1), which is actively reviewed and curated by biologists. This search revealed 5619 and 4973 "best hit"
matches for the A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum EST datasets at a BLASTX threshold of E = 10-7. The majority of
contigs were supported at more stringent E-value thresh-

olds (Table 3). Non-matching contigs were subsequently
searched against the Non-Redundant (nr) Protein database and Xenopus tropicalus and X. laevis UNIGENE ESTs
(Figure 1). These later two searches yielded a few hundred
more 'best hit' matches, however a relatively large number
of ESTs from both ambystomatid species were not similar
to any sequences from the databases above. Presumably,
these non-matching sequences were obtained from the
non-coding regions of transcripts or they contain proteincoding sequences that are novel to salamander. Although
the majority are probably of the former type, we did identify 3,273 sequences from the non-matching set that had
open reading frames (ORFs) of at least 200 bp, and 911 of
these were greater than 300 bp.
The distribution of ESTs among contigs can provide perspective on gene expression when clones are randomly
sequenced from non-normalized cDNA libraries. In general, frequently sampled transcripts may be expressed at
higher levels. We identified the 20 contigs from A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum that contained the most assembled
ESTs (Table 4). The largest A. t. tigrinum contigs contained
fewer ESTs than the largest A. mexicanum contigs, probably
because fewer overall A. t. tigrinum clones were sequenced,
with the majority selected from a normalized library. However, we note that the contig with the most ESTs was identified for A. t. tigrinum: delta globin. In both species,
transcripts corresponding to globin genes were sampled
more frequently than all other loci. This may reflect the fact
that amphibians, unlike mammals, have nucleated red
blood cells that are transcriptionally active. In addition to
globin transcripts, a few other house-keeping genes were
identified in common from both species, however the
majority of the contigs were unique to each list. Overall, the
strategy of sequencing cDNAs from a diverse collection of
tissues (from normalized and non-normalized libraries)
yielded different sets of highly redundant contigs. Only
25% and 28% of the A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum contigs, respectively, were identified in common (Figure 2). We
also note that several hundred contigs were identified in
common between Xenopus and Ambystoma; this will help
facilitate comparative studies among these amphibian
models.
Functional annotation
For the 10,592 contigs that showed significant similarity
to sequences from the human RefSeq database, we
obtained Gene Ontology (23) information to describe
ESTs in functional terms. Although there are hundreds of
possible annotations, we chose a list of descriptors for
molecular and biological processes that we believe are of
interest for research programs currently utilizing salamanders as model organisms (Table 5). In all searches, we
counted each match between a contig and a RefSeq
sequence as identifying a different ambystomatid gene,

even when different contigs matched the same RefSeq reference. In almost all cases, approximately the same
number of matches was found per functional descriptor
for both species. This was not simply because the same
loci were being identified for both species, as only 20% of
the total number of searched contigs shared sufficient
identity (BLASTN; E<10-80 or E<10-20) to be potential
homologues. In this sense, the sequencing effort between
these two species was complementary in yielding a more
diverse collection of ESTs that were highly similar to
human gene sequences.

Informatic searches for regeneration probes
The value of a salamander model to regeneration research
will ultimately rest on the ease in which data and results can
be cross-referenced to other vertebrate models. For example, differences in the ability of mammals and salamanders
to regenerate spinal cord may reflect differences in the way
cells of the ependymal layer respond to injury. As is
observed in salamanders, ependymal cells in adult mammals also proliferate and differentiate after spinal cord
injury (SCI) [24,25]; immediately after contusion injury in
adult rat, ependymal cell numbers increase and proliferation continues for at least 4 days [[26]; but see [27]]. Rat
ependymal cells share some of the same gene expression

and protein properties of embryonic stem cells [28], however no new neurons have been observed to derive from
these cells in vivo after SCI [29]. Thus, although endogenous
neural progenitors of the ependymal layer may have latent
regenerative potential in adult mammals, this potential is
not realized. Several recently completed microarray analyses of spinal cord injury in rat now make it possible to
cross-reference information between amphibians and
mammals. For example, we searched the complete list of
significantly up and down regulated genes from Carmel et

al. [30] and Song et al. [31] against all Ambystoma ESTs.
Based upon amino acid sequence similarity of translated
ESTs (TBLASTX; E<10-7), we identified DNA sequences corresponding to 69 of these 164 SCI rat genes (Table 6). It is
likely that we have sequence corresponding to other presumptive orthologues from this list as many of our ESTs
only contain a portion of the coding sequence or the
untranslated regions (UTR), and in many cases our searches
identified closely related gene family members. Thus, many
of the genes that show interesting expression patterns after
SCI in rat can now be examined in salamander.
Similar gene expression programs may underlie regeneration of vertebrate appendages such as fish fins and tetrapod
limbs. Regeneration could depend on reiterative expression
of genes that function in patterning, morphogenesis, and
metabolism during normal development and homeostasis.
Or, regeneration could depend in part on novel genes that
function exclusively in this process. We investigated these
alternatives by searching A. mexicanum limb regeneration
ESTs against UNIGENE zebrafish fin regeneration ESTs
(Figure 3). This search identified 1357 significant BLAST
hits (TBLASTX; E<10-7) that corresponded to 1058 unique
zebrafish ESTs. We then asked whether any of these potential regeneration homologues were represented uniquely in
limb and fin regeneration databases (and not in databases
derived from other zebrafish tissues). A search of the 1058
zebrafish ESTs against > 400,000 zebrafish ESTs that were
sampled from non-regenerating tissues revealed 43 that
were unique to the zebrafish regeneration database (Table
7). Conceivably, these 43 ESTs may represent transcripts
important to appendage regeneration. For example, our
search identified several genes (e.g. hspc128, pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor 1, galectin 4, galectin 8) that may be
expressed in progenitor cells that proliferate and differentiate during appendage regeneration. Overall, our results suggest that regeneration is achieved largely through the
reiterative expression of genes having additional functions
in other developmental contexts, however a small number
of genes may be expressed uniquely during appendage
regeneration.
DNA sequence polymorphisms within and between A.
mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum
The identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) within and between orthologous sequences of A.
mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum is needed to develop DNA
markers for genome mapping [32], quantitative genetic
analysis [33], and population genetics [34]. We estimated
within species polymorphism for both species by calculating the frequency of SNPs among ESTs within the 20 largest contigs (Table 4). These analyses considered a total of
30,638 base positions for A. mexicanum and 18,765 base
positions for A. t. tigrinum. Two classes of polymorphism
were considered in this analysis: those occurring at

num because they exist in larger, out-bred populations in
nature.
To identify SNPs between species, we had to first identify
presumptive, interspecific orthologues. We did this by
performing BLASTN searches between the A. mexicanum
and A. t. tigrinum assemblies, and the resulting alignments

were filtered to retain only those alignments between
sequences that were one another's reciprocal best BLAST
hit. As expected, the number of reciprocal 'best hits' varied
depending upon the E value threshold, although increasing
the E threshold by several orders of magnitude had a disproportionately small effect on the overall total length of
BLAST alignments. A threshold of E<10-80yielded 2414
alignments encompassing a total of 1.25 Mbp from each
species, whereas a threshold of E<10-20 yielded 2820 alignments encompassing a total of 1.32 Mbp. The percent
sequence identity of alignments was very high among
presumptive orthologues, ranging from 84–100% at the
more stringent E threshold of E<10-80. On average, A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum transcripts are estimated to be
97% identical at the nucleotide level, including both protein coding and UTR sequence. This estimate for nuclear
sequence identity is surprisingly similar to estimates
obtained from complete mtDNA reference sequences for
these species (96%, unpublished data), and to estimates for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/54

partial mtDNA sequence data obtained from multiple natural populations [16]. These results are consistent with the
idea that mitochondrial mutation rates are lower in cold
versus warm-blooded vertebrates [35]. From a resource perspective, the high level of sequence identity observed
between these species suggests that informatics will enable
rapidly the development of probes between these and other
species of the A. tigrinum complex.
Extending EST resources to other ambystomatid species
Relatively little DNA sequence has been obtained from
species that are closely related to commonly used model
organisms, and yet, such extensions would greatly facilitate genetic studies of natural phenotypes, population
structures, species boundaries, and conservatism and
divergence of developmental mechanisms. Like many
amphibian species that are threatened by extinction,
many of these ambystomatid salamanders are currently in
need of population genetic studies to inform conservation
and management strategies [e.g. [13]]. We characterized
SNPs from orthologous A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum
ESTs and extended this information to develop informative molecular markers for a related species, A. ordinarium.
Ambystoma ordinarium is a stream dwelling paedomorph
endemic to high elevation habitats in central Mexico [36].
This species is particularly interesting from an ecological
and evolutionary standpoint because it harbors a high
level of intraspecific mitochondrial variation, and as an
independently derived stream paedomorph, is unique
among the typically pond-breeding tiger salamanders. As
a reference of molecular divergence, Ambystoma
ordinarium shares approximately 98 and 97% mtDNA
sequence identity with A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum
respectively [16].

To identify informative markers for A. ordinarium, A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum EST contigs were aligned to identify
orthologous genes with species-specific sequence variations
(SNPs or Insertion/Deletions = INDELs). Primer pairs corresponding to 123 ESTs (Table 8) were screened by PCR
using a pool of DNA template made from individuals of 10
A. ordinarium populations. Seventy-nine percent (N = 97)
of the primer pairs yielded amplification products that were
approximately the same size as corresponding A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum fragments, using only a single set of
PCR conditions. To estimate the frequency of intraspecific
DNA sequence polymorphism among this set of DNA
marker loci, 43 loci were sequenced using a single individual sampled randomly from each of the 10 populations,
which span the geographic range of A. ordinarium. At least
one polymorphic site was observed for 20 of the sequenced
loci, with the frequency of polymorphisms dependent
upon the size of the DNA fragment amplified. Our results
suggest that the vast majority of primer sets designed for A.
mexicanum / A. t. tigrinum EST orthologues can be used to

amplify the corresponding sequence in a related A. tigrinum
complex species, and for small DNA fragments in the range

of 150–500 bp, approximately half are expected to have
informative polymorphisms.

Comparative gene mapping
Salamanders occupy a pivotal phylogenetic position for
reconstructing the ancestral tetrapod genome structure
and for providing perspective on the extremely derived
anuran Xenopus (37) that is currently providing the bulk
of amphibian genome information. Here we show the

utility of ambystomatid ESTs for identifying chromosomal regions that are conserved between salamanders
and other vertebrates. A region of conserved synteny that
corresponds to human chromosome (Hsa) 17q has been
identified in several non-mammalian taxa including reptiles (38) and fishes (39). In a previous study Voss et al.
(40) identified a region of conserved synteny between
Ambystoma and Hsa 17q that included collagen type 1
alpha 1 (Col1a1), thyroid hormone receptor alpha (Thra),
homeo box b13 (Hoxb13), and distal-less 3 (Dlx3) (Figure
4). To evaluate both the technical feasibility of mapping
ESTs and the likelihood that presumptive orthologues
map to the same synteny group, we searched our assemblies for presumptive Hsa 17 orthologues and then
developed a subset of these loci for genetic linkage mapping. Using a joint assembly of A. mexicanum and A. t.
tigrinum contigs, 97 Hsa 17 presumptive orthologues were
identified. We chose 15 genes from this list and designed
PCR primers to amplify a short DNA fragment containing
1 or more presumptive SNPs that were identified in the
joint assembly (Table 9). All but two of these genes were
mapped, indicating a high probability of mapping success
using markers developed from the joint assembly of A.
mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum contigs. All 6 ESTs that
exhibited 'best hits' to loci within the previously defined
human-Ambystoma synteny group did map to this region
(Hspc009, Sui1, Krt17, Krt24, Flj13855, and Rpl19). Our
results show that BLAST-based definitions of orthology
are informative between salamanders and human. All
other presumptive Hsa 17 loci mapped to Ambystoma
chromosomal regions outside of the previously defined
synteny group. It is interesting to note that two of these
loci mapped to the same ambystomatid linkage group
(Cgi-125, Flj20345), but in human the presumptive orthologues are 50 Mb apart and distantly flank the syntenic
loci in Figure 4. Assuming orthology has been assigned
correctly for these loci, this suggests a dynamic history for
some Hsa 17 orthologues during vertebrate evolution.
Future directions
Ambystomatid salamanders are classic model organisms
that continue to inform biological research in a variety of
areas. Their future importance in regenerative biology and

bGenotyping

metamorphosis will almost certainly escalate as genome
resources and other molecular and cellular approaches
become widely available. Among the genomic resources
currently under development (see [41]) are a comparative
genome map, which will allow mapping of candidate
genes, QTL, and comparative anchors for cross-referencing the salamander genome to fully sequenced vertebrate
models. In closing, we reiterate a second benefit to
resource development in Ambystoma. Genome resources
in Ambystoma can be extended to multiple, closely related
species to explore the molecular basis of natural, phenotypic variation. Such extensions can better inform our

understanding of ambystomatid biodiversity in nature
and draw attention to the need for conserving such naturalistic systems. Several paedomorphic species, including
A. mexicanum, are on the brink of extinction. We can think
of no better investment than one that simultaneously
enhances research in all areas of biology and draws attention to the conservation needs of model organisms in
their natural habitats.

Conclusions
Approximately 40,000 cDNA sequences were isolated
from a variety of tissues to develop expressed sequence

tags for two model salamander species (A. mexicanum and
A. t. tigrinum). An approximately equivalent number of
contigs were identified for each species, with 21,091
unique contigs identified overall. The strategy to sequence
cDNAs from a diverse collection of tissues from normalized and non-normalized libraries yielded different sets of
highly redundant contigs. Only 25% and 28% of the A.
mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum contigs, respectively, were
identified in common. To demonstrate the utility of these
EST resources, we searched databases to identify new
probes for regeneration research, characterized intra- and
interspecific nucleotide polymorphism, saturated a
human/Ambystoma synteny group with marker loci, and
extended PCR primer sets designed for A. mexicanum / A.
t. tigrinum orthologues to a related tiger salamander species. Over 100 new probes were identified for regeneration research using informatic approaches. With respect to
comparative mapping, 13 of 15 EST markers were
mapped successfully, and 6 EST markers were mapped to
a previously defined synteny group in Ambystoma. These
results indicate a high probability of mapping success
using EST markers developed from the joint assembly of
A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum contigs. Finally, we found
that primer sets designed for A. mexicanum / A. t. tigrinum
EST orthologues can be used to amplify the corresponding
sequence in a related A. tigrinum complex species. Overall,
the EST resources reported here will enable a diversity of
new research areas using ambystomatid salamanders.

Methods
cDNA library construction
Ten cDNA libraries were constructed for the project using
various larval tissues of A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum
(Table 1). Larval A. mexicanum were obtained from adult
animals whose ancestry traces back to the Axolotl Colony
[17]. Larval A. t. tigrinum were obtained from Charles Sullivan Corp. The GARD and MATH A. mexicanum limb
regeneration libraries were constructed using regenerating
forelimb mesenchyme. Total RNAs were collected from
anterior and posterior limbs amputated at the mid-stylopod level on 15 cm animals, and from the resulting
regenerates at 12 h, 2 days, 5 days and early bud stages.
One hundred µg fractions of each were pooled together
and polyA-selected to yield 5 µg that was utilized for directional library construction (Lambda Zap, Stratagene). The
V1 (A. mex), V2 (A. tig), V4-5 (A. tig), and V6-7 (A. mex)
libraries were made from an assortment of larval tissues
(see Table 1) using the SMART cDNA cloning kits (Clontech). Total RNAs were isolated and reverse transcribed to
yield cDNAs that were amplified by long distance PCR
and subsequently cloned into pTriplEX. The V3 and AG
libraries were constructed by commercial companies
(BioS&T and Agencourt, respectively).

cDNA template preparation and sequencing
cDNA inserts were mass excised as phagemids, picked into
microtitre plates, grown overnight in LB broth, and then
diluted (1/20) to spike PCR reactions: (94°C for 2 min;
then 30 cycles at 94°C for 45 sec, 58°C for 45°sec, and
72°C for 7 min). All successful amplifications with inserts
larger than ~500 bp were sequenced (ABI Big Dye or
Amersham Dye terminator chemistry and 5' universal
primer). Sequencing and clean-up reactions was carried
out according to manufacturers' protocols. ESTs were
deposited into NCBI database under accession numbers
BI817205-BI818091 and CN033008-CN045937 and
CN045944-CN069430.
EST sequence processing and assembly
The PHRED base-calling program [42] was used to generate sequence and quality scores from trace files. PHRED
files were then quality clipped and vector/contaminant
screened. An in-house program called QUALSCREEN was
used to quality clip the ends of sequence traces. Starting at
the ends of sequence traces, this program uses a 20 bp
sliding window to identify a continuous run of bases that
has an average PHRED quality score of 15. Mitochondrial
DNA sequences were identified by searching all ESTs
against the complete mtDNA genome sequence of A. mexicanum (AJ584639). Finally, all sequences less than 100
bp were removed. The average length of the resulting ESTs
was 629 bp. The resulting high quality ESTs were clustered
initially using PaCE [43] on the U.K. HP Superdome computer. Multi-sequence clusters were used as input
sequence sets for assembly using CAP3 [44] with an 85%
sequence similarity threshold. Clusters comprising single
ESTs were assembled again using CAP3 with an 80%
sequence similarity threshold to identify multi-EST contigs that were missed during the initial analysis. This procedure identified 550 additional contigs comprising 1150
ESTs.
Functional annotation
All contigs and singletons were searched against the
human RefSeq database (Oct. 2003 release) using
BLASTX. The subset of sequences that yielded no BLAST
hit was searched against the non-redundant protein
sequence database (Feb. 2004) using BLASTX. The
remaining subset of sequences that yielded no BLAST hit
was searched against Xenopus laevis and X. tropicalis UNIGENE ESTs (Mar. 2004) using TBLASTX. Zebrafish ESTs
were downloaded from UNIGENE ESTs (May 2004).
BLAST searches were done with an E-value threshold of E
<10-7 unless specified.
Sequence comparison of A. mexicanum and A. t.
tigrinum assemblies
All low quality base calls within contigs were masked
using a PHRED base quality threshold of 16. To identify

polymorphisms for linkage mapping, contigs from A.
mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum assemblies were joined into
a single assembly using CAP3 and the following criteria:
an assembly threshold of 12 bp to identify initial matches,
a minimum 100 bp match length, and 85% sequence
identity. To identify putatively orthologous genes from A.
mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum assemblies, and generate an
estimate of gene sequence divergence, assemblies were
compared using BLASTN with a threshold of E <10-20.
Following BLAST, alignments were filtered to obtain
reciprocal best BLAST hits.
Extending A. mexicanum / A. t. tigrinum sequence
information to A. ordinarium
Polymorphic DNA marker loci were identified by locating
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the joint A.
mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum assembly. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) primers were designed using Primer 3 [45]
to amplify 100 – 500 bp SNP-containing fragments from
123 different protein-coding loci (Table 8). DNA was isolated from salamander tail clips using SDS, RNAse and
proteinase K treatment, followed by phenol-chloroform
extraction. Fragments were amplified using 150 ng DNA,
75 ng each primer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 U Taq, and a 3step profile (94°C for 4 min; 33 cycles of 94°C for 45 s,
60°C for 45 s, 72°C for 30 s; and 72°C for 7 min). DNA
fragments were purified and sequenced using ABI Big Dye
or Amersham Dye terminator chemistry. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms were identified by eye from
sequence alignments.
Linkage mapping of human chromosome 17 orthologous
genes
Putative salamander orthologues of genes on human
chromosome 17 (Hsa 17) were identified by comparing
the joint A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum assembly to
sequences from the human RefSeq (NCBI) protein database, using BLASTX at threshold E<10-7. Linkage distance
and arrangement among markers was estimated using
MapManager QTXb19 software [46] and the Kosambi
mapping function at a threshold of p = 0.001. All markers
were mapped using DNA from a previously described
meiotic mapping panel [40]. All PCR primers and primer
extension probes were designed using Primer 3 [45] and
Array Designer2 (Premier Biosoft) software. Species-specific polymorphisms were assayed by allele specific amplification, restriction digestion, or primer extension, using
the reagent and PCR conditions described above. Primer
extension markers were genotyped using the AcycloPrimeFP SNP detection assay (Perkin Elmer). See Table 9 for
amplification and extension primer sequences, and information about genotyping methodology.
