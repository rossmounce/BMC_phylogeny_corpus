<p>Comparative analysis R1 and R2 retrotransposons
Evolution and integration of 12 Drosophila genomes reveals insights into the evolution and mechanism of integration of R1 and R2 retrotransposons.</p>

Abstract
Background: Most arthropods contain R1 and R2 retrotransposons that specifically insert into
the 28S rRNA genes. Here, the sequencing reads from 12 Drosophila genomes have been used to
address two questions concerning these elements. First, to what extent is the evolution of these
elements subject to the concerted evolution process that is responsible for sequence homogeneity
among the different copies of rRNA genes? Second, how precise are the target DNA cleavages and
priming of DNA synthesis used by these elements?
Results: Most copies of R1 and R2 in each species were found to exhibit less than 0.2% sequence
divergence. However, in many species evidence was obtained for the formation of distinct
sublineages of elements, particularly in the case of R1. Analysis of the hundreds of R1 and R2
junctions with the 28S gene revealed that cleavage of the first DNA strand was precise both in
location and the priming of reverse transcription. Cleavage of the second DNA strand was less
precise within a species, differed between species, and gave rise to variable priming mechanisms for
second strand synthesis.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that the high sequence identity amongst R1 and R2 copies is
because all copies are relatively new. However, each active element generates its own independent
lineage that can eventually populate the locus. Independent lineages occur more often with R1,
possibly because these elements contain their own promoter. Finally, both R1 and R2 use
imprecise, rapidly evolving mechanisms to cleave the second strand and prime second strand
synthesis.

Background

Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous components and
extensive manipulators of eukaryotic genomes. Because TEs
constitute a significant mutation source and their remnants
often comprise the majority of genomes, they are usually
regarded as genomic parasites that are occasionally co-opted

for host benefits [1,2]. While tracing the evolution of any
genome should include a description of the natural history of
its transposable elements, the diversity of TEs and their histories are so extensive that even with the advent of genome
sequencing and assembly it remains challenging to follow the
interplay between TEs and their host.

The rRNA genes provide a microcosm within the genome that
is amenable to a detailed description of the interactions
between TEs and their host. In eukaryotes these genes are
organized into one or more loci, the rDNA loci, containing
hundreds to thousands of copies of the 18S, 5.8S and 28S
genes (Figure 1) [3]. A number of TEs specifically insert into
the 28S genes of different animals [4]. The most extensively
studied of these elements are the non-long terminal repeat
(non-LTR) retrotransposable elements R1 and R2 of arthropods [5]. These two elements appear to have been inserting in
the 28S genes of most arthropods since the origin of this phylum [6,7]. R2 elements have also been identified in a variety
of other animal lineages [8,9]. The retrotransposition mechanism of R2 elements has been studied in detail [10,11]. The
current model for their integration, called target primed
reverse transcription (TPRT), has four basic steps: first, the
bottom DNA strand of the target site is cleaved; second, the
released 3' hydroxyl is used to prime cDNA synthesis by the
element's reverse transcriptase; third, the top DNA strand is
cleaved; and fourth, the released 3' hydroxyl is used to prime
second-strand DNA synthesis [11]. This basic mechanism is
likely used by R1 [12,13] and most other non-LTR retrotransposons [14].
Evolution of the rDNA locus is known to be dominated by
concerted evolution, a recombinational process involving
unequal crossovers and gene conversions that maintain near
identity among repeats within a species while allowing those
repeats to diverge between species [15]. Abundant evidence
corroborates the extremely low sequence variation present
among the many copies of the rDNA unit [16-18]. Sequence
variants present at the lowest frequencies are equally distributed between the coding and non-coding regions of the unit.
In contrast, the rare variants present at higher frequencies are
greatly enriched in non-coding regions, indicating that selective pressures guide the extent of standing variation within
the locus [18].

The rDNA loci of Drosophila species
The rDNA loci of Drosophila species. Each rDNA transcription unit
(diagramed in detail) consists of the 18S, 5.8S, 2S and 28S genes, the
external transcribed spacer (ETS) and internal transcribed spacers (ITS1,
ITS2a and ITS2). The location of the R1 and R2 insertion sites are
indicated with arrowheads. Transcription units are separated by an
internally repetitive intergenic spacer (IGS). The rDNA loci are usually,
but not always, located on the X and Y chromosomes and typically contain
hundreds of copies of the rDNA unit arranged in tandem arrays.

Stage and Eickbush R49.2

In arthropods from a few percent to over 50% of the rDNA
units are inserted by R1 or R2 elements [19], and those units
are thus prevented from producing functional 28S rRNA
[20]. Within a species these many copies of R1 and R2 elements also exhibit low levels of sequence variation [21]. Surprisingly, divergent lineages of R1 or R2 are frequently found
in a species, which cannot be explained by horizontal transfers between species [22]. This suggests that divergent lineages of elements must be able to form within a species.
The rDNA locus is not assembled as part of genome projects
because of the highly repetitive nature of the rDNA locus.
Thus, in this report we used the original sequencing reads
generated from the 12 Drosophila genomes project [23] to
address specific questions concerning the evolution and
mechanism of integration of R1 and R2 elements. Can different lineages of R1 and R2 arise within a species despite concerted evolution maintaining sequence homogeneity among
the rRNA genes? What is the location of second-strand DNA
cleavage? How is this site used to prime second-strand synthesis in the retrotransposition reaction?

Results and discussion

The phylogenetic relationships among the 12 Drosophila species used in this report are shown in Figure 2a. This phylogeny, based on the complete sequences of the18S and 28S
genes, is consistent with the species relationships obtained
with many other gene sequences [23]. In eight of the Drosophila species a complete R2 element could be assembled
(Figure 2b; Additional data files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). The
structure of these elements conformed to previously identified R2 elements [24] and dN/dS analysis indicated that the
assembled R2 elements had undergone purifying selection
(mean dN/dS = 0.24 with a standard deviation of 0.321). In a
ninth species, D. mojavensis, R2 sequences were identified
but too few copies existed to assemble a complete sequence.
R2 elements have been previously documented in several species groups of the Drosophila subgenus [25]; however, our
failure to detect R2 sequences in D. virilis and D. grimshawi
suggests R2 elements are frequently lost from this subgenus.
The only example of R2 loss in the Sophophora subgenus, D.
erecta, had been previously noted [26].
We also searched in all species for R2 copies that might be
present outside the rDNA locus. We found no extra-rDNA R2
copies in D. melanogaster, as previously reported [27], or in
D. ananassae or D. persimilis. D. pseudoobscura, D. sechellia, D. simulans, D. willistoni, and D. yakuba each had R2
copies not inserted in a 28S gene. These copies were frequently incomplete and all contained sequences that were
from 1% to 2% divergent from those R2 copies within the
rDNA locus. Thus, these non-rDNA copies of R2 could not
have given rise to the current populations of R2 insertions in
the rDNA locus. Finally, in D. simulans a fusion of the 5' end

ferentially retained in the various species lineages [28].
Eleven of the sequenced Drosophila species contained a single R1 family of either the R1A or R1B lineage, while D. ananassae contained both lineages (Figure 2b). The only
consistent difference in structure between the two lineages
was that the two ORFs in the R1A lineage overlapped by 7 bp
with a corresponding frame shift of -2, while the ORFs in the
R1B lineage had a frameshift of -1 and overlapped from 14 bp
in D. ananassae to 59 bp in D. grimshawi. As will be
described below, in most species multiple examples were also
identified of R1 insertions in non-28S gene locations.

The average levels of sequence variation among the elements
within each species are shown in Table 1. Because R1 insertions were found in genomic locations outside the 28S gene,
we focused our analysis on the first and last 400 bp of each
element and 100 bp of their flanking sequence to insure that
all sequences were derived from copies located in the 28S
rRNA genes. Except in the specific examples described below,
the R1 and R2 elements in each species were extremely uniform, averaging less than 0.2% divergence from the consensus sequence. Because R2 elements are seldom present
outside the locus, we also monitored nucleotide variation
within internal regions of R2 elements in some species.
Sequence divergence for central, coding regions of R2 were
estimated at less than 0.1%, similar to or slightly lower than
the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs; not shown).

of an R1 element with the 3' end of an R2 element was identified as a tandem array outside the rDNA locus.
Complete R1 elements were assembled in all 12 sequenced
genomes (Figure 2b; Additional data files 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21). The coding capacity of all R1
ORFs was consistent with previously characterized R1 elements [24]. A test of selection by dN/dS analysis indicated
that the assembled R1 elements had undergone purifying
selection (R1A, mean dN/dS = 0.30 with standard deviation
of 0.376; R1B, mean dN/dS = 0.27 with standard deviation of
0.348). Previous analyses of R1 elements in Drosophila have
suggested there are two distinct lineages of elements, A and B,
that separated well before the origin of this genus and are dif-

In Figure 3 the level of nucleotide variation for the 5' and 3'
ends of R1 and R2 shown in Table 1 are compared to the levels
of nucleotide variation previously found in the 28S genes and
internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 regions of the rDNA units
[18]. The levels of variation present in R1 and R2 were much
higher than that of the 28S gene, and similar to that of the
ITS1 region. We have previously shown that the level of nucleotide variation for different regions of the rDNA unit was proportional to the rate at which each region diverged between
species [18]. This correlation is expected if all regions of the
transcribed rDNA unit undergo similar levels of concerted
evolution, because increased selective constraints on a
sequence removes more variants that arise by mutation,
which in turn enables fewer neutral variants to become fixed
in all rDNA units (diverge over time). Also shown in Figure 3
(gray bars) are the nucleotide divergence rates of R1 and R2
compared to those for the 28S gene and the ITS1 region.
These divergence rates were determined by comparing the
consensus sequences of each region from D. melanogaster,
D. sechellia, D. simulans and D. yakuba. The relationship
between the levels of variation within a species and divergence rates between species that was observed for regions of
the rDNA unit was not observed for the R1 and R2 sequences.
For example, the 5' end of R1 evolved at four times the rate of
the R1 3' end, yet had similar levels of nucleotide variation.
The 5' and 3' ends of R2 evolved at one-half the rate of the
ITS1 sequences, yet had two to four times the level of nucle-

otide variation within a species. In this latter example, the
slower rate of divergence suggests that the R2 sequences are
under greater selective pressure than the ITS1 sequences.
Therefore, the finding that the R2 sequences have greater levels of variation suggests that they are not undergoing concerted evolution as effectively as the ITS1 sequences.

ORFs. Because most divergent copies were not inserted into
28S genes that were also divergent, these R1 and R2 copies
could represent distinct retrotranspositionally competent lineages of elements. However, the number of trace reads suggested these divergent R1s and R2s were at single copy levels,
and thus it was likely that they had not recently been active.

Nascent subfamilies of R1 and R2

Stronger evidence for the formation of nascent subfamilies
was found in the examples of distinct 5' ends for the R1 elements of three species ('Variant 5' ends' column in Table 1). In
D. simulans there were five distinct sequence classes of R1 5'
ends, with each class representing from 11% to 26% of the
total number of copies. There was no nucleotide divergence
within each class, while divergence between classes ranged
from 1% to 3%. In the case of D. pseudoobscura there were
two distinct 5' ends. One-third of the R1 copies had 5' ends

In addition to the many highly uniform copies of R1 and R2,
five Drosophila species had one or more copies of R1 or R2
with nucleotide divergence of 1% to 7% from the consensus,
clearly outside the range of divergences seen for the remaining R1 and R2 copies. The number and level of divergence of
these atypical copies are listed in Table 1. Among these copies
two had premature stop codons, indicating that they were
inactive, while the remaining copies appeared to have intact

Sequence variation in the 400 bp at the 5' and 3' ends of the R1 and R2
elements from the 12 Drosophila species, the entire 28S rRNA gene and
the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 region are shown (black bars). All
values are calculated as the divergence from the consensus sequence for
the species. Grey bars indicate the rates of nucleotide divergence (percent
divergence per million years (myr)) of these same regions. Standard
deviations are given for all values. The high standard deviation of the R1 5'
end is a result of several species with no variation. The divergence data
estimates were derived from comparison of the consensus sequences
from D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. melanogaster and D. yakuba (divergence
times: simulans versus sechellia, 0.25 myr; simulans or sechellia versus
melanogaster, 3 myr; simulans, sechellia or melanogaster versus yakuba, 8
myr). Nucleotide variation data for 28S and ITS1 regions are derived from
Supplemental Table 2 of [18].

Finally, Figure 4 summarizes two examples where the formation of nascent families involves sequence divergence of the
entire R1 and R2 elements. In D. grimshawi two equally represented groups of R1B elements were detected that had 21%
nucleotide divergence at their 5' ends and lower levels in
other regions of the element (Figure 4a; Additional data files
12 and 22). The level of divergence for most regions of the two
families was less than the divergence between the R1 elements of D. melanogaster and D. simulans, also shown in
Figure 4a, suggesting the two R1B subfamilies in D. grimshawi are not as old as the estimated 3 million year separation between D. melanogaster and D. simulans [34]. The 5'
ends of the subfamilies have undergone accelerated rates of
divergence, similar to that described for the different 5' ends
of R1 elements in D. ananassae, D. simulans and D. pseudoobscura (Table 1).
A second example of the presence of subfamilies within a species was found for the R2 elements in D. willistoni. In this
case one subfamily, R2.1, was highly abundant while the R2.2

The separate lineages of the R1 5' ends observed in these three
species were not apparent at the 3' ends of the R1 elements
(that is, there was one class of 3' ends with mean levels of
divergence less than 0.2%). Previous authors have suggested
that new sublineages of transposable elements can arise
within the same species by the acquisition of new promoter
sequences [29,30]. Thus, one possibility is that the different
5' ends of R1 elements in a species correspond to rapidly
evolving promoter sequences. R1 elements have been suggested to contain their own promoters because in some insect
lineages R1 inserts in the opposite orientation in the 28S
gene, or even outside the rDNA locus [9,31]. R2 elements on
the other hand appear to be co-transcribed with the 28S gene
and thus do not have their own promoter [32,33]. No evi-

showed the greatest tendency to diverge into subclasses with
distinct 5' ends. The R1A elements could be separated into
two classes that differed by 10% in nucleotide sequence, while
the R1B elements could be separated into four classes that differed by 15% to 22% in sequence.

subfamily (Additional data file 23) was present in only a few
copies. As shown in Figure 4b the subfamilies have diverged
by 4.7% in their 5' UTRs and 3.6% in their 3' UTRs, similar to
the divergence between the R2 elements of D. melanogaster
and D. simulans. The amino acid divergence of the ORF from
the two subfamilies (2.6%) was also similar to the divergence
between D. simulans and D. melanogaster (2.4%), suggesting the divergence time between the D. willistoni subfamilies
is similar to the time of divergence of D. melanogaster and D.
simulans.
Unequal crossover events occurring within R1 (or R2) elements would homogenize their sequences, thus preventing
the separation of two distinct lineages. Because the nucleotide
divergence for most of the region encoding ORF2 of the R1B.1
and R1B.2 elements in D. grimshawi was less than 1%, and
thus could still undergo recombination, we looked for evidence of such events. Blast searches were conducted using a
query from the end of each subfamily. We then examined the
sequence trace from the other end of each approximately 3.5
kb plasmid to determine whether it contained sequence from
the same or opposite subfamily. Of 115 informative plasmid
ends examined, only one pair indicated recombination
between the subfamilies. This paucity of recombination can
explain how these nascent subfamilies are able to avoid concerted evolution and remain independent lineages.

Drosophila genomes were inserted into the same site as previously characterized R2 elements in all animals [5,35]. This
location corresponds to the site of bottom strand DNA cleavage by the R2 endonuclease from Bombyx mori (Figure 5c).
This cleavage site serves as the primer for reverse transcription of the element RNA [10]. For about 1% of the R2 insertions identified in the Drosophila genomes, bottom-strand
cleavage appears to have occurred 1 or 2 bp downstream of
this usual site. The uncertainty in cleavage location is because
the second nucleotide downstream of the typical cleavage site
is an 'A' and all Drosophila R2s end in a variable length polyA tail (Figure 5a).
In vitro studies with the B. mori R2 endonuclease suggested
the location of top-strand cleavage occurred 2 bp upstream of
the bottom-strand site (Figure 5c) [10]. Previous analyses of a
few R2 5' junctions from each of several Drosophila species,
as well as other insect species, were interpreted in a manner
that was consistent with such a cleavage [36,37]. However,
there is significant variation at the 5' junctions of R2 elements, and the comprehensive analysis of this variation made
possible using the genomic sequences suggested a reevaluation of this second-strand cleavage location was needed.

Figure sequences of the R2 elements with the 28S gene
Junction5
Junction sequences of the R2 elements with the 28S gene. (a) 3' junction
sequences. All Drosophila R2 elements contain 3' poly(A) tails. Most R2
insertions are consistent with the location of the R2 DNA cleavage sites
on the bottom strand (see panel (c)) and its use in priming reverse
transcription. (b) Representative examples of the 5' junctions of R2
elements with the 28S gene. All full-length examples are from D.
melanogaster. R2 sequences are boxed, 28S sequences are in bold, nontemplated sequences are in plain text, and duplications of 28S sequences
are underlined. Boxed residues shaded grey correspond to
microhomologies: sequences that could correspond to either the 28S
sequence or the R2 element. (c) Location of the probable cleavage sites
on the 28S gene. Arrows show cleavage locations determined in vitro for
the R2 endonuclease from B. mori [10]; the arrow head topped by '0'
shows the location of the top-strand cleavage site inferred after analysis of
the Drosophila R2 5' junctions. The bottom diagram shows a hypothetical
intermediate in the integration reaction after first-strand synthesis (boxed
nucleotides) and second strand cleavage. The terminal two nucleotides of
the cDNA are proposed to anneal to the top strand of the cleaved target
site. This microhomology allows precise priming of second-strand DNA
synthesis and the generation of the precise junctions seen in example a in
panel (b).

Similar to most non-LTR retrotransposons, R2 insertions can
be full-length or contain truncations of their 5' ends. The 5'
truncations have been suggested to be due to the failure of the
reverse transcriptase to copy the entire RNA template, degradation of the RNA template, or the initiation of second-strand

melanogaster but are representative of the R2 elements
observed in all Drosophila species. Almost two-thirds of the
full-length insertions have 5' junctions that include the 28S
sequence to the position across from the site of bottom-strand
cleavage, position '0' (examples a, d and e), with the remaining third containing variable deletions of the upstream 28S
sequence (examples b and c). Many junctions contain additional bases at the junction. In some cases the additional
bases represented duplications of the 28S gene (example e),
while for other junctions the origin of the additional bases
could not be identified, here called non-templated bases
(example d). In the case of the 5' truncated elements most
junctions contain from one to five bases at the precise 28S/R2

junction that may be assigned to either 28S or R2 (examples
of these microhomologies are indicated by the shaded bases
in Figure 5). R2 5' truncated junctions can also be associated
with deletions of upstream 28S sequences (examples g and h),
and non-templated additions (example i).
Figure 6 is an attempt to summarize the 5' junction data for
the R2 copies in several species. Plotted in these figures is the
last contiguous nucleotide of the 28S gene found for each R2
insertion. For most full-length copies the last 28S nucleotide
corresponded to the position opposite the bottom-strand
cleavage site (Figures 5c and 6a). In the case of the 5' truncated R2 elements (Figure 6b), more copies are associated
with deletions of 28S sequences, but again the most frequent
final base of the 28S gene is opposite bottom-strand cleavage.

R2 retrotransposition model
This analysis of the 5' junctions of R2 insertions supports the
following additions to the TPRT model for R2 retrotransposition. First, the most frequently used top-strand cleavage site
in Drosophila is directly opposite the bottom-strand site,
rather than 2 bp upstream (position -2) as suggested from the
in vitro studies with the R2 endonuclease from B. mori [10].
Cleavage opposite the bottom-strand site readily explains
junctions such as examples d, e and i in Figure 5b, junctions
difficult to explain if top-strand cleavage was at position -2.
Second, we suggest that full-length R2 RNA transcripts in
Drosophila contain G residues at their 5' end. All integrated
full-length R2 copies in D. melanogaster begin with four G
residues (examples a to e in Figure 5b), and similar analysis
of the other Drosophila species indicated that the full-length
R2 elements in these species contained at least two terminal
G residues (data not shown). No conservation of R2 5' end
sequences is found beyond these two Gs.
To explain the most frequently observed R2 full length junctions (example a in Figure 5b), we suggest that two terminal
C residues on the cDNA strand made from the R2 transcript
anneal to the cleaved target site (see Figure 5c for a diagram).
A tendency to anneal a few nucleotides of the cDNA strand to
the top strand of the target DNA before initiating secondstrand DNA synthesis would explain the frequent 'microhomologies' between internal R2 sequences and upstream
28S sequences that are found associated with 5' truncated R2
insertions. The non-templated nucleotides found at the 5'
junctions of full-length and truncated copies of R2 are suggested to result when the annealing of microhomologies does
not occur. In vitro studies have shown that the R2 polymerase
adds non-templated nucleotides before initiating from a
primer that is not annealed to the template [38], as well as
when it 'runs-off' the end of a template [39]. These non-templated nucleotides can be of any sequence and thus could also
lead to microhomologies used to initiate polymerization of
the top DNA strand. Microhomologies between these nontemplated nucleotides and the 28S gene would go undetected
by our analysis. Finally, the R2 junctions with deletions of the
28S gene, as well as the few with duplications of the 28S gene,
could represent top-strand cleavages outside the preferred
site.

Mechanism of R1 retrotransposition
R1 junction sequences
Based on their 3' junctions with the 28S gene, all R1 elements
within the 28S gene are located 60 bp downstream of the R2
insertion site. In vitro studies with the B. mori R1 endonuclease suggest this site corresponds to the location of the bottom-strand DNA cleavage site used to prime a TPRT reaction
[12,13]. As in the case of R2, the 5' ends of both full-length and
truncated R1 copies showed significant variation (Figure 7).
Based on their 5' junctions the R1 elements could be divided
into two groups. For R1B elements and the R1A elements out-

Volume 10, Issue 5, Article R49

Stage and Eickbush R49.8

side the melanogaster species group, the upstream 28S gene
sequences typically extended to a position 14 bp downstream
of the bottom-strand site (+14), and thus a 14 bp target site
duplication (TSD) flanks the R1 insertions (Figure 7, left
side). Because similar length TSDs flank the R1 elements in
most other arthropods [40,41], this group is called the 'ancestral type' R1 insertions. All sequence variation associated with
the 5' junctions of both full-length and 5' truncated elements
of the ancestral type were located at the end of the TSD
(bracketed region in Figure 7). As with the R2 elements, these
5' junctions could be classified as precise, containing microhomologies, or containing non-templated nucleotides. Most
full-length ancestral type R1 insertions were precise, with the
remainder containing non-templated nucleotides. The 5'
truncated ancestral R1s are more broadly distributed between
precise, non-templated and microhomology junctions.
In contrast to the ancestral type R1s, many copies of the R1A
elements in the melanogaster species group (D. ananassae,
D. erecta, D. melanogaster, D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D.
yakuba) contained upstream 28S gene sequences that
extended only to position -9. The relative proportion varied
from species to species, but altogether 75% of the full-length
'melanogaster-type' R1 insertions contained this 9 bp deletion. No 5' sequence variation was associated with these
insertions. The remaining full-length insertions contained
variable-length TSDs up to 17 bp in length and an unusual
duplication of 28S sequences that we called insertion site
rearrangements (ISRs). These duplications of the 28S
sequence extended for 16 to 27 nucleotides upstream of position -9. Microhomologies and non-templated nucleotides
were common at these junctions and were always located
between the TSD and the ISR (bracketed region). The 5' truncated insertions of the melanogaster-type R1s also contained
precise, non-templated and microhomology junctions.
Figure 8 is again a plot of the last contiguous nucleotide of the
28S gene found at the 5' end of the R1 elements in several species. In the case of the ancestral type R1s, the full-length and
5' truncated junctions are consistent with a top-strand cleavage at position +14. Most exceptions to this cleavage location
were in D. ananassae, where R1B insertions made an 11 or 13
bp TSD, and in D. willistoni where some R1B insertions contained an 8 bp TSD. The probable locations of the top-strand
cleavage for the melanogaster-type full-length R1 elements
(Figure 8b) were clustered about two locations. Precise fulllength insertions had top-strand cleavage at position -9. For
the full-length ISR elements and the 5' truncated elements
top-strand cleavages were less specific but clustered around
position +14.

Tandem R1 arrays
In seven of the Drosophila species R1 elements were found
organized as tandem arrays (Table 2). Evaluation of the
sequencing reads at the other end of clones containing tandem R1s revealed that many, and perhaps all, of these tandem

Figure 7
Full length and 5' truncated junctions of the Drosophila R1 insertions
Full length and 5' truncated junctions of the Drosophila R1 insertions. Shown at the top is the sequence of the 28S gene insertion site. Various regions of
the sequence have been indicated with colors to allow the 5' and 3' junctions of the R1 insertions to be summarized. Position +1 corresponds to the
position of bottom-strand cleavage based on the 3' junctions of all R1 elements as well as from in vitro studies of the R1 endonuclease [12,13]. Positions -9
and +14 correspond to the inferred most frequent sites of top-strand cleavage. Shown at the bottom are diagrams of the 5' and 3' junctions of R1
insertions. Full-length as well as 5' truncated insertions of the ancestral type R1s have 14 bp target site duplications (left side). The bracketed region of the
junctions exhibited sequence variation. This variation can correspond to non-templated nucleotides (sequences corresponding to neither the 28S gene nor
the R1 element), or microhomologies (1 to 5 nucleotides that could correspond to either the 28S gene or the R1 element). Melanogaster group R1s have
three classes of junctions (right side): full length insertions with a precise 9 bp target site deletion; full length insertions with an insertion site
rearrangement (ISR); and 5' truncated insertions. Sequence variation at these junctions is limited to the bracketed region and corresponds to the variation
seen in the ancestral type R1s. The tables at the bottom show the fraction of copies observed at the bracketed site that are precise, contain non-templated
nucleotides (extra nt) or microhomologies (micro).

R1 elements were located within the rDNA loci. These tandem
arrays were located at the normal R1 insertion site with the
individual R1 copies separated by the 14 bp 28S gene
sequence corresponding to the typical TSD. Such R1 tandem
arrays have been previously described in D. virilis [42].
Because R1 insertions were never found inserted upstream of
R1 insertions without the TSD in these species, the mechanism of tandem R1 formation appears to be the insertion of
additional R1 elements into the TSD present at the 5' end of
R1 elements already inserted into a 28S gene. Consistent with
this, melanogaster-type R1 elements have no or few tandem
R1 insertions (Table 2, but see the legend). The highest levels
of tandem insertions were in D. pseudoobscura and D. ananassae R1B where each R1-inserted rDNA unit contained an
average of two to three R1 elements.

R1 insertions into non-28S locations
In most Drosophila species copies of R1 were also identified
that had inserted into sequences outside the 28S gene (Table

2). Frequent R1 insertions outside the 28S gene have also
been reported in B. mori [43]. The Drosophila species with
the most abundant examples of non-28S R1 insertions were
D. ananassae and D. pseudoobscura, the two species with the
highest levels of tandem duplications. This may suggest that
R1 insertions in these species are either less specific or retrotranspose more often. We identified 118 unique examples of
non-28S gene R1 insertions that had intact 3' junctions, suggesting that they represented authentic retrotransposition
events, not segments of R1 sequence that had been displaced
by recombination to locations outside the rDNA locus. The
insertion sites for these copies frequently corresponded to
repeated DNA sequences, probably in the pericentromeric or
telomeric regions of the genome. An exception was in D.
ananassae, where a 22 bp region of the 28S gene corresponding to the R1 28S insertion site was found in the IGS region of
the rDNA unit. One R1A element and seven R1B elements
were found in rDNA units containing this unusual insertion of
28S sequences within the IGS.

indicates absence. â Unlike the tandem R1s in the ancestral group, the
sequence between the many tandem-like, consecutive R1 elements in
D. melanogaster is typical of that found in an insertion site
rearrangement (ISR) junction. Unlike the highly variable ISR junctions
found in the locus, the ISRs between these tandem-like R1s are the
same. Thus, these elements are likely the result of amplification of an
original unique event. â¡All found upstream of R1B.

Because the insertions had occurred into repeated DNA
sequences we were able to identify the likely target sequences
for some of the R1 insertions. Figure 9 shows examples in
which we were able to identify either or both 5' and 3' ends of
the insertions and their likely target sequences. In all cases
where both junctions were recovered (Figure 9a), the target
sites contained from 4 to 9 bp of sequence identity to the 28S
target site centered near the lower strand cleavage site, and
the insertions generated TSDs of from 3 to 14 bp.
The 5' junctions of all melanogaster-type full length R1s outside the rDNA array contained upstream 28S gene sequences
ending at position -9 and extending upstream for 7 to 28 bp
(Figure 9, examples 5 to 10). The 5' ends of the ancestral type
R1 insertions showed no evidence for the insertion of flanking
28S rRNA sequence (examples 1 to 4 and 11). The 3' junctions
of both the ancestral and melanogaster-type R1s were similar,
with most beginning at the precise 3' junction of the R1. However, some insertions showed the incorporation of up to 14
nucleotides of downstream 28S sequences (example 13) or
the presence of non-templated nucleotides (example 12).

R1 retotransposition model
The analysis of the R1 5' junctions with the 28S genes, as well
as the insertions into non-28S gene locations, enables us to

reaction. These suggestions are based on the standard TPRT
mechanism of R2 and other non-LTR retrotransposons and
the ability of their polymerases to add non-templated nucleotides at the ends of synthesized DNA strands. First, because
no variation was detected within a species or between species
for the location of the bottom-strand cleavage used to prime
reverse transcription, like R2, this is the most conserved step
in the retrotransposition reaction of R1. The analysis of R1
insertions outside the 28S gene site revealed that downstream 28S gene sequences are sometimes also inserted with
the R1 element. In addition, many of these non-28S gene target sites contain bases corresponding to the 28S gene (examples 1 to 6 in Figure 9). Together these data suggest that the 3'
end of the R1 transcript used for retrotransposition often contains flanking 28S sequences. These flanking 28S sequences
may anneal to the bottom strand of the target site and thus
account for why there is little sequence variation associated
with the 3' junctions of R1.
For all ancestral type R1s, top strand DNA cleavage is predominantly located 14 bp downstream of the bottom-strand
cleavage. This top-strand cleavage location, among others,
was also detected for the R1 endonuclease of B. mori [12,13].
The use of this cleavage to prime second strand synthesis

appeared in D. ananassae R1B elements, which had 11 and 13
bp TSDs, and in D willistoni R1B elements where several
examples of elements with 8 bp TSDs were detected. The
priming of second-strand synthesis appears less precise than
first-strand synthesis, sometimes involving the addition of
non-templated nucleotides. This suggests that the cDNA
strand does not efficiently anneal to the cleaved top strand,
suggesting few if any nucleotides of upstream 28S sequence
are included at the 5' end of the R1 transcript. Consistent with
this suggestion, no flanking 28S sequences were associated
with the ancestral-type non-28S R1 insertions.
R1A lineage elements in the melanogaster species group
appear to have evolved changes in the TPRT reaction. In these
R1s, top-strand cleavage frequently occurs 9 bp upstream of
bottom-strand cleavage, resulting in a 9 bp target site deletion. Priming of second-strand synthesis from this site is
highly precise, that is, non-templated sequences were never
observed, suggesting 28S gene sequences are included at the
5' end of the RNA transcripts used for retrotransposition.
This flanking 28S sequence allows the reverse transcribed
strand to anneal to the target site (Figure 10, middle). Consistent with this suggestion, from 7 to 28 bp of flanking 28S
sequences ending at position -9 are associated with the non28S gene insertions of the melanogaster-type R1. The R1A
elements in the melanogaster group also appear able to cleave

various regions upstream and downstream of the target site are colored as in Figure 7. Left side: ancestral type R1 transcripts (wavy line) do not contain
upstream 28S gene sequences. Ancestral type R1s cleave the top DNA strand 14 bp downstream of the bottom cleavage site. Nucleotide variation at the
5' junctions corresponds to the imprecise nature by which the R1 polymerase uses the top strand of the DNA target to prime second-strand DNA
synthesis. Right side: full length melanogaster-type R1 transcripts include 28S sequences starting upstream of position -9. Cleavage of the top strand occurs
at one of two sites. If top-strand cleavage occurs 9 bp upstream of the bottom-strand site, then the upstream RNA sequences can anneal to the end of the
cDNA strand, resulting in a precise 9 bp deletion of the target site. If top-strand cleavage occurs downstream of the bottom-strand site, then the annealing
of cDNA to the target site is not possible, generating variation at the junction of the target site duplication.

the top DNA strand in a less specific manner around position
+14 (Figure 8b). Such cleavages result in ISR junctions in
which a typical TSD is present followed by 16 to 27 bp of the
28S gene ending at position -9 (Figure 10, right side). Considerable variation is detected in these junctions between the
TSD and the duplicated upstream 28S sequences, presumably
because this downstream cleavage eliminates the ability of
cDNA sequences to anneal to the top strand in the initiation
of second-strand synthesis. An intriguing aspect of these melanogaster-type R1 elements is that all 5' truncated insertions
have TSDs (Figure 8), suggesting they can only arise from
downstream cleavage of the top strand. One possibility is that
the default cleavage site for the R1 endonuclease is downstream of the insertion site, but the 5' end of the full-length R1
transcripts acts as a signal directing the cleavage site to the
position at -9.

Conclusions
Origin of nascent lineages
The availability of whole genome shotgun sequences has enabled us to evaluate the level of sequence variation of the R1
and R2 elements in 12 species of Drosophila. The level of
nucleotide divergence for most copies was typically less than
0.2%, suggesting either the elements are subject to the same
concerted evolution mechanisms that enable the rRNA genes
themselves to remain nearly identical, or that the R1 and R2
elements are gained and lost rapidly from the locus (that is, all
copies are recent insertions). All previous analysis suggested
the latter explanation. Analyses of the 5' truncated copies of
R1 and R2 in several species have suggested that these elements do turnover rapidly. Different animals from the same
population were found to have different collections of 5' truncated copies [44,45] and most 5' truncated elements within
an animal had not undergone duplication by recombination
[46,47]. Thus, the individual copies of R1 and R2 do not
appear to remain in the rDNA locus for long enough periods
to be substantially influenced by the recombinations leading
to the concerted evolution of the locus.
One puzzling aspect concerning the evolution of R1 and R2
was the presence of multiple families in some species, yet no
evidence for the origin of these lineages by horizontal transfer
[28,48]. The rapid turnover of individual R1 and R2 elements
suggests that each active copy can generate its own lineage,
which over time should accumulate sequence variation. Thus,
while separate lineages of R1 and R2 should be able to arise,
the question remained as to whether they could be maintained within a species. In this report we have for the first
time detected these nascent lineages of R1 and R2 elements
within a species. Two distinct subfamilies of R1B elements
were detected in D. grimshawi and two distinct subfamilies
of R2 elements in D. willistoni (Figure 4). In addition to these
distinct lineages, other species contained individual copies of
R1 or R2 that had from 1% to 7% nucleotide divergence from
the majority of elements in the species. Many of these diver-

Stage and Eickbush R49.13

gent copies had intact ORFs, and thus were potentially active.
Another frequent finding was the presence of distinct 5' UTRs
for the R1 elements (Table 1). This was most widespread in D.
ananassae where the R1A elements could be divided into two
groups that diverged 10% in their 5' UTR sequences, while the
R1B elements could be divided into four groups with 5' UTRs
that diverged from 15% to 22%. We suggest this accelerated
divergence of the 5' UTRs represents the evolution of new
promoter sequences driving the transcription of the elements. Once a new promoter is formed, copies containing this
new promoter may differ in their expression, thus giving rise
to new lineages of elements.
Similar examples of the rapid evolution of the 5' UTRs of R2s
were not detected. We have previously suggested that R2 elements do not contain their own promoter but are co-transcribed with the 28S gene [32,33]. This co-transcription may
make it more difficult for independent R2 lineages to evolve.
A single lineage of R2 elements has been found in the Drosophila genus [25], while four distinct lineages of Drosophila
R1 elements exist [28]. It is also possible that the more frequent loss of R2 from a Drosophila species (3 out of 12 species) compared to R1 (no losses among the 12 species) could
also be the result of R2's reliance upon co-transcription with
the rDNA units in which they reside.

Second-strand DNA synthesis
Many of the initial steps involved in the cleavage of the target
site bottom strand and its use to prime reverse transcription
have been characterized using purified R2 protein in vitro
[10,38,49]. The recent discoveries that sequences near the 5'
end of the RNA transcript regulate top-strand cleavage [11],
and that the R2 polymerase can efficiently displace an RNA
strand while using a DNA strand as template [50], suggest
that the R2 protein also synthesizes the second DNA strand.
However, many questions remain concerning whether and
how top-strand cleavage of the target DNA is used to prime
second-strand synthesis.
Because of an unusual template jumping ability of the R2
polymerase [39], we previously suggested that during reverse
transcription the R2 polymerase jumps from the R2 transcript onto the upstream DNA target sequences [5,36,37]. The
hundreds of R2 5' junctions analyzed here suggest a different
model. In Drosophila we propose that the 5' ends of the R2
RNA transcripts contain terminal G residues that, after
reverse transcription and top-strand cleavage, enable the terminal C residues to anneal to the G residues of the top DNA
strand after cleavage (Figure 5c). This model would explain
the most common full-length R2 insertions in all Drosophila
species. Similarly, microhomologies between internal R2
sequences and the upstream 28S gene sequences can explain
the priming of second-strand DNA synthesis in many 5' truncated R2 insertions. When annealing of microhomologies
does not occur, non-templated residues can be observed that
were either added during first-strand synthesis when the R2

polymerase runs off an RNA template [39] or during secondstrand synthesis before the R2 polymerase engages the cDNA
[38].
The only aspect of this integration model that does not agree
with previous biochemical studies is the location of the topstrand cleavage site. The experiments using the B. mori R2
protein suggested this cleavage was two nucleotides upstream
of the bottom-strand site [10] while our analysis of Drosophila R2 junctions suggest it is opposite the bottom-strand
site (Figure 5c). We suggest this represents an evolved difference between the R2 elements in these divergent insects. We
have analyzed the 5' junctions of over 40 B. mori R2 insertions and found their structure is consistent with the location
of top-strand cleavage determined with the purified protein
[37]. We suggest that cleavage of the top strand by the R2
endonuclease is not rigidly determined, and thus its location
can vary.
Much less was previously known about the R1 retrotransposition mechanism. In vitro studies of the R1 endonuclease,
again from B. mori, revealed a bottom-strand cleavage site in
a position consistent with its use to prime reverse transcription [12,13]. All Drosophila R1 3' junctions, as well as 3' junctions in other insect species [19], are consistent with this
cleavage site. As in the case of R2, the R1 5' junctions suggest
cleavage of the top strand is less precise and subject to evolutionary changes. For many Drosophila R1 insertions topstrand cleavage was proposed to be at a site 14 bp downstream of the bottom strand, again consistent with the biochemical studies. Use of this site to prime second-strand
synthesis results in a 14 bp TSD. Minor changes in this cleavage location were found in D. ananassae, where the R1B
insertions have 11 or 13 bp TSDs, and in D. willistoni, where
some ancestral type R1A insertions have an 8 bp TSD.
Annealing of cDNA sequences to the upstream target site presumably does not occur as significant nucleotide variation is
observed at the junctions.
A radical change in top-strand cleavage site preference is proposed for the R1A elements of the melanogaster species
group. In these species, many R1 insertions result in a 9 bp
target site deletion, suggesting cleavage frequently occurs 9
bp upstream of the bottom-strand site (Figure 10). Associated
with this remarkable change in cleavage site preference also
appears to be a change in the nature of the R1 RNA transcript
used for retrotransposition. Based on the structure of the ISR
full-length insertions and of non-28S insertions, these melanogaster-type R1 transcripts contain from 6 to 27 nucleotides
of 28S sequence ending 9 bp upstream of the integration site.
These upstream 28S sequences on full length R1 transcripts
appear to anneal to the target site, giving rise to highly precise
5' junctions. Interestingly, these melanogaster-type R1s
retain the ability to cleave downstream of the integration site,
resulting in the ISRs seen in some full-length insertions and
the TSDs observed for all 5' truncated insertions. Because

Volume 10, Issue 5, Article R49

Stage and Eickbush R49.14

annealing of the upstream 28S sequences is not possible with
these downstream cleavage sites, significant variation is
observed at these junctions. We searched for evidence of
these additional 28S sequence tags among available
expressed sequence tag sequences from D. melanogaster.
However, all R1 sequences contained extensive upstream 28S
sequences or were transcripts of R1 tandem arrays (data not
shown).
Thus, the integration mechanisms used by the R1 and R2 elements are quite similar. Cleavage of the bottom strand and its
use to prime first-strand DNA synthesis is rigidly determined,
and no variation was observed between species. Cleavage of
the top strand and its use to prime second-strand synthesis is
flexible, which results in different junctions both within and
between species. R1 and R2 are highly successful in the 28S
niche. Whether change in the location of top-strand cleavage
occurs simply because it is neutral or because it increases
insertion efficiency is unclear. Nevertheless, the ability of R1
and R2 to explore the top-strand cleavage site suggests that
variations of the retrotransposition mechanism can evolve
among arthropods that could affect both the elements and the
rDNA loci in which they reside.

Materials and methods
Species and databases
Original sequencing reads from the whole genome shotgun
sequencing projects were accessed by Blast search (version
2.2.17) in the trace archives at NCBI [51]. The 12 Drosophila
species and their sequencing fold coverage were: D. ananassae (9-fold), D. erecta (10-fold), D. grimshawi (8-fold), D.
melanogaster (12-fold), D. mojavensis (8-fold), D. persimilis
(4-fold), D. pseudoobscura (9-fold), D. sechellia (5-fold), D.
simulans (4-fold; white 501 strain only), D. virilis (8-fold), D.
willistoni (8.4-fold) and D. yakuba (9-fold).

Assembling R1 and R2 elements
Downstream 28S sequences flanking the known R1 and R2
insertion sites were used as Blast queries using default
parameters except for requesting the maximum of 20,000
target sequences. The reads were collected, trimmed
upstream of the query and aligned in ClustalX [52]. Those
sequences upstream of the query that were not 28S rRNA
sequences were considered putative R1 or R2 elements and
were used as Blast queries in the nucleotide collection database (nr/nt) and VecScreen at NCBI [51]. Some putative elements were identified as cloning vector sequence and
disregarded. For the remaining majority of sequences, 5'
extensions of the sequences were assembled by Blast search,
followed by alignment and extraction of a consensus. Iterations were done until the 5' junction of the element with the
28S was reached. Full assemblies were not possible in a few
instances because of low element copy number and low coverage of some genome sequences.

Phylogenetics
Alignments of concatenated 18S and 28S sequences (from
Stage and Eickbush [18] and available at the Eickbush lab
website [53]) were done in ClustalX [52] with minor manipulations done in Jalview [54]. Default parameters of phyML
version 3.0 [55] as implemented through the LIRMM website
[56,57] were used to construct maximum likelihood trees and
visualized using TreeDyn 198 [58]. Branch support values
were the minimum score based on Shimodaira-Hasegawalike and Chi2-based approximate likelihood-ratio tests [59].

Nucleotide variation in the 5' and 3' ends of elements
and sequence divergence between species
Blast queries were 75 bp long near the 5' or 3' end of each consensus R1 or R2 sequence; default Blast parameters were used
except for requesting the maximum of 20,000 target
sequences and using a match/mismatch score of 1,-1. The
Blast results were trimmed to include 400 bp of the element
and 100 bp of flanking sequence. Retention of the flanking
sequence enabled those elements present in the 28S gene to
be separated from those copies inserted elsewhere in the
genome. ClustalX alignment [52] of results from each Blast
search was conducted and groups of like sequences were
extracted and consensus sequences derived. Quality scores
for reads containing differences from the main consensus
were examined to verify that the variation observed was not
sequencing error (scores less than 40 were considered
sequencing error). The Sequence Manipulation Suite: Ident
and Sim [60] aided determination of the percent identity of
the variants relative to the consensus.
In theory it should be possible to make copy number estimates based on the genome sequence coverage and the
number of trace reads recovered. In practice, however, random variation in fold coverage for any given sequence means
only an estimate of copy number for repetitive sequences can
be inferred. In addition, rDNA loci in many species of Drosophila are located on the X and Y chromosomes, resulting in
different sequencing coverage. Finally, by requiring analyzed
reads to cover 400 bp to enable a significant and uniform
level of information to be recovered from each read, fewer
reads were obtained for each analysis. Thus, estimates of element abundance were made relative to the number of rDNA
units also recovered in the trace archives (that is, fraction of
rDNA units inserted). Copies with small numbers of reads
(approximately 2 to 12) and identical sequence variation were
interpreted as single elements.

Insertions outside the 28S genes
Using the 5' and 3' ends of R1 and R2 elements as Blast queries and analyzing the flanking sequences, we found many
examples of R1 elements inserted outside the usual 28S site.
Identification of the non-28S sequences was attempted by
comparing them to our assembled rDNA-related sequences
and by Blast search of the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide
database [51]. While a few target sites could be identified, the

Stage and Eickbush R49.15

majority of sequences had not been characterized and represented repeated sequences, and thus were presumed to be
heterochromatic. We then attempted to find uninserted copies of the sequences using the flanking sequences as Blast
queries. In those cases where the target site was repeated, we
could identify examples of uninserted target sites, and in
some instances the opposite junction of the R1 insertion.

dN/dS analysis
Selection analysis was done using the HyPhy package available at Datamonkey [61]. We conducted all the available tests
and report here the dN/dS results of the PARRIS test [62],
which were similar in all the tests.
