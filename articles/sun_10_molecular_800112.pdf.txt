Abstract
Background: Gene duplication provides raw genetic materials for evolutionary novelty and adaptation. The
evolutionary fate of duplicated transcription factor genes is less studied although transcription factor gene plays
important roles in many biological processes. TFIIAγ is a small subunit of TFIIA that is one of general transcription
factors required by RNA polymerase II. Previous studies identified two TFIIAγ-like genes in rice genome and found that
these genes either conferred resistance to rice bacterial blight or could be induced by pathogen invasion, raising the
question as to their functional divergence and evolutionary fates after gene duplication.
Results: We reconstructed the evolutionary history of the TFIIAγ genes from main lineages of angiosperms and
demonstrated that two TFIIAγ genes (TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5) arose from a whole genome duplication that happened in the
common ancestor of grasses. Likelihood-based analyses with branch, codon, and branch-site models showed no
evidence of positive selection but a signature of relaxed selective constraint after the TFIIAγ duplication. In particular,
we found that the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) of the TFIIAγ1 sequences was two times higher
than that of TFIIAγ5 sequences, indicating highly asymmetric rates of protein evolution in rice tribe and its relatives,
with an accelerated rate of TFIIAγ1 gene. Our expression data and EST database search further indicated that after
whole genome duplication, the expression of TFIIAγ1 gene was significantly reduced while TFIIAγ5 remained
constitutively expressed and maintained the ancestral role as a subunit of the TFIIA complex.
Conclusion: The evolutionary fate of TFIIAγ duplicates is not consistent with the neofunctionalization model that
predicts that one of the duplicated genes acquires a new function because of positive Darwinian selection. Instead, we
suggest that subfunctionalization might be involved in TFIIAγ evolution in grasses. The fact that both TFIIAγ1 and
TFIIAγ5 genes were effectively involved in response to biotic or abiotic factors might be explained by either DykhuizenHartl effect or buffering hypothesis.
Background
Transcription factors are large families in the genome of
most eukaryotic organism and often act as switches
between discrete developmental programs [1] and play
important roles in many biological processes in plants,
such as developmental regulation, control of metabolic
pathways, response to environment stimuli and harmful
stress [2,3]. Unlike regulatory transcription factors, general transcription factors are conserved proteins that are
used by organisms as diverse as human, rat, Drosophila,
and yeast to initiate mRNA synthesis [4]. TFIIA is one of
general eukaryotic transcription factors required by RNA

polymerase II and has been demonstrated to stimulate
transcription by stabilizing TBP binding to the TATA box
and by regulating TBP or TFIID dimerization to accelerate DNA binding [4,5]. All three polypeptides in TFIIA
including the small subunits (TFIIAγ) showed high
sequence and structural conservation across different
organisms, highlighting their significance in eukaryotic
transcription [6,7]. Recent studies showed that there were
two TFIIAγ-like genes in rice genome, in contrast to Arabidopsis where only one copy was found [8]. Sequence
comparison indicated that two rice TFIIAγ-like genes had
85.5% identity at the amino acid level and shared high
degrees of nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity
with the Arabidopsis TFIIAγ-like gene [7,8]. Interestingly,
a mutant (V39E substitution) in the copy on rice chromosome 5 (xa5) was confirmed to confer resistance to rice

bacterial blight [7,8] and the other copy on chromosome
1 (TFIIAγ1) was found to be highly expressed when
induced by pathogen invasion [9].
Gene duplication is widely recognized as a major evolutionary force shaping genome evolution, and provides
raw genetic materials for evolutionary novelty and adaptation [10,11]. Duplication of transcription factor genes
has been recently investigated, but almost all studies
focused on regulatory transcription factors (e.g., [12-16])
and little is known about the evolution of basic transcription factor duplicates. The duplication and divergence of
TFIIAγ gene in rice and their resistance reactions to rice
bacterial blight raise a few of interesting questions. First,
whether the new function of disease resistance is facilitated by the redundancy of TFIIAγ gene, as suggested by
previous study [7]? Evidence showed that gene duplication might contribute to the ability of plants to obtain a
defense response against disease and herbivory through
the functional diversification of genes but empirical study
is still scarce in plants [17,18]. Second, when the TFIIAγ
duplication happened in history and what model fits the
fate of the duplicated genes. The classic models of gene
duplication predict that one of the duplicated genes is
either lost by accumulation of deleterious mutations
(pseudogenization or nonfunctionalization) [19,20] or
acquires a new function because of positive Darwinian
selection (neofunctionalization) [11,21]. Additional possible fates of the duplicated genes were also proposed,
including maintenance of the ancestral function by both
copies (redundancy) and subdivision of the ancestral
function between copies (subfunctionalization and subneofunctionalization) [21-25]. Jiang et al. (2006) suggested that duplication of the TFIIAγ gene in rice gave
rise to a new function for disease resistance during evolution. This hypothesis, however, remains to be justified by
empirical molecular data. Molecular evolutionary analyses have been successfully used to test the alternative
explanations for the retention and evolution of the duplicated genes (e.g., [14,16,26-29]). To reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of TFIIAγ genes will help better
elucidate the duplication history of two TFIIAγ and further reveal their evolutionary fates after the duplication.
Finally, we ask what role of selection plays on the evolution of duplicated TFIIAγ genes? Is there any change in
the strength and mode of selection that have acted on the
duplicate genes? What is the relative importance of relaxation of purifying selection and positive selection in the
evolution of TFIIAγ genes? Previous studies often treated
relaxation of purifying selection as the null hypothesis
but positive selection after gene duplication has been well
demonstrated (e.g., [28,30,31]). A few of current statistical methods provide effective ways to evaluate the role of
positive selection following gene duplication and allow
more specific cases can be addressed [28,32,33].

In the present study, we investigate the molecular evolution of the general transcription factorTFIIAγ in
grasses, including a dense sampling of species of the rice
tribe (Oryzeae). Based on the TFIIAγ gene phylogeny, we
found that the duplication event giving rise to TFIIAγ1
and TFIIAγ5 happened in the common ancestor of extant
grasses. Our molecular evolutionary analyses and likelihood ratio tests revealed the relaxation of selective constraint on TFIIAγ genes following gene duplication and
an acceleration of TFIIAγ1 gene evolution. In conjunction with expression data, we demonstrated that both
TFIIAγ genes following the duplication were functional
and under strong selection constraint in Oryzeae and its
relatives, providing no evidence that either gene evolved
new functions or became a pseudogene despite their
long-term coexistence for at least 50 MYA. Instead, the
evolutionary fates of two TFIIAγ genes could be
explained either by the Dykhuizen-Hartl effect [34] which
predicts that one of duplicate genes evolves under relaxed
purifying selection and later convey a selective advantage
under particular environments, or by the buffering
hypothesis which suggests that selection for a buffering
effect is a mechanism for duplicate gene preservation
after whole genome duplication.

Methods
Species samples

The rice tribe (Oryzeae) includes approximately 12 genera and more than 70 species distributed across the tropical and temperate regions of the world [35,36]. In this
study, we sampled 13 diploid species that represent the
main lineages of Oryzeae, including six Oryza species,
two Leersia species, and one each of other five genera in
the tribe (Figure 1; Additional file 1). One species in the
tribe Ehrhartoideae that is sister to Oryzeae, Ehrharta
erecta, was used as an outgroup [35,37]. To infer the
duplication event of the two TFIIAγ genes, we selected
additional 12 monocots and 24 dicots to generate the
phylogenetic tree of the TFIIAγ genes. In total, 30
sequences were isolated here and the remaining
sequences were extracted from GenBank by BLAST
searches [38]. Detailed information of the species and the
sequences and their GenBank accession numbers is listed
in additional file 1.
Isolation and sequencing of TFIIAγ genes

On the basis of the TFIIAγ-like sequences from rice,
wheat and maize [Additional file 1], we designed two
pairs of universal PCR primers to amplify the TFIIAγ
genes. They are the forward primers P1 (5'-TTCgAgCTSTACMggMggTC-3') or P3 (5'-ATggCCACCTTCgAgCTSTA-3') and reverse primers P2 (5'AggCCACRATCTTCACCTTg-3') or P4 (5'-TCRCAggCCACRATCTTCAC-3'). The regions amplified and the

locations of the PCR and internal primers (P7 and P8) are
shown in additional file 2. Genomic DNA was extracted
from fresh young leaves or silica-gel dried leaves using
the CTAB methods as described in [25]. PCR amplification was performed in a volume of 25 μl reaction using
exTaq polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The cycling
procedure was 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s,
annealing at 56°C for 45 s and extension at 68°C for 8 min
with 2 min of pre-denaturation and 10 min of final extension. PCR product was run on 1.2% agarose gel and all
bands were excised under UV light, purified using
Dinggou gel purification kit (Dingguo, Beijing, China),
and sequenced using ET Terminator Kit (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech). All the PCR products were cloned
into pGEM T-easy vectors (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
and at least 6 independent clones were sequenced. The
purified fragments were also sequenced directly to make
confirmation. If more than one copy was isolated in one
species, we first construct a phylogeny including all the
copies. If multiple copies from the same species clustered
together, one copy was randomly selected in further analysis.
Characterization of expression by RT-PCR and EST database
search

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) was performed to investigate whether there is difference of expression between two TFIIAγ genes. Total
RNA was extracted from fresh leaves of eight species and
young panicles of three species of Oryzeae [Additional
file 1] using Plant RNA Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
California, USA). The first strand cDNA was reversetranscribed with oligo dT20 primer. Subsequent detection
was performed by PCR using up-stream primer P3 and
low-stream specific primers P7 (5'-AYARWAACCTTgCTCTTgACTTgg-3') and P8 (5'-gACNNTAACCTTgCTCTTCACCTSA-3') (P7 for TFIIAγ5 copy and P8 for
TFIIAγ1 copy). The actin gene was taken as control using
primers ACT-59F (5'-AggCTggTTTCgCTggggATgATg3') and ACTIN-764R (5'-ggACCTCggggCACCTgAACCTCT-3') [14]. The PCR procedure was 2 min of predenaturation at 94°C, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 30 sec, annealing at 54°C for 30 s, and extension at
72°C for 1 min, with a final extension of 10 min at 72°C.
RT-PCR products were confirmed by sequencing.
In EST database search, all the hits of Poaceae species
with e-value lower than 1e-10 were collected. The
sequences retrieved were aligned with rice TFIIAγ1 and
TFIIAγ5 genes. By a neighbor-join phylogeny construction, all the sequences can be divided into two classes,
corresponding to the TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 clades,
respectively. We used the number of hits as an indicator
of the expression level of the two copies, because a highly

Page 4 of 14

expressed gene would have greater chance to be picked
from cDNA library than a lowly expressed gene [39,40].
Sequence analysis

Sequences were aligned using a combination of methods
implemented in BioEdit [41] and ClustalX 1.81 [42], with
further manual refinements. The unalignable intron
regions were excluded from the analyses. The GC content
of all three codon positions and pairwise synonymous
and nonsynonymous distances were calculated by
MEGA3.1 [43]. Codon usage bias of the sequences was
estimated by ENC (effective number of codons) that varies between 20 and 61, with the lower the value, the more
biased codon usage [44]. We used Tajima's relative rate
test [45], as implemented in MEGA3.1, to test for rate
variation between two TFIIAγ genes using Ananas comosus as outgroup. To visualize conservation and check the
rate variation along the TFIIAγ sequences, a sliding window analysis was performed by the K-estimator program
[46]. Given relatively small length of TFIIAγ genes, we
used a window size of 10 amino acid (30 bp) and a step
size of 3 amino acid (9 bp) in the sliding window analysis.
Poaceae species were used in the sliding analysis. To
avoid sampling bias, only Oryza punctata was used to
represent the Oryzeae species.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analyses were performed using maximum
likelihood (ML) method, implemented in PAUP 4.0b10
[47], and Bayesian inference (BI) with MrBayes v.3.12
[48]. For ML, heuristic searches were run with random
taxon addition, tree bisection reconnection swap for 100
replications. The reliability of branches was evaluated by
500 bootstrap replications. In each bootstrap heuristic
search replication, the same parameter settings were
used, except that number of heuristic search replications
was set to 10. In ML and analyses the best nucleotidfe
substitution models for each data set were selected using
Modeltest 3.7 by corrected Akaike information criterion
[49]. In BI with GTR+I+G model, Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) analysis was run for 1,000,000 generations, sampled every 100th generations. The first 250,000
generations were set as burn-in.
We generated a phylogenetic tree of all TFIIAγ or TFIIAγ-like sequences to explore the duplication history of
the two duplicates. For this purpose, we used only coding
sequences to construct the gene tree because the intron
sequences between TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 were unalignable. The phylogenetic tree was rooted by the TFIIAγ-like
genes of Liriodendron tulipifera and Persea americana
that belong to two families (Magnoliaceae and Lauraceae)
of the basal angiosperms [50].

Tests for selection

The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution
sites (dN/dS or ω) is an effective measure to detect selection on a gene or gene region [33]. If the ratio is significantly less than 1 (ω < 1), purifying selection is inferred,
while positive selection is evoked if the ratio is significantly greater than 1 (ω > 1). An estimate of the ratio
close to 1 (ω = 1) indicates the presence of neutral evolution. To explore the selective processes acting on TFIIAγ
genes, we performed likelihood-based analyses using the
codeml program of PAML version 4 [51]. We first tested
whether the average ω ratio differed among lineages of
the gene tree by using the branch models that allow ω to
vary among lineages and assume different ω ratios
assigned to the branches before and after the duplication
event. The one ratio model (M0) assumes a single ω for
all branches and all sites, whereas the other models allow
for different ω ratios among branches of the tree. The free
ratio model (Mf ) assumes an independent ω ratio for
each branch of the tree. The two ratio model M2r
assumes one ω ratio to all branches predating the duplication event (ω0), and the other ratio to all branches postdating the duplication event (ωd1 = ωd5 = ω1 = ω5). The
three ratio model (M3r) assumes one ratio restricted to
all branches predating the gene duplication (ω0) and the
other two to the branches of TFIIAγ1 (ωd1 = ω1) and TFIIAγ5 (ωd5 = ω5), respectively, following the duplication
event. A more complex model, the four ratio model
(M4r), assumes four independent ω ratios: one ratio
restricted to all branches predating the gene duplication
(ω0), one ratio to the branches immediately following the
duplication (ωd1 = ωd5), and the last two assigned to the
branches leading to TFIIAγ1 (ω1) and TFIIAγ5 (ω5) of
grass species, respectively. Finally, the five ratio model
(M5r) extends M4r to allow ω ratios to differ between the
TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 branches immediately postdating
the duplication (ωd1 ≠ ωd5) (Figure 1; Table 1). A likelihood ratio test (LRT) was conducted to determine
whether there is statistically significant difference
between two models. If the LRT is significant, the null
hypothesis that two models are not significantly different
is rejected, and the model with higher likelihood value is
assumed to be a better model [28,52].
We next used site-specific models to examine whether
particular amino acid residues were subject to positive
selection because the ω ratio is seldom detected greater
than 1 if all the sites are averaged [53]. The nested codon
models [28,54] were performed. In addition to one ratio
model (M0), nearly neutral model (M1) classifies all the
sites into 2 categories, one category under strict constraint (0 < ω < 1) and the other under neutral (ω = 1).
Positive selection model (M2) is based on M1 and
assumes a third category under positive selection (1 < ω).

Page 5 of 14

The discrete model (M3) classifies all the sites into several categories, each with a different ω ratio. Beta model
(M7) assumes a beta distribution of the ω ratios, and
beta&ω model (M8) extends an independent ratio estimated by the data. Models assuming positive selection
M8 and M2 are compared with null models M7 and M1,
respectively. Positive selection is invoked if the LRT is significant and there is site with ω > 1 [28]. A comparison
between M3 and M0 can tell whether the ω ratio is homogeneous across different part of the gene.
We further performed the branch-site models A and B
[55] to test for sites potentially under positive selection
on TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 branches, respectively. Model A
assumes 0 < ω0 < 1 and ω1 = 1 and was compared with
nearly neutral model (M1); while model B determines ω0
and ω1 as free parameters to be estimated and compared
with discrete model (M3) [55].

Results
Cloning and characterization of two TFIIAγ genes

Using genomic DNA we cloned and sequenced two TFIIAγ genes from all sampled Oryzeae species except for
Leersia tisserantti for which only TFIIAγ1 was isolated,
mainly because the second intron of TFIIAγ5 in this species was too long to be amplified successfully by exTaq
DNA polymerase. However, when using cDNA template,
we obtained the coding region of TFIIAγ5 and the first
intron sequence using an internal primer for this species.
Two TFIIAγ copies were also isolated and sequenced
from other Poaceae species, including Ehrharta erecta,
Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor. Only single TFIIAγ-like
gene was isolated from both Cyperus rotundus and Zingiber officinale despite different attempts have been tried,
including optimization of PCR amplification, recombination of up and down stream primers. All the TFIIAγ
genes obtained in this study have three exons and two
introns, with about 261 bp in coding sequence. The
downloaded TFIIAγ-like sequences are cDNAs with full
coding region. The TFIIAγ1-like sequences of rice, maize
and sorghum were 327 bp in length and 9 bp (three
codons) longer than the sequences of grass TFIIAγ5-like
gene and those from the remaining species outside
Poaceae. In Oryzeae, sequence length ranged from 1.3 to
1.8 kb for TFIIAγ1 and from 2.5 to 5.5 kb for TFIIAγ5.
The first intron is about 70 ~100 bp in length for both
genes, whereas the length of the second intron varied
greatly [Additional file 2]. In coding regions, there is no
indels between the two copies and can be aligned perfectly. We did not find the V39E substitution that lead to
TFIIAγ5 (xa5) to confer resistance to rice bacterial blight
in all Oryzeae species, indicating that such a mutation
arises within O. sativa. The GC contents for the total and
three individual codon positions were similar for the

same gene but those at the 3rd position (GC3) is higher in
TFIIAγ1 than in TFIIAγ5 (75.9% vs. 70.1%, P < 0.001)
[Additional file 3]. Estimates of the codon usage showed
that TFIIAγ5 had significantly lower ENC value than TFIIAγ1 (42.9 vs. 48.5, P < 0.001), paralleling its higher
expression level in grasses (see below).
Phylogeny of TFIIAγ genes

The alignment of all the coding sequences was 318 bp in
length including gaps. Of them, 152 sites were parsimony
informative. A Bayesian phylogeny indicated that all
monocot species except for Zostera marina of Zosteraceae formed a monophyletic group, which forms polytomy with the other angiosperm clades. Such unsolved
relationship reflects our current understanding of angiosperm phylogeny on which monocots were not resolved
fully with many other basal angiosperms [50]. It is noted
that all the TFIIAγ sequences from the Poaceae species
formed two clades supported by Bayesian posterior probability > 90, one consisting of TFIIAγ1 homologs and the
other TFIIAγ5 homologs (Figure 1). All the Oryzeae species and most grass species outside Oryzeae have two distinct types of TFIIAγ sequences that fell into the two
clades. In some grass species, only one TFIIAγ-like
sequence was isolated, which formed a cluster with either
TFIIAγ1-like or TFIIAγ5-like clade. In contrast, a single
TFIIAγ-like copy was found in two species from the families closely related to Poaceae, Cyperus rotundus of

Cyperaceae and Zingiber officinale of Zingiberaceae.
Moreover, the monocot clade is sister to the TFIIAγ-like
sequences from the remaining angiosperm species (Figure 1). ML analyses produced similar tree topologies
[Additional file 4]. These observations indicated that the
duplication event giving rise to TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5
occurred at the ancestors of Poaceae or before the divergence of Poaceae.
Sequence conservation and rate difference between two
TFIIAγ genes

We performed a sliding window analysis by calculating
the nucleotide divergence of the entire sequence with JC
model (K), of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous substitution sites (dS). The dN values for both genes were
lower than those of dS (dN/dS≤ 0) in almost all sliding windows but all three parameters fluctuated across the genes
(Figure 2). The conserved regions in TFIIAy1 are different
from those in TFIIAy5 and some sites in TFIIAγ1 might
experience relaxation of selective constraints with elevated dN/dS values relative to those of TFIIAγ5 (Figure 2A
and 2B). In addition, both the K and dN values of TFIIAγ1
were higher than those of TFIIAγ5, suggesting higher rate
of evolution in TFIIAγ1 genes. To detect the potential
impact of intergenic conversion on molecular evolution
[56], we further calculated the parameters between two
paralogs (Figure 2C). We did not find significant difference in evolutionary rates between two domains in which

Relative rate test was used to compare the TFIIAγ1 and
TFIIAγ5 sequences from the main lineages in grasses in
relations to the TFIIAγ-like sequence from Ananas comosus of the family Bromeliaceae that is closely related to
Poaceae [50]. For all paralogs from 12 species tested, TFIIAγ1 evolved 1.14 to 1.34 times faster than TFIIAγ5
(Table 2). The tests were statistically significant or marginal significant for six out of 12 species. When more distinctly related species Zingiber officinale was used as an
outgroup, the results were similar in that TFIIAγ1
evolved faster than TFIIAγ5 in all 12 species though the
tests were not significant (Table 2). We calculated the
synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of
TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 between the Oryzeae species and
found that the average dN value of TFIIAγ1 was significantly higher than that of TFIIAγ5 (0.033 vs. 0.011, P <
0.001); the pairwise dS values of TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5
were also significant (0.155 vs. 0.131, P = 0.001). The
accelerated dN in TFIIAγ1 is obvious when we examined
the amino acid alignments for the two genes, in which 21
sites had amino acid mutations in TFIIAγ1 in contrast to
14 sites in TFIIAγ5 [Additional file 5]. The overall ω (dN/
dS) values for both genes were far below 1 (0.213 for TFIIAγ1 and 0.084 for TFIIAγ5), indicating both genes were
subjected to selection constraint, but the constraint on
TFIIAγ5 was stronger.

heterogeneity occurred across the sequences. It is evidence that low sequence differentiation was found
around the functional regions (e.g., the region that interact with TBP), inconsistent with variation pattern of gene
conversion that sequence divergence would occurred
around the functional site [56].

We used different kinds of likelihood ratio tests to examine whether there was variation of ω ratios on different
lineages and, in particular, whether there is any increase
in the ω ratio after the TFIIAγ duplication. Free ratio
(Mf ) and two ratio (M2r) models both have significantly
higher likelihood scores than one ratio model (M0),
rejecting the null hypothesis that the TFIIAγ-like genes
have evolved at constant rates along branches (Table 1).
However, branch-specific ω values under Mf model were
all lower than one (ranging from 0 ~0.513), suggesting
that purifying selection or constraint on amino acid
sequence best explains the evolution of TFIIAγ-like genes
in angiosperms. Two ratio model, with ω0 = 0.046 for all
branches before the TFIIAγ duplication and ωd1 = ωd5 =
ω1 = ω5 = 0.077 for the branches after the duplication, fits
the data significantly better than one ratio models (M2r
vs. M0, 2ΔL = 10.38, P < 0.001), indicative of a significant
increase in ω value following the duplication event. We
further calculated the likelihood under comparison
between models M3r and M2r to explore the assumption
of the same selective constraints at two TFIIAγ genes
after the duplication event. Likelihood of model M3r was
significantly better than M2r (2ΔL = 12.84, P < 0.0001),
suggesting that different selective pressures occur in the
two TFIIAγ genes with stronger purifying selection in

M4r indicated that the ω ratios of the two branches
immediately following the duplication event were not significantly different from each other (2ΔL = 2.12, P =
0.145) (Table 1), implying that the asymmetric rates of
TFIIAγ evolution occurred mainly after diversification of
grasses.
Detecting positive selection in TFIIAγ genes

Given the fact that the selective constraints on TFIIAγ
genes relaxed after duplication and conferred disease
resistant or induced by pathogen in cultivated rice, it is
interesting to ask whether any accelerated rate of relaxation happen and any amino acid residue is potentially
under positive selection. Because the branch model test
averages the ω ratios across all sites and is a very conservative test of positive selection [33], we applied site-specific and branch-site models to TFIIAγ dataset. As shown
in Table 3, site-specific modelsindicate that TFIIAγ genes
were under strong purifying selection with ω = 0.055 in
one-ratio model (M0). The discrete model (M3) was sig-

nificantly better than M0 (2ΔL = 193.62, P < 0.001), indicating that the ω ratio was not homogeneous among sites
along the sequence. This is also obvious in the sliding
window analysis (Figure 2) and the amino acid alignment
of TFIIAγ genes [Additional file 5]. Models M2 and M8
assuming positive selection were not significantly better
than the null models M1 and M7 (for M1 vs. M2, 2ΔL =
0.0, P = 1.0; for M7 vs. M8, 2ΔL = 0.0, P = 1.0), and no site
was found to be under positive selection by Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) inference [32] using a probability criterion of 95%. Thus, the nearly neutral model was better to
explain the data. In model M1, about 94% of the codons
are under strict constraint (ω = 0.030), and the other 6%
codons are under neutral evolution (ω = 1.0) (Table 3).
We further tested for evidence of positive selection on
two TFIIAγ genes separately using branch-site models
(Table 3). Branch-site models A and B specifying branch
TFIIAγ1 as the foreground branch were not significantly
better than the null models M1 (2ΔL = 0.1, P = 0.95) and
M3 (2ΔL = -44.92, P = 1.0). In analyses of the branch TFIIAγ5, however, model A was significantly better than the
null model (2ΔL = 13.66, P < 0.001) with ω ratio greater

than 1, but model B was not significantly better than the
null model (Table 3). We checked the inferred positive
selection site (90T) across all protein sequences and
found that it was fixed in both copies, with all TFIIAγ1
genes being T and TFIIAγ5 genes Q [Additional file 5].
This observation suggests it unlikely that positive selection occurs in either copy in grasses. Alternatively, this
site might experience positive selection immediately after
duplication of TFIIAγ gene in ancestor of grasses and
then fixed under strong purifying selection in grasses. It
should be noted that the TFIIAγ5 gene was highly
expressed with significantly lower ENC relative to TFIIAγ1 gene [Additional file 3]. Therefore, the ω value
greater than one at 90 site of TFIIAγ5 gene might be
caused by low dS value rather than positive selection

because synonymous sites are likely to be under negative
selection in highly expressed genes due to codon usage
bias [57].
Gene expression of the TFIIAγ genes

Two rounds of RT-PCR were performed to determine the
expression of TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 genes in tribe
Oryzeae species. In the first round, equal amount of template cDNA was added in the reaction of TFIIAγ1 and
TFIIAγ5. The expression of TFIIAγ5 was detected in all
the leaves and young panicles, while the expression of
TFIIAγ1 was weaker than that of TFIIAγ5 for most
expected bands, and were almost invisible in O. officinalis, O. australiensis and Leersia tisserantti (Figure 3). The
weaker bands of TFIIAγ1 indicated that it was expressed

Sun and Ge BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:128
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/128

at lower level relative to TFIIAγ5. When a second round
PCR was taken, the expected bands appeared in all the
species. To avoid contamination, all RT-PCR products of
TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 were confirmed by sequencing,
and the resulting sequences were identical to the coding
regions of genomic sequences in each species. These
results showed that both copies were expressed in leaf
and young panicle of Oryzeae species, but the TFIIAγ5
was expressed at higher level.
Different expression levels of two TFIIAγ genes were
further confirmed by the GenBank EST database search
using rice TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 sequences. Both copies
were found in rice, maize and sorghum, but the hits of
TFIIAγ5 far outnumbered those of the TFIIAγ1 copy in
rice and maize [Additional file 6]. In several other
Poaceae species, only the TFIIAγ5 copy was found. The
low number of hits indicated that the TFIIAγ1 expression
was much lower than that of TFIIAγ5, consistent with
our RT-PCR findings. In addition, the matches of TFIIAγ5 expression were found in all types of cDNA libraries, including the callus, mature or immature tissue,
stressed or unstressed and different developing stage
libraries; whereas the TFIIAγ1 hits appeared mainly in
drought-stressed tissue, pollen, immature and meristematic and mixed libraries [Additional file 6]. These
observations suggest that TFIIAγ5 might be constitutively expressed and TFIIAγ1 be expressed under stress
induction or expressed in specific tissues.

Discussion
This study identified two TFIIAγ genes for all Oryzeae
species and the representatives of grass species, which
formed two monophyletic clades corresponding to the
rice TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 genes; whereas only a single
copy was found for the remaining monocots and angiosperm species. Phylogenetic analyses of all the TFIIAγlike sequences indicated that the duplication of TFIIAγ

into TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 occurred before the divergence of rice and maize (Figure 1). This implies that the
duplication event that gave rise to TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5
genes might occur before the common ancestor of extant
grasses because rice (subfamily Ehrhartoideae) and maize
(subfamily Panicoideae) are two distinctly related lineages in the grass family [58,59].
It has been demonstrated that the rice genome experienced two large-scale duplications, one whole genome
duplication occurred about 70 MYA, and an additional
segmental duplication happened 5 ~ 21 MYA involving
chromosomes 11 and 12 [60-62]. Previous studies found
that the location of two rice TFIIAγ genes corresponded
to a large-scale duplication of a portion of rice chromosomes 1 and 5 [7,8]. To determine whether the timing of
the duplication event leading to TFIIAγ1/TFIIAγ5 is consistent with the whole genome duplication around 70
MYA, we calculated the synonymous distance (dS)
between TFIIAγ orthologs and paralogs for rice and
maize by the method of Nei and Gojobori (1986). The dS
distances between the TFIIAγ orthologs were 0.388 for
rice and 0.457 for maize and those between the paralogs
of rice and maize were 0.592 (TFIIAγ1) and 0.497 (TFIIAγ5), respectively. According to a molecular clock
assuming rice and maize diverged 50 MYA [58], the TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 paralogs diverged about 54 ~76 MYA.
This date coincides with the time scale that Poaceae
diverged 55 ~ 77 MYA [58,59]. Wang et al. (2005) identified 10 large duplicated blocks arising from the whole
genome duplication, including two blocks involving chromosomes 1 and 5. Our further search on rice genome
found that two rice TFIIAγ genes located on block 10
determined by Wang et al. (2005). Therefore, the TFIIAγ
duplication is within a large duplicated segment of rice
genome and most likely to arise following a whole
genome duplication event that was assumed to have
occurred before the divergence of Poaceae [60-62].
Our timing of the TFIIAγ duplication suggests that the
TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 paralogs have been maintained in
the grass genome for a considerable amount of time (at
least 50 MYA). This implicates that selection rather than
random drift is responsible for the retention of both TFIIAγ activities during grass evolution because most gene
duplicates have a short lifespan (within a few million
years after duplication) before one copy was deleted
(pseudogenization) [24]. It has been well established that
gene duplication is often followed by an elevated rate of
protein evolution and a large proportion of the duplicate
pairs displayed asymmetric evolution, i.e., one of the
duplicates evolves much faster than the other [19,29,6365]. Conant and Wagner (2003) analyzed four completely
sequenced genomes and found that 20% - 30% of duplicate gene pairs showed asymmetric evolution in the
amino acid sequence, and particularly, the greater this

Sun and Ge BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:128
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/128

asymmetry, the greater the dN/dS ratio in a gene pair, indicating that most asymmetric divergence might be caused
by relaxed selective constraints on one of the duplicates.
In well agreement with previous studies, we found significantly higher ω ratios for branches arising from the
duplication event in rice tribe and its relatives, suggesting
weaker purifying selection on the duplicate genes during
diversification of grasses after the duplication event.
Moreover, the ω ratios of the TFIIAγ1 sequences are two
times higher than those of TFIIAγ5 sequences, consistent
with the results of relative rate tests in which TFIIAγ1
evolved faster than TFIIAγ5 (Table 2). Such an asymmetric evolution of the TFIIAγ duplicates reflects an acceleration of evolutionary rate of TFIIAγ1 relative to TFIIAγ5.
Our likelihood-based analyses with both branch and
codon models showed no evidence of positive selection
but a signature of relaxed selective constraint after the
TFIIAγ duplication and subsequent acceleration of TFIIAγ1 gene. The low ω values (0.060 ~ 0.118) across the
branches leading to both TFIIAγ duplicates also suggest
that strong selection constrains remain for the two copies
after the duplication, with TFIIAγ1 evolving under
weaker selective constraint in grass species.
The fate of duplicated genes has been a hot debate since
Ohno (1970), and several hypotheses have been proposed
to interpret the preservation of both copies, including
neofunctionalization [11], subfunctionalization [21,24],
subneofunctionalization [66] and some other models (see
review in Semon and Wolfe 2007). Based on sequence
analyses and expression data, Iyer and McCouch (2004)
found that the recessive mutation on TFIIAγ5 locus for
resistance to rice bacterial blight did not affect the essential function of TFIIAγ gene and hypothesized that TFIIAγ5 functioned both as a general transcription factor
and as a resistance gene (xa5) in rice, which was further
demonstrated by subsequent complementation test and
3-D structure prediction [7]. We conducted a secondary
structure prediction of the TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 proteins of grass species and found little difference in the
secondary structures between the two copies [Additional
file 5]. These observations, in combination of our molecular evolutionary analyses (Tables 1 and 3), demonstrated
that both TFIIAγ genes were functional and under selection constraint in Oryzeae and its relatives. Thus,
pseudogenization is unlikely involved in TFIIAγ evolution. Because extra amounts of protein or RNA products
such as rRNAs and histones are in high demand [22], the
retention of both TFIIAγ copies might be attributed
partly to the importance of TFIIAγ as a component of
TFIIA that is a general transcription factor needed in all
polymerase II transcriptions [4,5].
Jiang et al (2006) investigated the expression patterns of
two TFIIAγ genes in rice and indicated that the TFIIAγ1
gene was not expressed in young panicle, in contrast to

Page 11 of 14

TFIIAγ5 that expressed in all organs tested (leaf, stem,
panicle, and root). In our study on O. sativa, O. punctata
and Z. latifolia, however, the expression of TFIIAγ1 was
detected in both leaves and young panicles but the
expression level was much lower relative to TFIIAγ5 gene
(Figure 3). These observations, in conjunction with our
expression data, indicate that after whole genome duplication, the expression of TFIIAγ1 copy was significantly
reduced while TFIIAγ5 remained constitutively
expressed and maintained the ancestral role as a subunit
of the TFIIA complex. Consequently, it seems that subfunctionalization might be involved in TFIIAγ evolution
in grasses. The case of TFIIAγ genes agree with previous
notion that subfunctionalization would lead to functional
specialization when one of the duplicate genes became
better at performing the original function of the progenitor gene [22]. Nevertheless, the possibility that positive
selection on some specific sites immediately after duplication of TFIIAγ gene in ancestor of grasses cannot be
excluded entirely given short length of the TFIIAγ gene
and the inference power of methods in our case [67].
One important point for the evolution of TFIIAγ genes
is the evidence that both TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 genes
were effectively involved in response to biotic or abiotic
factors. In addition to xa5 mutation that lead to resistance to rice bacterial blight, a recent study documented
that the expression of TFIIAγ1 could express 400-fold
greater than normal when infected by specific bacterial
races (PXO99A) that cause blight disease [9]. Our EST
database search also found the frequent presence of TFIIAγ1 gene in drought-stressed cDNA library both in rice
and sorghum, implying its inducibility by drought stress
[Additional file 6]. As pointed out by previous authors,
gene redundancy might create subtle fitness advantage
that was only evident in particular stages of the life cycle
or under particular environments [25,68,69]. Therefore,
the fate of the duplicated TFIIAγ genes can be alternatively explained by the Dykhuizen-Hartl effect [31,34],
which predicts that one of duplicate genes evolves under
relaxed purifying selection and the fixed mutations later
convey a selective advantage in a novel environment or
genetic background. It is noted that the V39E substitution
in the α-helix domain of TFIIAγ5 was confined only to
some varieties of O. sativa, suggestive of its recent emergence [7,8] [Additional file 5].
The involvement of the duplicated TFIIAγ genes in
adversity response could also be explained by the buffering hypothesis [27], which suggests that selection for a
buffering effect was a mechanism for duplicate gene preservation after whole genome duplication. By exploring
the footprints of selection associated with genome duplication in Arabidopisis ecotypes and rice subspecies,
Chapman et al. (2006) found that functional buffering
might be important against genetic turbulence after

genome duplication and could continue to act ~60 million years later. Retention of duplicate genes, particularly
for complex genes and gene network, plays a critical role
for genetic robustness of biological systems
[22,25,27,70,71]. TFIIA is a complex consisting of three
polypeptides and assumed recently to be tightly regulated
with a particular role in differentiation and development
[6]. Further biochemical and molecular investigations on
the respective functions and the interactions between
TFIIAγ and the other two components will be required to
better understanding of the biology of the transcription
factor TFIIA and to provide useful insights into the evolution of TFIIAγ and its counterparts.

Conclusions
Based on phylogenetic reconstruction of the TFIIAγ
genes from main lineages of angiosperms, we demonstrated that two TFIIAγ genes (TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5)
arose from a whole genome duplication that happened in
the common ancestor of grasses. Likelihood-based analyses with different models showed no evidence of positive
selection but a signature of relaxed selective constraint
after the TFIIAγ duplication. In particular, the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) of the TFIIAγ1
sequences was two times higher than that of TFIIAγ5
sequences, indicating highly asymmetric rates of protein
evolution in rice tribe and its relatives. Our expression
data and EST database search further indicated that after
whole genome duplication, the expression of TFIIAγ1
gene was significantly reduced while TFIIAγ5 remained
constitutively expressed and maintained the ancestral
role as a subunit of the TFIIA complex. These observations are not consistent with the neofunctionalization
model that predicts that one of the duplicated genes
acquires a new function and instead, implicate that subfunctionalization might be involved in TFIIAγ evolution
in grasses. The fact that both TFIIAγ1 and TFIIAγ5 genes
were effectively involved in response to biotic or abiotic
factors might be explained by either Dykhuizen-Hartl
effect or buffering hypothesis.
