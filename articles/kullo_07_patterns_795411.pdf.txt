Abstract
Background: The basis for ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) susceptibility is not
fully understood. We investigated patterns of population differentiation (FST) of a set of genes in
etiologic pathways of CVD among 3 ethnic groups: Yoruba in Nigeria (YRI), Utah residents with
European ancestry (CEU), and Han Chinese (CHB) + Japanese (JPT). We identified 37 pathways
implicated in CVD based on the PANTHER classification and 416 genes in these pathways were
further studied; these genes belonged to 6 biological processes (apoptosis, blood circulation and
gas exchange, blood clotting, homeostasis, immune response, and lipoprotein metabolism).
Genotype data were obtained from the HapMap database.
Results: We calculated FST for 15,559 common SNPs (minor allele frequency ≥ 0.10 in at least one
population) in genes that co-segregated among the populations, as well as an average-weighted FST
for each gene. SNPs were classified as putatively functional (non-synonymous and untranslated
regions) or non-functional (intronic and synonymous sites). Mean FST values for common putatively
functional variants were significantly higher than FST values for nonfunctional variants. A significant
variation in FST was also seen based on biological processes; the processes of 'apoptosis' and
'lipoprotein metabolism' showed an excess of genes with high FST. Thus, putative functional SNPs
in genes in etiologic pathways for CVD show greater population differentiation than non-functional
SNPs and a significant variance of FST values was noted among pairwise population comparisons for
different biological processes.
Conclusion: These results suggest a possible basis for varying susceptibility to CVD among ethnic
groups.

Background
The human population is not homogeneous in terms of
disease susceptibility and substantial differences in susceptibility to common chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), are present between self-identified
ancestral/ethnic groups [1,2]. Significant differences in
CVD prevalence were noted in the Seven Countries Study
[3]. In the United States, African-Americans have a higher

prevalence of hypertension [4] and hypertensive heart disease and significantly greater cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality than Whites [5], whereas Japanese-Americans are less prone to CVD than Whites [6]. Differences in
cardiovascular 'intermediate' phenotypes also occur
among populations; for example, plasma lipid levels differ significantly between African-Americans and non-Hispanic whites, and plasma levels of C-reactive protein vary

substantially between people of different ethnic origins
[7]. The basis for ethnic differences in CVD susceptibility
is not fully understood but it is likely that in addition to
environmental factors, genetic factors contribute either by
determining type or severity of risk factors, as well as the
susceptibility to environmental/lifestyle risk factors [810].
Since different populations are subject to distinct environments, natural selection may produce population-specific
allele frequencies. If a functional genetic variant exhibits
significantly different pattern of geographic variation
compared to a neutral variant, this may be indicative of
different selective pressures across populations [11]. For
instance, a given genetic variation may be adaptive under
a local environmental stressor, which would increase the
allele frequencies of this selected locus in a particular population and lead to a greater level of population differentiation [12,13]. A recent study suggested that differential
susceptibility to hypertension may be due to differential
exposure to selection pressures during the out-of-Africa
expansion [14].
Natural selection alters the amount of differentiation
between or among populations within a species so that a
measure quantifying the differences in allele frequencies
among human populations from diverse geographical
regions – the FST statistic – has been used to test for evidence of selection. FST is a measure of the correlation
between alleles in subpopulations relative to the alleles in
the total population [15,16]. It is expected that local adaptation will lead to an increase in FST, when comparing
populations under different environmental pressures
[17]. Multilocus scans in the human genome, using either
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [18] or microsatellite markers [19], that compare different populations
for several loci, can identify genomic regions carrying a
variant that results in a local adaptation [20]. Recently,
Ryan et al. [21] investigated population differentiation
among different functional classes of immunologically
important genes and found significantly increased FST in
individual nonsynonymous SNPs of the intercellular
adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and Toll-like receptors
(TLR) genes.
Population differentiation has particular relevance for
studies of genetic susceptibility to complex diseases since
many of the genes that are known to have been affected by
natural selection are medically important [22]. Loci with
an increased FST should be considered high priority candidate genes for association studies of complex diseases as
well as the study of local adaptation to environmental
conditions. An example – provided by Rockman et al. [23]
– is the increased frequency of high-expression allele (5T)
of MMP3 due to positive selection in Europe but not else-

where (i.e., a significant differentiation was noted
between populations). This variant is associated with
reduced arterial stiffness, resulting in lower CVD risk.
Understanding genotypic difference among ethnic groups
for these genes in relevant biological pathways will provide insights into ethnic differences in complex diseases
that may be useful in the prevention and treatment of
such diseases [1].
In the present study, using genotype data for three populations from HapMap [24] – Yoruban Africans (YRI),
European Whites (CEU), and East Asians (CHB + JPT) –
we investigated differences in the distribution of common
variants (minor allele frequency ≥ 0.10) of 364 genes in
etiologic pathways for CVD, and assessed patterns of population differentiation of these genes in the various biological processes underlying CVD. Our goal was to
identify loci with high levels of population differentiation, as a step towards understanding the genetic basis of
ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk.

Results
Genotype data for CVD candidate genes
Genotype data for 35,369 SNPs in 405 of 416 genes in etiologic pathways of CVD were available from HapMap;
these included 24,391 SNPs in YRI, 22,751 SNPs in CEU,
and 20,965 SNPs in CHB+JPT, respectively. Pairwise population comparisons of common variants (MAF ≥ 0.10)
showed that a sizeable fraction (79% – 89%) of variants
common in one population were present in another population. To avoid ascertainment bias, we focused on the
co-segregating SNPs among three populations that had a
minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.10 in at least one population and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, as suggested by Weir et al. [25]. In all, 15,559 such SNPs from
364 genes (87.5%) were identified and classified as putative functional SNPs [5' untranslated regions (5' UTR);
coding (nonsynonymous) sites; and 3' untranslated
regions (3' UTR)] and non-functional SNPs [coding (synonymous) sites; and intronic sites], based on NCBI SNP
database [26] or UCSC genome browsers [27] (Table 1).

Patterns of FST of CVD candidate genes in three
populations
Distribution of pairwise FST values
We first compared the distribution of FST values of 15,559
SNPs among the three populations. The mean FST for YRI
vs. CEU was 0.139, for YRI vs. CHB + JPT, 0.158, and for
CEU vs. CHB + JPT, 0.095 (Figure 1a). Thus, FST between
Africans and East Asians was slightly higher than the
genome-wide average of FST (0.10 ~0.15, i.e., the background FST) previously noted to be present between subSaharan Africans, Northern Europeans, and East Asians
[28-31]. The distribution of single-locus estimates of FST
values between two populations has an approximate χ2
distribution (Figure 1b). The distribution of FST between
pairwise populations was significantly different (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P < 10-16). There was a higher proportion of low (< 0.10) pairwise FST in CEU vs. CHB + JPT
(63.5%), compared with YRI vs. CEU (52.5%) or CHB +
JPT (49.0%). Larger FST values (> 0.2) for common SNPs
were observed in YRI vs. CEU (25.6%) and YRI vs. CHB +
JPT (30.0%), but less often in CEU vs. CHB + JPT (15.4%).

We randomly selected 15,559 SNPs from the data generated by coalescent simulations (one MB region, 1,000
times, see Methods), which matched the characteristics of
the observed data in terms of sample size, average FST (Figure 1c), and MAF (i.e., ≥ 0.10 at least in one population).

The simulated distribution of pairwise FST (Figure 1d) was
significantly different compared with the observed HapMap data (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P < 10-10). An excess
of high-FST values were present in the HapMap data for the
set of genes in the present study, consistent with action of
either genetic drift or natural selection and local adaptation leading to an increase in allele frequencies for the
selected locus in a particular population [18]. It should be
noted that the simulated FST underestimated the FST from
the empirical data, consistent with the previous findings
[32] and indicating that simulation did not perfectly predict FST.
Distribution of pairwise FST based on SNP functional classification
To assess differences in the distribution of combined FST
values according to different categories of SNPs, we plotted the correlation between mean pairwise FST and MAF
according to the five different SNPs categories (Figure 2).
The mean FST values for SNPs of different categories conditioned on MAF are listed in Table S2 (see additional file
1). Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), we found that
the pairwise mean FST values in CEU vs. CHB + JPT varied
significantly among different SNP categories (P = 0.019)
by analysis of variance, but not in YRI vs. CEU (P = 0.273)
and YRI vs. CHB + JPT (P = 0.124) (see Methods). In addition, pairwise mean FST values between any two populations differed with MAF (P < 2.2 × 10-16), and there was a
significant interaction of logarithm transformed MAF ×
category (P < 3.3 × 10-5), indicating that the effect of SNP
category was modified by MAF.

Common, putative functional SNPs (i.e., SNPs in potentially functional genomic elements such as non-synonymous sites, 5' and 3' UTR) had systematically higher mean
FST values than SNPs in nonfunctional genomic elements
(i.e., intronic and synonymous sites), although this was
limited to SNPs with MAF ≥ 0.30. For example, when
comparing YRI vs. CHB + JPT, mean FST for common SNPs
with MAF of 0.35–0.40 in non-synonymous sites (FST =
0.303) was higher than that in synonymous (FST = 0.124)
and intronic sites (FST = 0.201) (Figure 2b), although the
effect was not statistically significant (pairwise comparison by 'multcomp' library in R) due to the limited number
of non-synonymous sites. Much higher mean FST values
for non-synonymous SNPs with MAF of 0.45–0.50 were
noted in YRI vs. CEU (FST = 0.505).
Patterns of FST in biological processes and functional pathways
We compared the distribution of FST values for 364 genes
in various biological processes (= 6) or functional pathways (= 37). The boxplots of FST values in different biological processes are shown in Figure 3. Significant variation
in FST values was seen among different biological processes (P ≤ 3.1 × 10-15, Kruskal-Wallis test).

In general, mean FST for each biological process was significantly higher between Africans and non-Africans (especially between Africans and East Asians), in comparison
with that between non-Africans (P < 0.05, pairwise t test)
(Figure 3). The patterns of FST suggested differential local
factors operating on the selected biological processes
among populations. For example, for genes in the 'blood
circulation & gas exchange' pathway, the mean FST value
was 0.129 in YRI vs. CEU and 0.158 in YRI vs. CHB + JPT,
but significantly lower (FST = 0.062) in CEU vs. CHB + JPT.
A similar pattern was also noted in the 'lipoprotein
metabolism' genes (YRI vs. CEU: 0.144; YRI vs. CHB + JPT:
0.165; and CEU vs. CHB + JPT: 0.082).
Significant variation in FST was also noted among the 37
functional pathways, (data not shown; P < 2.2 × 10-16,
Kruskal-Wallis test). As expected, the mean FST for each
functional pathway was significantly higher between Africans and non-Africans, than between non-Africans. Most
strikingly, genes in the 'Insulin/IGF-mitogen activated
protein kinase kinase/MAP kinase cascade' pathway
showed a relatively high FST in all pairwise population
comparisons (YRI vs. CEU: 0.194, YRI vs. CHB + JPT:
0.174 and CEU vs. CHB + JPT: 0.138). Also, a relatively
high FST between Africans and non-Africans was noted in
the 'interleukin signaling pathway' genes (YRI vs. CEU:
0.192 and YRI vs. CHB + JPT: 0.210).
Signatures of local adaptation
The HapMap data provides a genome-wide empirical distribution of FST against which significance of FST values
can be evaluated, rather than based on theoretical computer simulations [33]. SNPs distant from genes are good
candidates for neutral mutations since genes and their reg-

ulatory elements are more likely to be under selection
than non-coding DNA [34]. We acquired the empirical
'neutral' distribution of FST values from 289 intergenic
regions across the autosomal genome (14,792 SNPs) and
17 intergenic regions across the X chromosome (372
SNPs) without considering the effect of MAF. For autosomal chromosomes, the 95% upper limits of FST values
were: YRI vs. CEU (= 0.602); YRI vs. CHB + JPT (= 0.640);
and CEU vs. CHB + JPT (= 0.466) (Figure 4). The 95%
upper limits of FST values were higher for chromosome X
– 0.729 (YRI vs. CEU), 0.828 (YRI vs. CHB + JPT), and
0.707 (CEU vs. CHB + JPT), respectively.
We first calculated the significance level of FST for each
SNP locus. A small fraction of SNP loci showed a significantly higher FST (P < 0.05) based on the empirical 'neutral' distribution of FST values – 238 SNPs (1.53%) in YRI
vs. CEU, 325 (2.09%) in YRI vs. CHB + JPT, and 164
(1.05%) in CEU vs. CHB + JPT, respectively. The number
of genes with at least one unusually high FST value according to biological process is shown in Table 2. The biological processes of 'apoptosis' and 'lipoprotein metabolism'
showed an excess of genes (31.3% and 34.0%) with a significantly higher FST (Table 2, Figure 5).
We also calculated a weighted-average FST, combining
information over loci [35] that summarizes the levels of
interpopulation differentiation in each gene. Genes with a
significantly higher weighted-average FST are shown in
Table 3. In total, there were signatures of local adaptation
in nine genes (2.5%) – four genes in YRI vs. CEU and
three genes in YRI vs. CHB + JPT, and three genes in CEU
vs. CHB + JPT. Most of the genes are involved in 'immune
response' (GRB2, IKBKB, IL4, IL6) and 'apoptosis'

loci with a significantly high FST.

Discussion
The most direct way to study whether genetic risk factors
vary among ethnic groups is to determine whether disease
susceptibility variants differ in frequency and/or effect
among groups [36]. Several studies have demonstrated
that the genotype frequencies of SNPs in candidate genes
for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) differ among populations [2,9,37]. Lanfear et al. [9] found higher frequencies
of disease-associated genotypes in African-Americans than
in European-Americans for polymorphisms in GJA4,
SERPINE1 (PAI-1) and MMP3. Two nonsense mutations
in PCSK9 that lead to lower plasma levels of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol are relatively common in AfricanAmericans (2%) but rare in European-Americans (<
0.1%) [37]. Significant differences in allele frequencies
were noted in the polymorphisms of IL2, IL6, and IL10
among Blacks, Whites, and Asians [38]. In a meta-analysis, Ioannidis et al. [2] assessed 43 validated gene-disease
associations across 697 study populations of various ethnicities and found that frequencies of polymorphisms in
seven cardiovascular disease genes – APOE, ACE, ITGB3,
MTHFR, F2, PON1, and PON2 – varied significantly
between ethnicities (I2 ≥ 75%; I2 being a measure of the

extent to which the heterogeneity is not due to chance)
[2]. These loci (except APOE) showed a large heterogeneity of 'race'-specific frequency of polymorphisms. In addition, a disease-associated mutation may be present at high
frequency in one population but virtually absent in
another, an example being a variant in the SCN5A gene
(associated with cardiac arrhythmia) [39], which is
present in African-Americans at an allele frequency of
0.132 and is not found in Europeans and Asians. However, the FST value may not be a 'sensitive' test and genes
implicated in CVD susceptibility may not lead to exceptionally elevated FST values. For example, the FST value was
not significantly higher for the nonsense mutation in
PCSK9 when comparing African-Americans (allele frequency: ~2%) and European-Americans (frequency <
0.1%).
Gene variants that interact with geographic- or population-specific environmental factors may be under strong
positive or diversifying selection pressure [40]. A measure
of population differentiation (i.e., FST) has been used to
quantify the degree to which populations are subdivided
for particular genetic variants. While other measures, such
as the nearest-neighbor statistic (Snn) [41], and c parameter (i.e., measuring how isolated a population has been)
[42] are used to identify the level of population differentiation, the unbiased estimator of FST is simple and easy to
calculate. We calculated FST for SNPs in a set of genes in
causal pathways for CVD, to identify the patterns of differ-

ences for allele frequencies from one ethnic group to
another.
To avoid false positive results due to genotyping error and
ascertainment bias [18,25,43], we studied SNPs that were
in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, had a minor allele frequency (MAF) of ≥ 0.10 in at least one population (i.e.,
common SNPs), and cosegregated in all three populations
[25]. The relatively low genotype error rate (0.3%) in HapMap data [33] has likely had a limited impact on estimates of FST [18]. Consistent with previous reports [44],
most common SNPs were shared between populations in
the present study and 10–20% of the common variants
present in one population are not necessarily common in

the other population (i.e., private SNPs), especially when
comparing Africans and non-Africans. However, whether
the 'private' or shared common SNPs contribute to ethnic
differences of CVD risk needs further investigation. The
approximate chi-square distribution of FST (Figure 1b) is
similar to the distribution for the entire HapMap data
[25]. The distribution of pairwise FST is similar for the YRI
vs. CEU and YRI vs. CHB + JPT, consistent with previous
reports [28,33,44]. The lower level of population differentiation in CEU vs. CHB + JPT supports a recent split
between these two populations.
Given that candidate loci with large FST values might have
undergone local adaptation [18,45], we hypothesized that
FST values would be higher in putatively functional variants than in putatively nonfunctional variants. Common
functional SNPs with large FST values may influence variation in disease susceptibility among different populations. A high divergence of allele frequency was noted
among putatively functional (e.g., nonsynonymous sites
and SNPs in 5', and 3' UTRs) and non-functional SNPs
(Figure 2). In addition, the pattern varied in different pairwise population comparisons and was most obvious for
the Africans vs. non-Africans comparison. An extreme

example is a non-synonymous SNP in F2 (rs5896, Met165
→ Thr) with higher FST in YRI vs. CHB + JPT (FST = 1.000)
and CEU vs. CHB + JPT (FST = 0.950), at a MAF of 0.00,
0.05, and 1.00 in YRI, CEU and CHB + JPT, respectively.
This finding has also been reported in a prior analysis of
the Phase I HapMap data [33].
To provide a reasonable biological explanation for the FST
values, we considered the sampling distribution of the FST
estimates. One of the methods is based on numerical sampling or permutation procedures so that FST is estimated
and the proportion of values larger than or equal to the
one estimated from the observed data set will yield the
unbiased P-value of the test [46]. Yet another method
involves the use of variances in actual values of FST to
detect regions of exceptional FST values, defined as population-average values more than three standard deviations
from the chromosomal average [25]. An alternative strategy is based on coalescent theory that simulates the histories of the samples or the populations. An expected
distribution of FST for 15,559 simulated SNPs was generated under the calibrated demographic model [32] (Figure 1c~d). Recently, an empirical distribution has been
used to test the significance level of FST [18,47,48]. Instead
of whole-genome empirical distribution of FST [18,34], we
used an empirical distribution of FST from 'neutral' loci in
289 and 17 intergenic regions from autosomal chromosomes and X chromosome, respectively. The number of
SNPs for empirical neutral distribution (14,792 from
autosomal chromosomes and 372 from the X chromosome) takes into account the multiple testing incurred in
our evaluation of 15,559 SNPs. This 'neutral' empirical
distribution of FST is most likely shaped by only demography and therefore the P values of FST estimated from the
empirical distribution may represent a more reliable indicator of selection. The mean and 95% upper limits of this
'neutral' distribution are slightly higher than the previously used 'neutral' empirical [18,47] or the simulated
distribution (Figure 4), indicating the statistical test using
the empirical distribution is more conservative. Although
none of the SNPs or the genes remained significant after
correction for multiple testing using false discovery rate
[49], the method of population differentiation can used
as an exploratory tool for detecting local adaptation [47].
Genes are subjected to different evolutionary constraints
depending on their biological functions and genes with a
higher population differentiation are likely to have been
more readily influenced by the environment [40]. For
instance, Grossman et al. [50] found that FST values for
'apoptosis' genes among Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Arab
Israelis are low. In the present study, most striking was the
high mean FST in the biological process of 'apoptosis' (FST
= 0.166) and 'lipoprotein metabolism' (FST = 0.165)
between YRI vs. CHB + JPT, but lower FST in CEU vs. CHB

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/48

+ JPT (0.091 and 0.082, respectively) (Figure 3). The patterns suggested that differential environments pressures
may have accounted for the varying FST among biological
processes for different populations.
The biological processes of 'apoptosis' and 'lipoprotein
metabolism' showed an excess of high FST values, which
may be the result of local adaptation or genetic drift
(Table 2, Figure 5). The combined information of FST over
loci provides a means to quantify the level of population
differentiation in a given gene (Figure 6) [35]. A summary
of functions for these genes relevant to CVD is shown in
Table S3 (see additional file 1). For three gene loci – F2,
IL4, and IL6 – significantly higher FST values in CEU vs.
CHB + JPT were noted (Table 3). Previous studies also
demonstrated a higher population differentiation in IL4
between Europeans and East Asians [51]. These findings
suggest that different selective factors might be exerting
locus-specific effects in populations with different geographic origin. Most of the genes under local adaptation
were in the 'immune response' and 'apoptosis' pathways
(Table 3). How these biological processes may promote
differential susceptibility to CVD among Africans and
non-Africans need further study.
Given that CVD susceptibility varies among populations,
genes that are responsible for such variations should also
differ among populations. Hence, regardless of whether
drift or selection is responsible, the approach of looking
among a set of candidate genes for those with highest FST
values should help identify candidate genes to explain differences in CVD susceptibility. The present study identifies genes in etiological pathways of CVD with a high FST
among populations, and should be considered as a means
of generating new hypotheses to test (i.e., reprioritize candidate genes rather than identify new ones). Putative functional SNPs with a high FST should be investigated further
for confirmation of functional effects and should be
included in CVD association studies among populations.
In addition, the differential patterns of FST among biological processes and functional pathways may provide
insight into the mechanisms contributing to varying CVD
susceptibility among different populations.
Our study has several limitations. First, since population
differentiation detects local adaptation in geographically
separate populations within the last ~75,000 years [52],
the present study cannot identify genes subject to natural
selection before this time scale. Phylogenetic analyses [52]
detect evolutionary changes preceding this time period
whereas nucleotide diversity and LD-based tests [22,53]
may be helpful in further investigating genomic regions
with significantly high FST values. Second, the fluctuation
of allele frequencies due to a relatively small sample size
could affect the robustness of our inferences. Thus, esti-

mation of allele frequencies in a larger sample would be
needed to confirm our results. Even though common
SNPs (MAF > 0.1) that conformed to Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (HWE) were included, we cannot completely
address the issues of ascertainment bias of SNPs [43].
However, SNPs with MAF < 0.1 and not in HWE could
have biological relevance since natural selection, not genotyping error also could lead to deviation from HWE.
Third, we did not adjust for recombination rate in our
analyses. We found a negative correlation between the
weighted-average FST and recombination rate (based on
the recombination map of Kong et al. [54]), although the
correlation was not statistically significant (analyses not
shown). The recombination rate in genes with a high FST
listed in Figure 6 (except GRB2 and PRIK1) was below the
average recombination rate (1cM/MB) across the human
genome. Finally, a complete catalogue of etiologic pathways implicated in CVD is yet to be established.

Conclusion
In summary, the present study of genes in etiologic pathways for CVD revealed greater population differentiation
in putative functional SNPs in these genes, as well as significant variation in FST based on different biological processes relevant to CVD. The biological processes of
'apoptosis' and 'lipoprotein metabolism' showed an
excess of genes with high FST. In addition, the pattern varied in different pairwise population comparisons. SNP
loci (especially putatively functional SNPs) and genes
with a significantly higher population differentiation
should be considered high priority for investigating
genetic factors influencing differences in CVD risk among
populations.

Methods
Genes in the etiologic pathways for cardiovascular disease
(CVD)
Based on a search of the literature in PUBMED [55], we
identified 37 functional pathways implicated in CVD (a
summary of the functional pathways, the number of genes
in each pathway and corresponding references is presented in Table S1, see additional file 1). We explored 416
genes from these pathways using the Panther classification system [56,57]. These genes were classified into the
following biological processes relevant to CVD: 1) apoptosis; 2) blood circulation & gas exchange; 3) blood clotting; 4) homeostasis; 5) immunity and defense; and 6)
lipid fatty acid & steroid metabolism. Examples of candidate genes in various pathways were: caspase and TNF/
TNF receptor gene family in the 'apoptosis' process;
endothelin and nitric oxide synthase 3 genes in the 'blood
circulation & gas exchange' process; those genes involved
in the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathway in the
'blood clotting' process; the gene family of insulin receptor substrate in the 'homeostasis' process; those genes participating in the inflammation response, such as the
interleukin gene family, in the 'immunity and defense'
process; and the arachidonate-lipoxygenase, and phospholipase gene family in the 'lipid fatty acid and steroid
metabolism' process.
Genotype data
Using the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) reference sequence [58], we aligned the sequence
of messenger RNA of each gene with the human chromosome sequence (NCBI build 35). Based on the alignment,
the genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in each gene were obtained from HapMap database (Phase II) [24,33]. The HapMap data includes 90
individuals (30 trios) from the Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria
(YRI), 90 individuals (30 trios) in Utah residents with

ancestry from Northern and Western Europe (CEU), 45
unrelated Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB) and 45
unrelated Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT). For each gene,
map information for SNPs was obtained from NCBI and
the genome annotation database at University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) [27]. The reference mRNA
sequence was annotated as 5' untranslated regions (5'
UTR), coding (synonymous and non-synonymous),
intronic, and 3' untranslated regions (3' UTR).
Calculation of FST
The estimate of population differentiation, FST, measures

relatedness of pairs of alleles within a population relative
to the total populations [16,35]. We calculated an unbiased small-sample estimator of FST as described by Weir

loci [35] was calculated using the 'Genepop' software (version 3.4) [61].
Expected distribution of FST under a calibrated
demographic model
We used coalescent theory to obtain the expected distribution of FST under a calibrated demographic model for Africans, Europeans, and Asians [32]. Using the program 'cosi'
[62], we simulated a one megabase (MB) region 1,000
times under the 'best-fitting' population parameters for
the three populations. The 'best-fitting' set of parameters
yielded good agreement with all aspects (including allele
frequency spectrum, fraction of alleles that are ancestral,
linkage disequilibrium, and FST) of the observed data in
the human genome [32]. Pairwise FST among populations
was calculated for each simulated SNP.

[16,59]. If there are ni alleles sampled from the ith of r populations, the sample frequency of the SNP allele u in the
ith subpopulation is piu , and a weighted average of pu
across population is pu =

FST was estimated for each SNP locus and a weighted-average FST was estimated for each gene [35,60]. FST can be
negative when levels of differentiation are close to zero
and/or sample sizes are small, indicating no population
differentiation at these loci [35]. In our analysis, we
assigned a value of zero to negative FST values. The program for calculating FST for each SNP locus was written in
Perl and is available from the authors upon request. The
weighted-average FST value combining information over

Significance of FST
Population demographic history, such as migration
among sub-populations, can also influence FST [63]. By
comparing the FST of an individual locus to the empirical
distribution, it is possible to distinguish between genetic
drift and natural selection without having to take population demographic history into account [64]. To assess the
statistical significance of FST values for SNPs, we selected
289 intergenic regions across the autosomal genome and
17 intergenic regions across chromosome X to obtain a
neutral distribution of FST, based on the annotation tables
of human chromosomes from UCSC database. These
regions were separated by at least one MB from the closest
exon and did not include centromeric regions. Each
region spanned an average of 1.52 MB and in total composed 466.10 MB. Following the method of Izagirre et al.
[47], we defined 'neutral' SNPs as follows: 1) separated by
at least 25 kb from each other, 2) genotyped in all three
populations, and 3) MAF ≥ 0.10 in at least one of the three
populations. In all, 14,792 SNPs for autosomal chromosomes and 372 SNPs for the X chromosome satisfied these
criteria. We used the observed 'neutral' distribution to
assess the significance level of the FST for each SNP (P
value, one-sided) in the autosomal and X chromosome
regions separately. We focused on the significantly higher
values of FST for local adaptation, although significantly
lower FST might result from balancing selection.

All statistical analyses were performed using R. Analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare linear
regressions of FST against logarithm of MAF [ln(MAF)]
with and without the terms for the SNP category and a
ln(MAF) × category interaction.
