Abstract
Background: The taxonomic name of an organism is a key link between different databases that
store information on that organism. However, in the absence of a single, comprehensive database
of organism names, individual databases lack an easy means of checking the correctness of a name.
Furthermore, the same organism may have more than one name, and the same name may apply to
more than one organism.
Results: The Taxonomic Search Engine (TSE) is a web application written in PHP that queries
multiple taxonomic databases (ITIS, Index Fungorum, IPNI, NCBI, and uBIO) and summarises the
results in a consistent format. It supports "drill-down" queries to retrieve a specific record. The
TSE can optionally suggest alternative spellings the user can try. It also acts as a Life Science
Identifier (LSID) authority for the source taxonomic databases, providing globally unique identifiers
(and associated metadata) for each name.
Conclusion: The Taxonomic Search Engine is available at http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/
portal/ and provides a simple demonstration of the potential of the federated approach to providing
access to taxonomic names.

Background
Biological taxonomy provides the central link between
diverse items of information about an organism. Given
the scientific name of an organism, a researcher can query
a wide range of databases for information on that organism's genome, development, morphology, geographic
distribution, behaviour, phylogeny, and conservation status. However, the utility of taxonomic names as keys to
accessing information is hampered by several factors,
notably the lack of a single authoritative list of all taxonomic names [1,2]. In the absence of such a list, databases
that make use of taxonomic names have no ready means
of validating those names. Consequently, there is no guar-

antee that taxonomic names stored in different databases
will be mutually consistent.
In the absence of a single database of names, one solution
is to use a federated approach [3] where multiple, independent databases are queried. Numerous taxonomic
databases exist, although each tends to have limited taxonomic and geographic scope, and the degree of interoperability among these databases varies greatly. The NIH/
NIAID/Wellcome Trust Workshop on Model Organism
Databases [4] defines the minimum level of interoperability as providing a FTP dump of the database contents. The
only taxonomic databases currently meeting even this

minimum level are the Integrated Taxonomic Information Service (ITIS) [5] and the NCBI Taxonomy [6] databases. Greater degrees of interoperability require the
availability of an explicit Application Programming Interface (API) that clients can use to query the database. Each
taxonomic database provider has developed their own
interface which is typically aimed at a single user with a
web browser. Few databases provide an API, or better still,
a documented API. Taxonomic names themselves have limitations as identifiers in databases [7] due to the existence
of multiple names (synonyms) for the same taxon, and
the use of the same name to refer to different taxa. For
example, the genus Morus applies to both an animal (the
gannet) and a plant (the mulberry tree). Even species
names can be identical – a species of wasp and a species
of conifer both share the name Agathis montana. Hence,
using names alone to link different data sources can be
prone to error. As an example, at the time of writing
NCBI's LinkOut feature [8] mistakenly links the catfish
genus Loricaria (tax_id = 52085) to the TreeBASE [9] taxon
Loricaria (TaxonID = 1305), which is a plant genus (family
Compositae).
To avoid ambiguity some form of identifier other than a
taxonomic name needs to be employed, such as Digital
Object Identifiers (DOIs) [10] or Life Science Identifiers
(LSIDs) [11,12]. Given such an identifier a user can unambiguiously refer to a name, and at the same time discover
the provenance of that name (i.e., the source database).
The use of globally unique identifiers in taxonomy is in its
infancy: the use of DOIs has been explored in the context
of prokaryote taxonomy [13], but LSIDs have yet to be
employed for taxonomic names. Instead most efforts to
link taxonomic databases use URLs (e.g., Species 2000
[14]) and NCBI Linkout [8]). However link integration
using URLs has serious limitations [15].
Given the lack of a central list of names, and the limitations of names as identifiers, there is a clear need for a taxonomy name service that can validate names and provide
unique identifiers [2]. The SPICE project [16,17] has
explored the utility of a federated approach to querying
taxonomic databases. For each database, SPICE requires
that a wrapper is installed on the computer hosting that
database. This wrapper communicates natively with the
local database to perform a standard set of queries. The
central query engine then communicates with each
instance of the wrapper using a consistent protocol (e.g.,
CGI). This approach places much of the burden of interoperability on the source database, which must adapt and
install the SPICE wrappers.
This paper describes the Taxonomic Search Engine (TSE),
which takes federated approach to the problem of searching for taxonomic names. Unlike the SPICE project, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/48

TSE relies solely on the interfaces made available by the
data source. A wrapper is created for each source database,
but this resides on the same machine as the TSE. In this
way, no special demands are made of the source database.
The TSE searches multiple databases for a name, and
returns the result in a consistent format. For each name,
TSE also creates a LSID, so that each name from each
source database has a globally unique identifier.

Implementation
Source databases
The TSE uses five data providers: ITIS, Index Fungorum,
IPNI, uBIO, and the NCBI.
ITIS
The Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) [5]
was established in the mid 1990's by a consortium of
United States federal agencies tasked with to providing a
database of taxonomic information for North American
taxa. In addition to the original site in the United States
[5], there is a French language version hosted by the Canadian Biodiversity Information Facility [18], and a Spanish
language version hosted in Mexcio [19]. The Canadian
site can serve data in XML format, and users can search for
a name, or retreive details about an individual record
using a simple URL API. A Document Type Definition
(DTD) file for the XML format is available from the ITIS
web site.

ITIS provides a classification of taxonomic names (i.e., a
parent-child hierarchy), and where more than one name
exists for a taxon, ITIS specifies which name it regards as
correct (termed the "accepted" name if the taxon is an animal, and "valid" if it is a plant). Every name in the database, regardless of taxonomic status or position in the
hierarchy is assigned a unique identifier (its "taxon serial
number"). The database schema is fully documented, and
the entire database is available for downloading by FTP as
a SQL schema with the data in delimited text files. As a
consequence, ITIS is frequently used as the de facto source
of taxonomic data in biodiversity informatics projects.
IPNI
The International Plant Names Index (IPNI) [20] combines data from three sources: Index Kewensis (Royal
Botanic Gardens, Kew), the Gray Card Index (Harvard
University Herbaria), and the Australian Plant Names
Index (Australian National Herbarium), and contains
some 1.6 million records. It provides names and associated basic bibliographical details for vascular plants. The
IPNI web site provides web forms for querying the database, and data can be returned in HTML, "%" delimited
text, or XML. However, the XML is a serialisation of IPNI
database objects, rather than a format designed to be handled by end users. There are plans to support emerging

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:48

standards, such as the Taxonomic Concept Transfer
Schema [21]. IPNI aims to be a catalogue of all names that
have been applied to vascular plants. However, where
more than one name for a taxon exists, IPNI does not
specify which name should be used, that is, it does not
indicate an "accepted name" for a taxon. In this sense it is
That is, it is a nomenclatural database rather than a taxonomic database. However, if two names are nomenclatural synonyms, the HTML output specifies the nature of
synonymy, such as "basionym" (one name is the original
name for the taxon), "nomenclatural synonym" (one or
other of the names is the basionym, or the names share a
basionym), or "replaced synonym" (one name has been
created to replace another). IPNI provides a minimal classification, in that genera are assigned to families, but no
higher-level classification is given.
Index Fungorum
IndexFungorum [22] is a database of over 370,000 names
of fungi, primarily at species level. The database can be
searched through a web interface or through a SOAP web
service
http://www.indexfungorum.org/ixfwebservice/
fungus.asmx which returns an XML document. If more
than one name exists for a fungus, Index Fungorum designates one name as the "current name." It also reports the
basionym (first recorded name) for that taxon. Index Fungorum does support a detailed hierarchical classification
in the form of a lineage, but higher level taxa are not
assigned records in the database (unlike, for example,
ITIS). In fungal taxonomy, names are often assigned to the
asexual state (anamorph) of a fungus for which the sexual
state (telomorph) is unknown. Names for anamorphs are
flagged as such in the database.
uBio
The Universal Biological Indexer and Organizer (uBio)
[23] is a product of the science library community, and is
motivated by the information retrieval problem posed by
the lack of long term stability of many taxonomic names
[2]. Presently it is the single largest electronic catalogue of
scientific names (1,396,868 as of 13 November 2004). In
addition to a web interface uBio provides a SOAP web
service http://www.ubio.org/service/ which returns a
nested array data structure.
NCBI
The NCBI Taxonomy database [6] is a curated database of
the names of all organisms for which sequences have been
submitted to GenBank [24]. Each taxon regardless of taxonomic level is assigned a unique identifier (the "taxid"),
and the NCBI taxonomy provides a single classification
for all taxa in its database. If a taxon has more than one
scientific name, each name has name has the same taxid,
but only one is indicated as the "scientific name" [25]. The
other names are flagged as synonyms, common names,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/48

etc. The NCBI taxonomy is not intended to be an authoritative source of taxonomic information, but is a rapidly
grouping database that contains many taxa that are not
found in other databases. Although every sequence in
NCBI is assigned to an organism, in many cases the exact
identity of that organism may be unknown. Sequences
obtained from environmental sampling are typically unidentified, and the number of such sequences is likely to
increase with the advent of large scale environmental
genomics [26]. The NCBI taxonomy database can be queried via the Entrez Utilities [27] using wither a URL or a
SOAP interface. The entire database is also available for
download by FTP.
Architecture
The basic architecture of the TSE is summarised in Fig. 1.
For each database a wrapper (implemented as a class in
the PHP scripting language) is responsible for communicating with the database, using either the HTTP GET protocol (using the Net HTTP Client [28] library) or SOAP
(using the NuSOAP library [29]). The wrapper takes the
query string supplied by the user, and constructs a suitable
query for the corresponding database, such as a URL or a
SOAP call. The wrapper is also responsible for handling
the response. If databases return a XML document this is
transformed using an XSLT style sheet into the XML format used by TSE. Other formats such as text or SOAP data
structures are converted into XML by the wrapper.

Each wrapper is derived from the same base class which
provides some generic routines for creating XML documents and for caching results (see next section). The wrapper class supports three methods, IsAlive, NameSearch, and
GetDataForID, which must be overridden in descendant
classes. The IsAlive method queries whether the data
source is available. The NameSearch method queries a data
source for a given string. If one or more names are found,
NameSearch returns basic information about that name,
including the identifier used by the data source. This identifier is used by the GetDataForID method to query the
data source for more details about the name.
Caching results
In order to improve the responsiveness of the search
engine, the results of queries to each source database are
cached for 24 hours. The results of the query are stored in
the format returned by the database (i.e., XML or delimited text), except for uBio where the SOAP response is serialised to disk.
Approximate string matching
The Taxonomic Search Engine seeks exact matches to the
user supplied query. In order to accommodate spelling
mistakes the web interface to the search engine supports
approximate string matching using two techniques. The

first employs agrep [30] to search for a match amongst a
flat file list of names obtained from the ITIS and NCBI
databases. Names showing no more than two character
differences from the query string are returned as suggested
alternative spellings. To supplement agrep, the TSE calls
Google's spelling suggestion web service [31] and adds the
result of that query (if any) to the list of suggested
spellings.
Interface
The TSE has a simple web interface (Fig. 2). The user types
in a query, and has the option to specify whether TSE
should look for alternative spellings. Clicking on the "Go"
button starts the search. The XML summary of the search
is transformed into HTML using an XSLT transformation.

The user can click on a name to get more information,
including a link to the original database source for the
name, and a LSID for the name.
Web service
The TSE has a SOAP web service that is described by a Web
Services Description Language (WSDL) file available at
http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/portal/
TSE.php?wsdl. The service provides two operations:
NameSearch which queries the source databases for a usersupplied name, and SpellingSuggestion, which suggests
alternative spellings for a name. Hence users can write
web service clients that can use the TSE as part of their
own applications. The TSE web site provides source code
for two simple clients written in perl.

Screen shot the Taxonomic Search Engine
Screen shot of the Taxonomic Search Engine. The web browser displays the results of searching for a name in five
external databases. For each database that returns a "hit" the page displays some information about that name. The user can
click on the name to obtain further information about the name, including a link to the original database record, and a Life Science Identifier (LSID) for that record.

Life Science Identifiers
A LSID is a Uniform Resource Name (URN) comprising
five parts: the Network Identifier ("lsid"), the root DNS
name of the issuing authority, a namespace, an object
identifier, and optionally a revision id to indicate the ver-

sion [11]. TSE generates LSIDs by concatenating the name
of the source web server with the suffix "lsid.zoology.gla.ac.uk" to generate the authority. The namespace is
the name given to the identifier in the source database,
and the object identifier is the identifier used by the

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:48

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/48

source database. For example, the record for Homo sapiens
in the ITIS database would have the LSID:
urn:lsid:itis.usda.gov.lsid.zoology.gla.ac.uk:tsn:180092
where "tsn" is the "taxonomic serial number" used by ITIS
as a unique identifier for each taxonomic name, and
"180092" is the tsn for Homo sapiens.
The TSE uses the perl library distributed by IBM's Life Science Identifier project [11] to create a LSID authority for
each of the source databases. Hence, any software that can
resolve LSIDs (such as LaunchPad [11] or the BioPathways Consortium Web Resolver [32]) can view the metadata associated with an LSID generated by TSE. For ITIS
this metadata is constructed by querying a local copy of
the ITIS database, but for the remaining databases the
LSID metadata is generated using the same combination
of GET/HTTP and SOAP calls used to query the source
databases by TSE (although these calls are implemented
in perl).
Performance evaluation
The 2004 edition of the Species 2000 CD-ROM [14] was
used as a source of names with which to query the TSE.
This database comprises 583,469 names provided by 18
taxonomic databases, two of which (ITIS and Index Fungorum) are also source databases for TSE. In addition,
uBio currently includes names from the 2003 edition of
the Species 2000 CD-ROM in its database. Hence, most
names in the Species 2000 list are likely to be found by
TSE.

To create a test dataset, 1000 names were selected at random from the Species 2000 dataset. Each name was sent
to the TSE web service by a perl script which recorded the
time taken for each source database to respond to the
query, and whether that source database contained the
name. The time recorded is from the time the query was

made until the time the response was returned – post
processing by the TSE is not included in the measurement.
For this experiment, the cache feature was turned off so
that for each query the TSE went to the external source
database, rather than using a local copy of the query
result.

Results and discussion
Performance
The results of the simple performance benchmarks are
shown in Table 1. Most of the names were found in uBio
(887 of the 1000 names), which is as expected given that
uBio has harvested all the names in the previous (2003)
edition of the Species 2000 CD-ROM. ITIS is a major contributor to both uBio and Species 2000, and just over half
the names in the test set are present in ITIS. The Species
2000 CD-ROM contains some names from Index Fungorum, and none from IPNI, hence its coverage of plants and
fungi is somewhat limited. That only 10% of the query
names were found in the NCBI database suggests there is
little overlap between the taxa being catalogued by taxonomic databases and those being sequenced. Amongst the
five source databases, ITIS had the slowest median
response time (0.915 seconds) and Index Fungorum was
the quickest (0.132 seconds). The IPNI database was the
second slowest, and occasionally took up to a minute to
respond – on 20 occasions no response was obtained at
all. It is difficult to generalise about these results as the
performance of a data source will depend on a number of
factors, such as the server hardware and software, the database design, and the load other users are placing on the
system. For the five data sources currently queried, the
operating systems being used include both Linux and
Windows 2000, the web servers are Apache, Oracle HTTP
server, and Microsoft IIS (determined by NetCraft [33]),
and the database vendors include Microsoft, Oracle, and
MySQL. However, it is encouraging that five such disparate systems all have a median response time of less than
a second.

Extensibility
The TSE can be extended to handle additional data
sources simply by deriving a new wrapper class from the
base class. To date wrappers have only been written for
data sources which can return plain text, XML, or SOAP
messages. There are many more taxonomic databases that
could be queried if wrappers were written to handle
HTML output ("screen scraping"). However, this would
make the wrapper very vulnerable to changes in web page
design [34]. Of course, a change in a data source's API
would also break the wrapper. This is a general problem
in integrating disparate databases [34], and in the long
term a better solution would be for each taxonomic database to support a standard API that services such as the
TSE can query.
Scalability
Despite the reasonable performance of TSE, there are
obvious limitations in the current design and implementation. The PHP language does not support threads, so
each source database is queried sequentially. As additional source databases are added the time to complete
the search will get progressively longer. If the performance
of additional databases is comparable to those already
being queried (Table 1), then each new source will add at
least 0.5 – 1.0 seconds to the time required for TSE to
return a result (not counting the additional overhead of
pre- and post-processing the query). If the search engine is
to scale to handle a large number of databases it is likely
that these databases will need to be queried in parallel.
Query filtering
Some source databases have broad taxonomic coverage
such as ITIS, NCBI, and uBio, whereas others are restricted
to particular groups, such as fungi (Index Fungorum) and
vascular plants (IPNI). Hence, it makes little sense to
query Index Fungorum or IPNI for an animal name (especially as this will could 1–2 seconds onto the time taken
to complete the search). An option to select the databases
to query could be easily added to the TSE web interface.
However, it would be more efficient if the TSE could determine which databases were relevant to the user's query. If
the TSE knew that the query string was the name of a fungus, it could send the query to the appropriate database.
In practice, however, this is problematic. In order to know
what organism a name refers to the TSE would have to
have access to a databases of names and their classification – the very lack of such a database is the motivation
behind the TSE in the first place. Furthermore, as discussed above, the same name can apply to different organisms. A user searching using the term "Morus" might be
looking for a plant name, or an animal name (or perhaps
both). There is some scope for more intelligent querying,
such as looking for aspects of the name that are specific to
one of the codes of nomenclature (e.g., most plant family

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/48

names end in "-aceae"), but any such effort needs to be
done with care – for example, "Compositae" is a family of
plants.

Conclusion
The Taxonomic Search Engine is a simple tool for querying multiple taxonomic databases. Typically, results of
querying five major databases are returned in a few seconds. In addition to providing basic information about a
name, the TSE acts as a LSID authority, providing globally
unique identifiers for each name. The TSE provides a simple demonstration of the potential of the federated
approach to providing access to taxonomic names.

Availability and requirements
The source code for the TSE, the web site, and the LSID
authorities is available from the TSE site http://dar
win.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/portal/.
System requirements
TSE requires a web server and the PHP scripting language.
It has been developed and tested under Red Hat Linux 8.0
with the Apache web server version 2.0.40 and PHP version 4.2.2, and Mac OS X 10.2.8 with Apache version
1.3.29 and PHP version 4.3.4. If PHP does not have the
XSLT extension enabled then the user will either have to
recompile PHP, or install the Sablotron toolkit [35]. The
code makes use of various PHP libraries including
NuSOAP [29], Net HTTP Client [28], Php.XPath [36], and
phpdomxml [37]. The approximate string matching feature requires agrep to be installed (available from ftp://
ftp.cs.arizona.edu/agrep/), and a developer key from
Google [31].
