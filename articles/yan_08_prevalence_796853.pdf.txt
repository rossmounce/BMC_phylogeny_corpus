Abstract
Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen of which swine was reported as
major reservoirs. HEV has been divided into 4 different genotypes according to phylogenetic
analysis. Recent reports showed that genotype 4 HEV is freely transmitted between humans and
swine in eastern China, including Shanghai area. This paper investigated the recent infection status
of HEV among swine population of Shanghai area in China.
Methods: 480 swine faecal specimens were collected from 23 farms which distribute all over
Shanghai from September to November, 2007 and tested for the presence of HEV RNA by the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Results: Our results showed that 26.1% (6/23) of the swine farms were positive for HEV RNA and
the positive rate of the six farms were ranged from 9.1% to 33.3%. The HEV RNA positive rate for
total samples were 5% (24/480). The resulted positive band specific for HEV was sequenced and
sequence analysis indicated that all of these isolates belonged to genotype 4 HEV. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that the 24 isolates clustered into 4 distinct subgroups, sharing 83.3–89.7% intersubgroup and 97–99% intra-subgroup identities. More over, isolates in three of the four subgroups
closely clustered with previous identified strains, sharing up high to 97% identity with them.
Conclusion: These results suggested that there were 4 different subgenotypes of HEV prevalent
in Shanghai, and some of them may not be indigenous to Shanghai but introduced from other
geographic regions.

Background
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a member of the genus Hepevirus, is a non- enveloped virus with a positives- stranded
RNA genome approximately7.2 kb in length [1]. HEV has
been proven to transmit by the faecal- oral route, and outbreaks of hepatitis E are attributed to water contaminated
with HEV. HEV and antibodies to HEV have been reportedly found in a wide variety of animals, especially swine

[2-5]. A hypothesis has arisen that zoonosis is involved in
the transmission of HEV, especially for the cases in nonendemic areas. Recently, more direct evidences for
zoonotic HEV transmission were reported [6]
The first animal strain of HEV, designated swine HEV, to
be isolated and characterized was obtained from a pig in
the United States [7]. Subsequently, many HEV samples

from swine in over a dozen countries have been identified. HEV isolates were divided into four distinct genotypes according to sequence and phylogenetic analyses.
Genotype 1 was previously believed to only infect
humans, but reportedly detected from a pig in Cambodia
recently [8]. Genotype 2 has only been identified in
humans in Mexico and Africa (Nigeria, Chad). Genotype
3 is prevalent in swine herds and humans all over the
world and Chinese genotype 3 HEV was first discovered in
eastern China in 2006 [9]. Genotype 4 HEV was first
detected in humans in 1993 [10] and is mainly distributed in China, Japan, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Genotype 4 HEV has a wide host range, being prevalent in
humans, swine, and some other animals. These four genotypes of virus are thought to comprise a single serotype
[11]. Hepatitis E was first recognised in China after a large
epidemic in the south part of Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region [12]. Since 2000, Genotype 4 HEV has
become the dominant cause of hepatitis E disease in
China [13]. A recent report showed that genotype 4 HEV
is freely transmitted between humans and swine in eastern China [14]. In the present study, we tested the 480 faecal samples collected from 23 commercial pig farms in
Shanghai area of China for HEV RNA in order to investigate the current status of HEV prevalence in the swine
population.

Materials and methods
Samples
480 swine faecal specimens were obtained from 23 swine
farms in swine- farming districts of Shanghai city in China
from September to November, 2007. The sampling sites
were marked as black point in figure 1, a map of Shanghai.
All the swine sampled from were 2–4 months old. Specimens were carefully collected to avoid any contamination. All the samples were converted to 10% (w/v)
suspensions in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.2–7.4) immediately
following the sampling. These samples were shipped, frozen, to our laboratory and stored at – 80°C prior to analysis.
Nucleic acid extraction and designing of PCR primers
Faecal sample suspensions were clarified by centrifugation at 5000 g for 45 min, and 100 μl aliquot of the clarified material was used for viral RNA extraction. Total RNA
was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) in
accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA
was finally dissolved in 20 μl RNase- free water. The primers used for HEV sequence amplification in this study
were those previously described in reference [15]. The
primers were HEV1 [forward primer; 5'-AATTATGCC(T)CAGTAC(T)CGG(A)GTTG-3'] and HEV2 [reverse
primer; 5'-CCCTTA(G)TCC(T)TGCTGA(C)GCATTCTC3'] for the first round of PCR and HEV3 [forward primer;
5'-GTT(A)ATGCTT(C)TGCATA(T)CATGGCT-3']
and

http://www.actavetscand.com/content/50/1/12

HEV4 [reverse primer; 5'-AGCCGACGAAATCAATTCTGTC-3'] for the second round. This set of primers was
designed to produce a 348- nt segment of open reading
frame (ORF) 2, and were capable of detecting all four
known HEV genotypes. Letters in parentheses indicate
degenerate bases.
RT- PCR and nested PCR
Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT- PCR) was performed by
using TaKaRa RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa, Japan) according
with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 μl of RNA
solution was analyzed by RT-PCR, plus 2 μl 25 mM
Mg2+,1 μl 10 × RT buffer, 1 μl 10 mM (each) dNTP, 20
pmol reverse primer (primer HEV4), 10 U of RNase inhibitor, and 2.5 U of AMV Reverse Transcriptase XL in a total
volume of 10 μl. After incubation for 30 min at 42°C, the
mixture was incubated for 5 min at 99°C to denature the
products and then chilled on ice. 10 μl of the resulting
cDNA was amplified by the universal RT- PCR assay using
PerfectShot Taq (Loading dye Mix) DNA polymerase
(TaKaRa, Japan). Briefly, RT- PCR was conducted in a total
volume of 50 μl, containing 10 ul cDNA solution, 25 ul
Loading dye Mix and 25 pmol both sense primer and antisense primer. The PCR parameters for the first- round PCR
included a denaturation step at 95°C for 9 min, followed
by 39 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94°C, annealing
for 1 min at 42°C, extension for 2 min at 72°C, and a
final incubation at 72°C for 7 min. 10 ul products of firstround PCR were used as template for the second-round
PCR. The parameters for the second- round PCR were similar to the first-round.
Nucleotide sequencing
The nested PCR products were analyzed in a 1.5% agarose
gel containing 0.5 ug/mL ethidium bromide. The
expected DNA band specific for the HEV was excised from
the gel, purified with the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction kit
(Axygen, USA) and cloned into pMD T- Vector (TaKaRa,
Japan). Both strands of the inserted DNA amplicons were
sequenced in a DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems 3730
DNA Analyzer; Invitrogen, USA).

Standard precautions were used for all procedures to
reduce the possibility of sample contamination by amplified DNA molecules. A faecal specimen from a pig
infected with swine genotype 4 HEV was used as positive
control. PBS instead of faecal suspension, and water
instead of RNA samples or cDNA template were used as
negative controls in the nucleic acid extraction and RTPCR, respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned using ClustaX v1.8 or MegAlign
program in the DNASTAR software package. Phylogenetic
analysis was constructed using the Mega 4 software [16].

Result
Occurrence of HEV
Table 1 shows the results of detection of HEV-RNA in faecal samples from HEV positive farms. Six out of
23(26.1%) farms from which we sampled were tested
positive for HEV. Among the 6 farms, the HEV positive
rate of faecal samples ranged from 9.1% to 33.3%. Figure
1 shows the six sites of the HEV positive farms (marked
with Arabic numeral 1–6) and the HEV positive rate of

each farm (indicated in the bracket). The overall HEV positive rate for all the samples was 5% (24/480).
Phylogenetic analysis
The PCR- amplified products of 24 isolates were
sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using
the sequence alignments of these isolates and the references. Figure 1 is the phylogenetic tree constructed based
on the 24 isolates in this study and the references by using
Mega 4.0 software. Result showed that the isolates we
determined all belonged to genotype 4 HEV and they cluster into four different subgroups. The four subgroups clustered closely with previously identified isolates:
AY596311 (Xinjiang, Western China), AJ344192 (Beijing,
Northern China), AB220978 (Japan), and DQ450079
(Xinjiang, Western China), respectively. Figure 3 is the

sequences of strains in each subgroup. From the phylogenetic tree, we can see that the phylogenetic relation among
the 4 subgroups showed in figure 3 was identical to that
of figure 2.
Divergence and percent identity
The identity among isolates we determined in each subgroup and their closely related strains referenced from
GenBank were analyzed. Result showed that intra-subgroup identities of the four subgroups were ranged from
97% to 99%. The identities between the four subgroups
and the closely clustered previous strains were 92%
(subgroup1 to AY596311), 97% (subgroup 2 to
AJ344192), 92–97% (subgroup 3 to AB220978), and
97% (subgroup 4 to DQ450079), respectively. The source
sites of the 4 subgroups are shown in figure 1(marked
with Roman number in bracket). We can see that subgroup I contains the strains identified in farm 2 and 3, and
subgroup III includes the strains found in farm 4 and 5,
and the strains in each of the two subgroups have high
nucleotide sequence homology (97–99%), suggesting
these strains from each two farms were from a common
source of infection. Table 2 showed the percent identity
and divergence among the 4 subgroups. The identity and
divergence among the four subgroups were ranged from
83.3–89.7% and 12.4–19.6, respectively. The overall
mean distance for the 4 subgroups was 0.159.

Sequence alignment
The consensus nucleotide sequence of each subgroup and
the coding amino-acid sequences were aligned using
DNAstar software. The results indicated that though the 4
subgroups showed high diversity on the nucleotide level
(22.7% of the nucleotide sites have base substitution),
they were very conservative on the amino-acid level, only
having two sites (1.8%) of amino-acid replacement.
Because these sequences are part of the ORF2 region
encoding a capsid protein of HEV virions, the conservation probably contributes to the same serotype of these
strains.

Discussion
Accumulated evidence indicates that HEV infection is a
zoonosis which involves various animal reservoirs. Pigs
stand out as being an animal group with the highest positive rate for HEV RNA, where the isolates were shown to
be closely associated with those from humans [17-20].
Among the 4 distinct genotypes, genotype 4 has been
dominant in China [13]. Recently, genotype 4 HEV was
reported to be widely distributed in humans and swine in
Eastern China [14], including Shanghai. In the present
study, 24 genotype 4 HEV isolates were detected in 480
pigs in Shanghai of China, which were phylogenetically
divided into four different subgroups, and the isolates in
subgroup 2, and subgroup 3 shared 97% and 92–97%
identity with two human isolates, AJ344192 and
AB220978, respectively. The two human isolates were
from Beijing of China and Japan, respectively [21,22],
which are geographically significantly far from Shanghai.
Therefore, we speculated that this may owe to the
traveling of humans who were infected with these virus, or
trading pigs which carrying these virus.

Swine HEV isolates identified from the same geographic
region tended to cluster together [23], and this point was
confirmed by some recent studies [24,25]. In the present
study, the determined 24 isolates were from 6 different
farms in the same geographic region, and these strains
phylogenetically clustered into genotype 4 group and
formed 4 different subgroups, sharing 83.3–89.7% intersubgroup and 98–99% intra-subgroup identity. This
rather low inter-subgroup nucleotide sequence homology
among the strains suggested that these Shanghai swine
HEV strains represents four distinct variants among the
genotype 4 isolates and the HEV prevalence in Shanghai
swine is complicated. Phylogenetic analysis also showed
that three of the 4 subgroups had closely clustered with
three previously identified strains isolated in different
regions even countries, sharing up high to 97% identity
with them. This suggested that some the HEV strains prevalent in Shanghai swine populations were not Shanghaiindigenous.
Shanghai lies in the most southern eastern part of China.
It is one of the most developed and open cities and has the
largest number of trading activities in China. Some evidences indicate that 60% of pigs consumed in Shanghai
were imported from other regions of China. Shanghai had
history of introducing different species of excellent
domestic pigs from other regions of China and even
abroad for commercial raising. Therefore, we cannot rule
out the possibility of an outside source for some of the
isolates in the four different subgroups in the present
study: they may spread unnoticedly among pigs and
humans through pigs trading or people traveling, as suggested in Taiwan and Japan [26,27]. With the increasing of
HEV strains, one can look at reasonably comprehensive
collection of international strains for phylogenetic analysis to elucidate the impact of pig trading and humans
traveling, and clearly clarify the issues in the future.

Although HEV of different genotypes are genetically very
heterogenic on nucleotide level, some universal primers
were designed which can detect HEV strains from all four
known genotypes [15,28]. This set of RT-PCR primers
used here belong to one of them and were used in many
previously studies. In this study, positive control were
added through out experiments and the HEV isolates we
determined using this set of primers all belonged to genotype 4 HEV, without genotype 3 isolates. This was contrast
to the study results of Ning [9] and our previous data
(unpublished), which showed genotype 3 HEV strains
existed in Shanghai of China, based on detection of swine
serum or faecal specimens collected before 2006. Different sampling site and time may contribute to this point. A
definitive conclusion for this issue should be drawn by
more research data.

Conclusion
The genotype 4 HEV isolates prevalent in swine populations in Shanghai area can be divided into 4 subgenotypes
and the sequence identities among them ranged from
83.3% to 89.7%. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the
4 subgenotypes closely clustered with 4 previously identified stains from other different geographic regions, respectively, suggesting that some of the HEV isolates may not
be indigenous to Shanghai.

Authors' contributions
All authors participated in the planning of the project. XH
was the leader of the project. YY and WZ collected all samples and performed the detecting experiments for HEV
RNA. WZ and QS done the phylogenetic analysis. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Acknowledgements
Our results suggested the strains that from farm 2 and 3,
and that from farm 4 and 5 were from a common source
of infection, respectively, sharing relatively high identity
(97–99%). Moreover, farm 2 and 4 are near from farm 3
and 5, respectively (figure 1). This may imply HEV can
transmit from one farm to the farm nearby through a certain route, such as faecal contamination and people
movement, suggesting that the feaces of pig need to be
treated under strict conditions and people's movement
between pig farms should be well controlled. Although
farm 2 and 3 have HEV strains clustered closely in the
same subgroup prevalent and are geographically near, the
HEV positive rate of them are relatively different (33.3%
and 9.1%). This may be caused by non-viral factors, such
as sanitary conditions, hosts, facilities, or type of farming.
