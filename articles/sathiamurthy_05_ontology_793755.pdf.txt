Abstract
Background: Epitopes can be defined as the molecular structures bound by specific receptors,
which are recognized during immune responses. The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis
Resource (IEDB) project will catalog and organize information regarding antibody and T cell
epitopes from infectious pathogens, experimental antigens and self-antigens, with a priority on
NIAID Category A-C pathogens (http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm) and
emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. Both intrinsic structural and phylogenetic features, as
well as information relating to the interactions of the epitopes with the host's immune system will
be catalogued.
Description: To effectively represent and communicate the information related to immune
epitopes, a formal ontology was developed. The semantics of the epitope domain and related
concepts were captured as a hierarchy of classes, which represent the general and specialized
relationships between the various concepts. A complete listing of classes and their properties can
be found at http://www.immuneepitope.org/ontology/index.html.
Conclusion: The IEDB's ontology is the first ontology specifically designed to capture both
intrinsic chemical and biochemical information relating to immune epitopes with information
relating to the interaction of these structures with molecules derived from the host immune
system. We anticipate that the development of this type of ontology and associated databases will
facilitate rigorous description of data related to immune epitopes, and might ultimately lead to
completely new methods for describing and modeling immune responses.

Background
An epitope can be defined as the molecular structure recognized by the products of immune responses. According
to this definition, epitopes are the specific molecular entities engaged in binding to antibody molecules or specific
T cell receptors. An extended definition also includes the
specific molecules binding in the peptide binding sites of
MHC receptors. We have previously described [1] the general design of the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis
Resource (IEDB), a broad program recently initiated by
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID). The overall goal of the IEDB is to catalog and
organize a large body of information regarding antibody
and T cell epitopes from infectious pathogens and other
sources [2]. Priority will be placed on NIAID Category AC pathogens (http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/
bandc_priority.htm) and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. Epitopes of human and non-human primates, rodents, and other species for which detailed
information is available will be included. It is envisioned
that this new effort will catalyze the development of new
methods to predict and model immune responses, will
aid in the discovery and development of new vaccines and
diagnostics, and will assist in basic immunological
investigations.
The IEDB will catalog structural and phylogenetic information about epitopes, information about their capacity
to bind to specific receptors (i.e. MHC, TCR, BCR, Antibodies), as well as the type of immune response observed
following engagement of the receptors (RFP-NIH-NIAIDDAIT-03/31: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract/archive/
rfp0331.pdf).
In broad terms, the database will contain two general categories of data and information associated with immune
epitopes – intrinsic and extrinsic (context-dependent
data). Intrinsic features of an epitope are those characteristics that can be unequivocally defined and are specified
within the epitope sequence/structure itself. Examples of
intrinsic features are the epitope's sequence, structural features, and binding interactions with other immune system
molecules. To describe an immune response associated
with a specific epitope, context information also needs to
be taken into account. Contextual information includes,
for example, the species of the host, the route and dose of
immunization, the health status and genetic makeup of
the host, and the presence of adjuvants. In this respect, the
IEDB project transcends the strict boundaries of database
development and reaches into a systems biology application, attempting for the first time to integrate structural
information about epitopes with comprehensive details
describing their complex interaction with the immune
system of the host, be it an infected organism or a vaccine
recipient [1-3].

http://www.immunome-research.com/content/1/1/2

For these reasons, it was apparent at the outset of the
project that it was crucial to develop a rigorous conceptual
framework to represent the knowledge related to the
epitopes. Such a framework was key to sharing information and ideas among developers, scientists, and potential
users, and to allowing the design of an effective logical
structure of the database itself. Accordingly, we decided to
develop a formal ontology. Over the years, the term
"ontology" has been defined and utilized in many ways
by the knowledge engineering community [4]. We will
adopt the definition of "ontology" as "the explicit formal
specifications of the terms in a domain and the relationships among them" [5]. According to Noy and McGuinness [6], "ontology defines a common vocabulary for
researchers who need to share information in a domain
and helps separate domain knowledge from operational
knowledge". Thus, availability of a formal ontology is relevant in designing a database, in cataloging the information, in communicating the database structure to
researchers, developers and users, and in integrating multiple database schema designs and applications.
Several existing databases catalog epitope related data. We
gratefully acknowledge that we have been able use these
previous experiences in the design and implementation of
the IEDB. MHCPEP [7], SYFPEITHI [8], FIMM [9], HLA
Ligand Database [10], HIV Immunology Database [11],
JenPep [12], AntiJen [13], and MHCBN [14] are all publicly available epitope related databases. In general, these
databases provide information relating to epitopes, but
do not catalog in-depth information relating to their
interactions with the host's immune system. It should also
be noted that none of these databases has published a formal ontology, but all of them rely on informal or implicit
ontologies. We have taken into account as much as possible these ontologies, inferring their structure by informal
communications with database developers or perusal of
the databases websites.
The ontology developed for IEDB and described herein
complements two explicit ontologies that are presently
available: the IMGT-Ontology and the Gene Ontology
(GO). The IMGT-Ontology [15] was created for the international ImMunoGeneTics Database (IMGT), which is an
integrated database specializing in antigen receptors
(immunoglobulin and T Cell receptors) and MHC molecules of all vertebrate species. This is, to the best of our
knowledge, the first ontology in the domain of immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. The GO project [16]
provides structured, controlled vocabularies that cover
several domains of molecular and cellular biology. GO
provides an excellent framework for genes, gene products,
and their sequences, but it does not address the specific
epitope substructure of the gene products. The IMGT provides an excellent ontological framework for the immune

receptors but lacks information relating to the epitopes
themselves. Therefore it was necessary to expand the available ontologies and to create an ontology specifically
designed to represent the information of immune receptor interaction with immune epitopes. Wherever possible,
the IEDB ontology conforms to standard vocabularies for
capturing values for certain fields. For capturing disease
names, IEDB uses the International Classification for Diseases (ICD-10) [17]. The NCBI Taxonomy database
nomenclature [18,19] is used to capture species and strain
names, and HLA Allele names are consistent with the HLA
nomenclature reports [20].

the generalization and specialization relationships
between the various classes of objects in a domain [6].
Briefly, classes describe concepts in the domain. Subclasses represent concepts (classes) that are more specific
than the superclass and these subclasses can have their
own unique properties. Slots represent properties of the
classes. For example, in Figure 1, we see that there is a class
named Reference and three more specific subclasses of
Reference: Journal Article, Patent Application, and Direct
Submission. Figure 1 also shows that the class Epitope has
a number of properties (slots) associated with it such as
"has Epitope Structure" and "has Epitope Source".

Construction and Content

The IEDB Ontology: Reference, Epitope Structure,
Epitope Source, and Assay Information classes
Our approach for creating the class hierarchy was a topdown development process where we defined each class
in a domain and then identified its properties before
building the hierarchy. The main classes identified for
IEDB are Reference, Epitope Structure, Epitope Source,
MHC Binding, Naturally Processed Ligand, T Cell
Response, and B Cell Response (Figure 1). The Epitope
class is the main class that encompasses all the individual
concepts that were identified. The individual concepts are
related to other classes. The primary relationships use the
sub-class relationship or use a property (shown in the figures by the arcs labeled "has") that has a restriction on the
type of the value that may fill that slot.

The IEDB is being developed as a web-accessible database
using Oracle 10g and Enterprise Java (J2EE). Industry
standard software design has been followed and it is
expected that IEDB will be available for public users by the
end of 2005.
Protégé http://protege.stanford.edu was used to design
and document the IEDB ontology. Protégé is a free, open
source ontology editor and knowledge-base framework,
written in Java. It provides an environment for creating
ontologies and the terms used in those ontologies. Protégé supports class, slot, and instance creation, allowing
users to specify relationships between appropriate entities. Two features that IEDB ontology effort used extensively were Protégé's support for creating ontology terms
and for viewing the term hierarchies and the definitions.
The support for a central repository on ontologies, along
with browsing support, is key in reviewing and reusing
ontologies.
While there are several open source tools available [21]
for developing ontologies, we selected Protégé because of
its extensibility to a variety of plug-ins that are readily
available for integration. It also has the ability to export to
different formats including the Ontology Web Language
(OWL) (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/), which
allows interoperability with other ontologies.
We have previously described some of the general concepts relating to the IEDB design [1,2]. More information
relating to various aspects of the project can be accessed at
http://www.immuneepitope.org/. Herein, we report a
detailed description of the novel aspects of the IEDB
ontology. In designing our application architecture, we
have followed the common system engineering practice of
first determining the scope and nature of the data
involved. A first essential step is to understand the semantics of the domain and to capture that knowledge in an
agreed-upon format. Arranging the domain concepts in a
taxonomy is one of the initial organizing steps in the
ontology design process. The class hierarchy represents

"Reference" is the class encompassing information related
to the data source from which an epitope and its related
information are extracted into the IEDB. We have identified three broad subclasses of References that describe
where epitope information will be obtained. They are
Journal Article, Patent Application, and Direct Submission. The complete listing of slots (fields) encompassed
by the Journal Article, Patent Application, and Submission classes are provided in Figure 2. The Journal Article
class refers to manuscripts published in peer-reviewed
journals. The Patent Application class captures all the reference fields for a patent application that contain epitope
information. The Submission class captures information
about sources that contribute data to the IEDB directly.
Data deposited by the Large Scale Antibody and T Cell
Epitope Discovery contracts [3] and those transferred
from other websites fall into this class.
The Epitope Structure and Epitope Source classes capture
intrinsic features of an epitope. The Epitope Structure class
captures the physical and chemical features of an epitope.
Virtually any molecular structure may provoke an
immune response, such as proteins, carbohydrates, DNA,
and lipids. In the Epitope Structure class, structural information relating to linear sequences and 2-D structures of
the epitope, if available, are catalogued. The Epitope

Source class captures the phylogenetic source of an
epitope, including species of origin, gene name, protein
name, and links to other databases for more detailed
information about proteins and genes. Figures 3A and 3B
show the listings of properties (slots/fields) encompassing the Epitope Structure and Epitope Source classes.
The experimental data and information about specific
experiments and the methodology utilized are captured in
the Assay Information class. The name of the assay used,
the type of response measured in the assay, and the readout of the assay are examples of information captured in
the Assay Information class. This important class is used
as a superclass of several other classes (and thus its properties are inherited by those classes). A complete listing
the properties (slots/fields) in the Assay Information class
is shown in Figure 3C.
Immunization, Antigen, and Antigen Presenting Cell classes
As with Assay Information, the classes Immunization,
Antigen, and Antigen Presenting Cell are used in multiple
other class descriptions. Features relating to the induction
of the immune response are captured in the Immunization class (Figure 4A). It has relationships to other classes
like Immunized Species, Immunogen, In vivo Immunization, and In vitro Immunization. Immunized Species contains information relating to the host that is being
immunized. The Immunogen class describes the molecules that induce the immune response and an associated
carrier molecule, if present. Features relating to how the

immunogen was introduced to the immunized species are
captured under the In vivo and In vitro Immunization
classes.
Similarly, antigens are defined as the whole molecules
that react with the products of an immune response (as
opposed to the epitopes which are the specific structures,
contained within the antigen that engages the immune
receptor). Information relating to the antigen and any
associated carrier molecule is captured in the Antigen class
(Figure 4B). During immune responses, antigen-presenting cells process antigens and present peptide epitopes
complexed with MHC molecules. This information is captured in the Antigen Presenting Cells class, which has a
relationship to the MHC Molecules and the Source Species classes (Figure 4C). The Source Species class describes
the species information from which the antigen presenting cells are derived.
The MHC Binding, Naturally Processed Ligand, T Cell
Response, and B Cell Response classes
The MHC Binding class captures the details relating to the
interaction of the epitope with specific MHC molecules
and information relating to the MHC molecule along with
any available Epitope-MHC complex structure details.
This class also has a slot that is restricted to be an instance
of the Assay Information class (Figure 5A).

Extrinsic features of an epitope are captured by Naturally
Processed Ligand, T Cell Response, and B Cell Response

classes. Extrinsic features are context-dependent
attributes, being dependent upon specific experimental
conditions. The Naturally Processed Ligand class captures
data related to epitopes that are naturally processed and
presented on the cell surface. This class has properties that
are instances of classes including Antigen Presenting Cell,
Antigen, and Assay Information (Figure 5B).
The Naturally Processed Ligand class differs from the
MHC Binding class in that information related to the antigen that was processed and the cell types in which the
processing occurred is represented. MHC Binding class
captures data relating to in vitro MHC binding assays,
which assess the epitope's binding capacity to the MHC
molecule. Hence the MHC Binding class does requires
neither the Antigen class not the Antigen Presenting Cells
class. In general, naturally processed ligands are assessed
in the absence of a T cell response, for example, identified

by direct elution from MHC molecules extracted from
infected cells or antigen presenting cells. Thus, the Immunization class is not used as a value restriction by the Naturally Processed Ligand class.
The T Cell Response class captures all of the T cell mediated immunity-related information (Figure 6A). It has
properties that are of type: Immunization, Effector Cells,
Antigen Presenting Cell, Antigen, Assay Information, and
Epitope-MHC-TCR Complex. The Effector Cell class
describes the cells that are elicited upon immunization
and that acquire measurable functions as a result. The B
Cell Response class describes antibody responses that are
related to the epitope (Figure 6B). This class has properties
that are of type: Immunization, Antibody Molecule, Antigen, Assay Information, and Antigen-Antibody Complex.
Because B cell responses do not require MHC binding and

antigen presenting cells, the respective classes related to
MHC Molecule and Antigen Presenting Cells are not used
as restrictions on properties of the B Cell Response class.
Classes capturing 3D structures
There are three classes that capture information about the
3D structure of complexes: Epitope-MHC Complex,
Epitope-MHC-TCR Complex, and Antigen-Antibody
Complex. The Epitope-MHC Complex, Epitope-MHCTCR Complex, and Antigen-Antibody Complex classes are
used as restrictions on properties of the MHC Binding, T
Cell Response, and B Cell Response classes respectively
(Figures 5A, 6A, and 6B). These Complex classes capture
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) Identifier, which provides
detailed information about 3D structures. The Protein
Data Bank [22,23] contains approximately 1600 3D structures that are of immunological interest. Other information that is not available in PDB, such as the atom pairs
that are involved in the interactions between molecules,
the specific residues, the contact area of the molecules,
and allosteric effect, is also captured here.
IEDB Class Hierarchy and Data Dictionary
Each class has numerous slots that capture detailed information associated with epitopes. As mentioned above, a
complete list of all the classes, their properties, and relationship, can be found at http://www.immuneep
itope.org/ontology/index.html. One of the files provided
as supplementary material contains two examples of how

two literature references [24,25] containing epitope information are extracted into the IEDB ontology (additional
file 1). Along with the class hierarchy, the IEDB's data dictionary (additional file 2) provides more detailed information about the fields that are defined for the IEDB. The
data dictionary contains a textual overview description
and a listing of fields that are required to be completed for
IEDB entries. The data dictionary also allows database
users to provide comments and suggestions to IEDB team
to enhance the formal ontology.

Utility and Discussion
The IEDB will be a comprehensive resource pertaining to
epitopes of the immune system. By extensively curating
both intrinsic and extrinsic features associated with
epitopes, the IEDB is expected to provide substantially
greater detail about specific epitopes than any other databases presently available. The IEDB will be populated
with data derived from three main sources, namely the
peer-reviewed literature, patent applications, and direct
submission. Epitope data published in the literature and
patent applications are curated manually by the IEDB's
curation team. Data from already existing epitope databases, whose authors have agreed to share their data, will
also be imported into the IEDB. Apart from these, a main
data source will be the direct submission of data from the
Large-scale Antibody and T Cell Epitope Discovery programs [3] that are funded by NIAID. Presently, fourteen
contracts have been awarded under this program, and all

of them will submit their data to the IEDB. Direct antibody and T cell epitope submissions will also be sought
from the broader research community, with an emphasis
on antibody epitopes to NIAID Category A-C pathogens.
Because of the large scale of the IEDB project, a formal
ontology is critical to ensure consistency in the representation of data.
Communication between database developers, researchers, analysis tool developers, and team members is crucial,
and can be performed in harmony only when a common
vocabulary is established. An ontology, which is an
explicit formal specification of the terms in the domain
and relationships among them, is an effective way to share
the knowledge contained in that domain. Accordingly,
since the IEDB's domain is epitope-related data, we have
created an ontology that captures detailed conceptual
structure related to these data.
The development of this ontology has relevance for the
expansion and modification of the epitope knowledge
base. Our ontology design defines individual concepts as

separate classes and then defined relationships between
these classes and other objects in the domain. These
classes serve to restrict the values that will describe
properties of objects in the database. For example, the
species is a separate concept defined in its own class.
Depending on the context, this can refer to an immunized
species or the species from which antigen presenting cells
are derived. Similarly MHC Molecules is defined as a separate class, and it is used as a value restriction by concepts
like MHC Binding and Antigen Presenting Cells. Defining
concepts as separate classes and using them to restrict the
values of properties in other classes facilitates the expansion and modification of our ontology. Adding properties
(slots) to concepts is a task easily accomplished when
there are well-defined class descriptions that may serve as
value restrictions on the properties, and providing that

these class descriptions are general enough to apply in all
instances. We have ensured in our design that each concept is atomic and that it can be re-used by various classes.
The development of a formal ontology is valuable to database users and in particular to scientists contributing data
to, and downloading data from, the IEDB. We anticipate
that the availability of a formal ontology will ensure that

a common language and shared understanding of concepts will inspire this type of communication, thus ensuring maximum efficiency and accuracy. The formal
ontology developed will most likely require refinement
and fine tuning when users provide suggestions and new
technologies for performing experiments are discovered.
The IEDB website will provide mechanisms for the users
to provide suggestions and participate in the enhance-

ment of the ontology. The IEDB Data Dictionary has a
separate column for the users to provide comments on
specific data fields. The IEDB website will also host web
forms that will guide users to conform to the ontology
definitions when submitting data. Apart from the web
forms, an XML schema definition (XSD) will be available
on the website for users to inspect and use in their data
submission. Users will also be able to download epitope
records from the website.

IEDB – Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource

In the process of developing new ontologies, it is good
practice to leverage existing community standards. In our
initial analysis, we confirmed that there were no explicit
ontologies that efficiently captured epitope details as per
the scope of the IEDB program. As mentioned above, we
have utilized, as much as possible, inferred ontologies
from existing epitope databases. Among the ontologies
that we analyzed, IMGT-Ontology and Gene Ontology
were the only two formal ontologies that were related to
the epitope domain. The IMGT-Ontology was designed
for the ImMunoGeneTics database. IMGT is an integrated
database specializing in antigen receptors (immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) and the major histocompatibility complex of all vertebrate species. The ontology
developed for this database has specific immunological
content, describing the classification and specification of
terms needed for immunogenetics. The IEDB does conform to IMGT's standards about receptors and MHC molecule chains in the sense that all the chain names follow
IMGT's controlled vocabulary.

GO provides structured controlled vocabularies for genes,
gene products, and sequences annotated for many organisms. The IEDB complements GO in terms of epitopes of
immunological interest since GO is incomplete in this
area. Antigens, which are primary sources of epitopes, are
annotated in GO. Thus, in essence, the IEDB could be utilized to provide an extension of GO for antigens that contain epitope-related information.

XSD – XML Schema Definition

Authors' contributions
MS generated the formal ontology using Protégé. MS, BP,
HB, JS, and AS designed the initial ontology. SW, JM, WF,
DM, PB provided critical insight in enhancing the initial
design and creating the formal ontology. All authors participated in the preparation of the manuscript.

Conclusion
Perhaps the most important element in the development
of the IEDB ontology is that, to the best of our knowledge,
this represents the first immunological ontology specifically designed to capture both intrinsic biochemical and
extrinsic context dependent information. In this respect, it
is similar in spirit, but different in approach, from other
knowledge resources relating to systems biology. We
anticipate that the development of this type of ontology
and associated databases might lead to completely new
methods for describing and modeling immune responses.
Accordingly, this new program might represent a novel
tool to assist in the design, testing, and development of
new ways to combat infectious diseases and other
