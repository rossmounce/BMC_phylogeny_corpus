Abstract
Background: The P-type II ATPase gene family encodes proteins with an important role in
adaptation of the cell to variation in external K+, Ca2+ and Na2+ concentrations. The presence of Ptype II gene subfamilies that are specific for certain kingdoms has been reported but was sometimes
contradicted by discovery of previously unknown homologous sequences in newly sequenced
genomes. Members of this gene family have been sampled in all of the fungal phyla except the
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; phylum Glomeromycota), which are known to play a key-role in
terrestrial ecosystems and to be genetically highly variable within populations. Here we used highly
degenerate primers on AMF genomic DNA to increase the sampling of fungal P-Type II ATPases
and to test previous predictions about their evolution. In parallel, homologous sequences of the Ptype II ATPases have been used to determine the nature and amount of polymorphism that is
present at these loci among isolates of Glomus intraradices harvested from the same field.
Results: In this study, four P-type II ATPase sub-families have been isolated from three AMF
species. We show that, contrary to previous predictions, P-type IIC ATPases are present in all basal
fungal taxa. Additionally, P-Type IIE ATPases should no longer be considered as exclusive to the
Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota, since we also demonstrate their presence in the Zygomycota.
Finally, a comparison of homologous sequences encoding P-type IID ATPases showed unexpectedly
that indel mutations among coding regions, as well as specific gene duplications occur among AMF
individuals within the same field.
Conclusion: On the basis of these results we suggest that the diversification of P-Type IIC and E
ATPases followed the diversification of the extant fungal phyla with independent events of gene
gains and losses. Consistent with recent findings on the human genome, but at a much smaller
geographic scale, we provided evidence that structural genomic changes, such as exonic indel
mutations and gene duplications are less rare than previously thought and that these also occur
within fungal populations.

Background
In nature, different types of efflux/influx systems have

evolved to maintain an osmotic equilibrium. These systems play a role in balancing any excessive entrance (or

exit) when elevated differences in cations' concentrations
are present between the surrounding and cellular environment. These systems are part of a gene super-family better
known as ion pumps or plasma membrane (P-type)
ATPases that evolved independently several times. Their
evolution led to five main gene families (Type I, II, III, IV
and V; [1]). P-type ATPases that share specificity for Ca2+,
K+ and Na+ group together in a single clade and are designated as P-Type II ATPases. At present, the nomenclature
of the P-Type II ATPases includes five sub-families (A, B,
C, D and E; also known as SERCA, PMCA, NK/HK, ENA
and ACU, respectively). These genes are known to play a
key role in the adaptation of the cells to variable environments, such as variations in the PH of the soil or in cations' concentrations.
The nomenclature of the P-type II ATPase sub-family has
been frequently altered in recent years. Many hypotheses
concerning P-type II ATPase evolution in the fungal kingdom have been proposed by increased genome sequencing efforts and the parallel findings of new members of
this gene family. The P-Type II ATPase gene family in the
kingdom Fungi is characterized by the presence of two
evolutionarily related sub-families, named P-type IIC and
IIE. The latter of these is exclusively found in fungi. P-Type
IIC ATPases encode ion pumps that play a role in the
exchange of sodium and potassium ions across the
plasma membrane, providing the energy for secondary
transport of various nutrients through the creation of an
electrochemical gradient [2]. These genes were thought for
many years to be harboured exclusively by animal cells [3]
but in the last decade several studies reported their presence in organisms that are not related to the Metazoa,
including a basal fungal taxa (Blastocladiella emersooni); [35]. To date, these genes have been exclusively isolated
from organisms that do not possess a cell wall in at least
one stage of their life cycle. Accordingly, these genes were
found to be absent from the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota; two main fungal phyla where all stages of the life
cycle possess a cell wall. In contrast, these two fungal
phyla were shown to harbour other ATPases mediating
high affinity potassium and sodium uptake. These newly
identified genes were phylogenetically related to P-TypeIIC ATPases but were divergent enough from the latter
sub-family to allow their description as a novel sub-family
(Type IIE) [6]. Together, these results were in agreement
with a prediction that P-Type IIC genes may only be found
in organisms without a cell wall, at least in one stage of
their life-cycle [7] and suggested a evolutionary scenario
in which fungi harbouring a wall made of chitin evolved
with divergent and specific potassium and sodium
exchange systems, the Type IIE genes.
From analyses of fossil records and the use of molecular
clocks on phylogenies it appears that the extant fungal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/21

phyla most likely diverged about one billion years ago [812]. Considering the long evolutionary history of these
organisms, clear predictions about the evolution of their
gene families should rest on comparative analyses of most
of their members. The lack of knowledge concerning the
presence or absence of P-Type II ATPase subfamilies in the
different fungal lineages could possibly lead to wrong or
simplistic predictions. Therefore, we may be far from having a conclusive view of the evolutionary history of this
sub-family within the Fungi and any effort aimed at sampling P-Type II ATPases from yet uncovered fungal phyla
is certainly warranted. At present, the sampling of P-type
II genes from fungal species have only been carried out on
four out of the five extant fungal phyla. P-type II ATPase
gene sequences have not yet been isolated from arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). This group of obligate symbiotic fungi has recently been erected to the status of a
phylum, the Glomeromycota [13]. AMF are an ecologically
important group of fungi, influencing plant nutrient
acquisition [14], providing a protective role against plant
pathogenic fungi [15] and determining plant diversity and
ecosystem productivity [16]. Furthermore, they are an
interesting phylum in which to study gene evolution.
Firstly, although these fungi are known to be present on
earth since the Devonian period [17], they show remarkably low morphological and species diversification. Secondly, they have been proposed to be multigenomic;
possessing genetically different nuclei in a common cytoplasm [18,19]. Finally, little is known about the positioning of this phylum within the fungal kingdom. The most
recent studies suggest that they could be a more basal phylum than previously thought [20,21]. Interestingly,
although AMF are important for plant growth and have
also an unusual genome organisation, sequence data
about these organisms encompasses only a very few coding genes. Overall, only a small number of gene families
that have arisen by gene duplication have previously been
isolated from AMF species [21,22]. The isolation of, as yet,
undiscovered gene families such as the P-Type II ATPase
would allow us to address fundamental questions about
the evolutionary history of these organisms. In particular,
to shed light on features of their evolution compared to
the other fungal phyla, from their positioning within the
fungal clade to the understanding of molecular evolution
of gene families within an entire kingdom.
Given that glomeromycotan species diversity is low, that
they possess an unusual genome organisation and they
are putative ancient asexuals, it would be interesting to
know how important gene families such as P-Type II
ATPases have evolved in this fungal phylum. To date,
almost all information on sequence differences in this
interesting fungal group comes from non-coding regions
of the genome. Furthermore, unexpectedly high genetic
variation has been recorded in a population of one AMF

species, Glomus intraradices [23]. However, this study used
markers that were probably neutral. Considerable withinAMF species genetic variability has also been recorded in
genes but, again, this was restricted to introns and no
selective importance could be inferred [24]. Therefore, a
study of variation in P-Type II ATPases within an AMF species or population could also reveal interesting genetic
variation in these putative exclusively clonal lineages.
The aims of this study were to isolate the P-type II ATPase
gene family from members of the fungal phylum Glomeromycota. Three AMF species belonging to genus Glomus
and cultured in vitro have been used here, as this culturing
system allows the researcher to handle a much higher
quantity and quality of DNA, which is necessary when
using cloning techniques such as PCR amplifications with
highly degenerate primers. In addition it greatly reduces
the probability of sequencing genes from contaminant
fungi, that has been a repeated technical problem with pot
cultured AMF [20]. The AMF sequence data was compared
with homologous sequences from other fungal phyla to
determine the evolutionary history of the P-type II subfamilies within the fungal kingdom. The successful amplification of the P-Type II ATPase genes from AMF also
allowed us to compare their genetic variability among isolates of Glomus intraradices of the same population and
previously reported as being highly divergent with respect
to neutral markers. The results presented in this study
show that the evolution of the P-Type II ATPase gene family in the fungi is more complex than previously thought.
In addition, an analysis of homologous sequences sampled among isolates of Glomus intraradices suggested that
the high genetic diversity reported using neutral markers
is also present when looking at protein encoding genes of
potentially high adaptive importance. Finally, we identified unexpected within population duplication events in
these important genes.

Results
Identification of P-Type II ATPase orthologs and paralogs
in AMF
For all the AMF species we investigated (Glomus intraradices DAOM 181602; Glomus diaphanum and Glomus proliferum), the PCR with degenerate primers always yielded
fragments of identical size and content when same the
combinations of primers were used. Most of the
sequences recovered showed highest similarities with PType II ATPases of fungal origin. Phylogenetic analysis of
those sequences with P-Type II ATPase genes of various
taxonomic origin showed that we successfully amplified
AMF genes from four of the five different sub-families
known to date (Fig. 1). The length, GC content and the
inter-specific genetic variability found in the coding
regions of these sequences are summarized in Table 3.
Comparisons among coding sequences showed that not

all members of the P-Type II gene family evolve similarly
in AMF (Table 3). Overall, P-type IIA sequences showed
less inter-specific variation (8%) compared to P-type IIC
and IID ATPases (11%). P-type IIB genes showed the highest genetic variability among exons (13%) and, interestingly, this was correlated with the number of nonsynonymous substitutions, which accumulated at a
higher frequency in these genes. Several indel mutations
were found among coding regions for both orthologs and
paralogs of AMF sequences we recovered. Indel mutations
were shown to vary in length from a minimum of six base
pairs among P-Type IIA sequences to a maximum of 24
base pairs as identified among paralogs of P-Type IIB
ATPases. Indel mutations neither led to a shift in the open

Through a first-strand cDNA synthesis from mRNA of
Glomus intraradices (DAOM 181602) and successive cloning procedures, we were able to identify the coding
regions of all the sequences we isolated from genomic
AMF DNA. This included identification of gene duplicates. This is direct evidence that all members of this gene

lysed in this study, only the Type IID sub-family was
expressed in sufficient amounts to allow the isolation of
the complete ORF through the RACE procedure. Sequence
analysis of the entire coding region of the P-type IID
ATPase gene showed that both gene duplicates share the
same number of introns and differ by several substitutions in their coding regions, as well as the presence of two
indel mutations (Fig. 2). Gene duplicates were named
ENA1 and ENA2 and encode proteins of 87.7 and 87.9
kDa, respectively, with eight predicted trans-membrane
domains.

For the P-Type IIC and D ATPases, several variants of the
same gene were isolated from Glomus intraradices and
Glomus diaphanum. In contrast, no intra-individual variation was found in Glomus proliferum. For the P-type IIB
subfamily, presence of gene duplicates was detected only
in Glomus intraradices (DAOM 181602) (Table 3). A phylogenetic analysis of gene variants based on synonymous
substitutions showed that all gene duplications identified
in this study have arisen relatively recently in AMF evolution (Fig. 3). Indeed, the duplication events took place
after the divergence of Glomus intraradices and Glomus
diaphanum from a common ancestor with Glomus proliferum. Southern blotting confirmed the duplicative status
of Type II B, C and D ATPases in Glomus intraradices, showing a banding pattern consistent with the number of variants we identified when a frequent cutting enzyme

and XbaI were used to digest genomic DNA the blotting
always resulted in a single band for all the genes we analysed (data not shown).
Evolution of fungal P-Type II ATPase sub-families
Phylogenetic analyses of P-type II ATPases were carried
out to detect the placement of the Phylum Glomeromycota
in comparison with the other fungal phyla (Ascomycota,
Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota), as well as
comparing molecular evolution among P-type II gene
sub-families (Fig 4). Independently from the genes we
analysed, the phylogenies always revealed a strongly supported clade, including only sequences of fungal origin.
Accordingly, the glomeromycotan sequences were shown
to be of fungal origin and to be monophyletic, including

all the paralogs. Moreover, the clustering among AMF species used in this study was consistent among phylogenies
and with other studies [20,21], thus rejecting the possibility of contaminant non-AMF sequences within our dataset.
Within the fungal clade, variation in the positioning of the
fungal phyla was found according to which genes we analysed. When sequences of the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota were available for phylogenetic analysis (Fig 4A,B
and 4D), their currently accepted evolutionary relationship was found [25-27], though only the P-type IIA genes
led to a support that was relatively high (Fig 4A). For the
P-Type IID gene sequences, the clustering of a Neurospora
crassa sequence with a member of the Basidiomycota has
been already documented [28]. The phylogenies based on
P-type II A and D resulted in AMF having higher similarities with members of the Zygomycota. In contrast, the phylogeny inferred with the P-type IIB sub-family members
placed the AMF species at a basal position in the fungal
clade.

The phylogeny of P-Type IIC ATPases also includes P-Type
IIE ATPases as both have been reported as being phylogenetically related [6]. As expected, the P-type II sub-families
formed highly supported clades. Two sequences we identified in the Rhizopus oryzae genome database were evolutionarily divergent and clustered in both of the main
clades, providing first evidence that both P-Type IIC and E
ATPases evolved in members of the Zygomycota. The
sequences we identified from AMF showed highest
sequence similarities with the Type IIC ATPases and clustered with one of the sequences from Rhizopus oryzae. Ptype IIC ATPases of fungal origin grouped together with
high bootstrap support, leading to a lineage that evolved
independently from animal-like P-type IIC ATPases.
Genetic variability and relative copy number of type IID
ATPases among isolates of Glomus intraradices
In this study, P-Type II ATPase genes were also identified
in two additional isolates of Glomus intraradices (C2 and
C3) that were harvested from the same field and shown to
be highly divergent using neutral markers [23]. We were,

therefore, able to detect genetic variability that is present
in adaptively important genes among isolates of the same
AMF species. Sequencing efforts showed that P-Type IIA, B
and C ATPases harbour a small number of nucleotide polymorphisms among these isolates and, overall, only single substitutions have been recovered among their coding
regions and introns. Additionally, the number of gene
duplicates we recovered was always consistent among the
isolates for these three gene sub-families (data not
shown).
In contrast, the level of genetic variability was much
higher among coding regions and introns of the P-Type
IID ATPases of the Glomus intraradices isolates (Fig 5A and
5B). Indeed, not only did these genes show the presence
of isolate-specific substitutions among exons and introns,

in addition, indel mutations among these regions were
also present. Two gene duplicates were recovered from the
isolate C3 and these were found as phylogenetically
related to those recovered from the isolate DAOM
181602. This suggests an origin through the same duplicative event, which preceded the divergence of Glomus
intraradices and Glomus diaphanum. However, but one of
these two paralogs (named C3-2) differed by the absence
of an indel mutation in its coding region (Fig 5A). In addition to the presence of variable indel mutations among
exons, another isolate, named C2 and which originated
from the same field as C3, was unexpectedly found to harbour three different genes encoding a P-Type IID ATPase.
Two of the variants were similar to the ones recovered
from the isolate DAOM 181602, but one (named C2-3)
differed from the others by the presence of two specific

indel mutations within one of its introns (Fig. 5B). This
additional gene variant was exclusively found in the isolate C3 through a PCR survey using a reverse primer partially overlapping one of its specific indel mutations (Fig.
5B).
The amplification and cloning approach provided a first
line of evidence suggesting that the number of genes
encoding Type IID ATPases may differ in their number
among isolates of Glomus intraradices. Although it would
be unlikely that we missed an additional variant in the
isolates DAOM 181602 and C3 by using highly degenerate primers as well providing an in-deep sequencing
effort, the absence of a third unidentified variant in the
isolates DAOM 181602 and C3 could not be ruled out
conclusively. To test whether the isolates of Glomus intra-

radices shared the same copy number of these genes, we
performed a relative quantification of the different genes
using two sets of primers and probes, as well as using
material originating from two independent DNA extractions of all isolates (Fig 6A and 6B). The two sets of primers and probes resulted in very similar results regarding
the relative copy number of the target genes and showed
that, for a given amount of genomic DNA, the isolate C2
always harboured a larger relative number of copies for
the genes encoding a P-Type IID ATPase. The difference in
the relative number of the target gene was reproducible
with respect to the primer combinations and the independent DNA extraction. On average, the isolate C2 harboured approximately 48.5% more copies (StDev = 5.7)
of P-Type IID ATPase genes compared to the isolates
DAOM 181602 and C3 for the same amount of genomic

show any significant difference in their relative copy
number and, therefore, it appears that both possess a
same number of genes encoding P-Type IID ATPases.

Discussion
P-Type II C and E ATPases evolved in basal fungal phyla
Previous studies aimed at isolating and phylogenetically
analysing P-type II ATPase genes showed that the P-type
IIC sub-family was only found in organisms without a cell
wall, in at least one stage of their life cycle. This was consistent with the finding of a P-Type IIC ATPase in the
chytrid fungus Blastocladiella emersooni [7]. In parallel the
Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota, fungal phyla that harbour a chitinous cell wall, were found to possess an independent but phylogenetically related sub-family named
P-type IIE [6]. The data were, therefore, consistent with a
simplistic prediction that a lineage of the P-Type II
ATPases evolved in fungi with a chitinous cell wall that
could fulfil similar osmotic challenges. Our study provided evidence for more complex trends in the evolution
of the P-Type II ATPase gene family in Fungi than previ-

ously thought. Sequences phylogenetically related to the
Type IIC sub-family have been isolated from species of the
Glomeromycota and identified in the Rhizopus oryzae (Zygomycota) genome database [29]. Within the P-Type IIC
clade, those sequences were related to genes isolated from
Blastocladiella emersooni (Chytridiomycota) and were shown
to form a strongly supported monophyletic group. Interestingly, this cluster was shown to evolve independently
from members of the same sub-family and most likely
correspond to a fungal specific lineage that arose early in
fungal evolution and evolved in all basal fungal phyla. As
a consequence, our data do not support the hypothesis
that these genes have arisen to fulfil the requests of an
organism lacking a cell wall. Indeed, the zygomycete Rhizopus oryzae possesses a cell wall in all known stages of its
life cycle and this is also the case for the Glomeromycota.
Additionally, according to a survey of nineteen completely sequenced genomes [29], the Ascomycota and the
Basidiomycota do not harbour these genes. Our data on the
presence of P-type IIC ATPases in the basal fungal phyla
(Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and Zygomycota), along
with their absence in the Ascomycota and the Basidiomy-

sub-family underwent evolution at conserved amino acid
motifs, thus impeding the amplification with degenerate
primers. At present, the two predictions cannot be confirmed but data from genome sequencing projects on
AMF [29] and chytrids will help in answering this question.

cota, indicates that these genes have been lost in lineages
leading to higher fungi.
In addition to the absence of P-Type IIC in the Ascomycota
and the Basidiomycota, our results show that the P-Type IIE
ATPases can no longer be considered as exclusive to the
Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota. Therefore, the presence
and evolution of the Type IIE ATPases in fungi can neither
be easily explained by the presence of a cell wall in a fungal organism nor by an exclusive evolution in the ascomycotan and basidiomycotan clade. We did not find any
evidence for the presence of such genes in the Chytridiomycota and the Glomeromycota. Even though several combinations of primers could potentially anneal to conserved
regions of fungal P-Type IIE ATPases, none of these led to
the amplification of an glomeromycotan sequence showing such homologies. Two predictions can be inferred
from the absence of a positive amplification of these genes
in the AMF species we studied: 1. Type IIE sub-family is
absent in glomeromycotan genomes or 2. Members of this

Structural genomic changes in a population of Glomus
intraradices
Indel mutations among coding regions and gene duplications have both been considered for many years as being
rare evolutionary events [31] sometimes leading to the
complete reappraisal of important phylogenetic questions
that previously relied on nucleotide substitutions patterns
[32]. In our study we showed that both of these supposedly rare events occur among AMF individuals of the same
species (Glomus intraradices), and even from the same
population. Indeed, the isolate C3 was shown to harbour
two paralogous sequences encoding P-Type IID ATPases,
one of which differed from the paralogs isolated in
DAOM 181602 by the absence of an indel mutation in the
coding region. To date, the presence of indel mutations
among AMF isolates was only reported for introns [24],
and no studies reported intra-population variation of this
nature in coding regions of genes with potential high ecological importance. As a consequence, the extensive intraisolate genetic variability previously found with assumed
neutral markers [23] does not only involve single substitutions, but also rare genomic changes that can potentially affect the function of genes.

In addition, our data showed that gene duplication events
occurred independently among isolates of Glomus intraradices from the same population. Lines of evidence coming from cloning and sequencing, targeted specific PCR,
Southern blotting and quantification of relative differences in copy number among isolates of Glomus intraradices strongly suggest that an additional duplicative event of
the P-type IID ATPase occurred independently in the isolate C2. The isolate C2 was found to harbour relatively
fifty percent more copies compared to other isolates. This
is exactly what we would expect if the isolate C2 would
harbour three copies of the gene due to additional gene
duplication. The finding that Glomus intraradices individuals do not share the same copy number for genes of potentially ecological importance is interesting, suggesting a
possible variation in the adaptation of these organisms to
variable environments and could explain, in part, the
intra-specific phenotypic variability recorded by others
[23].

Conclusion
The results presented in this study about fungal P-Type II
ATPases show that predictions about the evolution of
gene families should rely in the future on analyses includ-

ing a broad sampling of organisms for a given phylum.
Most of the gene families presumably originated early in
the evolution of eukaryotes and prokaryotes and followed
several events of gene gains or losses along distinct evolutionary lineages. Consequently, the analyses of gene families should require a broad sampling of taxa to avoid
biases in the phylogenetic results and simplistic predictions about their evolution. The addition of previously
unknown fungal P-type II ATPase gene sequences brought
new interesting insights about the evolution of the gene
family as a whole and showed the presence of new evolutionary sub-clades.

was placed in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube and disrupted
using a magnetic stirrer (Cenco instruments) and a microstirring bar for 10 min at 1200 rpm. DNA was then
extracted from the resulting suspensions using the
DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). DNA concentration was
estimated using a fluorimeter (Hoefer DyNA Quant 200)
and DNA quality was checked by migration of 150 ng
DNA on a 0.6 % TAE agarose gel after electrophoretic separation for 30 minutes at 8 V per cm. RNA was extracted
from freshly harvested mycelium by using the ToTALLY
RNA™ Kit (Ambion, UK) according to manufacturer's protocol.

The obligate symbiotic status of AMF and the evolutionary
processes we described in this study open exciting perspectives about the analysis of the P-type II ATPase gene
expression in fungal organisms and especially in AMF. By
isolating the putative entire family of P-Type II ATPases
from AMF species, we provided sequence data of use for
future studies in this direction.

Gene amplification and DNA cloning
A total of eight different degenerate primers were designed
for conserved regions of P-type II ATPases and are listed in
Table 1. Amplifications were carried out in a final volume
of 50 µl containing 1× PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 50
mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X 100, 0.2 mg/ml
BSA), 100 nM dNTP, 1 µM final concentration of each
degenerate primer, and 0.5 units of Accu-prime™ polymerase (Invitrogen, Inc.). PCR was performed in an automated thermal cycler (T-gradient, Biometra) with an
initial denaturation step of 3 min at 94°C, followed by 35
cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94°C, annealing for 45 s
at 44°C and extension for 2 min at 72°C, followed by a
final extension for 10 min at 72°C.

Finally, it has to be noted that the genomic events we
reported as occurring among isolates of Glomus intraradices have been also recently reported as occurring among
individuals in humans [33,34] and, recently, have been
shown to be of high selective importance against diseases
[35,36]. Additionally, in the literature, we found other
evidence for a variation in gene copy number among isolates of Glomus intraradices, although, this was related to
ribosomal genes (25S rDNA) and not specifically discussed by the authors (Fig. 4a in [37]). In conclusion, it
appears that our results confirm the expectations that
genomic changes previously thought to occur rarely in the
evolution of organisms can be rather frequent. Indeed,
these events do not only appear among highly divergent
lineages but can also occur among highly related species
and individuals from the same population.

Methods
AMF cultivation, genomic DNA and RNA extraction
Isolates of Glomus intraradices DAOM 181602; C2 and C3,
(the latter two harvested from the same field in Switzerland and named according to [23]), Glomus diaphanum
(MUCL 43196), and Glomus proliferum (MUCL 41827)
were grown with Ri T-DNA transformed Daucus carrota
roots. These fungi were maintained on two-compartment
plates that allowed proliferation of large amounts of
hyphae and spores in a compartment that is free of roots
[38]. Roots that directed their growth to the fungal compartment were regularly cut to avoid contamination with
plant DNA. The cultures were grown for an average period
of 3 months at 25°C before DNA extraction. Spores and
hyphae were harvested by dissolving the medium in citric
acid [39]. Fungal material was collected on a 22 µm sieve
and used for DNA extraction. Freshly harvested mycelium

In order to detect coding regions of AMF P-Type II
ATPases, cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription
using the RevertAid™ Kit (MBI Fermentas) following the
manufacturer's instructions. One microliter of the resulting cDNA was amplified in a PCR using primer combinations listed in Table 1. The amplification was performed
in a final volume of 25 µl containing 1× PCR buffer (10
mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X
100, 0.2 mg/ml BSA), 100 nM dNTP, 0.5 µM final concentration of each primer, and 0.25 units of Accu-prime™
polymerase (Invitrogen, Inc.), in an automated thermal
cycler (T-gradient, Biometra) with an initial denaturation
step of 3 min at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94°C, annealing for 30 s at 58°C and
extension for 2 min at 72°C, followed by a final extension
for 7 min at 72°C. To obtain full-length cDNA fragments
of P-Type II ATPase genes, the partial cDNA fragments
were lengthened by the 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE) method by using the SMART-RACE™
Kit (Clontech) with the appropriate primers listed in
Table 1. RACE was only performed with total RNA isolated from Glomus intraradices (isolate DAOM 181602)
cultured in vitro.
Amplification products were electrophoretically separated
on 1.2 % agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and
the expected bands were excised from the gel and then

purified with a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen,
GmBH). PCR fragments were then cloned into the
pTZ57R/T vector (Mbi Fermentas GMBH), following the
manufacturer's instructions. Sequences were obtained
using M13 forward and reverse primers with the Big Dye
3.1 Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems),
according to the manufacturer's instructions, and separated on an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence analysis
Sequences were analysed using the Vector NTI package
(Informax. Inc, Oxford, U.K) and homology with genes
deposited in databases was conducted using BLAST [40].
Sequences were aligned using clustal W [41] and refined
by eye. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on amino
acid sequences was carried out using MEGA2 [42] and a
Poisson correction for multiple substitutions at a site.
Events of gene duplications between AMF genes were
assessed using a tree topology recovered from synonymous substitutions and with a K2P model, including only
sequences of the same sub-family and recovered from
AMF species used in this study. Neighbour-joining and
minimum evolution [43] genetic distances were calculated using MEGA2 for both nucleotide and amino acid
sequence data. For a phylogenetic analysis of the P-type
IIA gene sub-family, sequences of 381 amino acids were
available from the Zygomycota in gene databases. However, the resulting phylogeny did not support fungal
sequences as a natural monophyletic group (below 50%
bootstrap values). We, therefore, increased the phylogenetically informative data by recovering a longer zygomycotan gene sequence from the Rhizopus oryzae genome
database [29] and by performing a 3'-RACE with cDNA
from Glomus intraradices (isolate DAOM 181602). The
results allowed us to infer a phylogeny based on 568
amino acids, which strongly supported the Fungi as
monophyletic. Consequently, the resulting phylogeny
only includes a single sequence from the Glomeromycota
and the Zygomycota. All phylogenetic tree topologies were
assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates. Sequences belonging to Type-IID ATPases have been found to be absent
from the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota through a survey of nineteen completely sequenced genomes [29] and,
therefore, these two phyla are absent from the phylogeny
recovered using these genes. Accession numbers of amino
acid sequences and the list of taxa used in the phylogenetic analyses are provided in Table 2.

A total of twenty-two glomeromycotan sequences, including two complete open reading frames (ORFs), were
newly identified in this study and deposited in public
databases under accession numbers AM118102 to
AM118123.

Southern blot analysis
Southern blot analyses were performed in order to look at
most probable copy number of the P-Type II ATPases in
Glomus intraradices (DAOM 181602). Three µg of genomic
DNA extracted from Glomus intraradices (isolate DAOM
181602) were digested with each of the endonucleases
EcoRI, EcoRV and XbaI. The samples were fractionated on
a 1% agarose gel, and blotted onto a positively charged
nylon membrane (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to standard procedures. The membranes hybridised
overnight with digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled probes in an
appropriate hybridisation buffer (DIG Easy Hyb, Roche)
at 40°C. After hybridisation, the blot was washed twice in
2× SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and
twice in 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65°C for 15 min each
wash. Signals on the blot were detected by the chemiluminescent method using DIG Luminescent Detection
Kit (Roche) and exposed to X-ray film. The probes corresponding to P-Type-IIB, C and D ATPases were obtained
by PCR amplification using genomic DNA as template
with the same specific primers used in the reverse transcription PCR (Table 1).
Real-time PCR procedures
Real-time PCR was performed on the three Glomus intraradices isolates to compare relative copy number of the PType IIC ATPases among isolates. From the P-Type IID
ATPase sequences we obtained from the different Glomus
intraradices isolates (DAOM 181602, C2 and C3), we
designed two sets of primers that amplify a 200 bp and a
70 bp region fragment, respectively, and that annealed to
a region conserved among the variants we recovered. The
primer combinations and probes are listed in Table 1. In
a standard PCR, these primers were shown to amplify the
expected gene variants from the Glomus intraradices isolates. These probes were labelled with FAM at the 5' end
and TAMRA at the 3' end. In the real-time PCR reaction,
the fluorescence of the probe was measured at each cycle
at the annealing phase of the reaction. FAM-real-time PCR
amplification was performed in 40 ml containing 1X
qPCR Mastermix (Eurogentec), 0.5 µM each primer, 0.25
µM probe, and 10 µl DNA at different concentrations. The
thermal cycling conditions were an initial step of 50°C for
2 min and 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of
95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Fluorescence data were
collected using the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection
System (SDS; Applied Biosystems). The SDS software then
generated each real-time PCR profile after multi-component analysis by plotting the log of the change in fluorescence (delta Rn) versus cycle number. The cycle threshold
(Ct) was determined by the SDS software as the fractional
cycle number. This indicates where the fluorescence

DNA from the different isolates (ranging between 2000
and 16.5 pg) were included to generate Ct values. Four
independent experiments were performed, each with
eight concentrations of the genomic DNA. In half of the
experiments, the DNA of the Glomus intraradices isolates
was obtained from two independent extractions, thus
allowing the possibility of checking whether a bias
occurred in the Ct values because of DNA extraction procedures. All replicates offered very similar results and produced standard curves with regression coefficients (R2) >
0.99. The relative copy number of P-type IID genes in each
of the Glomus intraradices isolates could then be calculated
easily, by comparing the Ct values of each of the isolates
for a given amount of genomic DNA. Similar Ct values for
the same amount of genomic DNA would suggest the
same copy number of the target between the isolates and,
in contrast, differences in Ct values for a given amount of
DNA would suggest differences in the number of the target per genome in the different isolates of Glomus intraradices. The slopes resulting from the analyses of Ct values
respective to the Log of the amount of genomic DNA were
consistent and reproducible among isolates and the efficiency of the quantitative PCR reaction from genomic
DNA was found to be more than 90%.
