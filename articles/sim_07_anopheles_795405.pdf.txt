Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic and functional analysis was conducted on an Anopheles gambiae gene,
ENSANGG00000017398. Based on phylogenetic analysis, this gene belongs to the same lineage as
Heat shock protein cognate 70-4 (Hsc70-4) in Drosophila. Accordingly, we propose to name this
gene Heat shock protein cognate 70B (HSC70B). We previously reported that expression of
HSC70B and other genes including elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) and the agglutinin attachment
subunit (agglutinin) were up-regulated in o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV)-infected female An. gambiae.
Double-stranded RNA interferences have been applied to further investigate HSC70B, EF-1α and
the agglutinin functions in ONNV replication in An. gambiae.
Results: Among these three RNAi silenced genes, only dsRNAs of HSC70B (dsHSC70B)
promoted ONNV replication in adult An. gambiae compared to the control mosquitoes that were
co-injected with ONNV and dsRNA of β-galactosidase (dsβ-gal). ONNV titers from mosquitoes
co-injected with dsHSC70B were about 9-fold higher at 6 days post-injection (d.p.i.) as compared
to the control mosquitoes. By using ONNV tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein
(ONNV-eGFP), co-injection of ONNV-eGFP with dsHSC70B also showed approximately 2 ~ 3fold higher GFP expression rates than the controls in the head, thorax, and abdomen of the
mosquito. Furthermore, co-injection of ONNV with dsHSC70B significantly reduced the lifespan
of adult mosquitoes as compared with the control, co-injection of ONNV with dsβ-gal treated
mosquitoes.
Conclusion: These results indicate that HSC70B plays important roles in homeostasis and
suppression of ONNV replication in the vector, An. gambiae. Biological implications of these
findings are that while mosquitoes allow ONNV to replicate in them, they also check viral titers so
that ONNV infection will result in no harmful effect on mosquitoes. Therefore, mosquitoes can
function as vectors of ONNV transmission to humans while ONNV infection in An. gambiae
remains asymptomatic.

Background
The arbovirus, o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) belongs to
genus Alphavirus, and is an enveloped, single stranded,
(+) RNA virus with a genome of approximately 12 kb
[1,2]. Unlike other arboviruses, ONNV is primarily transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes such as Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus [3]. ONNV was first identified during
an epidemic in Uganda in 1959, which ultimately infected
over 2 million people across East Africa from 1959 to
1961 [4]. Recently it has reemerged in 1996 and 2003 sporadically in Africa [5,6].
Although mosquitoes are critical vectors in many arboviral transmission cycles, there is limited information on
how arboviruses influence mosquito gene expression and
how mosquito immune systems defend arthropod vectors
from deleterious consequences of viral infection. The
recent completion of the sequencing of the An. gambiae
genome has allowed us to investigate modulation of mosquito gene expression resulting from arbovirus infection.
Genome-wide screening of differentially expressed transcripts of ONNV-infected female An. gambiae relative to
naïve females was conducted at 14 day p.i. [7]. Seven
genes were identified for their differential expression in
ONNV-infected An. gambiae compared with controls by
cDNA microarrays followed by paired t-test and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The products of the
seven genes are seemingly involved in protein translation,
DNA replication, or intracellular transport pathways [1].
Among the seven candidates, HSC70B, EF-1α and agglutinin were chosen for further functional studies because of
their roles in protein folding, protein elongation, cell
adhesion, and cytoprotection, which are all important
molecular processes for viral replication.
We hypothesize that elevated gene expression of HSC70B
for example, may protect the mosquito cells from ONNVinduced molecular damage [8]. Since molecular chaperons including heat shock protein 70 families regulate protein folding and degradation, it is possible that HSC70B
may suppress the non-native viral structural or non-structural protein synthesis in mosquito cells. It was also
reported that mammalian and mosquito EF-1α binds to
the 3' UTRs of West Nile virus (WNV) and a range of RNA
viruses [9-12]. Thus, Anopheles EF-1α may have a similar
role for ONNV replication in An. gambiae. Lastly, agglutinin is a membrane attachment subunit that may interact
with ONNV on the membranes of endosomes and lysosomes. Because non-structural proteins and RNAs of
alphaviruses including ONNV are associated with the
membranes of modified endosomes and lysosomes in the
replication complex [13], agglutinin may therefore be
involve in a membrane attachment of the replication
complex of ONNV.

Based on these assumptions, HSC70B, EF-1α and agglutinin genes were subjected to a detailed functional analysis
for their potential involvement in ONNV replication.
Using RNAi, we post-transcriptionally silenced target transcripts of the three genes, HSC70B, EF-1α and agglutinin
by co-injecting dsRNAs of each target transcript with
ONNV into female An. gambiae. The result showed that
silencing the HSC70B transcript caused significant
increase of ONNV titers in female mosquitoes whilst the
remaining two genes had no noticeable effects. Herein, we
discuss potential antiviral activity of HSC70B in An. gambiae.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of 70 Kda Heat shock protein family
from An. gambiae and D. melanogaster
Phylogenetic analysis of HSP70 genes from An. gambiae
and D. melanogaster indicate that Anopheles HSC70B gene
is evolutionarily more conserved with Drosophila Hsc701 and Hsc70-4 genes than other Anopheles homologues
(Fig 1.). For example, Anopheles HSC70B is most tightly
liked to Drosophila Hsc70-4 (Fig. 1). Multiple sequence
alignments indicated that there are high polymorphisms
near the 5' and 3'-end coding and non-coding regions of
the Anopheles HSC70 family (Fig. 2). Indeed, based on
these sequence polymorphisms among the Anopheles
HSC70 family, we were able to detect unique transcripts
of the Anopheles HSC70B gene among the Anopheles
HSP70 genes by using the RT-PCR and qRT-PCR primers
based on the 3'and 5'-end regions, respectively (Fig. 3 and
Table 1). In addition, the dsRNA of Anopheles HSC70B
was designed based on the 5' end that was specific to the
HSC70B gene, which enabled HSC70B specific knockdown in Anopheles gambiae.
The effect of HSC70B on ONNV replication
First, efficiency of dsRNAi was assessed by using semiquantitative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR analyses. In contrast to
high induction of HSC70B in dsβ-gal and ONNV/ONNVeGFP coinjected mosquitoes, only traces of HSC70B
mRNA were detected in dsHSC70B mosquitoes using
semi-quantitative RT-PCR and primers corresponding to
the 3' end of the HSC70B gene (Fig. 3A). This result shows
that the injection of specific dsHSC70B successfully
reduced endogenous target transcripts of HSC70B gene
after ONNV injection. Similarly, RT-PCR results also
showed the successful post-transcriptional inhibition in
agglutinin and EF-1α genes (Fig. 3A).

Mosquitoes were coinjected with ~3.1 × 102 pfu of virus
and 625 ng of the respective dsRNAs targeting the
HSC70B, agglutinin and EF-1α gene or the β-gal gene as
an internal control (Table 1). To quantify ONNV in the
respective dsRNAi-treated mosquitoes, each An. gambiae
was triturated and ONNV titer was quantified by plaque

assay from the treatment groups. Mosquitoes coinjected
with ONNV and dsHSC70B had significantly more
plaques than those mosquitoes coinjected with ONNV
and dsβ-gal (P = 0.00045) at 6 d.p.i. (Fig. 4). No significant differences in the number of plaques were observed
among the mosquitoes injected with ONNV and each of
ds-agglutinin, dsEF-1α, and dsβ-gal (P ≥ 0.74) (Fig. 4).
To investigate whether up-regulation of HSC70B gene
impedes ONNV replication, An. gambiae was infected with
eGFP-tagged ONNV whilst HSC70B transcripts were
silenced by dsRNAi. ONNV titers were then indirectly estimated by visually comparing eGFP expression among
three mosquito groups that were coinoculated with
dsHSC70B, or dsβ-gal or buffer. In control mosquitoes
injected with dsβ-gal or buffer, expression of eGFP was
usually weak in head, thorax and abdomen tissues (Fig. 5
and Table 2). Mosquitoes coinjected with ONNV-eGFP
and dsHSC70B typically had stronger expression of eGFP
in all three tissues (Fig. 5). At 6 dpi, 47% (n = 32) of mosquitoes receiving dsβ-gal expressed eGFP in thoracic tis-

sues. However, 87% (n = 23) expressed eGFP in thoracic
tissues when dsHSC70B was silenced (Table 2). In a similar way, the mosquitoes receiving dsβ-gal showed 38% (n
= 32) and 22% (n = 32) of eGFP expression in head and
abdomen, respectively (Table 2). In contrast, mosquitoes
receiving dsHSC70B showed 70% (n = 23) and 65% (n =
23) of eGFP expression in head and abdomen, respectively (Table 2).
The ribosomal proteins S4 (RpS4) and S7 (RpS7) were
used as internal controls for infection studies of ONNV
and the malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, respectively
[7,14]. When RpS7 was analyzed by qRT-PCR and cDNA
microarray studies, Student's t test determined that the
mRNA expression levels of RpS7 in uninfected and
ONNV-infected mosquitoes collected at 24 h, 48 h and 14
days p.i. were not significantly different (data not shown).
As shown in Figure 3, RT-PCR analysis of RpS7 and qRTPCR analysis of RpS4 transcript levels at 6 days p.i.,
detected no significant difference between the relative
mRNA levels derived from treated mosquitoes. The results

Discussion

In general, the HSP70 family including HSC70B is one of
the best studied among the heat shock protein families.
The structures of HSP70s and HSC70s are highly conserved in all organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes
[15,16]. The conserved region of the molecule consists of
an N-terminal adenosine triphosphatase domain
(ATPase; ~400 aa), a substrate-binding domain (SBD;
~180 aa), and a carboxyl-terminal domain of variable
length and polymorphism [17].

though it is much less harmful than co-injection of ONNV
and dsHSC70B. This suggests that both reduced expression levels of HSC70B gene and increased ONNV infection level synergistically shorten the lifespan of An.
gambiae (Fig. 4 and Fig. 6).

by dsRNAi, and not attributed to variation in sample loading.

the HSP70 family, was inferred to be located in the cytoplasm [16], and so therefore has may interact with structural and non-structural gene products of ONNV. In fact,
from the in vitro study with another alphavirus Sindbis,
HSC70 purified from bovine brain inhibits the autoprotease activity of Sindbis capsid protein present in the cytoplasm [18].
Interestingly, the prominent antiviral drug cyclopentenone prostanoids and its derivatives, specifically induced
HSP70s and HSC70s in treated Vero and mosquito, Aedes
albopictus, cells [19,20]. Induction of HSP70s has a cytoprotective effect, interrupting viral replication against a
wide range of DNA and RNA viruses including Sindbis
[20,21]. This antiviral response seems to depend on synthesis of molecular chaperons, which are involved in controlling virus replication in various ways [21]. In addition,
recent studies suggested that HSP70 and HSC70 chaperones play a key role in protein quality control, being
involved in either folding or degrading of non-native proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [22-24].
Alternatively, HSC70B may impede viral replication by
modulating other An. gambiae proteins that are critical for
viral replication in mosquito cells. Since one of the key
roles of HSC70B is to regulate nascent unfolded protein as
a chaperone [17], the overexpression of HSC70B may
shift metabolism of mosquito cells to suppress viral replication. Thus, HSC70B may indirectly repress nascent protein folding of host factors required for ONNV replication
in the mosquito. In contrast, a cDNA microarray study in
Ae. aegypti, which is the principal vector of yellow fever
and dengue viruses, reported that Sindbis infection significantly down-regulates the mosquito chaperones, HSP62
and HSP80 [25]. Perhaps, viral suppression of host chaperones may be important for propagation of the virus. Pre-

vious studies of the gene products of alphaviruses have
shown that these gene products suppress and maneuver
host gene expression to favor the viral gene expression system [26,27]. With respect to the regulation/repression of
host cell gene expression, there may thus be competition
between viral and host factors.
Furthermore, the mosquito and virus may compete for the
EF-1α and agglutinin, and this could explain why these
proteins are induced upon infection. However, it cannot
be ruled out that these knockdown effects may not be sufficient to mimic loss-of-function phenotypes to impair or
enhance ONNV replication in An. gambiae, because the
RNAi technique cannot completely abolish target transcripts. This lack of complete knockout is expected to
allow residual expression of target genes, which could
result in protein expression that cannot be phenotypically
distinguished from wild type or control groups. Therefore
proteomics assays measuring viral protein expression in
conjunction with EF-1α or agglutinin knockdown will
provide more definitive pictures for these proteins' role in
ONNV replication in An. gambiae.

tion and cytotoxicity. Understanding the molecular
details of HSC70B interaction with structural and nonstructural gene products of ONNV will lead to the elucidation of new approaches to controlling this pathogenic
virus. Furthermore, this may suggest new control strategies relying upon the development of transgenic mosquitoes that selectively turn on chaperone genes during
arbovirus infection. While molecular mechanisms regarding the regulation of expression of HSP70 genes are relatively well characterized [33], the regulation of HSC70
genes remains to be determined [17].
Our study, in conjunction with the previous microarray
experiments, have proven to be effective to identify candidate genes involved in An. gambiae-ONNV interactions at
the genome level [7]. In addition to genome-wide gene
expression studies, an analysis of tissue-specific gene
expression is also important, e.g., midgut, fat body, and
salivary glands. The discovery of genes that can provide
barriers of ONNV transmission in those mosquito tissues
will be beneficial to control the viral infection in humans.

Methods
Suppression of HSC70B by dsRNAi substantially reduced
the survival rate of ONNV-infected An. gambiae (Fig. 6). In
D. melanogaster, it has been reported that apoptosis affects
primarily cells with the lowest level of HSC70s during
embryogenesis, suggesting a role for HSC70s in the control of apoptosis [28]. Several studies have shown that
HSP70s and HSC70s binding to the anti-apoptotic protein BAG-1 [29,30]. It has also been reported that HSC70s
interacts with the ecdysone receptor and ultraspiracle
(EcR/USP) [31], and that high induction of the chaperones extends longevity in D. melanogaster and in C. elegans
[32]. Our data indicates that An. gambiae HSC70B is also
important for the survival of mosquitoes during viral
infection (Fig. 6).

Conclusion
In summary, our results demonstrate that HSC70B
impede ONNV replication in An. gambiae. The balance
between ONNV propagation and HSC70B abundance
may determine, at least in part, the level of ONNV replica-

Mosquitoes
The 4arr strain of An. gambiae was reared at 27°C and 80%
relative humidity under a 16 h light: 8 h dark photoperiod, as previously described [34]. Adults were supplied
with a cotton wool pad soaked in a 10% sucrose solution
ad libitum and fed on anaesthetized guinea pigs once per
week for egg production.
Virus
The SG650, strain of ONNV was obtained from the World
Reference Center for Arboviruses at the University of Texas
Medical Branch, Galveston, TX. Strain SG650 was isolated
from human serum in Uganda in 1996 [35] and has been
passed once in Vero cells (GenBank Accession Number
AF079456). Stock virus was produced following a single
passage in Vero cells maintained at 37°C in Leibovitz L-15
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Cell supernatant
was harvested when 75% of the cells showed cytopathic
effect (3+ CPE). Supernatant containing the virus was col-

Generation of ONNV-eGFP
The eGFP gene was amplified from pEGFP plasmid (Clontech Laboratories, Inc) using primers Onn-GFP-Asc-F (5'GACCTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTC-3')
Onn-GFP-Pac-R
(5'-GACCTTTAATTAATTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3'). The PCR product was cloned into
AscI and PacI sites of infectious clone pONNic-Foy, provided by K. E. Olson and B. D. Foy (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO), which was previously modified
by replacing the T7 promoter with a SP6 promoter. pONNic-Foy clone was derived from pONN.AP3, developed
by Brault and others [36]. Infectious virus from the infectious clone was produced by linearization with Not I,
which was in vitro transcribed from the SP6 promoter
using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin,
TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA
was electroporated into BHK-21 cells as previously
described [37]. Cell culture supernatant containing virus
was harvested, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C when cells
showed 3 + CPE.

non-structural protein 1 gene (nsP1) (Table 1). The PCR
products of the E1 and nsP1 primer pairs show the expected
sizes, 431 and 440 base pairs, respectively (Table 1), indicating the correct expression of ONNV-eGFP in An. gambiae.

dsRNA preparation and coinjection into adult female
mosquitoes
Templates for the preparation of dsRNA for each candidate gene were PCR-derived fragments flanked by two T7
promoter sequences (TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG)
(Table 1). Each PCR-derived fragment were sequenced
and blasted against the genomic database of An. gambiae
[38] to validate the redundancy of the sequence and all
confirmed as a unique sequence. Single-stranded RNAs
were then synthesized by using the MEGAscript T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Annealed dsRNAs were ethanol
precipitated and dissolved in injection buffer (0.1 mM
sodium phosphate, pH 6.8; 5 mM KCl). In knockdown
experiments, ~0.5 μl of a 2:1 mix of dsRNAs (2 μg/μl),
ONNV or ONNV-eGFP (~2 × 106 pfu/ml) were coinjected
into the thorax of CO2-anesthetized adult females by
using a IM 300 Microinjector (Narishige, Japan). Thus,
each mosquito was coinjected with ~3.1 × 102 pfu of virus
and ~625 ng of dsRNA.
Plaque Assays
Each mosquito was triturated in 1 ml of DMEM, and large
particulates were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 r.p.m.
and then titrated by standard plaque assay in Vero cells
[39]. The plaques were counted and the differences in
viral titers were analyzed by Pairwise t-tests.

injected represented 100%. Asterisks indicate significant differences in survival (unpaired t-test, P ≤ 0.019). N = 6 groups
of 15 individuals for each data point.
RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA samples were extracted from three batches of
15 adult female mosquitoes at 6 d.p.i. with ONNV or
ONNV-eGFP and the respective dsRNA, using the Trizol
Reagent (Invitrogen, CA). To remove genomic DNA contamination, RNA samples were treated with 1.0 μl DNase
I following the manufacturer's instructions (50–375
units/μl; Invitrogen, CA). For reverse transcription, 5 μg of
total RNA were reverse transcribed with Superscript III
RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Singlestranded cDNAs of different dilution were amplified by
PCR using recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). To show the RNAi efficiency, primers were made to
amplify endogenous agglutinin, EF-1α and HSC70b genes
of An. gambiae. RpS7 gene of An. gambiae was used as an
internal control for 23 cycles (Table 1). To characterize the
ONNV-eGFP transcript, primers were made to amplify
endogenous E1 and NS1 genes of for 23 cycles (Table 1).
Quantitative real-time PCR Analysis (qRT-PCR)
qRT-PCR was performed using an ABI 7700 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems, CA). Standard
curves were generated for each transcript tested using 10fold serial dilutions of An. gambiae genomic DNA ranging
from 116 to 0.0116 ng per reaction. All reactions were performed in triplicate in a total volume of 25 μl containing
12.5 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 300 nmol of each

primer at the following conditions: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C
for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of denaturation at 95°C
for 15 s, annealing and extension at 60°C for 1 min. RNA
samples were extracted from mosquitoes at 6 days p.i.
Sequences of gene-specific primer sets are given in Table
1. Statistical significance of differences in the expression
of individual genes was determined by using a Student's ttest between the relative transcript values derived from the
dsHSC70B-injected and dsβ-gal injected mosquitoes
across 3 replicates for each gene.
Survival assay of An. gambiae in co-injection of
dsHSC70B and ONNV
To evaluate the knockdown effect of HSC70B gene on the
survival rate of ONNV infected An. gambiae, 15 females
per cohort were intrathoracically co-injected with
dsHSC70B and ONNV. For control, 15 females per cohort
were intrathoracically coinjected with dsβ-gal and ONNV.
Each treated cohort was kept in 8 cm (diameter) ×12 cm
cages with a cotton wool pad soaked a 10% sucrose solution. The cages were placed at 27°C and 80% relative
humidity under a 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod, and
mosquito survival was assessed at 24 hours. Survival was
defined as the ability of the mosquito to right itself. Experiments for each of the two groups were replicated six
times.
Sources of Sequence Data
The An. gambiae genome has 10 genes containing the
HSP70 domain [40]. Among these, two genes which have
a short fragment of HSP70 domain were excluded for further
analysis
(ENSANGG00000023531,
ENSANGG00000023619). The HSP70 gene sequences for
Drosophila were obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila
Genome Project [41,42].
Multiple Sequence Alignments and Phylogenetic Tree
Construction
Multiple sequence alignments were performed by using
ClustalW v1.81 [43]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed
by the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony
(MP) methods, both included in MEGA3 [44]. The accuracy of reconstructed trees was examined by the bootstrap
test with 10,000 replications.
