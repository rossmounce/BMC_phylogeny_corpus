Abstract
Background: Riboswitches are noncoding RNA structures that appropriately regulate genes in
response to changing cellular conditions. The expression of many proteins involved in fundamental
metabolic processes is controlled by riboswitches that sense relevant small molecule ligands.
Metabolite-binding riboswitches that recognize adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), thiamin
pyrophosphate (TPP), lysine, glycine, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), guanine, adenine, glucosamine6-phosphate (GlcN6P), 7-aminoethyl 7-deazaguanine (preQ1), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
have been reported.
Results: We have used covariance model searches to identify examples of ten widespread
riboswitch classes in the genomes of organisms from all three domains of life. This data set
rigorously defines the phylogenetic distributions of these riboswitch classes and reveals how their
gene control mechanisms vary across different microbial groups. By examining the expanded
aptamer sequence alignments resulting from these searches, we have also re-evaluated and refined
their consensus secondary structures. Updated riboswitch structure models highlight additional
RNA structure motifs, including an unusual double T-loop arrangement common to AdoCbl and
FMN riboswitch aptamers, and incorporate new, sometimes noncanonical, base-base interactions
predicted by a mutual information analysis.
Conclusion: Riboswitches are vital components of many genomes. The additional riboswitch
variants and updated aptamer structure models reported here will improve future efforts to
annotate these widespread regulatory RNAs in genomic sequences and inform ongoing structural
biology efforts. There remain significant questions about what physiological and evolutionary forces
influence the distributions and mechanisms of riboswitches and about what forms of regulation
substitute for riboswitches that appear to be missing in certain lineages.

Many aspects of riboswitch regulation have not yet been critically and quantitatively surveyed. To forward this goal, we
have compiled a comparative genomics data set from systematic database searches for representatives of ten metabolitebinding riboswitch classes (Table 1). The results define the
overall taxonomic distributions of each riboswitch class and
outline trends in the mechanisms of riboswitch-mediated
gene control preferred by different bacterial groups. The
expanded riboswitch sequence alignments resulting from
these searches include newly identified variants that provide
valuable information about their conserved aptamer structures. Using this information, we have re-evaluated the consensus secondary structure models of these ten riboswitch
classes. The updated structures reveal that certain riboswitch
aptamers utilize previously unrecognized examples of common RNA structure motifs as components of their conserved
architectures. They also highlight new base-base interactions
predicted with a procedure that estimates the statistical significance of mutual information scores between alignment
columns.

Background

Riboswitches are autonomous noncoding RNA elements that
monitor the cellular environment and control gene expression [1-4]. More than a dozen classes of riboswitches that
respond to changes in the concentrations of specific small
molecule ligands ranging from amino acids to coenzymes are
currently known. These metabolite-binding riboswitches are
classified according to the architectures of their conserved
aptamer domains, which fold into complex three-dimensional structures to serve as precise receptors for their target
molecules. Riboswitches have been identified in the genomes
of archaea, fungi, and plants; but most examples have been
found in bacteria.
Regulation by riboswitches does not require any macromolecular factors other than an organism's basal gene expression machinery. Metabolite binding to riboswitch aptamers
typically causes an allosteric rearrangement in nearby mRNA
structures that results in a gene control response. For example, bacterial riboswitches located in the 5' untranslated
regions (UTRs) of messenger RNAs can influence the formation of an intrinsic terminator hairpin that prematurely ends
transcription or the formation of an RNA structure that
blocks ribosome binding. Most riboswitches inhibit the production of unnecessary biosynthetic enzymes or transporters
when a compound is already present at sufficient levels. However, some riboswitches activate the expression of salvage or
degradation pathways when their target molecules are
present in excess. Certain riboswitches also employ more
sophisticated mechanisms involving self-cleavage [5], cooperative ligand binding [6], or tandem aptamer arrangements
[7].

Results and discussion
Riboswitch identification overview
Metabolite-binding riboswitch aptamers are typical of complex functional RNAs that must adopt precise three-dimensional shapes to perform their molecular functions. A
conserved scaffold of base-paired helices organizes the overall fold of each aptamer. The identities of bases within most
helices vary during evolution, but changes usually preserve
base pairing to maintain the same architecture. In contrast,
the base identities of nucleotides that directly contact the tar-

get molecule or stabilize tertiary interactions necessary to
assemble a precise binding pocket are highly conserved even
in distantly related organisms. Additionally, many riboswitches tolerate long nonconserved insertions at specific sites
within their structures. These 'variable insertions' typically
adopt stable RNA stem-loops that do not interfere with folding of the aptamer core.
Nearly all of the riboswitches discovered to date are cis-regulatory elements. For example, bacterial riboswitches are
almost always located upstream of protein-coding genes
related to the metabolism of their target molecules. Therefore, the genomic contexts of putative hits returned by an
RNA homology search can be used to recognize legitimate
riboswitches even when a search algorithm returns many
false positives. Using this tactic, one can iteratively refine the
description of a riboswitch aptamer by incorporating authentic low scoring hits into a new structure model and then researching the sequence database.
Several riboswitches were first identified as widespread RNA
elements based on the presence of a highly conserved 'box'
sequence within their structures. BLAST searches for the B12
box [8], S box [9], and THI box [10] sequences are effective
for discovering many examples of the adenosylcobalamin
(AdoCbl), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-I, and thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitches, respectively. Other search
techniques score how well a sequence matches a template of
conserved bases and base-paired helices that the user manually devises from known examples of the riboswitch aptamer.
The RNAmotif program performs this sort of generalized pattern matching [11]. A third strategy computationally defines
and then searches for ungapped blocks of sequence conservation that are characteristic of a given riboswitch and spaced
throughout its structure [12]. While these methods can be
effective, they generally do not fully exploit the information
contained in multiple sequence alignments of functional RNA
families to efficiently identify highly diverged members.
Covariance models (CMs) are generalized probabilistic
descriptions of RNA structures that offer several advantages
over other homology search methods [13]. CMs can be
directly trained on an input sequence alignment without
time-consuming manual intervention. They also provide a
more complete model of the sequence and structure conservation observed in functional RNA families that incorporates:
first-order sequence consensus information; second-order
covariation, where the probability of observing a base in one
alignment column depends on the identity of the base in
another column; insert states that allow variable-length
insertions; and deletion states that allow omission of consensus nucleotides. This complexity comes at a computational
cost, but several filtering techniques have recently been
developed that make CM searches of large databases practical
[14-16]. For example, CMs have been used to find divergent
homologs of Escherichia coli 6S RNA [17] and define a variety

of regulatory RNA motifs in α-proteobacteria [18]. The Rfam
database [19] maintains hundreds of covariance models for
identifying a wide variety of functional RNAs, including
riboswitches.
In the present study, we used covariance models to systematically search for ten classes of metabolite-binding riboswitches in microbial genomes, environmental sequences, and
selected eukaryotic organisms. The riboswitch sequence
alignments used to train these CMs were derived from a variety of published and unpublished sources (Table 1). The
genomic contexts of prospective riboswitch hits were examined to confirm that each was appropriately positioned to
function as a regulatory element. In general, CMs trained on
the input alignments were able to discriminate valid riboswitch sequences from false positive hits on the basis of CM
scores alone. The most common exceptions were spuriously
high-scoring AU-rich matches to the smaller riboswitch models (for example, the purine riboswitch) and bona fide lowscoring hits with variable insertions at unusual positions in
the more structurally complex riboswitch classes.
Prospective riboswitch matches were also examined to ensure
that they conformed to known aptamer structure constraints.
In certain cases, it was necessary to manually correct portions
of the automated sequence alignments defined by the maximally scoring path of each hit through the states of the CM.
For example, CMs model only hierarchically nested base pairs
for algorithmic speed [13]. Consequently, the pseudoknotted
helices and pairings present in several riboswitches were
aligned by hand to achieve the desired accuracy. The automated CM alignments also tend to incorrectly shift nucleotides when deletions of consensus positions result in
ambiguity concerning the optimal placement of remaining
sequences. The alignments of new RNA structure motifs and
base-base interactions described later that were not present
in the seed alignments used to train the covariance models
were also manually adjusted. Multiple sequence alignments
of the resulting curated riboswitch hits are available as Additional data files 1 and 2.

Riboswitch distributions
The phylogenetic distributions of the ten riboswitch classes
were mapped from these search results (Figure 1). Members
of the TPP riboswitch class are the only metabolite-binding
RNAs known to occur outside of eubacteria. TPP riboswitch
representatives are found in euryarchaeal, fungal, and plant
species. The AdoCbl riboswitch is the most widespread class
in bacteria, but TPP, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and
SAM-I riboswitches are also common in many groups. Glycine and lysine riboswitches have more fragmented distributions. They are widespread in certain bacterial groups, but
appear to be missing from others. Finally, the glucosamine-6phosphate (GlcN6P), purine, 7-aminoethyl 7-deazaguanine
(preQ1), and SAM-II riboswitches were identified in only a
few groups of bacteria. Interestingly, the SAM-I and SAM-II

aptamer distributions overlap slightly. Examples of both
SAM-sensing riboswitch classes were found in α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, but no single bacterial species was found to carry both SAM-I and SAM-II
riboswitch classes.
It is possible that many of the relatively isolated examples
where riboswitches occur only sporadically in certain clades
(for example, SAM-I, SAM-II, purine, and preQ1 in γ-Proteobacteria) may be examples of horizontal DNA transfer. There
is some evidence that this process has been important for the
dispersal of riboswitches into new bacterial genomes. Entire
transcriptional units containing AdoCbl riboswitches and
their associated biosynthetic operons appear to have been
transferred from Bacillus/Clostridium species to enterobacteria at some point [20]. In contrast, no evidence of recent
horizontal transfer was observed in phylogenetic trees of
lysine riboswitch aptamers, despite their disjointed distribution across different taxonomic groups [21].
Firmicutes (low G+C Gram-positive bacteria) appear to make
the most extensive use of the riboswitch classes examined in
this study. Every riboswitch except SAM-II is widespread in
this clade, and most aptamer classes occur multiple times per
genome. For example, Bacillus subtilis carries at least 29
riboswitches (5 TPP, 1 AdoCbl, 2 FMN, 1 glycine, 11 SAM-I, 2
lysine, 1 GlcN6P, 4 guanine, 1 adenine, and 1 preQ1) controlling approximately 73 genes. Experimental and computational efforts to identify riboswitches have been focused
specifically on B. subtilis [22,23], so it is possible that the
overrepresentation of these ten riboswitch classes in Firmicutes reflects a discovery bias. Indeed, new computational
searches are beginning to identify riboswitch classes that are
predominantly used by other groups of bacteria [18,24].
As a whole, γ-Proteobacteria employ a mixture of these ten
riboswitch classes that is comparable to the diversity found in
Firmicute species. However, individual species usually carry
fewer riboswitch classes overall and fewer representatives of
each class. For example, E. coli has six riboswitches (three
TPP, one AdoCbl, one FMN, and one lysine) from the ten
classes examined, which regulate a total of sixteen genes.
Deeply branched bacteria such as Deinococcus/Thermus and
Thermotoga species also appear to utilize a variety of riboswitches. However, no riboswitch sequences have yet been
identified in Aquifex species, and riboswitches also seem to
occur only rarely in Chlamydia species, Cyanobacteria, and
Spirochetes. However, the sequence database sizes for many
of these bacterial groups are relatively small so the observed
frequencies will probably need to be revised as more genomic
sequences become available.
As expected, representatives of almost all ten riboswitch
classes are found in sequences from shotgun cloning projects
that target environments supporting diverse bacterial com-

munities. These sources of additional sequences have been
helpful in some cases for defining consensus structure models
and adding statistical merit to mutual information calculations (see below). It is notable that glycine and SAM-II riboswitches are unusually common in Sargasso Sea metagenomic
sequences [25]. This data set appears to be contaminated with
some non-native Shewanella and Burkholderia sequences
[26], but the large number of SAM-II matches probably accurately reflects the abundance of α-Proteobacteria in this
environment.

Riboswitch mechanism overview
GlcN6P riboswitches are ribozymes that harness a self-cleavage event to repress expression of downstream glmS genes
[5]. Members of this class are unique compared to other
riboswitches because they adopt a preformed binding pocket
for glucosamine-6-phosphate [27,28] and use the metabolite
target as a cofactor to accelerate RNA cleavage [28-30]. The
nine other riboswitch classes studied here utilize ligandinduced changes in 'expression platform' sequences to control a variety of gene expression processes [1]. The architectures of riboswitch expression platforms can be used to
predict their gene control mechanisms on a genomic scale, as
described below.
Riboswitches typically contain disordered regions in their
conserved aptamer cores that become structured upon
metabolite binding. These changes may trigger rearrangements in additional expression platform structures located
outside of the aptamer, such that two alternative conformations with mutually exclusive base-paired architectures exist
for the entire riboswitch. Some riboswitches operate at thermodynamic equilibrium [31]. They are able to interconvert
between these ligand-bound and ligand-free structures in the
context of the full-length RNA. Regulation by other riboswitches is kinetically controlled [32-35]. The relative speeds
of transcription and co-transcriptional ligand binding dominate a one-time decision as to which folding pathway to follow. The active and inactive conformations of these
riboswitches are trapped in the final RNA molecule and do
not readily interconvert on a time scale that is relevant to the
gene control system.
In most riboswitches, bases from the aptamer's outermost P1
'switching' helix, which is enforced in the ligand-bound conformation, pair to expression platform sequences to form an
alternative structure in the absence of ligand, for example,
[36,37]. However, some riboswitches harness shape changes
elsewhere in their aptamers to regulate gene expression.
AdoCbl riboswitches usually rely on the ligand-dependent
formation of a pseudoknot between a specific C-rich loop and
sequences outside the aptamer core to exert gene control
[20,38,39]. SAM-II aptamers enforce a distal pseudoknot to
interface with their expression platforms [18], and preQ1
riboswitches sequester conserved 3' tail sequences upon
metabolite binding [40].

Genome Biology 2007,

Riboswitches can use ligand-induced structure changes to
control gene expression in a variety of contexts. For example,
the TPP riboswitches found in eukaryotes reside in introns
located near the 5' ends of fungal pre-mRNAs [41-43] or in
the 3' UTRs of plant pre-mRNAs [41]. Ligand binding modulates splicing of these introns, generating alternative-processed mRNAs that are expressed at different levels. In each
example studied, a portion of the P4-P5 stem region pairs
near a 5' splice-site, and this pairing is displaced when TPP is
bound [43] (A Wachter, M Tunc-Ozdemir, BC Grove, PJ
Green, DK Shintani, RRB, unpublished data). In contrast,
almost all bacterial riboswitches occur in the 5' UTRs of
mRNAs. Metabolite binding to these riboswitches generally
regulates either transcription or translation of the encoded
genes.
Bacterial riboswitches that regulate transcription usually
control the formation of intrinsic terminator stems located
within the same 5' UTR. Intrinsic terminators are stable GCrich stem-loops followed by polyuridine tracts that cause
RNA polymerase to stall and release the nascent RNA with
some probability [44,45]. Certain glycine [6] adenine [46],
and lysine [21] riboswitches with ON genetic logic use structural rearrangements triggered by metabolite binding to bury
pieces of terminator stems in alternative pairing interactions.
However, most riboswitches controlling transcription are
OFF switches that add an extra folding element to reverse this
logic. Metabolite binding to these riboswitches disrupts an
antiterminator, which normally sequesters bases required to
form the terminator stem, allowing the terminator to form
and repress gene expression. Similar antiterminator/terminator trade-offs occur in bacterial RNAs regulated by proteinor ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation mechanisms
[47].
Bacterial riboswitches that regulate translation typically use
ligand-induced structure changes to block translation initiation. Unlike riboswitches with transcription control mechanisms, which require very specific terminator structures in
their expression platforms, the RNA structures that prevent
translation initiation may be more varied. Sometimes, they
rely on simple hairpins that sequester the ribosome binding
site (RBS) of the downstream gene in a base-paired helix. In
these cases, a riboswitch with OFF genetic logic can harness
metabolite binding to disrupt a mutually exclusive antisequestor pairing, allowing the sequestor hairpin to form and
attenuate translation. More convoluted base-pairing tradeoffs and shape changes may operate in other expression platforms to alter the efficiency of translation initiation in
response to ligand binding.
Two variants of these mechanisms that dispense with or combine the elements of a typical bacterial riboswitch expression
platform are worth noting. Some riboswitches bury the RBS
of the downstream gene within their conserved aptamer cores
[48,49]. Thus, ligand binding directly attenuates translation

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R239

Barrick and Breaker R239.6

without the involvement of any additional expression platform sequences. Other riboswitches regulate the formation of
a transcription terminator located so close to the adjacent
open reading frame that its RBS resides within the 3' side of
the terminator hairpin [48]. Riboswitches with these dual
expression platforms could attenuate transcription and, if
termination does not occur, could also inhibit translation.
Metabolite-dependent inhibition of ribosome binding has
been proven in vitro for the E. coli AdoCbl riboswitch located
upstream of the btuB gene [50]. In addition, in vivo expression assays using translational fusions between AdoCbl riboswitches and reporter genes indicate that control of translation
is occurring [38]. However, other co- or post-transcription
mechanisms might also contribute to the observed gene
expression changes. For example, AdoCbl riboswitches from
E. coli and B. subtilis can be cleaved by RNase P [51]. Such
findings raise the interesting possibility that differential RNA
processing or degradation caused by ligand-induced conformational changes might be the primary mechanism by which
some riboswitches regulate gene expression.
There is one interesting instance where a Clostridium acetobutylicum SAM-I riboswitch appears to regulate protein
expression through an antisense RNA intermediate [52]. This
riboswitch is located immediately downstream, and in the
opposite orientation from, an operon encoding a putative salvage pathway for converting methionine to cysteine. It has an
expression platform, consisting of a typical terminator/antiterminator arrangement, with OFF genetic logic. Presumably,
when SAM (and consequently methionine) pools are low,
transcription of the full-length antisense RNA causes inhibition and degradation of the sense mRNA as is observed in
some bacterial regulatory systems that employ small RNAs
[53]. When SAM levels are high, the SAM-I riboswitch will
prematurely terminate the antisense transcript, allowing
expression of this operon to recycle excess methionine.
In some instances, riboswitches or their components are
found in tandem arrangements. Almost all glycine riboswitches consist of two aptamers that regulate a single downstream expression platform [6]. In the genomic sequences
searched here, 88% of the mRNA leaders containing one glycine aptamer also carry a second aptamer. Cooperative binding of two ligand molecules by these glycine riboswitches
yields a genetic switch that is more 'digital', that is, more
responsive to smaller changes in ligand concentration, than a
single aptamer.
Far less common are tandem arrangements of other riboswitch classes such as TPP [7,54,55] or AdoCbl [55]. Fewer
than 1% of the UTRs regulated by these riboswitch classes
contain multiple aptamers. In these cases, each aptamer
appears to function as an independent riboswitch that regulates its own expression platform to yield a more digital, compound genetic switch [7]. Also rare are tandem arrangements

wherein representatives of two different riboswitches are in
the same UTR. In the metE mRNA leader from Bacillus
clausii, a SAM-I and an AdoCbl riboswitch independently
control transcription termination to combinatorially regulate
expression of this gene in response to two different metabolite inputs [55].

with OFF genetic logic, that is, gene expression may be attenuated in the ligand-free state and relieved by metabolite
binding. Overall, computational assignments by this procedure have an accuracy of 88% when compared to expert predictions of TPP riboswitch mechanisms [48].
It is important to note that the decision tree does not explicitly predict RBS-hiding structures in expression platforms.
Rather, it assumes that control of translation initiation is the
most likely mechanism for riboswitches not classified into the
other categories. It is possible that these riboswitches could
operate by mechanisms other than the five assigned by this
procedure (as described above). Another caveat is that this
prediction scheme considers only intrinsic terminator structures consisting of RNA stem-loops followed by polyuridine
tails. These are currently the only structures that riboswitches
with transcription attenuation mechanisms are known to reg-

Riboswitch mechanisms
A decision tree was established for computationally classifying the gene control mechanisms of microbial riboswitches
(Figure 2). The five categories assigned are: transcription
attenuation; dual transcription and translation attenuation;
translation attenuation; direct translation attenuation; and
antisense regulation. The same mechanisms have been predicted for TPP [48], AdoCbl [20], FMN [56], and lysine [21]
riboswitches in previous comparative studies. The use of the
term attenuation here does not imply that a switch operates

ulate. However, some bacteria appear to be able to utilize
other structures that may lack a canonical U-tail or consist of
tandem hairpins to terminate transcription [57].
Mapping riboswitch mechanism predictions onto a phylogenetic tree (Figure 3) reveals that transcription attenuation
dominates in Firmicutes and that translation attenuation is
most common in other bacterial groups. The phylogenetic
distribution of SAM-II riboswitch mechanisms is an exception. It is the only riboswitch aptamer that appears to be most
often associated with regulatory transcription terminators in
α- and β-Proteobacteria, although the mechanisms by which
SAM-II aptamers control gene expression have not yet been
experimentally established [18]. Transcription attenuation
mechanisms may also be generally overrepresented in Fusobacteria, δ/ε-Proteobacteria, Thermatogae, and Chloroflexi

species, although smaller sample sizes make these conclusions less certain.
Mechanisms that rely on sequestering the RBS within the
conserved aptamer core are most common for the TPP, preQ1,
and SAM-I riboswitches. In the first two cases, purine-rich
conserved regions near the 3' ends of the riboswitch
substitute for RBS sequences. In SAM-I riboswitches, the
RBS is incorporated into the 3' side of the P1 stem. Other
riboswitch classes also have purine-rich conserved regions
near their 3' ends with consensus sequences close to ribosome
binding sites. It is not clear why direct regulation of translation attenuation is not more common in these other classes.
Perhaps access to the RBS-like sequences in these aptamers is
not modulated by ligand binding. Riboswitch regulation by
direct translation attenuation appears to be most frequent in

Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria, except for the preQ1 riboswitch where this mechanism is unusually prevalent, even in
Firmicutes and Proteobacteria.
There do not appear to be any additional examples of riboswitches positioned for antisense regulation in this data set.
An antisense arrangement may be rare because it inverts the
gene control logic of the riboswitch and requires the evolutionary maintenance of a second promoter. A handful of highscoring hits were found that appear to be functional aptamers
even though they are not located upstream of genes related to
the cognate metabolite. It is possible that these riboswitches
affect their target genes by regulating the production or function of trans-acting antisense RNAs or that they have been
recently orphaned by genomic rearrangements and are now
pseudo-regulatory sequences.

Evaluating structure models
Constructing an RNA secondary structure model using phylogenetic sequence data requires identifying possible basepaired stems and adjusting a sequence alignment to determine whether each proposed stem appears reasonable for all
representatives. This recursive refinement process has been
used to create detailed comparative models of many functional RNA structures that accurately reflect later genetic,
biochemical and biophysical data. However, the presence of
stretches of unvarying nucleotides within an RNA structure,
the tolerance of stems to some non-canonical base pairs or
mismatches, and the non-negligible frequency of sequencing
errors in biological databases can introduce enough uncertainty that multiple structures may seem to agree with a
sequence alignment and incorrect base-paired elements may
be proposed. This problem is compounded if the multiple
sequence alignment is incomplete and does not yet capture all
of the variation that truly exists at each nucleotide position.
Inconsistencies and ambiguities in some riboswitch aptamer
models motivated us to evaluate the statistical support for
base pairs in their proposed structures. We chose to use
mutual information (MI) scores [58] to mathematically formalize the interdependence between sequence alignment columns that is indicative of base interactions. MI is a
normalized version of covariance that represents the amount
of information (in bits) gained about what base occurs at a
given position from knowing the identity of a base at another
position. The prediction of RNA secondary structures and
tertiary interactions from covariation in sequence alignments
has a long history, and the nuances of calculating and interpreting MI scores have been comprehensively covered elsewhere [59,60].
Fundamentally, columns of interacting bases must be correctly aligned and there must be variation within each column
(that is, it cannot be completely conserved) in order to detect
mutual information. Even when these preconditions are met,
there are two difficulties with directly comparing MI scores to

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R239

Barrick and Breaker R239.9

determine which columns in a sequence alignment truly covary. First, sequence conservation derived from the shared
evolutionary histories of sequence subsets in an alignment
may result in a high residual background MI score between
many columns whether or not they are functionally linked.
Second, alignments with fewer sequences will have more column pairs with elevated MI scores simply by chance. Simulations addressing the expected magnitudes of these two
sources of error in different data sets have been explored
recently in the context of protein sequence alignments [61].
In order to better gauge whether MI scores support proposed
base interactions in an RNA alignment, we developed a
procedure for empirically estimating their statistical significance (Figure 4). First, a phylogenetic tree is inferred from the
observed RNA sequence alignment according to a model that
assumes independent evolution at each position and allows
for varying per-column mutation rates. Then, resampled
alignments with the same topology, branch lengths, and evolutionary rates are generated. MI scores between columns in
these test alignments reflect the null hypothesis that there is
no covariation between positions. They implicitly correct for
the evolutionary history and sample size of the real sequence
alignment. Therefore, the p value significance for an observed
MI score in the real alignment is the fraction of test alignments with higher MI scores between these two columns.

Riboswitch structures
The consensus secondary structure models of the ten riboswitch classes (Figure 5) have been updated to reflect information from newly identified aptamer variants. The purine, TPP,
SAM-I, and GlcN6P riboswitch consensus structures have
been drawn in accordance with their molecular structures
(references in Table 1). Other riboswitch structures have been
revised to be consistent with the new predictions of structure
motifs and base-base interactions explained below. In all
cases, previous numbering schemes for the paired helical elements (designated P1, P2, P3, and so on, beginning at the 5'
end of each the aptamer) have been maintained, even when
these stems do not occur in a majority of the sequences in the
updated alignment. Newly discovered paired elements that
do not appear in most examples of a riboswitch aptamer have
not been assigned numbers.
The results of the mutual information analysis are shown
superimposed on the consensus riboswitch structures. Most
base-paired helices are supported by at least one contiguous
base pair with a highly significant MI (p < 0.001), and almost
all contain a base pair with at least a marginal MI significance
(p < 0.01). No significant MI scores are present within the
P2.1 and P2.2 stems observed in the crystal structures of the
GlcN6P-dependent ribozyme [28,30]. However, most of the
predicted base pairs in the P2.1 and P2.2 helices are between
highly conserved bases that may not vary enough to produce
significant covariation with their pairing partners. The MI
analysis also does not support an alternative P1.1 pseudoknot

(not shown) proposed on the basis of biochemical experiments where the register of the regions involved in making
the P2.1 pairing is slightly shifted [29,62,63].
MI significance scores do resolve a conflict between two pairing models that have been proposed for the highly conserved
B12 box of the AdoCbl riboswitch (Figure 6). One model posits that a 'facultative stem loop' forms by pairing nucleotides
within the B12 box [20]. The other model proposes longrange pairings between portions of the B12 box and nucleotides more distant in RNA sequence [39]. There is only a single, marginally significant MI score that supports the
formation of the 'facultative stem loop', even though this
region was correctly aligned to optimally discover such interactions. The MI analysis strongly supports several base pairs
in the alternative proposed structure wherein portions of the
conserved B12 box form the 3' sides of the short P3 and P6
helical stems.

Several riboswitches contain common RNA structure motifs
that are recognizable from their consensus features. A GNRA
tetraloop [64] that favors a pyrimidine at its second position
caps P4a of most GlcN6P ribozymes. A K-turn [65,66]
between P2 and P2a is conserved in SAM-I riboswitch aptamers [66]. The asymmetric bulge between helices P2a and P2b
in the lysine riboswitch also fits a K-turn consensus in most
sequences [67], but a number of variants appear to lack this
motif. A sarcin-ricin motif [68] (a specific type of loop E
motif) in the asymmetric bulge between the P2 and P2a helices of the lysine riboswitch is more highly conserved [37,67].

We also find examples of other RNA structure motifs that
have not previously been reported in these riboswitch classes.
The consensus features of the three terminal loops capping
P2, P3, and P5 in the FMN riboswitch and the P4 loop and P6P7 bulge in the AdoCbl riboswitch are remarkably similar.
Each has two closing G-C base pairs with a strand bias, a possible U-A pair separated from the helical stem by two bulged
nucleotides on the 3' side, and a terminal GNR triloop
sequence that is sometimes interrupted at a specific position
by an intervening base-paired helix. These characteristics
strongly suggest that they adopt T-loop structures (named for
the T-loop of tRNA) where the U-A forms a key trans WatsonCrick/Hoogsteen pair [69].

Sequence conservation in the UNR loop that closes the P5
stem in the TPP aptamer suggests that it forms a conserved Uturn [70]. As expected, there is a sharp reversal of backbone
direction following this uridine, subsequent bases stack on
the 3' side of the loop, and the uracil base can hydrogen bond
with the phosphate group 3' of the third U-turn nucleotide in
the X-ray crystal structures of E. coli [71,72] and Arabidopsis
thaliana [73] riboswitches. Also, in the TPP aptamer, the
conserved UGAGA sequence 3' of the P3 helix fits the UGNRA
consensus for a type R1 lonepair triloop [74]. The crystal

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/11/R239

structures confirm that this motif is present with the
characteristic trans Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen U-A closing
pair around the triloop. Commonly, a tertiary interaction
between the triloop G base and an outside A leads to a
composite GNRA tetraloop structure. However, in this case,
the pyrimidine ring from the TPP ligand intercalates into the
triloop at an equivalent position.

New base-base interaction predictions
In addition to supporting almost all of the helical elements in
the riboswitch structure models, the MI analysis predicts
eleven additional base-pairing interactions (Figures 5 and 7).
Significant MI scores between two alignment columns should
be interpreted with caution. They represent a statistical correlation and do not necessarily imply hydrogen bonding
between nucleobases. Correlations between adjacent nucleotides that probably represent favored base stacking patterns
in helices and column pairs with many gaps where MI scores
can be dominated by the presence and absence of nucleotides
rather than their base identities have been ignored. It is also
possible to observe high mutual information between two
bases that do not interact if several separate structure motifs
with their own specific sequence requirements can substitute
for each other in a functional RNA, as is seen for GNRA,
UNCG, and CUUG tetraloops in 16S rRNA [59].
Furthermore, the estimates of MI significance rely on a phylogenetic tree reconstruction method that may not adequately
capture the evolution of these RNA sequences, especially for
the shorter riboswitch alignments. Even assuming that the
estimated p values are completely accurate, there are 4,950
possible combinations of columns in an alignment with 100
columns, and that would imply that, on average, 5 pairs with
a MI significance of ≤0.01 will be observed by chance. Some
columns that are known to be base paired do not have MI
scores this significant. In light of this noisy background, we
manually screened MI predictions and concentrated on interacting columns that seem to have structural relevance.
The identities of interacting bases in a functional RNA are
constrained during evolution. They can mutate only to other
base pairs that preserve the local geometry of the sugar-phosphate backbone and any hydrogen bonds that are important
for maintaining structure and function. Generally, only one of
the three planar edges of a nucleobase participates in any
given interaction: the Watson-Crick face (WC), Hoogsteen
face (H), or sugar edge (SE). A systematic study of RNA structures has produced isostericity matrices [75] that tabulate

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R239

Barrick and Breaker R239.11

which of the possible 16 base pairs should be interchangeable
(in terms of C1'-C1' distances) when two nucleobases are
interacting between different combinations of these three
base edges and when the glycosidic bonds on both sides of the
pair are cis or trans with respect to each other. The pairs of
bases conserved at some of the new correlated positions in
riboswitches suggest unusual non-Watson-Crick interactions, and this isostericity framework can be used to tentatively assign possible geometries to the newly predicted base
pairs (Figure 7).
In the TPP riboswitch, there is significant MI between the two
bases directly 5' of P3 and 3' of P3a that could bridge this helical junction. This correlation was highly significant (p =
0.0002) in an alignment of all TPP riboswitch sequences.
However, re-examination of the alignment showed that the
predominant A-G and U-A pairs mainly occurred in the 552
sequences that have the optional P3a stem-loop. In fact, there
is no correlation between these columns in the remaining 355
sequences that lack P3a. Exchange of U-A and A-G pairs is
most consistent with a cis H/WC edge interaction between
these two bases. These pairs are also isosteric in a trans H/H
geometry, but this configuration involves only a single hydrogen bond, and there are four other isosteric nucleobase combinations that are not observed. Both pair geometries imply
that either the sugar-phosphate backbones of the interacting
bases are in a parallel orientation or that they are anti-parallel, with one of the bases adopting a rare syn glycosidic bond
rotation. It may be necessary for these bases to assume an
unusual geometry to accommodate the P3a helix at this
location.
The molecular resolution structures of TPP riboswitches do
not impinge on this prediction, as each of these constructs
lacks P3a [71-73]. On the basis of the consensus structure, it
is possible to further predict that when the P3a helix is
present it will coaxially stack on the P2 helix as part of a type
C three-way helical junction [76] wherein P3a, P2, and P3 are
assigned P1, P2, and P3 roles, respectively. The molecular
structures show a diagnostic feature of this configuration
even in the absence of P3a: the J13 motif sequence (corresponding to the conserved UGAGA) forms a pseudohairpin
that makes adenine base contacts to the minor groove of the
motif's P1 helix (P2 of the riboswitch). Furthermore, there is
space in the crystal structure to accommodate P3a cohelically
stacking on P2, and this would place P3a parallel to and offset
from P3, as is expected for this common three-way junction
geometry.

Comparison of B12 box structure models
Comparison of B12 box structure models. In addition to the model of the
AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer structure presented here [39], an alternative
model that folds the highly conserved B12 box sequence (highlighted in
red) into a 'facultative stem-loop' has been proposed [20]. The core of the
AdoCbl riboswitch aptamer is shown with abbreviated peripheral helices
and without the optional P8-P10-P11 domain for comparison with the
alternative secondary structure model. The upper model is supported by
multiple base pairs with significant MI scores between B12 box bases and
remote positions. In it, a portion of the B12 box also forms part of an
internal T-loop motif between P6 and P7. Each diagram uses the symbols
described in the legend to Figure 5.

Three new base interactions are predicted in AdoCbl riboswitch aptamers. A lone WC base pair (p < 0.0001) seems to
enclose the conserved A-rich sequence between the P2 and P3
helices. A highly significant MI score (p < 0.0001) also
supports a WC pair with purine/pyrimidine strand bias
between the nucleotide directly 3' of the P4 helix and a position within the two nucleotide 3' bulge of the P6-P7 T-loop
motif. The adjacent nucleotides in this strand and the T-loop
bulge could form a highly conserved, cohelical C-G base pair.
Similar long-range Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions to
these two bulged nucleotides are common with 'type-II' Tloops [69]. The final new prediction in the AdoCbl riboswitch
is a non-canonical G-A or A-G pair (p = 0.0001) that probably
assumes a cis WC/WC geometry to continue base stacking
with the P6 helix. These pairs are also isosteric in a cis H/H

The FMN riboswitch may contain a strikingly similar T-loop
interaction. The nucleotide directly 3' of its P5 helix can form
a Watson-Crick pair (p = 0.009) with a pyrimidine/purine
strand bias to the 3' bulge of the T-loop motif that caps P3. An
adjacent G-C base pair is also possible here between highly
conserved nucleotides in the strand and T-loop bulge. In both
the AdoCbl and FMN riboswitches, the stem-loops adjacent
to this predicted interaction have exactly five paired nucleotides and are capped by a second T-loop motif. Although the
second T-loop does not seem to be directly relevant to this
predicted pairing interaction, the double T-loop substructure
that these riboswitches have in common suggests that significant similarity exists between their overall tertiary folds even
though they recognize very different ligand molecules.
The MI analysis suggests two new base-base interactions in
the glycine riboswitch. The first is a WC pair (p = 0.005) with
purine/pyrimidine strand bias at the base of the P2 stem of
the first aptamer. If this pair cohelically stacks with the P2
stem, then it would often require a bulged nucleotide on the
5' side of the composite helix. The second interaction is a predicted G-G or A-A homopurine pair (p = 0.002) that might
adopt a cis bifurcated geometry within the central bulge of the
second aptamer. Bifurcated pairs hydrogen bond between an
exocyclic functional group on one base and the edge of the
other base, and they are consequently intermediate between
two edge geometries (possibly cis WC/WC and trans WC/H
in this case). If this pair forms, it suggests that the two bases
on each strand between it and the P1 stem may form G-A and
A-G pairs. Both of these putative interactions are maintained
in the opposite aptamer of the glycine riboswitch. However,
the nucleotides at the corresponding positions are less variable, which may explain why they were not detected a second
time by the MI analysis.
Two new base-pairing contacts are predicted for SAM-I riboswitches. The first occurs at the end of the P2 helix adjacent to
the conserved G-A and A-G pairs of the K-turn motif. This
pair has a highly significant MI score (p = 0.0006) and mainly
varies from G-A to C-C, which is most compatible with a trans
SE/H base interaction within this cohelical stacking context.
Noncanonical pairs with this configuration are known to
occur frequently adjacent to K-turns in other functional RNA
structures [77]. The second predicted interaction (p =
0.0003) is an unexpected long-range cis WC/WC base pair
between the base directly upstream of the 5' side of the P2b
pseudoknot and the base directly upstream of the P1 3' strand.
After originally discovering these new interactions from
sequence analysis, we were able to verify that both interactions occur with the predicted configurations in the X-ray
crystal structure of a minimized version of the Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis metF SAM-I riboswitch [78].

New base-base interaction predictions
New base-base interaction predictions. For each numbered and asterisked prediction in Figure 5 the statistical significance (p value) of the mutual
information between the two alignment columns is shown, followed by the relative frequencies with which specific combinations of bases are observed in
those columns. Base pair geometries and isostericity groups compatible with the asterisked pairs are described in more detail elsewhere [75]. These
descriptions include the relative orientations of the glycosidic bonds across the pair (cis or trans), the edges of each base that interact (WC, Watson-Crick;
H, Hoogsteen; SE, sugar edge; bifurcated, intermediate between two edges), and the relative backbone strand geometry (parallel or anti-parallel) assuming
both glycosidic bonds are in default anti conformations.

The MI analysis predicts two new base-base interactions in
the SAM-II riboswitch. A homopurine G-G or A-A pair (p =
0.0002) could form between two positions in the bulge
between P1 and the 5' strand of the P2 pseudoknot. This pair
may adopt a cis bifurcated geometry. A Watson-Crick base
pair (p < 0.0001) may also exist between the last nucleotide
in the central loop that is contained within the P1 stem and a
downstream position. This pair could be extended into a short
helical element (P1a) if the adjacent, conserved C-G and G-C
base pairs also form canonical WC pairs and an intervening
base is bulged out.

Conclusion

The ten metabolite-sensing riboswitch classes surveyed here
are widespread and versatile gene control elements. The conserved secondary structure models of these riboswitch
aptamers have been revised to include information from
additional sequence variants. These models incorporate
newly recognized RNA structure motifs, including a double Tloop substructure that is conserved in AdoCbl and FMN
aptamers, and specify new sites where the insertion of unconserved RNA domains is possible. Furthermore, an analysis of
mutual information scores using an evolutionarily informed
background model has enabled the prediction of new basebase interactions in several riboswitch aptamers. These
refinements should improve the accuracy of future computational searches for riboswitches as the automated annotation
of functional RNAs in genomic sequences becomes more routine [19]. They will also inform and validate ongoing efforts to
determine the molecular resolution structures of riboswitch
aptamers.
It is believed that some metabolite-binding riboswitch classes
may be descended from the RNA World [79] and that others
may be more recent evolutionary innovations [80], but the
exact provenance of each riboswitch class is unclear. Significant uncertainty also remains about what physiological and
evolutionary forces affect riboswitch use by modern organisms. Particularly, there are unexplained differences in the
distributions and preferred regulatory mechanisms of
riboswitches across contemporary bacteria. Riboswitches
found in Firmicutes (low G+C Gram-positive bacteria) predominantly regulate transcription attenuation, whereas
translation attenuation mechanisms are most prevalent in
other groups. Overall, riboswitches also appear to be more
common in Firmicutes than other bacterial groups.

One of the more interesting aspects of the riboswitch phylogenetic profile is that it outlines gaps and holes in the known
distributions of riboswitch classes. Some of these apparently
vacant regulatory niches may be occupied by regulatory proteins that fulfill the same role or by extreme structural variants of these riboswitch classes that are not detectable with
current RNA homology search techniques. Other gaps could
harbor new aptamer classes that recognize the same metabolite as a known riboswitch class. The discovery of SAM-II
riboswitches in α-Proteobacteria [18], which are almost
devoid of SAM-I riboswitches, sets a precedent for this latter
scenario. The existence of a third SAM riboswitch in some lactic acid bacteria species [81], a subdivision of the Firmicutes,
suggests that new riboswitch classes may occupy empty regulatory niches that exist at an even finer taxonomic resolution.

Materials and methods
Computational analysis
In-house Perl scripts were used to organize the execution of
other software tools, compute various statistics, and maintain
local relational databases of genome and gene information.
Many of these scripts rely on Bioperl [82], and the
Bio::Graphics module was particularly useful for visualizing
the genomic contexts of riboswitch matches.

Riboswitch identification
Covariance models were trained on sequence alignments
adapted from various sources (Table 1) using the Infernal
software package (version 0.55) [83]. Heuristic filtering techniques [16] were used to accelerate CM searches of microbial
sequences in the RefSeq database (version 12) [84] and environmental shotgun sequences from an acid mine drainage
community [85], the Sargasso Sea [25], and Minnesota soil
and whale fall sites [86]. CM searches for TPP riboswitches
were also conducted against the plant and fungal portions of
the RefSeq database (version 13).
The regulatory potentials of putative riboswitch aptamers
were assessed by examining their genomic contexts. To uniformly predict gene functions, protein domains were assigned
to COGs (orthologous gene clusters) [87] using RPS-BLAST
and scoring matrices from the Conserved Domain Database
(CDD) [88]. The plausibility of putative aptamer structures
was assessed by computationally aligning hits to the original
CM with Infernal and manually examining divergent RNA
structures. Using these two complementary criteria, we
established trusted CM score cutoffs. All hits in the microbial

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/11/R239

Genome Biology 2007,

RefSeq database above these thresholds were judged to be
functional riboswitches. Since gene context information is
not available for most environmental sequences, hits from
these data sets were included only if they had CM scores
above the trusted threshold. Additional low-scoring
sequences from the RefSeq database were also included when
their genomic contexts and alignments strongly indicated
that they were functional riboswitches.
To verify that this approach efficiently recovers known riboswitches, the final results were compared to a list of TPP riboswitches compiled in a comparative genomics analysis of
thiamin metabolic genes and this regulatory RNA element
[48]. The new searches successfully found all TPP riboswitches that had been previously identified in the set of complete microbial genomes analyzed in both studies. They also
discovered a small number of TPP riboswitches upstream of
thiamin-related genes (for example, a pnuC homolog in Helicobacter pylori and thiM in Lactococcus lactis) in genomes
examined by the former study that had not yet been reported.
For the glycine riboswitch, a single aptamer covariance model
and a tandem model containing both the first and second
aptamers were used to separately identify matches. Every
aptamer that is part of a tandem configuration was found by
the single aptamer CM search, and cases of lone aptamers
were noted. For consensus structure and MI calculations only
the tandem glycine aptamer alignment was considered, but
the complete set of lone and tandem aptamer glycine
riboswitches were included in the expression platform analysis. Expression platform counts for other riboswitch classes
that rarely occur in tandem were not corrected.

Mechanism classification
Expression platforms were classified according to the scheme
in Figure 2 for a subset of the riboswitch matches found in
complete and unfinished microbial genomes. Aptamer
sequences with more than 95% pairwise identity at reference
columns (positions where ≥50% of the weighted sequences in
the alignment do not contain a gap) were omitted to avoid
biasing statistics with duplicate sequences. Riboswitches with
suspect gene annotations where >60 nucleotides (nt) of an
open reading frame (ORF) on the same strand overlapped the
aptamer or >700 nt separated the aptamer and the nearest
downstream ORF were also screened out. Most of these cases
appear to result from incorrect start codon choices, overpredictions of hypothetical ORFs, or missing annotation of real
genes. The remaining sequences constituted the expression
platform data set, and sequences beginning at the 5' end of
each aptamer and continuing through the first 120 nt of the
downstream ORF were extracted for further analysis.
Riboswitches where the downstream gene was on the opposite strand were examined as candidates for antisense regulation. Other riboswitches were classified as directly regulating
translation initiation when the downstream gene's start

codon was within 15 nt of the end of the conserved aptamer
core structure (usually the P1 paired element). The remaining
expression platforms were scanned with the local RNA secondary structure prediction program Rnall (version 1.1) [89]
for intrinsic transcription terminators with a scanning window of 50 nt, a U-tail weight threshold of 4.0, a U-tail pairing
stability cutoff of -8.3 kcal/mol, and default settings for other
parameters. Riboswitches with a terminator predicted in
their expression platform sequence were assigned transcription attenuation mechanisms. These riboswitches were classified as also regulating translation if the distance between
the terminator hairpin and the gene's start codon is no more
than 10 nt. Expression platforms that did not match any of the
above criteria are assumed to employ translation attenuation
mechanisms.
Rnall and distance parameters were calibrated by comparing
expression platform predictions to expert predictions for a
large and phylogenetically diverse collection of TPP riboswitches [48]. Rnall correctly predicts 46 out of 52 terminators
in this data set with only 3 predictions of terminators in
sequences not manually evaluated as containing a terminator
(a sensitivity of 88% and an accuracy of 94%). The three false
positives resemble terminators and may be functional,
whereas the terminators that Rnall misses usually have large
hairpins with poor thermodynamic stabilities. Overall, the
decision tree classifies 159 out of 180 TPP riboswitch expression platforms (88%) correctly into the category assigned in
the control set.

Consensus secondary structures
We manually adjusted the covariance model alignments of
riboswitch aptamers while refining their consensus secondary structures. In particular, bases taking part in pseudoknotted pairings that cannot be represented by CMs were shifted
to accurately represent these interactions. Bases flanking
gapped consensus columns, which are sometimes ambiguously spread out across many possible positions by the alignment algorithm, were also systematically condensed into a
minimum number of overall consensus columns. As new
structure motifs and base-base interactions became evident,
the alignments were adjusted to reflect these new constraints.
Riboswitch sequences in the final alignments were weighted
using Infernal's internal implementation of the GSC algorithm [90] to reduce biases from duplicate and similar
sequences before calculating consensus structure statistics.

Mutual information significance
Duplicate sequences were purged and columns with >50%
gaps were removed from riboswitch alignments prior to the
MI analysis, and, if necessary, alignments were further
pruned to the 300 most diverse sequences (as judged by pairwise base differences). A customized version of the program
Rate4Site (version 2.01) [91] with modified output options
was used to simultaneously estimate distances and per-column rates of evolution according to a gamma distributed

model with at least 16 rate categories and a phylogenetic tree
created with Jukes-Cantor distances that treated gaps as
missing information. The resulting trees, rates, and distances
were used to simulate 10,000 resampled alignments starting
from an arbitrary ancestral sequence. Then, gaps and
sequence weights were re-inserted into each of these derivative alignments at the same positions that they occupied in
the original alignment.

References

Mutual information was calculated between column pairs for
all alignments according to standard formulas [60], taking
into account sequence weights and treating gaps as a fifth
character state. The resampled alignments were used to estimate what the MI score distribution would have been if the
bases present in each column had evolved independently,
without covariation constraints. The p value significance of
the actual MI between two columns is the fraction of the resampled alignments that have a greater MI score than the value
observed between those two columns in the real alignment.
