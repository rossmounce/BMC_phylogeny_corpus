Abstract
Background: Although drug resistance is a major challenge in HIV therapy, the effect of drug
resistance mutations on HIV evolution in vivo is not well understood. We have now investigated
genetic heterogeneity in HIV-1 by performing drug resistance genotyping of the PR-RT regions of
viruses derived from plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a single patient
who had failed multiple regimens of anti-retroviral therapy.
Results: Patterns of drug resistance mutations showed that the viral populations in PBMCs were
more heterogeneous than in plasma. Extensive analysis of HIV from infected PBMCs in this patient
showed that high-level diversity existed among 109 cloned PR-RT sequences and that the majority
of mutations were related to drug resistance. Moreover, the PBMCs included archival species that
reflected the treatment history of the patient while those in plasma were mainly related to the most
recent treatment. Some of the proviral clones contained single or multiple mutations in various
combinations. Approximately eighteen percent of the proviral clones derived from infected PBMCs
were defective, i.e. 5.5% contained single nucleotide deletions (frameshift mutations) and 12.8%
encoded in-frame stop codons (nonsense mutations). Amino acid substitutions in PR and the
polymerase region of RT occurred in 12–15% of cases but were much less frequent in the RNase
H region of RT, which might not have been under drug selection pressure.
Conclusion: Selective drug pressure can yield multiple drug-resistant quasispecies that include
archival and replication-incompetent species in PBMC reservoirs.

Findings
HIV quasispecies within infected individuals can rapidly
adapt to hosts [1-7] due, in part, to variations in replicative fitness that enable some viruses to grow faster than
others[3,8]. This is of obvious clinical relevance, since
viral genetic changes can result in alterations in receptor
usage, escape from drug and host immune pressure, and
can impact on viral pathogenesis[9]. HIV-1 may also

evolve separately in different physiological compartments, e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
vs. the central nervous system[10]. Here, we report on an
individual who failed multiple antiviral therapies (ART),
including use of nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs).
After initiating therapy elsewhere with undisclosed regimens, the patient was treated in 1999 at the Jewish GenPage 1 of 6

eral Hospital, Montreal, Canada, with zidovudine (AZT)/
lamivudine (3TC)/efavirenz (EFV) plus unboosted indinavir (IDV) and nelfinavir (NFV) for 9 months and 3
months, respectively, and was switched to stavudine
(d4T)/3TC/amprenavir (APV) for 12 months, at which
time viral samples were obtained for resistance testing.
Viral RNA from plasma and proviral DNA from PBMCs
were purified using commercial kits (Qiagen, Mississauga,
ON, Canada). Initial HIV-1 genotyping was performed
using Trugene HIV-1 genotyping kits (Siemens Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada). All studied were performed
with approval of the Ethics Review Committee, Jewish
General Hospital.
The degree of quasispecies heterogeneity was higher in
PBMCs than in plasma
Mutations in PR and RT associated with drug resistance
were compared in plasma vs PBMCs. Both types of samples contained viruses with multiple primary (M46I/L,
G48V, I54V, V82A or L90M) and secondary resistance
mutations (e.g. L10I) in PR as well as multiple mutations
in RT (M41L, E44A, T69N, V118I, M184V, L210W, T215Y,
K219R for NRTIs) (A98G, K101E, V1081, Y181C and
G190A for NNRTIs) (Table 1). Both the plasma and
PBMC samples contained mixtures of mutations,
although some mutational motifs were only detected in
the PBMCs. For example, mixtures of 41K/R, 54I/V, 64I/V,
82V/A, 90M/I in PR and 181Y/C, 190A/G, 219K/R in RT
were identified in PBMCs but not in plasma. Conversely,
35D and 69N in PR and 108I in RT were detected only in
plasma but not PBMCs, as determined by genotyping.
These results were confirmed by clonal sequencing of
PBMC DNA. In general, viruses harbouring the unboosted
protease motif including L90M were exclusively present in
PBMCs. This is consistent with the fact that genotyping
often fails to detect minority species that are represented
at levels <10 to 35% in a given population [11].
Resistance-associated mutations in PR-RT clones reveal
heterogeneous viral populations within infected PBMCs
Viral genetic diversity in the infected PBMCs was analyzed
by randomly selecting and sequencing 109 clones of two
independent cloning efforts. Nested PCR was performed

to amplify the entire PR-RT region. One pair of primers,
forward 5'-ACTGAGAGACAGGCTAATTTTTTAGG and
backward 5'-TTGGGCCTTATCTATTTCCAT (Bio S&T,
Montreal, Canada) was used for the first round of PCR
using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) with 30 cycles of annealing at 55°C for 1 min and
extension at 72°C for 3 min. A second round of 25 cycle
PCR with primers (forward 5'-ACTATCCATGGTCCCTCAGATCACTCTTTGG and backward 5'-ACTAATTTGTCGACTTGTTCATTTCCTCC (Bio S&T)) was used to
generate a 2.1 kb DNA fragment spanning the PR and RT
genes. The sample was diluted 100 fold in the second
round PCR. The fragment was cloned into the Nco 1-Sal I
sites of a modified version of vector pTWIN2 (New England Biolabs, Toronto, Canada) by standard molecular
cloning methods. Positive clones were amplified and
sequenced using ABI fluorescence sequencing kits
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Analysis of
DNA sequences and protein translation were performed
with GeneTool software (BioTools Inc., Alberta, Canada).
All viral nucleotide positions were assigned based on differences from the HxB2 reference consensus sequence.
No wild-type (wt) PR or RT sequences were detected in
any of these clones, each of which contained a minimum
of 8 and a maximum of 12 mutations in PR and a minimum of 11 or a maximum of 19 mutations in RT. A total
of 15 mutations were present at resistance-associated sites
in PR among the 109 clones tested, while mixtures existed
at 9 of these sites. In regard to RT, a total of 19 resistance
mutations were detected, of which 11 were also present
within mixtures. The frequency of resistance motifs in
PBMCs are shown in Table 2. Thymidine analog mutations (TAMs, M41L, L210W, T215Y) were present in all
clones while 184V was detected in 81% of sequences. Two
reasons may explain the difference. First, the patient had
used thymidine analogues for a longer period than 3TC.
Second, viruses carrying TAMs are more fit than those with
M184V, and the latter mutation may have been under
selection pressure even in the presence of 3TC.
ART apparently influenced the emergence of multiple
resistance-associated quasispecies. Several PR secondary

a: The PR and RT genes of HIV-1 were amplified by nested PCR and cloned in E coli. The sequences of the clones were determined by BigDye dideoxyterminator sequencing.
HxB2 was used as a wild type reference.

resistance mutations were found in all of the quasispecies,
e.g. 10L, 16E, 37T, 48V, 60E, 63P, 77I. Other mutations
were found in only a portion of the PR sequences analyzed, i.e. 35D, 41K, 46I/L, 54V 69Y, 82A and 90M, compared with the HxB2 reference sequence, while the other
viruses sequenced were wt in regard to these positions.
The 82A and 90M mutations in PR were not found
together in any of the clones; neither were 35D and 41K
in PR, reflecting the fact that the switch from unboosted to
boosted PR inhibitors in the regimen selected for the 82A
mutational pathway as opposed to 90M, that represented
an archival species present in PBMCs rather than plasma.
Resistance-associated substitutions in RT were also found
in multiple combinations. 41L, 44A, 98G, 118I, 208I,
210W, 211R, 214F, 215Y, and 283I were found in all the
clones (Tables 2 &3). K101E/V108I and Y181C/G190A
were mostly present in paired fashion. The frequencies of
resistance-associated single substitutions that were only
detected in some quasispecies within RT were 74V, 108I,
181C, 184V, and 219R. Several sites contained two or
three different amino acid substitutions, i.e., 37T/37S,
46I/46L/46S, 63P/63H within PR and 44A/44T, 69N/
69A, 10lE/101Q, 102Q/102R, 190A/190T, 210W/210R/
210C, 211D/211E within RT (Table 2). These mixtures
may reflect a change from AZT-to d4T-containing regimens. PR had the highest variations of all the sequences
analyzed. The average pairwise nucleotide distances of the
viral quasispecies within the PBMCs of this patient were
0.022(0.024) for PR, 0.015 (0.012) for the N-terminal
220 amino acids of RT, 0.011(0.007) for the second part
of RT (amino acids 221–440) and 0.015(0.013) for RNase
H by Mega package (version 4.0) [12]. Numbers in brackets were obtained using the first and second nucleotides of
each codon.
Non resistance-associated substitutions in PR-RT
Variations also occurred at 4 sites within PR that are not
recognized as conferring drug resistance, i.e. P39S, I62V,
I64V and I72V. Of these, I64V might be pre-supposed to

be of biological significance as a secondary or compensatory mutation, since it was found to cluster together with
the 46L, 54V and 82A mutations associated with APV but
not 46I and 90M associated with the unboosted IDV and
NFV regimens, that were present in 45.8% of the 109
clones analyzed. In the case of RT, prevalent substitutions
included V35I, K43E, E122K, S162D, K166R, D177E,
E203K, K223Q, L228R, I293V, P294Q, I326V, Q334E,
P345Q, A355G, R356K I375V, T376A, T377Q and T400A.
A158P, R206S and G359S also appeared at relatively low
frequency (i.e. 6%–17%) and in a dispersed pattern, i.e.
not as a cluster. By way of comparison, we also analyzed
the RNase H region of RT and found that variability was
slight, with 3 substitutions present among 90 amino acids
at its N terminus in all clones, i.e. L452S, N460D, and
N519S (519S is, in fact, the consensus amino acid among
subtype B viruses although N519 is present within HxB2).
Various frequencies were detected for V466M (24.8%),
V467I (20.2%), Y483H (54.1%) and N514S (22%); these
substitutions, in fact, are naturally present among various
HIV-l subtypes and were probably not selected in the
patient. V466M was found to be dispersed yet clustered
with Y483H. V4671, Y483H and N514S did not co-exist
within any of the clones that were studied. Thus, only 3 to
6 substitutions were identified within RNase H, suggesting that viral evolution had occurred more slowly in this
region than in the similarly sized PR region, reflecting differences in drug selection pressure. Although RT inhibitors have been reported to affect RNase H, no mutations
in RNase H were identified in our recent report [13].
Frameshift and nonsense mutations
HIV-1 RT may commonly introduce addition/deletion
and/or stop codons into the HIV-1 genome that result, in
turn, in an accumulation of defective quasispecies. Our
results suggest that defective viral particles may have represented a substantial proportion of viruses within the
patient whose samples were analyzed. Of the 109 clones,
6 (5.5%) contained single nucleotide deletions; all of

these were located at or near the poly A and C tracts at
which RT is believed to be especially error-prone. In-frame
nonsense mutations were found at greater frequency, i.e.
in 3.7% of cases in PR and in 9.2% of cases in RT. About
18% of the HIV-1 clones analyzed appeared to be defective in PR and/or RT and would be expected to yield noninfectious particles. Defective quasispecies constitute a

high proportion of HIV-l particles in infected individuals.
Previous reports showed that sequences in uncultured vs
cultured PBMCs can be different[14]. 18% of the
sequences analyzed in our study were defective in either
PR or RT, similar to other reports that examined the vif
gene[15]. Since the size of the HIV-1 genome is greater
than PR-RT, we would expect that the proportion of defec-

tive particles produced within an infected individual
might be much higher than 18%. Previous results had
shown that only one of 10 proviral clones derived from an
infected brain sample had the ability to replicate in tissue
culture[16]. The significance of defective viruses in HIV
pathogenesis should be further investigated.
Evolutionary relationships among clones
The 109 cloned sequences from PBMCs were genetically
related but existed as distinct quasispecies. Only three
identical pairs were detected among the 109 clones. Phylogenetic tree analysis of PR sequences suggested that the
majority of PBMC quasispecies belonged to 2 distinct
groups. Considering the fact that most mutations were
synonymous, we further examined protein sequences. In
general, the clones could be assigned into 4 groups and 31
subgroups (Table 3). The 82A, 90M, 46I/L, 54V and 64V
mutations within PR were important in assignment of the
clones to groups, i.e. A-D. Genotyping of plasma viral
RNA only detected 82A (Table 1) while proviral DNA
clones from PBMCs revealed that about half of them contained either 82A (54.2%) or 90 M (45.8%)(Table 2).
These findings indicate the existence of two distinct protease resistance pathways. Table 3 shows that clusters
existed among PR46I/90M for group A, PR46L/54V/64V/
82A for group B, PR46L/90M for group C, and PR46I/82A
for group D, and that 89.9% of the samples belonged to
group A (40.4%) or B (49.5%), while groups C and D represented 5.5% and 4.6% of samples, respectively.

Phylogenetic tree analysis of RT suggested that the PBMC
quasispecies were closely related, different from HxB2
(not shown). An analysis of drug resistance mutations
showed that M184V might exist alone while others mutations usually co-existed with other mutations in the quasispecies (Table 3). The major quasispecies within the
PBMCs were subgroups containing PR4IK/46I/90M/
RT184V and PR41K/46L/54V/82A/RT184V, and these
were represented at 18.3% and 10.1%, respectively (Table
3).
No apparent relationship existed between resistance-associated mutations in the PR vs. RT genes (Table 3), reflecting the fact that they emerged independently during
therapy. In contrast, relationships did exist in regard to
mutations within either PR or RT. For example, all the PR
sequences contained either 82A or 90 M but not both,
while 46L/54V/64V clustered mostly with 82A and 46I
clustered mostly with 90 M, i.e., groups A and B. Either
41K or 35D, but not both, occurred alongside 90 M or
82A. In the case of RT, 184V or 181C/190A/219R might
have emerged independently since both were detected.
When combined with the 4 patterns of mutations in PR,
i.e. 35D/46I/90M, 41K/46I/90M, 35D/46L/54V/64V/82A
and 41K/46L/54V/64V/82A, it appears as though 8 dis-

tinct lineages might have existed in this subject from
which quasispecies might have been derived. For example, RT181C/184V/190A/219R might have emerged from
181C/190A/219R while RT101E/108I/181C/184V/190A/
219R might have emerged from RT181C/184V/190A/
219R. In this regard, there was a 3 month interruption in
the use of efavirenz (March to June, 1998) that might have
contributed to the selective development of the two distinct NNRTI resistance pathways.
The low frequencies of groups C and D suggest that they
might have been generated as a result of recombination
within the PR region with the cross-over site potentially
being between positions 46 and 82. To reduce the possibility of recombination during PCR, we diluted our samples during the second PCR and limited the number of
cycles. A control reaction, that employed a mixture of
known DNAs, containing wt or mutated PR-RT mutations, revealed that the recombination rate was lower than
3 percent in our experiments (not shown). Several quasispecies re RT might also have been generated through
recombination, e.g. RT69N/101E/108I/181C/184V/
190A/219R. Variant PR41K/46L/54V/64V/90M could
have emerged from PR4IK/46L/54V/64V/82A and 41K/
46I/90M crossed over between positions 64 and 82. The
RT variant, RT69N/101E/108I/181C/184V/190A/219R
could have been generated by the crossing over of
RT181C/184V/190A/219R and RT69N/101E/108I/184V
between positions 108 and 181.
Infection by HIV is a highly dynamic process, with viral
turnover rates being as high as 1010 particles per day[17].
Although PBMCs are probably not the most important
site of viral replication in the body[18], they are important
in viral spread and represent a source of virus particles that
are found in plasma. Hence, PBMCs carry information
about the evolutionary process of HIV infection while not
necessarily reflecting the majority of viral species at any
point in time. Our results are consistent in that we were
able to detect certain resistance-associated mutations in
plasma, e.g. RT69N, even though this mutation was represented at a level of only 10.2% in cloned sequences and
was not detectable in PBMCs by genotyping. The emergence of RT69N was related to the addition of d4T to the
treatment regimen. Interestingly, quasispecies carrying
PR46I and PR46L were detected at almost equal frequencies in PBMCs (Table 2), and quasispecies containing
PR90M and PR46I constituted about half of the viral population in PBMCs but were undetectable in plasma by
genotyping. This may be attributed to archival quasispecies identified in PBMCs, as compared to the more recent
plasma circulating species.
Dominant quasispecies in plasma represented only a
small proportion of those detected in PBMCs, and might

reflect the type of drug employed, e.g. RT69N emerged following use of d4T and 3TC (subgroup 16–21 of Table 3).
Dominance of PR46L/54V/64V/82A in plasma and disappearance of PR46I/90M from plasma might be related to
a switch in treatment from unboosted IDV and NFV to
APV, since PR46I and PR90M are primary mutations for
IDV and NFV, respectively, but not for APV. The crystal
structure of a multiply mutated HIV-1 PR including 46I,
82A, 90M reveals an expanded active site cavity compared
to that of wild type[19]. Quasispecies carrying PR46I/90M
combined with other mutations, i.e. 10I/16E/37T/48V/
63P/77I, are probably not as replication-competent as
PR46L/48V/54V/64V/82A under APV pressure.
In our study, wt sequences in regard to PR or RT were not
detected in any of 109 clones. However besides 3 identical
pairs, 98% (106/109) of these sequences were related but
different. All could be divided into about 31 subgroups,
with resistance mutations existing in different combinations. The existence of large quasispecies can serve as reservoirs for the emergence of viral species resistant to
different drugs, since infected cells might survive for several years [20,21]. Our results on uncultured, infected
PBMCs are representative of only a tiny fraction of in vivo
infection but indicate an astonishingly high degree of heterogeneity in regard to resistance.
