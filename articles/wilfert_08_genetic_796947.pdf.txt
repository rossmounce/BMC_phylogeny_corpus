Abstract
Background: The antagonistic co-evolution of hosts and their parasites is considered to be a
potential driving force in maintaining host genetic variation including sexual reproduction and
recombination. The examination of this hypothesis calls for information about the genetic basis of
host-parasite interactions – such as how many genes are involved, how big an effect these genes
have and whether there is epistasis between loci. We here examine the genetic architecture of
quantitative resistance in animal and plant hosts by concatenating published studies that have
identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for host resistance in animals and plants.
Results: Collectively, these studies show that host resistance is affected by few loci. We
particularly show that additional epistatic interactions, especially between loci on different
chromosomes, explain a majority of the effects. Furthermore, we find that when experiments are
repeated using different host or parasite genotypes under otherwise identical conditions, the
underlying genetic architecture of host resistance can vary dramatically – that is, involves different
QTLs and epistatic interactions. QTLs and epistatic loci vary much less when host and parasite
types remain the same but experiments are repeated in different environments.
Conclusion: This pattern of variability of the genetic architecture is predicted by strong
interactions between genotypes and corroborates the prevalence of varying host-parasite
combinations over varying environmental conditions. Moreover, epistasis is a major determinant
of phenotypic variance for host resistance. Because epistasis seems to occur predominantly
between, rather than within, chromosomes, segregation and chromosome number rather than
recombination via cross-over should be the major elements affecting adaptive change in host
resistance.

Background
The interaction of hosts with their parasites is strongly
affected by genotype [1] as shown, for example, by the
interactions between host and parasite genotypes [2], the
potential for increased parasite resistance by artificial
selection [3], the direct identification of single genes [4],
the molecular signature of selection in wild populations

[5], and the improvement of resistance by genetic engineering [6]. Although these observations demonstrate the
genetic basis of an interaction between host and parasite,
typically they are silent about how the respective genes are
arranged on the genome and whether and how they interact – they tell us little about the "genetic architecture" of
loci involved in the interaction with parasites.

The genetic architecture of host resistance is closely linked
to the evolution and ecological dynamics of host-parasite
interactions. Sexual reproduction, for example, affects the
combinations of genes that are involved in resistance to
parasites in two different ways. First, pairs of genes located
on the same chromosome are affected by meiotic recombination when crossing-over occurs between sister chromatids. This leads to an exchange of genetic material, such
that new gene combinations are passed on to offspring.
Second, pairs of genes located on different chromosomes
are affected by segregation. In this process, sister chromosomes segregate and re-arrange themselves into new combinations in offspring. Whether or not such
rearrangements in general improve or reduce the fitness of
offspring, and whether a modifier coding for recombination and/or segregation can spread in a population, is a
matter of ongoing debate (e.g. [7,8]). Furthermore, the a
priori likelihood of any locus to be co-located with
another relevant locus on the same chromosome depends
on the organism's karyotype (the number of chromosomes). Hence, the genetic architecture of traits is of considerable interest as it affects host-parasite evolutionary
interactions in many – albeit not fully understood – ways.
These questions call for a better knowledge of the genetic
architecture of resistance, that is the number, effect size
and interaction of loci determining resistance to parasites,
as well as their genomic distribution. Today, this information can be provided by studies identifying the quantitative genetic basis of host resistance via a search for
quantitative trait loci (QTL, table 1). In this process, a
given "mapping population" (a set of individuals from
defined genetic backgrounds, such as offspring of the
same pedigree) is analysed such that the phenotype of
interest (e.g. the level of resistance against a given infection) is measured for each individual. If the genotypes of
these individuals are known, the phenotype can be statistically mapped onto a genetic linkage map. In this way, it
is possible to locate "genes" of interest – QTLs representing small genomic regions – on a genetic map. QTLs are
loci that account for a significant fraction of the phenotypic variation.
We have analysed the architecture of plant and animal
parasite resistance as revealed in QTL studies. We use the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/187

identified QTLs to extract basic insights into how host
resistance to parasites is genetically arranged on the
genome. In a previous study, Kover and Caicedo [9] analysed QTLs for plant parasite resistance; they concluded
that parasite resistance in plants is based on multiple loci,
and found several cases where genetic interactions among
loci – i.e. epistasis – substantially affected host resistance.
In this study, we considerably expand the scope for fundamental questions about the genetic architecture of resistance by considering in detail the relevance of epistasis, as
well as the persistence of the genetic architecture across
different environmental factors and particular host-parasite associations.

Results
Our study includes data from 194 publications (see Table
2, Table 3, and Additional file 1), representing a total of
500 QTL experiments. The studied host species cover a
wide range of animals and plants. Among plants, the
focus on crops reflects the importance of the genetic basis
of resistance traits for use in marker-assisted breeding programs (Table 2). With the exception of one experiment
[10], all experiments included a search for additive QTLs;
epistatic interactions between these additive loci were
examined in 86 experiments, with a further 62 cases in
which the whole genome was scanned for epistatic interactions (i.e. in addition to the additive loci) (Table 3).
Number of additive QTL and explained variance
We found that different studies revealed very different
genetic architectures of host defence. The genetic basis of
host resistance as described by additive QTLs (i.e. those
representing the additive genetic effects) differs significantly between studies of animal (n = 55 populations)
and plant hosts (n = 445 populations). Overall, additive
QTLs were reported in 95.8% of all studies, that is, in 53
of 55 studies on animals and in 425 of 444 studies on
plant hosts. The number of additive QTLs per mapping
experiment ranged from 0 to 13 loci in plant hosts and 0
to 6 loci in animals. Accordingly, QTL studies of plant
host resistance found significantly more QTLs on average
than studies on animal hosts (number of QTLs: NQTL_plants
= 3.24 ± 2.22 vs. NQTL_animals = 2.47 ± 1.18; Wilcoxon-test,
Z = -1.973, n = 499, P < 0.05, Figure 1). Also, additive
QTLs explained a higher proportion of the phenotypic

Quantitative trait locus; a genetic locus whose alleles differentially affect a quantitative phenotype such as
resistance to a parasite. The combined effect of additive QTL is equal to the sum of their individual effects. For the
purpose of this study, we do not differentiate between purely additive, dominant and recessive QTL.
A non-additve interaction of genetic loci determining a phenotype, that is the combined effect of different alleles at
these loci is different from the sum of the individual loci.
Simple interval mapping tests whether an interval between two markers is significantly associated with a QTL.
Both methods combine simple interval mapping with multiple regression. By thus controlling for the effects of
other loci, these approaches allow for the accurate detection of multiple QTL defining a trait.

(phenotypic variation explained: PVEplants = 48.66%,
PVEanimals = 33.03%; Z = -4.264, n = 444, P < 0.0001). To
minimize the potential overestimation of phenotypic variation, this average is based on the total phenotypic variation explained by all significant QTL as determined by
multiple regression where available; for those experiments in which only the PVE of individual QTLs is

reported, we use the sum of all QTLs. Every individual

tional locus added less to the total (Explained variance per
QTL: Spearman r = -0.61, P < 0.0001, n = 411), while we
found no such relationship for animals (Spearman r = 0.0576, P = 0.581, n = 43). As a note of caution, the difference between plant and animal studies may be caused by
differences in methodology, i.e. different crossing designs
and the use of different statistical packages for estimating
phenotypic variance. However, the difference in phenotypic variance appears to be robust across these criteria
and these methodical aspects are thus unlikely to cloud
the picture.

Digenic epistatic effects
In the published studies, epistatic effects were analysed
either between the previously identified additive QTLs
only, or in the context of a whole genome scan. The latter
therefore can uncover epistatic interactions between loci
that otherwise did not rank as additive QTLs. Overall, for
epistatic interactions, we found no difference between
studies on animal and plant host resistance and therefore
only report the pooled results. (i) Epistatic interactions
between the additive QTLs were reported in 45.3% of
cases (39 of 86 studies). A total of 28.5% of all additive
QTLs were involved in epistatic interactions, and an aver-

age of 0.7 pair-wise interactions were found per study. (ii)
With a genome-wide scan, epistatic interactions were
found in 77.4% of studies (48 of 62 cases). An average of
1.9 pair-wise interactions was found per study and 25.3%
of all additive QTLs were found to be involved in epistatic
interactions. More importantly, 72.4% of epistatic loci
had not been identified as additive QTLs (123 of 170 epistatic loci). In other words, considering only the additive
QTLs (as is done in the first class of studies) massively
underestimates (approximately by a factor of three) the
number of epistatic interactions, as compared to whole
genome scans. In fact, the extent of epistatic variance does
not correlate with the amount of variance explained by
the additive QTLs for either plants or animals ((Spearman
r = 0.021, P = 0.82, n = 122). Note that from these studies,
the sign of epistasis is difficult to assess because there is no
a priori defined wildtype genotype.
Co-location of loci on chromosomes or linkage groups
In many studies, at least two QTLs are co-located together
on one chromosome or, respectively, one linkage group.
In those studies – where more than one locus was
reported analysing either only additive QTLs or additionally including epistatic interactions between these QTL –
at least two co-located loci were found in 21.8% (n = 271
studies) and 37.2% (n = 78) of cases, respectively. In studies that included a genome-wide search for epistatic interactions, around half of the studies reported at least one
pair of co-located loci (51.7%, n = 58). Of all loci mentioned in these studies, and combining additive QTLs and
epistatic loci, a total of 22.0% are co-located with another
locus on the same linkage group (n = 1'629 loci). However, an epistatic effect within the same linkage group was
reported only in one study [11]. This study showed an
interaction of two loci on linkage group three in two
experiments on the infection severity of Cucumber mosaic
virus on Capsicum annuum carried out at two different
study sites. With the data set presented in this study, we
could not determine whether the distribution of QTLs
across linkage groups deviates from random, for example,
whether QTLs would be clumped on some linkage groups
rather than others. This is because there are typically either
not enough QTLs in a given study population to be able
to generate a statistically non-random distribution for the
number of available linkage groups, or there are not
enough linkage groups to accommodate the available
QTLs in a way that can significantly deviate from random.
Recovery of QTLs and epistatic interactions in different
experiments
QTL studies often report the genetic basis of host resistance to a particular parasite under different conditions,
i.e. when the experiment was repeated at different study
sites, or involved different host or parasite genotypes. We
asked whether additive QTLs or the pairs of loci involved

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/187

in epistatic interactions identified for a certain host-parasite combination in one experiment are identical to those
reported for another experiment within the same study.
Typically experiments would differ in environmental condition or the particular host and parasite line used (from
within the same host and parasite species). For example,
many studies include several QTL experiments that – all
else being equal – were carried out at different study sites
or in different years. To ensure that the experiments were
indeed comparable, we only include experiments carried
out within the same study system, using identical phenotypic measurements and statistics.
We distinguish three categories of ways of repeating the
QTL experiment under otherwise identical conditions: (1)
Experiments conducted on identical pairs of host line and
parasite isolate but in different years, environments or
locations (factor "Environment" is varied). Furthermore,
we distinguish between (2) experiments differing either in
host line ("Host") or (3) parasite isolate ("Parasite"). For
every comparison, we included only experiments that differed in a single factor; we further restricted the analysis to
studies on plant hosts, since the available studies on animals were only ever repeated in different host genetic
backgrounds but not years, environments or parasite
lines. For each possible pair within a category we then
checked for the recovery of the additive QTLs or epistatic
loci.
Comparing pairs of additive QTLs, recovery rate was significantly higher when the same host-parasite pair was
tested in different environments than when different parasite isolates or host lines were used (Table 4, Figure 2).
For studies including more than two repeated experiments, due to a limited sample size, we here considered
all pairwise comparisons among experiments as independent of each other. With this proviso, we found a similar pattern as above in that differences in environmental
factors were associated with higher recovery of loci
(58.4%, n = 27) than differences in host (Host: 42.9%, n
= 6) or parasite (28.7%, n = 115) lines used (χ2 = 14.48, P
< 0.001). While sample sizes were inevitably smaller for
digenic epistatic interactions, recovery was again much
higher for studies done in different environments (72.5%,
n = 10) as compared to those using different parasite isolates (0%, n = 4) or host lines (0.09%, n = 1, χ2 = 10.2, P
< 0.01).
Karyotype
The number of chromosomes (karyotype) varies considerably between species and sometimes between populations of the same species. Here, we assume that the
karyotype sets a constraint for the observed variation in
segregation and recombination, i.e. the karyotype is not

itself selected for a given distribution of parasite-related
genes.
We found that the karyotype did not correlate with the
number of additive QTLs in either plants or animals
(plants: Spearman's rs = 0.008, P = 0.87, n = 444; animals:
rs = 0.18, P = 0.192, n = 55). However, overall, the number
of epistatic interactions increased with the number of
chromosomes (rs = 0.284, P = 0.0002, N = 147), and so
did the number of digenic loci that were found (rs = 0.301,
P = 0.0002, N = 147). When asking how many QTLs did
co-locate on the same chromosome, we found that there
was a significant negative correlation between the number
of chromosomes and the number of co-located loci, as
well as with the ratio of co-located loci to isolated loci per
study (number of co-located loci: Spearman's rs = -0.119,
P = 0.017; Ratio: rs = -0.150, P = 0.003, N = 404).

Discussion
The large number of studies that have used the QTL technique to identify and locate genes or small genetic regions
that explain observed variation in resistance to parasites
offers a window into the genetic architecture of resistance
traits. The available studies cover a wide range of taxa,

from plants to protozoa, fungi, and to animals. Even
though a total of n = 500 studies were included here, no
attempt was made to account for phylogenetic dependencies, since for any one taxon the number of studies would
be too small and the relevant large-scale phylogeny has
often not been sufficiently ascertained. Instead, we consider our results as providing a snapshot into the genetic
architecture of disease resistance – such as how many loci
are involved, where are they located and whether there are
any interactions.
Our results are in broad accordance with a previous study
on plant QTLs [9]. We found that resistance is typically
based on a limited number of loci (Fig. 1) and that additive QTLs explain a considerable proportion of the
observed phenotypic variation. While this is a robust finding, one needs to bear in mind that QTL studies are inherently biased towards an underestimation of the number of
involved loci, while overestimating the effect of identified
QTLs [12]. It is interesting to note that studies on animal
host resistance generally found fewer additive QTLs,
which explained less of the total phenotypic variance,
than studies on plant resistance. No such difference was
found for the epistatic interactions. It should be noted
that this difference might be caused by methodological
differences. Whereas a limited sample size is frequently a
concern in animal studies, studying plant cultivars offers
the opportunity of creating very large datasets from controlled crosses. Thus, the power to detect QTL may potentially be somewhat higher in the available studies on plant
hosts. In addition, there is some variation in the QTL
mapping algorithms used in different studies. A large proportion of plant studies use composite-interval-mapping
[13], whereas multiple-QTL-mapping [14] is comparatively more common in the animal studies analysed here.
While both methods rely on combining simple interval
methods with multiple regression (see table 1), their
implementation in software packages is not identical,

which can lead to slightly different results in practice (e.g.
[15]). In spite of this pattern, there are no clear-cut methodological differences between studies on animal and
plant hosts. Thus, our results raise the possibility that the
genetic architecture of resistance may indeed differ
between animals and plants. For example, animal resistance may involve many loci of small effect that remained
undetected in these studies.
Our analysis shows that epistatic interactions are a major
component of the genetic architecture of parasite resistance. Across studies, the variance explained by epistasis is
not correlated to the additive variance. Epistatic interactions add a substantial, if not a major, amount of
explained variance. Hence, we conclude that by ignoring
epistatic interactions, the quantitative genetic basis of
resistance would be massively underestimated. Similarly,
there is in general little overlap between the QTLs identified as additive loci and those associated with epistatic
interactions. Even though this difference may be partly
due to the method of QTL-identification, the findings collectively suggest that disease resistance is strongly affected
by epistatically interacting loci that are not additive loci.
With respect to the location of the QTLs, we find that at
least two QTLs are regularly located on the same chromosome or linkage group. However, typically, these loci are
additive QTLs, while only in one of 148 experiments an
epistatic interaction within a linkage group was reported.
It must be noted that there is a bias against discovering
epistatic interactions between closely linked loci due to
the limited statistical power of the method. Nevertheless,
the data suggest that epistatic interactions occur to an
important extent between loci on different linkage groups
or chromosomes. Furthermore, for some of the species in
which epistatic interactions have been reported (Avena
sativa, Brassica napus, Capsicum annuum, Cucumis melo,
Linum usitatissimum and Bombus terrestris) some of the currently described linkage groups will eventually be merged
into a single chromosome as the resolution of the linkage
map improves. But given the strong tendency for betweenrather than within-chromosome epistasis, these reservations are unlikely to substantially change the above conclusion. Hence, we suggest that epistatic interactions will
mostly be affected by segregation of chromosomes rather
than by within-chromosome recombination. As a consequence, karyotype will play an important role for the
effect of these two different processes on the combination
of QTLs in offspring. Indeed, the number of epistatic
interactions increases with the number of chromosomes.
Finally, we also find that the identity of the involved QTLs
is unstable. In those cases, where the same organism was
studied repeatedly, either with different host-parasite line
combinations, or in different years, environments or loca-

tions, the recovery rate of the QTLs was very poor. In fact,
as a rule, different QTLs show up in different experiments
even though they all pertain to resistance against the same
parasite species. This phenomenon of "shifting loci" is
well known from plant breeding, where it is an obstacle to
marker-assisted breeding efforts [16]. Shifting loci also
add to the variance in epistatic interactions. Shifting epistatic interactions can also be found experimentally; a
recent study by Pepin and Wichman [17] on host recognition sites in a bacteriophage showed that there is not only
variation in the involved loci but also in the sign of epistasis in different environments and when interacting with
different host genotypes. At least in theory, such variance
in epistatic interactions reduces the effects of selection for
increased recombination [18]. But as Kouyos et al. [19]
have shown, even few interactions with weak effect as
observed in the studies we surveyed may drive recombination, rather than the average epistasis of all interactions.

Conclusion
We found that loci shift more – that is, loci can be recovered less frequently – when the particular combination of
the host-parasite lines is changed (i.e. the respective
genetic background changes) as compared to the higher
recovery when the environment is changed (for the identical host-parasite combination). As far as the genetic
architecture of quantitative variation in resistance is concerned, this difference shows that environmental variation may not always override the effect of variation in
parasites [20]. Indeed, it corroborates the importance of
genotypic interactions in host-parasite systems.
Our evaluation of published QTL-studies suggests that the
genetic architecture of parasite resistance gives epistasis an
important role, especially where it occurs between chromosomes, and that these effects are highly variable across
different host-parasite pairings. Furthermore, these epistatic interactions are primarily affected by segregation
and chromosome number, rather than by recombination
via cross-over within a chromosome. Such constraints set
by the genetic architecture of parasite resistance should
have major effects on the evolution and maintenance of
segregation (i.e. of sex per se) and within-chromosome
recombination.

Methods
Using the Web of Science [21], we screened the published
literature for studies that have taken a QTL approach to
reveal the genetic basis of host resistance or susceptibility.
To maximise consistency and comparability in the
extracted data, we include only studies that fulfilled the
two following criteria. (1) Studies had to employ interval
mapping or similar methods, e.g. composite interval mapping or multiple-QTL-model mapping, resulting in precise information on the number and location of QTLs.

Studies using less precise non-parametric or not generally
recognized genetic mapping approaches were excluded to
maximise comparability. (2) The screen for QTLs had to
encompass the entire available genome, and not limit
itself to certain candidate genes or genetic areas of interest.
Many studies investigate the genetic architecture of host
defence using several independent experiments or for several traits. If a study reports the genetic architecture of a
trait measured under different environmental conditions
(e.g. if the host-parasite interaction was assayed in different years or locations) or with different combinations of
host or parasite lines, the results of each experiment were
included as independent data points in the present dataset. Frequently, several traits were measured in the same
experiment, for example disease severity in several tissues.
In this situation, we included only one trait per experiment, by choosing prior to the analyses the trait that is
expected to be most relevant in a host-parasite co-evolution scenario (for example parasite load would be more
informative than secondary disease symptoms, and survival time after infection would be more important than
measures of the magnitude of the immune response).
The data compiled for this study consists of count data
with a limited range (number of QTLs, epistatic interactions and chromosomes) or percentages (explained phenotypic variation, recovery rate of loci between
experiments). To accommodate this data structure, we
have used standard non-parametric tests throughout the
analyses.
