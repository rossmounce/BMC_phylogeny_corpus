Analysis and comparison of the pan-genomic
properties of sixteen well-characterized bacterial
genera

Abstract
Background: The increasing availability of whole genome sequences allows the gene or protein content of
different organisms to be compared, leading to burgeoning interest in the relatively new subfield of pan-genomics.
However, while several studies have analyzed protein content relationships in specific groups of bacteria, there has
yet to be a study that provides a general characterization of protein content relationships in a broad range of
bacteria.
Results: A variation on reciprocal BLAST hits was used to infer relationships among proteins in several groups of
bacteria, and data regarding protein conservation and uniqueness in different bacterial genera are reported in
terms of “core proteomes”, “unique proteomes”, and “singlets”. We also analyzed the relationship between protein
content similarity and the percent identity of the 16S rRNA gene in pairs of bacterial isolates from the same genus,
and found that the strength of this relationship varied substantially depending on the genus, perhaps reflecting
different rates of genome evolution and/or horizontal gene transfer. Finally, core proteomes and unique proteomes
were used to study the proteomic cohesiveness of several bacterial species, revealing that some bacterial species
had little cohesiveness in their protein content, with some having fewer proteins unique to that species than
randomly-chosen sets of isolates from the same genus.
Conclusions: The results described in this study aid our understanding of protein content relationships in different
bacterial groups, allowing us to make further inferences regarding genome-environment relationships, genome
evolution, and the soundness of existing taxonomic classifications.

Background
Historically, taxonomic analyses have been performed
using a diverse and often arbitrary selection of morphological and phenotypic characteristics. Today, these characteristics are generally considered unsuitable for
generating reliable and consistent taxonomies for prokaryotes, as there is no rational basis for choosing which
morphological or phenotypic properties should be examined. Moreover, it is doubtful that individual phenotypes
or small collections of phenotypes can consistently and
correctly represent evolutionary relationships [1]. The

unsuitability of phenotypic traits, along with the advent
of DNA sequencing, has led to 16S rRNA gene sequence
comparisons becoming the standard technique for taxonomic analyses [1], although it has been argued that the
cpn60 gene allows for greater evolutionary discrimination
[2]. Over time, the trend has moved toward using a
greater number of genes to infer phylogenetic relationships–in part due to the increasing ease and reduced cost
associated with DNA sequencing, but also due to doubts
about the accuracy of evolutionary relationships inferred
from a single gene. Phylogeny can be inferred from a
number of universally conserved housekeeping genes
using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) [3,4].
While 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and MLSA
have proven to be effective tools for phylogenetics, a
major deficiency inherent in these techniques is that
only a small amount of information is used to represent

an entire organism. This practice has largely been
accepted due to the time and cost of genome sequencing. However, recent improvements in sequencing
technology have substantially reduced the resources
necessary to sequence a genome, and there are now
numerous genome sequences available in publicly accessible databases. The accelerating pace of genome
sequencing provides the opportunity to explore the use
of entire genomes in analyzing evolutionary
relationships.
Numerous approaches to determining relatedness via
whole genomes have been devised (reviewed in [5]), with
examples being dinucleotide frequencies [6], G + C
content [7], codon usage [8,9], gene order [10], and oligopeptide composition [11,12]. Yet another approach to
whole-genome phylogenetics is the comparison of gene
content. This technique works by predicting orthologues
in pairs of organisms and then assigning a “distance”
between each pair based on the putative number of shared
genes. This technique was originally proposed by Snel et
al. [13] and was subsequently revisited with larger groups
of organisms [14,15]. However, horizontal gene transfer is
a major complicating factor in using these methods to
infer evolutionary relationships in prokaryotes [16].
Recently, a new subfield called pan-genomics has
become established as a framework for exploring the
genomic relatedness of bacterial groups. Unlike the studies cited in the previous paragraph, pan-genomics does
not involve inferring phylogeny from genome content;
rather, it encompasses broad-based characterizations of
gene- or protein-content relationships in a given group
of organisms. Pan-genomics was introduced by Tettelin
et al. [17], who sequenced several strains of the bacterium Streptococcus agalactiae and then analyzed the
genomic diversity of those isolates in terms of a “core
genome” (genes present in all isolates) and a “dispensable genome” (genes not present in all isolates). Two
more examples of pan-genomic analyses are those done
for Vibrio [18] and for Escherichia coli [19]. Review articles summarizing concepts and developments in microbial pan-genomics are also available [20,21].
Despite the increasing interest in pan-genomics, we do
not know of a study providing a general characterization
and comparison of gene/protein content relationships in
many different bacterial groups. To fill this gap, this
study reports the results of several different analyses that
compare the protein content of different bacteria. When
beginning this study, we were faced with the choice of
comparing either gene content or protein content. Both
have been examined in previous work; for example, Tettelin et al. [17] studied both gene sets and predicted protein sets, whereas Rasko et al. [19] used predicted
proteins exclusively. For two reasons, we chose to explore
protein content rather than gene content. First, since

Page 2 of 18

protein content is more directly related to function and
physiology than gene content, the use of protein content
was more appropriate for relating pan-genomic properties to factors like habitats, environmental niches, and
selective pressures. Second, since we perform comparisons across diverse genera, the lower level of variability
in protein sequences compared to gene sequences (due
to the degeneracy of the genetic code) may provide an
advantage when using BLAST to compare the more
divergent organisms. The popularity of tools such as
tblastx [22,23] also speaks to the desirability of comparing gene sequences via the corresponding proteins.
While we expect the use of gene content versus protein
content to yield largely similar results, the reader should
be aware that there could be some differences.
This paper communicates the results of three major
analyses, with the first two involving protein content
comparisons at the genus level, and the third involving
comparisons at the species level. In the first analysis, we
quantify and analyze the number of proteins (i.e. orthologues) found in all members of a given bacterial genus
(its “core proteome”), the number of proteins found in
one genus, but in none of the other genera used in this
study (its “unique proteome”), and the number of proteins found in only a single isolate of a genus (“singlets”). The second analysis examines the relationship
between protein content similarity and 16S rRNA gene
percent identity in pairs of bacterial isolates from the
same genus. Finally, the third analysis examines several
bacterial species to determine whether their proteomes
are more cohesive than randomly-selected sets of isolates from the same genus. For the third analysis, we
use an operational definition of “cohesion”. Specifically,
we say that a bacterial species is proteomically cohesive
if it satisfies two criteria: first, that its core proteome is
larger than those of randomly-selected groups of isolates
from the same genus; and second, that it contains more
proteins unique to all members of that species than
there are proteins unique to randomly-selected groups
of isolates from the same genus.

Results and Discussion
Proteomes used

Sixteen genera met the requirements outlined in the
Methods section, comprising a total of 211 isolates from
106 species. Table 1 shows the number of isolates and
species used for each genus, while additional file 1 provides more detailed information about each individual
isolate (i.e. genus, species, strain/isolate identity, proteome size, and genome size).
Orthologue detection

To detect orthologues, we used a variation on the reciprocal BLAST hits (RBH) method. Specifically, for two

proteins to be declared orthologues, they had to be each
other’s best BLAST hit, and both BLAST hits had to
attain E-values less than a defined threshold. The Methods section describes an analytical method for choosing
this E-value threshold, as well as an empirical technique
for estimating the degree to which the chosen E-value
threshold will affect our analyses. In this section, we
apply those techniques to choose an appropriate E-value
threshold for the comparisons done in this study.
Analytical method

In the Methods section, we show that an appropriate
E-value threshold can be chosen using the equation
2 2
E = M / (n p n o ) , where E is the E-value threshold, M is

the desired value for the expected number of spurious
matches, n p is the number of proteins in a given
organism’s proteome, and no is the number of organisms involved in a comparison. In choosing a threshold
for the comparisons used in this study, we noted that
the bacterial isolate examined in this paper with the
largest genome, Burkholderia xenovorans strain LB400,
encodes 8951 ≈ 10 4 proteins. Thus, a conservative
value for n p would be 10 4 . Furthermore, the greatest
number of organisms used in a single comparison was
n o = 211 (when finding proteins unique to a given
genus). Finally, we chose M = 1, since the results of a
given comparison would be only negligibly affected by
a single spurious match. Thus, the chosen E-value
threshold was E = 1/((10 4 ) 2 × 211 2) ≈ 10-13 , meaning
that two proteins were considered orthologues if the
matches between the two proteins (in both directions)
had E-values less than 10-13, in addition to each being
the other’s best BLAST hit.

To estimate the potential impact of the choice of
E-value threshold on our analyses, three pairs of proteomes were arbitrarily selected in each of three categories: isolates from the same species; isolates from
different species but the same genus; and isolates from
different genera. These three categories were selected as
they span the range of relatedness encountered in our
analysis. For each pair of proteomes, the orthologue
detection procedure described in the Methods section
was used to determine the number of proteins in the
first proteome, but not in the second proteome, over
the range of E-value thresholds 10 0 , 10 -1 ,...,10 -180 .
Figure 1 shows the number of unique proteins for each
comparison for each E-value threshold used.
For all three comparisons in all three categories, the
number of unique proteins differed substantially
depending on the E-value threshold chosen. For example, the number of proteins found in the proteome of
Pseudomonas putida strain GB-1 but not in that of P.
putida strain KT2440 (see Figure 1A) ranged from 3882
when using an E-value threshold of 10-180 to 1075 when
using a threshold of 100. The plot for P. putida can be
divided into two distinct sections. The first section of
the plot ranged from an E-value threshold of 10180 to a
threshold of approximately 10-31, in which there was a
nearly perfectly linear decrease in the number of unique
proteins as the exponent in the E-value threshold was
increased. The second section ranged from E-value
thresholds between 10-30 and 100. Like the first section,
the number of unique proteins decreased as the E-value
threshold was increased, although the slope was much
smaller. In other words, compared to the first section,
increasing the E-value threshold in this region seemed
to result in smaller decreases in the number of unique
proteins. This same trend was observed in the other two
intra-species comparisons. Owing to the more divergent
sequences of their proteins, all three inter-genus comparisons (Figure 1C) showed a distinctly different pattern–a very gradual slope between thresholds of 10-180
and 10-51, and then a steeper slope between thresholds
of 10-50 and 100. As expected, the trend seen in all three
inter-species (but intra-genus) comparisons (Figure 1B)
was intermediate between the intra-species and intergenus comparisons.
Figure 1 shows that, while the number of unique proteins differed substantially over the full range of E-value
thresholds tested, the values did not differ by much over
the range of E-value thresholds that might reasonably be
chosen (say, between 10 -30 and 10 -2 ). For example,
Figure 1A shows that P. putida strain GB-1 had 1097
proteins not found in P. putida strain KT2440 at an
E-value threshold of 10-3, versus 1144 at a threshold of
10 -13 . Similarly, Figure 1C shows that Yersinia

graphs denote the number of proteins in the first isolate (e.g. Pseudomonas putida GB-1) that are not found in the second isolate (e.g.
Pseudomonas putida KT2440). The relationship between pairs of isolates is: (A) same species; (B) same genus but different species; and (C)
different genera. As an E-value threshold of 10-13 was ultimately chosen for our analyses, a vertical line corresponding to this E-value is indicated
on each graph.

enterocolitica had 3185 proteins not found in Clostridium tetani at a threshold of 10 -3 , versus 3322 at a
threshold of 10-13 . As the magnitudes of these differences are small, and because an E-value threshold of
10 -13 is justified by the above analytical method, we
used this threshold for the rest of our analyses.
Comparing the protein content of selected genera
Identification of core proteomes, unique proteomes, and
singlets

To provide a general characterization of pan-genomic
relationships in different genera, the orthologue detection procedure described in the Methods section was
used to find core proteomes, unique proteomes, and
singlets for each of the 16 genera listed in Table 1. If a
given orthologous group contained proteins from all isolates of a given genus, it was considered to be part of
the core proteome for that genus. If a given orthologous
group contained proteins from all isolates of a given
genus and no proteins from any other isolate in any of
the other genera given in Table 1, then it was considered to be part of the unique proteome for that genus.
Finally, if a given group contained just a single protein
from a single isolate of a given genus, then it was
referred to as a singlet. Note that although a singlet protein for a given isolate could not have been found in any
other isolates from the same genus (by definition), it
may have been found in the proteomes of isolates from
other genera. Figure 2 displays the relationship between
a genus’s median proteome size and its core proteome
size (A), its unique proteome size (B), and the average
number of singlets per isolate (C). We compared against
the median proteome size rather than the mean to eliminate the effect of outliers, since some genera have one
or more isolates with far larger or smaller proteomes
than most other isolates from the same genus.
Figure 2A shows that the different genera varied significantly in the ratio of their median proteome size to
their core proteome size. Genera appearing below the
best-fit line had a larger ratio of median proteome size
to core proteome size than those appearing above the
line. This ratio could be interpreted as showing the relative proteomic similarity of the isolates of each genus.
For example, if genus A has a very low ratio, then many
proteins found in a given isolate of genus A are actually
found in all genus A isolates, whereas if genus B has a
very high ratio, then many proteins found in a given isolate of genus B are not found in all genus B isolates. To
use the language of Tettelin et al. [17], genera with a
high ratio contain isolates that generally have large dispensable genomes, and vice versa.
The fact that genera such as Lactobacillus and Clostridium had a large ratio is consistent with reports that
characterize the taxonomic classifications of these

Page 5 of 18

genera as overly broad. For instance, Ljungh and
Wadstrom [24] argued that Lactobacillus should be split
up into a number of separate genera, and Collins et al.
[25] made a similar argument for Clostridium. On the
other side of the spectrum, Brucella and Xanthomonas,
among others, had low median proteome size to core
proteome size ratios. This is consistent with the fact
that all pairs of isolates in each of these two genera had
16S rRNA genes that were more than 99.5% identical to
each other (see also the next section, which provides a
comparison of proteomic similarity with 16S rRNA gene
similarity).
The best-fit line in Figure 2A had an R2 value of 0.46,
showing that the median proteome size of a given genus
explained less than half of the variation in core proteome size. Another factor that could explain differences
in core proteome sizes is simply the number of isolates
used, since the core proteome size of a given genus can
only decrease (or remain the same) as more isolates are
added to the analysis. In their report on the pan-genomics of Streptococcus agalactiae [17], for example, Tettelin and co-authors showed that, as additional isolates
were added, the core genome of this species decreased
in a fashion consistent with a decaying exponential
function, eventually approaching some asymptotic value.
Other factors that could explain differences in core proteome sizes include the quality of a genus’s taxonomic
classification, the frequency of horizontal gene transfer,
the number of mobile genetic elements (e.g. plasmids),
and the nature and variety of environments that the isolates inhabit.
The proteins comprising the core proteome of a given
genus could be considered the fundamental units of
information required for the existence of isolates of that
genus as they currently exist in their environments, and
include both housekeeping proteins and proteins
required for environment-specific functions. The latter
category of proteins would be the most informative in
terms of characterizing the commonalities of a given
group of bacteria. For instance, the protein encoded by
the acpM gene, which is involved in mycolic acid synthesis [26], comprises part of the core proteome of the
Mycobacterium genus, and thus is part of the unique
lipid metabolism that characterizes mycobacteria. As a
greater number of core proteomes are revealed through
additional genome sequencing, core proteomes may be
capable of revealing the fundamental requirements for
life in relation to basal function or to specific niches,
habitats, and diseases.
Whereas the core proteome is the set of proteins
that a particular group of bacteria have in common,
the unique proteome is what makes a group different
from other groups (i.e. would not include conserved
housekeeping proteins). The relationship between

average number of singlets per isolate.

For each genus, the range of 16S rRNA gene percent identities for all pairs of isolates from that genus is listed. Under the “shared proteins” heading, “range”
indicates the range of shared proteins in pairs of isolates from that genus. The “slope” column indicates the slope of the regression line when the number of
shared proteins in each pair of isolates is plotted against their 16S rRNA gene percent identities. The “R2“ column contains the square of the standard correlation
coefficient between these two variables, and indicates the strength of their relationship. The data under the “average unique proteins” heading are analogous to
those under the “shared proteins” heading. Isolates sharing ≥ 99.5% identity of the 16S rRNA gene were not used in the calculation of slope or R2. Values
marked with “ND” were not determined; despite having different species names, all isolates with sequenced genomes within these genera shared ≥ 99.5%
identity of the 16S rRNA gene. An asterisk (*) beside an R2 value indicates that it is statistically significant with P-value < 0.05.

median proteome size and unique proteome size for
the genera used in this study is given in Figure 2B.
The trend was somewhat similar to that shown in
Figure 2A, with both Lactobacillus and Clostridium
having very few unique proteins and Xanthomonas
having many unique proteins. However, there were
some interesting differences. For instance, Mycobacterium had a fairly small core proteome, but had a larger
unique proteome than all genera except Xanthomonas
and Rhizobium. We hypothesized that this may be a
reflection of the diverse lipid metabolism of mycobacteria, which among other things provides these organisms with their unique cell wall structure [27].
Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv, for instance,
contains around 250 enzymes for fatty acid biosynthesis alone, compared to a fifth of that for E. coli [28].
To tentatively examine this hypothesis, we analyzed
the annotations of the 332 proteins unique to the
mycobacteria. We report data here for a representative
isolate, Mycobacterium ulcerans strain Agy99. Many of
the 332 proteins were associated, in this isolate, with
the structure or synthesis of the cell membrane, with
83 membrane proteins, 12 transferases, and 17 lipoproteins. In addition, 65 of the proteins were uncharacterized, and it is plausible that many of these
uncharacterized proteins may also be associated with
the mycobacterial cell wall, since our knowledge of its
biology is still far from complete [29,30].

The R2 value of 0.23 for the best-fit line indicates that
median proteome size explains little of the variation in
unique proteome size. It is likely that much of this variation could be explained by some of the same factors
mentioned for core proteome size, in particular the
environments inhabited by a particular genus and the
amount of specialization required to adapt to those
environments.
The unique proteome of a given group of bacteria
(not necessarily a genus) can be regarded as the protein
complement that makes it distinct from other taxonomic groups. The DNA sequences of the open reading
frames corresponding to the unique proteome would
therefore be good candidates for group-specific identification methods, such as group-specific PCR. Given that
PCR-based identification methods require conserved
regions in the DNA sequences, the unique proteome
would provide a broad range of possible targets. Conserved regions of DNA have been used for group-specific identification before; for instance, three of us
performed phylum-specific PCR using conserved regions
in the 16S rRNA gene as targets [31,32]. As another
example, O’Sullivan et al. [33] determined orthologous
relationships among the genes in several lactic acid bacteria in order to identify niche-specific (specifically, gutspecific and dairy-specific) genes.
Another interesting application of unique proteomes
could be to strengthen the argument for the taxonomic

Trost et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/258

reclassification of certain genera. For example, the Lactobacillus genus had a very small unique proteome compared to other genera. While this fact alone would not
be enough to show that the taxonomy of Lactobacillus
should be re-examined, it does help support this contention in combination with other data (e.g. [24]). If care is
used in the selection of groups, unique proteomes could
also provide insight on factors or evolutionary trends
leading to virulence, adaptation to specific environmental niches, or currently-unknown metabolic functions.
In contrast to the core and unique proteomes, the
average number of singlets per isolate in a given genus
(Figure 2C) exhibited a fairly strong relationship with
the median proteome size (R2 = 0.74). This was not surprising, since one would expect the number of singlets
to increase with proteome size. Nonetheless, it is still
rather striking that most isolates have hundreds of proteins not found in any other isolate from the same
genus, reflecting the sheer amount of diversity in the
protein content of even very closely related organisms.
This is consistent with previous observations that new
genes continue to be added to a given bacterial species
with each new genome sequenced, and thus that it may
be impossible to ever fully describe a given species in
terms of its collective genome content [21].
Whereas unique proteins may be useful for developing
genus-specific (or, more generally, group-specific) identification techniques, singlets would be similarly useful
for facilitating strain-specific identification. Additionally,
whereas the core proteome represents the protein complement necessary for life among all the niches and
habitats occupied by the different strains of a given
group, singlets could be linked to more specific lifestyle
requirements of a single strain.
Comparison of proteomic similarity with 16S rRNA gene
similarity

Phylogenetic studies currently use 16S rRNA gene
sequence comparisons as the standard method for the
taxonomic classification of prokaryotes. Two isolates are
typically described as being of the same species if their
16S rRNA genes are more than 97% identical, and of
the same genus if their 16S rRNA genes are more than
95% identical [34], although our data (see Table 2) suggest that the lower limit for a genus is closer to 90%
(and Clostridium and Lactobacillus represent exceptions
even to this boundary, as some pairs of isolates in these
genera have identities well below 90%). However, analogous thresholds for proteomic similarity–if they exist–
are currently unknown. Additionally, while other studies
have reported a relationship between genomic similarity
and identity of the 16S rRNA gene, no statistical correlation has been reported (a substantial review of this
topic is given by Rosello-Mora and Amann [35]). We
therefore sought to investigate the relationship between

Page 8 of 18

protein content similarity and 16S rRNA gene similarity
in pairs of isolates from the same genus. In doing so, we
used two different measures of proteomic similarity:
“shared proteins” (the number of proteins found in the
proteomes of both isolates–in other words, the number
of orthologues), and “average unique proteins” (the average of the number of proteins found in isolate A but not
isolate B, and the number of proteins found in isolate B
but not isolate A). For a given genus, both of these proteomic similarity measures were plotted against the 16S
rRNA gene percent identity for all pairs of isolates, and
linear regression was used to describe the nature of the
relationship (slope and R 2 value) between these variables. As described in the Methods section, only pairs of
isolates whose 16S rRNA genes were less than 99.5%
identical were included in this analysis. As a result, no
slope and R2 values could be determined for Brucella
and Xanthomonas, as no pairs of isolates within these
genera had 16S rRNA gene percent identities less than
this cutoff. Table 2 contains the results of these
analyses.
In contrast to 16S rRNA gene percent identity, Table
2 shows that there is no specific range of proteomic
diversity for a genus. In other words, although a reasonably consistent cutoff has traditionally been used for
bounding the 16S rRNA gene identity of isolates from
the same genus, there does not seem to be a corresponding lower limit for shared proteins or upper limit
for average unique proteins.
Table 2 indicates that most genera exhibited a direct
relationship between shared proteins and 16S rRNA
gene percent identity, and an inverse relationship
between average unique proteins and 16S rRNA gene
percent identity. This was expected given that larger
numbers for the shared proteins measure indicate
greater similarity, whereas larger numbers for the average unique proteins measure indicate greater dissimilarity. Interestingly, however, Neisseria exhibited the
opposite trend; also anomalous were Rickettsia and Rhizobium, which had positive slopes for both proteomic
similarity metrics. Surprisingly, the relationship between
16S rRNA gene similarity and protein content similarity
was fairly weak for most genera. Specifically, only four
of the 14 genera exhibited a strong (R2 > 0.5) relationship between 16S rRNA gene identity and either of the
proteomic similarity measures. Two of these genera
(Bacillus and Yersinia) showed a strong relationship
between 16S rRNA gene identity and both proteomic
similarity measures, whereas Vibrio exhibited a strong
correlation only for the shared proteins measure and
Burkholderia had a strong correlation only for the average unique proteins measure.
Perhaps most interestingly, the R 2 values for the
shared proteins measure and the average unique

proteins measure were sometimes quite different even
for the same genus. This could be attributed to the fact
that the number of shared proteins in two isolates is a
measure of gene conservation, whereas the average
number of unique proteins in two isolates is a measure
of gene gain or loss. For example, the R 2 value for
Vibrio when using the shared proteins measure was
0.81, compared to just 0.03 when using the average
unique proteins measure. This could indicate that a subset of genes were highly conserved over time while a
large amount of gene loss/acquisition occurred, which
ultimately enabled Vibrio isolates to inhabit the various
niches in which they are currently found.
As described in the Methods section, we also created
three phylogenetic trees, with the first based on 16S
rRNA gene similarity, the second based on the number
of shared proteins between two isolates, and the third
based on the average unique proteins between two isolates. Collapsed versions of these trees are given in Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C, respectively, while trees showing
all individual isolates are available as additional files 2, 3
and 4.
There are several notable observations that can be
made through comparisons of these three phylogenetic

trees. For the most part, the trees were similar; for
example, the intra-genus diversity was large for Lactobacillus and Clostridium in all three phylogenetic trees
(demonstrated by the height of each triangle). However,
the methods based on protein content did sometimes
give results different from those given by the method
based on 16S rRNA gene similarity, which is typically
used for nomenclature. Notably, the Bacillus genus was
divided in both protein content-based trees, but not in
the tree based on the 16S rRNA gene. Additionally,
there were marked differences between the shared protein method (proposed by Snel et al. [13]) and the average unique proteins method (introduced in this paper).
The shared proteins method resulted in a taxonomy
fairly similar to that found when using the 16S rRNA
gene, suggesting that their respective rates of evolution
are similar. Conversely, the average unique proteins
method gave a somewhat different view of taxonomy.
For example, the genus Clostridium has been described
as extremely heterogeneous [25], and this is reflected in
the divergence of some species of this genus from the
rest of the clostridia in the average unique proteins tree.
As another example, the species Lactobacillus casei and
Lactobacillus plantarum both have much larger

proteomes than other lactobacilli, which is likely the
cause of their divergence from the rest of their genus.
It is a widely held assumption that the 16S rRNA gene
is one of the few genes that can be regarded as an
approximate molecular clock, and that other genes–and
the genome as a whole–can have a very different rate of
evolution compared to the 16S rRNA gene, due to various selective pressures and horizontal gene transfer [1].
Table 2 represents a quantitative approach to examining
the relationship between the evolutionary relatedness of
different organisms (as measured by the similarity of
their 16S rRNA genes) and their degree of genomic
similarity (as measured by shared proteins or average
unique proteins). It seems reasonable to hypothesize
that a stronger relationship between 16S rRNA gene
similarity and proteomic similarity for a given genus
would imply a lower selective pressure on the organisms’ genomes, and vice versa. This difference in selective pressure may in turn reflect the fact that different
genera live in different environments, or that the organisms belonging to a given genus may inhabit a greater
variety of environments than the organisms belonging to
a second genus. As evolutionary pressures experienced
by organisms differ based on their environmental niche

and life cycle, we expect to see different patterns of
association between 16S rRNA gene identity and proteomic content emerge as a greater number of genome
sequences become available.
Comparing the protein content of selected species
Evaluating taxonomic classifications by determining how
well species are clustered based on protein content

In this section, we provide a novel perspective on the
soundness of the taxonomic classifications of different
species. Broadly speaking, the classification of a set of
organisms into a single species could be described as
“good” if two criteria are met: the organisms are very
similar to each other, and they are distinct from other
organisms of the same genus. This section reports the
results of examining these two criteria from the perspective of protein content; specifically, the isolates of
a given species are considered to be similar to each
other if they have a larger core proteome than randomly-selected sets of isolates of the same genus, and
are considered to be distinct from other organisms of
the same genus if they have a larger unique proteome
than randomly-selected sets of isolates of the same
genus.

Trost et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/258

For each species from the genera listed in Table 1 that
had two or more isolates sequenced, we compared the
core proteome size and the unique proteome size of
that species to those of randomly-generated sets of isolates from the same genus. The results of this analysis
are given in Tables 3 and 4. Also, additional file 5 contains the organisms comprising each random group, as
well as the core proteome size and unique proteome
size of each.
The primary purpose of this section was to investigate
the utility of this cohesiveness analysis for identifying
bacterial species that might be misclassified. A cursory
reading of Tables 3 and 4 revealed that, while most species satisfied both of the above criteria, some species
either had core or unique proteomes that were not significantly larger than the average of the random groups,
or had several corresponding random groups that had
larger core or unique proteomes than the species itself.
A lack of cohesiveness in the proteomes of a given species indicates that its taxonomic classification may need
revisiting. However, these results must be interpreted
with caution. A closer look at these species revealed
that the classification of some really did appear to warrant re-examination, whereas the apparent lack of cohesiveness of others had alternative explanations. In the
following paragraphs, we discuss several examples. First,
we describe the cohesiveness results for Bacillus anthracis, which is indeed proteomically cohesive based on
Tables 3 and 4. Next, we discuss Rhizobium leguminosarum and Yersinia pestis, both of which look uncohesive based on these tables but whose lack of
cohesiveness can readily be explained. Finally, we look
at two species that probably do warrant reclassification,
Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis.
As an example of reading Tables 3 and 4, consider the
first row of Table 3, which contains B. anthracis. The
core proteome of the three sequenced B. anthracis isolates contained 4941 proteins. When sets of three Bacillus isolates were randomly chosen as described in the
Methods section, however, the average core proteome
size was just 2123. According to a two-tailed t-test, the
P-value for this comparison was less than 0.001, indicating that the difference in core proteome size between
the three B. anthracis isolates, and randomly chosen
sets of three Bacillus isolates, was statistically significant.
In fact, none of the 25 randomly-generated sets contained a larger core proteome than the set of B. anthracis isolates. B. anthracis therefore satisfied our first
criterion, since the three B. anthracis isolates had more
similar protein content than randomly-chosen sets of
three Bacillus isolates. B. anthracis also satisfied the second criterion, which stated that species should be distinct from other isolates of the same genus. Table 3
shows that the B. anthracis isolates contained 168

Page 12 of 18

proteins not found in any other Bacillus isolate, compared to an average of just one unique protein for the
25 randomly-generated sets (P-value < 0.001). None of
the 25 randomly-generated sets contained more unique
proteins than the three B. anthracis isolates. Overall, the
fact that B. anthracis satisfied both criteria supports its
current taxonomic classification.
As another example, consider R. leguminosarum.
There were 3678 proteins in its core proteome, compared to an average of 4063 for randomly selected
sets of two Rhizobium isolates. This difference was
not statistically significant due to the fact that only
four corresponding random groups could be created.
Two of the four random groups–the first containing
Rhizobium etli strain ATCC 51251 and R. leguminosarum strain 3841, and the second containing R. etli
strain CIAT 652 and R. leguminosarum strain 3841–
had larger core proteome sizes than the two R. leguminosarum isolates. The results for unique proteomes
were similar, with the same two random groups having a larger unique proteome size than the two
R. leguminosarum isolates. However, this apparent
lack of cohesiveness can be attributed to differences
in the proteome sizes of the individual isolates: the
proteome of R. leguminosarum strain WSM2304 contains just 4320 proteins, compared to 5921 for the
next-smallest Rhizobium isolate. As such, it might be
expected that two Rhizobium isolates having proteomes much larger than that of R. leguminosarum
strain WSM2304 would also have a larger core and/or
unique proteome.
The apparent lack of cohesiveness of Y. pestis can also
be readily explained, although the reason is different
than that for R. leguminosarum. There were four random groups of seven isolates each, all of which contained a mixture of Y. pestis and Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis isolates, that had larger core proteomes than the seven Y. pestis isolates. All of the isolates of both Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis had
proteome sizes that fall within a fairly narrow range
(about 3900-4300 proteins), so the larger core proteomes of these random groups cannot be attributed to
large differences in proteome sizes. Rather, these results
make sense given that Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis are very closely related, with Y. pestis having recently
diverged from Y. pseudotuberculosis. However, it is
known that Y. pestis has acquired additional factors that
enable it to cause a very different and severe disease
than that caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis [36].
Finally, the lack of cohesiveness of some species’ proteomes does indeed suggest the need for taxonomic
reclassification. For example, B. cereus had a much larger core proteome than the randomly generated sets,
but had just two unique proteins. While two unique

Trost et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/258

proteins was more than the average for the randomlygenerated sets (none of which had any unique proteins),
it was much less than the number of unique proteins
possessed by other species having four (or more)
sequenced isolates. Similarly, B. thuringiensis had a larger core proteome than the corresponding random sets,
but actually had a smaller unique proteome than the
average of the random sets. In addition, the B. thuringiensis isolates had fewer unique proteins than seven of
the 25 corresponding random sets. Unlike R. leguminosarum and Y. pestis, we could not identify any reason
for the lack of cohesiveness of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis, other than a possible misclassification. Given
that there are many different ways in which the taxonomic classification of a given species can be evaluated,
the reclassification of these species could not be justified
using only one kind of analysis. However, data like
those given in this section could be combined with
other kinds of data in order to make a stronger argument. For instance, some of the B. cereus and B. thuringiensis isolates used in this study in fact have 99-100%
16S rRNA identity with isolates of the opposite species,
and a lower percent identity (less than 99%) with isolates of the species to which they are currently assigned.
Combined with the very small unique proteomes of
B. cereus and B. thuringiensis, this suggests that there
may be isolates named as thuringiensis that should really
be named as cereus, and vice versa. As it can be difficult
or uncertain to resolve speciation using only the 16S
rRNA gene, using the core/unique proteome analyses
introduced here may well assist in the proper naming of
isolates that are difficult to speciate.

Conclusions
In this paper, we examined pan-genomic relationships
and their applications in several groups of bacteria. It
was found that different bacterial genera vary widely in
core proteome size, unique proteome size, and the number of singlets that their isolates contain, and that these
variables are explained only partly by differences in proteome size. We also found that the relationship between
protein content similarity and the percent identity of the
16S rRNA gene varied substantially in different genera,
with a fairly strong association in a few genera and little
or no association in most other genera. Finally, we
found that most bacterial species were fairly cohesive in
their protein content, but that the protein content of
some species (such as B. thuringiensis) was no more
cohesive than that of randomly selected sets of isolates
from the same genus, indicating that the current taxonomy of those species may need to be revisited. The differing pan-genomic properties of the various genera
reported in this paper reflect the fact that different
groups of bacteria have diverse evolutionary pressures

Page 13 of 18

and unequal rates of genomic evolution, and provide a
starting point for a general, genome-based understanding of such differences in a broad range of bacteria.
We also note that the analyses described in this paper
could be applied to any groups of interest, whether or
not the bacteria included in each group have a common
taxonomic classification. The commonalities in each
group could instead be related to phenotype; for example, ability to live in a particular environment, physiological properties, metabolic capabilities, or even disease
pathogenesis. As such, the methods described in this
paper have broad applicability and should be useful for
further pan-genomic comparisons in the future.
There are a number of opportunities to build upon
the work performed in this study. For instance, it would
be interesting to further characterize proteins that are
found in only a single isolate of a given genus (singlets).
Our research revealed that the isolates of most genera
contain, on average, hundreds of singlets. This phenomenon could be further described by answering questions
like: how much variation is there in the number of singlets in isolates of the same genus? Do isolates inhabiting
certain environments possess more singlets than other
isolates? Do singlets tend to be biased toward any particular functional category of protein? Another avenue for
future work would be to enhance our study of the relationship between protein content similarity and 16S
rRNA gene similarity. Despite the existence of usuallyconsistent lower bounds for 16S rRNA gene similarity
for isolates of the same genus, in this study we were
unable to determine corresponding bounds for protein
content similarity. However, we considered only absolute measures of protein content (i.e. absolute numbers
of shared proteins or average unique proteins), and it
would also be worthwhile to devise biologically meaningful bounds using a relative measure that could take
into account factors like the proteome sizes of the individual isolates, the number of individual isolates, and so
on. Finally, perhaps the most obvious opportunity for
future work is simply to repeat the analyses described in
this paper when more genome sequences become available. Given the increasing pace of genome sequencing,
in the future it should be possible to do a study similar
to this one with dozens or even hundreds of genera,
rather than just 16, which will allow us to gain a far
richer understanding of the pan-genomic relationships
among bacteria.

genomes. The latter requirement was used so that intraspecies comparisons could be conducted. All bacterial
proteomes were downloaded on November 28th, 2008
from Integr8 [37] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/integr8).
Orthologue detection

Many techniques have been proposed for identifying
orthologous proteins. These include COGs [38-41],
Ortholuge [42], OrthologID [43], RIO [44], Orthostrapper [45], and INPARANOID [46,47]. Our analyses involving orthologue detection could theoretically have made
use of any of these methods. Unfortunately, it would be
difficult to justify choosing one tool over any of the
others, and comparing all of the tools with respect to our
analyses would have been complicated by the fact that
each tool uses different techniques and parameters. As
such, in this paper we used a slight variation on the commonly-used RBH method for orthologue detection. With
standard RBH, two proteins P1 and P2 (from organisms
O1 and O2, respectively) are considered to be orthologues
if and only if: (a) P 2 is the best BLAST [22,23] hit (i.e.
having the smallest E-value) when P1 is used as the query
sequence and the proteins in O2 are used as the database,
and (b) P 1 is the best hit when P 2 is used as the query
sequence and the proteins in O1 are used as the database.
In our analyses, we imposed an additional criterion: the
E-values reported for both comparisons must each be
less than some threshold. RBH was chosen because it is a
common, well-understood method that is often used as
the basis for more complex or specialized approaches to
orthologue detection; in addition, the aforementioned
variation on RBH requires only a single, though important, parameter–the E-value threshold.
For a given set of organisms, once orthologous relationships between pairs of proteins were determined, a
graph was created wherein each vertex represented a
protein, and two vertices were connected by an edge if
the proteins represented by each were orthologues
based on the above RBH-based method. Identification of
orthologous groups was then performed by finding the
connected components of the graph (i.e. sets of vertices
for which there was a path from any vertex to any other
vertex) using the Perl module Graph (http://search.cpan.
org/dist/Graph/lib/Graph.pod ).
The choice of the aforementioned E-value threshold
can affect the results of orthologue detection; as such, it
was important to choose this threshold carefully. Below,
we describe an analytical method for choosing this
threshold, and an empirical method for characterizing
the degree to which this threshold would affect our
results.
Analytical method

In this study, BLAST is used to compare dozens of proteomes, each of which contains thousands of proteins.

Page 14 of 18

As such, using a relatively large E-value threshold, such
as 0.001, would result in many matches occurring simply by chance. Therefore, we choose a more appropriate
threshold using the reasoning shown below.
Suppose that the proteomes of no organisms are to be
compared, and that the number of proteins encoded by
the organism with the largest proteome in a given comparison is np. For each pair of organisms, there will be at most
2
n p × n p = n p pairwise comparisons between proteins. The

number of pairs of organisms that must be compared
(note that comparisons must be performed in both direc2
tions) is n o × (n o − 1) ≈ n o . Thus, the total number of
protein-protein comparisons that must be performed will
2 2
be bounded above by n p n o . The expected number of

spurious matches M will be equal to the number of comparisons performed, multiplied by the probability of a
spurious match (P) in each comparison. Then
2 2
M = Pn p n o

How can a value for P be derived? The E-value, simply
denoted as E in this section, represents for a particular
match with raw score R the number of matches attaining a score better than or equal to R that would occur
at random given the size of the database. While E does
not represent a probability, P can be derived from it:
since the probability of finding no random matches with
a score greater than or equal to R is e-E, where e is the
base of the natural logarithm, the chance of obtaining
one or more such matches is P = 1 - e-E [48]. Since P is
nearly equal to E when E < 0.01, E can reasonably be
used as a proxy for P. As such, the expected number of
spurious matches M can be written as:
2 2
M = En p n o

By rearranging, an equation was obtained that
expresses the E-value threshold that should be chosen
in terms of np, no, and M:
E=

M
2 2
np no

Empirical method

To empirically evaluate the impact of the E-value
threshold on our orthologue detection procedure, pairs
of organisms A and B were selected, and the number of
proteins in the proteome of organism A but not in
organism B (unique proteins) was determined for the Evalue thresholds 100, 10-1,...,10-179, 10-180. Scatterplots
were then created using these data.

Trost et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/258

It is reasonable to expect that the relatedness of the
organisms involved in a comparison would affect the
interaction between the E-value threshold and the number of unique proteins reported. Thus, three different
degrees of relatedness were considered–two isolates
from the same species; two isolates from the same
genus but different species; and two isolates from different genera. These degrees of relatedness were selected
as they span the range represented in this report. Three
pairs of organisms were arbitrarily selected for each of
these three types of comparisons.
Comparing the protein content of selected genera
Identification of core proteomes, unique proteomes, and
singlets

To find the core proteome of a particular set of isolates,
orthologue detection was performed on the proteins in
that set, and connected components of the graph that
contained proteins from all isolates in the set were identified. These connected components were then counted
to determine the size of the core proteome. It is important to note that the size of the core proteome was
defined in terms of the number of orthologous groups,
not in terms of the total number of individual proteins
(from one specific organism) in those groups. For example, suppose that we were finding the size of the core
proteome for a genus with eight isolates, and that there
were 500 orthologous groups containing proteins from
all eight of those isolates. Further, suppose that each of
these groups actually contained ten individual proteins
(say, with six isolates having one protein each, and two
isolates having two each). Then the size of the core proteome would be reported as 500, not as 500 × 10 =
5000. Unique proteomes were found in a similar manner–by counting the number of connected components
that contained proteins from all members of a particular
group, but in no members of a second group. Finally,
the number of singlets in a particular genus was found
by performing orthologue detection on the proteins
from that genus (only), and identifying the number of
connected components containing just a single protein.
Most comparisons done in this study involved a fairly
small number of isolates (and therefore proteins). For
example, finding the core proteome of a particular
genus involved performing orthologue detection for the
isolates of that genus (between 4 and 31 isolates,
depending on the genus), each of which had a proteome
containing around 1000 to 9000 proteins. However, one
type of comparison–finding the proteins unique to each
genus–required finding orthologues among all proteins
in the proteomes of all isolates used in this study. Due
to memory constraints, this could not be done using a
single orthologue detection comparison. Instead, comparisons were performed between all possible pairs of

Page 15 of 18

genera. For example, in finding the proteins unique to
genus A, we first determined the list of proteins in all
isolates of genus A, but no isolates of genus B; we then
determined the list of proteins found in all isolates of A,
but no isolates of C, and so on. Once all lists had been
calculated, the proteins that were present in every list
were the proteins unique to genus A.
Comparison of proteomic similarity with 16S rRNA
gene similarity

To determine 16S rRNA gene percent identities, the 16S
rRNA gene was obtained from each sequenced genome
used in this study and the RDP10 tool [49] was used to
align sequences based on known conserved and variable
regions according to the rRNA’s secondary structure.
The percent identity of the 16S rRNA gene between
pairs of isolates from the same genus was calculated to
the nearest 0.01%. Two methods, both of which used
the orthologue detection procedure described above,
were used to determine the proteomic similarity
between pairs of isolates A and B (again from the same
genus): (a) the number of orthologous groups containing
proteins from both isolate A and isolate B (“shared proteins”), and (b) the average of the number of proteins in
the proteome of isolate A but not isolate B, and the
number of proteins in the proteome of isolate B but not
isolate A (“average unique proteins”). Linear regression
using least squares was used to determine the correlation and the equation of the best-fit line between the
16S rRNA gene percent identity and the shared proteins
measure, and between the 16S rRNA gene percent identity and the average unique proteins measure.
Preliminary results showed that genera having many
very closely related isolates (such as many isolates of the
same species) had much higher correlations between
16S rRNA gene percent identity and the two proteomic
similarity measures than genera having fewer very closely related isolates. Further analysis revealed that this
phenomenon was caused by pairs of these closely related
isolates “anchoring” the regression line, leading to an
artificially good linear relationship. To avoid this bias,
we initially tried excluding pairs of isolates from the
same species. This approach was problematic, however,
because the nomenclature for some pairs of isolates
classifies them as belonging to different species even
though their 16S rRNA genes are nearly identical. For
example, the 16S rRNA gene of B. anthracis strain
Sterne is 99.85% identical to that of Bacillus cereus
strain ATCC 14579. Thus, we instead included pairs of
isolates in the analysis only if their 16S rRNA genes
were less than 99.5% identical, regardless of their
accepted species naming.
To further compare 16S rRNA gene similarity with
our two proteomic similarity measures, we generated
three phylogenetic trees, each of which was based on a

Trost et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/258

different distance metric. The distance metric used for
the first tree was 16S rRNA gene similarity. 16S rRNA
gene alignments were created by downloading sequences
from the RDP10 website that were pre-aligned based on
secondary structure [49]. The evolutionary history was
inferred using the maximum likelihood neighbour-joining method [50] within the Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis (MEGA) program [51]. Within
MEGA, a bootstrap test with 1000 replicates was used.
The second tree used the same metric employed by Snel
et al. [13], which is 1 - S/P, where S is the number of
shared proteins between two isolates and P is the size of
the smaller proteome. The metric used for the third tree
was simply the average unique proteins measure
described above. For the protein-based distance metrics,
trees were created using the unweighted pair group
method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). Graphical
representations of the complete trees were created using
Geneious [52], while those of the collapsed trees were
created using MEGA [51].
Comparing the protein content of selected species
Evaluating taxonomic classifications by determining how
well species are clustered based on protein content

This section describes an analysis that examines the
quality of current taxonomic classifications from a novel
perspective–specifically, by determining the level of
cohesiveness in the protein content of a given species.
This can be conceptualized as a clustering problem. The
general idea behind clustering is that each element in a
given cluster should be similar to other elements in the
same cluster, but dissimilar to elements from other clusters. In the context of taxonomy and protein content,
the clustering of a given species could be considered
sound if two criteria are satisfied: first, members of the
species are similar to each other (i.e. have a large core
proteome); second, they are distinct from other organisms (i.e. have many proteins found only in that species).
To determine whether existing taxonomic classifications
fit these criteria, we answered the following two questions. First, is the core proteome of a particular species
having NI sequenced isolates larger than the core proteome of N I randomly selected organisms from the
same genus? Second, is the number of proteins that are
found in all NI isolates of a given species, but none of
the other organisms from the same genus (i.e. unique
proteins), larger than the number of proteins found in
N I randomly selected isolates of that genus, but no
others?
The rationale behind asking these questions is that
one would expect the isolates of a given species to have
a larger core proteome and unique proteome than randomly selected sets of isolates from the same genus.
Thus, a “yes” answer to each of the above questions

Page 16 of 18

would support the species’ current taxonomic classification. In contrast, “no” answers to one or both questions
would suggest that the species does not fit the clustering
criteria given above, and its taxonomic classification may
therefore warrant reexamination. The following
describes only the methodology used to address the first
question; however, the methodology used to answer the
second question was analogous, and is briefly described
in the final paragraph of this section. Once again, let NI
be the number of isolates that have been sequenced for
a particular species S. The following methodology was
performed for each species from the genera used in this
study that had at least two isolates sequenced. First, a
set of N I isolates from the same genus as S was randomly selected. Each random isolate was allowed to be
from any species from the same genus as S; they were
not limited to the species meeting the “at least two isolates sequenced” requirement. This set was examined to
ensure that its members were not all from the same species. For instance, when generating random sets of two
organisms each corresponding to the two B. thuringiensis isolates (N I = 2), a random set containing both
B. thuringiensis isolates would have been disallowed, as
would a random set containing two B. anthracis isolates.
However, a random set containing one B. thuringiensis
isolate and one B. anthracis would have been valid. If a
random set was generated, but all of its members were
from the same species, then the set was discarded and
another generated in its place. The size of the core proteome of this set of organisms was then determined.
This procedure was then repeated 24 more times; in
other words, 25 random sets of NI organisms were constructed, and the size of the core proteome was determined for each. The 25 sets were also checked to
ensure that none of the sets were the same. The reasons
for choosing 25 random sets, rather than some other
quantity, were: (a) this number is large enough to make
the results statistically meaningful, and (b) this number
is not much larger than the maximum number of random sets that could be generated for some species.
As just mentioned, some genera had too few
sequenced isolates to enable 25 sets to be created. For
instance, the genus Neisseria had only six isolates
sequenced in total, with two Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates and four Neisseria meningitidis isolates. When generating random sets corresponding to N. gonorrhoeae,
the number of possible ways to choose two items from
six is C(6, 2) = 15. However, seven of these sets had
both organisms from the same species, leaving just eight
valid sets. Similarly, in generating random sets corresponding to N. meningitidis, the number of ways in
which one can choose four items from six is the same:
C(6, 4) = 15. One of these sets (the one containing all
four N. meningitidis isolates) was invalid, leaving 14

Trost et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/258

sets. Besides these two Neisseria species, other species
for which fewer than 25 sets could be constructed were
Brucella suis (24 sets), R. leguminosarum (4 sets), R. etli
(4 sets), and Shigella boydii (17 sets). These species
were analyzed in the same manner as the others, but
with statistical tests (see below) taking into account the
smaller sample sizes.
After finding the core proteome sizes of all 25 (or
fewer for the aforementioned species) random sets for a
given species, a t-test was performed to determine
whether the mean of the core proteome sizes for the
randomly-generated sets was different than the core
proteome size of the N I isolates of the species in
question.
The approach to the second question was analogous
to the procedure given above, except that rather than
finding proteins that are found in all members of a
given set of organisms, proteins were found that exist in
all members of a given set, and in no other organisms
from the same genus.
