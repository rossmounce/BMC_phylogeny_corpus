Abstract
Background: Annotation of protein sequences of eukaryotic organisms is crucial for the
understanding of their function in the cell. Manual annotation is still by far the most accurate way
to correctly predict genes. The classification of protein sequences, their phylogenetic relation and
the assignment of function involves information from various sources. This often leads to a
collection of heterogeneous data, which is hard to track. Cytoskeletal and motor proteins consist
of large and diverse superfamilies comprising up to several dozen members per organism. Up to
date there is no integrated tool available to assist in the manual large-scale comparative genomic
analysis of protein families.
Description: Pfarao (Protein Family Application for Retrieval, Analysis and Organisation) is a
database driven online working environment for the analysis of manually annotated protein
sequences and their relationship. Currently, the system can store and interrelate a wide range of
information about protein sequences, species, phylogenetic relations and sequencing projects as
well as links to literature and domain predictions. Sequences can be imported from multiple
sequence alignments that are generated during the annotation process. A web interface allows to
conveniently browse the database and to compile tabular and graphical summaries of its content.
Conclusion: We implemented a protein sequence-centric web application to store, organize,
interrelate, and present heterogeneous data that is generated in manual genome annotation and
comparative genomics. The application has been developed for the analysis of cytoskeletal and
motor proteins (CyMoBase) but can easily be adapted for any protein.

Background
The success of the genome sequencing projects have culminated in release 149 of GenBank [1] that announced
two milestones: the total sequence data passed the 100
gigabases mark, and, for the first time, the number of
bases derived from whole genome shotgun sequencing
projects exceeded the number of bases in the traditional
divisions of GenBank. However, the process of genome

annotation still lags considerably behind that of genome
data generation. Although many tools have been developed for the ab initio annotation of whole genomes, especially the annotation of data from higher eukaryotes
yields low success rates [2]. The success rates can considerably be increased by similarity searches of EST data or of
annotated data from other genomes. But also these data
have their drawbacks: ESTs are fragmentary and might sufPage 1 of 8

fer from several artefacts including contamination with
genomic DNA; similarities to proteins in other species
might suffer from evolutionary divergence or the orthologue-paralogue problem [3]; and the presence of alternative splicing considerably complicates the interpretation
of alignments between genomic DNA, cDNAs and ESTs.
More seriously, however, similarity data is never complete. But it is the annotation that connects the sequence
to the biology of the organism [4].
Manual annotation is still by far the most accurate and
successful way to achieve correct predictions of genes. This
process is best done using the possibilities of comparative
genomics and multiple sequence alignments. Because a
majority of the proteins are not characterized and their
functions are largely unknown, the initial process involves
categorizing these predicted proteins into subsets of proteins or protein families based on homology, presence of
various functional domains and motifs, as well as similarity to well characterized proteins from other species.
Thus, when working with collections of proteinsequences from different species and sources, one quickly
accumulates large amounts of heterogeneous data: Protein and DNA sequences, their identifiers in different
databases, references to literature, information about species including taxonomy, and links to online resources
like sequencing projects. Since data that can be retrieved
from public databases is often incomplete or incorrect it is
very desirable to be able to combine manually edited with
automatically generated content. In addition, there is
often misleading and contradicting data, especially concerning the nomenclature and classification of proteins,
that needs to be tracked and commented.
Cytoskeletal and motor proteins have extensively been
studied in the past. They are involved in diverse processes
like cell division [5], cellular transport [6], neuronal transport processes [7], or muscle contraction [8], to name a
few. Especially motor proteins consist of large superfamilies. E.g. vertebrates contain up to 60 myosins and
about the same number of kinesins that are spread over
more that a dozen distinct classes. Since genome sequence
data is rapidly accumulating it is very important to have a
reference database for the nomenclature and phylogenetic
relation of the proteins that allows the most accurate
assignment of biological function possible.
Pfarao is a database driven web application that was written to assist researchers investigating structure, function
and phylogeny of proteins. It has been developed for the
analysis of cytoskeletal and motor proteins (CyMoBase),
but can be adapted to any type of protein. It stores, organizes, interrelates, presents, and analyzes data of various
sources. Additionally, it triggers external prediction pro-

grams, so that manually entered and automatically generated data is always synchronized.

Construction
Technologies
The system is running on UNIX (OS X and Linux) systems.
The database management system is PostgreSQL [9]. As
web application framework we chose Ruby on Rails [10]
since it has the advantage of rapid and agile development
while keeping the code well organized. Part of this framework is an implementation of Active Record [11] which is
an O/RM (Object-relational Mapping) system that makes
database integration into an object oriented program considerably easier. This also allows to use the interactive
ruby shell (irb) with database rows wrapped in objects for
interaction with the database. This way of accessing the
data often proves superior to the SQL shell. Additionally,
Ruby on Rails offers XML-RPC so data can be accessed by
other programs.

We implemented a service-oriented mechanism that starts
specific scripts, when records in the database are added or
updated. In this case, a PostgreSQL trigger starts a PL/Ruby
script [12], which opens a network connection to a delegation server program written in Distributed Ruby [13] on
the same machine and calls one of its functions, giving a
database ID as an argument if appropriate. The server can
in turn start scripts to act upon the entered or updated
data and returns after completion so that the database
transaction is completed. The server's state can be set from
within the database or from external programs to disable
certain functions during batch processing in order to
avoid flooding.
The automation scripts for parsing BLAST [14] and
HMMER [15] output are written in Ruby [16] making use
of the BioRuby library [17]. Sequences are scanned for
domains using the Pfam_fs release 19.0 database [18]
containing 8183 hidden markov models.
The web pages are generated as XML (XHTML with SVG
[19] data islands). We used SVG [19] for charts because of
the high display quality and the possibility of reuse in
print. The site makes extensive use of Ajax (Asynchronous
JavaScript and XML) in order to present the user with a
feature rich interface while minimizing the amount of
transferred data. All technologies used are freely available
and open source.
Database
The unique requirements of the system demand a custom
database schema. The schema is sequence-centric with an
additional emphasis on species since these two aspects are
the most important in mutual annotation and, therefore,
need to be represented in high detail (see additional file 1:

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:300

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/300

Database schema). Grouped around these central tables
are tables for literature and sequencing projects as well as
taxonomy and predicted domains.

Data entry is done using the iiwi system (Odronitz F.,
Lampetsdoerfer T., Dietrich D., unpublished results [21])
allowing for remote editing and access control.

The sequence table stores the protein sequence and the
corresponding sequence as derived from the multiple
sequence alignment of the protein (see Import/Export).
By relating a position in the alignment to the positions in
a set of protein sequences it is possible to retrieve homologous stretches from different sequences. In addition
there are fields for sequence classification and nomenclature, comments, legacy names, information about the
completeness of the sequence, its potential to be a
pseudo-gene, and links to records in NCBI's nucleotide
and protein databases [20]. The comment field is one of
the most important fields intended to contain information about differences of the database sequences to published sequences that may have resulted from wrong exon
predictions or sequencing errors. Records in the sequence
table are related to tables for proteins, species, and publications.

Automated processes
The database can trigger external programs upon insertion
or update of certain fields in the database tables by contacting the delegation server program, which can in turn
write computed data to the database (Fig. 1). When a protein sequence is inserted or changed a hmmpfam [22]
process is started scanning this sequence for putative
domains with Pfam [18] profiles. The obtained domain
identifier and the start and end positions together with the
E-value are stored in a database table. Upon insertion of a
new species record, the content of the taxonomy field is
automatically converted into a tree-representation of
interrelated taxon records. Each record contains the name
of the taxon, and a reference to the parent taxon. Then the
species record is connected to the common taxonomic
tree. This tree representation of the taxonomy allows for
convenient searching, browsing and selection of sub-trees
(Fig. 2).

Several versions can be assigned to each sequence so
changes and corrections can be tracked as more information becomes available. Furthermore, there are links to
tables containing automatically generated protein
domain predictions (see Automated processes).
Species are defined by a set of names. There are fields for
the scientific name of a species, the species abbreviation as
used to identify database sequences, and common names.
As some species are known by different scientific names,
fields containing alternatively used names are also
included. To account for the different usage of the scientific names, all possible names are listed and linked to the
corresponding reference record wherever species are listed
or used for selection via the interface. A comment field
may contain general information about the corresponding species, the specific strain used, or common and divergent features compared to closely related organisms. The
taxonomy field is converted automatically into a hierarchical representation of the taxa. (see Automated processes)
Proteins are stored with their name and abbreviation as
used in the database. Furthermore, classes of a certain protein can be grouped and categorized according to aspects
like cellular function or localization. The project table
includes information about the sequencing centres
including type of data and completeness. Publications can
be related either to a sequence to provide additional links
to biological information or to a sequencing project.

Import/export functions
Files containing protein sequences in FASTA-format can
be imported into the database to update existing or insert
new records in the sequence table (Fig. 1). A naming convention at all levels ensures the correct assignment of
sequences in a FASTA file to sequence records in the database. The sequence identifiers are a concatenation of species name abbreviation, protein name abbreviation,
protein class and protein variant. In contrast to the usage
of numerical database IDs, the naming convention thus
immediately provides the user with information about
the phylogenetic relation and possible functions of the
protein. Sequences and sequence alignments can be
exported from the database using filters to include only
certain proteins, protein classes, or sequences from species
in certain taxa. The resulting FASTA file also follows the
naming convention and therefore can be re-imported
after editing. Thus it is possible to retrieve a multiple
sequence alignment from the database, edit it manually
and write it back to the database. During import,
sequences with identifiers that do not match any record in
the database, induce the creation of a new database record
according to the information included in the identifier.

Utility and discussion
The requirements for Pfarao can be summarized as follows: The key component of the database is the protein
sequence that is obtained by manual annotation of
genome and EST data with the help of a multiple
sequence alignment. The sequence needs to be connected
to data that allows the useful interpretation of the results
concerning its biological function, and it needs to be

linked with primary databases like GenBank or PubMed.
To be useful for the specific protein community, whose
members are expected to work in all biological and medical sub disciplines, the information of the database has to
be presented in the most comprehensible way.
Web interface
Great attention has been paid to a versatile yet easy to use
web interface. We think that accessibility and high quality
representation is key to a productive usage of the system.

Data can be entered and edited using a series of forms and
lists. Relations are represented as pull-down menus.
Pfarao encompasses a live web front end that is generated
from the content of the database at each request and thus
always reflects the current data, eliminating the need for
manual updates. To browse the content of the database,
the user selects a set of proteins and protein classes, and is
then guided to refine the selection by choosing a set of

specific taxa or species. Taxa and species can either be
selected from tables containing specific subsets, or from a
tree representation of the taxa and species that is generated to match the protein and protein class selection. Taxa
and species can be browsed and selected by expanding/
collapsing and including/excluding subsections of the
tree, or by using shortcuts or auto-completion fields (Fig.
2). We consider the selection of specific species and taxa a
key feature for comparative analyses of protein inventories and diversity (Fig. 2).
Upon confirmation of the selection of protein and species, the system compiles a list of all sequences matching
the specified criteria and presents it as a list grouped by
species in taxonomic order. Additional data about the species like alternative names, links to sequencing centres
and publications, as well as detailed information about
the sequences including publications, comments, domain
organization, and the sequence data, can selectively be
shown or hidden (Fig. 3).

Screenshot of the species selection interface. The user can select all species or a subset of species. Taxa and species for which
no sequences for the selected proteins/protein classes exist are greyed out (taxa selection, model organisms) or are invisible
(tree). Each node of the tree can be expanded and collapsed. The auto-completion fields open and highlight the tree down to
the taxon/species typed. Common names like "dog" are also supported. All sections of the page respond to changes. Example:
Nothing is selected. User selects kingdom Fungi. This selects all phyla, classes, orders, species and model organisms that belong
to Fungi. Also the portion of the tree below Fungi is selected. User deselects Ascomycota. All elements react accordingly. User
selects Homo sapiens. User clicks 'Show' in the result section and is presented with a list of sequences from Homo sapiens and
all Fungi, excluding Ascomycota (see Fig. 3).

types of information are available for each species (publications, references to sequencing projects, taxonomy and name information) and each protein sequence (version history, alternative names, domain composition, publications, comments, source,
amino acid sequence, links to other databases). All the details can be shown (and hidden) selectively. This way, even long lists
can be viewed without cluttering the page. The data is retrieved on demand from the server via Ajax and does not have to be
downloaded to the user's computer if not needed. Cursor labels provide the user with a short summary of the information
behind the icons. A click shows the complete information. Additional cursors added to the figure to show cursor labels.

The system provides an integrated BLASTP [14] search and
is able to link the sequences in the BLAST database with
the records in the SQL database via an ID. Thus the user
can, apart from the sequence, immediately access all
related information. The organization of the database
lends itself to different types of statistical analysis. For
each protein, a set of tables and graphs can be generated.
These analyses provide important information for the
comparison of the protein inventory of specific taxa and
species, as well as important insights into the selected protein superfamily. The protein inventory table gives an
overview about the class distribution and the number of
class members of all or a number of selected species
(ordered by taxonomy). Color-coding of the cells helps to
quickly identify characteristic patterns of specific taxa.
Charts show the ratio of protein classes and the distribution of the molecular weight for a chosen set of classes. All
charts are generated on the fly in resolution-independent
SVG-code, so they can also be used for print.

Future developments
Pfarao provides a solid platform for additional features
and significant future developments of the system are
underway. The front end will be extended to allow the
graphical representation and fast browsing of large alignments of selected sequences that will be of great value for
mutational studies. The interface is also intended to support the generation of phylogenetic trees for a userdefined set of sequences. These extensions will increase
the transparency of the manual annotation process, as the
user will be able to look at the two basic sources of information about protein sequence relations. It is also
planned to incorporate the corresponding DNA data and
to track the various alternative splice forms of the proteins.
Case study
Pfarao has initially been developed for cytoskeletal and
motor proteins but can easily been adapted to any protein. The database for cytoskeletal and motor proteins is
called CyMoBase [23]. Our current in house database contains 3265 Sequences (3095759 amino acids) from 666
species, 494 publications, and 385 references to 165
sequencing projects but is being extended on a daily basis.
A portion of the data has been released in the publicly
available CyMoBase.
