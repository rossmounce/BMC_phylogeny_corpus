Abstract
Background: Aeromonas spp. have been regarded as "emerging pathogens". Aeromonads possess
multifactorial virulence and the production of many of these virulence determinants is associated
with high cell density, a phenomenon that might be regulated by quorum sensing. However, only
two species of the genus are reported to possess the luxRI quorum sensing gene homologs. The
purpose of this study was to investigate if the luxRI homologs are universally present in the
Aeromonas strains collected from various culture collections, clinical laboratories and field studies.
Results: Of all the 73 Aeromonas strains used in the study, seventy-one strains elicited acylhomoserine lactone-mediated response in multiple biosensor strains. However, dot blot
hybridization revealed that the luxRI homologs are present in all the strains. PCR amplification and
sequencing revealed that the luxRI homologs shared a very high percentage sequence similarity. No
evidence for lateral gene transfer of the luxRI homologs between aeromonads and other genera
was noted.
Conclusion: We propose that the luxRI quorum sensing gene homologs are universally present in
the genus Aeromonas independently from their origin. This study is the first genus-wide report of
the taxonomic distribution of the luxRI homologs.

Background
The genus Aeromonas is a medically important genus in
the family Aeromonadaceae within the γ-Proteobacteria [1].
Aeromonas species, referred to as "emerging pathogens"
[2], are suspected to cause multiple infections in humans
[3,4]. In addition, they cause diseases in amphibians, reptiles and fish [5]. They are more frequently isolated from
samples of medical importance than from environmental
sources [6,7]. Their multifactorial virulence determinants
include surface associated factors like adhesins, extracellular proteins like siderophores for iron acquisition, and

exoenzymes and exotoxins like α-haemolysin and serine
proteases amongst others. The expression of many of
these virulence determinants is associated with high cell
densities [8-11] and are therefore putatively under control
by quorum sensing.
Quorum sensing is a density-dependent regulation of the
gene expression by self-generated signal molecules, such
as the acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) in gram-negative
bacteria. In A. hydrophila, the serine- and metalloprotease
activities [12,13], biofilm development [14], and butanePage 1 of 11

diol fermentation [15] are under quorum sensing control.
Although, the AHL mediated production of extracellular
proteases in A. hydrophila is decreased in the presence of
long chain AHLs [12], mutations in its luxRI homologs do
not affect its virulence towards gnotobiotically cultured
Artemia franciscana [16]. Hence, a decrease in the expression of a virulence factor does not necessarily correlate
with decreased virulence. Unfortunately only two species
of this genus, A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida, are known
to harbour the quorum sensing mechanism as opposed to
the majority of Aeromonas spp. with known pathogenic
potential [17]. It therefore necessitates investigating the
distribution of this mechanism throughout this genus.
Despite the diversity of the phenotypes that are regulated
by the quorum sensing network, luxR and luxI constitute
evolutionary conserved gene families. luxRI homologs can
be identified in most species in which AHL based quorum
sensing is known to operate, although some alternative
AHL synthases do exist [18]. Species can also possess differing number of luxR and luxI homologs or even a luxR
homolog alone [19]. The AHL-mediated gene expression
machinery is reportedly conserved within a particular
genus and the species within that share very high
sequence similarities with each other. In-between various
genera within a family, even though there are certain
highly conserved regions, the overall levels of sequence
similarity are often very low and range between 18–25 %
and 28–35 % for LuxR and LuxI homologs, respectively
[20].
The environmental distribution of the AHL-mediated
gene expression systems amongst bacteria is very poorly
understood. Merely 2.2 % (21 bacterial genera) of the
total number of bacterial genera listed in the Bergey's
Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [21], are known to harbour the AHL producing species, and all of which belong
to the α-, β- and γ-Proteobacteria only [22]. Unfortunately,
at the species level this percentage drops to a fraction of a
percent. Although few reports are known about the AHLmediated gene expression by bacterial strains isolated
from contact lens wearers [23], marine snow [24], and
rumen [25], not many reports are available on the existence of this system across bacterial genera or within a
genus. For instance, only two species of the genus Aeromonas are known to harbour the genes for quorum sensing
mechanism [17]. The importance of this mechanism
demands that the existence and distribution of AHLmediated gene expression systems be studied across bacterial taxa.
With a view that there is a considerable sequence similarity in the AHL-mediated machinery within a genus, it may
be possible to PCR amplify the luxRI homologs either
individually or together. This hypothesis was tested in the

present study using the genus Aeromonas as a model system to investigate if the luxRI quorum sensing gene
homologs are universally present in this genus.

Results
AHL production by Aeromonas strains
A total of 71 strains tested positive for AHL production. Of
the 73 strains screened, 70 strains elicited AHL-mediated
violet pigmentation in the Chromobacterium violaceum
CV026 strain within 24 h. Amongst the three remaining
strains which tested negative with the CV026 assay, one
strain, Aeromonas sp. ATCC 43946T (Hybridization Group,
HG-13) elicited gfp expression in E. coli JM109 harboring
pJBA89 in 24 h as observed in CLSM imaging analysis
(Fig. 1). Two strains: A. hydrophila ATCC 7966T (HG-1)
and A. hydrophila CDC 0434-84 (HG-3) tested negative in
all the three bioassays. No variation in the observations
was noted when extracted AHLs from culture supernatant
were screened similarly. Surprisingly, no inhibition of violet pigmentation in the CV026 reverse assay was noted for
the three negative strains.
Molecular detection of the luxRI homologs
All the seventy-three strains possessed the luxRI homologs
as revealed by dot blot hybridization. Interestingly, the
three strains that tested negative with the CV026 bioassay
showed the presence of luxRI homologs (Fig. 2).
Although, the PCR amplification of the complete regulon
resulted in no success that of the individual gene fragments (luxR and luxI homologs) was successful. The
amplification of the luxR homolog using the gene specific
primer pair, QS-722F and QS-1444R produced a reproducible single DNA fragment (~790 bp) from seventy
strains. The three exceptions were: A. caviae strains RK
217455 and RK 25447, and the recently reported A. molluscorum LMG 22214 T [26]. The amplification of the luxI
homolog using the degenerate primer pair QS-24F and
QS-697R resulted in partial success. PCR amplification
with the primer pairs designed specifically for the luxRI
homologs from A. culicicola MTCC 3249T, AcuRF/AcuRR
and AcuIF/AcuIR, resulted in desired size fragment amplification for more strains. All these PCR products were then
purified, sequenced and confirmed to be luxRI homologs.
We were successful in PCR amplifying the luxR and luxI
homologs from 70 and 34 strains, respectively.
luxRI homolog sequence analysis
The luxR homologs showed a wide range of sequence similarity. The percentage sequence similarity ranged from
79.28–100 % corresponding to 0–161 nucleotide differences (Additional file 1 available online). Similarly, the
inter-species nucleotide substitution rates were spread out
(0.89–20.46 %). While the least values were shared
between the type strains of A. bestiarum/A. caviae and A.
bestiarum/A. encheleia, the maximum values were between

A. media (HG-5A)/A. culicicola. Similar nucleotide substitution rates were also observed at the intra-species level
(0.26–17.24 %). The luxR homologs varied in size from
777–786 nucleotides. A total of 331 variable positions
(42.11 % of the sequenced region) of which a very high
proportion of parsimoniously informative sites (Pi) was
observed (31.67 %). Indels were noted at specific positions in nine strains (Fig. 3). A. hydrophila ATCC 7966T
possessed a single triplet insertion (CAT) at position 402
while deletion of two nucleotide triplets was detected at
position 530 of the luxR homologs in six other strains (A.
sobria CIP 7433T; A. culicicola strains MTCC 3249T, SH and
SLH; A. veronii bv sobria CECT 4246; and A. trota AN-35).
The nucleotide positions are as per the luxRI homologs
[GenBank:X89469] in A. hydrophila [17].
The luxI homologs showed lower sequence similarity. The
percentage sequence similarity ranged from 69.34–100 %
(Additional file 2 available online). The luxI homolgs varied in length from 624–639 nucleotides. A total of 237 Pi
sites (82 % of the total 289 variable positions) were
observed. Similar to the luxR homologs, indels were noted
in the luxI homologs from nine strains. However, three of
these strains were different than the ones with indels in
their luxR homologs. These strains were: A. bestiarum
strains LMG 13448 and LMG 13662, and A. veronii bv

sobria AE-21. In addition, these indels were detected in
the 3' termini of the sequenced region with most lying in
the primer-binding region (data not shown).
Phylogenetic potential of luxRI homologs
The genus Aeromonas formed a distinct lineage, well separated from other genera in the class Proteobacteria for
which the luxR (Fig. 4) and luxI homologs (data not
shown) are known. However, some strains of other genera
grouped with different genus, indicating possible events
of lateral gene transfer (LGT) between them. Multiple tree
topologies obtained using other tree-building algorithms
were similar with some minor variations in the branch
lengths. The phylogenetic trees were based on the nucleotide sequences rather than the amino-acid sequences due
to the loss of information in the latter caused by synonymous substitutions as reported earlier [27]. The luxI
homologs, similar to the luxR homologs, possessed the
ability to discriminate the genus Aeromonas from the other
genera in the proteobacterial class. However, the inability
to sequence the luxI homologs from all the strains hampered further analysis for this gene.

Discussion
The disruption of quorum sensing has been suggested as
a new strategy for combating disease spread by pathogenic

data) confirmed a gene with close homology to iciA,
present downstream of the luxRI homologs. iciA is an E.
coli gene encoding a specific inhibitor of chromosomal
initiation of replication [31]. The presence of iciA in the
genus Aeromonas clearly implicates that cell division may
be linked to quorum sensing. The present study on the
distribution of the quorum sensing regulatory network in
the genus Aeromonas, therefore gains importance.

bacteria. Unfortunately, the scarcity of information on the
environmental distribution of this mechanism and the
fact that strains of the same species isolated from different
ecological niches might possess diverse physiological
characteristics, drastically limits the application of this
strategy on a genus-wide basis. For instance, species of the
genus Aeromonas have been isolated from diverse environments such as the midgut of Culex quinquefasciatus and
Aedes aegyptii mosquitoes [28,29], monkey faeces [30],
and bivalve molluscs [26], as well as from a variety of
foods such as vegetables, raw milk, ice cream, meat and
seafood [6,7]. The pathogenic potential of many species
of genus Aeromonas indicates the presence of common regulatory machinery amongst strains isolated from different
ecological niches. However, only two species of this genus
are known to possess the quorum sensing mechanism
[17]. In addition, only A. hydrophila has been studied in
great detail [12-15]. An understanding of the genus-wide
distribution of this mechanism in Aeromonas spp. is the
first step towards ascertaining if there are certain common
phenotypes under quorum sensing regulation in the
genus Aeromonas. This will allow successful implementation of quorum sensing based disease control strategies.
Cell division in the genus Aeromonas may be linked to
quorum sensing. Although, there is no experimental evidence, molecular studies in A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida [17] and our analysis of the quorum sensing network
in A. culicicola MTCC 3249T (K. Jangid, P. Verma, P. V. Par-

Earlier studies have reported that some bacterial strains
may possess diverse signalling molecules, which cannot
be detected by a single biosensor strain [32]. Using multiple biosensor strains would reduce such possibility.
Although, possible AHL production from the majority of
the strains was detected (Fig. 1), a conclusive evidence of
the presence of luxRI homologs was obtained only after
dot blot hybridization analysis (Fig. 2). We tested the
extracted AHLs to confirm possible inhibition of biosensor strains by some secondary metabolites in the culture
supernatant of the three negative strains. In addition,
AHLs from upto 100 ml of culture supernatant of these
three negative strains were also tested to determine if
insufficient AHL quantities yielded the negative results.
However, no variation in the results was noted. We
hypothesized that regardless of the extent of luxRI
homolog sequence similarity shared between Aeromonas
strains, the AHLs produced may be diverse and thus not
detected by the biosensor strains used. Gene sequencing
analyses further validated this hypothesis. The three
strains that tested negative in the CV026 bioassay or the
reverse assay shared very high luxR homolog sequence
similarity (94.58 % to 99.36 %) with the ahyR and asaR
sequences [17] (Additional file 1 available online). Moreover, indels were noted in a group of strains at two localized regions in the autoinducer binding domain (amino
acid 18–168) of the luxR homologs (Fig. 3). This domain
specifically binds to the autoinducer molecules and these
indels might therefore be important in autoinducer specificity.
The inability to PCR amplify the complete regulon and
the luxI homologs from all strains confirmed previous
observations that Aeromonas strains possess greater
sequence diversity in luxI as compared to luxR [17]. Preliminary analysis of the percentage sequence similarity
and the nucleotide substitution rates for the luxRI
homologs support this observation. Our ongoing analysis
of the quorum sensing network in A. culicicola MTCC
3249T further supports the hypothesis (Jangid et al.,
unpublished data). We noted the presence of indels in the
binding site of the designed degenerate primers for the
luxI homolog from this strain and a 10 % lower sequence
similarity value as compared to others [17]. This is contrary to the fact that the luxI homolog sequence similari-

ties between genera are higher than the corresponding
luxR homologs [20].
No evidence of LGT of the luxRI homologs to the genus
Aeromonas from another donor was found. All the Aeromonas strains grouped together in a single cluster that was
clearly separated from the other members within the Proteobacteria (Fig. 4). However, it is incorrect to conclude
that it probably did not occur. It might be possible that if
LGT occurred, the donor was probably an organism similar to Aeromonas but not so far included in the analysis. It
is even possible that the lineage is currently extinct. From
the depth of the branch (Fig. 4), it would seem likely that
this organism would moderately be related to Aeromonas
but certainly more related than any of the current genera
used for the analysis. In case, there was no LGT and if par-

alogy occurred, some aeromonads or their ancestors
might have had more than one gene for these proteins or
that the properties of the proteins might be different for
different aeromonads. Both of these scenarios have been
discussed in great deal earlier [33]. The same study also
reported that the overall congruity between the quorum
sensing genes and the rRNA trees is consistent with an
ancient origin for the quorum sensing proteins within the
Proteobacteria. Our results were however, incongruent with
these observations (data not shown). The potential of the
luxRI homologs as molecular chronometer and its comparison with the conventional molecular chronometers
for the genus Aeromonas has been studied in great detail
(K. Jangid, J. M. Gonzalez, W. B. Whitman, G. B. Nair, R.
Kong, M. S. Patole, and Y. S. Shouche, unpublished data).

Conclusion
In conclusion, using both conventional bioassay and
molecular approaches, we proved that all the Aeromonas
strains used in the study possess the quorum sensing
genes irrespective of the nature of the isolates, whether
clinical or environmental. The universal presence of the
luxRI homologs with high sequence similarity in this
genus makes it a potential target for treating Aeromonas
borne infections. An understanding of the signaling
mechanism in Aeromonas strains from a particular ecological niche would provide a model for bacterial communication among such strains. To our knowledge, this is the
first genus-wide study of the taxonomic distribution of
luxRI homologs and is the first step in assessing the significance of this mechanism both as a survival strategy and
in maintaining ecosystem function.

Methods
Bacterial strains, media, and culture conditions
A total of 73 Aeromonas strains collected from clinical as
well as environmental sources and different geographical
regions were used in the study (Table 1). Most of the clinical strains were isolated from patients with acute diarrhea
over a period of 2 years in Kolkata, India [34]. Eight clinical strains were isolated from stools of diarrhea patients
at Queen Mary hospital in Hong Kong, China. The eleven
environmental strains were isolated from ovary, salivary
gland, or midgut of wild mosquito species collected from
across India over a period of 2 years. All these strains were
identified based on conventional microbiological and
biochemical analysis. In addition, two recently reported
A. culicicola strains (2238A and 3037T) from a drinking
water supply in Spain were also included [35]. The AHL
responsive biosensor strains used were: Chromobacterium
violaceum CV026 [36], E. coli JM109 harboring plasmid
pSB403 [37] and E. coli JM109 harboring plasmid pJBA89
[38]. These three strains were selected based on earlier
reports [36-39] that they could detect a wide range of AHL
compounds (Table 2). Although, the plasmid pJBA89 [38]
was originally derived from pSB403 [37], the ribosomal
binding sites in the former was optimised to detect low
concentrations of AHLs and has a gfp-fusion which provides low background fluorescence [for details see [38]].
After arrival and/or collection, each bacterial strain was
checked for purity on solid medium, and its identity was
confirmed by partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. All
the strains used in the study were maintained on LuriaBertani (LB) medium at 30°C, except for the A. salmonicida strains, which were incubated at 25°C. Wherever necessary, the medium was supplemented with 50 μg of
ampicillin ml-1, 40 μg of kanamycin ml-1 or 20 μg of tetracycline ml-1. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the
optical density at 600 nm.

Screening for AHL production
For preliminary screening for AHL production by the
Aeromonas strains, 20 μl of the culture supernatant from
overnight growth was inoculated in wells created onto LB
agar plates seeded with 1 ml (OD600 = 1) of CV026 culture. Visible violet pigmentation was checked after 24–48
h incubation at 30°C. The assay with the other two biosensor strains was carried out as described earlier [40].
Bioluminescence was measured after 30 min incubation.
Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging
analysis of gfp expression by E. coli JM109 harboring plasmid pJBA89 was done at 10× using an argon laser at 488
nm on a Zeiss LSM510 (Jena, Germany). Synthetic AHL
standards: BHL (catalogue no. 09945; Fluka), HHL (catalogue no. 09926; Fluka), OHL (catalogue no. 10940;
Fluka), DHL (catalogue no. 17248; Fluka) and dDHL (catalogue no. 17247; Fluka) served as controls. Strains, tested
negative were processed for AHL extraction from 5 ml culture supernatant using dichloromethane (7: 3::supernatant: dichloromethane). A parallel extraction of the AHLs
from A. culicicola MTCC 3249T served as a control. The
dried extract was reconstituted in 50 μl HPLC grade acetonitrile, a 10 μl aliquot spot dried onto paper discs
(Whatman 3 M) and processed similarly as above. To
detect long-chain AHLs which antagonize activating signals, the three negative strains were also tested using the
CV026 reverse assay as described by Swift [39].
Dot blot hybridization, PCR amplification and sequencing
Genomic DNA was prepared by standard phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction [41]. For dot blot hybridization, 1–2 μg of genomic DNA was denatured and
spotted (2 μl aliquots) onto positively charged Nylon
membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech
UK Ltd.). Hybridization was performed at 50°C for 14 h.
Unbound DNA was washed off with 2× SSC/0.1 % SDS
for 20 min at room temperature followed by a second
wash with 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min at 42°C for
another 20 min. Intensifier screens (Imaging Screen-K,
Biorad, USA) were scanned after 30 min on Molecular
Imager FX (Biorad, USA). The A. hydrophila ahyRI fragment [17] was used as the heterologous probe. The probe
was random labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The
luxRI homologs were PCR amplified under following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, 35 cycles
of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for
1 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min followed by elongation at 72°C for 10 min. The details of the primers used
are given in Table 3. The PCR amplified products were
purified by PEG/NaCl precipitation and sequenced using
the PCR primers either on an ABI-310 or ABI-3730 automated DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide and protein sequence analysis was performed
with BLAST [42]. The sequences were aligned using the
CLUSTALW v1.83 at the European Bioinformatics site
[43]. The GenBank accession numbers for the sequences
are given in Table 1. In addition, the two previously
reported Aeromonas luxRI homolog sequences [GenBank:X89469 and U65741] were also used. The sequence
similarity matrix was prepared using the DNAdist program in the PHYLIP package [44] using the Jukes Cantor
corrections. The phylogenetic trees were constructed with
the neighbor joining method using Kimura-2-parameter
distances in MEGA v3.1 [45]. The resulting trees were
compared with the parsimony method (100 bootstrap
replicates) in the PHYLIP package and with the maximum-likelihood method using the fastDNAml program
[46].

Authors' contributions
KJ carried out the molecular genetic studies, sequence
retrieval and analysis and drafted the manuscript. KJ, RK,
MSP and YSS conceived of the study, and participated in
its design and coordination. YSS was also involved in the
analysis and interpretation of results and drafting the
