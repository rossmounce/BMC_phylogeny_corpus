Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by targeting messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) and causing mRNA cleavage or translation blockage. Of the 355 Arthropod miRNAs that have been identified, only 21
are B. mori miRNAs that were predicted computationally; of these, only let-7 has been confirmed by Northern blotting.
Results: Combining a computational method based on sequence homology searches with experimental identification based on
microarray assays and Northern blotting, we identified 46 miRNAs, an additional 21 plausible miRNAs, and a novel small RNA
in B. mori. The latter, bmo-miR-100-like, was identified using the known miRNA aga-miR-100 as a probe; bmo-miR-100-like was
detected by microarray assay and Northern blotting, but its precursor sequences did not fold into a hairpin structure. Among
these identified miRNAs, we found 12 pairs of miRNAs and miRNA*s. Northern blotting revealed that some B. mori miRNA
genes were expressed only during specific stages, indicating that B. mori miRNA genes (e.g., bmo-miR-277) have developmentally
regulated patterns of expression. We identified two miRNA gene clusters in the B. mori genome. bmo-miR-2b, which is found in
the gene cluster bmo-miR-2a-1/bmo-miR-2a-1*/bmo-miR-2a-2/bmo-miR-2b/bmo-miR-13a*/bmo-miR-13b, encodes a newly identified
member of the mir-2 family. Moreover, we found that methylation can increase the sensitivity of a DNA probe used to detect
a miRNA by Northern blotting. Functional analysis revealed that 11 miRNAs may regulate 13 B. mori orthologs of the 25 known
Drosophila miRNA-targeted genes according to the functional conservation. We predicted the binding sites on the 1671 3'UTR
of B. mori genes; 547 targeted genes, including 986 target sites, were predicted. Of these target sites, 338 had perfect base pairing
to the seed region of 43 miRNAs. From the predicted genes, 61 genes, each of them with multiple predicted target sites, should
be considered excellent candidates for future functional studies. Biological classification of predicted miRNA targets showed
that "binding", "catalytic activity" and "physiological process" were over-represented for the predicted genes.
Conclusion: Combining computational predictions with microarray assays, we identified 46 B. mori miRNAs, 13 of which were
miRNA*s. We identified a novel small RNA and 21 plausible B. mori miRNAs that could not be located in the available B. mori
genome, but which could be detected by microarray. Thirteen and 547 target genes were predicted according to the functional
conservation and binding sites, respectively. Identification of miRNAs in B. mori, particularly those that are developmentally
regulated, provides a foundation for subsequent functional studies.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small,
non-coding, single-stranded RNA. They comprise approximately 19–25 nucleotides that are embedded within the
stem regions of hairpin transcripts (called "pre-miRNAs")
[1-9]. The first miRNA genes, lin-4 [5] and let-7 [6], were
identified in Caenorhabditis elegans about a decade ago.
Many endogenously encoded miRNAs have been detected
in mammals, plants, insects, worms, and viruses through
cloning, Northern blotting, microarray assay, sequencing
of short RNA molecules [1-9], and computation [10-20].
By December 2007, 5,395 hairpin sequence entries, containing 5,234 mature miRNAs, have been stored in miRBase [21-23]. Sequence analyses have shown that some
mature miRNAs are phylogenetically conserved, particularly in the first 8 residues at the 5' end in species of the
same kingdom (let-7 miRNAs are present in the human,
mouse, rat, cow, dog, pig, chimpanzee, monkey, fish, and
various insects, including Bombyx mori (B. mori)) [21]. In
rare cases, mature miRNA sequences are conserved
between animals and plants. For instance, mir-854, which
is conserved in C. elegans, mouse, and human, has also
been identified in plants [24]. However, hairpin
sequences of precursor miRNAs are phylogenetically
diverse. In addition to these characteristics, the genomic
locations of miRNA precursor genes and the folding structures of miRNAs have been used to identify previously
unknown miRNAs [10-20]. Lai et al. (2003) [11] stated
that three characteristics allow miRNA genes to be identified using computational approaches: (i) miRNAs are generally derived from 70–100 nucleotide precursor
transcripts having an extended stem-loop structure; (ii)
miRNAs are usually conserved between genomes of
related species; and (iii) miRNAs display a characteristic
pattern of evolutionary divergence [10-20]. Additionally,
genomic mapping of known miRNAs has enabled identification of orthologous miRNAs in other species (e.g., B.
mori) where genomic annotations are lacking [25,26].
miRNAs are well-studied RNA interference (RNAi) molecules that silence gene expression of sequence-specific targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in all species in which
they have been found [27-29]. miRNAs silence gene
expression by inducing miRNA-guided mRNA degradation, or by inhibiting translation by forming a miRNAprotein complex that binds to targeted mRNAs [1-4].
Some miRNAs target the non-coding region of a RNA gene
transcript [29]. miRNAs are a class of small RNAs that
have temporal and spatial specific expression patterns,
and that have important roles in the development, proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and death of cells
[30-33]. miRNAs affect cell fate during all stages of life,
from renewable, pluripotent embryonic cells to fully differentiated cells; miRNAs can also affect aberrant cell
growth in some tumors and carcinomas [32]. The ability

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/248

of miRNAs to silence gene expression through a post-transcriptional mechanism has promoted their use as genetic
tools in basic mechanistic studies; miRNAs are also being
developed as biomarkers, therapeutic targets and therapeutic agents.
Based on computational cross-genome comparison predictions and experimental identifications, over 5,000
miRNAs have been identified in various organisms,
including 152 miRNAs from Drosophila melanogaster, 73
from Drosophila pseudoobscura, 54 from Apis mellifera, 45
from Anopheles gambiae, 21 from B. mori, 137 from C. elegans, and 541 human miRNAs (miRBase release 10.1,
December 2007). B. mori is a species of Arthropod, closely
related to Nematodes and Platyhelminthes. MiRBase contains 355 miRNA genes in Arthropods (mosquito, honey
bee and fruit flies), 232 in Nematodes (C. elegans and C.
briggsae) and 63 in Platyhelminthes (Schmidtea mediterranea) [34]. Of the 355 Arthropod miRNAs identified, 21 are
B. mori miRNAs that were predicted computationally by
our research group [19]; of these, only let-7 has been confirmed by Northern blotting [35,36].
In this study, we report the first set of B. mori miRNA genes
from larva, moth and pupa. We established our initial
computational method for predicting miRNAs by
genome-wide miRNA mapping using the available B. mori
genomic sequences and Arthropod miRNAs. We further
confirmed their identities using comprehensive microarray profiling and Northern blotting. miRNA targeted
genes were predicted according to functional conservation
and binding sites. Biological classification of predicted
targets was determined by GO analysis.

Results
Prediction of B. mori miRNAs
Based on the sequences of all miRNAs previously identified in Arthropoda, we searched the B. mori genome by
BLAST. According to the four criteria described in Materials and Methods, we identified 31 potential B. mori miRNAs and their precursor sequences. Information on
predicted B. mori miRNAs, including names, lengths,
source, and genomic position, are listed in Table 1. The
length of the 31 predicted B. mori miRNAs ranged from 19
nt to 26 nt. We used the mfold program to fold each of the
31 predicted B. mori pre-miRNA sequences, ranging in
length from 70 nt to 102 nt, and allowing G-U pairing,
into hairpin structures [37]. The free energy of folding for
these hairpin structures ranged from -24.3 kcal/mol to 48.4 kcal/mol.
miRNA microarray assay
Using the predicted B. mori miRNAs as guides, we
designed probes to hybridize to targets in total RNA isolated from B. mori pupae and moths. Probes were classi-

fied into one of three groups, i.e., those designed to detect:
1) the 31 predicted miRNAs and their opposite-strand
miRNAs; 2) the 704 known miRNAs in miRBase, which
consist of miRNAs from several species, including six
worm species, D. melanogaster (78 probes), D. pseudoobscura (4 probes), A. gambiae (14 probes), A. mellifera (7
probes), C. elegans (114 probes), C. briggsae (39 probes),
and human (448 probes); and 3) control sequences,
including the 5S rRNA of B. mori and D. melanogaster. The
chip contained 954 probes in total. Each probe was
repeated three times on the chip to ensure assay reproducibility.

stages are shown in Figure 2. In most cases, results
between spots for the same miRNA genes were very consistent in RNA isolated from B. mori pupa and moth (k =
0.908, b = 0.3104, R2 = 0.8025). However, expression levels of some miRNAs exhibited obvious differences
between the two developmental stages. Sequences exhibiting signal strengths of >80 were considered to be
detected miRNA sequences. We detected 114 small RNAs
from total RNA isolated from B. mori pupae and moths
based on this cutoff. We applied a more stringent analysis
by excluding miRNAs differing by only one single base in
their sequences or by two bases near sequence ends, and
identified 67 miRNAs and a novel small RNA. Of these 67
detected miRNAs, 27 miRNAs belonged to the 31 predicted miRNAs and 12 miRNAs were miRNA*s; another
28 miRNAs were detected only in the microarray assay

using probes designed to detect known miRNA from other
species. We used these 28 miRNA sequences as query
sequences to perform BLAST searches against the B. mori
genome. Seven of these sequences were identified in the
B. mori genome and their precursor sequences could be
folded into hairpin structures and, as such, these seven
sequences were likely to be B. mori miRNAs. We designated these sequences bmo-miR-13a*, bmo-miR-14, bmomiR-46, bmo-miR-46*, bmo-miR-71, bmo-miR-277 and bmobantam. Although bmo-miR-13a was one of the 31 miRNAs
that were predicted, it was not detected by microarray
assay, but its opposite-strand miRNA, named bmo-miR13a*, was detected. The remaining 21 miRNAs were

detected by microarray assay, but were not found in the
available B. mori genome (possibly because sequencing of
the B. mori genome is incomplete). We considered these
21 miRNAs to be plausible B. mori miRNAs. A novel small
RNA was found using a probe designed to detect the
known miRNA aga-miR-100. This small RNA was detected
by microarray and Northern blotting (Figure 3A) and was
identified in the B. mori genome, but its precursor
sequence failed to fold into a hairpin structure. This novel
small RNA was designated bmo-miR-100-like.
In conclusion, combining computational predictions
with microarray assays, we identified 46 B. mori miRNAs,

Identification and determination of development-specific
expression patterns of B. mori miRNAs by Northern
blotting
Northern blotting was done based on microarray assay
results to confirm the expression of B. mori miRNAs.
Expression of the 46 identified miRNAs, the novel small
RNA, and another 21 plausible miRNAs was investigated
by Northern blotting of small-sized RNAs isolated from
the larva, pupa, and moth stages of B. mori. Twenty-six
miRNAs were stably expressed in B. mori in at least one
developmental stage (Figure 3). Of these 26 miRNAs, 18
belong to the group of 46 miRNAs identified by microarray assay (Figure 3A) and 7 belong to the group of 21
plausible B. mori miRNAs (Figure 3B); the novel small
RNA bmo-miR-100-like is shown in Figure 3A.

13 of which were miRNA*s. We identified a novel small
RNA and 21 plausible B. mori miRNAs that could not be
found in the available B. mori genome, but which was
detected by microarray. Detailed information for these 46
miRNAs and the novel small RNA are listed in Table 1.
The 21 plausible B. mori miRNAs are listed in Table 1 of
Additional file 1.

Development-specific expression patterns for some B.
mori miRNAs were determined by Northern blotting.
Some B. mori miRNA genes were expressed only in certain
stages (Figure 3). bmo-miR-1, bmo-let-7a, bmo-miR-8, bmomiR-14, bmo-miR-276a, bmo-miR-279 were strongly
expressed in all developmental stages (larva, pupa and
moth). They were uniformly expressed, suggesting that
these miRNAs may play an important role in the regulation of some constitutive process in B. mori. Of these miRNAs, bmo-miR-8 has an opposite-strand miRNA, bmo-miR8*, which was detected by Northern blotting (Figure 3A)
at very low levels in larva, pupa and moth. bmo-let-7b,
bmo-let-7c, bmo-miR-9, bmo-miR-9*, bmo-miR-100-like,
bmo-miR-263a, bmo-miR-31 and bmo-bantam were
expressed in larva and pupa, but were not detected in
moth; of these miRNAs, bmo-miR-9 and bmo-miR-9* are
also complementary miRNAs. bmo-miR-281a, bmo-miR281a*, bmo-miR-281b*, bmo-miR-13b and bmo-miR-2b
were expressed most strongly in larva, although they were
also expressed in pupa and moth. bmo-mri-2a, bmo-miR100, bmo-miR-276b and bmo-let-7d were also expressed in
larva, pupa and moth; bmo-mri-2a and bmo-miR-100 were
expressed most strongly in pupa; bmo-miR-276b was
expressed most strongly in moth; bmo-let-7d was expressed
most weakly in moth. bmo-miR-277 was expressed only in
moth and not detected in larva and pupa; the precursor of
bmo-miR-277 was also detected [see Figure S1 of Additional file 1]. Similarly, bmo-miR-289 was expressed
weakly only in pupa and was not detected in larva and
moth. Expression of a miRNA in a specific developmental
stage may suggest a role for it in the developmental process.
Computational prediction of B. mori miRNA targets
In the TarBase database, there are 23 miRNAs that regulate
34 targeted genes in D. elanogaster. miRNA functions
could be evolutionally conserved between species such as
B. mori and D. melanogaster [38]. To deduce the function
of B. mori miRNAs, we searched for targeted genes of their

orthologous miRNAs reported in D. melanogaster in the
TarBase database [39]. In the 46 B. mori miRNAs identified, we found 11 miRNAs, belonging to 8 miRNA families; Drosophila orthologs of these 11 miRNAs have been
reported in TarBase and are known to regulate the expression of at least 25 genes. These 11 miRNAs may regulate
13 B. mori orthologs of the 25 Drosophila miRNA-targeted
genes according to binding [see Additional file 2]. BmomiR-133 may regulate two B. mori orthologs of Mus musculus miRNA targeted genes, SRF and Ptbp2 because of the
perfect binding between miRNAs and the complementary
sites. GO analysis showed that "nucleus" was over-represented for Drosophila orthologs of the 13 potential targeted genes.
We calculated the potential binding sites between miRNAs and the 3'UTR of mRNAs to determine the potential
miRNA targeted genes more globally. With settings
hybrid11 and hybridf22 described in Materials and Methods, we obtained 465 and 262 targeted genes, respectively. One hundred and eighty genes were involved in the
two settings simultaneously. Removing redundancy, 547
targeted genes including 986 target sites were predicted.
Of these binding sites, 338 had perfect base pairing to the
seed region of 43 miRNAs. Of the 46 identified miRNAs,
bmo-miR-279 was the only one for which we failed to find
target sites. Certain miRNAs may have more than one target, and some predicted targets may be regulated by more
than one miRNA [see Additional file 3 and Table 1]. Additionally, we found 61 3'UTRs that each contain multiple
potential binding sites to a single miRNA [see Additional
file 3]; these miRNA-mRNA duplexes showed higher specificity than others. Grun et al. (2005) predicted that at
least15% of D. melanogaster genes were regulated by at
least one known miRNA [38]. Using settings hybrid11
(hybridf22), we found that 28% (16%) of annotated
1671 3'UTR sequences (corresponding to 1671 genes)
had at least one binding site to miRNAs identified in this
study. Compared with hybrid11, hybridf22 showed a significantly higher specificity. Biological classification of
predicted miRNA targets was done by GO analysis to
obtain insight into the function of B. mori miRNAs. GO
analysis was completed by submitting gene sequences
online (see Materials and Methods). In the predicted targets with settings hybrid11 (hybridf22), 360 (214) genes
were assigned to the GO terms of "molecular function"
ontology by BLAST, "binding" and "catalytic activity" of
which over-represented for the 360 (214) genes; in the
"biological process" ontology, "physiological process"
over-represented among the 277(184) genes which were
predicted with setting hybrid11 (hybridf22) and assigned
to GO terms by BLAST [see Additional file 3].

Discussion
We identified 46 miRNAs from B. mori using computational analyses and microarray assays. Of these 46 putative miRNAs, 18 were also confirmed by Northern
blotting (Figure 3); although the remaining miRNAs were
not detected by Northern blotting, they were considered
to be miRNAs because they were detected by microarray
and their precursors could adopt a hairpin structure. The
reason why some miRNAs could not be detected by
Northern blotting may be due to expression below the
detection limit, or the very narrow temporal expression
window for these miRNAs.
Methylated RNA probes have been employed by some
research groups for RNA detection [40-42]. We found that
methylation of the DNA probe used to detect miRNA by
Northern blotting could increase sensitivity. Using methylated DNA probes, signal strength was significantly
improved in Northern blots for bmo-miR-14 and bmo-miR8*, which could not be detected using non-methylated
DNA probes [see Figure S2 of Additional file 1]. Improvement may be due to the effect of methylation on base pairing of the probe with the target, or on the secondary
structure of the probe.
Analysis of B. mori miRNAs clusters
miRNA clusters have been reported in many species. A
cluster usually contains two or three miRNA genes,
although larger clusters have also been identified, such as
the six-member hsa-miR-17 cluster [7,43,44] or the D. melanogaster cluster containing eight miRNA genes [45]. Clustered miRNA genes can share a high degree of similarity in
nucleotide composition, but occasionally the miRNA
sequences differ significantly [30,46]. Expression profiles
for clustered genes are also very similar, raising the possibility that transcription of these miRNAs is controlled by
a common regulatory element [47]. Examining the positions of the identified miRNAs in the B. mori genome, we
identified two miRNA clusters (Figure 4): bmo-miR-2a-1/
bmo-miR-2a-1*/bmo-miR-2a-2/bmo-miR-2b/bmo-miR-13a*/
bmo-miR-13b; and bmo-miR-275/bmo-miR-305/bmo-miR305*. The lengths of the two cluster sequences were 498
and 208 bp, respectively. Genes in the cluster containing
bmo-miR-2a-1/bmo-miR-2a-1*/bmo-miR-2a-2/bmo-miR-2b/
bmo-miR-13a*/bmo-miR-13b are members of the mir-2
miRNA family. This cluster contains bmo-miR-2a, which
can be derived from two different precursor miRNAs transcribed from two paralogous miRNA genes, bmo-miR-2a-1
and bmo-miR-2a-2. The opposite strand to bmo-miR-2a-1
also encodes a miRNA. Searching miRBase, we found that
the bmo-miR-2a sequence was identical to the dme-miR-2a,
dps-miR-2a, ame-miR-2, and aga-miR-2 sequences, but we
failed to identify any other miRNA that had the same
sequence as bmo-miR-2b (Figure 5); therefore, bmo-miR-2b
is a newly identified member of the mir-2 miRNA family.

Searching the D. melanogaster and A. gambiae miRNAs, we
found that corresponding mir-2 and mir-13 family members also assembled into clusters in these two species. mir2 and mir-13 repress translation of the target genes, grim,
skl and rpr, suggesting that they may be involved in regulating apoptosis [48]. The cluster bmo-miR-275/bmo-miR305/bmo-miR-305* is also found in D. melanogaster, D.
pseudoobscura and A. gambiae. bmo-miR-275 and bmo-miR305 belong to different miRNA families, mir-275 and mir305. The functions of these two miRNA families remain
unknown.
Analysis of B. mori miRNAs
The identified 46 B. mori miRNAs belonged to 29 miRNA
families based on sequence similarity (Table 2). Among
the 46 identified miRNAs, we found 12 pairs of miRNAs

and miRNA*s. Scanning miRBase, we determined that
seven of these 12 miRNA*s had not been reported. These
newly identified miRNAs are bmo-miR-2a*, bmo-miR-8*,
bmo-miR-13a*, bmo-miR-46*, bmo-miR-263*, bmo-miR279*, and bmo-miR-305*.
Observing the orthologous miRNA genes for each family
in miRBase, we found that 15 of the 29 families are exclusive to Arthropoda; the other 12 families are found in many
species, including five species of Arthropoda. miRNAs having the most orthologs are mir-133 and mir-9, which are
found in 25 and 23 animal species, including D. melanogaster and C. elegans.
We determined the number of orthologous and paralogous genes for each detected miRNA. The let-7 miRNA

family contains the most members; 77 let-7 family members were identified in miRBase [see Figure S3 of Additional file 1].
Analysis of B. mori precursor miRNA sequences
Variations in pre-miRNA sequences are related to their
evolutionary history [22], so we compared the sequences
of B. mori pre-miRNAs and members of the same family
of pre-miRNAs in the miRBase database (Table 2). The
number of the pre-miRNAs is greater than the number of
mature miRNAs because mature miRNAs can be derived
from two or more pre-miRNAs. This is consistent with the
literature: mature miRNAs are conserved, but pre-miRNAs
are diverse [23].

Members of the bantam, mir-71, mir-275, mir-277, mir-279
miRNA families have a high degree of similarity in their
precursor sequences. bmo-miR-279 and other mir-279 precursor sequences have sequence similarities of >55%;
bmo-miR-277 precursors share >56% sequence similarity;
bmo-miR-27 precursors share >57% sequence similarity;
bmo-miR-71 precursors share >59% sequence similarity;

and bmo-bantam precursors share >60% sequence similarity.
Based on the results of our sequence comparisons, we
determined the phylogenetic tree for each miRNA family
using the DNAStar MegAlign program to analyze evolutionary relationships between miRNA members from
each family. Many of the B. mori miRNA families were
found only in Arthropoda; their mature and pre-miRNAs
are highly conserved. For these miRNAs, we found that
these B. mori miRNAs have close evolutionary relationships with A. mellifera, and A. gambiae miRNAs. We found
that these B. mori miRNAs are located on the same
branches of the phylogenetic tree as related miRNAs from
D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, A. mellifera, and A. gambiae. The phylogenetic tree for the mir-1 and mir-184
miRNA family is shown in Figure 6; other detailed results
are listed in Additional file 4.
We compared the hairpin structures of B. mori miRNA precursor sequences to those of related D. melanogaster, D.
pseudoobscura, A. mellifera, and A. gambiae miRNA precur-

sor sequences. Conserved regions of the precursors are
found in two arms of the stem-loop structure. The results
of comparisons between the hairpin structures of bmomiR-1, aga-miR-1, ame-miR-1, dme-miR-1 and dps-miR-1
precursors are shown in Figure 7. Additional file 5 shows
the secondary structures of B. mori miRNAs. These results
strongly indicate that the identified 46 B. mori sequences
are miRNAs.
Computational prediction of B. mori miRNA targets
MiRNA can regulate the protein expression of genes based
on the level of complementarity between miRNA seed
sequences and binding sites on target mRNA [49-51]. For
animals, the seed sequences of miRNA can bind to com-

plementary sites on 3'UTR of its targeted gene. Complementary sites in targeted genes and seed sequences of
miRNAs may be conserved in various species; this may
result in the functional conservation of miRNAs, and the
orthologous miRNAs may regulate orthologs of the targeted genes. The prediction for miRNA targeted genes
according to functional conservation may offer additional
insights into the function of miRNAs. Grun et al. (2005)
computed the conserved regulatory microRNA-mRNA
relationships [38]. They found that 50 unique gene pairs
were predicted to be targeted by homologous microRNAs,
including 60 microRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships
[38]. Weaver et al. (2007) demonstrated that some microRNAs function in the same or similar way in Drosophila
and bee (e.g., mir-9a may control sensory organ precursors
(SOPs) between Drosophila and bee) [52]. Functional prediction based on cross-species conservation may provide
a reference for studying on the functions of B. mori miRNAs. Based on this method, we identified 12 miRNAs that
regulate 15 potential targeted genes [see Additional file 2].
Most Drosophila orthologs of these potential targeted
genes were the vital genes for development, including
transcriptional regulator, apoptosis-related genes and
genes involved in signal transduction pathways. mir-2
controls HLHmdelta, and mir-7 controls HLHm3,
HLHm5, HLHmgamma, M4 and TOM, in D. melanogaster;
these six genes are involved in the Notch signaling pathway. B. mori homologs [GenBank: Bmo.1984 and
Bmo.4220] of these six genes can bind perfectly to mir-2
(bmo-miR-2a, bmo-miR-2b, bmo-miR-13a* and bmo-miR13b) and bmo-miR-7, respectively. mir-2 and mir-7 may be
related to the Notch signaling pathway in B. mori; this
hypothesis is consistent with previous predictions
[38,53]. Cross-species comparisons allow for the identification of evolutionarily conserved and probable functional target sites. The 12 miRNAs could play parts in the
development of B. mori by regulating their targeted genes,
including the 15 potential targeted genes identified in this
study.
We predicted many miRNA targeted genes by calculating
target sites. Interestingly, we have studied B. mori profilin
gene [GenBank: EF112402]; there was not a linear relationship between the transcription level of this gene and
protein expression (data not shown). The long 3'UTR of
this gene was found to have nine potential binding sites
[see Additional file 3]. Profilin plays an important part in
biologically active cellular compartments [54]. It regulates
the polymerization, depolymerization, and dynamics of
actin, which are important for determining cell shape and
movement through the cytoplasm [54].
We can predict miRNA targets specifically according to the
level of complementarity between the seed region of
miRNA and 3'UTR of mRNA [49]. We set stringent set-

tings for base pairing of binding sites (see Materials and
Methods) based on this knowledge. Applying these settings, many targets predicted by functional conservation,
such as B. mori homologs of HLHmdelta and M4, would
not have been predicted because of stringent filtering of
the settings for miRNA-mRNA duplexes. However, using
the settings, the predicted binding sites of targets can bind

perfectly to miRNA, and the target sites belong mainly to
the three categories of known miRNA target sites classified
by Sethupathy et al. (2006)[49] [see Additional file 3].
Nevertheless, we identified too many potential binding
sites to test experimentally. According to a previous suggestion [49], genes with multiple predicted target sites (61
genes here accounting for 11% of all predicted targets)

should be considered strong candidates for future functional studies.

Conclusion
We identified 46 B. mori miRNAs, 13 of which were
miRNA*s, by combining computational predictions with
microarray assays. We identified a novel small RNA and
21 plausible B. mori miRNAs that could not be found in
the available B. mori genome, but which were detected by
microarray. The small novel RNA, bmo-miR-100-like, was
identified using the known miRNA aga-miR-100 as a
probe; it was detected by microarray assay and Northern
blotting, but its precursor sequences failed to fold into a
hairpin structure. Northern blotting revealed that some B.
mori miRNA genes were expressed only during specific
stages, indicating that B. mori miRNA genes have developmentally regulated expression patterns. For example, bmomiR-277 was expressed only during the moth stage. We
identified two miRNA gene clusters in the B. mori genome,
and bmo-miR-2b was identified as a new member of the
mir-2 family. We found that methylation of the DNA
probe used to detect the miRNA by Northern blotting may
increase its sensitivity. According to functional conservation in various species, we predicted that 11 miRNAs may
regulate 13 B. mori orthologs of the 25 known Drosophila
miRNA-targeted genes. A total of 547 targeted genes were
predicted from 1671 B. mori genes according to the target
sites predicted by settings hybrid11 and hybridf22. From
the predicted genes, 61 genes each contained multiple
predicted target sites and could be candidates for the functional study of miRNA. Three GO terms, "binding", "catalytic activity" and "physiological process", were overrepresented for the predicted genes.
Identification of putative miRNAs in other organisms is a
worthwhile approach for increasing the understanding of
the roles of miRNA. Identification of miRNAs in B. mori
may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying simple
and complex regulation of the 42-day lifecycle of B. mori,
which consists of six periods of ecdysis and four periods
of metamorphosis.

Methods
miRNA reference sets and the B. mori genome
Prediction and identification of miRNAs in B. mori is
shown in Figure 8. We downloaded 78 miRNAs from D.
melanogaster, 73 from D. pseudoobscura, 25 from A. mellifera, 38 from A. gambiae, and their precursor sequences
from MicroRNA Registry release 7.1 [21,22,55]. These
sequences were used as a reference set to predict miRNA
in B. mori. Genomic sequences for B. mori were downloaded from the Beijing Genomics Institute [25,26,56].
The total size of B. mori genome is 428.7 Mb, containing
23,156 scaffolds and 66,482 contigs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/248

Prediction of B. mori miRNAs by homology search
We used the sequences of known miRNAs (vide supra) and
pre-miRNAs in the reference set as query sequences for
BLAST searches against the B. mori genome; we used a
word size of seven and an E-value cutoff of ten.

Four criteria were used to predict B. mori miRNAs and premiRNAs according to BLAST search results: (1) there was
>80% similarity between each potential B. mori miRNA
and the corresponding miRNA in the reference set; (2) the
difference in the lengths between each potential B. mori
pre-miRNA and the corresponding pre-miRNA in reference set was <5-nt, and the corresponding positions of the
mature miRNAs in their pre-miRNAs were nearly identical; (3) the lowest free energy for folding of the secondary
structures for each potential B. mori pre-miRNA, as predicted by the mfold program [37], was less than -20 kcal/
mol; and (4) the secondary structures of the predicted premiRNA satisfied the requirements set out in reference
[23], i.e., a potential fold-back precursor structure must
contain the ~22-nt miRNA sequence within one arm of
the hairpin, and the hairpin must include at least 16 bp
within the first 22 nt of the miRNA. The structure should
not contain large internal loops or bulges, particularly not
large asymmetric bulges (<5-nt).
Paraflo™ miRNA microarray assay
Based on the predicted results and the sequences of
known miRNAs in Arthropoda, Nematoda, and human, we
designed probes to detect B. mori miRNAs in B. mori pupa
and moth stages by microarray profiling.

Microarray assays were done using a service provider (LC
Sciences, Houston, USA). The assay was done on 5-μg total
RNA samples from B. mori pupa (labeled cy3) and moth
(labeled cy5), which were size fractionated using a mirVana
Isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, USA); the small RNAs (<200
nt) were 3'-extended with a poly(A) tail using poly(A)
polymerase. An oligonucleotide tag was then ligated to the
poly(A) tail for later staining with fluorescent dye; two different tags were used for the two RNA samples in dual-sample experiments. Hybridization was done overnight on a
μParaFlo microfluidic chip using a micro-circulation pump
(Atactic Technologies, Houston, USA) [57]. On the microfluidic chip, each detection probe consisted of a chemically
modified nucleotide coding segment complementary to
the target miRNA (miRBase, http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/
sequences/) or other RNA (control or our defined
sequences) and a spacer segment of polyethylene glycol to
extend the coding segment away from the substrate. Detection probes were made by in situ synthesis using photogenerated reagent (PGR) chemistry. The hybridization melting
temperatures were balanced by chemical modifications of
the detection probes. Hybridizations used 100 L 6 × SSPE
buffer (0.90 M NaCl, 60 mM Na2HPO4, 6 mM EDTA, pH

6.8) containing 25% formamide at 34°C. After hybridization, signals were detected using fluorescence labeling with
tag-specfic Cy5 (for B. mori pupa and moth) dyes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Hybridization images were collected
using a laser scanner (GenePix 4000B, Molecular Device,
Sunnyvale, USA) and quantified. Data were analyzed by
first subtracting the background, and then normalized
using a cyclic LOWESS filter (locally-weighted regression)
[58]. For two color experiments, the ratio of the two sets of
detected signals (log2 transformed, balanced) and p-values
of the t-test were calculated; differentially detected signals
were those with p-values of < 0.01. Data classification
involved a hierarchical clustering method using average
linkage and Euclidean distance metric, and was visualized
with TIGR's MeV (Multiple Experimental Viewer; Institute
for Genomic Research).
Northern blotting
Total small RNA was isolated from the larva, pupa, and
moth stages of the silkworm using mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer instructions.

Liquid nitrogen was used to freeze samples before RNA
extraction. Small RNA was quantified by spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, USA). Twenty micrograms of
small RNA was loaded per lane, and resolved on a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea at 20 mA;
small RNA was transferred by electrophoresis from the gel
to a positively charged nylon membrane (Millipore, Shanghai, China) by a semi-dry transfer apparatus (ATTA) at 200
mA for 2 h. After electroblotting, membranes were ultraviolet crosslinked (120 mJ, 30 s) and baked for 1 h at 80°C.
DNA probes complementary to small RNA sequences were
5' end-labeled with γ-32P-ATP using a 5' DNA Labeling Kit
(Shenergy Biocolor, Shanghai, China). The membrane was
prehybridized in prehybridization solution (6 × SSC, 10 ×
Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS) at 64°C for 1 h. Membranes were hybridized in hybridization solution (6 × SSC,
5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS) containing 1–5 × 106
cpm 5' end-labeled antisense probes for 18–24 h with gentle agitation at 28°C. Blots were washed three times for 5
min each at 28°C with 6 × SSC and 0.2% SDS, and once at
42°C for 10 min. After the final wash, blots were wrapped

in plastic wrap and exposed to a phosphorimager screen
(Amersham, Piscataway, USA) according to manufacturer
instructions.
Computational prediction of miRNA targets
Functions of the identified B. mori miRNAs were analyzed
according to the functional conservation and the potential
binding sites between miRNAs and the 3'UTR of responding mRNAs.

Based on the Tarbase database [59], we searched for the
known targeted genes of Drosophila orthologs of identified
miRNAs. Their B. mori homologs and their 3'UTR were
subsequently obtained by the BLAST program. The B. mori
miRNA targeted genes were predicted according to the
binding between miRNAs and their complementary sites
on the 3'UTR of the B. mori homologs by the RNAhybrid
program [60].
In general, base pairing between miRNA and the complementary site on mRNA may provide a function prediction
for miRNA. We calculated the potential binding sites
between identified miRNAs and the 3'UTR of mRNAs of
B. mori genes using the RNAhybrid program [60]; we used
two settings to obtain specific binding sites. The first setting (P-value cutoff of 0.05, minimum free energy cutoff
of -20.0 kcal/mol, maximum internal and bulge loop size
of 1) was termed "hybrid11"; if maximum internal and
bulge loop size was 2 but the seed region of miRNA could
perfectly bind to 3'UTR of a gene (helix constraint of 2.7),
we also considered this gene to be a potential miRNA-targeted gene (this setting was termed "hybridf22"). The
functional annotation for predicted targeted genes were
analyzed using Gene Ontology analysis [61]. B. mori genes
were obtained from B. mori Genes Database constructed
by us, and which includes 1909 genes. From these genes,
1671 3'UTRs were obtained and used for predicting
potential targeted genes.
