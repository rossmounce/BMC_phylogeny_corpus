Role of a Fur homolog in iron metabolism in
Nitrosomonas europaea
Neeraja Vajrala1, Luis A Sayavedra-Soto1, Peter J Bottomley2, Daniel J Arp1*

Abstract
Background: In response to environmental iron concentrations, many bacteria coordinately regulate transcription
of genes involved in iron acquisition via the ferric uptake regulation (Fur) system. The genome of Nitrosomonas
europaea, an ammonia-oxidizing bacterium, carries three genes (NE0616, NE0730 and NE1722) encoding proteins
belonging to Fur family.
Results: Of the three N. europaea fur homologs, only the Fur homolog encoded by gene NE0616 complemented
the Escherichia coli H1780 fur mutant. A N. europaea fur:kanP mutant strain was created by insertion of kanamycinresistance cassette in the promoter region of NE0616 fur homolog. The total cellular iron contents of the fur:kanP
mutant strain increased by 1.5-fold compared to wild type when grown in Fe-replete media. Relative to the wild
type, the fur:kanP mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to iron at or above 500 μM concentrations. Unlike the wild
type, the fur:kanP mutant was capable of utilizing iron-bound ferrioxamine without any lag phase and showed
over expression of several outer membrane TonB-dependent receptor proteins irrespective of Fe availability.
Conclusions: Our studies have clearly indicated a role in Fe regulation by the Fur protein encoded by N. europaea
NE0616 gene. Additional studies are required to fully delineate role of this fur homolog.

Background
The molecular basis for the coordinated regulation of
iron acquisition systems by iron was first described for
Escherichia coli [1]. Several bacteria are now known to
regulate their iron acquisition systems via Fur (ferric
uptake regulator) [2-5]. Fur is a sequence-specific DNAbinding protein that acts mainly as a negative regulator
of transcription in vivo by complexing with ferrous (Fe2+)
ion to repress the expression of iron-regulated genes [6].
Fur also activates the expression of many genes by either
indirect or direct mechanisms [7]. Mutations in the fur
gene resulted in constitutive expression of siderophores
and outer membrane Fe3+-siderophore receptors potentially required for iron uptake [8].
Nitrosomonas europaea is an aerobic chemolithoautotroph that uses NH3 and CO2 for growth [9]. Mechanisms for iron transport are essential to this bacterium
for maintaining the many cytochromes and other hemebinding proteins involved in ammonia metabolism

[10,11]. The genome of N. europaea has 4% of its genes
dedicated for iron acquisition, but no evidence for siderophore production was found [9]. N. europaea’s inability to produce siderophores in Fe-replete or Fe-limited
media was further confirmed by universal Chrome
Azurol S assay [12]. N. europaea responds to iron limitation by elevating production of Fe 3+ -siderophore
receptors normally repressed under iron-replete conditions [13,14]. Several N. europaea iron-repressible genes
contain sequences similar to the E. coli Fur box (unpublished data) in their promoter regions; hence it is likely
that a Fur-like repressor regulates iron uptake genes in
N. europaea as well. Indeed, sequence annotation of
N. europaea genome revealed three genes encoding fur
homologs (NE0616, NE0730, NE1722) that contain
characteristic Fur domains [9].
Multiple fur homologs have been described for several
bacteria. Different species have a variable number of
genes bearing the Fur domain. For example, E. coli [15]
has two, Bacillus subtilis [16], Mycobacterium smegmatis
have three, Staphylococcus aureus and some species of
Brucella have four and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis has five fur homologs [17]. The apparent redundancy

in fur homologs has been clarified by a considerable
amount of experimental data obtained from genetic and
biochemical analysis in bacteria such as E. coli and
B. subtilis [15,16,18-20]. The experimental data suggests
that the Fur protein family has several subclasses with
different functions [19]. The major Fe-sensing Fur subclass is mainly involved in the control of iron homeostasis [21]. A second subclass controls the expression of
genes involved in the response of bacteria to oxidative
stress (i.e. PerR), but it does not appear to be involved
in the cellular response to iron [16]. A third subclass
called Zur (zinc uptake regulator) controls the uptake of
zinc in E. coli [15,20] and B. subtilis [18].
The Fe-sensing Fur protein has been extensively studied and is shown to act as a global regulator in response
to environmental iron concentration due to its involvement in the regulation of activities as varied as the acid
tolerance response, the oxidative stress response, metabolic pathways, and virulence factors [6]. In this study,
we aimed to characterize the regulatory role of a fur
homolog from N. europaea. Using genetic complementation studies, we demonstrated that one fur homolog
(NE0616) out of three in N. europaea encoded a functional Fur protein. Here we report the construction of
the N. europaea fur promoter knockout mutant (fur:
kanP) strain, its effect on the expression of Fe-regulated
proteins and the physiology of N. europaea.

Results
Sequence analysis of N. europaea fur homologs

The three N. europaea Fur-like repressors encoded by
NE0616, NE0730, NE1722 are only distantly related to
each other with 25% to 35% amino acid identity. The
Fur homolog encoded by NE0616 is most similar (~84%
similar to E. coli Fur protein) in sequence to various
Gram-negative Fe-sensing Fur proteins. The publication
of the crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Fur protein provided considerable insight into its 2
metal binding sites. Binding Site 1 represents the putative iron binding regulatory site and is coordinated by
amino acids H86, D88, E107, and H124 and Site 2 is
coordinated by H32, E80, H89 and E100 [19]. All these
residues are conserved only in the N. europaea NE0616
Fur homolog but not in Fur homologs encoded by
NE0730 and NE1722 (Figure 1). Phylogenetic analysis of
Fur homolog coding sequences from N. europaea with
Fur proteins from other bacteria placed NE0616 in the
group B comprised of Fe-sensing Fur proteins, NE1722
in the group A comprised of Zn-sensing Zur proteins.
Surprisingly, NE0730 Fur homolog was also placed in
group B. No Fur homologs of N. europaea grouped
with peroxide sensing PerR proteins i.e., in group C
(Figure 2).
Based on well-studied model systems, expression of
the fur gene itself is iron regulated and there is strong

evidence that this is through a mechanism of autoregulation [34,35]. Fur recognizes and binds specifically to a
DNA sequence, known as the Fur box, that is typically
located in proximity to the -10 and/or -35 promoter
elements of target genes [6]. Analysis of several

Fur-binding sites allowed the early definition of a 19-bp
inverted repeat consensus Fur box in E. coli [6]. Since
then, canonical Fur boxes have been described in several
bacteria such as P. aeruginosa [36], Neisseria gonorrhoeae [37] and Vibrio cholerae [38]. The canonical Fur

Vajrala et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:37

box identified by B. subtilis Fur revealed a different conserved 15-bp (7-1-7) inverted repeat present twice
within this 19-bp consensus sequence [39]. We have
used an in silico approach, fed with experimentally confirmed N. europaea Fur boxes (unpublished data), to
identify candidate Fur-binding sites in promoter regions
of all 3 N. europaea fur homologs. A potential Fur box
(5’-TAATAATACGTATCTTTAT-3’) in the promoter
region of NE0616 gene, -121 bp upstream of the proposed initiation of translation of the fur gene was found.
We were unable to find potential Fur boxes in the promoter region of the other N. europaea fur homologs,
NE0730 and NE1722.
Complementation of an E. coli fur mutant by N. europaea
fur homologs

In order to determine which fur homolog of N. europaea encodes the Fe-sensing Fur protein, pFur616,
pFur730 and pFur1722 plasmids (Table 1) were used to
transform the E. coli fur mutant H1780 [40]. E. coli
H1780 strain was engineered to be fur deficient and to
include the Fur-regulated gene fiu fused to a promoterless lacZ gene. This reporter gene, fiu-lacZ, cannot be
repressed in this strain due to the fur mutation, and
therefore the gene encoding the enzyme b-galactosidase
is constitutively expressed and the strain always shows
Lac+ phenotype [40]. The pFur616-kanC (Table 1) plasmid carrying kanamycin resistance cassette (Kmr) insertion in the C-terminal region of NE0616 gene was used
to transform H1780 as a negative control.
All strains evaluated for Lac phenotype were grown on
McConkey Lactose plates with 30 μM iron supplement,
since iron is required to ensure that Fur is functional as
a repressor [6]. In these studies, E. coli H1780, H1780
(pFur616), H1780 (pFur616-kanC), H1780 (pFur730)
and H1780 (pFur1722) strains were compared. Lac +
phenotype was observed for E. coli H1780 whether
grown in the presence or absence of added Fe supplement as predicted since it is deficient in Fur protein
(data not shown). Complementation of E. coli H1780
with pFur616 rescued the Fur defect of this strain and
resulted in the repression of transcription of the fiulacZ reporter gene, as shown by the Lac - phenotype
(Figure 3A; upper left quadrant). When pFur616-kanC
plasmid containing the disrupted NE0616 gene, was
transformed into the E. coli H1780 mutant, Lac+ phenotype was maintained (Figure 3A; upper right quadrant).
When pFur730 and pFur1722 plasmids containing the
N. europaea fur homologs NE0730 and NE1722 were
transformed separately into E. coli H1780 strain, Lac+
phenotype was observed (Figure 3A; lower left and right
quadrants). These results clearly demonstrate that the
N. europaea NE0616 fur homolog is expressed in E. coli
in a functional form and is capable of regulating the

Fur-dependent fiu promoter in H1780. The other
N. europaea fur homologs (NE0730 and NE1722) were
not capable of regulating the fiu promoter in H1780.

Several studies have employed E. coli H1717 strain to
allow the detection of iron-regulated promoters in bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium
[41,42]. E. coli H1717 strain has a chromosomal ironregulated fhuF promoter fused to lacZ. This fusion is
exceptionally sensitive to small changes in iron concentration because of the weak affinity of the fhuF promoter for the Fur-Fe2+ repression complex. Introduction of
a multi-copy plasmid carrying Fur-binding sites into the
test strain depletes the intracellular Fur pool. This gives
rise to the dissociation of the repressor from the fusion
promoter, thereby allowing expression of enzyme
b-galactosidase. We have screened plasmids pFur616
carrying intact Fur box and pFur616-kanP carrying disrupted Fur box using E. coli H1717 strain to determine
NE0616 Fur box functionality. The pFur616-kanC plasmid (Table 1) carrying Kmr insertion in the C-terminal
region of NE0616 gene was also used to transform
E. coli H1717 as a positive control.
In these studies, E. coli H1717 in the presence and
absence of Fe supplement, H1717 (pFur616), H1717
(pFur616-kanP) and H1717 (pFur616-kanC) strains were
compared. Lac - phenotype was observed for E. coli
H1717 when grown in the presence of 30 μM Fe supplement, since it does not carry any multi-copy plasmid
with a functional Fur box on it (Figure 3B upper left
quadrant). Lac+ phenotype was observed when H1717
was grown with no added Fe supplement, since there is
not enough Fe to suppress fhuF-lacZ fusion (Figure 3B;
upper right quadrant). When pFur616 carrying putative
Fur box was transformed into E. coli H1717 and the
resulting strain was grown in presence of 30 μM Fe supplement, it resulted in derepression of the fhuF-lacZ
reporter gene, as shown by the Lac+ phenotype (Figure
3B; lower left quadrant). This result indicates that the
predicted Fur box is functional and must have titrated
the intracellular Fur-Fe pool. When a pFur616-kanP
plasmid containing the disrupted NE0616 Fur box, was
transformed into the E. coli H1717 strain, Lac- phenotype was restored (Figure 3B; lower right quadrant) indicating that the Km r insertion led to disruption of Fur
box functionality. When a pFur616-kanC plasmid containing Km r insertion in the C-terminal region of
NE0616 gene was transformed into E. coli H1717 strain,
Lac+ phenotype was observed (data not shown) indicating that Kmr in C-terminal region of NE0616 did not
affect its Fur box functionality. These results demonstrate that the promoter of N. europaea NE0616 fur

Isolation of the N. europaea fur:kanP mutant strain

To address the physiological role fur plays in N. europaea,
we attempted to generate an N. europaea fur null mutant
but were unsuccessful. However, we were successful in
isolating an N. europaea fur:kanP mutant strain with Kmr
inserted in the Fur box located in the promoter region of
NE0616 gene (Figure 4A). The pFur616-kanP plasmid was
electroporated into N. europaea wild-type cells. The fur:
kanP mutant was obtained through homologous recombination and confirmed by PCR (data not shown) and
Southern hybridization (Figure 4B). The fur probe
detected a 3.96 Kb EcoR1 fragment and a 4.85 Kb Pst1
fragment in wild type and a ~ 5 Kb EcoR1 fragment and a

~ 4.3 Kb Pst1 fragment (calculated size based on the DNA
sequences) in fur:kanP mutant strain. The kanamycincassette probe detected the same ~ 5 Kb EcoR1 fragment
and the ~ 4.3 Kb Pst1 fragment in fur:kanP mutant but
not in the wild type. These results confirm that a single
copy of Kmr was correctly inserted in the Fur box located
in the promoter region of NE0616 gene of the N. europaea
genome (Figure 4A). A fur transcript was not detected in
the fur:kanP mutant by either RT-PCR or qRT-PCR analysis (up to 28 cycles) indicating the inactivation of fur gene
due to Kmr insertion in its promoter region. Transcripts
of ammonia monooxygenase C (amoC) component used
as positive control both for the efficiency of the RT-PCR
procedure and for RNA and cDNA recovery showed no
significant difference in expression in wild type and the
fur:kanP mutant (data not shown).

Effect of fur:kanP mutation on growth of N. europaea

Growth of the N. europaea fur:kanP strain was compared to
that of the wild-type strain in both Fe-replete (10 μM Fe)
and Fe-limited (0.2 μM Fe) media. Surprisingly, there was
no significant difference in growth of fur:kanP in both Fereplete and Fe-limited media compared to the wild-type
strain (Figure 5A). The fur:kanP mutant did not exhibit a
growth advantage over the wild type when iron was limiting
or show increased sensitivity to iron-induced redox stress
when grown in the presence of Fe (up to 250 μM Fe; data
not shown). However, growth of fur:kanP mutant was
affected when grown in medium containing 500 μM Fe
(Figure 5B). The mutant was unable to grow in media containing more than 500 μM Fe (data not shown). Growth of
wild type was inhibited only when concentrations of Fe
exceeded 1 mM [14].
N. europaea can use the siderophore ferrioxamine for
its iron uptake after a 3 to 4 day lag period suggesting
that the ferrioxamine uptake system in N. europaea
requires induction [13,14]. When N. europaea fur:kanP
mutant was grown in Fe-limiting media containing ferrioxamine, there was no lag phase (Figure 5B) indicating
that the ferrioxamine uptake system was already induced
in the fur:kanP mutant.

Effect of fur:kanP mutation on induction of Fe-regulated
outer membrane proteins in N. europaea

Previous studies have shown that N. europaea grown in
Fe-limited medium stimulated expression of several
Fe-regulated outer membrane proteins (TonB-dependent
receptors) with molecular masses of ~ 80 kDa [13,14].
To determine whether the expression of these proteins
was regulated by fur, the N. europaea wild type and the
fur:kanP mutant strains were cultured in Fe-replete and
Fe-limited media and their total outer membrane proteins were isolated. SDS-PAGE analysis of the outer
membrane protein profiles demonstrated that fur:kanP
mutant shared a major protein band (Figure 6) with
wild type cells grown in Fe-limited media irrespective of
the concentration of iron in the medium. This band
contained several TonB-dependent OM Fe 3+ -siderophore receptors [13,14]. This result is consistent with
the model in which the TonB-dependent receptors with
putative roles in iron uptake are regulated by fur [6].
Effect of fur:kanP mutation on Fe and heme c contents of
N. europaea

systems constitutively (with respect to iron), and have

increased free cellular iron levels (although total cellular
iron levels are actually reduced, due to low levels of
iron-storage and iron-containing proteins) [43,44]. To
determine the effect of fur:kanP mutation on iron contents of N. europaea, wild type and fur:kanP mutant

cells were cultured in Fe-replete and Fe-limited media
and their total cellular iron contents were measured by
ICP-OES analysis. N. europaea Fe-limited cells showed
significantly (P-value <0.0001) lower total cellular iron
contents compared to Fe-replete cells irrespective of the

fur mutation as observed previously (Table 2) [14]. The
fur:kanP mutant had 1.5-fold significantly (P-value
<0.001) more total cellular iron than the wild-type cells
when grown in Fe-replete media (Table 2). The total
iron contents of wild type and the fur:kanP mutant did

not show significant (P-value = 0.47) variation when
grown in Fe-limited medium (Table 2). The fur:kanP
mutation also influenced both the amount of soluble
cytochromes produced and the proportion of iron distributed to cytochromes (Table 2). These data suggest
that in N. europaea, Fur regulates the concentration of
intracellular iron through modulation of iron acquisition
and iron consumption, and that, in the absence of Fur,
N. europaea is unable to regulate its iron acquisition.

membrane Fe-siderophore receptors indicated by * was observed in

As indicators of the overall cell activity, NH 4+ - and
NH2OH-dependent O2 uptake rates in wild type and fur:
kanP mutant cells grown in Fe-replete and Fe-limited

showed significantly (P-value <0.0001) lower activities
compared to Fe-replete cells irrespective of the fur mutation as observed previously (Table 2) [14]. The activities
of wild type and fur:kanP mutant strains did not show
significant (P-value ≤ 0.4) variation when grown in Fereplete media (Table 2). The NH4+-dependent O2 uptake

and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase activity, when measured at per mg basis were not affected; however the
NH2 OH-dependent O 2 uptake activity, which requires
hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, but not ammonia monooxygenase activity, was significantly (P-value <0.0001)
two-fold lower in fur:kanP Fe-limited cells compared to
wild type Fe-limited cells (Table 2). This result is consistent with our observation of lower heme contents in fur:
kanP mutant than wild type. Hydroxylamine oxidoreductse contains 24 hemes per enzyme [45] and the lower

NH2OH-dependent O2 uptake activity in Fe-limited cells
of fur:kanP mutant than wild type might be due to the
low availability of heme under Fe-limited conditions.
This data also suggests that the fur:kanP mutation led to
an improper balance of iron allocation in N. europaea.

Discussion
We provide several lines of evidence that the Fur homolog encoded by N. europaea gene NE0616 is the Fesensing Fur protein. First, we have shown that NE0616
shares all eight of the metal binding amino acid residues
of P. aeruginosa Fur (Figure 1) [19] and that the Fur
homolog encoded by NE0616 is clustered with Fesensing Fur proteins from other bacteria (Figure 2). An
E. coli Fur titration assay (FURTA) system for Fur analysis was utilized as a second method to confirm that the
cloned NE0616 fur encodes a functional protein. The
H1780 (pFur616) strain carrying NE0616 fur homolog
on a plasmid was evaluated for its ability to utilize lactose as described by Hantke et al., [40]. Utilization of
lactose by H1780 (pFur616) strain was detected by color
change of colonies from white to red on McConkey lactose plates indicating the formation of lactic acid. Lactose utilization was not detected when H1780 strain
carrying plasmids pFur616-kanC, pFur730, pFur1722
were plated on McConkey lactose plates (Figure 3A).
One of the major limitations in our research on the
role of Fur has been the inability to make a fur null

mutant. Null mutations have been successfully isolated
for E. coli [46,47], V. cholerae [48], Shigella flexneri [49],
Neisseria meningitidis [34]. Unsuccessful attempts to
isolate insertional null mutants were reported for P. aeruginosa [50], Pseudomonas putida [51], and N. gonorrhoeae [52]. To date, multiple attempts to generate a
N. europaea fur mutant have been unsuccessful. Loss of
the fur gene may be a lethal mutation in N. europaea, as
occurs in some other gram-negative bacteria [50]. However, we were successful in generating an N. europaea
fur promoter knockout mutant (fur:kanP) (Figure 4A).
Southern analysis with probes internal to fur or the Kmr
corroborated insertion of Kmr in the promoter region of
the fur gene (Figure 4B) and hence fur:kanP mutant
strain was selected for further analysis. Although we
were unable to detect the NE0616 transcript in fur:kanP
mutant strain by RT-PCR or qRT-PCR, it is possible
that there is some leaky transcription of fur in our
mutant strain, since it is a promoter knockout mutant.
This could be the reason why we were able to generate
a promoter knockout mutant but not a fur null mutant.
The effects of fur:kanP mutation on N. europaea were
broad. Inactivation of the fur gene (resulting in deregulation of iron metabolism) increases sensitivity to redox
stress when grown under iron-rich conditions in some
bacteria such as E. coli [53]. The N. europaea, wild-type
and the fur:kanP mutant strain showed similar growth
patterns when grown in Fe-replete (10 μM Fe) and

Vajrala et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:37

Fe-limited (0.2 μM Fe) media (Figure 5A). However, the
fur:kanP mutant did not grow well when cultured in
media containing 500 μM iron (Figure 5B). The fur:
kanP mutant was unable to grow beyond 500 μM Fe
concentrations while the wild-type strain was able to
withstand iron concentrations up to 1 mM (data not
shown). These results indicate that N. europaea Fur
plays a role in regulating uptake of iron when present in
excess and also probably helps to overcome oxidative
stress.
Increased intracellular free iron is likely to result from
deregulated iron uptake by the fur mutant [43]. The
N. europaea fur:kanP mutant strain grown to mid exponential phase in Fe-replete media (10 μM Fe) contained
1.5-fold higher total cellular iron than that of the wildtype strain as measured by ICP-OES (Table 2). Our
measurements of total acid-soluble non-heme iron cannot distinguish between free iron and iron bound to
proteins. Hence we measured the heme contents of wild
type and fur:kanP mutant strains and observed that the
fur:kanP mutant had 1.4-fold lower heme contents compared to wild type (Table 2). In addition, the activity of
iron-rich hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme was
lower in fur:kanP mutant strain (Table 2). These results
indicated that the balance between acquiring enough
iron and allocating it to various Fe-dependent proteins
is lost in N. europaea fur:kanP mutant.
N. europaea protein profiles showed over expression
of several outer membrane proteins upon Fe-limitation
[13,14]. We have observed similar over expression of
outer membrane proteins in N. europaea fur:kanP
mutant (Figure 6 band indicated by *) irrespective of
iron availability. These data are consistent with previous
studies describing fur mutations in other bacterial species [54,55].

Conclusions
In summary, we have identified and characterized
through insertional inactivation one of the three
N. europaea Fur homologs. The N. europaea Fur protein
encoded by gene NE0616 has extensive homology to the
E. coli Fur protein and was able to complement an
E. coli fur mutant. The N. europaea fur:kanP mutant is
unable to regulate its intracellular iron and heme concentrations and appears to induce its iron acquisition
systems constitutively. Additional studies are required to
fully delineate the role of this N. europaea fur homolog.
Methods
Bacterial cultures and siderophore feeding experiments

N. europaea (ATCC 19178) was cultured as described
with minor modifications [22,23]. The standard
(Fe-replete) medium contained 10 μM Fe 3+ (FeCl 3 )
complexed with EDTA to prevent Fe precipitation.

Page 10 of 13

Fe-limited medium was made from reagent-grade chemicals, without addition of any Fe salt, and contained
0.2 μM Fe [14]. All media, buffers and other reagents
were made in double-deionized water. All glassware was
soaked in 1% HNO3 overnight, and then rinsed thoroughly with double-deionized water. Fe-free Desferal
(deferoxamine/DFX mesylate) was purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Desferal was dissolved in double
deionized water, filter sterilized, and added to Fe-limited
medium in the siderophore feeding experiments. In this
study 10 μM Desferal was used to ensure the complete
chelation of Fe (0.2 μM) in the Fe-limited medium.
N. europaea cultures were grown at 30°C on a rotary
shaker, and mid-exponential-phase cells were collected
by centrifugation and thorough washes for the analyses.
E. coli DH5a, E. coli H1780 strain lacking fur gene, and
E. coli H1717 strain were cultured on Luria-Bertani (LB)
agar plates or in liquid LB medium in the presence
of the appropriate antibiotic (ampicillin [100 μg ml-1]
and/or kanamycin [20 μg ml-1 ]) under the conditions
described above.
DNA preparation, PCR, cloning, mutagenesis and mutant
isolation

General DNA preparation, restriction digestions and
agarose gel electrophoresis were done as described by
[24]. The three N. europaea fur homologs (Figure 1)
were amplified by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega, Madison, WI) on an iCycler Thermal Cycler
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), as described by the manufacturers (see Table 1 for primers). The resulting DNA
fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega), sequenced to confirm that no mutations
have been introduced and named pFur616, pFur730 and
pFur1722 respectively. E. coli DH5a was used for plasmid amplification. For insertion of kanamycin resistance
cassette (Km r ) into plasmid pFur616, the EZ::TN
<KAN2> kit from Epicentre (Madison, WI) was used to
insert a transposon conferring Kmr into the promoter
region (pFur-kanP) and C-terminal region (pFur-kanC)
of fur following the directions of the manufacturer. The
insertion of the Kmr gene was localized by nucleotide
sequence determination at 117 nt upstream of the ATG
start codon of fur (pFur-kanP) and 312 nt downstream
of the ATG start codon of fur (pFur-kanC) in plasmid
pFur616. The pFur616-kanP plasmid construct with the
Kmr insertion was introduced back into the N. europaea
wild type cells by electroporation on the ElectroPorator
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 1300 V, with a capacitance
at 50 μF, and a load resistance at 500 Ω. Successful
transformants were selected in liquid medium using
kanamcyin sulfate (20 μg ml-1). Aliquots from these cultures were streaked onto Nylon disk membranes, which
were placed on semisolid plates, to isolate clonal mutant

Vajrala et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:37
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/37

strains, as described [25]. The mutant was verified by
Southern analysis (Figure 4B, and Results). Southern
blotting, labeling of DNA probes, hybridization and imaging were done as described previously [26]. Attempts
to generate fur null mutant by using pFur-kanC construct were unsuccessful.
Fur Titration Assays (FURTA)

Plasmids (listed in Table 1) were introduced into E. coli
H1717 and H1780 (fur inactivated) strains and lacZ
expression was assessed by visualization of a change in
colony color from white to red on MacConkey lactose
plates (Difco) supplemented with 30 μM ferrous ammonium sulfate. Plates were examined after 24 h of growth
at 37°C. The assays were performed in triplicate for
each sample.
Determination of Fe and heme c contents and O2-uptake
activities

Total Fe contents in thoroughly washed N. europaea cells
were determined by the ferrozine assay following HNO3
(5%) digestion of cells at 100°C [27]. Measurements of Fe
concentrations below 10 μM were made using a Teledyne
Leeman Prodigy ICP-OES (Hudson, NH) at the W.M.
Keck Collaboratory for Plasma Spectrometry, Oregon
State University. Preparations of a cell-soluble fraction,
and determination of heme contents following extraction
with pyridine, were done as described [14,28]. Whole cell
NH 3 -dependent and hydroxylamine dependent O 2
uptake activities were measured as described [14,29]. The
significance (P-values) for the physiological changes of
the strains due to the treatments (Table 2) was assessed
using Student’s t-test. The P-values below 0.01 were considered statistically significant.
Cell fractionation, protein quantification and SDS-PAGE
analyses

Total cell membranes were prepared as previously
described [14]. Briefly, cells were broken by ultrasonication, the sonicated material was centrifuged at 1500 g
for 1 min to pellet unlysed cells, and the top phase (cell
lysate) was transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes. Crude
total membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation of
the cell lysates, and washed thoroughly by homogenization in Tris buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.8) containing 1 M KCl.
Total membranes were collected again by ultracentrifugation, and resuspended in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.8).
Protein contents in whole cells and cell fractions were
estimated by using the Micro BCA Protein Assay kit
(Pierce), and BSA was used as a protein standard. The
peptide composition of cell membranes was analyzed
using SDS-PAGE [with 12% (w/v) acrylamide in the
resolving gels], as described [14,30].

Phylogenetic tree construction

ClustalW was used for sequence alignment applying
default parameters (altered gap penalties were not
applied) [31]. Gaps in the alignment were not omitted.
The phylogenetic tree was built by Phyml 3.0 with the
distance matrix generated by ClustalW and was represented with the program TreeDyn 198.3 available at
http://www.phylogeny.fr/[32]. The reliability of each
node was established by bootstrap methods.
Hidden Markov Model-based Fur binding site prediction

A group of experimentally validated Fur boxes from
E. coli, S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus used
by Quatrini et al., [33] along with 3 experimentally confirmed N. europaea Fur boxes were used to build HMM
profiles and to search for fur binding sites in the promoter
regions (600 nucleotides upstream of the proposed initiation of translation) of the potential target genes. Alignment of these promoters with the ClustalW multiplesequence alignment program yielded a putative Nitrosomonas Fur box consensus sequence that has 80% homology with the E. coli Fur box consensus binding sequence.
N. europaea sequence data was obtained from DOE
Joint Genome Institute (JGI) website http://genome.ornl.
gov/microbial/neur/. Sequence similarity searches of the
available nucleotide and protein databases were performed with the BLAST program, available at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information website
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/.
