Abstract
Background: Gene expression in Petunia inflata petals undergoes major changes following
compatible pollination. Severe flower wilting occurs reproducibly within 36 hours, providing an
excellent model for investigation of petal senescence and programmed cell death. Expression of a
number of genes and various enzyme activities involved in the degradation and remobilization of
macromolecules have been found to be upregulated during the early stages of petal senescence.
Results: By performing differential display of cDNAs during Petunia inflata petal senescence, a
highly upregulated gene encoding a cytochrome P450 was identified. Analysis of the complete
cDNA sequence revealed that the predicted protein is a member of the CYP74C family (CYP74C9)
and is highly similar to a tomato CYP74C allene oxide synthase (AOS) that is known to be active
on 9-hydroperoxides. Cloning of the petunia genomic DNA revealed an intronless gene with a
promoter region that carries signals found in stress-responsive genes and potential binding sites for
Myb transcription factors. Transcripts were present at detectable levels in root and stem, but were
40 times more abundant in flowers 36 hours after pollination. Ethylene and jasmonate treatment
resulted in transitory increases in expression in detached flowers. A protein fusion of the CYP74C
coding region to a C-terminal GFP was found to be located in the tonoplast.
Conclusion: Though oxylipins, particularly jasmonates, are known to be involved in stress
responses, the role of other products of CYP74 enzymes is less well understood. The identification
of a CYP74C family member as a highly upregulated gene during petal senescence suggests that
additional products of fatty acid metabolism may play important roles during programmed cell
death. In contrast to the chloroplast localization of AOS proteins in the CYP74A subfamily, GFP
fusion data indicates that the petunia CYP74C9 enzyme is in the tonoplast. This result suggests that
the highly similar CYP74C enzymes that have been identified in two other Solanaceous plants may
also be associated with the vacuole, an organelle known to have a prominent role in programmed
cell death.

Background
Plant cell death occurs during the hypersensitive response
[1,2], response to environmental stress [3], senescence
[4], and the development of plant tissues and organs
[3,5]. Among these phenomena, petal senescence is of
interest both because of its importance to the horticultural
industry as well as a model for programmed cell death
(PCD). Petal senescence shares a hallmark feature of PCD,
namely DNA fragmentation [6,7]. In contrast, an early
apoptotic event common in mammalian cells, the relocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial membrane
space into the cytosol, was not detected as a signal for wilting of petunia petal tissues [6]. Evidently some plant
death processes do not necessarily require cytochrome c
release as a signal. In Arabidopsis protoplasts, when death
was induced by C2 ceramide, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release were observed
early in the death process. However, when protoporphyrin IX was used as the induction signal, although a
decrease in membrane potential occurred, cytochrome c
release was not observed until after the Arabidopsis protoplasts had died [8]. In most other studies of various types
of plant PCD, cytochrome c release was observed during
PCD, for example, in stressed cultured cells [9,10], tapetal
cells [11], proteasome-inhibited epidermal cells [12], and
toxin-treated mesophyll cells [13].
Subtractive cloning and differential display have been
used to identify a number of genes that are highly induced
during senescence. Consistent with the profound effect of
ethylene on floral senescence in ethylene-sensitive flowers, petal wilting is preceded by the up-regulation of both
ACC synthase and ACC oxidase in both Petunia and carnation [14,15]. Most other genes up-regulated during petal
senescence that have been identified so far encode
enzymes involved in the degradation and remobilization
of macromolecules (reviewed in [5,16]), including a thiol
protease [17], acyl-CoA oxidase [18], glutathione-S-transferase [19], DNases and RNases [6,20,21], and lipoxygenases [22,23]. Other upregulated genes that have been
identified have unknown functions, such as a calmodulinbinding protein [24] and a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein [25].
In the self-incompatible species Petunia inflata, petal
senescence can be triggered reproducibly by compatible
pollination, with clear wilting symptoms appearing at 36
hours after compatible pollination (HACP) [6]. This pollination-induced petal senescence not only minimizes
environmental influences, but also provides an inducible
system to clone and investigate up-regulated genes associated with petal cell death. Using the technique of differential display during pollination-induced petal senescence,
an upregulated gene with similarity to the CYP74C subfamily of cytochrome P450s was identified. Sequence

analysis indicates the predicted protein (designated
CYP74C9 by the P450 nomenclature committee, identified here as PiCYP74C9) is most related to an unusual
tomato allene oxide synthase that preferentially metabolizes 9-hydroperoxides [26]. While some AOS proteins
have been localized to the chloroplast envelope, analysis
of transgenic plants carrying PiCyP74C9 fused to GFP
indicate that the P. inflata protein is located in the tonoplast.

Results
Isolation of Psr genes
Morphologically, programmed cell death (PCD) can be
divided into two distinct stages [27], condemned/latent
stage and execution stage. In the condemned stage, no
obvious morphological changes are visible and the duration is quite variable. At 24 hours after compatible selfpollination (HACP), the P. inflata flowers appear quite
normal but are condemned; at 36 hours the flowers are
quite wilted [6]. To identify genes that are up-regulated
during the condemned phase of petal senescence, differential display (DD) was used to compare mRNA expression profiles [28] from transcripts of young petals from
flowers that just opened with those of senescing petals
from flowers at 24 and 36 HACP. This comparison was to
identify those genes which may be involved in early
events (24 hours) during the condemned phase as well as
gene involved in late events of senescence equivalent to
the execution stage in apoptosis [6].

Fig. 1 shows examples of DD gels comparing mRNAs of
petal tissues collected at the indicated time after pollination. On the 24 HACP DD gel, most transcripts showed
similar levels of expression at 0 and 24 HACP (left panel).
In contrast, the steady-state level of most mRNAs at 36
HACP is reduced compared to 0 HACP (right panel). This
may be due to a decreased transcription rate or an
increased RNA degradation. Differential bands were
cloned into TA cloning vectors and used as probes to confirm increased expression at 36 hours on Northern blots.
Using a 1:1 ratio of mRNA from petals at 24 HACP and 36
HACP, a cDNA library specific to the petal and enriched
in senescence-related RNAs was constructed. The primary
library was screened for the coding regions of Psr genes.
Two independent clones contained a sequence similar to
ACC oxidase, an enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthesis. Two other independent clones carried a sequence similar to a member of the plant CYP74 family, cytochrome
P450s. These genes were termed petal senescence related
(psr) genes, Psr1 (ACC oxidase) and Psr2 (encoding
CYP74C9).

Several cDNA clones with partial coding regions were isolated for Psr2 by cDNA library screening. Two 3' end
sequences have been identified, implying the existence of
two polyadenylation sites, which are marked with arrows

Nucleotide sequence of Psr2 cDNA [Genbank:
DQ351288] with translation of coding region. The Ihelix (red), heme-binding (blue) region, and two potential
polyadenylation signals (green) are underlined. Processing
sites for polyadenylation are indicated by arrows. The
sequence of the longest cDNA obtained is shown; other
cDNAs exhibited polyadenylation at the first arrow. The
stop codon is marked with an asterisk. In addition, two nonsense codons upstream from the initiating ATG are indicated
by dots. The cDNA sequence obtained by DD is boldface.

527 (Fig. 2), which is probably due to the presence of an
AT rich sequence (AAATAAA). In order to obtain the 5'
sequence, a 5' RACE method [29] was used and extended
the 5' sequence by 72 nucleotides (Fig. 2, nucleotides 1 to
72). The longest ORF encoded by Psr2 is 480 amino acids,
which is preceded by two in-frame nonsense codons (Fig.
2).
The predicted protein product of Psr2 shows significant
sequence identity to the P450 enzymes in the CYP74 subfamily (Fig. 3). Members of this family have been shown
to function either as allene oxide synthase (AOS),
hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), or divinyl ether synthase
(DES) [30-32]. The predicted 480-amino-acid protein
exhibits 68% identity and 86% similarity to a well-characterized 491 amino-acid tomato protein that has been
shown to exhibit AOS activity on 9-hydroperoxides [26].
The predicted petunia protein contains a conserved PPGP
tetrapeptide near the amino terminus (residue 62 to 65,
Fig. 3) that is also common in P450s, a membrane hinge
that is known to be important for P450 stability and catalysis [33,34]. The unique feature of the CYP74 subfamily is
the oxygen-binding pocket, the I-helix. In contrast to the
consensus I-helix (GxxxT) in most P450s, the threonine
residue is substituted with either isoleucine, alanine, or
valine (GxxxI/A/V) (Fig. 4) in AOS, HPL, and DES
enzymes. The presence of GxxxV in PiCYP74C9 indicates
that the protein is a peroxide dehydrase rather than an
oxygenase, consistent with the known properties of this
cytochrome P450 subfamily. Three members of each
group within the CYP74C family and the CYP74D family
are compared in two conserved regions in Fig. 4. In the Ihelix region, the AOS group is more similar to the HPL
group than to the DES group. In the heme binding region,
the AOS group exhibits sequence similarities to both the
DES and HPL groups (Fig. 4).
Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 5) is consistent with the assignment of the Psr2 gene product as a CYP74C family member and with its likely activity as an allene oxide synthase
operating on 9-hydroperoxides. This maximum parsimony analysis organizes the proteins as expected in the
CYP74A, CYP74B, and CYP74D sub-families. The
CYP74C members assort into two groups, comprised of
those with HPL or AOS activities, with PiCYP74C9 clearly
located with the proteins with known AOS activity (Fig.
5). The tree generated by nearest neighbor analysis is quite
similar, also separating the AOS and HPL CYP74C members.
Developmental and tissue-specific expression of Psr2
Analysis of the time course of Psr2 expression shows that
Psr2 mRNA is not detectable on RNA blots immediately
after opening but is strongly up-regulated at 24 HACP
(Fig. 6). The peak expression of Psr2 was at 36 HACP and

senescing stamens and pistils at 36 HACP and senescing
petals of unpollinated flowers 6 days after opening (Fig.

7), suggesting that Psr2 may be useful as a molecular
marker of floral senescence.

Among the different tissues tested, Psr2 was expressed at
low levels constitutively in the root and stem and at much
lower levels in other young tissues, including healthy
leaves and tissues from unopened flowers (Fig. 7). A densitometry measurement shows that the induced level of
Psr2 mRNA in the pollinated petals at 36 HACP is about
40-fold higher than the constitutive level in either root or
stem (Fig. 7). Since treatments with ethylene and jasmonates have been shown to accelerate petal senescence
in P. hybrida [35,36], ethephon or MEJA was applied to
detached flowers of P. inflata. Ethephon is a commonly
used substitute for ethylene and easily converted into ethylene within plant cells [37]. In the presence of 1 mM
ethephon, P. inflata flowers wilted within 24 hours (data
not shown), whereas with simple distilled water treatment, detached flowers could last more than 6 days (data
not shown). MEJA treatment seemed to promote a change
in petal color rather than physical wilting (data not
shown). Both ethephon treatment and MEJA treatment
(Fig. 7) caused a transient increase in Psr2 transcripts in
detached flowers.

Characterization of Psr2 gene organization and promoter
elements
A DNA blot probed with a Psr2 cDNA under stringent
washing conditions showed that Psr2 is a single copy gene
(Fig. 8), as is the highly similar tomato gene encoding
LeAOS3 [26]. However, additional faint bands appeared
after long exposure, suggesting the presence of similar
sequences in Petunia (data not shown). By screening a P.
inflata genomic library [38], the promoter region and the
genomic copy of Psr2 were isolated. In the genomic clone
with the longest 5' sequence, the upstream regulatory
region is 2335 bp (Fig. 9). A CCAAT box is located at -230
to -226 and a TATA box is at -33 to -22. Other cis-elements
include a GCC box which may be ethylene responsive
[39,40], three TCA motifs (common in stress-inducible
genes [41]), and several potential binding sites for Myb
transcription factors including maize P and Petunia petal
epidermis-specific Myb.Ph3 [42,43]. The putative transcription start site (+1) is in agreement with both the plant
consensus start sequence [44] and the sequence obtained
from the 5' RACE (Fig. 9). The P. inflata Psr2 gene does not
have introns. In the transcribed region, there is only one
nucleotide difference between the Psr2 genomic clone and
the cDNA clone we sequenced. At position 3153 there is a
T in the genomic sequence and a C in the cDNA sequence;
because it is in the third position of the codon, the predicted amino acid sequence is not affected.
Cellular localization of PiCYP74C9
PiCYP74C9 lacks any defined targeting signal; analysis by
a variety of web-based localization informatics programs
gave inconclusive and contradictory results. To investigate
the location of PiCYP74C9, the full coding region was
fused in-frame to an enhanced GFP [45] and a strong promoter [46] and introduced into Nicotiana tabacum by
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

A number of transgenic tobacco plants were identified
that express the fusion protein at relatively high levels,
according to immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP antibody (data not shown). All transgenic plants exhibited
normal morphology and fertility. Microscopic analysis of
transformed cells indicated that the signal was found in
the tonoplast membrane (Fig. 10), as images were comparable to those obtained with a known tonoplast
aquaporin/GFP fusion [47]. Images of isolated vacuoles
verified the localization as in the tonoplast membrane
(Fig. 10).
Because the GFP fluorescence signal was relatively weak,
despite readily detectable GFP by immunoblot analysis of
total leaf extracts, we considered the possibility that nonfluorescent GFP might be located in additional subcellular organelles, especially since certain AOS enzymes are
known to be located in plastids [48-50]. We fractionated

Discussion
The identification of macromolecules that increase in
abundance during petal senescence is critical for our
understanding of this process. Although a number of
genes have been cloned that are highly expressed in
senescing petals, the signal transduction pathways remain
poorly understood. In addition to PiCYP74C9, a second
highly induced known gene that we also identified during
our study encodes ACC oxidase, which is involved in ethylene biosynthesis. The identification of ACC oxidase is
not surprising, given that ethylene is known to be important in signaling petunia floral senescence [52,53]. The
ethylene peak in P. inflata petal tissue starts from 18 HACP
and peaks at 24 HACP [54]. This ethylene surge lags
behind the up-regulation of ACC oxidase mRNA (Psr1)
which shows up-regulation starting after 12 HACP (Fig.
6). This timing supports the theory that de novo synthesis
of ethylene is required for the increased ethylene level.
Our previous study [6] showed that the total amount of
RNA decreased about 50% at 24 HACP. Up to 36 HACP,
the steady-state levels of the Psr1 and Psr2 transcripts continue to increase despite collapse of the floral shape and
decrease in total RNA and protein contents, suggesting
that Psr1 and Psr2 transcripts are either continuously transcribed or protected from the large-scale degradation of
RNA in the senescing petal. This indicates active regulation of petal senescence by the plant.

cells to determine the subcellular location of the GFP
fusion by immunoblot analysis. We prepared chloroplast,
mitochondria, peroxisome, and tonoplast fractions and
probed with an anti-GFP antibody and appropriate controls for our fractionation (Fig. 11). GFP signal was
detected only in the tonoplast membrane (Fig. 11). The
PiCYP74C9::GFP fusion exhibits a higher mobility when
denatured at 50°C vs.100°C (Fig. 11). Proteins were
treated at the lower temperature treatment (shown in Fig.
11B) because the control tonoplast marker, vacuolar pyrophosphatase, is unstable at high temperature [51].

Both ethylene and MEJA induced expression of Psr2 in
unpollinated petals. Jasmonates also evidently play a role
in the regulation of the gene encoding LeAOS3, the
CYP74C member most closely related to PiCYP74C9, as
expression of LeAOS3 in roots did not occur in a tomato
mutant insensitive to jasmonates [26]. LeAOS3 transcripts
were found in germinating seedlings and roots but not
cotyledons, mature leaves, stems, nor flower buds; evidently senescing tissue was not tested [26]. Our data suggests that it will be worthwhile to examine the expression
of the genes encoding LeAOS3 and the similar StAOS3
protein in stressed tissues to find out whether all of these
synthases are upregulated during programmed cell death.
Likewise, it will be interesting to determine whether or
not LeAOS3 and StAOS3 are targeted to the tonoplast.
P450 enzymes constitute a superfamily of enzymes that
are important in the oxidative, peroxidative, and reductive
metabolism of numerous endogenous compounds
(reviewed in [54-56]). The CYP74 family does not require
molecular oxygen, instead the oxygen is provided by the
hydroperoxide substrates. There are a number of products
and derivatives of the CYP74 enzymatic reactions, and
some of these have well-known signaling properties while
others are of unknown biological activity (Fig. 12). At
present the family is divided into four sub-groups, but as

more becomes known about these unusual P450s, perhaps five sub-groups will be warranted. The HPL and AOS
activities on 13-hydroperoxides have been characterized
in more species than the 9-hydroperoxides-preferring
enzymes and clearly fall into two sub-families (Fig 5).
Neither CYP74C nor CYP74D enzymes have been found
in the Arabidopsis genome; indeed, at present, the AOS
CYP74C enzymes are known only in Solanaceae (Fig. 5),
while the HPL CYP74C enzymes have not yet been
described in this family. As well as enzyme activity, future
analysis may reveal whether intracellular localization also
differs between sub-families and between the HPL vs. AOS
CYP74C proteins.
Lipoxygenases, which act upon lipids to produce the
hydroperoxide substrates utilized by CYP74 cytochrome
P450s (Fig. 12), have been found in a variety of locations
within the plant cell, including the vacuole [57,58]. Some
CYP74 proteins have an N-terminal chloroplast transit
peptide and are associated with the chloroplast. In flax,
tomato, and barley, the transit sequence has been shown
to be functional as targeting signal for certain AOS proteins to chloroplasts [48-50]. A tomato AOS was targeted
to the outer chloroplast envelope membrane, while an
HPL was targeted to the inner membrane [48]. However,
other CYP74 members exist with no predictable location
and await experimental determination. For example, only
one of four predicted AOS genes in rice carries a putative
chloroplast transit sequence [59]. Not all CYP74A members are found in the chloroplast; the guayule CYP74C
AOS (PaAOS) is associated with rubber particles [60].

Our results indicate that PiCYP74C9::GFP expressed in
tobacco leaves is localized in tonoplasts but not in chloroplasts, mitochondria, nor peroxisomes. We presume that
PiCYP74C9 is also located in the tonoplast in petunia during petal senescence. To our knowledge, this is the first
example of a CYP74 subfamily member to be localized in
the tonoplast. Both N-terminal [61] and C-terminal [47]
GFP fusions with known tonoplast proteins have resulted
in GFP labeling of the tonoplast. None of the computer
programs we tested (Predotar, TargetP, Psort) predicted
PiCYP74C9 to be located in either plastids, mitochondria,
or the secretory pathway.
The tonoplast localization of PiCYP74C9 is intriguing
given recent information about the important role of the
vacuole in programmed cell death. While it has been
known for some time that caspase activity is involved in
both developmental and hypersensitive response cell
death, only recently has the vacuolar processing enzyme
been shown to exhibit caspase activity that is important
for the execution phase of several types of PCD [62-64].
During senescence, cell contents can be recycled by digestion in vacuoles in the process of autophagy [65]. In some
types of developmental programmed cell death, including
petal senescence, the final stages coincide with ultrastructural changes and permeabilization of the tonoplast and
other membranes (reviewed in [5,16,66]). Confirmation
of the allene oxide synthase activity of PiCYP74C9 on 9hydroperoxides and identification of the products may
give insights into the role of this protein in petal senescence. Future analyses of the PiCYP74C9 protein should
also reveal the significance of its compartmentation in the
tonoplast.

transgenic tobacco plant expressing the PiCYP74C9::GFP fusion protein were fractionated into total leaf extract, chloroplasts,
mitochondria, peroxisomes, and tonoplast. Proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibodies against GFP, the large subunit of Rubisco (Rubisco-LS), coupling factor 1 of
chloroplastic ATPase (Cp-ATPase CF1), mitochondrial ATPase alpha subunit (Mt-ATPase alpha), catalase, vacuolar membrane
proton-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (V-PPase), and binding protein (BiP). Protein amounts loaded were 5 μg in A
or 2.5 μg in B for total leaf extracts, 3 μg for chloroplasts, 0.3 μg for mitochondria and peroxisomes, and 0.15 μg for tonoplast.
Sample denaturation with SDS was done at 100°C for 3 min in A and at 50°C for 20 min in B.

Conclusion
By the technique of differential display, we have identified
a cytochrome P450 that is expressed at a level 40 times
greater in senescing petals than in vegetative tissue. Upregulation occurs in response to compatible pollination, ethylene treatment, or jasmonate treatment. The petunia
gene encodes a protein highly similar to a tomato
CYP74C protein known to exhibit allene oxide synthase
activity, preferentially on 9-hydroperoxides. Both a complete cDNA and genomic sequence of this single-copy
gene have been obtained The promoter region of the petunia gene exhibits several motifs found in stress-responsive
genes as well as binding sites for a petunia transcription
factor. A C-terminal GFP fusion protein was located in the
tonoplast, a compartment where CYP74 members have
not previously been detected. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the CYP74C subfamily may warrant future divi-

sion into two groups, as more information becomes
available about AOS and HPL enzymes acting on 9hydroperoxides.

Methods
Plant materials, growth, and pollination
Two different P. inflata populations bearing different S
alleles can be used to pollinate each other. A line termed
P. inflata-1 was derived from seed originally received from
Ken Sink (Michigan State). The other population, termed
P-S-14, was provided by D. Maizonnier (Dijon, France),
who obtained it from a South American source. Plants
were grown at 23°C under 16 hr daylight and 8 hr darkness. The compatibility of P-S-14 pollen on P. inflata-1
was confirmed by seed production, while self-pollination
of P. inflata-1 flowers did not result in seed set. Pollen
from P-S-14 was used to pollinate P. inflata-1 on the day

of flower opening. At pollination, the five stamens were
removed from P. inflata-1 flowers to reveal the stigma and
to avoid incompatible pollination.
Transgenic tobacco cv. Petit Havana plants containing the
PiCYP74C9::GFP fusion that were used for cellular fractionation were grown in a growth room at 23°C under 16
hr light and 8 hr darkness for about one month before
organelle isolation. For fluorescence microscopy observations, transgenic tobacco plants containing the
PiCYP74C9::GFP fusion were grown in a greenhouse
under natural illumination. Both GFP genes were under
the control of the 35S promoter with AMV translation
enhancer [46] in the PGTPV-Kan vector [67]. Transgenic
tobacco plants were produced as described by Kwok and
Hanson [68].
Chemical treatments of detached flowers
Flowers were cut at the pedicel the day of opening. Twelve
flowers were used in each treatment with pedicel placed in
the chemical solution held in a 24-well tissue culture plate
(Northeast Container Corporation, Dover, NH). The plate

was left in the greenhouse with 16 hr light and 8 hr darkness. The stock solution for ethephon (Sigma Chemical,
St. Louis, MO) was 1 mM in ddH2O. The stock solution
for MEJA (Bedoukian Research Inc., Danbury, CT) was
100 mM in 95% ethanol. Stock solutions were kept at 80°C. The working solution was diluted from the stock
solution in ddH2O before use.
RNA isolation and RNA blot analysis
Total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL reagent according
to the manufacturer's instruction (GIBCO BRL). RNA
amounts were determined by OD260. RNA electrophoresis
(10 μg total RNA per lane) was carried out in formaldehyde denaturing gels as described (Sambrook et al. 1989),
but the concentration of formaldehyde in the gel and running buffer was reduced to 0.7 M. RNA was transferred to
Genescreen membrane (NEN Research Products, Boston,
MA) in 20xSSC and hybridized at 65°C overnight in
Church buffer (250 mM NaPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1%
BSA, 1 mM EDTA). Probe labeling was done with the random priming labeling kit DECAprimeII (Ambion, Austin,

TX). After overnight hybridization, filters were washed
twice with 0.2xSSC/0.1%SDS at 65°C.
Differential display
Total RNA was extracted from 10 petals at 0, 24, and 36
HACP using TRIZOL reagent with the following modification from standard protocol. Before isopropanol precipitation, two rounds of ether extraction were added. After
isopropanol precipitation, RNA was dissolved in ddH2O
and precipitated in the presence of 2 mM LiCl at 4°C overnight. RNA concentration was determined by A260. For differential display, 1.5 μg total RNA from 0 HACP was
compared with that of 24 or 36 HACP following the
instructions for differential display provided by GenHunter (Brookline, MA). Reagents used in reverse transcription were from GIBCO BRL and the PCR buffer was
from GenHunter. The primers for differential display were
a generous gift from Dr. Mikhail Nasrallah.
DNA isolation and blot analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated according to a modified CTAB
method [69]. For DNA blot analysis, equal amounts of
genomic DNA were digested with restriction enzymes,
separated on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond
N+ (Amersham Pharmacia). The hybridization was done
as described for RNA blot analysis.
cDNA library construction and screening
Total RNA isolation was performed following a phenol/
SDS method [70] with modifications. Five grams of petals
from 24 HACP or 36 HACP were ground in liquid N2 and
further ground after adding 40 ml NES buffer (100 mM
NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) and 20 ml sodium acetatebuffered phenol (pH 4.0). The mixture was then homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments Inc.,
Westbury, NY) for 2 min. Messenger RNA was purified
through an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (type 7) following
the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia).
Handling of the cDNA library, including construction,
titering, screening, and in vivo excision, followed the manufacturer's instructions. The ZAP Express cDNA synthesis
kit and ZAP Express cDNA Gigapack III gold cloning kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used for the cDNA library
construction. Starting with 5 μg mRNA from senescing
petals (2.5 μg from 24 HACP and 2.5 μg from 36 HACP),
a primary cDNA library with about 540,000 recombinant
phage was obtained. About 25,000 primary phage were
screened to clone the gene.
Cellular fractionation
Tobacco leaves were homogenized in Hepes-NaOH (pH
7.5) containing 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and protease
inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini, Roche) in a chilled
mortar and pestle. The homogenate was mixed with an
equal volume of SDS sample buffer consisting of 200 mM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/8

Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.7 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol and then it was boiled for 3
min or heated at 50°C for 20 min when used in comparison with tonoplast vesicles. Following microcentrifugation, the supernatant was taken for use as the whole leaf
extract.
For the isolation of organelles, leaves were cut into small
slices (approximately 1 mm× 10 mm) with a razor blade
and homogenized in a Polytron for 2 sec five to seven
times with 5 ml of a homogenizing buffer per gram fresh
weight of leaves.
Chloroplasts were isolated from 30 g of leaves essential as
described previously [71] except that the extraction and
Percoll gradient buffer contained 2 mM EDTA instead of
10 mM EDTA. Intact chloroplasts were collected from a
green layer near the bottom of Percoll gradients, suspended in 50 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 0.3
M mannitol and 2 mM EDTA, and centrifuged at 3,000 g
for 40 s. The resulting pellet was used as the purified chloroplast fraction.
Mitochondria were isolated from 60 g of leaves using Percoll gradient centrifugation with 0–5% (w/v) PVP-40 preformed gradient based on the method described by Day et
al[72] with slight modifications as follows. Leaves were
homogenized with a grinding buffer consisting of 25 mM
Mops-KOH (pH 7.8) containing 0.4 M mannitol, 10 mM
Tricine, 8 mM cysteine, 1 mM EGTA, 1% (w/v) PVP-40,
and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. The homogenate was passed
through eight layers cheesecloth and centrifuged at 1,000
g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged again at
12,000 g for 15 min. The pellet was washed with 25 mM
Mops-KOH (pH 7.2) containing 0.4 M mannitol and 1
mM EGTA and was suspended in the same buffer and layered on top of a solution of 28% (v/v) Percoll in 25 mM
Mops-KOH (pH 7.2) containing 0.4 M mannitol and
0.1% (w/v) BSA with 0–5% (w/v) PVP-40 preformed gradient. After centrifugation at 40,000 g for 45 min, white
band near the bottom of the tube was collected, suspended in 25 mM Mops-KOH (pH 7.2) containing 0.4 M
mannitol and 1 mM EGTA, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for
15 min. The resulting pellet was used as the purified mitochondrial fraction.
Peroxisomes were isolated from 30 g of leaves based on
the method described by Fukao et al. [73] as follows.
Leaves were homogenized with a grinding buffer consisting of 20 mM pyrophosphate-HCl (pH 7.5) containing
0.3 M mannitol and 1 mM EDTA. The homogenate was
passed through four layers of cheesecloth. The residue was
homogenized with another grinding buffer again in a similar manner. The filtrates were combined and were centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min. The supernatant was

centrifuged again at 10,000 g for 20 min. The pellet was
washed with a grinding buffer, and was suspended in 4 ml
of 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2) containing 0.3 M mannitol and 1 mM EDTA and was subjected to centrifugation
in Percoll. The suspension was layered on top of 5 ml of a
60% (v/v) and 30 ml of a 28% (v/v) solution of Percoll in
10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2) containing 1 mM EDTA and
0.3 M raffinose and was centrifuged at 40,000 g for 30 min
without deceleration. After centrifugation, 1 ml fractions
were collected by a fraction collector. The 6th fraction
from the bottom, which had the highest catalase content
judging from immunoblot analysis, was used as the purified peroxisome fraction.
Vacuoles were isolated from leaf protoplasts as follows.
Leaves (15 g) were cut into small slices as described above
and digested with an incubation medium conainting
1.5% Cellulase Onozuka RS, 0.4% Macerozyme R-10, 10
mM Mes-NaOH (pH 5.6), 8 mM CaCl2 and 0.7 M mannitol for 3 h at 30°C in darkness. After digestion, released
protoplasts were passed through a 150-μm nylon mesh
and washed with 0.7 M mannitol for three times. Protoplasts were treated with DEAE-dextran solution for the
lysis and released vacuoles were separated by the discontinuous Ficoll gradient centrifugation as previously
described by Asami et al. [74].
Tonoplast vesicles were isolated from 20 g of leaves based
on the method described by Maeshima and Yoshida [75]
as follows. Leaves were homogenized with a grinding
buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5) containing 0.25 M sorbitol, 2 mM EGTA, 1% (v/v) PVP-40, 2 mM
DTT and 0.5 mM PMSF. The homogenate was passed
through four layers of cheesecloth. The filtrates were centrifuged at 3,600 g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 120,000 g for 30 min. The pellet was
suspended in 15 ml of 20 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 M sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT and 2 mM
MgCl2 and poured into a centrifugation tube. The suspension was overlayed with 15 ml of 20 mM Tris-acetate (pH
7.5) containing 0.25 M sorbitol, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT
and 2 mM MgCl2. After centrifugation at 120,000 g for 30
min in a Beckman 70 Ti rotor, the interference portion
was collected and diluted in a three-times volume of 20
mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5) containing 0.25 M sorbitol, 1
mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT and 2 mM MgCl2. The suspension
was then centrifuged at 120,000 g for 30 min and the
resulting pellet was used as the tonoplast preparation.
Immunoblot analysis
Purified organelles, except tonoplast vesicles, were mixed
with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer as above and
then boiled for 3 min. Tonoplast vesicles were denatured
at 50°C for 20 min. Protein concentration was determined by RC DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) based on Lowry

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/8

method [76] according to the manufacturer's instruction.
BSA was used as standard. Protein amounts loaded on
12.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels were 5 μg for whole leaf
extract, 3 μg for chloroplasts, 0.3 μg for mitochondria and
peroxisomes, and 0.15 μg for tonoplasts. Immunoblot
analysis was performed by the method of Towbin et al.
[77].
Antibodies used were rabbit anti-GFP antibodies
(1:5,000, Molecular Probes), affinity-purified anti-large
subunit of Rubisco antibodies (1:20,000; [78]) from rabbit anti-rice whole Rubisco antibodies [79] and rabbit
anti-rice coupling factor 1 of chloroplastic ATPase antibodies (1:5,000; [80]), both gifts of Dr. Amane Makino; a
mouse anti-maize mitochondrial ATPase alpha subunit
antibody (1:200; [81]); a mouse anti-tobacco catalase
monoclonal antibody purchased from Princeton University Molecular Biology Department Monoclonal Antibody
Facility (1:500; [82]); anti-peptide antibody for vacuolar
pyrophosphatase corresponding to the sequences
HKAAVIGDTIGDPLK (putative loop XII, 1:50,000), a gift
of Dr. Philip Rea [51]; and anti-binding protein, a gift of
Dr. Eliot Herman (1:50,000, [83]).
Microscopy
Laser-scanning confocal and differential interference contrast microscopy was performed with a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal scanning head mounted on a Leica DMRE-7 (SDK)
upright microscope equipped with a 100×HCX PL APO
oil immersion objective (NA = 1.40; Leica Microsysytems
Inc., Bannockburn, IL, USA). GFP was excited with the
488 nm line of a 4-line Argon ion laser and emission of
GFP was detected between 500 and 581 nm.

Authors' contributions
YX cloned Psr cDNAs and Psr2 genomic DNA, performed
expression analyses, and regenerated transgenic plants
carrying the PiCYP74C9::GFP fusion. HI fractionated cells
of transgenic plants and carried out immunoblot analysis.
DR made the microscopic observations. Both YX and
MRH performed bioinformatic analyses and wrote the
manuscript. MRH coordinated the project and edited the
final manuscript, which was approved by all authors.
