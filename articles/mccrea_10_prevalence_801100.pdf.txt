Prevalence of genetic differences in
phosphorylcholine expression between
nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and
Haemophilus haemolyticus
Kirk W McCrea1*, Jingping Xie2,3, Carl F Marrs2, Janet R Gilsdorf1

Abstract
Background: Although non-typeable (NT) Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus are closely related
human commensals, H. haemolyticus is non-pathogenic while NT H. influenzae is an important cause of respiratory
tract infections. Phase-variable phosphorylcholine (ChoP) modification of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a NT
H. influenzae virulence factor that, paradoxically, may also promote complement activation by binding C-reactive
protein (CRP). CRP is known to bind more to ChoP positioned distally than proximally in LOS, and the position of
ChoP within LOS is dictated by specific licD alleles (designated here as licDI, licDIII, and licDIV) that are present in a
lic1 locus. The lic1 locus contains the licA-licD genes, and ChoP-host interactions may also be influenced by a
second lic1 locus that allows for dual ChoP substitutions in the same strain, or by the number of licA gene
tetranucleotide repeats (5’-CAAT-3’) that reflect phase-variation mutation rates.
Results: Using dot-blot hybridization, 92% of 88 NT H. influenzae and 42.6% of 109 H. haemolyticus strains
possessed a lic1 locus. Eight percent of NT H. influenzae and none of the H. haemolyticus strains possessed dual
copies of lic1. The licDIII and licDIV gene alleles were distributed similarly (18-22%) among the NT H. influenzae and
H. haemolyticus strains while licDI alleles were present in 45.5% of NT H. influenzae but in less than 1% of
H. haemolyticus strains (P < .0001). NT H. influenzae had an average of 26.8 tetranucleotide repeats in licA compared
to14.8 repeats in H. haemolyticus (P < .05). In addition, NT H. influenzae strains that possessed a licDIII allele had
increased numbers of repeats compared to NT H. influenzae with other licD alleles (P < .05).
Conclusions: These data demonstrate that genetic similarities and differences of ChoP expression exist between
NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus and strengthen the hypothesis that, at the population level, these differences
may, in part, provide an advantage in the virulence of NT H. influenzae.

Background
Strains of non-typeable (NT) Haemophilus influenzae
asymptomatically colonize the human pharynx, but are
also opportunistic pathogens that cause localized
respiratory tract infections such as otitis media, pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, and COPD exacerbation
[1,2]. Bacterial factors that differentiate disease from
commensal strains are largely unknown since the population structure of NT H. influenzae is genetically

heterologous [3]. The association of bacterial factors
with disease-causing strains can be inferred, however, by
comparing the prevalence of genetic traits between epidemiologically defined collections of disease and commensal strains [4-7] or, alternatively, between the
pathogenic species and a phylogenetically close but nonpathogenic relative [8-11].
Haemophilus haemolyticus is a phylogenetically close
relative of NT H. influenzae, but has not been associated
with disease [7,12,13]. The two species reside in the
same host niche, overlap extensively by both taxonomic
and phylogenetic analyses [10,14,15], and exchange
DNA through natural transformation [10,13,16]. Given

their close relationship, but difference in disease potential, NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus likely possess
common genes or genetic traits for commensal growth
but differ in genes or traits that facilitate disease [10].
Historically, H. haemolyticus has been considered a
rarely encountered commensal that was easily differentiated from NT H. influenzae by its hemolytic phenotype
[17-19]. Recent studies, however, have shown that
20-40% of isolates in various NT H. influenzae collections were miss-classified, and found to be non-hemolytic H. haemolyticus [7,13]. These observations suggest
that H. haemolyticus is significantly more prevalent in
the pharynges than previously thought, and that clinical
differentiation of the species from throat and sputum
samples is inadequate [13]. Therefore, we recently
sought to differentiate the species by their relative proportions of selected NT H. influenzae virulence genes
and observed that a probe made to licA, a NT H. influenzae gene necessary for phosphorylcholine (ChoP)
modification of LOS, hybridized to 96% of NT H. influenzae isolates and to 42% of H. haemolyticus isolates
[10]. The relationship of ChoP expression between NT
H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus is unknown but differences between the species may highlight important
roles in NT H. influenzae virulence.
In studies addressing NT H. influenzae virulence,
ChoP-modified LOS has been shown to promote bacterial adherence and invasion of host cells through interaction with the platelet activating factor receptor, to
increase bacterial resistance to host antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin (or LL-37/hCAP18), and to
modulate the host inflammatory response directed
toward bacteria present in biofilms [20-22]. Paradoxical
to its role in enhancing colonization and virulence,
ChoP can bind C-reactive protein (CRP) which initiates
C1q binding that leads to activation of the classical
complement pathway and bactericidal killing [23]. The
concentration of CRP (in both serum and respiratory
tract secretions) dramatically increases during inflammation, and has been proposed to facilitate clearance of
ChoP-expressing bacteria in the respiratory tract [24,25].
Human ChoP-specific antibodies capable of eliciting in
vitro bactericidal activity against some H. influenzae
strains have also been identified, suggesting a further liability of H. influenzae ChoP expression [26]. H. influenzae may avoid CRP and anti-ChoP antibody binding,
however, by phase varying ChoP expression and by
strain-dependent localization of ChoP substitutions
within LOS [27,28].
In H. influenzae, ChoP expression is controlled by a
contingency locus, lic1, that contains the licA, licB, licC,
and licD genes (encoding a choline kinase, a choline
permease, a pyrophosphorylase, and a diphosphonucleoside choline transferase, respectively) [29]. Contingency

Page 2 of 12

loci, such as lic1, contain simple sequence repeats (SSR)
that provide an organism with the ability to phase vary
specific phenotypes in response to host challenges [27].
In lic1, the SSR are tetranucleotide (5’-CAAT-3’) and
are present at the 5’ end of licA, the first gene in the
locus [29]. During replication, intragenic SSR repeats
undergo slipped-strand mispairing which results in
translational phase variation, and the rate of these mutations is proportional to the length of the repeat region
[30]. De Bolle et al [31] found that mutation rates of a
H. influenzae type III restriction modification gene
(mod) engineered to contain 17-38 tetranucleotide
(AGTC) intragenic repeats increased linearly with the
number of repeats. In contrast, the same gene containing 5-11 repeats demonstrated rare, if any, phase-variation. Thus, higher numbers of repeats in a contingency
locus may protect the bacteria by decreasing the
response time to host challenges [27]. Among H. influenzae strains, however, the number of licA gene
5’-CAAT-3’ repeats range from 3-56, and patterns pertaining to virulence have not been identified [32,33].
Depending on the H. influenzae strain, ChoP may be
substituted at different positions within LOS. Substitutions may occur on oligosaccharides that extend from
any one of the three conserved inner-core heptose residues (heptose I, II, and III) or, alternatively, directly to
heptose IV, an outer core heptose that extends from
heptose I [34,35]. These substitutions are dictated largely by the diphosphonucleoside choline transferase
encoded by the licD gene. Three licD gene alleles mediate ChoP substitutions at different positions within
LOS and, for simplification, we have named the alleles
to reflect their association with a given heptose-residue:
licDI, licDIII, and licDIV. Although ChoP has been associated with heptose II residues in selected strains, a specific licD allele mediating these substitutions has not
been experimentally documented [35]. The deduced
LicD proteins are 265-268 amino acids in length and
range in sequence identity from 74-88% with much of
the variation occurring in the central part of the primary
structure [28,35]. Although most NT H. influenzae
strains possess a single licD allelic gene that facilitates
one ChoP substitution, Fox et al [35] recently reported
that 4/25 (16%) of NT H. influenzae middle ear strains
possessed two different licD alleles, each present in a
separate, phase-variable lic1 locus, that together could
produce up to two ChoP substitutions in the strain’s
LOS.
Both the number and position of ChoP substitutions
within LOS may affect binding of host clearance molecules such as CRP or natural ChoP antibodies [26,28].
For instance, H. influenzae strains with dual ChoP substitutions bind more CRP, and H. influenzae strains with
ChoP substitutions positioned from the distal heptose

McCrea et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:286
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/286

III residue are 10-fold more sensitive to CRP-initiated
bactericidal killing than ChoP associated with the proximal heptose I in the same strains [28,35]. Consequently,
strains with proximal ChoP substitutions (i.e. heptose I)
may be more protected from CRP-mediated clearance,
and LOS structural studies on selected NT H. influenzae
strains have found that ChoP predominate at this position [34]. The overall prevalence of these substitutions
in the NT H. influenzae population, however, is not
known. Differences in the prevalence of single or combined licD gene alleles between NT H. influenzae and
H. haemolyticus may reflect the importance of ChoP
structures in NT H. influenzae virulence.
The presence of a licA gene in H. haemolyticus suggests that it may contain a lic1 locus and express ChoP
in a manner similar to H. influenzae [10]. Since ChoP
expression among NT H. influenzae strains can vary
greatly due to genetic factors listed above, we speculated
that differences in the prevalence of these factors
between strain populations of H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus may highlight, in part, which ones provide an
advantage to H. influenzae in transcending from commensal to disease-related growth.

to H. influenzae, some strains of H. haemolyticus can
express a ChoP epitope that is localized within its LOS.

ChoP expression in H. haemolyticus

Although H. influenzae is known to modify its LOS with
ChoP, expression and surface localization of ChoP in H.
haemolyticus has not been demonstrated. To investigate
ChoP expression in H. haemolyticus, we obtained LOS
profiles on silver-stained tricine SDS-PAGE from wholecell lysates on three H. influenzae control strains, six H.
haemolyticus strains containing a licA gene, and five
H. haemolyticus strains lacking a licA gene [10]. As seen
in Figure 1 (upper panel), both NT H. influenzae and H.
haemolyticus demonstrated intra-and inter-strain variability in LOS migration. A duplicate gel was transferred
to a Western immunoblot and ChoP was detected with
TEPC-15, a mAb that recognizes ChoP on a number of
pathogenic bacteria [36-38]. TEPC-15 reacted with LOSassociated bands in all H. influenzae control strains and
in the six H. haemolyticus strains that contained a licA
gene (Figure 1 lower panel). The antibody, however, did
not react to five H. haemolyticus strains lacking a licA
gene (Figure 1 lower panel).
The association of ChoP epitopes with H. haemolyticus LOS was further supported by proteinase K digestion experiments. TEPC-15 reactivity was still present
on Western immunoblots containing H. influenzae
strain Rd and H. haemolyticus strain M07-22 that were
pre-treated with proteinase K, although no proteins
were visible in these preparations when they were run
on glycine SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie (data
not shown). Together these results suggest that, similar

H. haemolyticus contains a lic1 locus similar to
H. influenzae

The ability of H. haemolyticus to hybridize with a
H. influenzae licA gene probe suggests that H. haemolyticus contains a lic1 locus [10]. In H. haemolyticus
strains M07-22 and 60P3H1, licA-licD gene probes were
each found to hybridize with one restriction fragment
on Southern blots, suggesting that all genes were confined to a single locus in each strain (data not shown).
PCR designed to amplify overlapping regions of H. influenzae lic1 locus genes also amplified similar products in
H. haemolyticus strains M07-22 and 60P3H1, and DNA
sequencing of these products revealed that the strains
contained tandem licA-licD genes spanning 3375 and
3324 bp [GenBank: HM140372 and HM140373], respectively, similar in size to the lic1 loci present in the genome-sequenced H. influenzae strains Rd (3358 bp) and
86-028NP (3333 bp) [39,40]. Further comparisons of the
lic1 loci between H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae [29]
revealed that, in both species, the loci were flanked by
the same chromosomal genes, contained licA a, b, and g
start codons positioned immediately upstream of tandemly arranged tetranucleotide (5’-CAAT-3’) repeats,
and contained licB and licC start codons that overlapped
each preceding gene (data not shown).
The LicA, LicB, and LicC amino-acid sequences for
the two H. haemolyticus strains M07-22 and 60P3H1
were deduced and found to be 93, 99, and 95% identical,

respectively, between the strains (Table 1). Amino-acid
sequences comparisons of the putative LicA, LicB, and
LicC proteins between H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae (strains E1a, Rd, and 86-028NP) revealed identities
that were somewhat lower, ranging from 87-94% for all
comparisons (Table 1). As mentioned above, three
LicD protein alleles (LicDI , LicD III , and LicD IV ) have
been described for H. influenzae. The LicD protein of
H. haemolyticus strain M07-22 was 89 and 87% identical to the LicDI allele of H. influenzae strains Rd and
86-028NP, respectively, but was 95% identical with and
contained a 3 amino-acid insertion similar to the
LicD III allele of H. influenzae strain E1a, suggesting
that this H. haemolyticus strain possessed a LicD III
allele (Table 1). In contrast, the putative LicD protein
of H. haemolyticus strain 60P3H1 averaged only 69%
identity with the LicD alleles of H. haemolyticus strain
M07-22 and the three H. influenzae strains (Table 1).
BLAST analysis, however, revealed that it was 99%
identical to the deduced LicDIV protein of NT H. influenzae strain R2866, suggesting that H. haemolyticus
strain 60P3H1 contained a LicD IV allele. Together,
these data suggest that H. haemolyticus possess lic1
loci that are very similar to the lic1 loci described for
H. influenzae.

Prevalence of lic1 loci in H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus

As mentioned, the prevalence of the licA gene has been
reported for a phylogenetically defined NT H. influenzae
and H. haemolyticus strain collection [10]. We therefore
determined the distribution of the remaining lic1 locus
genes (licB, licC, and licD) among the same strains by
dot-blot hybridization. The licB-licD gene probes each
hybridized to three H. influenzae positive control strains
(Rd, 86-028NP, and R2866), to 81/88 (92%) NT H. influenzae strains and to 46/109 (42.2%) H. haemolyticus
strains. Four NT H. influenzae strains (53122, B01-21,
H08-25, and H10-21) that previously hybridized with
the licA gene probe did not hybridize with the licB-licD
probes. In addition, one NT H. influenzae strain (32324)
that did not previously hybridize with the licA gene
probe did hybridize with the licB-licD probes in this
study. Repeat hybridization of these discrepant strains
with the licA gene probe revealed that licA hybridization
was concordant with licB-licD hybridization, and that all
strains either lacked or possessed all four lic1 locus
genes. The probes did not hybridize to a negative control species (N. meningitidis) or to any of the remaining
NT H. influenzae or H. haemolyticus strains that previously failed to hybridize with the licA gene probe
(Table 2). The absence of the licA-licD genes in these

strains suggests that 8% of NT H. influenzae and 57.8%
of H. haemolyticus strains lack a lic1 locus for ChoP
expression, and that absence of a lic1 locus is 7.23 times
more prevalent in H. haemolyticus than in NT H. influenzae (expressed in Table 2 as 0.14 times prevalent for
NT H. influenzae, P < .05).
The prevalence of NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus strains possessing single or duplicate lic1 loci is not
known. Similar to the method reported by Fox et al
[35], we screened our 81 NT H. influenzae and 46 H.
haemolyticus lic1-containing strains for duplicate lic1
loci using Southern hybridization of Mfe1 digested genomic DNA to identify two restriction fragments that
hybridized with a licD gene probe. Strains with two
licD-hybridizing bands were present in seven NT H.
influenzae strains and in none of the H. haemolyticus
strains. Further hybridization using a licA gene probe on
the seven NT H. influenzae strains also revealed two
licA hybridizing bands in these strains, suggesting that
they possessed two complete lic1 loci. Assessing the
population prevalence of lic1 locus copy number among
the species, the data suggest that 74/88 (84%) NT H.
influenzae and 46/109 (42.2%) H. haemolyticus possess
one copy of lic1, and that strains with one lic1 locus are
2.18 times more prevalent in NT H. influenzae than in
H. haemolyticus (P < .0001) (Table 2). Duplicate lic1
loci were present in 7/88 (8%) NT H. influenzae and 0/
109 (0%) H. haemolyticus strains, suggesting that duplicate lic1 loci in H. haemolyticus are rare or altogether
absent (Table 2).
Prevalence of the three LicD alleles in NT H. influenzae
and H. haemolyticus

Determining the prevalence of the three previously
described licD alleles among the two species was
initiated by PCR amplification and DNA sequence analysis of the licD genes from the 74 NT H. influenzae
and 46 H. haemolyticus strains in our collection that
contained a single lic1 locus. The deduced LicD aminoacid sequences of these strains were determined [GenBank:HM133649-HM133768] and the licD gene from
one NT H. influenzae strain (Mr27) was repeatedly
found to possess a nonsense mutation that would result
in gene termination. A minimum-evolution dendrogram
(in radiation view) was created from the remaining LicD
amino-acid sequences of the NT H. influenzae and H.
haemolyticus strains. The dendrogram revealed three
distinct clusters, each containing a different H. influenzae prototype LicD allele (LicDI from strains Rd and 86023NP, LicDIII from strain E1a, and LicDIV from strain
R2866) (Figure 2). These results suggest that the three
previously defined LicD alleles represent the major allelic variants found among the H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus species.

alleles. The major clusters of H. influenzae (blue dots) and H.
haemolyticus (red dots) strains are labeled by their predicted allele
(LicDI, LicDIII, and LicDIV) and prototype LicD alleles from H.
influenzae strains are shown for each cluster (black dots, E1a is
partially hidden). The LicD protein of N. lactamica is the out-group
for the analysis (green triangle).

Next, we determined the population prevalence of
specific licD alleles in our NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus strains. Among the 88 total NT H. influenzae
strains in the collection, 43 (49%) possessed a single
licDI allele, 19 (22%) possessed a single licDIII allele, and
25 (28%) possessed a single licDIV allele (Table 2). In
contrast, only 1 of the 109 (0.9%) H. haemolyticus
strains possessed a licDI allele while 23 (21%) possessed
a single licDIII allele and 23 (21%) possessed a single licDIV allele. Although the prevalence of single licDI alleles
was statistically different between NT H. influenzae and
H. haemolyticus (P < .0001), the prevalence of the licDIII
and licDIV alleles was not statistically different between
the species (Table 2). Assessment of licD gene alleles
among the seven dual lic1 locus-containing NT H. influenzae strains was determined by PCR amplifying and
sequencing licD from agarose gel slices of strain DNA
digested with Mfe1. The results revealed that 4/88
(4.5%) strains had licDIII-licDIV alleles, while only 1/88
(1.1%) strains each were found to possess combinations
of licD I -licD III , licD I -licD IV , and licD I -licD I alleles
(Table 2). Together, these results suggest that the licDI

McCrea et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:286
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/286

allele is rarely present in H. haemolyticus, and that the
proportions of licD III and licD IV alleles are similar
between the species.
ChoP phase variation and the number of licA
tetranucleotide (5’-CAAT-3’) repeats among NT H.
influenzae and H. haemolyticus

Phase variation of ChoP expression is similar between
NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus. The licA genes
of H. haemolyticus strains M07-22 and 60P3H1 contained a number of 5’-CAAT-3’ repeats that would place
the licA gene in a correct translational open reading
frame (data not shown). ChoP expression in these two
strains was corroborated by Western immunoblot where
TEPC-15 reactive epitopes were present in each strain
(Figure 1, lanes 4 and 5). In addition, phase-negative
variants could be isolated from each H. haemolyticus
strain, and DNA sequence analysis revealed that each
licA repeat region gained one 5’-CAAT-3’ repeat, placing the licA gene out of frame (data not shown).
Mutation rates in contingency loci are proportional to
the length of the repeat region in the loci and the repeat
region length may therefore affect the ability of bacteria
to respond to a host immunologic challenge [31]. To
determine if a general population difference of licA
repeat length exists between the species in this study,
we compared the number of licA 5’-CAAT-3’ repeats
between the 74 NT H. influenzae and 46 H. haemolyticus strains that contained a single lic1 locus. DNA
sequence analysis of PCR amplified repeat regions from
these strains revealed a wide range in repeat numbers
for both species (5-45 and 6-56 repeats for NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus, respectively) (Figure 3, Table
3). The average number of licA repeats between the species, however, was statistically different with NT H.
influenzae having a mean of 27 repeats and H.

Page 6 of 12

haemolyticus having a mean of 15 repeats (P < .0001
using the student’s T test) (Table 3). These results suggest that, at the population level, the contingency
response for ChoP expression may be slower for H. haemolyticus than for NT H. influenzae.
H. influenzae strains that express ChoP at more distal
positions in LOS (i.e. ChoP substituted on an oligosaccharide extending from heptose III) have been shown to
be more vulnerable to CRP binding, leading to activation of complement mediated bactericidal killing [28].
Therefore, strains may differ in their licA mutation rates
depending on which LOS structure is modified with
ChoP. To test this, we further stratified the number of
licA gene repeats between strains with different licD
alleles for each species. Among NT H. influenzae, the
range of repeats was similar among strains that possessed a licDI , licDIII , or licD IV allele (6-45, 5-43, and
9-42 repeats, respectively) (Table 3). The average number of repeats was significantly different, however, for
strains that possessed a licDIII allele (34 repeats) than
for strains that possessed a licDI or licDIV allele (25 and
26 repeats, respectively) (P = .015 and .032 using the
student’s T test, respectively) (Table 3). Among H. haemolyticus, the range of licA repeats was more variable
between strains with licDIII and licDIV alleles (6-56 and
6-27 repeats, respectively), due mainly to three licDIIIcontaining strains with licA genes that contained 39, 40,
and 56 repeats (Table 3, Figure 3). In contrast to NT H.
influenzae, however, the average number of repeats was
not significantly different between H. haemolyticus
strains possessing licD III or licD IV alleles (16 and 13,
respectively) (Table 3). These results suggest that NT H.
influenzae strains that substitute ChoP on more proximal, exposed oligosaccharides chains may tend to have
increased mutation rates within the repeat region of the
licA gene.

Discussion
The strain population structure of NT H. influenzae is
genetically very diverse and clones or clusters of NT H.
influenzae strains that differentiate virulent from commensal strains have not been identified [10,41]. Given
this diversity, together with the high prevalence of NT
H. influenzae colonization in the healthy human population, it is reasonable to hypothesize that not all NT H.
influenzae strains possess the same ability to cause disease, but rather, that a proportion of strains possess a
range of variable genetic traits that allow for infection
and disease under the right host conditions [42]. Thus,
comparison of genetic trait prevalence between populations of NT H. influenzae and the closely related but
strictly commensal species, H. haemolyticus, will highlight traits within the species’ gene pools that may offer
clues to the virulence pathways of NT H. influenzae. For
instance, ChoP expression in NT H. influenzae is
strongly implicated as a virulence factor [43,44] and is
thought to enhance virulence though increased epithelial
cell adherence, inhibition of bactericidal peptides, and
modulation of the immune system during biofilm
growth [20-22]. In this study, 58% of H. haemolyticus
strains lacked a lic1 locus (and the ability to express
ChoP) while only 8% of NT H. influenzae strains lacked
a lic1 locus, suggesting that, at a population level, ChoP
expression may provide an advantage for more NT H.
influenzae strains to cause disease. Furthermore, the
trend of shorter licA gene repeat regions in H. haemolyticus strains that possess a lic1 locus (and the potential
to express ChoP), may suggest that those strains have a
slower phase-variable response to host defences targeting ChoP (i.e. CRP), potentially limiting their survival in
inflammatory environments. Obviously, prevalence differences in ChoP expression alone do not account for
all differences in disease potential between the species
since many other virulence factors have been described

for NT H. influenzae. Rather, the differential prevalence
of genetic traits between the species highlight factors
that may be further studied for their roles in virulence
using in vitro and in vivo models of NT H. influenzae
infection.
Although the structure of H. haemolyticus LOS is
unknown, the assumption has been made that basic
LOS structures and biosynthesis of ChoP modifications,
mediated by the phosphocholine transferase, LicD, are
comparable between NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus. Some evidence suggests that these assumptions
are reasonable. In the tricine SDS-PAGE experiments of
this study, H. haemolyticus LOS migrated at a rate similar to the LOS of NT H. influenzae, and H. haemolyticus
LOS also presented intra and inter-strain structural heterogeneity similar to the LOS of NT H. influenzae (Figure 1). Recent structural analysis on the LOS of
Haemophilus parainfluenzae, a member of the Pasteurellaceae family that is phylogenetically more distant to
NT H. influenzae than H. haemolyticus, revealed that
the inner core structure was nearly identical to that of
NT H. influenzae [45]. Furthermore, the LicDIII and LicD IV alleles of the two H. haemolyticus strains in this
study demonstrated higher sequence identity (95-99%)
to their cognate proteins in NT H. influenzae than similar comparisons of LicA, LicB, and LicC proteins (8794%, Table 1), suggesting a functional equivalence of the
LicD protein alleles. Although these observations are
circumstantial, they argue for more detailed comparisons of LOS structures between NT H. influenzae and
H. haemolyticus to identify dissimilarities between the
structures that may be associated with the ability of NT
H. influenzae to cause disease.
The results of this study suggest that genotypes facilitating LOS-ChoP structures that are not conducive to
CRP binding predominate among the strain populations
of both species; the majority of H. haemolyticus strains
(58%) lacked a lic1 locus (indicating no ChoP expression) and the majority of NT H. influenzae strains either
lacked a lic1 locus or possessed a single licDI allele (an
allele known to dampen CRP binding by positioning
ChoP substitutions from the proximal inner core heptose) (54% total strains). In comparison, strains possessing single licDIII and licDIV alleles were in smaller, but
similar fractions in the strain populations of both species (16-23%), indicating that these allelic distributions
are still maintained in the species despite possible
increased vulnerability to CRP binding. Further studies
that assess the prevalence of licD alleles between epidemiologically comparable collections of virulent and commensal NT H. influenzae strains may highlight which
alleles are important in NT H. influenzae disease.
One ChoP genotype that may be associated with NT
H. influenzae disease isolates is the possession of two

McCrea et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:286
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/286

lic1 loci in the same strain where each locus contains a
different licD allele, providing the bacteria with two
independently phase-variable ChoP substitutions. Fox et
al [35] demonstrated that 4/25 (16%) NT H. influenzae
middle ear strains had dual lic1 loci. In the current
study, only NT H. influenzae and not H. haemolyticus
possessed dual lic1 loci. Although only 7 of 88 (8%)
total NT H. influenzae strains had dual loci, six were
present among 43 (14%) middle ear strains present in
this collection (unpublished results). Fox et al. [35] also
noted that the genome sequenced NT H. influenzae
strain, R2846, possessed a complete and partial lic1 loci,
each containing a different licD allele, raising the possibility that other strains may have a similar genotype. An
extensive search on the lic1-containing strains in this
collection using licD-specific PCR and hybridization,
however, did not identify any strains (apart from the
seven dual lic1 locus strains) that contained more than
one licD allele, suggesting that the NT H. influenzae
population contains mainly complete copies of lic1
(unpublished results).
Although NT H. influenzae LOS structural studies
have identified ChoP modifications on oligosaccharides
extending from the heptose II position [46], specific licD
alleles mediating this arrangement have not been characterized. It is possible that one or more of the current
LicD alleles may overlap in this process or that stochastic factors in LOS biosynthesis may play a role. In addition, the clustering analysis of LicD protein alleles
present in Figure 2 suggests that sub-variants may exist
within the major allelic groups, and it is possible that
one of these variants may facilitate heptose II-associated
ChoP substitutions.
As reviewed by Moxon et al [27], strains that are
genetically and epidemiologically unrelated vary widely
in the lengths of SSR (including licA tetranucleotide
repeats), while individual strains that transmit within an
outbreak or are extensively subcultured over time maintain a central modality in repeat numbers [32,33]. Using
a larger number of samples from a phylogenetically
defined collection of NT H. influenzae strains has
allowed us to partially resolve distribution trends for the
licA repeat region in the NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus populations (Figure 3) and make statistical
comparisons between and within species (Table 3). We
found statistically significant trends toward the increased
length of licA tetranucleotide repeats in NT H. influenzae compared to H. haemolyticus, and in NT H. influenzae strains with licD III alleles compared to NT H.
influenzae strains with licD I or licD IV alleles. Longer
repeat regions are predicted to increase lic1 loci mutation rates and ChoP phase variation, providing increased
resistance to host clearance mechanisms such as CRP or
antibodies that bind ChoP and initiate complement

mediated bactericidal killing. The presence of the longest repeat (56 repeats) in a H. haemolyticus strain and
only five repeats in a licDIII-containing NT H. influenzae
strain, however, are reminders that these trends must be
considered in the light of numerous other factors that
contribute to the commensal life style of both species
and disease potential of NT H. influenzae.

Conclusions
In summary, the lic1 locus is not part of the conserved
“core” genome of the H. influenzae population but is
part of the flexible gene pool that exists among different
strains [47]. Nonetheless, the conserved chemical nature
of ChoP and the discovery of anti-ChoP antibodies in
human serum provides reasonable credence to ChoP as
a vaccine candidate that may inhibit H. influenzae at
some point in the infectious process. Knowledge of how
ChoP expression varies both genetically and structurally
within the NT H. influenzae strain population is critical
for designing intervention strategies that will effectively
target disease-related strains. Furthermore, contrasting
the genetic properties of NT H. influenzae ChoP expression with those of H. haemolyticus, a closely related but
non-pathogenic species, has highlighted a number of
ChoP expression differences (lic1 copy number, licD
alleles, and licA repeat number) that may provide an
advantage to disease-related growth in NT H. influenzae.
Methods
Bacterial strains and culture methods

For most studies, bacteria were grown on chocolate agar
plates (BBL). ChoP expression was carried out on
Levinthal agar [48]. All cultures were incubated at 37°C
with 5% CO2.
The 88 NT H. influenzae and 109 H. haemolyticus
strains were parts of various collections obtained by this
or other laboratories in previous studies [13,49-54] . All
clinical and commensal strains in the current study were
used with the approval of the University of Michigan
Institutional Review Board. These same strains have been
previously characterized for their taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships [10]. Reference strains used in this
study included the complete or partially genome
sequenced H. influenzae strains Rd (KW-20, ATCC
51907), 86-028NP [NT nasopharyngeal strain associated
with otitis media], R2866 (INT-1, ATCC 51997; a NT,
invasive strain), and a H. haemolyticus type strain, ATCC
33390. A negative-control species, N. meningitidis strain
G1723, was used in dot-blot hybridization. Two H. haemolyticus strains, M07-22 and 60P3H1, were used to
detail the lic1 locus and demonstrate ChoP expression in
H. haemolyticus. M07-22 is a hemolytic strain obtained
from the throat of a healthy child attending day care and
60P3H1 is a non-hemolytic strain from the sputum of an

McCrea et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:286

adult with COPD (although not associated with COPD
exacerbation) [10,13].
DNA isolation and PCR

Purified genomic DNA for Southern blots or PCR template was obtained from bacterial strains using the
Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit from Promega,
Co. (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides for PCR amplification of gene probes, lic1 loci, and licD alleles were
synthesized by Invitrogen and are shown in Table 4.
PCR amplification of the tetranucleotide repeat region
was performed as previously described [23] and
sequence analysis was done with the primers listed in
Table 4. PCR conditions have been described elsewhere
[10] and all amplification products were confirmed by
1%-agarose gel electrophoresis.
DNA sequencing

DNA sequences of the lic1 loci of H. haemolyticus
strains M07-22 and 60P3H1, the licD allelic genes and
the tetranucleotide repeat regions of all strains in the
collection possessing licA-licD genes were obtained
from PCR products purified on QIAquick columns from
Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Automated fluorescent dideoxyDNA sequencing was done by the University of Michigan DNA sequencing core on an ABI model 3730
sequencer. Sequence editing and gene and locus assembly were done with Lasergene software (version 7.0;
DNAStar, Madison, WI). Cluster analysis of the LicD

Page 9 of 12

protein alleles was done using Mega software (version
3.1) [55]. A bootstrap consensus, minimum-evolution
dendrogram of LicD amino-acid sequence was made
with 1,000 replicates.
Dot and Southern-blot hybridization

The bacteria were harvested in PBS to an O.D.600 of 1.0,
lysed, and frozen as previously described [10]. For dotblot analysis, 40 μl of crude lysate DNA obtained from
Haemophilus strains grown on chocolate agar was
applied in an 8 × 12 array on nylon membranes as previously described [10].
PCR-amplified genes were purified from agarose gels
using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and
labeled with the AlkPhos Direct™ Labeling and Detection System (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Probes
were hybridized to the dot-blot membranes under stringent conditions and developed by the ECF detection system (GE Healthcare). Probe signal intensity was read by
a Storm™ 860 phosphorimager and analyzed with ImageQuant version 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics/GE
Healthcare) [10].
Southern blots to identify lic1 loci in H. haemolyticus
strains M07-22 and 60P3H1 or to determine the prevalence of lic1 locus duplication in all strains with licA-licD genes contained purified strain DNA digested with
EcoRI and Mfe1, respectively. As previously reported by
Fox et al [35], strains with duplicate lic1 loci appear on
Southern blots as two Mfe1 fragments that hybridize

with either licA or licD gene probes. In our study, we
used a licD gene probe consisting of combined PCR
products representing all three licD alleles (licDI from
NT H. influenzae strain 86-028NP and licDIII and licDIV
from H. haemolyticus strains M07-22 and 60P3H1,
respectively). All gene probes were labeled, hybridized,
and detected as described for dot-blot hybridization,
above.
SDS-PAGE and immunoassays

Whole-cell lysates for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
were obtained by harvesting bacteria in PBS to an O.D.
of 1.0, and diluting 4 fold in tricine sample buffer. In
the proteinase K experiments, 10 μl of the suspension
was incubated with .5 mg/ml of proteinase K at 55 °C
for 2 hours. Untreated or treated bacterial suspension
and equal volumes of sample buffer were then heated at
100 °C for 10 min. and 3 μl of preparation were loaded
and run on Novex 16% tricine SDS-PAGE gels and
XCell Surelock™Mini-Cell apparatus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Western transfer was performed on a Mini transblot apparatus from Bio-Rad on nitrocellulose membrane (NCM) from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Colony
blots were prepared by suspending one colony from the
strain of interest in 1 ml of PBS, and plating 100 μl of
10 -6 and 10 -8 dilutions on Levinthal agar. Following
overnight growth, the colonies were blotted onto NCM
discs (Millipore), and the blots were immediately washed
in PBS and immunoassayed.
Western and colony-blot immunoassays were performed by first blocking membranes in PBS containing
2% non-fat dry milk [blotto [56]] for one hour. The
blots were then placed in TEPC-15 mAb (Sigma) diluted
1:5000 in blotto for one hour, washed three times with
PBS and incubated for one hour in PBS containing
1:5000 goat, anti-mouse IgA antibody conjugated to
alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). Following three washes
with PBS, a colorimetric reaction was obtained with
nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro3’-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt (BCIP) substrate
(Pierce, Rockford, IL).
Statistical analyses

All prevalence data were entered in Excel software
(Microsoft) in binary form for the presence (which was
given a value of 1) or absence (which was given a value
of 0) of any given ChoP-associated genotype. The prevalence ratios of genotypes between NT H. influenzae and
H. haemolyticus were calculated as a ratio of the proportions of genotypes among each species. Chi-square analysis was used to determine the significance of the
differences of the genotype associations between species.
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software

(version 9.1). Statistical differences in the length of
repeat-regions were tested by pair-wise comparisons
with the student’s T test.
