tolerance mechanisms

Abstract
Background: Populus euphratica is a salt tolerant and Populus × canescens a salt sensitive poplar species. Because
of low transcriptional responsiveness of P. euphratica to salinity we hypothesized that this species exhibits an
innate activation of stress protective genes compared with salt sensitive poplars. To test this hypothesis, the
transcriptome and metabolome of mature unstressed leaves of P. euphratica and P. × canescens were compared by
whole genome microarray analyses and FT-ICR-MS metabolite profiling.
Results: Direct cross-species comparison of the transcriptomes of the two poplar species from phylogenetically
different sections required filtering of the data set. Genes assigned to the GO slim categories ‘mitochondria’, ‘cell
wall’, ‘transport’, ‘energy metabolism’ and ‘secondary metabolism’ were significantly enriched, whereas genes in the
categories ‘nucleus’, ‘RNA or DNA binding’, ‘kinase activity’ and ‘transcription factor activity’ were significantly
depleted in P. euphratica compared with P. × canescens. Evidence for a general activation of stress relevant genes
in P. euphratica was not detected. Pathway analyses of metabolome and transcriptome data indicated stronger
accumulation of primary sugars, activation of pathways for sugar alcohol production, and faster consumption of
secondary metabolites in P. euphratica compared to P. × canescens. Physiological measurements showing higher
respiration, higher tannin and soluble phenolic contents as well as enrichment of glucose and fructose in P.
euphratica compared to P. × canescens corroborated the results of pathway analyses.
Conclusion: P. euphratica does not rely on general over-expression of stress pathways to tolerate salt stress.
Instead, it exhibits permanent activation of control mechanisms for osmotic adjustment (sugar and sugar alcohols),
ion compartmentalization (sodium, potassium and other metabolite transporters) and detoxification of reactive
oxygen species (phenolic compounds). The evolutionary adaptation of P. euphratica to saline environments is
apparently linked with higher energy requirement of cellular metabolism and a loss of transcriptional regulation.

Background
Salinization due to sea-level rise, decreased ground
water recharge, inappropriate irrigation regimes, and
increases in evapotranspiration is a major threat to sustainable land-use [1]. To prevent soil degradation and to
maintain productivity in areas affected by salinity, cultivation of salt tolerant plants is required. This applies

not only to agricultural crops, but also to woody plants
that are gaining importance as renewable resources.
Over the past years, poplar (Populus sp.), a fast growing species with high biomass production, has been
established as a model organism for tree research [2-4].
Among the species of this genus Populus euphratica
Olivier occurs naturally in salt afflicted areas [5] and
exhibits high salt tolerance [6]. Under saline conditions,
P. euphratica is able to maintain higher growth rates
and higher photosynthetic rates than other poplar species [7]. To gain insight into the molecular basis of its
ability to resist salt stress, transcriptional changes were

investigated during short-term salt exposure under controlled conditions as well as in long-term salt acclimated
mature trees grown in natural environments [8,9]. Previous microarray analyses based on a stress-responsive
EST collection of approximately 6340 unique P. euphratica genes revealed surprisingly few, i.e., only 22 genes
whose transcript abundances were affected by salinity
under field conditions [9]. We, therefore, hypothesize
that P. euphratica developed innate mechanisms to tolerate salt stress that may require no immediate gene
regulation.
Salt cress (Thellungiella halophila), a close relative of
the herbaceous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana,
occurs in harsh environments. When salt cress was
exposed to excess salinity only relatively few stressresponsive genes were detected compared with Arabidopsis that exhibited a global defense strategy [10].
Transcriptome and metabolome analyses suggested
stress-anticipatory preparedness in salt cress [10,11].
High levels of stress tolerance are the result of evolutionary adaptation. In addition to other possibilities,
plants thriving in extreme environments may achieve
protection by constitutive activation of stress-related
gene networks. As a consequence these regulons can
not be detected by classical microarray approaches analyzing transcriptional changes in response to stress.
To elucidate differences in constitutive gene regulation
of salt tolerant and sensitive species, direct cross-species
comparisons are required. A difficulty, usually limiting
straightforward whole genome comparisons between different species, is that for non-model species microarrays
are not available and hybridization efficiencies of different species are affected by sequence dissimilarities of
bait set (= probe set of the model species on the microarray) and prey set (cDNAs of transcripts of either
model or non-model species). In spite of the above problems, cross-species hybridizations have recently been
successfully applied to a number of species when their
evolutionary distances were close [12]. The problem has
also been partially circumvented by disregarding genes
with lower transcript abundances because ‘apparent
decreases’ might have been caused by lower hybridization efficiencies, whereas stronger responses between
non-model prey and model bait set are indicative for
higher transcript abundance [13].
The major goal of our study was to investigate
whether P. euphratica possesses a preventive stress
defense strategy involving constitutive activation of protective pathways. To this end we compared available
sequence data of P. euphratica genes with those of
Populus × canescens (syn. P. tremula × P. alba
[Aiton] Sm.), a salt sensitive species [14-16]. Since this
analysis revealed high nucleotide identity we used Affymetrix GeneChip Poplar Genome Array to examine

transcriptional differences of P. euphratica and P. ×
canescens. The Poplar Genome Array contains 56,055
probe sets (= baits) that can be interrogated, each composed of 11 individual probes. The array covers the
whole genome of P. trichocarpa (31,999 probe sets
based on gene predictions and EST evidence) and contains additionally 23,657 probes sets of 13 further poplar
species (based on mRNA or EST sequence data) including P. euphratica as well as P. × canescens [17]. Here,
we provide evidence that evolutionary distance of prey
and bait sets affect the results but that a condensed data
set can be used after application of appropriate quality
filters. Key pathways identified by this approach to differ
between the two poplar species were validated by targeted biochemical and physiological analyses as well as
by non-targeted metabolite profiling applying Fourier
Transform-Ion Cyclotron Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR
MS) [18-20]. Metabolome and transcriptome data were
combined by pathway analysis tools [21,22]. We provide
evidence that energy metabolism, ion compartmentalization, and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways constitute major differences between P. euphratica and P. ×
canescens.

Results
Sequence identity of structural genes of P. trichocarpa,
P. euphratica and P. × canescens is high

A prerequisite for a transcriptional comparison of
P. euphratica and P. × canescens is a high sequence
identity of their mRNAs with the probe set oligonucleotides on the microarray, which are mainly based on
P. trichocarpa genome data [3]. Therefore, we compiled
available sequence information for cDNAs of P. × canescens (Pc), P. euphratica (Pe), and P. trichocarpa (Pt). We
found full-length and partial sequences of 20 genes for
all three poplar species, which were used to assess their
relationship by analysis of nucleotide identity (Table 1).
Identity was usually high with mean values between 95.6
and 97.2%, and no significant differences between the
pair wise comparisons of Pc/Pt and Pe/Pt, between Pe/
Pc and Pc/Pt or between Pe/Pc and Pe/Pt were found at
P ≤ 0.05 (Bonferoni test). However, there are individual
examples for low sequence identity, e.g., NdID (NAD+
dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in Table 1).
Detection and evaluation of transcripts differentially
expressed between P. euphratica and P. × canescens

The transcriptomes of mature, fully light-exposed leaves
of soil grown P. euphratica and P. × canescens plants
were compared by microarray analysis on GeneChip
Poplar Genome arrays. In the first step, differentially
expressed transcripts were identified by established
methods employing significance analysis of microarrays
(SAM) and removing transcripts with low signal

following reasoning: since each mean signal is the result
of signal intensities of 11 oligonucleotides from different
regions of a gene (= 1 probe set), it is likely that
sequence divergence will lead to irregular binding of
cDNAs within the probe set and thus cause higher SD.
High sequence divergence may affect binding efficiencies
and thus lead to erroneous results regarding transcript
abundance. The validity of this filtering step was corroborated by qRT-PCRs conducted for genes with high
and low SDs. Indeed, only those with SDs within the 90
to 95% range showed a significant correlation with the
probe sets on the array (R = 0.909, P = 0.032), whereas
those within the upper 5% quantile showed no correlation of qRT-PCR and array signal intensities (R =
-0.376, P = 0.536, Figure 1).
Despite these efforts, three different groups of transcriptional responses of the Pe/Pc ratio were detected
depending on the species used to produce the array
probe set (Figure 2). The first and largest group was
based on sequences from poplars of the Tacamahaca
and Aigeiros sections (P. trichocarpa, P. trichocarpa ×

and P. euramericana). The transcript ratios of Pe/Pc in

this group showed a homogenous distribution of
increased and decreased transcript ratios (Figure 2).
This result is expected if the binding efficiencies of transcripts of the test species P. euphratica and P. × canescens with genes used to construct the probe sets on the
array are similar. Only genes of this group were used for
GO-term enrichment analyses.
The second group consisted of probe sets based on
species of the Leuce section of which P. × canescens is
a member (P. tremula × tremuloides, P. tremula, P. ×
canescens [= P. tremula × P. alba], P. alba × tremula
var. glandulosa, P. tremuloides and P. tomentiglandulosa). In this group, the distribution of Pe/Pc transcript
ratios showed a clear shift towards lower values. Since
it is unlikely that the Leuce section contains an overabundance of down-regulated genes this result is

probably influenced by sequence divergence resulting in
relatively stronger binding of P. × canescens-derived
cDNAs to the probe sets than those of P. euphratica,
consequently leading to an apparent decrease of the Pe/
Pc ratio. We have therefore excluded the genes with
decreased Pe/Pc ratio in the Leuce group from further
analyses. Vice versa, in the last group, the Turanga section which is formed by P. euphratica, the Pe/Pc ratio
was increased. Along the same line of argument, the
genes with increased Pe/Pc ratios were excluded (Table
2, filter f4*).
Since the goals of this study were functional categorization and pathway analyses, all transcripts without
annotation were removed from the list of significant
genes as proposed by Falcon and Gentleman [25]. The
final list of differentially expressed transcripts contained
2503 genes, of which 1645 had higher transcript abundances in P. euphratica and 858 in P. × canescens than
the respective other species (Table 2, Additional data
Table S1).
The transcriptomes of P. euphratica and P. × canescens
exhibit differences in transport, energy metabolism and
biosynthesis of secondary metabolites

To characterize differences between the transcriptomes
of the two poplar species, we used the GO slim terms of
the complex Gene Ontology annotations [26]. A ‘gene
universe’ of 14,254 eligible genes was compiled after
appropriate filtering from all 61,413 probe sets on the
microarray (Table 2). Significant over- and underrepresentation of GO slim terms for P. euphratica and P. ×
canescens were determined by a hypergeometric test. In
P. euphratica GO slim terms associated with transcription and regulation like ‘nucleus’, ‘DNA or RNA binding’, ‘transcription factor activity’, ‘kinase activity’ and
‘transcription’ were significantly underrepresented (Figure 3). This suggests that mechanisms to react to alterations of external conditions and to adapt the
transcriptome accordingly were less active in P. euphratica than in P. × canescens. Overrepresented GO slim
terms in the group of genes with higher expression in
P. euphratica were ‘other membranes’ (i.e. other than
plasma membrane), ‘mitochondria’, ‘cell wall’, ‘hydrolase
activity’ and ‘transporter activity’ (Figure 3). In P. ×
canescens, the only significantly overrepresented GO
slim term was ‘plasma membrane’. Neither of the species showed an over- or underrepresentation of the GO
slim term ‘response to stress’ contrary to our expectation (Figure 3).
For more detailed analysis, the best match of the
poplar gene models with Arabidopsis thaliana was
searched, AGI numbers were assigned to the poplar
genes, and Mapman was used for a functional classification [27]. In the category ‘transport’ a number of genes

algorithm and had probe set SDs in the lower 95% quantile were used (f2, Table 2). Signal log ratios were calculated as log-signal(P. euphratica) log-signal(P. × canescens), i.e. a positive value denotes a higher apparent expression in P. euphratica, a negative value correspondingly a higher
apparent expression in P. × canescens. Sample number of significant transcripts (n) is displayed for each species. Boxes represent the interquartile

slim annotations of genes with significantly higher relative transcript abundance in P euphratica (red) or P. × canescens (blue) compared with

for cation transport with higher transcript abundance in
P. euphratica than in P. × canescens were especially
conspicuous with respect to the increased salt tolerance
of P. euphratica (Additional file 1, Table S2). In the
category ‘cell wall’ numerous glycosylases and hydrolase
such as putative xyloglucan endotransglycosylases, glycosyl hydrolase family proteins in addition to pectin
esterases and fasciclin-like proteins had higher transcript
abundance in P. euphratica than in P. × canescens
(Additional file 1, Table S2). Analysis of the category
‘mitochondria’ revealed that most components of the
mitochondrial electron transport chain were up-regulated in P. euphratica compared with P. × canescens
(Figure 4). Furthermore, out of twelve significantly differentially expressed genes encoding mitochondrial
metabolite transporters, ten showed higher transcript
abundance in P. euphratica than in P. × canescens
(Figure 4).
Among all genes with significant changes that were
uploaded into Mapman (n = 2216), the category ‘secondary metabolism’ was significantly enriched (P = 0.02
after Benjamini Hochberg correction). This result was
corroborated using the original GO annotation of the
poplar gene models. Both GO terms ‘phenylpropanoid’
and ‘flavonoid biosynthetic process’ were significantly
enriched in P. euphratica compared with P. × canescens
with P = 0.042 and P = 0.046, respectively, after Benjamini Hochberg correction.

Integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic data on
pathway maps and validation by physiological and
biochemical analyses

The metabolomes of leaves of the two poplar species
were analyzed by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Identification of
ions was performed using ‘Mass Translator into Pathways’ [MassTrix; 22]. 789 ions were found with had significantly higher peak intensities in P. euphratica than
in P. × canescens. To 265 of these ions, a bulk chemical
formula could be assigned, of which 75 were annotated
in poplar. Where metabolites share an identical bulk
formula, multiple alternative annotations may be possible. Therefore, the 75 ions represent 39 different bulk
chemical formulas for metabolites with higher abundance in P. euphratica than in P. × canescens (Additional file 1, Table S3). In P. × canescens, 983 ions with
significantly higher peak intensities than in P. euphratica
were detected. Assignment of a bulk chemical formula
was possible for 313 ions, of which 96 with 51 different
bulk formulas were annotated in poplar (Additional file
1, Table S3).
Identified and annotated metabolites were automatically mapped to KEGG pathways using MassTrix, simultaneously implementing the transcriptomic data. For
this, Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers were obtained
for significant genes from the JGI P. trichocarpa project
[28]. Of the differentially expressed genes, 289 genes

with higher expression in P. euphratica than in P. ×
canescens and 132 genes with higher expression in P. ×
canescens than in P. euphratica could be annotated by
EC numbers and were added to the MassTrix pathway
analysis query.
Based on the results of the GO term enrichment analysis that indicated significant effects in secondary metabolism and mitochondrial energy metabolism, five
pathways were chosen from the 124 KEGG pathways
available for poplar: ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’, ‘flavonoid biosynthesis’, ‘citrate cycle’ with the connected
pathways ‘glycolysis/gluconeogenesis’ and ‘starch and
sucrose metabolism’.
The pathways of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis showed higher transcript abundances of
enzymes from P. euphratica than for those from P. ×
canescens, whereas the intermediate metabolites, with
the exception of sinapyl alcohol, were usually higher in
P. × canescens than in P. euphratica (Figure 5). Since
this result may indicate higher flux through the phenolic
pathway in P. euphratica than in P. × canescens, which
would be expected to result in increased concentrations
of end products, we determined soluble and non-soluble
phenolics and tannins. In fact, the concentrations of the
final products, especially condensed non-soluble tannins,
were significantly higher in P. euphratica than in P. ×
canescens (Figure 6a-d).

Since our transcriptome analysis pointed to higher
activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in
P. euphratica than in P. × canescens, we mapped
enzymes and metabolites of the glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, necessary to supply the respiratory
chain with reductant and localized in the cytosol and
the mitochondrial matrix, respectively (Figure 7). While
many of the enzymes involved in these pathways were
up-regulated at the transcriptional level in P. euphratica,
only few differences were found regarding the participating metabolites. Among these metabolites most were
increased in P. × canescens compared with P. euphratica
(Figure 7). Interestingly, the increases of metabolites
were observed at the entry point of the TCA cycle
(phosphoenol pyruvate, citrate, cis-aconitate and isocitrate), which may indicate lower demand and thus,
slower turn over of this pathway in P. × canescens. This
assumption was corroborated by lower dark respiration
in P. × canescens than in P. euphratica (Table 3).
Further analyses of carbohydrate metabolism indicated
up-regulation of transcripts for genes involved in starch
and carbohydrate metabolism in P. euphratica compared
with P. × canescens (Figure 8). In addition, pathway analysis of metabolome data pointed to increased concentrations of glucose and fructose in P. euphratica relative
to P. × canescens (Figure 8). Independent biochemical
carbohydrate analyses revealed that P. euphratica

Since carbohydrates also play roles in salt tolerance by
counteracting osmotic stress, transcriptional and metabolomic differences for ‘minor carbohydrates’ according to
Mapman categories were also studied. The raffinose and
myo-inositol pathways with enzymes leading to formation of galactinol, raffinose and stachyose as well as to
myo-inositol were transcriptionally increased in
P. euphratica compared with P. × canescens (Additional
file 1, Table S2). Increased concentrations of myo-inositol
and of raffinose were detected in P. euphratica compared
with P. × canescens (Additional file 1, Table S3).

Discussion
Direct transcriptome comparisons of different poplar
species are affected by their phylogenetic distances

In spite of its regular application, correct use of crossspecies hybridization on microarrays is still an intensively discussed topic. Mismatch as a result of single
nucleotide polymorphisms can decrease the signals of
single probes and influence the mean probe set signal
leading to a higher standard deviation as shown here
and in cases of strong sequence divergence to systematically lower signal intensities [23,30]. To avoid speciesrelated bias when comparing the transcriptomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and its close relative the salt tolerant
cress Thellungiella halophila on an Arabidopsis cDNA
microarray, only genes with higher signal ratios of Thellungiella/Arabidopsis were considered [13]. However,
this may lead to loss of important information with
respect to the biological differences.
Recently, Renn et al. [31] showed for different cichlid
fish species that the consistency of cross-species hybridization microarray results increased with decreasing phylogenetic distance of the analyzed species. For species
with a time of genetic divergence of less than 10 million
years (Mya) ago, transcription profiling gave most robust
results, but divergence times of greater than 65 Mya

were still acceptable. The genus of Populus diverged
from Salix around 60 to 65 Mya ago and evolution of
Populus proceeds relatively slowly, approximately at
one-sixth of the rate of Arabidopsis [3]. In line with this
notion sequence identity of structural genes between
P. × canescens, a species from the oldest section Leuce
and P. trichocarpa, which is member of the relatively
young Tacamahaca section [32], was not significantly
different from that between P. euphratica in the section
Turanga, which assumes a phylogenetically intermediate
position, and P. trichocarpa. Still, a clear species-related
bias for signal ratios was observed that reflecting the
genetic phylogeny of different poplar species. We, therefore, conclude that interspecific transcriptome comparisons using Poplar Genome Array between species from
different sections require the exclusion of false positives
by appropriate filtering procedures, whereas comparisons within a phylogenetic section are unproblematic.
Pathway mapping reveals differences in energy and
secondary metabolism between P. euphratica and
P. × canescens

Applying tools of systems biology, we demonstrated that
pathways of energy metabolism and for the production
of secondary metabolites constituted major differences

Page 10 of 17

between P. euphratica and P. × canescens. It has been
demonstrated for species in different kingdoms including poplars that transcript-level variation is under
genetic control and heritable [33-37]. The identified differences between the transcriptomes of a salt tolerant
and a susceptible poplar species reflect their inherited
molecular phenotypes since developmental and environmental factors, that are also influencing gene regulation,
were excluded. However, in contrast to our expectation
no evidence for general increases in typical pathways
mediating stress tolerance were found in P. euphratica
compared with P. × canescens. Similarly, transcriptional
comparisons of the salt tolerant T. halleri and the susceptible A. thaliana did not show activation of general
stress responses but rather pointed to a precise defence
strategy [10,38,39].
It is debatable if all observed differences between
P. euphratica and P. × canescens were specifically
related to their differences in salt susceptibility. For
example, increases in phenolics induced by chemical
effectors that resulted in ameliorative effects on salt
stressed plants also correlated with increases in other
antioxidative compounds [40]. Therefore, the contribution of phenolic compounds to improve salt persistence
is still elusive and requires further investigation. However, it is well known that phenolic compounds have
antioxidant properties [41]. Since excess salinity causes
oxidative stress [6], it is likely that phenol-based compounds prevent negative effects of salt-related oxidative
stress by scavenging free radicals, thereby, contributing
to maintain cell and tissue integrity. Notably, the phenylpropanoid metabolism was also among the significantly increased pathways identified in a comparison of
drought susceptible and tolerant poplar species [37].
Since P. euphratica is not drought tolerant [42] we
suggest that phenolic compounds do not constitute a
primary line of defence to prevent osmotic imbalance
but that their enrichment may enhance stress tolerance
by downstream effects such as affording increased
radical scavenging.
Further major transcriptional differences between the
two species were related to carbohydrate metabolism
and confirmed by analysis of carbohydrate concentrations. Enhanced glucose, fructose, raffinose, and myoinositol levels in P. euphratica leaves suggest that this
species is pre-adapted to osmotic stress. An interesting
feature is that the elevated carbohydrate concentrations
do not necessitate further increases in osmolytes upon
exposure to excess salinity. On the contrary, we have
previously shown that osmotic adjustment, which is
required when sodium accumulates, is achieved by
decreases in carbohydrates, especially that of glucose
[43]. Furthermore, some classes of osmolytes such as
sugar alcohols ameliorate the negative consequences of

Janz et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/150

high ionic strength by preventing unfolding and precipitation of proteins [44-46]. Further support for the
importance of chaperones for salt preparedness comes
from transcriptome analyses showing that transcript
levels of cyclophilins (category ‘cell organisation’), heat
shock proteins and chaperones (category stress) were
increased in comparison with P. × canescens (Additional
file 1, Table S3). It is probably an advantage of P.
euphratica that protective proteins and metabolites are
already in place before the stress starts. Up-regulation of
these pathways is found in P. × canescens only upon salt
exposure [47] and, therefore, the protective effect in salt
sensitive species may lag too much behind to prevent
effectively salt imposed injury.
Salt preparedness involves constitutively high expression
of ion carriers

A striking and important finding is the overrepresentation of transport systems in P. euphratica compared to
P. × canescens (Figure 3). A closer inspection of this
category shows the presence of ABC transporters, metabolite transporters, sugar transporters and transporters
with known functions in salt tolerance such as aquaporins, Ca2+, Na+, and K+ transporters [48]. For instance,
gating of aquaporins is important to maintain the water
balance under stress [49]. In several species, including
field grown P. euphratica, the expression of aquaporins
decreased under salt stress [9,50,51], whereas overexpression of aquaporins increased plant vigour only
under non-stressed conditions [52]. The activation of
water channels in non-stressed P. euphratica suggests
higher water supply under normal conditions. This conclusion is corroborated by a higher ratio of transpiration
to photosynthesis in P. euphratica than in P. × canescens supporting that P. euphratica is a phreatophytic
species [53].
Maintenance of calcium and potassium supply are
crucial features of salt tolerance [48]. In P. euphratica,
K+ efflux was lower than in a salt sensitive poplar species involving Na +-induced down regulation of potassium outward rectifying channels and nonselective
cation channels and regulated by Ca2+ [54,55]. In our
study, putative Ca 2+ -activated outward rectifying K +
channels showed higher expression in P. × canescens
than in P. euphratica, whereas several systems for K+influx were increased in P. euphratica. The expression
and response to salt stress of a large range of K+ channels has been screened in P. × canescens [16]. In leaves,
none of these transport systems increased in response to
salinity and some were not detectable such as the stelar
K+-outward rectifying channel (SKORC) that mediates
the delivery of K + from stelar cells to the xylem in
the roots towards the shoot. SKORC was neither
expressed in leaves Arabidopsis thaliana [56], whereas

Page 11 of 17

considerable activation was found in P. euphratica
leaves. The most important K+-transporter with respect
to salt tolerance is probably HKT1, which was among
the most highly upregulated genes (92 fold) in
P. euphratica compared with P. × canescens. HKT1 is a
high affinity K+ uptake transporter that facilitates Na+
homeostasis [57,58]. In Arabidopsis thaliana AtHKT1;1
controls the rate of Na+ transport from root to shoot by
the retrieval of Na+ from the xylem in the roots [59]
and therefore is a key factor in determining salt tolerance in various species [60]. In P. euphratica sodium
transport from root to shoot is also more strongly
restricted than in salt sensitive species but the molecular
basis of this effect is not yet known [61]. The strong
transcriptional activation of PeHKT1 suggests that this
transporter is crucial for the control of Na + in
P. euphratica leaves.
NHX-type antiporters, which are involved in Naextrusion from the cytosol back into the apoplast, or
into endosomal compartments or the vacuole [62,63],
were not identified in our analysis. However, NaHD1
was increased in P. euphratica compared with P. ×
canescens. NaHD1 is a sodium proton antiporter, whose
heterolog expression in E. coli that was lacking its two
sodium/proton antiporters NahA and NahB restored
salt tolerance [64]. The activity of PeNaHD1 is pH
dependent and functions only at low pH [64]. Maintenance of its activity therefore requires a sufficiently
large proton gradient. Our comparative analysis revealed
increased transcript levels of H + -ATPases suggesting
maintenance of a higher proton gradient in P. euphratica. Since permanent activation of proton pumps is
ATP-consuming, a higher energy demand is expected
for P. euphratica. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume
that the observed increases in mitochondrial respiration
in P. euphratica compared with P. × canescens are
required as driving force for a tighter control of ion
compartmentalization.

Conclusions
We showed that direct comparisons of the transcriptomes of different poplar species on Poplar Gene Array
are influenced by their phylogenetic distance, if the species are from different sections as applies for the salt
sensitive P. × canescens (Leuce) and the salt tolerant
P. euphratica (Turanga). This influence can be reduced
by application of appropriate filters. Using filtered transcriptome data, pathways for the production of secondary metabolites, and carbohydrates as well as a
significant enrichment of genes in the categories ‘transporters’ and ‘mitochondria’ were identified that were
activated in P. euphratica compared with P. × canescens.
This interpretation was corroborated by a combination
of metabolomic analyses and targeted biochemical and

Janz et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/150

physiological measurements suggesting that higher
metabolic flux through the pathways resulted in the
observed increases of phenolic end products and carbohydrates in P. euphratica compared with P. × canescens.
Tolerance mechanisms for excess salinity in P. euphratica are obviously relying on stronger pre-formed osmolyte and chaperone abundance and on tighter control of
ion compartmentalization requiring increased energy
allocation.
Underrepresentation of GO terms related to signaling
and transcription suggest that mechanisms responsible
for gene regulation and transcription were less active in
P. euphratica. Since previous analyses revealed only
moderate transcriptomic changes in response to stress
[9], we propose that the underside to a high level of
stress preparedness as a result of adaptation to a specific
ecological niche is a loss of flexibility and adjustability of
the transcriptome to environmental cues.
The results of our study may also have implications
for wood production. Poplars are fast fast-growing tree
species that constitute an important resource for woody
biomass. However, expansion of tree cultivation will
only be possible on marginal or polluted soils that are
not suitable for food production [65]. For this purpose
stress tolerant tree species are required. The results of
this study laid a foundation for understanding tree salt
tolerance at the level of system biology. This knowledge
can be used for tree improvement by biotechnological
methods or conventional breeding.

Methods
Plant culture

Plantlets from P. × canescens (P. alba × tremula) clone
INRA717 1-B4 and P. euphratica clone B2 from the Ein
Avdat valley in Israel were multiplied by in vitro micropropagation [66], transferred to aerated hydroponics
using Long Ashton nutrient solution [67] for acclimation to greenhouse conditions, subsequently potted into
soil (Frühstorfer Erde, Lauterbach-Wallenrod, Germany)
and grown for 3 months in a greenhouse at 20 to 25°C,
with a relative air humidity of 40 to 60% and additional
16 h of light (neon lamps: L58W/25 and 58W/840,
Osram, Munich, Germany, and TLD 58W/840 Philips,
Amsterdam, Netherlands) between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00
p.m. to reach a continuous photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) of 150 μmol m-2 s-1. Fully expanded leaves
were harvested at a stem height of approximately 70 cm
(upper third of the stem) after four h in the light period.
The leaves were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
kept at -80°C until further analysis.
Gas exchange

Gas exchange (net photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration) was measured (1 min means) with a portable

Page 12 of 17

gas exchange system (HCM-1000 or GSF-3000, Walz,
Effeltrich, Germany) under ambient conditions. For analysis of dark respiration plants were connected to the
system and kept for 30 min in darkness prior to analysis. For each plant (n = 5) the gas exchange values of
5 min were averaged.
FT-ICR-MS measurements

Of each species, 5 biological replicates were measured.
Frozen leaf tissue was ground in a ball mill (Retsch,
Haan, Germany). Fine powder was diluted in methanol
to a methanolic concentration of 70% to give highest
ion density inside the electrospray, without eliminating
those neutrals which are highly water soluble. Highresolution mass spectra were acquired on a Fourier
Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer
(APEX Qe, Bruker, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a
12-T superconducting magnet and an Apollo II Electrospray (ESI) source. The ionization source was run in the
negative operation mode to generate mono charged
negative ions. Thus, all important multi-functional
organic compounds which bear at least one acidic site
could be deprotonated to give rise to a detectable anion
in the mass spectrometer [18]. Each sample was introduced into the ionization source at a flow rate of 2 μL
min-1 by a microliter pump with a nebulizer gas pressure of 20 psi and a drying gas pressure of 15 psi
(heated to 200°C). Each sample was measured three
times and the signal intensities of each detected ion
were averaged before running the multi-dimensional
statistical data analysis.
Spectra were externally calibrated on clusters of arginine (10 mg l-1 in methanol); calibration errors in the
relevant mass range were always below 0.05 ppmv. The
spectra were acquired with a time domain of 1 Megaword with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range of 1462000. The spectra were zero filled to a processing size
of 2 Megawords. Before Fourier transformation of the
time-domain transient, a sine apodization was performed. No fragmentation experiments were performed
in this study. Thus, the whole mass range could be
scanned, and 300 scans were summed on in each acquisition. The ion accumulation time in the ion source was
set to 0.1 s.
FT-ICR mass spectra were exported to peak lists at a
signal to noise ratio (S/N) of two. From those lists, High
to Low signal intensity and Low to High signal intensity
profiles were obtained by use of the Hierarchical Clustering Explorer HCE Version 3.0 [68]. Ions with sharp
differences between the acquisitions of the two species
were highlighted as High to Low and Low to High signal intensity profiles. The m/z values of all ions were
clustered by the use of the average linkage method with
similarity/difference measure type: Euclidean distance.

The search method is model-based and the used distance measure was Pearson’s correlation coefficient of
0.8. For all obtained hits, t-tests were calculated to validate a statistical significance at a = 0.1.
Metabolite identification and annotation of the m/z
values was performed via the MassTRIX web site with
the following parameter settings: ‘Scan mode negative
ionisation (correct for H+ loss)’, ‘Max. error 1.0 ppm’,
‘Database KEGG with isotopes’, ‘Organism Populus trichocarpa’ [22]. Identified compounds and differentially
expressed genes added to the query as EC numbers
were automatically mapped to KEGG pathways using
KEGG/API [69]via MassTrix. Metabolites with the same
total formula could not be distinguished.
Analysis of soluble and cell wall bound phenolics

Frozen leaf tissue was ground in a ball mill (Retsch,
Haan, Germany). Fine powder (60 mg per sample) was
extracted with 2 ml of 50% methanol in an ultrasonic
bath (60 min, 40°C; Sonorex Super RK 510 H, Bandelin
electronics, Berlin, Germany). The extract was centrifuged, the pellet was extracted once again and the
supernatants were combined for analysis of soluble phenolics photometrically with the Folin Ciocalteus method
[70]. Catechin (Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany)
was used for calibration and the phenolic concentrations
were expressed as catechin equivalents.
To determine cell wall bound phenolics, the pellet was
washed with n-hexane, dried, and weighed. This pellet
representing cell walls was extracted with 1 M NaOH as
described earlier [70]. The extracted phenolic compounds were measured with the Folin Ciocalteous
reagent as above.
Analysis of soluble and non-soluble condensed tannins

Condensed tannins (proanthocyanidin) were determined
after [71]. For extraction of soluble tannins, plant materials ground to a fine powder were extracted with 50%
methanol, centrifuged, the pellet was re-extracted and
the extracted solutions were combined. Aliquots were
mixed with a reagent (1.6% methanol, acid butanol [5%
concentrated HCl in butanol (v/v)] and 0.2 ml of 2%
FeNH4(SO4)2·12H2O in 2 M HCl [FeNH4(SO4)2·12H2O/
HCl = w/v], incubated at 95°C and used to measure the
extinction at 550 nm. The amount of tannins was
expressed as absorbance per dry mass.
To determine non-soluble tannins, the pellet was lyophilized, weighed and resuspended in 1 ml of 100%
methanol. The slurry was combined with acid butanol
reagent and processed as above.

nitrogen and extracted in DMSO/HCl (dimethylsulfoxid:25% HCl = 80:20 (v:v)) at 60°C for 30 min. The
mixture was centrifuged and aliquots of the supernatant
were mixed with 0.2 M citrate buffer (pH 10.6). This
extract was mixed with a reaction mixture (0.75 M
triethanolamine-buffer, 4 mM NADP, 10 mM ATP,
9 mM MgSO4, pH 7.6) for enzymatic determination of
soluble sugars as described previously [72]. Glucose was
measured after addition of hexokinase (3 mg ml -1 ,
Roche Diognostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), fructose after addition of phosphoglucose isomerase (10 mg
ml-1, Roche Diognostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)
and sucrose after incubation with b-fructosidase (5 mg
ml-1, Roche Diognostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).
Calibration curves were produced with glucose, fructose
and sucrose. The sucrose content of the extracts was
below the detection limit of the method.
In silico sequence analysis

DNA sequences of twenty genes were compared
between P. × canescens, P. euphratica and P. trichocarpa. For five genes, full length sequences were
available for P. euphratica and P. × canescens cDNA
(’IAA-amino acid hydrolase’, Ill3 [[73] GenBank:
AJ744952, GenBank:AJ744953]; ‘Na/H antiporter type
D’, NhaD1 [[74] GenBank:AJ561195]; ‘salt induced serine-rich’ and ‘temperature induced lipocalin’, SIS and

GenBank:FJ238513, GenBank:FJ238512]; ‘gibberellin
regulated protein’, GAST, [GenBank:FJ238511, GenBank:
CF231013]). Criterion for the selection of further genes
was their representation by probe sets on the microarray
and the availability of sequence data for P. euphratica
and P. × canescens in public databases. Probe sets both
with and without significantly different signal intensities
between P. euphratica and P. × canescens were randomly chosen, and sequence data for the corresponding
P. trichocarpa gene model retrieved from the Populus
genome project (Table 1) [28]. Because most sequence
data is available from EST datasets and thus as cDNA
sequences, open reading frame (ORF) sequences of the
P. trichocarpa gene models were used to screen the
GenBank database for homologs in P. euphratica and
P. × canescens by using the Megablast algorithm [75].
Pair wise alignments and base identity calculations of
the cDNA sequences were generated with the GeneDoc
software [76]. An ANOVA was conducted to test for
significant differences between the sequence identity
values at a = 0.05.
RNA extraction

Soluble carbohydrates

Frozen tissues were ground to a fine powder with a ball
mill (Retsch, Haan, Germany) pre-cooled in liquid

Leaf material of 3 plants was pooled. Three biological
replicates per poplar species were analyzed (i.e. a total
of 9 nine plants per species was included). Frozen leaf

Janz et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:150

tissue was milled in a ball mill (Retsch, Haan, Germany).
Total RNA was extracted from 500 mg of frozen plant
powder according to Chang et al. [77] with minor modifications: No spermidine was applied in the extraction
buffer, and 2% b-mercaptoethanol was used. RNA was
additionally purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). Total RNA yield and purity were determined spectrophotometrically (BioPhotometer, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at A 260 and A 280 . RNA
integrity was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) at the Microarray Facility
(Tübingen, Germany).
Microarray analysis

Of each species, 3 biological replicates were analyzed on
the GeneChip® Poplar Genome Array (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA). Synthesis of one-cycle cDNA and biotinlabelled cRNA, fragmenting of cRNA, hybridization to
the Poplar Genome Array, washing, staining and scanning was performed as stated by Affymetrix (GeneChip®
Expression Analysis Technical Manual) at the Microarray Facility (Tübingen, Germany). Data were deposited
at ArrayExpress [EMBL: E-MEXP-1928].
Statistical analysis of the raw signal intensity data was
conducted using the following functions from packages
released by the bioconductor project, implemented in R
[78,79]. Background correction, quantile normalization
and summarization of the Affymetrix CEL output files
resulting in a raw list of normalized genes was computed by robust multi-array average (RMA) using the
‘rma’ function from the ‘affy’ package [23]. Statistical
testing for differentially expressed genes was performed
on this raw list with the ‘sam’ function from the ‘siggenes’ package [80]. In the SAM analysis, Δ was chosen
to obtain FDR = 0.05. Annotation of the genes was carried out via the PopArray-Database [81]. Gene Ontology
(GO) terms were matched via The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) [82].
Gene lists were subjected to several filtering processes
after [25]: genes that were not expressed were removed by
calculating Affymetrix’ MAS 5.0 change calls using the
‘mas5calls’ function from the ‘affy’ package; only genes
with two or three ‘present’ calls in any one of the two species were considered. Probe sets presumably affected by
differences in binding efficiencies were removed. For this
purpose, SDs of prey signals were calculated for each bait
set on a microarray and then averaged over all six microarrays for each gene. The resulting data were compared
with the range of the SDs of all prey set signals. A gene
was removed from the list when its prey signal SD was in
the upper 5% quantile of all ‘present’ bait set SDs on the
microarray. The setting of the threshold for this filter
affects the stringency of the results. For the purpose of
this study the upper 5%-quantile was used.

Page 14 of 17

Probe sets for which no annotation was available were
removed. In cases where multiple probe sets were
matched with the same JGI P. trichocarpa gene model,
duplicate probe sets were removed so that each gene
model was represented only once. The probe set with
the lower p-value in the SAM analysis was used for
further analysis if both genes showed the same direction
of change in gene expression. Probe sets annotated by
the same gene model with contrasting expression ratios
were removed.
Bioinformatic analyses

For evaluation of over- and underrepresented GO slim
terms, the frequencies of annotations within list of significant genes were compared to the frequencies within
the defined ‘gene universe’. Statistical testing was conducted by calculating the cumulative hypergeometric
distribution function, using the ‘phyper’ function in R.
Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied to the
resulting p-values using the ‘p.adjust’ function.
For statistical analysis of overrepresentation with ‘The
Ontologizer’ [83], a gene ontology file for Populus was
adapted. In this file, all JGI Populus trichocarpa gene
models represented on the Affymetrix GeneChip were
linked to the GO identifier of their closest Arabidopsis
matches as listed by TAIR [82]. The ‘population’ of the
Ontologizer conforms with our ‘gene universe’, whereas
the two lists of genes higher expressed in one of the
poplar species each correspond to a ‘study set’. As parameter settings, term-for-term analysis with BenjaminiHochberg correction was used.
qRT-PCR

For quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR), primer pairs
were designed for actin 9 [GenBank:AJ778775
(P. euphratica) and GenBank:CX656348 (P. × canescens)]
as a reference gene and 10 transcripts that were differentially expressed in P. euphratica and P. × canescens
(Additional file 1, Table S4). All primers met the following conditions: 1) 100% sequence identity with both
P. euphratica and P. × canescens cDNA; 2) fragment
lengths between 90 and 180 base pairs (bp); 3) calculated
salt-adjusted melting temperatures Tm(salt) between 58
and 62°C. Primer design was performed with the Oligo
Explorer, and suitable primers were tested for similar Tm
(salt), primer dimers and primer loops by Oligo Analyzer
(both Gene Link, Hawthorne, NY, USA).
Total RNA was DNAse treated with a Turbo DNAfree kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and transcribed to cDNA
with a RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). For each
gene, three technical repeats were analyzed for three
biological samples. The qRT-PCR was performed on an
iCycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 250 ng cDNA were

Janz et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/150

used in a 25 μl reaction with 1 × ABsolute qPCR SYBR
Green Fluorescein Mix (ABgene, Surrey, UK; including
Thermo-Start DNA Polymerase) and 10 μM primer.
First denaturation and activation of the Taq-polymerase
occurred at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s
and elongation at 72°C for 30 s.
qRT-PCR outputs of three biological replicates per
species and gene were analyzed using the MyiQ software
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Primer specificity was assessed
by melting curve analysis. Statistical analysis of expression ratios and standard error was conducted using a
pair wise fixed reallocation randomization test implemented in Excel with the Relative Expression Software
Tool (REST)-384 [84,85]. All primer pairs showed less
than 5% differences in PCR efficiency between
P. euphratica and P. × canescens.
Statistical analyses

Data are shown as means (± SE). Five to six plants were
analyzed per species. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) was
performed using Statgraphics (Centurion XV, St Louis,
MO). Significant differences at P ≤ 0.05 were calculated
by ANOVA followed by a Tukey-Kramer test [86].
