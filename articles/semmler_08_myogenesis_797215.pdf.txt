Abstract
Background: In order to increase the weak database concerning the organogenesis of Acoela –
a clade regarded by many as the earliest extant offshoot of Bilateria and thus of particular interest
for studies concerning the evolution of animal bodyplans – we analyzed the development of the
musculature of Symsagittifera roscoffensis using F-actin labelling, confocal laserscanning microscopy,
and 3D reconstruction software.
Results: At 40% of development between egg deposition and hatching short subepidermal fibres
form. Muscle fibre development in the anterior body half precedes myogenesis in the posterior half.
At 42% of development a grid of outer circular and inner longitudinal muscles is present in the
bodywall. New circular muscles either branch off from present fibres or form adjacent to existing
ones. The number of circular muscles is higher than that of the longitudinal muscles throughout all
life cycle stages. Diagonal, circular and longitudinal muscles are initially rare but their number
increases with time. The ventral side bears U-shaped muscles around the mouth, which in addition
is surrounded by a sphincter muscle. With the exception of the region of the statocyst,
dorsoventral muscles are present along the entire body of juveniles and adults, while adults
additionally exhibit radially oriented internal muscles in the anterior tip. Outer diagonal muscles
are present at the dorsal anterior tip of the adult. In adult animals, the male gonopore with its
associated sexual organs expresses distinct muscles. No specific statocyst muscles were found. The
muscle mantles of the needle-shaped sagittocysts are situated along the lateral edges of the animal
and in the posterior end close to the male gonopore. In both juveniles and adults, non-muscular
filaments, which stain positively for F-actin, are associated with certain sensory cells outside the
bodywall musculature.
Conclusion: Compared to the myoanatomy of other acoel taxa, Symsagittifera roscoffensis shows
a very complex musculature. Although data on presumably basal acoel clades are still scarce, the
information currently available suggests an elaborated musculature with longitudinal, circular and
U-shaped muscles as being part of the ancestral acoel bodyplan, thus increasing the possibility that
Urbilateria likewise had a relatively complicated muscular ground pattern.

Background
Acoela, supposedly the earliest recent bilaterian offshoot,
show only few morphological characters to infer their
evolution and their phylogenetic relationships [1]. They
are acoelomate, gutless ciliated worms mainly from
marine habitats and have traditionally been assigned to
the taxon Turbellaria within Platyhelminthes [2]. At
present, three major flatworm-like clades are often considered valid, namely Platyhelminthes, Nemertodematida
and Acoela, of which the latter two often are considered
sistergroups and combined in the phylum Acoelomorpha
[3-5], although other hypotheses, that argue for Acoela
and Nemertodermatida as two distinct phyla, do exist
[1,6-8]. Within the Acoela, the interrelationship of taxa
still remains unclear due to the lack of morphological
characters [9]. A recent molecular survey using the 18S
rDNA gene as a marker also supports the hypothesis that
most current acoel families are polyphyletic [10]. Morphological characters used to infer acoel interrelationships focus mainly on the male genital organs, but female
genital organs, the structure of the epithelium, the nervous system, the pharynx and the bodywall musculature
are also included in these analyses [11].
The architecture of the musculature has been proven useful to infer higher sistergroup relationships within, e.g.,
Childia and Convoluta, where specific muscle patterns as
well as sperm and stylet ultrastructure challenge their
monophyly [10,12,13]. Recently, the phylogeny of Convolutidae sensu [11] underwent some revisions, in which
all small Convolutida clustered together and are now classified in the newly erected taxon Isodiametridae outside
the Convolutidae, based on their penis musculature [14].
Other analyses suggest that all taxa that possess sagittocysts (i.e., needle-shaped secretory products), e.g., Symsagittifera roscoffensis, cluster in the monophyletic assemblage
Sagittiferidae [15,16].
In earlier studies the arrangement of the bodywall musculature was mainly characterized as part of the species
description without using it as a character for evolutionary
inferences e.g., [11,17-19]. However, recent studies
showed that variations in the muscular arrangement may
be successfully used for phylogenetic analysis [12]. Differences in shape, number, thickness, orientation, arrangement and presence/absence of muscles have been proven
useful [20], and descriptions of the adult musculature,
mainly of the bodywall, were carried out on more than 50
acoel species by applying fluorescence-coupled phalloidin
e.g., [12,21-26]. As such, the adult musculature was also
investigated in the three sagittiferid species Antrosagittifera
corallina, Convolutriloba longifissura and Convolutriloba macropyga [12,24,26]. With the present study we add to the
scarce data on acoel muscle formation by providing
detailed 3D reconstructions of the muscular architecture

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/14

of various stages of Symsagittifera roscoffensis (Graff, 1891),
which is currently also the subject of an extensive EST programme. We compare our data to the data available on
adult acoel muscle bodyplans as well as to the sole study
on acoel myogenesis available to date on Isodiametra pulchra [27].

Methods
Animals
Adults were collected in the upper part of the intertidal
zone on the Brittany Coast on the Ile Calot close to Carantec, France. Adults were kept in aquaria with natural,
unfiltered seawater at the Station Biologique de Roscoff
until egg laying was observed. Cocoons containing
embryos were isolated and cultured in sea water.

Prior to fixation, 7% MgCl2 was applied to avoid muscle
contraction. The specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 0.5–2 hours at
room temperature. The specimens were washed several
times in PB and stored at 4°C in 0.1 M PB with 0.1%
sodium azide (NaN3) added to prevent bacterial or fungal
contamination.
On the first day of egg deposition several cocoons with 2,
4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 cell stages were fixed, on the second
day embryos were fixed thrice, and from the third day
onwards embryos and juveniles were fixed once daily.
F-actin staining, data acquisition and 3D reconstruction
For F-actin visualization the specimens were incubated in
1:40 diluted Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) in 0.1 M PB containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% NaN3. After the overnight incubation
three washes in 0.1 M PB followed. The specimens were
mounted on Poly-L-lysine coated cover slips in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) and
stored at 4°C.

About 10 specimens per stage were analysed with a Leica
DM IRE 2 fluorescence microscope with a TCS SP2 AOBS
confocal laserscanning device (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Images were edited with the Leica confocal software, Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Adobe Illustrator
CS2 imaging softwares, respectively (Adobe Systems; San
Jose, CA, USA). For 3D reconstruction, the CLSM image
stacks were processed with Imaris 5.7.1 software (Bitplane
AG, Zürich, Switzerland).
A relative scale was used to indicate the position of the
mouth opening and the genital pores, as defined by Rieger
and Sterrer [28]. The total body length equals 100 units
(U), whereby the most anterior part of the specimen
marks U0 and the most posterior part U100.

Results
Landmarks of the life cycle and gross anatomy of S.
roscoffensis
The adults of Symsagittifera roscoffensis are elongated
worms with a length of 2–5 mm (Figure 1A). They are dorsoventrally flattened and approximately 350–500 μm
wide. The anterior and posterior tip is blunt, the posterior
end less than the anterior. The green colour of the adults
is due to the presence of the symbiotic algae Tetraselmis
convolutae. S. roscoffensis is a hermaphroditic species with
internal fertilization. Within a single cocoon, 10–20
embryos are found (Figure 1B). The embryos show duetspiral cleavage cf. also [29]. On the fourth day after egg
deposition the oval-shaped embryos begin to rotate
within the chorion. During the following day individuals
hatch from the broken chorion and swim freely in the culture dishes. The white juveniles are about 350 μm long
and 140 μm wide (Figure 1C and 1D, additional file 1). As
in the adults, the anterior tip is blunter than the posterior
tip. Within the next days the white aposymbiotic juveniles
take up the free living Tetraselmis convolutae from the seawater and gradually acquire the green colour (Figure 1E).
Myogenesis of S. roscoffensis
Embryonic musculature
In early cleavage stages, the zonulae adhaerentes of cells
are stained with phalloidin (Figure 2A). 33 hours after egg
deposition the embryo possesses about 370 cells. These
cells have a diameter of about 10 μm and a penta- or hexagonal profile. On the third day (40–60% of development
between egg deposition and hatching) an orthogonal
muscle grid of longitudinal and circular muscles forms
along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo (Figures 2,
3 and 4), and few diagonal muscles become visible (Figure 2C). Short fibres form randomly basally to the epidermis at 40% of development between egg deposition and
hatching. The anterior pole is surrounded by a spiral muscle fibre (Figure 2D, F), and the development of muscle
fibres in the anterior half precedes myogenesis in the posterior half (Figure 2C–F). The establishment of the muscle
grid seems more regular on the future ventral side than on
the dorsal side (Figure 2D, E). Solid circular muscles are
formed prior to the establishment of complete longitudinal muscles (Figure 2D–F). On the third day (approx. 50
hours and 42% of development between egg deposition
and hatching), while a simple muscle grid is already established (Figure 3A), a concentration of actin is exhibited in
the borders of surface cells (Figure 3B). Secondary circular
muscles form by branching off from already existing circular muscles (Figures 2D–F and 3C) as well as by creating
short double-stranded fibre zones, in which new fibres are
formed adjacent to existing circular muscles (Figure 2E,
F). Throughout the entire embryonic development more
circular than longitudinal muscles are present. Accordingly, there are about 30 circular muscles and about 20

longitudinal muscles discernable at the third day after egg
deposition (Figure 4). The solid muscle grid of the future
ventral side appears more irregular than that of the dorsal
side, which is caused by the presence of distinct muscles
which probably are associated with the future mouth (Figure 4A and 4B versus 4C). On the dorsal side, the muscle
grid is evenly distributed (Figures 4C and 5A, B). Internal
muscles, which are dorso-ventrally orientated, are present
at 72 hours (60% of development between egg deposition
and hatching). Embryos with an age of about 85 hours
(70% of development between egg deposition and hatching) show a ring muscle around the mouth.
Musculature of the juvenile
The hatchling possesses longitudinal (approx. 30), circular (approx. 60) and diagonal muscles (Figure 5C–E). The
bodywall musculature shows distinct patterns on the dorsal and ventral side, respectively. U-shaped muscles, with
the opening pointing towards the anterior side of the animal, are located on the ventral side around the mouth
(Figure 5C). On the ventral surface of the animal, a ventral
groove leads from the anterior region to the medially positioned mouth (Figure 5D). The mouth has a circular muscle surrounding its opening (Figure 5C, E). Accessory
muscles insert at the circular muscle of the mouth and run
into antero-lateral direction (Figure 5D, E). On the ventral
and dorsal side diagonal crossover muscles extend from
the lateral edges of the body and bend towards the midline, but mostly terminate before that (Figure 5). The dorsal diagonal muscles run along the entire body and bend
with an angle of approx. 35 degrees relative to the anterior-posterior axis. Posterior to the mouth opening the
ventral diagonal muscles bend towards the body midline
with an angle of about 55 degrees. Further posteriorly,
diagonal muscle fibres curve with an angle of 30 degrees
relative to the anterior-posterior axis (Figure 5C). The
juvenile already possesses a meshwork of dorsoventral
muscles (Figure 5D, F).

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/14

F-actin-positive, non-muscular filaments associated with
certain sensory cells are present outside the bodywall
musculature of juvenile stages still lacking sagittocysts
(Figure 5C, D). No specialized musculature in the region
of the future genital organs was observed. The number of
the distinct bodywall muscles increases with age until the
adult stage, while the overall myogenetic arrangement is
retained.
Adult myoanatomy
A network of inner longitudinal and outer circular muscles exists along the entire length of the adult body (Figure
6A, B). Adults have over 300 circular muscles and at least
140 longitudinal muscle fibres. On the outside of the circular muscles outer diagonal muscles are found on the
anterior dorsal side of the body. These cross the body midline at an angle of about 65 degrees relative to the anterior-posterior body axis (Figure 6A). Diagonal muscles
run from the lateral sides in postero-diagonal direction
towards the midline of the dorsal and ventral side, respectively. They cross the body midline at an angle of about
30–50 degrees relative to the anterior-posterior body axis.
The longitudinal muscles of the bodywall are positioned
underneath all other bodywall muscles (Figure 6A).

Symsagittifera roscoffensis exhibits extensive internal
(parenchymal) muscles (Figure 6D–F). Apart from the
regions close to the genital organs, the statocyst, and in
the anterior pole of the animal, dorsoventral muscles connect the ventral and dorsal side of the animal with each
other (Figure 6D, E). In the anterior region, parenchymal
muscles run from the lateral sides and the anterior tip in
horizontal direction to the centre, while others span in an
antero-posterior direction and fan in the anterior part of
the animal (Figure 6F). The muscles appear to insert at the
bodywall musculature (Figure 6D–F). The regular grid of
circular and longitudinal muscles is only disrupted by the
mouth opening (Figure 6C), as well as by the male and the
female genital pore. The mouth is situated at U16 sensu
[28] of the anterior-posterior body axis. In addition to the
sphincter surrounding the mouth, some longitudinal
muscles embrace the mouth opening at the lateral sides
and separate again posterior to the mouth opening. At the
posterior side of the mouth opening some longitudinal
muscle fibres emerge and extend in posterior direction
(Figure 6C).
The female genital pore lies in much closer proximity to
the male pore than to the mouth, namely at U70 of the
anterior-posterior body axis (Figure 7A, F). The bursal
nozzle (sometimes also referred to as "bursa mouthpiece"), which is composed of a sclerotized lamellate
stack of cells that form a sperm duct, contains intracellular
actin (Figure 7F). The male genital pore is situated almost
at the posterior end of the body at U90 of the anterior-

surrounded by circular muscles (Figure 7A, B, E, F). The
muscle grid around the male gonopore is not very regular,
since many sagittocyst openings are present in this region.
The paired "false seminal vesicles", where sperm masses
are accumulated, are situated anterior to the male gonopore and are surrounded by parenchymal muscles (Figure
7E).
The muscle mantles of the needle-shaped sagittocysts are
situated along the lateral edges and in the posterior region
of the body close to the male gonopore (Figure 7F–H). Factin-positive, non-muscular filaments of microvilli of
certain receptor cells are present outside the bodywall
along the entire length of the animal (Figure 6). Three of
these filaments slightly extend into the body of the animal
(Figure 6B, inset).

Discussion
Comparison of myogenesis of Isodiametra pulchra and
Symsagittifera roscoffensis
In the two species for which data on myogenesis are available so far, F-actin is only present in the zonulae adhaerentes of the cell walls until 50% (Isodiametra pulchra) or
40% (Symsagittifera roscoffensis) of development between
egg laying and hatching [27], present study. The signal in
the zonulae adhaerentes decreases gradually with further
development in I. pulchra [27]. Such a situation could not
be observed in S. roscoffensis.

Figure 4

Slightly later, short isolated circular muscles appear in the
embryo of Isodiametra pulchra, and four or five bands of
primary circular muscles encircle the embryo just after
50% of development. The circular muscle bands increase
to six to eight muscle bands, followed by single primary
longitudinal fibres. These longitudinal fibres emerge independently of each other together with additional circular
muscles [27]. In Symsagittifera roscoffensis, no such stage in
which only circular muscles are present was found. However, we cannot fully exclude the existence of such a stage
since such a phase may exist only for a very short ontogenetic period which might have escaped our – albeit tight
– developmental analysis.

After establishment of the stomodeum, longitudinal muscles posterior to the mouth bend towards the median
anterior-posterior axis in Symsagittifera roscoffensis and Isodiametra pulchra [27], present study. Circular mouth muscles are visible at stage 7 (88–100% between egg
deposition and hatching) in I. pulchra, whereas a sphincter around the mouth of S. roscoffensis already exists at
70% of development. Already with the presence of the
first fibre bands the area of the future mouth shows higher
concentration of irregularly arranged muscles than the
future dorsal side of S. roscoffensis.
Concerning the musculature, differentiation of the dorsal
and the ventral side in Isodiametra pulchra becomes visible
at stage 4 (60–63% of development) [27]. The orthogonal
muscle grid is more ordered on the ventral than on the
dorsal side in I. pulchra [27]. In Symsagittifera roscoffensis a
dorsal-ventral differentiation of the musculature can be
detected on the third day (about 60% of development).
The ventral side of S. roscoffensis features more irregularly
orientated fibres than in I. pulchra. The establishment of
the regular muscle grid in S. roscoffensis seems more
unsorted on the dorsal side than on the ventral side. The
first diagonal muscles in I. pulchra are established at stage
7 (88–100%), whereas in S. roscoffensis short diagonal
muscle fibres are already present on the third day (42%)
[27], present study.
Myogenesis in Isodiametra pulchra seems to follow a more
regular pattern in the anterior part than in the posterior
part of the body [27]. This is not the case in Symsagittifera
roscoffensis, where the muscle fibres develop simultaneously along the anterior-posterior body axis, but appear
more prominent in the anterior pole. In both S. roscoffensis and I. pulchra the musculature associated with the
future sexual organs develops after hatching. After formation of the primary circular muscle fibres, doublestranded secondary circular muscle fibres appear in Isodiametra pulchra, similar to the condition found in Symsagittifera roscoffensis [27], present study. Secondary muscles
arise in both acoels in similar ways: by branching off and
by creating double-stranded fibre zones, in which the new
muscles form adjacent to primary fibres.
Comparative analysis of the adult bodywall musculature in
Acoela
The general arrangement of the bodywall musculature in
Symsagittifera roscoffensis resembles that of most Acoela.
Longitudinal muscles are positioned underneath the circular and diagonal muscles of the bodywall. Only in Childiidae the orthogonal muscle grid consists of outer
longitudinal and inner circular muscles [21]. Whereas
most of the eight distinct acoel bodywall muscle patterns
hitherto described are based on a single or very few species
only, the so-called "convolutida"-type comprises seven

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/14

taxa, namely Actinoposthiidae, Convolutidae, Isodiametridae, Otocelididae, Anaperidae, Sagittiferidae, and
Haploposthiidae [12]. These "convolutida"-type acoels
together with the Mecynostomidae share the presence of
dorsal and ventral diagonal muscles, which both cross the
median anterior-posterior body axis [12]. Often, these
crossover muscles, which pass immediately behind the
mouth, form U-shaped muscles looping around the
mouth. Contrary to the "convolutida"-type acoels, the
Mecynostomidae possess additional ventral diagonal
muscles which are situated anterior to the mouth [12].
The ventral diagonal muscles of Isodiametra pulchra are
probably not homologous to those of other "convolutida"-type acoels, since the outer dorsal diagonal muscles
in I. pulchra wrap around the ventral side and form the
ventral diagonal muscles, which terminate just in front of
the ventral body midline [23,27]. The sagittiferid Convolutriloba longifissura lacks ventral diagonal muscles and
straight longitudinal muscles anterior to the mouth [24].
Instead, C. longifissura possesses roughly concentric fibres
around the mouth inside the funnel groove, while these
muscles are more eccentric with only the inner-most
being concentric in the sagittiferid Convolutriloba macropyga [24,26]. Apart from the sphincter muscle, S. roscoffensis does not show any concentric muscles around the
mouth. At the posterior end of the "convolutida"-type
acoels the majority of the straight longitudinal muscles
are "special pore muscles" sensu [12] that fan from the
posterior rim of the mouth and the anterior rim of the
gonopore [12]. In C. longifissura these muscles cover the
entire ventral side of the body, contrary to S. roscoffensis
and C. macropyga, in which most muscles that are positioned posterior the mouth do not fan [24], present study,
[26]. As in the sagittiferid species Antrosagittifera coralline
and Convolutriloba longifissura, S. roscoffensis exhibits only
a few U-shaped longitudinal fibres that flank the mouth
[12], present study.
The bodywall musculature of Acoela consists of a grid of
longitudinal and circular muscles. The existence of both
dorsal and ventral diagonal crossover muscles characterizes all acoel clades except Solenofilomorphidae,
Paratomellidae, Diopisthoporidae and some Childiidae
[10,21,30]. U-shaped muscles which loop around the
posterior region of the mouth are a shared character of
acoels and nemertodermatids, but lack in Solenofilomorphidae [10]. By contrast, accessory muscles associated
with the mouth opening and parenchymal muscles such
as dorsoventral muscles show great overall variety
throughout the various acoel clades. Accordingly, a final
statement whether or not these muscle sets were part of
the ancestral acoel bodyplan cannot yet be made. Comparative analysis of the detailed arrangement of the dorsoventral musculature, however, may yield new character

sets for future attempts to reconstruct acoel sistergroup
relationships.
Comparison of acoel inner (parenchymal) muscles
Terms such as "inner", "internal" and "parenchymal"
muscles are general expressions for muscles situated
inside the acoel bodywall musculature, e.g., dorsoventral
muscles, statocyst muscles and copulatory organ muscles.
Remarkably few studies have so far focused on the internal muscles, in contrast to the amount of studies which
characterize the acoel bodywall musculature. Childia
brachyposthium, C. macroposthium and C. groenlandica feature highly abundant internal muscles, whereas C. crassum
shows less numerous internal muscles, and C. cycloposthium, C. submaculatum and C. trianguliferum possess even
fewer and weaker internal muscles [21]. The predominant
inner muscles in the adult Isodiametra pulchra are parenchymal muscles that originate in the region of the statocyst and fan irregularly into posterior and lateral direction
[22]. Some fibres reach anteriorly to anchor at the anterior
tip of the bodywall musculature [22], while other fibres
extend posteriorly into the region of the genital organs
[23]. Praeconvoluta tornuva shows a dense aggregation of
parenchymal muscles in the region of the statocyst, from
where fibres extend posteriorly and laterally [31]. Parenchymal muscles were also detected in Otocelis sp. and
Mecynostomum sp., but they are not as prominently developed as in I. pulchra [22]. Adult I. pulchra exhibit three
dorsoventral muscles on each side of the body [22]. In
Mecynostomum sp. and Otocelis sp. the dorsoventral fibres
that are associated with the mouth and the ones anterior
to it are less developed than in I. pulchra [22]. Already at
stage 6 (73–87% of development) three pairs of dorsoventral muscles appear in the region of the mouth in I. pulchra and become more apparent closer to hatching [27].
Symsagittifera roscoffensis possesses dorsoventral muscles
almost along the entire anterior-posterior body axis, apart
from the region of the statocyst, the genital tracts, and the
anterior tip of the animal. As in I. pulchra, the inner muscles of S. roscoffensis appear to insert either at other inner
muscles or at the bodywall musculature [23], present
study.

In general, none of the acoel species studied so far exhibits
such en elaborated internal musculature, which is best
illustrated by its complex arrangement of dorsoventral
muscles, as does Symsagittifera roscoffensis. However, S.
roscoffensis lacks internal longitudinal muscles altogether,
which in turn are present in, e.g., the mecynostomid species Paedomecynostomum bruneum and the isodiametrid
species Pseudoaphanostoma sp., Isodiametra pulchra and
Praeconvoluta tornuva.
Statocyst muscles
Statocyst muscles have been described for many acoel species [17,18]. They were originally thought to be involved
in sensory-transduction mechanisms [32], but more
recent data suggest that the fibres merely anchor at the statocyst [23]. As a member of the supposedly most basal
taxon of the Acoela [33], Paratomella sp. exhibits only a
few weak parenchymal fibres that anchor in the region of
the statocyst [22]. Within the taxon Childia the muscles
associated with the statocyst are very variable. While only
weakly stained statocyst muscles are present in Childia
cycloposthium and C. trianguliferum [21], these muscles,
which connect the statocyst to the bodywall, exhibit a starshaped pattern in C. crassum and C. submaculatum and a
ladder-like grid in C. brachyposthium and C. macroposthium.
C. groenlandica displays an intermediate state in which the
ventral part of the statocyst shows a star-like arrangement,
while the dorsal part is ladder-like shaped. The mecynostomid Paedomecynostomum bruneum comprises paired
parenchymal muscle strands anchoring at the statocyst, of
which one paired muscle extends longitudinally, while
the second, shorter paired muscle extends laterally to
insert at the lateral bodywall [22]. Similar to the isodiametrid Otocelis sp., the mecynostomid Mecynostomum sp.
only shows a few prominent fibres in the region of the statocyst which reach posteriorly and laterally into the posterior body half [22]. In the isodiametrid Pseudaphanostoma
sp. parenchymal fibres originate in the anterior region of
the statocyst, cross each other, and arch posteriorly to converge at the posterior end of the animal, contrary to the
isodiametrid I. pulchra, in which the strongest of the fairly
short longitudinally orientated statocyst muscles cross

each other anterior and posterior to the statocyst [22,23].
Surprisingly, in Symsagittifera roscoffensis the extensive
internal musculature does not reveal any specific muscles
associated with the statocyst. In contrast to that, species
with certain statocyst muscles do not show dorsoventral
muscles as elaborated as in S. roscoffensis. However, the
two Paraphanostoma species, which lack any specific pattern of statocyst muscles, neither show numerous internal
muscles [21]. The arrangement of the musculature associated with the statocyst is very plastic within the various
acoel clades, even in closely related taxa such as representatives of Childiidae, and appears therefore unsuitable to
resolve higher-taxon relationships.
Copulatory organ muscles
Pores in Acoela are by no means simple structures, but
have, in general, specific associated muscle systems [34].
The musculature associated with the male copulatory
organ is very complex in both Isodiametra pulchra and Symsagittifera roscoffensis [23], present study. A strong fluorescence signal is also found in the bursal nozzle, which is
due to compact sets of actin filaments in the cells that
form the tubiform sperm duct in these two species [23],
present study. The copulatory musculature of the anaperid
Anaperus singularis mainly consists of a loose arrangement
of muscles surrounding the penis, while the penis of the
isodiametrid Isodiametra earnhardti possesses outer longitudinal and inner circular muscle fibres [30]. Childiid species possess radial muscles, seminal vesicle ring muscles,
"tentacle muscles" sensu [21] of the seminal vesicle and
inner muscles connecting the base of the stylet with the
seminal vesicle wall, whereas in Childia groenlandica only
a sphincter muscle and inner muscles are present [21,35].
In Sagittiferidae, muscle fibres associated with the male
copulatory organs are irregularly arranged, since the male
sac-like antrum lacks seminal vesicles [16]. Therefore, the
muscles which surround the antrum in S. roscoffensis form
so-called "false seminal vesicles".
Acoel sagittocysts and receptor cells
Unique to fifteen acoel species, which are combined in the
taxon Sagittiferidae sensu [36], sagittocysts are needleshaped secretory products of sagittocytes, glands which
are often surrounded by a muscle mantle around the distal neck [36-38]. Originally, sagittocysts had only been
found on the ventral side of the body, particularly in the
proximity of the genital pores [15,39-42]. In Convolutriloba longifissura, sagittocysts are especially numerous
along a sickle-shaped band on the antero-ventral margin
and along the posterior margin of the body [37]. In Symsagittifera roscoffensis, sagittocysts are mainly found in the
region posterior to the male gonopore and along the lateral edges of the animal. Contrary to those of S. roscoffensis, the peg-like structures along the lateral edges of
Isodiametra pulchra are non-muscular filaments of sensory

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/14

cells, which are located outside the bodywall musculature
[43]. Close to the neck of the sagittocyts, fibres of small
monociliated sensory receptors are found in C. longifissura
[37]. The adjacent sensory cell can be considered an integral part of the extrusion apparatus [38]. These sensory
cells are devoid of any extensive rootlets and are therefore
hard to detect with phalloidin staining, contrary to the socalled "swallow's nest receptors", in which a filament-rich
ring of microvilli surrounds the sensory cilia and two or
three of these microvilli filaments are associated with the
rootlet [43,44]. The sensory cilia are mainly present in the
anterior and posterior quarter of the body in Symsagittifera
corsicae [38]. S. roscoffensis and I. pulchra exhibit non-muscular filaments of sensory cells in the anterior and posterior region, and in lower number over the entire body
surface [43]. No sagittocysts are present in sexually immature C. longifissura [37]. Likewise, no muscle mantles of
sagittocysts were found in S. roscoffensis juveniles. However, non-muscular filaments of sensory receptor cells,
which are possibly associated with yet immature sagittocysts, are present at that stage.
The position of the sagittocysts in the posterior tip and
close to the male gonopore suggests a role in reproductive
behaviour [39,42], while sagittocysts in a rostral position
might play a role in prey capture, and those along the dorsal body axis in defence [37].
Can muscle patterns resolve the internal phylogeny of
Acoela?
Although it has recently been shown that morphological
characters such as the arrangement of microtubules and
axonemes in sperm cells as well as the architecture of the
adult musculature are potentially useful characters for
phylogenetic analyses [10], only few muscular characters
are as of yet available to resolve "convolutida"-muscle
type species interrelationships. Based on molecular phylogenetic analysis, the "convolutida"-muscle type taxa
Convolutidae, Sagittiferidae, as well as the Haploposthiidae appeared all to be polyphyletic, and the interrelationships of these respective assemblages likewise remained
unresolved [10]. Furthermore, 18S rDNA analysis reveals
that Convolutidae sensu [11], comprising more than one
third of all acoel species, cluster in two separate groups
[10]. Subsequent morphological analysis revealed that all
convolutid species, which possess isodiametric penises
with separated longitudinal muscles, cluster separately
from the other convolutid species, which instead have
penises with longitudinal interwoven or intercrossed
muscle fibres [14]. The former assemblage was thus
united in the Isodiametridae [14], demonstrating the
potential usefulness of features of the muscular bodyplan
for phylogenetic inferences.

Conclusion
Compared to recent data on the myoanatomy of other
acoel taxa, Symsagittifera roscoffensis shows a highly elaborated myoanatomy. However, additional data especially
on the basal taxa Paratomellidae, Solenofilomorphidae
and Hofsteniidae are necessary in order to make a final
statement about the degree of muscular complexity and
the exact muscular ground pattern of Acoela. Nevertheless, the present data available on acoel myogenesis and
adult myoanatomy suggest a considerably elaborated
musculature with at least longitudinal, circular and Ushaped muscles as being part of the ancient acoel muscular bodyplan. Given the proposed basal position of Acoela
within Bilateria, this increases the probability of a relatively complex muscular bodyplan of the last common
ancestor of all bilaterian animals.
