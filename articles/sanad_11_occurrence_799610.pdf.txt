(iam) in Campylobacter jejuni isolated from cattle

Abstract
Background: The invasion associated marker (iam) has been detected in the majority of invasive Campylobacter
jejuni retrieved from humans. Furthermore, the detection of iam in C. jejuni isolated from two important hosts,
humans and chickens, suggested a role for this marker in C. jejuni’s colonization of multiple hosts. However, no
data exist regarding the occurrence of this marker in C. jejuni isolated from non-poultry food-animals such as cattle,
an increasingly important source for human infections. Since little is known about the genetics associated with
C. jejuni’s capability for colonizing physiologically disparate hosts, we investigated the occurrence of the iam in
C. jejuni isolated from cattle and assessed the potential of iam-containing cattle and human isolates for chicken
colonization and human cell invasion.
Results: Simultaneous RAPD typing and iam-specific PCR analysis of 129 C. jejuni isolated from 1171 cattle fecal
samples showed that 8 (6.2%) of the isolates were iam-positive, while 7 (54%) of human-associated isolates were
iam-positive. The iam sequences were mostly heterogeneous and occurred in diverse genetic backgrounds. All
iam-positive isolates were motile and possessed important genes (cadF, ciaB, cdtB) associated with adhesion and
virulence. Although certain iam-containing isolates invaded and survived in INT-407 cells in high numbers and
successfully colonized live chickens, there was no clear association between the occurrence, allelic sequence, and
expression levels of the iam and the aforementioned phenotypes.
Conclusions: We show that the prevalence of iam in cattle C. jejuni is relatively lower as compared to isolates
occurring in humans and chickens. In addition, iam was polymorphic and certain alleles occur in cattle isolates that
were capable of colonizing and invading chickens and human intestinal cells, respectively. However, the iam did
not appear to contribute to the cattle-associated C. jejuni’s potential for invasion and intracellular survival in human
intestinal cells as well as chicken colonization.

Background
Campylobacter jejuni is an important foodborne pathogen that can cause a variety of infections in humans [1].
Additionally, C. jejuni colonizes important food-animals
such as chicken and cattle, which together constitute an
important source for human infections with this pathogen [2]. Although C. jejuni can occur in multiple hosts,
it is more readily transmissible within species [3]. Once
established in a new host, C. jejuni has a remarkable

capacity for acquiring genetic material that facilitates
adaptation to the host environment [3]. Efficient host
colonization can be essential in pathogenesis mechanisms, including host cell invasion and associated sequelae [4]. Furthermore, numerous studies, using live
chicken models and in vitro human cell lines, have suggested multiple genetic determinates that are important
in C. jejuni’s host colonization [4,5]. However, little is
known about genetic factors that might be important
for C. jejuni’s adaptation to multiple hosts, which is
important since the broad host range of C. jejuni complicates on-farm control measures aimed at decreasing
its transmission to humans.
An important factor in C. jejuni’s host colonization is
its capability to attach to- and/or invade epithelial cells in

the host’s gastrointestinal tract [6]. Yet, different strains
of C. jejuni display varying capacities for cellular adherence and invasion, which could be attributed to the presence, absence and/or acquisition of certain genetic
determinants that contribute to the pathobiology of this
bacterium [7,8]. Although invasion and host adaptation
are influenced by the interaction of multiple genetic factors, several individual components, including outermembrane proteins and secreted antigens can impact C.
jejuni’s adherence to and invasion of enterocytes [7,9,10].
Of particular interest is the invasion associated marker
(iam) that was significantly associated with invasive Campylobacter [11]. This marker was discovered using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis that
identified a diagnostic DNA band (1.6 Kb) containing a
genetic element (designated later as iam). Although specific PCR analysis showed that the iam was observed in
63% of the invasive isolates retrieved from diarrheic children, the marker was not detected in every potentially
invasive isolate and occured in a low percentage of the
non-invasive ones. Consequently, it was concluded that
mutations/allele variations might have impacted both the
detection of the marker and its role in mediating the
invasion [11]. However, these assumptions were not
tested further and the role of iam in C. jejuni’s invasion
and adaptation to hosts, whether humans or animals, has
not been fully investigated. The limited data available
suggest that the occurrence of the iam in C. jejuni might
be both dependent on the characteristics of the human
population understudy and associated sources of infection [12,13]. The latter is important since the majority of
Campylobacter isolated from chicken carcasses, an established source for Campylobacter infections, also possessed the iam [13,14], which suggests that the iam
might play a role in the transmission of Campylobacter
and/or its adaptation to different host(s). Since no data
are available concerning the occurrence of iam in C.
jejuni isolated from other hosts, the aforementioned conclusion regarding the iam association with multiple-host
colonization needs further analysis. Consequently, it was
important to investigate the occurrence of iam in C.
jejuni from other important sources such as cattle
[15-17] and test their potential for colonization of
humans and chickens, respectively. If iam is associated
with C. jejuni’s potential for colonization of multiple
hosts, this would facilitate understanding the interactive
impact of major animal sources such as chicken and cattle in the transmission of Campylobacter. Therefore, we
investigated the occurrence of the iam in C. jejuni isolated from cattle (n = 1171) and determined the association of this element and its alleles with the pathogen’s
invasion potential of a human intestinal cell line and
colonization of 1-day old chickens.

Methods
Isolation of Campylobacter jejuni from cattle and human
samples

Fecal samples (n = 1171) were collected from cattle at 4
geographic locations (North, Mid-West, East, South)
across the U.S. To isolate C. jejuni, 1 g of each fecal
sample was enriched in Preston broth for 48 h at 42°C
under microaerobic conditions (5% O2, 10% CO2, and
85% N2). From the enrichments that showed growth, an
inoculum (100 μl) was spread onto modified Cefoperazone Charcoal Deoxycholate Agar (mCCDA) plates,
which were then incubated for an additional 48 h at 42°
C under microaerobic conditions [18]. Colonies exhibiting typical Campylobacter phenotype (flat and grey with
metallic sheen) were selected from the plates and subjected to species-specific PCR analysis to confirm their
identity [19,20]. The size of the PCR products was
determined using a 1 Kb DNA ladder and detection was
confirmed by comparison to a PCR product generated
from a C. jejuni 81-176 (wild-type strain), which was
used as a positive control in all PCR analysis. Negative
controls (reactions with no DNA templates) were
included in all PCR analysis to ensure specific product
amplification.
Additional C. jejuni isolates from human hosts were
acquired from a medical center (The Ohio State University). These isolates represented different sporadic
human infections and their identity was further confirmed using the aforementioned PCR analysis.
Detection of iam using RAPD typing and PCR

To determine if the C. jejuni originating from cattle and
human samples carried the iam locus (a diagnostic 1.6
Kb band), all isolates were subjected to DNA fingerprinting using RAPD analysis as described in Carvalho
et al. [11]. RAPD-PCR products were then analyzed
using 1.4% agarose gels, containing 0.5 μg/ml of ethidium bromide. RAPD fingerprints were documented
and dendrograms were constructed using BioNumerics
5.1 software (Applied Maths, Inc, USA).
C. jejuni isolates that carried the iam locus as identified by the RAPD fingerprinting were tested to further
confirm the presence of the iam locus. This was
achieved using PCR analysis to detect a 518-bp DNA
fragment inside the 1.6 kb band that was earlier identified as the iam locus by RAPD fingerprinting as
described in Carvalho et al. [11].
Detection of virulence-associated genes using PCR

C. jejuni isolates that were identified as iam-positive
using both RAPD and iam-specific PCR analysis, hereafter referred to as the iam-positive C. jejuni, were
screened for genes that are important in the

Sanad et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:570
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/570

pathobiology of this pathogen. Specifically, PCR analysis
was performed for the detection of the cadF (Campylobacter adherence factor), ciaB (Campylobacter invasion
antigens), and cdtB (cytolethal distending toxin) genes
as described elsewhere [10,21,22]. Genomic DNA from
C. jejuni strain 81-176 was used as a positive control,
while negative controls contained the PCR reagent mix
with no DNA templates.
Motility assay

To establish that iam-positive C. jejuni were putatively
capable of host invasion and colonization, it was important to establish that the isolates were not defective in
motility. For this purpose, the motility of the iam-positive C. jejuni was tested using semi-solid (0.4%) Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plates as described previously
[23]. The diameter of the zone of motility was measured
and compared to that of C. jejuni 81-176 (positive control). The motility assays were repeated twice for each
isolate, which were also tested in duplicates per each
assay.
In vitro cell invasion and intracellular survival assay using
human epithelial cell lines (INT-407)

The human intestinal cell invasion assays were performed using iam-negative and iam-positive C. jejuni
isolated from both cattle and humans. For this purpose,
105 cells ml-1 of INT-407 (human embryonic intestine,
ATCC CCL 6) were seeded into each well of a 24-well
tissue culture plates in Minimum Essential Medium
Eagle (MEM, Fisher scientific, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Fisher scientific, PA,
USA). The plates were then incubated at 37°C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2 until semi-confluent
mono-layers were obtained [24,25]. For infection with C.
jejuni, the INT-407 mono-layers were washed three
times and covered in MEM supplemented with 1% FBS.
Similarly, the C. jejuni cultures were washed three times
and suspended in MEM supplemented with 1% FBS to
obtain 107 bacteria ml-1. One ml of bacterial suspension
was added to each well containing the INT-407 semiconfluent monolayer, achieving a 1:100 multiplicity of
infection (MOI). After 3 h of incubation, cells were treated with gentamicin (150 μg ml-1) for 2 h to inhibit the
bacteria that did not invade the cells. The infected
mono-layers were washed with 1× PBS, lysed using
0.01% Triton X-100 and serially diluted (10-fold) in 1×
PBS. One hundred μl of each dilution were spread on
MH agar plates. The agar plates were then incubated
for 48 h at 42°C under microaerobic conditions, after
which colony forming units (CFU) were counted. Each
isolate was tested in duplicate per assay, while the
experiment was repeated twice on separate occasions. C.
jejuni 81-176 and NCTC11168 were used as controls in

Page 3 of 10

all invasion assays. A negative control that consisted of
a well containing only INT-407 with no bacteria was
processed in parallel to the infected monolayers.
For the intracellular survival assays [26], Campylobacter cultures and the INT-407 cells were processed as
described above. However, after treatment with gentamicin, the monolayers were covered with MEM containing
1% FBS and gentamicin (10 μg ml-1) and incubated for
additional 24 h at 37°C. Then the monolayers were
washed three times with MEM containing 1% FBS, lysed
and processed as described above. The number of viable
intracellular bacteria was determined by counting CFUs.
Phylogenetic analysis of the iam alleles

To determine if the iam sequences were heterogeneous
and examine relationships between the iam occurring in
cattle C. jejuni isolates and those from human samples,
the 518 bp iam fragments were sequenced and subjected
to a phylogenetic analysis. Briefly, iam-specific PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) and commercially sequenced
(Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center, OARDC, OH,
USA). The identity of the sequences was confirmed by
BLAST analysis. The sequences were then exported to
MEGA4 software [27], aligned and analyzed. The phylogenetic tree was drawn using the Neighbor-Joining
method to determine the evolutionary relationship
among the sequences. The iam sequences that were
analyzed in this work were deposited in GenBank under
accession numbers: HM533957-HM533968, JF927289JF927291 and HQ317917.
Expression analysis for the iam using quantitative realtime PCR (q-RT PCR)

Quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was used to
investigate an association between the expression of iam
and the phenotypes of the cattle-associated C. jejuni.
The q-RT PCR primers (Table 1) targeted iam conserved sequences, which were determined by multiple
alignment of the iam alleles using ClustalW2 (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/). In order to ensure
the detection of expression of different alleles, two sets
of q-RT PCR primers were designed to target different
fragments of the iam using Beacon Designer 7.0 software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA). A
third set of q-RT PCR primers (Table 1) was specifically
constructed to target the iam of the hyper-invasive C.
jejuni 81-176. Total RNA was extracted (RNeasy Mini
kit, Qiagen) from the iam-containing strains and two
iam-negative strains, which were included as controls.
Subsequently, cDNA was synthesized (SuperScript III
First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix, Invitrogen) and used
for q-RT PCR (SensiMixPlus SYBR RT-PCR kit, Quantance) in a Mastercycler ep realplex 2 thermal cycler

This study

To determine the relatedness and diversity of genomic
backgrounds of iam-positive C. jejuni, these isolates
from cattle and human samples were analyzed using
PFGE as described by Ribot et al. [28]. The resulting
PFGE patterns were documented and analyzed using the
BioNumerics 5.1 software (Applied Maths Inc, TX,
USA). Similarity and clustering analysis of the PFGE
patterns were performed using the Dice Coefficient and
the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic
averages, UPGMA (optimization of 1% and position tolerance of 1.5%), respectively.

versus those from cattle. Subsequently, C. jejuni isolates
were suspended in MH broth to achieve an OD 600 of
0.04 and individual chickens in each group were inoculated orally with 200 μl of the suspensions (~2 × 10 5
CFU), respectively. Seven days post-inoculation, the
chickens were euthanized and the caeca were aseptically
collected, weighed, and homogenized in 1X PBS (pH
7.4). The caecal extracts were serially diluted (10-fold)
and 100 μl from each dilution were spread onto MH
agar plates supplemented with SR117E (Oxoid, KS,
USA), a Campylobacter selective supplement. The plates
were then incubated at 42°C under microaerobic conditions for 48 h and the number of CFU/g of caecal contents was calculated to determine the colonization
capability of the C. jejuni isolates. The chickens were
cared for according to the guidelines of the Association
for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care (AAALAC).

In vivo chicken colonization assay

Statistical analysis

iam-positive C. jejuni were selected for in vivo chicken
colonization assays based on iam-sequence type and the
iam expression profile. Subsequently, Bov-6 was selected
to represent Bov-9, Bov-10, and 11 (Figure 1), while
Bov-9 was excluded because it did not express the iam
product. One day-old chicken (specific pathogen free)
were divided into groups, each containing seven birds.
Before the experimental infection, the chickens were
confirmed to be Campylobacter free by testing cloacal
samples collected from each individual. Groups were
divided to simultaneously test iam-positive isolates versus iam-negative ones and isolates from human hosts

Data were presented as means ± standard error (SE) and
assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed
by Tukey’s significance test. A P value of < 0.05 was
used to indicate if differences were statistically
significant.

(Eppendorf). The q-RT PCR analysis was repeated three
times with two replicates in each assay and threshold
cycle (CT) values for each sample were then averaged to
represent the expression levels of the iam.
Typing of iam- positive C. jejuni using pulsed field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE)

Results and discussion
A total of 129 C. jejuni were isolated from fecal samples
(n = 1171) collected from cattle in 4 geographic locations (North, South, Midwest, East) in the U.S. Additionally, 13 C. jejuni isolates were acquired from
different sporadic human infections. The identity of the

typed using PFGE. Numbers on the nodes represent the Cophenetic correlations. Virulence genes detected by PCR in iam-positive C. jejuni were
included for adjacent to the corresponding PFGE profile.

C. jejuni isolates was confirmed using PCR. RAPD analysis was performed as described by Carvalho et al. [11]
and showed that 10.8% of the cattle isolates possessed
the 1.6 Kb DNA band that potentially harbors iam as
compared to 54% of the human isolates. Furthermore,
iam-specific PCR [11] showed that 6.8% of the cattle
isolates were iam-positive as compared to 54% of the
human isolates. Randomly selected isolates that did not
show the 1.6 Kb band after RAPD analysis were also
observed to be iam-negative using iam-specific PCR
analysis. The discrepancy between the RAPD and the
PCR results for the cattle isolates was not surprising
since, as suggested by Carvalho et al. [11], the PCR primers might not necessarily detect iam mutated fragments/alleles. Additionally, mutations might spuriously
give rise to a 1.6 Kb band that can be mistaken for the
iam locus. Therefore, in order to limit iam false-positives that might be detected using either method, we
selected isolates that possessed both the 1.6 Kb fragment
and the iam-PCR product, referred to as iam-positive
strains, for further analysis.
The iam-positive cattle isolates and 2 iam-positive
human isolates (H-5, H-7) were assessed for their capability to invade and survive in human intestinal cells
(INT-407) [5,29]. Two iam-negative cattle isolates (Bov1, Bov-5) and 2 iam-negative human isolates (H-1, H-4)
were used for comparison. Although all the iam-positive
strains were motile on semi-solid Mueller-Hinton
agar (data not shown), our results show that 5 (Bov-2, 3,
6, 7, and 10) of the iam-positive cattle isolates invaded

INT-407 with numbers higher than those of C. jejuni
NCTC11168. Additionally, two isolates (Bov-7 and Bov10) were also more invasive as compared to the C. jejuni
81-176, a highly invasive strain (Figure 2A). Furthermore, 4 of the iam-positive cattle isolates (Bov-2, 3, 6,
and 7) exhibited either equivalent or higher capacity for
intracellular survival in INT-407 as compared to C.
jejuni 81-176 (Figure 2B). In contrast, independent of
the occurrence of the iam, all tested human isolates
exhibited significantly decreased capacity for invasion
and intracellular survival in the INT-407 cell line as
compared to C. jejuni 81-176 (Figure 2A and 2B). Consequently, the occurrence of the iam in the cattle and
human isolates did not seem to confer any clear advantage in terms of invasiveness and the intracellular survival potential in the human cell line. However, since the
iam was previously detected in 16% of non-invasive
Campylobacter [11], Carvalho et al. [11] speculated that
the non-invasive strains might carry a mutated variant
of this marker and that different iam alleles might result
in discrepancies in the invasion potential of disparate C.
jejuni strains. This is plausible since allelic variations in
other targets were also suggested to impact the virulence of different strains [7,30].
Genomic analysis of the iam sequence deposited by
Carvalho et al. [11] showed that the iam encodes an
ABC transporter (Table 2). This is important since
potential virulence factors, including surface structures
such as transporters, are predicted to harbor much of
the genetic diversity that characterize disparate C. jejuni

highlights the polymorphism of this marker. To further
examine the extent of sequence polymorphism in the
iam occurring in cattle C. jejuni isolates, we sequenced

The sequence reported by Carvalho et al. [11] was used for query. Cds stands for coding sequence. *JL11 is a cattle isolate that was sequenced in Dr. Lin’s
laboratory; its sequence and complete annotations have not been submitted to Genbank, yet [31]. However, the iam homolog in JL11 was deposited in Genbank
[Genbank: HQ317917]. NA: Not available

and 12) shared the same iam sequence type, while the
other iam sequences from cattle and humans were heterogeneous, clustering in groups that mostly contained
iam-isolates from both hosts (Figure 3A). Interestingly,
the cattle isolates with identical iam sequences (Bov-6,
10, 11 and 12), did not exhibit similar invasion and
intracellular survival properties in INT-407 cells (Figure
2A and 2B), which suggested that there were no clear
associations between an iam sequence type and the
aforementioned phenotypes. Furthermore, the iam also
did not appear to affect the invasion and intracellular
survival potential in the tested human strains, as both
iam-positive and iam-negative isolates showed similar
properties, respectively.
It is possible that the presence of iam gene
sequences might not be necessarily associated with the
expression of its products, which might explain the
lack of an apparent relationship between iam and invasiveness. Therefore, the expression of the iam was
assayed for the cattle isolates using q-RT PCR, which
showed that the expression levels of the iam varied
between the strains (Figure 3B). Bov-3 and Bov-6 with
low iam expression levels and Bov-9 with no detectable expression were still capable of invading and surviving in INT-407 cells (Figure 2A and 2B). Although
isolates (Bov-7 and Bov-10) with iam expression similar to that of C. jejuni 81-176 exhibited high invasion
and intracellular survival potential, isolates with relatively the highest iam expression (Bov-11 and 12) did
not possess the highest capacities for the aforementioned phenotypes. Since iam expression properties in
the tested isolates were consistent using two sets of qRT PCR primers (data not shown), it was concluded
that the expression of iam did not seem to confer any
clear advantage in terms of invasion and intracellular
survival.

The virulence traits of C. jejuni might likely be
affected by the interaction of several genetic elements
[9,10,30]. Hence, the role of the iam in the pathobiology
of C. jejuni, if any, would likely depend on other factors
(e.g. flagella, adhesins), which in turn might need to
occur in specific allelic sequences to mediate their
impact. It was interesting to note that the pulsed field
gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the genotypes
of the iam-positive strains were mostly diverse (Figure
1). This indicated that the iam is occurring in diverse
genotypic backgrounds that, along with the iam
sequence heterogeneity, might impact the role of this
locus in the pathobiology of C. jejuni. Subsequently, it
was important to investigate whether the iam-containing
isolates harbored genes that are commonly associated
with C. jejuni adherence and virulence in order to
ensure that our observations can be attributed to iam
and not other genetic defects. Subsequently, PCR analysis showed that the iam-containing isolates carried the
cadF, ciaB, and cdtA genes (Figure 1) that are important
for C. jejuni pathogenesis [9,10,12]. Since many of the
tested isolates were not defective in invasion of INT-407
cells, PCR detection of the aforementioned virulence
genes was satisfactory to further confirm that the iamcontaining isolates did not appear to be deficient in
genes that might be important for attachment and invasion of INT-407 cells.
We examined if there was a potential impact for the
iam in C. jejuni’s colonization of chickens. Out of 5
iam-containing cattle isolates tested, only one (Bov-2)
colonized the chickens with numbers that were significantly higher than those of the iam-negative strains
(Figure 4). Bov-7 that exhibited relatively high expression of the iam was not detected in the chickens (Figure
4). Selected human isolates colonized the chickens in
similar numbers, regardless of the presence or absence

Figure 3 The evolutionary relationship between iam sequences and the expression profiles of the iam locus in cattle- and human
isolates. A. The evolutionary relationship between iam sequences detected in C. jejuni isolated from human and cattle samples. The tree was
drawn to scale using the Neighbor-Joining method. The percentage of replicate trees in which the iam sequences clustered together in the
bootstrap test (10000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The evolutionary distances are in the units of the number of base substitutions
per site. B. Expression of iam as determined using qRT-PCR analysis. Bov-1 is an iam-negative strain. Wildtype strains (C. jejuni 81-176 and
NCTC11168) that harbor the iam were also included for comparison with iam-containing cattle isolates. The data represented was collected
using the primer set iam1; however, set iam2 resulted in similar results (data not shown). Expression in iam-negative strains was not detectable
even after 35 cycles of amplification.

Figure 4 Chicken colonization with C. jejuni isolated from cattle and human hosts. Results were represented as means of CFU g-1 of
caecum retrieved from at least six chicks per isolate tested. Bov-1, Bov-5, H-1, and H-4 are iam-negative C. jejuni used for comparison with iamcontaining isolates. C. jejuni 81-176 and NCTC11168 were used as controls. Data were log transformed and presented as mean ± SE (standard
error).

of iam. Therefore, the occurrence and expression of iam
apparently did not contribute to the chicken colonization potential of C. jejuni.

Conclusions
Carvalho et al. [11] only correlated the occurrence of the
iam in a certain number of invasive C. jejuni using typing
techniques, while acknowledging the existence of the
marker in a relatively smaller percentage of non-invasive
strains. Our analysis was more rigorous and included
attempts to associate the iam with several important phenotypes. We report that the iam does not necessarily
contribute to invasion and survival in human intestinal
cells or colonization of chickens. Subsequently, the use of
the iam as a virulence determinant in epidemiological
studies (e.g. references 11-14) might be potentially misleading and might require reevaluation. However, it must
be noted that despite our extensive sampling efforts, only
a limited number of iam-containing C. jejuni were isolated in this study. This small number of isolates tested
in this study necessitates a cautious interpretation of the
data regarding the contribution of iam to invasive

properties of C. jejuni. This can be clarified using alternative approaches such as testing deletion mutants of this
marker in future experiments.
