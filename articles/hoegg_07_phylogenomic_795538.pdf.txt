Abstract
Background: Gene clusters are of interest for the understanding of genome evolution since they
provide insight in large-scale duplications events as well as patterns of individual gene losses.
Vertebrates tend to have multiple copies of gene clusters that typically are only single clusters or
are not present at all in genomes of invertebrates. We investigated the genomic architecture and
conserved non-coding sequences of vertebrate KCNA gene clusters. KCNA genes encode shakerrelated voltage-gated potassium channels and are arranged in two three-gene clusters in tetrapods.
Teleost fish are found to possess four clusters. The two tetrapod KNCA clusters are of
approximately the same age as the Hox gene clusters that arose through duplications early in
vertebrate evolution. For some genes, their conserved retention and arrangement in clusters are
thought to be related to regulatory elements in the intergenic regions, which might prevent
rearrangements and gene loss. Interestingly, this hypothesis does not appear to apply to the KCNA
clusters, as too few conserved putative regulatory elements are retained.
Results: We obtained KCNA coding sequences from basal ray-finned fishes (sturgeon, gar, bowfin)
and confirmed that the duplication of these genes is specific to teleosts and therefore consistent
with the fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD). Phylogenetic analyses of the genes suggest a basal
position of the only intron containing KCNA gene in vertebrates (KCNA7). Sistergroup relationships
of KCNA1/2 and KCNA3/6 support that a large-scale duplication gave rise to the two clusters found
in the genome of tetrapods. We analyzed the intergenic regions of KCNA clusters in vertebrates
and found that there are only a few conserved sequences shared between tetrapods and teleosts
or between paralogous clusters. The orthologous teleost clusters, however, show sequence
conservation in these regions.
Conclusion: The lack of overall conserved sequences in intergenic regions suggests that there are
either other processes than regulatory evolution leading to cluster conservation or that the
ancestral regulatory relationships among genes in KCNA clusters have been changed together with
their regulatory sites.

Background
Higher phenotypic complexity of vertebrates has been
often associated with a higher number of genes produced

through whole genome duplications [1]. Genome
projects and a deluge of sequence data showed that vertebrates often possess more than one copy of a gene or gene

clusters [2-5] where invertebrates have only one. This
observation together with synteny data, led to the formulation of the 2R hypothesis, which proposes two rounds
of genome duplication in early vertebrate evolution [6-9].
An additional duplication event occurred in the lineage of
ray-finned fish, the so-called fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD, 3R) [10-17]. While the duplicated genes are
expected to be redundant in their function immediately
following the duplication, their functions often diversify
later [18,19]. Possible scenarios are that one copy evolves
a new function (neofunctionalization) or the ancestral
functions get subdivided between the paralogs (subfunctionalization) [20,21]. In most cases, however, one copy
is expected to accumulate mutations that lead to a nonfunctional gene and finally to gene loss [20-23].
Clusters of genes belonging to the same gene family can
give important insights into the evolutionary history of a
genomic region, both in terms of gene loss events as well
as for the evolution of the regulatory sequences surrounding it. The most prominent examples for this type of
approach are the Hox gene clusters [24-28], a family of
transcription factors that are not only arranged in uninterrupted clusters on the chromosome but are even
expressed during embryogenesis according to their chromosomal order – a phenomenon called colinearity
[reviewed in [29]. But also other gene clusters have been
studied in this regard such as the ParaHox cluster
[30](Siegel et al. submitted) and Fox clusters [31]. Both
belong to other families of transcription factors with multiple cluster copies in vertebrate genomes. Less research in
this respect has been performed on non-developmental
genes.
We were interested if the patterns of molecular evolution
that are found in Hox clusters can also be identified in
other gene clusters and if it is also possible to identify conserved non-coding regions in them. KCNA genes are
arranged in two uninterrupted clusters of three genes each
which are located on chromosomes three and six in
mouse and on chromosomes one and twelve in humans
[32,33]. KCNA genes code for the Kv1 family of shakerrelated voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels, those consist of six transmembrane (TM) segments and, the most
important part, the pore loop (P-region), which ensures
ion selectivity [34,35]. The Kv channels are active as
tetramers, usually heterotetramers. Sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) channels, on the other hand, are monomers
that consist of four linked domains, each of which is
homologous to a single 6-TM K+ channel [36]. Studies on
the genomic organization of these genes so far have been
limited to mammals. Upstream regulatory factors and
potential regulatory elements have not been described
previously. The number of KCNA genes and their genomic
arrangement in ray-finned fish has not been studied

before. Here we extend these comparative genomic
approaches to other lineages of vertebrates and compare
them to the situation in the genome of invertebrates.
We conducted an analysis of complete genome sequences
of tetrapods and ray-finned fish KCNA genes and investigated the entire genome content when possible. In an
effort to increase the database on basal fish, for which
such data were not available prior to this study, we added
new data using a PCR approach with universal primers
and cloned the PCR products. We also included data from
the non-vertebrate chordates Branchiostoma floridae and
Ciona intestinalis for a better estimate of the age of this
gene family. We constructed gene trees to permit inferences about the timing of the gene duplications and the
cluster duplications. Furthermore, we aimed to test the
hypothesis that the conservation of the genomic architecture of a gene cluster is linked to the content of conserved
elements within the intergenic regions. To this end we
investigated the 3-gene-cluster of KCNA genes (Kv1,
shaker-related potassium channels) in several species of
vertebrates. In tetrapods, two clusters exist (KCNA3KCNA2-KCNA10, KCNA6-KCNA1-KCNA5), while teleosts were found to have four clusters.

Results
Tetrapods, such as human, chicken and frog, have two
three-gene-clusters (3-2-10, 6-1-5) and two additional
genes, KCNA4 and KCNA7, which are located elsewhere
in the genome (Figure 1). Teleost fish such as pufferfish,
medaka, stickleback and zebrafish were found to have
four clusters of KCNA genes. According to available results
from genome sequencing projects, KCNA5a was lost. For
KCNA7, duplicates were found in medaka and two copies
of KCNA4 are present in the osteoglossomorph elephantnose fish (Gnathonemus petersi). All of these genes are conserved in their transmembrane domains and in the poreloop region, but the other parts of these genes are highly
variable and impossible to align between different members of this gene family. In the tunicate Ciona intestinalis
only one KCNA gene was found while we received several
BLAST hits for the amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae)
genome.
A phylogenetic analysis of all KCNA genes suggests a
diversification of KCNA genes in the vertebrates and basal
position of KCNA7 among them (Figure 2); it is the only
vertebrate KCNA gene that contains a single intron while
all others are intronless. In invertebrates, such as Ciona
intestinalis and Drosophila melanogaster, the KCNA/shaker
gene has multiple introns, but the position of the introns
is not conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates
(data not shown). Genes identified from the Branchiostoma floridae genome, however, consisted of a single exon
indicating that the vertebrate KCNA7 gene acquired its

intron independently (Figure 3). The three best BLAST hits
from Branchiostoma floridae with vertebrate KCNA genes
were included in the phylogenetic analysis. All three genes
are positioned on different scaffolds and no clusters were
found. We obtained additional hits with the Branchiostoma genome, some of which also received KCNA best hits
in BLAST searches against the GenBank database. However, their high sequence divergence made reliable estimation of their phylogenetic position relative to the
outgroup in the KCNA gene tree impossible. The three
Branchiostoma KCNA genes included in the analysis form
a monophyletic group basal to the vertebrate genes, indicating a series of independent gene duplication within the
amphioxus lineage.
Within the vertebrate part of the tree, KCNA5 and
KCNA10 form a monophyletic group, as do KCNA1 and
KCNA2 (Figure 2). This finding supports the hypothesis
that the two clusters are the result of a complete duplica-

tion of the original cluster rather than of independent tandem duplications, which would have phylogenetically
grouped neighboring genes on chromosomes in the tree.
Only the KCNA3/KCNA6 gene pair does not reflect a pattern of whole genome duplication(s).
Our PCR based approach yielded two KCNA genes from
Hydrolagus colliei (spotted ratfish, KCNA2, 5), four genes
from Acipenser baerii (sturgeon, KCNA1, 2, 6, 10), six
genes from Lepisosteus platyrhynchus (gar, KCNA1, 2, 3, 5,
6, 10), and nine genes from Gnathonemus petersii
(elephantnose fish, KCNA1b, 2a?, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5b, 6b, 10a,
10b) [for accession numbers see Additional file 4]. We performed phylogenetic analyses of the ancient duplicates
(KCNA3-6, KCNA2-1 and KCNA10-5) and used KCNA4 as
outgroup [see Additional files 1, 2, 3]. KCNA4 is not part
of the clusters, but phylogenetically closely related without obvious acceleration of evolutionary rates (Figure 2).
In this way, we avoid reconstruction artifacts due to a too

assignment into "a" and "b" paralogs was done based on
the position in the clusters when genomic data was available, and the newly determined orthologous KCNA genes
for the fish were assigned names accordingly. The evolutionary rates differ clearly between the orthologous
groups (KCNA3 vs. KCNA6) as well as between the fishspecific a- and b-paralogs.
The KCNA2/1 analysis shows also a clear division between
these two set of genes, but there are no obvious rate differences between them, only within the teleosts somewhat
increased rates are apparent [see Additional file 2]. For
both genes, the non-teleost fish sequences (Acipenser,
Amia, Lepisosteus) are pro-orthologous of the FSGD as had
been proposed in previous studies [10,37,38]. Studies
based on Hox genes as well as other nuclear genes (sox11,
tyrosinase, fzd8, POMC) found a phylogenetic timing of
the FSGD after the divergence of Polypteriformes (bichir),
Acipenseriformes (sturgeons), Lepistosteidae (gar) and
Amiidae (bowfin), but before the teleost radiation including the most basal group of the Osteoglossiformes
[10,30]. The Gnathonemus KCNA2 sequence is positioned
basal to the duplication in the gene tree. The Gnathonemus
KCNA1 sequence is grouped with the b-paralog in the
KCNA1 gene tree. But also in this analysis, statistical support for most of the nodes is lacking.
Proposed scenario for the evolution of KCNA genes and clusFigure 3
ters in vertebrates
Proposed scenario for the evolution of KCNA genes
and clusters in vertebrates. Based on our analyses we
suggest that all KCNA genes are derived from an ancestral
intronless gene, as all genes included from Branchiostoma floridae are intronless and that KCNA7 in vertebrates independently gained an intron. Two tandem duplications led to the
three gene clusters found in today's genomes, which was
probably duplicated initially before the origin of the gnathostomes. Probably this is linked to the second genome duplication (2R) during vertebrate evolution. The four clusters in
teleost fish originated through the fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD, 3R).

divergent outgroup as would expected be with the ancestral KCNA7 gene.
Our KCNA3/6 dataset encompassed 42 sequences and
included sequences from human, chick and frog (378
amino acid positions) and resulted in Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference trees which were congruent
for the well supported nodes and showed only minor differences within the not strongly resolved parts of the tree
[see Additional file 1]. While the KCNA3 genes were phylogenetically separate from the KCNA6 genes, the resolution within each of these sets of orthologous genes is poor
and the relationships, especially among the fish paralogous groups, could not be identified with confidence. The

The KCNA5/10 tree shows a similar pattern as the KCNA3/
6 analysis with a clear acceleration of evolutionary rates in
the KCNA10 genes, a trend that is even more pronounced
in ray-finned fish [see Additional file 3]. The Hydrolagus
KCNA5 sequence is phylogenetically grouped with the
other KCNA5 genes with good phylogenetic support
(94%BP, 100%PP), indicating that the duplication of the
clusters leading to KCNA5 and KCNA10 occurred before
the divergence of cartilaginous fish as previously proposed [39].
Even though the phylogenetic analyses of KCNA genes
cannot pinpoint the duplication event in the fish phylogeny with a high degree of certainty, the numbers of identified genes implies that the phylogenetic split of basal
lineages that include Acipenser, Lepisosteus and Amia from
the fish stem lineage precedes the duplication event, while
duplicated KCNA4 and KCNA10 genes suggest that Osteoglossomorphs (Gnathonemus petersi) diverged after the
3R event. This interpretation is in agreement with previous analyses on the phylogenetic timing of the FSGD [10].
We analyzed the non-coding regions of the complete clusters using the Tracker software [40], which detects clusters
of such phylogenetic footprints (putative transcription
factor binding sites) termed cliques (FC). Following the
definition of phylogenetic footprints as in Tagle et al. [41],
we only compared sequences with an additive evolution-

ary time of at least 250 million years, i.e. species that
diverged at least 125 million years ago, and therefore we
excluded comparisons of orthologous pufferfish clusters
[42,43]. For the KCNA 6-1-5 comparisons, we included
the partial Tetraodon KCNA 5-1b cluster, since it was currently the only available genomic sequence for this paralogon. Because of a large sequence gap in the intergenic
region of the medaka KCNA 6-1b, we omitted this
sequence from the analysis. We also could not include the
Danio KCNA 3-2-10a cluster, since no linkage information
for KCNA2a was available in the current assembly. For
these analyses we were able to include a total of 20 clusters
(11KCNA 3-2-10, 9 KCNA 6-1-5 and we obtained 670 FC
of which 182 are shared by more than two species. The
alignments and positions of those are given in the Additional file 5. Since an analysis using untreated sequences
resulted an unusual high number of cliques shared only
between the two paralogous human clusters as well as
between the two Xenopus clusters, an effect probably due
to the abundance of repetitive elements, we used RepeatMasker to remove those elements and repeated the analyses [44]. This strategy reduced the number of intra-species
hits successfully.
We also analyzed the number of FCs and the length of
conserved sequences between orthologous and paralogous clusters. Between orthologous clusters, the number
of conserved elements follows the expected patterns, at
least within tetrapods and the orthologous fish clusters
respectively (Tables 1, 2). Paralogous fish KCNA-gene
clusters share surprisingly few conserved elements.
Interesting in this regard is the comparison between paralogous clusters (e.g. Homo 3-2-10 vs. Homo 6-1-5). While
one might expect to find a reduced number of conserved
sequences compared to the orthologous comparisons
(e.g. Homo 3-2-10 vs. Xenopus 3-2-10), this is not the case
for comparisons among tetrapods. The human KCNA3-2-

10 cluster shares more FCs with its paralog KCNA6-1-5
than with the more closely related frog KCNA3-2-10 cluster, even after the elimination of repetitive sequences
(Table 3). This effect is mainly due to relatively short FCs
that are found only in the human sequences and not in
any other species.

Discussion
Up to now, shaker-related voltage-gated potassium channels have been mainly studied in tetrapods with a strong
emphasis on functional and structural aspects [34,35,45],
but not within a larger phylogenomic framework. Neither
the number of genes within ray-finned fish nor the phylogenetic relationships of these genes have been studied
previously. Yet, this information clearly provides useful
insights for the comparison of experimental and functional studies. With prior knowledge of the existence of
two 3-gene-clusters (3-2-10 and 6-1-5) in mammals
[32,33], we were able identify two clusters in chicken and
the frog Xenopus tropicalis as well. The human clusters are
positioned on chromosomes (chr 1, chr 12) that have
been reported to contain a number of genes duplicated
during large scale duplication events [7]. The addition of
new data from fish reveals the existence of four clusters in
teleosts as a result of the fish-specific genome duplication
(FSGD). KCNA3-2-10 cluster of Tetraodon are on chromosomes 11 and 9, in Oryzias on chromosomes 7 and 5. The
origin of those chromosomes through the FSGD has been
proposed previously [16,46]. Because of missing linkage
data, similar conclusions for the KCNA6-1-5 clusters cannot be drawn. Due to a lack of data from lampreys and
hagfish, the timing of the first cluster duplication (leading
to the two-cluster situation in tetrapods) is unknown (Figure 1). Most likely their origin is the result of one of the
genome duplication events during chordate/vertebrate
evolution (2R) [7,47]. The two genes we identified from
Hydrolagus colliei (spotted ratfish, Chondrichthyes) so far
can unambiguously be assigned to their tetrapod

orthologs (KCNA2, KCNA5). This finding implies that
sharks already possesses the two KCNA clusters [39], the
timing of the duplication with respect to the cyclostomes
remains unclear. The KCNA complement of the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae shows an independent
series of gene duplication, with all genes being intronless.
Thus cluster formation in the vertebrate lineage occurred
after the divergence with the cephalochordates. In Ciona
intestinalis, a tunicate, only one KCNA sequence was
found, which consisted of at least five exons, of which
only four were identified unambiguously. The amino-terminus was found to be highly variable among different
vertebrate genes and thus BLAST searches with invertebrate sequences yielded no hits for the amino terminus.
The phylogenetic analysis suggested KCNA7 as the most
basal vertebrate KCNA gene. This gene has two exons,
while the rest of the vertebrate genes are intronless (Figure
1). The phylogenetic analyses could not resolve all sistergroup relationships between the intronless KCNA genes
(KCNA1-6, 10) with high confidence. This might be due
to the extreme rate difference among the various members
of this gene family as well as, the rapid succession of
duplication events. We propose an evolutionary scenario
of two consecutive tandem duplications that formed a
first cluster. Mostly likely during the 2R genome duplication, the entire cluster was duplicated leading to the situation found in tetrapods (Figure 3). This hypothesis is
also supported by the sistergroup relationship found
between KCNA5 and 10, as well as between KCNA1 and 2
genes, which are now parts of different KCNA clusters. For
the other gene pairs, the data are not as clear, but the alternative scenario of independent tandem duplications on
different chromosomes is not supported by the topology
of the tree. We suppose that the reconstruction problems
are caused by the fast evolution of KCNA6 as well as by the

short basal branches that render phylogenetic reconstructions difficult. This also implies that the tandem duplications must have happened, evolutionarily speaking, only
shortly before the entire cluster duplications. The origin of
the KCNA4 gene from the KCNA7 gene progenitor could
be the result of a large-scale duplication (1R) event followed by the loss of several genes but currently there are
no synteny data available to add support this hypothesis.
The phylogenetic analyses, also with smaller datasets [see
Additional files 1, 2, 3], are hampered by pronounced rate
differences between paralogs and increased rates of evolution of KCNA paralogs in the teleost fish. Accelerated rates
of evolution in some fish genes have been observed before
[48-50]. Pronounced rate differences can lead to wrong
topologies [51]. An accelerated rate of evolution might be
due to reduced selective pressure because of gene redundancy after duplication, or, alternatively, might be due to
positive Darwinian selection associated with a change in
function. Yet, currently, a link between expression and the
formation of heterodimers between different subtypes
and their evolutionary rates is not obvious. More functional data with respect to gene expression and its regulation, as well as the formation of heteromers from more
species, especially teleost fishes, could provide further
insights. To date, expression data are available only for
few tetrapod species such as mouse, human and chicken.
Furthermore, these studies only examined expression differences in a subset of tissue types [52].
For a better understanding of the characteristics of the
gene clusters, we first performed an alignment based
VISTA plot analysis [53]. However, no clear conserved
regions across all species included were apparent, only
between the orthologous fish clusters (results not shown).
For a more detailed analysis, we ran the Tracker program,

which is based on an initial BlastZ algorithm [40]. We performed a complete analysis using 20 sequences and
obtained 670 FC, of which 182 consist of more than two
sequences. Alignments and sequence positions of the FCs
are provided in the supplementary data. The percentage of
FCs of the complete sequences was very low in tetrapods
but the teleost clusters showed comparable values (11–
34%) to the Hox clusters (10–38%, Hoegg et al, submitted) (Table 4). The lack of signal observed in Vista plots is
rather a pronounced lack of elements conserved between
tetrapods and fish. Hox genes as developmental key factors, on the other hand, are involved in many different
pathways and, therefore, have more regulatory elements
that are conserved over long evolutionary distances.
Expression of KCNA genes, on the other hand, was studied so far only in adult tissues, but a more continuous
expression pattern in specific tissues (e.g. brain, heart,
muscle) might be expected. Since KCNA genes are active
as homo- and heterotetramers, expressional "fine tuning"
might also be accomplished through the expression of a
combination of different KCNA genes at different stages
during development and in different tissue types. The
analyses of orthologous clusters revealed the expected pat-

tern for the tetrapods and within orthologous fish clusters, i.e., more closely related organisms share more
cliques, while the paralogous fish clusters share less conserved elements (Tables 1, 2). This finding again is most
likely caused by faster evolution in duplicated fish clusters.
However, the comparisons between paralogous clusters of
the same species showed an unexpected pattern for the
tetrapods included in this study (Table 3). The phylogenetic analyses show that the clusters were duplicated
before the tetrapod – ray-finned fish split (+/- 450 million
years ago [54]). Using sequences that were not "masked"
for repetitive sequences in the Tracker analyses as proposed in the original publication [40], leads to high numbers of FCs shared only between paralogous sequences of
one tetrapod species. The teleost KCNA clusters are more
compact, contain less repetitive sequences and are therefore less susceptible to false hits. For gnathostome Hox
clusters, where selection is acting against repetitive
sequences [55], masking can be neglected, but for other
gene clusters it can be useful.

This finding might imply that the clustered structure of
KCNA genes is to some extent due to common expression
domains of the genes within each cluster [56], or at least
that the regulatory elements are not conserved over larger
evolutionary distances. Since expression data is not widely
available especially not for non-mammal species, it is difficult to draw further conclusions about this testable
hypothesis.

Conclusion
The KCNA gene family underwent a series of duplications
within the vertebrates leading to eight genes in tetrapods
and more than 13 in teleosts. The initial gene underwent
at least two tandem duplications forming two three-geneclusters, that were most likely duplicated during a genome
duplication before the divergence of the Chondrichthyes.
The molecular evolutionary analysis of the KCNA gene
clusters showed only few footprint cliques (FC) that are
conserved over large evolutionary distances, while among
the teleost clusters more conservation was evident. Shared
regulatory elements do not seem to be the major force that
keep these clusters intact and therefore do not pose a general rule for gene cluster retention.

Methods
Database searches
Complete clusters of KCNA genes were downloaded from
public databases such as Genbank (Homo sapiens), Ensemble (Gallus gallus, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Oryzias latipes,

% of bp cliques

Danio rerio), JGI (Branchiostoma floridae, Xenopus tropicalis,
Takifugu rubripes), and Genoscope (Tetraodon nigroviridis).
Amplification of KCNA genes
Universal primers (KCNA.uni.F270.super ATY YTN TAY
TAY TAY CAR TCI GGI GG, KCNA.uni.R583.super ACN
GTN GTC ATN GRI ACI GCC ACC A) were designed based
on known sequences. These primers amplified all intronless KCNA genes (KCNA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10) in vertebrates.
PCRs were performed in 25 µl reactions using 0.5 µl (1
Unit/µL) of REDTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma), 2.5 µl
10×REDTaq PCR reaction buffer, 1.5 µl dNTPs (2.5 mM
each), 1.0 µl MgCl2 (25 mM), 1.0 µl of each primer (10
µM) and 20 ng of genomic DNA. 35 PCR cycles with an
annealing temperature of 50°C and an extension time of
two minutes were conducted in each experiment. PCRs
were performed with DNA from Hydrolagus colliei (spotted
ratfish, Chondrichthyes) Polypterus senegalus (bichir), Acipenser baerii (Siberian sturgeon), Lepisosteus platyrhynchus
(Florida gar), Amia calva (bowfin), Gnathonemus petersi
(elephant nose fish) and Oreochromis niloticus (tilapia).

PCR fragments were subcloned using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Colony PCRs were performed followed by sequencing on an ABI-Hitachi 3100 capillary
sequencer following the manufacturer's instructions using
the BigDye Terminator cycle-sequencing ready reaction kit
(Applied Biosystems Inc.).

Phylogenetic analyses
Deduced amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW and manually refined in BioEdit [57]. Amino- and
carboxy-terminal sequences were not alignable and therefore were excluded from further analyses. Models of
sequence evolution were chosen with ProtTest [58] using
the AIK criterion. Maximum likelihood analyses were performed with PhyML [59], running 500 bootstrap replicates. Bayesian inference were performed in MrBayes3.1
[60] for 100 000 generations, running 4 chains, sampling
every 10th tree and a burnin value of 5000.

Cluster analyses
Complete gene clusters from Homo sapiens, Gallus gallus,
Xenopus tropicalis, Takifugu rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis,
Gasterosteus aculeatus, Oryzias latipes and Danio rerio were
analyzed using the Tracker program [40] for the identification of conserved sequences. Since suspicious amounts
of paralogous hit from one species were found for human
and frog, we removed repetitive sequences using RepeatMasker [44]. We excluded direct comparisons between the
two pufferfish sequences to avoid biased results due to
their recent common ancestry. Footprint cliques with
more than two sequences are given in Additional file 5.
We also performed VISTA plots using LAGAN multiple
alignments [53].
