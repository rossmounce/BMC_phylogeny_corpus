degeneration

Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage and the accumulation of somatic mutations in
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with certain neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have
also provided controversial results on the association of mtDNA haplogroups with susceptibility to Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), but possible relationships between mtDNA and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) have been
less frequently studied.
Methods: We analysed the role of mtDNA and its maintenance enzymes in 128 early-onset AD (eoAD) and in 66
FTLD cases. Patients and 99 controls were collected from a defined region of Finland, that of Northern
Ostrobothnia, for the determination of mtDNA haplogroups and the analysis of two common mtDNA mutations
(m.3243A>G, m.8344A>G). In addition, screening was performed for five common POLG1 mutations (T251I, A467T,
P587L, W748S and Y955C) and all the coding exons of the PEO1 and ANT1 genes were screened for mutations.
Results: The frequency of haplogroup cluster IWX was 2.3 fold higher among the FTLD cases than in the controls
(OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.09-6.65, p = 0.028). The frequency of mtDNA haplogroups or clusters did not differ between the
eoAD cases and controls. The two mtDNA mutations and five POLG1 mutations were absent in the eoAD and
FTLD patients. No pathogenic mutations were found in the PEO1 or ANT1 genes.
Conclusions: We conclude that the haplogroup cluster IWX was associated with FTLD in our cohort. Further
studies in other ethnically distinct cohorts are needed to clarify the contribution of mtDNA haplogroups to FTLD
and AD.

Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar
degeneration (FTLD) are the two most common neurodegenerative diseases leading to early-onset dementia.
Causative mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP)
genes have been found in a few patients with familial
AD [1]. The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene
(ApoE) has a significant association with AD [2]. Pathogenic mutations in the microtubule-associated protein
tau (MAPT) and progranulin (PGRN) genes have rarely
been identified in FTLD despite the high frequency of
familial cases [3-5]. Most AD and FTLD cases have a
complex etiology, however, and many genetic and also

behavioural and environmental risk factors may play a
role in the disease processes.
There is growing evidence to suggest that mitochondria play an important role in ageing and in neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to
reduced ATP production, increased generation of reactive oxygen species and also impaired calcium buffering
[6]. The brain is especially vulnerable to oxidative
damage, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) and in the genes involved in mtDNA maintenance are associated with variable spectrum of mitochondrial disorders affecting the brain [7,8]. POLG1,
encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase g,
PEO1, coding for the mitochondrial helicase Twinkle,
and ANT1, encoding the adenine nucleotide translocator, are important for mtDNA replication. Pathogenic
mutations in mtDNA or in its maintenance genes have

rarely been described in neurodegenerative diseases
leading to dementia. Y955C mutation in POLG1 was
previously identified in a patient with progressive external opthalmoplegia (PEO) who had Alzheimer pathology
and multiple mtDNA deletions [9], There are also some
patients with pathogenic mtDNA mutations suffering
from dementia and cognitive impairment [10]. MtDNA
polymorphisms and certain haplogroups have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and AD [11-13] and also with longevity
[14-16]. Previous studies have reached variable conclusions with regard to the association of certain mtDNA
haplogroups with AD. Men with haplogroup U had an
increased risk of AD, while women with the same haplogroup had a significant decrease in that risk [17].
Furthermore, haplogroups K and U seemed to neutralize
the effect of the ε4 allele of ApoE [18]. However, in
some studies no association was found between mtDNA
haplogroups and AD [19-21]. So far there is only one
report on frontotemporal dementia and mtDNA haplogroups, reporting no evidence of any association
between them [22].
We report here on investigations into the role of
mtDNA and its maintenance enzymes in AD and FTLD
in Finnish patients. Patients and controls were collected
from a defined region of Finland, that of Northern
Ostrobothnia, for the determination of mtDNA haplogroups and the analysis of two common mtDNA
mutations (m.3243A>G, m.8344A>G) in the patients.
Since encephalopathy and cognitive decline are common
features in mitochondrial diseases, screening was performed for five common POLG1 mutations (T251I,
A467T, P587L, W748S and Y955C) and all the coding
exons of the PEO1 and ANT1 genes were screened for
mutations.

Patients and methods
Subjects

We examined 194 patients (92 men) with early-onset
AD and FTLD at the Department of Neurology of Oulu
University Hospital, Finland. The patients were all from
the population of the province of Northern Ostrobothnia and their parents were all of Finnish origin. Patients
from other ethnic groups were not able to participate
the study. Probable AD had been diagnosed according
to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria [23] in 128 cases and
FTLD according to the clinical diagnostic criteria for
that disease in 66 cases [24]. The mean age at onset was
58 years (range 38-64) for the AD patients and 58.5
years (range 40-79) for the FTLD patients.
Use was made of results obtained previously from a
mtDNA haplogroup analysis of 99 control subjects
(mean age 40 ± 12 years, range 19-64) from Northern
Ostrobotnia [25]. The controls were healthy anonymous

blood donors whose mothers had also been free of neurological diseases and the common manifestations of
mitochondrial diseases such as hearing impairment and
diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the donors and their
mothers were required to be born in the same province,
in order to obtain a good representation of the ancestral
population of the province.
Written informed consent was obtained from all the
individuals or those caring for them. The research protocols were approved by the Ethics Committees of the
Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District and the Finnish
Red Cross.
Molecular methods

Total genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples by the standard sodium dodecyl sulphate-proteinase
K method. Fragments amplified by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) technique were used for restriction fragment analysis (RFLP), conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) [26], sequencing and mtDNA
haplogroup analysis.
The m.3243A>G mutation was screened by RFLP
using the restriction enzyme ApaI [27]. The m.8344A>G
mutation was detected by RFLP using BglI [28]. MtDNA
haplogroups (H, V, U, K, J, T, I, W, X) were determined
by RFLP of polymorphic sites as described previously
[29,30]. These haplogroups can be grouped into clusters
(HV, UK, JT, IWX) according to their phylogenetic
background [30].
The POLG1 mutations T251I (BseNI), A467T (MscI)
and P587L (XmaI) were analysed by RFLP, while the
W748S mutation was verified by allele-specific amplification using primers with a locked nucleic acid (LNA)
nucleoside base at the 3’end (Proligo LLC, Paris,
France). The primers were designed to anneal with
either
the
wild
type
sequence
(5’-GGACATCCCTGGCTGCTG-3’) or the sequence containing
the mutation (5’-GGACATCCCTGGCTGCTC-3’).
Detection of the Y955C mutation was performed by
CSGE. The POLG1 exon 18, coding for the Y955, was
amplified from the patient samples and from a control
sample with a known sequence. The amplified fragments
were mixed, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and the heteroduplexes were allowed to anneal at 68°C for 30 min.
The samples were electrophoresed through a polyacrylamide gel overnight at a constant voltage of 400 V,
stained in 10 μl/100 ml SYBR Gold solution (Invitrogen,
Eugene, Oregon, U.S.A.) for 5 min, visualized with an
UV transluminator and photographed (Chemi-Doc XRS,
Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, U.S.A.).
All the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of
PEO1 and ANT1 were screened using CSGE. Fragments
were further sequenced if they differed in mobility on
the CSGE. Sequencing was carried out using the BigDye
Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied

Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.) and the ABI PRISM
3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The apolipoprotein E genotype was determined as described previously [31].
Statistical analyses

Differences in the frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups
and haplogroup clusters between the populations were
evaluated using the exact test of population differentiation [32] as implemented in Arlequin 2.0 or, if applicable, using the c2 test or Fisher’s exact test in the SPSS
16.0 software for Windows. The referent group consisted of all cases classified as carriers of other haplogroup or haplogroup cluster than the one under study.
The minimum significance level was set at two-sided p
= 0.05. The 95% confidence intervals of odds ratio (OR)
were calculated. The patients and controls were stratified into two subgroups according to their ApoE genotype: individuals carrying at least one ApoE ε4 allele
(ApoE4+) and non-ApoE ε4 carriers (ApoE4-).

Results
MtDNA haplogroups were determined in 128 patients
with eoAD and 66 with FTLD and compared with the
previous results for the 99 controls (Table 1). The haplogroup frequencies differed between the three groups
(p = 0.04; exact test of population differentiation). No
significant difference was found in the frequency of haplogroups when patients with eoAD and patients with
FTLD were separately compared to the controls (p =
0.41 and p = 0.074, respectively, exact test of population
differentiation). However, a difference was found
between patients with eoAD and those with FTLD (p =
0.006).
Subsequently, we analysed the frequencies of clusters
of phylogenetically related haplogroups HV, UK, JT and
IWX (Table 2). The frequency of haplogroup cluster
IWX was 2.3 fold higher among the FTLD cases than in

the controls (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.09-6.65, p = 0.028). No
significant differences were observed in the frequencies
of haplogroup clusters HV, UK and JT between the
FTLD cases and controls (Table 3). The frequency of
haplogroup W was higher among the patients with
FTLD than in the controls but not significantly so (p =
0.25).
The frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups were not significantly different between the eoAD patients and the
controls (Table 1). Haplogroup H was the most common in both the control and patient groups (Table 1).
The frequency of haplogroup H was slightly but not significantly higher in the patients with eoAD than in the
controls (p = 0.15). The frequency of cluster HV was
higher, but not significantly so, in the AD patients than
that in the controls (p = 0.23). ApoE4 allele was more
frequent in AD patients than in controls (63.3% vs
35.1%, respectively). We found no association between
carriers of ApoE4 allele and mtDNA haplogroups.
In addition, we analysed two mtDNA mutations and
mutations in three nuclear-encoded enzymes which contribute to mtDNA integrity. The m.3243A>G and
m.8344A>G mutations and the five common POLG1
mutations, T251I, A467T, P587L, W748S and Y955C,
were absent in this population. Four single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) and one single nucleotide insertion were found in the PEO1 and ANT1 genes, but no
pathogenic mutations (see additional files 1 and 2). One
of the polymorphisms has not been reported previously.

Discussion
We found a significant association between haplogroup
cluster IWX and FTLD. Within this cluster, frequency
of haplogroup W was highest in FTLD patients compared to the controls and eoAD patients. Interestingly,
the non-synonymous/synonymous rate in the mtDNAencoded complex I genes (MTND) is higher within haplogroup cluster IWX than in the remaining European
haplogroup clusters [12] thus suggesting that the relative
excess of nonsynonymous mutations in cluster IWX
may have a role in the risk of developing FTLD.
Another possible explanation for the observed association found in our cohort between cluster IWX and
FTLD is a recent founder effect. There have been only a
few previous reports of associations between the haplogroup W and certain diseases mainly due to its presence at low level in the population making it difficult
to detect associations. In one report, however, an association is demonstrated for Iranian Leber hereditary
optic neuropathy (LHON) patients with the m.3460G>A
mutation, suggesting that W might be a haplotype that
increases the penetrance of LHON [33].
Our study showed no significant differences in the frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups or haplogroup clusters

between the eoAD patients and controls. The frequency
of HV cluster was higher among the eoAD patients than
among the controls, but the difference was not significant. Interestingly, this haplogroup cluster has also been
reported to be significantly associated with the risk of
late-onset AD independently of ApoE genotype in a Polish population [34]. In the same study, women with
haplogroup H were found to have an elevated risk of
AD, but the effect was no longer statistically significant
after adjustment for age and ApoE genotype. In addition, a weak association has also been observed between
haplogroup H and pathologically confirmed dementia
with Lewy bodies [19]. In our sample the frequency of
haplogroup H was slightly higher among the eoAD
patients than among the controls, the relative risk (RR)
being 1.28. We calculated the relative risk attached to
haplogroup H among the total of 957 patients with AD
in four previous association studies and the present
study, involving altogether 900 controls, and found it to
be 1.2 (range 1.06-1.28), which lends support to a possible role for haplogroup H regarding the risk of AD (see
additional file 3).
Comparisons of nucleotide diversity and neutrality
tests in European haplogroup clusters have shown that
there are haplogroup-specific differences in the intensity
of selection against particular regions of the mitochondrial genome, suggesting that some mutations may be
non-neutral within specific phylogenetic lineages but
neutral in others [35]. Haplogroup cluster HV has been
shown to be most non-neutral of the European haplogroup clusters by virtue of the high number of segregating sites and singleton mutations [35]. The
pathogenic potential of a mutation may depend on the
presence of interacting mutations or on the presence of
a certain haplogroup. It is intriguing that nonagenarians
have been reported to have lower frequencies of haplogroup H and HV cluster [16] thus supporting that
haplogroup H may have a role in neurodegenerative diseases and early aging.
The frequencies of the mtDNA haplogroups vary
between populations and even regionally within the

FTLD compared with controls

same country [36,37]. There are also major differences
in haplogroup frequencies between northern and southern Finland [16,25], which implies that it is essential to
compare the patients’ data with control findings from
the same area in order to obtain reliable results. Therefore, we were careful to enrol patients and controls
from the same province. Furthermore, the mothers of
the controls were required to have been born in the
same province as the controls themselves, to ensure that
they represented the ancestral population of the province. The average migration rate in the region was low
during the period when the mothers of the controls
must have been born [25].
There is considerable evidence of abnormal mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in AD [38,39], where
impaired energy metabolism and oxidative damage may
precede beta-amyloid deposition [40]. On the other
hand, the level of somatic mutations is no higher in AD
patients than in aged-matched controls, although
mtDNA mutations do increase with age [41]. Oxidative
stress and associations with mtDNA have been less
intensively studied in the case of FTLD. In this investigation into the role of mtDNA and its maintenance
enzymes in Finnish early-onset AD and FTLD patients
the two common mtDNA mutations (m.3243A>G,
m.8344A>G) and five POLG1 mutations were not found,
nor were there any pathogenic mutations in the PEO1
or ANT1 genes. However, we cannot exclude other
mitochondrial mutations as the whole mitochondrial
genome was not screened.

Conclusions
Our analysis revealed a significant association between
mtDNA haplogroup cluster IWX and FTLD, suggesting
that possession of this cluster may have a role in
developing neurodegeneration in FTLD. Further studies in other ethnically distinct cohorts are needed to
