Abstract
Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) – cancer of the bile ducts – is associated with chronic
infection with the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini. Despite being the only eukaryote that is
designated as a 'class I carcinogen' by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, little is
known about its genome.
Results: Approximately 5,000 randomly selected cDNAs from the adult stage of O. viverrini were
characterized and accounted for 1,932 contigs, representing ~14% of the entire transcriptome, and,
presently, the largest sequence dataset for any species of liver fluke. Twenty percent of contigs
were assigned GO classifications. Abundantly represented protein families included those involved
in physiological functions that are essential to parasitism, such as anaerobic respiration,
reproduction, detoxification, surface maintenance and feeding. GO assignments were well
conserved in relation to other parasitic flukes, however, some categories were over-represented
in O. viverrini, such as structural and motor proteins. An assessment of evolutionary relationships
showed that O. viverrini was more similar to other parasitic (Clonorchis sinensis and Schistosoma
japonicum) than to free-living (Schmidtea mediterranea) flatworms, and 105 sequences had close
homologues in both parasitic species but not in S. mediterranea. A total of 164 O. viverrini contigs
contained ORFs with signal sequences, many of which were platyhelminth-specific. Examples of
convergent evolution between host and parasite secreted/membrane proteins were identified as
were homologues of vaccine antigens from other helminths. Finally, ORFs representing secreted
proteins with known roles in tumorigenesis were identified, and these might play roles in the
pathogenesis of O. viverrini-induced CCA.
Conclusion: This gene discovery effort for O. viverrini should expedite molecular studies of
cholangiocarcinogenesis and accelerate research focused on developing new interventions, drugs
and vaccines, to control O. viverrini and related flukes.

Background
Throughout East Asia, there is a strikingly high prevalence
of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA – cancer of the bile ducts) in
regions where the human liver fluke is endemic. No
stronger link occurs between a human malignancy and
infection with a eukaryotic parasite than that between
CCA and infection with the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini (Digenea) [1]. Indeed, the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) recognizes O. viverrini as a
'category I carcinogen' [2,3]. CCA is highly prevalent in
Northeast Thailand, areas where uncooked cyprinoid fish
are a dietary staple. Due to poor sanitation practices and
inadequate sewerage infrastructure, O. viverrini-infected
people pass the trematode's eggs in their feces into natural
bodies of fresh water. Aquatic snails, which represent the
first intermediate hosts of O. viverrini, ingest the eggs from
which the miracidia undergo asexual reproduction before
a population of the free swimming larval stage, called a
cercaria, is shed from the infected snails. The cercaria then
locates a cyprinoid fish, encysts in the fins, skin and musculature of the fish, and becomes a metacercaria. The metacercarial stage is infective to humans and other fisheating mammals. Infection is acquired when people
ingest raw or undercooked fish. The young adult worm
escapes from the metacercarial cyst in the upper small
intestine and then migrates through the ampulla of Vater
into the biliary tree, where it develops to sexual maturity
over four to six weeks, thus completing the life cycle. The
adult worms, which are hermaphrodites, can live for
many years in the liver, even decades, shedding as many
as 200 eggs per day which pass out via bile into the chyme
and feces [4].
In Thailand, ~6 million people are infected with O. viverrini. Despite widespread chemotherapy with the compound, praziquantel, the prevalence of O. viverrini in
some endemic areasapproaches 70% (reviewed in [1]).
Moreover, in Thailand, liver cancer is the most prevalent
of the malignant/fatal neoplasias, and the prevalence of
CCA in regions in which the parasite is endemic is unprecedented [5].
While sexual reproduction takes place in the mature
adults of O. viverrini within the bile ducts, asexual reproduction in the snail leads to a massive increase in the
number of infectious cercarial stages exiting and swimming off to locate then infect the fish host. The adult fluke
is a diploid organism which reproduces by meiosis; self
fertilization of the male and female organs occurs, but it is
believed that cross-fertilization between adjacent adult
worms is the normal pattern. Although the genome size of
O. viverrini has not yet been reported, it is known to have
six pairs of chromosomes, i.e. 2n = 12 [6], distinct from
the closely related liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis, which
possesses 2n = 56 chromosomes [7].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/189

Despite its public health importance, only a small
number of O. viverrini sequences (mostly ribosomal
genes) have been available in public databases prior to the
present study. Characterization of the genes expressed in
this organism should provide a foundation for elucidating
the immunopathogenesis of CCA, particularly the molecular mechanisms by which infection with this parasite
induces cancer. Indeed, secreted proteins of O. viverrini
induce hyper-proliferation of cells (or hyperplasia) in vitro
[8], implying that carcinogenesis may not be just a consequence of chronic inflammation, but that the parasite
actively secretes gene products which initiate neoplasia.
Here, we undertake gene discovery for O. viverrini after the
construction of a cDNA library and characterization of
~5,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from this carcinogenic parasite. A similar dataset exists for C. sinensis [9],
which, despite its widespread prevalence [10], is not recognized as a 'class I carcinogen' [3]. Therefore, we compared the available transcriptomic dataset from O.
viverrini with those from C. sinensis, and from several
other flatworms, both free-living and parasitic in humans.

Results and Discussion
Features of the dataset
Of 5,159 randomly selected ESTs, a total of 4,241 yielded
acceptably high quality sequences. These in turn were
clustered into contigs, establishing a catalogue of 1,932
non-redundant OvAEs. This apparently represents the
largest dataset thus far for any of the liver flukes. Table 1
summarizes the key features of the dataset. Of note is that
the identities for 1,070 (55%) of these OvAEs could not
yet be established, as they did not share sequence homology (BLASTx/tBLASTx) with any other predicted or
known molecules in public databases, including dbEST
which contains 2,678 ESTs from the related liver fluke, C.
sinensis [9]. The average insert size of these novel OvAEs
was 550 nt; 47 of these 1,070 OvAEs had insert sizes of
less than 150 nt. These ESTs may in fact be O. viverrini-specific or even digenetic fluke-specific genes. A similar situation currently pertains to the human blood fluke where a
large percentage of known transcripts, and indeed proteins, are assumed to be Schistosoma- or indeed phylum
Platyhelminthes-specific [11,12]. If the O. viverrini
genome has 14,000 protein-coding genes (like the blood
fluke S. mansoni) [13], and if each of the 1,932 O. viverrini
contigs represented a protein coding gene, these newly
discovered genes from the adult stage of O. viverrini are
predicted to represent ~14% of the entire transcriptome of
this liver fluke. EST sequences described herein have been
deposited in dbEST under accession numbers EL618683–
EL620614.

Abundantly expressed transcripts
After manual filtering of 136 ribosomal sequences, the 10
most abundantly represented mRNAs encoded proteins
with known or unknown functions, including one contig
that did not have homologues in any public databases
(Table 2). Abundant contigs encoded proteins involved in
a range of physiological functions which are considered
essential to parasitism, such as anaerobic respiration
(myoglobin) [14], reproduction (vitelline precursors and
egg shell proteins) and detoxification of xenobiotic compounds (glutathione-S-transferase). Other abundantly
expressed OvAEs encoded proteins of likely key relevance
to the host-parasite relationship, and included proteases
(papain-like and legumain-like enzymes), saposin-like
proteins and dynein light chains. Homologues of some of
the most abundantly represented OvAEs were also highly
represented in C. sinensis ESTs (cysteine proteases,
myoglobin, vitelline B precursor), whereas others were
uniquely over-expressed in each species. In particular,
structural molecules, including tubulin and actin-binding
proteins, were among the 10 most abundant clones from
C. sinensis [9], but were not highly represented in the dataset from O. viverrini. An in-depth comparison of the O.
viverrini and C. sinensis datasets is presented below.
Gene ontology assignments of ESTs from O. viverrini and
related flukes
Three hundred and eighty three (383) of the total 1,932
OvAEs (19.8%) could be assigned GO classifications (Figure 1). The most abundant groups represented under the
molecular function category were linked to binding
(34.8%), catalytic activity (27.9%) and structural molecule activity (13.9%). Other sequences of interest identi-

fied in this category were inferred to relate to caspase
activity (0.2%) and transporter activity (5.3%). The most
abundant groups represented under the biological process
category corresponded to physiological processes
(41.2%), cellular processes (39.7%) and unknown biological processes (15.6%).
We then undertook a comparative assessment of GO
assignments of sequences from O. viverrini and two other
trematode parasites of humans in Asia – the liver fluke, C.
sinensis (2,679 contigs) and the blood fluke, S. japonicum
(107,427 contigs). In general, the percentages of ESTs
allocated to each GO category among these three flukes
was similar (Figure 2). However, some categories were
over- or under-represented in one species. For example,
contigs encoding structural proteins were ~four times
more abundantly represented in the two liver flukes than
in S. japonicum, whereas contigs encoding motor proteins
were ~three times more abundant in O. viverrini than they
were in C. sinensis or S. japonicum. Sample sizes were too
small to determine whether these differences were statistically significant. Both structural and motor proteins are
important components of fluke teguments [15], playing
roles in surface maintenance and turnover in schistosomes [16,17] and liver flukes [18]. Therefore, these
molecular differences might reflect the specialised niches
and physiological requirements of each parasite. From
just 1932 OvAEs, 15 different contigs had ORFs encoding
components of the dynein complex of motor proteins, a
category of motion- related, and surface and gut-localized
EF-hand motif- containing antigens which, at least in
schistosomes, represent potent allergens and targets of
protective immunological responses [17,19].

Evolutionary relationships between O. viverrini and other
platyhelminths
To assess the evolutionary relationships between O. viverrini and other platyhelminths (both parasitic and free-living), we used SimiTri [20] to plot the relative similarities
of predicted polypeptide sequences (Figure 3). OvAEs
shared most sequence identity with sequences from C. sinensis (2,679 publicly available ESTs), and S. japonicum
(107, 427 ESTs). OvAEs were less similar to sequences
from the free-living turbellarian platyhelminth, Schmidtea
mediterranea (171,472 ESTs) [21], which was not altogether surprising given the phylogenetic distance between
parasitic and free-living members of the phylum Platyhelminthes [22,23]. The bulk of this phylum (including
those species analysed here) represents a monophyletic
group based on 18S rDNA sequences [22] and morphological characters [24], and is often referred to as the
Rhabditophora [22]. Therefore, the members of the Rhabditophora are considered to be more closely related to
each other than to other turbellarian clades, such as the
Polycladida [22]. A total of 105 OvAEs had homologues
in the ESTs from the two parasitic flukes but not in the
free-living Schmidtea ([see additional file 1]; selected
examples are shown in the table in Figure 3), suggesting
that at least some of these are parasitism-specific genes.
Thirty-three (33) of the conserved parasitic fluke genes
were novel and did not have homologues of known function. Predicted proteins of known function included
homologues of legumain, fatty acid binding proteins,
myoglobin and potential anti-inflammatory proteins
such as Ly6/UPAR domain-containing proteins. Of the

parasitic fluke-specific genes, 38 encoded ORFs with Nterminal signal sequences; 14 of these OvAEs had homologues in just S. japonicum and 24 had homologues in
both S. japonicum and C. sinensis.
Secreted and membrane proteins
We conducted an analysis of ORFs containing an N-terminal signal peptide or signal anchor. A total of 164 OvAEs
contained ORFs with signal sequences. The dataset was
divided into three categories – sequences that were (i)
novel; (ii) platyhelminth-specific; (iii) conserved across
multiple phyla. Novel sequences constituted 55.4% of the
total, but only 5.2% of them encoded proteins with a signal sequence. Conserved sequences constituted 36.3% of
the total, and 10.7% of these encoded proteins with signal
sequences. Finally, the sequences inferred to be platyhelminth-specific accounted for 8.3% of the total dataset,
but 20.6% of these encoded proteins with a signal
sequence (Figure 4). It should be noted, however, that not
all of the OvAEs contained full-length nt sequences, and
therefore the true percentage of sequences with signal
peptides cannot be definitively inferred in the absence of
full genome coverage.

Sequences encoding novel secreted and/or membrane
proteins (without orthologues/paralogues in other organisms or phyla) may be of particular interest for the development of vaccines and drugs, because the absence of
host homologues enhances the prospect for therapeutic
margins of safety. OvAEs encoding secreted/membrane
proteins involved in many aspects of parasitism were

relative to the total number of extracted terms is indicated in the legend. Although cellular and physiological processes, structural proteins and catalytic activity were strongly represented other categories of interest include the caspases and transporter
activity that may represent proteins important for a parasitic lifestyle. The large number of unknowns in each of the three categories highlights the lack of knowledge regarding many of the proteins found in these parasites.

identified (Table 3), and some of these are discussed in
the following section. Two of the OvAEs presented in
Table 3, which are inferred to encode transforming growth
factor β receptor (see section "Host-parasite cross-talk)
and calumenin, were more similar in sequence to vertebrate proteins from both the non-redundant and dbEST
databases than they were to platyhelminth sequences,
suggesting that they have evolved independently to bind
host ligands. These results are reminiscent of reports of
the schistosome transcriptome where, for example, receptors for mammalian hormones, including insulin, fibroblast growth factor and cytokines, have been
hypothesized to bind host molecules (reviewed in [25]).
Proteases
As with other parasitic helminth transcriptomes [1113,25,26], proteins with catalytic activity were abundantly
represented in the O. viverrini dataset (27.9% of contigs
that were assigned GO molecular functions). Many of
these enzymes encoded endo- and exo-proteases belonging to established families (MEROPS classification), but

which have not yet been described from liver flukes (Table
3). Of particular interest were members of the S1A serine
protease family with sequence similarity to kallikrein and
chymotrypsin, and, therefore, potentially involved in
feeding or tissue migration [27]. Other proteases included
homologues of enzymes that digest hemoglobin in bloodfeeding helminths, including cathepsin D-like aspartic
and cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases [28-30] as well as
an asparaginyl endopeptidase, which is known to activate
the gastrodermal cathepsin B enzyme, and probably other
gut proteases in S. mansoni [31]. We also identified O.
viverrini homologues of the cell death enzyme, caspase-2,
and the neutral cysteine protease from the tegument of
schistosomes, calpain.
Multiple membrane-spanning proteins
Predicted proteins with multiple membrane spanning
domains were identified. Tetraspanins, an abundantly
represented family of four-transmembrane proteins in the
tegument of schistosomes [32,33], were identified from
O. viverrini (Figure 5). These proteins are thought to stabi-

(171,472 ESTs). SimiTri [20] was used to plot 1,932 O. viverrini contigs against related species database entries (A). Each spot
represents a unique contig and its sequence similarity to each of the three selected databases as determined by tBLASTx
scores. Sequences showing similarity to only one database are not shown. Sequences showing sequence similarity to only two
databases appear on the lines joining the two databases. Spots are coloured by their highest tBLASTx score to each of the
databases. O. viverrini sequences with homologues in the parasitic flukes only (not in Schmidtea) are highlighted in the dotted
region and the identities of selected examples are shown in the table (B). The entire list (105) of these putative parasite-specific
proteins is shown in Table S1.

lize the cell membrane by forming a network of interactions, called the tetraspanin web, with other membranebound and -associated proteins, particularly on the surface of cells of the immune system [34]. A homologue of
the six-transmembrane domain family of water channel
proteins, aquaporin [35], was identified. Seven transmembrane proteins are common drug targets [36], and at
least three distinct members of this family were identified,
including receptors for dystroglycan and lamin b, and a
protein with homology to a the DC-STAMP receptor from
the surface of dendritic cells (Table 3).

Host-parasite "cross talk"
Parasitic helminths receive host-derived signals for
growth and reproduction via surface receptors for host ligands, [37-39]. Convergent evolution of extracellular parasite proteins to promote their interactions with host
tissues is well documented [40,41], and we identified O.
viverrini ORFs encoding membrane and secreted proteins,
some of which were clearly more similar to vertebrate
than to invertebrate homologues (Table 3). Transforming
growth factor-beta (TGF-β) regulates cell growth and differentiation and is acquired on the cell surface by specific

signals (and subsequent signaling) for growth and development was a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor substrate 2. Parasitic flatworms induce fibrosis (and FGF)
[45], and the parasites might acquire and utilize the host
FGF that they induce for development and reproduction.
Indeed, schistosomes are dependent upon FGF and transferrin for growth and maturation in vitro [46]. Of the
sequences presented in Table 3, another OvAE which
shared greatest identity with vertebrate homologues,
encoded for calumenin, an EF-hand calcium binding protein localized to the secretory pathway. Calumenin is an
inhibitor of the gamma-carboxylation system [47] and is
expressed in thrombin-activated thrombocytes. It has a
modulating effect on the organization of the actin
cytoskeleton and may be involved in the pathophysiology
of thrombosis or in wound healing [48]. The predicted
calumenin of O. viverrini was most similar to rat and frog
orthologues/paralogues, suggesting that it might interact
with actin on the surface of host cells which are damaged
during parasite feeding and migration.

novel (no significant homology to any database entry). The
sequences in each category were then analysed for the presence of a signal sequence using SignalP. The relative percentages of each category are indicated along with the subcategory of signal sequence positive contigs.

TGF-β receptors [42]. An ORF encoding a member of the
TGF-β receptor type Ib family was identified in O. viverrini. The ORF included a 28 amino acid insertion absent
from other type I TGF-β receptors, except for TR1 from the
hydatid tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus (also members of the phylum Platyhelminthes) [43]. However, these
two insertions did not share sequence identity (Figure
6A). Unlike many of the ESTs identified for which the
closest homologues were from parasitic trematodes, the
O. viverrini TGF-β receptor type I was divergent from
SmRK-I of S. mansoni [44] and instead grouped more
closely with proteins from Echinococcus multilocularis and
from parasitic and free-living nematodes (Figure 6B). In
pairwise sequence comparisons, however, the O. viverrini
partial ORF was more similar to pig and macaque
sequences (44% identity over 181 amino acids) than it
was to Echinococcus TR1 (40% over 180 residues) or
SmRK1 (40% over 182 residues). SmRK-I is known to
bind to human TGF-β [40], suggesting that the O. viverrini
receptor might also bind host growth factors for maturation and reproduction. Another OvAE encoding a protein
which is potentially involved in the acquisition of host

Molecules associated with cancer?
O. viverrini is the major cause of CCA in South-East Asia
[1]. The molecular mechanisms underlying induction of
O. viverrini-induced CCA are thought to be multi-factorial
(reviewed in [49]), but recent evidence suggests that O.
viverrini secretes mitogenic proteins into host tissues [1,8].
OvAEs encoding secreted proteins with prospective
mitogenic activity were identified in the EST dataset. Of
note, first, progranulin (pgrn) is a pluripotent secreted
growth factor that mediates cell cycle progression, cell
motility [50] and wound repair [51]. We identified an
OvAE (OvAE1732) that shared sequence identity with
pgrn (data not shown). Of particular importance is that
pgrn has been implicated in regulating the proliferation of
tumour cells, and its expression is up-regulated in more
aggressive cancers (reviewed in [50]). The kallikrein-like
serine proteases are another family of enzymes whose
over-expression has been linked to cancer. The expression
of some kallikreins in prostate cells leads to changes indicative of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, an
important process in cancer progression [52]. An OvAE
(OvAE1918) with sequence identity to kallikrein-like
secreted proteases is present in the new O. viverrini gene
catalogue. Phospholipase A2 (PLA-2) regulates the provision of arachidonic acid to both cyclooxygenase- and
lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids (reviewed by [53]), and
the upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 is thought to be an
important feature of cholangiocarcinogenesis in both
humans and experimental rodent models [49,54,55]. We
identified an OvAE (OvAE1644) that encodes a secreted
PLA-2 which shared greatest sequence identity with PLA-2
from venom of Heloderma (Gila monster) and an EST
from C. sinensis (Table 3). Parasites utilize secreted serine
proteases [56] and PLA-2s [57] to invade host tissues, and

homologues of these proteins (and granulin) are potentially secreted by O. viverrini into host tissues where they
might promote cell proliferation, mutagenesis and ultimately carcinogensis. Ongoing studies in our laboratories
are now focused on the physiological roles of these putative carcinogens in the host-parasite relationship and in
cholangiocarcinogenesis induced by O. viverrini infection.
Potential vaccines
Digenean flukes develop through a series of morphologically and developmentally discrete stages within their
mammalian hosts, and each stage can be expected to display a characteristic transcritpome, confounding efforts to
develop new control measures. Adult parasitic flukes are
bound by an outer epithelial tegument, a structure that is
widely regarded as the most vulnerable target for vaccines
and drugs [32]. Homologues and orthologues of vaccine

antigens identified in the tegument (and other structures
from larval stages) of other flatworms were identified in
the O. viverrini dataset (Table 4). Of particular note were
the membrane spanning proteins, including an orthologue of the protective tetraspanin from S. mansoni, SmTSP-2 [32,33] (Figure 5) and the 22.6 kDa family of antigens from the schistosome tegument [58]. Homologues
of gut proteases used by blood-feeding helminths to
digest their blood-meal were identified from O. viverrini,
including cathepsin D-like aspartic proteases [59,60], 11
distinct papain-like cysteine proteases [61-63] and the
neutral protease, calpain, which associates with the inner
tegument of schistosomes [64]. Other potential immunogens include lipid-binding proteins which are efficacious
vaccines in the rabbit model against the western liver
fluke, Fasciola hepatica, including saposin-like proteins
[65] and fatty acid-binding proteins [66,67].

Conclusion

Methods

This report provides the first description of gene discovery
for the liver fluke O. viverrini. Infection with O. viverrini is
an important tropical health issue, but even more important and enigmatic is that chronic O. viverrini infection
leads to the development of CCA. Indeed, there is no
stronger link between a human parasite and cancer than
that between O. viverrini and CCA [68]. The new gene catalogue for O. viverrini represents the largest EST dataset in
the public domain for any species of liver fluke, and provides a platform for explorations into the molecular basis
of host-helminth parasite interactions. We [1] and others
[8] are interested in the molecules secreted into host tissues by O. viverrini that induce hyper-proliferation of biliary cells which can subsequently undergo malignant
transformation. Given the number of O. viverrini ESTs
sequenced herein, it is possible that mRNAs corresponding to these parasite mitogens are already present in the
current dataset. Proteomic analysis of proteins secreted by
adult O. viverrini maintained in vitro also is underway in
our laboratories, and linking peptide sequences to corresponding mRNAs can be expected to be facilitated by this
gene discovery program [12]. Finally, this gene discovery
information for O. viverrini should expedite molecular
studies of cholangiocarcinogenesis and accelerate research
focused on developing new interventions, drugs and vaccines, to control O. viverrini and related flukes.

Parasite material
Adult O. viverrini were collected from experimentally
infected hamsters (Mesocricetus auratas) maintained at the
animal facility of the Khon Kaen University Faculty of
Medicine. Protocols approved by the Khon Kaen University Animal Ethics Committee were used for all animal
research conducted in this study. Briefly, metacercariae of
O. viverrini were collected from naturally infected cyprinoid fish by pepsin digestion. Metacercariae (100 per
hamster) were administered intragastrically to hamsters.
Hamsters were euthanazed 6 weeks after inoculation, and
adult worms were flushed with saline from the bile ducts
[69]. Worms were washed extensively with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), after which they were snap
frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen or employed immediately as the source of fluke RNA.
Construction and mass excision of cDNA library
Total RNA from adult O. viverrini was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of O. viverrini total RNA was used as a
template for the synthesis of double-stranded cDNA using
the SMART cDNA kit (BD Bioscience), after which the
cDNA modified with adapters was cloned into the Sfi I site
of the pTriplEx2 plasmid (BD Bioscience) and packaged
into λ arms. The titer and percentage of recombinant
phages in the library were determined using the protocols

recommended by the manufacturer. Escherichia coli strain
BM25.8 cells were transduced with recombinant phage,
from which the excision of the pTriplEx phagemid library
was accomplished.
Clone selection, sequencing and annotation
Five thousand clones were randomly selected from the
phagemid library and grown overnight in Luria Bertani
(LB) broth supplemented with ampicillin to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. Overnight cultures were shipped
at 4°C in LB broth/ampicillin to the University of Melbourne (Department of Veterinary Science). The sequencing was performed by AgGenomics Inc., Australia, using a
3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The TempliPhi™ DNA Sequencing Template Amplification system
(GE Healthcare) was used to sequence each clone using
the 5'λ TriplEx2 sequencing primer.
Bioinformatic analyses
Edited sequences were condensed into contigs or singletons using TGICL [70] with the default parameters of 40
bp overlap, a minimum of 95% identity and a 30 bp maximum mismatched overhang. Sequences of less than 100
nt were discarded. Sequences were named using the same
convention as that used for the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni [13]; OvAE for O. viverrini Assembled EST.
Sequences were compared with those available in the
NCBI non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases
using BLASTx and BLASTn. searches, respectively in October 2006. The dbEST database was queried using BLASTn
and tBLASTx searches. BLAST alignments with an E-value
of ≤ 1.0 × 10-5 were reported. OvAEs were functionally categorized by querying a local copy of the Gene Ontology
(GO) database [71] (downloaded November, 2006) with
an E-value cutoff of 1.0 × 10-5. All ESTs from C. sinensis [9]
and Schistosoma japonicum [11,12] were downloaded from
NCBI [72], and the same methodology was used to derive
ontology classifications for the C. sinensis ESTs. ORF predictions were performed using GENSCAN [73] using the

HumanIso parameter set. Signal sequence prediction was
accomplished using SignalP 3.0 [74], incorporating both
hidden Markov models and neural networks. Positive signal sequence predictions from either method and positive
signal anchor predictions using Markov models were
reported. Predictions of transmembrane domains were
conducted using TMPred [75]. All multiple sequence
alignments were carried out using ClustalW. Clan and
family assignments of proteolytic enzymes were analyzed
via the MEROPS protease database [76]. Putative phosphorylation sites were predicted using the NetPhos 2.0
server [77].
Phylogenetic trees
Multiple sequence alignments were assembled using ClustalW. Only regions which completely overlapped with
partial ORFs of O. viverrini ESTs were used for tree construction. Alignments were imported into PAUP version
4.0 beta [78] to construct trees using the neighbour joining and maximum parsimony methods. Robustness was
assessed by bootstrap analysis using 100 replicates. Clades
with more than 50% support were denoted with bootstrap values on the branches.
Cross-taxon similarity analysis
OvAEs were compared with all entries for other organisms
in the NCBI dbEST database using tBLASTx. The highest
BLAST scores (above a cut-off value of 50) were used to
generate SimiTri plots [20] using software developed inhouse (J. Mulvenna, unpublished).
