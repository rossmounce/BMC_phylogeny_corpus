Abstract
Background: In comparative analyses of bacterial pathogens, it has been common practice to
discriminate between two types of genes: (i) those shared by pathogens and their non-pathogenic
relatives (core genes), and (ii) those found exclusively in pathogens (pathogen-specific accessory
genes). Rather than attempting to a priori delineate genes into sets more or less relevant to
pathogenicity, we took a broad approach to the analysis of Streptococcus species by investigating the
strength of natural selection in all clusters of homologous genes. The genus Streptococcus is
comprised of a wide variety of both pathogenic and commensal lineages, and we relate our findings
to the pre-existing knowledge of Streptococcus virulence factors.
Results: Our analysis of 1730 gene clusters revealed 136 cases of positive Darwinian selection,
which we suggest is most likely to result from an antagonistic interaction between the host and
pathogen at the molecular level. A two-step validation procedure suggests that positive selection
was robustly identified in our genomic survey. We found no evidence to support the notion that
pathogen specific accessory genes are more likely to be subject to positive selection than core
genes. Indeed, we even uncovered a few cases of essential gene evolution by positive selection.
Among the gene clusters subject to positive selection, a large fraction (29%) can be connected to
virulence. The most striking finding was that a considerable fraction of the positively selected genes
are also known to have tissue specific patterns of expression during invasive disease. As current
expression data is far from comprehensive, we suggest that this fraction was underestimated.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that pathogen specific genes, although a popular focus of
research, do not provide a complete picture of the evolutionary dynamics of virulence. The results
of this study, and others, support the notion that the products of both core and accessory genes
participate in complex networks that comprise the molecular basis of virulence. Future work
should seek to understand the evolutionary dynamics of both core and accessory genes as a
function of the networks in which they participate.

Background
The large number of complete bacterial genomes in the

public domain (> 390) has opened the way for genomescale studies of pathogenesis, diversity, evolution and

gene function. There has been particular interest in comparative analyses of bacterial pathogens, and especially
studying molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial
adaptation, as such analyses are expected to contribute to
disease prevention and treatment [e.g., [1,2]]. A typical
approach is to discriminate between exclusive subsets of
genes; e.g., genes shared among pathogens and their nonpathogenic relatives (core genes) and those genes showing
presence-absence polymorphisms (accessory genes) [3].
Most studies of pathogenicity have restricted themselves
to pathogen-specific subsets of accessory genes [e.g., [1]].
Only recently has the potential role of core genes in the
evolution of pathogenicity been considered [e.g., [2]].
However, the outcome of dividing genes into exclusive
subsets is sensitive to the particular sample of the
genomes [4], and this could bias an investigation of the
origin and maintenance of bacterial virulence.
This paper focuses on the evolution of genes and gene
families of streptococci. The genus Streptococcus is comprised of a wide variety (about 48 species) of both pathogenic and commensal gram-positive bacteria, which are
found to inhabit a wide range of hosts, including humans,
horses, pigs and cows [5]. Within the host, streptococci
often colonise the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nares
and pharynx, but also inhabit the skin, heart or muscle tissue. Niche or tissue-specific adaptations of streptococci
remain poorly understood [6]. This study includes the
three most important streptococcal human pathogens: S.
pyogenes causes pharyngitis, wound and skin infections,
scarlet and rheumatic fever, pneumonia, necrotising fasciitis, acute glomerulonephritis, cellulitis, and toxic shock
syndrome [7]; S. agalactiae is known mainly for severe
infections in newborns, such as sepsis, meningitis, and
pneumonia, but also causes pneumonia and infections of
bloodstream, skin, and urinary tract in adults [8]; and S.
pneumoniae is a major source for pneumonia, meningitis,
septicaemia, otitis media and sometimes occult bacteremia [9]. Most other streptococci are part of normal human
flora [5], and three such lineages (two S. thermophilus and
one S. mutans) are included in this study. Even within a
nominal species, the genomes of individual strains vary in
size and gene content (Table 1). Undoubtedly, some gene
content variation among the lineages sampled in this
study corresponds to important pathogenic differences
between individual strains. Rather than attempting to a
priori delineate subsets of streptococci genes into sets
more or less relevant to pathogenicity, we adopted an
approach focused on clusters of homologous genes.
Although such clusters will not necessarily contain genes
involved in presence-absence polymorphisms among
pathogenic and non-pathogenic species, they will allow
for a broader investigation of functional divergence
among pathogenic and non-pathogenic lineages of streptococci.

We estimated rates of evolution for gene clusters comprised of known and putative coding regions, categorised
them according to their evolutionary patterns, and identified genes and gene families evolving under positive selection. We found that both core and accessory genes are
subject to evolution by positive selection, most likely in
the form of diversifying selection resulting from the antagonistic interaction between host and parasite. A large fraction of the genes identified as subject to positive selection
have functions that can be connected to virulence. Furthermore, 19% of the positively selected streptococci gene
clusters encode proteins that are known to have body-site
specific expression pattern during invasive disease; a result
which we argue is likely a substantial underestimate.
Taken together, the results of this study and others support the notion that the products of both core and auxiliary genes participate in complex networks that comprise
the molecular basis of virulence, and that evolution of the
participants of such networks contribute significantly to
the dynamics of this phenotype over time.

Results and Discussion
Characteristics of streptococci gene clusters
We partitioned the twelve complete genomes from five
Streptococcus species (Table 1) into 1730 clusters of
homologous gene sequences based on the requirement
that a cluster must be comprised of more than three distinct sequences and meet a sequence similarity threshold
of 50%. When the threshold was lowered to 30%, 1822
homologous gene groups were identified, with 78 of them
obtained by a successive clustering procedure (see methods). Both sets of clusters were subjected to identical data
analysis procedures. Despite the clustering differences, the
results for both sets were consistent: the same conclusions
were drawn from the estimates of evolutionary parameters, and the sets of genes detected to be under positive
selection were very similar. This indicates a level of robustness of our results to the details of the clustering procedure. We therefore show results using the set of
homologous gene clusters based on the 50% similarity
threshold (unless stated otherwise). In this case, the size
of clusters varied from 3 to 59 sequences, and almost a
third of clusters (574) contained at least 12 sequences.
Sequence length ranged from 300 (the lower bound on
our selection criterion) to 4944 nucleotides, the average
being 1027 nucleotides.

As expected, the sampled streptococci genomes were ATrich, with nucleotide content varying among different
codon positions, and among genes and genomes. The
average AT content of the sampled genomes ranged from
60 to 64%, and the average for the gene clusters ranged
from 49–74%. AT content at 2nd and 3rd codon positions
(65% and 68% respectively) was more biased as compared to 1st codon positions (49%). For certain genes AT

content was extremely high at 3rd codon positions while
overall AT content was comparatively low: the majority of
these cases were 30S and 50S ribosomal proteins (rpsA, E,
I, K, M and rplB, D, J, K, L, O, Q) as well as uridine phosphorylase (udp), protein GRAB (known virulence factor),
cell division protein (ftsZ), alcohol dehydrogenase I
(adhA, P, 1), cysteine synthase, O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (cysM, M1, K), triose phosphate isomerase (tpi), cellwall surface anchor family protein and a homologous
cluster containing glucan binding protein (pcsB), secreted
antigen (gbpB/sagA), and general stress protein GSP-781.
Transition/transversion (κ) ratios varied widely among
the gene clusters: 95% of gene clusters had κ between 1
and 20, with the average ratio being 2. At the tails of the
distribution we also found 2.8% of gene clusters with no
transversions (forcing the estimate of κ to the upper
boundary) and 2% of gene clusters with κ < 1. The latter
cases included B-cell receptor associated protein, minor
capsid protein, peptidoglycan hydrolase (mur1), ABC
transporter membrane-spanning permease (fatD; iron
transport), bacterocin transport accessory (bta), oxidoreductase (mocA), acetylglutamate kinase (argB), and pyrroline carboxylate reductase (proC).
We used the cluster-specific gene trees, as estimated by
PHYML [10], as the basis to estimate the mean number of
changes per codon per branch under model M0, as implemented in PAML [11]. In 95% of the clusters the mean
amount of codon evolution was between 0.003 and 8 substitutions per codon site. However, in a small fraction of
clusters (0.5%) we observed either a very low amount of
codon evolution (<0.001 for orthologues from the same
species, S. pyogenes), or a very high amount of codon evolution (>20 due to excess of synonymous substitutions in
orthologues from different species).

Extreme outliers for AT content, transition/transversion
ratio, and high amount of codon evolution are strong candidates for genes having a history of lateral gene transfer
between members of the genus Streptococcus and more distantly related outgroup lineages [e.g., [12,13]]. We note
however, that a large amount of codon evolution might
also arise as a consequence of strong positive Darwinian
selection.
Phylogenomic analysis of evolutionary relationships
among lineages
A subset of the gene clusters were concatenated for the
purpose of obtaining a genome-scale estimate of the Streptococcus phylogeny. We restricted our phylogenetic analysis to the 504 clusters that were comprised of exactly one
gene from each of the 12 genomes, as identified under the
30% threshold. Gene sequences from those 504 clusters
were concatenated (555,297 nucleotides), and a phylogenetic analysis of this dataset resulted in the phylogenetic
tree shown in Figure 1. This genome-scale estimate of relationships among species agrees with some prior estimates
based on smaller molecular datasets [14,15]. The position
of the root can be deduced by using the outgroup species
Lactococcus lactis. Examination of the phylogenies estimated from each of the 504 single-gene clusters revealed
that only 26% matched the species level relationship estimated from the concatenated data. Given such a high
level of among gene variability, and the possibility that
some portion could reflect inter-species recombination
events [e.g., [16]], all subsequent analyses were based on
cluster-specific estimates of the gene tree.

The length of the tree estimated from the concatenated
data was 1.75 nucleotide substitutions per site. Tree
length taken as an average over all the single-copy gene
clusters was biased by the presence of trees with long
lengths, where estimation problems were likely. After
excluding 5% of trees having the largest estimated length,

A genome-scale estimate of phylogenetic relationships
A genome-scale estimate of phylogenetic relationships
among species of Streptococcus. The tree topology is derived
from the joint analysis of 504 single-copy gene sequences by
using the BIONJ algorithm [55]. Each gene was comprised of
exactly one sequence from each of the 12 genomes; the
topology shown above is simplified to show only the relationships among the five nominal species of Streptococcus.
The topology is unrooted, and branch lengths indicate the
mean number of substitutions per codon, as inferred under
codon model M0 [11].

the average tree length was 3.53 nucleotide substitutions
per site, with 95% between 1.4 and 51.2. According to
simulations [17] high accuracy of ML estimation, and the
LRTs, is expected under such levels of sequence divergence. The shortest trees (0.8 to 1.5) were obtained from
30S, 50S ribosomal proteins (rpsB, C, D, G, K, L, M and
rplC, E, N, P, Q, T, V) and translation elongation factors
(tufA, fusA). The longest trees (≥50) were obtained from
membrane-spanning proteins, cell division proteins
(divlC, ftsL), ATP-NAD kinase (ppnK), pantothenate kinase
(coaA), diacylglycerol kinase (dgk, dgkA, dagK), exfoliative
toxin A, exotoxin B (eetB, shetA), 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (aroD), enoyl CoA hydratase II (phaB), and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (idi, fni). For genes of
such high divergences the LRT has almost no power to
detect positive selection, although the Bayesian prediction
of sites under positive selection is expected to be highly
unreliable in such cases [17,18].
A two-step "genome scan" indicates robust identification
of positive selection
Gene clusters identified as subject to positive selection
pressure are listed in Additional file 1. We considered the
signal of positive selection to be strong when both LRTs
(M1a versus M2a and M7 versus M8) were significant at

5%; 38 gene clusters met this criterion (see Additional file
1). An additional 98 gene clusters were identified by the
LRT of models M7 and M8 at the 5% significance level
(see Additional file 1). For the latter cases, it is possible
that model M2a was too conservative to detect positive
selection. Indeed, simulation studies indicate that the LRT
of M1a versus M2a is less powerful than the LRT of M7
versus M8 in such cases [17].
Any genome-scale study that surveys for positive selection
is susceptible to false positives arising from uncertainty in
parameter estimation [17], a history of recombination
[19,20] or from procedural artefacts such as alignment
errors. However, such surveys provide a powerful means
to generate novel biological hypotheses for further experimental and statistical analysis [e.g., [2]]. To assess the
potential impact of such errors on our investigation, we
performed a substantially expanded analysis on a sample
of genes we detected to be evolving under positive selection. To minimise the effect of uncertainty in parameter
estimation, we compiled a larger set of gene sequences. To
avoid potential for procedural artefacts, we analysed the
data "by hand" rather than using our tools to automate
the process; this included careful visual inspection and
editing of the sequence alignments. Lastly, we employed
the methods of Wilson and McVean [21] to evaluate the
possibility of positive selection while simultaneously
allowing for a history of recombination.
Clusters of genes initially identified as subject to positive
selection were pre-screened for those comprised of a small
number of sequences. Eight genes were then randomly
chosen from this subset, conditional on the availability of
additional homologous sequences in GenBank. We chose
the ninth gene, rplS, because positive selection was unexpected, and the tenth gene, IS1191 transposase, because it
is found only in S. thermophilus. All ten datasets were
expanded by sampling homologous sequences from additional lineages of streptococci. We note that the distribution of strains among the streptococcal species was
comparable. Genes subjected to expanded data analyses
are listed in Table 2. Reanalysis under the standard set of
models revealed that all ten datasets retained a signal of
positive selection, six of which were significant at 1%, and
two were significant at 5%, under both of the LRTs (Table
2). The remaining two datasets, rplS and a hypothetical
protein-coding gene homologous to sib38, were significant only under the LRT comparing M7 and M8. We next
employed the approach of Wilson and McVean [21] to
evaluate the possibility that both selection and recombination might have impacted the evolution of these data.
In each case the results of this approach, which does not
suffer from high false positive rates stemming from a history of recombination, confirmed positive Darwinian
selection (data not shown).

The two cases where the LRT comparing models M1a and
M2a failed to detect a signal of positive selection appears
to reflect the greater restrictions on the parameter space of
M1a and M2a as compared with M7 and M8. M1a and
M2a explicitly model a class of purely neutral sites (ω = 1)
although it might not exist in a given data set; in which
case sites having ω = 1 could reflect an artefact of averaging over sites subject to moderate positive selection and
other sites subject to purifying selection. Indeed, when we
examined the parameter estimates under M8 for these two
genes we observed (i) a very large fraction of sites (80%–
82%) were subject to very strong purifying selection (ω ≈
0.006) or moderate purifying selection (ω ranging from
0.11 to 0.36) and (ii) the absence of a purely neutral site
class. These empirical results are consistent with the
results of a simulation study [17] which showed that the
LRT of M1 and M2 are often less powerful than the LRT of
M7 and M8 in similar cases.
In general, by expanding these 10 datasets we increased
the numbers of lineages and levels of sequence divergence
(Table 2) to values where the LRTs are expected to have
low type I error rates [17]. This result, taken together with

robust detection of positive selection (Table 2), suggests
that positive section was reliably identified from our ten
samples of streptococci gene sequences. We note that
large scale surveys for recombination using traditional
detection software [e.g., [22]] are possible, but such programs likely suffer from an inverse effect, i.e. recombination may be falsely detected due to the presence of
positive selection. Unfortunately, it is computationally
prohibitive to carry out the approach of Wilson and
McVean [21] for all genes in a genome. For the time being,
we suggest the two-step process carried out in this study
will provide a valuable means to gauge the robustness of
selected cases obtained from such "genomic scans".
A large fraction of genes subject to positive selection are
connected to virulence
Since both orthologous and paralogous genes can be
included in the same gene cluster, positive selection
detected in a cluster can be a result of various processes:
adaptation of a species to optimise the process of infection, escape host immune response, adaptation to a different environmental niches (e.g., milk in S. thermophilus, or
dental flora in S. mutans), and functional diversification

of members of multi-gene families. Indeed, the 136 clusters identified as having evolved under positive selection
were connected to a wide variety of functions (see Additional file 1), with only 10% having no ascribable function. Interestingly, 7% of the clusters were comprised of
genes known to be essential to S. pneumoniae (see Additional file 1), i.e. those where experimental disruption was
shown to be lethal [23], indicating that even essential
genes can be subject to rapid evolution by natural selection. A substantial fraction of the clusters, (29%) had
either a known, or hypothesised, connection to virulence
in streptococci (see Additional file 1). We considered a
gene to have a connection to virulence if it was related to
survival, spread, or persistence within its human host
[24,25]. In the remainder of this section we focus on a
select subset of the virulence genes subject to positive
selection.
Three genes, grab, endoS, and ideS, are well known to play
a critical role in the ability of pathogenic streptococci to
evade detection by the host immune system. The grab
gene encodes the G-related α2 macroglobulin-binding
protein (GRAB) which functions to inhibit host-mediated
proteolysis, a defence process that is often activated by the
host during invasive infection [26].
GRAB mediates the binding of human α-2M (the dominant proteinase inhibitor of human plasma) to the surface
of S. pyogenes thereby conferring protection against proteolytic degradation of important virulence determinants
[26,27]. EndoS is an extracellular protein, encoded by the
endoS gene, which hydrolyzes N-linked oligosaccharides
on the heavy chains of immunoglobulin G (IgG), thereby
impacting IgG function and preventing opsinising antibodies from triggering a protective immune response to S
pyogenes [28]. The highly specific activity of this endoglycosidase increases pathogen survival in human blood containing opsonising antibodies [28-30]. Finally IdeS (or
streptococcal Mac-1) is a secreted cysteine proteinase that
cleaves the heavy chain of IgG and thereby also inhibits
the susceptibility of S. pyogenes to phagocytosis [31]. The
IdeS protein is specific to IgG antibodies and has been
found to be expressed in clinically important serotypes. In
each case above, the function of the protein is to modulate
a critical host defence molecule. This creates a situation
where an evolutionary arms-race between pathogen and
host is likely, with the host subject to intense selection
pressures to avoid such modulation of its defence systems
by the pathogen. Our finding that each of these genes has
evolved under positive selection pressure is consistent
with such an antagonistic interaction between host and
pathogen at the molecular level, and indicates that such
evolutionary interactions are characteristic of several different systems used by pathogenic streptococci to escape
recognition by the host. In each of the above systems the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/154

positive fitness consequences to the pathogen to winning
such an arms race appears to be increased survival in
human blood [28,31].
Escape from immune recognition is just one aspect of the
ability of a pathogen to successfully invade and colonise
its host. By conducting a genome-scale analysis of positive
selection we identified sets of genes, when taken together
with data derived from alternative methods of investigating virulence factors, provided insights into other potentially important molecular systems connected to
streptococci virulence. For example, heat shock genes
have been connected to bacterial virulence [32-34]. The
products of heat shock genes are typically thought of as
contributing to a protective cellular response to cope with
the stress-induced damage of proteins. As such, many heat
shock proteins are molecular chaperones or ATP-dependent proteases that play important roles in protein folding,
repair, and degradation [34-36]. However, Charpentier
and coworkers [37] also reported that ClpC proteases
plays a major role in processes related to streptococci virulence, including adherence to human cells and production of known virulence factors such as pneumolysin,
autolysin A, CbpA, and other choline binding proteins.
Recently, Ibrahim et al. [34] suggested ClpC may play a
major role in the virulence of S. pneumoniae. Consistent
with a potentially important role in virulence, we found
ATP-dependent proteases encoded by the clpL, clpC genes
have evolved under positive selection pressure. We note
that a signature-tagged mutagenesis screen of S. pneumoniae also identified ClpC as a virulence factor [38], and
that ClpC has been shown to contribute to the ability of
S. pneumoniae to grow in the lungs and blood [34]. Interestingly, we identified several other genes known to have
a role in responding to stress conditions (relA, gls24 and
atpD/atpB) as having evolved under positive selection.
Efficient genome replication is essential for growth and
survival of an organism, and polymerase complexes often
fail to complete this task [39,40]. For some pathogenic
bacteria this is especially important, as successful replication is thought to contribute to proliferation and efficiency of the colonisation of hostile environments [e.g.,
[41,42]]. Interestingly, we detected positive selection in
several single-copy protein-coding genes connected to
replication, recombination and repair proteins (singlecopy genes recG, recN, recR, recM), and in two ribosomal
proteins (rpsB and rplS) and two DNA-dependent RNA
polymerases (rpoC and rpoB). Replication forks often
stall and may collapse to generate new DNA ends that provoke recombination and induce genomic rearrangements
[40,43]. Complete replication of the genome depends
therefore on repair activities to remove or bypass lesions
in the DNA, modulation of RNA polymerase to reduce
conflicts with transcription, and recombination systems

to rescue forks that have stalled or collapsed. In these cases
the nature of selection pressure is far from clear. Selection
pressure on these genes could reflect constraints on efficient genome replication during colonisation and proliferation in the hostile environment of the host [e.g.,
[41,42]], or perhaps the ability to recombine during
mixed colonisation by unrelated strains [e.g., [44]]. Neither is it known if these genes might be involved in an
antagonistic interaction between host and pathogen at the
molecular level.
Generally speaking, our genome-scale analysis of streptococci protein-coding genes uncovered a wide array of clusters that can be connected to virulence and which are
subject to positive selection pressure. In some cases the
nature of the selection pressure seems clear, e.g., grab,
endoS, and ideS described above. We documented other
cases where we identified genes previously hypothesised
to play an important role in virulence but where current
data were not conclusive. Yet another example of this is
the two-component signal transduction systems mediated
by histidine kinase; they are integral parts of bacterial cellular regulatory processes, and are used to regulate the
expression of genes involved in virulence [25,45]. We
identified five clusters comprised of genes from two-component response regulation systems, with two cases (ihk
and ciaR) having been previously hypothesised to play an
important role in virulence [34,46,47]. We believe that
large-scale analyses such as ours play an important role in
highlighting particular molecular systems that warrant
further study. Finally, there were some cases where the
nature of selection pressure was unclear, e.g., replication,
recombination and repair proteins recG, recN, recR, recM
described above. Identification of such genes helps to generate new hypotheses concerning the role of different
molecular systems in virulence.
Both the accessory genome and the core genome are
subject to positive Darwinian selection
A typical approach to studying the evolution of pathogenicity is to focus on the subset of genes found exclusively in the genomes of pathogens [e.g., [1]]. Hereafter
we refer to these genes as pathogen-specific accessory
genes. Clearly the acquisition of such accessory genes by
lateral gene transfer (LGT) plays an important role in the
acquisition of characteristics necessary for a pathogenic
lifestyle [e.g., [1,3]]. Since pathogens are typically
involved in a co-evolutionary arms race with their hosts
[48], one might expect pathogen-specific accessory genes
are more likely to be subject to diversifying selection.
Indeed, a recent study suggested that among recently
transferred genes in S. pyogenes there is a higher relative
frequency of positive selection [15]. To test if this notion
is broadly applicable to all pathogen-specific genes we
compared clusters of pathogen-specific accessory genes to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/154

clusters of core genes (clusters comprised of exactly one of
each lineage of Streptococcus). Indeed, there were more
pathogen-specific clusters (692) than core-gene clusters
(526); however, the ratio of significant to non-significant
cases for positive selection did not differ significantly
between the pathogen-specific (44/648) and core gene
clusters (41/485), as indicated by a Fisher's exact test (P =
0.364). We also tested pathogen-specific accessory genes
against non-pathogen specific accessory genes, and found
no evidence for a significant difference (P = 0.761). We
note that a fraction of these gene clusters are likely have
been impacted by gene duplication and deletion events,
as well as by LGT.
Marri et al. [15] found that the relative frequency of positive selection was 3 fold higher in recently transferred
genes in S. pyogenes as compared to core genes. As S. pyogenes causes a wider variety of human diseases than any
other bacterial species, and possesses the largest number
lineage-specific genes (381), we wanted to investigate the
possibility that S. pyogenes also has a greater frequency of
positive selection among its unique accessory genes. A chisquare test indicated that the odds of positive selection
did not differ significantly among clusters of accessory
genes unique to a given species of Streptococcus (χ2 =
5.122, df = 4, P = 0.275). To minimise the impact of gene
duplication and deletion, and to make a more direct comparison to the study of LGT by Marri et al. [15], we identified the clusters comprised of exactly one of each of the
five sampled lineages of S. pyogenes and absent for all the
other genomes under study. The relative frequency of positive selection was similar in both the single-copy S. pyogenes accessory genes (17/207) and in the streptococci
core gene clusters (41/526), being about 8%. We note that
Marri et al. [15] employed the same LRT (M7 against M8)
to identify positively selected genes. It appears that the
finding of higher odds of positive selection among
recently transferred genes [15] could be sensitive to the
method of assembly and classification of gene clusters.
As functional category has been shown to be related to
selection pressure [49], we investigated the possibility that
functional category could have been a confounding factor
in our tests for heterogeneity between pathogen-specific
gene clusters and core gene clusters. We subdivided clusters among 6 functional categories based on COG assignments and computed the odds of positive selection for
pathogen-specific accessory gene clusters and core gene
clusters (Table 3). Although the highest odds of positive
selection among the pathogen-specific clusters was associated with cellular processes and signalling, the odds ratio
for this functional category was 1.04, indicating that a
high frequency of positive selection also occurred among
the core gene clusters in this category. The highest odds
ratio in favour of pathogen-specific accessory genes (2.92)

did not differ significantly from one (Table 3). Indeed, the
only category in which the odds of positive selection differed significantly between pathogen-specific accessory
genes and core genes was for metabolism; and, in this case
the odds of positive selection were higher for core gene
clusters (Table 3).

evolution are plausible, such as a burst of adaptive evolution in an accessory gene following an LGT event or long
term divergent selection pressure between pathogenic and
non-pathogenic lineages of streptococci, but they are not
detectible by using the codon models employed in this
study.

Our findings clearly indicate that the genes involved in
presence-absence polymorphism among lineages of streptococci do not provide a complete picture of the nature of
pathogen evolution within this genus, as core gene clusters have a similar propensity for positive selection pressure as pathogen-specific gene clusters. The properties of
the analytical models used in this study provide some
insight into this finding. LRTs based on the site-models we
used are best suited to the discovery of genes having rapid
amino acid change over long periods of time [e.g., [17]].
Among streptococci, this is most likely to arise in response
to the antagonistic evolutionary arms-race between pathogen and host. As such an evolutionary interaction leads
to diversifying selection pressure, where fitness advantages are conferred by possessing an allele that is merely
different from others in the population; the 136 genes
identified as subject to positive selection pressure are the
best candidates for such a mode of evolution. Hence, our
results reflect that Streptococcus pathogen evolution may
be thought of having at least two components: (i) the
acquisition by LGT of accessory genes that confer characteristics necessary for a pathogenic lifestyle, and (ii) the
long term evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen that impacts the evolution of certain core and accessory genes. We note that other modes of adaptive

A large fraction of positively selected genes have tissue
specific patterns of expression
In vivo gene expression studies of invasive disease have
provided insights into the response of bacteria to the host
during the course of infection by revealing that known virulence factors, along with other types of genes, display
body-site specific expression patterns [6,50]. Such knowledge has lead to prediction that several streptococci genes
of unknown function contribute to virulence, with these
predictions being confirmed by experimentation [6].
However, extensive body-site specific contributions to
pathogenesis make it difficult to determine if there is a
core set of virulence-related genes required by all streptococci, or how extensive such a set of genes might be. Given
such variability, we were interested to determine (i) what
fraction of positively selected genes, if any, exhibited
body-site specific patterns of gene expression during invasive disease, and (ii) if the intensity of selection might
depend on their putative cellular role, as defined by level
of gene expression.

We obtained expression data from the large-scale analysis
of S. pneumoniae by Orihuela et al. [6] which provides data
for expression levels within infected blood (IB), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and epithelial cell contact (ECC). Taken

Notes: The odds of positive selection were computed as the relative frequently of genes under positive selection divided by the relative frequency
of genes not under positive selection. The odds ratio is simply the ratio of the odds of positive selection in two different categories of genes. The
categories were based on functional assignments found in the COG database. The hypothesis that an odds ratio differed from one was tested by
using the Fisher's exact test.

over all tissue types, 26 (19%) of the positively selected
gene clusters encode proteins that are known to have
body-site specific expression. However, the expression
data is derived only from S. pneumoniae, and patterns of
gene expression are thought to vary among pathogens.
Interestingly, when we excluded the 47 gene clusters that
did not contain at least one representative of S. pneumoniae, we found that the relative frequency of genes with
body-site specific expression increased to 29%. The results
are presented according to tissue-type in Figure 2. These
data suggest a disparity among tissue types on the intensity of diversifying selection pressure, in so far as there
were more positively selected genes having altered expression in CSF and ECC tissue types than in the other categories (Figure 2). Note that all the genes contributing to
Figure 2 have >2 fold difference in tissue specific expression levels during invasive disease [6].
Current expression data is far from comprehensive, as it
does not cover all body sites, variability among lineages of
pathogens, nor even cover all the genes of S. pneumoniae.
For this reason, we expect that we have underestimated
the numbers of positively selected genes that have bodysite specific expression during invasive disease. Large scale
studies of expression level, signature tagged mutagenesis,
and differential fluorescence induction are beginning to
reveal that virulence is a function of a network of genes
[e.g., [6,50,51]], many participants being core genes that
are not well characterised. Indeed, our finding that core
genes, and even essential genes, can be subject to an
antagonistic evolutionary arms-race between pathogen
and host also highlights the need to gain a better understanding of the role core gene products have in virulence.
We look forward to the time when gene networks are better understood, particularly with respect to lineage-specific alterations in the pattern of transcription during
invasive disease. An understanding of the evolutionary
dynamics of virulence factors in such a context offers the
potential to identify previously unappreciated targets for
vaccines or pharmaceuticals [6,51].

by allowing colonisation of a new niche) such that selective pressures acting on core gene products are impacted.
As we gain a better understating of how niche specialisation, and pathogenicity in particular, is a function of networks of genes, we can begin to understand the
evolutionary dynamics of individual core and auxiliary
genes as a function of the networks in which they participate. The findings of this study, and others [e.g., [6,25]],
suggest that the origin and evolution of the molecular
mechanisms that result in enhanced virulence are more
complex than previously thought.

Methods
Conclusion
Based on our genome-wide analysis of selection pressure,
we argue that the evolution of pathogen specific genes,
although a popular focus of research, does not provide a
complete picture of the evolutionary dynamics of virulence. There is no doubt that the acquisition of novel
genes by LGT is critical to the colonisation and exploitation of novel niches, including the pathogenic lifestyle.
However, those genes acquired by LGT impinge upon a
complex network of interactions among gene products
embedded in cellular metabolism. The effect of an LGT
could be wide-spread in that the acquired gene or genes
could have direct interactions with core gene products or
result in an altered cellular environment (perhaps simply

Data, homologue clustering, and alignment
Twelve complete genomes of five Streptococcus species
(available in Genbank) were analyzed in this paper: five
strains of S. pyogenes (NC_004070, NC_003485,
NC_002737, NC_006086, NC_004606), two strains of S.
agalactiae (NC_004368, NC_004116), two strains of S.
pneumoniae (NC_003098, NC_003028), one strain of S.
mutans (NC_004350), and two strains of S. thermophilus
(NC_006448, NC_006449). Table 1 summarises the key
details of the sampled genomes. All known and putative
codon regions longer than 100 codons were extracted
from the genomes and the correct reading frame was preserved (i.e., every sequence started with the first codon
position). None of the extracted sequences contained in-

frame stop codons, and stop codons at the end of the
sequences were deleted. The amino acid library was created by translating each DNA coding sequence into an
amino acid sequence. We separated the amino acid
sequences into homologous clusters by using BLASTCLUST program [52], which finds pairs of sequences that
have statistically significant matches (using the BLAST
algorithm) and groups them using single-linkage clustering. Two distinct sets of homologous clusters were produced based on minimum 30% and 50% similarity.
Other clustering criteria were: 90% minimum length coverage and 10-6 cut-off e-value. As a result, each cluster can
contain both orthologous and paralogous sequences.
Both sets of clusters were analysed using the procedure
described below.
Each cluster of amino acid sequences was aligned using TCoffee [53]. The alignments were based on BLOSUM62
matrix with gap opening and gap extension penalties -5
and -2 respectively. Codon alignments were created from
the amino acid alignments by inserting three-nucleotide
gaps into corresponding DNA sequences. Only clusters
with at least three sequences were used for further analyses. Summary statistics were collected using PAUP*4.0
[54], and ML trees were reconstructed from DNA data
using a heuristic search implemented in PHYML [10].
Assessment of alignments
The set of clusters based on 30% similarity threshold were
more divergent; consequently, for some large clusters
alignments were problematic. In contrast, even the largest
clusters based on the 50% similarity had acceptable alignments. In the absence of an objective universal score to
compare alignments of different datasets, we chose the 15
largest alignments and visually inspected them for problems. Additionally, alignments for gene clusters from the
highest divergence were visually inspected. All problematic alignments were discarded, and the involved data
clusters were sub-clustered using BLASTCLUST with a
higher similarity threshold. The similarity threshold was
increased gradually with a step of 5% until a non-trivial
sub-clustering was achieved. Sequences in new sub-clusters were re-aligned using procedures described above.
These new alignments of sub-clusters were used in subsequent analyses.
Species phylogeny
To investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the sampled strains of streptococci, we concatenated alignments
from the 504 data sets which were created by using the
30% similarity threshold and which contained exactly
one gene sequence from each of the 12 genomes. Such
homologous clusters represent putative single-copy genes.
The resultant 556,899 nucleotide-long alignment was
used to reconstruct a NJ tree using fast BIONJ algorithm

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/154

[55]. The branch lengths were estimated using the oneratio codon model (M0) from PAML [11].
Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses
The codeml program from the PAML [11] package was
used for ML analyses based on Markov models of codon
evolution. Branch lengths of the inferred ML trees, measured by number of expected nucleotide changes per
codon, were estimated by using the simplest model M0
and then fixed in all further ML analyses to shorten the
computational time. Model M0 assumes constant selective pressure across codon sites and over time. The selective pressure at the protein level was measured by ω, the
ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous rates dN/dS, with
ω < 1, = 1, or > 1 indicating conserved, neutral or adaptive
evolution respectively [e.g., [56]]. Models M1a, M2a, M7,
and M8 of variable selective pressure across codon sites
were used to estimate selective pressure and test for positive selection [57-59]. These models differ by the statistical distribution assumed for the ω ratio. For each
homologous cluster, we performed two likelihood ratio
tests (LRTs) for positive selection, comparing models that
allow sites with ω > 1 (alternatives M2a and M8) with simpler models that do not (null models M1a and M7).
Model M1a (nearly-neutral) assumes two site classes in
proportions p0 and p1 = 1 - p0: one with ω0 ratio estimated
between 0 and 1, and the other with ω1 fixed at 1. Alternative model M2a (positive selection) extends the null
model M1a by adding a proportion p2 of positively
selected sites with ω2 > 1, estimated from data. In the second LRT the alternative model M8 (beta&ω) extends the
null model M7 (beta) by adding to the beta distribution
for ω (defined on the interval [0, 1]), an extra class of sites
under positive selection with ω > 1. To ensure convergence to the best likelihood, all analyses were performed
three times. The analyses took 3–4 weeks on linux cluster
comprised of 10 × 2.4 GHz AMD Opteron processors.

The minimum number of sequences for informative analysis depends on the divergence levels. Based on computer
simulations [17], reasonable statistical power can be
achieved with as few as 4 – 5 genomes for cases having
divergences similar to those observed among Streptococcus
strains.
Note that comparison of the absolute rate of synonymous
(dS) or nonsynoymous (dN) substitutions among genes
could be impacted by the way codon frequencies are handled [69]. However, it was not the purpose of this study to
make quantitative comparisons among the genes; rather
we sought simply to identify genes that had a history of
positive diversifying selection. In this context, the interpretation of the dN/dS ratio should not have been affected
[70]. In the case of LGT, extreme values for nucleotide
content reflect differences in the equilibrium state of the

donor and recipient genomes involved in the LGT event.
The biggest factor for such genes will be a very large estimate of the amount of codon evolution among those lineages. As noted in Results and Discussion, a large amount
of codon evolution is compatible with both the hypothesis of LGT and strong positive Darwinian selection.
