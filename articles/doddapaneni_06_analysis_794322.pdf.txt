Abstract
Background: The Gram-negative, xylem-limited phytopathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa is
responsible for causing economically important diseases in grapevine, citrus and many other plant
species. Despite its economic impact, relatively little is known about the genomic variations among
strains isolated from different hosts and their influence on the population genetics of this pathogen.
With the availability of genome sequence information for four strains, it is now possible to perform
genome-wide analyses to identify and categorize such DNA variations and to understand their
influence on strain functional divergence.
Results: There are 1,579 genes and 194 non-coding homologous sequences present in the
genomes of all four strains, representing a 76. 2% conservation of the sequenced genome. About
60% of the X. fastidiosa unique sequences exist as tandem gene clusters of 6 or more genes. Multiple
alignments identified 12,754 SNPs and 14,449 INDELs in the 1528 common genes and 20,779 SNPs
and 10,075 INDELs in the 194 non-coding sequences. The average SNP frequency was 1.08 × 10-2
per base pair of DNA and the average INDEL frequency was 2.06 × 10-2 per base pair of DNA. On
an average, 60.33% of the SNPs were synonymous type while 39.67% were non-synonymous type.
The mutation frequency, primarily in the form of external INDELs was the main type of sequence
variation. The relative similarity between the strains was discussed according to the INDEL and
SNP differences. The number of genes unique to each strain were 60 (9a5c), 54 (Dixon), 83 (Ann1)
and 9 (Temecula-1). A sub-set of the strain specific genes showed significant differences in terms
of their codon usage and GC composition from the native genes suggesting their xenologous origin.
Tandem repeat analysis of the genomic sequences of the four strains identified associations of
repeat sequences with hypothetical and phage related functions.
Conclusion: INDELs and strain specific genes have been identified as the main source of variations
among strains, with individual strains showing different rates of genome evolution. Based on these
genome comparisons, it appears that the Pierce's disease strain Temecula-1 genome represents the
ancestral genome of the X. fastidiosa. Results of this analysis are publicly available in the form of a
web database.

Background
Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is responsible for causing economically important diseases in grapevine, citrus and many
other plant species. Foremost among these are Pierces's
disease (PD) of grapevine, citrus variegated chlorosis
(CVC), and leaf scorch diseases in almond (ALS) and oleander (OLS) [1-3]. Due to its potential threat to US agriculture, X. fastidiosa (CVC strain) is included in the Federal
government's select agent list [4]. The CVC strain (9a5c)
was the first plant pathogenic bacterium whose genome
was completely sequenced [5]. This was followed by publication of draft sequences of the genomes of Dixon
(almond) and Ann1 (oleander) [6] and the complete
sequence of the genome of the PD-associated Temecula-1
strain [7]. To date, emphasis of the above published
research has been on the functional reconstruction and
deciphering the metabolic pathways.
Comparative genome sequencing of bacteria is a powerful
means of detecting sequence diversity among closely
related, but distinct populations. Comparative wholegenome information about strain specific DNA variation
will have important implications for the development of
new molecular markers for detection, pathovar classification, disease epidemiology and understanding evolutionary relationships. Using whole genome sequences of four
X. fastidiosa strains, we conducted sequence analyses for
genome-wide DNA- based variations that presumably are
critically important in strain divergence, host specificity
and pathogenicity.
Currently, genetic variation using markers such as the
16S-23S rRNA spacer region [8], simple sequence repeat
markers or Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTRs)
that are capable of differentiating among, and within,
host-associated strains exists [9,10]. However, information on DNA based variations in the coding and non-coding regions and information on SNPs (Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) of
one to several hundred base pairs, thus far have not been
studied. Such information is extremely valuable for
understanding the epidemiology of this bacterium which
has specific host preference and pathogenicity [11]. In
nature, pathogen populations with high genetic diversity
have high evolutionary potential and thus are more likely
to overcome host genetic resistance than pathogen populations with low genetic diversity. The resulting changes in
population structure or virulence can lead to resistance
breakdown. This is particularly true in agricultural production systems in which mono-culture is a common
practice. Under these conditions, the frequency of pathogen genotypes with increased virulence may increase and
ultimately lead to resistance breakdown and increased
disease incidence. Therefore, availability of such genomic
information on coding and non-coding- polymorphic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/225

loci will help in linking variability in pathogenicity of different strains to differences in their genetic backgrounds
and monitoring changes in their genetic diversity.
INDELs are important events in establishing genomic variations between similar strains [12]. There are numerous
mechanisms by which INDELs are formed, such as the
DNA recombination, expansion of repetitive DNA
sequences and insertion sequence (IS)-mediated events.
INDELs serve as reliable signature sequences and have a
definite advantage over the traditional phylogenetic analyses based on the gene or protein sequences due to the fact
that the traditional analysis derives phylogenetic relationships assuming constant mutation frequency, which is
incorrect over long periods of time, leading to incorrect
species relationships [13]. On the other hand, conserved
INDELs of defined sizes are not greatly affected by such
differences in evolutionary rates [14]. Among bacterial
species, INDELs have been identified as the principal
source of genome variability in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex [15].
Another important factor that contributes to genomic variations is the occurrence of Single Nucleotide polymorphs
(SNPs). SNPs have extremely low mutation frequency and
are less prone to homoplasty when compared to other
molecular markers, making them extremely valuable for
phylogenetic analyses. SNPs have been effectively used in
drawing evolutionary relationships of Bacillus anthracis,
the causative organism of anthrax, with extremely low
strain variability [16]. A total of 990 SNP markers
genome-wide were used in their study. Recently, SNPs
were found to be of invaluable source in tracing the
worldwide spread of pathogenic Mycobacterium leprae, the
causative organism of leprosy [17]. Apart from the phylogenetic analysis, SNPs have been identified as functional
tools in linking the DNA variations in the promoter of the
nitrate reductase gene cluster narGHJI to the observed differences in the nitrate reductase activity of M. tuberculosis
and M. bovis [18] and in showing a link between DNA variability in the gyrA gene to Salmonella enterica strains resistance to quinolones [19].
There are several means by which bacteria can acquire
genes: conjugal transfer, phage-mediated insertions and
the uptake of native DNA from the outside sources
[20,21]. While not all the genes that are introduced are
retained, there are numerous instances where the stable
introductions have been shown to play a pivotal role in
the evolution of niche-adaptive and pathogenic characteristics of bacterial species, and thus greatly influence interstrain differences in gene complement [20,22,23]. In certain instances, 10–20% of the genes are estimated to have
been laterally transferred [24]. Xenologues have been
identified in the past based on criteria, such as G+C con-

The present study was undertaken to identify and characterize the macro (present or absent), medium (Tandem
repeat variations) and micro (SNPs and INDELs) -level
differences from coding and non-coding regions among
the four published X. fastidiosa strain genomes leading to
disease development, and for use in development of
improved pathogen diagnostic and epidemiological tools.
The results of this study are available through our database.

Results and discussion
Global comparative analysis of the X. fastidiosa genomes
There are 1,579 homologous genes representing 87 families and 194 non-coding sequences in all the four X. fastidiosa strains, which account for 76.2% and 3.6%,
respectively, of the total genome size. Of these, 108 conserved genes (6.8%) are unique to X. fastidiosa (see Addi-

tional file 1). The number of strain specific unique genes
in each strain varied from 10 to 241 and that of non-coding (intergenic) sequences from 68 to 147 (Fig. 1). The
CVC-associated strain 9a5c genome (241 genes) had the
highest number of strain specific genes followed by Ann1
(145 genes), Dixon (96 genes) and Temecula-1 (10 genes)
genomes (Table 1) (Fig. 1). A fraction of these strain specific genes when BLAST searched against the NCBI database did not show a hit, suggesting that these are also
unique to that strain with no known homology to the
sequenced bacterial genomes [Temecula-1 (9), Dixon
(54), Ann1 (83) and 9a5c (60)].
Gene families and functional classification
In order to provide a comparable and uniform functional
gene classification of all the four strains, the genes were
classified based on MIPS [26]. The published 9a5c and
Temecula-1 functional assignments [27] were based on a
BLAST similarity search followed by the functional assignment similar to the Escherichia coli classification [5,7]. On
the other hand, the Integrative Genomics [28] classified
the other three strains (9a5c, Ann1 and Dixon) using their
ERGO suit [6]. This prompted us to use the MIPS functional assignment for all four strains.

The 1,579 conserved genes could be grouped into 87 functional categories. Further, these 87 categories could be
merged to represent 16 major functional categories (Fig.
2). A total of 1,476 (93.5%) of these conserved homologous genes are also present in other organisms. These
genes are involved in cellular activities such as metabolism, protein synthesis, cell cycle and other house keeping
activities.
Pair wise SNP and INDEL analysis
There are 12,754 SNPs and 14,449 INDELs in the common genes and 20,779 SNPs and 10,075 INDELs in the
194 non-coding sequences. The average mutation frequency for conserved genes among the six compared
groups was 3.93%, which equals to one mutation for
every 25 to 26 nucleotides. Pair-wise analysis showed that
for strains of 9a5c, Ann1 and Dixon, the lowest mutation
frequency was obtained when each of them was compared
with Temecula-1, which indicates a closer phylogeny relationship of these strains to Temecula-1. INDELs occurred
at 53.1% (812) of the total genes, and SNPs occurred in
every gene (Table 2).

There are 1,579 genes that are conserved in all the four
strains; the remaining genes show different degrees of overlap. The full sets of results are available at the website [41].

The average SNP frequency was 1.08 × 10-2 per base pair,
which translates to approximately one SNP for every 93
bp of the DNA. The average INDEL frequency was 2.06 ×
10-2 per base pair, which translates to approximately one
INDEL for every 30 bp of DNA (Table 2).

according to the MIPS system.

To identify the relationship of SNPs and INDELs with the
overall mutation frequency, a comparison between SNP
frequency, INDEL frequency and the overall mutation frequency was carried out (Fig. 3). Clearly, the overall muta-

tion frequency is closely associated with INDEL
frequency. On average, 66.50% mutations were due to
INDELs with varying degrees among the four strains. The
minimum INDEL percentage (1.034%) was found in the

genome alignment of 9a5c and Temecula-1, while the
maximum (4.049%) was observed in the genome alignment of 9a5c and Dixon (Table 2). Compared to INDELs,
the percentage of SNPs was constant for the groups studied. The maximum difference observed was less than 0.7%
(Table 2).
Based to their location, two types of INDELs were defined:
internal INDELs, located between the start and stop
codons; and external INDELs, located before the stop
codon and/or after the stop codon. It is interesting that the
majority of INDELs (96.7 %) are of external type (Fig. 4).
Another interesting finding was that 11.8% (180) of the
conserved genes contain internal INDELs whose number
is not a multiple of 3, indicating that these INDELs cause
frame shift mutations (see Additional file 2).
SNPs were defined according to their nucleotide types as
transversion or transition types. On average, 85.2% of
SNPs are transversion type suggesting that transversion
was the major type of SNP in X. fastidiosa (Fig. 5). Synonymous vs non-synonymous SNPs, were next identified
between the above homologous genes. However, for this

analysis, those gene pairs that shows internal INDELs that
cause frame shift mutations were not included. The results
show that on an average, 60.33% of the SNPs cause synonymous changes while 39.67% cause non-synonymous
changes (Table 3).
Recently, Lin et al. [10] reported multi-locus X. fastidiosa
genetic analysis system based on 34 Simple Sequence
Repeat (SSR) loci. Diversity analysis based on 83 Xf strains
from four geographical locations of the California: Napa,
Sonoma, Kern and Riverside counties suggests that genetic
differentiation of Xf was partly driven by the host selection. Strain divergence in X. fastidiosa was also recently
reported using Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) of
seven to ten loci [29].
Significant and important information regarding strain
diversity and dispersal has been obtained using the above
markers. However, due to their very nature, the percentage
of genome analyzed for drawing the conclusions in these
studies is limited. For instance, MLST is currently the most
reliable and widely used molecular marker for defining
sequence types (ST) among bacterial species. In principle,

STs are defined based on the variations in a selected set of
housekeeping genes. However, a major limitation factor
of MLST stems from the fact that two isolates with the
same ST may differ in regions that are subjected to highfrequency transposition or site-specific recombination
events that are out side the target locus.

This genome-wide SNP survey is potentially useful as a
routine, high-throughput screening tool to identify potential disease outbreaks and appearance of strain variants.
Moreover, SNPs offer development of linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks that are several fold denser that those
defined by the Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). Gene-based
locus-specific SNPs could provide possible linkage
between phenotype and genotype; therefore, such SNPs
can be used for functional genotyping.
INDELs play a major role in causing sequence divergence
between closely related DNA sequences in animal, plants,
insects and bacteria [12]. Our analysis supports this
hypothesis. Further, our analysis showed that external
INDELs are the major cause for the observed strain differences in X. fastidiosa, similar to that observed in the mycobacterial species complex diversification [15]. The
observed results suggest that X. fastidiosa adapts to its environment by using different transcription initiation points.
In 61.01% of the observed internal INDELs, the number
of missing nucleotides is not a multiple of three. Such
internal INDELs, would result in a frame shift mutation,
thus providing another mechanism of gene regulation in

this bacterium. Similarly, the four sequenced genomes
carry strains specific genes, some of which are unique to
those strains. A majority of these genes code for hypothetical proteins followed by gene showing homology to the
plasmid, phage and IS related genes. Further functional
studies are required to understand the full significance of
the presence of these genes in these strain genomes. In
conclusion, our results showed that both external and
internal INDELs causing frame shift mutations and strains
specific genes are the major sources of strain divergence in
X. fastidiosa and possibly for the observed host specificity.
On the other hand, functional fingerprinting assays are
required to fully understand the significance of the SNPs
identified in both coding and non-coding regions.
Inter-relatedness of the X. fastidiosa strains
Analysis of the conserved genes using pair-wise comparison, clearly showed that Temecula-1 has the least deviation (unpaired nucleotide percentage) from the other
three strains- 9a5c, Ann1 and Dixon, with 9a5c and
Temecula-1 strains being the closest of the three pairs.
From Table 2, it can be inferred that the hierarchy of relative similarities between strains is: 9a5c+Temecula-1 >
Ann1+Temecula-1 >> Ann1+Dixon > Dixon+Temecula-1
>> 9a5c+Ann1 > 9a5c+Dixon (Table 2). ">>" identifies

the degree of observed differences that were supported by
ANOVA analysis with Duncan grouping (Table 2). As
mentioned previously, the strain comparison was largely
influenced by INDELs, with external INDELs being the
major type. Similar overall strain relationship conclusion
was also observed when internal INDELs alone were compared, with 9a5c showing the least deviation from Ann1
and Temecula-1, 0.039 and 0.044 respectively (Table 2).
However, pair-wise comparisons based on SNPs alone
showed a different trend, with the three North American
strains showing least strain variability (Table 2). The
strain relationship based on SNPs alone can be concluded
as: Ann1+ Temecula-1 > Ann1+ Dixon > Dixon+Temecula-1 > 9a5c + Dixon > 9a5c + Ann1 > 9a5c + Temecula-1.
In this study, we systemically compared all the conserved
genes in the four strains of X. fastidiosa. Our result of interrelatedness supports the previous whole genome comparison result of three strains of this bacterium [6]. We found
that among the 1528 genes that are conserved in all the
four strains, the Temecula-1 gene set had the lowest mutation frequency (Table 2) when compared to the other
three strain sets, suggesting that Temecula-1 had diversified at a slower rate. Based on this analysis and four-way

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:225

comparison results showing that Temecula-1 has the lowest number of strain specific genes, it appears that Temecula-1 has undergone the fewest genetic changes of the four
strains and may represent the ancestral Xylella fastidiosa
genome. Interestingly, a close similarity between 9a5c
genome and Temecula-1 genome, as revealed by the
ANOVA analysis (Table 2) indirectly suggests the possible
origination of 9a5c from Temecula-1, as a recent event.
Due to the presence of highest number of strain specific
genes, we can also conclude that 9a5c is evolving at a
faster rate than the other three strains. While the conclusions appear paradoxical, the explanation could be the
adaptive, divergence of these strains from an ancestral
strain like Temecula, with different rates, as evident by the
number of strain specific genes. Further, our results did
not show a biogeographic distribution pattern of strain
variability, an observation, also made by others [30].
It is interesting to find that the relationship based on total
unpaired nucleotide percentage is contrary to that based
on SNP. Schuenzel and others [30] constructed a phylogeny tree of Xylella fastidiosa using 10 genes. The relationship disclosed by this tree has similarities to our result
based on SNP analysis while the result based on total
unpaired nucleotide analysis as well as the INDEL analysis
differ to their result. This is not surprising as SNPs were
the focus of their phylogenetic study and not the INDELs.
Further, 9a5c was assumed to be the out-group of the phylogenetic tree; second, sequence information of a limited
number of the genes (7) were used for phylogenetic tree
construction. As our results indicate, INDELs are the
major source of variation in X. fastidiosa (Fig. 3), with
external INDELs playing a key role (Fig. 4).
Highly conserved genes among the four strains
Since the 16S or 23S rDNA sequences are well conserved
in most organisms, they are frequently used as targets for
primer design for PCR detection [31], especially where
genome information on the organism is limited. However, currently, there is sequence information on four of
the X. fastidiosa strains that provides an opportunity to
identify other conserved genes. Our analysis shows that
while X. fastidiosa 16S or 23S rDNA sequences are highly
conserved among the four strains, there are many other
genes that show similar or higher levels of sequence conservation among the four strains and more importantly,
are unique to X. fastidiosa thereby eliminating the chances
of cross contamination or false positives in detection studies (see Additional file 3). This gene list could provide
additional reliable primer design targets for X. fastidiosa
detection and quantification.
Tandem gene clusters unique to Xylella fastidiosa
A similarity search of the coding sequences of the two
completely sequenced genomes against the genomes of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/225

other sequenced bacteria showed that the 9a5c has 989
genes and Temecula-1 genome has 395 genes that are
unique to X. fastidiosa with no known homology to any
other sequenced bacterial genomes.
Analysis of spatial organization of the above gene sets
revealed that in strain 9a5c, 633 genes out of the 989
genes are grouped into 46 gene clusters (~0.523 Mb) (see
Additional file 4), while in strain Temecula-1, 282 genes
out of 395 are grouped into 23 gene clusters (~0.264 Mb)
(see Additional file 5). The average number of genes in
each cluster was 13.7 in 9a5c and 12.2 in Temecula-1. The
average cluster size was 14.27 kb in 9a5c and 11.49 kb in
Temecula-1. As accessed using a BLAST Evalue=e-05, with
few exceptions, in majority of the clusters, there was no
homology between member genes, which suggest that
those clusters are not formed as a result of tandem duplication events (see Additional files 4 &5).
The majority of the unique gene clusters consists of either
hypothetical proteins or phage-related proteins. However,
there are a few pathogenicity-related protein gene clusters.
A 7-kb region of 9a5c contains six X. fastidiosa specific fulllength open reading frames (ORFs) involved in pili biogenesis (Fig. 6A). This cluster was first reported in the
Temecula-1 strain [32]. Our analysis found that there is a
complete match between cluster members of 9a5c and
Temecula-1 strains. Each member gene in the 9a5c cluster
has a corresponding homologous gene in the Temecula-1
cluster. Further, the relative gene order in these two strains
was also conserved. Three genes in this cluster, XF0029,
XF0030 and XF0031 were structurally conserved in the
draft genomes of Dixon and Ann1 strains, indicating the
imperial functions of these genes in pili biogenesis. It is
interesting to find that XF0030, a hypothetical protein, is
one of the three well-conserved genes. Further functional
studies are required to understand its true function. Using
the selected criterion described above, our BLASTN results
did not identify any homologous sequences for this gene
cluster in the GenBank.
Another unique and conserved gene cluster is a 7 kb fimbriae cluster which consists of seven members in strain
9a5c (Fig. 6B). Fimbriae are known to elicit immune
responses in eukaryotic cells [33]. Therefore, this cluster
might be involved in the invasive activity of X. fastidiosa
inside host cells. Our analysis shows that XF0078 is highly
conserved in the four strains, while XF0080 is missing
from Temecula-1 and XF0081 is missing from Dixon
strain (Fig. 6B).
Pathogenicity related genes are essential for the movement, colonization and invasion of bacteria inside plant
cells. Gene targets that help in the early detection of bacterial colonization and/or invasion would help in design-

ing and implementing better management practices. Our
analysis has led to identification of conserved and unique
pathogenicity clusters mentioned earlier among the four
strains. Targeting the expression of these genes would
serve as ideal gene markers for detection and disease management purposes. Previously, Koide et al [34], reported
XF0078, a fimbrial adhesion precursor, is absent in strain
J1a12, a mild strain, compared to the highly pathogenic
strain 9a5c, further supporting their potential use as gene
markers.

Putative xenologues vs native genes
Codon usage analysis
Support trees for hierarchical clustering revealed that
native genes and putative xenologues formed distinct
groups supported by high bootstrap values. In the case of
strain 9a5c, of 36 genes that were identified as putative
xenologues based on the BLAST similarity search, 27
genes segregated as a separate cluster consisting exclusively of the xenologues and was supported by a high
bootstrap value of 83, from the rest of the genes (see Additional file 6). The other nine putative xenologues formed
a subcluster with six native genes. The rest of the native
genes formed the third cluster. Among the putative xenologues, the codons, Cys_UGC, Lys_AAG, Gln_CAG,

Phe_UUC, Ile_AUC, Asn_AAC, Gly_GGC, Leu_CUG,
Arg_CGC and Tyr_UAC were dominantly represented
compared to the native genes. Support trees for strain
Ann1 showed four clusters, with three clusters for the 25
putative xenologues and the fourth cluster consisting of
the native genes (see Additional file 7). While the outer
nodes had weak bootstrap values, there was significant
support for the inner nodes for all the clusters. Unlike the
9a5c strain, strain Ann1 showed a clear segregation of the
native and putative xenologues with various degrees of
association in each group. The predominant codons in the
putative xenologous group were Ile_AUC, Tyr_UAC,
Phe_UUC, Asn_AAC, His_CAC and Cys_UGC. There were
seven such putative xenologues in the Dixon strain of
which, five formed an independent cluster while the other
two (FX0239 and FX3434) paired with the native genes
(see Additional file 8). Codons, Lys_AAA, Gln_CAA,
Cys_UGC and Phe_UUC were over represented in the
transferred genes compared to the native genes. Temecula1 which has only two putative xenologues was not subjected to this analysis.
Base composition GC12 vs GC3 of the putative xenologues
Comparison of the base composition (GC and GC3)
between native genes and the putative xenologues showed
significant differences at both the positions. Further, for
three strains, Ann1, 9a5c and Temecula-1, the GC composition of putative xenologues was higher than in the native
genes, while it was lower for the Dixon strain (Table 4).
Relative neutrality plots and selection pressures
Relative neutrality plots differed between the native genes
and the putative xenologues. While the native genes displayed a slope of 0.649 ± 0.01 among the four strains, the
putative xenologues displayed a lower slope in strains
Ann1 (0.516), 9a5c (0.295), Dixon (0.487) and on the
other hand, strain Temecula-1 showed a higher slope
(1.2) (see Additional file 9). The negative intercept
observed for strain Temecula-1 might have been biased
because it had only few genes.

There are several lines of evidence to show that a sub-set
of the strain specific genes identified on the basis of the
four-way genome comparison, are truly specific (not
present in the other three strains) to that strain and most

likely were horizontally transferred into their genome.
Such gene transfer events have been documented and are
known to influence niche-adaptive variation within Helicobacter pylori [35]. However, more complete genome coverage is required to fully understand the potential of such
strain specific genes in X. fastidiosa. In order to address the
issue of draft sequence availability for Ann1 and Dixon
strains, in the present study, the strain specific sequences
that showed homology to Xanthomonas spp. were eliminated thereby reducing the possibility of labeling the
genes that are missed in the draft genomes as xenologues.
Codon usage analysis has shown that a majority of these
xenologues not only show distinct groupings, which
could be linked to other bacterial genomic sources, but
also show a difference preference for tRNAs species compared to the highly conserved X. fastidiosa native gene set.
There are several reports in the past which have used
codon usage bias to characterize the introduced genes
[36,37].
Similarly, significant differences between the native gene
set and that of the xenologues were noted for GC composition and the selection pressure existing on the genes
compared. Previous analyses of GC composition using
relative neutrality plots reasoned that genes undergoing
strong selection pressure would tend to show a low slope
[36,38,39]. While we did not observe such a trend in our
study, the slope differed between native and the xenologous sets in all the four strains, supporting the idea of lateral transfer of these genes.
Strain specific genomic sequences
Since the aim of the study was also to provide a ready-touse set of strain specific genomic sequences for developing
PCR-based detection techniques for strain differentiation,
sequences regardless of function (coding or non-coding),
were identified and categorized into four groups (100 500 bp; 501 – 1000 bp; 1001 -5000 bp and > 5000 bp).
There are a total of 1,056, 329, 78 and 293 strain specific
genomic sequences for strains 9a5c, Ann1, Dixon and
Temecula-1, respectively. Of these, 19 sequences of 9a5c
and 16 specific sequences of Ann1 are larger than 1.0 kb.

Figure 7
Distribution of tandem repeat loci in X. fastidiosa strains
Distribution of tandem repeat loci in X. fastidiosa strains. The above graphs illustrate perfect and imperfect simple
repeats with repeat unit length of 5 bp or more. There were no mono- and di- repeats in all four strains.

Tandem repeats
There are 84 to 173 tandem repeat sequences with motif
size up to 48 bp among the four X. fastidiosa strains, with
6 to 9 bp repeat motifs far greater than other motifs (Fig.
7). No mono- or di- repeats were detected in any of the
strains in contrast to those present in other bacteria such
as E. coli [40]. The number of tandem repeat sequences in
the non-coding regions varied from 23 to 102 with 1.9 to
40 copies. Similarly, there were 43 to 61 tandem repeats
in the coding regions of the four strains, with 1.9 to 74.1
copies. Interestingly, a majority of these motifs came from
two categories, hypothetical proteins and proteins associated with phage-related functions, suggesting that further
functional characterization will help better understand
the epidemiological implications of such repeats in the
genomics of X. fastidiosa strains.
Potential problems associated with draft genome
sequences
Draft genome sequences provide quick and valuable
sequence information at much lesser cost than the complete versions and currently more than 500 microbial
draft quality genomes are deposited in the GenBank.
While useful information on the sequence content can be

derived from the draft genomes, some of the potential
problems associated are incomplete sequence information, discontinuity of the sequencing data and greater
chances of sequencing and assembling errors. However, in
the case of X. fastidiosa, we think that problems in the two
draft sequences of X. fastidiosa are lower due to the fact
that more than one strain of X. fastidiosa is completely
sequenced. Further, X. fastidiosa has less repetitive
sequences, a problem that compounds in draft genomes
with increase in genome complexity (more in eukaryotes
in general compared to bacteria) and has no chloroplast
and mitochondrial specific sequences. Further, in our
analysis, while predicting the potential xenologues in
these four strains, we have eliminated genes that are strain
specific and show high BLAST similarity to Xanthomonas
to account for the draft genome status. The published
manuscript [6] claimed an error probability of < 1/10,000
for the draft sequences of the Dixon and Ann1 genomes
with 9X coverage of the BAC clones, which also meets, by
definition the quality of the published CVC and PD complete genomes. While it is impractical to re-sequence the
whole genome, we amplified and re-sequenced a small
sample set of genomic regions (30 primer pairs targeting
INDELs and 10 for frame shift mutations) from the four

Page 11 of 15

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:225

reference strains 9a5c, Temecula-1, Ann1 and Dixon, that
were originally used for genome sequencing. INDELs
showed 100% and frame shift mutations showed ~80%
agreement with the published genomic sequence in these
four strains (data not shown).

Conclusion
Our four-way genome analysis has identified and characterized conserved and specific genes and non-coding
sequences among the four strains of X. fastidiosa. Results
are presented in a comprehensive database format. The
identified variations such as SNPs, INDELs and VNTR are
directly applicable for the development of molecular tools
for pathogen detection and strain characterization, in
understanding disease epidemiology and pathogen biology, and the development of novel disease management
strategies.

Methods
Custom Perl scripts
Several custom Perl scripts were developed for four-way
genome comparisons, such as to search for unique conserved genes (see Additional file 1), highly conserved
genes (see Additional file 3), genes with frame shift mutation (see Additional file 2), identify unique gene clusters
(see Additional files 4 and 5), and to rank the conserved
genes. These program files can be downloaded at our website [41].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/225

Four-way whole genome comparisons
The sequence datasets were separated into coding and
non-coding regions for analysis. Coding regions for each
of the four strains were the same gene sets that were predicted earlier [5-7]. For the non-coding region comparisons, the respective strain gene set was used to mask the
complementary region of the whole genome sequence
using WUBlast [42] and RepeatMasker [43]. Next, using
custom Perl script, all the unmasked regions of at least
100 bp in length were extracted for each strain. Both the
coding, as well as non-coding regions were passed
through a Perl script pipeline that identified the homologous (conserved) sequences or strain specific sequences
based on an arbitrary BLASTN cut-off E-value of e-10 (83%
sequence identity).

The homologous pairs of sequences were aligned using
ClustalW with default parameters. The regions of variability (SNPs and INDELs) on each line of the alignment were
marked with a Perl script (clustalw_modify.pl) to increase
the readability. The number of such SNPs and INDELs in
each alignment was counted using another Perl script
(SNP_Indel_count.pl). From this data, synonymous and
non-synonymous SNPs were identified based on the universal genetic code. A custom Perl script (Syndetect.pl)
was designed for this purpose. INDELs were estimated
according to the Eernisse and Kluge's method [44].
Xylella fastidiosa conserved unique genes and Xylella
fastidiosa strain specific unique genes
Genes that are conserved in all the four strains but have no
known homology to any of the sequenced bacterial
genomes were categorized as Xylella fastidiosa conserved
unique genes. To identify such unique genes, the homologous (conserved) genes identified earlier were used to
BLAST search against the GenBank nr database with Evalue of e-5 similar to previous report [7].

Xfbase structure and contents
Xfbase has been developed under an IIS6.0 server using
CGI scripts. Database contents are retrievable through
web pages that are dynamically generated by CGI scripts.
A total of eight subjects are listed in the index frame: 1.
Genome Sequence, 2. Four Way Genome Comparison, 3.
Tandem Repeats, 4. Strain Specific Sequences, 5. Unique
Genes 6. Conserved Genes, 7. Perl Scripts, and 8. Downloads. Each subject is linked to a corresponding web page
which lists the respective data. The data are linked to a
web page containing the gene lists. The sequence or alignment information of genes can be conveniently retrieved
by clicking the corresponding button next to it. Users can
also retrieve the gene information through the provided
window in the index frame [41].

Xylella fastidiosa strain specific unique genes are genes that
are present only in a particular strain and have no known
homologies to any of the sequenced bacterial genomes.
To identify such strain specific unique genes, strain specific genes of individual strains were BLAST searched
against the GenBank nr database with an E-value of e-5.

Sequence datasets
Genomic sequences and gene sets of the X. fastidiosa
strains: X. fastidiosa Temecula-1 (grapevine), GenBank
#AE009442 and X. fastidiosa 9a5c (citrus) GenBank #
AE003851 were downloaded from the NCBI and the other
two strains X. fastidiosa Ann1 (oleander) and X. fastidiosa
Dixon (almond) were downloaded from the Integrative
Genomics website [28]. In this database, the gene names
of strain 9a5c, Ann1, Dixon, Temecula-1 have prefixes of
'XF', 'FY', 'FX' and 'PD', respectively.

Strain specific genomic sequences
In order to identify the strain specific genomic sequences
regardless of their coding status, the genome of each strain
was fragmented into 30 bp sequences. These fragments
were next added to the Repeat library and each whole
genome sequence was masked with the other three strains
30 bp fragments using WUBlast and RepeatMasker programs as described previously. The unmasked genomic
sequences were extracted from the result files and grouped
into four categories according to their size.

Pair wise genome analysis of conserved genes
Mapping of the 1,579 conserved genes to their contig
position revealed that, 51 genes had truncated start codon
due to their end location on the contig and hence were
excluded from further analysis. Therefore, only 1,528 conserved genes were used for INDEL, SNP and pair-wise
comparisons to determine the inter-relatedness of the
four strains. Gene alignments for a total of six such possible groups (9a5c+Temecula-1, Ann1+Temecula-1,
Dixon+Temecula-1,
Ann1+Dixon,
9a5c+Ann1,
9a5c+Dixon) were generated using CLUSTALW with the
default options. For each category, a custom Perl script
was used to calculate the number of unmatched nucleotides in the form of SNPs (transition and transversion)
and INDELs (external and internal) based on the 1528
sequence alignment files. An unmatched INDEL nucleotide is one that has no corresponding nucleotide in the
other gene in the gene alignment file. Mutation frequency
was defined as the percentage of unmatched base pairs
over the total base pairs aligned and was calculated as
reported previously [19]. For each gene, a standard deviation of the mutation frequency among the six compared
pairs was calculated and the conserved genes were ranked
in descending order of their observed standard deviation.
Tandem repeats
Sequence repeats were identified for both coding and
non-coding regions using Tandem Repeats Finder [45].
The HTML output from this program was converted into
plain text and the results were parsed using the
tandem_parse.pl Perl script [41]. The complete set of
results was tabulated strain wise, with features such as the
repeat coordinates, copy number and repeat motif.
Identification of potential xenologues and defining the
native gene set
Homologous searches for each set of the X. fastidiosa strain
specific genes (9a5c- 241 genes, Ann1- 145 genes, Dixon96 genes and Temecula-1 with 10 genes) to the proteins in
other sequenced genomes were carried out using BLASTX
analysis against the NCBI database using a cut-off E-value
of e-5 similar to previous report [7]. The genes showing
homology to the plasmid, phage and IS related genes and
the Xanthomonas genome (a closely related γ-proteobacterium of Xanthomonadales) were removed and the rest of
genes from each strain 9a5c (36), Ann1 (25), Dixon (7)
and Temecula-1 (2) were treated as potential xenologues
and used for further analysis. Out of 1,579 genes that were
conserved in all the four strains, the top 100 most conserved genes, based on similarity ranking as described previously, were designated as native genes of that strain.
Codon usage and hierarchical clustering analysis
Codon usage analysis for the native genes and the potential xenologues was carried out as described earlier with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/225

minor modifications [36]. A matrix file of codon frequencies for each set was generated using the Interactive Codon
Usage Analysis (INCA) version 2.0 software [46] and
merged into a single file per strain. Roughly, equal numbers of native genes and potential xenologues were used
for analysis to avoid statistical bias due to the differences
in number of the sequences comprising each set. Support
trees for the generated hierarchical clusters were calculated
using the TIGR Multiexperiment Viewer (MEV) software
with 1000 bootstrap samples.
Relative neutrality plots and GC12 vs GC3
For each set of the native and potential xenologues, the
G+C content at the non-synonymous (GC12) positions
was plotted against the G+C content at the synonymous
(GC3) position and the slope was determined based on
correlation analysis [36].
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of the observed mutation rate
among the six groups was performed by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) using SAS (SAS/STAT software version 9.1, SAS Institute Inc) program and a confidence
level of P ≤ 0.05. Duncan's multiple range test was chosen
to compare data from different sets.
