Abstract
Background: PL10 homologs exist in a wide range of eukaryotes from yeast, plants to animals. They share a DEAD
motif and belong to the DEAD-box polypeptide 3 (DDX3) subfamily with a major role in RNA metabolism. The lineagespecific expression patterns and various genomic structures and locations of PL10 homologs indicate these homologs
have an interesting evolutionary history.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses revealed that, in addition to the sex chromosome-linked PL10 homologs, DDX3X and
DDX3Y, a single autosomal PL10 putative homologous sequence is present in each genome of the studied non-rodent
eutheria. These autosomal homologous sequences originated from the retroposition of DDX3X but were
pseudogenized during the evolution. In rodents, besides Ddx3x and Ddx3y, we found not only Pl10 but another
autosomal homologous region, both of which also originated from the Ddx3x retroposition. These retropositions
occurred after the divergence of eutheria and opossum. In contrast, an additional X putative homologous sequence
was detected in primates and originated from the transposition of DDX3Y. The evolution of PL10 homologs was under
positive selection and the elevated Ka/Ks ratios were observed in the eutherian lineages for DDX3Y but not PL10 and
DDX3X, suggesting relaxed selective constraints on DDX3Y. Contrary to the highly conserved domains, several sites
with relaxed selective constraints flanking the domains in the mammalian PL10 homologs may play roles in enhancing
the gene function in a lineage-specific manner.
Conclusion: The eutherian DDX3X/DDX3Y in the X/Y-added region originated from the translocation of the ancient
PL10 ortholog on the ancestral autosome, whereas the eutherian PL10 was retroposed from DDX3X. In addition to the
functional PL10/DDX3X/DDX3Y, conserved homologous regions on the autosomes and X chromosome are present.
The autosomal homologs were also derived from DDX3X, whereas the additional X-homologs were derived from
DDX3Y. These homologs were apparently pseudogenized but may still be active transcriptionally. The evolution of PL10
homologs was positively selected.
Background
PL10 was first identified in mouse by using a human Y
chromosome (Chr) derived probe [1] and is present in a
wide range of eukaryotes from yeast, plants, and animals,
including humans [2]. In the mouse, Pl10 has been shown
to encode a functional protein with an important DEAD
motif (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp), which plays essential roles in
spermatogenesis [3]. In eutherian mammals, PL10 has
two closely-related paralogs, DDX3X (DEAD box polypeptide 3, X-linked) and DDX3Y (DEAD box polypeptide
3, Y-linked), located on the sex Chrs. PL10, DDX3X and
DDX3Y share the DEAD motif and constitute the DDX3/
DED1 (ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase) sub* Correspondence: wul12@psu.edu

family under the DEAD-box helicase family [4] with a
major function related to RNA metabolism [5]. The
DDX3/DED1 subfamily is involved in diverse cellular
process including tissue differentiation at distinct developmental stages, embryogenesis, asexual reproduction,
cell regeneration, tumorigenesis and immune response
[2,6-8], which have been reviewed comprehensively by
Rosner et al. [2].
Interestingly, the biological roles of the eutherian members in DDX3 subfamily appear to be varied and lineagedependent although they share domain structures and
highly similar sequences. In eutheria, the DDX3X has
been shown to elicit immunoresponse because the
DDX3X can interact with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)
to induce the type I interferon (IFN) promoter and the
downstream immune pathway [6]. In addition, DDX3X
also plays a role in HIV infection and becomes an impor-

tant target in antiviral therapy [9]. On the other hand, the
human DDX3Y lies within the azoospermia factor a
(AZFa) region on the proximal Yq11.21 and the deletion
of human DDX3Y resulted in the oligozoospermia, azoospermia and the male sertoli-cell only syndrome [10,11].
In spite of their high amino acid (aa) similarity (91%),
DDX3X cannot rescue the loss-of-function of DDX3Y in
human [2], signifying the functional diversification
between DDX3X and DDX3Y. The human DDX3Y is
believed to be one of the essential genes involved in
human spermatogenesis and male fertility [12]. In contrast to the human ortholog, the pivotal role of Ddx3y in
spermatogenesis has been replaced by the autosomal Pl10
in mice [3]. The mouse Pl10 is believed to evolve from
Ddx3x through the retroposition mechanism [13]. More
interestingly, the bovine PL10 has also been proved to be
active at the transcription level even though it may lose
protein-coding potential [14]. In addition to the lineagedependent functionality of PL10, the tissue specificity of
DDX3X/DDX3Y homologs has also been shown to vary
in mouse and human [15,3]. The lineage-specific expression patterns and the diverse genomic structures and
locations of PL10 homologs suggest that the PL10
homologs regulate biological process via divergent mechanisms and evolved differently. However, previous studies
focused mainly on elucidating the function rather than
the evolution of PL10, which elicited our interest to investigate the evolutionary history behind PL10, DDX3X, and
DDX3Y. Here, we report the results from a phylogenetic
analysis of the PL10 homologs in 19 different species.

Results
The identification of PL10 homologous sequences

To obtain deep insight into PL10 evolution, we collected
the PL10 related genes deposited in NCBI [16] and
detected its potential homologs by comparing the mouse
Pl10 mRNA sequence against the UCSC genome database [17]. In addition to the 22 annotated sequences for
PL10, DDX3X and DDX3Y, we identified 15 PL10 putative homologous regions (coverage > 50%) in the genomes
of mammals (Table 1). These putative homologs occupied
the genomes with two major patterns in terms of their
spanning size (2~4 and 10~14 Kb). The large-size
homologs are located in the sex Chrs containing intronexon structures, while the small-size ones are mostly
autosomal and intronless (Table 1).
We extracted the sequences from these putative homologous regions and conducted a gene prediction using
GENSCAN [18] to identify whether these homologous
sequences maintain protein-coding potential. Based on
gene similarity, structures and chromosomal locations,
we obtained the predicted DDX3X in chimp and orangutan, and Pl10 on Chr 13 in rat (RNO13). The predicted

Page 2 of 12

chimp and orangutan DDX3X matched the predicted
coding proteins in ENSEMBL [19] (Table 1). Compared
to the human DDX3X protein of 662 aa, the predicted
peptide is much shorter in the chimp with only 438 aa
because of the incomplete sequence. The predicted rat
Pl10 matched to the entry, NP_001102328.1, in the NCBI
database, and we concluded that it is the rat Pl10 based
on its intronless structure and high sequence similarity
(96%) with the mouse Pl10. In opossum, the predicted
DDX3 peptide matched to ENSMODT00000026845 in
ENSEMBL [19] (Table 1). The remaining 11 homologs
either do not have an open reading frame (ORF) or have a
premature stop codon (Table 2). Thus, they are pseudogenes.
The analyses of PL10 phylogeny

Using the 22 PL10 related entries from NCBI together
with 15 previously-described putatively homologous
sequences, we constructed a phylogenetic tree to investigate the evolutionary relationship among these
homologs. The tree clearly indicated several evolutionary
clusters (Fig. 1). The first cluster is the PL10/DDX3X
cluster, within which the putative homologous sequences
on primate Chr4 were in the same clade and clustered
with the primate DDX3X. The autosomal homologous
regions in ruminants and carnivores, including the
bovine PL10 pseudogene [14], were also in the same cluster and grouped with the DDX3X counterparts as in primates (Fig. 1). No apparent insertions were detected in
these homologous regions. The mouse and rat Pl10 were
in the same branch. However, an additional putative
homolog of DDX3X was detected in mouse (MMU1) and
rat (RNO19), which was grouped with its corresponding
DDX3X gene, respectively, before clustering them
together into a single group. It is noteworthy that all
homologs of DDX3X identified in mammals are intronless (Table 1). Since the mammalian DDX3X contains an
intron-exon structure, we reasoned that these intronless
homologs are most likely the evolutionary trace after the
DDX3X retroposition.
In addition to the functional eutherian DDX3X, we
detected another putative homologous region on primate
ChrX which was present on the same branch with the
DDX3Y instead of the DDX3X (Fig. 1). In contrast to the
autosomal homologs, these ChrX putative homologs contain one or more insertions that appear to fit with the
typical GT/AG splicing rule (Table 2), raising the possibility that these additional X homologs may have derived
from a transposition event before the primate divergence
(Fig. 1). Furthermore, in opossum and chicken, only a single homologous region with the intron-exon structure
was detected on opossum Chr4 (MDO4) and chicken
Chr1 (GGA1), respectively (Table 1).

Positive selection test for the PL10 related genes

We compared the one-ratio model with the free-ratio
model to test the lineage-specific positive selection for
the PL10 related functional homologs in our dataset
using PAML4 package [20]. The one-ratio model assumes
the same Ka/KS (w) ratio for all the lineages. The log-likelihood value under this model was l0 = -22217.097 with 58
parameters where the transition/transversion rate ratio
was k = 1.685 and w = 0.041. The w was computed as the
average of all codon sites and lineages. The free-ratio
model assumes an independent w ratio for each branch
and the number of parameters was increased to 104 for
our dataset in this model. The likelihood value under this
model was l1 = -22105.980. The comparison of the likelihood value, 2Îl = 2(l1-l0), was 222.234 as determined by
the X2 distribution with degree of freedom (df ) of 46 (p <
0.001), allowing us to reject the one-ratio model and conclude that the w ratios are varied among lineages (Fig. 2).
In mammals, the estimates of w ratios were all lower than
0.1 on the branches leading to the lineages for PL10 and
DDX3X, whereas the w ratios were higher on average
(0.5) among the lineages for DDX3Y (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the primate lineages for DDX3Y in human and
chimp were detected to be subject to positive selection
(Fig. 2). The branches leading to the mammalian PL10
homologs clade (Fig. 2) also showed w ratios larger than
1, suggesting that the evolution of PL10/DDX3X/DDX3Y
was under positive selection.

Since some lineages were positively selected, especially
in the case of DDX3Y, we further used a small dataset
containing only the mammalian homologous coding
sequences to examine the positively selected sites. The
test statistic of likelihood ratio test (LRT) between the
one-ratio model (M0) and the discrete model (M3) was
2
128.182 that is greater than the critical value c 1% = 13.28
when df = 4 [Additional File 1 and File 2]. This suggested
that the selective pressure is diverse among the codons.
Three site classes calculated under model M3 have prior
probability of p0 = 0.887, p1 = 0.108, and p3 = 0.005 with
the Ka/Ks ratios of w0 = 0.025, w1 = 0.316 and w2 = 2.549
[Additional File 1]. The posterior probabilities of site
classes calculated in model M3 are shown in Fig. 3. However, the LRT of the other two pairs of models, M1a
(Nearly Neutral)/M2a (Selection) and M7 (beta)/M8
(beta & w), generated an incongruent result. The test statistic of the M1a/M2a is insignificant (p > 1), whereas the
M7/M8 generated a significant result with a LRT value of
2
16.97 greater than the critical value at df = 2, c 1% = 9.1
(p < 0.01) [Additional File 1 and File 2], which together
gave rise to the marginal prediction of the codon sites
with relaxed selective constraints. Four (9A, 10L, 24S,
425S) and six (9A, 10L, 24S, 425S, 608A, 609S) sites were
inferred to contain increased w ratios under models M2a
and M8, respectively. Four of the six inferred sites in
model M8 coincided with the result of model M2a,

Figure 1 The bootstrap consensus tree of PL10 homologous sequences. The evolutionary tree was built based on the Neighbor-Joining method
implemented in MEGA4 [55,62]. The bootstrap consensus tree is inferred from 1000 replicates and the branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 65% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The bootstrap values are shown as percentages next to the branches. The evolutionary
distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [63] and in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The
rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 0.91). All positions containing alignment gaps and missing
data were eliminated by pairwise deletion. A total of 3944 positions were in the final dataset [Additional File 6]. The branches leading to the non-annotated autosomal homologous clusters of PL10 are highlighted in blue; the branches leading to the rodent Pl10 are highlighted in green; the branches leading to the non-annotated X-homologs are highlighted in red. The PL10/DDX3X cluster and the DDX3Y cluster are marked by vertical lines on

including Ala9, Leu10, Ser24, Ser425, in which the Ser24
and Ser425 have posterior probability higher than 0.9
under model M8 [Additional File 1]. All of the inferred
sites are located in the non-domain regions.
Conservation of PL10 homologs

We conducted a multiple alignment for all the analyzed
sequences to investigate the domain conservation in
PL10, DDX3X and DDX3Y, and found that the DEAD/
DEAH box helicase domain (Pfam: PF00270) and helicase
conserved C-terminal domain (Pfam: PF00271) of the
DDX3 genes are highly conserved [Additional File 3]. We
evaluated the degree of conservation by ConSurf (Fig.
4A) [21], which assigned the conservation score to each
site of the provided DDX3X structures (PDB: 2I4I) [22]
based on the empirical Bayesian method [21]. After mapping the conservation score to the structure, we found
that the highly conserved codons concentrated in the
cleft where the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and
RNA substrates interact with the DDX3 proteins (Fig. 4).

Discussion
In the non-eutherian lineages, PL10 is the sole member of
the DDX3 subfamily, whereas in eutheria, the ancient
PL10 gene is located on the ancestral sex Chrs, resulting
in the sex Chr-linked orthologs, DDX3X and DDX3Y (Fig.
1). Molecular evolutionary studies in recent years have
established that the mammalian sex Chrs originated from
a pair of ordinary autosomes, and most ancestral genes
on that pair were still maintained on the X Chr but
degenerated on the Y Chr due to the lack of recombination [23-25]. However, the Y Chr intends to maintain the
functional genes that are beneficial to the male, such as
those genes involved in spermatogenesis including
DDX3Y [26]. Like the non-eutherian PL10, DDX3X and
DDX3Y comprise the intron-exon structures, supporting
the concept that DDX3Y and DDX3X are the evolutionary

relics of the ancestral autosomal PL10. In opossum, the
PL10 homologous sequence was detected only on MDO4
but not on the sex Chrs. The opossum Chr4 homolog also
contains the intron-exon structure with predicted peptide close to DDX3X. Similarly, the single homologous
sequence detected in chicken was located on the autosomes and it contains introns. A recent study for the gene
cluster in the X/Y-added region of mammalian sex Chrs,
XAR and YAR, revealed that the gene cluster and the
gene order of this region are the same on chicken GGA1
but separated on opossum MDO4 and MDO7 [15], suggesting a single translocation event gave rise to the different chromosomal locations of the gene cluster among
chicken and opossum. The DDX3X/DDX3Y also reside

within the XAR/YAR, which allowed us to reach the parallel conclusion that the translocation generated the PL10
homologs on the chicken Chr1 and opossum Chr4, and
DDX3X/DDX3Y on the eutherian sex Chrs (Table 1, Fig.
1).
Of particular interest is the occurrence of the mouse
Pl10, an intronless gene and the only demonstrated functional autosomal ortholog in mammals to date. Consistent with a previous deduction [13], our result supported
that the rodent Pl10 was derived from the retroposition
of the DDX3X genes [27]. Retroposition is a crucial
mechanism of gene duplication [28] and generates many
new genes in new genomic positions through the reverse
transcription of a parental gene [27,29,30]. The parental
gene usually contains introns, whereas the processed retrocopy is intronless [27]. Thus, the other detected putative autosomal PL10 homologous sequences without
apparent intron-exon structure in cattle, horse, dog and
primates may have also evolved through the retroposition
mechanism. These intronless homologous sequences on
autosomes were consistently detected in eutherians but
not in opossum, suggesting that the retroposition
occurred after the divergence of eutherian and other
mammals around 150 to 170 million years ago [31]. This
raised an interesting question, why does the autosomal
retroposition of the PL10 occur specifically in eutheria? It
may be partially explained by the important functional
role of mouse Pl10 and the recently discovered bovine
PL10. The mouse Pl10 has been evidenced to be a central
gene regulating the spermatogenesis and replace the role
of DDX3Y [3]. The bovine PL10, albeit pseudogenized
during the evolution, has also been proven to be active
transcriptionally and may be involved in the regulatory
coordination of bovine spermatogenesis [14]. Although
the coding potential of the autosomal PL10 homologous
sequences in eutheria, except in mouse, is diminished, we
cannot exclude the possibility that these homologous
sequences may be involved in regulating some biological
process at the transcriptional level. Indeed, previous
studies suggested that the pseudogenes may regulate the
expression of the functional paralogous genes by producing antisense RNA [32,33]. Therefore, it is valuable to
investigate whether these homologous sequences are
transcriptable and their potential function in the future.
The maximum likelihood ratio test (LRT) for different
lineages indicated that the Ka/Ks ratios in the PL10
homologs are varied among the evolutionary lineages.
The Ka/Ks ratio along the branches among the mammalian lineages showed that the evolution of the mammalian
PL10 homologs were not subject to positive selection,
except for the human and chimp DDX3Y that are positively selected (w > 1). In addition to the chimp and
human DDX3Y, we found that the ratios for the other
eutherian lineages for DDX3Y appear to be higher when

Page 8 of 12

compared to those for mammalian PL10 and DDX3X,
which is in line with a finding by Wilson and Makova
[15]. These elevated w ratios can be explained by either
the effect of relaxed selective constraints for the lineages
containing DDX3Y due to the absent recombination of
the ChrY or a weak positive selection operating on the Yhomologs [20]. The latter may still continue to refine the
male-specific function for the Y-homologs [34]. In contrast, the mammalian lineages for DDX3X and PL10 with
extremely low w ratios suggested that purifying selection
may act strongly on the mammalian PL10 and Xhomologs. Furthermore, the w ratios of the branches
leading to the avian and mammalian lineages were larger
than 1, indicating that the emergence of eutherian PL10
homologs was selected positively to acquire species-specific gene function and purifying selection acted on the
DDX3X and PL10 homologs to preserve their crucial biological function and avoid their divergence.
A DDX3X/DDX3Y-specific multi-residue insertion
(EALRAMKENG) has been observed to form an important positively charged cavity with the neighboring positive residues to increase the RNA binding surface in
humans [35]. After incorporating PL10 and the homologous regions, we found that the insertion was highly conserved in the PL10 homologs of fish, frog, chicken, and
other mammals, suggesting that the functional constraints occurred along the cavity region in the related
homologs. Conversely, this insertion was not well-conserved in plants and invertebrates. Furthermore, the
DDX3X displayed no activity with the RNA substrate
when different flanking regions surrounding the domains
were removed [35]. A similar effect was proven in other
DEAD-box helicase related genes, such as the UAP56
[36] and DP103 [37], where the deletion of either the Nterminal or C-terminal flanking sequences outside the
domain core regions impacts their helicase and ATPase
activity, signifying the regulatory roles of the flanking
regions. As shown from the analysis of positively selected
amino acids, all the marginally inferred selected sites
were located in the non-domain regions (Fig. 3) and may
have served as the targets for improving the gene function during the evolution. One of the inferred sites,
Ser425, occurred in the hinge region between two
domains, suggesting its potential role in the adaption of
the PL10 protein conformations and ligand-binding specificity. The slightly elevated w ratios were observed
mostly in the non-domain regions as depicted in Fig. 3,
indicating the purifying selection may attenuate in these
regions to allow the functional accommodations of the
PL10 homologs. Moreover, several sites in the flanking
regions of the human DDX3X have been shown to
undergo epigenetic modifications, including Ser2[38],
Tyr69[39,40],
Ser74[41],
Ser76[41],
Ser78[41],
Tyr104[39], Ser125[41], Ser590[42], Ser594[43,42] and

Chang and Liu BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:127
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/127

Ser612[43]. Meanwhile, two sites in the flanking
sequences of the human DDX3Y, Tyr69 [39,44] and
Ser592 [45], have been shown to be phosphorylated, and
they are conserved with the modified sites at Tyr69 and
Ser594 in the human DDX3X. The mouse Pl10 also has
two phosphorylated sites at Tyr282 and Tyr465, but both
of them were located in the domains [46,47]. The
sequence comparison showed that the selection force has
limited the divergence in the regions flanking the
domains of PL10 related genes in fish, frog, bird and
mammals, and most of the epigenetically modified sites
were highly conserved among these species. Interestingly,
despite the high degree of conservation, Ser76 exists specifically in the PL10 and DDX3X homologs but not in the
DDX3Y orthologs. This distinction and different epigenetic modification pattern may partly contribute to the
functional divergence between the eutherian DDX3Y,
DDX3X and PL10. The functional specificity of PL10
homologs appear to be determined multifactorially,
including the sequence elements located in the non-conserved regions, the factors controlling the diverse temporal and spatial expression patterns [14], and the distinct
epigenetic modification patterns [35].
This study was limited to the availability of complete
genomes and the accuracy of the genome assembly. Even
though the number of finished genome projects in
diverse species is growing, incomplete sequences of PL10
homologs still exist in the published genomes, especially
for the challenges in sequencing and assembly of the Y
Chr due to its highly repetitive nature. Further understanding of the evolution of sex Chr linked genes largely
relies on the clarification of the diverse genomes in species other than primates.

Conclusion
Our analyses revealed that several conserved putative
PL10 homologous regions, in addition to the functional
PL10/DDX3X/DDX3Y, are present on the autosome and
mammalian X Chr. These homologs share high similarity
(> 70%) and coverage (> 50%) with mouse Pl10 but contain premature stop codons or indels, resulting in shorter
putative peptides and/or frameshifts, suggesting their
pseudogenization during the course of evolution [27,48].
The eutherian DDX3X/DDX3Y located in XAR/YAR
were derived from the translocation of the orthologs on
the ancestral autosome [15]. The identified putative autosomal homologs in mammals in the present study were
retroposed from the DDX3X while the additional Xhomologs in primates were transposed from the DDX3Y.
These translocation events are lineage-specific. Like the
bovine PL10, these homologs may still be active transcriptionally. Positive selection appears to operate on the
PL10 homologs during the evolution. In addition to the
highly conserved domain regions, several sites in the

Page 9 of 12

non-domain regions of functional PL10 homologs may
play roles in enhancing the gene function in a lineagespecific manner.
The results reported in this study not only increase our
knowledge regarding the molecular evolution of PL10
homologs, which will facilitate the future functional characterization of PL10 homologs, but also provide a valuable model to investigate the origin and evolution of the
mammalian sex Chrs and the mechanisms behind lineage-specific gene duplication and functionality.

Methods
Sequence retrieval

By blating [49] the mouse Pl10 mRNA sequence against
the genomes in UCSC genome database [17], we detected
several putative homologous regions in mammals, birds
and amphibians. We retrieved the homologous sequences
from UCSC and conducted the pairwise alignment by the
Bl2seq (NCBI Blast package) program using the mouse
Pl10 mRNA sequence as the subject to filter out the
sequences which cover < 50% of the mouse Pl10. We
excluded the homologous sequences for the species without clear chromosomal annotations from our study. In
addition, we downloaded the PL10 homologous
sequences for other species from the NCBI nucleotide
database based on the literature and database mining [2].
Afterwards, we used blastx [50] to confirm the identity of
each sequence and retrieved the corresponding entries
from the NCBI when the query sequences matched these
entries perfectly. Alternatively, for sequences without a
perfect hit in the database, we used the collected genomic
sequences for gene prediction using the GENSCAN [18].
The predicted peptides were used for blastp [50] analysis
to clarify their identities. Whenever the predicted proteins can match to the entries in the database, we used
the deposited sequences in our analyses. The results were
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Several purpose-designed
scripts were coded in C++ to facilitate the analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis

We performed multiple sequence alignments to investigate the conservation of the domain regions by ClustalW
[51]. In order to ensure alignment quality, we first prealigned the annotated homologous sequences using their
translated amino acid sequences in the coding regions.
The parameters of the ClustalW for multiple alignment
stage were modified to 3.0 for the gap opening penalty
and 1.8 for the gap extension penalty to improve the
alignment. Following that, we aligned the non-annotated
homologous sequences based on the nucleotide
sequences, which was further refined by manual adjustment. The positions of DEAD and the helicase domain
were defined based on the annotation of Pfam [52] for the
human DDX3X. The alignment was visualized through

Chang and Liu BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:127
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/127

Jalview [53]. The degree of conservation was calculated
by the empirical Bayesian method implemented in ConSurf [21] to investigate the highly conserved sites in the
published human DDX3X structures (PDB: 2I4I) covering
the important interacting domains involved in the RNA
metabolism of the PL10 related homologs [35]. The conserved degree was represented through different colors
using Jmol [54] as shown in Fig. 4A. In addition, we used
the alignment to establish the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) phylogenic tree to study the relationship between PL10,
DDX3X, and DDX3Y by MEGA4 [55] with the Maximum
Composition Likelihood approach and 1000 bootstrap
replicates (Fig. 1). The rate variation among sites was
modeled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter =
0.91, estimated by the Model Selection of TOPALi (version 2.5 [56]). In Fig. 1, the branches corresponding to
partitions reproduced in less than 65% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The reason for using the NJ method is
that the average pairwise Jukes-Cantor (JC) distance of
the dataset is 0.362 smaller than 1.0, which is suitable for
making the NJ trees [57]. We applied the pairwise deletion to remove gaps as our sequence lengths are varied,
and a complete removal of the gaps is not a good choice
as it eliminates a large portion of phylogenetically meaningful sites from consideration. Further, we used the
Maximum Composite Likelihood model, recommended
by the author of MEGA4 as a better evolutionary model.
We also used the PHYML [58] and MrBayes [59] implemented in TOPALi to generate the phylogenetic trees
[Additional File 4 and File 5]. The models used in
PHYML and MrBayes are general-time-reversible
(GTR+Gamma) selected via the TOPALi.
Potential pseudogenes were excluded from the positive
selection test since the selective constraint may not act on
them anymore. We prepared an amino acid alignment
and the corresponding cDNA alignment for the complete
set of 25 sequences for the lineage test and a small dataset
(14) containing only the functional mammalian PL10
homologs for the site-specific test. The Codeml [20] in
PAML4 was applied for the following analyses. The sites
and lineages subject to positive selection were detected
based on the maximum likelihood approach [60]. We
compared the log likelihood values (l) derived from pairs
of models to testify if there was a significant difference
between model pairs by LRT. Each pair of the models
contains a simple model, where the Ka/Ks ratios of the
sites are limited, and a complex model, where the Ka/Ks
ratios can be varied. We can infer the occurrence of lineage-specific and site-specific positive selection when the
estimated Ka/Ks ratio in the complex model is larger than
1.0 and the calculated test statistic (2Îl) is significantly
larger than the critical values of the X2 distribution at the
corresponding degrees of freedom. We used M0 (oneratio) and M1 (free-ratio) to test whether the lineage-specific positive selection occurred. The pairs of models

Page 10 of 12

used for the site-specific test were M0 (One Ratio)/M3
(Discrete), M1a (Nearly Neutral)/M2a (Positive Selection), M7 (beta)/M8 (beta & w) [20]. Each test was
repeated to ensure the reproducible statistical results.
The detailed assumptions and descriptions of each model
were illustrated by Yang et al. [61,20].
