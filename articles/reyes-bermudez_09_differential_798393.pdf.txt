Abstract
Background: The coral skeleton consists of CaCO3 deposited upon an organic matrix primarily
as aragonite. Currently galaxin, from Galaxea fascicularis, is the only soluble protein component of
the organic matrix that has been characterized from a coral. Three genes related to galaxin were
identified in the coral Acropora millepora.
Results: One of the Acropora genes (Amgalaxin) encodes a clear galaxin ortholog, while the others
(Amgalaxin-like 1 and Amgalaxin-like 2) encode larger and more divergent proteins. All three
proteins are predicted to be extracellular and share common structural features, most notably the
presence of repetitive motifs containing dicysteine residues. In situ hybridization reveals distinct,
but partially overlapping, spatial expression of the genes in patterns consistent with distinct roles
in calcification. Both of the Amgalaxin-like genes are expressed exclusively in the early stages of
calcification, while Amgalaxin continues to be expressed in the adult, consistent with the situation
in the coral Galaxea.
Conclusion: Comparisons with molluscs suggest functional convergence in the two groups; lustrin
A/pearlin proteins may be the mollusc counterparts of galaxin, whereas the galaxin-like proteins
combine characteristics of two distinct proteins involved in mollusc calcification. Database searches
indicate that, although sequences with high similarity to the galaxins are restricted to the
Scleractinia, more divergent members of this protein family are present in other cnidarians and
some other metazoans. We suggest that ancestral galaxins may have been secondarily recruited to
roles in calcification in the Triassic, when the Scleractinia first appeared. Understanding the
evolution of the broader galaxin family will require wider sampling and expression analysis in a
range of cnidarians and other animals.

Background
Although calcification – the deposition of calcium salts,
usually to provide a form of skeletal support – is a widespread trait among animals, scleractinian corals are distinguished by the scale on which they carry out this process.
In contrast to the internal skeletons of tetrapods and bony
fish, which are based on calcium phosphate in the form of
hydroxyapatite, many invertebrate skeletons are composed of CaCO3. This may take the form of either calcite
or aragonite, which have distinct structural properties.
Both forms are known in cnidarians and molluscs, with
the massive exoskeletons of extant scleractinian corals
consisting predominantly of the latter.
Scleractinians are responsible for the underlying framework of coral reefs and are the most obvious calcifying
animals in warm shallow waters of the tropics and subtropics. Calcification by corals is known to be strongly
enhanced by light (e.g. [1,2]) and is therefore assumed to
be driven indirectly by photosynthesis in their dinoflagellate symbionts, but very little is known of the mechanism
of calcification or the nature of the organic matrix on
which the CaCO3 of the skeleton is deposited.
The difference in the type of CaCO3 polymorph used to
build the wide range of invertebrate support structures
reflects the biological control exerted by the organism
during mineral deposition. This is achieved via a macromolecular network of proteins, lipids and polysaccharides
[3-5] known as the skeletal organic matrix (SOM). Prior to
mineralization, this matrix is secreted to the extracellular
space by the calcifying cells and there induces CaCO3
nucleation, determining the type of polymorph as well as
size and shape of crystals [6-11]. Although the process of
calcification and the nature of the calcifying matrix have
been extensively studied in molluscs [12-14], there have
been relatively few corresponding studies on corals. To
date, the only protein to have been fully characterised
from the calcifying matrix of scleractinian corals is galaxin, which was originally identified from the coral Galaxea fascicularis [8].
Although calcification is initiated immediately after settlement (Figure 1; [15]), most studies have focussed on soluble components of the organic matrix of adult coral
skeletons. The presence of the massive skeleton, however,
complicates analysis of the process of calcification,
whereas the period immediately following settlement is
likely to be more tractable. The initiation of larval skeleton deposition correlates with the aboral ectodermal transition that gives rise to the calicoblastic ectoderm [15-18].
Larval skeleton deposition does not require the presence
of zooxanthellae, but generates a template for the skeleton
of the initial polyp [3,15,16]. Both the organization and
orientation of calcium carbonate differs between larval

Diagrammatic summary of the morphological
changes involved in Acropora settlement, metamorphosis and the initiation of calcification. (A) Initially the
planula swims horizontally, well away from the bottom. (B)
After it has become competent to settle it explores the substratum with its aboral end. (C) If it encounters appropriate
chemical cues it rounds up into a sphere, which then flattens
against the substratum. As this is happening the cells against
the substratum change their morphology and begin to
secrete a disc of organic material. (D) Perpendicular walls,
the protosepta, are then secreted on the plate in multiples of
six. (E) The protosepta become more elaborate and more
are added. (F) The walls become joined laterally and grow
upward, forming a crown shaped structure upon which the
polyp sits. In all stages the skeleton is external to, but enveloped by, the living tissue which secretes it. By the stages
shown in (E) and (F) a polyp has formed, initially with tentacle
buds and then with tentacles. However, these have been
omitted from the drawing in order to focus on the skeleton.

and adult calcification; larval skeletons are more lightly
mineralised and may contain amorphous calcium carbonate, calcite and aragonite crystals. When the latter are
present they are in the form of smaller crystals that are randomly orientated whereas adult skeletons are exclusively
composed of aragonite crystals organized in parallel fibers

[19]. It is unclear whether this apparent difference
between larval and adult calcification patterns represents
two distinct types of calcification, or ontogenetic stages in
the development of a largely aragonite skeleton as is the
case in molluscs [20]. In either case, the immediate postsettlement period is the only time during the life cycle of
the coral that calcification, and the role of the organic
matrix in that process, can be studied in isolation and it
thus presents a unique opportunity to investigate the
molecular bases of coral calcification.
An ongoing EST project on the staghorn coral Acropora
millepora [21,22] has allowed the identification of genes
encoding candidate calcifying matrix components. Here
we report the sequences of three genes encoding galaxinrelated molecules in Acropora and their expression patterns during settlement and metamorphosis. Based on
these data, we suggest distinct roles for the three gene
products during the two characteristic phases of calcification observed during the coral life cycle. This paper is particularly topical given the current concern over the effects
of rising levels of atmospheric CO2 on the acidity of the
oceans, and consequently on the ability of marine organisms to lay down their CaCO3 skeletons.

Results
Identification of three galaxin-related genes in Acropora
Two unigenes identified during EST analyses of Acropora
millepora gave strong matches with Gfgalaxin, the gene
coding for a soluble protein identified as a major component of the exoskeleton of the coral Galaxea fascicularis
[8,11]. One of these (Amgalaxin) codes for a protein
assumed to be the Acropora ortholog of Gfgalaxin, as the
predicted proteins had 58% identity and 73% similarity
overall (BlastP significance = 1e-105). The second unigene,
Amgalaxin-like 1, encodes a larger protein with much
lower overall identity to Gfgalaxin (BlastP significance =
7e-19). An additional related unigene, Amgalaxin-like 2,
was identified in a screen for genes differentially regulated
at the time of settlement, and has a BlastP significance
against Gfgalaxin of 2e-33.
Structure of the predicted galaxin-related proteins from
Acropora
The Acropora and Galaxea galaxins are very similar in most
structural characteristics. Like its Galaxea counterpart,
Amgalaxin is cysteine-rich (12.4% overall, compared to
13.4% in Gfgalaxin). The 338 AA Acropora predicted protein (Figure 2A) consists of an N-terminal signal peptide
of 23 AA, the bulk of the rest of the protein consisting of
tandem repeats, each of around 30 AA and containing two
di-Cysteine motifs (Figure 3A). Both proteins have a dibasic recognition site for processing endoproteases giving
predicted mature proteins of 298 amino acids (Gfgalaxin)
and 292 amino acids (Amgalaxin). The proteins are also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/178

similar in terms of predicted isoelectric points; for the
mature proteins, pI values of 4.52 (Amgalaxin) and 4.53
(Gfgalaxin) were calculated. Gfgalaxin is a glycoprotein
[8]; however, only one of the two potential N-glycosylation (i.e. N-X-S/T motif) sites identified in Gfgalaxin is
conserved in the Acropora protein (Asn178). The high content of threonine and serine residues (14% and 8.9% in
Gfgalaxin and Amgalaxin, respectively) suggests that Oglycosylation may be more significant. However,
NetOGly http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/ predicts only two positions with significant likelihood of Oglycosylation in Amgalaxin and a single potential site in
Gfgalaxin.
The Amgalaxin-like proteins are related but divergent
The cDNAs encoding both of the Amgalaxin-like proteins
are larger than that encoding Amgalaxin, as are the predicted proteins themselves; Amgalaxin-like 1 is predicted
to be 660 AAs and Amgalaxin-like 2 is 582 AAs. The
Amgalaxin-like precursor proteins have a common
domain structure that differs from the galaxins by the
presence of a domain rich in acidic amino acid residues
(Figure 2B and 2C). As in the case of the galaxins, signal
peptides and Cys-rich repeat regions are present. Although
the repeat units in the Cys-rich domain of Amgalaxin-like
1 are approximately the same size (29 AAs) as those in the
galaxins, one difference that is potentially significant with
respect to protein folding and higher order structure is the
spacing of the cysteine residues. Whereas the galaxin proteins have two di-Cys motifs per repeat unit, Amgalaxinlike 1 has only one. The other two cysteine residues in
each repeat are separated by three amino acids. The basic
repeat unit in Amgalaxin-like 2 is 41 amino acids long and
contains three di-Cys motifs. As in the case of Amgalaxinlike 1, the repeats in Amgalaxin-like 2 are more similar to
each other than are the Amgalaxin repeats. When the consensus sequences of the Cys-rich repeats of the three proteins are compared it is apparent that Amgalaxin-like 2
and Amgalaxin share the greatest similarity (Figure 3).
Although consensus sequences can be constructed for the
galaxin and Amgalaxin-like repeats there is little similarity
between the proteins apart from the arrangement of the
dicysteine residues.

Amgalaxin and Amgalaxin-like 2 are both predicted to be
moderately acidic proteins (pIs of 4.52 and 4.6 respectively for the mature proteins), whereas the mature
Amgalaxin-like 1 protein is more basic (predicted pI of
9.09). The mature Amgalaxin-like proteins contain 13%
and 16% Aspartic (Asp) and Glutamic (Glu) acid residues,
predominantly located in one part of the protein, the
acidic domain (Figure 2B and 2C).

with high probability, but does not predict glycosylation
at the single N-X-S/T site in Amgalaxin nor at either of the
potential sites in the Galaxea protein. NetOGlyc http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/ does not predict any
likely O-glycosylation sites in Amgalaxin-like 1. The
mature Amgalaxin-like 2 protein contains three potential
N-glycosylation sites and several potential sites for Olinked glycosylation.

down onto the substratum and mesenteries are formed.
After the larva has flattened (Figure 5D, Figure 1C), the
Amgalaxin-like 1 expression domain expands radially from
the former aboral end of the planula to near the edge of
the now flat primary polyp (Figure 5H–I). This outer, submarginal ring of expression on the aboral side persists
until about the 12-septum stage (Figure 1D, E) before
gradually dissipating.

Expression analysis of A. millepora galaxin-related genes
Virtual northern analyses show that the Amgalaxin and
Amgalaxin-like genes each have distinct temporal expression patterns (Figure 4). We will therefore consider these
genes in the order in which they are expressed. Amgalaxinlike 1 is expressed strongly in pre-settlement planulae and
primary polyps, but the mRNA was not detected in adult
colonies (Figure 4A). Amgalaxin-like 2 expression is
restricted to post-settlement polyps (Figure 4B). By contrast, as in the case of its Galaxea counterpart [8], Amgalaxin is expressed in both of the post-metamorphosis
stages examined: weakly in primary polyps, but strongly
in adult colonies (Figure 4C). In the case of Amgalaxin,
two transcripts were detected on virtual northern blots
(Figure 4C). The strong upper band, with an apparent size
of approximately 2 Kb, corresponds to the sequence
shown; the lower (~1.7 Kb) band is assumed to correspond to an alternatively spliced product.

Consistent with the developmental virtual northern blot
(Figure 4B), Amgalaxin-like 2 expression is not present in
the pre-settlement planula larva (Figure 6A, B), first
appearing as the spindle-shaped planula shortens into a
sphere (Figure 6C, D) before flattening against the substratum (Figure 6E–J; Figure 1C). Thereafter, expression is
localized to an expanding ring in the aboral ectoderm
(Figure 6C–J), in its final stages (Figure 6H–J) resembling
the expression of Amgalaxin-like 1 (Figure 5I).

Amgalaxin-like 1 spatial expression is first detected in a
subset of aboral ectodermal cells of the mid-late planula
(Figure 5A–C, arrows; see Figure 1A and 1B), During settlement and metamorphosis, Amgalaxin-like 1 expression
remains restricted to this ectodermal cell population (Figure 5D–I; Figure 1B). At this time, changes in the overall
morphology of the larva can be observed as it flattens

Although virtual northern blot analysis showed that
Amgalaxin expression was much stronger in the adult,
expression was also present in immediate post-settlement
stages. This finding is consistent with in situ hybridization
results, which show expression beginning in an aboral
ring resembling those seen for Amgalaxin-like 1 and 2 (Figure 7A). However, there is one marked difference between
Amgalaxin and the galaxin-like transcripts in that Amgalaxin is expressed along the calcifying septa from shortly
after their initiation (Figure 7C–F; Figure 1D) and was still
apparent there at the twelve septum stage in the oldest
polyp which we attempted to stain (Figure 7F).

Discussion
All three of the Acropora galaxin-related proteins contain
cysteine-rich domains including tandemly repeating di-

represented on each blot are labelled across the bottom of the blot. Amgalaxin-like 1 expression first appears weakly even
before gastrulation and is strong both before and after settlement, but is not apparent in the adult. Amgalaxin-like 2 is expressed
exclusively immediately after settlement. Amgalaxin apparently has two isoforms both of which are expressed weakly immediately after settlement and more strongly in the adult. Abbreviations: PC = prawn chip, D = donut, Pre = presettlement planula

Cys motifs (Figures 2, 3). Although the consensus repeat
sequences have some similarities, evolutionary relationships between the three proteins are unclear at this stage.
Phylogenetic analyses of such divergent proteins would be
inappropriate, and to resolve their evolutionary relationships will require data from a phylogenetically representative range of corals, including basal clades. The presence
of the Cys-rich domains is consistent with these proteins
having a structural role in the organic matrix, as framework proteins are frequently Cys-rich [14,23] and tandem
repeats with conserved Cys residues are commonly found
in many types of extracellular matrix and cell surface
receptor proteins [23,24]. Double Cys motifs may form
intramolecular cross-links via disulfide bonds [23]. However, in vitro studies with synthetic peptides indicate that
dicysteine motifs may efficiently form cyclo-cystine loops
[25], limiting their ability to form intra- (or inter-) molecular cross links [11]. Fukuda et al. [8] suggest that therefore only the two terminal Cys residues may be available
for intermolecular disulfide bonds.
Although only distantly related to the scleractinian galaxins, proteins with similar properties have been identified

as components of the organic matrix of molluscs. For
example, di-Cys motifs are found in lustrin A from Haliotis
rufescens [23], the N14 protein from Pinctada maxima [26]
and in pearlin from Pinctada fucata [27]. These similarities
raise the possibility of common functions in biomineralization [8,11], either in establishing an overall structural
framework onto which other matrix components may be
deposited or in actively controlling crystal nucleation and
development.
The Amgalaxin-like proteins combine characteristics of
two distinct protein families involved in mollusc
calcification
Although Amgalaxin-like 1, Amgalaxin-like 2 and Amgalaxin are clearly structurally related, one major difference is
the presence of an acidic domain in the galaxin-like molecules that is absent from both the Acropora and Galaxea
galaxin proteins. Proteins rich in acidic amino acid residues are important components of the organic matrices of
a number of taxonomically diverse calcifying invertebrates. For example, Gotliv et al., [14] identified a family
of Asp-rich proteins associated with the mineral component of the bivalve Atrina rigida and suggested roles in

Figure 6
Developmental expression of Amgalaxin-like 2
Developmental expression of Amgalaxin-like 2. There is no expression in the planula larva (A-B). Expression first appears
as a ring on the aboral side of the planula as it shortens to form a sphere (C-D). Expression continues aborally, sometimes in a
zone (E) and sometimes in a submarginal ring (F-J) as the polyp ages. In (F)(H) and (J) the polyp is viewed orally and the aboral
expression is seen through the cleared tissue.

controlling mineralization. Ameye et al., [28] identified
an acidic N-glycoprotein in the organic matrix of spicules
from the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and Rahman et al.
[29-31] found acidic proteins that bind calcium in the
organic matrix of spicules of the alcyonarians Sinularia
polydactyla and Lobophytum crassum and reported that both
species possess aspartic acid rich matrices. Although there
are no direct precedents from scleractinians, Puverel et al.
[32] found that matrices of both Stylophora pistillata and
Pavona cactus were high in acidic amino acids (45.9 and
65.5% acidic amino acids, respectively) and obtained an
internal sequence from S. pistillata that contained a long
(36 residue) poly-Asp domain.
While the overall pI value for Amgalaxin-like 1 mature
protein is 9.09, charged amino acid residues are distributed in a non-uniform way: the values for the acidic and
Cys-rich regions are 3.21 and 12.39, respectively, and the
Amgalaxin-like 2 protein has a similar bipartite structure.
The pIs of the acidic domains are in the same range as
those reported for some acidic protein components of
molluscan matrices [14], while the pIs of the Cys-rich

regions resemble those of a family of matrix proteins from
the pearl oyster Pinctada fucada (pI values of 9.5 and 9.8;
[33]).
The Amgalaxin-like proteins therefore combine characteristics that in molluscs reside in two distinct families of
matrix proteins; an Asp-rich family [14], which might
actively control mineralization [8], and a family of basic
proteins that could be involved in linking hydrophilic
molecules to the framework of the organic matrix, or
binding carbonate [33].
What is the function of the Amgalaxin-like proteins?
Although the galaxin-like proteins have an overall structural similarity, they are otherwise dissimilar at the primary amino sequence level, and may be expected to fulfill
somewhat different functions during calcification. Their
sequential expression during development (Figure 4) is
consistent with this suggestion.

Deposition of the coral skeleton is thought to occur as a
two-step process; the first step is the formation of early

mineralization zones characterized by the presence of randomly oriented grains of CaCO3, followed by a second
step characterized by crystal-like fibers of aragonite. This
pattern of mineralization has been described in newly settled Pocillopora damicornis [19] and Porites porites [34] and
in axial polyps of Acropora cervicornis [35]. Although these
two kinds of calcification probably both occur throughout
the coral life cycle [3], several lines of evidence suggest
that granular calcification predominates during early coral
development, whereas calcification may be largely of the
fibrous type in adult colonies. However, it is only in newly
settled polyps that the two processes can be studied in isolation.
Goreau and Hayes [34] describe the beginnings of skeleton formation as the secretion of "mucoid substances"
which serve to cement the settling planula to the substratum and it is possible that this could be the function of the
Amgalaxin-like 1 protein. In contrast, in their descriptions
of the early post-settlement stages Vandermeulen and
Watabe [19] and Le Tissier [16] concentrated on the calcified elements of the early skeleton, perhaps because of the
preparation techniques that they used. The earliest post
settlement stage of Pocillopora shown by Le Tissier ([16],
Figure 2a) has a complete circular rim of calcified material
on the basal plate with scattered areas of calcification
within this circle, while in Porites Goreau and Hayes ([34],

Figure 4-2) show a portion of the rim of the plate as calcified with scattered areas of calcification on the plate.
Clode and Marshall [17] measured intracellular calcium
in pre- and post-settlement larvae of Pocillopora damicornis
using Calcium Orange fluorescence and found that levels
of intracellular calcium were lowest in a small area at the
aboral end of pre-settlement and immediate post-settlement planulae. This area corresponds to areas of Amgalaxin-like 1 expression shown in Figure 5A–E. Whether
there is a functional relationship between the two patterns
remains to be investigated. The expression of Amgalaxinlike 2, in contrast, essentially demarcates the outer limits
of the low Ca2+ area seen in Pocillopora. So, the observed
distribution patterns of the two Amgalaxin-like proteins
are consistent with a role for Amgalaxin-like 1 in laying
down the organic matrix in advance of calcification and
for Amgalaxin-like 2 in the process of calcification itself.
Another possibility is that transiently expressed proteins
such as the Amgalaxin-like molecules may actually be
inhibiting the formation of aragonite fibers in the basal
plate while inducing calcite deposition. Indeed, there is an
invertebrate precedent for such an action of acidic proteins since Addadi and Weiner [36] established that they
could alter the morphology of calcite crystals by adding an
acidic matrix protein from the bivalve mollusc Mytilus. It
remains to be seen if the galaxin-like proteins have similar
properties.

Amgalaxin and the mesenteries: fiber-like calcification
Following its initial expression in an aboral ring resembling those seen for the Amgalaxin-like transcripts (Figure
7A–B), Amgalaxin is expressed along the calcifying septa in
a pattern distinct from the Amgalaxin-like transcripts. The
close correspondence between the appearance of
mesenteries (and the implied initiation of septal mineralization) and the initiation of Amgalaxin expression is consistent with involvement of Amgalaxin-like in deposition
of the basal plate and protosepta, Amgalaxin could thus
be involved in the fiber-like calcification characteristic of
mesenteries. The strong expression of Amgalaxin in adult
Acropora and the abundance of the corresponding protein
in mature Galaxea colonies [8] imply that galaxins may be
involved in controlling the fiber-like aragonite deposition
characteristic of adult skeletons. According to Vandermeulen and Watabe [19] the basal plate of Pocillopora contains
a mixture of calcite and aragonite, so neither the circular
expression pattern nor septal expression is inconsistent
with the idea that the Amgalaxin-like molecules are associated with granular calcification and Amgalaxin with
aragonite. Aragonite deposition greatly predominates in
the adult coral and only Amgalaxin expression persists
into that stage.

dicted proteins in the non-calcifying cnidarians Nematostella (e.g. EDO38853.1) and Hydra (XP_002169304;
"usherin-like") having moderate degrees of similarity to
the scleractinian galaxins, and a "galaxin" has been
reported in the vestimentiferan tubeworm Riftia pachyptila
[40]. There are also database entries annotated as either
"similar to galaxin" or "galaxin-related" from Ciona and
Oikopleura (AAS21342), respectively. The product of the
Ciona ("similar to galaxin") gene ci0100148033 gives a
BlastP score of 2e-31 against Amgalaxin (for comparison,
BlastP similarity between Amgalaxin and Amgalaxin-like
1 is 4e-29) and the gene is expressed throughout the epidermis at the late tailbud stage (Aniseed database: http://
aniseed-ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/insitu.php?id=2732806),
while the Riftia "galaxin" was identified as body-wall specific in differential display experiments [40]. Together
with the Acropora data, these various lines of evidence suggest that the ancestral galaxins may have been structural
ECM proteins that were secondarily recruited to roles in
skeletogenesis during the Triassic, when scleractinians
first appear in the fossil record. Comparison of sequences
and expression data across a broad range of cnidarians
and other animals will be required to clarify the evolution
of this protein family.

Galaxins as examples of functional convergence after
secondary recruitment?
Massive calcification is a widespread trait across the animal kingdom; obvious examples are found among echinoderms, molluscs, vertebrates and corals. Many lines of
evidence indicate that the trait has evolved independently
in these lineages despite the involvement of some common classes of molecules (e.g. carbonic anhydrases; [37]).
Although the coral galaxins and the mollusc lustrin A/
N14/pearlin proteins may have separate evolutionary origins, their structural similarity suggests common function.
As in the case of mucoperlin, a component of the mollusc
organic matrix [38], galaxins resemble mucins in that they
have a high serine content, with consequent glycosylation
potential, and have a tandem repeat structure. This structure is consistent with the idea that these and other ECM
genes may have evolved from a mucin-type ancestor [39]
and may have calcium binding activity. However, the
experiments of Fukuda et al. [8] indicate that Gfgalaxin
does not bind Ca2+. The galaxin-like proteins, with their
two distinct domains, may combine the functions of two
distinct classes of mollusc proteins – the acidic proteins
that are thought to actively control mineralisation, and
basic proteins that either bind bicarbonate or form links
with the organic matrix. These hypothetical functions
require future testing in vitro.

Conclusion

Although proteins containing multiple di-Cys motifs are
widely distributed, clear orthologs of galaxin are so far
known only from scleractinians. However, there are pre-

The distribution of the transcripts reported here, in addition to the information available from other sources, indicate that proteins containing di-Cys repeats are frequently
involved in the formation of organic skeletons and may
have evolved from structural ECM proteins. Such knowledge is of particular importance at this time due to concern over the effects of ocean acidification on the ability of
marine organisms to calcify.

Methods
Fixation and storage
A. millepora embryos and larvae were fixed for 15–60 min
in 3.7% formaldehyde in Millipore-filtered seawater
(MPFSW) buffered to pH8.0 with Hepes buffer. Fixed
material was washed repeatedly in MPFSW, dehydrated
through a graded methanol series and stored in absolute
methanol at -20°C until needed.
In situ hybridization and image capture
Riboprobe synthesis and in situ hybridization were performed as reported by [41]. Following development
embryos were washed in PBT and gradually dehydrated to
70% glycerol in which they were stored. They were
mounted on microscope slides in 90% glycerol for photography. Digital images were captured with a Spot Camera mounted on a Wild Photomakroskop. Micrographs of
embryos of varying stages were moved to a common
white background and color and contrast adjusted for better visualization of staining patterns.

Sequencing
DNA sequencing was performed using Big Dye Terminator v. 3.1 (Applied BioSystems) with vector and internal
primers. Reactions were run on an ABI 3730 sequencer at
the Biomolecular Resource Facility (JCSMR, ANU).
Sequence anaysis was carried out using MacVector 9.5.2
(Accelrys) and Lasergene (DNASTAR).
RACE
A 520 bp Amgalaxin-like 2 sequence was identified in a
screen for genes which are differentially expressed during
metamorphosis (unpublished). 5' and 3' RACE were carried out with primary polyp RNA following the Clontech
SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit procedure. The
primers
used
were:
5'RACE:
5'GATGGTGCTG
TTTTTGGTGAGGAC3'; 3'RACE: 5'CTGCTGTAGTGG
TCGTGTCCTCAC3'. The PCR products were ligated into
pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The predicted cDNA sequence
was assembled from the overlapping 5' and 3' sequences
using SeqMan (DNASTAR). The existence of the predicted
transcript was confirmed by using the following 5' UTR
and 3' UTR primers to generate a product of the predicted
size and sequence: 5'UTRprimer: 5'AACAGAGGAGATAGC TAGTGT3'; 3'UTRprimer:5'GTCCTCCTCGAGGTTACA TCAC3'.
