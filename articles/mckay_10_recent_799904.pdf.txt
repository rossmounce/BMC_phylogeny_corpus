Taiwan endemic montane bird, Steere’s Liocichla
(Liocichla steerii)

Abstract
Background: The subtropical island of Taiwan is an area of high endemism and a complex topographic
environment. Phylogeographic studies indicate that vicariance caused by Taiwan’s mountains has subdivided many
taxa into genetic phylogroups. We used mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellites to test whether
the evolutionary history of an endemic montane bird, Steere’s Liocichla (Liocichla steerii), fit the general vicariant
paradigm for a montane organism.
Results: We found that while mountains appear to channel gene flow they are not a significant barrier for Steere’s
Liocichla. Recent demographic expansion was evident, and genetic diversity was relatively high across the island,
suggesting expansion from multiple areas rather than a few isolated refugia. Ecological niche modeling
corroborated the molecular results and suggested that populations of Steere’s Liocichla are connected by
climatically suitable habitat and that there was less suitable habitat during the Last Glacial Maximum.
Conclusions: Genetic and ecological niche modeling data corroborate a single history–Steere’s Liocichla was at
lower density during the Last Glacial Maximum and has subsequently expanded in population density. We suggest
that such a range-wide density expansion might be an overlooked cause for the genetic patterns of demographic
expansion that are regularly reported. We find significant differences among some populations in FST indices and
an admixture analysis. Though both of these results are often used to suggest conservation action, we affirm that
statistically significant results are not necessarily biologically meaningful and we urge caution when interpreting
highly polymorphic data such as microsatellites.

Background
Past climatic cycles have had a profound impact on the
levels and distribution of genetic diversity [1]. Despite
the fact that most biodiversity occurs in tropical areas,
most studies have focused on the temperate regions in
North America and Europe where the retreat of ice
sheets has left widespread genetic patterns consistent
with northward expansion from southern refugia [2].
This bias has left us with a poorer understanding of the
impact of climate cycles on the phylogeographical patterns of tropical taxa. However, initial phylogeographic
studies indicate that tropical areas have been impacted
by climatic cycles and that tropical species can have
deep intraspecific lineages with complex histories [2,3].

The subtropical island of Taiwan is an area of high
endemism as well as topologic, ecologic, and climatic
diversity. Taiwan first emerged from the sea following
the collision of the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates
approximately 5 mya [4,5]. Despite periodic connections
with the mainland during low sea levels [6], Taiwan’s
general isolation from mainland Asia has given rise to
many endemic species and subspecies. Within the
island, mountains have provided additional opportunities
for isolation. This is reflected in the phylogeographic
patterns found in some lowland taxa. For example, a
freshwater crab (Candidiopotamon rathbunae) [7], a
frog (Fejervarya limnocharis) [8], and a gecko (Gekko
hokouensis) [9] exhibit a common pattern of genetic
division east and west of the Central Mountain Range
(CMR), the prominent mountain range that runs
through much of the longitudinal length of the island

(Fig. 1). In contrast, many montane species show a pattern of north-south genetic division: e.g. Formosan
Wood Mouse (Apodemus semotus) [10], a ranid frog
(Rana sauteri) [11], and Siberian Weasel (Mustela sibirica) [12]. The observation of common phylogeographic
patterns in such varied taxa suggests vicariance as the
cause [13].
The east-west pattern of genetic division has been
found in lowland birds (i.e. Light-vented and Taiwan
Bulbul Pycnonotus sinensis and P. taivanus, [14]; Ringnecked Pheasant Phasianus colchicus, [15], however, no
montane bird has yet been phylogeographically surveyed. Determining whether montane birds were
affected by the same isolating events that generated
genetic divisions in other montane taxa is important for
understanding the impact of mountain vicariance in Taiwan. In a conservation context, uncovering historical
lineages is essential for guiding management efforts,
especially for species confined to single islands. Steere’s
Liocichla (Liocichla steerii) is a montane, resident bird
species endemic to Taiwan. It inhabits forest edge and
secondary growth from approximately 1000 m to 3000
m. Its dispersal ability was inferred to be low [16], and
high song diversity also suggests dispersal may be low
[17]. Therefore, Steere’s Liocichla is an ideal avian candidate to have developed the same genetic structure
observed in potentially less vagile vertebrates.
In this paper, we used mitochondrial DNA sequences
and nuclear microsatellites to investigate the evolutionary history of Steere’s Liocichla. Our primary goal was
to determine whether this endemic species showed the
same phylogeographic patterns of deep divergence that
characterize other montane vertebrates in Taiwan. As a
supplement to our genetic data, we used ecological
niche modeling to predict this species’ range during the
Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We also considered
whether any populations of Steere’s Liocichla might be
of special management concern for conservation efforts.

Methods
Sampling and laboratory methods

A total of 122 individuals was sampled from 13 populations located throughout the breeding range of the species (Fig. 1; Table 1). Birds were caught during the
breeding season (March to September) by mist net and
50 μl of blood was collected via brachial venipuncture.
Blood samples were stored in lysis buffer [18] at room
temperature until they could be transported to the
laboratory where they were stored at -20°C.
Whole genomic DNA was extracted using a standard
phenol-chloroform protocol followed by ethanol precipitation. The mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene was amplified from a subset of 91
individuals representing all populations (Table 1) using

Page 2 of 11

the primers L5216 and H6313 [19]. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed in 10 μl reactions on a
MJ Research PTC-100 thermocycler using a thermal
profile of 94°C for 4 min followed by 30 cycles of 1 min
at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C, and then 10
min at 72°C. Primers and excess dNTPs were removed
from the PCR product with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed on an ABI 3700 automated
sequencer using BigDye kit v. 3.0 according to recommended protocols (Applied Biosystems). All products
were sequenced in both directions. Usually, the amplification primers were sufficient to obtain >1,000 base
pairs (bp) of unambiguous sequence. However, whenever an ambiguous stretch of sequence was produced,
internal sequencing primers (L5758 and H5766; [19])
were used to clarify ambiguous bases. Complementary
strands were aligned and edited using SEQUENCHER v.
4.6 (GeneCodes Corporation). All sequences were
inspected individually using the raw spectrograph data
and every point mutation was checked for authenticity.
Sequences have been deposited in GenBank
(GU560065-GU560155).
All individuals were also genotyped at seven microsatellite loci. Four loci were developed specifically for
Steere’s Liocichla (lsgata17, lsgata 21, lsgata 24, lsgata
25; [20]) and three additional loci (GC-GATA10, GCGATA 15, GC-GATA 23; [21]) were originally developed for another babbler, the Hwamei (Garrulax
canorus). Forward primers were fluorescently labeled,
and the PCR cycling protocol followed the above for all
loci except GC-GATA 15, for which we used an annealing temperature of 50°C. Fragment analysis of the amplification product was conducted on a Beckman CEQ
8000 sequencer (Beckman Coulter).
Genetic data analysis

For mtDNA sequences, we estimated nucleotide diversity (π), number of haplotypes (nh), and haplotype diversity (h) for each population using the program DnaSP v.
4.9 [22]. For each population, we also computed Fu’s FS,
a neutrality statistic that is particularly sensitive to
population demographic expansion [23]. Its significance
was tested with 10,000 coalescent simulations using the
program ARLEQUIN 3.11 [24]. We used a mismatch
distribution analysis to estimate parameters of a demographic expansion using a generalized least-square
approach [25], as implemented in ARLEQUIN. To estimate the time of expansion, we used the formula τ = 2
μt [26], where τ is the time since the demographic
expansion, t is the number of generations, and μ is the
mutation rate. We obtained a 95% confidence interval
(CI) for τ with 1000 replicates of bootstrapping in
ARLEQUIN. We tested overall genetic structure of

The summary of genetic diversity includes sample size (n) nucleotide diversity (π), number of haplotypes (nh), haplotype diversity (h), Fu’s FS (FS), average
number of alleles per locus (A), allelic richness (AR), observed heterozygosity (HO), expected heterozygosity (HE), and inbreeding coefficient (FIS). Microsatellite
statistics are based on the average of seven polymorphic loci.

populations with a hierarchical analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA; [27]) in ARLEQUIN. To test for
restricted gene flow between the north and south groups
identified by previous studies, we assigned populations
to either a “north” or “south” group. Based on the study
of Hsu et al. [10], we used the Choushui River as the
boundary between groups (see Table 1). To visualize
haplotype relationships, we constructed a haplotype network using the parsimony-based algorithm of Templeton et al. [28] and implemented in the program TCS
1.21 [29]. Networks are generally better than bifurcating
trees at representing the relationships of intraspecific
phylogenies [30].
Microsatellite genotypes were tested for departures
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and evidence for
linkage disequilibrium using ARLEQUIN. To assess allelic variation within populations, we calculated allele frequencies, observed (Ho) and expected (He)
heterozygosities using GENEPOP 4.0.9 [31]. To correct
for sample size differences, we calculated allelic richness
using rarefaction with the program FSTAT 2.9.3 [32,33].
A sequential Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple comparisons [34]. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was applied to allele frequency data as a
measure of strong multilocus associations among populations. We performed a PCA with arcsinsquare root
transformed allelic frequencies using SAS (SAS
Institute).
To assess genetic structure between populations, we
computed pairwise FST and R ST values for all populations. RST is analogous to FST but incorporates a stepwise mutation model of evolution that was specifically

designed for microsatellite data [35]. Next, we performed another hierarchical AMOVA to determine the
proportions of microsatellite variation among and within
populations. Groups were defined in the same way as
for the mtDNA AMOVA. Fixation indices and AMOVA
were computed in ARLEQUIN. We also inferred genetic
population structure using a Bayesian assignment
approach implemented in the program BAPS 5.2
[36,37]. BAPS has been shown to perform better than
STRUCTURE when FST is small [38]. We began with a
mixture analysis to determine the most probable number of populations (K) given the data. We performed the
“clustering of groups of individuals” analysis, considering
clusters to contain a minimum of three individuals. We
estimated the number and composition of clusters considering upper limits of K at 2-10, 15, and 20. We ran
10 repetitions for each maximum K. Using the groups
identified in the mixture analysis, we conducted an
admixture analysis with 100 realizations from the posterior of the allele frequencies. We repeated the admixture five times to confirm consistent results. We also
performed a “spatial clustering of groups” analysis that
incorporates geographical information in the estimation
of the genetic population structure [37]. This approach
provides more statistical power to infer structure when
molecular data are weak. The spatial mixture analysis
followed the above procedure.
Finally, to test for an association between genetic distance (R ST ) and geographic distance, we performed a
Mantel test using GenAlEx 6 [39]. We ran two Mantel
tests with different geographic distances. The first used
“straight-line” distances, which were simply the shortest

McKay et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/71

distances between populations. However, Steere’s Liocichla has a restricted altitudinal range and is therefore
unlikely to traverse very high or very low altitudes.
Thus, the second Mantel test used “least-cost” distances,
which were calculated as the shortest distances between
populations assuming travel was limited to elevations
between 1000 m and 3000 m. Straight-line and leastcost geographic distances were calculated in ArcGIS 9
(ESRI).
Ecological niche modeling

We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to evaluate
our molecular analyses of demographic history and
population structure. Briefly, the general ENM approach
applied here generates a map of the expected distribution of a species using data on the environmental conditions where it is known to occur and randomly selected
background locations in the study area [40]. We used
Maxent version 3.2 [41] to model the potential geographic distribution of Steere’s Liocichla. Maxent is a
general approach for characterizing probability distributions from incomplete information [41]. Maxent computes a probability distribution that describes the
relative suitability of each grid cell as a function of the
environmental variables at all the known occurrence
locations, and when projected into geographic space it
produces a map of the species’ potential geographic
distribution.
To construct the model, we used 19 bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim dataset with 2.5-minute
spatial resolution [42] and 286 georeferenced breedingseason localities for Steere’s Liocichla. The climatic variables are derived from weather station data and quantify
annual variation in temperature and recipitation. Occurrence records within the same map pixel were removed
to avoid pseodoreplication. To calibrate the model, we
used quadratic features, and default parameters for the
number of background pixels, regularization, the convergence threshold, and the maximum number of iterations. We randomly selected 75% of the occurrence
locations to construct the model; the remaining 25%
were set aside to test the model. We calculated the area
under the receiving operator characteristic (AUC) to
test whether the model could discriminate between the
test localities and 10,000 localities randomly selected
from across Taiwan. Finally, we selected logistic output,
which ranges from 0-1 and quantify the probability of
suitable environmental conditions for the species in
each grid cell.
To estimate the geographic distribution and extent of
suitable climate for Steere’s Liocichla at the LGM
(21,000 years before present), we applied the contemporary ecological niche model to a set 19 bioclimatic
variables generated from CCSM3 paleoclimatic model.

Page 5 of 11

In doing so, we used the fade-by-clamp option in Maxent version 3.2 to remove heavily clamped pixels from
the final prediction. Failing to remove such pixels from
the region might lead to erroneously extensive predictions of suitable climate when transferring a model to a
different time period.
Distribution-based niche modeling makes at least
three important biological assumptions. First, it assumes
that a species distribution is at equilibrium with the present-day climate conditions. Second, it assumes that the
distribution of the species is not strongly influence by
biotic factors (e.g. competitors or predators). Third, it
assumes that the climatic tolerances of the species are
conserved over the timescale for which its distribution is
being modeled. If any of these conditions is violated, the
extent of climatically suitable habitat could be
underestimated.

Results
mtDNA

A total of 1026 bp was obtained from the mitochondrial
ND2 gene. There were 48 polymorphic and 20 parsimony informative sites resulting in 36 unique haplotypes. Nuclear copies of mitochondrial genes are known
in birds [43]. However, the large number of observed
haplotypes and an absence of nonsensical stop-codons
support a mitochondrial origin for our sequences [44].
Overall nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.00272 for all samples combined and ranged from 0.00143 to 0.00446
(Table 1). Overall haplotype diversity was 0.9 and ranged from 0.69 to 1.00 (Table 1). AMOVA indicated
non-significant differentiation (1%) between north and
south groups and significant population differentiation,
with 4.5% (P < 0.001) of the molecular variance partitioned among populations (Table 2). The mtDNA mismatch distribution was distinctly unimodel and did not
differ significantly from a model of sudden expansion
(Fig. 2). The estimate of τ was 2.9 (95% CI 0.7-5.5).
Using an avian ND2 mutation rate of 5.4 × 10-8 [45]
and assuming a generation time of two years, the time
of expansion was estimated to have occurred approximately 26000 (95% CI 6300-49700) ybp. The haplotype
network showed no obvious genetic structure (Fig. 3).
Microsatellites

The microsatellite dataset showed no statistically significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or evidence of lineage disequilibrium. There were a total of 137
alleles, and the average number of alleles per loci was 19.6.
The number of alleles per locus ranged from 9 in lsgata21
to 51 in lsgata17. Allelic richness ranged from 4.00 in
Aowanda to 7.57 in Liyuan (Table 1). PCA resulted in
relatively little explanatory power with only 15.6% and
12.6% of the variation explained by the first and second

principal components, respectively. It took seven principal
components to explain 75% of the variation. This suggests
weak multilocus associations among populations.
Overall, our analyses of population structure yielded
conflicting results with different populations highlighted
by different analyses. FST pairwise population comparisons resulted in significant differences between the Beidongyanshan population and every other population
(Table 3). RST pairwise indices were larger that FST comparisons (Table 3). This is expected because F ST estimated from highly variable markers is known to bias
estimates downwards. This is because the proportion of
the total variation among populations can never be very
high when there is a lot of variation within populations
[46]. RST comparisons did not highlight the Beidongyanshan population as particularly distinct. Rather, there
were several significant comparisons that seem haphazard with respect to geography (Table 3). AMOVA of
microsatellite alleles indicated nonsignificant amounts of
differentiation (0%) distributed between north and south
groups and little but significant population differentiation with 1.9% (P < 0.001) of the variance distributed
among populations (Table 2).
The mixture analysis in BAPS indicated the presence
of two distinct groups of populations, with the Meifeng
population the sole member of one group and all other
populations comprising the other group. The admixture

P-value

analysis assigned almost every individual to the correct
group (Fig. 4). In contrast, the spatial analysis that
incorporated geographic information about populations
suggested only a single group. The Mantel test indicated
a positive but non-significant correlation between
genetic (R ST ) and geographic distances (km) when
straight-line geographic distances were used (R2 = 0.01;
P = 0.23). However, when least-cost geographic distances were considered, the Mantel test resulted in a
positive and significant correlation (R2 = 0.07; P = 0.04).
This suggests that dispersal for these birds is, at least
somewhat, limited by altitude.
Ecological niche modeling

The predicted geographic distribution of Steere’s Liocichla
for the present-day and LGM are shown in Fig. 5. The
area under the receiving operator characteristic demonstrates that the model discriminated strongly between randomly selected locations across Taiwan, and the training
(AUC = 0.93) and test localities (AUC = 0.97).
Intriguingly, despite the many assumptions that are
made when constructing distributionbased niche models,
both the contemporary and LGM predictions are consistent with the findings of the molecular analyses. The
model predicts that populations of Steere’s Liocichla are
connected by climatically suitable habitats (Fig. 5A). This
result corroborates the analyses of population structure,
which suggest that the degree of gene exchange is related
to the geographic distance separating populations and
not strong barriers to dispersal. In addition, both the geographic extent and relative suitability of habitats are predicted to have been reduced at the LGM in comparison
to the present (Fig. 5B). The latter result parallels the
demographic analyses, which suggest that populations
may have increased in size in response to geographic
expansion of suitable habitats across Taiwan.

between observed (solid line) and expected frequencies under a
model of sudden expansion (dotted line) for the number of
pairwise differences.

While we found comparatively high levels of genetic
variation within populations of Steere’s Liocichla, these
results demonstrate a lack of genetic differentiation
among populations. This is in contrast to the deep
genetic divisions reported for other montane species in

Taiwan. The haplotype network showed no obvious
structure with respect to geography. The AMOVA indicated no genetic differentiation in either mtDNA or
microsatellites between north and south groups. However, significant amounts of differentiation were partitioned among populations, implying that populations
are not entirely panmictic and that dispersal among
populations is likely constrained. This was true of both
mtDNA and microsatellites, though the percent of variation among populations was higher for mtDNA. This is
expected because mtDNA has, on average, a four times
more rapid time to coalescence than nuclear loci
[47,48]. Mantel tests were significant when least-cost
distance was compared with genetic distance. This suggests that mountains, while not strict barriers to gene

flow, do channel gene flow through a certain altitudinal
range.
A lack of genetic structure has been found in other
mountain species in Taiwan (e.g. White-bellied Rat Niviventer culturatus, [49] and Taiwan Alpine Skink Sphenomorphus taiwanensis, [50]). This might result from a
recent colonization of Taiwan or historical gene flow
between populations. We favor a scenario of historical
gene flow for Steere’s Liocichla, because it is an endemic
species that’s purported closest relative in Mainland
China (L. omeiensis; [51]) was estimated to have
diverged about 5 million years ago [52]). This suggests

have been historically well-connected by gene flow
seems plausible given the dispersal potential of volant
birds, and the geographic continuity of climatically suitable habitats over time (Fig. 5).
We also find evidence for a recent demographic
expansion in Steere’s Liocichla. For example, Fu’s F S,
which is particularly sensitive to departures from

population equilibrium [23], was negative for most
populations and significantly negative when all samples
were combined. The distinctly unimodal mismatch distribution did not differ significantly from a model of
sudden expansion. The estimated time of this expansion
was consistent with an expansion centered around the
time of the Last Glacial Maximum. However, it should

McKay et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/71

be noted that there is a large confidence interval associated with this estimate as well as assumptions involving mutation rate and generation time. Ecological
niche modeling indicated that there was less suitable
habitat for Steere’s Liocichla during the LGM. However,
marginal habitat seems to have been distributed across
the island. This suggests that Steere’s Liocichla occupied
much of its current range during the LGM, but populations were less dense. Thus, as habitat improved with
the warming climate, population densities increased
leaving a pattern of recent demographic expansion. This
scenario is consistent with the genetic data, which show
similar levels of genetic diversity across the island rather
than isolated pockets of unusually high diversity that
might be interpreted as refugia. Population density
increases associated with improving habitat quality following the Last Glacial Maximum might have had an
underappreciated contribution to genetic patterns of
expansion, especially in cases where dramatic spatial
expansion from refugia seems unlikely. It would be
interesting to determine whether other montane bird
species in Taiwan exhibit similar patterns.
Conservation implications

Taken separately, the results of some of our analyses
could be used as evidence that some populations should
be of special management concern for conservation
efforts. For example, we found significant differences in
microsatellite FST between the Beidongyanshan population and all other populations. This is surprising because
there is no reason to expect restricted gene flow to or
from the Beidongyanshan population; it is centrally
located, only two km from the Meifeng population, and
there is adequate habitat and a continuous population
of Steere’s Liocichla between Beidongyanshan and Meifeng. However, caution must be taken when interpreting
FST distances associated with highly polymorphic loci.
Hedrick [46] has shown that relatively weak bottlenecks
can cause statistically significant differences in microsatellite FST distances. There is evidence that the Beidongyanshan population has recently undergone a
population bottleneck and this would explain why its
gene frequencies might appear to differ from the other
populations.
First, the Beidongyanshan population had the lowest
amount of allelic richness. Second, it had a high
observed heterozygosity (H O ) relative to its expected
heterozygosity (H E ), as indicated by the smaller than
zero, and nearly significant, FIS value (Table 1). (Note
that the AW population has a smaller FIS value, but this
likely had a smaller affect on FST significance because
the sample size is much smaller.) A large HO relative to
H E is expected shortly after a population bottleneck
because rare alleles are quickly lost, resulting in a

Page 9 of 11

decrease in the HE. At the same time, HO levels are relatively unaffected until a new mutation-drift equilibrium
can be reached because HO is mostly dictated by common alleles. Such a bottleneck may have been caused by
anthropogenic disturbance from the construction of an
agricultural research station at Beidongyanshan, from
typhoon related disturbance, or from stochastic fluctuations in local demography. A change in FST caused by a
bottleneck is likely ephemeral, existing only until a new
mutation-drift equilibrium is reached. Thus, individuals
sampled from Beidongyanshan in the future may not
show significant FST differentiation from other populations. We note that in such a situation, FST may reflect
biologically relevant differences between populations,
but this differentiation might not actually result from
restricted gene flow and might be ephemeral and not of
management concern. Clearly, caution should be taken
before making conservation recommendations based on
the results of FST alone.
Because it considers information on the length of
alleles, RST is generally thought to perform better than
FST with microsatellite data, especially when there are
many alleles. In contrast to FST results, RST comparisons
did not highlight the Beidongyanshan population as particularly distinct. Instead, the few significant values of
RST do not seem to correlate with geography. For example, there is a significant RST value between Meifeng and
Beidongyanshan, which again are only two km apart,
but no significant differences between Meifeng and
Moshan or Chilan, which are much farther apart. Overall, significant RST values seem haphazard with respect
to geography. Again, the statistical power associated
with highly variable markers, such as microsatellites, is
high, so statistically significant differences should not
always be taken to mean biologically significant differences [46]. It should also be noted that statically nonrandom patterns may result from the stochastic nature
of population structure [53].
Bayesian analysis of population structure using BAPS
found that including the Meifeng population in the pool
of remaining populations decreased the fit of a panmictic total, and thus two groups were identified. Again,
this is surprising because Meifeng is only two km from
Beidongyanshan and there is adequate habitat and a
continuous population of Steere’s Liocichla between
these two populations. However, the spatial analysis in
BAPS, which incorporates information about the geographic location of populations, suggested that all populations represented one group. If separating the Meifeng
population in the original BAPS analysis was a borderline case, it is understandable that the spatial model suggests only a single population (J. Corander pers. comm.).
This was probably caused by an excess of private alleles
in the Meifeng population. Possibly as the result of

McKay et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/71

Page 10 of 11

sampling error, Meifeng had an inordinate number of
private alleles and all sampled Meifeng individuals had
at least one private allele. This would explain why the
admixture analysis was able to accurately assign Meifeng
individuals to population. Some authors have suggested
private alleles are important for conservation. For example, Funk et al. [54] defined subspecies for conservation
and included the criteria that they contain “unique
alleles or haplotypes.” We question the practicality of
this particular criterion when deciding conservation
priority or making taxonomic decisions because with
highly polymorphic loci, most, if not all, populations are
likely to contain at least some unique alleles. In our
study, all 13 populations we sampled had unique alleles.
Overall, some of our analyses might seem to indicate
biologically relevant differentiation of a population.
However, different analyses disagree about which populations are distinct and no analysis strongly supported
the distinctiveness of any population. Therefore, based
on these data, none of our sampled populations should
have higher conservation priority than any other.

to Taiwan (BDM). This work was performed in compliance of the laws and
regulations of Taiwan and the United States. Birds were netted in Taiwan
under permit number 090133350, and imported into the United States
under USDA import permit number 49226.

Conclusions
We did not find the deep genetic divisions reported in
other montane species in Taiwan. Instead, populations
of Steere’s Liocichla have been historically connected by
gene flow, though inter-population migration appears
largely confined to middle elevations. We found evidence of a demographic expansion that can be dated to
the Last Glacial Maximum. Genetic diversity was high
across the geographic range, indicating expansion was
range-wide, rather than expansion from isolated refugia.
Ecological niche modeling corroborated genetic data
and suggested that habitat for Steere’s Liocichla may
have been of poorer quality during the Last Glacial
Maximum. Both sources of data are consistent with a
single historical scenario–Steere’s Liocichla was at lower
density during the Last Glacial Maximum and has subsequently expanded in population density. We suggest
that such a range-wide density expansion might be an
overlooked cause for the genetic patterns of demographic expansion that are regularly reported. We find
significant differences among some populations in FST
indices and an admixture analysis. Though both of these
results are often used to suggest conservation action, we
affirm that statistically significant results are not necessarily biologically meaningful.
