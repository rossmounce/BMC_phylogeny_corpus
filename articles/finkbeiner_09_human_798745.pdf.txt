Abstract
Human astroviruses are a leading cause of gastrointestinal disease. Since their discovery in 1975, 8
closely related serotypes have been described in humans, and more recently, two new astrovirus
species, astrovirus MLB1 and astrovirus VA1, were identified in diarrhea patients. In this study, we
used consensus astrovirus primers targeting the RNA polymerase to define the diversity of
astroviruses present in pediatric patients with diarrhea on two continents. From 416 stool
specimens comprising two different cohorts from Vellore, India, 35 samples were positive. These
positive samples were analyzed further by either sequencing of the ~400 bp amplicon generated by
the consensus PCR or by performing additional RT-PCR specific for individual astroviruses. 19
samples contained the classic human astrovirus serotypes 1-8 while 7 samples were positive for the
recently described astrovirus MLB1. Strikingly, from samples that were positive in the consensus
PCR screen but negative in the specific PCR assays, five samples contained sequences that were
highly divergent from all previously described astroviruses. Sequence analysis suggested that three
novel astroviruses, tentatively named astroviruses VA2, MLB2 and VA3, were present in these five
patient specimens (AstV-VA2 in 2 patients, AstV-MLB2 in 2 patients and AstV-VA3 in one patient).
Using the same RT-PCR screening strategy, 13 samples out of 466 tested stool specimens collected
in St. Louis, USA were positive. Nine samples were positive for the classic human astroviruses. One
sample was positive for AstV-VA2, and 3 samples were positive for AstV-MLB2 demonstrating that
these two viruses are globally widespread. Collectively, these findings underscore the tremendous
diversity of astroviruses present in fecal specimens from diarrhea patients. Given that a significant
fraction of diarrhea etiologies is currently unknown, it is plausible that these or other yet
unrecognized astroviruses may be responsible for at least part of the undiagnosed cases.

Findings
It is estimated that diarrhea results in 2 million deaths and
1.4 billion non-fatal cases each year, primarily in young

children [1,2]. The viruses that cause the greatest proportion of diarrhea are rotaviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses
and astroviruses [3-7]. However, while there are many

known agents of diarrhea, an etiologic agent cannot be
found in ~40% of diarrhea cases according to most epidemiological studies [8-10].
Astroviruses are known to infect a variety of human and
animal hosts. Astroviruses were first discovered in
humans in 1975 [11]. Until 2008, human infections were
thought to be limited to 8 closely related serotypes (hereafter referred to as "classic" human astroviruses). We
recently identified two highly divergent members of the
astrovirus family, astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1) [12-14]
and astrovirus VA1 (AstV-VA1) [15], in patients with sporadic diarrhea and patients from a gastroenteritis outbreak, respectively. In parallel, a spate of new astrovirus
species have also been detected recently in dogs, cheetahs,
sea lions, dolphins and bats [16-20]. Strikingly, more than
100 genetically distinct astroviruses have been detected in
different bat species[17,20].
In humans, astroviruses predominantly affect children
under the age of 2, the elderly, and immunocompromised
individuals [21]. Up to ~10% of sporadic cases of nonbacterial diarrhea in children are attributed to the classic
human astroviruses [4,5,22-24]. No definitive disease
association has been established yet for the recently discovered AstV-MLB1 or AstV-VA1.
Following the discovery and complete genome sequencing of AstV-MLB1, we designed consensus PCR primers in
order to detect both classic astroviruses and AstV-MLB1 in
a single assay [14]. In the current study, this astrovirus
consensus PCR assay was used to define the diversity of
astroviruses present in pediatric patients with diarrhea in
Vellore, India and St. Louis, USA. We report not only the
first description of AstV-MLB1 in India, but also the detection of three additional distinct and highly divergent
novel astroviruses.
Two sets of approximately 200 samples each (n = 416)
collected in 2005 and 2006 in Vellore, India were tested in
this study. The first set of community-based samples was
from a birth cohort. The cohort of 452 children was
recruited between 2002 and 2003, followed for 3 years
with twice-weekly home visits and collection of stool during every diarrheal episode (n = 1955). The second set of
samples was from single point collection of diarrheal
stool from hospital based surveillance for children under
the age of 5 years hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis in
3 hospitals in India from 2005 to 2007. For both community and hospital based studies, the severity of the
diarrheal episode was recorded using the 20 point Vesikari
scale developed for rotaviral gastroenteritis, which
includes number and duration of diarrhea and vomiting
episodes, presence of fever and dehydration and classifies
gastroenteritis as mild, moderate, severe and very severe

[25]. The samples tested were selected at random from
these cohorts, with equal numbers taken from each
month over a 12-month period. In St. Louis, 466 stool
specimens that were sent for bacterial culture to the clinical microbiology laboratory at the St. Louis Children's
hospital between June 2008 and March 2009 were analyzed.
For each sample from Vellore, 200 μL of a ~20% fecal suspension were extracted using the Boom method [26] and
the extracted RNA was eluted into 40 μL of water. The St.
Louis stool samples were diluted at a 1:6 ratio (wt/vol) in
phosphate-buffered saline and then RNA was extracted
from 330 μL of each sample using a COBAS Ampliprep
Version 3.1.0 (ROCHE, Indianapolis, IN). The RNA was
eluted in a final volume of 200 μL. A two-phase screening
strategy to detect and identify astroviruses was used. In the
first phase, the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) was used to screen 3 μL of extracted material
from each sample using the consensus primers SF0073
(5'-GATTGGACTCGATTTGATGG-3') and SF0076 (5'CTGGCTTAACCCACATTCC-3') that target highly conserved regions in the ORF 1b (RNA polymerase) of astroviruses. Samples that were positive in the first round of
screening were then subjected to additional RT-PCR
screenings with primers specific for classic human astrovirus [Mon269 (5'-CAACTCAGGAAACAGGGTGT-3') and
Mon270 (5'-TCAGATGCATTGTCATTGGT-3')] [27], AstVMLB1 [SF0053 (5'-CTGTAGCTCGTGTTAGTCTTAACA-3')
and SF0061 (5'-GTTCATTGGCACCATCAGAAC-3')], and
AstV-VA1 [SF0178 (5'-GCTGTCACCGTCTCTGCCACCAT-3') and SF0179 (5'-TCTACATACAAGGATGCAGCATG-3')], using the QIAGEN One-Step RT-PCR kit under
the following cycling conditions: 30 min RT step, 94°C
hold for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s,
56°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 50 s.
Of the total 416 samples screened in Vellore, India, 35
tested positive with the astrovirus consensus primers (Figure 1). In the second phase of RT-PCR screening, 19/35
tested positive for classic human astroviruses, while an
additional 6/35 tested positive for AstV-MLB1 (Figure 1).
The remaining 10 samples were negative in specific classic
human astrovirus, AstV-MLB1, and AstV-VA1 assays. Four
of the samples could not be cloned despite repeated
attempts and were not further characterized. We were able
to clone and sequence the ~400 bp amplicons generated
by the consensus primers in the other 6 samples. One of
these samples was 97% identical at the amino acid level to
the reference AstV-MLB1 sequence in Genbank. The fact
that this virus was not detected by the AstV-MLB1 specific
primers in the second phase of screening may be due to
sensitivity issues or possibly the result of additional
sequence variation in this isolate. Strikingly, three distinct
sequences highly divergent from previously described

astroviruses were detected in the other 5 samples. In two
of the samples, the amplicons shared 68.5 and 69.2%
amino acid identity to AstV-VA1. This virus has provisionally been named astrovirus VA2 (AstV-VA2). The two
AstV-VA2 sequences were 98.6% identical to each other at
the nucleotide level (Figure 2). The second virus, tentatively named astrovirus VA3 (AstV-VA3), was detected in
one sample and shared 73.3% identity to AstV-VA1 and
71.9-72.6% identity to AstV-VA2. Finally, the two remaining samples had sequences that shared 80.8% amino acid
identity to AstV-MLB1 and shared 100% nucleotide identity to each other. This virus has tentatively been named
astrovirus MLB2 (AstV-MLB2).

itive for classic human astroviruses, while none of them
tested positive for AstV-MLB1 or AstV-VA1 (Figure 1). The
amplicons generated by the consensus primers from the
remaining 4 samples that were negative in the second
phase RT-PCR assays were sequenced. AstV-VA2 was
detected in 1 of the samples and AstV-MLB2 was detected
in the remaining 3 samples demonstrating that both of
these viruses are present in both India and the United
States. Sequence comparisons of all isolates of AstV-VA2
and AstV-MLB2 from both Vellore and Saint Louis are
shown in Figure 2.

All of the samples which were positive for AstV-MLB1,
AstV-MLB2, AstV-VA2, and AstV-VA3 in Vellore were
obtained from the community based studies. In the samples positive for these viruses, the diarrheal episodes were
mainly mild or moderate, with only two episodes classified as severe based on Vesikari score [25]. All children
recovered from their illness within a week at most, with
only 4 episodes lasting longer than 3 days.

To further characterize these viruses, RNA extracted from
one stool sample positive for AstV-VA2 and one sample
positive for AstV-MLB2 was sequenced using a combination of RT-PCR and pyrosequencing on a Roche Genome
Sequencer as described [15]. Contigs of 5977 bp for AstVVA2 and 3980 bp for AstV-MLB2 were assembled and
then confirmed by generating a series of overlapping
amplicons by RT-PCR. All sequences have been deposited
in Genbank [MLB2: GQ502188-GQ502192; VA2:
GQ502193-GQ502195; VA3: GQ502196]

Of the 466 samples screened from St. Louis, MO, 13 tested
positive with the astrovirus consensus primers (Figure 1).
In the second phase of RT-PCR screening, 9/13 tested pos-

in GenBank using ClustalX1.83. PAUP was used to generate maximum parsimony trees with 1,000 bootstrap replicates [28]. The phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated that
even based on this highly conserved region of the astrovirus genome, these three new viruses are highly divergent
from any of the previously known astroviruses (Figure
3A). A phylogenetic tree using the complete ORF1b
sequence from both AstV-VA2 and AstV-MLB2, along with
available complete ORF1b sequences in Genbank gave
similar results (Figure 3B). The topology of these trees suggests that there are multiple clades of astroviruses present
in humans: the classic human astrovirus clade, a second
clade of MLB1-like viruses and a third clade of VA1-like
viruses.
In this report, consensus astrovirus primers demonstrated
that AstV-MLB1 is present in India. This observation
expands the known geographic range of AstV-MLB1
beyond Australia and North America to now include Asia.
Unexpectedly, consensus astrovirus RT-PCR screening
also demonstrated sequences from three highly divergent

novel astroviruses were present in the Indian samples, two
of which were also detected in St. Louis. This study, coupled with the recent discoveries of AstV-MLB1 and AstVVA1, demonstrate that there is a much greater diversity of
astroviruses that can be found in human stool than the 8
classic human astroviruses. Furthermore, a very recent
report described 3 distinct astroviruses most closely
related to ovine and mink astroviruses, which may be similar to AstV-VA1, AstV-VA2 and AstV-VA3 [29]. As
sequences from that report are not yet available in Genbank, we have not been able to make definitive comparisons. The detection of these viruses in human stool may
be the result of either non-infectious dietary ingestion or
bona fide human infection. The role these three new
viruses play in diarrhea or other human diseases is currently unclear; however, given the fact that most known
members of the Astroviridae family, regardless of host, can
cause diarrheal disease, it is tempting to speculate that one

or more of these viruses may be responsible for some fraction of the estimated 40% of diarrhea cases of unknown
etiology. Further experimentation is needed to define the
role of these viruses in diarrhea or other human diseases.
