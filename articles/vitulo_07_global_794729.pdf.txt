Abstract
Background: Vibrionaceae represent a significant portion of the cultivable heterotrophic sea bacteria; they strongly
affect nutrient cycling and some species are devastating pathogens.
In this work we propose an improved phylogenetic profile analysis on 14 Vibrionaceae genomes, to study the evolution
of this family on the basis of gene content.
The phylogenetic profile is based on the observation that genes involved in the same process (e.g. metabolic pathway or
structural complex) tend to be concurrently present or absent within different genomes. This allows the prediction of
hypothetical functions on the basis of a shared phylogenetic profiles. Moreover this approach is useful to identify putative
laterally transferred elements on the basis of their presence on distantly phylogenetically related bacteria.
Results: Vibrionaceae ORFs were aligned against all the available bacterial proteomes. Phylogenetic profile is defined as
an array of distances, based on aminoacid substitution matrixes, from single genes to all their orthologues. Final
phylogenetic profiles, derived from non-redundant list of all ORFs, was defined as the median of all the profiles belonging
to the cluster. The resulting phylogenetic profiles matrix contains gene clusters on the rows and organisms on the
columns.
Cluster analysis identified groups of "core genes" with a widespread high similarity across all the organisms and several
clusters that contain genes homologous only to a limited set of organisms. On each of these clusters, COG class
enrichment has been calculated. The analysis reveals that clusters of core genes have the highest number of enriched
classes, while the others are enriched just for few of them like DNA replication, recombination and repair.
Conclusion: We found that mobile elements have heterogeneous profiles not only across the entire set of organisms,
but also within Vibrionaceae; this confirms their great influence on bacteria evolution even inside the same family.
Furthermore, several hypothetical proteins highly correlate with mobile elements profiles suggesting a possible
horizontal transfer mechanism for the evolution of these genes. Finally, we suggested the putative role of some ORFs
having an unknown function on the basis of their phylogenetic profile similarity to well characterized genes.

Background
Over the past ten years, a great number of microbial
genomes have been sequenced covering a wide representation of prokaryots as well as multiple strains of some
species. The study of these genomes both by computational and experimental approaches has highly improved
our understanding on physiology, phylogenetic relationship and pathogenicity of many organisms. Furthermore,
it has provided new knowledge on microbial genome evolution, revealing a gene core shared by the great majority
of bacteria, genes characteristic of particular groups and
"novel" genes that possibly originated by lateral gene
transfer from some unknown source.
Analysis performed on closely related genomes revealed
that a substantial fraction of genes in any genome seem to
be strain specific. These genes might sometime arise by
gene duplication followed by a rapid divergence, or by lineage-specific loss of genes in one strain, resulting in a
unique gene in other strains. However, there are several
lines of evidence indicating that lateral gene transfer may
be the main mechanism to acquire novel genes. Indeed,
this could be one of the main forces driving bacterial
adaptation and evolution. Phage DNA is thought to be
one of the main vectors for lateral gene transfer among
bacteria [1] and many virulence factors from bacterial
pathogen are phage encoded [2]. For example, the genes
for CT, the most important virulence factor of V. cholerae,
are encoded in the genome of phage CTXφ, integrated in
the bacterial chromosome 1.
Since lateral gene transfer plays a relevant role in bacterial
evolution, the reconstruction of phylogeny is very complex and phylogenetic trees built by standard sequence
analysis may not lead to a reliable picture of the evolutionary history. In fact, alternative trees can be obtained
when different proteins are considered.
For many aspects the classification of bacteria on the basis
of their global gene content may give a better description
of their evolutionary history. This may be particularly
important when bacteria of the same group are compared,
since newly acquired genes could be relevant to confer
peculiar features that allows the exploitation of different
ecological niches.
In this study we propose a bioinformatic procedure to
investigate bacterial genome evolution, taking into
account the global gene content, as well as sequence similarity. We based our analysis on modified phylogenetic
profiles [3]; however, we do not consider only the presence/absence of orthologue genes, but also their distance,
based on a substitution matrix.

A phylogenetic profile is a non-sequence-homologybased method developed to infer a possible functional
relationship between genes. It is based on the idea that
proteins that are involved in the same metabolic pathway
or structural complex are likely to evolve in a correlate
fashion and during evolution appear phylogenetically
linked, showing a tendency to be either preserved or eliminated as a whole. Therefore, genes showing similar phylogenetic profiles are likely to be functionally related. We
extended the use of phylogenetic profiles to produce an
evolutionary tree based on a hierarchical clusterization of
organisms with similar phylogenetic profiles.
For this study we took the whole gene dataset of 320
prokaryotic genomes, however, we limited the analysis to
the orthologous groups that are present in at least one of
the 14 considered species of the Vibrionaceae family. These
bacteria belong to the Gammaproteobacteria group and are
highly abundant in aquatic environment, they strongly
influence nutrient cycling and various species are also devastating pathogens. Since we focused our analysis on this
particular group, the aim of this study is not the construction of a global evolutionary tree, but rather a Vibrionaceae
perspective of bacterial diversity, based on phylogenetic
profiles.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic matrix
The analysis was performed on 14 bacteria belonging to
the Vibrionaceae family (Table 1). The redundant list of
Vibrionaceae ORFs was clustered to reduce the number of
proteins to analyze and the phylogenetic profile for each
cluster was calculated as described in the Method section.

Many authors proposed and successfully applied different
measure methods to calculate the phylogenetic profile
values.
Pellegrini et al. [3] firstly proposed a phylogenetic profile
described as a string of bits, each bit representing the
absence or presence of an homologous gene in a given
genome. This method lacks a weighting procedure, giving
the same weight (value 1) to all the sequences that are
considered homologous given a similarity threshold.
Enault and colleagues proposed an improved phylogenetic profile based on a normalized Blastp bit score [4].
This method, compared to the approach implemented by
Pellegrini, allows weighting each point of the profile proportionally to the length and the quality of the alignment.
Jingchun and colleagues optimized the phylogenetic profiles method by integrating phylogenetic relationships
among reference organisms and sequence homology
information, based on E-value score, to improve prediction accuracy [5].

The measure index I proposed in this work is similar to
the others described above, taking into account both the
quality and the length of the alignment using a substitution matrix. Moreover our approach considers also the
total length of the sequences, penalizing good alignments
occurring between ORFs having different lengths and taking into consideration that ORFs could differentiate
mainly for the presence of functional domains.
The final phylogenetic profile for each cluster was defined
as the median of all the profiles belonging to the cluster,
named "meta-profile", which describes the profile of conserved ORFs belonging to an entire family.
Hierarchical cluster analysis
A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the entire
phylogenetic profile matrix and it was calculated a statistical support based on bootstrap method for the nodes of
the columns tree (Fig 1). The branch tree colors represent
the bootstrap percentage support. This constitutes a phylogenetic tree based on gene content using Vibrionaceae
ORFs as a reference. Genomes belonging to the same taxonomic group tend to cluster together and the Vibrionaceae species are closely related. As expected, according
to the Vibrionaceae branch lengths it is evident that variability within this group is higher compared to the other
groups. The dataset used for phylogenetic matrix calculation is indeed composed by Vibrionaceae ORFs. This
implies that the similarity measures between these ORFs
and the corresponding orthologues will be nearly zero in
most of the other species and significantly higher in the
Vibrionaceae family, increasing the variability into this
group. Moreover the average percentage of clusters shared
by the Vibrionaceae members is only 47.5% (average
number of shared clusters divided by the total number of
clusters) that again indicates a high variability inside this
family. It is also interesting to note that organisms belonging to the same or closely related taxa split into different

subgroups. This highlights the existence of a high variability among lineages, due to genetic and evolutionary processes such as lateral gene transfer, concerted evolution and
gene duplication [6]. In terms of gene content, the organisms more related to the Vibrionaceae belong to the
gamma and beta proteobacteria. In particular Altermonadales, Enterobacteriales and Burkholderiales are closely related
to Vibrionaceae, and share the higher number of cluster of
genes (average percentage of 20%). As expected, Archea
are the most distant group sharing just 3.8% of clusters.
Clusters and genes distribution, as shown in Fig 2, reveals
that the number of clusters and genes shared by the organisms decreases as the number of organisms considered
increases. The analysis was performed considering for
each cluster profile the number of organisms sharing the
same numbers of clusters (and genes). The majority of
gene cluster groups no more than 21 species on a total of
320. The highest blue spike corresponds to the higher
number of genes shared by 105 groups of 14 organisms.
Among these groups, as expected, Vibrionaceae are highly
represented. Other species represented are Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H and Shewanella oneidensis, that belong to
the Alteromonadales family.
The cluster analysis performed on genes is shown in Fig.
3. From now on, to avoid confusing interpretation
between clusters derived from the cluster analysis and
cluster derived from the ORFs clustering we will use the
term "gene" in place of cluster of ORFs.
The different gradient of color, from bright to dark red,
represents decreasing similarity values. The cluster analysis allows the detection of three main groups of genes. The
first one (Fig 3, panel B) contains the most conserved and
established genes shared almost by all the organisms.
These core genes can be defined as the set of all genes
shared as orthologous by all members of an evolutionary

and AT bias affect all its genes, including the 16S rRNA
[8,9].

The ORFs belonging to these clusters are predicted to codify for the ATP binding subunit of ABC transporters
(annotated as ABC-type polar amino acid transport system, ABC-type antimicrobial peptide transport system,
ABC-type histidine transport system and ABC-type transport system involved in lysophospholipase L1 biosynthesis). This finding is surprising since this is the first report
where these ORFs are assigned to the core genes. Anyway
two different explanations can be traced. First, it is known
that the ABC transporters represent an essential transport
system in the prokaryotes and that their ATP binding subunits are apparently overrepresented compared to the
other two subunits (ligand binding and permease subunit) in all genomes sequenced thus far [7]. Second, one
organism, Buchnera aphidicola, presents these genes with a
similarity just below the cut-off used for the analysis, but
they have been considered since it is well known that in
this mutualistic endosymbiont the accelerated evolution

The dataset used for the analysis includes genomes in
draft quality (Vibrio cholerae 0395, Vibrio cholerae MO10,
Vibrio cholerae RC385, Vibrio cholerae V51, Vibrio cholerae
V52, Photobacterium profundum 3TCK, Vibrio MED222,
Vibrio splendidus12B01). Wrong ORFs prediction or missing genes due to incomplete genome sequences can
explain the low number of core genes identified. To avoid
such problems we repeated the analysis excluding the
draft genomes and thus considering 312 genomes. The
results, reported in Table 2, show an increased number of
the core genes and in particular ribosomal proteins and
tRNA synthetase, as reported by Charlesbois and Doolittle
[10]. This could be considered as a sort of "minimal
genome" containing the group of genes that are necessary
to maintain a free-living organism.
The low number of genes shared by all the organisms can
be due to many factors. First of all we used the Vibrionaceae ORFs as a reference, limiting the number of genes

we were able to identify. It was further demonstrated that
the core gene size decreases as more genome sequences
are analyzed [10].
Genes that are considered to belong to the core set when
close organisms are compared, are classified as flexible
genes when distantly related genomes are analyzed [6].
Finally, genes within core genomes might be transferred
or replaced, introducing new versions of existing genes
into genomes. Such transfers can replace even highly conserved genes by non-homologous counterparts but the
advantages provided are difficult to explain. It is also to
take into consideration that many symbiotic and parasitic
bacteria undergo a reduction of their genomes, loosing
many genes required by free-living cell.
The second group (Fig 3, panel C) represents genes shared
mainly among Vibrionaceae and other gamma proteobacteria (as Altermonadales, Burkholderiales and Enterobactidiales).
Finally, the third group (Fig. 3, panel D) is composed by
genes that are mainly specific to the Vibrionaceae.
k-mean cluster analysis and cluster enrichment
We performed a k-means cluster analysis, setting the k
value to 14. As shown in Fig. 4, the clusters 3, 4, 11, 13
and 14 contain the higher percentage of genes, accounting
for more that 50% of the total genes, while clusters 9 and
10 contain the lower number of ORFs (3% of genes). The

variance in each k-means cluster is very low (Fig. 4),
meaning that the clusters contain genes with compact and
similar profiles. As described in Fig. 4, the majority of the
clusters (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13) contains genes with
a similar profile, with the average values (red line) near
zero, except for the presence of some spikes correspondent to an increasing similarity with some isolated organisms. As shown in Table 3, clusters 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9
contains genes that have a high similarity in a small subset
of organisms. The majority of these ORFs are annotated as
hypothetical proteins or phage related proteins. Clusters
8, 10 and 14 present genes shared among almost all the
organisms. In particular cluster 10 is composed by the
core genes described before having an high value of similarity widespread among all the organisms; cluster 8 contains genes shared mainly by gamma proteobacteria and
cluster 14 is composed of genes in common between
Vibrionaceae and Enterobacteriaceae.
A functional annotation has been performed on each gene
cluster using COG (Cluster of Orthologous Genes), KEGG
pathway map and GO databases. For each k-mean cluster
the enrichment probability with respect to the total
number of clusters has been obtained with the hypergeometric distribution.
Fig. 5 shows COG enrichment results for each cluster. As
expected clusters represented by conserved genes (cluster
8, 10 and 14) have the higher number of enriched COG
codes, while cluster specific of few organisms are charac-

abundance of unknown and hypothetical proteins

that are present in the SS9 genome [11]. The role played
by these transposable elements in the survival of this
deep-sea bacterium it is still a matter of debate [12].
In addition V. vulnificus YJ016 and V. vulnificus CMCP6
(cluster 13) seem to share genes belonging to the enriched
COG classes K (Transcription), L and T (Signal transduction mechanisms). It was previously reported an enrichment in genes belonging to the transcription class in the
genome of V. vulnificus respect to the V. cholerae genome
[13]. This class is clearly related to the T class and seems to

indicate that this organism is able to receive and translate
in a transcriptional response specific environmental signals. Despite this, the large majority of the genes in clusters 3 and 13 lacks COG annotation.
Cluster 7, as shown in Table 3, accounts organisms with
large genome size (see Table 1). This can explain the fact
the this cluster contains almost all the COG class enriched
and suggests a more complex and flexible life-style of
these organisms compared to the other Vibrionaceae members.

KEGG annotation is limited to metabolic or structural
complex network and so a reduced number of genes have
a KEGG entry. This causes the presence of clusters without
enriched map (cluster 2–5, 7, 13, see Fig 5). Also in this
case, the clusters presenting the higher number of significant KEGG map are those containing the conserved genes.
The most enriched KEGG clusters are cluster 14, 10 and 8
accounting for the majority of the metabolic pathways.
Cluster 1 is enriched for map3080 (type IV secretion system). In fact V. fischeri genome contains 10 separate pilus
gene clusters, including eight type-IV pilus loci. The pres-

ence of multiple pilus gene clusters suggests that different
pili may be expressed in different environments or during
multiple stages of its development as a symbiont [14].
Cluster 11 is enriched for map3090 (type II secretion system). The type II pathway is conserved among gram-negative bacteria, including many pathogens, and secretes a
variety of virulence factors and degradative enzymes [15].
Cluster 9 is enriched for map 00860 (Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism). These genes are involved in the

cobalamin (coenzyme B12) biosynthetic pathway [16].
Some organisms, such as Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae, can synthesize cobalamin de novo [17],
while E. coli and large part of the Vibrionaceae perform
cobalamin biosynthesis only when provided with cobinamide. It is interesting to observe that the genes belonging
to the de novo pathway are only shared by Archea, some

other organisms like Salmonella, Pseudomonas and Vibrio
MED222.
Finally cluster 6 is enriched by map2010 (ABC transporter), map2020 (two-component system), map2030
and map2031 (bacterial chemotaxis), map2040 (Flagellar
assembly) and map3090 (type II secretion system). This
cluster contains genes shared with a high similarity by all

Vibrio and with a lower similarity with Photobacterium profundum species. Among the Vibrio species the organisms
showing the highest similarity (Tab. 3) are V. cholerae
strains.
Vibrionaceae specific genes
We identify 1940 clusters specific to the Vibrionaceae. All
the Vibrionaceae considered in the analysis share 108 clusters. Among these genes we identify ToxR and ToxS genes.
ToxR gene encodes a transmembrane regulatory protein
firstly identified in V. cholerae, in which it co-ordinates
many virulence factors in response to several environmental parameters [18]. V. cholerae ToxR activity is enhanced
by a second transmembrane protein, ToxS, encoded
downstream toxR [19]. This family of proteins is involved
in response to temperature, pH, osmolarity and in Photobacterium profundum SS9, a piezophilic bacterium, to
hydrostatic pressure [20]. The widespread presence of
these genes among the Vibrionaceae suggests their importance in regulatory mechanisms.

We identify two other noteworthy groups of genes composed by 257 and 160 genes respectively shared just by
two strains, mainly annotated as "hypothetical protein".
The first group of genes is shared between Photobacterium
profundum SS9 and Photobacterium profundum 3TCK, while
the second is shared between V. vulnificus CMCP6 and
YJ016. These strains are closely related and this explains
the high number of shared genes; while, inside the Vibrionaceae family, the number of specific shared genes highly
decreases, showing a high inter-species variability (Fig. 6)
Prophages and transposases
Prophages recover different biological roles both as quantitatively important genetic elements of the bacterial chromosome, and as vectors of lateral gene transfer among
bacteria, due to their characters of mobile DNA elements.
Indeed, numerous virulence factors from bacterial pathogens are phage encoded. It was postulated that this role of
prophages is not limited to pathogenic bacteria but some
adaptations of nonpathogenic strains to their ecological
niche might also be mediated by prophages acquisition
[21].

To better understand the importance of mobile elements
within Vibrionaceae family, we performed a hierarchical
cluster analysis using gene profiles annotated as "phage
protein" and "transposase", for a total of 172 clusters of
genes (Fig 7). We found that a high inter-strain genetic
variability exists and phages and transposases are both
shared by almost all Vibrionaceae, and specific to just some
organisms. We identified five major clusters of mobile elements that are specific to a single organism. A group composed by 26 clusters containing both transposase and
phage proteins seem to be unique to V. splendiduds 12B01

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S1/S23

(Fig 7). Another one composed by 16 clusters is specific of
V. vulnificus CMCP6 (Fig 7) while V. parahaemoliticus has
a cluster of 11 genes (Fig 7). Moreover there is another
group of transposases and phage genes shared mainly by
V. cholerae 0395, Shewanella oneidensis and V. cholerae V51
(Fig 7). Finally a big cluster of almost 30 genes, all predicted to codify for transposases, was found in P. profundum SS9 genome (Fig. 7). The high presence of
transposases in this bacterium seems to correlate with its
deep-sea habitat, a feature presumably shared with other
deep-sea microorganisms [12]. As shown in Fig 7, many of
the clusters well conserved in an organism, are partially
shared with a low similarity by other organisms. This
agrees with the idea that prophages are not maintained in
the genome over a long period of time and part of their
genes may be deleted from the chromosome. Moreover,
microarray analysis and PCR scanning demonstrated that
prophages are frequently strain specific within a given
bacterial species [22-24]. According to the modular theory
of phage evolution, phage genomes are mosaics of modules, groups of genes functionally related, that are free to
recombine in genetic exchanges between distinct phages
infecting the same cell [21]. This can result in the occurrences of different part of phage distributed in far related
genomes. Phylogenetic profile of some transposases is
similar to the phage ones, suggesting a possible transfer
mechanism phage-mediated for such mobile elements.

Conclusion
In this work we propose an improved phylogenetic profile
analysis on 14 Vibrionaceae genomes, to study this family
on the basis of gene content. Using a phylogenetic profile
for each cluster of genes defined as the median of all the
profiles belonging to the cluster (meta-profile) we investigate the evolution of groups of ORFs belonging to the
entire family. A two-way cluster analysis allows us to identify similarity structures on the entire phylogenetic matrix
composed by 8,239 clusters of genes and 320 organisms.
The phylogenetic tree obtained with the cluster analysis
does not reflect the global evolutionary tree because of the
Vibrionaceae ORFs dataset used for the analysis, but rather
can be considered as the Vibrionaceae perspective of bacterial diversity. The phylogenetic tree reflects the evolutionary processes that shape genomes, as lateral gene transfer,
genes genesis and loss. In this context, the tree allows to
group together genomes on the base of their global gene
content.
We found that genomes belonging to the same taxonomic
group tend to cluster together and that Vibrionaceae species are closely related. Moreover organisms belonging to
the same or closely related taxa split into different subgroups, confirming the existence of a high variability
among lineages, due to genetic and evolutionary process

such as lateral gene transfer, concerted evolution and
genes duplication.
On the other hand several groups of genes characterised
by different homogeneous profiles have been identified.
In particular we found, 1) a set of conserved genes (with a
high similarity values across all organisms) that reflects
the "minimal genome" composition defined in other previous works; 2) a set of genes mainly shared by Vibrionaceae and other Gamma proteobacteria and 3) genes
specific to different sets of Vibrionaceae.

Finally a further analysis on prophage and transposase has
confirmed the high inter-strain genetic variability even
among closely related species.
The increasing number of genomes included in this type
of analysis surely add new sorces of variability and noise,
anyway we think that the use of meta-profiles can be useful for complexity reduction and data analysis to study
global gene evolution.

Methods
Datasets
The Vibrionaceae species used in this analysis were selected
among the freely available complete and draft genome
sequences. The proteomes of V. cholerae N16961, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus YJ016, V. vulnificus CMCP6, V.
fischeri ES114, Photobacterium profundum SS9 were downloaded from the NCBI ftp site [25]. Protein sequences of
Vibrio cholerae MO10, Vibrio cholerae 0395, Vibrio cholerae
RC385, Vibrio cholerae V51, Vibrio cholerae V52 were
downloaded from the NCBI genome database, while
sequences of Vibrio MED222, Vibrio splendidus 12B01,
Photobacterium profundum 3TCK from the J. Craig Venter
Institute web site.

The 320 complete genomes update at 03/06 were downloaded from the NCBI ftp site.
Similarity search and phylogenetic profile construction
All the Vibrionaceae ORFs were merged generating a redundant list of 59,669 proteins and were compared to all
open reading frame from 320 bacterial and archeal
genomes using Blastp. To determine the presence of an
orthologous we used a combination of three different
thresholds; a similarity value equal to or higher than 30%,
an alignment length equal or higher than 70% and an
Evalue score lower than or equal to e-6. After determining
the presence of an orthologous gene, we computed a similarity index I for each pair of orthologous (a point of the
phylogenetic profile) as follow:

I=

Sqs min(lq , ls )
⋅
Sqq max(lq , ls )

where lq and ls are the query and subject length sequence
respectively and Sqs is the similarity score between the
query and the subject sequence. Sqs is defined as follow:
M

Sqs = ∑ α Aqi , Asi + GP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S1/S23

ferent sequence lengths, we multiplied the score S by the
ratio between the minimum length between query and
subject and the maximum length between query and subjects. In this way the total score is weighted on the base of
the length, resulting in a lower similarity value if the
lengths of the sequences are different.
The phylogenetic profile for each ORF is an array of index
I with length equal to the number of genomes considered
(320).
ORFs clustering
The redundant list of 59,669 Vibrionaceae ORFs contained
multiple copies of the same genes due to the presence of
conserved genes in the considered genomes. In order to
reduce the redundancy, we clustered proteins using a twostep approach. The first step is based on COG (Cluster of
Othologous Genes) annotation. COG classifies conserved
genes according to their homologous relationships. All
the Vibrionaceae ORFs were annotated using COG clusters
and proteins sharing the same COG code were considered
belonging to the same cluster. In particular, the annotation process consists of a similarity search of all the ORFs
against the COG proteins using blast and considering the
best hit for each protein. 43,024 ORFs presented a similarity with a COG entry, producing 2,463 different clusters.
In the second step, the remaining 16,645 ORFs without
similarity with any COG entry were clustered using CDHIT software [26]. CD-HIT program clusters protein
sequence database at high sequence identity threshold
and efficiently removes high sequence redundancy. This
last clustering process produced 9,613 different groups of
similar proteins.

Finally from the 12,076 total clusters obtained by this
methodology, those composed by ORFs that do not have
any ortologous genes (with a phylogenetic profile composed by an array with all zero values except for one position match with itself) were eliminated, resulting in a
dataset composed by 8,239 distinct clusters.

i =1

where M is the match length between the query and subject sequence; Aqi and Asi respectively the query and subject amino acid in position i; α the BLOSUM substitution
matrix value for amino acid pair Aqi, Asi and GP the gap
penalty. GP is defined as follow:

The final phylogenetic profile for each cluster (meta-profile) was defined as the median of all the profiles belonging to the cluster. At the end of these procedures the final
phylogenetic matrix was composed by 8,239 rows (cluster
of genes) and 320 columns (organisms). In each cell the
median of the index in the cluster was reported.

GP = GOP+GEP(k-1)
where GOP is the Gap Open Penalty set to -11, GEP the
Gap Extension Penalty set to -1 and k the gap length. Sqq
represents the score of the self-aligned query sequence.
Sqs is always smaller than Sqq and the score S range
between 0 and 1. In order to take into account also the dif-

Cluster analysis
Several clustering techniques have been used to identify
the similarity structure underneath our data. A k-means
and a two-way hierarchical cluster analysis with Euclidean
distance and complete linkage were performed on the
phylogenetic matrix.

The goal of a cluster analysis is to partition the elements
into subsets without any constrains or a priori information, so that two criteria are satisfied: homogeneity, elements inside a cluster are highly similar to each other; and
separation, elements from different clusters have low similarity to each other.

The Figure of Merit (FOM) is a measure of fit of the expression patterns for the clusters produced by a particular
algorithm that estimates the predictive power of a clustering algorithm. It is computed by removing each sample in
turn from the data set, clustering genes based on the
remaining data, and calculating the fit of the withheld
sample to the clustering pattern obtained from the other
samples. On our data FOM analysis identified the best
number of k-means clusters between 10 and 15. We
decided to set k (in the k-means analysis) equal to 14. In
each of these 14 clusters subsequent hierarchical cluster
analysis was performed with bootstrap cluster assessment.
All the previous analyses were performed with TMEV software [27], freely available at [28].

Enrichment categories
Each cluster of genes has been annotated according to
COG code, GO terms and KEGG pathway maps. Class
enrichment (with respect to the entire matrix) has been
calculated according to the hypergeometric distribution
that was used to obtain the chance probability of observing the number of genes annotated with a particular COG,
GO and KEGG category among the selected cluster. The
probability P of observing at least k genes of a functional
category within a group of n genes is given by:
