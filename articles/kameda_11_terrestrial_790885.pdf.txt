Terrestrial invasion of pomatiopsid gastropods in
the heavy-snow region of the Japanese
Archipelago
Yuichi Kameda* and Makoto Kato

Abstract
Background: Gastropod mollusks are one of the most successful animals that have diversified in the fully terrestrial
habitat. They have evolved terrestrial taxa in more than nine lineages, most of which originated during the
Paleozoic or Mesozoic. The rissooidean gastropod family Pomatiopsidae is one of the few groups that have
evolved fully terrestrial taxa during the late Cenozoic. The pomatiopsine diversity is particularly high in the
Japanese Archipelago and the terrestrial taxa occur only in this region. In this study, we conducted thorough
samplings of Japanese pomatiopsid species and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses to explore the
patterns of diversification and terrestrial invasion.
Results: Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that Japanese Pomatiopsinae derived from multiple colonization
of the Eurasian Continent and that subsequent habitat shifts from aquatic to terrestrial life occurred at least twice
within two Japanese endemic lineages. Each lineage comprises amphibious and terrestrial species, both of which
are confined to the mountains in heavy-snow regions facing the Japan Sea. The estimated divergence time
suggested that diversification of these terrestrial lineages started in the Late Miocene, when active orogenesis of
the Japanese landmass and establishment of snowy conditions began.
Conclusions: The terrestrial invasion of Japanese Pomatiopsinae occurred at least twice beside the mountain
streamlets of heavy-snow regions, which is considered the first case of this event in the area. Because snow
coverage maintains stable temperatures and high humidity on the ground surface, heavy-snow conditions may
have paved the way for these organisms from freshwater to land via mountain streamlets by preventing winter
desiccation in mountain valleys. The fact that the terrestrialization of Pomatiopsidae occurred only in year-round
wet environments, but not in seasonally dried regions, provides new insight into ancient molluscan
terrestrialization.

Background
Terrestrial invasion is one of the most important events
in the history of life [1,2]. Terrestrial lineages evolved in
seven animal phyla, among which vertebrates, arthropods, and mollusks are representatives of more successful groups of the epifaunal terrestrial life [3]. Most
terrestrial lineages are considered to have originated
under mild or tropical climate during the Paleozoic and
Mesozoic, whereas few animals became fully terrestrial
during the Cenozoic [3,4]. In regard to this point, mollusks are especially unique due to several fully terrestrial

and epifaunal lineages that evolved during the Cenozoic
[5,6].
Terrestrial invasion of gastropod mollusks has
occurred in Neritopsina, Cyclophoroidea, Littorinoidea,
Rissooidea, Ellobioidea, Onchidioidea, Rathouisioidea,
Succineoidea, and Stylommatophora [7,8], and in particular, each of Neritopsina, Rissooidea and Ellobioidea
has likely achieved land invasion more than once [6,8,9].
Most terrestrialization events have occurred during the
Paleozoic or Mesozoic [2,8-10], and only some members
of rissooidean families Truncatellidae, Assimineidae, and
Pomatiopsidae are considered to have colonized to land
during the Cenozoic [5,6,11,12]. Most truncatellid and
assimineid snails amphibiously live in intertidal and

supratidal zones from brackish water to pelagic areas.
Terrestrial lineages likely evolved from such ancestors
[4,6]. In contrast, most pomatiopsid snails live in freshwater habitats [11,13]. Therefore, the process of terrestrial invasion in Pomatiopsidae might differ from those
of former families.
Pomatiopsidae, which are well known as intermediate
hosts of Asian schistosomes [14-18], comprises two subfamilies, Triculinae and Pomatiopsinae. The former
radiated as aquatic snails in freshwater habitats in
Southeast Asia [11,19], whereas the latter are distributed
worldwide (Figure 1) and possesses various lifestyles
from aquatic to amphibious, littoral, halophilic, and
even terrestrial [11,20]. The generic diversity of Pomatiopsinae is particularly high in the Japanese Archipelago, where four of the eight genera including two
endemics, are recorded (Figures 1 &2) [11]. The diversity of Japanese Pomatiopsinae is based on two characteristics, i.e. unique habitats of the endemic genera, and
their distribution.
One of the two Japanese endemic genera, Fukuia, live
amphibiously around rocky walls of steep valleys covered
with ferns and bryophytes, and moistened by dripping
water [21,22]. They inhabit only along the mountain
streamlets, where such habitats are typically found, and
often occur with pleurocerid freshwater snails [21]. In contrast, the other endemic genus Blanfordia is the sole terrestrial group within Pomatiopsidae (Figure 1) [11]. They are

found on forest floor and tree trunks in coastal to mountainous areas (Table 1) [11,22], together with fully terrestrial
gastropod snails such as diplommatinids, camaenids and
bradybaenids. The distribution of the two genera are largely confined to the heavy-snow region facing the Japan
Sea (Figures 3A-C) [22]. Generally, East Asia is dominated
by a monsoon climate, characterized by alternating hot
rainy summers and cold dry winters [23]. The snow-rich
area is unique in that winter monsoons blowing southward
from the Japan Sea and high mountain ranges shaping the
Japanese Archipelago bring enormous snowfalls in winter
[24,25]. Such a varied climate harbors various unique flora
and fauna [26,27], and can be closely related to the diversification of Pomatiopsinae in the archipelago.
In this study, we provide the first molecular phylogeny
encompassing all pomatiopsid taxa occurring on the
Japanese Archipelago. We also analyzed the relationship
with continental taxa. In addition, we estimated the timing of diversification and terrestrial invasion, which can
be interpreted using the geological history of Japan.
Based on these results, we discuss the reason why the
terrestrial invasion of Pomatiopsidae occurred only in
the Japanese Archipelago.

the combined data resulted in a single most parsimonious tree (3375 steps, consistency index excluding
uninformative characters [CI] = 0.3861, retention index
[RI] = 0.6567). The results of maximum likelihood (ML)
and Bayesian analyses were largely consistent with the
relatively well supported clades. Only posterior

probabilities of P ≥ 0.95 and bootstrap support values of
P ≥ 75 were considered statistically significant. Hence,
support values below this significance level are not
discussed.
The phylogenetic analyses recovered Pomatiopsidae as
a monophyletic clade (Figure 4). Triculinae was also
confirmed as monophyletic. On the other hand, relationships among most of the pomatiopsine genera are
not well resolved, although the pomatiopsine genus

Type locality
Taxon names, habitats, localities, and accession numbers are provided. Sequences obtained for this study are marked with an asterisk.

Oncomelania was sister to Triculinae. Following analysis
using an approximately unbiased(AU) test [28], the
monophyly of all pomatiopsine taxa was rejected (P =
0.049), suggesting that Pomatiopsinae is paraphyletic to
Triculinae.
Japanese pomatiopsine taxa were grouped into four
lineages. Oncomelania and Cecina were both recovered
as monophyletic, but two endemic genera, Fukuia and
Blanfordia formed two clades, each of which included
species from both genera (clades I and II; Figure 4).
Clade I consisted of F. ooyagii and Blanfordia spp.
except for B. integra, where F. ooyagii was sister to the
Blanfordia species. Clade II was composed of B. integra,
F. kurodai, and F. multistriata. These results indicate
independent evolution of terrestriality in the two clades.
Therefore, we tested the alternative hypothesis of the
occurrence of terrestrial species. The monophyly of all
Blanfordia species was rejected by approximately
unbiased (AU) test (P = 0.000001), suggesting that land
invasion occurred independently at least twice. In clade
II, B. integra was placed between F. multistriata and F.
kurodai. However, the detailed branching pattern and
number of terrestrial invasions were uncertain within
this clade because the monophyly of B. integra was not
rejected (AU test, P = 0.07).
Estimation of divergence time

To determine the timing of the origin of terrestriality in
Pomatiopsidae, we estimated the divergence time based

on the combined phylogeny of four genes. Fossil records
and previous estimations were used to estimate the
divergence time of pomatiopsid taxa. For the fossil
records, Assiminea spp. from the Lower Miocene (23.016.0 Ma) [29,30] were used for the initial divergence of
Assimineidae. The root node of “Truncatelloidea”
(Truncatellidae + Pomatiopsidae + Assimineidae; sensu
Ponder [31]) was modeled by a Gamma prior (shape = 1
and scale = 1.5) with values younger than 61.7 Ma
assigned zero probability, which is justified by Truncatella minor, the oldest known fossil for this group documented from the Lower Paleocene (65.5-61.7 Ma) of
Belgium [32]. Based on these constraints, a basal split
within Triculinae was inferred at 16.8 Ma with a 95%
confidence interval of 21.3-12.2 Ma (Figure 5A). The
emergence of Japanese aquatic species O. minima and F.
ooyagii were estimated at 16.0 (21.2-10.6) Ma and 17.4
(23.7-11.1) Ma, respectively. The terrestrial lineage in
clade I began to diverge at 6.4 (9.2-3.7) Ma. The diversification of clade II began at 7.2 (10.3-4.4) Ma and the
terrestrial species B. integra occurred during the
Pliocene.
We also estimated the divergence time by using the
split between Oncomelania hupensis quadrasi and O. h.
robertsoni, which was previously estimated at 3 Ma
based on allozyme differences [33]. Node ages calculated
from this estimation were two to three times younger
than former results. Thus, data from the two calibrations were not compatible at higher nodes (data not

results because the node ages in the latter estimation
were too young to explain the existence of fossils at earlier periods.
Climatic factors contributing to distribution of endemic
genera

The two Japanese endemic lineages, clades I and II, are
largely confined to the Japan Sea side of the Japanese

Archipelago (Figure 3). To determine whether this pattern is associated with any climate factors, we performed
logistic regression analysis based on four variables, i.e.,
annual highest and lowest temperatures, and total precipitations in summer and winter. The logistic regression
analysis showed significant correlation between winter
precipitation and the occurrence of the snails, whereas
contributions of the other variables were not significant
(Table 2). Although we did not include the amount of
snowfall due to the significant correlation with winter

precipitation (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, p
= 0.0054), its difference was also significant between
inside and outside of the distributions (Wilcoxon’s
signed-rank test, z = -3.009, p = 0.0026).

Discussion
Phylogenetic and taxonomic implications

The phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of
Triculinae. On the other hand, Pomatiopsinae was paraphyletic to the former subfamily, and an Asian genus
Oncomelania became sister to Triculinae (Figure 4).
These results suggest that taxonomy and phylogeographic scenarios should be reconsidered. Traditionally,
Pomatiopsidae is considered to have diverged into two
subfamilies in Gondwanaland during the Mesozoic,
mainly because three pomatiopsine genera shows Gondwanan distribution (Coxiella, Idiopyrgus and Tomichia;
Figure 1) [11]. However, the close relationship between
Triculinae and Oncomelania and the estimated divergence time suggest that Triculinae have evolved more
recently on the Eurasian Continent, not in Gondwanaland. Although we could not provide alternative scenarios from current phylogenetic results, further study,
including remaining pomatiopsine genera, is needed to
reconsider subfamilial taxonomy and worldwide phylogeography of this family.
Incongruence between current taxonomy and molecular phylogeny was also observed on Japanese endemic
genera Fukuia and Blanfordia. The terrestrial species B.
integra was grouped with the amphibious species F. kurodai and F. multistriata, whereas aquatic species F.
ooyagii was separated from the other Fukuia species
(Figure 4). Our results indicated the inadequacy of the
current taxonomy of the two genera, which have been
primarily based on their habitat [34]. In contrast, internal morphologies likely reflect the phylogenetic relationship. Davis [11] noted that genital structures of B.
integra are similar to those of Fukuia. Although he
doubted if Fukuia and Blanfordia are morphologically
distinct based on such evidence, it is an apparent confusion resulting from the inadequate generic assignment
of B. integra, for genital and nervous structures clearly
differ between species in clade I and II [11,21]. Snails in
clade II also commonly climb up grasses and shrubs
during summer (Figure 2K) [11, 35, Y. Kameda, pers.
obs.]. This behavior characterizes clade II, since treeclimbing behavior is known only in these snails and a
few arboreal species of the assimineid genus Omphalotropis throughout the superfamily [36]. Hence, B. integra
is undoubtedly a member of the genus Fukuia. At the
same time, F. ooyagii should be separated from Fukuia,
and its generic assignment should be determined
coupled with the investigation of its soft-part
morphology.

Divergence time and patterns of Japanese Pomatiopsinae

The number of inhabiting pomatiopsine genera is particularly high in the Japanese Archipelago (Figure 1).
Davis [11] considered that the diversity of Japanese
Pomatiopsinae results from the single colonization and
following radiation of ancestral Oncomelania in the
archipelago, and that such rapid evolution presumably
associated with extensive tectonic activity in the Tertiary. However, our phylogenetic analysis grouped Japanese pomatiopsine snails into four lineages,
Oncomelania, Cecina, and clades I and II (Figure 4).
These results contradict the scenario of Davis [11], suggesting that current diversity is partially derived from
the multiple colonization of pomatiopsine ancestors into
the Japanese Archipelago. Subsequent habitat shifts may
have contributed to increasing diversity and produced
the terrestrial lineages.
The widespread genus Oncomelania comprises two
Japanese taxa, O. minima and O. h. nosophora (Figures
2Q &2R). These two taxa are not closely related, suggesting that colonization to the Japanese Archipelago
occurred twice in this genus. The age of divergence
between O. minima and O. hupensis was estimated
around 16.0 Ma in the Middle Miocene (Figure 5A),
suggesting that this divergence was likely invoked by the
expansion of the Japan Sea, which is thought to have
occurred during this period [37,38]. O. h. nosophora
diverged from other continental subspecies more
recently and likely colonized into Japan during glacial
periods in the Late Pleistocene [39].
The littoral genus Cecina also occurs in the Japanese
Archipelago. This genus consists of a single widespread
species, Cecina manchurica, living among the decaying
seaweed stranded on the seashore (Figures 2G &2S)
[11]. Although we could not elucidate the divergence
time of this genus due to low support values, the wide
distribution was formed by recent dispersions via ocean
currents based on very low genetic diversity between
geographically distant populations (Figures 3D &4).
The divergence between two Japanese endemic
lineages, clades I and II, was estimated to be around
21.7 Ma in the Early Miocene (Figure 5A). This period
corresponds to incipient opening of the Japan Sea, and
the northern and southern parts of the Japanese Archipelago that were separated from each other [37,38,40].
This geological event might have also split the two
clades (Figure 5B). The northern part of the Japanese
Archipelago was further fragmented at later periods
until the orogenesis of the northeastern Japanese Archipelago began in the later Late Miocene [37,41]. Speciation in clade I may be explained by geographic isolation
due to this geological event, and the narrow distribution
of each species may reflect the past geographic isolation
(Figures 3A &5C). Remarkably, B. simplex is widely

distributed along the Japan Sea and occurs on coastal
dunes as well as littoral forests, whereas the other species inhabit rather inland forests [22,42]. The low
genetic differentiation and habitat of B. simplex suggest
that a geological barrier has been absent for the coastal
species.
The southern part of the Japanese Archipelago, where
clade II was thought to have inhabited (Figure 5B),
remained as a relatively large landmass. The land area
had expanded northward in the Late Miocene along
with the beginning of orogenesis in the northeastern
part of the archipelago [37,38]. The diversification of
clade II likely started in the Late Miocene (around 7.2
Ma; Figure 5A), indicating that tectonic activities might
have enabled the range expansion of clade II to northeastern Honshu (Figure 5C).
Routes of terrestrial invasion

The terrestrial pomatiopsid species are found in clades I
and II (Figure 4). The snails in both clades are largely
restricted to mountains in the Japan Sea side of the
Japanese Archipelago (Table 1; Figures 3A-C), where
winter precipitations are especially high among the distributions of pomatiopsine genera (Figure 6). Because
winter precipitation falls as snow in this region, terrestrial invasion may have occurred via mountain streamlets that are covered with heavy snowfall in winter. This
evolutionary hypothesis contrasts with the current
knowledge of terrestrial invasion in two points. First,
evolution of terrestriality most likely occurred via mountain streamlets. Generally, that animals would evolve
terrestriality near rivers and streams than in lakes and
swamps seems less likely due to adaptations for air
breathing, particularly in the latter environment with its
frequent reductions in dissolved oxygen [3]. Second, terrestrial invasion likely occurred in a cool-temperate
region. Colonization to land is considered to have
occurred primarily in the tropics during mild climate
periods [3,4]. To our knowledge, this is the first case in
which terrestriality might have evolved in a cool region.
Therefore, the questions on how terrestriality was
acquired beside the streamlets and which climatic factors enabled this evolution under such cold climates
remain to be elucidated.

The aquatic and amphibious species of clades I and II,
which likely represent ancestral habitats of terrestrial
taxa, inhabit mountain streamlets and rocky walls that
are constantly moistened by dripping water and covered
with ferns and bryophytes (Figure 2) [21,22]. When
these habitats become drier, both amphibious and aquatic species are able to resist the short-term drying by
crawling into crevices and wet litter [21]. Correlation
between desiccation tolerance and wetness of habitat is
observed in some animals [11,43,44]; thus, frequent
droughts may have promoted the ancestral freshwater
snails to the more amphibious lifestyle beside the mountain streamlets. Amphibious snails in some populations
can actively move onto terrestrial substrata and mate
outside the water (Figure 2I). Therefore, the colonization
to terrestrial habitats was presumably achieved by
becoming more tolerant to desiccation. The availability
of dissolved oxygen might not have influenced the habitat shifts of these snails because their ancestors may
have preadapted to amphibious habitats [11,12].
The snails in clades I and II mainly occur on the
Japan Sea side of the Japanese Archipelago (Figure 3),
whose climate is unique in East Asia. This area is generally dominated by a monsoon climate, characterized by
alternating hot rainy summers and cold dry winters
[23]. However, the Japan Sea side of the archipelago has
exceptionally high winter precipitation due to the winter
monsoon blowing southward from the Japan Sea and
the high mountain ranges that bring enormous snowfall
[24,25,45]. This region harbors various unique flora and
fauna that are known as “Japan Sea elements” [26,27],
whose distributions clearly correspond to the amount of

Kameda and Kato BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:118
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/118

snowfall [46-48]. These organisms are not always resistant to the stress of winter coldness and desiccation,
and often need snow coverage under which stable temperatures around 0°C and high humidity are maintained
[49-54]. Snails of clades I and II are also considered as
Japan Sea elements [22,35]. The logistic regression analysis showed significant correlation between winter precipitation and occurrence of the snails (Table 2),
suggesting a high degree of need for high winter precipitation, which brings snow coverage, to ensure their
survival.
Heavy-snow environments in the Japanese Archipelago
were established by the formation of Japan Sea and high
mountain ranges in the archipelago [55,56]. The orogenesis of the northern Honshu occurred since the late
Miocene [37,38,41], whose period corresponds to the
diversification and terrestrial invasion of Japanese endemic clades (Figure 5A). According to the vegetation in
the late Miocene to Pliocene, northern Honshu was
cool-temperate and later became colder [57,58]. The
amount of snowfall increased with the growth of high
mountain ranges during the Pleistocene [56]. Although
the amount of snowfall during these periods is uncertain, arid or semi-arid climates did not appear in this
region [24,56], suggesting the presence of constantly
moist environments that were suitable for the survival
of snails in clades I and II. Therefore, the establishment
of snowy regions may have paved the way for these
organisms from freshwater to land via mountain streamlets by preventing winter desiccation in mountain
valleys.
The fact that terrestrial invasion in Pomatiopsidae did
not occur except in the snowy region provides an indication of molluscan terrestrialization. Many pomatiopsid
snails lived in the floodplains of continental Asia [11],
where the dry and wet seasonal cycle is dominant (Figure 6). However, such climate seems insufficient to lead
the seasonal amphibious snails to terrestrial habits. In
contrast, year-round wet environments were most likely
necessary for amphibious snails to become terrestrial,
contrary to the belief that seasonal drought accelerates
terrestrial invasion [3]. The terrestrial lineages, especially
in clade II, have specific behaviors when crawling up
vegetation [11,35]. Ancestral amphibious lineages in
water films found on wet rocky walls would have
enabled the preadaptation of this type of behavior
accompanied by a broad, strong foot.

Conclusions
The generic and ecological diversity of Pomatiopsinae is
particularly high in the Japanese Archipelago, with its terrestrial taxa occurring only in this region. Our phylogenetic analyses suggested that the Japanese Pomatiopsinae
derived from the multiple colonization from the Eurasian

Page 11 of 14

Continent and subsequent habitat shift to the terrestrial
life occurred at least twice within the Japanese endemic
lineages (clades I and II; Figure 4). The evolution of terrestriality possibly occurred beside mountain streamlets
of snowy regions, where snow coverage shelters the
ground surface from winter desiccation and coldness
[51,54]. The estimated divergence time also suggested
that diversification of the endemic clades began in the
Late Miocene, which is the period corresponding to the
orogenesis of the Japanese Archipelago and expansion of
the Japan Sea (Figure 5). The emergence of the heavysnow region is associated with these tectonic activities
[56]; therefore, the terrestrial invasion of pomatiopsid
snails may have been promoted by the formation of the
archipelago and the establishment of snowy conditions
that led the way from freshwater to land via mountain
streamlets. The fact that terrestrial invasions of Pomatiopsidae occurred only in year-round wet and cool
environments, but not in seasonally dried regions, gives
new insight into molluscan terrestrialization.

Methods
Sampling

To investigate the evolutionary history of Japanese
pomatiopsids, we collected 13 taxa from 23 localities to
represent all Japanese pomatiopsids. The sequence data
of non-Japanese pomatiopsids were obtained from GenBank, but species that lack two or more examined gene
regions were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis.
As a result, 13 triculine species and 3 non-Japanese
pomatiopsine taxa were included in the analysis,
although they do not encompass representatives of all
pomatiopsine genera. However, it would not matter in
discussing the evolution within Japanese taxa because
excluded pomatiopsine genera are unlikely related to
our focusing taxa based on genital structures [11]. For
outgroups, we used four assimineids, one truncatellid,
one amnicolid, and two littorinids. Detailed information
on examined samples is shown in Table 1.
Molecular methods

Total DNA was isolated following a previously described
method [59]. We sequenced the partial region of the
nuclear 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1), and 16S rDNA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions and primers
used are shown in Additional File 1. PCR products were
purified using Exo-SAP-IT (Amersham Biosciences, Little
Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). Sequencing was performed using a BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
and electrophoresed on an ABI 3130 sequencer (Applied
Biosystems). The obtained sequences were deposited in
the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (Table 1).

Phylogenetic analyses

The alignment of the CO1 gene required no gaps; 16S,
18S, and 28S sequences were aligned using MUSCLE
v3.8 [60]. To eliminate the uncertainty of the alignments
in these gene regions, GBLOCKS v0.91b [61] was used
to select those regions of the aligned sequences that are
confidently aligned for analysis (Additional File 2). Phylogenetic trees were obtained by maximum parsimony
(MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian methods.
MP analysis was performed using PAUP* 4.0b10 [62]
and heuristic searches were conducted with 10 random
addition analyses using equal character weights and
tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping.
Prior to ML and Bayesian analyses, we used the program Kakusan3 v3.5.2009.11.03 [63] to select appropriate models of sequence evolution (Additional File 2).
Based on the selected models, ML analysis was performed with 1000 iterations of the likelihood ratchet
[64,65] using TreeFinder [66] and Phylogears version
1.5.2009.12.29 [67]. Nodal support for the MP and ML
analyses was assessed using bootstrap analyses with
1000 replications. Bayesian analysis was performed using
MrBayes v3.1.2 [68,69]. The analysis was carried out by
two simultaneous runs, each of which consisted of running four simultaneous chains for 10 million generations
and sampling trees every 1000 generations. We discarded the first 1001 trees as burn-in and the remaining
18000 samples were used to estimate the tree topology,
branch length, and substitution parameters. The alignments and obtained trees were deposited in TreeBASE
http://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html under
accession number S11213.
Approximately unbiased (AU) test

Given that the phylogenetic analyses indicated that the
terrestrial genus Blanfordia and aquatic/amphibious
genus Fukuia formed mixed clades (see Results), we performed the AU tests [28] to test an alternative hypothesis for the evolution of terrestrial species. The
alternative trees were obtained by the likelihood ratchet
method as described above under the topological constraint that all Blanfordia species were monophyletic (i.
e., terrestrial invasion occurred once) and that B. integra
was monophyletic, indicating that terrestriality evolved
at least twice. In addition, the AU test was also performed to test the monophyly of Pomatiopsinae, because
it was not recovered as monophyletic and because support values among pomatiopsine genera were low. The
AU test was conducted based on 1 million replications
using TreeFinder.
Estimation of divergence time

Approximate divergence times were estimated using a
relaxed clock method [70] as implemented in BEAST

Page 12 of 14

1.5.3 [71]. Divergence times were calculated using
previous estimations and fossil records. We first used
the split between Oncomelania hupensis quadrasi and
O. h. robertsoni, which was previously estimated at 3
Ma based on allozyme differences [33]. For the fossil
records, three fossils were used to place priors on
node ages. A normally distributed estimate prior of
19.5 ± 3.5 Ma was used for the basal divergence of
Assimineidae, based on Assiminea from the Lower
Miocene (23.0-16.0 Ma) of Florida, USA [29] and the
Marshall Islands [30]. The basal splitting of “Truncatelloidea” (Truncatellidae + Assimineidae + Pomatiopsidae; sensu Ponder [31]) was modeled by a Gamma
prior (shape = 1 and scale = 1.5) with values younger
than 61.7 Ma assigned zero probability, which is justified by Truncatella minor, the oldest known fossil for
this group documented from the Lower Paleocene
(65.5-61.7 Ma) of Belgium [32]. Divergence times for
the remaining nodes in the phylogenetic tree were
estimated with BEAST software. The Yule process was
used to model the speciation process. The Monte
Carlo Markov chain was run eight times for 10 million generations sampled every 1000 generations to
ensure that the effective sample size (ESS) values were
above 200 for most of the parameters. The first 1001
trees of each run were discarded as burn-in and the
remaining trees were combined to produce an ultrametric consensus tree using LogCombiner and
TreeAnnotator v1.5.3 (included in the BEAST software package).
Climatic factors contributing to distribution of endemic
genera

The two Japanese endemic genera, Fukuia and Blanfordia, are largely confined to the Japan Sea side of
the Japanese Archipelago, i.e., heavy-snow regions
(Figure 3). The distributions of these genera seem to
be restricted by the amount of snowfall, but other climatic factors may have affected the survival of these
snails. Therefore we performed logistic regression analysis to investigate the association between climatic
factors and the occurrence of these snails. We used
annual highest and lowest temperatures, and total precipitations in summer (between June and August) and
winter (between December and February) as climatic
factors. The climatic data were obtained from the
Japan Meteorological Agency http://www.jma.go.jp.
Within the distribution of Fukuia and Blanfordia, 14
localities were selected to cover the entire range of
these genera (Additional file 3). For the localities outside the distributions, we selected 11 weather stations,
each of which is nearest to an inside-distribution
locality across the high mountain ranges and has similar altitude.
