Abstract
Background: There are thousands of very diverse ciliate species from which only a handful mitochondrial
genomes have been studied so far. These genomes are rather similar because the ciliates analysed
(Tetrahymena spp. and Paramecium aurelia) are closely related. Here we study the mitochondrial genomes
of the hypotrichous ciliates Euplotes minuta and Euplotes crassus. These ciliates are only distantly related to
Tetrahymena spp. and Paramecium aurelia, but more closely related to Nyctotherus ovalis, which possesses a
hydrogenosomal (mitochondrial) genome.
Results: The linear mitochondrial genomes of the hypotrichous ciliates Euplotes minuta and Euplotes
crassus were sequenced and compared with the mitochondrial genomes of several Tetrahymena species,
Paramecium aurelia and the partially sequenced mitochondrial genome of the anaerobic ciliate Nyctotherus
ovalis. This study reports new features such as long 5'gene extensions of several mitochondrial genes,
extremely long cox1 and cox2 open reading frames and a large repeat in the middle of the linear
mitochondrial genome. The repeat separates the open reading frames into two blocks, each having a single
direction of transcription, from the repeat towards the ends of the chromosome. Although the Euplotes
mitochondrial gene content is almost identical to that of Paramecium and Tetrahymena, the order of the
genes is completely different. In contrast, the 33273 bp (excluding the repeat region) piece of the
mitochondrial genome that has been sequenced in both Euplotes species exhibits no difference in gene
order. Unexpectedly, many of the mitochondrial genes of E. minuta encoding ribosomal proteins possess
N-terminal extensions that are similar to mitochondrial targeting signals.
Conclusion: The mitochondrial genomes of the hypotrichous ciliates Euplotes minuta and Euplotes crassus
are rather different from the previously studied genomes. Many genes are extended in size compared to
mitochondrial genes from other sources.

Background
Ciliates, unicellular eukaryotes, are extremely species-rich
and colonize a very broad spectrum of ecological niches.
They are characterized by complexes of cilia, used for
swimming and food capturing and by a nuclear dimorphism that is unique for ciliates. All members possess a
micronuclear genome, which is active in sexual reproduction, and a macronuclear genome that is transcriptionally
active during somatic development and maintenance. In
addition to the macronuclear and micronuclear genomes,
aerobic ciliates also possess a mitochondrial genome.
Although there are thousands of different ciliate species,
only six mitochondrial genomes have been completely
sequenced and analyzed thus far: P. aurelia [1] and five
Tetrahymena species: T. pyriformis, T. thermophila, T. pigmentosa, T. paravorax and T. malaccensis [2-4]. Only minor
differences between the mitochondrial genomes of the
Tetrahymena species were found. The mitochondrial
genomes of P. aurelia and Tetrahymena species are also
very similar; only two large blocks of genes are shifted
between them but within these blocks the gene order is
conserved. A third smaller block, containing the split
mitochondrial ribosomal rnl gene, is duplicated in Tetrahymena but not in Paramecium. Although most of the
sequenced mitochondrial genomes are circular mapping,
the mitochondrial genomes of Paramecium and Tetrahymena are monomeric linear and capped with telomeres.
No mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced in the
order of hypotrichous ciliates that contain intensively
studied species such as Oxytricha and Stylonichia as well as
Euplotes, a genus widely distributed in freshwater and seawater environments. The two Euplotes species studied here
(E. crassus and E. minuta) are both marine ciliates that
were collected in the Mediterranean sea.
We investigated the mitochondrial genome organization
of Euplotes for three reasons: firstly, because Euplotes is
only distantly related to P. aurelia and the various Tetrahymena species, the only species from which mitochondrial
genomes have been studied so far (Figure 1). Secondly,
because Euplotes contains two morphologically different
types of mitochondria, which might possess different
genomes [5,6] and thirdly, because we assumed that
Euplotes is more closely related to Nyctotherus ovalis than
Tetrahymena or Paramecium. Phylogenetic analysis, however, did not support this assumption because of lacking
statistical support (Figure 1). Nevertheless, it is likely that
its organellar genome is closely related to the hydrogenosomal genome of Nyctotherus ovalis, which exhibits characteristics of a ciliate mitochondrial genome and significant
sequence similarity to certain Euplotes genes. Nyctotherus
ovalis, which thrives in the hindgut of various cockroach
species, has been investigated extensively, but only 14 kb
of its hydrogenosomal genome have been sequenced so
far [7-10]. Here, we show that the mitochondrial genomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/514

of E. crassus and E. minuta are linear with a large repeat
region in the middle that is potentially involved in transcription initiation. The gene content of the Euplotes
genome is almost identical to that of Paramecium and Tetrahymena, but the order of the genes is completely different. We discuss the observation that Euplotes contains
extremely large cox genes and several other mitochondrial
genes with large extensions. It is shown that several N-terminal extensions of the mitochondrial genes have the
potential to function as mitochondrial import signals.

Results and Discussion
Structure of the mitochondrial genomes
The linear mitochondrial DNA of E. minuta has been completely sequenced with exclusion of the telomeres and a
repeat region of more then 1000 base pairs that is located
almost in the middle of the mitochondrial genome. The
length of the sequenced mitochondrial genome of E.
minuta clearly exceeds 41600 bp, while 33273 bp (excluding the repeat region) of the mitochondrial genome of E.
crassus have been sequenced (Figure 2). The length of the
telomeres can only be estimated roughly since it is known
from investigation of 5 different Tetrahymena species that
the composition and length of mitochondrial telomeres
can differ enormously [11,12]. Also, in three Tetrahymena
species the terminal repeats at both ends of the mitochondrial DNA are completely different. Moreover, analysis of
the mitochondrial genome of T. malaccensis has shown
that telomeric lengths can vary between 700 and 4200 bp
with an average size of 2600 bp. [12]. Since pulsed field
gel electrophoresis of E. minuta DNA has indicated that
the total length of the mitochondrial genome is clearly
less than 48 Kb (Figure 3), it is likely that we have
sequenced the total mitochondrial genome with exception of the telomeres. This interpretation is supported by
the observation that chromosome walking using
organelle DNA failed to provide evidence for the presence
of additional DNA at the ends of the sequenced mitochondrial genome.

The central repeat region is made up from 18-bp units that
are palindromic except for the positions 3-4/15-16. The
repeat units are identical in E. crassus and E. minuta (Figure 4).
Because the direction of transcription of all mitochondrion encoded genes is away from this repeat region (Figure 2), we tested whether the palindrome exhibits
significant sequence similarity to any known transcription
factor binding site using the online motif comparison tool
Tomtom [13]. As expected, no significant levels of
sequence similarity were found (E-values > 0.1). Notably,
it has been observed that unrelated A-T rich repeat units
serve as autonomously replicating sequences in the mitochondrial DNA of Paramecium and Tetrahymena; these

chondrial genomes of these unicellular cryptophyte algae
are not linear but circular mapping.
The overall A+T content of the mitochondrial genome of
E. minuta, (64.0%), is much lower than in T. pyriformis
(78.7%) but significantly higher than in P. aurelia
(59.0%) [1]. Genes are tightly packed and the intergenic
regions (4.1% of the genome) are generally short (ranging
from 1 to 385 nucleotides, with an average size of 66
nucleotides). These intergenic regions have an overall A+T
content of 68.9% which is hardly higher than in the coding areas. We found eight cases where the orfs overlap (996 bp.) and no gene duplication. One gene (nad 1) was
split into two parts that are located on different positions
of the genome.
The overall A+T content of the sequenced part of the mitochondrial genome of E. crassus is 65.3%. The genes in the
mitochondrial genome of E. crassus are also tightly packed
and intergenic spacers (4.2%) have a length of 2 to 413
nucleotides with an average size of 77 nucleotides and an
A+T content of 68.4%. Overlapping orfs were identified in
12 cases with overlaps varying in size from 3 to 100 base
pairs.

units are located at one end of the mitochondrial chromosome, close to the telomeric repeats [14-16]. Other examples of repeat regions in mitochondrial genomes of
protists are found in the cryptophyte algae Rhodomonas
salina [17] and Hemiselmis andersenii [18]. Both mitochondrial genomes contain a large complex repeat region that
seems to play a role in transcription. However, the mito-

in E. crassus and E. minuta.

The mitochondrial genes of Euplotes minuta and
Euplotes crassus
The mitochondrial DNA of E. minuta includes 12 protein
coding genes involved in the electron transport chain, 7
ribosomal protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes,
7 transfer RNA genes, and one gene that encodes a cytochrome c assembly protein (ccmF/jeyR) (Table 1). Finally,
15 orfs were found with no detectable sequence similarity
to known genes (Table 2). The sequenced part of the mitochondrial genome of E. crassus contains 10 genes of the
electron transport chain, 6 ribosomal protein coding
genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 5 transfer RNA genes, the
ccmF/jeyR gene and 11 orfs with significant sequence similarity to E. minuta genes, but no detectable sequence similarity to other known genes (Table 1, 2).

There are no differences in gene order between the closely
related E. crassus and E. minuta, but their gene order is
completely different than that of the Tetrahymena species
and P. aurelia (Figure 2). Only four genes could be found
that have a conserved order in all these ciliate species: rpl2orf-nad10-rps12.
Genes encoding components of the electron transport
chain
As shown in Table 1 all mitochondrion-encoded Complex
I genes that were found in T. pyriformis and P. aurelia [4],
were also found in E. minuta with the exception of nad6/

expected to be located in the not sequenced part of the
mitochondrial genome of Euplotes crassus

cies possess nad6/ymf62, which exhibits a significant
sequence similarity with orf265 in P. aurelia.
In all Tetrahymena species and in P. aurelia the Complex I
gene nad1 is split into a larger A and a smaller B part,
which is located on the opposite strand. In E. minuta this
gene is also split but located on the same strand. In E.
crassus the corresponding part of the mitochondrial
genome has not been sequenced (Figure 2).
The length of the nad2 gene of T. pyriformis, P. aurelia and
N. ovalis (var. Bla. Ams) is almost the same but about 180
amino acids smaller than the nad2 gene of Bos taurus
(cow). In contrast, the nad2 genes of both Euplotes species
have large N terminal extensions. The nad2 gene of E.
crassus has an extension of about 250 amino acids, and the

homologous gene of E. minuta is around 500 amino acids
longer. These extensions have no detectable sequence similarity to each other or to other known genes.
The Complex I gene nad4L has been identified by Brunk et
al. in T. thermophila [3] (named ymf 58 in the other mitochondrial genomes of Tetrahymena species), in the
hydrogenosomal genome of the anaerobic ciliate N. ovalis
and in both Euplotes species (Table 1). It has not been
annotated in Paramecium, but alignments of orf113 in P.
aurelia with the Tetrahymena species and with the nad4L
gene of N. ovalis shows that this orf113 is homologous to
nad4L [10]. The nad7 genes of both Euplotes species are
highly conserved; both have a small N-terminal extension
(19 and 36 amino acids, respectively). These extensions
are not similar to each other and are not found in other
ciliates.
The only Complex III gene that is found in the mitochondrial genomes of the Tetrahymena species and P. aurelia is
cytochrome-b (cob), which has also been identified in both
Euplotes species (Table 1; Figure 2). The cob genes of both
Euplotes species possess small N-terminal extensions that
are not conserved while the remaining part of the gene is
very well conserved. The Complex IV genes cytochrome oxidase 1 and 2 (cox1 and cox2), are found in all Tetrahymena
species, in P. aurelia and in both Euplotes species (Table 1;
Figure 2). As shown earlier in T. pyriformis and P. aurelia
both genes contain large (in frame) upstream open reading frames [4]. In Euplotes the cox2 frames reach extreme
lengths, 1021 amino acids in E. crassus and 1017 amino
acids in E. minuta (Figure 5a, b). The insert does not show
significant similarity to any known gene, precluding the
inference of function and functional constraints by
sequence similarity. The sequencing of two Euplotes species, however, allows us to assess whether there is any
selection on the protein coding sequence by calculating
the ratio of non-synonymous over synonymous substitutions (dn/ds) and test for protein sequence conservation.
Figure 6a shows the ClustalW alignment [19] between the
Cox2 proteins in Euplotes and several other ciliate species.
There are only two regions that could be unequivocally
aligned among all the ciliates and of which the alignment
did not depend on the program used [20,21]. These
regions are indicated by the high conservation and quality
bars in Figure 6. They are also highly conserved between
the two Euplotes sequences (dn = 0), and overlap with the
regions for which we detected likely sequence similarity
with the PFAM Cox2 domain, albeit with an insignificant
E-value for the N-terminal part [22]. In contrast, there
appear to be less constraints on the primary sequence of
the ~700 amino acid in-frame cox2 insert (65% identity
between the two Euplotes sequences). For cox1, we found
a similar situation (see Additional file 1: Fig. S1 and Additional file 2:Fig. S2) When the Cox1 protein sequences of

both Euplotes species are compared with the Cox1 protein
sequence of Bos taurus a large insert in frame of 380 amino
acids was identified between positions 119-120. T. pyriformis and P. aurelia possess an insert of 271 amino acids
in exactly the same position. Furthermore, it seems that
the cox1 genes of T. pyriformis and both Euplotes species
contain N-terminal extensions of about 40 amino acids.
The N-terminal extension in P. aurelia is a bit longer,
about 83 amino acids. The N-terminal extensions of the
cox1 gene in both Euplotes species and in P. aurelia harbour
a potential mitochondrial import signal that has been
identified by the program Mitoprot [23]. In a recent publication [24] it was observed that latent mitochondrial targeting signals are present on the mitochondrial genomes
of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. It is possible that
some of the N-terminal extensions we find in Euplotes spp.
play a role as latent mitochondrial targeting signals. Alternatively, they could function as an internal localization
signal, resulting from a bias in nucleotide alteration, or
even hint at the possibility of back-transfer of genes from
the nucleus to the organelle [25]. Furthermore, the cox1
gene of E. minuta possesses a C-terminal extension (267
amino acids) that has not been found in the other ciliates,
including E. crassus.
Another cytochrome c related gene, ccmF/yejR, is also
found in both Euplotes species (Table 1). It is a cytochrome
c assembly protein that encodes the potential catalytic

subunit of cytochrome c lyase. There is a large difference
in the lengths of the ccmF/yejR genes between these ciliates. T. pyriformis (513 amino acids) and E. minuta (461
amino acids) have a large C-terminal extension. The corresponding extensions in P. aurelia (256 amino acids) and
E. crassus (243 amino acids) are significantly smaller.
Only one Complex V gene, ATPase 9, has been identified
in E. minuta. It is also located on the mitochondrial
genomes of T. pyriformis and P. aurelia (Table 1). The corresponding region in E. crassus was not sequenced.
Ribosomal proteins
Mitochondrial genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal
proteins are common in plants and protists but have
never been found in the mitochondrial genomes of animals. Ciliates possess a limited number of ribosomal proteins on their mitochondrial genomes. So far 7 ribosomal
proteins have been identified in E. minuta (Table 1).
Another ribosomal protein, rpl14 from E. crassus, which is
present in all other ciliate mitochondrial genomes, has an
N-terminal extension (33 amino acid) that has no significant similarity with other known proteins. Similar extensions were observed for the rpl16, rps4 and rps12 genes in
both ciliates E. crassus and E. minuta (Table 3). When the
mitochondrial genes were examined with the mitochondrial import signal prediction program Mitoprot [23] we
found high scoring hits for all ribosomal proteins in E.

minuta and all ribosomal proteins in E. crassus except one.
All these ribosomal proteins also contained a predicted
cleavage site. Analyses of the mitochondrial ribosomal
proteins of T. pyriformis and P. aurelia indicated that also
some of these proteins possessed a potential import signal. An analysis based on the signal prediction programs
Predotar [26] and TargetP [27] gave less hits but still identified a significant number of potential mitochondrial
import signals (Table 3).
tRNA genes
Among eukaryotes the number of mitochondrial-encoded
tRNA genes varies from 26 tRNAs in Reclinomonas americana to zero in apicomplexa [28]. Seven different tRNA
genes were identified in the mitochondrial genome of E.
minuta (trnE, trnF, trnH, trnM, trnY, trnQ and trnW) in
contrast to only four such tRNA genes in P. aurelia (trnF,
trnM, trnW and trnY) (Table 1) [1]. In E. crassus only 5

tRNA genes were identified. Also, in T. pyriformis a set of
seven tRNA genes were identified i.e. trnE, trnF, trnH, trnL,
trnM, trnW and trnY [4]. The mitochondrial-encoded
tRNA for Glutamine (trnQ) seems to be unique for
Euplotes, since it was not identified in either T. pyriformis or
in P. aurelia; trnL is duplicated in T. pyriformis. Two different programs (tRNAscan-SE and ARAGORN) did not
detect a tRNA for tryptophan (W); instead, this tRNA was
identified as a tRNA for selenocystein. Recently however,
the presence of trnW in the mitochondrial genome of E.
crassus was experimentally confirmed by Turanov et al.
[29].
Open reading frames
Additional 17 orfs have been identified in E. minuta and

aurelia (ymf64/orf234). In T. thermophila the gene ymf64
has been identified as a putative ribosomal protein, based
on physicochemical parameters of the predicted protein
[3]. Comparison of an alignment of the ymf64 homologs
in the ciliates with the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in
PFAM, using the sensitive profile-profile based homology
detection tool HHsearch [30] indicates that ymf64 exhibits
significant sequence similarity with the C-terminal
domain of the ribosomal protein S3 (P < 2.1 E-5, Additional file 3: Fig. S3). An HMM of the genes that are currently annotated as rps3 in the Tetrahymena species and in
P. aurelia indicated that they are homologous to the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein S3 (P < 2.1 E-5).
The gene length of ymf64 in T. thermophila is 330 amino
acids; in P. aurelia (orf234) it has a length of 234 amino
acids. The orthologous Euplotes genes are much larger
(767 and 768 amino acids, respectively). We could not
detect significant sequence similarity of the S3 N-terminal
domain to any of the Euplotes sequences.
For the remaining 16 orfs in E. minuta and 12 in E. crassus
no homologous genes were found using BlastX and
BlastN searches. However, one of these, orf267(orf 297 in
E. crassus), which is part of the conserved region of four
genes in Euplotes spp., is weakly conserved when compared
to orf161/ymf74 in T. pyriformis and orf178-2/ymf84 in P.
aurelia (Table 2)

Mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes
The mitochondrial large and small subunit ribosomal
RNA genes in five Tetrahymena species and in P. aurelia are
split into two pieces [4]. In all these Tetrahymena species
the rnl gene is duplicated. Analysis of the mitochondrial
genomes of E. minuta and E. crassus by BlastN identified
the regions were the rnl and rns genes are situated. The rnl
gene in Euplotes species is not duplicated as in the Tetrahymena species. Even by sensitive Smith-Waterman queries
[31] with selected parts of the rnl and rns sequences from
other ciliate species, we did not find any indication that
these genes were split in Euplotes (not shown). Both, the
region containing the putative rnl and the region containing the putative rns, have significant sequence similarity to
the rnl and the rns of the published mitochondrial ciliate
ribosomal RNAs. Nevertheless, the regions of significant
sequence similarity do not cover the complete published
ribosomal RNAs, prohibiting complete sequence alignment and therewith assessment as to whether these RNAs
are complete or interrupted. As expected, a 5S rRNA gene
could not be identified.
Genetic code
Analysis of the codon usage as described in the Methods
section confirmed that both Euplotes species use the protozoan mitochondrial code, with TGA encoding tryptophan. There are a few spurious predictions (TCG, ATG
and ACC in E. crassus and TAG, ATT, ATG and ACC in E.
minuta), but for all these cases we find the correct translation at an almost equal score. The prediction that TAG

Conclusion
When the mitochondrial genome of T. pyriformis was published and compared with that of P. aurelia, it seemed that

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:514

the mitochondrial gene order in ciliates was very well conserved [4]. With the determination of the mitochondrial
genome of a third ciliate genus, belonging to a completely
different taxon, we have shown that the gene order in
mitochondrial genomes of ciliates can be very different
while a similar set of genes is conserved. Also the linearity
of the mitochondrial chromosomes is conserved. This
might suggest that monomeric linear mitochondrial chromosomes, which are relatively rare among protozoa and
animals [32], are characteristic for ciliates. This possibility
is corroborated by the observation that also species
belonging to the sister taxon apicomplexa possess linear
mitochondrial chromosomes [33]. However, it should be
noted that among yeasts even the mitochondrial genomes
of closely related species differ with respect to their linearity/circularity [32].
From the 17 unidentified open reading frames in the
mitochondrial genome of Euplotes minuta two could be
found with significant sequence similarity to T. pyriformis
and P. aurelia (Table 2). This contrasts with the situation
in T. pyriformis and P. aurelia where 13 out of the 22 unidentified open reading frames in T. pyriformis were also
found in P. aurelia [4]. One of these orfs, ymf64, has now,
with the aid of the Euplotes sequences and profile based
homology searches been shown to be significantly similar
to a known protein domain, the C-terminal part of the
Rps3 protein. This suggests that with the sequencing of
more mitochondrial genomes of the ciliates also for other
orfs sequence similarity might be detected with known
mitochondrial genes.
One of the rare mitochondrial features present in the
mitochondrial genomes of T. pyriformis and P. aurelia is a
split nad1 gene. This split gene has also been identified in
Euplotes and thus seems to be specific for a large group of
(maybe all) ciliates.
One of the most striking differences between the mitochondrial genomes of Euplotes and those of Tetrahymena
species and P. aurelia is the presence of a large repeat
region in the middle of the mitochondrial genome of
both Euplotes species that seems to be used as a bi-directional transcription start. No such repeat was found in Tetrahymena species and P. aurelia and, in contrast to Euplotes,
the transcription direction changes several times.
Another striking feature of the genes in the mitochondrial
genome of Euplotes species is the presence of very large
open reading frames. Most of these large orfs contain Nterminal extensions, but in some cases, like the cox1 and
cox2 genes, large inserts in frame cause this effect. Such
inserts in frame were also detected in Tetrahymena sp. and
P. aurelia. Surprisingly, all of the N-terminal extensions of
genes encoding ribosomal proteins of Euplotes minuta con-

tain a potential targeting signal for import into mitochondria. This is the first report identifying such import signals
in mitochondrial-encoded genes in organisms other than
plants.
Sequencing and analyzing the mitochondrial genomes of
E. crassus and E. minuta shows that the mitochondrial
genomes of ciliates are rearranged more extensively than
previously thought. Sequencing of the mitochondrial
genome of E. minuta also did not provide any evidence for
the presence of a slightly deviating, alternative genome
that might be expected for the two morphs of mitochondria observed in this species. Studying these mitochondrial genomes has provided additional information about
the evolution of mitochondria in general and in particular
about the evolution of the elusive hydrogenosomal
genome of Nyctotherus ovalis [10], which appeared to be
more related to the mitochondrial genome of Euplotes
than to those of Paramecium and Tetrahymena.

Methods
E. minuta cells were collected in 2005 in the Mediterranean sea near Stareso, Corsica, France (Em. S1, E. minuta
Stareso1), cultured in the laboratory in artificial sea water
obtained from the Botanical and Zoological Garden Stuttgart (Wilhelma) and fed with Klebsiella minuta grown on
nutrient agar. For the isolation of DNA, a concentrated
sample of living cells was mixed with 8 M guanidiniumchloride. A 10:1 mixture with 1 M phosphate buffer pH
7.0 was made, adsorbed on a hydroxyapatite (Biorad, biogel HTP) column (1 cm × 0.4 cm) and washed with 4 M
guanidiniumchloride, 100 mM phosphate buffer pH =
7.0, followed by washing with 4 M guanidiniumchloride,
200 mM phosphate buffer pH = 7.0. Subsequently, the
bulk of DNA was eluted with 4 M guanidiniumchloride
500 mM phosphate buffer pH = 7.0. The DNA was diluted
with 1 volume water and precipitated with 10 v/v% 3 M
sodiumactetate pH = 5.2 and 50 v/v % propanol-2 for 10
minutes at room temperature. After precipitation and
washing the pellet was air dried. Finally, the DNA pellet
was dissolved in DEPC treated water (Invitrogen).
The dissolved DNA was loaded on a pulsed field agarose
gel (1% agarose type II medium EEO, Sigma) and run at
170 V (145 mA) ramping from 2.5 s - 25 s for 16 hours
PFGE with a LKB 2015 Pulsaphor plus control unit.
The band just below the first band of the lambda marker
(Figure 3) was cut out and the DNA extracted. The position of the mitochondrial band on pulsed field gel is a
clear indication of a linear mitochondrial genome. Circular mitochondrial genomes of this size should run much
faster in the gel. The DNA of the band was digested with
Sau 3A and then size fractionated on an agarose gel. The
DNA from these fractions was isolated from the gel,

ligated in pUC-18 digested with BamH1 and transformed
in E. coli DH101B cells. The titre of the library was 1.12 ×
105. From this library, plasmid DNA from 288 different
colonies was sequenced with an ABI prism 3730 online
capillary sequencing machine and the mitochondrial
genome was assembled as described below. The gene
library was constructed by Genterprise, Mainz, Germany.
E. crassus was collected from shallow coastal waters of the
sandy beach of Porto Recanati (43° 26' N, 13° 40' E) on
the Italian Adriatic Coast, 50 km south of Ancona, July
1984 and cultured in the laboratory in artificial sea water
(NaCl 465 mM, KCl 10 mM, MgCl2.6H2O 24.8 mM,
MgSO4.7H2O 28.1 mM, CaCl2 10.4 mM, NaHCO3 2.4
mM pH 8.0).
Initially, a culture was kept in artificial seawater in an
Erlenmeyer flask and fed with a small piece of raw beef.
Alternatively, a set of 200 ml tissue flasks was first siliconized, filled with approximately 50 ml of artificial seawater, and inoculated with E. crassus cells. These cultures
were fed with HB101 E. coli cells.
Total DNA of E. crassus was isolated by dissolving cells in
8 M guanidiniumchloride and purification by hydroxyapatite as described above for E. minuta.Four fragments of
different mitochondrial genes were obtained by PCR with
degenerated primers on this DNA, i.e. primers directed
against the ribosomal genes rnl (5'-GTCAAGAGAGAAACAGC-3', 5'-GCATAGGGTCTTCCCGTC-3'), rns (5'TGTGCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAA-3', 5'-TCCCMTACCRGTACCTTGTGT-3') and the complex I genes nad7 (5'TTCGGWCCHCARCAYCCHGC-3',
5'-CTRTCRACYTCWCCRAARAC-3')
and
nad10
(5'-TTYGGHYTNGCHTGHTG-3',
5'ARDGCYTCDSWDGTDGGDGGDCA-3') On these gene
fragments primers for long range PCR were developed and
long range PCR with LA-Taq-polymerase (5 U/μl) (Takara
bio inc.) was performed. The long range PCR products
were digested with different restriction enzymes, subcloned in pUC-18 (Sigma) or in pGEM-T easy (Promega)
and sequenced. Sequencing was performed at the DNA
diagnostics centre of the Nijmegen University Medical
Center using M13 forward and reverse primers.
All sequences have been submitted to NCBI GenBank. The
GenBank accession-numbers are for E. minuta GQ903130
and for E. crassus GQ903131. The protein identifiers are
displayed in additional file 4.
Analysis of the sequence data
Sequences were edited using chromas Lite 2.01 http://
www.technelysium.com.au The edited sequences were
assembled using BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 [34]. Open reading frames were identified with orf Finder http://

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/514

www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html. tRNAs were identified with tRNAscan-SE http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAs
can-SE/ and ARAGORN [35]. Sequence similarity searches
of deduced amino acid sequences were performed with
BLASTX and BLAST2 [36]. The nucleotide sequence similarity searches were conducted with BLASTN (NCBI) and
FASTA (EMBL-EBI). Import signal prediction was done
with Mitoprot [23], Predotar [26] and TargetP [27]. Alignments were made with ClustalX2 and ClustalW [37]. The
program
Nucleic
Acid
Dot
Plots
http://
www.vivo.colostate.edu/molkit/dnadot/index.html was
used for identifying repeat structures.
The sequences for the 18s rRNA phylogeny were aligned
using the SINA Webaligner http://www.arb-silva.de/
aligner, which aligns them in accordance with the ARB/
SILVA rRNA alignment [38] which is based on a secondary
structure model [39]. Subsequently we used Gblocks [40]
to identify reliably aligned parts, using the default settings
except that we did not require the coverage for every position to be 100%, but rather 80%. We then used PhyML
v3.0.1 (HKY85 model, optimised equilibrium frequencies, estimated ts/tv ratio, estimated proportion of invariable sites, 4 substitution rate categories, estimated gamma
distribution parameter, NNI tree topology search, 100
bootstrap iterations [41]) to obtain the phylogeny.
The genetic code used for the translation of the Euplotes
mitochondrial DNA was derived using the standard
genetic code for translation of the complete DNA
sequence in 6 frames, and searching the resulting protein
sequences for conserved Pfam-fs protein domains [42]
using HMMPFAM [30]. The amino acid frequencies provided by the Pfam HMM profiles were then used to predict
the translation of each codon. Averaging over all aligned
occurrences of the codon, the highest scoring (i.e. most
often aligned) amino acid was predicted to be the translation of the codon in vivo.
