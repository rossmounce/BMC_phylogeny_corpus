Abstract
Background: Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome (RSTS, MIM 180849) is a rare congenital disorder
characterized by mental and growth retardation, broad and duplicated distal phalanges of thumbs
and halluces, facial dysmorphisms and increased risk of tumors. RSTS is caused by chromosomal
rearrangements and point mutations in one copy of the CREB-binding protein gene (CREBBP or
CBP) in 16p13.3. To date mutations in CREBBP have been reported in 56.6% of RSTS patients and
an average figure of 10% has ascribed to deletions.
Methods: Our study is based on the mutation analysis of CREBBP in 31 Italian RSTS patients using
segregation analysis of intragenic microsatellites, BAC FISH and direct sequencing of PCR and RTPCR fragments.
Results: We identified a total of five deletions, two of the entire gene and three, all in a mosaic
condition, involving either the 5' or the 3' region. By direct sequencing a total of 14 de novo
mutations were identified: 10 truncating (5 frameshift and 5 nonsense), one splice site, and three
novel missense mutations. Two of the latter affect the HAT domain, while one maps within the
conserved nuclear receptor binding of (aa 1–170) and will probably destroy a Nuclear Localization
Signal. Identification of the p.Asn1978Ser in the healthy mother of a patient also carrying a de novo
frameshift mutation, questions the pathogenetic significance of the missense change reported as

recurrent mutation. Thirteen additional polymorphisms, three as of yet unreported, were also
detected.
Conclusion: A high detection rate (61.3%) of mutations is confirmed by this Italian study which
also attests one of the highest microdeletion rate (16%) documented so far.

Background

Methods

Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS; MIM 180849) is a
congenital disorder characterized by growth retardation
and psychomotor developmental delay, broad and duplicated distal phalanges of thumbs and halluces, and a wide
range of typical dysmorphic features. Facial dysmorphology includes down-slanted palpebral fissures, broad nasal
bridge, beaked nose and micrognathia [1]. In addition,
patients with RSTS have an increased, although not well
documented, risk of tumor formation [2,3]. RSTS was
shown to be associated with microdeletions and point
mutations in the gene encoding the CREB-binding protein (CREBBP, also known as "CBP"), located in 16p13.3
[4]. CREBBP is a transcriptional coactivator and possesses
acetyltransferase activity on lysine residues of histones
and nonhistone proteins [5]. CREBBP partecipates in
basic cellular functions, including growth, differentiation,
DNA repair and apoptosis, regulating the expression of
many genes [6]. The mutations found in RSTS patients
vary from point mutations to relatively large microdeletions, which remove the entire gene, attesting that haploinsufficiency of this dosage-sensitive gene is the
ultimate cause of the syndrome. More precisely, studies of
patients with missense and splice-site mutations that
affect only the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) domain of
CREBBP demonstrated that loss of HAT activity is sufficient to cause the syndrome [7,8]. The related p300 protein, which is encoded by the EP300 gene on chromosome
22q13.2, shares homology with CREBBP and accordingly
serves as a transcriptional coactivator endowed with a
HAT domain [9]. Mutations of EP300 have been recently
reported in a small subset (3.3%) of RSTS patients [10].
This figure and the low detection rates (from 40% to
56.6%) of CREBBP gene assessed by all mutations studies
of RSTS patients suggest that other candidate genes might
contribute to the pathogenesis of this syndrome [4,1012]. We recruited 31 patients with consistent RSTS clinical
diagnosis and we tested them by microsatellite segregation analysis, FISH, RT-PCR and direct sequencing to find
mutations of the CREBBP gene. This multimethod
approach allowed us to identify five deletions and 14
point mutations, accounting for the highest (61.3%)
mutation rate so far assessed. Particularly FISH analysis
was instrumental for detecting even subtle microdeletions
proving to be a method suitable more than mutation
analysis to disclose low level mosaic conditions.

Subjects
We analysed samples of 31 unrelated patients sent to our
laboratory with parental consent with the request of
genetic analysis for Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Studies
and procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the host institutions. The group consisted of 16
female and 15 male patients, aged 2 to 42 years. Clinical
diagnoses were established by different Centers and eventually confirmed by the coordinating clinical Center
(Dept of Pediatrics, University of Milan) based on clinical
records and photographs, when no pathogenetic mutation could be found. Careful examination of the patients'
phenotypes was done, and the presence of malformations
and medical complications were confirmed or excluded.

Thirty subjects had a normal karyotype by Giemsa-trypsin
banding at 450-band resolution; patient 38 showed a 46,
XY, der(14)t(9;14)(p11.2;p11.2) karyotype.
Cell cultures, chromosome and interphase nuclei
preparations
Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes were set up in culture from samples using Chromosome Kit "Synchro" (Celbio) and modified RPMI
(Irvine Scientific) plus 5% fetal calf serum (Gibco). The
cultures were blocked with colchicine after 72 h. Chromosome preparations were obtained using a standard technique.
Clone preparations
BAC clones RP11 95J11, RP11 461A8 and RP11 566K11
were supplied by Mariano Rocchi [13]; BAC RP11 1072J2
was purchased from the CHORI BAC PAC Resource
Center (Oakland, USA). DNA was obtained starting from
a single colony grown in 4 ml of LB medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma) following standard procedures.
FISH
BAC clones were labelled with digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche
Diagnostic) using a nick translation kit (Roche Diagnostic). The FISH experiments were performed according to
standard procedures [14]. The chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI in antifade (Vectashild), and then
visualised using a Leitz DM-RB microscope equipped for
DAPI and FITC/TRITC epifluorescence optics. The images
were captured by means of a CCD camera (Hamamatsu

software (Casti Imaging).

trols, while that carried by patient 23 was absent in 50
controls.

Analysis of FISH signals in mosaic condition
Almost 50 metaphases and 100 nuclei were scored for
each sample in order to establish the mosaic condition.
Only intact and undamaged nuclei free of cytoplasm were
analyzed. Nuclei with low signal intensities, diffuse signals, or absence of signals on both homolog chromosomes were considered to be hybridization failures and
were not scored. Two small focal (or paired) signals of the
same color and the same intensity, separated by a distance
of less than the area of one signal, were considered to be a
split signal from one chromosome. Interphase nuclei with
one large signal of the same color and increased intensity
of fluorescence with the absence of a second hybridization signal in an interphase nucleus were considered to be
overlapping (or over-position) of two signals and were
not scored. Informative mosaic samples were defined as
those in which more than 5% of the nuclei had a reproducible abnormal pattern of signals different from normal
chromosomal signals.

Results

Microsatellite segregation analysis
Fluorescent genotyping was performed as previously
described [11]. The following fluorescently dye-labeled
chromosome 16p microsatellite markers: MS4, MS2 and
D16S3065 (from centromere to telomere) were used for
segregation analysis from parents to probands. Fluorescence detection was performed on an ABI 3100 sequencer.
ABI PRISM software (Genescan) was used for gel analysis.
RT-PCR analysis
RT-PCR analysis was performed as previously described
[11] for patients 14, 16, 20, 25, 28 and 29 for whom
mRNA was available.
Molecular analysis
The DNA sequencing of all coding exons of the CREBBP
gene was performed as previously described [11]. Twentysix CREBBP PCR genomic fragments were amplified (see
Additional file 1). The DNA sequencing protocol was
updated for use with the BigDye Chemistry, Versions 2.0
and 3.1, and the ABI PRISM 310 and 377 Genetic analyzer
systems (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). If a
mutation or polymorphism was found, a second sequencing run was performed for confirmation. The origin of the
mutation or polymorphism, whether de novo or familial,
was established if parental DNA was available. Paternity
testing was not performed due to legal restrictions. The
Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [15], recent
publications [8,10-12], and the dbSNP database [16] were
consulted to check whether sequence variations were previously reported or not. Missense mutations of patients 15
and 46 identified in this study were absent in 100 con-

Clinical evaluation
Thirty-one Italian RSTS patients, whose main signs are
reported in Table 1, were carefully clinically analysed. Sex
ratio was F:M = 16:15. All patients had psychomotor/
mental retardation, which ranged from mild to severe in
17 cases. Microcephaly was evident in 20 (64.5%); a subset (12 cases) accounting for 61.3% of RSTS patients manifested poor growth. The main facial features were
specifically described and/or evident from photos (see
Figure 1) and the overall facial gestalt was absolutely typical in all but one patient. As reported in Table 1, the typical large thumb was evident in 93% (27/29 patients), and
in 11 cases it was also abducted; the hallux was large in
89% (26/29), and only in 4 cases it was valgus/varus.
Only 11 individuals had major malformations of internal
organs or limbs: congenital heart disease (patent ductus
arteriosus, ventricular/atrial septum defects, bicuspid
aorta) was reported in 6 of them, cryptorchid testes in 3,
coloboma of the optic nerve, renal hypoplasia, duodenal
malrotation and hexadactyly in one. In 5 patients supernumerary nipples were evident. Only in two cases (pt 16
and 17) lacrimal ducts stenosis and sensorineural deafness (pt 14 and 38) were signaled. In case 46 the presence
of multiple epitheliomas was reported. In another single
case (pt 15) Perthe's disease was found.
Mutation analysis
We screened the 31 recruited patients for point mutations,
small deletions or insertions, and large deletions and
duplications of the CREBBP gene. First, by genotyping the
polymorphic intragenic repeats MS4, MS2 and D16S3065
[11] plus one SNP (c.5454G>A, [12]) we could identify
two deletions spanning the whole gene in patients 30 and
41. Both deletions affected the maternal chromosome.
Figure 2 shows for patient 30: (A) the haplotype reconstruction attesting the lack of three maternally contributed
intragenic polymorphic loci; (B) FISH of the CREBBP
spanning BAC 1072J2 evidencing a signal of reduced
intensity on one chromosome 16. By means of FISH analysis we detected three additional deletions, all in a mosaic
condition. Two (pt 40, pt 66) affect the 5' of the gene,
while one (pt 38), spans mainly the central region of the
gene and its flanking 3' sequences. The last one is present
in a structurally rearranged karyotype (see subjects in the
methods section). The mosaic condition has been confirmed in two patients from which buccal smears were
available. Scoring of CREBBP specific signals on both lymphocytes (> 150 cells- metaphases and nuclei) and buccal
smears (>100 nuclei) gave comparable results in showing
an average 20% of deleted cells in both cases. A fraction of
30% deleted cells was estimated on the third case for

whom a sample of 300 cells from peripheral blood was
scored. Current studies are in progress aimed to evaluating
the extent and boundaries of all the deletions. These data
will be reported elsewhere. A schematic view of the identified deletions mapped on the encompassed genomic
CREBBP region is shown in Figure 3.
Then we screened the remaining 26 patients for point
mutations by direct sequencing of 26 PCR genomic fragments encompassing the complete coding sequence and
splice sites of CREBBP. We identified 14 sequence alterations of pathogenic significance: all are listed in Table 2
and shown in Figure 4 in their location within exons
encoding different CREBBP domains. Although the identified mutations are distributed across the whole gene

without apparent hot-spots, six, including two missense
(p.Tyr1482Cys; p.Asp1543Tyr), and four truncating
mutations
(p.Lys1239ValfsX14;
p.Gly1479X;
p.Asp1543GlnfsX39; p.Pro1655CysfsX89) are clustered
within the HAT domain. Out of the remaining mutations,
which map outside the HAT domain, five of eight are predicted to lead to premature translation stops upstream of
the HAT region, thus indirectly spoiling its function. They
comprise p.Arg370X and p.Arg424X in the N-Terminal
Transactivation Domain (TAD), p.Gln662X in the CREB
Binding Domain and p.Gln1118ProfsX13 and
p.Arg1173X in the Bromodomain. The remaining three
mutations, p.Arg14Gly in the 5' Nuclear Receptor Binding
Domain, p.Ser2015AlafsX25 and p.Gln2022ArgfsX16 in
the C-Terminal TAD, do not affect the HAT domain at all.

*development of multiple epiteliomas

Twelve of 14 mutations are novel, while p.Arg370X has
been reported by several groups [8,10,11,17] and
p.Arg424X has been also recently described [12]. As to the
nine different single nucleotide substitutions they consist
of five nonsense (pts 24, 35, 11, 32 and 34), three missense (pts 23, 15 and 46) and one splice site mutation
(patient 20). Out of the five sequence alterations producing a frameshift in the reading frame, one is a 2 bp-duplication (pt 2) leading to the potential incorporation of 12
anomalous aminoacids, three are deletions sized 1, 2 and
7 nucleotides respectively (pts 22, 17 and 21) predicting
88, 13 and 15 anomalous aminoacids and one is a splice
site mutation (c.4728+1G>A) affecting IVS 28 donor site.
Analysis of this mutation with two different softwares, the
Splice Site Prediction by Neural Network (BDGP) [18]
and the SpliceView [19] indicated that the splice donor
site was suppressed (predicted scores = 0%) and a novel
candidate donor site 260 bp upstream the mutation was
activated. The SpliceView software, also detected a near

donor site, 104 bp upstream the splice mutation. We were
able to identify CREBBP transcripts from patient 20 also
including a smaller transcript, in addition to the normal
one (Figure 5). Direct sequencing of the anomalous transcript confirmed the activation of the nearest upstream
cryptic donor site predicted by the SpliceView software.
The frameshift produced by missplicing should lead to the
incorporation of 38 anomalous aminoacids.
All three missense changes, p.Arg14Gly (pt 23),
p.Asp1543Tyr (pt 46) and p.Tyr1482Cys (pt 15) were not
previously reported. They were established to have
occurred de novo and were found absent in 50
(p.Arg14Gly) and in 100 (p.Asp1543Tyr and
p.Tyr1482Cys) healthy individuals, respectively. Furthermore all of them affect aminoacids that are highly conserved both through evolution and in the related p300
(Figure 6) [20]. p.Arg14Gly in the 5' Nuclear Receptor
Binding Domain is predicted by PSORTII [21] to cause the

Sequence (NLS) (Figure 7). This NLS is a typical monopartite cluster of basic residues, with a conserved pattern
starting with Pro, followed by Lys or Arg in 3 out of 5 residues (PKRAKLS) [22,23]. In addition the same software
predicted another central bipartite Nuclear Localization
Signal at 1591 (KKTNKNKSSISRANKKK). Both the NLSs
are highly conserved in mouse CREBBP and in p300 protein. p.Tyr1482Cys and the p.Asp1543Tyr are both in the
HAT domain. Finally we detected 18 CREBBP polymorphisms, including 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and a 3'UTR 1 bp-duplication (see Additional file

2). Three of the sequence variations have not been previously reported, including two intronic SNPs (c.398322C>T, c.4560+14A>G) and the 3'UTR 7329+25dupC.
Conversely the sequence variation (c.5933A>G), was
reported in other patients with RSTS [11,12]. This substitution, causing the p.Asn1978Ser change in a conserved
glutamine-rich region, downstream the HAT domain, has
been inherited by our patient 22 by his apparently normal
mother. The same patient was found to bear a de novo
truncating mutation in the exon upstream the
p.Asn1978Ser change (c.4963delC). We were able to
establish that both mutations occurred on the maternal

we detected the same nucleotide substitution in one of 50
controls analysed.

Discussion
By investigating 31 RSTS Italian patients using approaches
suitable to detect most types of CREBBP mutations we
identified bona fide causative lesions in 19 subjects
(61.3%), a score slightly higher than that recently
reported [12]. Complementary application of FISH and
microsatellite analysis allowed us to detect five microdeletions, (which refined FISH characterization will be published elsewhere) one of the highest microdeletion rate
(16%) documented so far, a finding that emphasizes possible underestimation of CBP microdeletions in RSTS
patients [24-26]. Data achieved using realtime quantitative PCR are consistent with this view [27].
Interestingly this is the first report describing mosaicism
for CREBBP deletions, indicating the contribution of
mitotic errors to this rare syndrome, that might exploit the
same breakpoints of the highly unstable region around
intron 2 of CREBBP evidenced in cancer [28-30]. It should
be noted that in one case (pt 38) the CREBBP mosaic dele-

tion is in the context of a rearranged karyotype, which
may account for the complex phenotype of the patient.
By sequencing all exons and splice sites of the CREBBP
gene, we identified on a total of 26 patients 14 different
mutations, only two of which have been described [8,1012,17]. Neither a predominant type of mutation nor clustering of mutations within the CREBBP gene are apparent.
In agreement with previous studies, most mutations (11/
14,
>78%)
predict

codons
[4,7,8,11,12,17,24]. Since RSTS is an autosomal dominant trait, it can be assumed that truncating mutations are
disease causing mutations making superfluous to determine their de novo origin [10,11]. We also detected three
putative missense mutations, in which the pathogenic
role is much less clear. However, we were able to confirm
the de novo origin of all three missense mutations which
were found only once among 26 patients analysed and
were never observed in a 100 normal controls (50 in the
case of patient 23), ruling out that they are unreported
CBP polymorphisms. Moreover, when compared with the
murine CREBBP (Genbank: S66385) [31], which shows
95% identity across the whole 2441 aa length of the protein, all the three mutated residues were conserved (Figre

6). More generally their conservation, both phylogenetic,
from fruit fly to C. Elegans, and in the related p300 protein
highlights the functional importance of these residues in
the protein. Interestingly, two missense mutations are in
the HAT domain of CREBBP, where similar mutations
were shown to be sufficient to cause the RSTS phenotype
as they destroyed the acetyltransferase activity [7,8]. Furthermore p.Tyr1482Cys (patient 15) is in the postulated
coenzyme A binding site (aminoacids 1459–1541). It
may not be fortuitous that the phenotypic presentation of
this patient strikingly overlaps the clinical presentation of
a second patient (20), carrying a splicing mutation affecting the same domain. Application of RT-PCR allowed to
document the deleterious consequence of the splicing
mutation and to better interpret the patient's phenotype.
Indeed both patients 15 and 20 are affected by severe
mental retardation and complete absence of speech. The
third missense mutation, p.Arg14Gly, found in patient
23, is localised in the 5' end of the CREBBP protein, where
no other missense mutation has been reported. Aminoacids from 1 to 100 are known to be responsible for the

Nuclear-Receptors binding (RAR, GR TXR) [32]. Moreover, according to the PSORTII software the resulting aminoacid change is predicted to disrupt a putative Nuclear
Localization Signal. Functional studies of this mutant protein are in progress to determine whether the predicted
NLS is necessary for the correct import of the protein into
the nucleus. It should be noted that patient 23 has a mild
phenotype, characterised by normal growth and absence
of microcephaly. This peculiar phenotype might be
accounted for by a reduced amount of CREBBP protein in
the nucleus because of impaired translocation of the
mutated product, rather than by a reduced binding to
Nuclear-Receptors.
In this study we detected the c.5933A>G leading to
p.Asn1978Ser change in patient 22, who carries also a de
novo truncating mutation (c.4963delC). We were able to
establish the cis phase of the two alterations on the maternal allele. The same p.Asn1978Ser change was found in a
classic RSTS patient [11] and has been recently described
as a recurrent mutation, in a patient displaying an incom-

plete RSTS phenotype [12]. We detected the same change
in our patient 22's healthy mother, and subsequently in
one of 50 additional control individuals who were studied: thus we infer it may be counted among CREBBP polymorphisms. Consistent with this view, the resulting
amino acid substitution, located outside the HAT domain,
affects an aminoacidic residue conserved in the mouse,
but not either in fruit fly and C. Elegans, or in p300 (Figure
6). Interestingly, a different change of the same residue
(p.Asn1978Asp) has been recently detected in an ovarian
and a breast tumour from unrelated individuals. Mutation
analysis in germline DNA which could be performed on
one of the two individuals showed the same sequence
alteration present in the tumours [33]. The authors
emphasised that the individual carrying the mutation in
the germline does not have the RSTS phenotype, as
expected of someone with a CREBBP mutation. All the
cumulated evidences indicate the affected CREBBP codon
as a highly polymorphic site, resulting in a aminoacidic
change which does not disrupt protein function sufficiently to cause RSTS or to predispose to breast and/or
ovarian cancer. The overall data might help to interpret
this sequence change and to keep it into account in
genetic counselling.

Finally, we identified 13 additional sequence variations,
which can be added to the list of known CREBBP polymorphisms (see Additional file 2). Interestingly our
patients 16 and 25 share five different polymorphisms
inherited from their parents, in agreement with a recent
report [12]. Also our two families do not appear to be
related, but extended genetic histories were not available.

Conclusion
By combining different techniques we identified a
CREBBP mutation in 61.3% of RSTS cases, a mutation rate
higher than that of a recent study [12]. Intragenic microsatellite markers and FISH analysis enabled us to identify
one of the highest microdeletion rate (16%) documented
so far [24-26,34]. No significant correlation could be
established between different types of mutation and the
clinical presentation and significantly, the patients proved
negative to CREBBP mutation screening (both point
mutations and deletions) represented the whole RSTS
phenotypic spectrum. The overall mutation rate attested
by our study and the fact that most CREBBP-negative
patients did not display a mild or borderline RSTS clinical
presentation provide further indirect evidence on the
involvement of genes other than CREBBP in the RSTS phenotype. Indeed, a few CREBBP lesions might have been

underestimated, as we ruled out silent exonic alterations
affecting splicing enhancers (in the CREBBP-negative
patients 14, 16, 25, 28 and 29), but not intronic alterations affecting splicing as analysis at the RNA level was
precluded. Similarly the CREBBP promoter could not be
tested, as direct sequencing was attempted, but raised
technical problems. However the putatively missed
CREBBP alterations likely do not cover the whole fraction
of negative cases with a consistent RSTS phenotype. It may
be that a few of the screened patients will turn out, upon
a closer clinical examination, to have a different syndrome
that resembles RSTS. However, considering the larger set
of RSTS patients cumulatively ascertained by other
groups, yet mutations were not found in more than half
their patients as well [11,12]. The recent finding of only
three mutations of the CREBBP homologue p300 in a
series of 91 patients did not prompt us to screen this gene
in our much more restricted cohort [10]. However genetic
heterogeneity of RSTS patients is documented and lesions
in other genes encoding for proteins that interact with

CREBBP in various signal transduction pathways, should
be considered.
