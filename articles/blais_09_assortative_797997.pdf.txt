Abstract
Background: Research on the evolution of reproductive isolation in African cichlid fishes has
largely focussed on the role of male colours and female mate choice. Here, we tested predictions
from the hypothesis that allopatric divergence in male colour is associated with corresponding
divergence in preference.
Methods: We studied four populations of the Lake Malawi Pseudotropheus zebra complex. We
predicted that more distantly-related populations that independently evolved similar colours would
interbreed freely while more closely-related populations with different colours mate assortatively.
We used microsatellite genotypes or mesh false-floors to assign paternity. Fisher's exact tests as
well as Binomial and Wilcoxon tests were used to detect if mating departed from random
expectations.
Results: Surprisingly, laboratory mate choice experiments revealed significant assortative mating
not only between population pairs with differently coloured males, but between population pairs
with similarly-coloured males too. This suggested that assortative mating could be based on nonvisual cues, so we further examined the sensory basis of assortative mating between two
populations with different male colour. Conducting trials under monochromatic (orange) light,
intended to mask the distinctive male dorsal fin hues (blue v orange) of these populations, did not
significantly affect the assortative mating by female P. emmiltos observed under control conditions.
By contrast, assortative mating broke down when direct contact between female and male was
prevented.
Conclusion: We suggest that non-visual cues, such as olfactory signals, may play an important role
in mate choice and behavioural isolation in these and perhaps other African cichlid fish. Future
speciation models aimed at explaining African cichlid radiations may therefore consider
incorporating such mating cues in mate choice scenarios.

Background
One of the most significant recent development in speciation theory has been the increased attention given to sexual selection as an evolutionary force capable of rapidly
inducing reproductive isolation among populations [1].
Sexual selection is thought to have played an important
role in major adaptive radiations, such as those of Hawaiian Drosophila [2,3] and East African cichlid fishes [4-6].
Because many closely related species differ in sexually
dimorphic male breeding colour, many studies on cichlid
fishes from Lakes Malawi and Victoria have emphasized
the possible role of female choice of male nuptial colour
as a driving force for speciation [5,7-10]. The observations
that individual females can have preferences for different
male colour patterns and that these preferences lead to
reproductive isolation between incipient species have
been used to model speciation in cichlid radiations [e.g.
[11-14]]. The breakdown of assortative mating between a
pair of sympatric Lake Victoria cichlid species in turbid
waters [15], the breakdown of assortative mating during
laboratory experiments under monochromatic light [9],
and the observation that non-hybrid females prefer
hybrid males that have the colours of conspecifics [16]
provided evidence that female mating preferences for
male courtship hue are important in reproductive isolation in Lake Victoria cichlids.
Cichlid fishes specialised to live on rocky shores are
known to be philopatric and poor dispersers, with significant genetic structure among populations isolated by
habitat discontinuities [17,18]. It has been proposed that
differentiation of mating traits under divergent sexual
selection among allopatric populations may contribute to
the high diversity of these lineages [4-6,19]. Allopatric colour variants are common among the rock-dwelling haplochromine species of Lake Malawi [20], and a substantial
proportion of the estimated species richness of these fish
is based on the allocation of species status to allopatric
colour variants [21,22]. Laboratory mate choice trials with
closely related populations have indicated substantial,
albeit incomplete, assortative mating between populations that differ substantially in male colour and random
mating between populations with more similar colour
[6], suggesting that colour differentiation may play a pivotal role in prezygotic isolation.
Similar adult male coloration can be found in populations from widely separated localities within Lake Malawi
[23]. Molecular phylogenetic analysis using microsatellites [24] and genome-wide surveys of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) [25] indicate that
some of these populations have evolved similar colours
independently. A powerful way of testing the role of male
colour-female preference coevolution in producing prezygotic isolation among these species is to test whether

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/53

assortative mating of populations can be predicted based
on similarity of independently derived colour patterns.
Indeed, if male colour tightly coevolved with female preference, we would expect to find cases of parallel speciation whereby unrelated populations that independently
evolved similar male coloration would freely interbreed.
We would furthermore predict that females discriminate
against males from more closely-related populations with
different colour patterns [6,23,25]. That parallel speciation may occur in nature has been shown for sympatric
benthic and limnetic populations of sticklebacks (Gasterosteus spp.) in North American lakes that have adapted to
different ecological conditions [26,27]. Although sympatric species of these fish are largely reproductively isolated
by mate choice, allopatric species of similar ecotype that
adapted independently to similar conditions in different
lakes (e.g. benthics from different lakes) lack behavioural
isolation. These findings raise the possibility that under
similar ecological conditions, populations in different
places can evolve in parallel and upon secondary contact
form one polyphyletic species [28].
However, recent laboratory studies [29] have shown that
the strong tendency of females of the Lake Malawi cichlid
Pseudotropheus emmiltos to choose conspecific males broke
down when only visual cues were available, but was
restored when the experimental design allowed olfactory
cues while still preventing direct physical contact. Males
of the sympatric species used had distinct dorsal fin markings and background hue that would have been visible
under the experimental conditions. This suggests that
male colour and female preference for male colour may
not have coevolved closely with each other in this species.
On this background, we examine the hypothesis that parallel evolution of colour in Lake Malawi cichlids resulted
in parallel speciation. We took advantage of naturally
occurring colour diversity by using four allopatric populations of the rock-dwelling Pseudotropheus zebra species
complex from Lake Malawi. Territorial males of all populations are blue with black vertical bars, but males of two
populations have orange dorsal fins, while those from the
other two sites have blue dorsal fins. According to Schluter
and Nagel [27], at least three criteria must be met to demonstrate parallel speciation. First, populations exposed to
the same conditions must be phylogenetically independent so that shared traits responsible for reproductive isolation evolved separately. Second, populations exposed to
different environmental conditions must be reproductively isolated. Third, populations exposed to the same
environmental conditions must not be reproductively isolated. Here, we selected a pair of orange/blue populations
from the northwestern part of the lake, P. emmiltos and P.
zebra, and another orange/blue pair from the southeastern
area, P. thapsinogen and P. zebra. The northwestern popu-

Page 2 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:53

lations are closely related and belong to a clade of northwestern and central eastern populations according to
AFLP data [25]. The southeastern orange population (P.
thapsiongen) was shown to have evolved independently
from the northwestern orange P. emmiltos population and
to be more closely related to the southeastern blue P. zebra
population than from the northwestern populations
according to microsatellite analysis [25]. These populations therefore satisfy the first criterion of parallel speciation established by Schluter and Nagel [27].
We tested whether partial assortative mating among allopatric populations is the result of co-evolution between
female preference and male colour, and investigated the
roles of different sensory modalities in female mate choice
experiments following two different approaches. First, we
specifically address Schluter and Nagel's [27] second and
third criteria. Under the scenario of parallel speciation
through colour-preference co-evolution, we predict random mating between distantly-related populations with
similar male colours and assortative mating between
more closely-related populations with clearly different
male colours. Second, in order to further evaluate the role
of colour divergence as the trait hypothesized to cause
reproductive isolation in the system, we artificially manipulated colour and other cues in mate choice trials involving one of these population pairs (P. emmiltos and
northern P. zebra from Nkhata Bay). We tested the importance of visual cues by comparing mate choice under normal (white) light and monochromatic light [9], while
other cues were manipulated by comparing female choice
of males under white light behind transparent partitions
[29].

Methods
a) Experimental animals
The study populations were members of the Pseudotropheus zebra species complex, cichlid fish endemic to Lake
Malawi. The taxonomy of this group is confused, and
these fish are sometimes assigned to the genus or subgenus Maylandia or the genus Metriaclima. Many allopatric
colour variants have been assigned species names, while
others have not. Territorial males of all four study populations are pale blue with strongly contrasting black vertical
bars, but populations differ in the colour of the dorsal fin.
Male P. zebra from Nkhata Bay (11°36'S, 34°18'E) on the
northwestern shore and Chiofu Bay (13°13'S, 34°52'E)
on the southeastern shore have blue dorsal fins (henceforth referred to as 'northern blue' and 'southern blue',
respectively). Male P. thapsinogen from Chimwalani
(Eccles) Reef (13°46'S, 34°58'E) off the southeastern
shore and male P. emmiltos from Mpanga Rocks (10° 25'S
34°16'E) near the northwestern shore have orange dorsal
fins and are referred to as 'southern orange' and 'northern
orange', respectively (Figure 1). P. thapsinogen (southern

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/53

orange) males have yellow throat membranes, whereas
those of the northern orange males (P. emmiltos) are dark
grey. These throat membranes are normally not visible
unless protruded beneath the gill-cover as part of a lateral
display. However, these displays are typically part of
antagonistic rather than courtship interactions, and therefore it is unlikely that females use this trait in mate choice.
The taxonomy, morphology and ecology of these populations were discussed by Stauffer et al. [30] and the biology
of these and related 'mbuna' species reviewed by Genner
& Turner [31]. Fish used were wild-caught, although some
first-generation laboratory stock bred from wild-caught
parents were used in experiment 2. Housing and maintenance conditions have been described previously [6,29].
b) Experimental procedures
Experiment 1: Test of parallel speciation through colour-preference
coevolution
Levels of behavioural reproductive isolation were measured in glass aquaria 6 m long × 0.7 m wide × 0.4 m deep
under a 'partial partition' design [6,32], where males were
confined to territories of floor dimensions 60 × 70 cm
using plastic grids adjusted to allow the smaller females to
pass through and spawn with any preferred male. Standard fluorescent lamps were used throughout the study.
Although Pseudotropheus species express a UV-sensitive
cone opsin, examinations of photographs of these and
related species taken under UV light did not reveal any
UV-specific markings, simply a greater degree of luminosity of the bright blue parts of their colour, which does not
vary noticeably between the populations. It is therefore
unlikely that different results could have been obtained
with UV-enhanced tubes. Terracotta flower pots were provided as spawning caves. Four males (size-matched within
5 g) and 10–15 females of each of two populations were
present throughout the experiment. Males' positions in
the tank were randomized, except that two males of the
same population were not allowed to be neighbours. After
at least one clutch had been produced by females of both
populations, one or two males of each population were
removed, and replaced by size-matched males of the same
population, and all males were moved to new territories.
For each population comparison, 5–7 rearrangements
were carried out, and 8–11 males per population used to
minimise the influence of individual variation in male
attractiveness. Courtship behaviour is known to be highly
conserved in haplochromine cichlids across broad taxonomic scales [33] and we did not observe any differences
in courtship behaviour among populations. It was estimated that 63% of males used sired part or all of one or
more clutches. Four population combinations were
tested. Of these, two reciprocal trials compared more distantly-related populations with similar male colours: 1) P.
emmiltos females choosing between males of the same
population and P. thapsinogen males and vice versa

(northern v southern orange) and 2) P. zebra females from
Nkhata Bay choosing between males of the same population and P. zebra males from Chiofu Bay and vice versa
(northern v southern blue). The other two reciprocal trials
compared more closely-related and geographically proximal populations with distinct male colours: 1) P. emmiltos
females choosing between males of the same population
and P. zebra males from Nkhata Bay and vice versa (northern orange v blue), and 2) P. thapsinogen females choosing
between males of the same population and P. zebra males
from Chiofu Bay and vice versa (southern orange v blue).
Before introduction into the experimental aquarium, all
males and females were PIT-tagged for individual identification, and fin-clipped for DNA testing. A small piece of
tissue was cut from the soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin and
placed in 100% ethanol. Mouthbrooding females were
removed from the aquarium ca. 5–10 days after spawning
and their offspring removed by gently opening the
female's mouth and allowing the fry to drop into a tray of
water containing an anaesthetic overdose (MS-222). Fry
were then preserved in 100% ethanol. Paternity was
assigned by genotyping all mothers, potential fathers and
3–15 offspring per clutch at between two and four microsatellite loci: UNH130 [34], UNH002 [35], UME002 [36],
and Pzeb2 [37]. DNA was extracted from tissue samples
using the HOTSHOT method [38] and amplified using a
FAM/HEX/TET-labelled forward primer. PCR conditions
consisted of 30 cycles of 30 sec at 95°, 60 sec at 55°, 60
sec at 72° in a 20 μl reaction volume containing 0.25 mM
of each dNTP, 2 μl of 10× reaction buffer (Bioline, London, UK) 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 U of taq DNA polymerase
(Bioline, London, UK), 25 ρmol of each primer and
approximately 1 μg of template genomic DNA in a TGradient thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). PCR
products were resolved on an ABI 310 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, U.S.A.), with ROX-labelled internal size
standards. Alleles were sized using Genemapper (Applied
Biosystems).
Experiment 2: Test for role of colour in behavioural isolation
Experiments were run in aquaria of dimensions 180 × 45
× 33 cm or 200 × 50 × 31 cm in which mate choice was
determined from a group of 10–20 females of a single species at a time (northern orange P. emmiltos or northern
blue P. zebra from Nkhata Bay). In all trials, the males
were size-matched for weight (± 5 g) and standard length
(± 5 mm). Female choice was assayed by counting eggs
that had collected underneath mesh false-floors, where
they were inaccessible to the females that would normally
collect them in their mouths [29]. The male that received
the largest number of the eggs was taken to be preferred.
Twelve males from each population (northern orange P.
emmiltos/northern blue P. zebra from Nkhata Bay) were
used in each experimental treatment. Mate choice was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/53

tested under three treatments: (i) White light with full contact, in which males were kept in compartments with false
floors, separated from a female-only compartment by
plastic grids that allowed females to pass through and
spawn inside the male compartment, the tank being illuminated with standard fluorescent lights (figure 2a); (ii)
Monochromatic light with full contact, in which the apparatus was the same as the previous treatment, but the experiment was conducted in a darkroom in which the
aquarium lights were covered with a red optical filter (primary red, Lee Filters 106, http://www.leefilters.com/light
ing/products/finder/act:colourdetails/colourRef:C4630710C51307/). This effectively masked the colour difference between males of the two populations by
transmitting light from only the orange and red portion of
the white spectrum (500–700 nm), thereby eliminating
the difference between the orange and blue dorsal fin colour; (iii) White light, visual communication only, in which
the tank, illuminated by standard fluorescent lights, was
separated into three sections by transparent 5 mm thick
acrylic partitions, with the females confined in a central
section which had a tray covered with plastic mesh adjacent to each male compartment, which contained an artificial cave used as a spawning site next to the female
compartment (figure 2b).
c) Data analysis
Simulation of parentage assignment of 10,000 randomly
generated offspring genotypes in Cervus v. 3.0.3 [39]
showed that typing between two to four (average of three)
of the four loci used resulted in an 82% successful assignment rate to one of the eight potential fathers given
known mother genotype when using a delta LOD criterion with 95% confidence interval and allowing for 1% of
mistyped loci. We first typed two loci for all individuals,
and progressively increased to three and then four loci
whenever unambiguous paternal assignment to one of the
eight possible males could not be obtained. At the end of
this process, we were able to unambiguously assign paternity to a single male for virtually all fry of all clutches. In
most cases, clutches were sired by a single male or by several males of the same population. We found only a few
cases of multiple paternity involving males of different
populations. Multiple paternity was resolved by a majority consensus rule where the sire of the majority of the first
five eggs sampled at random was considered as the preferred male, thus providing an unbiased statistical sample
at the population level. To minimise the impact of variation in clutch sizes between broods, final analyses were
based on the first 5 eggs typed, or the total, if smaller.

The significance of assortative mating of population pairs
was assessed by one-tailed Fisher Exact Tests, which tests
the hypothesis of assortative mating at the level of the
tested species pair as a whole (at the level of the whole 2

× 2 table). It is thus more powerful than testing individual
reciprocal crosses. We also report, for individual reciprocal crossings, one-tailed Binomial Tests on numbers of
broods and Wilcoxon tests on the number of eggs typed
for each clutch assigned to sires of the two populations.
The binomial test is based on the binomial distribution,
while the Wilcoxon signed-rank test does not assume anything about the shape of the distribution. The full data set
of experiment 1 included broods where analysis of maternal genotypes suggested that they were produced by
females that had already produced one brood earlier in
the experiment, or broods where males had sired the
majority of eggs sampled from a number of broods produced by different females [see Additional file 1]. To
ensure that these non-independent points did not impact
our conclusions, we analysed a reduced dataset, keeping
only the first brood produced by each female and eliminating second or subsequent broods with the same majority sire. This eliminated possible influences of overrepresentation of particular individual female preferences,
particularly successful males, or mate choice copying,
although mate choice copying by Malawi cichlids has
never been reported, and many of the clutches were
spawned weeks or months apart, often after a male had
been moved to a new territory.

Results
Experiment 1: Test of parallel speciation through colourpreference co-evolution
Eighty-nine clutches were produced and 3–15 fry (mean ±
S.E. = 6.6 ± 1.9) from each of these tested for paternity. Of
these, 12 (13% of total) were sired by males of different
populations. Forty-nine broods with dam or majority sire
involved in earlier broods were removed from the original
dataset before analysis. Once these broods were eliminated from the data set, only seven clutches sired by males
of different populations remained.
Test of random mating among similarly coloured populations
Contrary to the prediction of random mating among geographically distant populations of the same colour,
Fisher's exact tests indicated significant assortative mating
among both pairs of distantly-related populations with
similar-coloured males (Table 1). In two populations
(southern blue P. zebra and northern orange P. emmiltos),
Binomial and Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that
males from the female's population were significantly
more likely to sire the majority of the clutches (Table 1).
Northern blue P. zebra and southern orange P. thapsinogen
females also spawned more often with males from their
own population, although not significantly.
Test of assortative mating among differently-coloured populations
When comparing geographically proximate populations
with different colours, Fisher's exact test indicated signifi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/53

cant assortative mating only between P. emmiltos and P.
zebra from Nkhata Bay (Table 1). Although female P.
emmiltos, P. zebra from Nkhata Bay and P. thapsinogen
spawned more often with males of their own populations,
assortative mating was not significant in any of the individual reciprocal crosses (Binomial and Wilcoxon tests p
> 0.05; Table 1). Females of the southern P. zebra population of Chiofu Bay did not differ from random expectation and spawned half of their clutches with P. thapsinogen
males (Table 1).
Experiment 2: Test for role of colour in behavioural
isolation
Mate choice of female P. emmiltos (northern orange):
Under control conditions of full sensory contact under
white light, female P. emmiltos spawned exclusively with
males of their own (northern orange) population, rather
than northern blue P. zebra males (Table 2; Binomial p <
0.0001). This preference persisted in monochromatic
light, as females spawned with same-population males in
11 out of 12 trials (Binomial p < 0.005), which does not
differ significantly from the control (Fisher's exact test, p
~1). When free contact was blocked, but colour differences were visible under white light, they showed no significant preference, spawning with the same-population
male only in 5 of the 12 trials (Binomial p = 0.386).
Female choice with visual contact only differed significantly from that in the experiment with full sensory communication under white light (Fisher's exact test, p =
0.04).

Mate choice of female P. zebra (northern blue): With full
contact under white light, northern blue females' preference for males of their own population was not significant
(Table 2; Binomial p = 0.386), spawning with the samepopulation male in 7 out of 12 trials. Under monochromatic light, same-population males were chosen in 5 out
of the 12 trials (Binomial p = 0.386). As northern blue
females had not shown significant assortative mating in
the control treatment of experiment 2, they were not
tested with free contact blocked.

Discussion
The suggestion that sexual selection may have played a
major role in the diversification of the cichlid fishes of the
African Great Lakes has been largely inspired by the enormous diversity in colour pattern among the Malawian and
Victorian haplochromine cichlids. One of the main
assumptions of speciation models by sexual selection so
far was that evolutionary divergence in female colour preference was driving the emergence of behavioural isolation
[40]. The hypothesis of parallel speciation of populations
having independently evolved the same colour patterns
examined in this paper derives from this idea. The importance of male colour hue for reproductive isolation has

Forty-nine broods from dams or sires involved in previous spawnings were eliminated from the original dataset to ensure data independence. The
results were inconsistent with the predictions of the hypothesis of parallel speciation by divergence of male colour and associated female
preference, with significant assortative mating between geographically and phylogenetically more distant populations with similarly-coloured males
[northern orange P. emmiltos (NO) v southern orange P. thapsinogen (SO); northern blue P. zebra from Nkhata Bay (NB) v southern blue P. zebra
from Chiofu Bay (SB)] but not between more closely related and geographically proximal populations with differently-coloured males (SO v SB; NO

assortative mating broke down under monochromatic
light [9] and where non-hybrid females choosing among
hybrid males prefer those that have the colour of conspecific males [10]. These species are fully sympatric, differ in

visual pigment sensitivities [41] and in their behavioural
response to blue and red light [42]. They appear to hybridise more often in habitats with low water transparency
[15]. Strong assortative mating based on visual cues (possibly melanin pattern rather than hue) have also been

shown in the polymorphic Lake Victoria cichlid Neochromis omnicaeruleus [43,44] and the polymorphic Lake
Malawi cichlid Pseudotropheus "zebra gold" [45].
Between-population assortative mating based on colour
has yet to be convincingly demonstrated with Lake
Malawi cichlid species. Experiments with some Lake
Malawi species have shown that assortative mating can
persist when transparent partitions prevented direct contact but not visual communication [40,46,47]. These
results suggest a significant role for visual cues in mating
preference. However, these cues are not necessarily confined to the male's hue, but could also include male melanin pattern, eggspot size and number, body shape, and
male responsiveness to visual stimuli from the female.
Indeed, the pair examined by Kidd et al. [40] differ in melanin pattern rather than hue, and Jordan et al. [47] found
that assortative mating was maintained even under monochromatic light masking the species' hue differences,
implying that some visual features other than hue were
used by females. Even when it has been demonstrated that
a single cue may be sufficient for assortative mating, other
cues may also be influential. For example, olfactory cues
may be important in the later stages of courtship, while
females are initially attracted by visual signals. If a pair of
species had attained reproductive isolation based on the
preference for divergent signals in one signal modality,
there could subsequently be strong selection to recognise
and avoid courting with heterospecifics using other sensory modalities for signalling. In such cases, visual signals
could be sufficient to lead to assortative mating in experiments where access to olfactory signals was prevented,
even if divergence in olfactory signals had been the initial
cause of reproductive isolation or vice versa.
Here, laboratory mate choice tests with allopatric populations of Pseudotropheus zebra and related nominal species
were inconsistent with the predictions we derived from
the hypothesis that parallel correlated divergence in male
colour and female preferences had resulted in parallel speciation among these fishes. Firstly, we demonstrated that
allopatric populations differing in dorsal fin colour did
not show complete assortative mating, and probably
should not be considered as biological species. Unexpectedly, allopatric populations with similar colours showed
relatively high levels of (partial) assortative mating. This
suggests that colour differentiation is not necessarily a
prerequisite for the evolution of significant prezygotic isolation.
We predicted that geographically proximal and phylogenetically related populations showing clear differences in
male breeding colour would mate assortatively. This prediction was supported in one of the two population pairs
with different male colours. By contrast, the second pre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/53

diction that geographically and phylogenetically distant
populations with similar male colour should mate randomly was not verified. Instead, we found assortative mating in both pairs of similarly coloured populations from
distant locations. Of course, it is still possible that further
comparisons may show evidence for parallel speciation,
perhaps a weaker form of incipient parallel speciation,
where pairs of independently derived similar-coloured
populations may show lower levels of assortative mating
than among pairs of more closely-related differently-coloured populations.
Like most studies of behavioural evolution, we are
required to make inferences about past events based on
knowledge of current populations and their past relationships, and this is often aided by having a robust phylogeny of the study taxa and an estimate of divergence
times. Recently, it has been shown that Lake Malawi suffered a major lake level fall of around 580 m until about
70,000 years ago, with present lake levels only being
restored within the past 50,000 years [48,49]. At such
low lake levels, the nearest refuge for the southern populations used in the present study would have been
around Nkhata Bay- the site of one of the northern populations. Given that the northern and southern populations do not yet seem to mate completely assortatively
and probably occurred sympatrically 70,000 years ago, it
is likely the study populations are descended from a single common ancestor which was split into multiple populations as new habitat patches became available (and
were lost or fused) during the rapid expansion of the lake
around 60–70,000 years ago. There is no evidence that
any of these study populations have ever co-existed in
sympatry and maintained complete reproductive isolation.
The two population pairs used in this study were carefully
chosen for the similarity of their colour pattern apart from
the colour of the dorsal fin (and the yellow throat membrane of P. thapsinogen). We were unable to find any other
differences among populations in hue or melanin pattern.
However, subtle differences cannot be entirely ruled out,
although we consider it unlikely.
Another potential limitation concerns the possible influence of colour differences only visible under ultraviolet
(U.V.) light. Although we could not find any such differences when examining photographs of the specimens
under U.V. light and we found significant assortative mating in many populations without enhanced U.V. lighting,
further tests might reveal an impact of U.V. illumination
in mate choice in these populations.
Experimentally controlling the effect of visual and nonvisual cues revealed that the strong tendency of northern

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:53

orange (P. emmiltos) females to mate with same-population males over northern blue males (P. zebra) persisted
when male colour differences were masked under monochromatic light. However, assortative mating broke down
when direct contact was prevented, even when male colour differences and other visual features should have been
apparent under white light. These results are inconsistent
with colour being a necessary requirement for the assortative mating observed between northern orange females
and northern blue males, and with visual cues being sufficient for reproductive isolation of this pair. They are,
however, in agreement with Plenderleith et al.'s [29]
results demonstrating the role of olfactory cues for mate
choice when P. emmiltos females were presented with conspecific males and those of the sympatric P. fainzilberi.
This is also consistent with the findings of experiment 1
where assortative mating was observed in pairs where colour differences were absent or minimal. The lack of significant assortative mating of P. zebra females in experiment
2 compared with experiment 1 is possibly simply due to
limited statistical power, but perhaps it may also be
because experiment 2 did not allow for mate choice
among males of the same population, as only one male of
each population was used at a time. Thus, assortative mating might have been reduced when an otherwise attractive
male of another population might be chosen in preference to a male of the female's own population that was
considered less attractive, perhaps in traits that did not
differ among populations.
Future studies might aim at testing the generality of the
importance of non-visual cues in other haplochromine
species. Among the cues cichlids may use in mate choice,
those involving olfactory, acoustic and other non-visual
modalities remain little investigated. Plenderleith et al.
[29] proposed that olfactory signals may be particularly
promising for explaining some cases of assortative mating. Recently, Blais et al. [50] showed that there was evidence of adaptive divergence at MHC class II genes
between P. emmiltos (northern orange) and the sympatric
P. fainzilberi and suggested a mechanism by which this
divergence may have contributed to reproductive isolation of the pair. MHC genes are known to influence mating behaviour and kin recognition in many fishes through
olfaction [e.g. [51-53]] and to lead to female rejection of
mates with highly dissimilar MHC multilocus genotypes
in humans, Malagasy giant jumping rats, Hypogeomys antimena, and threespine sticklebacks [52,54,55]. There is
therefore one potential candidate gene for odour-based
mate choice known to have diverged between a pair of the
P. zebra complex.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/53

Haplochromine cichlids are usually strongly sexually
dimorphic in colour. We do not yet know whether olfactory signals involved in mate choice are expressed by both
sexes. If so, it would greatly increase the likelihood that
mate preferences may be learned by imprinting on the
mother during mouthbrooding, a situation that may
enhance the probability of speciation [56]. Sexual
imprinting on maternal traits, perhaps olfactory signals,
has recently been shown in a pair of Lake Victoria cichlid
fish [57]. By contrast, assortative mating based on male
breeding dress is less likely to be aided by imprinting, as
male haplochromine cichlids play no role in parental care
and male nuptial colours are not or only weakly expressed
in females [57]. Moreover, because of their chemical
nature, olfactory signals might be more likely than others
to vary with small differences in ecological traits such as
diet, microhabitat or parasite infections [50,58,59], perhaps augmenting the likelihood of reproductive isolation
among populations.

Conclusion
The three principal implications of the findings presented
here are that: (i) behavioural mating preferences in cichlid
fish depend, in some populations, not on colour, but on
other forms of sensory communication, which in some
cases is not visual; (ii) between-population divergence in
male colour does not necessarily imply divergent female
preferences, so parallel evolution of male colour is not
necessarily coupled with parallel evolution of female mating preference; (iii) sensory cues involved in behavioural
isolation among haplochromine cichlids may vary among
species and lakes and so speciation models based on one
particular mate choice scenario may not apply to whole or
all radiations of cichlids. This last point is worth bearing
in mind because the type of trait involved in species isolation might provide important clues about which evolutionary force has driven population divergence and
speciation.
