Abstract
Background: Genes responsible for biosynthesis of fungal secondary metabolites are usually
tightly clustered in the genome and co-regulated with metabolite production.
Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are a class of secondary metabolite toxins produced by
disparate ascomycete fungi and implicated in several animal and plant diseases. Gene clusters
responsible for their production have previously been defined in only two fungi. Fungal genome
sequence data have been surveyed for the presence of putative ETP clusters and cluster data have
been generated from several fungal taxa where genome sequences are not available. Phylogenetic
analysis of cluster genes has been used to investigate the assembly and heredity of these gene
clusters.
Results: Putative ETP gene clusters are present in 14 ascomycete taxa, but absent in numerous
other ascomycetes examined. These clusters are discontinuously distributed in ascomycete
lineages. Gene content is not absolutely fixed, however, common genes are identified and
phylogenies of six of these are separately inferred. In each phylogeny almost all cluster genes form
monophyletic clades with non-cluster fungal paralogues being the nearest outgroups. This
relatedness of cluster genes suggests that a progenitor ETP gene cluster assembled within an
ancestral taxon. Within each of the cluster clades, the cluster genes group together in consistent
subclades, however, these relationships do not always reflect the phylogeny of ascomycetes. Microsynteny of several of the genes within the clusters provides further support for these subclades.
Conclusion: ETP gene clusters appear to have a single origin and have been inherited relatively
intact rather than assembling independently in the different ascomycete lineages. This progenitor
cluster has given rise to a small number of distinct phylogenetic classes of clusters that are
represented in a discontinuous pattern throughout ascomycetes. The disjunct heredity of these
clusters is discussed with consideration to multiple instances of independent cluster loss and lateral
transfer of gene clusters between lineages.

Background
Filamentous fungi produce a diverse array of secondary
metabolites. These include polyketides (e.g. aflatoxins),
cyclic peptides, alkaloids and sesquiterpenoids (e.g. trichothecenes)[1]. Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are
a poorly studied class of secondary metabolite toxins
derived from cyclic peptides [2]. These toxins are made by
a phylogenetically diverse range of filamentous fungi and
are characterised by the presence of a disulphide bridge
(Fig. 1) that allows ETPs to cross-link proteins via cysteine
residues and to generate reactive oxygen species through
redox cycling, properties that confer toxicity. Epipolythiodioxopiperazines are implicated in several animal and
plant diseases, however, their distribution in fungi is
poorly understood. The role of ETPs within the fungus is
unknown, although these molecules may confer an
advantage to the fungus growing within its ecological
niche.
Genes responsible for biosynthesis of fungal secondary
metabolites are usually tightly clustered in the genome
and co-regulated in a manner consistent with the timing
of production of the metabolite. Furthermore if steps in
the biosynthetic pathway can be deduced, the gene cluster
can often be identified by searching genome sequences for
linked genes encoding appropriate enzymes [1].
The gene clusters responsible for biosynthesis of ETP toxins sirodesmin PL and gliotoxin in the ascomycetes Leptosphaeria maculans and Aspergillus fumigatus, respectively,
have been identified [3,4]. They are 55 and 28 kb in
length, respectively and ten genes are common to both
(Fig. 2). Eight of these genes encode enzymes with high
similarity to a two module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (P); thioredoxin reductase (T); O-methyl transferase (M); a methyl transferase with unknown specificity

monooxygenases (C); amino cyclopropane carboxylate
synthase (ACCS) (I); and a dipeptidase (J). While the role
of a few of these genes can be deduced (for example; P,
which catalyses the condensation of two amino acids in
the initial biosynthetic step [5]), for the others their role
in ETP biosynthesis is unknown. Two other genes encode
common functions in both clusters, a zinc binuclear
(Zn(II)2Cys6) transcriptional regulator (Z) that controls
expression of the biosynthetic enzymes [6], and a transporter (A) involved in toxin efflux [7]. Additional genes
are predicted to encode enzymes involved in the modification of the core ETP moiety, however, no functional
analyses of genes other than the peptide synthetase (P)
and the transcriptional regulator (Z) have been reported
(Table 1). The expression of genes in these clusters in L.
maculans and A. fumigatus are co-regulated consistent with
the timing of production of the respective ETP [3,4]. Further, when the peptide synthetases (P) in these clusters are
disrupted, the resultant mutants are unable to produce
sirodesmin PL and gliotoxin, respectively, consistent with
the clusters encoding the biosynthetic enzymes [3,8].
Recent studies of these mutants, and also a mutant in the
transcriptional regulator (Z) in A. fumigatus have shown
that gliotoxin contributes to virulence of A. fumigatus in
immunocompromised mice and that sirodesmin PL conTable 1: Genes in epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETP)

Figure ETP biosynthetic gene clusters in ascomycetes
Putative 2
Putative ETP biosynthetic gene clusters in ascomycetes. Genes (white text on black background) include those with
best matches to non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (P), thioredoxin reductase (T), methyl transferases (M and N), glutathione Stransferase (G) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (C), ACCS (I), dipeptidase (J), as well as a transcriptional regulator (Z)
and a transporter (A â Multi Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) or ABC). In addition genes with predicted roles in modification of the
side chains of the core ETP moiety are noted (see Table 1). Genes with no lettering are either hypothetical or have no strong
matches to ETP cluster genes. Genes shaded in grey are predicted to flank the cluster and encode proteins with best matches
to proteins with no potential roles in ETP biosynthesis. The cluster in T. virens might be incomplete as a gene common to ETP
cluster was at one end of a single cosmid clone. In M. grisea G and M, and P, J and K are annotated as fused genes. The arrangement of genes in S. diversum is based on the sirodesmin PL cluster in L. maculans; the dashed line represents unsequenced

tributes to virulence in L. maculans in the plant Brassica
napus [6,8,9].
The genome of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea,
has a cluster with nine common genes and the wheat head
scab fungus, Gibberella zeae (anamorph Fusarium grami-

naerum)has a cluster containing five common genes [3].
However, ETP production by these fungi has not been
recorded. Gliotoxin production by some distantly related
ascomycetes (for example, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichoderma virens and Penicillium terlikowskii has been reported
[4,10,11]. Also other Aspergillus species such as A. flavus, A.

niger and A. terreus produce gliotoxin [12]. It is intriguing
that this trait (gliotoxin production) has achieved such a
disjunct distribution across ascomycetes. Complete fungal
genome sequences are now available for many fungi, thus
allowing the distribution of potential ETP gene clusters
across a range of species.
In this paper we describe the distribution of ETP-like gene
clusters in a range of ascomycetes and the analyses of phylogenetic relationships of several cluster genes and their
paralogues throughout the ascomycota. These relationships have been used to examine the origin of ETP gene
clusters, and the pattern of heredity of the cluster constituents. These data are used to address whether these putative ETP gene clusters formed independently in the
various lineages of the ascomycota. Phylogenies inferred
by cluster proteins have been used to assess the likelihood
of two processes of cluster inheritance within ascomycota:
vertical inheritance coupled with multiple cluster loss,
and horizontal (lateral) transfer of entire clusters.

Results
Identification and characteristics of putative ETP
biosynthetic gene clusters
Putative ETP biosynthetic gene clusters identified from a
range of filamentous ascomycetes are presented in Figure
2. These clusters were identified by comparative analyses
of genomic data of varying states of sequence coverage
and annotation [see Additional file 1]. Also clusters were
cloned from gliotoxin-producing isolates of Trichoderma
virens and Penicillium lilacinoechinulatum (the strain of this
latter fungus had previously been wrongly identified as
Penicillium terlikowskii â see Methods section), for which
no genomic data exist. Cosmid libraries of these two fungi
were screened with a homologue of ACCS (I) and cosmids
that hybridised, and had several of the common ETP cluster genes, were sequenced and analysed. Using primers
based on genes in the sirodesmin PL and the gliotoxin
clusters, part of a putative ETP cluster was also obtained
from Sirodesmium diversum, a fungus that produces sirodesmin, although a different chiral isomer to that produced
by L. maculans [13,14]. The order of genes in this putative
cluster is based on that of the sirodesmin PL cluster in L.
maculans. Throughout the fungi examined, putative ETP
gene clusters were identified by the presence of linked
genes with best matches to eight of the common ETP cluster genes (P, T, M, N, G, C, I and J) previously described
from L. maculans and A. fumigatus. The cluster in T. virens
might be incomplete as a gene common to ETP cluster was
at one end of a single cosmid clone; further linked genes
may be part of this cluster.

Putative ETP clusters, containing strong matches to eight
of the genes (P, T, M, N, G, C, I and J) common to the clusters in L. maculans and A. fumigatus were identified in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/174

Neosartorya fischeri, P. lilacinoechinulatum and Trichoderma
reesei, as well as in M. grisea. Several other fungi had clusters missing one of these genes. Clusters in A. flavus, A.
oryzae, A. terreus and A. clavatus lacked the gene encoding
a methyl transferase (N). Trichoderma virens lacked an Omethyl transferase (M), although it had an extra methyl
transferase (N). The non-ribosomal peptide synthetases
(P) in all the clusters were bimodular, consisting of two
peptide synthetase units in tandem, except for that in G.
zeae, which had four modules. Curiously, in the A. clavatus
cluster the gene for peptide synthetase (P) has apparently
split into two separate coding sequences (although not
equally separating the two modules) that are convergently
transcribed (Fig. 2). Despite rearrangement, the predicted
coding sequence of these two genes added together shares
high sequence identity with that of the single P from A.
oryzae and A. flavus.
The gliotoxin cluster of A. fumigatus had a cytochrome
P450 monooxygenase (F) with low sequence similarity to
C and a hypothetical gene (K). These two genes are not
present in the sirodesmin PL gene cluster [3]. The hypothetical gene (K) was present only in clusters from fungi
known to produce gliotoxin (P. lilacinoechinulatum, T.
virens, A. terreus, A. flavus and A. oryzae). Aspergillus terreus
also had the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (F). Other
putative ETP clusters had additional genes or even several
copies of one particular gene; for instance, the clusters in
A. flavus and A. oryzae had two thioredoxin reductases (T),
whilst A. clavatus had three copies (Fig. 2).
The zinc binuclear (Zn(II)2Cys6) transcriptional regulator
(Z) was present in all clusters except in the larger cluster
(cluster #1) of A. terreus (Fig. 2). Transporters (A) of either
ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) or Multi Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) type were present in all clusters except M.
grisea. Aspergillus flavus and A. oryzae had two adjacent
transporter genes â one an ABC and the other an MFS
type.
Two taxa, G. zeae and Chaetomium globosum, had clusters
with fewer of the common genes. A non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (P), a thioredoxin reductase (T), a transcriptional regulator (Z) and a transporter (A) occurred in
both, and in the case of G. zeae, an ACCS (I) also (Fig. 2).
Other genes in the G. zeae cluster had best matches to two
different hydrolases, an esterase and a gene with some but
not all of the domains of a single module of a peptide synthetase. Other genes in the C. globosum cluster included
ones with best matches to genes with potential roles in
secondary metabolism â a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (with little sequence similarity to C), a methyl transferase (neither of which had strong matches to those in
ETP clusters) as well as a hypothetical protein and an
enoyl reductase. Clusters bearing a reduced set of com-

mon genes were also found as second clusters in A. fumigatus, N. fischeri and A. terreus (Fig. 2, denoted #2). These
all contained M, P and C, as well as a transporter (A) and
two transcriptional regulators (Z). This cluster in A. fumigatus and N. fischeri also had a gene with a Flavin Adenine
Dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain between Z and C;
this gene was not present in the A. terreus cluster.
Analysis of complete genome sequences of a range of
ascomycetes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces
pombe, Neurospora crassa, Ajellomyces capsulatus, Ascophaeria
apis, Aspergillus nidulans, Botryotinia fuckleliana, Coccidioides
immitis, Phaeosphaeria nodorum, Uncinocarpus reesii), as
well as the basidiomycetes (Ustilago maydis and Cryptococcus neoformans) did not reveal any putative ETP gene clusters in these taxa.
The putative ETP clusters typically occurred in different
genomic locations in each lineage analysed. For instance,
even between closely related fungi such as N. fischeri and
A. fumigatus where within the larger cluster gene order was
otherwise identical and sequence was extremely similar,
the genes flanking these clusters were different.
Most ETP clusters have a single origin
In order to infer phylogenies of the ETP cluster components, the deduced amino acid sequences for all the common cluster genes, except the transporter (A) and the
transcriptional regulator (Z), were aligned with homologues throughout the ascomycetes as well as from the
basidiomycetes U. maydis and C. neoformans as outgroup
taxa. Six of these proteins contained sufficient alignable
characters for phylogenetic analysis. These were the twomodule non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (P), cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (C), glutathione S-transferase (G), amino cyclopropane carboxylate synthase (I),
dipeptidase (J), and methyl transferase (M). Of these six
genes, the class with the largest number of paralogues in
the genome was cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. These
genes have varying degrees of sequence similarity to each
other and are involved in a myriad of cellular functions
[15]. For each of the six proteins a preliminary phylogeny
was constructed from large alignments containing all
available homologues. Based on this analysis, proteins
encoded by the more distally related genes to the cluster
genes were excluded, allowing the use of a larger character
inclusion set for each subsequent analysis.

For each of the six protein phylogenies the majority of the
cluster proteins formed a well-supported clade (ML bootstraps for cluster clades were: P, 92; C, 95; G, 100; I, 78; J,
67; M, 100) to the exclusion of the non-cluster paralogues
(Fig. 3). The size of the character inclusion sets used differed for each protein (see methods), the largest being
from the peptide synthetase, P, which accordingly gave

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/174

the most robust topology through this phylogeny. However, the phylogenetic relationships based on each of the
six proteins were consistent, broadly supporting the
monophyly of cluster genes. The only exceptions were
firstly the cluster genes from G. zeae (P and I) and C. globosum (P); and secondly the J proteins from A. clavatus, A.
flavus and A. oryzae; all of which nested within the noncluster paralogues.
For the bimodular non-ribosomal peptide synthetases
(P), only the most closely related paralogues of this protein that did not compromise the inclusion set were analysed. The predicted protein sequence was split into the
two modules (1 and 2), and all individual modules were
aligned, with the exception of module 1 of proteins
encoded in the clusters in A. flavus, A. oryzae, A. terreus and
M. grisea, which were unusually divergent in these taxa.
Within the strongly supported cluster clade of P modules,
module 1 formed its own subclade, as did module 2.
Moreover, modules 1 and 2 were firmly supported as one
another's sister clades.
A few proteins not encoded by genes in clusters grouped
within the cluster clade: for instance, a C from P. nodorum
and an I from Ajell. capsulatus. These two fungi have fully
sequenced genomes and have no ETP-like gene clusters.
Glutathione S-transferases (G) in Epicoccum nigrum and
Alternaria alternata also grouped within the cluster clade.
Also a divergent I from N. crassa, a taxon that has no ETPlike clusters, was on a long branch within the cluster clade.
The position of this protein may be an artefact, however,
tests for long-branch attraction were inconclusive (data
not shown). Regardless, removal of this sequence did not
affect the topology of the cluster clade nor decrease support for it. In addition to genes from taxa without ETP-like
gene clusters, some taxa with clusters contained non-cluster paralogues grouping within the cluster clade. These
included a non-cluster cytochrome P450 monooxygenase
(C) from A. flavus and N. fischeri, and a non-cluster P from
T. reesei (Fig. 3).
Gene clusters have consistent patterns of inheritance
In addition to cluster genes consistently grouping together
in phylogenies, in most cases the relationships within the
cluster clade were also consistent for the six individual
proteins. The internal topology of the cluster clade generally resolved four subclades â I (orange), II (pink), IIIA
(light green), IIIB (dark green) (Fig 3).

Subclade I (orange) included proteins from M. grisea, A.
terreus, A. flavus, A. oryzae and A. clavatus. Support for this
subclade was strong for all proteins (ML bootstraps were
100, 98, 100, 92, 92 for P (module 2), C, G, I and M,
respectively) except for J (see below). In the phylogeny
based on C, the three non-cluster paralogues from P. nodo-

rum, A. flavus and N. fischeri also grouped within subclade
I.
Subclade II (pink) included proteins from T. reesei, P. lilacinoechinulatum, A. fumigatus and N. fischeri. This subclade
resolved with strong support for P (both modules), C and
I, (ML 100, 90, 100 in Figs. 3a, b and 3d, respectively). In
the phylogenies inferred by G, J and M, the position of T.
reesei was unresolved, most likely due to the small sizes of
the inclusion sets derived from these relatively small proteins. The inclusion of more taxa might provide more resolution to these relationships. Subclades I and II were
recovered as sisters with good support by four of the proteins (ML 97, 92, 94, 91 in P, C, J and M respectively). In
the other two phylogenies (of G and I) the internal
branches of the cluster clade were unresolved.
Two further cluster subclades were designated IIIA (light
green) and IIIB (dark green). Subclade IIIA included proteins encoded in the L. maculans sirodesmin PL cluster [3],
as well as the T. virens cluster. Additionally, two genomic
fragments (encoding I and G) from S. diversum also
grouped in this cluster type. The fragments of P for this
species were too short to be included in the phylogenetic
analysis, however, their nucleotide sequences had a high
degree of similarity to that of the L. maculans P (data not
shown). The support for this subclade is relatively weak
especially where the S. diversum gene fragments, which are
all short, are included. Full-length sequences and better
representation is needed for resolution of the position of
this subclade. Nevertheless, the relationship of the cluster
in the sordariomycete T. virens to that in the sirodesminproducing dothideomycetes is consistent throughout the
phylogenies (Fig. 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/174

bles much greater resolution than that for each protein
alone (Fig. 4). Only support for subclade IIIA was weak.
Approximate unbiased tests of alternate tree-topologies
rejected (p < 0.003 in all cases) any tree that broke the
monophyly of subclade I (orange), subclade II (pink) or
subclade IIIB (dark green) (Fig 4). Further, trees where
subclades I and II were not sisters were also rejected. This
analysis strongly supports the occurrence of distinct cluster subclades, and that subclade I and II are most closely
related. It also indicates that the monophyly of cluster IIIA
and the relatedness of clusters IIIA and IIIB is uncertain.
The distribution of ETP clusters is discontinuous
To compare the relationships of the cluster subclades to
the organismal phylogenies of the ascomycete taxa where
they occur, phylogenetic analyses using 18S ribosomal
DNA as well as using the deduced amino acid sequence of
heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and beta-tubulin were performed. All three relationships were consistent and the
phylogeny inferred from 18S ribosomal DNA sequences is
shown in Fig. 5. The positions of taxa are also consistent
with those previously reported [16]. When the presence of
gene clusters was superimposed onto this organismal phylogeny, and the subclade identity indicated by colour, two

Subclade IIIB (dark green) consisted of proteins from the
second smaller cluster (cluster #2) of A. fumigatus, N.
fischeri and A. terreus (Fig. 2). These proteins were all
highly similar, forming a very robust subclade (Figs. 3a, b
and 3f). Although only three proteins from these clusters
could be analysed, in all cases subclade IIIB is allied to
subclade IIIA with weak to moderate support, with greatest support seen in the P phylogeny (Fig. 3).
The relationships of the clusters were further tested by
analysis of concatenated protein sequences. With the
exception of J from A. flavus, A. clavatus and A. oryzae (Fig.
3e) and those encoded by G. zeae and C. globosum (blue
branches in Fig. 3), the proteins encoded in the clusters
show a common origin from a single ancestral cluster.
Hence, these clusters can be considered homologous, and
thus only these proteins were concatenated to form a
'super-matrix'. The maximum likelihood phylogeny
inferred from this dataset was strongly supported at
almost all nodes, indicating that this larger data set ena-

points were obvious â firstly, the distribution of clusters in
ascomycetes is discontinuous; and secondly, the relationship of cluster subclades does not always reflect the relationship of organisms (Fig. 5).
For some closely related species, one taxon had a cluster
whilst the other taxon did not. Of two closely related
dothideomycetes, L. maculans contains the sirodesmin PL
cluster, whilst P. nodorum has no ETP-like clusters. Similarly, although several Aspergilli species have ETP-like clusters, A. nidulans does not (Fig. 5). The sordariomycete C.
globosum has a cluster with three of the common genes,
but the closely related species, N. crassa does not; indeed
this latter fungus has very few secondary metabolite gene
clusters [17].

The different subclades of ETP-like clusters were dispersed
amongst the ascomycetes examined and did not simply
correspond to taxonomic affinities (Fig. 5). The well-characterised Aspergillus genus in the eurotiomycete class contained a cluster from either subclade I or II, as well as a
cluster from subclade IIIB. In three sordariomycete taxa,
each had a different type of cluster (from subclade I, II or
IIIA). Where some fungi had more than one cluster, these
clusters did not occur in the same subclade. For instance
A. terreus had a cluster with nearly all the common genes
that grouped in subclade I and a second, smaller cluster
(#2) that grouped in subclade IIIB. This second cluster was
not found in the other species with subclade I clusters (A.
flavus, A. oryzae and A. clavatus), however, it was present in
N. fischeri and A. fumigatus, species that contained another
cluster grouping in subclade II. Only one type of cluster

(subclade IIIA) was characterised in the dothideomycetes
(in L. maculans). However, the only genome sequence
available for taxa of this class is that of P. nodorum.
Synteny of genes within some clusters is conserved
The order and orientation of some genes within each cluster type was conserved. For example in the cluster from
subclade I (orange) the order and orientation of M, G, C,
J and P was conserved in A. flavus, A. oryzae and A. clavatus.
Even the order of M, G and C in the more distantly related
M. grisea was conserved, whereas in A. terreus, the order of
these genes was not (Fig. 5). Similarly, the order of genes
in the cluster from subclade II (pink) was conserved
within the eurotiomycetes between A. fumigatus (gliotoxin
gene cluster) and N. fischeri and for five genes in P. lilacinoechinulatum. However, of the cluster genes in subclade II
basal member, T. reesei, only the order and relative direction of transcription of P and C were conserved. Amongst
subclade IIIB, all clusters showed conserved gene synteny.
Only two taxa, L. maculans and T. virens contained a cluster in IIIA subclade and gene order was not conserved in
them.
Gene replacement within clusters
In two cases, genes with similar putative function but different evolutionary origin were present in different clusters. For instance, each cluster had either an ABC
transporter or a MFS transporter (Fig. 2). The gliotoxin
gene cluster in A. fumigatus had a MFS transporter, as did
clusters (also in subclade II) in N. fischeri and P. lilacinoechinulatum. However, the cluster in T. reesei, which is
closely related and also in subclade II, had an ABC transporter. Similarly the sirodesmin PL cluster in L. maculans
contained an ABC transporter, but the related subclade
IIIA cluster in T. virens encoded an MFS transporter
instead (Fig. 2). A second example of gene replacement is
found with the dipeptidase (J) in the subclade I. This protein in A. flavus, A. oryzae and A. clavatus neither grouped
with other subclade I proteins, nor even within the cluster
clade, but rather with non-cluster paralogues from related
Aspergillus spp. (Fig. 3).

Discussion
ETP clusters and their potential secondary metabolite
products
This study has significantly expanded our knowledge of
the distribution and composition of gene clusters resembling those known to synthesis ETP toxins. Clusters with
most or all of the ten genes common to ETP clusters in L.
maculans and A. fumigatus have been identified in nine
additional ascomycete taxa. Also clusters comprising
smaller numbers of these common genes along with other
genes putatively involved in secondary metabolism have
been identified, in some cases in taxa that contain complete ETP-like clusters. However, correlating these data

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/174

with known ETP production is very challenging. Since
only one ETP-like cluster with all genes predicted to be
essential for gliotoxin production is present in two gliotoxin-producing fungi, A. terreus and A. flavus, this cluster
is likely to be responsible for gliotoxin production. Interestingly these clusters belong to a different subclade to
that responsible for gliotoxin production in A. fumigatus.
Aspergillus orzyae, a fungus extensively used in the food
industry and considered atoxigenic, has a cluster with
extremely similar sequence and identical gene order to
that of the putative gliotoxin gene cluster from A. flavus.
However, this taxon is not known to produce gliotoxin,
nor does it produce aflatoxins, despite an aflatoxin gene
cluster [18]. Thus the presence of such secondary metabolite gene clusters does not always correlate with metabolite production. Neosartorya fischeri, which is also not
reported to make any ETPs has a cluster with extremely
similar sequence and identical gene order to that of the
gliotoxin gene cluster from A. fumigatus. Until functional
analyses are carried out with genes in all these clusters, the
products (if any) of such clusters can only be speculated
about. Functional (gene deletion) analyses have been carried out with the peptide synthetase in the ETP-like cluster
in an isolate of T. virens that produces high levels of gliotoxin. The resultant mutant still produces gliotoxin indicating that this cluster is not responsible for gliotoxin
production. The product (if any) of this cluster is
unknown (Charles Kenerley, unpublished).
Assembly and heredity of ascomycete ETP gene clusters
The monophyly of most of the cluster genes, and the fact
that the closest relatives of the cluster genes clades are paralogues throughout the filamentous fungi, suggest that
the cluster originated by recruitment of dispersed genes in
the ascomycete genome. Given that most cluster genes
represent genes for biochemical activities in multiple cellular processes, it is unsurprising that novel secondary
metabolite pathways might have assembled from gene
duplicates. This process of gene recruitment is reflected by
with the replacement of the dipeptidase J by a non-cluster
paralogue in the related taxa A. flavus, A. oryzae and A. clavatus. Such recruitment may also have occurred in the subclade IIIB clusters, where A. fumigatus and N. fischeri
clusters contain a gene (with a FAD binding domain) that
does not occur in the A. terreus IIIB cluster. This process
most likely also accounts for the different types of transporters in the gene clusters. Amongst the clusters analysed
in this study, only those from G. zeae and C. globosum are
apparently derived independently.

The phylogeny of the modules of the peptide synthetase
indicates that an early duplication of the ancestral gene
occurred after the formation of the cluster, but prior to its
dispersal in ascomycete lineages. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies on peptide synthetases in

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:174

Aspergillus species [19]. Thus this character provides further support for the single heritage of cluster genes. Moreover, the consistent pattern of subclade relationships
across the six cluster genes tested provides further evidence that the clusters have been inherited relatively
intact, in several cases even with conserved gene synteny,
although some changes to both gene content and gene
order have since occurred. The few examples of non-cluster genes grouping within the cluster clades (e.g. peptide
synthetase (P) from T. reesei; cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (C) from A. flavus and N. fischeri) may indicate relics of former clusters or cluster duplicates in these taxa
that have since disassembled.
A similar mechanism of gene cluster assembly has been
proposed for other secondary metabolite pathways in
ascomycete fungi. Gene duplication, recruitment and
then purifying selection has been proposed for the evolution of the aflatoxin and sterigmatocystin toxin gene clusters in the Aspergillus species [20]. These clusters contain
about 25 genes, and evidence supporting gene duplication includes the presence of multiple gene homologues
even in the same cluster. Recruitment of dispersed genes is
also proposed for the evolution of a gene cluster involved
in degradation of a nitrogen-containing molecule, allantoin (DAL) in S. cerevisiae [21].
A disjunct presence-absence distribution of secondary
metabolite gene clusters, similar to that observed for the
ETP clusters, has also been observed for other clusters in
filamentous fungi. The dothidiomycete Dothistroma septosporum, has several linked genes with strong similarity to
genes in the sterigmatocystin and aflatoxin gene clusters
of the distantly related Aspergillus genus (eurotiomycetes).
These D. septosporum genes encode enzymes that catalyse
biosynthesis of a toxin, dothistromin, which has a similar
structure to an intermediate in sterigmatocystin and aflatoxin biosynthesis [22].
Several theories have been proposed to account for the
discontinuous distribution of gene clusters in fungi. Kroken et al. [23] have analysed the evolution of sequences
for Type 1 polyketide synthetases, multifunctional
enzymes that add two carbon molecules at a time to produce polyketides. Some polyketides are virulence factors
in plant pathogens, or pigments such as melanin.
Sequence analysis from a wide range of ascomycetes
revealed eight polyketide synthase clades with discontinuous distributions. The authors proposed that this distribution can be best explained by gene duplication,
divergence and gene loss, rather than by horizontal or lateral gene transfer. However, horizontal gene transfer has
been postulated for the origin of the pea pathogenicity
(PEP) gene cluster in the ascomycete, Nectria haematococca
MPVI. Some genes in this cluster are involved in detoxify-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/174

ing a plant phytoalexin, pisatin [24]. This cluster is on a
dispensable chromosome and comprises genes with no
paralogues elsewhere in the genome and with a different
G+C content and codon usage to flanking regions and to
other chromosomes. This PEP cluster is present in the
related Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.pisi, but is not in fungi
that are closely related to N. haematococca MPVI, except for
N. boniensis [24].
Not only are ETP-like clusters dispersed amongst some
classes of ascomycetes and not others, but the phylogenetic affinities of the clusters are inconsistent with the
phylogenetic affinities of their host organisms. Subclade
IIIA is present in the sordariomycete, T. virens, and also in
the dothidiomycete, L. maculans, but not in P. nodorum,
which is the only the dothidiomycete whose complete
genome sequence information is available. The eurotiomycetes, particularly the well-characterised Aspergillus species, contained two related types of clusters (subclades I
and II) as well as the smaller cluster (subclade IIIB), which
was related to the sirodesmin PL gene cluster. The sordariomycetes contained taxa with one of each of the clusters
(subclades I, II and IIIA).
In view of the distribution, as well as the phylogenetic
affinities of putative ETP clusters, two patterns of inheritance can be considered: 1) vertical inheritance and cluster
loss alone; or 2) lateral transfer, vertical inheritance and
cluster loss. From the phylogeny inferred by 18S rDNA,
where nodes for which support is poor (less than 70 bootstraps) are collapsed, two possible patterns of inheritance
can be mapped through filamentous fungi. With
increased sampling and phylogenetic resolution the predicted number of losses will vary. However, with the current level of resolution and sampling, inheritance of
clusters by vertical inheritance alone suggests that following cluster assembly in an ancestor of filamentous fungi,
this cluster duplicated at least twice; once to generate subclade III (A and B), and then once more to give the sister
subclades I and II (Fig. 6a). These multiple paralogous
clusters must have all been inherited throughout ascomycetes, and multiple instances of cluster loss then
ensued, some species losing all clusters and others retaining one or two different types. In this scenario, the most
conservative estimate of minimal independent cluster loss
events is 17 (using only taxa with greater than X4
sequence coverage, and phylogenetic relationships supported above a bootstrap cut-off of 70). However, with
further sampling the predicted number of losses (shown
as circles in Fig. 6a) is likely to be much higher. Some of
these losses must also have occurred very recently within
multiple closely related groups that now contain different
cluster subclades (i.e. Aspergillus spp.). This scenario does
not account for why some clusters have diverged relatively
little despite presumably being inherited from the ances-

Figure patterns of inheritance and loss of ETP-like clusters in ascomycetes
Possible6
Possible patterns of inheritance and loss of ETP-like clusters in ascomycetes. Possible patterns of cluster inheritance
and loss are mapped onto a conservative ascomycete phylogeny based on the 18S rDNA phylogeny (Fig. 5) with poorly supported nodes (<70 bootstraps) collapsed. Only taxa known to contain ETP clusters, or for which there is greater than X4
genomic sequence coverage are included to avoid falsely designating cluster loss events. Rectangles show presence and subclade type of cluster in a lineage (colours are as Fig. 3, black and grey indicate ancestral clusters). Circles indicate lineage-specific
cluster loss events, where colours indicates subclade type loss, black indicates loss of all clusters, and open circle indicates loss
of a cluster of unknown subclade type. Two possible scenarios are compared: (a) vertical inheritance only with the minimal
number (17) of cluster losses; and (b) cluster divergence and spread by lateral transfer (arrows).

tor of ascomycetes. Additionally, although the number of
taxa sampled to date is relatively few, no taxa with all
major subclades have been found, even though three of
these clades are all represented within a single genus
(Aspergillus).
The second hypothesis is that following cluster assembly,
these gene clusters diverged over time as ascomycetes
diversified, creating the subclade relationships now
observed (Fig. 6b). Later, entire gene clusters moved by
horizontal gene transfer between ascomycete lineages,
producing the discontinuous distribution and phylogenetic relationships seen in the proteins encoded by the six
common genes tested here. This would imply multiple (at
least three) instances of horizontal gene transfer. This scenario also includes cluster loss events, however, based on
the conservative analysis as used for the first scenario with
the same taxa, only five loss events are inferred (Fig 6b, circles). Combined with three independent lateral gene
transfers, this second scenario provides a more parsimonious explanation of the data, although it still indicates a
very complex pattern of gene cluster evolution in ascomycetes.

Conclusion
Our results suggest that the epipolythiodioxopiperazines
(ETP)-like gene clusters identified to date have a common
origin, and have been inherited across ascomycetes relatively intact, rather than assembling independently in the
different ascomycete lineages. The clusters in Chaetomium
globosum and Gibberella zeae are exceptions, having apparently assembled independently, but their component
genes are substantially different to those of the other clusters, and indeed these putative clusters may be implicated
in some other metabolic function. The clade of putative
ETP clusters is comprised of a small number of distinct
subclades, which do not appear to always specify the particular toxins made, indicating ongoing refinement of the
metabolic function of ETP clusters. Moreover, these clusters are represented in a discontinuous pattern across
ascomycetes, and the phylogeny of the subclades does not
reflect that of ascomycetes in which they occur. Although
a mechanism describing this complex heredity cannot be
conclusively identified, movement of entire clusters by
horizontal gene transfer is the more parsimonious of
these hypotheses to explain the discontinuous distribution of cluster types. The ability of fungi to transfer gene
clusters that encode toxins or virulence factors presents
important and novel implications, particularly for those
fungi that are plant and animal pathogens.

Methods
Identification of ETP like clusters in genomes of
filamentous fungi
Complete genome sequences for a range of ascomycetes
and two basidiomycetes were downloaded from databases [see Additional file 1]. The presence of linked genes
was sought by sequence similarity searches with genes in
the sirodesmin PL and the gliotoxin gene clusters of L.
maculans and A. fumigatus, respectively.
Cloning and sequencing of ETP-like genes from
Sirodesmium diversum
Fragments of D, G, I, P (module 1) and T were amplified
from genomic DNA and cDNA of S. diversum using PCR
with degenerate primers [see Additional file 2]. Primers
were designed from multiple alignments of the genes of
interest generated with ClustalW using the CODEHOP
web interface [25]. Primers for the first module (mod 1)
of P were chosen in regions conserved only between sirP
(from L. maculans) and gliP (from A. fumigatus) and not
other fungal peptide synthetase genes. The fragment for
the second module (mod 2) was amplified with primers
designed using the L. maculans genomic sequence. PCR
amplification was carried out with 100 ng of genomic
DNA and Invitrogen buffer, 4 mM MgCl2, 100 pmol each
primer, 2.5 mM dNTPs and 1 U Invitrogen Taq polymerase. Annealing was at 94Â°C for 5 min followed by 5 cycles
of Touchdown PCR (94Â°C for 15 sec, 60Â°C â 56Â°C for 15
sec,72Â°C for 90 sec) then 30 cycles (94Â°C for 15 sec, 55Â°C
for 15 sec, 72Â°C for 90 sec) followed by 6 min at 72Â°C.
Products were sequenced and outward facing primers
designed and used in PCR amplification to join fragments
of two sets of adjacent genes (T and D; G and P).
Cloning and sequencing of ETP-like gene clusters from
Trichoderma virens and from Penicillium
lilacinoechinulatum
An isolate of a Penicillium species that producedgliotoxin
was obtained from Dr Paul Waring, Australia. This isolate
was originally named P. terlikowskii [11] but later identified and denoted as Penicillium lilacinoechinulatum Abe ex
G. Smith (labstrain IBT 28164). This subsequent identification by Dr Jens Frisvad, Technical University of Denmark was on the basis of culture ex type, both
micromorphologically, macromorphologically, physiologically and by its secondary metabolite patterns. A cosmid library of a gliotoxin-producing strain of T. virens
(isolate G20-4VIB) was constructed in vector pMOCOSX
and a cosmid library of Penicillium lilacinoechinulatum was
constructed in the pWEB vector (Epicentre, USA). These
libraries was probed with a 240 bp fragment amplified
from genomic DNA of T. virens isolate G20-4VIB, and P.
lilacinoechinulatum, respectively, using PCR and degenerate primers [see Additional file 2] designed from the I
gene from A. fumigatus and L. maculans. Conditions for

amplification were those used with the S. diversum gene
fragments and intergenic regions.
Three different cosmids from the T. virens library hybridised; sequencing showed only one had genes expected to
be in an ETP gene cluster (including the I homologue).
One cosmid in the P. lilacinoechinulatum library hybridised to this probe. Preliminary sequence analysis showed
that this cosmid had genes with best matches to P, C and
I. These cosmids (30 kb inserts) were sequenced (X 2 coverage) by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea). Genes were predicted using FGENESH [26] and predictions were
confirmed with blastP searches. Of 14 genes predicted on
the T. virens cosmid, 12 had good matches to genes in the
L. maculans sirodesmin PL, and in the A. fumigatus gliotoxin biosynthetic gene clusters. On the 3' end of the cosmid, two genes with no sequence similarity to genes in
ETP gene clusters were detected. The gene at the 5' end was
a homologue of thetranscriptional regulator, Z, from A.
fumigatus. Sequences were not available adjacent to this
gene. Of 14 genes predicted on the P. lilacinoechinulatum
cosmid, ten had good matches to genes on the sirodesmin
PL and on the A. fumigatus gliotoxin gene clusters. These
ten genes were flanked on the 3' end by a gene with no
sequence similarity to genes in ETP clusters, and by three
such genes at the 5' end, indicating that the cosmid contained a complete putative ETP gene cluster. The
sequences of these two clusters are deposited in GenBank
as accession EF429246 for T. virens and accession
EF429247 for P. lilacinoechinulatum.
Phylogenetic analyses of cluster genes
Sequences for eight of the ten common ETP cluster genes
were obtained from GenBank, from the individual
genome projects, and from the sequences of the clusters in
T. virens, S. diversum and P. lilacinoechinulatum. These
genes were non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (P), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (C), glutathione S-transferase (G), ACCS (I), dipeptidase (J), methyl transferases
(M and N), thioredoxin reductase (T). Sequences of the
closest paralogues within the filamentous fungi and the
closest orthologues from non-fungal taxa were also
obtained. Paralogues were identified by BLAST from the
genome projects and those paralogues that did not compromise the inclusion set of the cluster proteins, and
therefore showed close relationships were analysed. Additionally sequences were collated for 18S ribosomal DNA,
hsp-70 and beta-tubulin for all the fungi. Predicted protein alignments for protein-encoding genes were constructed using Clustal X [27] and refined in MacClade
(Sinauer Associates, MA. USA). Alignments are available
on request. Manual examination and BLAST results clearly
indicated that non-fungal orthologues were much more
distantly related and these were removed from the alignments to allow a greater character inclusion set for subse-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/174

quent analyses. The alignments of T and N offered poor
phylogenetic signal and accordingly the results were not
analysed. After exclusion of characters that could not be
aligned unambiguously, the matrix sizes (taxa Ã characters) for the individual protein analyses were I = 38 Ã 308;
J = 30 Ã 276; M = 29 Ã 234; P = 36 Ã 306; C = 20 Ã 260; G
= 36 Ã 133; Hsp 70 = 19 Ã 582; beta-tubulin = 23 Ã 362.
The concatenated protein dataset combined these exclusion sets for the 13 cluster-containing taxa.
Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were inferred
using PhyML [28] with the Dayoff substitution matrix,
eight categories of substitution rates. The alpha value and
number of invariable sites were calculated from the datasets. The values obtained were I, a = 1.72, i = 0.0; J, a =
0.84, i = 0.0; M, a = 2.35, i = 0.01; P, a = 2.19, i = 0.06; C,
a = 1.97, i = 0.02; G, a = 2.18, i = 0.0; hsp70, a = 0.28, i =
0.0; beta-tubulin; a = 0.3, i = 0.0. For distance analyses,
gamma-corrected distances were calculated by TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 using the WAG substitution matrix with eight variable rate categories and invariable sites. Trees were
inferred by weighted neighbor-joining using WEIGHBOR
[29]. Bootstrap resampling was carried out using PUZZLEBOOT [30]. One hundred bootstrap trees were calculated
with PhyML with the same parameters as the maximum
likelihood tree but with four gamma corrections categories. Bootstraps were also calculated with WEIGHBOR.
Alternative topologies for the concatenated dataset were
tested using the Approximately Unbiased (AU) test [31].
Site likelihood values for test trees and 100 maximum
likelihood bootstrap trees were calculated using TREEPUZZLE 5.1 [32] and the parameters described above. AU
tests were preformed using CONSEL version 0 [31].
The 18S ribosomal DNA nucleotide alignment gave a
matrix size of 33 Ã 951. Maximum Likelihood phylogeny
and ML bootstraps for 100 replicates were inferred using
PhyML with the HKY method of substitution (transition/
transversion ratio = 4.18) and nine categories of substitution rates with alpha (0.28) and the number of invariable
sites (0.0) estimated from the dataset.
