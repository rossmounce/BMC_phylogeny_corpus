Abstract
Background: The development of a new cold-active β-D-galactosidases and microorganisms that
efficiently ferment lactose is of high biotechnological interest, particularly for lactose removal in
milk and dairy products at low temperatures and for cheese whey bioremediation processes with
simultaneous bio-ethanol production.
Results: In this article, we present a new β-D-galactosidase as a candidate to be applied in the
above mentioned biotechnological processes. The gene encoding this β-D-galactosidase has been
isolated from the genomic DNA library of Antarctic bacterium Arthrobacter sp. 32c, sequenced,
cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, purified and characterized. 27 mg of β-Dgalactosidase was purified from 1 L of culture with the use of an intracellular E. coli expression
system. The protein was also produced extracellularly by P. pastoris in high amounts giving
approximately 137 mg and 97 mg of purified enzyme from 1 L of P. pastoris culture for the AOX1
and a constitutive system, respectively. The enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity
by using either one step- or a fast two step- procedure including protein precipitation and affinity
chromatography. The enzyme was found to be active as a homotrimeric protein consisting of 695
amino acid residues in each monomer. Although, the maximum activity of the enzyme was
determined at pH 6.5 and 50°C, 60% of the maximum activity of the enzyme was determined at
25°C and 15% of the maximum activity was detected at 0°C.
Conclusion: The properties of Arthrobacter sp. 32cβ-D-galactosidase suggest that this enzyme
could be useful for low-cost, industrial conversion of lactose into galactose and glucose in milk
products and could be an interesting alternative for the production of ethanol from lactose-based
feedstock.

Background
Nowadays low-cost energy bio-industrial processes in biotechnology are highly desired. This has led to increased
interest in the production of cold adapted enzymes. One
class of such enzymes includes cold-adapted β-D-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23) that can find many applications in

industrial biotechnology. These enzymes are capable of
hydrolyzing 1,4-β-D-galactoside linkages and can sometimes catalyse the synthesis of oligosaccharides. The production
of
lactose-free
milk
and
synthetic
oligosaccharides like lactulose are only examples of this
cutting edge enzyme class application.

Currently, commercially available β-galactosidase preparations (e.g. Lactozym – Novo Nordisk, Maxilact – DSM
Food Specialties) applied for lactose hydrolysis contain
Kluyveromyces lactis β-galactosidase naturally intracellularly biosynthesized by K. lactis strains. This enzyme is
optimally active at approximately 50°C and displays low
activity at 20°C while an ideal enzyme for treating milk
should work well at 4–8°C. Besides, the latter enzyme
should be optimally active at pH 6.7–6.8 and cannot be
inhibited by sodium, calcium or glucose. Such β-galactosidases are still highly desired. Only several enzymes optimally hydrolyzing lactose at low temperatures have been
characterized till now [1-14], however, none of them have
been produced on the commercial scale. The β-galactosidases were obtained from different microbial sources,
including those from Arthrobacter sp. [1,2,7,8,12], Arthrobacter psychrolactophilus [9,13]Carnobacterium piscicola [3],
Planococcus sp. [4,14], Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis [5],
and Pseudoalteromonas sp. [10,11].
Additionally, in order to make progress in cheaper production of β-D-galactosidases of industrial interest, high
efficiency yeast expression systems must be taken into
consideration. On the other hand extracellular production must occur to allow easy and fast isolation of target
protein. There are several studies in literature related to
the extracellular production of the Aspergillus niger βgalactosidase by recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae
strains [15-19], although this enzyme is mainly interesting for lactose hydrolysis in acid whey, because of their
acidic pH optimum as well as their activity at elevated
temperatures. The S. cerevisiae expression system was also
used for the production of K. lactis β-D-galactosidase, the
protein of outstanding biotechnological interest in the
food industry but in this case the enzyme production was
not strictly extracellular. The β-galactosidase was released
into the culture medium after osmotic shock of the
recombinant S. cerevisiae osmotic-remedial thermosensitive-autolytic mutants [20,21]. To improve the secretion
of the K. lactis β-D-galactosidase, cytosolic in origin, the
hybrid protein from this enzyme and its A. niger homologue, that is naturally extracellular, was constructed. The
hybrid protein was active and secreted by recombinant K.
lactis strain, but the amount of extracellular enzyme still
remained low [22]. Yeast species especially designated for
the production of extracellular proteins are for example
Pichia pastoris or Hansenula polymorpha. There is only one
recently published example of an extracellular β-galactosidase production system using P. pastoris as a host, however, it concerns thermostable enzyme from
Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius [23].
S. cerevisiae is usually the first choice for industrial processes involving alcoholic fermentation but this yeast is
unable to metabolize lactose and, therefore, the lactose

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/151

consuming yeast, K. fragilis, has been used in most industrial plants producing ethanol from whey [24]. The engineering of S. cerevisiae for lactose utilization has been
addressed over the past 20 years by different strategies
[25]. However, most recombinant strains obtained displayed no ideal characteristics (such as slow growth,
genetic instability or problems derived from the use of
glucose/galactose mixtures) or were ineffective for ethanol
production [24,26,27]. There is only one published example of efficient ethanol production with a recombinant S.
cerevisiae strain expressing the LAC4 (β-galactosidase) and
LAC12 (lactose permease) genes of K. lactis [28]. Hence,
there is still a need for S. cerevisiae strains producing new
β-galactosidases which may appear to be an interesting
alternative for the production of ethanol from lactosebased feedstock.
In this respect, here we report on a new cold-adapted β-Dgalactosidase, isolated from psychrothrophic, Antarctic
Arthrobacter sp. 32c bacterium strain, that possesses low
molecular weight of 75.9 kDa of monomer and 195 kDa
of native protein. In addition, the presented enzyme is
active in the range of temperature 4–8°C that is suitable
for milk industry applications and can be produced extracellularly on a large scale using recombinant P. pastoris
strains cultivated either on methanol or glycerol (a cheap
by-product in biodiesel industry).

Results
Characterisation of 32c isolate
Many different colonies were isolated from the Antarctic
soil. One isolate, named 32c, that formed yellow colonies
was chosen for further study because of its ability to
hydrolyze X-Gal – the cromogenic analogue of lactose.
The cells were Gram-negative rods. The optimum growth
in LAS medium was observed between 25–27°C. No
growth occurred at 37°C. In order to determine the ability
of the selected isolate to utilize starch, milk, avicell or arabinose several plates with different substrates were prepared. It was observed that 32c strain produces enzymes
of industrial interest like α-amylase, proteases and has an
arabinose utilization pathway. In order to estimate the
phylogenetic position of the isolate, we cloned the amplified 16S rRNA gene into pCR-Blunt vector, determined its
sequence, and examined its phylogenetic relationships
(Fig. 1A). The obtained sequence was deposited at GenBank with the accession no. FJ609656. An analysis of the
sequence showed that it clustered with other organisms
isolated from cold environments, mainly belonging to
Arthrobacter species. The isolate formed a well-defined
cluster with A. oxidans (98.59% sequence identity) and A.
polychromogenes (97.86% sequence identity). Based on
16S rDNA similarity, physiological properties similar to
other Arthrobacter strains and its presence in the Antarctic
soil our isolate was classified as Arthrobacter sp. 32c.

Phylogenetic analysis of the Arthrobacter sp. 32c 16S rDNA sequence (A) and Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase gene sequence (B). Sequences were aligned using the sequence analysis softwares: ClustalX 1.5 b and Gene-Doc
2.1.000. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the PHYLIP COMPUTER PROGRAM PACKAGE, using the neighbourjoining method with genetic distances computed by using Kimura's 2-parameter mode. The scale bar indicates a genetic distance. The number shown next to each node indicates the percentage bootstrap value of 100 replicates.

Characterisation of the β-D-galactosidase gene
The psychrotrophic Arthrobacter sp. 32c chromosomal
library was prepared in E. coli TOP10F'. The plasmid
pBADmycHisA was used to construct the library, and
ampicillin-resistant transformants were selected and
screened for the ability to hydrolyze X-Gal. Several transformants out of approximately 5,000 were selected as blue
colonies on plates containing X-Gal. Restriction analysis
of plasmid inserts from these transformants indicated that
they had been derived from the same fragment of chromosomal DNA. Sequence data from the shortest construct, named pBADmycHisALibB32c, contained 5,099
bp insert with an open reading frame (2,085 bp) encoding
protein, which shares high homology to a β-D-galactosidase (NCBI Access No. FJ609657). The sequence of
Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase was analyzed and
found to encode a 694 amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 76.142 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.59.
The analysis of DNA sequence upstream the Arthrobacter
sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase gene with the promoter prediction tool (BPROM software, http://www.softberry.com)
revealed a potential promoter sequence with cttaca and
tacaat as -35 and -10 sequences, respectively. A putative

ribosomal binding site was apparent 8 bases before the
initiating methionine codon. The insert fragment and βD-galactosidase gene had a high G+C content, 67 mol%
and 66 mol%, respectively, which is typical of Arthrobacter
species.
A comparison of the Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase gene sequence with those from the NCBI database
showed that it was most closely related to the Arthrobacter
sp. FB24 gene (77.13% sequence identity) and to the A.
aurescens TC1 gene (71.8% sequence identity) (Fig. 1B).
The deduced amino acid sequence from Arthrobacter sp.
32c β-D-galactosidase gene was also used to compare with
other amino acid sequences deposited in the NCBI database. The Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase was found
to be a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 42 and
contained an A4 beta-galactosidase fold. The enzyme
shares 84% of identity and 91% of similarity to the
sequence of the Arthrobacter sp. FB24, 74% identity and
84% similarity to the sequence of the Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 and only 51% identity and 65% similarity to the
sequence of the Janibacter sp. HTCC2649 β-D-galactosidase.

Overexpression and purification of recombinant
Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase
In order to produce and investigate the biochemical properties of Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase, we constructed bacterial and yeast expression systems. The
recombinant arabinose-inducible pBAD-Myc-HisA-βgal32c plasmid was used for the expression of the Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase gene in E. coli LMG194/
plysN [29]. The highest enzyme biosynthesis yields were
achieved by adding arabinose to the final concentration of
0.02% w/w, at A600 0.5 and by further cultivation for 5 h.
After purification a single protein migrating near 70 kDa
was observed following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie
blue (Fig. 2A, lane 3). It was in good agreement with the
molecular mass deduced from the nucleotide sequence
(75.9 kDa). The applied overexpression system was quite
efficient, giving 27 mg (Table 1) of purified β-D-galactosidase from 1 L of induced culture. The relative molecular
mass of native enzyme estimated by gel filtration on a column of Superdex 200 HR 10/30, previously calibrated
with protein molecular mass standards, was 195,550 Da.
Hence, it is assumed that the purified Arthrobacter sp. 32c
β-D-galactosidase is probably a trimeric protein.

In the P. pastoris expression system the methanol induced
and constitutive biosynthesis variants for larger scale production of the enzyme were tested. By cloning the gene in
the form of translational fusion with the S. cerevisiae α-factor leader sequence under the control of either the methanol induced promoter AOX1 or under the constitutive
promoter GAP, pPICZαA-32cβ-gal and pGAPZαA-32cβgal recombinant expression plasmids were constructed. P.
pastoris GS115 strain was transformed with linearized
pPICZαA-32cβ-gal or pGAPZαA-32cβ-gal plasmids. The

obtained P. pastoris GS115 recombinant strains harbouring pGAPZαA-32cβ-gal or pPICZαA-32cβ-gal recombinant plasmids were used for extracellular production of
the Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase (Fig. 2B, lane 2
and Fig. 2C, lane 2). The applied overexpression systems
were efficient, giving approximately 137 and 97 mg (Table
1) of purified β-D-galactosidase (Fig. 2B and 2C, lanes 4)
from 1 L of induced culture for the AOX1 and constitutive
system, respectively. Noteworthy is the fact that all
attempts in extracellular expression of β-D-galactosidase
from Pseudoalteromonas sp.22b [10,11] previously
described by us did not succeed (data not shown). The
corresponded β-D-galactosidase is a tetramer composed
of 115 kDa subunits. All the amount of produced protein
with fused secretion signal was accumulated in the cells.
We also tried to produce the Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b βD-galactosidase in the form of fusion protein with other
secretion sequences: PHO5 and STA2. All attempts gave
negative results. It seems that molecular mass of desired
recombinant protein is limited for extracellular production by P. pastoris host.
Characterization of Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-Dgalactosidase
The temperature profiles of the hydrolytic activity of the
recombinant Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase
showed that the highest specific activity with ONPG was
at 50°C (155 U/mg). Lowering or raising temperature
from 50°C resulted in the reduction of β-D-galactosidaseactivity. Recombinant β-D-galactosidase exhibited 15% of
the maximum activity even at 0°C and approximately
60% at 25°C (Fig. 3). In order to determine the optimum
pH for recombinant β-D-galactosidase, we measured the
enzyme activity at various pH values (pH 4.5–9.5) at 0–
70°C, using ONPG as a substrate. β-D-galactosidase

exhibited maximum activity in pH 6.5 and over 90% of its
maximum activity in the pH range of 6.5–8.5 (Fig. 3).
To examine the possible metal ion requirements, the
enzyme preparation was treated with EDTA to remove
metal ions. No activity was lost during treatment with 100
mM EDTA after 2 h. The activity was not considerably
affected by metal ions (5 mM): Na+, K+, Mg2+, Co2+, Ca2+.
The enzyme activity was completely inhibited by Cu2+ or
Zn2+ (5 mM) and was strongly inhibited by Mn2+ (11%),
Fe2+(25%) and Ni2+ (38%) in comparison to the activity
of the enzyme in the absence of cations (100%) (Table 2).
The activity of the β-D-galactosidase was not considerably
affected by ditiothreitol, β-mercaptoethanol, and Lcysteine, whereas reduced glutathione almost completely
inactivated the enzyme (Table 3). The examination of the
ethanol influence on the Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidaseactivity with ONPG as the substrate shows that addition of ethanol up to 20% still slightly stimulates the
enzyme activity (Table 4). The relative enzyme activity
was increasing up to 120% in the presence of 8% v/v ethanol at pH 5.5.
A study of the substrate specificity of the Arthrobacter sp.
32c β-D-galactosidase was performed with the use of various chromogenic nitrophenyl analogues. The recombinant Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase displayed
four times higher level of activity with PNPG (p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) than with ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) as substrate. The activities

with PNPGlu (p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) and
ONPGlu (o-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) were significantly lower with only 1.4% and 0.5% of the activity
with ONPG, respectively.
In order to further characterize the biochemical properties
of the enzyme the highest specific activity kcat, the KM values and the catalysis efficiency kcat/KM in reaction with
ONPG and lactose were calculated. The highest observed
specific activity with ONPG was 212.4 s-1 at 50°C. The
half saturation coefficient (KM) was highest at 10°C (5.75
mM), decreased to 2.62 mM at 50°C and rose again to
5.11 mM at 55°C. The highest catalysis efficiency was
achieved at 50°C (81.7 s-1mM-1). The same kinetic parameters were also determined with lactose (Table 5). Hereby
the half saturation coefficient was significantly higher, the
reaction velocity constant was significantly lower and the
reaction efficiency was very low. To investigate the reason
for such results another test was performed, where glucose
was transformed in the reaction mixture by glucose isomerase that converted it to fructose, while galactose
remained in the mixture. In this test the reaction efficiency
was significantly higher and over 30% from the 5% w/v of
lactose was hydrolysed to glucose and galactose for 12
hours and over 75% of the lactose was found to be hydrolysed after 72 hours. These results were similar to another
test where the recombinant P. pastoris strain extracellularly
producing Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase (pGAPZαA-32cβ-gal) was cultivated on lactose containing broth.
It seems obvious that Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosi-

the enzyme might successfully catalyse the conversion of
lactose to corresponding monocarbohydrates in a fermentation broth where glucose is consumed by cells of the fermenting strain.

highly efficient P. pastoris expression systems for consideration to produce enzyme extracellularly. P. pastoris has
been successfully used many times in extracellular protein
production, however, there are only several examples of
cold-adapted proteins and none cold-adapted β-D-galactosidase produced by this host. We have found only one
published example of P. pastoris extracellular β-D-galactosidase production for a thermostable enzyme from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius [23].
There are several examples of cold active β-D-galactosidases isolated from Pseudoalteromonas strains [5,10,11]
and Arthrobacter strains [7-9,12,13] with molecular mass
above 110 kDa of monomer and forming an active
enzyme of over 300 kDa. Most of them belong to the family 42 β-D-galactosidases. However, the β-D-galactosidase
belonging to family 2 obtained from the Antarctic Arthrobacter isolate appears to be one of the most cold-active
enzymes characterized to date [8]. All of the known coldadapted β-D-galactosidases, except two of them isolated
from Planococcus sp. strains [4,14] and from Arthrobacter
sp. 32c (this study), form very large oligomers and therefore are of minor interest in industrial application proba-

bly because of many problems in effective overexpression.
The β-D-galactosidases isolated from psychrophilic Planococcus sp. strains have low molecular weight of about 75
kDa of monomer and about 155 kDa of native protein.
The β-D-galactosidase isolated from Planococcus sp. L4 is
particularly thermolabile, loosing its activity within only
10 min at 45°C [14] and therefore larger scale production
of this enzyme by recombinant yeast strains cultivated at
30°C might be economically not feasible. Only the β-Dgalactosidase from Planococcus sp. isolate SOS orange [4]
displays interesting activity and might be considered in
biotechnological production on a larger scale.
In comparison with known β-D-galactosidases, the Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase is a protein with a relatively low molecular weight. Molecular sieving revealed
that the active enzyme is a trimmer with a molecular
weight of approximately 195 ± 5 kDa. Relatively low
molecular weight of the protein did not interfere with
extracellular production of the protein by P. pastoris.
Therefore the constructed recombinant strains of P. pastoris may serve to produce the protein extracellularly with
high efficiency and in a cheap way. The calculated produc-

tion cost of 1 mg of purified β-D-galactosidase was estimated at 0.03 €.
The same Pichia pastoris expression systems had been
unsuccessfully used for extracellular expression of previously reported β-D-galactosidase from Pseudoalteromonas
sp. 22b [10,11]. This enzyme is much bigger than Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase and forms a tetramer of
approximately 490 kDa. It is worth noting that we have
tried to secrete this enzyme with three different secretion
signals (α-factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucoamylase STA2 from Saccharomyces diastaticus or phosphatase
PHO5 from S. cerevisiae) with no success. It seems that the
molecular mass of the desired recombinant protein is limited to extracellular production by P. pastoris host, whereas
the used secretion signal is without any influence. Based
on our experience with Pichia pastoris expression systems
we assert that the larger protein the lower expression yield
can be achieved.
In comparison with the known β-D-galactosidase from
Planococcus sp. isolate SOS orange [10], β-D-galactosidase
from Arthrobacter sp. 32c is more thermostable and it has
a similar activity profile. Moreover, as shown in this study,
it can be produced extracellularly in high amounts by
yeast strain. The displayed activity profile of the Arthrobacter β-D-galactosidase, especially the activity at pH
range from 5.5 to 7.5, over 50% of relative activity at 30°C
and enhancement of the activity by the presence of ethanol suggest that this enzyme is compatible with the industrial process conditions for ethanol production by yeast.
The construction of corresponding S. cerevisiae recombinant strains and fermentation tests for the production of
ethanol from cheese whey by the application of this β-Dgalactosidase are pending.
The Arthrobacter β-D-galactosidase was strongly inhibited
by glucose and therefore the catalysis efficiency was very
low. Removal of this product resulted in 75% hydrolysis
of a solution containing 5% of lactose after 72 hours in a
combined enzyme assay. These results clearly indicate that
the enzyme can be used for the production of sweet lactose free milk where hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and
galactose is performed by simultaneous isomerisation of
glucose to fructose by glucose isomerase.

Conclusion
In this study we present the purification and characterisation of a new β-D-galactosidase from Arthrobacter sp. 32c.
From the sequence analyses it is obvious that the protein
is a member of the family 42 β-D-galactosidases. The protein weight deduced from the 695 amino acid sequence
was 75.9 kDa. Molecular sieving revealed that the active
enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 195 ± 5
kDa and therefore it is probably a trimmer. The new char-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/151

acterised β-D-galactosidase is of industrial interest and
can be produced extracellularly in its economically feasible variant by the constructed P. pastoris strain.
The constructed P. pastoris strain may be used in co-fermentation of lactose from cheese whey by a consortium of
microorganisms with industrial strains of brewing yeast S.
cerevisiae, where the P. pastoris produces β-D-galactosidase
in the oxygen phase and accelerates the shift between the
oxidative and reductive conditions.

Methods
Isolation, characterisation and identification of the 32c
isolate
A 5 g of Antarctic soil was dissolved in 45 ml of water containing 1% of sea salt (Sigma-Aldrich). After decantation
100 μl of the supernatant was spread out on LAS agar
plates that contained 1% lactose, 0.1% pepton K, 0.1%
yeast extract, 1% of marine salt, 1.5% agar and 20 μg/ml
of X-gal. Pure cultures of microorganisms were isolated.
One of them was found to be a producer of β-D-galactosidase and also exhibited amylolytic and proteolytic activities. This strain was primarily classified as 32c isolate and
used for further analyses. The bacterium 32c was cultured
in the liquid LAS medium containing 1% lactose, 1% pepton K, 0.5% yeast extract and 1% artificial sea salt at 15°C
for 2 days at 150 rpm in air shaker. The temperature profile of growth was determined in the range 0–37°C, by
means of stationary cultures in the LAS medium.
16S rDNA gene amplification
Genomic DNA from isolate 32c was used as a template to
amplify 16S rDNA gene using primers: 16S For 5'
AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG 3' and 16S Rev 5' ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT 3'. Reaction was performed in
mixture containing: 0.2 μM of each primer, 0.2 μg of chromosomal DNA, 250 μM of each dNTP, 1 U of DNA
polymerase (Hypernova, DNA-Gdańsk, Poland) in 1 × PCR
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 10 mM KCl, 3.4 mM
MgCl2, 0.15% Triton X-100). The reaction mixture was
incubated for 3 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles at
95°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1.5 min, and a
final incubation for 5 min at 72°C using a Mastercycler
Gradient (Eppendorf, Germany). PCR product was purified from an agarose gel band using DNA Gel-Out kit
(A&A Biotechnology, Poland), and cloned directionally
into pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). The 16S rDNA insert
was sequenced using ABI 3730 xl/ABI 3700 sequencing
technology (Agowa DE, Germany).
Genomic DNA library construction
The chromosomal DNA from 32c strain cells was isolated
using a Genomic DNA Prep Kit (A&A Biotechnology,
Poland) according to protocol for Gram-negative bacteria.
The DNA was digested using the 20 U of SalI and 20 U of

BglII endonucleases (Fermentas, Lithuania) for 2 hours at
37°C in 1× buffer O+ (Fermentas), and 2- to 8-kb fragments were purified from a 0.8% agarose gel using the
DNA Gel Out kit (A&A Biotechnology, Poland). Then
DNA fragments were ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Epicentre, USA) for 1 h at 16°C into pBAD/Myc/HisA vector
(Invitrogen) pre-cutted with the same restriction enzymes.
E. coli TOP10F' cells were transformed to give the genomic
library by incubation at 37°C on LA agar (10 g pepton K,
5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl, and 15 g agar) containing 100
μg/ml ampicillin, 1 mM IPTG and 20 μg/ml X-gal. After
12 h incubation, plates were transferred to 20°C and incubated further for 16 h. Blue colonies were taken for analysis. These E. coli TOP10F' cells were transformed with
plasmid containing the Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-galactosidase gene. Plasmid DNA was extracted from these recombinant strains. The insert of the smallest recombinant
plasmid (pBADmycHisALibB32c) was sequenced using
ABI 3730 xl/ABI 3700 sequencing technology (Agowa DE,
Germany).

β-D-galactosidase gene amplification and cloning to
bacterial expression system
Based on the known β-D-galactosidase gene sequence of
Arthrobacter sp. 32c (GenBank Accession No. FJ609657),
the specific primers for PCR amplification were designed
and synthesized. The gene was amplified using two separate reactions. The first DNA fragment was amplified
using
the
forward
primer:
F1Nc-β-gal
CATGGGCAAGCGTTTTCCAAG, and reverse primer: R32c-βgal CCCCGTCGACTTTTCTAGATCAGTCCTCCGCGATCAC (containing SalI and XbaI recognition sites, underlined). The second DNA fragment was amplified using the
forward
primer:
F2Nc-β-gal
GGCAAGCGTTTTCCAAGCGG, and and reverse primer: R32c-β-gal
CCCCGTCGACTTTTCTAGATCAGTCCTCCGCGATCAC
(containing SalI recognition site, underlined). The start
and stop codons are given in bold. For the NcoI sticky end
generation the second forward F2Nc-β-gal primer contains only one nucleotide of the start codon. Each PCR
reaction mixture contained: 0.2 μM of each primer, 0.2 μg
of pBADmycHisALibB32c DNA, 250 μM of each dNTP, 1
U of DNA polymerase (Hypernova, DNA-Gdańsk, Poland)
in 1 × PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 10 mM KCl,
3.4 mM MgCl2, 0.15% Triton X-100). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 3 min at 95°C, followed by 5
cycles at 95°C for 1 min, 50°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min
and 25 cycles at 95°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min, 72°C for
2 min and a final incubation for 5 min at 72°C using a
Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Germany). Both
amplification reaction products were purified and mixed
together at ratio 1:1. This mixture was denaturated at
95°C for 3 min and cooled down to room temperature at
0.2°C/s. Afterwards DNA were purified by ethanol precipitation, digested with SalI endonuclease and cloned into

and SalI endonucleases. The resulting recombinant plasmid pBAD/Myc/HisA-β-gal32c containing the Arthrobacter

promoter was used to transform chemically competent E.

Expression of the recombinant β-D-galactosidase gene in
E. coli
The recombinant plasmid pBAD/Myc/HisA-32cβ-gal was
used for the expression of the putative β-D-galactosidase
gene in E. coli LMG 194 plysN under the control of pBAD
promoter. The cells were grown overnight at 37°C in LB
medium containing chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and
ampicillin (100 μg/ml) in air shaker at 220 rpm. The preculture was inoculated (1%) into fresh 1 liter of LB
medium containing the same antibiotics and cultivation
was continued at 37°C to OD600 of 0.5. The culture was
then supplemented with 0.02% (w/w) arabinose (final
concentrations) and grown for 4 h at 37°C to achieve the
overexpression of β-D-galactosidase gene.

(containing SalI and XbaI recognition sites, underlined)
(reaction A). The start and stop codons are given in bold.
The second PCR reaction was performed to obtain a linear

reaction mixture contained: 0.2 μM of each primer, 0.2 μg
of recombinant plasmid, 250 μM of each dNTP, 1 U of
DNA polymerase (Hypernova, DNA-Gdańsk, Poland) in 1
× PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 10 mM KCl, 3.4
mM MgCl2, 0.15% Triton X-100). Reaction A was performed using following conditions: 95°C – 3 min, (95°C
– 1 min, 53°C – 1 min, 72°C – 2 min; 5 cycles), (95°C –
1 min, 65°C – 1 min, 72°C – 2 min; 25 cycles), 72°C – 5
min. Reaction B and C were performed at conditions:
95°C – 3 min, (95°C – 1.5 min, 66°C – 1 min, 72°C – 4
min; 5 cycles), (95°C – 1.5 min, 68°C – 1 min, 72°C – 4
min; 25 cycles), 72°C – 10 min. The PCR products were
purified from an agarose gel bands using DNA Gel-Out kit
(A&A Biotechnology, Poland), digested with XbaI endonuclase and ethanol precipitated. The DNA fragments
from reaction A and B and from reaction A and C were
ligated with each other and chemically competent E. coli

μg/ml zeocine (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37°C for 16
h. Afterwards recombinant plasmids were isolated, linearized by SacI or XmaJI endonuclease and used to transform
P. pastoris GS115 competent cells using Pichia EasyComp™
Transformation Kit (Invitrogen). The obtained P. pastoris
GS115 recombinant strains harbouring pGAPZαA-32cβgal or pPICZαA-32cβ-gal recombinant plasmids were
used to extracellular production of the Arhrobacter sp. 32c
β-D-galactosidase.
Expression of the β-D-galactosidase gene in Pichia
pastoris
The P. pastoris GS115 recombinant strains harbouring
pGAPZαA-32cβ-gal or pPICZαA-32cβ-gal plasmid were
used to extracellular expression of the Arhrobacter sp. 32c
β-D-galactosidase either constitutively or after methanol
induction, respectively. For both expression systems 900
ml of YPG medium (Yeast extract 1%, Pepton K 2%, 2%
glycerol) was inoculated with 100 ml of YPG medium
cells cultures of the P. pastoris pGAPZαA-32cβ-gal or P.
pastoris pPICZαA-32cβ-gal. In case of the constitutive β-Dgalactosidase expression the inoculated culture was grown
with agitation at 30°C for 4 days. After 2 days additional
carbon source in form of glycerol was added to final concentration of 3% v/v to the broth. In case of the methanol
induced variant, 100 ml overnight culture of the P. pastoris
pPICZαA-32cβ-gal was centrifugated at 1500 × g for 10
min. The supernatant was discarded, cells were dissolved
in 100 ml of BMMY medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.004% L-histidine, 100 mM potassium phosphate,
pH 6.0, 1.34% YNB, 4 × 10-5% biotin, 0.5% methanol)
and added to 900 ml of the same medium. The cultivation
was performed for 4 days, where methanol was added to
final concentration of 0.65%, 0.8% and 1% after first, second and third day, respectively.

β-D-galactosidase purification
After protein expression in E. coli host, the cells were disrupted according to protocol described earlier with some
modifications [29]. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 5,000 × g for 20 min and the cell pellet was resuspended
in 30 ml of buffer A (20 mM K2HPO4-KH2PO4, pH 7.5)
and frozen at -20°C for 15 min. After thawing at room
temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g.
The supernatant containing the desired protein was
applied onto affnity matrix of agarose coupled with paminobenzyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (PABTG-agarose, Sigma) (10 ml column) equilibrated with four volumes of buffer A. The column was washed with 300 ml of
the buffer A, and the recombinant β-D-galactosidase was
eluted three times with 10 ml of 0.05 M sodium borate
(pH 10.0) buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Active fractions containing the β-D-galactosidase were collected and
dialyzed three times against 3 L of buffer D (100 mM
NH4HCO3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/151

In case of the purification of the extracellular produced βD-galactosidase in P. pastoris cultures, the yeast cells were
separated from the post-culture medium through centrifugation. Next, the ammonium sulphate was added to the
post-culture medium to 60% w/w, at 4°C. The precipitated proteins were centrifugated at 20,000 × g, dissolved
in buffer A and dialyzed overnight against the same
buffer. For β-D-galactosidase purification the dissolved
sample was applied further directly onto affnity matrix of
agarose coupled with p-aminobenzyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and purified as described above for bacterial
system. The concentration of purified protein was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.

β-D-galactosidase activity assays
The activity of purified Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase was determined by the use of chromogenic substrates
as described elsewhere [4,14]. The o-nitrophenol released
from 10 mM of o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside
(ONPG) by β-D-galactosidase at 0–70°C and pH range
4.5–9.5 (0.02 M citrate buffer for pH 4.5 and 5.5; 0.02 M
K2HPO4-KH2PO4 for pH 6.5 and 7.0 and 0.02 M Tris-HCl
for pH 8.5 and 9.5) was measured at 405 nm. The reaction
was stopped after 10 min with 1 M Na2CO3. One unit is
defined as one micromolar of o-nitrophenol released per
minute.
Substrate specificity was estimated using 1 mM solution
of chromogenic substrates: o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG), p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside
(PNPG),
o-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside
(ONPGlu)
and
p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside
(PNPGlu). Activity determination was carried out under
standard conditions in 0.02 M K2HPO4-KH2PO4 (pH 6.5)
buffer at 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50°C. The activity of the β-Dgalactosidase towards lactose was monitored by HPLC
analysis (column Bio-rad, Aminex HPX-87H) where 1%
solutions of lactose, glucose, fructose and galactose were
used as standards.
In the combined enzyme assay glucose isomerase from
Streptomyces murinus (Sigma G4166) was used in the
amount of 0.01 g/ml of 5% w/v solution of lactose (0.02
M K2HPO4-KH2PO4, pH 6.5). The Arthrobacter sp. 32c βD-galactosidase was used at concentration of 200 U/ml of
the mixture. The reaction mixture was set at 37°C for 72 h
and products were analysed by HPLC every 12 hours.
Effects of 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM of 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM of L-cysteine, 5 mM of reduced glutathione,
and metal ions (Na+, K+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Zn2+,
Cu2+, Co2+ and Ni2+; each at concentration of 5 mM) on
Arthrobacter sp. 32c β-D-galactosidase activity were determined under standard conditions.
