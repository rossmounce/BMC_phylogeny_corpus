Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic trees resulting from molecular phylogenetic analysis are available in
Newick format from specialized databases but when it comes to phylogenetic networks, which
provide an explicit representation of reticulate evolutionary events such as recombination,
hybridization or lateral gene transfer, the lack of a standard format for their representation has
hindered the publication of explicit phylogenetic networks in the specialized literature and their
incorporation in specialized databases. Two different proposals to represent phylogenetic
networks exist: as a single Newick string (where each hybrid node is splitted once for each parent)
or as a set of Newick strings (one for each hybrid node plus another one for the phylogenetic
network).
Results: The standard we advocate as extended Newick format describes a whole phylogenetic
network with k hybrid nodes as a single Newick string with k repeated nodes, and this
representation is unique once the phylogenetic network is drawn or the ordering among children
nodes is fixed. The extended Newick format facilitates phylogenetic data sharing and exchange, and
also allows for the practical use of phylogenetic networks in computer programs and scripts. This
standard has been recently agreed upon by a number of computational biologists, is already
supported by several phylogenetic tools, and avoids the different drawbacks of using an a priori
unknown number of Newick strings without any additional mark-up to represent a phylogenetic
network.
Conclusion: The adoption of the extended Newick format as a standard for the representation
of phylogenetic network is an important step towards the publication of explicit phylogenetic
networks in peer-reviewed journals and their incorporation in a future database of published
phylogenetic networks.

Background
Phylogenetic networks provide an explicit representation
of the evolutionary relationships among sequences,
genes, chromosomes, genomes, or species. They differ
from phylogenetic trees by the explicit modeling, by

means of hybrid nodes instead of only tree nodes, of reticulate evolutionary events such as recombination, hybridization, or lateral gene transfer, and differ also from the
implicit networks that allow for visualization and analysis
of incompatible phylogenetic signals [1]. Phylogenetic

networks have been extensively used in evolutionary studies, especially at the population level, where reticulate
evolutionary events are quite common [2].
Over the past two decades, plant and animal biologists
have been performing molecular phylogenetic analyses
and submitting phylogenetic trees and associated data
matrices to TreeBASE, a repository of phylogenetic trees
[3], and some journals either require or encourage authors
to submit their phylogenetic data to databases such as
TreeBASE [4,5]. Sharing phylogenetic data has been eased
by the multiple efforts to maintain such a database of
published phylogenetic trees, which already contains over
5,000 phylogenetic trees with about 100,000 taxa from
about 2,000 studies made by over 3,000 authors, but also
by the adoption of a standard format for representing phylogenetic trees, the Newick format.
The Newick format [6,7], adopted June 26, 1986 by an
informal committee meeting at Newick's seafood restaurant in Dover, New Hampshire, USA during the Society
for the Study of Evolution meeting in Durham, New
Hampshire, is the de facto standard for representing phylogenetic trees, and it is quite convenient since it makes it
possible to describe a whole phylogenetic tree in linear
form in a unique way, once the phylogenetic tree is drawn
or the ordering among children nodes is fixed. The Newick description of a phylogenetic tree is a string of nested
parentheses annotated with taxa names and possibly also
with branch lengths or bootstrap values, obtained by traversing the phylogenetic tree in postorder and following
some simple rules that allow for parsing a Newick string
into the corresponding phylogenetic tree, and vice versa.
In fact, almost every phylogenetic software tool includes
an option to export phylogenetic trees in Newick format,
and open-source code for parsing Newick strings is readily
available in a number of software toolkits, including for
instance BioPerl, BioPython, BioJava, and BioRuby.
When it comes to phylogenetic networks, however, there
is not yet, to the best of our knowledge, any effort to build
and maintain a database of published phylogenetic networks, nor do journals require or even encourage authors
to submit explicit phylogenetic networks as supplementary material. The adoption of a standard representation
for phylogenetic networks would certainly be an important first step towards reverting this situation. Every evolutionary biologist might certainly benefit from such a
standard, because of the importance of standards for sharing data [8,9], and every computational biologist might
also benefit as well, given the importance of standards for
tool development [10].
A first proposal of a compact representation for phylogenetic networks can be found in the NetGen package for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/532

phylogenetic networks [11], where a phylogenetic network with k hybrid nodes is represented as a single phylogenetic tree in Newick format but with k repeated nodes.
For example, the phylogenetic network with two hybrid
nodes of Figure 1 is transformed by replicating each
hybrid node as shown in Figure 2, and the resulting representation is the following Newick string:
• ((1, ((2, (3, (4)Y#H1)g)e, (((Y#H1, 5)h, 6)f)X#H2)c)a,
((X#H2, 7)d, 8)b)r;
The representation of a whole phylogenetic network as a
single string facilitates phylogenetic data sharing and
exchange, because the string can then be embedded in the
text of email messages, a collection of these strings can be
put together in a text file with one line for each string, etc.
It also facilitates the use phylogenetic networks in computer programs because in programming languages such as
C, C++ and Java, in scripting languages such as Perl and
Python, and in text processing languages such as awk, sed
and grep, for instance, the single string representing a phylogenetic network can be easily input to a program or
script through a command line interface or a graphical
user interface, or read as a single line from a text file.
A second proposal of a compact representation for phylogenetic networks can be found in the PhyloNet package for
phylogenetic trees and networks [12], where a phylogenetic network with k hybrid nodes is represented as a
series of k + 1 phylogenetic trees in Newick format. For
example, the phylogenetic network with two hybrid
nodes of Figure 1 is decomposed into three phylogenetic

trees as shown in Figure 3, and the resulting representation is the following series of Newick strings:

• ((1, ((2, (3, Y)g)e, X)c)a, ((X, 7)d, 8)b)r;
• (((Y, 5)h, 6)f)X;
• (4)Y;
In the actual representation used in [12], however, the
phylogenetic trees are represented by Newick strings
(without the final semicolon, without root node label,
and without any internal node labels) assigned either to
the whole phylogenetic network or to the hybrid node,
such as
• N = ((1, ((2, (3, Y)), X)), ((X, 7), 8))
• X = (((Y, 5), 6))
• Y = (4)

for the phylogenetic network with two hybrid nodes of
Figure 1.
In any case, the representation of a phylogenetic network
as a set of several strings makes it more difficult to share
and exchange phylogenetic data, however, because it

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:532

requires additional mark-up to properly keep the strings
of different phylogenetic networks apart, especially when
the strings of several phylogenetic networks are assembled
together in a text file. Even in the case of a single phylogenetic network, though, the number of strings comprising
the representation of the phylogenetic network is not
made explicit in the representation and thus, additional
mark-up is also needed in this case to indicate the end of
the series of Newick strings. This second proposal results
thus in a longer and more involved representation than
the first proposal, using k more strings and 2k more symbols to represent a phylogenetic network with k hybrid
nodes.
An additional drawback of this representation of a phylogenetic network as a set of several strings is the incomplete
modeling of lateral gene transfer events, where the distinction between the reticulate edge and the other edge coming into the hybrid node is lost. The representation of a
phylogenetic network is thus complemented in [12] with
an explicit list of the lateral gene transfer arrows. For
example, the lateral gene transfer event depicted in Figure
4 would be represented as follows.
• N = ((1, (2, H)), H)

tions by Gabriel Cardona, Daniel Huson, Monique
Morin, David Posada, and Gabriel Valiente.
The second proposal was discarded because of the practical issues of dealing with several Newick strings as the representation of a single phylogenetic network, and the first
proposal was adopted with a few minor improvements.
The agreed-upon standard was then included in the
Bio::PhyloNetwork package for phylogenetic networks in
Perl [13] and made available as part of the BioPerl bundle
[14]. The extended Newick format is described in detail in
the Results section.
Later on, however, the second proposal was claimed in
[15] to be the extended Newick format for phylogenetic
networks, although it was already discarded at the Current
Challenges and Problems in Phylogenetics workshop for
the reasons exposed above, and despite the fact that the
extended Newick format for phylogenetic networks was
already published [13]. This is, in our opinion, unfortunate for a series of reasons, the most important being that
the publication under the same name and in the same
journal of two standard formats for representing phylogenetic networks, will only add confusion and make it
harder for biologists to share phylogenetic network data.
This will be further addressed in the Discussion section.

• H = (3)

Recently, in an open session at the Current Challenges
and Problems in Phylogenetics workshop, held at the
Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cambridge, UK in September 2007, several computational
biologists gathered together and agreed upon an extended
Newick format as a standard for the representation for
phylogenetic networks. The meeting was followed by
extensive discussion by email, with important contribu-

Furthermore, there are a number of mistakes in the
description of the second proposal as published in [15].
First, the description of a network with < hybrid nodes is
defined as a set of < trees, but the description has < + 1
trees instead. Second, in the procedure for decomposing a
network into a set of trees, k new terminal nodes labeled
xi are created for each hybrid node ui with k parent nodes
Vi, the edges Vi × {ui} are removed and the edges Vi × {xi}
are added, but the latter is not well-defined because there
are multiple nodes labeled xi while these edges are to be
added from each parent in Vi to only one new terminal

node labeled xi. Third, the resulting set of trees is claimed
to have the same terminal nodes as the network, but this
is clearly false as new terminal nodes are introduced, multiple times indeed. Fourth, the resulting trees are also
claimed to have disjoint sets of terminal nodes but this is
also false, it does not even hold for the example in [[15],
Figure 3].

Results
The extended Newick format that we advocate as standard
makes it possible to describe a whole phylogenetic network in linear form in a unique way, once the phylogenetic network is drawn or the ordering among children
nodes is fixed. The extended Newick description of a phylogenetic network is a string of nested parentheses annotated with taxa names and possibly also with branch
lengths or bootstrap values, similar to the Newick description of a phylogenetic tree but with additional mandatory
tags to distinguish among the various hybrid nodes in the
phylogenetic network.
The extended Newick description of a phylogenetic network can be obtained by first transforming the phylogenetic network into a phylogenetic tree with some
replicated nodes, properly tagged according to the hybrid
nodes they replicate, and then traversing the resulting
phylogenetic tree in postorder as when obtaining the
Newick description of a phylogenetic tree [6].

hybrid node. This can be easily achieved by taking the target of the other edge as first replicate (the one that will
carry the children of the hybrid node in the phylogenetic
network) and the target of the reticulate edge as second
replicate (the one that will become a terminal node) when
splitting the hybrid node. For example, in the lateral gene
transfer event depicted in Figure 4, represented by the
extended Newick string ((1, (2, (3)h#LGT1)y)x,
h#LGT1)r;, the reticulate edge y → h makes the second
copy of hybrid node h become a terminal node.
Conversely, given an extended Newick string, the corresponding phylogenetic network can be obtained by parsing the string into a phylogenetic tree with some
replicated nodes and then merging all nodes with the
same tag into a single node, which will become a hybrid
node. For instance, merging the two nodes tagged Y#H1
into a single hybrid node, also tagged Y#H1, and merging
the two nodes tagged X#H2 into a single hybrid node
tagged X#H2 in the phylogenetic tree with repeated nodes
of Figure 2, produces the phylogenetic network of Figure
1.
In a computer program or script, the special labeling of
hybrid nodes can be used for instance to render tree nodes
as circles, recombination or hybridization nodes as boxes,
and lateral gene transfer nodes as arrows between edges.

Discussion
Given an order H1,..., Hm on the hybrid nodes in a phylogenetic network, each hybrid node Hi with k parents u1,
u2,..., uk and < children v1, v2,..., v< is first split in k different
nodes, the first such copy with parent u1 and children v1,
v2,..., v<, and the remaining k - 1 copies with a single parent u2,..., uk, respectively, and no children. Then, each tree
node is labeled
[label] [:branch_length]
and the copies of each hybrid node Hi are all labeled
[label]#[type]i[:branch_length]
where label is an optional string providing a labelling for
the node; type is an optional string indicating if the hybrid
node corresponds to a recombination (indicated by R), a
hybridization (indicated by H) or a lateral gene transfer
(indicated by LGT) event; the mandatory integer i identifies the hybrid node Hi; and branch_length is an optional
number giving the length of the branch from the parent to
the copy of Hi under consideration.
The unique representation of lateral gene transfer events
as hybrid nodes, however, requires distinguishing the
reticulate edge from the other edge coming into the

The adoption of an extended Newick format as a standard
for the representation of phylogenetic network is an
important step towards the publication of explicit phylogenetic networks in peer-reviewed journals and their
incorporation in a future database of published phylogenetic networks.
The representation of a phylogenetic network with k
hybrid nodes as a single phylogenetic tree in Newick format but with k repeated nodes, first proposed in [11] and
further developed in [13] and in this article, facilitates
phylogenetic data sharing and exchange, and allows for
the practical use of phylogenetic networks in computer
programs and scripts. On the other hand, the representation of a phylogenetic network with k hybrid nodes as a
series of k + 1 phylogenetic trees in Newick format,
recently proposed in [15], makes it more difficult to share
and exchange phylogenetic data, and makes it much more
difficult to deal with phylogenetic networks in computer
programs and scripts. Besides, this representation is
longer and more involved than the extended Newick format already published in [13], and it does not seem to add
any new feature that make it deserve a new proposal.
The extended Newick format that we recommend as a
standard for representing plylogenetic network is already

available in the Bio::PhyloNetwork package for phylogenetic networks in Perl [13] as part of the BioPerl bundle
[14], has been recently added to the SplitsTree tool for the
reconstruction and visualization of implicit phylogenetic
networks [16] and to the Dendroscope phylogenetic visualization tool [17], and will be supported in the next
release of the TCS tool for phylogenetic network estimation using statistical parsimony [18].
Therefore, it will be in in the interest of community standards, and in the benefit of the bioinformatics community,
that the authors adopt the standard we have already published in [13] and further described in this article.

by any of the formats mentioned in the manuscript,
including the one that my colleagues and I used in our
recent paper [19]. Ancestral recombination graphs necessitate annotation of the nodes and edges of a network
with information about the sites that mutated along an
edge, and the sites between which recombination events
may have occurred. Unlike the term 'phylogenetic tree'
which is agreed upon already, the term 'phylogenetic network' currently encompasses an array of models that
should not necessarily be treated the same.
I believe these issues need to be resolved before we
address the issue of a standard representation for a diverse
model such as phylogenetic networks.

While I am in complete agreement with the authors on the
issue of standardization of formats, for all pertinent purposes, I think there are several issues that need to be settled before we declare or advocate a unique format for
phylogenetic networks. I briefly discuss these issues next.
A phylogenetic tree represents the evolutionary history of
a set of taxa.
While such a tree may come in different "forms" (rooted,
unrooted, binary, multi-furcating, etc.), its definition is
commonly agreed upon. On the other hand, a phylogenetic network is in fact an umbrella term that has been
used by various computational biologists to mean different things. There are the "evolutionary networks", which
are intended to model reticulate evolutionary relationships. There are the "splits graphs", which are intended to
model any deviation from a tree model, whatever the
cause may be. There are the "ancestral recombination
graphs", which are intended to model evolutionary relationships at the population level, with recombination.
And many more. All these models, though describe different scenarios and must be interpreted differently, are
grouped under the term "phylogenetic networks". This
issue is very significant to address before a "consensus" is
reached and "mandated" about what the correct format is,
if there is such a unique format, as the authors advocate.
For example, I do not see how the splits graph version of
phylogenetic networks can be meaningfully represented

The authors write in the Abstract that the extended Newick
format they advocate is already supported by several phylogenetic tools. Later in the Discussion section, they noted
that it is currently used only in their own Perl package
[13], as well as in SplitsTree (and for this latter tool, it is
not used for all purposes, as the authors indicate, which
again, reflects the issue of different versions of phylogenetic networks).
These are only two tools of over twenty tools that have
been developed so far for modeling different aspects of
phylogenetic networks. The authors correctly note on
Page 3 that "there is not yet, to the best of our knowledge,
any effort to build and maintain a database of published
phylogenetic networks." I concur with the authors on this.
However, the reason for this, I believe, is not the lack of a
standard format. It is because the area of phylogenetic networks is still in its infancy, and reconstruction methods
are still too "primitive" to have their output be taken as a
ground truth that requires storage in a database. The
authors do not seem to acknowledge this fact, since they
write in the first paragraph of the Background section that
"phylogenetic networks have been extensively used in
evolutionary studies." As I am a member of the phylogenetic networks community, I wish this were the case.
However I disagree with the notion that phylogenetic networks have been extensively used. Further, there have
been very few established data sets in the literature with
evidence of reticulate evolution.
Publishing results on the extent of horizontal gene transfer, for example, does not mean that we can take these
results as truths. There is significant debate in the evolutionary biology community about the extent of reticulate
evolution, the role it plays, and the ways (and data
required) to detect it.
The Newick format for representing trees was not devised
for humans to read or write, but for automated parsing
and production. Similarly, we do not expect a phyloge-

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:532

netic network representation for I/O operations would be
for human reading. The authors criticize the representation that we adopted [19] stating that it "makes it more
difficult to share and exchange phylogenetic data, however, because it requires additional mark-up to properly
keep the strings of different phylogenetic networks apart,
especially when the strings of several phylogenetic networks are assembled together in a text file." I would like
to point out that phylogenetic tools, such as PAUP or
MrBayes, in fact use a very rich language for I/O representation, called Nexus. This language allows for all sorts of
annotations. Tools that use the Nexus format further customize it for their own purposes and functionalities. For
example, PAUP has a 'paup' block; MrBayes has a
'mrbayes' block; and so on. I would not be surprised if
specialized blocks for representing phylogenetic networks
are added to the Nexus format.
The authors discuss on Page 5 their own meetings in 2007
and how they decided on a format and discarded of other
formats. However, I was not part of that discussion. Further, PhyloNet [19] was made public for the first time in
early 2006. The format we devised for phylogenetic networks (the evolutionary version of these) was adopted in
PhyloNet before the mentioned meeting. The authors criticism of our discussion of "the extended Newick format"
in our BMC Bioinformatics paper is unfounded. In their
2006 Bioinformatics paper, Morin and Moret [11] proposed a representation that we acknowledged in our BMC
Bioinformatics paper. However, they did not use the term
"extended Newick" or "eNewick", as far as I recall. Our reference to the extended Newick format was simply to the
format we used in the PhyloNet tool. The authors missed
that point, and thought that we meant to say that the format we presented was the one and only, which we never
claimed or advocated (nor do we advocate).
Finally, the last paragraph on Page 5, in which the authors
discuss typos in our manuscript, has nothing to do with
the need for a standard representation of phylogenetic
networks (which is the subject of the authors' paper),
since these typos do not discredit or have anything to do
with the appropriateness of the format we used in PhyloNet. Further, I had personally corresponded with one of
the three authors about these specific typos and clarified
to him what was meant. So, I am surprised to see them
raising these points here, as if they were central to the
issue of standard representation of phylogenetic networks. Nonetheless, I will answer them again:
About the l vs. l +1 trees in the representation of a network
with l hybrid nodes, this is definitely a typo and our examples show that it has l +1 (not l). For each hybrid node ui,
the point is that we attach each of its parents to a single
leaf, yet all these leaves are labeled with xi. Figure 3 in our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/532

manuscript [19] clearly illustrates this. When we write that
the set of trees have the same terminal nodes as the network, we meant that when these trees are restricted to the
original set of leaves of the network before decomposition. About "the resulting trees have disjoin sets of terminal nodes", it is meant that no two trees have any leaf
labels in common. This is also clear in Figure 3.
In summary, I do agree with the authors about the utility
of a standard representation, but I am afraid that the different meanings the term 'phylogenetic network' is currently used to have, coupled with the fact that the entire
discipline is still in its infancy warrant that we not restrict
ourselves to one format and discard others.
