of 5S rDNA in crustaceans of the genus Pollicipes
reveal birth-and-death evolution and strong
purifying selection

Abstract
Background: The 5S ribosomal DNA (5S rDNA) is organized in tandem arrays with repeat units that consist of a
transcribing region (5S) and a variable nontranscribed spacer (NTS), in higher eukaryotes. Until recently the 5S
rDNA was thought to be subject to concerted evolution, however, in several taxa, sequence divergence levels
between the 5S and the NTS were found higher than expected under this model. So, many studies have shown
that birth-and-death processes and selection can drive the evolution of 5S rDNA. In analyses of 5S rDNA evolution
is found several 5S rDNA types in the genome, with low levels of nucleotide variation in the 5S and a spacer
region highly divergent. Molecular organization and nucleotide sequence of the 5S ribosomal DNA multigene
family (5S rDNA) were investigated in three Pollicipes species in an evolutionary context.
Results: The nucleotide sequence variation revealed that several 5S rDNA variants occur in Pollicipes genomes.
They are clustered in up to seven different types based on differences in their nontranscribed spacers (NTS). Five
different units of 5S rDNA were characterized in P. pollicipes and two different units in P. elegans and P. polymerus.
Analysis of these sequences showed that identical types were shared among species and that two pseudogenes
were present. We predicted the secondary structure and characterized the upstream and downstream conserved
elements. Phylogenetic analysis showed an among-species clustering pattern of 5S rDNA types.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the evolution of Pollicipes 5S rDNA is driven by birth-and-death processes
with strong purifying selection.

Background
In higher eukaryotes, nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
genes are usually organized in two multigene families,
each composed of hundreds to thousands of copies. A
major family encodes for 28S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNA, and
a minor family contains only 5S rRNA genes. The 5S
rDNA consists of a conserved transcribing region of 120
bp (hereafter 5S) with a variable intergenic spacer
usually referred to as the nontranscribed spacer (NTS).
The 5S region is highly conserved in length and
sequence even among unrelated species, although there
is a high rate of heterogeneity within the NTS region

among closely related species. This variation of NTS is
due to insertions, deletions, mini-repeats, base-substitutions and pseudogenes and has been used for evolutionary studies and as a source of species-specific or
population specific markers [1-3].
The evolution of ribosomal gene families recently
became controversial after it was analyzed in several
taxa. The evolution of 5S rDNA units has classically
been explained by the concerted evolution model, which
suggests that molecular mechanisms such as gene conversion and unequal crossing-over play an important
role in the homogenization of repeated units. These
mechanisms maintain a high sequence similarity
between copies and prevent the independent evolution
of each member of a multigenic family [4]. However,
several cases have been reported in which sequence

divergence levels between ribosomal genes or spacers
seem to be much higher than would be expected under
a strict concerted evolution scenario [5]. So, many studies have shown that birth-and-death processes and
selection can drive the evolution of 5S rDNA in distantly related taxa [3,5-9]. Under the birth-and-death
evolution model, new variants are created by gene duplication and can remain as functional genes in the genome or become pseudogenes. In this way, transcribing
region conservation could be explained by purifying
selection, as suggested by Nei and Rooney [10].
The genus Pollicipes consists of four species: P. pollicipes, P. elegans, P. polymerus and P. caboverdensis.
These stalked barnacles are sessile pedunculate cirripede
occurring in dense aggregations exposed to heavy swell
on rocky intertidal sites. Distribution of P. pollicipes
(Gmelin 1789) is on the northeastern Atlantic coast,
from Dakar in Senegal to the north coast of Brittany in
France [11,12]. P. elegans (Lesson 1831) is found on the
west coast of South America from Mexico to Peru, and
P. polymerus (Sowerby 1833) is common in the intertidal region of more exposed parts of the west coast of
North America [11]. P. polymerus overlaps P. elegans at
its southern limit, and P. caboverdensis [13] occurs off
the Cape Verde Islands.
Studies focused on 5S rDNA have been performed on
a small number of crustacean species and, different
genomic organization types found. So, in some crustaceans 5S rDNA genes are linked to the major ribosomal
genes [14,15] whereas in Artemia salina and Asellus
aquaticus they are linked to the tandem repeats of the
histone genes [16,17]. 5S rDNA genes are also linked to
U1 small nuclear DNA (snDNA) in A. aquaticus [18],
whereas they are unlinked to other multigene families in
Proasellus coxalis [19].
In the present study, the nucleotide sequences, molecular organization and secondary structure of the 5S
rDNA were investigated in three species of the genus
Pollicipes (P. pollicipes, P. elegans, and P. polymerus) to
know the evolution of these genes in this group of
crustaceans.

Results
Nucleotide sequence analysis of 5S rDNA

A total of 116 5S rDNA sequences from the genomes of
P. pollicipes, P. elegans and P. polymerus was obtained
experimentally to study the molecular evolution of 5S
rDNA. PCR amplification generated different fragments
with different size of 5S rDNA units, as among the different species as within the same species.
A different electrophoretic pattern was obtained in
each of the three species. Six bands of approximately
200 bp, 280 bp, 350 bp, 400 bp, 440 bp, and 600 bp
were observed in P. pollicipes. Four bands were found in

Page 2 of 11

two other species: 350 bp, 550 bp, 700 bp and 900 bp in
P. elegans, and 440 bp, 600 bp 870 bp and 1040 bp in P.
polymerus. Sequence-similarity searches showed that all
sequences matched other 5S rDNA, and BLASTN analysis of the NTS region did not detect any significant
similarity with sequences from any other organisms.
Primers were designed in such a way that only tandemly arranged 5S rDNA units could yield amplification
products. Most of them corresponded to monomers
formed by the last portion of the 5S (88 bp), the NTS,
and the first portion of the contiguous 5S (32 pb). To
maintain the similarity with other 5S rDNA sequences
from the international nucleotide sequence databases,
the 3’ end of the 5S was transferred to the 5’ end. In all
species analyzed here, we obtained several dimer
sequences and a trimer in P. elegans (906 bp), formed
by two and three contiguous monomers respectively
(see Additional File 1, Figure S1). Sequences were
named with the letters a, b, and c when they were the
first, second, or third unit of the array. The b and c
sequences had a complete 5S + NTS units, respectively.
From these sequences we designed a more specific primer (5S-Poll-R2) which differs by only 2 nt from 5SPoll-R. By using the 5S-Poll-R2 primer, we amplified 82
out of 116 sequences obtained in this work. Almost all
dimers were homogeneous (both monomers were identical or almost identical), but in one clone of P. polymerus
we detected a 5S rDNA unit of 1041 bp which consisted
of two monomers of 605 and 436 bp. Therefore, we
have discovered the linkage of two different units. The
trimer was also composed of different monomers. Two
of them consisted of the same repeat, but the other had
a completely different nucleotide sequence in its NTS.
In P. pollicipes only two dimer sequences (407 bp) were
formed by divergent monomers, the shortest of which
consisted of 123 bp (see Additional File 2, Table S1).
These sequences were considered truncated pseudogenes because they lacked seven nucleotides in the 5S
region and the spacer. These sequences were not
included in the subsequent analyses.
The 5S region showed a high GC content (59.2%) and
was 120 bp long in all sequences except one, Py02Oly03
(119 bp). It displayed 27 polymorphic sites which were
analysed excluding the primer-annealing regions in the
a sequences whereas these regions were studied in the b
and c sequences because they present a complete 5S +
NTS units, respectively.
Regarding NTS analyses, the initial alignment showed
that the NTSs of genus Pollicipes were highly divergent,
revealing the existence of different types (see Additional
File 3, Figure S2). The TGI Clustering Tools showed
seven types of NTS that we named using letters from A
to G. The putative pseudogenes were not classified. A
local BLAST allowed us to confirm the types and to

Perina et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:304
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/304

classify two doubtful sequences into their corresponding
types through the E-value. We also carried out a BLAST
among sequences that belonged to different types. In
most cases there was no similarity among them when
we used megablast except in sequences of F and G
types, in which case the E value was 10 -100 or less. F
and G types have the same nucleotide sequence, with
some fixed nucleotide substitutions and large insertions
that increase the length of the sequence from 436-448
(F type) to 604-605 bp (G type).
The NTS showed a high degree of variation produced
by several insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) and
nucleotide substitutions. The size of the NTS region
was highly variable, ranging from 78 to 489 bp. In P.
pollicipes, the lengths of the 5S rDNA units ranged
between 605-609 (A type), 203-207 (B type), 284 (C
type), 353 (E type) and 436 bp (F type); in P. elegans
they were 198 to 351-357 bp (D and E types respectively); and in P. polymerus, they were 436-448 bp for
the F type sequences and 604-605 bp for the G type
ones.
This length disparity in the F type of P. polymerus
(436-448 bp) is due to an insertion of 12 bp in the 324
position. The NTS minimum average size was 83 bp
(78-87bp). The number of polymorphic sites is given in
Table 1.
Sequence divergence was examined separately for the
5S and NTS regions. Values of nucleotide diversity for
the different 5S rDNA types for each species were
higher in the spacer region than in the 5S (Table 1),
except for the D and G types and for sequences of P.
pollicipes F type. Estimates of evolutionary mean distances within types were relatively small (0.004-0.039)
(Table 2), emphasising the low value of the sequences of
the A type with respect to those of E and F types. These
three types are not as biased by sample size as the
others.
Phylogenetic analysis

Despite the length variation of the sequences, we were
able to perform a blastn among them since there were
some regions of similarity (see Additional File 3, Table
S2). An MP tree (Figure 1) was calculated implementing
the “using all sites” option in order to show the evolution of different variants. On the other hand, the networks created for each of the most frequent types of
sequence (A, E and, F-G) (Figure 2) did not show a
clear clustering by species. The network for A type
sequences did not detect any association between different localities. Similarly, the network for the E type did
not reveal any pattern of clustering for the two species
that belong to this group of sequences. The E type
included 47 sequences: 43 sequences of P. elegans and 4
sequences of P. pollicipes. The F type also included two

variants showed an among-species gene clustering pattern supported by high bootstraps (see Additional File 4,
Figure S3). Phylogenetic analysis of the same data set
with the NJ algorithm gave essentially the same topology
as that obtained from the ML tree (data not shown).

Upstream and downstream elements

As the spacer regions contain some conserved elements
that may be involved in 5S transcription, the 78 nt
upstream from the transcription start site of 5S rDNA
of Pollicipes species were arranged together. These

regions formed the terminal region of each NTS. A
search of upstream sequences revealed a conserved AT
rich region at about -25 nt from the 5S rDNA transcription start site (see Additional File 4, Figure S4) in three
groups of sequences: B, C and F. Another conserved
region (CGGCCACCGGC) was identified at positions
-24 to -14 nt from the 5S rDNA transcription start site.
All sequence types except B, C and F displayed this
region. These were the same groups in which the ATrich region was found. Finally, a TTC stretch located at
-7 nt was also identified.
Another clear disparity between the 5S rDNA types
was the number of thymidine residues located in the Trich region, five in the A, B, C, F and G types and four
in the D and E types. These repeated sequences corresponded to transcriptional terminators [20,21].
Internal regulatory regions

The 5S internal control regions (ICRs) were compared
to those of Drosophila melanogaster described by Sharp
and Garcia [22]. As some ICRs coincided with the primer annealing regions, only sequences classified as b or
c were included in the Pollicipes ICRs analysis, in addition to other sequences from other crustaceans available
from EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ: Parhyale hawaiensis
[FN434137]; Proasellus coxalis [Y14281]; Asellus aquaticus [AJ243001] Calanus finmarchicus [X06056] and
Artemia sp. [X14815; V00086; M16191; Y00128;
X14816; X14817]. The consensus internal regulatory
regions of Pollicipes and the other crustaceans are
shown in Figure 3. The four ICRs involved in the transcription of 5S rDNA [22] were identified in the 5S
sequences. Thus in Pollicipes consensus positions 3-18,
37-44, 48-61, and 78-98 were very similar to their orthologs in D. melanogaster (16/16; 8/8; 13/14 and 18/21
matches respectively). We also identified the sequence
elements described in Xenopus laevis [23] that are functionally equivalent to the ICRs: positions 50-61 (box A),
67-72 (intermediate element), and 80-90 (box C) which

Page 5 of 11

also displayed a high degree of similarity (9/12; 5/6; 10/
11 matches respectively).
5S predicted secondary structures

Sequences included in the secondary structure prediction were those classified as b or c. All sequences were
folded (see Additional File 4, Figure S5). We also
obtained the consensus secondary structures, two putative types of structures for Pollicipes and another for
other crustaceans used in this study (Figure 4). In agreement with Delihas and Andersen [24] the 5’ ends were
purines whereas the 3’ ends were pirimidines. Lengths
of helix I were 7 nt (type I) and 9 nt (type II and Crustacea). Helix II has a length of eight nt and a looped-out
residue at position 63 that is a C (characteristic of
metazoans); the two base-pairs that follow this residue
are C-G in the general structure, consistent with
metazoan and plant 5S rRNA. The two positions 49 and
50 are also flanked by G-C base-pairs on both sides. In
the loop bound by helix III there are twelve nucleotides,
and the purine at position 37 is a G in metazoans. The
alternative structure can be observed in helix IV (as
shown in [24]). This helical model includes a C-A mispairing and an increased content of non-canonical basepairs, G-U. The C - loop is formed by 12 bp, the hairpin
E - loop displays the AGUA motif and the terminal loop
contains the conserved G-U-G-A motif.

Discussion
Most of the sequences of Pollicipes analyzed in the present study, except the pseudogenes found in P. pollicipes, might be functional genes because they possess
the necessary elements for gene expression, viz the presence of control elements in the NTS, the poly-T tail at
the 3’ end of the transcribing region, and conserved
ICRs that function as internal promoters of the gene.
Until recently it was thought that the NTS had no function, but studies of deletion mutants have shown that
upstream control elements are required for the

expression of 5S rDNA genes [4]. The NTS minimun
average size was 83 bp. This size agrees with Martins
and Galetti [25], who proposed that an NTS of 60-80 bp
can represent the minimum size for the organization of
this rDNA in the genome. Although in general 5S displays a high degree of conservation among species and
variants, we found some nucleotide substitutions in Pollicipes spp. In the comparisons with D. melanogaster,
the ICR I and ICR II regions were the most conserved.
Furthermore, the proportion of conserved nucleotide
positions in Pollicipes spp. is higher than those obtained
for razor clams [8] and mussels [26] which is not surprising since Pollicipes barnacles and D. melanogaster
belong to the Arthropoda. The degree of conservation
of internal control elements in the 27 crustacean
sequences was 10/16 matches within ICR I, 6/8 matches
within ICR II, 8/14 matches within ICR III, and 19/21
matches within ICR IV. Many nucleotide substitutions
in ICR III were unique for Artemia spp. The highest
degree of conservation was in Pollicipes spp. (11/16, 6/8,
12/14 and 21/21 matches respectively) (see Additional
File 4, Figure S6). The poly-T tail transcription termination signal of 5S rDNA has been studied in several
organisms and seems to be quite conserved. It is part of
a transcribed 15-16 nucleotide segment specific to the
5S rRNA precursor. The 135-nucleotide primary transcript was identified in D. melanogaster by in vitro

transcription and 3’-processed to yield the approximately 126-nucleotide pre’ 5S species and the 120nucleotide mature-size 5S rRNA [22]. The analysis of
upstream sequences of 5S from genus Pollicipes revealed
a putative regulatory region, a TATA - like control element, located around positions -30 to -25 as observed
in several fish species [21] and in razor clams [8]. This
region, together with RNA pol II-like transcriptional factors, may be involved in RNA pol III transcription [27].
The high degree of conservation of TATA-like sequence
positions in all organisms examined to date (e.g.. elasmobranch fishes, [21]) suggests a shared structural pattern. However, in our case, many sequences did not
show the TATA-like motif. The fact that certain conserved regions are associated with a specific variant
could be related to a differential expression throughout
development as seen in Xenopus [28]. Furthermore, we
found a TTC sequence, as previously observed in the
silkworm Bombyx mori [29].
The predicted secondary structure of all 5S sequences
analysed in this work consists of five helices, two hairpin
loops, two internal loops and a hinge region. This structure is consistent with the general eukaryotic 5S rRNA
structure [24,30] and with that obtained for A. salina
[31]. According to Smirnov [32], helix I is potentially
important for RNA-protein recognition and helix III
seems to be associated with the integration of 5S rRNA

Perina et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:304
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/304

into the large ribosome subunit. Helix IV and the terminal loop are responsible for the interaction of 5S rRNA
with 23S rRNA and are involved in the integration of
the large subunit RNA component. Helix IV was conserved in all the predicted consensus secondary structures. However, although helix II was conserved in the
comparison with the one from A. salina, a nucleotide
substitution (G/A) in position 61 was found in some
sequences. The ability of the sequence to adopt a correct consensus secondary structure can be used to discriminate between genes and pseudogenes [33]. In this
way, the putative pseudogenes of 123 bp did not fold.
In recent studies of molecular organization and evolution of 5S rDNA, several classes of 5S rDNA have been
described, for example, in several species of fish [21], in
razor shells [5], and in mussel species [34]. The number
of these different classes of 5S rDNA is low compared
with the eight different types (per species) found in filamentous fungi [6]. In this study we obtained several different classes of 5S rDNA which cluster into seven types
(this number being the maximum of different variants
found in animals). In these studies cited above, the main
difference between classes of 5S rDNA is the length of
the NTS types. In some cases the nucleotide sequence
of the transcribing region also varies. In the case of Pollicipes there is no association between NTS and 5S.
In related species there is greater similarity among
repeat units within the same cluster than among repeat
units of different clusters; furthermore, similarity among
repeat units within the same clusters from different
related species is higher than among different clusters in
the same species. According to this, some authors as
Martins and Galetti [35] have suggested that different
5S rDNA loci evolve independently. We have found
sequences that show a greater similarity in 5S rDNA
units within a specific type between two species than
between two types in the same species. Other studies
have reported that the two types of 5S rDNA are not in
separate clusters, since different variants have been
found in tandem in the same clone [25,36]. Similarily,
we found that sequences belonging to different types
were organized in tandem. We sequenced 9 dimers E-E,
2 dimers F-F, one dimer D-E, another dimer F-G, one
trimer E-D-E and another 2 dimers that consisted of C
type monomers linked to putative pseudogenes. By gene
conversion, dimers and trimers, i.e tandem repeat units,
should be composed of the same variants. However, we
observed that this is not always the case. This tandem
organization might therefore be caused by one or both
of two reasons: 1) a variant may have recently been
transposed, or 2) the unit of homogenization consists of
dimers or trimers. Although these variants are in tandem, the repeats could be dispersed throughout the genome. At this moment, the attempts to locate these loci

on metaphase chromosomes, by fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH), have been unsuccessful.
The evolution of ribosomal gene families has traditionally been explained by the model of concerted evolution, which proposes that all members of a gene
family are assumed to evolve in a concerted manner
rather than independently, and a mutation occurring in
a repeat spreads through all the member genes by
repeated occurrence of unequal crossover or gene conversion [10]. Therefore, sequence similarity is greater
within a species than among related species [21]. However, previous studies have shown that multigene
families could be evolving under the birth-and-death
model. Under this model new genes are created by gene
duplication, and some duplicated genes are maintained
in the genome for a long time, whereas others are
deleted or become non-functional through deleterious
mutations [10]. Thus, according to the data (Figure 1) B
and C variants could have originated after the colonization of the Atlantic ocean by P. pollicipes, whereas variants of the A, D, E, F, and G types are maintained in
the three species so that their origin variant may have
been present in the species’ common ancestor. The case
of ribosomal DNA could be more complex and involve
a combined effect of concerted and birth-and-death evolution [3,34]. Our data did not reveal a clustering by
species. There were no fixed differences among species
and low levels of nucleotide variation within the 5S
region. However, divergence was observed among NTSs
from different units. Taken together, these observations
highlight the importance of purifying selection over the
functional regions.
We found two putative pseudogenes in P. pollicipes.
The presence of 5S rDNA truncated pseudogenes has
also been described in other species, including humans
[37], fishes [38], and filamentous fungi [6]. As pointed
out by Rooney and Ward [6], the truncated sequences
are believed to be pseudogenes because their lack of an
intact transcribing sequence effectively destroys the secondary structure of the 5S rRNA molecule that they
would have otherwise encoded. The presence of pseudogenes in a multigene family strongly suggests that the
family evolves under a birth-and-death process [39-41].
According to this model, a multigene family can expand
as a consequence of gene duplication and contract
because of gene loss (e.g. as a result of unequal crossover). Eventually, distinct gene copies accumulate differences, leading some of them to degenerate into
pseudogenes [6]. Under a birth-and-death process, the
5S rDNA multigene family is expected to show several
variants, and the phylogenetic analyses of the genes of
several closely related species will not show a withinspecies clustering pattern, but they should cluster
according to their sequence similarities [3,5,7]. This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/304

agrees with the pattern obtained in the phylogenies and
networks where sequences of 5S rDNA belonging to different Pollicipes species clustered together. In some species, 5S rDNA are dispersed throughout the genome, as
in Schizosaccharomyces pombe [42]. The dispersed gene
organization apparently facilitates birth-and-death evolution wherein rRNA genes diverge from one another,
some being unique to a given species, others shared
among species [41].

Conclusions
Although more experimental work is needed to reveal
the number 5S rDNA variants within a genome, our
study has provided new and interesting insights into the
genome organization of 5S rDNA in barnacles, and is
the first to demonstrate that crustaceans can posses different size variants of 5S rDNA arrays carrying a distinct
NTS spacer. We found up to seven different types of 5S
rDNA based on the analysis of the NTS region. Five different units of 5S rDNA were characterized in P. pollicipes and two in P. elegans and P. polymerus. Our
results demonstrate that the 5S rDNA of the genus Pollicipes is organized in tandem repeats of different sizes,
although dispersed units can be present in the genome.
In short, we found (1) up to seven 5S rDNA types in
Pollicipes spp., (2) an interspecies clustering of Pollicipes
5S rDNA variants, (3) identical variants shared among
species and unique variants that are species specific, (4)
a lack of homogenization between spacer sequences of
different types, and (5) two pseudogenes.
We conclude that Pollicipes 5S rDNA is subjected to
birth-and-death evolution with strong purifying selection
that explains the low levels of variation found in the 5S
and the extant variation of NTS sequences. This evolutionary mechanism described in fungi and bivalve

Page 8 of 11

molluscs appears to be applicable to other organisms.
Moreover, further studies on crustacean species are
needed to improve our knowledge of 5S rDNA organization and evolution in this group of organisms.

Methods
Genetic analyses were conducted on three species of the
genus Pollicipes. Samples of the Atlantic species P. pollicipes were obtained from different localities of Galicia
(Spain) and a Morocco market (Table 3). P. elegans specimens were collected in northern Peru, and P. polymerus in Olympic National Park (Washington, USA).
Accession numbers are [EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ:
FR831801-FR831899] (see Additional File 2,Table S1).
Pieces of foot muscle were excised and preserved in
absolute ethanol.
The NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel and Co.)
was used to extract genomic DNA from foot tissue. The
5S rDNA sequences from each genomic DNA were
amplified by PCR. Three pairs of primers were used for
this analysis. The first one pair was 5S-Univ-F and 5SUniv-R [5]. Two new and more specific pairs were
designed from P. pollicipes 5S sequences, available after
amplification with 5S-Univ-F and 5S-Univ-R. These new
pairs of primers were 5S-Poll-F (5’-TCC GAT CAC
CGA AGT TAA GC-3’) and 5S-Poll-R (5’-ACC GGT
GTT TTC AAC GTG AT-3’), and 5S-Poll-F and 5SPoll-R2 (5’-ACT GGT GTT TTC AAC GTG GT-3’).
These designed primers have opposite orientations, are
separated by 5 bp and anneal at positions 13-32 y 38-57
of the 5S transcribing region. They were designed for
the amplification of one unit of any tandemly arranged
5S rDNA in the genus Pollicipes.
PCRs were carried out in a BIORAD My Cycler tm
thermocycler using a reaction volume of 25 μl

Thermocycling conditions were 5 min at 95°C; 35 cycles
of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 50°C, and 30 s at 72°C; and a
final 5 min extension at 72°C. A negative control was
also included to test for any contamination. The PCR
products were resolved in 1.5% agarose gel, and visualized after ethidium bromide staining via ultraviolet
trans-illumination.
The PCR-generated 5S rDNA fragments were cloned
in the pSC-A-amp/kan PCR Cloning Vector (StrataGene), and used to transform E. coli competent cells. A
subset of transformant colonies from each cloning reaction was analyzed by PCR in order to check the insert
size. A QiaPrep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) was used to
purify the plasmids. Sequencing reactions were carried
out using both M13 Forward and M13 Reverse primers
in a capillary DNA sequencer (3130xl Genetic Analysis
System, Applied Biosystems).

TOUCAN workbench [48] establishing a comparison
with reference sequences from the Drosophila Eukaryotic
Promoter (EPD) and JASPAR database, and others were
manually compared with published regulatory elements.
The 5S sequences were folded into the RNA alifold web
server [49] applying constraints (see Additional File 5) to
obtain the predicted consensus secondary structures.
Pollicipes 5S rDNA sequences were subjected to a
neighbor-net analysis [50] implemented in the SplitsTree 4 package [51] using GTR distances [52]. A
maximun parsimony (MP) tree was built using MEGA
4.0.2 [47], selecting the “use all sites” option. Bootstrap
resampling was applied to assess support for individual
nodes using 1000 replicates. Additionally, maximum
likelihood (ML) phylogenetic relationships among 5S
rDNA sequences were established using the PALM
web server [53]. The reliability of the topologies was
tested by the bootstrap procedure [54] with 100 replicates. Modeltest 3.7 software [55] was employed to
determine the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution,
applying the Akaike information criterion (AIC).

Bioinformatics analysis

Additional material

The quality of the electropherograms was checked in
BioEdit 7.0.9.0. [43]. The BLAST 2 Sequence Tool [44]
was used to compare the ends of both forward and
reverse sequences obtained from each clone. These
sequences were overlapped by hand. For sequence alignment we used ClustalX [45]. Because length variation is
a problem when performing alignments, sequences had
to be grouped separately, according to similarity. Clustering was performed with the TGI Clustering Tools
developed at TIGR (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/
software/). We also performed a statistical evaluation of
the local similarities among spacer types or assembled
clusters in a local BLAST in BioEdit 7.0.9.0. [43]. The
BLAST 2 Sequences Tool was employed to evaluate the
local similarities between pairs of sequences that belong
to different types.
The number of polymorphic sites, the number of haplotypes and the nucleotide diversity were calculated
from DnaSP 5.00.04 [46]. All nucleotide sequence divergence analyses were conducted using the Maximum
Composite Likelihood method in MEGA 4.0.2. [47]. All
positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset after selecting the complete deletion option. Standard errors were calculated by the
bootstrap option with 1000 replicates.
In order to search for putative regulatory conserved
elements, we analysed sequences upstream and downstream of the 5S region. Searches were performed within
the first 78-120 nt upstream and downstream of the
DNA transcribing region. Some putative 5S rDNA transcriptional regulatory motifs were identified by the
