Abstract
Background: The cellular response of plants to water-deficits has both economic and evolutionary importance directly
affecting plant productivity in agriculture and plant survival in the natural environment. Genes induced by water-deficit stress
have been successfully enumerated in plants that are relatively sensitive to cellular dehydration, however we have little
knowledge as to the adaptive role of these genes in establishing tolerance to water loss at the cellular level. Our approach to
address this problem has been to investigate the genetic responses of plants that are capable of tolerating extremes of
dehydration, in particular the desiccation-tolerant bryophyte, Tortula ruralis. To establish a sound basis for characterizing the
Tortula genome in regards to desiccation tolerance, we analyzed 10,368 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from rehydrated rapiddried Tortula gametophytes, a stage previously determined to exhibit the maximum stress induced change in gene expression.
Results: The 10, 368 ESTs formed 5,563 EST clusters (contig groups representing individual genes) of which 3,321 (59.7%)
exhibited similarity to genes present in the public databases and 2,242 were categorized as unknowns based on protein
homology scores. The 3,321 clusters were classified by function using the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy and the KEGG
database. The results indicate that the transcriptome contains a diverse population of transcripts that reflects, as expected, a
period of metabolic upheaval in the gametophyte cells. Much of the emphasis within the transcriptome is centered on the protein
synthetic machinery, ion and metabolite transport, and membrane biosynthesis and repair. Rehydrating gametophytes also have
an abundance of transcripts that code for enzymes involved in oxidative stress metabolism and phosphorylating activities. The
functional classifications reflect a remarkable consistency with what we have previously established with regards to the metabolic
activities that are important in the recovery of the gametophytes from desiccation. A comparison of the GO distribution of
Tortula clusters with an identical analysis of 9,981 clusters from the desiccation sensitive bryophyte species Physcomitrella patens,
revealed, and accentuated, the differences between stressed and unstressed transcriptomes. Cross species sequence
comparisons indicated that on the whole the Tortula clusters were more closely related to those from Physcomitrella than
Arabidopsis (complete genome BLASTx comparison) although because of the differences in the databases there were more high
scoring matches to the Arabidopsis sequences. The most abundant transcripts contained within the Tortula ESTs encode Late
Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins that are normally associated with drying plant tissues. This suggests that LEAs may also
play a role in recovery from desiccation when water is reintroduced into a dried tissue.
Conclusion: The establishment of a rehydration EST collection for Tortula ruralis, an important plant model for plant stress
responses and vegetative desiccation tolerance, is an important step in understanding the genome level response to cellular
dehydration. The type of transcript analysis performed here has laid the foundation for more detailed functional and genome
level analyses of the genes involved in desiccation tolerance in plants.

Background
The cellular response of plants to water deficits has both
economic and evolutionary importance directly affecting
plant productivity in agriculture and plant survival in the
natural environment. Ramanathan [1] has argued, based
on predictions of global environmental changes, that
developing crops which are more tolerant to water deficits
while maintaining productivity, will become a critical
requirement in the early part of the 21st century. Understanding how plant cells tolerate water loss is a vital prerequisite for developing strategies for improving tolerance
of, and biomass/seed production under drought
conditions.
In the last decade the genes induced by water-deficit stress
have been successfully enumerated in plants that are relatively sensitive to cellular dehydration, in particular Arabidopsis thaliana [2-6]. In addition, the mechanisms by
which the genetic response to water deficit is controlled by
abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent and independent pathways have also been extensively elucidated [6,7]. However, even with the recent addition of in-depth
examination of gene expression patterns using Arabidopsis
microarrays [8,9] we have little functional knowledge of
the genes that respond to water deficits. Of critical importance is the question of which of the genes identified as
responding to water deficits actually have an adaptive role
in establishing tolerance, in particular tolerance of cellular
dehydration, and which are genes that are only responding to the injury incurred by the imposition of the stress.
Injury may induce, or repress, specific genes that are not
involved in promoting adaptation to cellular dehydration. An indication that at least some of the genes have an
adaptive function in dehydration tolerance derives from
the observation that they are expressed in tissues that
acquire desiccation tolerance, the extreme manifestation
of dehydration tolerance, such as in maturing seeds and in
leaves of desiccation-tolerant plants during drying
[3,10,11]. However, in order to fully address the question
of the adaptive importance of genes involved in responses
to cellular dehydration it is necessary to gain an evolutionary perspective of the involvement of a gene in dehydration tolerance mechanisms. To this end we have
established an ongoing comparative genomics program to
study the genetic responses to dehydration in species that
span the evolution of dehydration (desiccation) tolerance
mechanisms within the land plants. Here we present an
analysis of ESTs derived from the desiccation-tolerant bryophyte Tortula ruralis [Hedw.] Gaertn. Meyer & Scherb.,
that is representative of the primitive genetic strategy for
the acquisition of desiccation-tolerance [see [12,13]].
Desiccation tolerance, the ability to recover from the
almost complete loss (90%) of protoplasmic water, is a
phenomenon common in the reproductive structures of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/89

green plants: pollen, spores and seeds. However, the ability to survive vegetative desiccation is a demonstrable but
uncommon occurrence in the plant kingdom [13-18].
Within the flowering plants there are only approximately
300 species of flowering plants that are known to tolerate
vegetative desiccation [16,17].
Recent physiological phylogenetic analyses indicate that
vegetative desiccation tolerance was primitively present in
the bryophytes (the basal-most living clades of land
plants), but was lost in the evolution of tracheophytes.
Desiccation-tolerant bryophytes are found worldwide and
occupy a variety of ecological niches, most of which
could, during some period of the year, be considered as
extreme either on a macro or microhabitat level. In most
cases the extremes that these plants experience are both in
water availability and temperature [19-23].
Desiccation-tolerant bryophytes, because of their simple
architecture, have few, if any, morphological (or indeed
physiological) characteristics or adaptations that can limit
water loss or regulate plant temperature. As a result of this,
the internal water content of their photosynthetic tissues
rapidly equilibrates to the water potential of the environment once free water is lost from the surface of the plant.
This in turn means that these plants experience drying
rates that are much faster than those experienced by their
more complex pteridophyte or angiosperm counterparts.
In fact, the drying rates that desiccation-tolerant bryophytes experience are generally lethal to desiccation-tolerant ferns and flowering plants [14]. The rapid
equilibration of protoplasmic water potential with that of
the environment in bryophyte tissues appears to demand
a type of desiccation tolerance that is significantly different from that exhibited by desiccation tolerant
angiosperms [15]. Rather than acquiring desiccation tolerance in response to a dehydration event as seen in Craterostigma plantagineum, Sporobolus stapfianus, and other
desiccation-tolerant angiosperms, desiccation-tolerant
bryophytes appear to express this trait constitutively
[15,24]. This form of desiccation tolerance is considered
the most primitive of those that have received attention so
far [13]. In this type of tolerance the primary response to
a desiccation event, at least at the level of gene expression,
occurs after the fact, during the first hour or two following
rehydration. This has led to the suggestion that a major
component of the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in
bryophytes is a rehydration-induced cellular repair
response [15,24]. The implication is that although cellular
protection and hence desiccation tolerance is constitutive,
it is not sufficient to prevent some damage from occurring
(or being manifested) upon rehydration, and thus repair
processes are needed and induced when water returns to
the protoplasm of the cells.

The repair aspect of the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in these plants, although demonstrated to be a major
component of tolerance, is difficult to detail and characterize. Most work has focused on the proteins whose synthesis is induced immediately upon rehydration of
desiccated gametophytic tissue. Early work [25] established the ability of T. ruralis and other mosses to rapidly
recover synthetic metabolism when rehydrated. The speed
of this recovery was inversely dependent upon the rate of
prior desiccation: the faster the rate of desiccation, the
slower the recovery. In addition, although the pattern of
protein synthesis in the first two hours of rehydration of
T. ruralis is distinctly different from that of hydrated controls, novel transcripts were not made in response to desiccation [26]. Hence it was suggested that T. ruralis
responds to desiccation by an alteration in protein synthesis upon rehydration that is in large measure the result of
a change in translational control. Changes in transcriptional activity were observed for nearly all transcripts studied [27] but did not result in a qualitative change in the
transcript population during desiccation or rehydration. It
thus appears that T. ruralis relies more upon the activation
of pre-existing repair mechanisms for desiccation tolerance than it does on either pre-established or activated
protection systems.
In a detailed study of the changes in protein synthesis initiated by rehydration in T. ruralis, Oliver [26] demonstrated that during the first two hours of hydration the
synthesis of 25 proteins is terminated, or substantially
decreased, and the synthesis of 74 proteins is initiated, or
substantially increased. Controls over changes in synthesis of these two groups of proteins, the former termed
hydrins and the latter rehydrins, are not mechanistically
linked. It takes a certain amount of prior water loss to fully
activate the synthesis of rehydrins upon rehydration. RNA
blots revealed that several rehydrin transcripts accumulate
during slow drying [28,29] at a time when it is assumed
that transcriptional activity is rapidly declining. These
transcripts do not accumulate during rapid desiccation,
nor is their accumulation during slow drying associated
with an increase in endogenous ABA accumulation. ABA
is undetectable in this moss [[30], M. J. Oliver, unpubl
data], and T. ruralis does not synthesize specific proteins
in response to applied ABA. The accumulation of these
transcripts was postulated to be the result of an increase in
mRNA stability brought about by the removal of water
from the cells [27]. Recent studies clearly demonstrate
that these transcripts are sequestered in the dried gametophytes in mRNP particles [29] and that this results in the
change in their stability. The implication from this work is
that the sequestration of mRNAs required for recovery
hastens the repair of damage induced by desiccation or
rehydration and thus minimizes the time needed to restart
growth upon rehydration.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/89

The major question arising from these studies concerns
the identity of rehydrins and what possible functions and
roles they may play in regards to the response to desiccation and rehydration and to desiccation tolerance per se.
We have some limited knowledge of the functions (or
postulated functions) of a few of the rehydrins from classical molecular analyses, [31,32] and from a small-scale
EST collection analysis [33]. However, there is an obvious
need to extend this base and to develop testable hypotheses that will help us to elucidate the metabolic and genetic
mechanisms that control the recovery and repair of dried
plant cells and their role in the development and evolution of desiccation tolerance. To gain an appreciation of
the number of possible rehydrin genes and the range of
possible functions encompassed by their expression we
have initiated a genomics level analysis of gene expression
during the recovery of Tortula gametophytes from the desiccated state. The first step in this process was to establish
an EST collection that is representative of the transcripts
available to the moss during the first few hours following
rehydration. In this report we present a bioinformatic
analysis of 10, 368 ESTs from the early phases of recovery
following rehydration of rapidly-dried Tortula ruralis
gametophytes; rapid dried gametophytes were chosen in
order to maximize the recovery and repair response upon
rehydration. The bioinformatics approach we have taken
is based on that used by McCarter et al., [34] to conduct a
comprehensive analysis of 5,700 Meloidogyne incognita L2
ESTs, and includes cluster analyses, transcript abundancy
estimations, and functional classifications based on InterPror domains, Gene Ontology hierarchy, and KEGG biochemical classifications. The overall goal was to gain an
appreciation of the Tortula transcriptome during the time
period following rehydration when the desiccation driven
alteration in gene expression is at its peak. During this
period we hypothesize the processes of cellular repair and
recovery are the main focus of the metabolism of the
gametophytic cells.

Results and discussion
Ten thousand three hundred and sixty eight individual
cDNA clones were selected from a Tortula ruralis rehydration library and subjected to single-pass 5' directional
sequencing to generate 10,368 primary ESTs of which
9,159 (88%) passed through quality control, vector trimming, E. coli contamination, and cloning artifact removal.
The 9,159 ESTs averaged 648 nucleotides in length and
totaled 5.93 million nucleotides submitted to Genbank.
These submitted ESTs form the basis of the subsequent
transcriptome analysis utilizing the High ThroughputGene Ontology-Genome Annotation Toolkit (HT-GOGAT), a software developed by S.E. Dowd (unpublished).

non-normalized library 96.5% of the clusters still have 5
or fewer EST members.

Cluster analysis
Utilizing the assembly algorithms incorporated in the
SeqManII software (part of the DNASTAR suite from
DNASTAR Inc, Madison WI), the 9,159 ESTs were
grouped into contigs and clusters by establishing assembly stringencies that generated groupings defined by the
analysis protocols of McCarter et al., 2003 [34]. Contigs
contain EST members that appear to originate from single
transcripts whereas clusters are assemblies of ESTs that
could represent transcripts from the same gene but alternate splice isoforms, or in the case of Tortula ESTs, which
derive from a population of individual gametophytes,
alleles of the same gene. The 9,159 ESTs formed 7,272
contigs and 5,563 clusters, both of which exhibit an average size of 669 nucleotides. However, the longest
sequence increased from 1,575 nucleotides for contigs to
2,229 nucleotides for clusters. Clusters varied in content
from a single EST (singletons) in 4,362 cases (78%) to 48
ESTs for a single cluster (Figure 1). The elimination of
redundancy during contig building and cluster formation
reduced the total number of nucleotides for further analyses from 5.93 million to 4.87 million (contigs) and 3.71
million (clusters). Overall the 9,159 ESTs potentially represent 5,563 genes, a discovery rate of 60%, with 47.6% of
the ESTs as singletons. This is an overestimation of gene
discovery since several non-overlapping clusters can represent a single gene and from our blast search data this
appears to be a possibility, at least in the case of clusters
121 and 204 that appear to independently represent a
gene that has a weak similarity to the LEA protein of

Transcript abundance
The consensus Cluster sequences were subjected to a
BLASTx style search of a custom curated non-redundant
database derived from UNIPROT and annotated according to the degree of similarity of the cluster to the highest
scoring match in the database of known gene sequences.
The degree of similarity was based on the quality of the
BLASTx statistical outputs as well as a visual inspection of
the aligned sequences between the query and the target.
Clusters that generated an HSP-bit score below 70 and or
E values higher than 10-7 were assessed manually for all
possible alignments taking into account the alignment
length, number of identical matches, gaps, and positive
replacements. Utilizing these criteria we were able to
annotate 3,321 (59.7 %) of the 5,563 clusters by their
similarity to known genes within the database. This also
meant that 2,242 of the clusters, or 40.3%, represent
sequences that have no known counterpart in the public
databases and that we categorize as unknowns.

Table 1 lists the 30 most abundant EST clusters derived
from the Tortula rehydration EST collection. These transcripts only account for 8.4% of the generated ESTs, however. Ten of the most abundantly represented transcripts
encode proteins that do not match any of the sequences in
the databases searched in this study and are designated as
unknowns. Seven abundant transcripts appear to encode
proteins that belong to a class of proteins known as Late
Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins, although the
relatively low HSP bit scores and high E-values for most of
these BLASTx matches has to be considered as a caveat in
this assessment. LEA proteins have long been ascribed a
protective role for cells that are experiencing dehydration
[11,35]. This is a conclusion drawn on the strong correlation between LEA transcript accumulation and water loss,
rapid decline in transcript levels upon rehydration, and
especially as LEA gene expression relates to the programmed desiccation stage of seed maturation. If one can
conclude that LEA protein transcripts are abundant in the
rehydration transcriptome of Tortula ruralis, which is consistent with some of our earlier findings [32], then it is
also possible that these proteins are involved in either
protection of cellular integrity during the initial phases
following rehydration when cell disruption is apparent in
bryophytes [36], or are actively involved in the restoration
of cells damaged by a desiccation event. This difference in
the response of LEA gene expression between Tortula and
what has been reported for angiosperms may also be a
reflection of what we believe to be a more primitive mechanism of dehydration tolerance, and perhaps a more
primitive role for and control of LEA gene expression.

Other abundant transcripts appear to fall into the membrane transport (aquaporin, cysteine rich proteins, channel and pore proteins) and proteins that can be associated
with plant stress events (metallothionine, esterase, and
rubredoxin). The Early Light Inducible Protein A (ELIP-A)
transcript is the only member of the abundant transcripts
that we have previously reported [33] as belonging to the
group of proteins we have termed, rehydrins [31]. These
proteins have been suggested to be synthesized in
response to stress-induced photo-damage within the Tortula chloroplast and may play a protective or repair function for the photosynthetic apparatus [37].
Although transcript abundance may reflect the metabolic
or physiological needs of the moss during the rehydration
phase of a wet/dry/wet cycle it would be more desirable to
know how these transcripts are recruited and utilized by
the translational machinery to make the proteins that
actually contribute to the recovery of the gametophytes
following rehydration. Such information is beyond the
scope of this analysis but the identification and isolation

of the Clusters that represent the Tortula rehydration transcriptome does represent the first major step for such a
pursuit.
Functional classification of transcripts
Physiological, biochemical, and molecular data all point
towards an active period of cellular activity, presumably
for repair and recovery from desiccation induced damage,
during the first two hours following rehydration of dried
gametophytes [13,15]. The identity of the more abundant
transcripts (Table 1.) does provide some insight into the
nature of the metabolic activity that is associated with
rehydration, at least it gives an indication of what metabolic processes may be of prime concern as the plant
recovers from desiccation. However, the functional classification of the Tortula transcripts present during the initial
phases following rehydration using the Gene Ontology
(GO) classification system paints a broader view of the
possible metabolic activity of the gametophytic cells at
this time. This does, of course, come with the understanding that these are transcript based analyses and do not

directly reflect protein levels which would offer a more
definitive assessment of the metabolic capability of the
cells during rehydration.
Functional classification of the Tortula rehydration transcripts was achieved by matching the Tortula clusters to
characterized protein domains in a combined protein
database, using HT-GO-GAT (Materials and Methods),
which allowed us to assign GO terms to each cluster. The
assignment of GO terms made it possible to place the
clusters into the GO hierarchy which can be viewed by use
of an AmiGo browser. Of the 3, 321 clusters that exhibited
significant similarity to known genes in the public databases, 2,203 (66% of annotated or 40% of all clusters)
represent genes that contain conserved protein domains
that have known biochemical and physiological functions
in other organisms and map to the GO hierarchy. The GO
representations for the Tortula rehydration clusters are
presented in Tables 2 through 4. The representations are
segregated into the three main organizing principles of
GO: biological process (Table 2), cellular component
(Table 3), and molecular function (Table 4). A complete
listing of the GO mappings is available on our website at
http://199.133.147.108/Bryobase.

Of the 2,203 clusters, 1673 (76%) map into the Biological
Processes classification, 1641 (98%) of these fall into the
Physiological Processes category and 409 (24.5%) crossmap into the Cellular Processes category (Table 2). Within
physiological processes 80% of the clusters were associated with metabolism and 20% cell growth and
maintenance (it is within this group that most of the overlap occurs with the Cellular Processes category). The distribution is not surprising for ESTs (clusters) derived from
a tissue that is harvested at a time of metabolic upheaval
such as rehydration and recovery from the desiccated
state. In support of this notion are the almost identical
distributions of ESTs observed for cDNA collections from
protonemal tissues of the moss Physcomitrella patens following various hormonal treatments designed to illicit
developmental perturbations and metabolic switching
(Table 5, and from data reported by Nishiyama et al.,
2003 [38]).
The subcategory distributions within the Physiological
and Cellular processes also seem to reflect the nature of
the cellular disturbances that result from a desiccationrehydration event. Processes involved in metabolite and
ion transport within and between cells are represented by
17% of the clusters that map to Biological Processes, and

almost 86% of those that map to the Cell Growth and
Maintenance subcategory. Within the Metabolism subcategory of Physiological processes 40% (32% of total) of
the clusters map to protein metabolism (synthesis) and
37% (30% of total) map to biosynthetic processes. The
considerable representation within the aforementioned
three subcategories is consistent with much of our biochemical and physiological evidence concerning the
metabolic activity and emphasis in gametophytic cells
during rehydration [15,24,25]. In particular, following
rehydration the protein synthetic machinery is rapidly
reconstituted, having been dismantled during drying, to
direct the synthesis of pattern of proteins termed rehydrins that appear to be a crucial aspect of the desiccation
tolerance mechanism of Tortula ruralis (as described
above). The importance of the protein synthetic machinery and its re-establishment following rehydration is also
highlighted by the preponderance of clusters associated
with the Ribosomal subcategory of the Cellular
Component Classification; 40% of the Cytoplasm category (23% overall).
Only 982 clusters (45% of the 2,203 that constitute the
mapped population) map within the Cellular Component Classification and are presumably associated with
structural functions (Table 3). Of these 982 clusters,
almost all map to the Cell classification within which
72% map to Intracellular components and 38% to the
Membrane category. Within these categories, representation is most significant in the ribosomal, integral membrane protein, and plastid subcategories. As discussed
above the importance of protein synthesis during recovery
from desiccation tolerance may explain the preponderance of clusters associated with ribosomal structural com-

ponents as well as the number of clusters that are
associated with the membrane and plastid subcategories.
Ultrastructural studies of dried and rehydrated gametophytes clearly indicate that the inrush of water during
rehydration disrupts membranes and causes a disorganization of the internal granal structures and swelling of the
large chloroplasts of the Tortula leaf cells [36,39].
Of the clusters that can be mapped into GO hierarchies,
90% can be ascribed molecular functions (Table 4). Of the
major categories, Binding activity (38%), Catalytic activity
(58.5%), Structural Molecule activity (13%), and Transporter activity (14%) are best represented in the cluster
collection. Metal ion, nucleic acid, and nucleotide binding are the most represented subcategories within the
Binding activity category perhaps reflective of the need for
biosynthetic and repair activity associated with rehydration of moss cells. Within the Catalytic activity category
the majority of the clusters are associated with Hydrolase
(19%), Transferase (15.5%), Oxireductase (13.5%), and
Kinase (7%) activities. Almost half of the clusters associated with the Transferase activity subcategory map as
transferring phosphate-containing groups. Each one of
these subcategories represent catalytic activities that could
be argued as important for a cell to recover from a major
metabolic perturbation such as that seen during rehydration. The significant representation within the Kinase and
phosphate transfer categories also suggests an active metabolic control "program" occurs when the desiccated cells
receive water and attempt to recover from the damage. It
is also intriguing that there is a significant representation
within the Transporter subcategory as little is known of
this group within the context of desiccation tolerance in
bryophytes, although solute (osmolytes) and sugar

transport in and out of the vacuoles of desiccation tolerant
Angiosperms [3] do occur during desiccation and
rehydration.
Of particular interest to this study are clusters that represent gene expression control factors both at the transcriptional (41 clusters) and translational level (54 clusters).
These clusters, along with those that represent biochemical control mechanisms for signaling and gene expression
at the protein level, such as kinases (90 clusters) and phosphate-transfer activities (154 clusters), may represent critical elements in the activation and execution of the
cellular recovery processes necessary for the mechanism of
desiccation tolerance exhibited by Tortula ruralis. This is of
importance because of the key position of bryophytes in
the evolution of desiccation tolerance in plants. Our main
hypothesis is that an elucidation of the signaling and activation pathways for the rehydration response in this
assumed primitive tolerance mechanism could have
major implications for the study of stress tolerance mechanisms in all plants and thus these clusters represent
important targets for further study at the molecular and
biochemical levels.
GO based comparison with Physcomitrella patens EST
collections
The representation of the Tortula rehydration clusters
throughout the GO mapping system is indicative of the
emphases on, but not expression levels of, particular cellular activities represented in the moss gametophytes during this period of a wet and dry cycle. In an attempt to
assess if the accents on particular cellular activities indicated for rehydrated gametophytes are characteristic of the

rehydration induced metabolic state or are simply indicative of processes associated with normally active bryophyte cells, we compared the representation of the Tortula
rehydration clusters within the GO categories with similar
"clusters" from Physcomitrella patens, the only other bryophyte that has similar genomic level information. The
majority of the Physcomitrella "clusters" are derived from a
large EST collection representing transcripts from both
untreated and hormone induced (to switch developmental pathways) cells of protonemal cultures. The Physcomitrella ESTs are described by Nishiyama et al., [38] and
were obtained from Physcobase http://moss.nibb.ac.jp/
as assembled contigs (assembled in an identical fashion
to what we designate as clusters). In total 22,885 Physcomitrella contigs, derived from 102553 ESTs obtained
from Physcobase and Genbank, were subjected to a
BLASTx search, as described for the Tortula clusters using
HT-GO-GAT. Of the 22,885 contigs 9,981 (43.6%) represent genes that contain conserved protein domains that
have known biochemical and physiological functions in
other organisms and map to the GO hierarchy.
There are two caveats for this comparison; 1) differences
in representation may simply reflect species differences in
the emphasis on individual classes of cellular activities
between Tortula and Physcomitrella, or 2) differences in
representation may reflect differences in the emphasis on
individual classes of cellular activities between mature
gametophytes (Tortula) and protonema (Physcomitrella).
Until a comparison of GO mapping distributions can be
made directly between clusters derived from an EST collection from hydrated control gametophytes from Tortula
with those from the rehydration collection these caveats

remain important. Nevertheless, even with these
difficulties and limitations the comparison is still useful
for developing new hypotheses as to what cellular processes might be important in the recovery of moss cells
from desiccation.
In general the distribution of the Tortula clusters within
the GO mappings are similar if not identical to the distribution of the Phycomitrella contigs gleaned from Physcobase. This can be seen especially at the GO map 2 and 3
relationship-level categories (Table 1 and supplemental
material) using the multi-species GO browser
(DrZOOview2.0 http://199.133.147.108/mainbioinfor
matics.html). However, there are several notable differences and in general the differences are consistent with
what has been determined, in earlier studies, to be important in the recovery of the moss from desiccation following rehydration [4,23] and what is known about plant
responses to abiotic stress in general [8,13]. The differences evident in the comparison are presented in Table 5,
where the extent of the similarity in the distribution of the
clusters are expressed as the ratio of representation for Tortula to representation for Physcomitrella (T:P). In the Biological category the most striking differences in GO
representation of Tortula clusters occurs in categories
where the percentage representations are relatively low
but the numbers of clusters are substantial. In the level 4
relationship, Photosynthesis, the representation for Tortula is 3.31% compared to 1.38% for Physcomitrella, a 2.4
fold difference, the majority of which is accounted for by
the difference in the representation levels for the light
reaction category. The rapid recovery of photosynthesis is
critical for the recovery of bryophyte cells, particularly in
regards to the production of energy and reducing power
for the metabolic activity associated with repair and
reconstitution of the gametophytic cells. Chloroplast
structure in Tortula is severely disrupted, especially if desiccation occurred rapidly, in the first few hours following
rehydration [36,40] but recovers quickly. The difference
in representation in this category is consistent with these
observations and thus may reflect the greater need for a
supply of a diversity of photosynthetic components in
rehydrated Tortula than in Physcomitrella cells that have
not experienced a disruption in the photosynthetic
apparatus. Similar inferences can be made concerning the
differences in representation observed for carbon utilization (T:P of 2.0) and oxidative phosphorylation (T:P of
2.1) for Tortula in that mitochondrial activity and integrity
are also compromised during rehydration [25,36]. Other
differences in representation between Tortula and Physcomitrella mappings relate to a higher representation for
Tortula in the categories that relate to responses to external
stimuli and responses to stress both of which would seem
consistent with the emphasis that cellular activity for Tortula would have in comparison to unstressed Phys-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/89

comitrella cells. In particular the increased representation
within the response to oxidative stress is of note, as an elevated protection of cellular integrity from the damaging
reactive oxygen species (ROS) typically associated with a
desiccation rehydration event is a distinctive component
of desiccation tolerant bryophytes when compared to
their desiccation sensitive relatives such as Physcomitrella
[41].
The above observations concerning the more extensive
representation of clusters within the GO mappings related
to organelle function in Tortula are mirrored in the Cellular Component Level 2 classification mappings. In the
Cellular Component classification Tortula exhibits an
almost two fold difference in representation within categories associated with either the chloroplast or mitochondria, such as Extrachromsomal DNA (T:P of 1.8),
Thylakoid (T:P of 1.8), Mitochondrial membrane (T:P of
1.9), and both Inner and Outer membranes (T:P of 1.8).
In this case the categories are generally related to genes
representing membrane components and since it is the
organelle membranes that exhibit the majority of the
damage during desiccation and rehydration it is consistent that these categories would be better represented in
the Tortula cluster mappings than those for Physcomitrella.
In addition to the organellar related classifications the
Tortula clusters also exhibit a higher representation within
the Ribonucleoprotein complex category (T:P of 1.8)
which in all likelihood reflects an emphasis on ribosomal
components since a similar difference in representation is
seen in the Structural Constituent of the Ribosome category (T:P of 2.0) within the Molecular Function Level 2
classification. Again such differences in representation in
the comparison between Tortula and Physcomitrella GO
mappings are consistent with our previous studies on the
responses of Tortula gametophytes to desiccation and
rehydration and comparisons to non-stressed bryophyte
tissues. Protein synthesis is critical to the recovery of Tortula cells following a desiccation event [11,13,15] not
only for the synthesis of proteins damaged by the stress of
desiccation but also directing the response to the stress at
the level of gene expression [26,29]. Early studies determined that the speed at which desiccation occurred has a
marked effect on both the rate of recovery of protein synthesis and the rate at which either new ribosomes are
formed or pre-existing ones are repaired [42,43], rapid
desiccation results in a more prolonged recovery of normal protein synthetic levels and also slows the reconstitution of ribosomes upon rehydration. Since the Tortula
clusters are derived from ESTs of rehydrated moss that was
dried rapidly, the greater representation in ribosome
related GO mappings for this collection compared to the
Physcomitrella clusters, that represent transcripts from cells
where presumably normal ribosomal turnover and synthetic rates are prevalent, is consistent with the biological

state of the Tortula cells. The emphasis on protein synthesis in rehydrated Tortula cells compared to those of Physcomitrella is also evident in the comparison of
representations within the Translation regulator, Translation factor, and Translation elongation factor activity GO
mappings.
Other differences seen in the Molecular function classification, such as the greater representation within the Tortula collection of clusters involved in Two-component
Sensor or Channel/pore class Transporter activity designated mappings, offer novel possibilities for investigation
into rehydration metabolism that have not been indicated
as important until now. The individual identity of the
clusters that map to these categories should offer possible
hypotheses that can be tested in our future research.
Functional classification based on KEGG analysis
An alternative classification of clusters, based on biochemical function, involves the use of HT-GO-GAT to
assign clusters to individual Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/
kegg2.html) metabolic pathways. Of the 2203 clusters
that map within the GO hierarchy only 642 clusters had
assigned EC numbers generating 325 unique mappings
(see additional file 1: KEGG biochemical pathway mappings for Tortula rehydration clusters). The paucity of EC
assignments limits this aspect of the analysis but the mapping of clusters to the KEGG metabolic pathways still
presents some useful perspectives on the metabolic
emphasis of the rehydrated gametophytic cells. Eighty-six
of the 123 pathways contained within the Metabolism
category (metabolic pathways), were represented by
84.6% of the 642 Tortula clusters. The KEGG metabolic
pathways that are well represented by Tortula clusters are
Carbohydrate Metabolism (83 enzymes represented),
Amino Acid Metabolism (72 enzymes), Energy Metabolism (40 enzymes), Lipid Metabolism (27 enzymes), and
Metabolism of Cofactors (24 enzymes). All of these pathways have been previously associated with the cellular
recovery processes associated with rehydrated moss gametophytes [14,15]. Within the metabolic activities not represented by the Tortula clusters only the lack of ascorbate
metabolizing enzymes appears unusual as ascorbate has
been well documented as an important metabolite in the
protection of moss gametophytes from oxidative damage
during stress. This however appears to be the result of a
limitation in the assignment of EC numbers since several
Tortula clusters show significant similarities to enzymes
involved in ascorbate metabolism in the original BLASTx
search used to generate the GO mappings. The limitation
of the KEGG based classification can also been seen in the
poor representation of Tortula clusters in the other KEGG
pathways (Genetic Information Processing, Environmental Information processing, and Cellular Processing)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/89

which is surprising given the number of clusters that were
identified in the BLASTx search and in the GO databases
as being contained within these classifications. As an
example, none of the 239 clusters that map in the GO
hierarchy as structural components of the ribosome
(Table 4) or any of the clusters that mapped to transcriptional and translational components were contained in
the corresponding KEGG pathways. Thus although useful
information can be gleaned from the KEGG classification
system and metabolic pathway mappings, especially in
practical terms for functional studies using individual
clusters, it has some major limitations for drawing any
broad based hypotheses from the representation of Tortula
clusters within each pathway.
ORF based assessment of Tortula clusters
Of the 5,563 consensus cluster sequences used in the
BLASTx search of our database (see above) 40.3% failed to
exhibit sufficient similarity (did not meet set criteria, see
above) with known sequences to allow for an accurate
annotation of the cluster. It is possible that these contigs,
rather than containing novel amino-acid coding regions,
contain mainly 3' or 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) or
coding regions that are so short as to render them incapable of generating a significant similarity score. In order to
investigate this possibility we examined the three classes
of contigs, those with significant similarity scores; "good
hits", those that generated poor similarity scores; "false
hits", and those that failed to generate any scored similarity; "no hits", to determine the longest open reading frame
(ORF). We limited the ORF determination to those clusters that contain an AUG codon in the 5' to 3' direction of
the clone in any one of the three possible reading frames
(the cDNAs were directionally cloned). The results of this
analysis are shown in Figure 2. Of the 5,563 clusters generated in the study, 4,789 generated ORFs under the limitations imposed by the analysis. Of these 2,983 were
classified as "good hits", 1,564 as "false hits" and 242 as
"no hits". Those clusters that are classified as "good hits"
exhibit ORFs that are in general evenly distributed from
20–40 amino acids long to 220–240 amino acids long.
The clusters that are classified as "false hits" from the
BLASTx search do have a relatively larger proportion of
shorter ORFs, in the 20–40 and 40–60 amino acid range
but also a substantial proportion that are much longer.
The distribution of ORFs in this category ('false hits")
does not appear to be sufficiently skewed from that for the
"good hit" clusters to render them incapable of generating
similarity scores in the BLASTx search. This would suggest
that these clusters do contain novel amino acid sequences
that are not represented in the public protein databases by
sequences sufficiently similar to generate significant HSP
Bit scores. In addition, the distribution of ORFs in the "no
hit" cluster category are distributed in a similar manner to
those of the "good hit" classification and so are also likely

acid sequences. The clusters contained within the "false
hit" and "no hit" categories are of particular interest in our
search for novel genes and pathways that are associated
with the ability of certain plants to acquire vegetative desiccation tolerance.
Conserved gene comparison to Physcomitrella and
Arabidopsis
In this analysis the Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis databases were independently used in a BLASTx search using
the 5,563 Tortula clusters as query sequences. Even though
we used the entire 5,563 cluster sequences as individual
queries only 3,321 actually represent sequences that could
be annotated using the criteria for similarity discussed
previously. When the Tortula clusters were used as queries
against the Physcomitrella database, 5,554 generated HSP
Bit scores however only 282 exhibited a level of conservation of sequence that passed the criteria established for
annotation of our Tortula clusters (HSP Bits score above
70 and or E values of 10-7 or less, see above). Against the
Arabidopsis database only 927 Tortula clusters generated
HSP Bit scores but 612 had a level of conservation sufficient to be considered reliable matches to Arabidopsis
genes. These observations are difficult to rationalize and

may simply reflect the inequality of the target databases.
The Physcomitrella database, which is generated from a relatively small EST collection, is much smaller than that for
Arabidopsis, which is gleaned from the full genomic
sequence. This may explain why although most Tortula
clusters generated HSP Bit scores only a relative few were
capable of producing scores sufficiently high enough, and
with low enough error probabilities, for confident assignment of co-identity with a Physcomitrella contig. Obviously Tortula ruralis is more closely related to
Physcomitrella patens, as they are both bryophytes, than to
Arabidopsis thaliana but the phylogenetic distance between
the two bryophytes is still substantial, which may also
help explain the paucity of high value matches and the
large number of low value hits. The Arabidopsis database is
much more comprehensive and would be expected to
generate more significant matches as observed and perhaps because of the evolutionary distance between the
two plants more queries that do not generate an HSP.
The twenty gene products that exhibit the highest level of
conservation for both comparisons, Physcomitrella (E values of 0 to -39) and Arabidopsis (E values of 0 to -55) are
presented in Table 6. Several common highly conserved
genes are present in both comparisons, including genes

photosynthesis related protein between Tortula and Physcomitrella is a chlorophyll a/b-binding protein which generates a HSP Bit score of 205 and E value of 3.0E-53, the
Arabidopsis counterpart generates a HSP Bit score of 82 and
E value of 8.9E-15. In this case the level of conservation of
this protein within the comparisons appears to reflect the
phylogenetic relationships that exist between the three
plants. However, the most conserved photosynthesis
related protein between Tortula and Arabidopsis is a photosystem I P700 apoprotein A2 which generates a HSP Bit

score of 1120 and E value of 0, the Physcomitrella counterpart generates a HSP Bit score of 34 and E value of 1.25E1, which appears contrary to what is expected at what is
seen for the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein. This type of
relationship is also seen for the Ribulose 1 protein (Cluster 2170) that is conserved between Tortula and Arabidopsis but only to a low degree with the Physcomitrella
counterpart. If such relationships can be substantiated
with further study and complete sequences (both the Tortula and Physcomitrella clusters are based on ESTs) then
some interesting evolutionary questions can be raised
concerning both gene function and selection pressures on
the individual plants and metabolic processes.

Conclusions
Bryophytes have an important and underestimated place
in the study of plant responses to water deficits, in particular desiccation tolerance. Bryophytes occupy what we
believe to be one of the most primitive states, along with
algae, in the evolution of desiccation tolerance and represent, in all probability, the stage in the emergence of
plants from a fresh water environment to occupy the various niches available on dry land [13]. Unfortunately, it is
only with the advent of the development of Physcomitrella
patens as a model plant for molecular genetic studies, fired
by its particular ability to perform efficient and homologous recombination in vitro, that bryophyte genomics has
become a topic of some interest. Physcomitrella is rapidly
becoming the model of choice for developmental and
transgenic studies [44] because of its ease of manipulation
and indeed there are plans in place to sequence its
genome [45]. Tortula ruralis on the other hand has long
been established as an attractive model for the analysis of
environmental stress tolerance, in particular desiccation
tolerance, It has been a very useful model in assessing
structural, physiological, biochemical and genetic (gene
expression) aspects of severe dehydration of plant cells
and mechanisms by which primitive plants respond to
and survive protoplasmic water loss [15,25,46]. The progression of the Tortula model into genomics is a critical
aspect in the development, along with a transformation
system and assessment of its ability for efficient homologous recombination, into a more useful and manipulable
model for understanding desiccation tolerance and the
nature of extremophiles. In addition to the importance of
Tortula for stress biology, the establishment of a second
and contrasting bryophyte model, especially with regards
to genomics, is essential for the validation and usefulness
of the information gained from the analysis of the Physcomitrella genome and the general principles gleaned from
its use as a plant model. It is to these ends that we have initiated this study into the transcriptome of Tortula gametophytes as they respond to a major stress event, in this case
a combination of desiccation and rehydration.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/89

The rehydration transcriptome of Tortula, as defined by
the clusters presented herein, is remarkably consistent
with what we know about the desiccation response for
this bryophyte and its metabolic activity during the first
two hours following rehydration. The GO mapping of the
Tortula clusters enabled a broad look at what cellular activities appear to be emphasized in the rehydrated gametophytes and in agreement with our previous biochemical
analyses highlighted the prominence of the protein synthetic machinery, both in structure and control, membrane structure and metabolism, and the need to
reestablish plastid integrity. These observations were bolstered by the comparative GO analysis using the extensive
EST collection generated for the desiccation sensitive
moss Physcomitrella patens. The GO analysis has also provided fuel for new investigations and hypotheses into the
role of other cellular processes, such as membrane transport, phosphorylation and signal transduction, in the
mechanisms that enable desiccation tolerance in plants.
Signal transduction is especially intriguing with regards to
desiccation tolerance in this bryophyte as it appears to rely
on alterations in translational control to effect a response
to desiccation in contrast to the well characterized transcriptional responses, and associated signaling pathways,
associated with abiotic stress in the Angiosperms [5,7]. In
addition to the functional based analyses, the simple
abundance estimates has also correlated well with previous work and has given further credence to the notion that
LEA proteins may also play a role in maintaining cellular
integrity when water is reintroduced into desiccated plant
tissues. The strong correlation between what is known
about the mechanism for desiccation tolerance employed
by Tortula ruralis and what can be inferred from the analyses of the Tortula rehydration EST collection gives a measure of confidence not only in the value of a bioinformatics
approach to gain a view of a particular transcriptome but
also in the basis for new hypotheses and research directions that are generated from them.
Although the type of analyses presented here are
extremely useful in assessing the types of transcripts
present in a particular tissue at a particular time and in
response to some perturbation, either external or internal
in origin, and generating hypotheses concerning the functional aspects of the transcriptome they are intrinsically
correlative in nature. In order to gain a more direct picture
of the transcriptome and more importantly, with regards
to functional assessments, the "translatome", the bioinformatics must be linked to a detailed expression profile
of the transcripts represented within the ESTs generated to
investigate the particular biological response or mechanism of interest. To this end the clusters described in this
report form the basis of a Tortula gametophyte microarray
designed for the profiling of both the extant transcriptome
and the associated translatome and their response to des-

iccation and rehydration under various conditions. The
array and the experimental design of the expression profiling will allow us to generate a more accurate assessment
of both transcript levels and transcript recruitment into
the protein synthetic machinery during, and recovery
from, desiccation in Tortula ruralis. In combination with
the bioinformatics analyses presented here, the expression
profiling will allow us to generate a more complete picture of the cellular response of a tolerant plant species, an
extremophile, to an extreme abiotic stress event.

Methods
Source material
Tortula ruralis ([Hedw.] Gaertn, Meyer and Scherb), also
classified as Syntrichia ruralis, gemetophytes were collected, harvested, and stored as described previously [27].
For experimental purposes, gametophyte tissue was
hydrated for 48 h to fully recover from dried storage and
trimmed to remove stem material. Rapid-dried moss was
prepared by placing the cropped gametophytes in a closed
atmosphere of 0% relative humidity (RH) on 3-mm filter
paper over activated silica gel in a Petri dish. This drying
regime resulted in the attainment of the air-dried state
within 30 min. The gametophytes remained in this atmosphere overnight to ensure desiccation and prior to library
construction were rehydrated for 2 h in deionized water at
18°C in the light.
Library construction
Total RNA was isolated from the rehydrated gametophytes
by a series of phenol extractions as described by Lane and
Tumiatis Kennedy [47]. PolyA RNA was isolated from the
total RNA fraction by oligo-(dT) chromatography [48],
using DynaBeads oligo-(dT25) (Dynal, Inc., Lake Success,
NY, USA), through two rounds of selection according to
the manufacturer's instruction. The purified polyA fraction was used as a template for double-stranded cDNA
synthesis using the Superscript Plasmid System (Invitrogen Life Sciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The resultant cDNA
population was cloned into the pSPORT1 vector, according to manufacturer's instructions, to construct the unidirectional rehydration cDNA library. Small scale
sequencing of 384 random clones confirmed the directional aspect of the inserts, the plant nature of the source
cDNAs, and the frequency of positive clones. The average
insert length for the library was assessed at 1.2 Kb. A subset of 10, 368 randomly picked positive clones (white in a
blue-white X-Gal/IPTG based screen) were transferred to
individual wells in 384 well plates containing suitable
growth medium for storage, replication, and sequencing.
Sequence analysis
High throughput sequencing of the inserts contained in
the 10,368 individual clones was performed using "rolling circle amplification" of the individual plasmids to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/89

generate suitable sequencing templates at the Joint
Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA, U.S.A. Clones were
sequenced using primers specific for vector sequence
upstream of the multiple cloning site and at the 5' end of
the cDNA insert. The sequences were delivered as primary
binary files (raw trace files), which were then processed
through our sequencing, pipeline as described below.
Sequence preparation
Trace files were entered into SeqMan II and quality screening performed with medium stringency corresponding to
a phred threshold value of 12. Vector searching was performed using the pSPORT™ vector both in forward and
reverse orientations with minimum match length of 7,
connect distance of 3, Maximum register shift of 10, Minimum NW percent match of 90, gap weight of 0 and
length weight of 2. Contaminant screening was performed
with minimum match of 25. Following the quality screening the sequences were exported as a single FASTA file and
polyA tails were removed using a custom PERL script. Several hundred sequences that contained internal polyA
stretches were manually identified. These sequences were
manually edited to remove polyA and trailing sequences.
Contigs
Edited sequences were then entered into SeqMan for
assembly into contigs. Assembly for contigs was
performed with match size of 50, minimum match percentage of 97, minimum sequence length of 100.
Clusters
Consensus contig sequences were exported from SeqMan
as individual files and entered into a separate SeqMan
project and reassembled using the same parameters used
for contigs but with a minimum match percentage of 90.
These were considered clusters.
EST submission
EST submission to GenBank was performed using the
USDA-ARS Livestock Issues Research Unit's (LIRU) High
Throughput-Gene Ontology-Genome Annotation Toolkit
(HT-GO-GAT). HT-GO-GAT can be obtained from the
LIRU website at http://199.133.147.108. A total of 9159
EST sequences were submitted to GenBank and assigned
accession numbers CN200321-CN209479
Functional genetics
Functional annotations, Enzyme commission numbers,
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway assignments were assigned to cluster sequences
using HT-GO-GAT. Consensus sequences derived from
Clusters were entered into the software that utilizes custom BLASTx, RPS-BLAST, and relational mySQL databases
to identify potential functional assignments based upon
sequence and functional domain similarity matching. The

software was set to identify high stringency matches and
the resulting data manually curated using the high
throughput results viewer interface of HT-GO-GAT. HTGO-GAT produces various reports related to given datasets including ORF analysis, KEGG pathway reports and
visualization, and also exports gene ontology association
files. These association files were imported into a mySQL
database and visualized using the USDA-ARS-LIRU's

Authors' contributions
MJO conceived of the study, generated the libraries and
ESTs, annotated the EST database, performed much of the
analyses, interpreted the results, and drafted the manuscript. SED designed the bioinformatics software and
database, performed the sequence alignments, performed
the ORF analysis, and generated the Bryobase website. JZ
coded the HT-GO-GAT software and created the mySQL
database. SAM participated in the design of the bioinformatics and design of the sequence analysis. PRP participated in the design of the database and sequence analysis,
and participated in the annotation of the individual EST
sequences.

KEGG biochemical pathway mappings for Tortula rehydration clusters. An alternative functional classification of clusters based on established biochemical activities of gene products. The classification is
achieved by the use of HT-GO-GAT to assign clusters to individual Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG http://www.genome.ad.jp/
kegg/kegg2.html) metabolic pathways. This file contains the tabulated
results of this classification.
