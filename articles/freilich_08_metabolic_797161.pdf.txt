Abstract
Background: We describe a function-driven approach to the analysis of metabolism which takes
into account the phylogenetic origin of biochemical reactions to reveal subtle lineage-specific
metabolic innovations, undetectable by more traditional methods based on sequence comparison.
The origins of reactions and thus entire pathways are inferred using a simple taxonomic
classification scheme that describes the evolutionary course of events towards the lineage of
interest. We investigate the evolutionary history of the human metabolic network extracted from
a metabolic database, construct a network of interconnected pathways and classify this network
according to the taxonomic categories representing eukaryotes, metazoa and vertebrates.
Results: It is demonstrated that lineage-specific innovations correspond to reactions and pathways
associated with key phenotypic changes during evolution, such as the emergence of cellular
organelles in eukaryotes, cell adhesion cascades in metazoa and the biosynthesis of complex cellspecific biomolecules in vertebrates.
Conclusion: This phylogenetic view of metabolic networks puts gene innovations within an
evolutionary context, demonstrating how the emergence of a phenotype in a lineage provides a
platform for the development of specialized traits.

Background
Comparative genomics studies provide a global view of
the innovations in the gene repertoire within a lineage,
and they are most useful in identifying novel gene families, or families that have been massively expanded. The
comparative analysis of gene families and their lineagespecific expansions thus provide fundamental insights
into the innovations of a gene repertoire for a taxonomic
group under investigation. In many cases, the evolution-

ary expansion of a family, in terms of numbers of genes
within a species, can be directly linked to a characteristic
trait of the lineage. For example, genes that have been
characterized as eukaryotic-specific are mostly involved in
the organization of DNA within the nucleus, the compartmentalization of the cytoskeleton, membrane transport,
the control of the cell-cycle, various regulatory processes,
and RNA splicing [1]. Gene families that have massively
expanded during the evolution of metazoa include many

transcription factors (participating in spatial and developmental differentiation), signaling molecules (acting as
mediators of inter-cellular communication), and adhesion molecules (integrating cell types into tissues) [2].
Many vertebrate-specific genes and gene families are
involved in processes related to defense and immunity
(e.g., the immunoglobulins), as well as the nervous system (e.g., olfactory receptors) [3].
A limitation of this sequence-driven approach is that subtle changes, which do not necessarily involve massive
expansions, cannot, in many cases, be deciphered in such
comparative studies. Nonetheless, this type of change
might reflect an important adaptation of a species to its
environment that cannot be readily detected by sequence
information alone. Examples include the adaptation of
the colobine monkey RNASE1B to the pH environment in
its small intestine, probably as a response to its unique
diet [4]. Another example is the origin of a prokaryotic
NADP-dependent IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) from
an ancestral NAD-dependent IDH, as a response to metabolic demands for growth on acetate [5]. These differences
are virtually indistinguishable at the sequence level.
For enzymatic proteins, the well-studied relationship
between sequence and function allows us to translate
genomic information into relatively concise functional
predictions [6-8]. Therefore, for this class of proteins, we
can easily construct a high-resolution set of functional
predictions for a variety of fully-sequenced species. The
availability of several enzymatic-oriented annotation
schemes permits a sensitive study, where the distribution
of reactions (rather than sequences) in different lineages
can be compared. Prominent enzymatic classification
resources include schemes such as the Enzyme Commission (EC) scheme [9], which links sequence and enzymatic reaction, and metabolic databases [10], such as the
KEGG database [11], which classify enzymatic reactions
into metabolic pathways. As previously shown, the use of
these databases can provide valuable insights into the
relationship between functional innovations in the metabolic-reaction repertoire of a species and lineage-specific
adaptation [12,13]. The classification of the homologous
NAD-dependent IDH and the NADP-dependent IDH into
distinct EC categories (EC 1.1.1.41 and 1.1.1.42, respectively) points to the potential of this approach for identifying lineage-specific functional innovations that did not
necessarily involve massive gene expansion.
Here, we focus on the examination of lineage-specific
innovations during the evolution of the human metabolic
network. Primarily, we aim to gain a better understanding
of the relationship between the evolution of the human
metabolic set and the development of new, tissue-specific
pathways. Several factors indicate that tissue differentia-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/247

tion is, at least in part, accompanied by tissue specialization of metabolism. First, most of the enzymatic genes
have specialized expression patterns and they are not globally expressed across mammalian tissues [14]. Second,
although many of the human enzymes are conserved
between human and prokaryotes, there are still many
human enzymes which are specific to eukaryotic, metazoan, and vertebrate species [15]. The variation of these
enzymes during the evolution of the lineage leading to
human has not been investigated in detail. We used the
KEGG pathway database to describe the metabolic pathways in human, to characterize their evolutionary origin,
and to study the structure of the network these pathways
form. This function-based analysis performed here enables us to use genomic data in order to identify lineagespecific functional innovations, understand their contribution in the wider context of metabolic networks, and
outline the gradual process of species evolution. The main
novelty in this function-based analysis is the provision of
a global view on the evolution of the mammalian metabolic-network.

Methods
Retrieving a set of the human metabolic reactions
The distribution of enzymatic reactions (EC numbers) in
species was retrieved from the KEGG database [11,16]
(Release 41.1). For each reaction, KEGG provides predictions for its occurrence in a collection of 540 species
(including 422 bacterial species, 32 archaeal species, and
86 eukaryotic species). The species distribution of each
reaction was processed by parsing the 'enzyme' file
(downloaded from ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/ligand/
). In total, KEGG provides gene assignment (in at least a
single species) for 2,272 reactions, out of which 971 reactions are predicted to occur in human (4 digit EC numbers).
Retrieving a set of the human metabolic pathways and
linking them to form a network
The classification of reactions into pathways was retrieved
from the KEGG database. KEGG describes diagrams of
142 metabolic pathways, where each pathway is composed of a collection of enzymatic reactions. The pathway-distribution of each reaction was processed by
parsing the 'enzyme' file.

In total, the 971 human reactions are distributed among
117 pathways. The erroneous inclusion of the photosynthesis pathway in this set of 117 pathways indicates that
the occurrence of a pathway in a species cannot be simply
inferred from the presence of one reaction which participates in that pathway. In the photosynthesis pathway,
some of the participating reactions, such as ATP synthase
(EC 3.6.3.14), also participate in other pathways, such as
the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. ATP synthase is a

universal enzyme which is widespread among species and
domains of life, but it takes part in different pathways
across various lineages. This example points to two limiting factors, arising from the structure of the KEGG pathway diagrams, which make the inference of a species'
pathway repertoire based on the species' reaction repertoire a highly non-trivial exercise. First, the reactions are
not necessarily unique to a single pathway, and about half
of the reactions occur in multiple pathways. Second, the
pathways in KEGG are reference pathways â i.e., they are
a composite collection of all relevant reactions found in
all species [17]. Since the pathways in KEGG provide a
collective, rather than a species-specific, view of a pathway
and further, some reactions are shared between several
pathways, the occurrence of a reaction in a species is not
sufficient to infer the occurrence of a pathway in a species.
To address this problem and focus on those pathways
which are pertinent to our analysis, we have considered
only pathways where at least a single human reaction is
either pathway-specific, or vertebrate-specific: the rationale being that each of those reactions is thus either biochemically specific or taxonomically relevant, respectively
(or indeed, both). We have also excluded pathways where
less than three participating reactions were found in the
human species. This results in a set of 78 pathways
detected in human to which 652 human enzymes are
assigned.
The KEGG scheme provides information about the links
between different pathway maps (e.g., the glycolysis pathway is linked with the pentose phosphate pathway). Pathway A and pathway B are linked if a product of a reaction
from pathway A is the substrate of a successive reaction
from pathway B. The information was retrieved from the
.map files downloaded from ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/
kegg/pathway/map. We used this information to construct the network representation of the metabolic pathways in human. Each pathway is a node in the network
and is connected to other pathways according to the links
in the KEGG diagram.
Classification of human reactions and pathways into
phylogenetic groups
All human reactions considered here were further classified into four groups, describing the putative lineage
where those reactions have emerged. This classification
was performed according to predictions in KEGG for the
distribution of reactions in the collection of species (as
described earlier in the section 'Retrieving a set of the
human metabolic reactions'). Vertebrate-specific reactions are those human reactions which are predicted to be
limited to vertebrates; metazoan-specific reactions are
those human reactions which are predicted to occur only
in metazoan species (including metazoan species other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/247

than vertebrates); eukaryotic-specific reactions are those
human reactions which are predicted to be limited to
eukaryotes (including eukaryotic species other than metazoa); universal reactions are human reactions which are
widely distributed in prokaryotic species (found in more
than 10 prokaryotes, either Bacteria or Archaea).
For each pathway, we have estimated its lineage of origin
according to the phylogenetic age of its reaction-members, where pathways were assigned according to the classification of their most ancient unique reaction.

Results
The phylogenetic origin of metabolic reactions in human
The distribution of the human reactions from the 78
selected pathways into the phylogenetic groups is shown
in Table 1. Reassuringly, the distribution pattern obtained
from KEGG is similar to the pattern previously obtained
using a different method based on in-house sequence
comparisons [15]. Both classifications indicate that about
half of the vertebrate reactions are predicted to have a preeukaryotic origin (i.e. universal reactions, according to
our definition â see Methods), forming the previously
reported extensive conserved core of metabolic enzymes
common to archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes [15,18]
(Table 1). The remaining reactions are innovations, specific to more recent lineages (Table 1). The large fraction
of vertebrate-specific reactions, compared to metazoanspecific reactions, is in agreement with a recent study
reporting the extensive gain of metabolic reaction, following vertebrata-invertebrate split [19]. Here, we have used
the KEGG pathway scheme in order to obtain a better view
of the functional contribution of the lineage-specific reactions.
The distribution of phylogenetic groups within pathways
The metabolic pathways in KEGG are classified into 11
super-pathway categories. As a first step, we have summarized the distribution of reactions from the different phylogenetic groups within each super-pathway (Table 1).
The most conserved pathways (where at least 80% of the
reactions are universal) are those involved in the metabolism of nucleotides and several amino acids (including
glutathione and selenoamino acid). The most recent pathways (in which most of the reactions have evolved after
the emergence of the eukaryotic cell) are those involved in
glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (84% of the reactions in eukaryotes â including metazoa and vertebrates;
16% universal) and in the metabolism of complex lipids
(61% of the reactions in eukaryotes â including metazoa
and vertebrates; 39% universal) (Table 1). The large
number of vertebrata proteins involved in the metabolism
of lipids was previously shown, and was related to the participation of these reactions in the biosynthesis hormones
[19].

Numbers in brackets correspond to the number of reactions unique to the pathway, as an indicator of its taxon specificity.

The following step aimed to investigate in detail the classification of reactions into the actual pathways. In total,
78 pathways were selected according to the criteria
described in the Methods section, listed in Table 2. The
pathways are grouped according to the classification of
their most ancient unique reactions in order to have an
estimate of their lineage of origin. As can be seen in Table
2, most pathways are composed of reactions present in
more than one phylogenetic group, where a significant
fraction of eukaryotic, metazoan and vertebrate-specific
reactions (66%, 51% and 40% respectively) are integrated
into pathways that have a universal origin, rather than lineage-specific ones. Only four of the pathways with preeukaryotic origin are composed solely of universal reactions (pentose phosphate pathway, glutathione metabolism, selenoamino acid metabolism, and methane
metabolism). The diverse composition of most pathways
is compatible with previous studies indicating that the
KEGG pathways are not necessarily a single evolutionary
unit, and in many cases they can be divided into several
conserved modules acting as both evolutionary and functional units [20].
A characterization of lineage-specific innovations in the
metabolic pathway repertoire
Of the 78 metabolic pathways identified in human, 44
pathways, more than half (56%), have a universal origin
(Table 2). These universal pathways include mostly pathways involved in sugar, nucleotide, amino-acid, cofactor
and energy metabolism. Such pathways were previously

defined as a metabolic "skeleton", common to all
domains of life [18,20,21]. Not all of the amino acid
metabolism pathways can be classified as universal and
many of them are classified as specific to a more recent
lineage, demonstrating the profound differences in amino
acid metabolism between mammals and bacteria [22].
Pathways which appear to have a eukaryotic origin
include pathways which are involved in the biosynthesis
of characteristic components of the eukaryotic membrane, such as sphingolipids or glycan structures, or pathways involved in inter- and intra-cellular signaling
(retinol metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, GPI
anchor biosynthesis). Many other pathways of a putative
eukaryotic origin are involved in processes which are characteristic of higher taxa including animals, such as androgen and estrogen metabolism, C21-steroid hormone
metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis. In these pathways, the majority of reactions belong to more recent lineage groups, and only a few reactions are specific to
eukaryotes (Table 2).
Pathways which have metazoan or vertebrate origin have
evolved after the transition of the unicellular ancestor of
animals to multicellularity. It is therefore unsurprising
that many of them are involved in tissue-specific activities.
Examples for such activities include neuronal guidance
and differentiation (ganglioside biosynthesis), absorption
of ingested lipids in the gastrointestinal track (taurine
metabolism), cartilage differentiation (chondroitin sul-

fate and kertan sulphate biosynthesis), and blood cell recognition (glycosphingolipid biosynthesis). The evolution
of these eukaryotic-, metazoan-, and vertebrate-specific
pathways and their functional significance is discussed
below.
The evolution of the metabolic network in humans
The human pathways were linked to form a network (see
Methods section) where each pathway is a node. The constructed network is shown in Figure 1. Almost all the pathways, namely 73 out of 78, are linked to form a single
connected network. The core of the network is mostly
formed by universal pathways, where more recent pathways are in many cases added as peripheral extensions.
The centrality of the universal pathways is also indicated
by their average connectivity (4.8 links per pathway),
which is higher than the average connectivity of pathways
with a more novel origin (3.2, 3.5, and 3.4, for pathways
with eukaryotic, metazoan and vertebrate origin, respectively).

With the exception of two pathways (linoleic acid metabolism and selenoamino acid metabolism), all universal
pathways form a connected component of the network
(Figure 1B). The most highly-connected nodes represent
pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism: the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, TCA cycle, and pyruvate
metabolism (20, 17, and 13 edges respectively). Other
highly-connected nodes (at least 10 edges) are two aminoacid synthesis pathways (alanine and aspartate metabolism, glycine serine and threonine metabolism).
When constructing a network only from the lineage-specific pathways, one can observe that, unlike the case of
universal pathways, lineage-specific pathways do not
form a single-component network (Figure 1C). The lineage-specific pathways are clustered into seven single-node
components and seven networks where the number of
nodes ranges between two and seven.
Our analysis demonstrates that the conserved core of
metabolism, reported to be common to all domains of
life, forms a structural core component of the metabolic
network (the universal pathways in Figure 1). Within the
formed network, we observe that lineage-specific pathways are added to the core component of the network in
two characteristic ways: with direct links, or the formation
of peripheral extensions. Lineage-specific pathways which
are involved in amino-acid metabolism are in all cases
linked directly to the universal-core network. Lineage-specific pathways which are involved in lipid metabolism
and glycan biosynthesis are in most cases clustered into a
few network components which are added as external
extensions to the core network of universal pathways (the
sub-networks are marked in Figure 1A). Since the latter

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/247

have a significant contribution to the appearance of mammalian-specific phenotypes, we have studied in detail the
structure of the network formed by the reactions from
these pathways. As discussed below (and demonstrated in
Figures 2, 3, 4), in all these sub-networks the phylogenetic
view of the pathway underlines how gradual accumulation of reactions corresponds to the appearance of lineage-specific phenotypes. The significance of these
pathways to the emergence of the eukaryotic cell and the
appearance of multicellular animals is further discussed
below.
Glycosylation
The classification approach taken here has assigned the Nglycan biosynthesis pathway as universal. This pathway
leads to more recent, lineage-specific pathways (Figure
1A), which are involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins with specialized functions in specific vertebrate tissues. The classification of the pathways correspond with
current knowledge, where the glycosylation of proteins is
considered to have originated in a prokaryotic, pre-compartalized, ancestor and have gradually evolved into a
multi-stages, tissue-specialized process. The individual
reactions and their phylogenetic origins are shown in
greater detail in Figure 2. The evolution of the pathway
provides an example for the contribution of the compartalization of the eukaryotic cell to the appearance of novel
extracellular molecules, and to their further specification
in the tissues of high-animals.

Glycosylation is the attachment of a carbohydrate residue
to a protein [23], and it is the most frequent post-translational modification in eukaryotic species [24]. In mammals, the glycosylation of proteins begins in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the synthesis of a large
oligosaccharide residue (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2), which is
transferred to nascent polypeptide chains (Figure 2). Following its transfer, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 undergoes trimming of the glucose and some of the mannose residues,
first in the ER and then in the Golgi, in order to build it up
again with different sugars to form complex N-glycans
[25].
The evolutionary origin of the mammalian glycosylation
can illuminate the significance of this complex process.
The synthesis of N-linked glycans (which takes place in
the ER) stems from homologous processes in the plasma
membrane of archaea or bacteria [24]. The early stages of
glycosylation are homologous between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes where both use similar mechanisms to transfer
the oligosaccharide residue (yellow boxes in Figure 2). In
contrast, the identity of the oligosaccharide residue is not
conserved between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Whereas
prokaryotic species exhibit a great diversity with regard to

the oligosaccharide used, almost all eukaryotes transfer
the same structure â Glc3Man9GlcNAc2.
In most eukaryotic species, the early steps in N-glycan
processing in the ER are conserved. The addition of further
saccharides to the ancestral oligosaccharide during
eukaryotic evolution is probably driven by the internalization of glycoprotein biosynthesis from the plasma membrane to the ER and the concomitant need to export newly
synthesized proteins to the cell surface [24]. Later modifications of the carbohydrate groups (green/red boxes in
Figure 2) exhibit considerable diversity between species
and cell types [25], whereas the switch from the use of oligomannose (as in yeast) to complex N-glycans (as in
mammals) correlates with the appearance of multicellular
organisms [26].

The importance of complex N-glycans in the evolution of
multicellular species might be related to the role of glycosaminoglycans in the formation of the extracellular
matrix. Though, as can be predicted from their great abundance and structural variety, the functions of proteoglycans in vertebrates are far more diverse. The main groups
of glycosaminoglycans in vertebrates play different roles
in different tissues: Keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate are important structural components of connective
tissues (cartilage and bone); Heparan sulfate regulates
hematopoietic processes; Dermatan sulfate is found
mostly in skin [27].
Glycosphingolipid (GSL) metabolism
In the network of pathways (Figure 1A), the eukaryotic
pathway of sphingolipid metabolism is linked to the core

network via the universal serine metabolism pathway. The
sphingolipid metabolism pathway leads to vertebrate-specific pathways, which are involved in the metabolism of
cell-type specific GSLs â the metabolism of gangliosides
which are characteristic of nerve cells, and the metabolism
of the lactosylceramide series which are characteristic of
groups of blood cells. The classification of pathways corresponds with current knowledge, and provides an example for an eukaryotic innovation (novel membrane
component) which gave rise to the development tissuespecialized characteristics.
Glycolipids are sugar-containing lipids found in the membrane of cells, where in eukaryotic cells, glycolipids are
derived from sphingosine (blue boxes in Figure 3) [28].
The variation in type, number, linkage and further modification of the sugar residues give rise to a combinatorial
variety of GSLs [29]. Different GSL series are characteristic
of different animals, where lactosylceramide is the common precursor for the GSL series found in vertebrates (red

boxes in Figure 3). Different series of lactosylceramidederived GSLs have their unique expression patterns in specific cell types, where blood cells and nerve cells, in particular, have a characteristic composition of GSLs [30].
Biosynthesis of cholesterol
In the network of pathways (Figure 1A), the universal
pathway of sterol biosynthesis leads to pathways that are
involved in process which are characteristic of different
tissue types. The synthesis of cholesterol and its derivates
provides an additional example for a novel eukaryotic
membrane component which in higher animals is used as
a precursor for the synthesis of specialized molecules.

Cholesterol is a lipid present in the membrane of eukaryotes, but not in the membrane of most prokaryotes. In
animals, cholesterol is also a precursor of many signaling
molecules including steroid hormones and bile acids.

Figure 2.
The synthesis of cholesterol is illustrated in Figure 4. In
prokaryotes, the synthesis of sterol had stopped at
squalene [31]. In this ancient pathway (partly represented
by the yellow boxes in Figure 4), which is assumed to have
evolved before the appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere (and before the appearance of eukaryotes),
squalene is hydrated to form hopanoid â a sterol-like
molecule found in the membrane of prokaryote species.
Once aerobic conditions developed, the oxidation of
squalene by O2 gave rise to the formation of genuine precursors of sterols â lanosterol in vertebrates and fungi
(blue boxes in Figure 4), and cyclortenol in plants. The
degradation of those precursors to form sterols may have
paved the way towards the eukaryotic membrane, with its
efficient combination of n-acyl chains and sterol [31].

Derivatives of cholesterol, such as steroid hormones and
bile acid (red boxes in Figure 4), have roles, which are specific to vertebrates. Bile acids are polar derivatives of cholesterol which facilitate the absorption of lipids in the
small intestine. Cholesterol is also the precursor of the
major classes of steroid hormones, which are regulators of
different processes across tissues, including the development of sex characteristics, and the degradation of fat [28].

Discussion
Here, we describe a function-based analysis of the evolution of human metabolic properties. The main novelty in
this analysis is the provision of a global view on the evolution of the mammalian network. While previous studies
have characterized the metabolic "skeleton", common to
all domains of life, or innovations characteristic of one of

Page 11 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:247

the lineages leading to mammals [18,19,21], a global
view of the metabolic innovations in mammals was not
previously reported. Therefore, although the phyletic classification of pathways is in most cases in agreement with
biochemical literature, this study provides for the first
time a comprehensive analysis of the origin of the complement of the mammalian metabolic pathways. Furthermore, this study not only concerns the characterization of
'ancient' and 'novel' pathways but also describes for the
first time the way they are integrated to form a metabolic
network. With the use of pathway maps, it is possible to
view the position of lineage-specific pathways in the biochemical network (i.e., the phylogenetic structure of the
network). Thus, it is possible to uncover the core reactions
of pathways, and the additional inventions during evolution, in a manner consistent with current biological
knowledge. This general approach is applicable to any
species and more complex phylogenies; the analysis also
suggests ways by which this type of evolutionary information can be incorporated into future metabolic databases.
However, the limitations of such an approach should also
be underlined. First, the observations reported here are
highly dependent on the conventions of the reference
database (in this case, the KEGG resource). The classification of reactions into pathways is somewhat subjective,
since it can be implemented in a varied manner. Second,
the characterization of the set of reactions in species, as
well as the classification of reactions into phylogenetic
groups is dependent both on the sensitivity of the homology assignment procedure and the range of species analyzed. Third, this analysis concerns only a limited set of
reactions whose biochemical function and exact position
in the metabolic network are well defined (fully-assigned
EC reactions). Such information is not available for a substantial part of the lineage specific reactions which were
therefore not considered in this work. These performance
issues affect our ability both to reconstruct the complement of the reaction set and to delineate the contribution
of each lineage towards the development of the metabolic
repertoire during evolution. Yet, despite these limitations,
the findings of this analysis are entirely consistent with
current knowledge (as shown in [13] and here); consequently, it is reassuring that the general picture of gradual
evolution with a patchwork of metabolic innovations
related to the physiological needs and capabilities of the
corresponding taxa is very accurate. Moreover, the classification of reactions into phylogenetic reaction sets is generally in agreement with classifications obtained using
different procedures [15]. Finally, as discussed below, the
structural organization of the metabolic network provides
a valuable insight on the gradual evolution of phenotypes
which are characteristic of the lineages studied.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/247

Our analysis indicates that a universal metabolic core vertically inherited from a pre-eukaryotic ancestor remained
highly conserved all the way up to mammals. Compatible
with previous studies which have characterized a universal metabolic 'skeleton' [18,20,21], the universal pathways in humans are mainly involved in the metabolism of
the basic building blocks of every living cell: carbohydrates, lipids, and amino-acids. Only a limited number of
reactions and pathways seem to be specific to eukaryotes,
metazoa and vertebrates. The eukaryotic-specific reactions
are in many cases involved in the metabolism of the complex structures found in the membrane of the eukaryotic
cells, or the membranes of cellular organelles. In metazoa,
these reactions catalyze the first steps in the synthesis of
extracellular molecules, primarily those abundantly
found in multicellular organisms [32]; extracellular proteins participate in all animals in inter-cellular communication and cell adhesion. In reactions specific to
vertebrates, the extracellular molecules provide precursors
for the biosynthesis of more complex molecules, whose
function is in many cases characteristic of a specific cell
type or tissue.

Conclusion
The phylogenetic-structure of the metabolic network,
which is described here for the first time, emphasizes the
gradual evolution of processes which are specific to a tissue, whereas the development of a phenotype in an
ancient lineage provides a platform for the evolution of
more recent traits. As the phylogenetic representation of
the metabolic network puts gene innovations within an
evolutionary context, it demonstrates in a quasi-quantitative manner the importance of events such as the development of the eukaryotic membrane, cellular organelles and
the system of transport between them, towards the emergence of multicellular life. While the basic mechanisms of
inter-cellular communication are common between
invertebrates and vertebrates, many of the vertebrate-specific reactions are involved in tissue-specific functions.
The evolution of these pathways must have coincided
with the emergence of cell types and organs.
Finally, this network approach highlights evolutionary
junctions, at which ancestral species gained the ability to
catalyze a new reaction type or use a new substrate. Examples of such junctions from the analysis performed here
are cholesterol and sphingiosine, molecules whose biosynthesis and function are lineage-specific. The study of
such junctions can contribute towards our understanding
of the co-evolution between enzymes and substrates, and
the mechanisms of biochemical innovation during evolution.
