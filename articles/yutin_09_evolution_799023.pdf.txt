Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) encode most if not
all of the enzymes involved in their DNA replication. It has been inferred that genes for these
enzymes were already present in the last common ancestor of the NCLDV. However, the details
of the evolution of these genes that bear on the complexity of the putative ancestral NCLDV and
on the evolutionary relationships between viruses and their hosts are not well understood.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of the ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent DNA ligases encoded
by the NCLDV reveals an unexpectedly complex evolutionary history. The NAD-dependent ligases
are encoded only by a minority of NCLDV (including mimiviruses, some iridoviruses and
entomopoxviruses) but phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated that all viral NAD-dependent ligases
are monophyletic. Combined with the topology of the NCLDV tree derived by consensus of trees
for universally conserved genes suggests that this enzyme was represented in the ancestral
NCLDV. Phylogenetic analysis of ATP-dependent ligases that are encoded by chordopoxviruses,
most of the phycodnaviruses and Marseillevirus failed to demonstrate monophyly and instead
revealed an unexpectedly complex evolutionary trajectory. The ligases of the majority of
phycodnaviruses and Marseillevirus seem to have evolved from bacteriophage or bacterial
homologs; the ligase of one phycodnavirus, Emiliana huxlei virus, belongs to the eukaryotic DNA
ligase I branch; and ligases of chordopoxviruses unequivocally cluster with eukaryotic DNA ligase
III.
Conclusions: Examination of phyletic patterns and phylogenetic analysis of DNA ligases of the
NCLDV suggest that the common ancestor of the extant NCLDV encoded an NAD-dependent
ligase that most likely was acquired from a bacteriophage at the early stages of evolution of
eukaryotes. By contrast, ATP-dependent ligases from different prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources
displaced the ancestral NAD-dependent ligase at different stages of subsequent evolution. These
findings emphasize complex routes of viral evolution that become apparent through detailed
phylogenomic analysis but not necessarily in reconstructions based on phyletic patterns of genes.

Background
Viruses are ubiquitous parasites of all cellular life forms.
In recent years, extensive genome sequencing and comparative analysis of both viral and host genomes yielded
unprecedented insights into the evolution of viruses. In
particular, it has been shown that 4 diverse families of
large DNA viruses of eukaryotes (NCLDV), namely, Poxviridae, Asfarviridae, Iridoviridae, and Phycodnaviridae,
share a set of conserved genes with functions implicated
in replication, transcription and virion morphogenesis,
suggesting an origin from a single ancestral virus. This
apparently monophyletic class of viruses was denoted
Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) to
emphasize the presence of a cytoplasmic stage in the
reproduction of most if not all of these viruses [1]. The
existence of such a cytoplasmic stage, during which virus
replication is physically separated from the replication
and expression of the host genome, and occurs in cytoplasmic viral "factories"[2,3], can be reasonably thought
of as the driving force behind the retention of genes
encoding replicative proteins in the NCLDV genomes. The
analysis of subsequently sequenced genomes representing
3 additional viral families, namely, Ascoviridae, Mimiviridae, and very recently, a novel family typified by the Marseillevirus, strongly supported the conclusion on the
monophyly of the NCLDV [4,5]. The reconstruction of the
ancestral NCLDV gene set using a maximum parsimony
method[4] or a more sophisticated maximum likelihood
approach [6] led to the delineation of a set of 40-50 ancestral genes that include the genes for the key proteins
required for genome replication, expression and virion
morphogenesis.
One of the most dramatic revelations of comparative
genomics is that the set of universal genes (defined in
terms of orthologous gene sets) in all life forms is much
smaller than the set of universal molecular functions
[7,8]. The principal underlying cause is non-orthologous
gene displacement (NOGD) whereby the same essential
function is performed by unrelated or at least not orthologous genes [9]. Often, especially among prokaryotes,
NOGD is coupled to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of
the respective genes. Owing to NOGD and HGT, phyletic
patterns (that is, patterns of presence-absence in
sequenced genomes) are complex, diverse and patchy for
the majority of genes, even those involved in essential
functions [10,11].
The case of viral genes is especially complicated because
many viral functions can be complemented and replaced
by functionally analogous host proteins that may or may
not be homologous to the respective viral proteins; additionally, many viruses integrate host genes into their own
genomes, so the functional repertoire of viral genes
evolves in an incessant, dynamic interaction with the host

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/51

gene repertoire. For instance, the RNA polymerase
holoenzyme is obviously essential for the expression of
any DNA genome. However, many large DNA viruses
including certain NCLDV (such as some of the phycodnaviruses) that replicate in the cell nucleus (as well as herpesviruses and baculoviruses) do not encode any RNA
polymerase subunits and fully rely on the host transcription machinery [4]. The DNA replication apparatus of the
NCLDV is substantially autonomous from the host replication system. All sequenced NCLDV genomes contain
genes for 3 essential replication enzymes, namely, DNA
polymerase, primase and distinct replicative helicase (the
latter two genes typically are fused to produce a twodomain primase-helicase). However, other proteins that
are also essential for replication, in particular, DNA ligase
and (predicted) flap endonuclease, are found only in subsets of the NCLDV, with the implication that viruses that
lack these enzymes employ host analogs [4]. Very
recently, this proposition was experimentally validated
for the vaccinia virus (VACV) DNA ligase [12]. The DNA
ligase gene of VACV can be knocked out with minimal or
no adverse effect on virus growth in cell culture [13].
However, inhibition of the mammalian DNA ligase I but
not any of the other 2 human ligases (III and IV) with a
siRNA specifically abrogated the growth of the ligase
knockout virus indicating that this host ligase was specifically recruited for VACV replication [12].
The DNA ligases of the NCLDV seem to epitomize the
haphazard aspect of viral genome evolution. Some of the
NCLDV encode ATP-dependent ligases that, among cellular life forms, are ubiquitous and essential for replication
in archaea and eukaryotes, but are only sporadically
found in bacteria where they seem to contribute to distinct forms of DNA repair [14-16]. Furthermore, the
ligases of chordopoxviruses show extensive sequence similarity to mammalian ligase III [17]. Another subset of the
NCLDV encode NAD-dependent ligases that are distantly
related to the ATP-dependent ligases [18,19] and are ubiquitous and essential for replication in bacteria but represented only sporadically in archaea and eukaryotes
[16,20]. Finally, a considerable fraction of the NCLDV do
not appear to encode any ligases.
The reconstruction of the NCLDV genome evolution tentatively placed the ATP-dependent ligase into the last
common ancestor, with the implication that in some lineages the putative ancestral ligase was lost, whereas in others it was replaced with the NAD-dependent ligases [4].
However, we were interested in applying phylogenetic
methods along with comparative-genomic analysis, with
the aim to reconstruct the history of the NCLDV ligases in
greater detail and more definitively. The results of this
study suggest an unexpected, complex evolutionary scenario.

Results and Discussion
Distribution of DNA ligases across the NCLDV genomes
We start with a census of DNA ligases encoded in the 45
currently available NCLDV genomes. Considering that
some members of the ATP-dependent ligase family, particularly, in bacteria, show extreme sequence divergence
[21], we searched all protein sequences of NCLDV with
position-specific scoring matrices derived from multiple
alignments of both ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent
ligases. The ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent ligases
show a perfect complementary pattern among the
NCLDV, that is, not a single viral genome encodes both
forms. Quantitatively, the ATP-dependent ligase is more
common, being encoded by the majority of chordopoxviruses and phycodnaviruses, and the single available
genomes of asfarvirus and Marseillevirus (Table 1). The
distribution of the NAD-dependent ligases appears to be
more scattered as they are encoded by entomopoxviruses
and a single chordopoxvirus (Crocodilepox virus that,
however, encodes a truncated version of the NADdependent ligase that may or may not be active), mimi/
mamaviruses, and a minority of iridoviruses (Table 1).
Viruses lacking any ligase gene are found in all extensively
sampled NCLDV families, namely, poxviridae, iridoviridae, ascoviridae (so far none of the sequenced genomes in
this family has a gene for a ligase), and phycodnaviridae
(Table 1), suggesting multiple losses during evolution of
the NCLDV.
Phylogenies of the DNA ligases of the NCLDV
To reconstruct the evolutionary scenario for viral ligases,
we used multiple alignments of the NAD-dependent and
ATP-dependent ligases that included the respective protein sequences from the NCLDV, other viruses, and representative archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes (see
Additional File 1 and Additional File 2, respectively), to
build maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees. The
tree for the NAD-dependent ligases contains an unequivocally supported NCLDV clade (Figure 1). Statistical evaluation of alternative tree topologies using the
Approximately Unbiased (AU) test [22] indicated that
trees with polyphyletic NCLDV effectively could be ruled
out (all these alternative topologies had zero AU values).
The NCLDV clade belonged to a branch that included
mostly NAD-dependent ligases from gamma-proteobacteria along with some bacteriophage ligases one of which
clustered with the NCLDV (Figure 1).

In a sharp contrast, the tree of ATP-dependent ligases
showed a scattered distribution of the NCLDV branches
(Figure 2). The chordopoxvirus ligases formed a strongly
supported clade with eukaryotic ligase III as suggested by
the previously noticed high sequence similarity between
these proteins [17]. Although it has been claimed that
ligase III was unique to vertebrates [14], our analysis

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/51

detected clear orthologs in insects, the choanoflaggelate
Monosiga brevicola and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, suggesting that ligase III evolved through a duplication of the ligase IV gene at the onset of evolution of
unikonts but was repeatedly lost in fungi and several animal lineages (Figure 2 and Additional File 3). The NCLDV
ligases clustered with the vertebrate homologs to the
exclusion of the homologs from other unikonts (Figure 2
and Additional File 4). Interestingly, several non-NCLDV
animal viruses with large DNA genomes from the families
Baculoviridae and Nudiviridae also encode a ligase related
to ligase III (Figure 2).
The ATP-dependent ligase of one of the phycodnaviruses,
Emiliana huxlei virus (representative of the genus Coccolithovirus), belonged to the eukaryotic ligase I branch (Figure 2). The rest of the ATP-dependent ligases of the
NCLDV, namely, those of African Swine Fever virus (the
only available representative of the family Asfarviridae),
phycodnaviruses and Marseillevirus, were scattered
within a large cluster of ATP-dependent ligases of various
bacteria and bacteriophages (Figure 2). The AU test indicated that the tree in which the latter 3 groups of viral
ligases formed a clade could be effectively ruled out as an
likely alternative to the tree in Figure 2 (the alternative
topology with monophyletic NCLDV was associated with
a zero AU value).
Evolutionary scenario for the DNA ligases of the NCLDV
To reconstruct the evolutionary history of the NCLDV
ligases, we combined 3 lines of evidence: i) phyletic distribution of the ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent ligases
among the NCLDV, ii) topologies of the phylogenetic
trees for the NAD-dependent ligases (Figure 1) and ATPdependent ligases (Figure 2), iii) the "species tree" of the
NCLDV for which we used the consensus of the trees for
conserved NCLDV genes (Figure 3) [6]. Of these, the species tree is arguably the weakest link given that there are
few genes that are conserved in all NCLDV, and the topologies of the individual trees of these genes are not identical, so a consensus had to be derived to produce the tree
topology in Figure 3[6]. Nevertheless, the topology of the
consensus tree is mostly compatible with that of a tree
derived by comparison of phyletic patterns, suggesting
that the consensus tree is a reasonable representation of a
central trend in the evolution of the NCLDV genomes [6].
Under this assumption, we superimposed the phyletic
patterns of the ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent
ligases onto the species tree and invoked the tree topologies of both ligases to infer the evolutionary scenario (Figure 3). Under this scenario, the ancestral NCLDV
possessed a gene for an NAD-dependent ligase that was
replaced with an ATP-dependent ligase on multiple, independent occasions. Formally, an alternative hypothesis
[23] cannot be ruled out, namely, that the NAD-depend-

ent ligase gene was originally acquired by one of the
NCLDV lineages, perhaps, the mimiviruses which replicate in amoebae where gene exchanges between viral and
bacterial parasites and symbionts appear to be common
[5,24,25]. This scenario implies that the ancestral NCLDV
encoded no ligase, like many extant viruses. However, the
monophyly of the NAD-dependent ligases from 3 distinct

NCLDV lineages (Figure 1), taken together with the
polyphyly of the ATP-dependent ligases (Figure 2), favors
the scenario of ancestral capture of the NAD-dependent
ligase (Figure 3). Indeed, the alternative would require
multiple gene transfers between viruses infecting phylogenetically distant hosts, apparently, not a particularly plausible possibility.

The specific sources of the NCLDV ligases are difficult to
pinpoint with certainty but the trees in Figures 1 and 2
provide clues. The clustering of NAD-dependent viral
ligases with homologs from (primarily) gamma-proteobacteria and bacteriophages (Figure 1) suggests that the
viral ancestor of the NCLDV captured the ligase gene from
a bacteriophage, perhaps, one that infected the mitochondrial endosymbiont. This scenario is compatible with the
hypothesis that the NCLDV evolved concomitantly with
eukaryogenesis [4]. Indeed, the acquisition of the ligase

gene was most likely an early event considering the rapid
degradation of the mitochondrial endosymbiont [26].
The tree of ATP-dependent ligases (Figure 1) suggests that
they displaced the ancestral NAD-dependent ligase on
several independent occasions and at different stages of
viral evolution (Figure 3). Early replacements of the ancestral NAD-dependent ligase by ATP-dependent ligases of
bacterial or bacteriophage origin apparently occurred
independently in phycodnaviruses, Marseillevirus, and
asfarviruses. By contrast, later displacements of the NAD-

dependent ligases with ATP-dependent ligases of eukaryotic origin seem to have occurred in Emiliana huxlei virus
and in chordopoxviruses. In particular, ligase III apparently was acquired by chordopoxviruses not only after the
radiation of the entompoxviruses and chordopoxviruses
(probably concomitant with the radiation of the host animals) but some time into the evolution of chordopoxviruses themselves, given that the earliest branching group
in this subfamily, crocodile pox virus, still has an NADdependent ligase (Table 1 and Additional File 1). Considering the absence of genes for any ligases in many extant
NCLDV and the lack of genomes encoding both an NADdependent and an ATP-dependent ligase, it seems likely
that the displacements occurred via a ligase-less intermediate as opposed to an intermediate encoding both types
of ligases.
Both the major form of bacterial and bacteriophage NADdependent ligase (LigA) and eukaryotic ligase III possess a
C-terminal BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domain that mediates interactions with components of various protein
complexes involved in repair and cell cycle control[27,28]. The BRCT domain is present in the NADdependent ligases of the mimiviruses and iridoviruses but
is missing in the NAD-dependent ligases of entomopoxviruses and the ATP-dependent ligases of chordopoxviruses,
the apparent origin of the latter from ligase III notwithstanding. Thus, acquisition of cellular ligase genes by distinct NCLDV lineages was accompanied by independent
but analogous truncations of the acquired gene.

Concluding remarks
The phylogenomic analysis described here led to unexpected conclusions. Although ATP-dependent ligases are

more common among the NCLDV than NAD-dependent
ligases, it is the latter that can be traced back to the last
common ancestor of the NCLDV whereas the ATPdependent ligases apparently were acquired by several
viral lineages at different stages of their evolution. The
most general message brought about by these findings is
that phyletic patterns alone, at least, in some cases, are
insufficient for an accurate evolutionary reconstruction
and can lead to substantially oversimplified or even false
scenarios.
More specifically, the study of the evolution of viral ligases
has general implications for understanding the evolution
of the NCLDV. The apparent acquisition of the NADdependent ligase gene at an early stage of evolution antedating the last common ancestor of the NCLDV is compatible with the scenario of the origin of eukaryotic
viruses by assembly of genes from diverse sources including bacteriophages and bacteria in the course of eukaryogenesis [29]. The apparent independent displacement of
the NAD-dependent ligase by ATP-dependent ligases of
bacterial/bacteriophage origin in several NCLDV lineages
implies that the primary radiation of the NCLDV occurred
at the earliest stages of the evolution of eukaryotes, conceivably, prior to the radiation of eukaryotic supergroups
and before the process of mitochondrial reduction was
completed. A similar interpretation of the NCLDV evolution was given previously on the basis of the examination
of the host ranges of the major lineages of these viruses
[4]. Phylogenomic analysis of other conserved NCLDV
genes has the potential to further clarify the evolutionary
scenario and, possibly, the origin of this important class
of viruses.

Methods

Reviewers' reports

The non-redundant protein sequence databases at the
NCBI were searched using the BLASTP and PSI-BLAST programs with the expectation (E) value for sequence inclusion in PSI-BLASt iterations set at 0.005 [30]. The
sequences for phylogenetic analysis were aligned using
the MUSCLE program with the default parameters [31].
To eliminate poorly aligned regions, each alignment column was assigned a homogeneity value by scaling the
sum-of-pairs score within the column between those of a
homogeneous column (the same residue in all aligned
sequences) and a random column (YIW, I. A. Seledtsov, K.
S. Makarova, unpublished). Columns with homogeneity
of less than 0.2 and/or with more than one-third of gap
characters were removed from the alignment.

Reviewer 1: Patrick Forterre, Institut Pasteur
The origin of viral genes is presently a hot topic of discussion. Some authors consider that all viral genes originated
from cellular genes robbed by viruses whereas others
emphasize that new genes can also appear in viral lineages
and be transferred later on from viruses to cells. Phylogenies combining viral and cellular genes are indeed often
difficult to interpret, especially the direction of transfer,
and the interpretation can be strongly dependent of the
prejudice of the author. This paper is an example of such
case. Eugene Koonin has recognized in a previous paper
the existence of specific viral genes (hallmark genes) that,
according to him, even originated before cells, in a primordial hydrothermal vent [29]. However, he is also a
proponent of the idea that eukaryotes and their viruses
originated after the emergence of Archaea and Bacteria
from this primordial vent [29]. In this scenario, eukaryotes originated by the association of an ancient bacterium
and an ancient archaeon, and eukaryotic viruses originated by combining genes of bacterial and archaeal
viruses together with eukaryotic genes from their hosts. In
this scenario, genes present in eukaryotic viruses could
not have originated directly from the ancestral viral world,
but should have originated either from prokaryotic
viruses or from the virus hosts. As a consequence, the
authors systematically favour in this paper transfers from
cells to viruses to explain the origin of NCLDV ligases.

Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were constructed using the TreeFinder software [32], with the estimated site rates heterogeneity and the WAG (Whelan and
Goldman) substitution model [33]. The Expected-Likelihood Weights [34] of 1,000 local rearrangements were
used as confidence values of TreeFinder tree branches. The
Approximately Unbiased (AU) test of tree topologies [22]
was applied using TreeFinder [32].

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Authors' contributions
EVK initiated and planned the study, and wrote the manuscript; NY analyzed data; the final manuscript was read
and approved by both authors.

I have a different prejudice. I think that most core genes of
NCLDV are viral hallmark genes that originated directly in
ancient viral lineages. Furthermore, I suspect that NCLDV
proteins involved in replication might have played an
important role in the origin of modern eukaryotic DNA
genomes [35]. I thus favour the possibility of ancient LGT

from NCLDV to eukaryotes. The phylogenies presented in
this paper do not really allow to decide between these different interpretations but raises interesting questions.
An important point, in my opinion, is to determine, if
possible, which ligase (s) was (were) present in the last
common ancestor of each of the three domains. This is
missing in the manuscript. To my understanding, the
ancestral bacterium should have contained an NADdependent DNA ligase. It should thus be important to
present a more exhaustive tree of bacterial NAD ligase in
Figure 1, with their distribution among the various bacterial divisions, to clarify this point. For me, the tree in Figure 1 suggests that several subfamilies of NAD ligases were
already established before one of them was recruited in
the bacterial domain. This tree suggests also the existence
of several subfamilies presently encoded by bacterioviruses and distantly related to the NCLDV DNA ligases. For
me, it fits very well with the idea that the bacterial DNA
ligase has a viral origin, and that Bacteria on one side,
Archaea/Eukarya on the other, recruited independently
their DNA replication machinery from different viruses.
In the case of ATP-dependent ligases, it should be important to determine which ligases were present in the LECA
(the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor), in the ancestor
of Archaea, and possibly in the common ancestor of
Archaea and Eukarya. The trees suggest for me that ATPdependent ligases were in fact recruited several times independently in the three domains. It should be also important to indicate on the tree where are the hosts of
respective viruses. This can sometimes helps to polarize
the direction of transfer. For instance, if the host is not
located at its expected position in the cellular tree, one can
suspect a transfer from the virus to the host.
In these phylogenies, when the authors detect a DNA
ligase gene in Bacteria or Archaea, it would be important
to determine if this is the bona fide ligase of the domain,
or a ligase present in the genome of an integrated virus
and/or plasmid [36]. In other words, it is important to distinguish in cellular genomes those genes that are really
cellular (they were already present in the ancestor of a particular domain or recruited from another cell by LGT) and
those that are in fact viral (present in integrated viruses or
related elements). The confusion between these two kinds
of genes in phylogenies can explain, in my opinion, the
present confusion between networks and trees.
Finally, it should be interesting to have an idea of the
structural differences between the various ligase subfamilies studied here. In my opinion, cellular ligases
(originating from the ancestor of a particular domain)
should be very similar in terms of structure, as it is the case
for instance for DNA gyrase in all Bacteria or Topo II in all

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/51

Eukarya, or else for Topo IB in both Archaea and Eukarya
[37,38]. In contrast, families that diverged from ancient
viral lineages before LUCA should exhibit more structural
differences (as it is the case between DNA gyrase, T4 and
eukaryotic Topo II or else between archaeal/eukayal Topo
IB and bacterial or Poxvirus Topo IB) [37,38].
I thus encourage the authors to consider the two alternative possibilities in the discussion of their results, either
LGT from cells to viruses or from viruses to cells.
Authors' response
We greatly appreciate this review that puts the rather limited
and specific study described in this article into the much more
general context of evolution of viruses and cells, and while
doing so, offers a perspective on these general issues that is
orthogonal to our own view in some important aspects while
congruent in others. There is no need to discuss these concepts
as this was done in several previous publications [29,39,40].
However, a brief summary of the differences is due. The distinction between our position and that of Forterre that is of primary
relevance for the conclusions of this study is the adoption of different scenarios for the origin of eukaryotes. Our position is that
the first eukaryotic cells emerged as a result of engulfment of an
alpha-proteobacterium, the future mitochondrion, by an
archaeon. To the best of our understanding, this scenario is best
compatible both with comparative-genomic results and with
more general considerations stemming from the parsimony
principle [41-44]. This scenario, of course, has critical implications for the origin of viruses infecting eukaryotes: these viruses
are thought to have evolved in a Â« second melting pot of viral
evolution Â», concomitant with eukaryogenesis, through amalgamation of gene from viruses of prokaryotes, bacteria, archaea
and the emerging eukaryote [29]. Under this scenario, the possibility of the origin of any genes of the NCLDV directly from
the primoridal pool of virus-like elements can be safely ruled out
although some of the hallmarks could come from that pool
through viruses of prokaryotes, having never been integral
genomic components of cellular life forms. Acquisition of genes
from the evolving NCLDV by the eukaryotic host remains a possibility but there seems to be no compelling evidence that this
was a major route of eukaryote evolution.

Forterre propounds a different scenario of evolution that
includes a primordial virus world as well but considers eukaryotes to be one of the primary lines of descent in the evolution of
cells [35,45-47]. It is further proposed that original bacterial,
archaeal and eukaryotic cells might have possessed RNA
genomes, whereas the DNA replication machineries were
invented by viruses and independently grafted onto the 3 cell
types [35]. Other authors also have developed evolutionary scenarios under which eukaryotes represent a primordial cellular
lineage, possibly, even the first type of cells to evolve [48,49].
In our view, there is little evidence if any evidence in of the Â«
primordial eukaryotes Â» scenarios (see specifically [50]), so we

Page 11 of 14

Biology Direct 2009, 4:51

cannot really agree that our adherence to the symbiogenetic scenario is a Â« prejudice Â». Nevertheless, we do recognize that a
definitive elucidation of the sequence of events that led to the
emergence of eukaryotes is an extremely difficult task that
requires much additional phylogenomic analysis and might not
be attainable in the near future. Clearly, under the Â« primordial
eukaryotic lineage Â» scenario, viral hallmark genes in the
NCLDV could plausibly originate from the primordial virus
world, and transfer of genes from these viruses to the eukaryotic
hosts potentially could be a major route of evolution. Thus,
interpretation of the phylogenomic analysis of viral genes, to a
large extent, hinges on the choice between the two orthogonal
scenarios for the origin of eukaryotes that cannot be definitively
distinguished at this time.
Having acknowledged this uncertainty, we would like to point
out that the history of the NCLDV ligases elucidated in this
study is poorly compatible with the contribution of viral genes
to the host genomes that is hypothesized by Forterre. Indeed, we
show that viral NAD-dependent ligases are monophyletic and
by implication were probably present in the common ancestor of
the extant NCLDV. However, this class of ligases is only sporadically represented in eukaryotic genomes (it cannot be ruled
out that the respective genes were acquired from viruses
although so far there are no direct evidence of such transfers).
By contrast, ATP-dependent ligases are ubiquitous in eukaryotes but polyphyletic in the NCLDV, a finding that seems to
effectively rule out the origin of eukaryotic ligases from viruses
of this class. Moreover, there are two Â« smoking Â» guns of acquisition of ATP-dependent ligase genes from the hosts by distinct
lineages of the NCLDV, namely, the ligase III homolog in poxviruses and the ligase I homolog in Emiliana huxlei virus.
Finally, we should note that a more extensive (comprehensive)
phylogenetic analysis suggested by Forterre is certainly of interest. However, in this paper, we focus specifically on the history
of the NCLDV ligases; for this analysis, we used representative
sets of ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent ligases from bacteria (and bacterial viruses), archaea, and eukaryotes, so we do
not expect that inclusion of more exhaustive sequence sets
(which complicates the construction of ML trees) would affect
the message.
Reviewer 2: George V. Shpakovski, ShemyakinOvchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian
Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia
The authors have performed a detailed phylogenomic
analysis and reconstructed the history of the DNA ligases
in Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses of eukaryotes
(NCLDV). The study reveals a quite complex evolutionary
trajectory of the enzyme involved in NCLDV' genome replication: although ATP-dependent ligases are approx. 3
times more often present in different NCLDVs and previous studies (Ref. 1 & Ref. 4 in the paper) regarded this type
of enzyme as the one which was present in the ancestral

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/51

NCLDV genome (alone or together with the NADdependent DNA ligase form), the last common ancestor
of the NCLDV probably contained an NAD-dependent
enzyme only (Fig. 3). The novel conclusion reported in
the manuscript is based mostly on the monophyly of both
the NCLDV as a group and all viral NAD-dependent
ligases. The story is nicely presented and interpreted but,
in my opinion, the scenario suggested is not the only one
which could be inferred. Because of clearly demonstrated
polyphyletic origin of the viral ATP-dependent ligases
(Fig. 2), the presence of enzyme of this type in the ancestral NCLDV genome can be effectively ruled out. But the
fourth remaining possibility (that the ancient, primordial
NCLDV genome did not contained its own DNA ligase,
but employed host analogs instead, like 19 out of 45 currently known viruses do) cannot be excluded. Following
this assumption it could be possible to effectively decrease
the total number of evolutionary events (exemplified by
'lost' or 'gain' of the DNA ligases - see Fig. 3 of the manuscript) from 17 events (as it is now in the authors' interpretation) to only 10, which will be more in concord with
the Occam's razor principle. Additional data and further
research will probably clarify the matter.
Authors' response
The hypothesis that the ancestral NCLDV encoded no ligase
was implicit in the original manuscript but in the revision we
made it explicit. However, we also indicate that this scenario is
not particularly plausible, given the monophyly of the NADdependent ligases of the NCLDV, because it would require multiple gene transfers between viruses infecting taxonomically distant hosts. Put another way, although the number of the events
under this scenario indeed could be smaller than under the
ancestral NAD-dependent ligase scenario that we favor, the
nature of the inferred events also should be taken into account.
As some classes of events (such as the well established gene loss)
are more likely than other (such as the dubious gene transfer
between viruses from distant hosts).
Reviewer 3: Igor Zhulin, Joint Institute for Computational
Sciences, University of Tennessee - Oak Ridge National
Laboratory
This is a study of DNA ligases in Eukaryotic Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV). Unlike other
viruses, which exclusively use the host DNA replication
machinery, many of NCLDV encode their own DNA replication machinery. This machinery proves useful when
viruses inhabit the cytoplasm of eukaryotes, rather than
the nucleus. NCLDV have been shown to encode two
types of DNA ligases: NAD-dependent and ATP-dependent. ATP-dependent ligases were known to be more prevalent, but the details of their origins were unknown.
Bacteria predominantly use NAD-dependent ligases,
whereas Archaea and Eukaryotes primarily use ATPdependent ligases. Here authors collected the NAD and

Page 12 of 14

Biology Direct 2009, 4:51

ATP ligases from NCLDV genomes and examined their
distribution patterns as well as their relationships to
homologous enzymes in selected Bacteria, Archaea, and
Eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis of the proteins shows
that all viral NAD-dependent ligases are monophyletic,
whereas viral ATP-dependent enzymes show sporadic distribution throughout the trees. This information along
with distribution patterns mapped onto a viral species tree
built from conserved NCLDV genes support that NADdependent ligases were present in the NCLDV common
ancestor, but were displaced by ATP-dependent ligases on
multiple independent occasions in viral evolution.

This is a very clearly organized manuscript. It addresses a
specific question, and the results support the conclusions.
I'm not as excited about the results as are the authors, but
that is because I do not know much about viruses.

I have one minor question that is more of a personal curiosity than a criticism. The species tree (Fig. 3) is a consensus of the individual trees of conserved NCLDV genes, and
I wonder how this would compared to a tree built from a
concatenated alignment of these genes/proteins?

Authors' response
This issue is addressed elsewhere [5,6]. The differences in
the tree topologies are minor.

My only issue with the paper is the methods section on
sequence identification and alignment. It is too short and
contains no detail whatsoever. There is nothing I can say
that is not illustrated by simply copying it below:
"Protein sequence databases at the NCBI were searched
using the BLASTP and PSIBLAST programs [30]. The
sequences for phylogenetic analysis were aligned using
the MUSCLE program [31]. Poorly conserved positions
and positions including gaps in more than one-third of
the sequences were removed prior to tree computation".

What databases? What cutoffs and parameters? How were
the poorly conserved positions identified?

2.

Providing the necessary methodology details is essential,
especially for a computational paper.
