Ancient Pbx-Hox signatures define hundreds of
vertebrate developmental enhancers

Abstract
Background: Gene regulation through cis-regulatory elements plays a crucial role in development and disease. A
major aim of the post-genomic era is to be able to read the function of cis-regulatory elements through scrutiny
of their DNA sequence. Whilst comparative genomics approaches have identified thousands of putative regulatory
elements, our knowledge of their mechanism of action is poor and very little progress has been made in
systematically de-coding them.
Results: Here, we identify ancient functional signatures within vertebrate conserved non-coding elements (CNEs)
through a combination of phylogenetic footprinting and functional assay, using genomic sequence from the sea
lamprey as a reference. We uncover a striking enrichment within vertebrate CNEs for conserved binding-site motifs
of the Pbx-Hox hetero-dimer. We further show that these predict reporter gene expression in a segment specific
manner in the hindbrain and pharyngeal arches during zebrafish development.
Conclusions: These findings evoke an evolutionary scenario in which many CNEs evolved early in the vertebrate
lineage to co-ordinate Hox-dependent gene-regulatory interactions that pattern the vertebrate head. In a broader
context, our evolutionary analyses reveal that CNEs are composed of tightly linked transcription-factor binding-sites
(TFBSs), which can be systematically identified through phylogenetic footprinting approaches. By placing a large
number of ancient vertebrate CNEs into a developmental context, our findings promise to have a significant
impact on efforts toward de-coding gene-regulatory elements that underlie vertebrate development, and will
facilitate building general models of regulatory element evolution.

Background
Cis-regulatory elements play an essential role in the precise co-ordination of vertebrate development as illustrated by the increasing number of examples where
mutations in such sequences lead to developmental malformations [1-3]. One of the major challenges in modern biology is the deciphering of the regulatory
language, syntax and grammar, encoded in the genome,
that directs spatio-temporally restricted gene expression.
To achieve this requires the identification and functional
characterisation of cis-regulatory elements, followed by
the deconvolution of the TFBSs therein.
Cis-regulatory elements can be predicted by sequence
conservation analysis, as tight clusters of functional

TFBSs can be under strong evolutionary constraint
[4-7]. Alternatively, targeted approaches involving chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) can be used to identify binding-events between specific transcription factors
and DNA [8-10]. These are complementary approaches,
as ChIP analyses are restricted to identifying regulatory
regions that are targets of selected TFs at the particular
time-points chosen for the analysis, whilst sequence
conservation can identify elements irrespective of the
TFs that bind to them or the developmental time-points
at which they act. Sequence conservation can also provide evidence for ancient gene regulatory network
(GRN) interactions that are shared between species.
Comparative approaches applied to vertebrate genomes
have identified a set of putative regulatory elements
showing extreme conservation across mammals (Ultraconserved elements [11]), as well as Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) shared between mammals and

fishes [6,12,13]. These elements are clustered around
developmental genes [6,12] and a large proportion of
CNEs that have been tested in transgenic assays drive
spatially restricted reporter gene expression in mouse or
zebrafish embryos [6,7,14]. Furthermore, a number of
CNEs have been shown to have roles in developmental
diseases [1,15]. Despite their high sequence conservation
between vertebrates, only a minute fraction of CNEs can
be traced back to invertebrate chordates [16]. Thus,
CNEs represent a set of cis-regulatory elements that are
likely to be fundamental during development of the vertebrate body plan and comprise a valuable resource for
deciphering the genomic regulatory code for vertebrate
development.
Phylogenetic footprinting has been successfully implemented to identify TFBSs that play key roles in the
action of individual CNEs [17-19]. However, there have
been very few studies seeking to place large numbers of
deeply conserved CNEs into a developmental context
through using this approach [20,21]. Furthermore,
despite progress having been made identifying key
sequence motifs within vertebrate promoter elements
[22], ancient CNEs have remained somewhat recalcitrant
to systematic motif-identification algorithms, despite
some elegant targeted approaches. Within non-coding
elements conserved amongst mammals, a large number
of long motifs [12-22 nucleotides) [23] and some shorter
motifs [24] have been identified as overrepresented.
However, the majority of these were not matched to any
known factors, nor linked to any patterns of enhancer
activity, so the biological significance of these motifs is
hard to interpret. Recently, an elegant study used a classifier algorithm to identify sequence motifs predictive of
heart enhancer activity in mammalian CNEs [25]. However, mammalian CNEs represent a set of sequences
that only partially overlap with the more ancient mammal-fish CNEs and it is not clear to what extent they
are functionally and mechanistically alike. Studies seeking to identify motifs that contribute to tissue-specific
expression of deeply conserved vertebrate CNEs have
discovered novel motifs associated with forebrain enhancer activity [7,21]. As part of a large-scale project to
characterise the in-vivo enhancer activity of CNEs, Pennacchio et al. [7] used four human-fugu CNEs that
drove forebrain reporter expression in mouse embryos
to identify 6 enriched 5 bp-long sequence motifs. 23 elements enriched for these motifs were tested for enhancer activity, of which 4 were found to drive forebrain
expression - an enrichment for this expression domain
compared to the original enhancer set. Li et al. [21]
characterised 13 CNEs driving forebrain reporter expression in zebrafish embryos, identifying 5 enriched motifs
of 6 bp and demonstrating that these sequences contributed to forebrain enhancer activity. These investigations

go some way towards providing a developmental context
for the CNEs with those motifs, but this is somewhat
limited by the factors that bind to them remaining
uncharacterised. Whilst it is unclear to what extent
ancient vertebrate CNEs are composed of ‘conventional’,
previously characterised TFBSs, candidate motif search
approaches have provided evidence that mammalian
UCEs are enriched for known TFBS motifs [26] and
that ancient vertebrate CNEs associated with genes
involved in CNS development show enrichment for Oct
and Sox motifs [20]. The success of these isolated studies hints that it may be possible to systematically identify functional TFBSs within CNEs by phylogenetic
footprinting.
The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) hails from an
anciently diverging jawless vertebrate lineage, the
agnathans, which split from the jawed vertebrate lineage
550-650 million years ago [27]. We have previously
found a significant number of CNEs that are conserved
between lamprey and jawed vertebrates [28]. We predicted that the relatively low sequence identity between
the lamprey and jawed-vertebrate homologous elements
would facilitate the identification of conserved TFBS
motifs within them. In addition, characterisation of
these motifs could illuminate ancient GRN interactions
common to all vertebrates. Thus, we sought to identify
TFBS motifs in CNEs by performing phylogenetic footprinting, using the lamprey elements as a guide.
Here we identify deeply conserved TFBS motifs for the
Pbx-Hox heterodimer within a cluster of CNEs associated with the meis2 gene. We use in-silico analyses to
demonstrate that jawed vertebrate CNEs and other sets
of conserved vertebrate enhancers are highly enriched in
Pbx-Hox motifs. Using reporter assays in zebrafish and
lamprey embryos, we show that these motifs correlate
with enhancer function in the hindbrain and pharyngeal
arches. These results represent a further step toward decoding vertebrate CNEs, allowing a large proportion of
them to be more firmly placed into a developmental
context and revealing ancient gene regulatory network
interactions for hindbrain patterning that are shared
across vertebrates. Finally, our findings enable us to
hypothesise an evolutionary scenario regarding the role
of many CNEs in the evolution of the vertebrate hindbrain and the branchial region of the head.

Results
A set of meis2 CNEs drive expression in the hindbrain and
cranial ganglia in zebrafish and lamprey embryos

We previously identified a genomic region, downstream
of the developmental gene meis2, containing a number
of CNEs that are conserved between jawed vertebrates
and lamprey [28] (Additional File 1). We grouped these
CNEs into five separate elements (Additional File 2) for

functional testing in a zebrafish tol2 reporter assay [29].
Four of these elements drive discreet and complementary patterns of reporter expression in the hindbrain of
zebrafish embryos, with homologous zebrafish and lamprey elements driving highly similar expression patterns
(Figure 1). These patterns of reporter expression are
consistent with the endogenous expression of meis2 in
the hindbrain [30,31], where Meis proteins play a crucial

Page 3 of 14

patterning role by interacting with Hox and Pbx transcription factors [32,33]. Lamprey and zebrafish CNE
3285 elements both drive GFP expression in the cranial
ganglia and primary neurons of the hindbrain and spinal
cord. CNE 3288 elements of zebrafish and lamprey drive
GFP in neurons of the hindbrain posterior to rhombomere 4 (r4), as shown by comparison to RFP expression
in r3 and r5 in a transgenic line containing RFP under

genome assembly so does not appear in this alignment. B-M, orthologous elements from lamprey (B-G) and zebrafish (H-M) drive similar GFP
expression patterns in the nervous system of zebrafish embryos at 54hpf: element 3285 in the cranial ganglia (arrows) and primary neurons of

comparison with r3r5 RFP expression (D, J); 3299 in the anterior hindbrain - r2-4 for the lamprey homolog (E, F) and r3-4 plus the corresponding
neural crest for the zebrafish homolog (K, L); 329X in the hindbrain and neurons of the midbrain (G, M). N-O , embryonic day 14-15 lamprey
embryos transgenic for lamprey elements 3285 (N) and 3299 (O) show GFP expression in the cranial ganglia (arrowheads) and anterior hindbrain
respectively, consistent with their expression in zebrafish (3285: B, 3299: E). P-Q, dorsal views of the head of lamprey (P) and zebrafish (Q)

the control of a krox20 regulatory element [34]. CNE
3299 elements up-regulate GFP in the anterior hindbrain - r2-4 for the lamprey homolog and r3-4 plus
neural crest migrating into the hyoid pharyngeal arch
for the zebrafish homolog. CNE 329X of lamprey and
zebrafish both drive GFP expression in the anterior
hindbrain and neurons of the midbrain.
We have developed a parallel reporter assay in lamprey
embryos (in submission) to assess the functional conservation of CNEs across vertebrates. Using this assay, we
have tested lamprey CNEs 3285 and 3299 for enhancer
activity during lamprey embryogenesis. In lamprey
embryos, CNE 3285 drives GFP expression in the cranial
ganglia and CNE 3299 in the anterior hindbrain (Figure
1). Thus, for both of these elements, the pattern of
reporter expression driven in lamprey embryos is almost
identical to the pattern driven in zebrafish embryos (Figure 1). This provides compelling evidence that these
CNEs are part of a gene-regulatory network for hindbrain patterning that is conserved across all vertebrates.
Some meis2 CNEs contain deeply conserved Pbx-Hox
TFBS motifs

Because of its clear and specific expression pattern in
the hindbrain of zebrafish and lamprey embryos, we
chose element 3299 as a starting point for the identification of putative transcription-factor binding-sites by
phylogenetic footprinting. A number of studies have
documented a role for the anterior Hox proteins in regulating rhombomere-specific gene expression by binding
as hetero-dimers and -trimers with the TALE-class
homeodomain proteins Pbx and Meis [17,18,35,36].
These complexes bind to characteristic binding-sites
composed of partially overlapping Pbx-Hox half-sites,
frequently in conjunction with a distal Meis/Prep site
[17,18,35,36]. In some cases it has been shown that the
pbx-hox motif is both necessary and sufficient for highly
specific patterns of reporter expression, for instance for
activity of a mouse hoxb1 enhancer in r4 in the mouse

Page 4 of 14

hindbrain [17] and for r4 and pharyngeal arch activity of
a mouse hoxb2 enhancer [36].
We identified two Pbx-Hox motifs within CNE 3299,
conforming to the TGATNNAT consensus [37,38], that
are conserved across all sequenced vertebrate genomes,
each closely associated with conserved Meis motifs
(TGACAG/A) [39] (Figure 2). In the zebrafish sequence,
the first pair of Pbx-Hox and Meis motifs is also preceded by a Pbx-Meis motif (TGATTGACAG/A) [39].
We verified the essential nature of these motifs for
rhombomere-specific activity of the enhancer through
mutagenesis of the zebrafish element followed by reporter assay (Methods). Mutating the first cluster of motifs
(sub1) resulted in a loss of the neural crest expression
of the wild type enhancer and less anteriorly restricted
expression in the hindbrain compared to the wild type
element (Figure 2b, c). Mutation of the second Pbx-Hox
and Meis motif cluster abrogated reporter expression by
this enhancer altogether, whilst a construct in which
both motif clusters were mutated (sub12) also drove no
GFP expression. Interestingly, CNEs 3285, 3288 and
329X were also found to harbour conserved Pbx-Hox
and Meis motifs. Together, the expression patterns of
these elements in the hindbrain (3285, 3288, 3299,
329X), as well as in the pharyngeal arch neural crest
(3299), suggests that these motifs may represent a common feature of CNEs that drive segment-specific expression patterns in the vertebrate hindbrain and pharyngeal
arches.
Pbx-Hox motifs are enriched in CNEs and in other sets of
conserved vertebrate enhancers

In order to address how widespread Pbx-Hox motifs are
across conserved vertebrate enhancers, we performed a
systematic scan for these motifs in vertebrate CNEs. We
searched for instances of the canonical Pbx-Hox motif,
TGATNNAT, that are completely conserved across
CNE multiple sequence alignments. In a set of 246
alignments of CNEs between human, zebrafish, fugu

mutated in elements sub1 and sub2 are indicated below the alignment. B-C, compared to wild-type 3299 expression (B), mutating the first PbxHox and Meis motif cluster (sub1) results in the loss of reporter expression in the neural crest (arrow) and broader expression in the hindbrain
(arrowhead) (C). nc: neural crest.

and lamprey (Methods), we identified 61 conserved
motifs, representing 22 fold enrichment over shuffled
alignments (Methods and Additional File 3). Furthermore, in a set of 4259 gnathostome CNE alignments (of
human, fugu and zebrafish sequences), 712 conserved
motifs were identified; a 9 fold enrichment compared to
shuffled alignment controls.
Further analysis of Pbx-Hox motifs in the gnathostome
set reveals a paucity of cytosines at variable positions 5
and 6 (Figure 3). This is a feature of characterised PbxHox binding-sites, where T, A or G at these positions
contribute to determining the Hox specificity of the binding site [38,40,41]. Furthermore, positions 9 and 10,
immediately 3’ to the canonical Pbx-Hox motif, show
strong bias towards G/T and A/G respectively, thereby
defining a more stringent TGATNNATKR (KR) consensus motif that is also consistent with previously characterised Pbx-Hox binding-sites [17,18,37,38] (Figure 3).
Further analysis of the lamprey and gnathostome CNE
alignment sets results in even stronger enrichment for
this ‘KR’ motif (Additional File 3).
We complemented our ‘bottom-up’ search for PbxHox motifs in CNEs with a ‘top-down’ de novo motif
search using the tool Cis-Finder [42]. Strikingly, one of
the top-scoring predicted motifs identified by Cis-Finder
matches our consensus KR motif for a set of 6, 693
human sequences from the CONDOR CNE database
[43] (’CONDOR CNEs’) (Figure 3, Methods). The KR
motif occurs 562 times in this CNE set, representing a
highly significant enrichment over shuffled versions of
the motif (p = 5.7 × 10-5), and when compared to control genomic regions and the entire human genome
(Table 1, Methods and Additional File 4). Interestingly,
the Meis motif is also significantly enriched in the
CONDOR CNE set (p = 1.0 × 10-4)(Additional File 5).
We then examined the distribution of KR motifs in
other sets of evolutionarily conserved non-coding
sequences. The VISTA Enhancer Browser (EB) [44] contains over 1300 human sequences, around half of which
drive reporter gene expression in mouse embryos at day
11.5. There is a significant enrichment for the KR motif
(p = 0.0033) across the entire dataset compared with
shuffled versions despite the fact that some of the
sequences in EB are not deeply conserved (Table 1).
Finally, we analysed a large set of deeply conserved
human CNEs identified through comparison with the
cartilaginous chimera, Callorhinchus milii [13], and
once again found significant enrichment for the KR
motif (p = 6.2 × 10-5) (Table 1 - ‘Shark CNEs’).
Pbx-Hox motifs are associated with hindbrain and
pharyngeal arch CNE enhancer function

Next, we tested whether Pbx-Hox motifs within CNEs
associate with segment-specific reporter expression in

Page 5 of 14

the hindbrain and pharyngeal arches. To do this, we
assayed 21 zebrafish CNEs containing conserved PbxHox motifs for reporter expression in zebrafish. All of
these CNEs are conserved across gnathostomes, with 11
also identifiable in lamprey (Additional File 2). Elements
were chosen to represent a range of different genes
from the lamprey and gnathostome CNE sets. 12 of
these 21 elements consistently up-regulate patterns of
reporter expression, comprised of 8 from the lamprey
set and 4 from the gnathostome set. It should be noted
that some of the elements from which no consistent
expression patterns were obtained may act as enhancers
in-vivo, but not in our transient transgenic reporter
assay, possibly due to being taken out of their genomic
context. Remarkably, 11 of the 12 GFP-expressing elements (91.6%) drive expression either in the hindbrain,
pharyngeal arches or both, with one element expressing
in the trunk musculature (Figure 4). In support of the
hypothesis that these elements are directly regulated by
specific Hox proteins, which have segmentally-restricted
expression patterns, the majority of the elements expressing in the hindbrain do so in particular rhombomeres,
as shown by comparison with r3r5 RFP expression (Figure 4). Hindbrain reporter expression driven by these
elements is often further restricted dorso-ventrally (e.g.
Nkx6-1_4281), medio-laterally (e.g. Pax2_217) and temporally (e.g. Tshz3_43509).
We next examined functional data from the VISTA
Enhancer Browser (EB). Compared to shuffled motifs,
the KR motif was found to be significantly enriched in
those elements annotated as hindbrain positive as well
as those positive for either hindbrain, branchial arch or
cranial nerve expression (Table 1). Investigating those
EB elements that overlap CNEs from the CONDOR set,
we found significant enrichment for the KR motif in
those with hindbrain expression (HB+, 64 motifs in 112
kb) compared with those with no hindbrain annotation
(HB-, 85 in 238 kb) (chi-square p = 0.0042). We then
focused upon those sub-regions within EB enhancers
that align directly with CNEs. Within these deeply conserved regions, there was more than two-fold enrichment for the stringent Pbx-Hox motif (30 occurrences
in 24990 bp of HB+ elements compared with 32 occurrences in 60341 bp of HB- elements; p = 0.001). Importantly, this enrichment demonstrates that Pbx-Hox
motifs in ancient CNEs show a correlation with hindbrain reporter expression. We also analysed a smaller
dataset from the cneBrowser [21] that contains evolutionarily conserved enhancers associated with genes
expressed in forebrain and hindbrain during zebrafish
development. Although only 18 of 146 enhancers are
annotated as hindbrain positive, 7 out of a total of 17
identified KR motifs reside in hindbrain positive enhancers (p = 3 × 10-4) (Table 1).

10, in CNEs, are in good agreement with known functional Pbx-Hox binding sites, supporting a strong KR consensus.

Enrichment analysis for Pbx-Hox KR motifs, relative to shuffled versions (retaining G+C content for each binding site), within different sets of CNEs. CNEs from the
VISTA enhancer browser (EB) and zebrafish cneBrowser (CB) sets have also been grouped according to annotated expression in the hindbrain (HB), branchial
arches (BA) or cranial nerves (CN). All sequences are human except the Zebrafish cneBrowser set. N/S = not significant

CNEs containing Pbx-Hox motifs are associated with
genes that have roles in A-P patterning of the hindbrain
and head

We have examined the distribution of Pbx-Hox motifs
across CNEs of different genes, to ask whether genes
with the highest enrichment of Pbx-Hox motifs in their
CNEs have roles in hindbrain or pharyngeal arch patterning (Table 2 and Additional file 6). In keeping with
the common use of auto-regulation in gene-regulatory
networks [45], we find the CNEs of the HOXD cluster
and the Hox co-factors, PBX3 and MEIS2, to be
amongst those with the highest number of these motifs.
Many of the other genes with the highest density of
Pbx-Hox motifs in their CNEs have characterised roles
in anterior-posterior (A-P) head patterning and show
segment specific patterns of expression during development. For instance, the ZNF503/703 (Nlz1 and Nlz2)

zinc-finger proteins are essential for specification of
rhombomere 4 in zebrafish [46,47]. The orphan nuclear
receptor genes NR2F1/2 (COUP-TF1/2) are negative
transcriptional regulators involved in the retinoic acid
signalling pathway, which has a key role in A-P patterning of the hindbrain and pharyngeal arches [48]. The
members of the teashirt protein family (TSHZ1, 2 and
3) show segment-specific hindbrain expression [49],
Tshz1 being essential for segmentally restricted gene
expression in the hindbrain and pharyngeal arches of
frog and mouse [50,51].
There is good agreement between the genes highlighted by our in-silico binding-site search and by
microarray screens for downstream targets of hoxb1 in
rhombomere 4 of zebrafish [52] and mouse [53]. Specifically, the expression levels of znf503, tshz2, evi1, zic4,
shox, and meis2.1 are decreased upon knock-down of

NKX6-1 10

Details are shown for the 15 gene loci from the CONDOR CNE set with the highest number of Pbx-Hox KR motifs in their CNEs, showing enrichment relative to
shuffled CNE sets (Methods and Additional File 6). For each gene locus, the number of Pbx-Hox KR motifs in the associated CNEs is given. The number of PbxHox KR motifs per kb of CNE sequence for each locus (column 4) is calculated by dividing the number of Pbx-Hox KR motifs in the CNEs of that locus (column 2)
by the total combined length of the CNEs in that locus (column 2). Control sets were generated by zero order Markov shuffling of CNEs at each locus in 1000
randomisations (Methods). Some gene loci also contain other genes besides the one after which they are named, for instance the IRX5 locus contains Irx3, Irx5
and Irx6.

HoxB1 in zebrafish, with Znf503, Nkx6-1, Atbf1 and
Mab21l2 down-regulated in HoxB1-/- mouse embryos.
Accordingly, the CNEs around each of these genes are
enriched in Pbx-Hox motifs (Table 2 and Additional
File 6). Thus, both microarray datasets are consistent
with our prediction that Pbx-Hox motifs in CNEs represent direct regulatory links between Hox genes and their
targets during development.

Discussion
Discovery of Pbx-Hox motif enrichment is a further step
toward de-coding CNEs

Despite a pervasive assumption that CNEs bind transcription factors in order to elicit gene activation, there
is, perhaps surprisingly, very little direct evidence to
confirm this. We sought to identify TFBS motifs in
CNEs through phylogenetic footprinting, reasoning that
the relatively high divergence of lamprey CNEs would
highlight important motifs. The utility of this approach
is confirmed by our identification of conserved Pbx-Hox
and Meis TFBS motifs in CNEs. The enrichment of the
Pbx-Hox TFBS motif in the jawed vertebrate CNE set

reveals this motif to be a regulatory signature that is utilised by a large proportion of highly conserved cis-regulatory elements (the 6, 693 CONDOR CNEs contain 562
KR motifs and 1416 TGATNNAT motifs). Whilst
enriched motifs identified in mammalian conserved elements include a few that show partial overlap with variants of the Pbx-Hox consensus motif [23,24], the link
between those enriched motifs and Hox factors had not
been made, and their strong enrichment in more ancient
CNEs had not been characterised. This enrichment
agrees with the crucial, conserved roles of Hox factors
in development of the vertebrate body plan. Indeed, the
association of these motifs with hindbrain and pharyngeal arch enhancer function is in keeping with the characterised roles of Pbx, Hox and Meis factors in
patterning these domains.
Despite the crucial roles of Hox factors in patterning
the vertebrate embryo, relatively few downstream target
genes, other than the hox genes themselves, have been
identified. Our data suggests that Pbx-Hox motifs in
CNEs can identify such targets. The striking manner in
which Pbx-Hox and Meis TFBS motifs are highlighted

Parker et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:637
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/637

as conserved sequence blocks in multiple alignments,
especially when lamprey sequences are included, leads
us to predict that this footprinting approach will be useful for further deciphering the regulatory code within
vertebrate enhancers. In combination, our in-silico and
functional analyses form an important link between well
characterised cis-regulatory motifs and a large proportion of relatively uncharacterised ancient CNEs, helping
to better place these elements within a developmental
context. This represents a significant further step in systematically de-coding the enhancers responsible for
development of the vertebrate body plan and highlights
the utility of the lamprey as a model system for investigating vertebrate gene regulation.
The diversity of expression patterns driven by our
tested elements suggests that Pbx-Hox TFBSs are just
one component of a complex cis-regulatory logic
encoded within these enhancers. Whilst responding to
A-P patterning cues by interacting with particular Hox
factors through Pbx-Hox TFBSs, these elements concomitantly determine the tissues in which they are active
(e.g. hindbrain vs pharyngeal arch) and limit the expression patterns dorso-ventrally, medio-laterally and temporally. An example of this is the CNE Pax2_403, which
drives reporter expression that is restricted to a ventrolateral population of neurons in r2-3 of the hindbrain
(Figure 4). Furthermore, whilst some of our functionally
characterised CNEs drive reporter expression in
domains with sharp boundaries that are co-incident
with rhombomere boundaries -similar to that of previously characterised Pbx-Hox regulated elements - this
is not the case for all of them. This could be due to the
Pbx-Hox input establishing a competence for the enhancer to drive expression within particular rhombomeres,
which is further restricted to specific sub-domains
within the rhombomeres by the influence of other regulatory inputs to the enhancer. This would result in
expression domains that do not encompass the whole
area of expression of the regulating Hox factor. It is
likely that the reason why many previously characterised
Pbx-Hox regulated elements show expression domains
across whole rhombomeres and with tight boundaries
co-incident with rhombomere boundaries is that the
majority of these elements are regulating Hox factors,
and thus setting up or maintaining the rhombomerespecific Hox expression patterns. Many of the elements
described in this study may be acting downstream of
this Hox network, utilising these AP patterning cues
along with other cues to further pattern the hindbrain.
The tissue specificity of these enhancers, as well as the
restriction of expression to specific domains and time
points, is presumably due to other factors acting as specifiers by binding to nearby TFBSs. Identifying these
specifiers and characterising their TFBSs, as well as the

Page 10 of 14

nature of their interactions with Hox factors, are key
tasks toward understanding the cis-regulatory logic
underlying vertebrate development. The set of putative
Hox-responsive cis-regulatory elements identified in this
study provides a powerful resource that will facilitate
efforts toward this end.
Our expression data from the mutated versions of
zebrafish CNE 3299 suggests that the multiple Pbx-Hox
and Meis sites predicted in this enhancer may interact
with each other, to co-operatively modulate and restrict
reporter expression. The two clusters of Pbx-Hox and
Meis motifs do not contribute equally to the expression
driven by this enhancer in the hindbrain and pharyngeal
arch neural crest. The second Pbx-Hox and Meis motif
cluster appears to be necessary for the general function
of this enhancer, as its mutation results in the loss of
reporter expression in both hindbrain and neural crest.
In contrast, the first Pbx-Hox and Meis motif cluster
appears to be necessary (but not sufficient) for neural
crest expression, but not for hindbrain expression. Conversely, it appears to restrict the hindbrain expression,
as reporter expression is seen more anteriorly when this
cluster is mutated. This is reminiscent of interactions
between Pbx-Hox and Meis/Prep binding sites within a
Hoxb1 enhancer, which direct expression of this gene to
r4 the hindbrain in mouse and chick [54]. In that case,
it was found that the formation of a Pbx-Hox-Meis/Prep
ternary complex on Pbx-Hox and Meis sites within this
enhancer could be restricted by the binding of a Pbx1Prep1 heterodimer to a nearby site, thus limiting the
expression driven by this enhancer to r4. This highlights
the complexity of the regulatory interactions between
transcription factors that are likely to bind to CNEs, a
complexity that could well underlie their high sequence
constraint.
A potential role for CNEs in the evolution of vertebrate
head patterning

A strength of identifying conserved cis-regulatory elements is that they can provide compelling evidence for
conserved GRNs. Our reporter assay data from zebrafish
and lamprey embryos clearly demonstrate functional
conservation of enhancers shared between the most distantly related extant vertebrate lineages. We deduce that
all vertebrates share aspects of a GRN for hindbrain patterning, downstream of nested Hox expression. As the
sea lamprey is from a vertebrate lineage that diverged
prior to the evolution of many jawed vertebrate innovations, such as paired appendages and jaws [55], we predict that the lamprey reporter assay will be a crucial
tool for investigating the gene regulatory changes
involved in vertebrate evolution.
Without detailed knowledge of the function or
mechanism of action of CNEs it has been difficult to

Parker et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:637
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/637

derive scenarios of how they evolved and became fixed
in vertebrate genomes. The findings from our in silico
and functional analyses, coupled with previous characterisation of Pbx-Hox and Meis transcription-factor
complexes, enable us to propose a hypothesis regarding
the role of a large number of CNEs in vertebrate evolution. Recognising the same TFBS motifs in worms, flies
and vertebrates, the Pbx, Hox and Meis factors are part
of an ancient regulatory language shared across bilaterians [17,36,37,56,57]. Nevertheless, none of the CNEs
containing these motifs are identifiable in invertebrate
genomes, leading us to speculate that many of these elements may have arisen in the vertebrate lineage.
Accordingly, our functional data suggest that many of
these CNEs have roles in patterning an elaborate head
and brain - key vertebrate innovations [54]. We
hypothesise that the fundamental role of head patterning
in vertebrates led to the functional conservation of these
elements and that their reliance upon the precise organisation of TFBSs necessitated their strict sequence conservation. The mechanisms through which new cisregulatory elements arise in the genome are still largely
unresolved. In this case, the finding that simple PbxHox sites are sufficient to drive robust and specific, but
modifiable, expression [17] hints that these particular
TFBSs may pioneer new cis-regulatory elements, functioning as one of the fundamental seeds from which
many CNEs were able to grow.

Conclusions
The finding that vertebrate CNEs are highly enriched for
Pbx-Hox binding-site motifs represents a further step
toward de-coding ancient vertebrate enhancers. Coupled
with our experimental data, this enables a large proportion of these elements to be more firmly placed into a
developmental context and reveals ancient gene regulatory network interactions for hindbrain and head patterning that were present in ancestral vertebrates.
Finally, our findings lead us to hypothesise that the evolution of many of these CNEs contributed to the elaboration of the vertebrate hindbrain and the branchial
region of the head.
Methods
Identification of CNEs

6, 693 non-redundant human CNEs (average length 116
bp) were retrieved from the CONDOR database [43] at
http://condor.nimr.mrc.ac.uk (Additional File 7). We
used these to search lamprey sequence reads available
from the NCBI trace server at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Traces/trace.cgi with sensitive parameters (-W 7 -q
-1 -e 5e-4) as described previously [28]. The lamprey
trace sequences were searched because they represent a
greater coverage of the lamprey genome than the

Page 11 of 14

publicly available draft genome assembly, which consists
of many short contigs and thus provides little advantage
with regard to identification of conserved syntenic
regions. Lamprey sequences satisfying the initial parametric threshold were further analysed for contamination, and those with > 90% homology to human or
chicken across the whole read (i.e. extending outside the
evolutionarily conserved region in other vertebrates)
were removed.
Alignments

The sequences of human, fugu and most zebrafish CNEs
were retrieved from the CONDOR database [57]. Additional zebrafish CNEs that were not previously included
in the CONDOR database due to absence from earlier
assemblies were identified using BLAST against a more
recent zebrafish genome assembly (Zv8 release 58).
Sequences in each alignment were clipped to the same
size to prevent unaligned edges. To align the sequences
we used ClustalW version 1.83. These alignments
formed the lamprey CNE set (comprised of alignments
of CNEs from human, fugu, zebrafish and lamprey) and
the gnathostome CNE set (containing alignments of
CNEs from human, fugu and zebrafish). As a control,
for each CNE we also generated 1000 multiple alignments by randomly shuffling the columns of each alignment using the seqboot implementation in Phylip
version 3.67. The sequences of lamprey and zebrafish
CNEs in these datasets are given in Additional File 8
and Additional File 9 respectively. The sequences of
CNEs from the EB and cneBrowser datasets are given in
Additional File 10 and Additional File 11 respectively.
Scanning CNEs and control sets for Pbx-Hox motifs

We searched for Pbx-Hox motifs in two different types
of datasets. Firstly, in multiple sequence alignments of
CNEs from the CONDOR CNE database (the lamprey
and gnathostome CNE sets). Secondly, in datasets consisting of sequences from just one species (the EB
CNEs, shark CNEs, human elements from the CONDOR CNE set, cneBrowser CNEs). The two different
types of datasets required different types of control to
test for Pbx-Hox motif enrichment. For the alignment
sets, we generated control sets of shuffled alignments.
To find evolutionarily conserved Pbx-hox motifs
(TGATNNAT and TGATNNATKR) we employed the
software Cis-Finder [42] on our two alignment sets and
their respective shuffled alignment controls. A motif
match was only considered if it matched all aligned species and occurred at the exact same aligned position.
For the single species sequence sets we generated
shuffled motifs, based upon the KR motif, as a control
to search across the same sets. In parallel we also
employed a de-novo motif finding strategy implemented

Parker et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:637
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/637

in Cis-Finder on the CONDOR CNE set. It scans a set
of DNA sequences for over-represented position frequency matrices (PFMs), clusters these and then estimates significance using the false discovery rate [42].
The TGATNNAT and TGATNNATKR motif occurances in the CONDOR CNE set are detailed in Additional File 12 and Additional File 13.
To characterise the frequency of Pbx-Hox KR motifs
in different gene loci, we used the CONDOR CNE set,
in which CNEs are grouped according to gene locus as
specified in the CONDOR database [57]. For each gene
locus, we counted the frequency of Pbx-Hox KR motifs
in the associated CNEs and compared this to the average frequency in 1000 sets of randomised versions of
CNEs from that locus. A markov chain model of order
zero was used to generate shuffled sequences. To model
DNA sequences, 4 states (A, C, G, T) and 4 transitions
were used. Transition probabilities were retrieved from
the CNE set by calculating the relative frequencies of
the bases.
Measuring relative enrichment of Pbx-Hox motifs

To measure the enrichment, we compared the occurrence of Pbx-Hox motifs in a test set against shuffled
versions (Table 1), calculated mean and standard deviation and generated z-scores. The z-scores were then
transformed into p-values under a normal distribution
model. We also counted Pbx-Hox occurrence and
shuffled versions in a number of control regions and
across the whole human genome (Additional File 4).
Overlap with other evolutionarily conserved ‘enhancer’
sets

There is inevitably some overlap between the different
sets of evolutionarily conserved sequences. 482/1307 EB
human sequences overlap 994 CONDOR CNEs, covering a total of 146226 bases (7.4% of the EB sequence;
18.8% of CNE sequence). 1632 human sequences identified through comparison with Callorhinchus milii [13]
overlap 2172 CONDOR CNEs, covering a total of
271260 bases (26.5% of the Callorhinchus dataset; 34.9%
of CNEs). Finally, 69/146 zebrafish cneBrowser
sequences overlap 83 CONDOR CNEs, covering a total
of 11496 bases (20.5% of the cneBrowser sequence; 1.5%
of CNE sequence).
Zebrafish transgenesis

CNEs were amplified from zebrafish and lamprey genomic DNA by PCR, sub-cloned into the Pcr8/GW/TOPO
vector (Invitrogen) and then into a Tol2 construct
(pGW_cfosEGFP) [29,58,59], using the Gateway LR Clonase II enzyme (Invitrogen). The Tol2 reporter assay
was performed as described previously [29]. Transient
transgenic zebrafish embryos were screened for GFP

Page 12 of 14

expression at 24-30hpf, 48-54hpf and 72-78hpf using a
Leica M165FC microscope and photographs taken with
a Leica DFC310FX camera. Expression patterns were
deemed consistent when found in > 20% of founders,
consistent with previous studies [25,60].
CNE Mutagenesis

Mutations in zebrafish CNE 3299 were introduced by
PCR from genomic DNA with primers containing the
desired mutations either through conventional PCR (for
sub1) or megaprimer PCR (for sub2) [61]. Mutated CNE
PCR products were then cloned for zebrafish transgenesis as described above.
Lamprey transgenesis

The transgenesis protocol was based upon that developed
in Xenopus [62]. Lamprey CNEs were amplified from
genomic DNA and cloned into the cFos-I-sceI-EGFP
plasmid, which contains the mouse cFos minimal promoter and EGFP coding sequence flanked by I-sceI restriction sites. Plasmids were extracted using the EndoFree
Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen) and eluted with water through
QIAQuick columns (Qiagen). Fresh restriction digests
(20 μl containing 400 ng plasmid, 15 units I-SceI enzyme
(NEB), 1 × I-SceI buffer + BSA, digested for 40 minutes
at 37°C) were micro-injected into 5-6hpf lamprey
embryos using a Pico-Spritzer with drop volume of 2-3
nl. Lamprey husbandry was performed as described previously [63]. Embryos were screened for GFP expression
between embryonic days 7-16. Typical survival rates ranged from 20-50% of injected embryos. The promoter
alone drives highly mosaic background expression in the
ectoderm in roughly 50% of surviving embryos. Enhancer-specific expression was seen in approximately 10% of
surviving embryos.
