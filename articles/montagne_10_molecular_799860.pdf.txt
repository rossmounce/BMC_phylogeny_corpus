Molecular evolution of the crustacean
hyperglycemic hormone family in ecdysozoans
Nicolas Montagné1, Yves Desdevises2, Daniel Soyez3, Jean-Yves Toullec4*

Abstract
Background: Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (CHH) family peptides are neurohormones known to regulate
several important functions in decapod crustaceans such as ionic and energetic metabolism, molting and
reproduction. The structural conservation of these peptides, together with the variety of functions they display, led
us to investigate their evolutionary history. CHH family peptides exist in insects (Ion Transport Peptides) and may
be present in all ecdysozoans as well. In order to extend the evolutionary study to the entire family, CHH family
peptides were thus searched in taxa outside decapods, where they have been, to date, poorly investigated.
Results: CHH family peptides were characterized by molecular cloning in a branchiopod crustacean, Daphnia
magna, and in a collembolan, Folsomia candida. Genes encoding such peptides were also rebuilt in silico from
genomic sequences of another branchiopod, a chelicerate and two nematodes. These sequences were included in
updated datasets to build phylogenies of the CHH family in pancrustaceans. These phylogenies suggest that
peptides found in Branchiopoda and Collembola are more closely related to insect ITPs than to crustacean CHHs.
Datasets were also used to support a phylogenetic hypothesis about pancrustacean relationships, which, in
addition to gene structures, allowed us to propose two evolutionary scenarios of this multigenic family in
ecdysozoans.
Conclusions: Evolutionary scenarios suggest that CHH family genes of ecdysozoans originate from an ancestral
two-exon gene, and genes of arthropods from a three-exon one. In malacostracans, the evolution of the CHH
family has involved several duplication, insertion or deletion events, leading to neuropeptides with a wide variety
of functions, as observed in decapods. This family could thus constitute a promising model to investigate the links
between gene duplications and functional divergence.

Background
The study of the evolutionary history of arthropods is a
challenging field of research, as they constitute the large
majority of known metazoan species and exhibit an
extreme diversity of body plans and physiology. Nowadays, evo-devo approaches largely contribute to this
research area [reviewed in [1]], but the evolution of peptide hormone families directly involved in physiological
adaptations remains poorly investigated in arthropods,
especially when compared to vertebrates. The Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (CHH) family could constitute a model of choice to address this question, as
CHH family peptides are well known in decapod crustaceans, where they do play major roles in many

physiological processes. Since decapods were the first
invertebrates where a neuroendocrine mechanism was
discovered, they have been extensively used in comparative endocrinology studies, and CHH has become the
archetype of a neuropeptide family including around
150 members to date [reviewed in [2-4]]. CHH family
peptides are 72 to 78 amino acids long and are, based
on structural features, divided into two sub-families [5].
Type I peptides, the CHHs sensu stricto, are pleiotropic
hormones involved in the regulation of energetic and
ionic metabolism and, in addition, can also exert an
inhibitory effect on molting and reproduction [reviewed
in [6]]. By a tissue-specific alternative splicing mechanism, CHH genes produce a second peptide, devoid of
hyperglycemic activity, named CHH-L (for CHH long
isoform), which may be involved in osmoregulation
[7-9]. Type II peptides, namely the molt-inhibiting

hormones (MIHs), the vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormones (VIHs) and the mandibular organ-inhibiting hormones (MOIHs), are functionally more specialized than
CHHs. Characterized through their inhibitory actions on
molting and reproduction, they never elicit hyperglycemia [reviewed in [2,10]].
The evolution of CHHs has been recently discussed in
decapods [11] and we have intended here to extend the
evolutionary study to the entire family, by including
data from non-decapod taxa. Little is known about the
CHH family outside decapods, but it may be present in
the entire Arthropoda, and even in all Ecdysozoa.
Indeed, a CHH and a VIH were isolated from an isopod
crustacean [12,13], and neuropeptides sharing the same
structural signature, the ion transport peptides (ITPs),
were also characterized in several insect species
[reviewed in [14]]. As for decapod CHHs, ITP genes
produce an ITP-L isoform by alternative splicing, whose
function remains elusive. To go further, heterologous
immunostainings revealed the occurrence of CHH-like
peptides in two branchiopods [15], a myriapod [16] and
a chelicerate [17], and a gene was found in the genome
of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which encodes
a putative peptide exhibiting a CHH family structural
signature [3]. To increase our knowledge on the CHH
family in the taxa cited above, we have conducted an in
silico study on available genomic sequences from arthropods and nematodes. Exon-intron patterns of the genes
were determined and sequences of putative CHH family
peptides were deciphered. In addition, CHH family
sequences were obtained by molecular cloning in a collembolan and in a branchiopod, whose phylogenetic
positions are currently uncertain. Indeed, the grouping
of crustaceans and hexapods in a Pancrustacea clade is
widely accepted but the relationships inside Pancrustacea remain controversial. Recent molecular phylogenies
based on mitochondrial genes (Figure 1A) notably yield
a paraphyletic Hexapoda, with Collembola separated
from Insecta, and Branchiopoda as a sister-group to
Malacostraca and Cephalocarida [18-20]. These phylogenies largely differ from those based on nuclear genes
(Figure 1B), where Hexapoda appears monophyletic, and
Branchiopoda are generally sister-group to Hexapods
[21-23].
Newly characterized sequences were included in CHH
family sequence datasets, which were then used to build
phylogenies of this family and to investigate its evolutionary history. Because of the reduced size of these
datasets, a test was conducted to assess which of the
two phylogenetic hypotheses presented Figure 1 was
more strongly supported by our data, and could be
further used as a basis to elaborate evolutionary scenarios of the CHH family genes.

Results
CHH family peptides characterized in Daphnia magna and
Folsomia candida

In the branchiopod Daphnia magna, RT-PCRs conducted with degenerate primers designed from insect
ITP transcripts and followed by 3’-5’RACE produced
two complete cDNAs. Their length was 1053 and 1198
bp, respectively, and they encoded peptide precursors
composed of a signal peptide, a precursor-related peptide and a mature hormone. The two cDNA sequences
were identical except for a 145 bp stretch (position 383
to 527) present in only one of them, suggesting the

occurrence of an alternative splicing during mRNA processing. The short cDNA encoded a 72-residue peptide
with a C-terminus end putatively amidated, which was
named ion transport peptide (ITP) as it appeared to be
related to insect ITPs (Figure 2A). On the other hand,
the long cDNA encoded a non-amidated peptide of 79
amino acids, only differing from ITP after the fortieth
residue, which was named ITP-L (Figure 2B).
The two complete cDNA sequences obtained from the
collembolan Folsomia candida led to similar results: two
transcripts of different lengths (1307 and 2018 bp)
encoded prepro-peptides which only differed after the
fortieth residue of the mature peptide. The 72 residue
amidated peptide, translated from the short cDNA, was
named ITP and the 82 residue non-amidated peptide,
translated from the longest cDNA, was named ITP-L
(Figure 2A and 2B).

Sequences characterized in silico

For the insects Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Culex
pipiens, Nasonia vitripennis and Pediculus humanus,
nucleotide sequences encoding for ITP or ITP-L, which
have not been recovered by automatic annotation programs were deduced from the gene sequence following
alternative splicing rules. A gene encoding putative ITP
and ITP-L isoforms was also found in the genome of
another water flea, Daphnia pulex. At the present time,
both ITP (72 or 73 residue amidated peptides) and
ITP-L (79 to 90 residue non-amidated peptides)
sequences are available from 12 insect and two branchiopod species (Figure 2A and 2B).
In the genome of the deer tick Ixodes scapularis (Chelicerata), a gene was found that encoded only one
mature ITP-like peptide. In addition, cDNA and peptide
sequences of another ITP-like peptide were found,

during database mining, in the American dog tick Dermacentor variabilis. These peptides are 74 and 75 residue long, respectively, and are not amidated on their
C-terminal end (Figure 2A).
In the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, the gene
ZC168.2 has been described as putatively encoding a
CHH family peptide of 83 amino acid residues [3]. In
the present study, a second gene (C05E11.6) which may
encode another putative CHH family peptide was found
in the C. elegans genome: this gene encodes a mature
peptide of 97 amino acids containing six cysteyl residues
whose positions are similar to those found in CHH
family hormones (Figure 3). The corresponding peptides
ZC168.2 and C05E11.6 were named ITP 1 and ITP 2,
respectively, based on their similarity with insect ITPs
and without predicting any physiological function. Similar ITP 1 and ITP 2 peptides were also deduced from
the genomes of Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis remanei. Finally, single CHH family peptides were
deduced from the genomes of the Malaysian filarial
worm Brugia malayi and the whipworm Trichinella
spiralis. These putative peptides were 102 and 60 amino
acids long, respectively (Figure 3).
For each of the genes described here, exon-intron
structures were determined and compared to those
already described (Figure 4). These data were further
used, in addition to phylogenetic information, to infer
evolutionary scenarios of the CHH family.
Phylogeny of CHH family peptides in Pancrustacea

In the maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogeny of pancrustacean CHH family peptides (Figure 5), type I and type
II peptides of decapods were both arranged in monophyletic sub-groups. Type I and II peptide clades were
also found in the phylogeny built by Bayesian inference

Page 4 of 15

(BI) based on the DNA dataset. The “type I” clade, supported by a bootstrap value of 95% in the ML analysis
(posterior probability, or pp, of 1.00 in BI), contained all
CHHs from decapods, with the CHH from the isopod
Armadillidium vulgare at their base. Similarly, the “type
II” clade, supported by a bootstrap value of 100% (pp of
1.00 in BI), contained all MIHs, VIHs and MOIHs from
decapods, with the isopod VIH at their base. This topology suggests that the type I and type II peptide genes
constitute paralogous lineages, which have appeared by
duplication of an ancestral gene before the radiation of
malacostracans (taxa that contains decapods and isopods). Inside the type I clade, the clade of Dendrobranchiata (peneid shrimps) CHHs encoded by three-exon
genes is at the base of the other decapod CHHs,
encoded by four-exon genes, found both in Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata (the remaining decapods). It
suggests that a duplication of a CHH gene has occurred
before the radiation of decapods and the split between
Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata, but this node was
strongly supported only in the BI analysis (pp of 1.00,
bootstrap value of 45% in the ML analysis).
A clade supported by a bootstrap value of 76% (pp of
0.99 in BI) was positioned at the base of the type I and
type II clades and contained all ITPs from insects,
together with the peptides characterized in the collembolan Folsomia candida and the branchiopods Daphnia
magna and Daphnia pulex, which were located at the
base. The type III sub-family was thus created to designate peptides contained in this clade.
Since the topology of this clade was only weakly supported (notably with insects appearing paraphyletic),
amino acid and DNA datasets containing less taxa but
more characters were used for phylogenetic inference.

from Ixodes scapularis) was included in these datasets, a
structure of two monophyletic groups was found within
the ingroup: a “type I” clade (supported by a bootstrap
value of 100% in the ML analysis based on the amino
acid dataset and by posterior probabilities of 1.00 in BI
analyses using either amino acid or DNA dataset) and a
“type III” clade (bootstrap value of 48% in the ML analysis of the amino acid dataset, posterior probabilities of
0.79 and 0.98 in BI analyses based on the amino acid
and the DNA datasets, respectively). Since the four
exons used in these datasets exist only in the ingroup
species, the inclusion of the outgroup resulted in a loss
of phylogenetic signal. Then, the outgroup was removed
for subsequent analyses and the resulting trees were
rooted using the structure in two clades previously
found.
Phylogenies built from these 23-taxa datasets using
ML and BI methods were similar (Figure 6). Insects
appeared monophyletic, albeit with moderate support,
and the relationships within the insect clade were not
resolved. Yet, the collembolan Folsomia candida was

Page 7 of 15

positioned at the base of the insects, thus forming a
moderately supported monophyletic hexapod clade, and
branchiopods were a sister group to hexapods, with high
support.
Evolutionary scenarios of the CHH family genes

Using the 23-taxa sequence datasets, a KH test was conducted to decide which of the two competing phylogenetic
hypotheses for arthropods presented in Figure 1 could be
used to build an evolutionary scenario of the CHH family.
This test clearly supported (P < 0.0001) the tree based on
nuclear genes, with a monophyletic Hexapoda sister-group
to Branchiopoda (Figure 1B), versus the tree based on
mitochondrial genes (Figure 1A). Then, the ML phylogeny
of CHH family peptides (Figure 5) was superimposed on a
species tree in which Branchiopoda were sister-group to
Hexapoda, to create a topology accounting for gene duplications in Pancrustacea (Figure 7A). In nematodes, a gene
duplication was also inferred in the Caenorhabditis phylum, as two paralogs were found in genomes of Caenorhabditis species. In the most parsimonious scenario of

insects, branchiopods and decapods.

gene structure evolution based on this topology, CHH
family genes of Ecdysozoa evolved from an ancestral twoexon gene, with nine partial insertion or deletion events
(Figure 7A).In this scenario, CHH family genes of arthropods have all evolved from a three-exon gene, and the
four-exon gene structure would have appeared independently twice, in a common ancestor of decapods and in a
common ancestor of insects and branchiopods.
Because of the weak support, in the ML phylogeny (Figure 5), at the node indicating the duplication which led to
the two paralogous CHH genes found in Dendrobranchiata (with three or four exons), an alternative topology
was considered for pancrustacean CHH family genes,
where the CHH gene duplication would have occurred
only in the Dendrobranchiata phylum (Figure 7B). In that
case, the most parsimonious scenario implied eight intron
or exon insertion/deletion events, and the exon duplication leading to the four-exon gene structure would have
occurred only once.
Regardless of the evolutionary scenario considered, the
putative ancestral gene was likely composed of two
exons and a phase 2 intron interrupting the codon of
the amino acid residue following the fourth cysteine of
the mature peptide. Such an intron was found in every
known CHH family gene, except the ITP2 genes in Caenorhabditis species and the ITP gene of Trichinella spiralis (Figure 4).
Dibasic processing sites used for precursor maturation
by prohormone convertase then likely appeared independently twice, in the common ancestor to arthropods
on one hand and in the common ancestor to the Caenorhabditis genus on the other hand, leading to the
occurrence in these lineages of precursor related peptides (blue boxes in Figures 4 and 7), such as the CHHprecursor related peptides (CPRPs) of decapods.

Discussion
Evolution of the CHH family in decapods and functional
implications

Since the discovery of neuroendocrine factors within the
eyestalks of decapods seventy years ago [24-26], structural and functional data about CHH family peptides in
these crustaceans have been accumulated. While our
knowledge increased, it became more and more difficult
to propose a model of endocrine regulation applying to
all decapods. Indeed, CHH family peptides are not identical in all decapod groups, and their function varies
with the species. This diversity prompted us to investigate the evolutionary history of these peptides.
In decapods, many gene duplications have occurred,
leading to two main paralogous lineages (type I and type
II peptides) and to a large polymorphism of CHH family
peptides inside these lineages (Figure 7). For example,
two clusters containing each at least 7 different CHH

Page 9 of 15

genes were identified in the shrimp Metapenaeus ensis
[27]. A paradigm in evolutionary biology is that gene
duplication represents the major mechanism for emergence of new functions, as one of the two copies is potentially freed from selective pressure and will accumulate
more mutations during evolution [28,29]. In the CHH
family, the functional divergence observed between the
two paralogous lineages could result from a subfunctionalization [30,31], rather than from a neofunctionalization. In fact, the ancestral gene may have encoded a
pleiotropic hormone, like current CHHs, and after duplication of this gene the type II paralogous lineage may
have evolved faster to peptides with a CHH-like structure, but devoid of hyperglycemic activity and conversely
exhibiting more specialized activities, such as inhibition
of molting or vitellogenesis (for MIHs and VIHs, respectively). The faster evolution rate of type II peptide genes
may explain the loss of phylogenetic signal observed in
MIHs, VIHs and MOIHs sequences. Indeed, the topology
of the “type II” clade (Figure 5) is not congruent with the
phylogeny of decapods, whereas it is for the “type I”
clade, as shown in earlier work [11]. This clearly impedes
the elucidation of evolutionary relationships between
type II peptides. The only paralogous lineages clearly
identified so far are the MIHs and MOIHs of Cancer
crabs, as the MOIH genes seem to have appeared from a
duplicated MIH gene only in this genus [32]. In lobsters,
there is no MIH identified so far but a VIH instead,
whose gene may have evolved from a MIH gene subjected to a reduced selective pressure, as molt inhibition
is exerted in this taxa by a CHH isoform [33].
Evolutionary history “outside decapods”

A high number of gene duplications were observed in
decapods only. So far, the only paralogous lineages identified outside decapods are the “ITP1” and “ITP2” genes
found in Caenorhabditis species (Figure 7), and only
one CHH family peptide gene could be found in genomes of the other nematodes, the insects and the deer
tick. In the water flea Daphnia pulex, one ITP gene was
also rebuilt from whole genome shotgun (WGS)
sequences but other WGS sequences sharing sequence
identity with the ITP gene have been found. However, it
is unclear whether these sequences correspond to
another CHH family peptide coding gene or to a
pseudo-gene: this gene would have a peculiar structure,
with exon III lacking, and the prepro-peptide putatively
encoded would lack the dibasic processing site found in
every CHH or ITP precursors and the 6 following residues of the mature peptide as well. Yet, although only
one ITP and one ITP-L cDNA have been cloned in
Daphnia magna, recently published EST data suggest
that both genes may be expressed in Daphnia pulex
[34], but EST and genomic sequences do not match

Montagné et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/62

(only 85% identity between deduced amino acid
sequences). To include these data in an evolutionary
scenario, genomic and mRNA sequences should be
characterized by molecular cloning.
This apparent lack of paralogous lineages outside decapods raises the question of a possible conservation of
function between the ITPs of insects and the related
peptides found in branchiopods, chelicerates and nematodes. Yet, functional studies are too scarce to address
this question. In insects, the effect of ITP on ionic and
water balance was only demonstrated in locusts [35,36]
and nothing is known about the function of ITP-like
peptides in chelicerates or nematodes. In branchiopods,
only one gene expression study on sex determination in
Daphnia magna has indicated that CHH family peptides
may inhibit methyl farnesoate synthesis by the mandibular organ [37]. It is noteworthy that several CHH family
peptides are known to play such a role in decapods
[38-40]. It will be informative to determine whether
Daphnia peptides exhibit other typical “decapod” functions such as hyperglycemia or ecdysteroid synthesis
inhibition, or if they also possess an anti-diuretic activity, as shown for insect ITPs. A similar question about
another neuropeptide family, the RPCH/AKH family,
has recently found a partial answer. Like for the CHH
family, the putative RPCH (red pigment-concentrating
hormone) of Daphnia magna shares more sequence
similarity with AKHs (adipo-kinetic hormones) of
insects than with RPCH of decapod crustaceans [41]. In
a heterologous bioassay, this peptide was able to trigger
a mobilization of lipid reserves when injected into the
green shield bug Nezara viridula whereas it did not provoke pigment migration when injected into the shrimp
Palaemon pacificus [42]. Although heterologous bioassays must be considered cautiously, such results suggest
that this peptide could have an adipokinetic function in
water fleas (like in insects) rather than a pigment-concentration function (like in decapods).
Emergence of the four-exon genes

One important step in the evolution of the CHH family is
the emergence of the four-exon genes found in decapods,
branchiopods and insects. In these genes, exons III and
IV encode peptide sequences of similar lengths, with two
cystein residues in the same positions, thus suggesting
that the supplementary exon has appeared by tandem
duplication of another exon. At first glance, it seems
more likely that this duplication has occurred only once,
in a common ancestor of Pancrustacea (Figure 7B). In all
these taxa, two peptides are produced by alternative splicing; one peptide (CHH or ITP) is 72 or 73 amino acids
long and is always amidated on its C-terminal end, and
the other peptide (CHH-L or ITP-L) is slightly longer
and is never amidated. Moreover, the expression of these

Page 10 of 15

two isoforms seems to be similar in decapods and insects;
in the crab Carcinus maenas and the caridean shrimp
Macrobrachium rosenbergii, CHH transcripts were
mainly found in neurons of the central nervous system
(more precisely in the X-organ located in the eyestalk)
whereas CHH-L transcripts were found in neurons of the
peripheral nervous system [7,8]; in the moths Manduca
sexta and Bombyx mori and the locust Schistocerca americana, ITP-immunoreactive neurons were only found in
the brain, whereas ITP-L-immunoreactive ones were
found along the ventral nervous chain. ITP-L immunoreactivity was also detected in the brain, but was weak and
restricted to cell bodies, thus suggesting that ITP-L was
not secreted from this tissue [43].
Yet, even if the hypothesis of an independent emergence of the fourth exon (Figure 7A) appears unlikely, it
should not be rejected, as a similar exon duplication
also occurred in a Drosophila ancestor, leading to the
five-exon gene found in Drosophila melanogaster [44].
Controversy about pancrustacean phylogeny

Given the relative short length of the sequences used,
the objective of this study was not to build a phylogeny
of pancrustaceans using CHH family peptides, but to
choose the appropriate phylogeny to infer evolutionary
scenarios of the CHH family. The KH test carried out
with our datasets indicated a congruence of the data
with recent molecular phylogenies of pancrustaceans
based on nuclear gene sequences [21-23] and not with
those based on mitochondrial genes [18-20]. Moreover,
the robustness and quality of the signal contained in
mitochondrial gene sequences for arthropod phylogenetics have recently been questioned [45,46]. Supplementary taxa will have to be represented within CHH
family datasets to confirm this result, but studying the
evolutionary history of this family may help to select
synapomorphies to support concurrent phylogenetic
hypotheses about pancrustacean relationships. For
example, the presence of paralogous type I and type II
peptides could constitute a trait shared by malacostracans and their sister-groups.

Conclusion
The evolutionary scenarios proposed in this study suggest that genes encoding Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone family peptides of Ecdysozoa evolved from an
ancestral two-exon gene. In the malacostracan lineage
(including decapods), the evolution of the CHH family
has involved numerous duplications, insertions and deletions of exons or entire genes, leading to the wide variety
of functions displayed by the encoded neurohormones in
decapods. This neuropeptide family could thus constitute
a promising model to investigate the evolutionary forces
at the root of the functional divergence of duplicated

genes. Outside malacostracans, the number of gene
duplications seems to have been lower, which may reflect
different evolutionary pathways. At present, CHH family
peptides characterized outside decapods are still scarce,
and this work constitutes a first step in a wider quest. In
the future, the evolutionary scenarios elaborated here will
be completed and amended, as CHH family peptides will
probably be characterized in new taxa. The 38 genome
sequencing projects currently under way in ecdysozoan
species will be of valuable help as soon as they are completed, to enlarge our view on the evolution of this multigenic family.

cDNA sequences obtained by RT-PCR. These primers
are listed in Table 1. First amplifications were performed
using the adaptor primer supplied with the kit (Universal Primer Mix) and specific primers Up1 (for 3’RACE)
or Down1 (for 5’RACE). Then, nested PCRs were performed on 1/150th of the first PCR products, between
the Nested Universal Primer from the kit and specific
primers Up2 or Down2. All reverse-transcription and
PCR amplification steps were carried out following the
protocol supplied in the kit. RACE products were cloned
and sequenced as described above.
Database mining

Methods
Biological material and RNA extraction

Daphnia magna and Folsomia candida (strain TO) specimens were supplied by the BIOEMCO laboratory and the
Ecology & Evolution laboratory, respectively, both located
at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (Paris, France). Total
RNA was extracted from 10 mg of whole animals, using
SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI).
cDNA was synthesized from 300 ng of total RNA using
200 U of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega),
20 pmoles of each dNTP and 30 pmoles of an Oligo(dT)
primer. This synthesis was performed at 42°C for 1 hour,
followed by an inactivation step at 70°C for 15 min.
PCR amplification and cloning

First, a central region of putative ITP precursor cDNAs
was amplified using degenerate primers DgnITP-Up
(5’-CTTCGAYATCMAKTGYAARGG-3’) and DgnITPDown (5’-RAGRCAWCCTTTGAAGWATG-3’) designed
from the alignment of known insect ITP cDNAs. The
reaction mixture contained 1.5 U of GoTaq® DNA Polymerase (Promega), 5 pmoles of each dNTP and 10
pmoles of each degenerate primer. Amplifications were
conducted with a denaturation step at 94°C for 3 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec
and 72°C for 30 sec, and a final extension step at 72°C for
10 min. After their purification with the Wizard® SV Gel
and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega), products were
cloned using pGEM®-T Easy Vector and JM109 Competent Cells (Promega). Plasmids were purified using the
Wizard® Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System
(Promega), and their sequencing was performed by
Cogenics - Genome Express (Meylan, France).
3’ and 5’RACE

To create cDNAs which contain a synthetic adaptor
either at the 5’ or 3’ end, total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification
Kit (Clontech, Moutain View, CA). For PCR amplifications, two sets of primers, specific of Daphnia magna
and Folsomia candida, were designed from the partial

A search for CHH family peptide sequences from
arthropods and nematodes was performed with the
BLAST program at the NCBI website http://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. The non-redundant protein
sequences (nr) database was mined by blastp algorithm
using Schistocerca gregaria ITP or the putative peptide
ZC168.2 of Caenorhabditis elegans as query sequences
for arthropods and for nematodes, respectively. Corresponding mRNA sequences were also collected, and
aligned with genome sequences to determine the exonintron structure of the genes. Sequences of genes encoding putative CHH family peptides of Daphnia pulex
(Branchiopoda), Ixodes scapularis (Chelicerata), Caenorhabditis remanei and Brugia malayi (Nematoda) were
assembled from whole genome shotgun (WGS)
sequences available in the NCBI Trace Archives database, by assembling trace reads with CLC Genomics
Workbench software (CLCbio, Aarhus, Denmark).

(when available) from Pancrustacea were created. In the
amino acid dataset, 37 sequences from decapods (22
CHH and 15 MIH, VIH or MOIH) were selected among
the 90 available sequences, and added to the 17
sequences from hexapods and branchiopods. ITP-like
sequences of the ticks Ixodes scapularis and Dermacentor variabilis were included to be used as outgroup (for
sequence references, see Table 2). Alignments were performed manually with Se-Al v2.0a11 http://tree.bio.ed.
ac.uk/software/seal/, and after removal of N-terminal
and C-terminal unconserved residues, the dataset contained 56 taxa and 73 characters. The DNA dataset contained 49 taxa and 219 characters.
DNA and amino acid datasets including CHH-L and
ITP-L sequences were also created. For the 23 taxa in
which such peptides are known, the amino acid
sequence of the mature CHH-L or ITP-L (encoded by
exons II and III of the gene) was concatenated with the
C-terminal sequence of CHH or ITP (encoded by exon
IV of the gene). Alignments were performed manually
and 109 unambiguously aligned residues were conserved
in the dataset. The DNA dataset contained 327
characters.
At first, DNA and translated amino acid sequences of
Ixodes scapularis ITP-like were included in these datasets, to be used as an outgroup in order to determine
the global branching order in the ingroup. Since the
gene encoding this peptide lacks exon III in the outgroup taxon, corresponding characters were replaced
with “?” symbols in the alignments. Because of the loss
of phylogenetic signal brought by the inclusion of the
outgroup, it was removed from datasets for subsequent
phylogenetic analyses, but the global structure previously found was kept.
Phylogenetic reconstructions were carried out using
Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood. Bayesian
analyses were performed with MrBayes 3.1.2 with four
chains of 106 generations, trees sampled every 100 generations and burn-in value set to 20% of the sampled
trees. We checked that standard deviation of the split
frequencies fell below 0.01 to insure convergence in tree
search. Protein sequences were analyzed with a mixed
amino acid model [47], and DNA sequences were considered with an evolutionary model designed for coding
sequences and taking the genetic code into account
[48-50].
Maximum likelihood reconstructions were carried out
only on amino acid sequences. For both datasets, the
WAG+I+G substitution model [51] was determined as
the best-fit model of protein evolution by ProtTest 1.3
[52]http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/prottest_server.html,
following Akaike Information Criterion. Rate heterogeneity was set at four categories. The gamma distribution
parameter and the proportion of invariable sites were

Evolutionary scenarios

The two phylogenetic trees shown in Figure 1 were used
as competing hypotheses to assess if one was more
strongly supported by the 23-taxa sequence datasets.
This was done via a KH test using a maximum likelihood criterion [54]. This allowed us to choose a “species
tree” on which the “gene tree” could be super-imposed.
The evolution of CHH family gene structures was analyzed using Mesquite 2.6 [55], under a parsimony framework. For this analysis, two alternate topologies
depicting the evolution of the CHH family genes were
created. All the known intron locations within CHH
family genes were considered as characters and the presence/absence of intron in each location was coded 0
(absence) or 1 (presence) to create a character matrix.
