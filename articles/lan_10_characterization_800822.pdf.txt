Characterization, sub-cellular localization and
expression profiling of the isoprenylcysteine
methylesterase gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana

Abstract
Background: Isoprenylcysteine methylesterases (ICME) demethylate prenylated protein in eukaryotic cell. Until
now, knowledge about their molecular information, localization and expression pattern is largely unavailable in
plant species. One ICME in Arabidopsis, encoded by At5g15860, has been identified recently. Over-expression of
At5g15860 caused an ABA hypersensitive phenotype in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, indicating that it functions as
a positive regulator of ABA signaling. Moreover, ABA induced the expression of this gene in Arabidopsis seedlings.
The current study extends these findings by examining the sub-cellular localization, expression profiling, and
physiological functions of ICME and two other ICME-like proteins, ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2, which were encoded
by two related genes At1g26120 and At3g02410, respectively.
Results: Bioinformatics investigations showed that the ICME and other two ICME-like homologs comprise a small
subfamily of carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) in Arabidopsis. Sub-cellular localization of GFP tagged ICME and its
homologs showed that the ICME and ICME-like proteins are intramembrane proteins predominantly localizing in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Semi-quantitative and real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the
ICME and ICME-like genes are expressed in all examined tissues, including roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, stems,
flowers, and siliques, with differential expression levels. Within the gene family, the base transcript abundance of
ICME-LIKE2 gene is very low with higher expression in reproductive organs (flowers and siliques). Time-course analysis
uncovered that both ICME and ICME-like genes are up-regulated by mannitol, NaCl and ABA treatment, with ICME
showing the highest level of up-regulation by these treatments. Heat stress resulted in up-regulation of the ICME
gene significantly but down-regulation of the ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2 genes. Cold and dehydration stimuli led to
no significant change of both ICME and ICME-like gene expression. Mutant icme-like2-1 showed increased sensitivity
to ABA but slightly decreased sensitivity to salt and osmotic stresses during seed germination.
Conclusions: It is concluded that the ICME family is involved in stress and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis, probably
through mediating the process of demethylating prenylated proteins. Identification of these prenylated proteins
will help to better understand the significance of protein prenylation in Planta.

Background
Prenylation is a stable lipid modification process involving covalent addition of either farnesyl (15-carbon) or
geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) isoprenoids to conserved
cysteine residues at or near the C-terminus of proteins
[1-3]. It is believed that about 2% of eukaryotic cell

proteins are modified by prenylation [2], which is
accomplished by three distinct heterodimeric protein
isoprenyltransferases. Protein with the carboxyl-terminal
residue of the CaaX motif, where “a” refers to the aliphatic residue, is recognized either by farnesyltransferase
(FTase) when “X” is methionine, glutamine, serine, alanine, or cysteine, or by geranylgeranytransferase type I
(GGTase I) when “X” is leucine or isoleucine [1-3].
FTase and GGTase I are cytosolic enzymes utilizing farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
as the isoprenyl donors, respectively [1-3]. The third

isoprenyltransferase is geranylgeranytransferase type II
(GGTase II), which transfers two geranylgeranyl groups
from geranylgeranyl diphosphate to the carboxyl terminal cysteine residues of XCCXX, XXCXC, XXCCX,
XXXCC, XCXXX or CCXXX motifs [4]. All three
enzymes have been found in eukaryotes including protozoans, metazoans, fungi, and plants. In the plant kingdom, these enzymes have been reported in different
species such as pea (Pisum sativum) [5,6], tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) [7,8], and Arabidopsis thaliana
[9-13]. In Arabidopsis, FTase and GGTase I share a
common a-subunit encoded by a single gene PLP
(PLURIPETALA) [12], whereas the genes encoding
the b-subunit of FTase and GGTase I are ERA1
(ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABA1) [9,10] and GGB
(GERANYLGERANYLTRANSFERASE BETA) [11,13],
respectively.
Following prenylation by FTase or GGTase I in cytoplasm, proteins are usually subject to further maturation processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
including cleavage of the ‘aaX’ residues by endoproteases and methylation of the newly created carboxyl
terminal residue cysteine by isoprenylcycteine methyltransferase (ICMT) [1-3]. In Arabidopsis, two genes
encoding CaaX endoprotease, AtSTE24 (At4 g01320)
and AtFACE-2 (At2g36305 or AtRCE1), have been
identified [14-16]. Similarly, two ICMT genes,
AtSTE14A (At5g23320 or AtICMTA) and AtSTE14B
(At5g08335 or AtICMTB), have also been characterized
[17-19]. Using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a methyl
donor, AtSTE14A and AtSTE14B catalyze the methylation of biologically relevant isoprenylcysteine substrates, i.e. farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine,
but not geranylcysteine [17-19].
Biochemically, protein prenylation and subsequent
mature processing steps increase its C-terminal hydrophobicity, which facilitate its attachment to membrane
and, in some cases, promoting protein-protein interactions [1-3]. Physiologically, these protein lipid modifications including prenylation and subsequent methylation
exert profound effects on diverse processes involving
signal transduction and intracellular trafficking pathways
[1-3]. In Arabidopsis, protein isoprenylation and its processing steps are involved in hormone metabolism and
signaling, such as cytokinin biosynthesis, abscisic acid
(ABA) and auxin signaling, meristem development,
innate immunity, and other fundamental processes [4].
As protein function can be modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, it is believed that methylation of isoprenlated protein can be reversible by
isoprenylcysteine methylesterase (ICME), and only this
step can be reversible during protein prenylation and
processing [1,2]. Indirect evidence showed that those
cell membranes that can methylate prenylated protein

are also capable of demethylating prenylated amino
acids N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine [20]. Recently,
Deem et al. [21] identified an ICME coding gene
At5g15860 in Arabidopsis. Two related Arabidopsis
genes, At1g26120 and At3g02410, were also reported
in their study.
According to the latest version of TAIR9 (The Arabidopsis Information Resource) released at June 19, 2009,
there are two At3g02410 splice variants, 1269 and 1062
bases, encoding two distinct protein products http://
www.arabidopsis.org. The 1269 base At3g02410.1 transcript is predicted to encode a 422 amino acid polypeptide while the 1062 base At3g02410.2 transcript is
predicted to encode a 353 amino acid polypeptide. Proteins encoded by both splice variants are different from
the one reported by Deem et al [21] in which At3g02410
was predicted to encode a 373 amino acid with no predicted trans-membrane domain. The At1g26120 and
At5g15860 data in TAIR9 is consistent with Deem et al
[21], which highlights two At5g15860 splice variants
encoding two distinct protein products and one single
At1g26120 splice form http://www.arabidopsis.org.
The ICME activity was reported in Arabidopsis membrane fractions [21], although the precise sub-cellular
localization of this protein remains unknown. Overexpressing ICME in Arabidopsis resulted in an ABA
hypersensitive phenotype in stomatal closure and seed
germination, indicating ICME is a positive regulator of
ABA signaling. Furthermore, the expression of this
ICME gene can be induced by ABA after 24 hr treatment [22]. Despite these, knowledge about the protein’s
sub-cellular localization and expression patterns remains
unavailable. Moreover, studies on this gene in response
to other abiotic stresses have not been conducted.
In the present study, the ICME and two ICME-like proteins, ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2 encoded by respective At1g26120 and At3g02410, were characterized
including their sub-cellular localization, tissue-specific
expression patterns and responses to different abiotic
stresses and ABA. The biological function of ICME-LIKE2
was explored by T-DNA knock out mutant.

Results
Characterization and clustering analysis of ICME gene
family in Arabidopsis

Since the gene product of At5g15860 was identified as
ICME [21], we named the gene products of At1g26120
and At3g02410 as ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2, respectively. To confirm the coding sequences deposited in public databases, the open reading frame (ORF) of these genes
were obtained by RT-PCR. We successfully determined a
1431 base ORF for At1g26120, a 1269 base and a 1284
base ORFs for respective At3g02410 and At5g15860. The
amplified PCR products were cloned into pGEMT-easy

vector and sequenced. Sequencing results showed the ORF
sequences of three genes are the same as those released by
TAIR9. For At3g02410 and At5g15860, the two ORF
sequences corresponded to At3g02410.1 http://www.arabidopsis.org and At5g15860.1 [21], the longer variants of the
two genes. For this reason, in this study, we only focused
our interests on the longer splice variants for both
At3g02410 and At5g15860. The amino acid sequences
were derived from these ORFs and multiple amino acid
sequence alignment of the three proteins was performed
using Clustal W2 program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/es/
cgi-bin/clustalw2. Results revealed that these three proteins were highly similar: ICME-LIKE1 shared 59% and
61% amino acid identity with ICME-LIKE2 and ICME,
respectively, while ICME-LIKE2 and ICME had 76% identity (figure 1A). PROSITE software analysis http://www.
expasy.ch/prosite showed that all proteins contained a
highly conserved catalytic triad: a serine, an aspartate and

binding pocket domains, GGA and QSA (figure 1A, indicated by red boxes). Conserved domain search http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi showed
that all three proteins belong to the esterase lipase superfamily (figure 1B), while ICME-LIKE2 and ICME contain
carboxylesterases type-B serine active site with perfect pattern: F-[GR]-G-x (4)-[LIVM]-x-[LIV]-x-G-x-S-[STAG]-G
http://www.expasy.ch/prosite.
Using these three proteins as search query, similar
proteins with more than 50% identity from plant kingdom were retrieved from NCBI through Blastp [23] for
the purpose of evaluating the evolutionary relationship
among these proteins. Phylogenetic tree were constructed using several tree building programs, including
Neighbor Joining (NJ), Minimum Evolution (ME) and
Maximum Parsimony (MP), which are available at the
MEGA4
website

Clustering analysis showed that different methods
yielded similar clustering patterns. The results obtained
with NJ method were presented (figure 1C) and results
obtained with ME and MP methods can be found in
additional files 1 and 2, respectively. Results showed
that the ICME and two ICME-like proteins together
with similar proteins, NP _001132117 from Zea mays,
BAF18320 and BAF20445 from Oryza sativa,
CAO42055 from Vitis vinifera, and ABD96862 from
Cleome spinose, could be classified into one group with
100% bootstrap support. The group is divergent from
two other groups, including the previously reported 20
Arabidopsis Carboxylesterases (AtCXE) [24] and those
that function as a suppressor of AvrBst-elicited resistance in Arabidopsis [25]. The analysis demonstrated
that the ICME genes in Arabidopsis belong to a small
gene family.
ICMEs of Arabidopsis are targeted to ER and Golgi
apparatus

Trans-membrane domain was predicted using several
online programs listed in Table 1.
As a result, except for SOSUI program that predicted
ICME as a soluble protein, all other programs predicted
that the three proteins all contain at least one trans-membrane domain (Table 1). To provide experimental evidence
of the sub-cellular localization of ICME and its homologs,
a transient expression of GFP-fused ICME and its homologs into onion epidermal cells and N. benthamiana protoplasts that isolated from suspension cultured cells, was
performed. Similar sub-cellular localization patterns of the

ICME family were obtained in these two systems (the protoplast system results are presented in figure 2 and the
onion system results can be found in additional file 3). As
shown in figures 2A and 2B, when co-expressing the free
GFP gene with the ER or Golgi marker genes, the GFP
fluorescence was spread throughout the cell (excluding
vacuolar) with stronger signals in the nucleus (figures 2A
and 2B, GFP channel), which was partially overlapped
with the DesRed fluorescence emitted by the ER marker
BiP-RFP (figure 2A, merged channel) and Golgi marker
ST-mRFP (figure 2B, merged channel). When co-expressing the GFP fused ICME-LIKE1 with the ER and Golgi
markers in protoplasts, besides small green punctates, the
GFP fluorescence was predominantly restricted in the ER
and Golgi apparatus, which was confirmed by co-localizing
with the ER marker BiP-RFP (figure 2C, merged channel)
and the Golgi marker ST-mRFP (figure 2D, merged channel). ICME-LIKE2 showed as an ER-resident protein (figure 2E) with partially localizing in the Golgi apparatus
(figure 2F). Some fluorescent vesicles were observed surrounding the Golgi apparatus after GFP was fused to
ICME-LIKE2 in some protoplasts (figure 2F, GFP channel). Similarly, ICME was predominantly localized in the
ER and Golgi apparatus (figures 2G and 2H).
When the trans-membrane domain of the ICME family
was predicted by using TMHHM program, both ICME
and its homologs were found to contain one transmembrane domain (Table 1). For ICME, amino acids 102
to 124 were predicted as a trans-membrane helix. When
this region was deleted and the mutant was fused to GFP
followed by expression in protoplasts, the GFP

fluorescence was still limited in ER and Golgi apparatus,
which was confirmed by co-localizing with the ER and
Golgi apparatus makers (figures 2I and 2J).
Tissue-specific expression patterns of ICME gene family

To examine the tissue-specific expression of ICME and
its homologs, total RNA was extracted from different
tissues including roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves,
stems, flowers, and siliques of 4-5 weeks old plants,

followed by further treatment with DNase to remove
the possible trace genomic DNA. One microgram of
DNA-free RNA was converted into cDNA and semiquantitative RT-PCR or real-time quantitative RT-PCR
(qPCR) was performed.
Both semi-quantitative RT-PCR (figure 3A) and qPCR
(figure 3B) results showed that all ICME genes are constitutively expressed in all examined tissues with differentiated expression levels (figures 3A and 3B). The
steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) level of ICME was
low in the stems but high in the reproductive organs
including flowers and siliques (figures 3A and 3B). For
ICME-LIKE1, it showed the highest mRNA level in the
leaves but the lowest in the stems (figures 3A and 3B).
Overall, transcript abundance of the ICME-LIKE2 gene
was quite low; the mRNA level of ICME-LIKE2 was
much lower than that of ICME and ICME-LIKE1 in all
tested tissues (figures 3A and 3B), which was hardly
detectable, especially in the vegetative organs including
roots, leaves and stems, with semi-quantitative RT-PCR
of less PCR cycles (figures 3A and 3B).
Expression profiles of ICME gene family in response to
abiotic stresses and ABA

Time-course expression profiles of the ICME gene
family in response to different abiotic stresses including
cold (4°C), heat (37°C), drought (dehydration), mannitol
(400 mM), NaCl (200 mM), and ABA (50 μM) were
determined using qPCR. Overall, cold treatment resulted
in no significant expression change of the ICME family
(figure 4A). The ICME-LIKE1 expression was slightly
up-regulated by cold treatment after 60 min. In contrast,
the expression of ICME-LIKE2 gene was slightly downregulated by cold treatment after 15 min and recovered
to the pre-treatment level after 60 min. Similar to the
ICME-LIKE2 gene, under cold treatment, the ICME
gene was slightly down-regulated quickly and then upregulated.
In contrast to the response to the cold treatment, the
expression of the ICME-LIKE1 gene was down-regulated
during heat treatment (figure 4B), which could be
applied to the ICME-LIKE2 gene (figure 4B). However,
upon heat treatment, transcript of ICME showed a
quick and transient increase. After 60 min of heat treatment, the ICME expression reached the maximum (figure 4B). At 120 min of heat treatment, the ICME
expression was recovered to near the pre-treatment
levels. From the expression profile, it is obvious that
ICME is a quick and early response gene during heat
stress, indicating that ICME may play an important role
in the response of plants to heat stress.
When suffered from drought stress, both ICME and
its homologs exhibited similar responses. Overall, the
transcript abundance of these genes was not changed

Figure 3 Tissue-specific express patterns of ICME and its homologs. Transcript level of ICME and its homologs were evaluated across
different tissues including roots, stems, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, flowers, and siliques by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (A) and real-time
quantitative RT-PCR (B). For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, different PCR cycles were shown to the left; for real-time quantitative RT-PCR, the relative

drought stress. The transcripts of ICME-LIKE1 and
ICME-LIKE2 decreased at 15 min of treatment; whereas
the transcripts of ICME and ICME-LIKE2 increased at
120 min after treatment (figure 4C).
As shown in figure 4D, in general, both ICME and its
homologs were elevated by osmotic stress induced by
mannitol treatment with differential levels of increase.
Among them, the ICME gene showed the most pronounced up-regulation. At 12 hr of treatment, the
expression of ICME reached the maximum with its

transcript abundance being at least 10 times of that of
the pre-treatment. At 3 hr of treatment, the expression
of ICME-LIKE1 was maximally induced and this induction was lasted for 21 hrs. The ICME-LIKE2 gene was
induced at 3 hr of treatment and was maximally induced
at 12 hr of treatment.
Upon NaCl treatment, the expression profile of ICME
and its homologs was similar to that in response to
mannitol treatment. As shown in figure 4E, both ICME
and its homologs were up-regulated by NaCl treatment,
with ICME showing the strongest up-regulation.

Figure 4 Expression profiles of ICME and its homologs in response to abiotic stresses and ABA. Seven-day-old seedlings were subjected
to different abiotic stresses including cold at 4°C (A), heat at 37°C (B), drought (C), 400 mM mannitol (D), 200 mM NaCl (E), and 50 μM ABA (F)
for different time indicated. The transcripts were determined consequently by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and the relative expression of ICME
and its homologs compared to that of Actin8 gene was shown as mean and SD (n = 3).

Moreover, the transcript of ICME increased quickly. The
expression of ICME started increase at 1 hr of treatment
and reached the maximum at 3 hr. Similarly, after 3 hr
treatment, the expression of ICME-LIKE1 was maximally induced and this induction was lasted until 24 hr
of treatment. In contrast, ICME-LIKE2 was induced at 3
hr of treatment and the expression reached the maximum at 12 hr of treatment.
As shown in figure 4F, the expression of both ICME
and its homologs was increased in response to ABA.
Among them, ICME and ICME-LIKE2 showed the most
and the least pronounced up-regulation by ABA, respectively. Interestingly, transcript abundance of ICMELIKE2 fluctuated during the course of ABA treatment,
i.e, the transcript increased at 3 hr and backed to the
pre-treatment level at 6 hr and then increased again at

24 hr after treatment. In contrast, the transcript of
ICME showed a regular pattern; it increased at 3 hr and
reached the maximum at 24 hr of ABA treatment.
Identification of T-DNA insertion lines

To explore the biological functions of the ICME family, TDNA insertion mutant lines were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, Ohio State
University, Columbus). For each gene, two different TDNA insertion lines were analyzed. A homozygous TDNA insertion line, SALK_008773, with a T-DNA
inserted at the 3’ UTR of ICME-LIKE1 was identified by
genomic DNA PCR and sequencing. However, this insertion neither disrupts the expression nor causes downexpression of ICME-LIKE1. Another line, SALK_011036

icme-like2-2

Seed germination of the wild type and icme-like2 mutants
in response to ABA, salt and osmotic stresses was examined. Both icme-like2-1 and icme-like2-2 showed similar
responses to the treatments. As shown in figure 6, in the
absence of ABA, no differences of germination were
observed between wild type and icme-like2-1 mutant. By
contrast, disruption of ICME-LIKE2 expression leads to
an increased sensitivity to ABA in seed germination, and
the ABA-sensitive phenotype was apparent at all concentrations of ABA tested. On the other hand, the wild-type
and the ICME-LIKE2 mutant showed no significant differences of cotyledon greening and seedling root growth
(data not shown). In addition, in the low concentration of
exogenous ABA, the difference was only observed in a
short span during the early time of seed germination;
whereas the differences were lasted for a much longer
time in the high concentrations of ABA.
In contrast to respond to ABA, overall, the icme-like2-1
mutant showed slightly decreased sensitivity to salt (figure 7) and osmotic (figure 8) stresses in seed germination
compared to the wild type. But these differences are significant only under specific concentration and stage
(labeled as * in figures 7 and 8), suggesting that ICMELIKE2 exerts its role in specific conditions and

according to ABRC), was identified without any insertions
at ICME-LIKE1, although the seeds could grow on Kanamycin containing MS medium and the transcript of Neomycin Phosphotransferase gene was also amplified by RTPCR from total RNA extracted from this line. These
results suggested that this line is a T-DNA insertion line
with the T-DNA inserted at other unknown position. In
contrast, the homozygous T-DNA insertion lines,
SALK_043448 (called icme-like2-1 here) and
SALK_002648 (called icme-like2-2 here) with a T-DNA
inserted at the 8th and 10th intron of ICME-LIKE2, respectively, were identified by genomic DNA PCR and sequencing (additional file 4). The expression of ICME-LIKE2
was disrupted by both insertions (figure 5). Similarly, the
homozygous T-DNA insertion lines, SALK_010304 (also
called icme-1 [22]) and SALK_075701 (called icme-2 here)
with a T-DNA inserted at the 1st intron and 11th exon of
ICME, respectively, were identified by genomic DNA PCR
and sequencing (additional file 5). Gene expression analysis showed that no transcripts (full-length ORF) of ICME
were detected in the two homozygous mutants (figure 5).
Overall, icme-like2-1, icme-like2-2, icme-1 and icme-2
mutants are not distinguishable from wild-type plants in
appearance under normal growth conditions (additional
file 6).
Moreover, all of them exhibited similar responses
when subjected to drought and salt stresses.

conditions of 16 hr light/8 hr dark cycle at 22°C. Seed germination was scored every day since transferring. All assays were repeated at least
three times with similar results. More than 108 seeds were used in each experiment. Asterisks represent significant differences from the wild type

mutants showed no significant differences of cotyledon
greening and seedling root growth in response to these
stresses.

Discussion
ICME is involved in the process of demethylating the
prenylated proteins in eukaryotic cells. An ICME was
recently reported in Arabidopsis and its related gene
was isolated [21]. Membranes isolated from S. cerevisiae
cells expressing the ICME gene contain specific enzyme
activity for relevant prenylcysteine methylesters [21].
Overexpression of ICME resulted in an ABA hypersensitive phenotype in stomatal closure and seed germination

[22]. Moreover, this gene was up-regulated by ABA in
Arabidopsis seedlings [22]. These results indicate that
the demethylation of prenylated proteins is involved in
at least some aspects, if not all, of ABA responses and
ICME is a positive regulator of ABA signaling.
Structurally, both ICME and its homologs in this study
belong to the esterase lipase superfamily containing two
highly conserved regions: (1) the GXSXG motif containing
the Ser nucleophile (figure 1A); and (2) the conserved catalytic triad possessing the nucleophile-acid-His-ordered
sequence (Ser, Asp, and His) (figure 1A). Initially, we identified ICME as an acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-like protein
with the attempt to clone the gene encoding AChE-like
protein in Planta since the AChE-like activity was detected
in maize seedlings [26]. Until now, it is still unclear

Figure 7 The icme-like2-1 mutant showed slightly decreased sensitivity to salt stress in seed germination. Seeds of wild-type and icmelike2-1 mutant were sown on MS medium with different concentration of NaCl and stratified at 4°C for 3 days, then transferred to growth room

whether ICME and its two homologs, ICME-LIKE1 and
ICME-LIKE2, possess enzyme activity to hydrolyze acetylthiocholine. In 2005, an AChE (NP_001105800) with 394
amino acids in length from maize seedlings was identified
and the related gene was cloned [27]. This AChE contains
the same conserved catalytic core as in the animal AChE,
possessing the enzyme activity of hydrolyzing acetylthiocholine and propyonylthiocholine, but not S-butyrylthiocholine. Moreover, its enzyme activity was totally inhibited
by neostigmine bromide, a specific inhibitor of animal
AChE [27]. However, the amino acid sequence of this
AChE showed no apparent similarity with that of the animal enzyme. Based on these, the authors proposed that
this AChE family is a novel family of enzymes in plant
kingdom. Amino acid sequence alignment showed ICME
and its homologs were exhibited very lower similarity with

that of the maize AChE (Data not shown), suggesting that
ICME and its homologs are not AChE-like proteins. In
2003, twenty carboxylesterases in Arabidopsis (AtCXE)
were systemically mined from Arabidopsis genome, and
the expression profile across a range of tissues was detected
by RT-PCR [24]. One of AtCXEs, AtCXE12, was reported
to possess enzyme activity for hydrolyzing the pro-herbicide methyl-2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate to the phytotoxic
acid 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [28]. It remains
unknown whether ICME and its homologs have such
enzyme activity to hydrolyze pro-herbicide methyl-2,4dichlorophenoxyacetate. Although all the 20 AtCXEs contains the conserved catalytic triad, amino acid sequence
alignment showed that ICME and its homologs are divergent from those AtCXEs. Moreover, none of AtCXEs is larger than 400 amino acids in length but ICME and its

Figure 8 The icme-like2-1 mutant showed slightly decreased sensitivity to osmotic stress in seed germination. Seeds of wild-type and
icme-like2-1 mutant were sown on MS medium with different concentration of mannitol and stratified at 4°C for 3 days, then transferred to
growth room under conditions of 16 hr light/8 hr dark cycle at 22°C. Seed germination was scored every day since transferring. All assays were

homologs are larger than 400 amino acids in length. In
addition, ICME and its homologs are lack of the conserved
sequence surrounding the motif known as the oxyanion
hole in AtCXEs. Phylogenetic analysis further showed that
ICME and its homologs and AtCXEs are clustered into different groups, respectively (figure 1C). These indicate that
ICME and its homologs may not possess the enzyme activity of AtCXEs. In 2007, another carboxylesterase, SOBER1
(At4g22300), was identified as suppressors of AvrBsT-elicited resistance in Arabidopsis [25]. SOBER1 and its homologs are also clustered into an independent group (figure
1C). Enzymes in this group are smaller than that of
AtCXEs and ICME and its homologs are less than 300
amino acids in length. Besides the conserved catalytic
triad, enzymes in this group contain another unique
“LHGLGD” motif in the N-terminal region that is not

present in the ICME and its homologs. In summary,
bioinformatic analysis in this study and previous biochemical evidence [21] suggest that ICME and its homologs may comprise a novel small subfamily of
carboxylesterase in plant kingdom, possibly with the prenylated protein as its specific substrate. Given the high
degree of similarity among ICME, ICME-LIKE1, and
ICME-LIKE2 in terms of sequence and subcellular localization (figure 2 and additional file 3), it is reasonable to
predict that ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2 possess
ICME activity. Direct biochemical evidence of ICME
activity of the ICME-like proteins is necessary for better
understanding their functions in plants in the future.
Documented data suggested that protein prenylation
and subsequent mature processing steps promote its
attachment to membrane and, in some cases, protein-

Lan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:212

protein interaction by increasing its C-terminal hydrophobicity [1-3]. In other words, with high possibility, a
maturely prenylated protein is a membrane protein or is
associated with the membrane system. ICME is involved
in demthylation of the prenylated proteins, the only
reversible process during protein prenylation modification. These suggest that ICME is likely a membraneresident protein. Previous biochemical analysis also
showed that enzyme activity of ICME was detected in
membrane fragment [20,21]. In the current study, more
precise sub-cellular localizations of ICME family were
provided using GFP tagged proteins. Initially, we fused all
ICME and its homologs in frame to the N-terminus of
GFP. Except for ICME, we failed to detect any fluorescent signal for GFP tagged ICME-LIKE1 and ICMELIKE2, suggesting that N-terminus fused GFP may be
unstable. We then fused these two proteins to the C-terminus of GFP and successfully detected the fluorescence.
The fluorescent signals clearly revealed that proteins of
the ICME family are intramembrane proteins

predominantly localizing at the ER and Golgi apparatus,
which was confirmed by co-expression of ER and Golgi
markers, BiP-RFP and ST-mRFP, respectively (figure 2
and additional file 3). These results also suggest that
many prenylated proteins, at least those that being in the
processes of demthylation, are targeted to ER and Golgi
apparatus. Subcellular proteomics of ER and Golgi apparatus may provide more information about protein prenylation and its mature process, which will be helpful to
explore the biological functions of protein prenylation.
When transiently expressing GFP-ICME-LIKE2, some
green vesicles surrounding the Golgi apparatus were
observed in some protoplasts (figure 2). At present, the
significance of these vesicles is unclear. We speculated
that (1) these vesicles were secreted from ER and being
sorted to the Golgi apparatus for its post-translational
modifications. Motif scanning showed that ICME-LIKE2
could be modified by glycosylation (at the 47 th and
213 th amino acids Asn) and other potential manners

vesicles modified in the Golgi apparatus were being
sorted to its final target, ER. Further cell biology experiments, especially pharmacogenetic analysis, are needed
to reveal the mechanisms underlying these vesicles.
Contrary results were obtained in predicting the transmembrane domain of ICME by using different programs
(Table 2). Zero and five transmembrane domains were
predicted for ICME with SOSUI and TMpred programs,
respectively. Deleting the putative transmembrane helix,
amino acids 102 nd to 124 th , did not block its ERtargeting. It can be concluded from this that ICME is an
intramembrane protein containing at least two transmembrane domains and predominantly localizing in the
ER and Golgi apparatus.
So far, the molecular information about the ICME
family is unavailable except that the expression of ICME
was up-regulated in Arabidopsis seedlings by ABA after
24 hrs. There is also a lack of information about the
expression profiles for ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2 in
the public database. Study here showed that the members of the ICME family are expressed across a range of
tissues with differential expression level (figure 3), indicating that ICME and its homologs may have broad
functions in Arabidopsis. On the other hand, this also
suggests the existence of functional redundancy among
the ICME family. The base transcript of ICME-LIKE2 is
quite low, indicating it is a low abundance gene. The
low detection sensitive of northern blotting may explain
why there is no public microarray data available. It is
also possible that the expression of ICME-LIKE2 is
indistinguishable from ICME due to their high similarity, leading to lack of expression information on ICMELIKE2 in the public microarray data. Lacking of the
expression information on ICME-LIKE1 in the public
microarray data is unexpected since its base transcript
abundance is similar to that of ICME (figure 3). Moreover, the transcript increased in response to cold, salt,
osmotic stresses and ABA treatment (figure4). The most
possible explanation for this is that the expression of
ICME-LIKE1 is indistinguishable from ICME because of
their high similarity.
By time-course assays, study here not only confirmed
the previous data that ICME was up-regulated by ABA
treatment after 24 hr [22], but also provided that ICME is
also a stress-regulated gene, which is consistent with the
public micoarray data https://www.genevestigator.com/
gv/directlink.jsp?geneIDs=AT5G15860. In addition,
ICME was dramatically up-regulated by other abiotic
stresses, including heat, mannitol, and salt treatment,
suggesting that ICME might be involved in stress
response. Indeed, prenylated proteins have been implicated in the processes in response to heat stress [29].
Although study here showed that disruption the expression of ICME (figure 5) caused no different phenotypes

Page 13 of 17

between wild type and mutant plants under normal and
drought and salt stress conditions (additional file 6 and
data not shown), whether the ICME activity is required
for tolerating heat stress is to be confirmed with icme
mutants, icme and icme-like2 double mutants and transgenic plants bearing over-expression of ICME.
By now, the biological functions of the ICME family
are largely unclear; the only confirmed function is that
the over-expression of ICME caused an ABA hypersensitive phenotype in stomatal closure and seed germination while icme-1 mutant exhibited an ABA insensitive
phenotype [22]. This is different from our data using
ICME-LIKE2 mutants. Knocking out the expression of
ICME-LIKE2 resulted in increased sensitivity to ABA in
seed germination (figure 6). These suggest that ICME
and ICME-LIKE2 may have different roles in seed germination in response to ABA. However, except that the
disruption of ICME-LIKE2 expression leads to increased
sensitivity to ABA and slightly decreased to salt and
osmotic stresses in seed germination, no significant differences were observed between wild type and mutant
plants in terms of other physiological functions tested.
Similarly, no significant differences were observed
between wild type and ICME mutants in other biological process in previous study [22], which has been confirmed in the current study (additional file 6). This may
be due to the existence of functional redundancy among
the ICME family. Firstly, the expression of the ICME
family is universal; secondly, the sub-cellular localizations of the ICME family are similar; thirdly, the expression patterns of the ICME family in response to abiotic
stresses and ABA is similar; and finally, the members of
the ICME family share high identity in amino acid and
contain the conserved functional domain. The biological
process of ICME-LIKE2 is worth further detailed study.
Some important facts about ICME-LIKE2 include (1) it
is a low abundance gene (figures 3 and 4); (2) its transcript abundance is induced by abiotic stresses and ABA
(figure 4); (3) it forms some vesicles around ER (figure
2); and (4) null mutants of ICME-LIKE2 are available
(figure 5). Based on these, it can be predicted that
ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2 are involved in ABA signaling and may also be involved in other stress
responses. To better understand the biological functions
of the ICME family, future works will be to identify null
or knock-down mutant of icme-like1 and construct double and triple mutants of the ICME family.

Conclusions
In this paper, the extended characterizations, sub-cellular localizations, expression profiles across different tissues and in response to abiotic stress and ABA of ICME
and its homologs as well as their physiological functions
are reported. These studies confirmed that there is a

similar sub-cellular localizations predominantly localizing at the ER and Golgi apparatus. The genes of the
ICME family are expressed across a broad range of tissues. Upon stress stimuli and ABA treatment, most of
the expressions of the IMCE family are up-regulated.
Single mutants of icme and icme-like2 do not show significant effects in plant growth, development and
responses to environmental stimuli. However, disruption
of the ICME-LIKE2 expression leads to increased sensitivity to ABA and slightly decreased sensitivity to salt
and osmotic stresses in seed germination. Double and
triple mutants of the ICME family may be better option
to explore their functions in future. The ABA and abiotic stress regulated genes reported here are potentially
useful resources for transgenic crops against drought
and other stresses.

Methods
Plant growth and treatments

Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia was used
throughout the current study.
Mutant seeds icme-like1-1 (SALK_008773), icme-like12 (SALK_011036), icme-like2-1 (SALK_043448), icmelike2-2 (SALK_002648), icme-1 (SALK_010304), and
icme -2 (SALK_075701) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, Ohio State
University, Columbus). Seeds were surface-sterilized and
sown on solid agar plates containing 1× Murashige and
Skoog (MS) salts, 1% (w/v) sucrose, 0.8% agar adjusted
to pH5.7. After stratified at 4°C for 3 days, they were
transferred to a growth chamber at 22°C under a 16-h
light/8-h dark photoperiod at 130 μEm-2sec-1.
Seven-day-old seedlings were used for different treatments: for salt, osmotic, and ABA treatment, seedlings
sowed on filters (which were put on 1× MS agar media)
were transferred to MS liquid media containing 200
mM NaCl, 400 mM mannitol, or 50 μM ABA for different time indicated. For cold and heat treatments, the
plates were transferred to 4°C freezer or 37°C growth
chamber. For dehydration test, seedlings were transferred to Petri dish covers and left at growth chamber
for different length of times. After treatment, seedlings
were collected in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for
RNA extraction.
Verification of the T-DNA insertion mutants

Homozygous mutant was identified by PCR from genomic DNA using gene-specific primers (Table 2) and
T-DNA left border primers LBa1, and analyzed further
by DNA sequencing to confirm the insertion of the
T-DNA in the gene.

Plasmid construction

ORFs encoding the full-length ICME-LIKE1, ICMELIKE2, and ICME were amplified by PCR with the specific primer pairs listed in Table 1. The PCR products
were inserted in-frame to the C-terminus (for ICMELIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2) or N-terminus (for ICME) of
the GFP gene in plasmid pAVA121 [30]. This plasmid
encodes an enhanced free GFP under the guide of 35 S
promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus and the NOS terminator, designated as pGFP here. The PCR products of
ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2 amplified with primer
pairs 1gBglII F/1gSpeI R and 3gBglII F/3gSpeI R, respectively, were digested with BglII and SpeI and ligated to
pGFP digested with BglII and XbaI to create pGFPICME-LIKE1 and pGFP-ICME-LIKE2, respectively.
Similarly, PCR product of ICME from primer pair
5gNcoI F/5gNcoI R was digested with NcoI and inserted
to pGFP, which was predigested with NcoI and followed
by further dephosphorylation with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Promega, USA). Constructs with correct orientation were selected by restriction assays and designated
as pICME-GFP.
Based on pICME-GFP, the putative transmembrane
domain (TM), amino acids 102 to 124, was deleted to
create plasmid pICMEΔTM-GFP by overlapping PCR.
Briefly, the first fragment was generated with primer
pair 5gΔTMF1/5gΔTMR1; while the second fragment
was synthesized with primer pair 5gΔTMF2/5gΔTMR2
(primer 5gΔTMF2 is complementary exactly to the primer 5gΔTMR1 in nucleotide sequence).
Next, overlapping PCR was performed with primer
pair 5gΔTMF1/5gΔTMR2 using the mixture of the first
and the second fragments as the PCR template. Following deletion, the final PCR product was digested with
NsiI and NheI and subcloned into pICME-GFP digested
with the same set of restriction enzymes to replace the
corresponding fragment of wild type cDNA. All the final
constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
Protoplast isolation, transformation, and Confocal
Microscopy

Protoplasts of N. benthamiana were isolated from suspension cell lines and co-transformed with plasmids
bearing free GFP or GFP tagged ICME or its homologs
and plasmids BiP-RFP or ST-mRFP [31], which are
widely used as the ER and Golgi apparatus markers,
respectively) as described earlier [32]. Confocal microscope images were taken using a confocal laser microscope MRC1024 under a ×63 water objective. DesRed
images were captured in the 560- to 615-nm range after
excitation at 543 nm with a HeNe laser beam. The GFP
images were captured in the 505- to 530-nm range after
excitation at 488 nm with an argon laser beam.

Particle bombardment

Onion epidermal cells were co-bombarded with 2.5 μg
of plasmids bearing free GFP, GFP tagged ICME or its
homologs and plasmids BiP-RFP or ST-mRFP [30]. All
the plasmids were coated onto 1-μm gold particles and
delivered into onion epidermal cells at a pressure of
900 psi by PDS 1000/He particle delivery system
(BioRad, U.S.A). After bombardment, onion slices of
2 × 2 cm were placed on a plate containing 1× MS
salts, 30 g/L of sucrose, 1.5% agar, pH = 5.7. After at
least 24 hr, the epidermis was removed from the onion
slice and observed using a Confocal Laser Scanning
Microscope.
Total RNA isolation, Semi-Quantitative RT-PCR and RealTime Quantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated from a broad range of tissues of
4-5 weeks old plants and seedlings of various treatments
using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and further treated
with DNase using the TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion)
according to the manufacturer’s manual. About 800 ng
DNA-free total RNA was converted to cDNA using
Oligo-dT (20) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer.
Briefly, after incubation at 50°C for 1 h followed by 85°
C for 5 min, 1 μl of RNase H was added and incubated
for 20 min at 37°C. The cDNA was used as a PCR template for both Semi-Quantitative RT-PCR and RealTime Quantitative RT-PCR.
For Semi-Quantitative RT-PCR, b-tubulin was used as
an internal control. Different PCR cycles (28, 30, and
35) were used for b-tubulin amplification to calculate
the cDNA amount for gene-specific amplification. A
total of 30 or 35 PCR cycles were used for ICMEs
amplification. The PCR program used was as follows:
pre-soaking in 94°C for 5 min, followed by different
cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec and 72°C for
45 sec. A final incubation at 72°C for 7 min was
included to complete product synthesis. PCR products
were separated on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.
For Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR, PCR amplification was performed in a 20 μl reaction system using
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems)
with programs recommended by the manufacturer (2
min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C and 40 cycles of 95°C for
15 sec and 60°C for 1 min). Three independent replicates were performed for each sample. The comparative
CT method was used to determine the relative amount
of gene expression, with the expression of tubulin (for
tissue expression patterns) or Actin8 gene (for expression profiles responding to biotic stimuli) used as an
internal control. The PCR was carried out in an ABI

Seed germination and early seedling development assays
Seed Germination

Plants of all genotypes were grown in the same conditions, and seeds were collected at the same time. For
each comparison, seeds were planted on the same plate
containing MS medium (0.5× MS salts, 1% Suc, and
0.8% agar) without or with different concentrations of
ABA, NaCl or mannitol as indicated. Plates were stratified at 4°C in the dark for 3 d and transferred to 22°C
with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle. The percentage of seed
germination was scored at the indicated times. Germination was defined as an obvious emergence of the radicle
through the seed coat.
Cotyledon greening

To study the effect of ABA and other osmotic agents on
cotyledon greening, seeds were sown on MS medium as
described above. Three days after stratification, germinated seeds were transferred to medium containing different concentrations of ABA or other osmotic agents
(NaCl and mannitol) as indicated. The percentage of
cotyledon greening was recorded at 7 d after the end of
stratification. Cotyledon greening is defined as obvious
cotyledon expansion and turning green.
Seedling root growth

To study the effect of ABA and or other osmotic
agents on seedling root growth, seeds were sown on
MS plates vertically in growth chamber. Five-day-old
seedlings were transferred to medium containing different concentrations of ABA or other osmotic agents
for another 5 days and root growth was measured after
the transfer.
Drought, salt treatment and determination of
transpiration rate

Drought tolerance test was examined in soil, 7-dayold seedlings were transplanted from MS plates to the
soil for another 2 weeks under normal growth conditions. Plants were then subjected to progressive
drought test by withholding water for specified times
or rosette leaves of similar developmental stages
(third to fifth true rosette leaves) were detached and
placed abaxial side up on open Petri dishes and
weighed at different time intervals at room temperature to determine transpiration rate. For salt treatment, 3-week-old plants were watered with salt
solution with increased concentration from 50 mM to
200 mM every four days. To minimize experimental
variations, the same numbers of plants were grown on
the same tray. The entire test was repeated for a
minimum of three times.
