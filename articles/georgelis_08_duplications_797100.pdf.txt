Abstract
Background: ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), which catalyses a rate limiting step in
starch synthesis, is a heterotetramer comprised of two identical large and two identical small
subunits in plants. Although the large and small subunits are equally sensitive to activity-altering
amino acid changes when expressed in a bacterial system, the overall rate of non-synonymous
evolution is ~2.7-fold greater for the large subunit than for the small subunit. Herein, we examine
the basis for their different rates of evolution, the number of duplications in both large and small
subunit genes and document changes in the patterns of AGPase evolution over time.
Results: We found that the first duplication in the AGPase large subunit family occurred early in
the history of land plants, while the earliest small subunit duplication occurred after the divergence
of monocots and eudicots. The large subunit also had a larger number of gene duplications than did
the small subunit. The ancient duplications in the large subunit family raise concern about the
saturation of synonymous substitutions, but estimates of the absolute rate of AGPase evolution
were highly correlated with estimates of ω (the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio). Both
subunits showed evidence for positive selection and relaxation of purifying selection after
duplication, but these phenomena could not explain the different evolutionary rates of the two
subunits. Instead, evolutionary constraints appear to be permanently relaxed for the large subunit
relative to the small subunit. Both subunits exhibit branch-specific patterns of rate variation among
sites.
Conclusion: These analyses indicate that the higher evolutionary rate of the plant AGPase large
subunit reflects permanent relaxation of constraints relative to the small subunit and they show
that the large subunit genes have undergone more gene duplications than small subunit genes.
Candidate sites potentially responsible for functional divergence within each of the AGPase
subunits were investigated by examining branch-specific patterns of rate variation. We discuss the
phenotypes of mutants that alter some candidate sites and strategies for examining candidate sites
of presently unknown function.

glucose is the predominant, if not sole, precursor for
starch synthesis. While AGPase is a homotetramer in bacteria (including cyanobacteria), it is a heterotetramer in
angiosperms and green algae. This heterotetramer comprises two identical large and two identical small subunits. They exhibit a high degree of identity to each other
and to the cyanobacterial AGPase, pointing to an origin
by gene duplication early in the evolution of plants and
green algae (Figure 1A) (Additional file 1) [1,2]. The two
subunits have complementary rather than redundant
functions, and knockout mutations in either abolish more
than 90% of AGPase activity in some experimental systems [3].
Although both subunits are necessary for full AGPase
activity, the angiosperm small subunit appears more conserved than the large subunit throughout its sequence
(small subunits exhibit an average of 91.3% amino acid
identity while large subunits an average of 70.8% identity) [2]. However, mean percent identities might be misleading since the genes encoding both subunit genes of
AGPase underwent a number of duplications after the initial duplication that generated the two subunits. The
potential confusion due to the comparison of paralogs
rather than orthologs can be overcome by methods that
incorporate phylogeny, such as the use of maximum likelihood (ML) to estimate ω (the ratio of non-synonymous
substitutions per non-synonymous site [KA] to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site [KS]). The ML
estimate of ω for the large subunit is ~2.7-fold greater than
the estimate for the small subunit [2], suggesting a higher
rate of amino acid replacement for the large subunit.
Although ω provides a convenient and commonly used
method to examine evolutionary constraints, it has typically been used to examine sequences that have diverged
relatively recently. The rate of synonymous evolution is
relatively high in plant nuclear genes [4-7] and estimates
of KS appear saturated in analyses of some angiosperm
gene families, even for relatively shallow evolutionary
divergences [8]. Hence, the accuracy of ω estimates for
ancient divergences is unclear. Another potential problem
for the use of ω is the assumption that mutations at synonymous sites are neutral. It has been suggested that synonymous sites are subject to both positive and purifying
selection [9-12]. The action of selection on synonymous
sites may explain why adding among-sites rate variation
for synonymous sites to models of codon evolution
improves their fit to empirical data [13,14]. Saturation
and among-sites rate variation both have the potential to
cause KS to be underestimated (and ω to be overestimated
since ω = KA/KS); biased estimates of ω will lead to incorrect inferences regarding evolutionary constraints on the
proteins being analyzed. Finally, ω cannot detect changes
in the evolutionary rate when rates of synonymous and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/232

non-synonymous substitution increase or decrease simultaneously [15].
The almost 3-fold difference in evolutionary rates for the
AGPase subunits is a paradox because random mutagenesis revealed that maize endosperm AGPase subunits
expressed in bacteria are equally susceptible to activityaltering amino acid changes [2]. Georgelis et al. [2] proposed that the difference in evolutionary rates between
AGPase subunits reflected, at least in part, the differences
between the subunits in their tissue-expression patterns
and the fact that the small subunit has to interact with
multiple large subunits in plants. Here, we establish the
pattern and timing of duplications in the AGPase gene
family and estimate absolute rates of AGPase sequence
evolution. Functional divergence has been observed
among AGPase subunits based on biochemical criteria
[16-20]. One of our primary goals was to identify candidate sites for functional divergence. We identify specific
AGPase sites apparently subject to either positive selection
or branch-specific patterns of rate variation (types-I and II divergence as defined by Gu [21,22]).

Results
Patterns of AGPase gene duplication
It is well known that genes can have three possible fates
after duplication [23-27]: (1) nonfunctionalization, in
which one duplicate is lost, (2) subfunctionalization, in
which the functions of the original single-copy gene are
partitioned between the duplicates, and (3) neofunctionalization, in which one duplicate gains a novel function.
The latter two processes can result in paralogs that persist
for a substantial length of time (although a few exceptions
have been proposed, such as pseudogene resurrection
[27]). Throughout this work, the term duplication will be
limited to the description of the latter two processes.
Although gene loss can be as important as duplication for
shaping genomes [28], we have avoided making major
conclusions based on gene loss since many organisms
included in these analyses lack complete genome
sequences.

Inclusion of AGPase sequences from the moss Physcomitrella patens [29], which has 7 large subunit and 4
small subunit genes, placed a major constraint on the earliest divergence within the large subunit family since the
moss sequences were intermixed with angiosperm
sequences. This indicates that the earliest duplication in
the large subunit family occurred prior to the divergence
of angiosperms and mosses, more than 400 million years
(MY) ago [30]. Since the rate of synonymous evolution in
angiosperms varies from ~2 × 10-9 to ~10 × 10-9 synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year [4-7],
values of KS in excess of 2 are expected for some comparisons, which may make estimates of KS problematic [31].

substitutions per site. ML bootstrap values > 50% are indicated above branches. Reconciled tree analyses (using the gene trees
shown and the species tree shown in Additional file 1) were conducted using GENETREE. Black boxes at nodes indicate duplication events. The arrow in B) indicates the divergence of Physcomitrella patens from angiosperms. The trees in B) and C) were
rooted with the AGPase large and small subunit from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii respectively. Thicker lines indicate branches
that follow duplication events and have KS < 0.1 (based upon ML estimates of synonymous branch lengths).
Since many divergence times for plants can be constrained
to reasonable ranges, it should be possible to estimate
absolute rates of AGPase subunit amino acid evolution
and establish whether they correlate with estimates of ω.
However, this requires differentiating between speciation
and gene duplication events in AGPase phylogeny. Gene
family phylogenies reflect both speciation and duplication events, and these events can be distinguished by reconciled tree analyses if the gene and species trees are
known. Gene tree parsimony [32] is the most commonly
used reconciled tree method, and the only approach practical for even moderately sized phylogenies at this time.
Reconciling the AGPase gene trees with the best available
estimate of the land plant species tree (Additional file 2)
revealed 11–14 large subunit duplications (Figure 1B)
and 5–7 small subunit duplications (Figure 1C). It may be
appropriate to view the lower estimates, which are based
upon well-supported nodes, as the primary results since
they are based on modified versions of the gene trees
(Additional file 3A, B) in which the topology was rearranged near poorly supported nodes to increase congruence with the species tree (Methods). In contrast, the
higher estimates were based only on reconciling the optimal estimates of the gene trees (Figure 1B, C) with the species tree. Regardless, both analyses indicate that the large
subunit genes underwent a larger number of duplications
than the small subunit genes.
AGPase large subunits have narrower tissue-specificity
than small subunits [33-38], and the large subunit phylogeny appears more complex (with four major clades
some of which include both monocots and eudicots; Figure 1B) than the small subunit phylogeny (Figure 1C).
Large subunit group 1 genes are predominantly expressed
in leaves, group 2 genes are expressed both in source and
sink tissues, group 3 genes are expressed sink tissues
(these genes are subdivided into group 3a in eudicots and
group 3b in monocots), and group 4 corresponds to a
clade of two sequences that have not been characterized
yet in terms of function and expression patterns (Figure

1B). Some of the major large subunit clades arose prior to
the divergence of monocots and eudicots, and the optimal
placement of the AGPase large subunit sequences from
Physcomitrella suggests that the first duplication in the
large subunit happened around 400 MY ago (Figure 1A).
In contrast, there is no evidence that angiosperm small
subunits underwent a duplication prior to the divergence
of monocots and eudicots, and we have divided them into
a monocot clade (group 1) genes and a eudicot clade
(group 2). These results emphasize that the large subunit
underwent a larger number of duplications than did the
small subunit and that only large subunit duplications
began before the divergence of monocots and eudicots.
Absolute rates of AGPase evolution
Absolute rates of amino acid evolution for AGPase subunits were estimated by examining terminal branch lengths
for divergences that reflect speciation events with known
divergence times (these divergence times are presented in
Additional file 2). This approach is called the tip procedure since it involves only terminal branches (Methods),
and it revealed that the average rate of evolution for the
large subunit was 2.7-fold faster than that of the small
subunit (Figure 2). This rate difference was both congruent with the difference in ML estimates of ω [2] and highly
significant (P = 0.0006 by Student's unpaired t-test). Our
conclusions were unchanged if we limited consideration
to strongly supported duplication events (those retained
when bootstrap support was considered; see Additional
file 3).

Estimates of the absolute rate of amino acid substitution
for AGPase subunits obtained by the penalized likelihood
(PL) method (Figure 3) were very similar to those
obtained using the tip procedure (Figure 2). Using gene
trees in which poorly supported nodes were rearranged to
minimize number of duplications yielded similar results
(Additional file 4, Figure 2). Thus, very similar estimates
of the absolute rate of amino acid substitution were

obtained despite the different assumptions made by the
tip procedure and the PL method.
The absolute rate of synonymous evolution was estimated
using ML estimates of KS (Additional file 5A, B). The tip
procedure resulted in virtually identical rates for both
large and small subunit genes (6.5 × 10-9 synonymous
substitutions per synonymous site per year; Additional
file 5C). PL rate estimates were 5.5 × 10-9± 0.3 × 10-9 and
6.3 × 10-9 ± 0.2 × 10-9 (mean ± standard error) synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year for the
large and small subunit, respectively (data not shown).

The slightly lower estimates based upon PL are consistent
with saturation being a problem, but presumably only for
the deepest branches in the tree. All of these values are
well within the range of previous estimates for a variety of
angiosperm genes (which range from approximately 2 ×
10-9 to 10 × 10-9 synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year and exhibit some variation among lineages [4-7,39,40]). This suggests that there are little to no
constraints on the synonymous sites of angiosperm
AGPase genes and, when combined with estimate of the
absolute rate of sequence evolution, that there was minimal bias in our estimates of ω.

Does the large subunit show temporary or permanent
elevation of ω?
Estimates of the mean rate of evolution for AGPase,
whether based upon ω [2] or the absolute rate of amino
acid substitution (Figure 2), show a substantially higher
rate for the large subunit. The existence of these rate differences despite identical sensitivities to mutations when
expressed in bacteria suggests that there are important differences in planta. Transient increases in the evolutionary
rate might explain the observed rate differences if they are
more common for the large subunit. Large-scale analyses
provide evidence for transient increase in the rate of nonsynonymous evolution. Indeed, paralogs with a recent
origin (defined as those with KS < 0.1) accumulate more
non-synonymous mutations per non-synonymous site
(and thus have a higher KA) relative to the number of the
synonymous mutation per synonymous site than older
duplicates [23]. Thus, ω is expected to be elevated for paralogs with KS < 0.1 relative to those with KS > 0.1. Lynch
and Conery [23] interpreted this phenomenon as reflecting a temporary relaxation of constraints, positive selection, or a combination of both phenomena. Thus, it is
important to consider the potential impact of the elevation of ω on our analyses of the evolutionary processes
that shaped the AGPase gene family.

The large subunit underwent more gene duplications than
did the small subunit (Figure 1). Thus, the higher mean
estimates of ω for the large subunit might reflect a larger
number of periods during which ω is elevated (due to
temporary relaxation of constraints and/or positive selection) rather than permanent relaxation of constraints for
the large subunit. To distinguish between transient and
permanent relaxation of constraint we tested whether the
non-synonymous rate was increased after duplication and
if the increase is sufficient to explain the observed differences in the mean rate. Branches in both large and small
subunit gene trees (Figure 1) were placed into two groups,
the first of which (class 1) contained branches that follow

a duplication event with KS = ~0.1 (these branches are
shown in Figure 1B, C and Additional file 3). The second
group (class 2) contained all other branches (branches
that follow either a speciation event or a duplication and
have KS > 0.1). We examined two nested models using the
likelihood ratio test (LRT) [41-45] to determine whether
ω for class 1 branches is higher than ω for class 2 branches
for either subunit using CODEML (included in PAML
software). The more complex model, which assumes two
different ω values (one ω for class 1 and one ω for class 2),
was favored over the null hypothesis model, which
assumes a single ω for both classes, for both the small subunit (2δlnL = 18.4; P < 0.001) and the large subunit (2δlnL
= 7.48; P = 0.005) (for details see Table 1). The ω estimate
for short branches following duplications was 1.3 to 1.5fold greater than the ω estimate for all the other branches
when the large subunit was examined and 2 to 2.8-fold
greater for the small subunit (Table 1). These results support periods of increased ω after duplications in the
AGPase gene family, due to the temporary relaxation of
constraints, positive selection, or both. However, these
results also indicate that this phenomenon cannot explain
the differential rates of amino acid sequence divergence of
the two AGPase subunits, since estimates of ω for the large
subunit are 2.6-fold greater than estimates for the small
subunit (Table 1). Instead these results suggest that the
small subunit is permanently subject to greater purifying
selection than is the large subunit.
What is the role of positive selection in AGPase evolution?
To examine the potential role of positive selection in
AGPase evolution, we used ML to compare two distinct
sets of models. The first model set contains a neutral
(null) model M1a allowing two categories of sites, one
with ω = 0 and one with ω = 1, and model M2a that adds
an extra category of sites with ω > 1. The second includes
a neutral (null) model M7 assuming that ω is β-distributed among sites and model M8 that adds an extra category of sites with ω > 1 [46]. Neither of the models with

The branches of the trees shown in Figure 1B and Additional file 3A (large subunit) or Figure 1C and Additional file 3B (small subunit) were
classified into two groups. One group includes the short branches (KS < 0.1) following a duplication event (post-duplication; class 1) and the other
group includes all the other branches (class 2). The overall ω value of each group and the overall ω value of all branches were estimated by
CODEML. The LRT was used to compare the model with two different ω values (one for class1 branches and one for class 2 branches) to the null
hypothesis model with a single ω value.

positive selection was significantly better than the null
model based upon the LRT for either of the subunits when
the tests were applied to the complete trees for the small
subunit (Figure 1C) or large subunit (Figure 1B) (data not
shown). Likewise, neither of the models that include positive selection was significantly better when the tests were
applied to the individual groups (Figure 1B, C) within
each subunit (groups 1, 2, 3A, and 3B for the large subunit
as well as groups 1, and 2 for the small subunit) (data not
shown). These results indicate either that positive selection has not played a role in the evolution of the large and
small subunit of AGPase in the angiosperms or that these
tests have insufficient power.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/232

type-I divergence is the dominant pattern of sequence
evolution for AGPase large and small subunit groups.

Functional divergence of AGPase subunits
Gu [21,22,47] proposed that specific sites in proteins have
the potential to undergo two distinct types of divergences
after gene duplication (e.g., divergence among the different groups within the large and small subunits), and these
types were designated type-I and type-II divergence. Sites
that have undergone type-I divergence are conserved in
one group but variable in another group while type-II sites
are fixed in both groups but differ between groups
[21,22].

Sites contributing to functional divergence among AGPase
groups
We identified the sites likely to be involved in the changes
of functional constraints between groups revealed by the
significant values of θI using a posterior probability analysis (Additional file 7). A greater number of large subunit
sites appear to have undergone type-I divergence than the
number of small subunit sites. Specifically, for an alignment with 453 amino acids we found evidence that 78
large subunit sites and 13 small subunit sites show evidence for type-I divergence (Additional file 8). These sites
appear randomly distributed with respect to secondary
structure (data not shown), but pairwise comparisons
among groups in the large and the small subunit reveal
some non-random patterns in the distribution of sites that
are conserved in one group but not another. For instance,
large subunit group 1 proteins (leaf isoforms) had more
conserved sites in the N-terminus while group 3a proteins
(sink isoforms) exhibited more conserved in the C-terminus. The large subunit crystal structure has not been elucidated yet. However, the high degree of amino acid
sequence identity (~43%) and similarity (~61%) [2]
(Additional file 1) to the small subunit along with structure modelling (unpublished data) strongly suggest that
the 3D structure of the large subunit is almost identical to
the known structure of the small subunit. The N-terminal
domain includes the active site that resembles a Rossman
fold while the C-terminal domain is a β-helix that extensively interacts with the N-terminal domain based on the
structure of the potato tuber small subunit elucidated by
Jin et al. [49]. Both domains are important for stability
and catalytic/allosteric properties of the enzyme [49-52],
but the non-random spatial distribution of type I sites
clearly suggests these sites should be targeted in mutational studies focused on the analysis of AGPase structure/
function relationships.

Tests for types-I and -II divergence based upon the relevant coefficients of divergence (θ), which correspond to
the probability that a specific site has undergone type-I or
-II divergence in a pairwise comparison, were proposed by
Gu [21,22,48]. These tests for types-I and -II establish
whether the relevant θ value is significantly greater than
zero. We conducted all possible pairwise comparisons
among small (groups 1 and 2) and large (groups 1,2, 3a
and 3b) subunits with the exception of group 4 of large
subunits (that were excluded because the group included
only two sequences). All of type-I coefficients (θI) of functional divergence were significantly greater than zero
while none of the type-II coefficients (θII) were significantly greater than zero (Table 2). The estimates of θI are
also much larger than the estimates of θII, suggesting that

In contrast to the significant estimates of θI, estimates of
θII (the type-II coefficient) were not significantly greater
than zero. However, the power of the test for type-II divergence is unclear. To determine whether there was any evidence for type-II divergence we examined the sequences to
determine whether any specific sites show evidence for
this type of divergence. The likelihood that these sites
reflect bona fide instances of type-II divergence would be
increased if they correspond to sites that have been identified in mutagenesis studies. The posterior ratio test,
using a cut-off 2 (i.e., a posterior probability of 0.5), identified a few potential type-II sites (Additional file 9). Some
sites were also identified by analyses of positive selection
and one has an important function revealed by mutagenesis (see Discussion), so it is reasonable to postulate that

To increase the power of our tests for positive selection,
we used branch-site models to examine the potential for
positive selection at specific sites in all tree branches separately (Methods). There are branches in the large or small
subunit tree on which specific sites may be subject to positive selection (Figure 4), with a total of 0.8 and 0.2 sites/
branch potentially affected by positive selection for the
large and the small subunit respectively (Additional file
6). However, the limited number of sites potentially
affected by positive selection suggests that purifying selection is the major force in the evolution of both AGPase
subunits in angiosperms. Thus, positive selection cannot
explain the different rates of amino acid evolution for the
AGPase subunits.

at least some of these sites reflect genuine instances of
type-II divergence that have contributed to the specialization among the large and small subunits.

Discussion
The large and the small subunit of AGPase in plants
exhibit considerable sequence identity [1,2] and they
reflect a gene duplication that occurred prior to the divergence of land plants and green algae. Both subunits are
equally sensitive to activity-altering amino acids, at least
when expressed in a bacterial system [2]. However, the
small subunit of angiosperms is more conserved than
large subunit based upon estimates of the rate of evolution (both estimates of ω [2] and estimates of the absolute
rate of amino acid evolution). These results suggest saturation has not had a major impact upon the estimation of
ω for angiosperm AGPases, and this may reflect, at least in
part, the limited codon bias of these genes (data not
shown) since codon bias can have a major impact on the
estimation of KS [8]. They also suggest that estimation of
the absolute rate of amino acid evolution provides a valid
method that can be used as an alternative to ω analysis
when the use of ω is not appropriate (e.g., ancient divergences, especially for gene families with strong codon
bias, and for gene families where there is evidence for
strong selection on synonymous sites). Taken as a whole,
these results confirm that plant AGPases represent a genuine paradox: the large and small subunits exhibit similar
sensitivities to activity-altering changes but differ almost
3-fold in their rates of non-synonymous evolution.
Although a temporary elevation of ω after duplication was
observed for both large and small subunit gene families,
this transient elevation cannot account for the overall difference in ω value (and the related difference in the overall
rate of amino acid substitutions) between the two subunits. Additionally, although both subunits appear to have

been subject to positive selection the observed rate differences are too large to be explained by postulating that they
reflect greater differences in positive selection. Based upon
the falsification of these hypotheses, we conclude that the
small subunit has been evolving under stronger purifying
selection than the large subunit.
Consistent with the numbers of large and small subunit
genes found in the sequenced plant genomes [2,35,38],
reconciled tree analyses indicated that large subunit genes
underwent more duplications than small subunit genes.
Both phylogeny and molecular clock analyses indicate
that the initial duplication in the large subunit family of
angiosperms occurred ca. 400 MY ago, close to the divergence of angiosperms and bryophytes [30] (Figure 3A and
Additional file 4A). In contrast, the oldest retained small
subunit duplicates date back to 120–140 MY ago, after the
divergence of monocots and eudicots (Figure 3B and
Additional file 4B). The reason why the large subunit had
more ancient and duplications than did the small subunit
remains enigmatic. Macroevolutionary models that can
be applied to gene families are poorly developed, so it
remains possible that the observed difference is coincidental. Alternatively, the large subunit might have a
greater ability to undergo subfunctionalization after
duplication. The fact that 7 large subunit genes and 4
small subunit genes can be identified in the Physcomitrella
genome suggests similar patterns in both mosses and
angiosperms. However, more rigorous tests to distinguish
among these scenarios must await both the acquisition of
additional data from additional deep-branching landplant lineages (e.g., liverworts and hornworts) and the
development of better models of gene family macroevolution.

barley, have shown that the large subunit is tissue specific
while the small subunit is more broadly expressed [3338]. Based on these studies, the major large subunit
groups (Figure 1B) are likely to be expressed in different
tissues in most or all plants. The tissue-specificity of large
subunit genes suggests the expression patterns of these
genes might undergo subfunctionalization after duplication, as predicted by the "DDC model" of gene duplication [53]. The DDC model predicts that duplicated genes
are preserved by complementary changes in their expression pattern (e.g., a broadly expressed gene might
undergo duplication and have one duplicate expressed in
a specific tissue like leaves while the other duplicate is
expressed elsewhere). Although the potential for subfunctionalization due to changes in gene expression to preserve duplicated genes is generally accepted [54,55], it
also remains possible that distinct AGPase genes have specialized in terms of protein function (e.g., their pH optima
might have shifted based upon the specific tissues in
which the paralogs are expressed). The relative contributions of subfunctionalization and specialization or neofunctionalization to gene family evolution are open
questions [56,57], and it is unclear that there is any reason
why the large subunit would be more likely to undergo
specialization at either the protein or gene expression
level. Such a model, which postulates that subfunctionalization of gene expression was followed by specialization,
is similar to a combined model called subneofunctionalization [57]. The subneofunctionalization model postulates that subfunctionalization occurs shortly after
duplication while neofunctionalization is a more prolonged process [56,57]. If the combined model were
applied to AGPases, the initial preservation of paralogous
AGPase genes immediately after duplication might reflect
subfunctionalization but this process would be followed
by adaptation to the more specialized domains of expression in which each of the paralogs are expressed. Either a
neofunctionalization or a subneofunctionalization model
would be consistent with the evidence that different large
subunit groups have functionally diverged from each
other at the protein level (Figure 4, Table 2). However,
subneofunctionalization provides a means to directly link
the divergence of expression patterns and divergence at
the protein level. Corroborating the subneofunctionalization will require correlating gene expression and sequence
divergence for a large number of plants.
Differences in their patterns of expression represent the
major difference between the large and small subunits
that could explain the differences in their rates of evolution, since broadly expressed genes are more conserved
than tissue-specific genes [58-60]. However, this raises the
question of why broadly expressed genes, like AGPase
small subunit genes, exhibit slower rates of evolution.
Although it may simply be that mutations in broadly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/232

expressed genes have a greater impact on fitness or
because these genes have to function in multiple cellular
environments [58], a simpler explanation might be that
small subunit genes have to function with multiple large
subunit genes. Georgelis et al. [2] presented data consistent with this possibility, since they showed that the effects
of several amino acid changes in the maize endosperm
small subunit on enzyme activity depended on the identity of the large subunit [maize endosperm large subunit
(SHRUNKEN-2)(SH2) and maize embryo large subunit
(AGPLEMZM) were used]. Both SH2 and AGPLEMZM are
members of group 3b (Figure 1B), so these results suggest
that even fairly similar large subunit genes can interact differently with small subunits.
In addition to the potential for subfunctionalization due
to changes in gene expression, the observation that estimates of θI for large subunit groups were significantly
greater than zero suggests that it will be possible to
attribute differences among AGPase genes to specific
amino acid changes. We found 99 candidate sites of the
large subunit likely to have been involved in rate shifts
(either type-I or -II divergence; Additional files 8 and 9).
At least some of these putative rate shift residues are likely
to have contributed to functional changes among the different large subunit groups. The estimate of θI for the
small subunit groups 1 (monocot) and 2 (eudicot) is also
significantly greater than zero. It was possible to find evidence for 13 type-I candidate sites in the small subunit
alignment. Like the large subunit, the estimate of θII for
the small subunit was not significantly greater than zero.
Nonetheless, there were two potential type-II sites could
be identified (Additional file 9).
A total of 21 candidate sites for positive selection could be
identified in the large subunit branches following duplications that led to different groups (Branch numbers:
4,6,9,11,12,13,16 shown in Additional file 6), and six of
these sites overlapped with the set of sites that appear to
have undergone either type-I (sites 341, 364, 445) or typeII (sites 106, 114, 382) divergence. Biochemical and
genetic studies confirm that at least one of the sites (sites
106) is important for AGPase activity. This site is a threonine (T) in large subunit groups 3a and 3b but a lysine (K)
in groups 1 and 2 and in all small subunits. The potato
tuber large subunit, which falls into group 3a, has a T at
site 106 and it forms an inactive complex if it is combined
with an inactivated potato tuber small subunit [61].
Changing this T in the potato tuber large subunit to a K
actually results (the T106K mutant) in a complex with
some activity with the same inactivated potato tuber small
subunit [61]. These results were interpreted as evidence
that the large subunit lost its catalytic ability partly
because of the K to T change. Although the K residue at site
106 may be necessary for catalysis if the small subunit is

Page 11 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:232

inactive, another model that explains the data would be
one in which the wild-type large subunits (which have a T
at site 106) require prior catalysis by the small subunit
before they perform catalysis by themselves. Such a catalytic mechanism has been proposed for the Escherichia coli
AGPase [62]. The T residue at site 106 is absolutely conserved in large subunit groups 3 and the branch-site
model suggests positive selection for the T immediately
following the duplication that generated group 3 (Additional file 6). This suggests that this change was important
for enzymatic activity and beneficial for the plants.
Indeed, the overall activity of a complex that includes the
T106K mutant of the potato tuber large subunit and the
wild-type potato tuber small subunit showed significantly
reduced activity relative to wild-type potato tuber AGPase
[63].
One potential type-II site (site 507) and four sites that represent candidates for positive selection on branches that
immediately follow duplications (sites 104, 230, 441,
445) have been shown to be important for the allosteric
properties of AGPase [[49,64,65], Hannah personal communication]. However, most of the candidate sites for
either rate shifts or positive selection do not have a known
function.
The existence of type-I and type-II divergence among
AGPase subunit groups along with the detection of positively selected sites after duplications that led to different
groups in the large subunit provide evidence for functional divergence especially among the large subunit
groups. Our data are consistent with biochemical studies
showing that the four possible AGPase complexes in Arabidopsis, which have a single functional small subunit gene
and four distinct large subunit genes (belonging to different groups in Figure 1B), have different kinetic and allosteric properties [16]. There is further evidence for
functional divergence among plant AGPases, since the
maize and barley endosperm AGPases are less dependent
than potato tuber AGPase on the allosteric activator 3PGA for activity and the maize endosperm AGPase is more
heat labile than potato tuber AGPase [17-20]. Functional
divergence among the different subunit groups was also
suggested by Georgelis et al. [2], who showed that all
groups of large subunit genes have ω values (which range
from 0.073 to 0.132) that exceed those for small subunit
genes (which range from 0.027 to 0.054). These results are
consistent with the rate shifts within the large and the
small subunit families that were observed in the present
study and they further imply that the various groups of
plant AGPases have undergone functional divergence. The
present study also identifies specific residues that are
likely to have contributed towards that divergence. Site
directed mutagenesis of these candidate sites is likely to
shed some light on their functions and reveal the propor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/232

tion of candidate sites that reflect type II error for tests to
identify sites subject to rate shifts and positive selection.
A number of angiosperm AGPases have been successfully
expressed in E. coli and purified, including maize
endosperm AGPase [66], potato tuber AGPase [67], and
all possible Arabidopsis AGPase complexes [16]. The most
straightforward candidate sites to test are the type-II sites
and those subject to positive selection, where it is possible
to change the relevant residue either to the amino acid
present in the other group (for type-II sites) or the ancestral amino acid (for positively selected sites). Testing typeI sites may be more challenging, since there is not a clear
way to swap the residues present in a member of the focal
group of proteins with that in a different group. However,
it is reasonable to predict that any of the residues present
in the group of proteins for which the site is variable
should alter the biochemical activity of a protein in which
the site is invariant. Regardless of the specific strategies for
generating mutants, mutant large or small subunits could
be expressed in E. coli along with a wild-type version of the
other subunit, the relevant complex purified, and the
properties of the enzyme determined to allow the impact
of the mutations to be studied. This will allow elucidation
of the importance of the sites in enzyme activity. Ultimately, it will be interesting to determine whether these
sites are important for the kinetic and allosteric properties
of AGPase, for enzyme stability for the pH optimum, or
for multiple properties.

Conclusion
Herein, we validated and extended the observation, initially based upon estimates of ω [2], that the AGPase large
subunit accumulated non-synonymous substitutions
more rapidly than the small subunit in angiosperms by
estimating absolute rates of amino acid change. The earliest duplication in the large subunit family of angiosperms
was close to the time that angiosperms and mosses
diverged (~400 MY ago;[30]). The large subunit underwent a larger number of duplications than the small subunit, which only began to duplicate after the divergence of
monocots and eudicots. We suggest that the large subunit
evolved faster due to permanently relaxed constraints
since positive selection and sporadic episodes of relaxed
constraints cannot account for the different rates of evolution between the large and the small subunit.
Large subunit genes exhibit narrower tissue specificity
than small subunit genes in terms of their gene expression
patterns [33-38], and they are likely to have experienced
subfunctionalization in terms of expression patterns.
However, we use analyses of rate shifts and positive selection to demonstrate that different groups of both large
and small subunits are likely to have diverged at the protein level. We have identified candidate amino acid sites

with the potential to account for the functional divergence
and described strategies for site-directed mutagenesis
experiments that could shed light into the specific roles of
these sites.

Methods
Sequence Retrieval and Alignment
Full-length AGPase sequences from plants were retrieved
from the NCBI database and the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) web site, and the source and accession numbers
of all sequences are presented in Additional file 10. DNA
and protein sequence alignments were obtained using the
MEGA software [68] with BLOSUM matrix followed by
manual inspection. The poorly aligned N-termini (~70–
80 amino acids for the large subunit and ~40 amino acids
for the small subunit) were excluded from alignment. The
large subunit amino acid numbers used correspond to the
protein encoded by the maize Shrunken-2 (Sh2) gene
(Accession #: P55241) while the small subunit amino
acid numbers used correspond to the protein, encoded by
the maize Brittle-2 (Bt2) gene (Accession #: AAQ14870).
Phylogenetic analysis
Estimates of AGPase gene trees based upon nucleotide
data were obtained using the GARLI (Genetic Algorithm
for Rapid Likelihood Inference) software [69]. Estimates
of phylogeny estimated for protein sequence alignments
were obtained either using neighbor joining in the MEGA
software or ML in the RAxML software [70], using the JTT
model [71] in both cases (to estimate distances or calculate likelihoods). Bootstrap support [72] was calculated
using 100 replicates.

Branch lengths were estimated by ML, with those form
amino acid trees based estimated using AAML, using the
Dayhoff (PAM) model [73] with Γ-distributed rates. Nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (KA)
and synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (KS)
and the ratio of these values (ω = KA/KS) were estimated
using CODEML. AAML and CODEML are programs in the
PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood)
package [74].
Reconciled tree analysis
Reconciled tree analyses map a gene tree onto a species
tree [75,76], and most commonly used procedure for
doing this is gene tree parsimony, which minimizes the
number of duplication events needed to explain a specific
gene tree given the species tree [32]. However, some error
is typically associated with estimates of phylogeny for
individual genes, and accommodating error in gene trees
is difficult in reconciled tree analyses [75]. Chen et al. [77]
suggested an algorithm that rearranged gene trees to
increase congruence with the species tree when nodes in
the gene tree were poorly supported to limit the impact of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/232

error in the gene tree. We implemented this idea manually, by rearranging nodes in the gene tree with limited
support (those with bootstrap support < 70%; see [78]) to
increase the congruence with the species tree. This yielded
two estimates of the numbers of duplications, one based
on the optimal gene trees and a conservative estimate
based on well-supported nodes.
Estimation of the absolute rate of evolution
Estimates of the absolute rate of amino acid evolution and
synonymous site evolution for each subunit were
obtained using the "tip procedure", which uses the average number of amino acid substitutions per site along
unique paths from each tip (extant sequence) to a dated
speciation event (allowing us to avoid pseudoreplication
of rate estimates). In addition to this method, absolute
rates of amino acid substitution were also obtained by
estimating the age of each node after smoothing rates
using penalized likelihood in r8s ("PL method") [79]. The
PL method was used because the tip method is biased
towards recent branches, although the PL method also has
the potential to be affected by saturation, especially for
synonymous sites.
Detection of branch-specific patterns of rate variation
among sites and positive selection
Type-I and type-II functional divergence among large or
small subunit groups was examined using the DIVERGE
software [48], which implements the tests suggested by
Gu [22,47] that can be used to determine whether the
coefficients of divergence (θI and θII) are significantly
greater than zero. Amino acid sites likely to have undergone types-I or -II divergence were detected as those with
a posterior probability > 0.5–0.6.

Sites subject to positive selection were identified using the
site, branch and branch-site models implemented in
CODEML, using the model comparisons recommended
by Yang et al. [80]. The first comparison was between
model M1a, which includes two ω values (one for sites
subject to purifying selection with ω < 1 and one for neutral sites with ω = 1) and model M2a (which adds positively selected sites [with ω > 1] to model M1a). The
second comparison was between model M7, which
assumes values of ω at different sites are β-distributed, and
model M8 (which adds positively selected sites to model
M7). We also searched for positive selection by estimating
different values of ω for each branch and using branch-site
models. For the first test, we compared a model specified
as model = 2 NSsites = 2 to model M1a [81]. For the second test, we compared a model specified as model = 2
NSsites = 2 to a model whose specifications are model = 2
NSsites = 2 fix_omega = 1 and omega = 1. When the likelihood ratio test was significant, the Bayes empirical Bayes

method was used to calculate posterior probabilities that
sites were subject to positive selection [82].
