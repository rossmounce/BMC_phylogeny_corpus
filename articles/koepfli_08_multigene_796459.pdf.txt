Abstract
Background: Adaptive radiation, the evolution of ecological and phenotypic diversity from a
common ancestor, is a central concept in evolutionary biology and characterizes the evolutionary
histories of many groups of organisms. One such group is the Mustelidae, the most species-rich
family within the mammalian order Carnivora, encompassing 59 species classified into 22 genera.
Extant mustelids display extensive ecomorphological diversity, with different lineages having
evolved into an array of adaptive zones, from fossorial badgers to semi-aquatic otters. Mustelids
are also widely distributed, with multiple genera found on different continents. As with other
groups that have undergone adaptive radiation, resolving the phylogenetic history of mustelids
presents a number of challenges because ecomorphological convergence may potentially confound
morphologically based phylogenetic inferences, and because adaptive radiations often include one
or more periods of rapid cladogenesis that require a large amount of data to resolve.
Results: We constructed a nearly complete generic-level phylogeny of the Mustelidae using a data
matrix comprising 22 gene segments (~12,000 base pairs) analyzed with maximum parsimony,
maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. We show that mustelids are consistently
resolved with high nodal support into four major clades and three monotypic lineages. Using
Bayesian dating techniques, we provide evidence that mustelids underwent two bursts of
diversification that coincide with major paleoenvironmental and biotic changes that occurred
during the Neogene and correspond with similar bursts of cladogenesis in other vertebrate groups.
Biogeographical analyses indicate that most of the extant diversity of mustelids originated in Eurasia
and mustelids have colonized Africa, North America and South America on multiple occasions.

Conclusion: Combined with information from the fossil record, our phylogenetic and dating
analyses suggest that mustelid diversification may have been spurred by a combination of faunal
turnover events and diversification at lower trophic levels, ultimately caused by climatically driven
environmental changes. Our biogeographic analyses show Eurasia as the center of origin of
mustelid diversity and that mustelids in Africa, North America and South America have been
assembled over time largely via dispersal, which has important implications for understanding the
ecology of mustelid communities.

Background
"Wave after wave of immigration came in from Asia,
recruiting the fauna at each successive stage, but leaving
little opportunity for new types to arise here. Even those
genera which seem to be of native origin, might prove to
be immigrants, if all their history were known ([1], p
593)."
The diversification of the Mustelidae (Carnivora, Mammalia) is a striking example of adaptive radiation, the evolution of ecological and phenotypic diversity from a
common ancestor [2]. Mustelids exhibit both locomotor
and dietary diversity, with taxa that are fossorial (badgers), semi-arboreal (martens) and semi-aquatic (otters),
and diets that vary from specialization on rodents (weasels) to piscivory (otters). Ecomorphological diversity in
the family is thus correspondingly high, reflecting the
adaptation of different species of mustelids to different
habits and habitats. As with other cases of adaptive radiation [3], resolving relationships within the Mustelidae,
especially among genera, has been challenging. Many taxonomic schemes proposed for mustelids within the last
century were based on morphology and classified genera
into various numbers of subfamilies [4,5] whose boundaries were largely determined by ecomorphological similarity. At one extreme, Pocock [4] divided extant mustelids
into 15 (mostly monotypic) subfamilies based on descriptive analyses of external characters (e.g. structure of the
rhinarium and feet). At the other end, the system proposed by Simpson [5] cast mustelids into five subfamilies
based on both phylogeny and 'similarity in adaptiveness'
of constituent genera: Lutrinae (otters), Melinae (badgers), Mellivorinae (honey badger), Mephitinae (skunks)
and Mustelinae (martens and weasels). While such a
scheme may indeed reflect the true phylogeny in some
instances, morphological similarity does not necessarily
imply phylogenetic affinity, as has been well demonstrated in certain groups that exemplify adaptive radiation
(e.g. Anolis lizards [6]). Moreover, such criteria can lead to
recognition of polyphyletic grades rather than monophyletic groups. Nonetheless, Simpson's subfamilial classification of the Mustelidae has been followed for many
years, although the latest classification provisionally
places all mustelids (excluding skunks and stink badgers)
into two subfamilies, Lutrinae and Mustelinae [7]. This

latter scheme was proposed in recognition of demonstrated paraphyly of the traditional subfamilies by more
recent morphological-based phylogenetic studies [8].
During the last decade, DNA sequence-based studies have
begun to challenge the validity of the five-subfamily
scheme and even monophyly of the family itself. Studies
using both mitochondrial and nuclear sequences have
consistently demonstrated that skunks and stink badgers
(Mydaus) descend from a common ancestor and together
form a lineage (Mephitidae) that diverged prior to the
split between Mustelidae and Procyonidae [9-11]. These
studies and those more focused on mustelids [12-17] have
also suggested that: (i) the Lutrinae is monophyletic; but
that (ii) both Melinae and Mustelinae are polyphyletic.
However, phylogenetic relationships within the family
remain uncertain or unknown because taxon sampling,
especially for genera, has been incomplete. Further, adequate character sampling is also an important issue
because adaptive radiations are often composed of lineages that have rapidly diverged [2,3]. Short stem lengths
of topologies revealed in recent studies, albeit with
incomplete taxon sampling [11,13] suggests that deeper
lineages of mustelids may have radiated within a short
span of time. Adequate character sampling is therefore
critical in achieving an accurate, well-resolved and robust
phylogenetic hypothesis.
Fossil evidence indicates that the biogeographic history of
mustelids is characterized by numerous intercontinental
dispersals, primarily originating from Eurasia where the
earliest fossil remains of the family (of Late Oligocene
age) are found [18,19]. For instance, a large majority of
mustelid diversity in North (and South) America is considered to have originated from lineages that repeatedly
dispersed from Eurasia via the Bering land bridge [19,20].
The earliest immigrants to North America arrived in the
Early Miocene and included a paraphyletic group of stem
taxa referred to as 'paleomustelids', whose affinities to
crown group mustelids ('neomustelids') remains ambiguous, as well as genera that belonged to the extinct subfamily Leptarctinae [20-25]. The first appearance of
various mustelid genera in North America is used to help
define the beginning of biostratigraphic boundaries of
North American land mammal ages (NALMAs) during the

BMC Biology 2008, 6:10

Neogene [19,26]. For example, the first appearance of
extinct genera Trogonictis and Sminthosinis and extant genera Lutra and Mustela help mark the latest Hemphilian
NALMA (Late Miocene-Early Pliocene, 5.9-4.7 million
years ago (MYA)) [19]. There is still uncertainty, however,
about the exact number of intercontinental dispersal
events underlying the biogeographic distribution of
extant genera and species and, therefore, how much of
mustelid continental diversity is a result of in situ versus ex
situ evolution. Further, the sequence of dispersal events
has been difficult to decipher, stemming from incompleteness of the fossil record. Clarifying the biogeographic
history of mustelids has implications for understanding
the community ecology of mustelids. Multiple species of
mustelid are often found in the same community and
consequently they have been the subject of important
studies on character displacement and resource partitioning [27-29]. However, many of these studies lacked a historical perspective (via phylogeny), which has been
shown to exert a strong influence on community assembly and structure [30,31].
Here, we present a nearly complete generic-level phylogeny of the Mustelidae using ~12,000 base pairs (bp) of
mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data obtained from 22
gene segments. We use this phylogeny to address three
objectives. First, we compare our phylogenetic hypothesis
with previous hypotheses generated with morphological
or molecular data. Second, we estimate relative divergence
times using new Bayesian relaxed molecular clock methods to understand the temporal pattern of diversification
in the family. Do mustelids exhibit one or more bursts of
rapid cladogenesis characteristic of many adaptive radiations [2]? Moreover, correlation of divergence times with
paleoenvironmental changes can provide insight into the
mechanisms that might have been responsible for bursts
of diversification [32]. Finally, we assess the biogeographic history of the Mustelidae, especially with regard to
understanding dispersal history between continents of the
Old World (Africa and Eurasia) and those of the New
World (North and South America).

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic relationships
Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP),
two different methods of maximum likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian inference (BI) all recovered the same hypothesis
for intergeneric relationships, which resolves Mustelidae
into seven primary divisions that include four major
clades and three monotypic lineages (Figure 1). Otters
(Aonyx, Enhydra, Hydrictis, Lontra, Lutra, Lutrogale and Pteronura) form a clade (node 7) that is sister to a clade comprising mink and true weasels (Mustela and Neovison;
node 16). These clades, in turn, are sister to a clade that
includes weasel-like species with aposematically colored

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/10

pelage (Galictis, Ictonyx, Poecilogale and Vormela; node 27).
Next, ferret-badgers (Melogale) are a monotypic lineage
(node 32) that is sister to these three combined clades.
The fifth major clade (node 33) comprises two subclades,
one containing hog-nosed and Eurasian badgers (Arctonyx
and Meles) and the other containing tayra, wolverine and
martens (Eira, Gulo and Martes). Finally, as the earliest
divergences in the tree, the American badger (Taxidea) and
honey badger (Mellivora) form successive monotypic lineages sister to all other mustelid genera. Intergeneric relationships observed are largely congruent with those
recovered in recent analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear
DNA sequences [10,11,13-17]. In contrast, our topology
is highly incongruent with a cladistic analysis based on
morphology [8]. For example, Bryant et al [8] found that
Melogale was reconstructed as sister to all remaining mustelids and that Eira, Gulo and Martes were polyphyletic.
Except for the monophyly of otters, skunks (including
Mydaus), and Arctonyx and Meles, all other nodes in the
Bryant et al [8] tree had low bootstrap support values
(<50%). Furthermore, alternative topologies were recovered in the Bryant et al study when certain characters were
weighted differentially.
Regarding relationships within the four major clades,
otters are resolved into three primary lineages, whose relationships are congruent with previous analyses based on
fewer DNA sequence data [12,13]: one containing Old
World river otters and the sea otter (Aonyx, Lutrogale, Lutra,
Enhydra and Hydrictis; node 9), a second containing New
World river otters (Lontra; node 14) and a third containing
the monotypic giant otter (Pteronura). Relationships of
Enhydra and Hydrictis were unresolved in the Bayesian
consensus tree (Figure 1), but were resolved differently in
MP and ML analyses. With MP, Enhydra and Hydrictis were
resolved as sister taxa, whereas with ML, they were
resolved as successive sister lineages to remaining Old
World otters, with Hydrictis forming the first basal split.
However, neither of these relationships was well supported (<50% MP and ML bootstrap). Two clades comprise the true weasel and mink clade (Mustela and
Neovison), with the New World American mink (N. vison)
and long-tailed weasel (M. frenata) in one clade (node 21)
and all other sampled Mustela species in the second clade
(node 17). Within the latter clade, M. nudipes and M. strigidorsa are sister to a clade comprising species largely distributed in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.
Despite the similar ecology, American mink (N. vison) and
European mink (M. lutreola) are distantly related, as
found in previous studies [14,33,34]. Species of true weasels and mink have been divided into five [34] or nine
subgenera [35] based on morphological criteria. Given
the taxa we have sampled, our phylogeny suggests that
only one proposed subgenus constitutes a natural group,
Putorius, containing the steppe polecat (M. eversmanni),

European polecat (M. putorius) and the North American
black-footed ferret (M. nigripes; node 25). Further, Mustela
is paraphyletic with respect to Neovison and suggests that
the placement of the American mink in the separate genus
Neovison may not be warranted despite the observed differences in karyotype and morphology between this taxon
and other species of Mustela[35]. In the third major clade,
grisons of Central and South America (Galictis; node 31)
are sister to a clade containing the marbled polecat
(Vormela) of Asia and three African species, the Libyan
striped weasel (Ictonyx libyca), zorilla (I. striatus) and
striped weasel (Poecilogale albinucha; node 28). Monophyly of these genera is of interest because all exhibit an
aposematically colored pelage combined with defense
behaviors that include threat displays and excretion of
pungent musk from enlarged anal glands [36-39]. Placement of Vormela within this clade is congruent with a
recent CYTb study [40]. Interestingly, there is a north to
south progression in branching order from Vormela to I.
striatus and P. albinucha of sub-Saharan Africa, which
renders Ictonyx paraphyletic. This suggests that P. albinucha should be placed into the genus Ictonyx Kaup, 1835,
given the priority of the latter name over Poecilogale Thomas, 1883. As for the clade containing Eira, Gulo and
Martes (node 34), the last genus is clearly paraphyletic, in
agreement with other recent studies [11,13,41,42]. Two
New World species, the tayra (Eira) and fisher (Martes pennanti, subgenus Pekania) either comprise a clade or form
successive lineages sister to a clade containing wolverine
(Gulo) and the remaining species of Martes. Our phylogeny indicates that true martens (subgenus Martes) are
monophyletic (node 38) and sister to yellow-throated
marten (M. flavigula, subgenus Charronia). Within the
subgenus Martes, MP and ML analyses resulted in different
phylogenetic placements of M. americana and M. melampus relative to the (M. martes + M. zibellina) clade. In the
MP tree, M. americana was sister to the clade (M. melampus
(M. martes + M. zibellina)) whereas M. americana and M.
melampus were joined as sister taxa in the ML tree. Relationships of M. americana, M. melampus and (M. martes +
M. zibellina) were unresolved in the Bayesian tree, resulting in a trichotomy (Figure 1; node 39). Although more
data is required to establish the precise branching order of
the fisher, the strong support for this taxon being paraphyletic with the remaining species of Martes strongly suggests placement of the fisher in its own genus, Pekania.
Nodal support
Concatenation of 11,929 bp, with indels coded as missing, includes 2,959 (24.8%) variable characters and 1,876
(15.7%) parsimony-informative characters. When indels
are coded for information content, the concatenation is
reduced to 11,789 bp, with 3,045 (25.8%) variable and
1,917 (16.3%) parsimony-informative characters. The
majority of internodes in our phylogeny have >90% boot-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/10

strap support (ML and MP) and 1.0 posterior probabilities
(BI), see Figure 1 and Table 1, indicating that our phylogenetic hypothesis, given our data set, is robustly supported. Moreover, 14 internodes are supported by one or
more synapomorphic indels (Table 1). Three clades, however, have low support in MP, ML and/or BI analyses:
nodes 26, 33 and 35. Internodes associated with these
clades have very short branch lengths (Figure 1), suggesting that these splits occurred rapidly. Alternatively, speciation may have occurred relatively recently, also resulting
in inadequate phylogenetic signal, as among M. eversmanni, M. putorius and M. nigripes (node 26) as well as M.
americana, M. melampus and (M. martes + M. zibellina).
Many nuclear segments show no differences among species that comprise these groups, suggesting that there has
been insufficient time for sequence differences to accumulate at these more slowly evolving loci. Indeed, the four
species of Martes have been described as a superspecies
complex of closely related, yet largely allopatrically distributed taxa [43]. Regardless of the exact cause, short
branch lengths of these internodes can result in a high
number of anomalous gene trees (and gene tree discordance [44]), leading to an incorrectly inferred species tree,
especially when data from multiple data partitions is concatenated [45]. Additional analyses, including population
genetic-level sampling, will be needed to confidently
resolve relationships among these recently evolved species, as in reference [33] for example.
Even so, internodes with low support may be stable or
unstable, depending on the relative stability or instability
of their constituent (terminal) taxa or leaves [46]. Further,
unstable taxa can influence nodal support in other parts of
a phylogenetic tree [47]. We measured leaf stability of all
taxa using bootstrap trees from MP analyses and the program RadCon [48]. For three different measures of leaf
stability, Arctonyx collaris and Meles meles were the least
stable taxa (see Additional file 1). We repeated MP and
hill-climbing ML analyses (see the methods section)
along with bootstrapping after excluding these two taxa,
thereby reducing the data set to 44 taxa. Most bootstrap
values in these analyses showed little or no change compared with the 46 taxa data set, but interestingly, support
for two stem clades (nodes 3 and 4) increased from over
70% to more than 90%, as did average phylogenetic stability (Table 1). The lower stability of A. collaris and M.
meles and their influence on bootstrap support at internodes 3, 4 and 33 may be caused by character conflict
among different gene segments associated with these two
taxa [49]. However, we note that these nodes all have high
or maximal posterior probabilities in BI analyses (Table
1).
With regards to subfamilial classification, our phylogeny
clearly indicates that the Mustelinae, as both traditionally

[5] and recently [7] conceived, is polyphyletic, as suggested by previous studies [8,13,14]. Our results also indicate that various genera of badgers (Arctonyx, Meles,
Mellivora, Melogale and Taxidea), most of which are often
placed in the Melinae [5], are also polyphyletic, supporting earlier conclusions based on morphology that these
taxa are not closely related [8,50,51]. Instead, badgers
with specific adaptations for fossoriality (Arctonyx, Meles,
Mellivora and Taxidea) constitute a basal grade of lineages

that are best recognized as distinct subfamilies. Overall,
our phylogeny (Figure 1) is consistent with the subfamilial classification scheme recently proposed by Sato et al
[15] and Fulton and Strobeck [11], which redefines the
boundaries of traditional subfamilies (e.g. Mustelinae) as
well as resurrects other subfamilies such as Helictidinae
and Mellivorinae, thereby reflecting actual phyletic lines
that have been difficult to resolve based on morphology
alone.

Divergence times
Divergence times across the mustelid phylogeny were estimated using the uncorrelated relaxed lognormal molecular clock model calibrated simultaneously by eight fossil
constraints. Use of this molecular clock model provides a
measure of rate heterogeneity among lineages or how well
data conform or deviate from a strict molecular clock [52].
For the root age and crown age prior combination of 28.5
MYA and 24 MYA, the coefficient of variation (σr) averaged across three independent runs was 0.375 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 0.274–0.486), which
suggests that the data show rate heterogeneity among lineages (i.e. the concatenated data are evolving in a nonclocklike manner). We found greater rate heterogeneity
among lineages when older root age and crown age prior
combinations were used; for example, for 33.7 MYA and
28.5 MYA, averaged across three runs, σr = 0.504 (95%
HPD: 0.381–0.631). Furthermore, a likelihood ratio test
significantly rejects the ML phylogeny with an enforced
molecular clock versus one without a molecular clock (-ln
Lwith clock = 55179.13 and -ln Lwithout clock = 55095.88; p <
0.001) thereby providing additional support that our data
departs from clocklike behavior.

In general, mean posterior estimates as well as 95% HPD
intervals of node ages were highly consistent among different combinations of root age and crown age prior combinations (Table 2). The root and node 1 (the divergence
between Taxidea and remaining mustelids) were most
sensitive to alterations in priors, because they showed the
largest shift in divergence times (~5 million years) and little overlap in 95% HPD intervals in runs using older versus younger combinations of root age/crown age priors
(Table 2). Nonetheless, sampling of the joint prior distribution by performing Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analyses without any data (using BEAST v1.4.2
[52]) suggested that the eight fossil calibration point priors (as well as the various root age and crown age combinations) did not have a strong influence on their
estimated posterior distributions (see Additional file 2)
and thus, estimated divergence times.
How do our estimates of divergence times compare with
those based on previous molecular studies of mustelids
[12,14,17,41]? At nodes shared among the different studies, divergence times in previous studies are either a mix
of younger, older and overlapping dates relative to those
in our study [17] or they tend to be older in general
[12,14,41]. For example, the estimated divergence time
for the split between Neovison vison and the remaining taxa
of Mustela was dated at 8.5–9.9 MYA, 6.6–9.5 MYA and
10–14 MYA in Sato et al [14], Marmi et al [17] and
Hosoda et al [41], respectively. In our study, this split
(node 16; Figure 2 and Table 2), which also includes M.
frenata as sister to N. vison, is dated at ~6.0 MYA (95%

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/10

HPD: 4.6–7.3 MYA). However, earlier studies differ in several important respects from our study. First, these studies
were based on a smaller number of taxa and loci. For
example, in Sato et al [14] and Hosoda et al [41], taxon
sampling largely consisted of species from Martes and
Mustela and was based on one and two loci, respectively.
Undersampling of taxa and characters can bias divergence
time estimates [53-55] and reduces the power to detect
rate variation among lineages [56]. Second, previous studies all employed a single root age fossil constraint, treated
as a hard bound, precluding an accurate estimation of
error associated with this calibration point. In contrast, we
employed multiple fossil constraints simultaneously and
placed soft-bound priors on these constraints to account
for the uncertainty associated with the fossil record,
thereby making it possible to evaluate errors associated
with divergence time estimates [57,58]. Third, the previous studies each estimated a substitution rate that was
assumed to be constant across their respective phylogenies. However, our results indicate that substitution rates
vary across different lineages of the mustelid phylogeny
(see above), consistent with recent evidence from different groups that rates of substitution vary across lineages,
even among closely related species [59].
Tempo and mode of mustelid diversification
Using the root age and crown age prior combination of
28.5 MYA and 24 MYA as a reference, our dating analyses
indicate that, following the initial divergence of Taxidea in
the Early Miocene (21.0 MYA, 95% HPD: 19.0–23.1
MYA), mustelids underwent two main bursts of diversification (Figure 2). The first burst occurred during a ~3.7
million year interval from the Middle to Late Miocene
(12.5-8.8 MYA, 95% HPD: 13.9-7.5 MYA) and gave rise to
most of the extant primary clades and lineages (nodes 2–6
and 33). The second and larger burst occurred during the
Pliocene epoch (5.3-1.8 MYA) in which as many as 20
generic-level or specific-level lineages originated within a
3.5 million year span of time (Figure 2 and Table 2). Furthermore, results of our biogeographic analyses show that
the majority of cladogenetic events associated with these
bursts of diversification occurred in the Old World, largely
in Eurasia (Figures 3 and 4; see below).

Paleoenvironmental and biotic changes driven by changes
in climate during the latter half of the Neogene may have
promoted the two bursts of cladogenesis within mustelids. Following the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum and
onset of modern oceanic circulation (17-15 MYA), there is
a marked cooling of the global climate near the end of the
Middle Miocene that continues through to the Holocene
[60]. This period of cooling coincides with formation of a
permanent Antarctic ice sheet in the Mid to Late Miocene
and an Arctic ice sheet in the Pliocene [60]. In addition,
several major sea-level lowstands occurred during the Late

Miocene and Pliocene, including the Serravallian sea-lowering event near the beginning of the Late Miocene, 11-10
MYA [61,62]. These changes in climate and sea level
increased overall terrestrial aridity and seasonality, which
in turn promoted a shift from closed vegetation habitats
(tropical and subtropical forests) to more open vegetation
habitats (woodlands and grasslands) [63-65]. By the early
Late Miocene, plant and animal fossil evidence indicates

that the Eurasian continent was a mosaic of vegetation
types and generally more heterogeneous in vegetation
structure relative to that in the Early to Middle Miocene
[66]. These changes in vegetation had a concomitant
impact on faunal communities and may have fostered
diversification in a variety of lineages, including mustelids, via geographic isolation, divergent selection among
different habitats, and/or ecological opportunity through

Nodes are numbered as in Figure 1 and posterior estimates of mean and 95% HPD of divergence times are presented in Table

the creation of new niches or the reorganization of former
niches. Interestingly, the initial radiation of the primary
clades and lineages of mustelids coincides with a major
faunal turnover in Western Europe (the middle Vallesian
'crisis') that affected many groups of mammals, including
the Carnivora [62,67]. In fact, nearly half of carnivoran
species that went extinct during this turnover were mustelids [68] and turnover in mustelids remained high
throughout the Late Miocene in western Eurasia [69].
Although evidence for faunal change in other parts of Eurasia is less clear, changes in habitat and extinction of earlier lineages of mustelids may have created ecological
opportunities that fostered the initial burst of diversification of modern mustelids.

Further cooling and drying during the Pliocene, coincident with onset of high latitude glacial cycles [60], caused
a dramatic expansion of low-biomass vegetation, including grasslands and steppe at midlatitudes and development of taiga at high latitudes of Eurasia and North
America [63-65]. Coupled with these changes was diversification of prey species such as rodents (particularly
muroid rodents) and passerine birds that exploited these
new habitats, which in turn provided new niches for predators [68,70]. Part of the Pliocene burst of diversification
of mustelids may have been promoted by this diversification of prey species, as species in genera such Martes
(nodes 37–39 in Figure 2) and especially Mustela (nodes
17–23 in Figure 2) became specialized in hunting small

prey such as rodents. Such a scenario is consistent with
King's [71] hypothesis that evolution of small body size in
Mustela was partly driven by adaptation to exploit abundant resources presented by rodent diversification during
the Pliocene. We also note that diversification of four of
the five species within the subgenus Martes (M. americana,
M. martes, M. melampus and M. zibellina; node 39), which
are all closely associated with taiga forest habitat [72],
coincides with expansion of this type of habitat across the
Holarctic during the Plio-Pleistocene [63]. This finding is
consistent with fossil evidence that indicates that taxa
ancestral to these living species primarily evolved in forested habitats [43,73]. In Africa, the split between Ictonyx
libyca and the clade containing I. striatus and Poecilogale
albinucha (node 29) dated at 3.0–3.5 MYA (95% HPD:
1.8–4.6 MYA), marginally overlaps with a major increase
in African aridity and climate variability that occurred 2.92.4 MYA, according to paleoclimatic and faunal evidence
[74,75]. Moreover, this interval was accompanied by
rapid radiation in several mammalian lineages such as
bovids and hominids [74,75]. Our results suggest that
divergence of I. libyca, which occurs in North Africa along
margins of the Sahara desert, and the clade containing I.
striatus and P. albinucha, which both occur south of the
Sahara, may have also been caused by this shift to greater
aridity, especially considering that extensive desert conditions in the Sahara did not occur until the Late Pliocene,
around 2.8 MYA [74,76,77].
If mustelid diversification was promoted by climatically
driven paleoenvironmental changes, then synchronous
patterns and tempos of diversification should also be
recorded in the evolutionary histories of other, unrelated
groups. A number of recent molecular phylogenetic studies on various groups of mammals and other vertebrates
employing multiple loci and relaxed molecular clock
methods provide corroboration for this hypothesis. For
example, squirrels (Sciuridae [32]), cats (Felidae [78]),
rabbits and hares (Leporidae [79]), deer (Cervidae [80])
and woodpeckers (Picinae [81]) each show one or more
episodes of rapid diversification that are roughly contemporaneous with one or both of those observed in mustelids (Figure 5). Taking cats as an example, seven of the
eight primary lineages of felids radiated in the early part
of the Late Miocene (10.8-6.2 MYA) whereas genera and
species that comprise the eight lineages largely radiated
during the Pliocene [78]. We also note that divergence
events from a number of independent lineages within the
Mustelidae are synchronous as well. For example, using
the root age and crown age prior combination of 28.5
MYA and 24 MYA as reference, nodes 11, 14, 19, 22, 31
and 38 all codiversify around 2.8 MYA (Figure 2 and Table
2). Similarly, nodes 9, 28 and 37 overlap in their divergence time estimates of around 4.8 MYA (Table 2). While
ecological circumstances obviously differ from group to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/10

group, such congruence in patterns and tempos of diversification supports the idea that a common cause, namely,
large-scale changes in past environments, has shaped the
phylogenetic histories among disparate groups of organisms as well as independent lineages of mustelids.
Our results have important implications for theories
about the mode and tempo of adaptive radiations. First,
the scenario of diversification across different trophic
groups we have outlined above is consistent with the
model of cascading radiation proposed by Stanley [82], in
which diversification of one group in a trophic cascade
(e.g. producers such as grasses and taiga) promotes diversification in a second group (e.g. primary consumers such
as rodents), which in turn promotes diversification in a
third group (secondary consumers such as mustelids).
This model could be tested more rigorously using dated
phylogenies of multiple groups representing different
trophic levels. Second, our finding that the two primary
bursts of cladogenesis in the evolutionary history of extant
mustelids (and perhaps in the other groups cited above)
coincided with periods of climatically mediated environmental changes provides support for models that show
that evolution may be greatly accelerated in temporally
and spatially changing environments [83]. During these
times, new niches are created or former niches are reorganized, providing new ecological opportunities that may
foster rapid speciation and thus, diversification [2,84] (see
also [85]). The fact that multiple groups show contemporaneous periods of rapid cladogenesis (e.g. mustelids,
felids and leporids during the Pliocene) suggests that
mainland environments undergoing environmental
changes may function like newly colonized island archipelagoes in promoting diversification.
Historical biogeography
The two-state and four-state biogeographical reconstructions indicate that the vast majority of the modern diversification of mustelids has occurred in the Old World
(Figure 3), specifically in Eurasia (Figure 4). In fact, Eurasia was unambiguously reconstructed as the ancestral area
for nearly every ancestral node in the four-state analysis
(Figure 4). These results are consistent with two other
observations that suggest Eurasia has been the center of
mustelid diversification: (1) Eurasia contains the majority
of extant species, with 34 of the 59 known species either
exclusively endemic to or having part of their distribution
on this continent; and (2) the earliest fossils of extant lineages or those associated with the ancestors of extant lineages are often found in Eurasia [23]. Nodes located near
the base of the tree tend to be those where likelihood
ratios are not significant (and, thus, ancestral reconstruction is inferred as equivocal), such as the root node and
the node joining Taxidea as sister to the remaining taxa of
mustelids in the two-state analysis (see Figure 3 and Addi-

more open vegetation habitats such as woodlands and grasslands (B). Taiga forests greatly expand during the Pliocene (C). See

tional file 3). Such results are not uncommon in likelihood or other model-based approaches to ancestral state
reconstruction because the degree of uncertainty associated with reconstruction increases with time [86]. Nonetheless, proportional likelihood values for these nodes
still favor the Old World as the ancestral area in the twostate analysis (see Figure 3 and Additional file 3). Ancestral reconstructions were robust when Enhydra lutris, Gulo
gulo and Mellivora capensis were coded for alternative states
(results not shown; see methods).
In contrast to the extensive in situ diversification that has
taken place in Eurasia, mustelid faunas of Africa and the
New World are largely comprised of genera or species that
repeatedly colonized these regions from Eurasia. The mustelid fauna of Africa contains eight species, seven of which
are included in our taxon sampling (the Egyptian weasel,
Mustela subpalmata, was not sampled). Of these seven species, five are derived from separate colonizations from
Eurasia (Aonyx capensis, Hydrictis maculicollis, Mustela putorius, the Ictonyx + Poecilogale lineage and Mellivora capensis)
whereas two are derived from in situ speciation events
(Ictonyx striatus and P. albinucha); see Figure 4. Similarly,
our reconstructions show that nine separate dispersal
events from Eurasia and only one in situ speciation event
accounts for the diversity of mustelids that are either
endemic to North America (e.g. Lontra canadensis, M.
nigripes, Martes pennanti) or have part of their distribution
there (e.g. Holarctic species such as Gulo gulo, Mustela
erminea and M. nivalis). Genera and species of mustelids
found in South America today are largely descended from
North American immigrants that arrived as part of the
Great American Interchange following the rise of the Panamanian isthmus, 3.0-2.5 MYA [23,87,88]. Such a relationship is clearly indicated for the clade of New World
otters in which L. canadensis is sister to L. felina + L. longicaudis, with the latter two species found in Central and/or
South America (Figure 4). Moreover, this split (node 14)
is estimated to have occurred 2.8–3.4 MYA (95% HPD:
1.6–5.2 MYA), which overlaps well with timing of the formation of the Panamanian land bridge. The long-tailed
weasel, M. frenata, ranges from North America to northern
South America [89] and two species of weasels (M. africana and M. felipei, not sampled here) are endemic to
South America. Fossil evidence clearly indicates that Mustela colonized South America from the north, apparently
well after the Panamanian isthmus was in place [23,90].
Our results show that Pteronura, Galictis and Eira dispersed
separately into South America, with Eurasia reconstructed
as the continent of origin for each genus (Figure 4). These
results are anomalous because these genera have been
allied with extinct taxa from North America, suggesting a
more proximate origin for these lineages [91,92]. For
example, Pteronura may be related to the extinct genus
Satherium from the Pliocene of North America [91]. How-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/10

ever, paleontological studies suggest that the ultimate
ancestry of these extinct taxa lies in Eurasia [92,93].
A combination of evidence from the fossil record and
divergence times from our phylogeny indicates that the
mustelid faunas of Africa, North America and South
America have been assembled gradually over time. For
example, fossil evidence suggests mustelids colonized the
New World across Beringia during different intervals
when the land bridge between Eurasia and North America
was open. Multiple genera of mustelids entered North
America during the Late Miocene (~11.2-5.3 MYA
[19,23]), prior to the first opening of the Bering Strait
5.4–5.5 MYA, which severed the route across Beringia
[94,95]. Many genera that colonized North America during the Late Miocene or earliest Pliocene became extinct
[19,20]. Nonetheless, among the genera that may have
been included in this wave of dispersal were the earliest
representatives of Lutra (which may represent Lontra,
given that New World river otters have been reclassified
into Lontra) and Mustela, both of which are first recorded
in North America from the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene
(~5.9-4.6 MYA [19]). These taxa may have been the forerunners of modern species of Lontra and Mustela/Neovison
found in North and South America today. The Late
Miocene divergence time of the splits leading to Lontra
and Neovison + M. frenata (nodes 8 and 16 in Figure 2) are
consistent with this possibility. Two extinct genera of
American badgers, Chamitataxus and Pliotaxidea, are
recorded from the Late Miocene, around 7.3 MYA and 6.5
MYA, respectively [96,97]. Pliotaxidea has been shown to
be sister group to Taxidea based on morphological evidence [98], thereby suggesting that the lineage leading to
Taxidea arrived in North America before the opening of
the Bering Strait. Meline badgers (Arctonyx and Meles) are
presently found only in the Old World. However, recent
discovery of Late Miocene to Early Pliocene fossils of
meline badgers at two different sites in North America
[99,100] indicates that this lineage had also immigrated
into North America and was a component of the New
World mustelid fauna.
Following these earlier dispersal events, fossil evidence
indicates that Mustela erminea, M. nigripes, M. nivalis and
Martes americana later entered North America during the
Pleistocene [26,102]. The molecular divergence time for
M. nigripes (node 25), around 0.6 MYA (95% HPD:
0.3–1.1 MYA; Table 2), for example, supports a Pleistocene dispersal scenario for this species. Although fossil
records of mustelids in Africa and South America are less
well known than those of the northern continents, first
appearance datums of both extant and extinct genera of
mustelids nevertheless suggest that these regions also were
colonized through successive dispersal events [23,102105]. Among the extinct genera known from Late Miocene

BMC Biology 2008, 6:10

deposits in East Africa that may have arisen from Eurasian
immigrants are the gigantic and cat-like Ekorus, the largest
mustelid discovered thus far, and an otter, Vishnuonyx
[105]. In contrast, the earliest known remains of Ictonyx
striatus are from the Pleistocene [106], suggesting a later
immigration into Africa.
Implications for mustelid community ecology
Most studies of modern-day mustelid communities
(where multiple species coexist in a single area of a geographic region) have focused on recent ecological factors,
such as partitioning of resources (food or space) via competition, to explain coexistence of species within these
communities [29,107-109]. As these studies have operated on an ecological timeframe, they implicitly assume
that ecological differences among species have evolved
relatively recently. However, several observations derived
from our biogeographical and phylogenetic results suggest that history (via phylogeny) also has been an important component in the structure of mustelid assemblages
on different continents.

First, these assemblages are largely composed of species
belonging to different clades or lineages that differ significantly in their ecomorphology with regards to diet and
locomotor mode [110,111]. For example, seven species of
mustelids are sympatric on the British Isles in Eurasia,
with three species of weasels, (Mustela) and one species
each of mink (Neovison, introduced), marten (Martes),
badger (Meles) and otter (Lutra) [29]. Weasels, martens,
badgers and otters obviously comprise a phylogenetically
and ecologically heterogeneous set of species, yet these
fundamental differences may indeed facilitate coexistence
of these species within this community. Even the three
species of weasels found in this community (M. erminea,
M. nivalis and M. putorius) are not closely related (Figure
1), suggesting that resource partitioning among these species may also be in part determined by historical causes.
Second, studies of other vertebrate communities (e.g. lizards) have demonstrated that competition and divergence
in ecological traits varies according to the degree of phylogenetic relatedness among species, such that, for example, competition is expected to be low among distantly
related species but high among closely related species
[112,113]. Divergence in ecological traits should therefore be greatest between closely related species, especially
sister species occupying the same area. Within mustelids,
there are several instances where sister taxa that are
broadly sympatric within a region often exhibit pronounced ecological differences. In Africa, Poecilogale albinucha preys almost exclusively on rodents whereas Ictonyx
striatus has a more generalized diet that includes invertebrate prey [36,37]. Similarly, Mustela frenata and Neovison
vison overlap extensively in North America, but differ sig-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/10

nificantly in several aspects of their ecologies [89,114].
The sister taxa Aonyx cinerea and Lutrogale perspicillata cooccur in parts of south and southeast Eurasia with the
former species feeding largely on freshwater crabs and the
latter feeding mostly on fish [115,116].
Third, the fossil record along with molecular dating
results indicate that continental assemblages of mustelids
have been built up gradually over time (see the above discussion). This suggests that species interactions with these
communities are temporally mosaic, with some interactions being ancient while others are more recent. We certainly do not suggest that present-day ecological factors
(e.g. interspecific competition for food and/or space, predation) operating over ecological time scales have not
been important in determining the structure of modernday mustelid communities. Instead, we simply suggest
that historical factors should also be considered and that
such a perspective has been lacking in most previous studies of mustelid community ecology. As other researchers
have pointed out, both historical factors and more recent
ecological processes contribute to the structure of modern
day communities [113,117].

Conclusion
We have reconstructed a nearly complete generic-level
phylogeny of the Mustelidae based on a supermatrix of 22
gene segments. Using a variety of phylogenetic reconstruction methods, we have shown that mustelids are consistently resolved into four primary clades and three
monotypic lineages and that nearly all nodes for this
topology are well supported. Furthermore, by applying
Bayesian dating techniques we have shown two bursts of
diversification, first during the Miocene, which gave rise
to the primary extant clades and lineages, and another
during the Pliocene, which gave rise to a large proportion
of the species diversity observed today. These bursts of
diversification coincided with major paleoenvironmental
and biotic changes that occurred during the Neogene and
are broadly contemporaneous with periods of rapid
cladogenesis in other vertebrate groups. Such concordance in pattern and tempo of diversification suggests that
global-scale changes have shaped the histories of many
diverse groups of taxa [32]. We used ancestral reconstruction of biogeographic areas to show that most of the
extant diversity of mustelids originated in Eurasia. Further, the mustelid fauna of Africa, North America and
South America are composed of taxa from nearly all major
clades and lineages, suggesting that in situ speciation has
been a relatively minor component in the assembly of
these faunas. Finally, divergence times estimated from the
molecular data combined with the fossil record suggests
that different lineages of mustelids dispersed to Africa,
North America and South America in successive waves,

which has implications for understanding the structure of
mustelid communities.

Methods
Taxon sampling
We obtained tissue samples from mustelid taxa representing 21 of 22 putative genera and 43 of 58 extant putative
species, following the classification of Wozencraft [7];
(see Additional file 4). Samples were unavailable from
Lyncodon patagonicus, seven species of Mustela, two species
of Meles, two species of Melogale and one species each of
Lontra, Lutra and Martes. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that Procyonidae is the sister group of Mustelidae
[10,16]. Therefore, two species of Procyonidae, Procyon
lotor and Bassariscus astutus, were used as outgroups to root
the mustelid tree.
Sequence data collection
Total genomic DNA was extracted from hair or tissue samples using phenol chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation [118] or using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Twenty-one nuclear gene segments were amplified using published primers (see Additional file 5) and the complete mitochondrial cytochrome
b (CYTb) gene was amplified with primers as described in
Koepfli and Wayne [13]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was carried out in MWG-Biotech Primus 96 Plus thermal
cyclers with the following conditions: 28–30 cycles of
94°C for 30 s; 50–56°C for 30 s; 72°C for 45 s; and one
cycle of 72°C for 5 min. Each 50 μl reaction contained
35.7 μl sterile double-distilled water, 5 μl 10× PCR buffer,
5 μl of 25 mM MgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mix, 1 μl of
both 25 pM/μl forward and reverse primers, 0.3 μl Taq
polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and 1 μl of
0.1–1 μg genomic DNA. All PCRs included a negative control (no DNA). PCR products were electrophoresed in and
excised from 1% agarose/Tris-acetic acid-EDTA gels and
purified using an Ultra Clean Kit (MoBio Laboratories,
Solana Beach, CA). PCR products were then cycle
sequenced using the original amplification primers and
either the CEQ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Quick
Start Kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) or BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Sequencing reactions were run through
either a CEQ 2000 XL DNA Analysis System or an Applied
Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyzer. Sequence chromatograms were checked for accuracy and edited using
Sequencher 3.1 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor,
MI).

For several species, DNA extracts from hair samples did
not yield a sufficient amount of DNA for direct amplification of nuclear gene segments. We therefore first wholegenome amplified these samples using the GenomiPhi V2
DNA Amplification Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Little

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/10

Chalfont, UK) and then proceeded with regular PCR protocols (as above). To ensure that the whole-genome
amplification process had not introduced any errors into
our target sequences, we amplified the whole genome
from the same sample a second time and then amplified
and sequenced several nuclear loci to compare sequences
from the two samples (all were identical).
Mustela altaica was represented by only three of the 22
gene segments: CYTb, RAG1 and APOB (exon 26).
Sequences for these segments were downloaded from
Genbank and were from studies by Sato et al [15,16] and
Kurose et al [33], thereby increasing the ingroup to 44
taxa. RAG1 sequences for Gulo gulo, Martes flavigula, M.
foina, M. martes, M. zibellina, Melogale moschata, Mustela
altaica and M. erminea were downloaded from Genbank
from the study by Sato et al [15]. All new sequences were
deposited in Genbank and accession numbers for all
sequences are presented in Additional file 6.
We were unable to obtain sequences for one or more gene
segments from nine of the 46 species sampled. Species
and the segments they are missing are: Galictis cuja
(BRCA1 [fragment 2]); Ictonyx libyca (ATP7A); Martes zibellina (PLCB4); Mellivora capensis (ADORA3); Melogale personata (APOB [exon 29], BRCA1 [fragment 1], BRCA1
[fragment 2], CHRNA1, FES, GHR, GLB1, GNAT1, INHBA,
RHO1, TMEM20, WT1); Mustela nudipes (BRCA1 [fragment 2], COL10A1, FES, INHBA, TMEM20); M. strigidorsa
(BRCA1 [fragment 2], COL10A1, TMEM20); Procyon lotor
(TMEM20); Vormela peregusna (COL10A1, FES, GLB1).
Question marks were used to represent missing
sequences. Despite the amount of missing data for species
such as Melogale personata and Mustela altaica, studies have
shown that phylogenetic information content of included
data for a taxon is more important in achieving phylogenetic accuracy than the amount of missing data per se,
especially in the context of a supermatrix analysis
[119,120].
Phylogeny estimation
Gene segments were concatenated into a supermatrix of
11,929 bp, including insertions and deletions (indels).
Phylogenetic trees were estimated using MP, ML and BI.
Indels were coded as missing for BI and ML analyses
(11,929 bp) but were recoded as present or absent (1 or
0), regardless of length, to utilize their potential phylogenetic signal for MP analyses (11,789 bp) [121]. PAUP*
4.0b10 [122] was used to reconstruct MP trees. Characters
were equally weighted in heuristic searches using 1,000
random stepwise additions, with one tree held at each
step during stepwise addition, tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping, steepest descent option not in
effect, no upper bound for MaxTrees and MulTrees option
in effect. Clade support was evaluated by bootstrapping,

Page 16 of 22

BMC Biology 2008, 6:10

using 3,000 pseudoreplicates and the same heuristic
search conditions as described above except only 100 random stepwise additions were used.
The GTR+I+G model was selected as the best-fitting model
of DNA substitution for the 11,929 bp data set, using the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) as implemented in
Modeltest v3.7 [123]. Under this model, ML heuristic
searches were conducted using a hill-climbing algorithm
and a genetic algorithm as implemented in the programs
TREEFINDER [124] and GARLI [125,126], respectively.
For GARLI, we used a random starting tree and default settings for the components of the genetic algorithm. Identical topologies and similar log-likelihood scores were
obtained for three separate runs with each program. For
both methods of ML analysis, 1,000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates were used to assess the support for the ML topology.
We used MrBayes v3.1.2 [127] for Metropolis-coupled
MCMC BI of phylogeny. We performed MCMC runs
under the GTR+I+G model of DNA substitution, selected
by MrModelTest v2.2 [128] using the AIC. MCMC analyses were performed in which model parameters were
linked (uniform model) or unlinked (partitioned model)
among the 22 gene segments of the concatenated data set.
Two simultaneous independent runs of one cold and
three heated MCMC chains and each starting with a different random tree were conducted for 5 × 106 generations,
sampling trees every 500 generations. To ensure consistency of results, we ran analyses for both models a second
time (four independent runs for both uniform and partitioned models). The following set of priors were used in
all analyses: Dirichlet priors for six substitution rates of
the GTR model (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1); a Dirichlet prior for base
frequencies (1, 1, 1, 1); a uniform prior for the proportion
of invariant sites (0, 1); a uniform distribution prior for
the shape parameter of the gamma distribution of rate
heterogeneity among sites (0, 200); all topologies equally
probable; and unconstrained branch lengths with an
exponential probability density. Potential scale reduction
factors (PSRFs) of 1.00 and an average standard deviation
of split frequencies for both simultaneous runs of less
than 0.01 indicated that runs had converged on a stationary distribution. In addition, using Tracer 1.3 [129], tracer
plots and effective sample size values over 200 for estimates of the posterior distribution of tree likelihood and
model parameters also indicated that convergence had
been reached and that MCMC chains had mixed well. For
each independent run, the first 3,000 trees were discarded
as burn-in, leaving 14,002 trees used to construct a 50%
majority-rule consensus tree. Internodes with posterior
probability values of ≥0.95 were considered well supported.

Ancestral state reconstruction of biogeography
We reconstructed ancestral areas of mustelids using the
likelihood reconstruction method [86,130] implemented
in Mesquite v1.12 [131]. Taxa were coded into one of two
categorical characters, 0 = Old World (Africa, Eurasia) or
1 = New World (North America, South America) or one of
four categorical characters, 0 = Eurasia, 1 = North America,
2 = Africa or 3 = South America. Three taxa have Holarctic
distributions, Gulo gulo, Mustela erminea and M. nivalis,
while a fourth taxon, Enhydra lutris, is distributed along
coastal waters of the eastern and northern Pacific Ocean.
As these four taxa have distributions that span both Old
and New Worlds (two state) or Eurasia and North America
(four state), they would be coded as polymorphic (0, 1).
However, polymorphic characters cannot be used with the
likelihood reconstruction method of Mesquite, so we
used fossil evidence to assign the four taxa to one of the
categorical characters. Mustela erminea and M. nivalis were
coded as 0 = Old World or Eurasia since the earliest fossil
remains of these taxa are found in Eurasia [132,133]. The
earliest fossil evidence for the wolverine, G. gulo, is found
in North America, although Eurasian fossils are almost
contemporaneous [134,135]. Gulo, however, is either
related to or descended from Plesiogulo, which originated
in Asia in the Late Miocene [136]. Therefore, we coded
Gulo as 0 = Old World or Eurasia. The earliest fossil
remains for Enhydra are found in Pleistocene deposits of
North America [93,137]. Cladistic analyses suggest that
Enhydra shares ancestry with the extinct Enhydritherium,
which immigrated to North America from Eurasia in the
Late Miocene [138]. Although there is debate about the
exact area of origin of Enhydra within North America
[93,139], the earliest fossils leading to this lineage are of
Old World origin [93] and accordingly, we coded this
taxon as 0 = Old World or Eurasia. In addition, M. frenata
is distributed from North America to South America, with
the earliest fossil remains found in the former region [89].
Consequently, we coded this species 1 = North America in
the four state analyses. Lastly, fossil evidence suggests that
Mellivora capensis originated in Africa, although the species also ranges into Eurasia [103]. Therefore, this species
was coded 3 = Africa in the four state analysis. Taxa whose
exact geographic origins were uncertain (i.e. E. lutris, G.
gulo and M. capensis) were coded by the alternative state in
separate analyses in order to investigate robustness of the
biogeographic reconstructions (e.g. G. gulo was coded 1 =
New World or North America in two-state and four-state
analyses, respectively).

For reconstruction of ancestral areas using likelihood, we
used the Markov k-state one-parameter model (Mk1)
[140], which assumes a single rate of transition between
two character states. The rooted topology and branch
lengths generated from the ML analyses were used to trace
characters. We used the likelihood-ratio test to determine

BMC Biology 2008, 6:10

the best estimate of the reconstructed character state at
each node, setting the likelihood decision threshold at
2.0. If log-likelihoods of two states differed by 2.0 or
more, the state with the lower negative log-likelihood was
accepted as the best estimate [130]. Character state reconstructions were considered ambiguous at nodes where
log-likelihoods differed by less than 2.0.
Estimation of divergence times
We estimated divergence times of splits using the Bayesian
relaxed phylogenetic approach implemented in BEAST
v1.4.2 [52,141]. We assumed a GTR+I+G model of DNA
substitution with four rate categories. Uniform priors
were employed for GTR substitution parameters (0, 100),
gamma shape parameter (0, 100) and proportion of
invariant sites parameter (0, 1). The uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model was used to estimate
substitution rates for all nodes in the tree, with uniform
priors on the mean (0, 100) and standard deviation (0,
10) of this clock model. We employed the Yule process of
speciation as the tree prior and a UPGMA tree to construct
a starting tree, with the ingroup assumed to be monophyletic with respect to the outgroup. Eight fossil calibration points were applied as priors to constrain the age of
the following nodes (as numbered in Figures 1 and 2): (i)
node 1, 24.0 MYA as the minimum age for crown Mustelidae, based on the earliest known mustelid, Plesictis, from
the Late Oligocene of Europe [14,18] (but see [25]); (ii)
node 2, 10.0 MYA as the minimum age for origin of Mellivora, from Late Miocene deposits in South Africa [103];
(iii) node 10, 3.6 MYA as the minimum age for origin of
Lutra, based on fossils of Lutra affinis from the Early
Pliocene of Europe [93]; (iv) node 11, 1.0 MYA as the
minimum age for the origin of Aonyx, based on Pleistocene fossils of this species from Africa [104]; (v) node
16, 5.3 MYA as the minimum age for origin of Mustela
(including Neovison), based on fossils from a number of
different species of Mustela that appear during the Late
Miocene throughout Eurasia [142]; (vi) node 18, 1.8 MYA
as the minimum age for the earliest fossil remains of M.
erminea [132]; (vii) node 28, 1.8 MYA as the minimum
age for origin of Vormela, based on Pleistocene fossil
remains of V. petenyii from Europe [143]; and (viii) node
38, 3.3 MYA as the minimum age for origin of the subgenus Martes, based on fossils of Martes wenzensis from the
Late Pliocene of Europe [73] (see also [14]). We conducted additional dating analyses by using minimum fossil constraints (ii)–(viii), but changed the age of crown
Mustelidae to a maximum of 28.5 MYA, using the first
appearance of the stem taxon Pseudobassaris (considered
the earliest known taxon of the Procyonidae) as the earliest age of the Mustelidae-Procyonidae split [144] (see also
[14]). All fossil constraint priors were set as means of a
normal distribution, with a standard deviation of 1.0
MYA. We set the mean of the normal distribution of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/10

root height prior to 24 MYA (assuming Plesictis as the earliest fossil mustelid), with a standard deviation of 1.0
MYA. To assess the influence of the root height prior on
resulting node ages, we also conducted runs in which age
of the root height prior was increased to 28.5 MYA and
33.7 MYA, representing minimum and maximum ages for
the Early Oligocene. These ages correspond to the approximate times for the Mustelidae-Procyonidae split
[22,144]. Three independent MCMC runs of 10,000,000
steps were performed for each combination of crown
group age prior (24 MYA, 28.5 MYA) and root height prior
(24 MYA, 28.5 MYA, 33.7 MYA), with parameters logged
every 1,000 steps. The Auto Optimize Operators function
was enabled to maximize efficiency of MCMC runs. Three
independent MCMC runs for each analysis were combined to estimate the posterior distribution of the substitution model and tree model parameters, as well as node
ages. Analyses of these parameters in Tracer 1.3 [129] suggested that the number of MCMC steps was more than
adequate, with effective sample sizes of all parameters
often exceeding 1,000 and Tracer plots showing strong
equilibrium after discarding burn-in.

Note added in proof
After our manuscript had been accepted for publication,
multiple bugs were noted with BEAST v1.4.2, which have
since been corrected in later versions. One of these bugs
did not correctly implement the Yule model of speciation
prior, which we used in our divergence time analyses (see
methods). This incorrect implementation of the Yule
prior could result in biased estimates of divergence times
at the root of the phylogenetic tree, particularly when used
in conjunction with a relaxed molecular clock model, as
we did in our analyses. However, divergence time estimates were probably not significantly biased because we
calibrated the height of the root using three different root
age priors (see [156]). We nevertheless re-estimated divergence times by conducting three independent MCMC
runs using BEAST v1.4.6, the root age and crown age prior
combination of 28.5 MYA and 24 MYA, and all other settings identical to those described (see methods). The estimated ages of the root and node 1 (as well the ages of the
remaining nodes) from the analyses using BEAST v1.4.2
and BEAST v1.4.6 were highly similar (after discarding
burn-in), suggesting that the Yule model bug in BEAST
v1.4.2 did not compromise our divergence time estimates.
For example, the mean age (and 95% HPD) of the root
was estimated as 28.5 MYA (26.6–30.4) and 28.2 MYA
(26.3–30.1 MYA) using BEAST v1.4.2 and BEAST v.1.4.6,
respectively. The mean age and 95% HPD of node 1 using
BEAST v1.4.2 and BEAST v.1.4.6 was 21 MYA (19–23
MYA) and 21.1 MYA (19.1–23.1 MYA), respectively.
