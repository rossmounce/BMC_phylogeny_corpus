Abstract
Background: The Teak defoliator (Hyblaea puera) is a pest moth of teak woodlands in India and
other tropical regions (e.g. Thailand) and is of major economic significance. This pest is of major
concern as it is involved in complete defoliation of trees during the early part of the growing season.
Defoliation does not kill teak trees, but it results in huge amount of timber loss. Teak defoliator
outbreaks are a regular annual feature in most teak plantations in India and it is extremely difficult
to predict the exact time and place of occurrence of these outbreaks. Evidence from the study of
the population dynamics of H. puera indicated habitual, short range movements of emerging moth
populations, suggesting that these populations have spread to larger areas, generation after
generation, affecting the entire teak plantations. We were therefore interested in investigating the
temporal and spatial relationship among various population groups in Nilambur, Kerala (India) and
address the cause of outbreak at the landscape level.
Results: The populations were classified into 'endemic', 'epicenter' and 'epidemic' populations
based on the time of occurrence and size of infestation. We devised a novel method of screening
nuclear and mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms using Randomly Amplified Gene Encoding Primers
(RAGEP). We have used this method extensively to evaluate the species specificity, reproducibility
and to discriminate among the three different characterised populations of teak defoliator.
Conclusions: This method also allowed us to comment with some certainty that the endemic teak
defoliator, H. puera do not play a major role in contributing to large-scale infestations. With respect
to the hypotheses put forward regarding the origin of outbreaks of the moth, this study confirms
the role of migration in outbreak causation, while negating the belief that endemic populations
aggregate to cause an epidemic.

Background
Teak (Tectona grandis L.) is a very valuable timber species,

and is a member of the moist deciduous and dry deciduous forest types. Teak plantations are threatened by two

major pests: the Teak Defoliator (Hyblaea puera Cramer)
Lepidoptera: Hyblaeidae and the Teak Skeletonizer (Eutectona machaeralis (Walker) syn.). H. puera is less widely distributed in the tropics: in Oriental and Australian regions
(India, Sri Lanka, Burma, Java, Papua New-Guinea,
Northern Queensland in Australia, Solomon Islands); in
the West Indies; and in South and parts of East Africa [1].
The Teak defoliator is of major concern since it is involved
in complete defoliation of trees during the early part of
the growing season. Defoliation does not kill the trees, but
does lead to huge timber loss. Recent studies have shown
that the defoliation leads to an average loss of 44% of the
potential volume increment in four to nine year-old teak
plantations. It has been estimated that in the Nilambur
teak plantation during the study period, protected trees
increased by an annual increment of 6.7 m3/ha compared
with 3.7 m3/ha for unprotected trees, a gain of 3 m3/ha
per annum [2].
Teak defoliator outbreaks are a regular annual feature in
teak plantations in Kerala, India. It is difficult to predict
the exact time and place of these outbreaks. Evidence
gathered from the past decade on the population dynamics of H. puera indicates habitual, short range movements
of emerging moth populations, suggesting that these
spread to larger areas, generation after generation, affecting entire teak plantations [3]. Earlier studies also indicated that the outbreaks begin as small epicenters during
the pre-monsoon season [4]. Populations were classified
as 'endemic', 'epicenter' and 'epidemic', based on their
time of occurrence and the density of the population as
represented by the area it infests. Endemics are insects
belonging to the low-density population level; epicenters
are patchy, medium density outbreaks that occur during
the pre-monsoon season, whilst epidemic represents large
area, high-density outbreak populations. An understanding of the origin and spread of the epidemic of this pest,
which erupt suddenly following the pre-monsoon rain
each year, is an important prerequisite for developing
appropriate control strategies. If progenies of the epicenter populations cause the larger epidemics, control of
these could prevent major outbreaks. On the other hand,
if immigrant moths were involved, it would be difficult to
control major outbreaks. Thus, understanding the cause
and effect relationship between initial small outbreaks
and large outbreaks that occur later in the year is crucial
for the control of the pest.
Recently, molecular markers have been used to enhance
understanding of insect displacements, especially including estimates of movement of particular genotypes and/
or biotypes, reproductive strategy and success. Such
approaches have also been used to study founder events
[5], geographical invasions [6], small and large scale displacements [7,8], including movement of entire popula-

tion demes [9], and even altitudinal movements related to
habitat patchiness and persistence [10]. Molecular data
can yield valuable information when integrated with
information from ethology, field ecology, comparative
morphology, systematics and palaeontology [11]. Use of
direct and indirect methods of tracking insects along with
description of the role and utility of various molecular
markers – protein and DNA – in monitoring insect dispersal, has been extensively reviewed [12].
Arbitrarily-primed DNA markers, and involving the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have proved very useful
for genetic fingerprinting and for facilitating positional
cloning of genes. This class of markers are particularly
important for less studied species, for which genome
sequence information is generally not known. These technologies include randomly amplified polymorphic DNA
(RAPDs) [13,14], DNA amplification fingerprinting
(DAF)[15], and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) [16]. In this study, we used a variant of
the RAPD approach involving various nuclear and mitochondrial gene specific primers to trace the origin of teak
defoliator outbreaks. It is expected that the molecular data
would provide the necessary information to elucidate the
origin of the epidemic population. Such information
should prove valuable in planning and implementing
measures to control these pests. Therefore, the aim of the
present study was to identify the relationship among the
three apparent populations – endemic, epicenter and
epidemic.

Results
The nuclear and mitochondrial gene specific primers chosen did not produce any amplification product when used
in combination with the corresponding primers as
described in the UBC primer set kit [17]. This resulted in
our devising a novel PCR, which we have named RAGEPPCR. In RAGEP-PCR, we used single nuclear and mitochondrial gene encoding primers at low stringency
annealing temperatures. Unlike RAPDs, in RAGEP longer
nuclear (21–26 nucleotide) and mitochondrial (19–26
nucleotide) gene encoding primers were utilised, and
which we have here extensively employed to evaluate the
species taxonomic specificity/reproducibility and to discriminate the endemic, epicenter and epidemic populations of teak defoliator from one another.
RAGEP markers were first tested for polymorphisms, species-specificity and repeatability. Similar fingerprinting
pattern were observed in subsequent PCRs for the same
individual using the same primers (Fig 1), which displayed overall robustness and repeatability with RAGEPPCR. It was also possible to discriminate various moth
species based on their species-specific DNA fingerprint
pattern (Fig 2). The bands scored for each nuclear RAGEP

used in the present study were of a size range 200 bp to
1500 bp. With nuclear RAGEP markers, an average of 2–3
monomorphic bands were observed, except for primer
CK6-5'. In each marker, the average number of bands
scored varied from 7–16. The maximum number of bands
was detected using primer cytC-B-3', while the maximum
number of monomorphic bands were detected using
primer EFS599.
Each individual RAGEP marker gel was screened and a
similarity matrix was generated. Subsequently similarity
matrixes of all experimental patterns were combined to
generate a UPGMA (Unweighted pair-group mathematical average) tree. While evaluating the similarity matrix
based on the Dice coefficient for all nuclear specific
RAGEP markers and whilst constructing a UPGMA tree, it
was observed that the various population groups of H.
puera fall in two clusters, which are further divided into
two major sub clusters. Average similarity between the
two major clusters was 20%, while that between the two
sub clusters was 34%. In one of the major clusters, we

observed all the endemic insects clustering together with
some of the populations from the epicenter insects; however, both populations fall in two distinct sub-clusters (Fig
3). Similarly in the second major cluster, the remaining
populations from the epicenter and entire epidemic insect
populations were likewise seen to fall into two distinct
sub-clusters.
Using the mitochondrial RAGEP markers, the average
numbers of bands scored for each primer ranged from 6–
15. All bands scored were of size range 300 bp to 1600 kb.
The maximum numbers of bands detected was found
using primer SR-J-14233, the minimum numbers using
marker N4-N-8924. Among mitochondrial markers, an
average of 1–2 monomorphic bands were observed. The
maximum number of monomorphic bands was observed
using marker CB-N-10920.
Two distinct clusters were observed in the UPGMA dendrogram for mitochondrial markers. Similarity between
the two clusters was only 20%. One of these clusters

comprised the majority of the endemic samples with a few
samples from epicenter insects, whilst the other cluster
was comparatively larger and had the two major sub clusters. Both these sub-clusters have insects from epicenter
and epidemic populations (Fig 4). From this dendrogram,
it may be deduced that all the seven epidemic population
samples tested in the study shared the same gene pool
with sets of epicenter populations. In contrast, the
endemic populations are genetically distant from the epicenter populations.

Discussion
The first teak plantation in India was started as early as
1842 in Nilambur, Kerala State, India. Preliminary information on the life history of H. puera and the nature of its
damage was published in 1898 [18]. H. puera outbreaks
have been reported to begin in small epicenters and later
spread to larger areas. It was then suspected that population build-up in the early outbreak epicenters might
account for the subsequent widespread epidemic. However, a study using the time lapse (developmental time)
between two epidemics to determine whether an earlier

epidemic was responsible for causing the subsequent outbreak showed that all subsequent outbreaks could not be
attributed to previous outbreaks, thereby indicating the
possibility of migrant populations being involved [19].
Several technical advancements on the DNA fingerprinting methodologies have been established to resolve the
taxonomic uncertainties and address the issue on species
variability and migration [13-16,20,21]. The RAGEP-PCR
method described here uses gene-specific primers and
randomly amplifies the nuclear and mitochondrial-like
gene products. Longer mitochondrial (19–26 nucleotide)
gene encoding primers are likely to increase the reproducibility and specificity when compared to RAPD technique.
This method was found to be efficient, simple and highly
reproducible. Here it has been effectively used to discriminate the various population groups of H. puera infesting
teak plantations in South India. It can also be used to discriminate taxonomically various closely – related moths
to the species level. Mitochondrial RAGEP fingerprints are
derived from the randomness of RAGEP-PCR. It is difficult
to predict with certainty that the bands are diagnostic

feature of the mitochondrial genome, but since RAGEP
PCR uses gene specific primers, the PCR products could
therefore be a result of amplification of homologous
genes or pseudogenes which could represent nuclear
mitochondrial DNA (NUMTs). Mitochondrial DNA
sequences are frequently transferred to the nucleus-giving
rise to NUMTs, which are considered to be common in
eukaryotes [22]. Very high rate of horizontal transfer
between organellar and nuclear genomes has been
reported in the brown mountain grasshopper, Podisma
pedestris (L.)[23].
Age groups, sexes, life history variants, etc. and the processes including birth, death, immigration and emigration
as different phenotypic classes have been very well
defined [24]. While studying the differentiation process of
grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.) populations across agricultural ecosystems using DNA fingerprinting [(GATA)4]
and RAPDs, it was possible to discriminate the micro- and
macro geographical heterogeneity [25]. Highly diagnostic
banding patterns in individuals of S. avenae on wheat and
cocksfoot grass, Dactylis glomerata (L.) were observed during the early months of infestation, which declined as the
season progressed, largely as a result of genetic drift and
local movement between adjacent host species [26].
Monophyly and a strong biogeographic pattern of each
biotype have been reported in whitefly, Bemisia tabaci
(Gennadius) populations studied throughout the world
[27]. While evaluating the genetic structure in introduced
population of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Buren) using
different classes of markers, it was confirmed that both
mitochondrial and nuclear markers display the same hierarchical structure [28]. Distinct mitochondrial and
nuclear DNA sequence divergence patterns for phylogenetic inference has been established among nymphalid
butterflies [29].
The present study using RAGEP-PCR provides a tool for a
logical continuation of the earlier work to trace the relationship of endemic, epicenter and epidemic populations
of the teak defoliator. The dendrogram produced from
nuclear RAGEP clearly indicates that the endemic insects
are not involved in causing the epidemic; however, they
are apparently involved in the localized spread by building up small epicenter populations. Similarly, while evaluating the observation based on mitochondrial RAGEP's,
it is further apparent that endemic populations were not
involved in causing the epidemic. This suggests that all the
epidemic insects, which are spatially distinct, but temporally co-occurring, share the same gene pool.

Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis (Kuschel) in
New Zealand, was traced to the eastern coast of South
America [30]. Use of RAPDs to examine, for example,
population subdivision of the saw toothed grain beetle,
Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) [31], characterization and
identification of Asian and North American gypsy moth,
Lymantria dispar (L.) [32], host based genotype variation
in S. avenae [33], and genotypic variation among different
phenotypes of asexual adult winged and wingless of some
clones of cereal aphid species [34], has been well documented. Earlier reports involving molecular DNA markers
mention the use of these markers in the detection of sibling species of black flies, Simulium spp. [35], whilst the
dynamics of colonization of Drosophila subobscura (Collin) [36] in the west coast of North America and its impact
in the sibling species Drosophila athabasca Sturtevant and
Dobzhansky, and Drosophila azteca Sturtevant and
Dobzhansky has been extensively studied by allozymes,
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and RAPD markers.
With the Teak defoliator, earlier studies based on temporal and spatial distribution of the larvae indicated that the
epicenters were not constant over the years and did not
represent highly favourable local environments [3]. The
present study found little evidence to show that the aggregation of moths belonging to the endemic populations
cause the epicenter populations. On the other hand, the
findings do suggest the alternate hypothesis, i.e., that
immigration of moths from distant teak plantations cause
the epidemic, and that there is a continuous inflow of
moths during the infestation period. This suggests that
under a single demographic structure, two phenotypic
classes of H. puera coexist during the outbreak season. The
degree of variability observed for RAGEPs also argues that
this technique could be useful for a variety of questions,
including individual identification, strain identification
and phylogenetic analysis.

Conclusions
The present results appear to validate the hypothesis, that
control of H. puera epicenter populations would help prevent large-scale outbreaks of the teak defoliator in teak
plantations. Therefore, appropriate strategies should be
adopted to control the epicenter populations, which
occurs in a smaller area. This appears to be a more practical and economical approach for teak defoliator management when compared with management of the pest in the
total plantation area covering thousands of hectares. Thus
the molecular markers detected using RAGEP-PCR can
enhance the understanding of insect population dynamics and aid in tracing the spread and cause of epidemics.

Randomness of genome amplification methods have
been efficiently used in constructing the phylogenetic history in the weevil, Aubeonymus mariafranciscae (Roudier),
which had diverged recently [5], whilst the origin of the

Methods
Sample collection
Based on the spatial pattern of infestation in the past, the
area was divided into convenient observation units of
approximately 50 ha, based on natural boundaries of
streams, roads and footpaths. The canopy of teak is continuous within in the observation area. Each area was
monitored every 15 days, which was precisely based on
the life cycle of H. puera. Larval samples were collected
from the infestation sites. Whenever fifth instar larvae
were available, ten larvae were preserved in 70 % alcohol
and stored deep frozen at -20°C. If only lower stages were
available, i.e., third or fourth instar, they were reared up to
5th instar in the laboratory. Ten 5th instar larvae were preserved for DNA isolation from each sample site, whilst the
remaining larvae were reared into the next generation.
Each sample was assigned a code number containing the
details of Year / Month / Date / Block / Grid / Generation
for further reference. Using the duration of each instar
(egg – one day; 1st and 2nd instars – two days each, 3rd to
5th instars – three days each; pre-pupa – one day and pupa
– four days), the temporal data on outbreaks were examined to see whether each subsequent epidemic could be
explained on the basis of a previous outbreak. The details
of location of pest incidence and extent of infestation
were later transferred to the field map in order to understand the spatial pattern of infestation (Fig 5).

Populations were classified as 'endemic', 'epicenter' and
'epidemic', based on their time of occurrence and the density of the population as represented by the area it infests.
Five endemic populations, twenty six epicenter populations and seven epidemic populations for the year 2002
were included in the study. Earlier studies had indicated
that outbreak begin as small epicenters in February during
the pre-monsoon season and end by June. Endemic samples were collected throughout that year based on their
stray occurrences in various life stages, whilst epicenter
samples from each aggregated patch were collected only
from the insects that attained the same stage of its life
cycle at the time of collection in that patch. Similarly the
epidemic samples were also collected from insects representing the same life stages at the time of collection from
each aggressive patch. The temporal relationship between
the endemic population and the epicenter populations
and that of the epicenter populations with the large-scale
epidemics were first worked out. The larval samples that
were geographically close and had a difference of one
complete life cycle stage between the population groups
were subjected to molecular studies to evaluate their
relatedness.
DNA isolation
DNA extraction was performed with a minor modification
of isolation and purification protocol as described earlier

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/5/1

[37] being extracted from whole larvae and quantified
spectrophotometrically using a spectrophotometer at 260
nm (Shimadzu). The quality of the DNA was checked
spectrophotometrically by taking the absorbance ratios of
260/280 nm.
Polymerase chain reaction
Both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA RAGEP amplifications were performed in a total volume of 30 µl. Each reaction consisted of 1x Taq buffer with 1.5mM MgCl2, 1.2 U
of Taq polymerase (BG), 0.25 mM of dNTPs (Amersham)
and 12 pM of primer per reaction. Primers were initially
screened for polymorphism and repeatability. Amplifications were performed in similar cycling conditions in a
Thermocycler (Biorad) programmed as follows: initial
denaturation at 95°C for 5 min., followed by 45 cycles of
cycle denaturation at 94°C for 1 min., annealing at 36°C
for 1 min., extension at 72°C for 2 min. and final extension at 72°C for 5 mins. The amplification products were
separated using 1.2% agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer with
ethidium bromide staining to visualize the product separation using a Bio-Rad's Fluor S imager. The molecular
weight of each band was estimated by comparing with a
co-migrating 100-bp ladder (Amersham). RAGEP fingerprints of each sample from different regions were then
interpreted using Fingerprint type module of Bionumerics
software (Applied Maths Kortrijk Belgium, ver.2.0).

A preliminary screening with 50 nuclear RAGEPs and 37
mitochondrial RAGEP primers were evaluated for polymorphism and repeatability. Only 11 nuclear (Table-1)
and mitochondrial RAGEPs (Table-2) from each group
was selected for the study, as they showed constant
repeatability of highly polymorphic patterns. Species specificity was evaluated by comparing the banding patterns
in H. puera with those from the Teak skeletonizer, E. machaeralis (Walk.), Leaf roller, Sylepta derogata (F.), Leaf
folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée), and the Silkworm, Bombyx mori (L.).
Analysis
The polymorphic content for nuclear and mitochondrial
primers were analyzed using Bionumerics software [38].
Band search parameters were kept constant as 5% minimum profiling for all the gels. The position tolerance for
selection of bands in constructing a dendrogram was kept
constant at 1% through out the interpretations. Only
bands showing clear and reproducible patterns were
included in the final analysis and these were scored. Realtime normalization of gel electrophoresis patterns and
band position for all the gels was based on the reference
system for the species-specific bands. Normalization
helped us to control the brightness and streakiness of
bands without altering the lighter bands and also control
the inter-gel mobility shifts. Subsequently a data matrix of

similarity values was produced for each individual for
each marker. The Dice coefficient was used to analyze the
similarities of the banding patterns. Consensus similarity
matrix and dendrogram based upon individual matrices
from different markers were used for pair wise clustering
based on unweighted pair group method (UPGMA) with
average linkages (11). The UPGMA dendrogram prevails
on the assumption that nucleotide substitution rates are
same across all branches. It employs a sequential
clustering algorithm, in which local topological relationships are identified in order of similarity, and the
phylogenetic tree is built in a stepwise manner. All analysis was done using Bionumerics software V-2.
