Abstract
Background: In this study we examined the karyotypes of morphologically indistinguishable
populations of the electric knifefish Gymnotus carapo sensu stricto from the Eastern Amazon of Brazil.
These were identified unambiguously on the basis of external morphology, meristics, and
pigmentation.
Results: Specimens from one of five localities exhibited a karyotype previously not documented
for Gymnotus species in the Amazon basin: 2n = 40 (34M/SM+6ST/A). Samples from the other four
localities exhibited a different karyotype: 2n = 42 (30M/SM+12ST/A), which we had previously
described. Specimens from all five localities presented constitutive heterochromatin in the
centromeric region of almost all chromosomes, including in the distal and interstitial regions.
Staining with 4'6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole revealed C-positive banding. In both karyotypes the
Nucleolar Organizer Region (NOR) was located on the short arm of pair 20, and Chromomycin
A3 stained the NORs. Fluorescent in situ hybridization with telomeric probes showed an Interstitial
Telomeric Sequence (ITS) in the proximal short arm of a metacentric pair in the 2n = 40 karyotype.
Conclusion: The difference between the two karyotypes on the diploid number and chromosome
morphology can be explained by rearrangements of the fusion-fission type and also by pericentric
inversions. The presence of ITS in a metacentric pair of the 2n = 40 karyotype suggests that the
difference in the diploid number of the karyotypes results from a fusion. The consistent 2n = 42
karyotype at four localities suggests an interbreeding population. However, because fusion-fission
and pericentric inversions of this nature typically result in reproductive isolation, we speculate that
the form with the 2n = 40 karyotype is a different species to that of the 2n = 42 form. Nonetheless,
we did not observe evident differences in external morphology, meristics and pigmentation
between the two forms, which suggest that they represent cryptic sympatric species in the G.
carapo species complex. We speculate that the chromosomal speciation occurred recently,
allowing insufficient time for the fixation of other differences following post-zygotic isolation.

Background
Gymnotus (Gymnotiformes, Gymnotidae) is the most
diverse known Neotropical electric knife fish genus. It currently holds 33 valid described species and many additional undescribed species are known from museum
collections [1-4]. Gymnotus has the ability to generate a
pulsed electrostatic field from a specialized electric organ
and detect electrostatic fields with electroreceptors. These
Electric Organ Discharges (EODs) permit electrolocation,
the detection of objects within the electrostatic field, and
also electrocommunication (review in [5]; [3]).
The diploid number of chromosomes in Gymnotus has
been documented to vary from 2n = 39–40 (with sex chromosomes of the type X1X2Y) to 2n = 54, exhibiting variation in the karyotype formula, the quantity of
heterochromatin, and the position of the Nucleolar
Organization Region (NOR) [6-9].
The species Gymnotus carapo (L.) sensu stricto, as currently
defined [10], occurs over large areas of northern South
America: in the Amazon and Orinoco basins, the coastal
drainages of the Guyanas, and some coastal basins of
Northeastern Brazil. The Linnaean syntypes of G. carapo
were collected in the first half of the 18th Century near Paramaribo, Surinam [10].
A complex of additional morphologically similar or cryptic species that closely resemble G. carapo sensu stricto are
known to extend as far south as Northern Argentina
(Albert, Crampton, pers. obs). Likewise, some populations within the currently defined range of G. carapo sensu
stricto may also prove to be distinct species within this species-complex. This G. carapo species-complex is not to be
confused with the G. carapo species-group, which currently comprises 18 well-defined species in which there
are two (vs. one) laterosensory pores in the dorsoposterior
portion of the preopercle (and which includes G. carapo
sensu stricto). G. carapo senso stricto can be distinguished
from all other members of the G. carapo species-group by
a combination of characters that are listed in the description of the species [10]. It has a distinct color pattern comprising 16–27 dark obliquely oriented pigment bands or
pand-pairs, with irregular wavy margins, often broken
into spots above the lateral line. This distinct pigmentation pattern is shared only with G. arapaima and G. diamantinensis, from which G. carapo senso stricto can be
distinguished on the basis of morphological and meristic
characters.
At least four new species from the G. carapo species-group
are currently being described from southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina (Crampton, Albert, Cognato and
Richer-de-Forges, in review). However, many taxonomic
uncertainties will be resolved only by using a combina-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/75

tion of traditional taxonomy (based on morphology),
molecular systematic techniques, cytogenetic analysis,
and an examination of the diversity of EODs.
Cytogenetic variation has probably played an important
role in the diversification of species in the G. carapo species-complex. Previous studies have indicated that forms
identified as G. carapo exhibit different karyotypes (e.g. 2n
= 48 in Amazonas, 2n = 42 in Pará, 2n = 54 and 2n = 52
from Southern Brazil) (reviewed in [9]). Whether this
diversity is the manifestation of cryptic species diversity in
a G. carapo species-complex or, alternatively, intraspecific
cytogenetic diversity is currently unknown. Nonetheless,
this question is of great relevance to our understanding of
diversification in the genus. In this contribution, which
forms the second in a series on the evolutionary cytogenetics of Gymnotus, we describe a novel karyotype in a
population of Gymnotus carapo from the Eastern Amazon.
We speculate that this may have evolved from chromosomal rearrangement of the karyotype of a more common, sympatrically co-occurring form.

Methods
We performed cytogenetic analysis on 17 specimens of
Gymnotus from five localities in Pará State, Brazil, in the
Eastern Amazon basin (Table 1, Figure 1). Morphological
measurements and meristic counts were undertaken from
specimens fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and then preserved in 70% ethanol. Morphometric data were taken as
point-to-point linear distances from standardized landmarks on the left side of adult specimens using digital calipers to the nearest mm. Protocols for measurements
follow those of [10,11] and [12] and abbreviations are
given in Table 2. Two additional morphometric measurements were included: Head depth measured vertically at
the mid point of the eye and Eye diameter measured horizontally from the anterior to posterior extremities of the
orbital margin. Morphological measurements as a proportion of TL were not included for analysis in specimens
with damage to the caudal appendage exceeding an estimated 5% of intact TL. Meristic and scale count procedures follow [11], and abbreviations are given in Table 3.
We refer to the vertical bars of Gymnotus as 'bands', as has
become the standard in the literature on this genus. Principal component analysis of morphological and meristic
data was undertaken using Statistica 7.1 (Statsoft, Tulsa,
OK). The sex of each specimen was determined by dissection under a stereo microscope. Female ovaries contain
yellowish eggs, while male testes are smooth and pinkish
white.
Metaphase chromosomal preparations were undertaken
following the methods described by [13]. In brief: specimens were injected with a 0.025% colchicine solution in
the proportion 0.5 ml/100 g body weight. After dissec-

tion, the kidney cells were suspended in 0.075 M KCl and
incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The hypotonically treated
cell suspension was then centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in fixative (3:1 methanol: acetic acid solution)
and centrifuged twice. The final pellet was suspended in
fresh fixative and dropped onto warmed slides. The slides
were analyzed after conventional Giemsa staining, Cbanding [14], silver staining of NORs [15], CMA3 staining
[16], DAPI staining [17], and Fluorescente in situ Hybridization (FISH) with telomeric probes (All Telomere
Probes, Oncor). Chromosomes were morphologically
classified according to [18]. Fish specimens for which
cytogenetic analysis was conducted were vouchered at the

Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi (MPEG) and the lot numbers are listed in Table 1.

Results
The examined specimens measured between 150 and 350
mm total length and weighed from 10 to 160 g. All had
fully developed gonads and were easily sexed.
Around 20 metaphase plates for each individual specimen
were examined using the procedures described above. We
found two distinct karyotypes. Photographs of specimens

sented a karyotype with a 2n (diploid number) of 42, and
FN (Fundamental Number) of 72, of which 30 chromosomes were metacentric/submetacentric, and 12 subtelocentric/acrocentric (Figure 3a). At site 5 (Almeirim, Table
1, Figure 1) all specimens presented a karyotype with 2n =
40 and FN = 74, of which 34 chromosomes were metacentric/submetacentric, and 6 subtelocentric/acrocentric (Figure 4a).
In both karyotypes the NOR is heteromorphic and is
found in the short arm of pair 20. The 2n = 40 karyotype
has an additional heterochromatin in the distal position
of this pair (Figures 3a and 4a).
The C-banding in the 2n = 42 karyotype shows that the
constitutive heterochromatin (CH) exhibits a centromeric
location in all the chromosomes and interstitial regions
on the short arms of chromosome 6 (Figure 3b). The Cbanding in the 2n = 40 karyotype shows that the CH
exhibits a centromeric location on almost all the chromosomes (with the exception of pairs 13, 14 and 17) and
interstitial regions on the short arms of chromosome 9
(Figure 4b). One of the NOR-bearing chromosomes also
possesses a block on the distal region of the short arm.

In both the 2n = 40 and 2n = 42 karyotypes, the CMA3
(Figures 3d and 4d) indicates the presence of a region rich
in Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) base pairs coincident with the
location of the NOR. The DAPI banding (Figures 3c and
4c) is coincident with the C-band. This demonstrates that
the CH of these Gymnotus is rich in Adenine-Thymine (AT) base pairs. FISH with telomeric probes hybridized all
the telomeres. Additionally, in the 2n = 40 karyotype,
there is an Interstitial Telomeric Sequence (ITS) in a metacentric pair on the short arm, close to the centromere
(Figure 5).
We observed no consistent differences in pigmentation or
banding pattern between the animals with the two karyotypes described above (Figure 2). All exhibited the double
bands with wavy indistinct margins characteristic of G.
carapo senso stricto populations from the Eastern Amazon
(Figure 2) (see [10], p. 10). Morphometric and meristic
analysis of the two karyotypic forms indicated overlap for
every measured parameter (Tables 2, 3). Principal component analysis of morphological and meristic analysis also
failed to recover generalized differences between the two
forms (Figure 6). Morphological measurements and meristic counts for each karyotypic form fell within the ranges

The 2n = 40 karyotype (28M/SM+12ST/A) from Almeirim

from Gymnotus of the Amazon basin. Nonetheless, this
diploid number has previously been documented for
other species from more southerly regions of South America, but with variation in the karyotypic formula. G. sylvius

disparate phylogenetic positions of G. sylvius, G. pantanal
and G. carapo senso stricto hypothesized by [1] indicates
that the diploid number of 2n = 40 is homoplastic.

published for Eastern Amazonian populations of Gymnotus carapo by [10], pp. 10–19 (Tables 2, 3). Morphological
and meristic characters overlapped between the two
forms. Finally, observation of the osteology of cleared and
stained specimens did not reveal any obvious differences
in the structure or organization of bony or cartilaginous
elements. In sum, we found no evidence of morphological differentiation between the 2n = 40 and 2n = 42 karyotypic forms.

Discussion
The karyotype with the diploid number of 2n = 42 (30M/
SM+12ST/A) found in G. carapo from localities 1–4 (Table
1) is the same as that previously characterized from Santa
Cruz do Arari, Ilha do Marajó [9]. An almost identical
karyotype, 2n = 42 (32M/SM+10ST/A), was also described
[6] from G. carapo collected near Belém, Pará. The difference in morphology of one chromosomal pair may be
attributed to a pericentric inversion. Alternatively, the
other authors [6] may have interpreted the morphological
classification of the pair differently, perhaps due to different degrees of condensation of the metaphase chromosomes. In either case, the data suggest that there is one
common form of G. carapo with a homogenous 2n = 42
karyotype in the Eastern Amazon region of Belém and
Marajó Island.

The location of NOR in both the 2n = 42 and 2n = 40 karyotypes were detected in the short arm of a unique pair of
chromosomes, resembling the condition for karyotypes
previously described in other species of Gymnotus
[6,8,9,19,22,25,26].
The banding with fluorescent stains CMA3 and DAPI corroborates results previously obtained in other species of
Neotropical freshwater fishes, where CMA3 preferentially
stains the NOR, and where DAPI exhibits a banding
model similar to that of C-banding [27].
The occurrence and apparent abundance of the same 2n =
42 form of G. carapo at multiple localities around the
mouth of the Amazon: Belém [6], Santa Cruz do Arari [9]
and localities 1–4 (Table 1, Figure 1), and the absence of
substantial morphological variation between or within
these samples suggest that they together constitute an
interbreeding population of a single species. This same situation has been reported by [19] for four species of Gymnotus occurring in southeast Brazilian drainages: G.
"carapo" (in fact an undescribed species that is not G.
carapo) from twelve localities; G. inaequilabiatus (in fact
also an undescribed species that is not G. inaequilabiatus)
from two localities, G. sylvius from eight localities, and G.
pantherinus from four localities. The authors of this study
also observed that individuals of the same species always
possessed the same karyotype in different localities, for
example, 2n = 54, 52M/SM+2ST/A in G. "carapo".
The difference in the diploid number (2n = 40 and 2n =
42) reported here can be explained by a fusion-fission
rearrangement. The presence of an ITS in a metacentric
pair in the 2n = 40 karyotype (Figure 5b) supports the
fusion hypothesis, where two ST/A pairs from the 2n = 42
karyotype fused originating a M/SM pair in the 2n = 40
karyotype. The morphologic variation in the karyotypic
formula (2n = 40: 34M/SM+6ST/A e 2n = 42: 30M/
SM+12ST/A) can be explained also by pericentric inversions. According to [28], multiple pericentric inversions

are an important post-zygotic reproduction isolation
mechanism. The absence of morphologic differentiation
suggests that the putative chromosomal speciation event
occurred recently and that there was consequently insufficient time for the fixation of phenotypic differences. These
considerations lead us to speculate that the Almeirim
sample may be a cryptic species that is isolated by postzygotic reproductive barriers from an extant sister taxon
(the 2n = 42 form), and from which it derived by chromosomal rearrangement. This hypothesis is amenable to
empirical test with molecular phylogenetic data and by
examination of EOD signal variation.
A bibliographical survey of cytogenetic data for taxa
assigned to G. carapo indicates a large amount of chromosomal variability (Figure 1 and Table 4) through Brazil.
For instance a sample from Humaitá, in the Rio Madeira
basin of Amazonas State exhibited a diploid number of 2n
= 48 [6]. Several samples from the Brazilian state of São
Paulo (at Jundiaí, Rio Claro, Americana, Botucatu, Paula
Souza, Salto Grande, Primeiro de Maio, Pirassununga,
Mococa, São Simão, Santa Maria da Serra and Jacareí) presented diploid numbers varying from 2n = 52 to 54
[6,19,21,26]. As discussed earlier, G. carapo senso stricto
[10] and also closely related G. carapo-like forms from further south probably comprises a complex of morphologically similar or cryptic species (Crampton and Albert,
pers. obs.), with species-level variation in karyotypes. The
existence of a cryptic species of Gymnotus carapo (2n = 40)
from Almeirim, in a region otherwise dominated by a sin-

gle 2n = 42 taxon, is concordant with this emerging
notion.
We expect that the wide geographic range, diversity of species, and cytogenetic diversity of the Gymnotus carapo species-complex will provide a good testing ground for
exploring the role of chromosomal evolution in speciation. A holistic approach involving cytogenetics, phylogenetic systematics, population genetics, and the study of
electric communication signals (putative pre-zygotic
reproductive isolating barriers, see [29-31]) may allow us
to trace individual speciation events (including those separating extant sister species) to documented chromosomal rearrangement events, such as the one we
hypothesize here.

Conclusion
The difference in the diploid number and FN between a
2n = 42 form of Gymnotus from the Eastern Amazon, and
a morphologically identical form with 2n = 40 can be
explained by a fusion/fission and pericentric inversions
rearrangements. We speculate that these two forms are
cryptic species, isolated from each other by post-zygotic
reproductive isolating barriers.
