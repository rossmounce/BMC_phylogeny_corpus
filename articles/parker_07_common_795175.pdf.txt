Abstract
Background: Campylobacter jejuni has been divided into two subspecies: C. jejuni subsp. jejuni (Cjj)
and C. jejuni subsp. doylei (Cjd). Nearly all of the C. jejuni strains isolated are Cjj; nevertheless,
although Cjd strains are isolated infrequently, they differ from Cjj in two key aspects: they are
obtained primarily from human clinical samples and are associated often with bacteremia, in
addition to gastroenteritis. In this study, we utilized multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and a DNA
microarray-based comparative genomic indexing (CGI) approach to examine the genomic diversity
and gene content of Cjd strains.
Results: A geographically diverse collection of eight Cjd strains was examined by MLST and
determined to be phylogenetically distinct from Cjj strains. Microarray-based CGI approach also
supported this. We were able to demonstrate that Cjd strains exhibited divergence from Cjj strains
NCTC 11168 and RM1221 in many of the intraspecies hypervariable regions. Moreover, multiple
metabolic, transport and virulence functions (e.g. cytolethal distending toxin) were shown to be
absent in the Cjd strains examined.
Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that Cjd are phylogenetically distinct from Cjj strains. Using the
CGI approach, we identified subsets of absent genes from amongst the C. jejuni genes that provide
clues as to the potential evolutionary origin and unusual pathogenicity of Cjd.

Background
Campylobacter jejuni consists of two subspecies: C. jejuni
subsp. jejuni (Cjj) and C. jejuni subsp. doylei (Cjd). Cjd
strains originally were identified as gastric campylobacters
from human gastric biopsies [1] and nitrate-negative
campylobacters from pediatric patients with gastroenteritis [2]. The major phenotypic characteristic commonly
used to distinguish Cjd strains from Cjj strains, is the inability of Cjd to reduce nitrate. Other phenotypic characteristics also associated with Cjd include variable growth at

42°C [3], high susceptibility to cephalothin [3], and the
absence of γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and L-arginine
arylamidase activity [4]. However, like Cjj, all Cjd strains
are hippuricase positive.
In clinically-related aspects, Cjd strains also differ from
Cjj. First, Cjd strains cause both gastritis [1,5] and enteritis
[3,6-8], and often are isolated from pediatric patients [3,79]. Second, Cjd strains are isolated more often from blood
cultures than from stool cultures [3]. Moreover, Morey

reported that Cjd was isolated from 85.2% of Campylobacter/Helicobacter-related bacteremia cases in Australia
during a five-year period [9]. Additionally, Cjd was isolated from 9.7% of the Campylobacter-positive stool cultures but 24% of the Campylobacter-positive blood cultures
[10], obtained at Red Cross Children's Hospital, Cape
Town, during the years 1977–1995.
Despite the unusual clinical symptomatology, Cjd is isolated infrequently and few strains exist (compared to Cjj)
for this subspecies. One possible reason is that many clinical laboratories do not characterize Campylobacter isolates
past the genus level or subspeciate C. jejuni isolates as Cjj
or Cjd. Moreover, normal Cjj culturing methods select
against Cjd that are susceptible to cephalothin and exhibit
variable growth at 42°C. This appears to be supported by
the fact that in South Africa, Cjd strains represent a significant proportion of the total campylobacters isolated from
human clinical samples; where 16% of the non-Cjj/coli
Campylobacter isolates were Cjd. These isolates were
obtained using the Cape Town Protocol [3,11] which uses
passive filtration through a 0.65 µM membrane filter,
growth at 37°C and no antibiotic selection.
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) [12-17] and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
[18-23] have been utilized by several groups to assess
genomic diversity and index the gene content of hundreds
of C. jejuni strains. In particular, these CGH or comparative gene indexing (CGI) studies identified regions of
intraspecies hypervariability, such as the lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis (LOS), capsular biosynthesis (CAP),
flagellar modification (FM), and DNA restriction/modification (R/M) loci [18-23]. Furthermore, DNA sequencing
of certain intraspecies hypervariable loci identified diversity in both the DNA sequence of common genes and the
gene composition at each locus. [24-27].
In this study, we have exploited the sequencing of housekeeping genes (MLST) and DNA microarray-based CGI to
examine the genomic relationship between Cjd strains, to

determine the relationship between Cjd and Cjj strains,
and to identify possible genomic factors that may have
contributed to the emergence of Cjd strains. The MLST
indicated that Cjd strains in our geographically diverse
collection are highly related. Moreover, CGI analysis identified genomic regions that are commonly absent from
Cjd strains and may contribute to their pathogenic characteristics.

Results and discussion
Sequence typing of Cjd strains
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of the eight Cjd
strains listed in Table 1 identified six novel sequence types
(STs) (Fig. 1A). Prior to this study, no Cjd STs were present
(or at least STs from strains identified definitively as Cjd)
in the Campylobacter jejuni/coli MLST database. It was
intriguing that all eight Cjd strains contained the same
aspA allele, aspA63, considering the geographical and temporal range of the strains. However, aspA has been shown
previously to be associated also with a subgroup of
campylobacters (e.g. the "jejuni-like" aspA103 allele in
cluster II C. coli strains from turkeys [28]); therefore, it is
possible that aspA is linked to a locus important for colonization or virulence, and that conservation at this locus
is maintained by interstrain recombination. The aspA63
allele has been identified only three times before, in STs
ST-6, ST-1458 and ST-2532. The phylogenetic relationship between the six Cjd STs and representative Cjj and C.
coli (Cc) STs was also determined (Fig. 1B). The housekeeping gene sequences of each ST were concatenated and
aligned. The Cjd strains form a distinct clade within the
resulting dendogram supporting their subspecies designation. A similar organization of Cjd strains into a distinct
cluster was observed previously using AFLP [29,30] and
were observed in this study also by comparative genomic
indexing (see below).

The presence of a single Cjd cluster invites the possibility
that Cjd strains form a discrete group within the species
and that no (or at best minimal) genetic exchange occurs
between the two subspecies. Unfortunately, the resolution

not shown); ST-1842 and ST-1843 formed a two-ST clonal
complex, ST-1845 (represented by strain 269.97) formed
a clonal complex with ST-1458, and the remaining three
Cjd STs were singletons. Although the presence of ST-1458
in the same clonal complex as 269.97 might indicate lateral gene exchange between the two subspecies, it is
unclear from the data available if the strain representing
ST-1458 is a Cjj or a Cjd. The same could be said, presumably, for a large number of strains within the C. jejuni
MLST database that may not have been identified to the
subspecies level. Therefore, to determine the nature of the
origin and/or evolution of the Cjd subspecies and to determine whether Cjd alleles arise through the accumulation
of point mutations or through a more rapid mechanism
of exchange and recombination, additional experiments
and analyses will be necessary. Such experiments would
entail the characterization of a much larger and geographically diverse set of Cjd strains and the further identification of strains within the C. jejuni MLST database to the
subspecies level. Characterization of additional Cjd
strains might explain also the noteworthy conservation of
the aspA63 allele within the subspecies.

of such hypotheses by this study are hindered by the small
size of the MLST-typed Cjd sample set (N = 8) and the
high frequency of novel MLST alleles among the Cjd
strains. With the exception of strain 269.97, the Cjd strains
characterized in this study each possess six novel MLST
alleles, with the seventh allele being the aspA63 allele
described above. Thus, eBURST analysis, using 2532 C.
jejuni (Cjj and Cjd) STs and a group definition of four
common alleles, was not particularly informative (data

Comparative genomic indexing of the Cjd strains
We further examined the genomic diversity of these eight
Cjd strains more comprehensively by comparative
genomic indexing (CGI) analysis. The CGI analysis
allowed the assessment of gene content for each Cjd strain
relative to the multi-strain C. jejuni DNA microarray,
described previously [23], that comprises 1530 genes
from NCTC 11168 and 227 genes from RM1221.
Genomic DNAs from both NCTC 11168 and RM1221
were used as a reference DNA mixture and competitively
hybridized with genomic DNA from each of the Cjd
strains. We observed that 23.4% (418 of 1786) of the
genes represented on the microarray were highly divergent
or absent (trinary score of 0) in at least one Cjd strain and
262 of these genes were absent from all of 8 of the Cjd
strains in this study. In comparison, we observed 21.5%
(385 of 1786) of the genes were highly divergent or absent
in at least 1 of 35 geographically and temporally diverse
Cjj strains from both humans and animals using this
microarray [23]. The CGI data sets as trinary scores for the
Cjd strains are available as an additional table [see Additional file 1].

Using cluster analysis, we examined the genomic relationship between the Cjd strains and these 35 diverse Cjj
strains that were analyzed previously [23]. Figure 2 depicts
the relationship among the strains using a standard correlation function and bootstrapping (see Material and
Methods) where the linkage distance between strains is
represented by branch lengths in the resulting hierarchical
cluster. These microarray-based CGI results at the whole
genome level demonstrate that the Cjd strains formed a

ined. It should be noted that the Cjd strains were not all
identical at the hypervariable regions related to surface
structures, including the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis locus (HV region 11) [21-24,32], the flagellar
modification locus (HV region 12) [21-23,33], and the
capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis locus (HV region
13) [21-23,25]. Furthermore, all of the Cjd strains were
distinct from both NCTC 11168 and RM1221 in these
three HV regions. This suggests that the Cjd strains do not
produce one distinct set of surface molecules, nor do they
produce the same surface molecules observed for either
NCTC 11168 or RM1221.

discrete cluster, correlating well with our MLST dendogram.
Intraspecies hypervariability regions and genomic
elements
As with Cjj strains, the majority of genes that were divergent in the Cjd strains were contained within described
regions of intraspecies plasticity (PR)/hypervariability
(HV) [e.g. HV regions 1–18 [22,23] and regions PR1-PR7
[21]. The Cjd strains exhibited identical presence/absence
patterns for genes within 11 of the 18 intraspecies hypervariability regions described recently [23]. Interestingly,
the genes Cj0728-Cj0734 within HV region 9 that were
shown recently to be phosphate-regulated [31] were
absent or highly divergent in all of the Cjd strains exam-

We previously demonstrated the occurrence of four
Campylobacter jejuni integrated elements (CJIE), similar to
those identified in RM1221, in other strains of C. jejuni
[23]. The CJIE1, CJIE2 and CJIE4 show similarity to bacteriophage while CJIE3 may be an integrated plasmid. For
Cjd strains, fewer than 3 genes from the Campylobacter Mulike phage (CJIE1) or CJIE4 were present. We observed
that strain RM4099 possessed a majority of the genes
within CJIE2 described in strain RM1221 [23,34], while
Cjd strains RM1512, RM1513 and RM4098 possessed a
smaller number of genes within CJIE2 (Fig. 2). Although
not visible in Figure 2, these same strains (RM4099,
RM1512, RM1513 and RM4098) also possessed a cluster
of genes from CJIE3 (Cje1093-Cje1100), suggesting the
possibility that a plasmid (integrated or otherwise) is
present in these strains.
Common deletions in Cjd strains
The Cjd strains also had missing genes outside the C. jejuni
intraspecies hypervariable regions. Indeed, 46 genes not
identified previously within the C. jejuni hypervariable
regions, but missing from at least half of the Cjd strains, is
presented in Table 2. Of these, 21 genes were absent from
all Cjd strains (e.g. Cj0005c and Cj0091) and 8 genes were
detected in only one Cjd strain (e.g.Cj0555 and Cj0636).
The largest clusters of highly divergent loci contained
three genes (Cj0201c-Cj0203 and Cj1040c-Cj1042c),
with the remainder distributed uniformly throughout the
chromosome, assuming genomic positions similar to the
two sequenced Cjj strains. The majority (32/46; 70%) of
the Cjd highly-divergent loci encode proteins with
unknown or general function. The remaining genes, such
as argBC, napAB,proA, dcuB, ceuCD, and sdaC, mostly
encode metabolic or transport proteins. Furthermore, the
microarray results suggest that the observed absence of
nitrate reductase activity in Cjd strains is due most likely
to deletions in napA and/or napB. We have confirmed
recently these nap mutations by PCR and sequencing and
our evidence strongly suggests that Cjd arose from a single
evolutionary event, i.e. the napA deletion, with the divergence at napB occurring subsequently [35]. Despite these
results, these metabolic and transport-related genes pro-

vide too few clues into their possible role in Cjd pathogenicity.
The total absence of the virulence gene cdtA (and neartotal absence of cdtB) among the Cjd strains, however,
may be related to pathogenicity (Table 2, Cj0078c and
Cj0079c). The cdt genes encode subunits of the cytolethal
distending toxin (CDT), indicating that Cjd strains do not
produce this toxin. As CDT has been associated with virulence properties in C. jejuni [36-39], and Cjd has been isolated almost exclusively from human clinical samples, it is
intriguing to speculate what role loss of a virulence factor
plays in Cjd pathogenicity. Specifically, CDT from C.jejuni
has been shown to arrest eukaryotic cells in the G2/M
phase of the cell cycle [36,38] and induces the release of
the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-8 (IL-8) [37].
It is possible that due to the absence of CDT,Cjd strains
fail to induce the release of IL-8 and this may be responsible partly for the much higher incidence of Cjd in blood
cultures compared to Cjj. Interestingly, deletions of portions of cdtA and cdtB have recently been reported for
three CDT-negative C. jejuni strains that were also isolated
from patients with bacteremia [40]. This further supports
a relationship between the absence of cdt genes and bacteremia; however, it is not clear if the strains examined in
that study were Cjj or Cjd. Additionally, CGH experiments
comparing 11 [18], 18 [21], or 51 [22]Cjj strains reported
complete conservation of the cdt locus across this subspecies, suggesting that production of CDT may be yet
another marker that distinguishes Cjj and Cjd.

Conclusion
Although Cjd strains have been distinguished from Cjj
strains, due to phenotypic characteristics associated with
Cjd strains, including the inability to reduce nitrate, high
susceptibility to cephalothin and variable growth at 42°C
[3], the genomic relationship between these subspecies
has not been reported previously. Two types of genomic
relationships between the two subspecies were possible:
first, that the Cjd strains represented a phylogeneticallyand phenotypically-distinct clade within C. jejuni and second, that the two subspecies were indistinguishable phylogenetically but possessed unique phenotypic
characteristics. Initial studies that differentiated Campylobacters by amplified fragment length polymorphism
(AFLP) profiling [29,30] suggested that the first possibility
was the most likely. Consistent with these observations,
using MLST and CGI analysis, we confirmed in this study
that Cjd strains are phylogenetically distinct from Cjj
strains. Indeed, all of the Cjd strains examined from our
geographically diverse collection had the same aspA63
allele and possessed a common set of absent or highly variable genes. This set of genes included both genes in the
intrastrain HV regions and 21 genes outside these regions.
Moreover, we recently demonstrated that the loss of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/50

nitrate reductase activity in 27 Cjd strains was the result of
an identical 2761 bp deletion in the nitrate reductase large
subunit-encoding gene, napA [35]. Also, there is a high frequency of novel MLST alleles among the Cjd strains.
Together, these analyses suggest that Cjd strains arose
from a common ancestor. Considering C. jejuni is generally a non-clonal organism with a high frequency of gene
exchange, it is possible that Cjd strains are ecologically isolated from Cjj strains, with MLST alleles arising mainly by
mutation rather than recombination. However, it is also
possible that Cjd strains share the same environment with
Cjj strains but have a barrier to recombination. Characterization of additional Cjd strains might provide clues as to
the potential evolutionary origin of Cjd and their possible
ecological niche.
It is not clear how the common genotypic characteristics
of Cjd, identified in this study, relate to the observed clinical characteristics such as bacteremia [3]. Nevertheless,
the absence of the virulence related genes, cdtA and cdtB
may play a role. It is also possible that there are unidentified virulence-related genes present in the Cjd strains that
are absent from Cjj strains. The current CGI analysis measures the gene content of the Cjd strains relative to the
NCTC 11168 and RM1221 genes present on the microarray; thus, Cjd-specific genes would not be detected by the
CGI analysis. The current genomic sequencing project of
Cjd strain 269.97 by J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) may
identify such unique Cjd genes [41]. It is also possible that
many of the differences between the two subspecies are a
result of more subtle differences. These subtle differences
could be bp changes that result in proteins with a different
topology or substrate specificity or bp changes that affect
gene regulation or protein expression) that would not be
detected using an amplicon-based DNA microarray with
CGI analysis but would be observed from the sequence
data. Additional, comparative genomic analysis will be
possible once the sequence is available.

Methods
Bacterial strains, growth conditions and chemicals
Campylobacter strains used in this study are listed in Table
1. All Cjd strains were cultured routinely at 37°C under
microaerophilic conditions (5% O2, 10% CO2, and
85%N2) on Anaerobe basal agar (ABA; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) amended with 5% (v/v) laked horse blood
(Hema Resource & Supply, Aurora, OR). All chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO)or
Fisher Scientific (Houston, TX). PCR enzymes and reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly,
MA) or Epicentre(Madison, WI). DNA sequencing chemicals and capillaries were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Sequencing and PCR
oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-Biotech
(High Point, NC).

Phenotypic characterization of C. jejuni subsp. doylei
strains
To determine nitrate reduction in C. jejuni, nitrate disks
and anaerobic nitrate reagents A and B (Remel, Lenexa,
KS) were used. Zinc dust was obtained from BioMérieux
(Durham, NC). Cjj strain NCTC 11168 and Cjd strain
ATCC 49350 were used as controls for the procedure.
Each Cjd strain was streaked onto ABA agar supplemented
with 5% horse blood and grown for 48 h as described
above. A nitrate disk was then placed on a thick zone of
growth on the plate and incubated for an additional 24 h
under the same conditions. The nitrate disk was removed
subsequently and placed in a sterile tube. One drop of
both reagents A and B were added to the disk. Reduction
of nitrate is indicated by a color change (clear to red); if no
color change was observed after 3 min, zinc dust was
added. A color change prior to the addition of zinc is
indicative of Cjj and a color change only after addition of
zinc is indicative of Cjd.
Multilocus sequence typing of Cjd isolates
The Cjd isolates in Table 1 were typed as described previously [6,42], using the Cj/Cc MLST primer sets. An inhouse Perl program, MLSTparser was used to extract allele
sequences as described previously [42]. All allelic
sequences were queried against the Campylobacter jejuni/
coli MLST database [43]. Alleles already present in the
database were assigned those numbers; novel alleles and
sequence types (STs) were submitted to the Campylobacter
jejuni/coli MLST database and assigned new numbers.
Each novel Cjd ST was compared to existing Cjj STs by
concatenating the allelic sequences at all loci for that ST
and performing either pairwise BLASTN comparisons
against similarly concatenated Cjj ST sequences or performing CLUSTALX alignments with subsequent phylogenetic analysis. eBURST analysis was performed using the
Imperial College, London eBURST v3 web site [44] and
the Campylobacter jejuni dataset with a group definition of
four.
Fluorescent labeling of genomic DNA and microarray
hybridization
Cjd genomic DNA was prepared using the Wizard
Genomic DNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to
the manufacturer's protocols. Fluorescent labeling reactions of genomic DNA were performed as described previously [23]. Briefly, genomic DNA from the reference
strains (Cjj strain NCTC 11168 and Cjj strain RM1221)
and a test strain were labeled fluorescently with indodicarbocyanine (Cy5)-dUTP and indocarbocyanine (Cy3)dUTP, respectively. Approximately 2 µg of DNA was
mixed with 5 µl 10 × NEBlot labeling buffer, containing
random sequence octamer oligonucleotides (New England Biolabs), and water to a final volume of 41 µl. This
mixture was heated to 95°C for 5 min and then cooled for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/50

5 min at 4°C. After this time, the remainder of the labeling reaction components were added: 5 µl of 10 × dNTP
labeling mix (1.2 mM each dATP, dGTP, dCTP; 0.5 mM
dTTP in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA), 3 µl of Cy3
dUTP or Cy5 dUTP (GE Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and
1 µl of Klenow fragment. The labeling reactions were incubated overnight at 37°C. Labeled DNA was purified from
unincorporated label using Qiaquick PCR Cleanup kits
(Qiagen). Labeling efficiencies were determined using a
NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE) and
efficiently-labeled samples were dried by vacuum.
Microarray hybridization reactions were performed as
described previously [23]. Fluorescently-labeled reference
and test DNAs were combined in 45 µl Pronto! cDNA
hybridization solution (Corning, Corning, NY) and
heated to 95°C for 5 min. Fifteen µl of the hybridization
mixture was applied to a microarray and sealed with a
coverslip. The microarray slide was placed in a hybridization chamber (Corning) and incubated at 42°C for 18 h.
Following hybridization, the slides were washed twice in
2 × SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 42°C for 10 min,
twice in 1 × SSC at room temperature for 10 min, and
finally twice in 0.2 × SSC at room temperature for 5 min.
The microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 300
× g for 10 min before scanning. At least two hybridization
reactions were performed for each test strain.
DNA microarray data acquisition and analysis
We recently described the construction and utilization of
the multi-strain C. jejuni microarray in a comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) study [23]. Briefly, the
multi-strain C. jejuni microarray contains 1530 PCRamplified sequences from the annotated open reading
frames (ORFs) of C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168 and 227
PCR-amplified sequences representing novel C. jejuni
strain RM1221 ORFs spotted in duplicate onto UltraGAPS glass slides (Corning Inc., Corning, NY).

DNA microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix
4000B microarray laser scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc.
Union City, CA). Features and the local background intensities were detected and quantified with GenePix 4.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Poor features were
excluded from further analysis if they contained abnormalities or were within regions of high fluorescent background. The data were filtered so that spots with a
reference signal lower than the background plus 2 standard deviations of the background were discarded. Signal
intensities were corrected by subtracting the local background, and then the Cy5/Cy3 ratios were calculated. To
compensate for unequal dye incorporation, data normalization was performed as described previously [23,45].
Dye-swapping was performed for selected strains and no
effects due to differences in dye incorporation on down-

stream analysis were observed. The presence or absence of
genes from Cjj strain NCTC 11168 and Cjj strain RM1221
in the other Cjj and Cjd strains was determined based on
a comparison of normalized hybridization signal ratios of
the test strain to the combined reference strains Cjj strain
NCTC 11168 and Cjj strain RM1221 for the respective
gene spots. The NCTC 11168 and RM1221 strain-specific
spots hybridized to only half of the reference DNA (Cy5labeled mixture of NCTC 11168 and RM1221 DNA),
increasing the Cy3/Cy5 ratio 2 fold. Therefore, the ratios
for these spots were divided by 2 before determining the
status of the gene. The ratios for spots of each individual
gene were then averaged. As previously described [23], we
defined the status of a gene as present when the Cy3/Cy5
(test/reference) intensity ratio was > 0.6, as divergent/
unknown when the Cy3/Cy5 intensity ratio was between
0.6 and 0.3, and absent when the Cy3/Cy5 intensity ratio
was < 0.3. The presence, divergence and absence status for
all genes was converted into trinary scores (present = 2;
divergent/unknown = 1; absent = 0). The trinary gene
scores for each replicate for all strains were analyzed further with GeneSpring microarray analysis software version 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Redwood City, CA) and
subjected to average-linkage hierarchical clustering with
the standard correlation and bootstrapping.
