Mitochondrial genome sequences illuminate
maternal lineages of conservation concern in a
rare carnivore
Brian J Knaus1, Richard Cronn1*, Aaron Liston2, Kristine Pilgrim3 and Michael K Schwartz3

Abstract
Background: Science-based wildlife management relies on genetic information to infer population connectivity
and identify conservation units. The most commonly used genetic marker for characterizing animal biodiversity
and identifying maternal lineages is the mitochondrial genome. Mitochondrial genotyping figures prominently in
conservation and management plans, with much of the attention focused on the non-coding displacement ("D”)
loop. We used massively parallel multiplexed sequencing to sequence complete mitochondrial genomes from 40
fishers, a threatened carnivore that possesses low mitogenomic diversity. This allowed us to test a key assumption
of conservation genetics, specifically, that the D-loop accurately reflects genealogical relationships and variation of
the larger mitochondrial genome.
Results: Overall mitogenomic divergence in fishers is exceedingly low, with 66 segregating sites and an average
pairwise distance between genomes of 0.00088 across their aligned length (16,290 bp). Estimates of variation and
genealogical relationships from the displacement (D) loop region (299 bp) are contradicted by the complete
mitochondrial genome, as well as the protein coding fraction of the mitochondrial genome. The sources of this
contradiction trace primarily to the near-absence of mutations marking the D-loop region of one of the most
divergent lineages, and secondarily to independent (recurrent) mutations at two nucleotide position in the D-loop
amplicon.
Conclusions: Our study has two important implications. First, inferred genealogical reconstructions based on the
fisher D-loop region contradict inferences based on the entire mitogenome to the point that the populations of
greatest conservation concern cannot be accurately resolved. Whole-genome analysis identifies Californian
haplotypes from the northern-most populations as highly distinctive, with a significant excess of amino acid
changes that may be indicative of molecular adaptation; D-loop sequences fail to identify this unique
mitochondrial lineage. Second, the impact of recurrent mutation appears most acute in closely related haplotypes,
due to the low level of evolutionary signal (unique mutations that mark lineages) relative to evolutionary noise
(recurrent, shared mutation in unrelated haplotypes). For wildlife managers, this means that the populations of
greatest conservation concern may be at the highest risk of being misidentified by D-loop haplotyping. This
message is timely because it highlights the new opportunities for basing conservation decisions on more accurate
genetic information.

Background
Science-based management of biodiversity relies upon
genetic information to identify population connectivity,
conservation units, and evaluate credible divergence
dates [1]. The most popular single marker for characterizing animal biodiversity is the mitochondrial genome,
as mitogenetic variation tracks the matrilineal component of historical genetic diversity, migration routes
[2,3] the timing of divergence events [2-5], and has relevance to fitness [6-8]. Mitochondrial haplotyping efforts
typically focus on hypervariable sites within the displacement ("D”) loop, since high mutation rates within this
region generate substantial haplotypic variation in most
species. The combination of haploidy, uniparental
inheritance, and ease of genotyping this locus has led to
a proliferation of conservation recommendations based
partly - and in some cases entirely - on D-loop genotyping [9].
Due to the relatively small size, conserved gene content and order of animal mitochondria, intraspecific
comparisons of whole mitochondrial genome variation
have been possible for nearly a decade [2,3,5,10,11],
although high per-sample costs limited the widespread
use of such approaches in population-level studies
[2,5,8]. Unlike partial genome sequencing, analysis of
whole mitochondrial genomes makes it practical to partition variation into evolutionarily relevant categories (e.
g., genic, proteins, synonymous, and replacement sites;
putatively neutral, adaptive, and deleterious mutations),
all of which can be used to produce highly accurate estimates of genealogy, divergence events, and possible
adaptation to selective gradients [2,3,5].
Whole mitochondrial genome analysis also makes it
possible to evaluate whether evolutionary inferences
gained from subsets of the genome accurately reflect the
evolutionary dynamics recorded in the full mitochondrial genome. For example, Endicott and Ho [4,12]
observed dramatic differences in mutation rates, mutation saturation, and selective effects in different partitions (e.g., first, second and third codons, D-loop,
rRNA) of human mitochondrial genomes; similar findings have been reported by Ingman and collaborators
[13], also in humans, and by Subramanian et al. [5] in
Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Using whole genome inferences, Kivisild et al. [11] proposed that portions of the mitochondrial genome have undergone
positive selection during the evolution of humans. Similar information has been used to argue for adaptive
divergence in specific mitochondrial genes, as shown by
Castoe et al. [14] for snake evolution and Morin et al.
[8] for killer whale speciation. Complete mitochondrial
genome sequences can improve the resolution of maternal genealogies where subgenomic estimates are

typically poorly resolved, as shown in recent studies
examining the complex pattern of colonization of the
New World by Native Americans [3], or the domestication history of different dog breeds [2]. The comparative
stability of mitochondrial genomes over time also makes
them potential targets for extracting population genomic
information from paleontological specimens representing extinct [4,15-18] and their closely-related extant species. These examples implicate the mitochondrial
genome as a wondrously heterogeneous marker despite its size of only ~16 kb - for which to gain evolutionary inference.
The development of new sequencing technologies
[19-23] and multiplexing approaches [24,25] now make
it practical to sequence population-scale samples of
small genomes at a reasonable cost, and these advancements will encourage widespread use of population-level
mitogenome screening [8,15-18]. Here, we use multiplexed massively parallel sequencing to sequence and
analyze complete mitochondrial genomes from fishers
(Martes pennanti; Figure 1A), a rare carnivore in parts
of its range, and one that has previously been shown to
exhibit low genetic diversity in the mitochondrial
[26,27] and nuclear [28,29] genomes. These data are
used to evaluate the consistency of evolutionary inferences gained from partial genome genotyping (represented by D-loop sequences). We are particularly
interested in evaluating: (1) how much mitochondrial
genetic diversity is captured by partial genomic D-loop
sequencing relative to whole genome sequencing; (2) the
concordance between mitochondrial haplotypes and
lineages identified with these different samples; and (3)
the potential impact of mitogenome-scale information
on the precision of divergence date estimates, with specific focus on differentiating divergence events (e.g.,

Figure 1 North American fisher and its geographic distribution.
Fisher (Martes pennanti), a mid-sized carnivore, is distributed
throughout boreal and montane North America. Subspecific
classification has followed geographic subdivision of this range: ssp.
pennanti occurs in the east (blue), ssp. columbiana occurs in the
Northern Rocky Mountains (light and dark green), and ssp. pacifica
is found along the Pacific coast (light and dark red).

Holocene population and lineage divergence mediated
via European settlement of North America) from more
distant events (e.g., Pleistocene epoch or older).
The fisher is a medium sized carnivore of the mustelid
family, related to marten and wolverine. In North America, where it is endemic, it has a continent-wide distribution across boreal and montane forests (Figure 1B)
and is found in old, structurally-complex forests [30,31].
This species is a habitat specialist relying on snowshoe
hares, red squirrels, small mammals and birds found in
these forests, although it is most noted for its predation
upon porcupines in some areas. Contemporary populations are thriving in eastern North America (M. p. ssp.
pennanti), but the rarity and geographic isolation of
Rocky Mountain (M. p. ssp. columbiana) and Pacific
(M. p. ssp. pacifica) populations (Figure 1B) have
resulted in petitions for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and have motivated reintroduction
efforts (sometimes with non-native subspecies) across its
western range [32].
Previous mtDNA genotyping based on D-loop [26]
and combined D-loop and cytochrome b [32] sequences
of fishers revealed 12 haplotypes range wide. Partitioning of these haplotypes among subspecies groupings was
inconclusive. For example, some observed haplotypes
were unique to geographic and taxonomic partitions.
However, these authors also observed haplotypes that
were shared among these partitions. One haplotype
("haplotype 1”, Figure 3B; [26]) was shared among subspecies pennanti, columbiana and pacifica, and showed
a geographic distribution that spanned Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Idaho, British Columbia and California. In Montana and Idaho, previous mitochondrial
DNA data demonstrated haplotypes present as a result
of reintroductions of fishers to the Rocky Mountains
from eastern and northern populations [30], and identification of a native haplotype that is hypothesized to
have escaped trapping pressure and population extinction during the 20th century [30]. In another case, the
sharing of a haplotype among the rarest populations in
the Sierra Nevada range of Southern California with a
Northern California population has been used to suggest
that California fisher populations were historically connected, despite a gap of 430 km in their current geographic distribution [31,32]. In both Californian and
Rocky Mountain populations, management and conservation decisions have relied on matrilineal inferences
estimated from partial mitochondrial genome sequences,
and these data play a role in ongoing decisions regarding the status of fishers in these areas [32].
In our current analysis, we sequenced 40 complete mitochondrial genomes from fisher samples throughout their
geographic range in North America, with specific emphasis on the populations of greatest conservation concern

Page 3 of 14

(Rocky Mountains and California; Table 1). These 40 animals represent 10 of the 12 haplotypes previously identified using the D-loop [26]. Our genome-scale analysis
shows that the three subspecies of fishers do not share
haplotypes, and that both Californian populations are
highly distinctive from one another as well as from all
other geographic regions; none of these findings are indicated by the non-coding D-loop region. These results
illustrate the power that whole-genome analyses have in
addressing questions of diversity and divergence at the
population scale and highlight how this information can
be applied to identifying evolutionary significant units to
help guide conservation priorities.

Results
Mitogenomic variation and regional differentiation in
fishers

Range-wide analysis of 40 complete fisher mitogenomes
yielded an aligned data set of 16,290 bp consisting of 13
protein coding genes (11,397 bp), two ribosomal RNA
genes (2,528 bp), 22 transfer RNA genes (1,515 bp), and
the non-coding D-loop (299 bp)(Figure 2). Whole genome analysis revealed 15 haplotypes defined by 66 segregating sites, 19 of which are shared between two or
more haplotypes, and 47 of which are found in single
genomes. These variable sites combine to yield an average pairwise distance of 0.00088 in our sample of 40
genomes; averaged across samples and genomes, this
equates to approximately 14.3 differences between any
two mitogenomes.
Across genomes, the greatest number of nucleotide
polymorphisms are located in protein coding genes (42
SNPs; 0.00369 substitutions per site), followed by the Dloop (10 SNPs; 0.03344 substitutions per site), ribosomal
RNA genes (9 SNPs; 0.00356 substitutions per site) and
transfer RNA genes (2 SNPs; 0.00079 substitutions per
site). The exceptionally high density of variable sites in
the D-loop region - 33.4 substitutions/kb versus 3.69
substitutions/kb for the proteome - combine to reveal
10 unique haplotypes. This value is only marginally
lower than the number of haplotypes revealed across all
protein coding genes (n = 13), even though the proteome includes 38-times more nucleotide positions than
the D-loop region.
Overall, population differentiation in mitochondrial
genomes was significant among the three fisher subspecies, with 27% of the variance apportioned among our
samples (M. p. pennanti, N = 7; M. p. columbiana, N =
21; M. p. pacifica, N = 12; AMOVA, P = 0.001; Table 2).
A detailed examination of pairwise differentiation
between populations within subspecies showed dramatic
differentiation among Californian populations of fishers.
Differentiation among Northern and Southern
Californian fisher populations resulted in a FPT of 0.761

Comparisons between maximum likelihood-based
evolutionary reconstructions using the complete

fisher mitochondrial genome (15 haplotypes;
Figure 3A) and the D-loop (10 haplotypes; Figure
3B) are of particular interest since the D-loop has
previously been used to define matrilineal groups for
fisher conservation (see above; [26]). Complete mitogenome sequence analysis reveals a strongly supported genealogy, with 13 of 14 possible nodes
showing bootstrap support ≥ 85% (Figure 3A); this

contrasts the D-loop resolution, which shows no
nodal support above 85% (Figure 3B).
The genealogical estimate from complete mitochondrial genomes is complex from phylogenetic and

phylogeographic perspectives, as haplotypes from the
three currently designated subspecies of fishers (ssp.
pennanti, ssp. columbiana, ssp. pacifica) show no evidence of monophyly. Similarly, haplotypes from major

Montana; British Columbia; California) do not form discrete lineages, but rather a grade of closely related haplotypes (Figure 3A). The limited phylogenetic
cohesiveness of mitochondrial haplotypes from different
taxonomic and geographic groups appears to reflect the
recency of divergence between the different geographic
races of this widespread species. For example, one fisher

haplotype from ssp. pennanti (MP18, 34 and 35, from
Minnesota and Wisconsin) apparently share a more
recent common ancestor with haplotypes from ssp.
columbiana and ssp. pacifica than they do with other
ssp. pennanti haplotypes (MP19, 20, and 36). Included
in this grade of mitochondrial diversity are two ssp.
columbiana haplotypes, represented by MP14-16 and

represent a fisher lineage that was isolated from other
Rocky Mountain lineages in ice-free refugia during
Pleistocene glaciation [26]. Population level analysis of
D-loop haplotype variation in this geographic region by
Drew et al. [26] shows that “haplotype 7” (our MP4142) and “haplotype 12” (our MP14-16) reach their highest frequency in the Bitterroot Mountains of western
Montana/central Idaho [30], and that they are not
known outside the region.
Our analysis highlights a relevant contradiction
between whole genome analyses and prior analyses based
on D-loop sequences. The most apparent contradiction
involves the identity of the highest frequency D-loop
sequence identified in prior studies, specifically “haplotype 1” [26]. This D-loop haplotype showed a nearly continent-wide distribution, being detected in populations
from the Great Lakes, British Columbia, Montana, Idaho
and California (Figure 3B). Whole mitogenome sequencing shows that this D-loop haplotype actually includes
four distinct, non-sister lineages that sort by subspecies,
and further define two geographic provenances of California (Figure 3A). Distinct haplotypes that were previously hidden within D-loop “haplotype 1” include
MP19/20/36 from M. p. ssp. pennanti in the Great Lakes
region, MP37 from M. p. ssp. columbiana in the Rocky
Mountains of British Columbia, and M. p. ssp. pacifica
from the Sierra (MP1-3/21-24) and the Siskiyou and Klamath (MP7/25) mountain ranges of California.
In evaluating the genetic affinities of Californian fishers, complete mitogenome sequences show much larger
genetic divergence between populations in northern and
southern California than has been predicted from the

D-loop. Whole mitochondrial coding sequences (Figure
3A) reveal three haplotypes exclusive to Californian fishers, one that is geographically restricted to the Sierra
Nevada range (S CA), and two that form a monophyletic
lineage and are restricted to the Siskiyou and Klamath
mountain ranges (N CA). These three haplotypes are
distinctive, showing a minimum of 6 pairwise exonic differences that include several amino acid replacements
(see below). In contrast, genealogical estimates from Dloop data (Figure 3B) identified two Californian haplogroups [26], including the geographically widespread,
genealogically unresolved “haplotype 1” (noted above)
and “haplotype 2” [26], which is equivalent to our
Northern California haplotypes MP7 and MP25
We examined individual nucleotide positions that supported the competing complete mitochondrial genome
and D-loop resolutions, and topological disagreement in
some cases appears to be attributable to recurrent
(homoplasious) mutation in variable nucleotides contained in regions typically included in D-loop genotyping (e.g., tRNA-THR plus the hypervariable region of
the D-loop; table 4). An additional homoplasious mutation was identified in a genic region of the mitochondrial genome (within cox3; table 4). Despite the low
level of mitogenomic divergence observed in our sample
of fishers, recurrent mutations appear to have occurred
in both the D-loop region and coding regions. When
pairwise distance is exceptionally small, as is the case
with Californian fishers, homoplasy in the D-loop region
appears to obscure the identity and genealogical relationships recorded in the complete mitochondrial
genomes.

Figure 5 Estimates of mutation rates and divergence dates
from complete versus partial genomes. Imposing carnivorebased estimates of mutation rates and a log-normal distribution
shows that the modal time to an observed mutation for the
complete fisher mitochondrial genomes is 8,428 years (95% C.I. =
5,004 - 17,364), based on all 3,796 third codon positions in the
mitochondrial genome (brown). This value is significantly lower than
the modal time to an observed mutation for the 379 third codons
of cytochrome b (pink; 84,411 years, 95% C.I. = 50,115-173,914).

Figure 4 Maximum likelihood tree for all coding nucleotides of
the fisher mitochondrial genome. The GTR+Γ model of sequence
evolution was used; numbers above nodes represent bootstrap
support ≥ 85. The branch colored in red indicates a significant
departure from neutral evolution.

Potentially non-neutral variation and the incomplete
record of the D-loop

Conflation of Northern and Southern Californian mitochondrial haplotypes and their phylogenetic affinities by
the D-loop (Figure 3B) is surprising given the abundance of synonymous and non-synonymous genomic
change observed between these haplotypes. Of the 11
variable amino acid positions detected in our sample, 5
amino acid replacements are unique to northern

Californian haplotypes (4 to the single haplotype represented by MP7 and MP25), accounting for a remarkable
42% of the amino acid variation in our sample of 40
individuals across North America. When the proportion
of unique haplotypes for each geographic region are
compared relative to the sample sizes, Californian mitogenomes (ssp. pacifica) show a significantly higher number of replacements than expected (41.7% versus a
grand mean of 18.2%; P = 0.035).
To test whether amino acid replacement rates showed
evidence of non-neutral evolution, we used a codonbased genetic algorithm [33] to test whether the ratio of
non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions
was greater than 1. This method partitions branches of
a tree (in this case, the maximum likelihood topology of
the protein coding portion of the genome, with a GTR
+ Γ substitution model; Figure 4) into groups according
to dN/dS. This analysis identified that a three rate class
model had a significantly better fit than other models
(see Methods). Using this model, the MP7/MP25 haplotype from Northern California was the only terminal
that showed a probability greater than 99% of dN
exceeding dS (Prob{dN > dS} = 0.999; red branch, Figure 4). Since all four substitutions on this terminal
branch result in amino acid replacements, the dN/dS

Knaus et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/10

ratio falls in the highest rate class (0.195, 10,000) but the
dN/dS ratio cannot be defined due to the absence of
synonymous substitutions. This unusual substitution
pattern, reflected in two independent samples (MP7,
MP25), shows a clear departure from neutral evolution.
Evaluation of amino acid changes underscores two
important findings. First, mitogenome sequencing shows
Northern Californian haplotypes to be distinctive from
each other, and from all other fisher haplogroups. At
this point, we can’t determine whether these changes
represent an accumulation of adaptive mutations
through positive selection (as has been suggested for
killer whales; [8]), or the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations through drift in small populations of
asexual genomes [34]. Either way, the pattern of mutation accumulation in this lineage deviates from neutral
expectations relative to our sample of haplotypes taken
across North America. Irrespective of their selective
relevance, these amino acid changes are uncorrelated
with change in the D-loop region of the genome.
Impact of whole genome sequencing on the precision
and timing of fisher matrilineage divergence

Our complete mitogenomes provide an opportunity to
examine how whole genome sequencing might impact
the accuracy of dating haplotype divergence events in
closely related lineages. The use of complete mitogenomes significantly increases the precision of divergence
estimates, primarily due to the increase in the number
of available synonymous sites. Given the distribution of
carnivore mutation rates [35] and calibrations based on
cytochrome b (379 third codon positions), one synonymous substitution is expected in ~84 ky (50-174 ky;
Figure 5). In contrast, calibrations based on the fisher
mitogenome (3,799 third codon positions) instead show
an expectation of one synonymous substitution every
8.4 ky (5.0 - 17.4 ky). This suggests that significant
improvements in divergence date accuracy (the point
estimate) and precision (decreased variance) can be
obtained by simply sequencing whole organelle
genomes.
This improvement in precision will be of great relevance to species showing low genetic variation and
divergence, such as North American fishers. For example, haplotypes from Californian and Rocky Mountain
fishers show exceedingly low pairwise divergence, averaging 1.8 synonymous substitutions per genome from
their recent common ancestor (Figure 4). In light of carnivore mutation rates, these synonymous distances suggest that the most recent common mitochondrial
ancestor for Northern California, Southern California,
and the majority of Rocky Mountain haplotypes date to
approximately 16.7 kya (9.0 - 31.3 kya). The accurate
estimation of such dates clearly requires confirmation

Page 10 of 14

with fossils appropriate to fishers; nevertheless, this
exercise shows that whole genome sequencing offers
clear advantages versus partial genome sequencing with
regard to the precision of recent divergence time estimates, and the ultimate perspectives they provide on the
timing and origins of unique populations.

Discussion
Our analysis highlights a relevant contradiction between
whole genome analyses and prior analyses based on Dloop sequences from western fishers. Genealogical inferences based on mitochondrial D-loop variation are in
conflict with the remainder of the mitogenome, and Dloop sequences underestimate the distinctiveness of the
populations of greatest conservation concern due to the
accumulation of independent, recurrent mutations.
Results from fishers show that the mutation rate at sites
within and proximal to the D-loop is sufficiently high
that recurrent mutations have accumulated in a short
time span; the impact of this mutational noise on genotypic identities and genealogical patterns is most pronounced in groups showing low divergence. This leads
us to suggest that the fisher populations of greatest conservation concern are at the greatest risk of D-loop misidentification. This trend is unlikely to be limited to
fishers, as low intraspecific mitochondrial divergence is
widely reported in conservation genetic studies.
From a management perspective, these data are timely
as fishers in California and the Rocky Mountains have
been recently considered or are currently being considered for listing under the Endangered Species Act
[26,32,36]. Our results confirm previous work that identifies some haplotypes from the Bitterroot Mountains of
western Montana and central Idaho (e.g., MP 41-42;
MP14-16) as unique relative to other known haplotypes
in the U.S. Northern Rockies, British Columbia, and
eastern North America. These unique mitogenomes are
unlikely to represent outside reintroductions from other
locations in North America, and may instead represent
native haplotypes from populations that avoided early
20 th century extinction by persisting in Bitterroot
Mountain refugia [26,30]. While additional sampling of
historical and contemporary specimens will be needed
to further validate this hypothesis, this haplotype group
achieves its highest frequency in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana and Idaho (Figure 3; [30]), and it is
highly divergent from other Rocky Mountain fisher haplotypes. As such, these populations may warrant protection as a “distinct population segment” under the
Endangered Species Act.
In California, conservation questions center around
the historical versus contemporary distribution of fishers. Currently, there is a 430 km gap [31,37] between
populations in Northern (the Siskiyou and Klamath

Knaus et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/10

ranges) and Southern (Lake Tahoe) California. Some
have argued that historical fisher distributions were
more or less continuous across montane regions of California, and that their current isolated distribution
reflects range constriction due to anthropogenic pressure; this perspective is used to argue for reintroduction
efforts that “fill the gap” between these distant geographic provenances [38]. Others have argued that fisher
distributions were historically discontinuous, that migratory barriers existed prior to European settlement, and
that these barriers should be preserved in contemporary
fisher management plans. Key points in this argument
are studies that identify fishers as a habitat specialist in
the western United States, preferring low- to mid-elevation forests with diverse structure [39,40], and the
absence of high-quality habitat between these populations [40].
Initial mitochondrial D-loop haplotype data by Drew
et al. [26] reported a shared haplotype between Southern and Northern Californian populations, and this finding was used as evidence to argue for recent historical
connectivity between these geographic provenances.
This information was later contradicted by nuclear
microsatellite DNA results from Wisely et al. [29],
which showed large genetic divergence between Southern and Northern Californian fishers. Our results from
whole mitochondrial genotyping support the findings of
Wisely et al. [29] by showing high genetic divergence
between Southern and Northern California fishers. Most
critically, our results show that the inferences reached
by Drew et al. [26] appear erroneous and are likely attributable to the unusual mutational properties of the Dloop that create (and re-create) a haplotype that mimics
others ("haplotype 1”) that are common across North
America.
Our analysis identifies that Northern Californian haplotypes form sister lineages, and these are genealogically
distinct from southern Sierra Nevada fishers. Using estimates of pairwise divergence and the synonymous mutation rate in carnivores ([26]; Figure 4), we hypothesize
that the haplotypes representative of northern and
southern California fishers could have diverged ~16.7
kya. This value, while based on a strict molecular clock,
is consistent with previous microsatellite data [29], as
well as paleontological evidence that places the earliest
record of fishers in the Pacific west at < 5000 years ago
[41]. If these calibrations are correct, recommendations
to restore connectivity between these populations would
be inconsistent with historical records [37], habitat models [40], and now contemporary molecular data.
An outstanding question in our analysis is whether
contemporary fisher distributions in populations of concern primarily reflect isolation due to natural range contraction associated with the end of the Pleistocene

Page 11 of 14

(~10,000 ya), or disturbance associated with western settlement or 20 th century land management practices.
Absolute divergence date estimation from molecular
data at these time scales is non-trivial, as it requires precise calibration at the root of the tree (and ideally at
nodes of interest) with DNA derived from sub-fossil tissues, or mutation rates calibrated to specific lineages
with high quality fossils of known genealogical placement [5,42]. There is also an element of time-dependency in the use of these rates, as the average mutation
rate over long evolutionary time is often significantly
lower than the rate calculated from sub-fossils [5] and
pedigrees [43]. Under the best circumstances, absolute
divergence date estimates derived from mutation rate
assumptions contain substantial and undefined error, so
the dates they produce can be of unknown value when
evaluating very recent divergence estimates.
Irrespective of these issues, our results show that
divergence date estimates (absolute or relative) for subgenomic partitions on the order of 1/10 the size of the
mitochondrial genome are highly inaccurate, and can
have 95% confidence intervals measured in hundreds of
thousands of years (Figure 5). The implication is that
date estimates derived from small portions of mitochondrial sequence (e.g., D-loop or portions of coding genes
like cytB) include substantial error. Improvements in the
precision of estimates of genetic and relative divergence
can clearly be made with whole genome sequencing,
and this improved precision will be most valuable in
populations showing low genetic variation and divergence, such as western fishers. It should be noted that
while accurate absolute divergence dates in fishers are
unlikely to be derived from distant fossil calibrations
[41,44,45], late Pleistocene fisher fossils exist [41,44,45]
and could be used to provide a resolution of fisher
divergence dates. The growing field of paleogenomics
provides striking examples of how such materials can be
used to provide direct genomic information for internal
calibration estimates [5].
Finally, our analysis shows that conservation genetic
studies based on one or few mitochondrial gene fragments (such as those from fishers) may have sufficient
power to identify ancient divergence events (e.g., Pleistocene or older), but they are certain to lack the accuracy
and precision needed to confidently resolve population
divergence events in the Holocene. This point has been
made by others [2,5], but it is particularly relevant in
the analysis of threatened, endangered, or sensitive species like fishers, where the motivating forces behind
contemporary population parameters (isolation; migration; population trends) are of keen interest to conservation managers.
Our findings reinforce the need for caution when conservation and management decisions are based on small

Conclusions
○ Californian fisher populations in distinct geographic areas are represented by haplotypes that are
genetically distinct from one another and from all
other fisher groups. This finding is not reflected in
previous research based on a small portion of the
mitochondrial D-loop.
○ California populations of fisher contain at least
three genetically distinct maternal lineages, and their
divergence likely predates modern land management
practices. One population contains a significant
amount of non-neutral variation; this could be indicative of adaptive divergence or the accumulation of
deleterious mutations due to small population
processes.
○ Fishers in Idaho and Montana possess diverse
mitogenomic lineages. One major lineage is similar
to haplotypes common in British Columbia, while
other lineages represented by MP14, MP41 represent
a highly divergent, geographically restricted
haplogroup.
○ These findings are broadly relevant to wildlife
management, since our study shows that populations
of greatest conservation concern (those showing the
least genetic divergence) are at the greatest risk of
being misidentified by D-loop genotyping.

98°C, followed by 30 cycles of 8 s at 98°C, 30 s at 59°C,
and 2 min at 72°C.
Purified amplicons were pooled by individual in equimolar ratios and prepared for Illumina single-end
sequencing using barcoded adapters [25]. Mitogenome
pools (10 - 12 per pool) were sequenced on one lane
each on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II using 40 bp
microreads. Individual genomes were represented by an
average of 315,000 microreads (minimum = 43,090),
which is equivalent to an average of 11,340 kb of
sequence per mitochondrial genome, and an average
sequencing depth of 300 reads per nucleotide. The original short read sequence data is available under study
number ERP000590 from the European Nucleotide
Archive of the European Bioinformatics Institute http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP000590.
Genomes were assembled using de novo and reference
guided methods. A custom Perl script was used to sort
and remove barcodes from Illumina ‘qseq’ files. Initial
genome scaffolds were built using de novo assemblies
(Velvet 0.7.45, [46]). BLAT 32 × 1 [47] was used to
order de novo contigs onto the Martes melampus mitochondrial genome. Several rounds of reference guided
assembly (RGA_blat_SNP_Q_rc4, [48]) were performed
to determine whether the reference was divergent across
mapped microreads, and the reference was updated after
every round of assembly. Reference-guided assembly was
performed until no polymorphism was detected between
the reference and the microreads. MAQ [49] and BioEdit [50] were used to visualize assemblies and locate
indels.

Methods

Data analysis

Genome isolation, sequencing and assembly

Statistical analyses of DNA sequences primarily used
custom R scripts [51]. Sequences and trees were
manipulated using the R packages ‘ape’ [52], ‘seqinr’
[53], ‘pegas’ [54] and custom scripts. Maximum likelihood trees were generated using RAxML [55] at the
CIPRES portal [56] and rooted with one individual from
the Great Lakes that was identified as sister to our sample specimens based on phylogenies built using Gulo
gulo (NC_009685.1), Meles meles (NC_011125.1), Martes
flavigulata
(NC_012141),
Martes
melampus
(NC_009678) and Martes zibellina (NC_011579) as outgroups (not shown). In order to facilitate comparison,

samples of the mitochondrial genome. They also raise
the possibility that the incongruence between inferences
from mtDNA and nuclear data sets may be at least
partly attributable to the unique mutational properties
of the D-loop. The ability to generate genome-scale
datasets affordably means that this solution to fine-scale
genealogical problems is available for conservation applications [8,23]. Wildlife managers will benefit from the
more complete genomic perspectives offered by
advances in genomics technologies, as population-level
genetic variation has the potential to be partitioned into
categories of neutral variation, putatively adaptive variation, and potentially misleading variation.

We analyzed mtDNA from 40 fisher tissue samples collected from throughout their North American range.
Total DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit
(QIAGEN Incorporated, Hilder, Germany). Complete
mitochondrial genomes were amplified in three overlapping segments using primers designed from the consensus sequence of four mustelid mitochondrial genomes
(Japanese marten, Martes malampus, NC009678; Japanese badger, Meles meles anakuma, NC009677; red
panda, Ailurus fulgens, NC009691; sea otter, Enhydra
lutris, NC009692). Primers include: mtI-F 5’-

the D-loop was defined by the aligned sequences of
Drew et al. [26] as downloaded from GenBank (299 bp).
This includes a portion of tRNA-proline but was
included as a representative of a D-loop amplicon as utilized in the literature. To explore how the amount of
data affects statistical power of inference of divergence
dates, we used estimates of species neutral evolution
rate based on third codon substitutions of cytochrome b
for 131 carnivore species [35]. Data were rescaled to
reflect years until a mutation could be expected. Lognormal curves were fit to the data in R and summary
statistics were derived from fitted distributions. A point
estimate was made from the mode, and a 95% confidence interval was constructed from the 0.025 and 0.975
quantiles.
Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA;[57]) was
performed on DNA sequences from the three subspecies
and 6 geographic populations to explore the distribution
of genetic variability. For this analysis, a pairwise
nucleotide distance matrix for all haplotypes was computed with MEGA4 [58], using the Kimura 2-parameter
correction for multiple substitutions. This distance
matrix was used as the input for AMOVA using GenAlEx ver. 6.41 [59]. In this analysis, a significant effect of
subspecies (F RT ), or populations within subspecies
(FPR), would indicate that significant genetic structure
existed at that level. FPT (an Fst analogue for mitochondrial DNA;[57]) was used to analyze the degree of structuring among populations globally and in pairwise
comparisons. Significance of the variance components
was evaluated using non-parametric permutation tests
with 10,000 iterations.
To test whether amino acid replacement rates were
identical across genomes and lineages, we used the
codon-based genetic algorithm [33] to test whether the
ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions were greater than 1. This method partitions
branches of a specified tree into groups according to
dN/dS. This analysis identified that a three rate class
model (c-AIC = 30476.6; dN/dS classes = 0.000, 0.195,
10,000) had a significantly better fit than single-rate (cAIC = 30457.9; dN/dS = 0.177), two-rate (c-AIC =
30433.1; dN/dS classes = 0.059, 10000), or four-rate (cAIC = 30428.1; dN/dS classes = 0.000, 0.163, 0.488,
10000) class models.
