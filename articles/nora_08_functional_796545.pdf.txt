Abstract
Background: Numerous studies have shown that viral quasi-species with genetically diverse
envelope proteins (Env) replicate simultaneously in patients infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Less information is available concerning the extent that
envelope sequence diversity translates into a diversity of phenotypic properties, including infectivity
and resistance to entry inhibitors.
Methods: To study these questions, we isolated genetically distinct contemporaneous clonal viral
populations from the plasma of 5 HIV-1 infected individuals (n = 70), and evaluated the infectivity
of recombinant viruses expressing Env proteins from the clonal viruses in several target cells. The
sensitivity to entry inhibitors (enfuvirtide, TAK-799), soluble CD4 and monoclonal antibodies
(2G12, 48d, 2F5) was also evaluated for a subset of the recombinant viruses (n = 20).
Results: Even when comparisons were restricted to viruses with similar tropism, the infectivity
for a given target cell of viruses carrying different Env proteins from the same patient varied over
an approximately 10-fold range, and differences in their relative ability to infect different target cells
were also observed. Variable region haplotypes associated with high and low infectivity could be
identified for one patient. In addition, clones carrying unique mutations in V3 often displayed low
infectivity. No correlation was observed between viral infectivity and sensitivity to inhibition by any
of the six entry inhibitors evaluated, indicating that these properties can be dissociated. Significant
inter-patient differences, independent of infectivity, were observed for the sensitivity of Env
proteins to several entry inhibitors and their ability to infect different target cells.
Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the marked functional heterogeneity of HIV-1 Env
proteins expressed by contemporaneous circulating viruses, and underscore the advantage of
clonal analyses in characterizing the spectrum of functional properties of the genetically diverse
viral populations present in a given patient.

Background
The population of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) present in a single infected patient at any given
time can show remarkable diversity. Moreover, the extent of
diversity can evolve over time and is different in different
genes. The most striking changes in diversity occur in the
envelope glycoproteins (Env). The initial transmission of
HIV-1 can result in infection of the new host with multiple
viruses expressing genetically diverse env sequences [1-6].
Early in the evolution of infection, however, viruses expressing extremely homeogeneous env sequences become dominant, presumably reflecting the selection of viruses that are
best adapted for replication in available target cells, and/or
resistant to the nascent host immune response [1-3,7]. This
initial homogenization is followed by a period often lasting
many years, in which both the diversity of the env sequences
and the evolutionary distance from the initially dominant
strain increase linearly by approximately 1% per year [5,817]. Subsequently, the extent of viral diversity begins to plateau and, in the late stages of disease, a decline in viral diversity can be observed [8,11,12,18].
Although genetic diversity of the viral env has been extensively studied, less information is available concerning the
extent that these genetically diverse Env proteins also display functional diversity. Envelope sequences have been
amplified from plasma or short-term cell cultures and used
to produce recombinant or pseudotyped viruses expressing
primary env sequences [19-25]. Most studies have found
that only 40–70% of such viruses are infectious, but quantitative assessment of the replicative capacity of a large
number of viruses expressing different envelope sequences
from a single patient has not been reported.
It also remains unclear the extent to which other properties of the viral Env proteins are shared by coexisting
quasi-species from a given patient. Viral isolates obtained
from different individuals can differ in their sensitivity to
inhibition by chemokines [26-30], entry inhibitors [3137], certain monoclonal antibodies [32,38], and autologous serum [26,39], but the extent that different viruses
obtained from the same individual show similar sensitivity to a given entry inhibitor has not been extensively evaluated. Furthermore, replicative capacity, per se, can
influence the sensitivity of viruses to inhibitors of entry
[26,31,36,40], but it remains unknown whether or not
the sensitivity of viruses from a given patient to entry
inhibitors correlates closely with replicative capacity.
We have recently described an approach that allows the
direct isolation of contemporaneous clonal viruses from
the plasma of infected individuals, including viruses capable of using CCR5 and/or CXCR4 viral coreceptors
[41,42]. These viruses are potentially useful for the evaluation of the functional correlates of env genetic diversity.

First, each clonal virus emerges independently, and therefore viruses with low infectivity are not lost through competition with rapidly replicating viruses. Furthermore, the
env sequences expressed by these viruses are genetically
diverse, and the functional properties have not been modified by through mutation or recombination occurring
during PCR. In this study, we have created recombinant
viruses expressing Env proteins from these clonal viruses
in a reporter construct expressing luciferase activity, and
evaluated: i) the spectrum of infectivity observed for Env
proteins expressed by contemporaneous viral clones from
the same patient, ii) the ability of these viruses to infect
different target cells, and, iii) the relationship between
infectivity and the susceptibility of the Env proteins to several different entry inhibitors.

The nucleotide diversity of env sequences extending from
V1 to the middle of V4, calculated by the method of
Tajima-Nei, ranged from 0.018 – 0.060, values typical of
those obtained for sequences amplified from plasma by
RT-PCR. The greatest diversity was observed for patient 3,
despite that all viruses from this patient showed strict R5
tropism.
Infectivity of recombinant viruses carrying primary
envelope sequences in U373-R5 and U373-X4 target cells
To explore the functional capacities of Env proteins
expressed by these clonal viruses, we generated recombinant reporter viruses in which the env sequence (gp120 +
the extracellular domain of gp41) was derived from the different clonal viruses, and evaluated the ability of these luciferase-expressing viruses to infect U373 cells stably
expressing CD4 and either CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptors.
All of the 70 recombinant viruses were infectious (Fig. 2).
Viruses with strict R5 tropism were identified in all patients
(n = 53), but clones with R5X4 tropism (n = 5) and/or strict
X4 tropism (n = 12) were also identified in 4 of the 5
patients studied. The infectivity of dual-tropic viruses
tended to be similar in the U373-R5 and U373-X4 target
cells (compare gray symbols in Figs. 2A and 2B). Without
exception, the infectivity of clones with R5 tropism was at
least 5-fold lower than the infectivity of recombinant
viruses carrying the Env from the laboratory-adapted strain
NL-AD8 [mean infectivity in U373-R5 cells: 22524 (RLU/
sec)/(ng p24/ml)]. The infectivity of some clones with X4
tropism was equivalent to that observed for recombinant
viruses carrying the Env from pNL4-3 [mean infectivity in
U373-X4 cells: 2650 (RLU/sec)/(ng p24/ml)].

Considerable variability was observed in the infectivity of
viruses carrying different env sequences from the same
patient. When U373-R5 cells were used as targets, the difference in infectivity between the most and least infectious viruses from each of the 5 patients averaged 1.0 ±
0.26 log10 (range 0.8 – 1.3 log10 difference). Some interpatient variability in infectivity was also observed. When
considered as a group, no significant differences in the
infectivity of clones carrying Env proteins from patients

were isolated from 4 patients. For patients 1 and 2, sequences
for viruses with R5 tropism appeared to be phylogenetically
distinct from those of viruses with X4 (patient 2) or dual
(patient 1) tropism, and the sequence diversity among
viruses with similar tropism was lower than that of the entire
viral population. In contrast, for patients 4 and 5, envelope
sequences in the V1-V2 region for viruses with R5 tropism
were not segregated from those of viruses with X4 (patient 4)
or dual (patient 5) tropism. For patient 2, the consensus env
sequence for plasma viruses clustered with the sequences of
viruses with X4 tropism at month 26, but clustered with the
sequences of viruses with R5 tropism at month 34.

Infectivity and co-receptor usage of envelope proteins expressed by clonal viruses. Recombinant reporter
viruses were generated in which the env sequence (gp120 +
the extracellular domain of gp41) was derived from clonal
viruses isolated from plasma of patients chronically infected
with HIV-1. The ability of these viruses, which express Renilla
luciferase in the place of Nef, to infect U373 cells stably
expressing CD4 and either CCR5 (panel A) or CXCR4
(panel B) co-receptors was measured by evaluating luciferase
expression in target cells 44 hours after infection. For patient
2, clonal viruses were obtained from plasma samples
obtained 8 months apart (26 and 34 months after initial diagnosis). The ability of all recombinant viruses to infect the two
cell types was evaluated, but results are shown only for
viruses that induced significant luciferase activity in the indicated target cell type [>2 (RLU/sec)/(ng p24/ml)]. Viruses
could be classified as having strict R5 tropism (open symbols)
strict X4 tropism (solid black symbols) and dual tropism
(sold gray symbols). Results for viruses expressing env
sequences amplified by RT-PCR from patient plasma is also
shown (stars). Each symbol is the mean of at least 3 independent experiments; the mean coefficient of variation for
these results is as follows: U373-R5 cells, 42% (range 3 –
83%); U373-X4 cells, 50% (range 10 – 78%). For each patient,
significant differences were found comparing the viruses with
the highest and lowest infectivity (p < 0.05 – 0.001 by t-test).

of these patients was significantly greater than that of
clones from patient 5 (p < 0.05 for all comparisons).

Impact of the intracellular portion of gp41 on viral
infectivity
The intracellular portion of gp41 is known to interact with
Gag. To avoid potential incompatibilities between these
viral proteins [43,44], we initially evaluated the infectivity
of recombinant viruses in which both the intracellular portion of gp41 and Gag were derived from the pNL4-3 viral
strain. Changes in the intracellular domain of gp41, however, have also been reported to influence Env function [4548], and it was important to evaluate the possibility that
incompatibilities between the extracellular domains of Env
in some of the viruses and the intracellular domain of gp41
from pNL4-3 contributed to the wide range of infectivities
observed. To do so, we compared the infectivity of selected
recombinant viruses in which the intracellular domain of
gp41 was derived either from pNL4-3 or from the primary
viral isolate. As shown in Fig. 3, the infectivities of the two

The effect of the origin of the intracellular portion of
gp41 on infectivity. For selected clonal viruses isolated from
patient 3 (inverted triangles), patient 4 (triangles), patient 5
(squares) or from the laboratory-adapted strain NL-AD8 (diamond), two types of recombinant reporter viruses were generated, one in which gp120 + only the extracellular domain of
gp41 was derived from the clonal virus (pNL4-3-ΔectoENVlucR, abscissa), and one in which gp120 and all of gp41 was
derived from the clonal virus (pNL4-3-ΔENV-lucR vector,
ordinate). The ability of these viruses to infect U373-R5 cells
was compared by evaluating luciferase expression in the target
cells 44 hours after infection. The infectivity of each pair of
viruses was evaluated in three independent experiments, and
each symbol represents the mean of these determinations.
The dotted line is the line of identity. The correlation coefficient (Spearman) for the data shown is 0.86 (p < 0.0001).

constructs were strongly correlated (Spearman r = 0.86; p <
0.0001). Viruses that demonstrated relatively poor infectivity when the intracellular domain of gp41 was derived from
pNL4-3 did not show improved infectivity when the
homologous intracellular domain of gp41 was used (e.g.,
the viruses with Env from patient 5 and the least infectious
virus from patient 4). Indeed, the use of the homologous
intracellular domain of gp41 led to a moderate loss in
infectivity for the viruses from patient 4 and some viruses
from patient 5, consistent with the possibility that incompatibilities existed in these cases between the gp41
sequences and the gag protein from pNL4-3.
Infectivity of recombinant viruses carrying primary
envelope sequences in MT4-R5 cells
For all 70 recombinant viruses, the amount of luciferase
activity resulting from infection of U373 cells was greater
than that seen after infection of MT4-R5 cells. For each
patient, a significant correlation was observed between
the infectivity of viruses with R5-exclusive tropism for
U373-R5 and MT4-R5 target cells (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). As was observed when U373 cells were used as
targets, viruses carrying different env sequences from the
same patient showed considerable variability in infectivity when MT4-R5 cells were infected (Fig. 4A). The difference in infectivity between the most and least infectious
R5 viruses from each of the 5 patients averaged 1.2 ± 0.31
log10 (range 0.8 – 1.5 log10 difference). As indicated
above, the infectivity of viruses from patient 5 were strikingly lower than that of viruses from other patients when
U373-R5 cells were used as targets. This difference was
less striking when MT4-R5 cells were infected (compare
Figs. 2A and 4A), although the infectivity of R5 viruses
from patient 5 remained significantly lower than that of
R5 viruses from patients 2 and 3 (p < 0.05 for both comparisons).

Interestingly, considerable variability was observed when
luciferase activity obtained following infection of the two
cell types was expressed as a ratio (Fig. 4B). This ratio did
not correlate with the infectivity of the viruses for U373
cells (Spearman r = 0.10, p = 0.49), but only viruses with
relatively low infectivity for MT4-R5 cells [i.e., <110 (RLU/
sec)/(ng p24/ml)] had values for this ratio that were
greater than 20 (Fig. 5). The level of expression of both
CD4 and CCR5 was approximately two-fold higher on
U373-R5 cells than on MT4-R5 cells (Fig. 6). Thus, a possible explanation for these observations is that the infectivity of viruses for which a high ratio was observed are
particularly sensitive to the levels of expression of CD4
and/or co-receptor, although other differences between
U373-R5 cells and MT4-R5 cells may also influence the
ability of viruses carrying different envelopes to infect
these cell types.

(26 and 34 months after initial diagnosis). The tropism of the

Results for viruses expressing env sequences amplified by RTPCR from patient plasma is also shown (stars). Each symbol

It is noteworthy that the proportion of viruses with a relatively high infectivity ratio was different in different
patients. The infectivity ratios of clones from patients 1, 3
and 4 were significantly greater than that of patient 2 (p <

expression in the target cells 44 hours after infection. For
each of the 53 viruses with strict R5 tropism, the infectivity
ratio (infectivity for U373-R5 cells/infectivity for MT4-R5
cells) is expressed as a function of the infectivity for MT4-R5
cells [(RLU/sec)/(ng p24/ml)]. A significant inverse correlation between these parameters was observed (Spearman r =
-0.64, p < 0.0001).

Infectivity of recombinant viruses carrying envelope
sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR
In parallel with studies evaluating the infectivity of recombinant viruses carrying env sequences derived from clonal
viruses, we evaluated the infectivity of recombinant
viruses expressing env sequences amplified by RT-PCR
from viral RNA extracted from the same plasma specimen
from which the clonal viruses had been derived. The infectivity of viruses carrying plasma-derived env sequences for
U373-R5 cells, although detectable in all cases except
patient 2, was generally low, and was less than that of the
clonal viruses from the same patient, usually by a substantial margin (Fig. 2A). The infectivity of viruses expressing
plasma-derived env sequences for U373-X4 cells was
detectable in only two samples (Fig. 2B). In both of these
cases (patient 2, M26 and patient 4), clonal viruses with
X4 exclusive tropism had been identified. The failure to
detect infectivity of viruses carrying plasma-derived env
sequences in other samples from which clonal viruses
with strict X4 or dual tropism were identified may reflect
the somewhat lower infectivity of the viruses with X4 tropism (e.g., patient 2, M34 and patient 5) and/or a lower
proportion of viruses with X4 tropism in the sample (e.g.,
patient 1). As was observed for viruses carrying env

sequences derived from clonal viruses, the infectivity of
viruses carrying plasma-derived env sequences for MT4-R5
cells was usually reduced compared to that observed for
U373 cells (Fig. 4A). Indeed, for patients 1 and 5, low
level infectivity was detected toward U373-R5 cells, but
infectivity was below detection when MT4-R5 cells were
targeted.

Sensitivity of recombinant viruses carrying primary
envelope sequences to entry inhibitors
Because the infectivity of clonal viruses carrying different
env sequences from a given patient varied over a wide
range, these viruses were useful in exploring the possible
relationship between infectivity and sensitivity to inhibition by entry inhibitors. To do so, clonal viruses with R5tropism that exhibited a spectrum of infectivities towards
U373-R5 cells and/or MT4-R5 cells were selected from 4
of the patients (Figs. 7A and 7B). For each of these 20
viruses, the IC50s were determined on U373-R5 target
cells for two entry inhibitors (enfuvirtide and TAK-799),
soluble CD4, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
recognizing either gp120 (2G12, 48d) or gp41 (2F5). No
significant correlations were observed between the IC50s
of these six inhibitors and the infectivity of the clonal
viruses for either U373-R5 cells or MT4-R5 cells (data not
shown, p > 0.09 for all Spearman correlations).

Viruses from different patients did, however, demonstrate
differential sensitivity to these entry inhibitors, independent of infectivity (Fig. 7). Thus, significant differences in
the median sensitivity to entry inhibitors by clonal viruses
from different patients was observed by ANOVA for all
entry inhibitors except TAK-799 (p values for KruskalWallis test: p < 0.001 – 0.05), and for each of these inhibitors, significant differences in were also identified in pairwise comparisons of IC50s for viruses from different
patients (Fig. 7).
Genotype-phenotype correlations
Nucleotide sequences for env extending from the signal
peptide to mid C4 region were available for all clones. The
PSSM score developed by Jensen et al. [49] correctly distinguished all clones with R5-exclusive tropism and X4exclusive tropism, even though viruses from two of the
patients were non-B subtypes. Three of the 6 Env proteins
with dual tropism, however, were predicted to exhibit R5exclusive tropism (one clone each from patients 1, 2 and
5). The amino acid sequence of the V3 region of these
dual-tropic clones from patients 1 and 2 differed at 6 and
1 positions, respectively, compared to that of the most
similar R5-tropic Env identified in that patient, and these
differences may explain the change in tropism. The V3
region of the misidentified dual-tropic envelope sequence
from patient 5, however, was identical to that of other Env

Sensitivity of recombinant viruses carrying primary envelope sequences to entry inhibitors
Figure 7
Sensitivity of recombinant viruses carrying primary envelope sequences to entry inhibitors. Clonal viruses with
R5-tropism exhibiting a spectrum of infectivities towards U373-R5 cells (panel A) and/or MT4-R5 cells (panel B) were selected
from among those obtained from patients 1–4. For each of these 20 viruses, the IC50s were determined on U373-R5 cells for
soluble CD4 (C), enfuvirtide (E), TAK-799 (G), and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 2F5 (D), 2G12 (F), and 48d (H). Each
symbol represents the mean of three independent determinations. For all inhibitors except TAK-799, significant patient-specific differences in IC50 were observed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Brackets indicate significant pairwise differences in posttest comparisons performed using Dunn's multiple comparison test (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01). For patient 2, clonal viruses were
obtained from plasma samples obtained at both 26 months (solid symbols) and 34 months (open symbols) after initial diagnosis.

with R5-exclusive tropism, indicating that sequences outside V3 influenced the tropism of this Env.
In general, viruses with strict R5-tropism from the same
individual expressed a relatively small number of haplotypes within a given variable (V) region. For example, the
number of distinct haplotypes identified for the V3 region
ranged from 1 (patient 1) to 4 (patient 2). Significant differences in the infectivity of R5-tropic viruses as a function
of haplotype were observed for the variable regions 2 and
3 (V2 and V3) of patient 2 (p < 0.02 and p < 0.03 respectively using the Kruskal-Wallis test). As shown in Fig. 8,
the viruses from this patient expressing V3 region haplotypes 2 and 3 were significantly less infectious than those
expressing haplotype 1 (p < 0.01 using the Mann-Whitney
test), and viruses expressing the V2 region haplotype 4
were less infectious than those expressing the V2 region
haplotypes 1 – 3 (p < 0.001). Most of the viruses expressing the V2 haplotype associated with low infectivity (haplotype 4) also expressed V3 haplotypes associated with
low infectivity. However, one of the viruses expressed this
V2 haplotype in association with the V3 haplotype 1,
which was usually associated with good infectivity (red
arrow in Fig. 8A). The infectivity of this virus was, nevertheless, low (red arrow in Fig. 8B), suggesting that expression of the V2 haplotype 4 was a major determinant for
low infectivity in this patient. It is noteworthy that clones
from patient 2 expressing the V2 haplotype 4 were
obtained only from the plasma sample obtained at month
34, and 9/13 clones with R5-tropism isolated at this time
point expressed this V2 haplotype.
No significant associations between infectivity and haplotype were observed for the variable regions expressed by
the other patients, and no association between infectivity
and the haplotypes in the constant regions were identified. One factor that could confound such analyses is the
presence of deleterious mutations elsewhere in the envelope sequence. In this regard, we found that four of the 53
viruses with strict R5 tropism had V3 sequences containing a single amino acid polymorphism not seen in any
other sequence from that patient. The recombinant
viruses carrying 3 of these unique V3 polymorphisms had
the lowest infectivity for U373-R5 cells of any virus evaluated from that sample.

Discussion
In this study we have explored the functional properties of
Env proteins from contemporaneous HIV-1 biological
clones isolated from the plasma of chronically infected
patients. Even when comparisons were restricted to
viruses with similar tropism, these genetically diverse Env
proteins were found to exhibit striking functional diversity, including, i) a wide range of infectivities for a given
target cell, ii) differences in relative ability to infect differ-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/23

ent target cells, and iii) differences in sensitivity to certain
entry inhibitors. In addition to the functional diversity
observed among viruses from a single patient, significant
inter-patient differences were also observed for some characteristics of Env proteins, including sensitivity to several
different entry inhibitors and the relative ability of viruses
to infect different target cells. Interestingly, no correlation
was observed between viral infectivity and sensitivity to
entry inhibitors, indicating that these properties are, to
some extent, dissociable. These findings demonstrate the
marked functional heterogeneity of HIV-1 Env proteins
expressed by contemporaneous circulating viruses, and
underscore the advantage of clonal analyses in characterizing such viral populations.
The observation that Env proteins expressed by contemporaneous viruses display a broad spectrum of infectivity
towards a given target cell raises the question of the forces
responsible for this functional diversity. One factor that
can drive the development of diversity is the selection in a
single patient of numerous viral subpopulations with distinct Env functional properties. Genetically distinct viral
populations replicating in different tissues or cellular
compartments have been identified in numerous studies
[50-54]. Such populations can also result in functional
diversity, as illustrated by the obvious example of the
coexistence of viruses with different tropism. Indeed, we
found that the coexistence of viruses with R5 and X4 tropism could make an important contribution to overall
genetic diversity in patients from whom both populations
were isolated.
The high mutation and recombination rates of HIV-1 are
also likely to have an important impact on infectivity.
Because of the numerous structural constraints in viral
proteins, including Env, many mutations will prove to be
deleterious for fitness. Similarly, recombination events
that shuffle env segments can modify the function of Env
proteins [55,56]. Indeed, genetic evidence supports the
idea that purifying selection against deleterious mutations
is occurring in the env region [57]. In this regard, we
observed that 3 of 4 viruses in which V3 sequences contained a single amino acid polymorphism not seen in any
other sequence from that patient had low infectivity. The
association of such rare polymorphisms with poor infectivity is consistent with the possibility that the deleterious
mutations contribute to the wide spectrum infectivity
observed in these studies, although further studies are
required to directly demonstrate the impact of such specific genetic differences on viral infectivity.
The extent that genetic differences deleterious for viral
replication accumulate because they are associated with
escape from immune responses is also an important issue.
In this regard, we observed that a V2 haplotype associated

Expression of V2 and V3 region haplotypes in Env proteins of clonal viruses from patient 2 and viral infectivity.
(A) The haplotypes in the V2 region (left) and V3 region (right) of the Env proteins expressed by the 17 clonal viruses from
patient 2 with strict R5 tropism are shown. The consensus amino sequence is shown on the top line, and only amio acids differing from the consensus sequence are shown for each clone. For each variable region, sequences that are identical or that differ by a single amino acid substitution not identified in another sequence are highlighted by the same color, and these
haplotypes are also identifed by numbers adjacent to the brackets. The red arrow indicates the envelope expressing the V2
region haplotype 4 associated with the V3 region haplotype 1 (see text). (B) The infectivity of recombinant viruses expressing
these Env proteins using U373-R5 cells is shown. For each of the variable regions, the color of the symbols corresponds to that

with reduced viral infectivity emerged in patient 2 over an
8 month interval, and had become the dominant haplotype. This haplotype differed by a single amino acid
change from another haplotype observed in this individual (Fig. 8). Such a modification would be typical of
escape from neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T-cells
targeting this epitope, although other explanations are
also possible (e.g., adaptation of the Env proteins to
improve the targeting of a specific cell type or fixation of
a deleterious mutation through stochastic processes). Further studies comparing the spectrum of infectivity of Env
proteins present in the genetically homogeneous viral
populations of viruses present immediately before seroconversion with that observed following the development
of the anti-viral immune response will help define the
extent that selection of variants associated with immune
escape affects Env function.

the infectivity of the recombinant viruses would not be
reflective of viruses in plasma. First, recombinant viruses
formed using mixtures of sequences amplified from
plasma will express heterotrimeric Env proteins, including, for some samples, trimers containing sequences with
both X4 and R5 tropism. In this regard, our preliminary
results suggest that the infectivity of viruses generated
using mixtures of clonal env sequences may be lower than
the mean infectivity of viruses expressing each of these env
sequences as homotrimers. In addition, during the amplification of env sequences from plasma, recombination
between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur,
and may form sequences in which incompatibilities
between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity. In
view of these uncertainties, further studies will be required
to fully define the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins
expressed by viruses in plasma.

The possibility that viral evolution during in vitro culture
contributed to diversity should also be considered. For
example, greatest viral diversity was observed for patient
3, and clones from this patient emerged later than those
from the other patients. However, control experiments
(see Materials and Methods) showed no evidence for viral
evolution during culture. In particular, the absence of polymorphic bases in the sequences of the viral clones indicates that variants were not emerging to the extent that
they were detectable by bulk sequencing, and therefore
were not sufficiently abundant to influence either viral
diversity or the assessment of infectivity.

An interesting observation from our study was the
absence of correlation between the infectivity of the
recombinant viruses studied and their susceptibility to
several different entry inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies. The affinity of Env-coreceptor interactions is one factor that can influence both Env fusion kinetics and the
sensitivity of Env to the inhibition by enfuvirtide and
TAK-779 [35,36,56,59], although mutations that modify
sensitivity to co-receptor antagonists without modifying
fusion kinetics have also been described [36,60]. The failure to find a correlation between Env infectivity and sensitivity to these inhibitors suggests that differences
affecting membrane fusion that are independent of Envcoreceptor affinity (e.g., "fusogenicity") or differences
affecting other Env properties (e.g., the expression or stability of Env trimers) make an important contribution to
the wide spectrum of Env infectivities observed in this
study.

The spectrum of Env infectivity in vivo is almost certainly
greater than observed in our study. The Env proteins studied by us were derived from viruses capable of productively infecting MT4-R5 cells. We must assume that the env
sequences of these viruses were enriched for those with
high infectivity in this cell system, and Env proteins carrying lethal mutations or mutations preventing efficient
propagation in MT4-R5 cell cultures would not be sampled. We found that recombinant viruses produced using
bulk env sequences amplified directly from plasma by RTPCR had an infectivity that was lower than that of recombinant viruses carrying Env proteins from the clonal
viruses derived from the same sample, as would be
expected if a significant proportion of viruses present in
plasma carry Env proteins that are noninfectious or whose
infectivity is too low to permit emergence of clones during
in vitro culture. The finding in previous studies that a substantial portion of viruses expressing env sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR show low or undetectable
infectivity is also compatible with this interpretation [1923,53,58]. It should be emphasized, however, that additional artifacts may also contribute to the low infectivity
observed in our study for viruses carrying bulk env
sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR, such that

We did observe, however, that sensitivity to inhibition by
soluble CD4, enfuvirtide, and three different neutralizing
antibodies were properties that were shared by viruses
from a given patient, independent of their infectivity. Similarly, Ray et al. found differences in enfuvirtide sensitivity
comparing Env clones isolated from different patients
[58]. These findings suggest that genetic determinants
important in defining the sensitivity to these entry inhibitors lie in regions that are not necessarily subject to extensive diversity. For example, determinants in the relatively
well conserved membrane proximal ectodomain of gp41
appear to be important in determining sensitivity to both
enfuvirtide and the monoclonal antibody 2F5 [61,62].
Determinants of sensitivity to inhibitors of coreceptor
binding appear to be subject to greater intra-patient variability. No patient-specific differences in sensitivity to TAK779 was observed in our study, and considerable variability in sensitivity of individual Env clones from a given

Retrovirology 2008, 5:23

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/23

patient has been reported for several other coreceptor
antagonists [58]. Thus, the impact of viral diversity on
sensitivity to entry inhibitors is likely to differ for inhibitors with different modes of action. Our findings suggest,
however, that resistance to entry inhibitors is not likely to
be a useful surrogate marker for viral infectivity.

Conclusion
These studies highlight the difficulty in defining the replicative "fitness" of viral Env proteins from a given patient,
because viruses can display a large spectrum of Env infectivities and this spectrum is different in different cell types.
Similarly, our studies confirm that considerable variability can be encountered in the sensitivity of individual Env
proteins to entry inhibitors, and that this parameter can
vary independently of Env infectivity. Only through
clonal analysis can the heterogeneity of these Env properties be fully appreciated. As discussed above, further characterization of the spectrum of Env infectivity at different
stages of disease evolution should provide insights into
factors that govern viral pathogenesis. Because these
parameters may differ in different individuals, this information may prove to be of prognostic significance.

Methods
Patients
Clonal viral populations were obtained from five patients
chronically infected with HIV-1. Clinical information of
these patients is summarized in Table 1. All patients were
evaluated at the Hôpital Bichat – Claude Bernard, and
informed consent was obtained prior to participation in
the study. Three of the patients were not receiving treatment with antiretroviral drugs at the time of initial evaluation (patients 1–3). Patient 1 had never been treated.
Patient 2 had received intermittent treatment with several
regimens containing nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and protease inhibitors over a
two year period, but had discontinued therapy 2 months
before evaluation. Patient 3 had been treated for 1 year
with AZT+3TC+efavirenz, but treatment had been discontinued for 3 years prior to evaluation. Patients 4 and 5 had

a ≥ 2 year history of treatment failure. Both had been
treated initially with nucleoside analog RT inhibitors, and
subsequently received regimens also including non-nucleoside RT inhibitors, protease inhibitors and/or enfuvirtide in various combinations, but plasma virus had never
become undetectable. Neither patient had received antiviral agents that target viral entry for at least 1 year prior to
evaluation. For patient 2, clonal viral populations were
obtained from two different plasma samples obtained
eight months apart.
Clonal viral populations
Clonal viral populations were obtained as previously
described [41,42]. Briefly, MT4-R5 cells, expressing CCR5
and CXCR4 receptors, were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/
ml in complete medium containing 1% (v/v) DMSO, and
0.25 ml aliquots were distributed in 24-well plates. An
equal volume of plasma, diluted in complete medium
containing (final concentration) 1% DMSO and 2 μg/ml
DEAE-dextran, was added to each well. The plates were
centrifuged (860 xg; 2 hours; 22°C), and cultured for 4
hours at 37°C to permit viral entry. Cells were recovered,
washed once, and 200 μl aliquots containing 2 × 104 cells
were distributed into 96-well plates. The cultures were
maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2, and were passaged with
a 1:10 dilution every 7 days. Cultures were inspected by
light microscopy, and when patent cytopathic changes
were observed, the culture supernatant and the cell pellet
from infected wells were recovered separately and frozen
at -80°C. If viral replication was observed in >20% of the
wells, the experiment was repeated after further dilution
of the plasma. The days in culture at which the clones
from different patients emerged is shown in Table 1. Seventy-five percent of all clones had emerged by day 24.

Findings in this and our prior studies [41,42] supported
the conclusion that viral evolution was not occurring during culture. In control experiments, pNL4-3-derived
viruses containing protease mutations that substantially
impaired viral fitness (replicative capacity 10–20% of
wild-type virus) were used in our protocol to generate

clonal viruses, and the protease region from 36 different
clones was sequenced. Without exception, these
sequences were identical to the original plasmid (14,256
bases) and no evidence of reversion of the deleterious
mutations was observed, despite that reversion of any of
the mutations would have substantially improved fitness.
In addition, proviral DNA (including env) was amplified
and sequenced for every clone used in our study, and
without exception, no ambiguous bases were identified.
The absence of detectable polymorphisms is consistent
with the interpretation that variants were not emerging
during culture to the extent that their presence was detectable by bulk sequencing (i.e., >10%).

stained with ethidium bromide to verifiy that a single
band of appropriate size had been amplified and to permit quantification of the product. The 2.6 kb fragment
that spans the env region deleted from the pNL4-3-ΔENVlucR vector and also comprises 143 bp (N-terminal) and
104 bp (C-terminal) extensions to allow homologous
recombination with this vector was amplified using similar conditions, except that oligonucleotides EB1 (5'GAAAGAGCAGAAGACAGTGGCAATGA)
and
EB2
(5'ACTTGCCACCCATCTTATAGCAAA) were used, and
cycling conditions were: 98°C for 30 sec, followed by 40
cycles at 98°C for 5 sec, 70°C for 20 sec and 72°C for 90
sec each; and a final step at 72°C for 10 min.

Vectors
We have previously described a pNL4-3-derived proviral
vector in which the env sequence coding for most of
gp120 and the ectodomain of gp41 (nucleotides 6480 to
8263) has been deleted and replaced by a linker sequence
containing a unique MluI restriction site [34]. To create a
similar vector expressing Renilla luciferase in place of Nef,
the BamHI – NcoI fragment was removed, and the
remaining fragment was ligated with the BamHI – KpnI
fragment from pTN7-NL [63] and the KpnI – NcoI fragment from pNL4-3, creating (pNL4-3-ΔectoENV-lucR).
An analogous proviral vector was also constructed in
which all of the env sequence except for that coding the 13
N-terminal amino acids of gp120 and the 29 C-terminal
amino acids of gp41 (nucleotides 6344–8691) has been
deleted and replaced by a linker sequence containing a
unique NheI restriction site (pNL4-3-ΔENV-lucR).

To amplify env sequences present in plasma, RNA was isolated from plasma using a QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kit
(Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and random hexamer primers. Env sequences were amplified in a
single reaction using the protocol described above.

Amplification of proviral DNA
DNA was extracted from the infected cell pellets using a
QIAamp Viral DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA),
resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris buffer containing 1
mM EDTA, and used as a template to amplify env fragments. To amplify the 2.2 kb fragment that spans the env
region deleted from the pNL4-3-ΔectoENV-lucR vector
and also containing 147 bp (N-terminal) and 258 bp (Cterminal) extensions to allow homologous recombination with this vector, reactions (50 μl) contained 2 μl
DNA, 200 μM each dNTPs, 1.5 mM Mg2+, 0.5 μM each oligonucleotides E5 (5'-GTCTATTATGGGGTACCTGTGTGGA) and FuB (5'-GGTGGTAGCTGAAGAGGCACAGG),
1U Phusion hot start DNA polymerase (Finnzymes,
Espoo, Finland), and 1X Phusion HF reaction buffer.
Cycling conditions were as follows: 98°C for 30 sec, followed by 5 cycles at 98°C for 5 sec, 72°C for 5 sec and
72°C for 90 sec each; 5 cycles at 98°C for 5 sec, 70°C for
5 sec and 72°C for 90 sec each; 30 cycles at 98°C for 5 sec,
68°C for 20 sec and 72°C for 90 sec each; with a final step
at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified by
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Aliquots of the
purified DNA was electrophoresed into agarose gels and

Cell culture
293T cells and U373-CD4 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin (complete medium). MT4-R5 cells were cultured in similarly supplemented RPMI-1640 medium. For
U373-CD4 cells stably expressing CCR5 or CXCR4 [64],
medium also contained 10 μg/ml puromycin and 100 μg/
ml hygromycin B.
Production of recombinant viruses
The techniques used to produce recombinant viruses have
previously been described [34,65,66]. Briefly, 293T cells
that had been grown to 80% confluency in T25 flasks were
co-transfected with 8 μg of MluI-linearized pNL4-3-ΔectoENV-lucR vector (or NheI-linearized pNL4-3-ΔENVlucR vector) and 1 μg of the corresponding PCR product
using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and
cultured in 3 ml of complete medium. After 18 h, cells
were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
culture medium was replaced. Forty-four h after transfection culture medium was recovered and centrifuged (800
xg; 10 min), and p24 antigen present in the supernatant
was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (Innotest HIV antigen mAB, Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium).
Evaluation of viral infectivity
The infectivity of recombinant viruses for different target
cell types was determined by measuring luciferase activity.
To do so, target cells were plated in black-wall, clear bottom 96-well plates (Greiner, Courtaboeuf, France). U373
cells were plated at 2 × 103 cells/well 48 h prior to infection; MT4-R5 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well on the

day of infection. Medium was removed and replaced with
60 μl of complete medium containing serial two-fold
dilutions of freshly harvested supernatants from transfected cells containing 0.069 – 50 ng p24/ml. Forty-four
hours after infection, 20 μl of 4X luciferase lysis buffer
(Renilla luciferase assay system, Promega, Charbonnières,
France) was added to each well, and plates were maintained at room temperature for 30 min. Wells were
sequentially injected with 100 μl of luciferase substrate
(Promega), and 3 seconds later, light emission (relative
light units, RLU) was measured over a two sec interval
using a Microlumat LB96P luminometer (Berthold, Oak
Ridge, TN). Each sample was evaluated in triplicate. RLU
were plotted as a function of amount of p24 used to infect
the cells, and infectivity was defined as the slope [(RLU/
sec)/(ng p24/ml)] as determined by linear regression; in
this analysis, each replicate RLU value was treated as an
individual point.
In preliminary experiments, we compared the infectivity
of viruses obtained after transfection of 293T cells with
proviral plasmids, and viruses created by recombination
between env sequences amplified from the same plasmid
and the pNL4-3-derived ΔEnv vector according to our protocol. The infectivity of the viruses produced through
recombination was 89 ± 37% (mean ± SD; n = 5) of that
observed for viruses obtained directly by transfection (p >
0.2 by paired t-test).
For each viral Env protein studied, infectivity was determined for each cell type in at least three independent
experiments. Infection was considered undetectable if the
RLU observed for the highest concentration of p24 evaluated was less than 500 RLU/sec (i.e., infectivity <2 (RLU/
sec)/(ng p24/ml). The mean coefficient of variation for
clonal Env proteins with detectable infectivity was as follows: U373-R5 cells (n = 58), 42%; U373-X4 cells (n =
17), 50%; MT4-R5 cells (n = 70), 37%.
Inhibition of infectivity by entry inhibitors
To measure the susceptibility of recombinant viruses to
inhibition by enfuvirtide and TAK-799, U373-R5 cells
were plated at a density of 6 × 103 cells/well as described
above, and infected with the same dose of recombinant
virus in the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations of enfuvirtide (1.6 to 5,000 ng/ml; T20, American
Peptide Company, Sunnyvale, CA) or TAK-799 (0.8 to
2500 nM; NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). Forty four hours after infection, luciferase activity
was measured as described above. For each virus, an
amount of p24 was used that gave approximately 5 × 104
RLU/second for cells infected in the absence of inhibitor.
Each experimental condition was evaluated in triplicate.
To determine the concentration of inhibitor required for

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/23

reduce viral infectivity by 50% (IC50), data was fitted to a
sigmoid dose-response curve with variable slope.
The susceptibility of recombinant viruses to inhibition by
soluble CD4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and monoclonal antibodies 48d (human anti-gp120, NIH AIDS
Research and Reference Reagent Program), 2G12 (human
anti-gp120, Polymun Scientific, Vienna, Austria) and 2F5
(human anti-gp41, Polymun Scientific) was measured by
similar techniques, except that recombinant viruses were
preincubated for 1 h at 37°C with serial three-fold dilutions of soluble CD4 or monoclonal antibodies, before
using 60 μl of the mixture to infect target cells. For each
viral Env, infectivity was determined for each inhibitor
cell type in at least two, and usually three independent
experiments. The mean coefficient of variation for the six
entry inhibitors ranged from 25% (enfuvirtide) to 64%
(soluble CD4).
Cytofluorometry
U373 cells were detached by incubation in PBS containing
0.8% EDTA. Cells were resuspended in PBS containing
20% human serum (1 × 106 cells; 100 μl) and 10 μl of one
of the following monoclonal antibodies: phycoerythrinconjugated mouse anti-human CCR5 (clone 2D7), phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human CXCR4 (clone
12G5), FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD4 (clone
RPA-T4), or similarly conjugated isotype-matched control
antibodies (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Following a 1
h incubation at 4°C, cells were washed once and analyzed
using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Analysis was restricted to viable cells, identified on the
basis of forward and 90° scatter.
Data analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated. Comparisons between groups were performed
using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Post test comparisons, performed only if p < 0.05, were made using Dunn's multiple
comparison test. Correlations were evaluated using the
Spearman test. Nucleotide diversity was determined using
the method of Tajima and Nei [67].
