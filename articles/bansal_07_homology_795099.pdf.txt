Abstract
Background: The major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) facilitate the transport of water and neutral
solutes across the lipid bilayers. Plant MIPs are believed to be important in cell division and
expansion and in water transport properties in response to environmental conditions. More than
30 MIP sequences have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, maize and rice. Plasma membrane
intrinsic proteins (PIPs), tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), Nod26-like intrinsic protein (NIPs) and
small and basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) are subfamilies of plant MIPs. Despite sequence diversity, all
the experimentally determined structures belonging to the MIP superfamily have the same "hourglass" fold.
Results: We have structurally characterized 39 rice and 31 maize MIPs and compared them with
that of Arabidopsis. Homology models of 105 MIPs from all three plant species were built. Structurebased sequence alignments were generated and the residues in the helix-helix interfaces were
analyzed. Small residues (Gly/Ala/Ser/Thr) are found to be highly conserved as a group in the helixhelix interface of MIP structures. Individual families sometimes prefer one or another of the
residues from this group. The narrow aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter in MIPs has been
shown to provide an important constriction for solute permeability. Ar/R regions were analyzed
and compared between the three plant species. Seventeen TIP, NIP and SIP members from rice and
maize have ar/R signatures that are not found in Arabidopsis. A subgroup of rice and maize NIPs has
small residues in three of the four positions in the ar/R tetrad, resulting in a wider constriction.
These MIP members could transport larger solute molecules.
Conclusion: Small residues are group-conserved in the helix-helix interface of MIP structures and
they seem to be important for close helix-helix interactions. Such conservation might help to
preserve the hour-glass fold in MIP structures. Analysis and comparison of ar/R selectivity filters
suggest that rice and maize MIPs could transport more diverse solutes than Arabidopsis MIPs. Thus
the MIP members show conservation in helix-helix interfaces and diversity in aromatic/arginine
selectivity filters. The former is related to structural stability and the later can be linked to
functional diversity.

Background
Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins belong to the ancient
superfamily of Major Intrinsic Proteins (MIPs) and facilitate passive transport of water and small solutes across
membranes of various organisms [1,2]. Aquaporins are
likely to have important role in growth, development and
stress response in plants [3-5]. MIPs in plants are abundant and constitute a large and highly divergent protein
family. For instance, Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays
have more than 30 aquaporin-encoding genes each [6,7].
Phylogenetic analysis of plant MIP sequences revealed
four major subfamilies: the plasma membrane intrinsic
proteins (PIPs), tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) and small and basic
intrinsic proteins (SIPs). Functionally, two main categories have been well established for MIPs from mammals:
water-specific aquaporins and solute-transporting
aquaglyceroporins [2]. Most of the plant MIPs that have
been investigated are highly specific for water. Several TIPs
have been reported to facilitate the transport of urea and
ammonia and NIPs have been shown to transport glycerol
[8-12]. Recent studies indicate that PIPs contribute to
CO2 diffusion across leaf tissues [13]. The substrate specificity of SIP proteins has not been studied in detail.
The primary sequence of aquaporins exhibits an internal
homology and there is ~20% conservation between the Nand the C-terminal halves [14]. The high-resolution structures of several members of MIP family have been determined and are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
[15]. Bovine AQP1 [16], GlpF [17] and AqpZ [18] from E.
coli, sheep and bovine AQP0 [19,20], SoPIP2;1 from spinach [21] and the archaeal aquaporin AqpM from Methanothermobacter
marburgensis
[22], all reveal a
homotetrameric organization and each aquaporin monomer forms an independent functional pore. This canonical fold is characterized by a six tilted, membranespanning (TM1 to TM6) right-handed helical bundle connected by five loop regions (loops A to E) with N and Cterminal ends located on the cytoplasmic side of the
membrane (Figure 1). Loops B and E contain the highly
conserved NPA (Asn-Pro-Ala) motifs and form two halfhelices that dip into the membrane from opposite sides.
The N-terminal ends of these half-helices are connected
by interactions between the two NPA boxes and it is also
one of the two major constrictions in the channel [1,14].
The second major constriction is located ~8 Å above the
NPA region towards the periplasmic side (Figure 1) and
this primary selectivity filter known as the aromatic/
arginine (ar/R) region is formed by two residues from
TM2 and TM5 and two residues from loop E [1,14]. This
constriction has been shown as a major check point for
solute permeability [23].

The ar/R selectivity filter of spinach plasma membrane
intrinsic protein SoPIP2;1 (Figure 2) and three other highresolution water-specific aquaporin structures, AQP1
[16], AqpZ [18], and AQP0 [19,20], contain a Phe from
TM2 (H2 position), His from TM5 (Position H5) and Arg
from the loop E (LE2). A fourth residue from loop E (LE1
position) also forms part of the selectivity region by providing its backbone carbonyl oxygen to the ar/R filter and
this is usually observed to be a small residue (Cys, Thr or
Ala). Crystal structures indicate that His and Arg of ar/R
region could provide donor hydrogen bonds for water
molecules. The ar/R selectivity filters of Arabidopsis PIP
members resemble that of water-selective mammalian
and microbial aquaporins [24]. In the glycerol-specific
GlpF [17], ar/R selectivity filter residues Phe (H2), His
(H5) and the smaller residue at LE1 position typically
found in water-sepcific channels are substituted by Trp,
Gly and Phe respectively (Figure 2). This gives rise to the
selectivity filter with larger pore diameter among the

asparagines from the conserved NPA motif of loops B and E
are shown in yellow. The aquaporin structures from bacteria,
archaea, plant and mammals show a conserved "hour-glass"
fold and the helices form a right-handed bundle structure.

known aquaporin structures with two hydrophobic walls
opposite the conserved arginine. Such architecture is
thought to facilitate the transport of glycerol efficiently
[25-28].
Draft genome sequences of rice and more recently, highly
accurate finished rice genome sequence have been determined [29-31]. In this paper, we have obtained the complete set of rice aquaporins (OsMIPs) from the rice
genomic sequence. We have built three-dimensional
structures of rice (OsMIPs) and maize (ZmMIPs) MIPs
using homology modeling with AQP1, GlpF and AqpZ
crystal structures as templates. Their models were compared with that of Arabidopsis (AtMIPs) MIPs. It has been
realized that conserved glycines within the transmembrane helices facilitate the closest approaches of helices in
the center of the aquaporin helix bundle [18,32,33]. We

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/27

have generated structure-based sequence alignments in
the transmembrane region of all the plant MIPs from the
homology models. Conservation of residues in the helixhelix interfaces was analyzed and our results show that
residues occurring in the helix-helix interfaces are small
and are strongly group-conserved in plant MIPs. Wallace
and Roberts [24] have recently performed sequence alignments and homology modeling studies of AtMIPs. Based
on the residues that form the ar/R selectivity filter, it was
found that TIP, NIP and SIP families diverge from the classical aquaporin structures. Their results suggested that
these proteins are likely to have functions distinct from
classical aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. Hence we
compared the ar/R selectivity filters of rice and maize with
that of Arabidopsis. Analysis of pore selectivity regions
reveals that NIPs and TIPs from rice and maize are much
more diverse compared to AtMIPs. Based on the structural
analysis, we have identified potential MIP candidates that
could possibly transport diverse solute molecules such as
arsenite.

Rice MIP sequences
Identification of rice MIP sequences has become possible
due to the availability of complete rice genome sequence.
TBLASTN [34-37] searches made in GenBank [38,39],
Rice Genome Project (RGP) [40] and The Institute of
Genomic Research (TIGR) [41,42] found thirty nine different rice MIP genes. Recently, Sakurai et al. [43] have
reported the identification of 33 rice MIP genes and investigated their expression and function. In their study, classification based on phylogenetic analysis indicated the
presence of 11 PIPs, 10 TIPs, 10 NIPs and 2 SIPs. Sequence
comparisons showed that all the reported 33 MIP genes
are identified in our analysis also. We included the six
additional MIPs (Table 1) and performed phylogenetic
analyses of all 39 proteins (Figure 3). The groups recognized in earlier analyses are more or less intact in the
present study. Hence the nomenclature for the 33
sequences is retained as reported by Sakurai et al. [43].
Among the six additional MIPs, there are 2 PIPs, one TIP
and 3 NIPs and their names are given based on the subfamily they belong to. The additional PIPs identified in
this study are the two mRNA sequences of indica-cultivar
group available from the GenBank (only these two are
from the indica subspecies and all other rice MIPs in this
study belong to the japonica subspecies). OsTIP2;3 has a
very long C-terminal extension and hence we have considered only the aquaporin region in this sequence for further analysis. Two of the three NIP sequences have been
identified from TIGR release 2 and their amino acid
sequences have undergone changes from Release 2 to
Release 4. In OsNIP3;4, N-terminus is longer by 43 residues in Release 4. A large deletion is observed in
OsNIP1;5 between the two NPA regions. However, pre-

diction of amino acid sequence from genomic sequence
using GeneMark [44] supports the sequences from
Release 2. Hence in the present study, we have used amino
acid sequences from Release 2 for OsNIP1;5 and
OsNIP3;4. All the six additional sequences were correctly
recognized as MIP/aquaporin sequences in Interpro
[45,46] and the rice PIP and TIP sequences identified in
this work (OsPIP1;4, OsPIP1;5 and OsTIP2;3) were also
found in the database of MIP family of proteins [47,48].
Homology models of 39 rice MIPs, 31 maize MIPs were
built as per the modeling protocol described in the Methods section. The same procedure was also used to construct the models of Arabidopsis MIPs. In total, 105 models
were used to analyze the residue conservation in helixhelix interface and the nature of the ar/R selectivity filters
in plant MIPs.
Residues in the helix-helix interfaces of MIP family
members
Table 2 lists the residue pairs occurring at the interfaces of
pairs of TM helices or of a TM helix and the half-helix
from loops B/E of all aquaporin crystal structures. These
residue pairs are within 3.5 Å of the interacting helix in at
least one of the template structures used in the modeling
study. Such interactions are between either side chain –
side chain or side chain – back bone atoms and most are
observed between three helix pairs: TM1 and TM3, TM4
and TM6, and, TM2 and TM5 (Figure 4). The sequence
motifs GAxxA/GGxxA/GAxxG from TM3, GxxxGAxxA/
GxxxGAxxG from TM6 and SxxxG/AxxxG/GxxxG from
TM2 have close Cα-Cα contacts (≤ ~6 Å) with helices
TM1, TM4 and TM5 respectively. The interface of TM1 and
TM2 is also characterized by interactions between a small
residue from TM1 (Thr 55 from 1Z98 and equivalent residues from other structures; see Table 2) and the residue
that participates in the ar/R selectivity filter from TM2.
Additionally, close contacts between the half-helices from
loops B and E are observed with TM6 and TM3 respectively. The average distances between Cα atoms of equivalent residue pairs calculated from the six high-resolution
crystal structures are also given in Table 2. Most of the distances are less than 6 Å indicating a very close approach of
the helix pairs, TM1–TM2, TM1–TM3, TM4–TM6 and
TM2–TM5. At least one residue occurring at the helix-helix

interfaces can be classified as small and weakly polar residue (Gly, Ala, Ser and Thr). In three cases (TM2–TM5, LBTM6, LE-TM3), both residues in the interfaces are small.
In total, seventeen small and weakly polar residues seem
to play an important role in close helix packing in known
aquaporin structures (Table 2). We have studied the conservation of these residues in the structure-based sequence
alignments of all plant MIPs and also in each of the subfamilies separately.
The occurrence and the role of small and weakly polar residues in helix-helix interfaces of membrane proteins have
been extensively investigated in earlier studies [33,49].
Analysis of high-resolution structures of α-helix bundle
proteins revealed that high abundance of small residues
(Gly, Ser, Thr and Ala) mediate helix-helix interactions in
membrane proteins and result in closely packed helices.
Hence, for the purpose of this analysis, the residues Gly,
Ser, Thr, Ala and Cys have been grouped together and
their group conservation is determined in the interfacial
positions. We have also reported the individual residues
from this group and their conservation if it exceeds 25%
(Table 3). All the 17 positions are more than 90% groupconserved in the 105 MIP sequences. Group-conservation
for small residues for the helix interfacial positions is the
highest (97–100%) for the PIP sub-family followed by the
TIP members (94–100%). Although, majority of the small
residues are highly conserved in NIP family members, the
conservation of Thr 55 and Ala 253 (residues and their
corresponding residue numbers reported in this section
are from 1Z98 unless otherwise mentioned) falls below
90% in these two positions. Group-conservation of small
residues in helix-helix interface is generally high in SIP
family, but some positions are poorly conserved (Ala 78,
Gly 82 and Ser 181). Many important positions that are
likely to affect the interior properties of the channels have
been shown to be different in SIP members in comparison
with other plant MIP proteins [50]. It should also be
noted that the sample size for SIP family is very small (8
members).
While the group-conservation is very strong in all the 17
interfacial positions, there are instances in which subfamilies show strong preference for one or another amino

Additional rice MIPs in the phyologenetic tree of all rice MIPs. Phylogenetic analysis of all 39 rice MIP sequences is
shown. This tree was created using the Neighbor-Joining method and the multiple sequence alignment for this purpose was
generated by the T-Coffee program [81]. As observed in Arabidopsis and maize, rice MIPs also can be classified into four subfamilies. OsPIPs, OsTIPs, OsNIPs and OsSIPs respectively indicate plasma membrane intrinsic proteins, tonoplast intrinsic proteins, Nod26-like intrinsic proteins and small basic intrinsic proteins from rice.

For instance, glycine is strongly conserved at positions 82
and 133 in PIPs, but alanine is the preferred amino acid
for TIPs in the same position (Table 3). Similarly, alanine
is strongly conserved at position 256 in PIPs and TIPs, but
glycine has 100% conservation at this position in NIP
members.
Comparison of the Ar/R selectivity filters in rice/maize and
Arabidopsis
Wallace and Roberts [24] have recently performed
sequence alignments and homology modeling studies of

AtMIPs. Based on the residues that form the ar/R selectivity filter, Arabidopsis aquaporins have been classified into
eight structural subclasses. The amino acid signatures of
subclasses belonging to TIP, NIP and SIP families diverge
from the classical aquaporin structures and it has been
suggested that these proteins are likely to have functions
distinct from classical aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins.
Ar/R selectivity filter was analyzed in all the homology
models generated in this study and compared among the
three plant species. All the PIP members from the three
plant species have ar/R selectivity filter that shows similarity with water-transporting AQP1. Aromatic/arginine sigPage 5 of 17

equivalent residues from the other crystal structures were obtained from structure-based sequence alignment (see Additional files 1 to 8). For
example, the equivalent residue pairs for (S28, F58) in 1J4N are (G25, W48) in 1FX8, (G19, F43) in 1RC2, (T55, F81) in 1Z98, (G27, F48) in 2B6O
and (G22, F62) in 2F2B. Small residues (Gly/Ala/Ser/Thr) are shown in bold. b Average Cα...Cα distances calculated for residue pairs from all the six
crystal structures are given.

natures of 30 out of 39 OsMIPs and 23 out of 31 ZmMIPs
are identical or similar to their Arabidopsis counterparts
(Table 4). The characteristics of these selectivity filters
have been described in detail in the earlier studies [24]
and hence will not be discussed here. MIP members that
have unique ar/R selectivity filters found only in rice and
maize are discussed in detail below.

region for this model is very similar to that of GlpF (Figure
6), but this constriction is more hydrophilic. In OsTIP4;1,
Thr is found at both H2 and H5 positions and as a result
this will have a larger pore diameter at the constriction
region. In OsTIP5;1 and ZmTIP5;1, the H5 position has
Val and hence the selectivity filter is less hydrophilic than
the other members from this group.

Analysis of homology models shows that some rice and
maize TIP family members have ar/R selectivity filters that
are not found in Arabidopsis and they are listed in Table 5
along with the residues in the four positions that form the
ar/R signatures. In five TIPs from maize (ZmTIP4;1,
ZmTIP4;2 and ZmTIP4;3) and rice (OsTIP4;1 and
OsTIP4;2), the H5 position contains a small hydroxyl residue. In these members, the ar/R selectivity filter is devoid
of any hydrophobic residue at both H2 and H5 positions,
thus making it highly polar. The LE1 and LE2 positions in
this group are occupied by Ala and the highly conserved
Arg residue respectively. No Arabidopsis TIP gene has an ar/
R filter with this feature (Table 5). The selectivity filter of
representative member of this group, OsTIP4;2 is shown
in Figure 5. The pore diameter at the ar/R selectivity filter

Small residues (Gly/Ala/Ser/Cys) at H2 and H5 positions
are found in seven rice (OsNIP2;1, OsNIP2;2, OsNIP3;2,
OsNIP3;5 and OsNIP4;1) and maize (ZmNIP2;1 and
ZmNIP2;2) NIP members. Except OsNIP3;5, the position
LE1 also possesses a small residue (Gly/Ala) in these
members. OsNIP3;5 has a proline in this position. Due to
the small size of the residues that form the selectivity filter, these NIP members are likely to have the constriction
size that is the largest among all the generated homology
models. Residues forming the selectivity filter are shown
for a representative member of this group (Figure 5). Due
to the small size of the residues, the pore diameter in this
region is about 1 Å larger compared to GlpF and about 2.2
Å larger than the water-specific plant PIP structure (Figure

Small and polar residues at the helix-helix interfaces of SoPIP2;1. Small and polar residues occurring in helix-helix
interfaces of spinach plant aquaporin SoPIP2;1 are displayed. The helix pairs TM1–TM3 (left), TM2–TM5 (middle) and TM4–
TM6 (right) are shown. The backbone is drawn in ribbon representation and the interfacial residues are depicted as space-filling models. Residue numbers of interfacial residues correspond to the PDB structure 1Z98.
SIP family members are more distantly related to other
MIP members and also with the three template sequences.
The selectivity filters of SIP members differ significantly
from other plant MIP family and any of the known AQP
members. For the two Arabidopsis members, AtSIP1;1 and
AtSIP1;2, the putative ar/R signature obtained in this
study (Table 4) differs from the earlier models created by
Wallace and Roberts [24]. The H2 position contains a
hydrophobic residue (Ile/Val) instead of Thr. Residues in
other positions are observed to be the same and hence
hydrophobic character of this filter in our model will be
greater than that reported in the previous study. In SIP
members OsSIP1;1, ZmSIP1;1 and ZmSIP1;2, both H2
and H5 positions are hydrophobic and Pro and Asn are
observed in loop E positions.

Discussion
Reliability of the plant MIP homology models
In this study, we have modeled 105 plant MIP sequences
from three different plant species. The initial and an

important step in comparative modeling is the selection
of the template structure(s). The higher the sequence
identity between the sequence(s) of the template structure(s) and the target sequences, the most reliable will be
the generated models [51]. In the present study, the
sequence identity between the template structures and the
target sequences is not very high (26 to 46% for PIPs, TIPs
and NIPs; 22 to 29% for SIPs; Table 6). The experimentally determined aquaporin structures from archaea, bacteria, plant and mammals all show a remarkably
conserved hour-glass model with right-handed helical
bundle structure (Figure 1). For example, the RMSD is less
than 1 Å on Cα atoms within the transmembrane regions
between the animal and plant aquaporins [21] and the
sequence identity between these sequences is ~40%.
Based on molecular dynamics simulations, Law and Sansom [52] suggested that homology models based on bacterial homologs may be used to derive meaningful
information on the structure, dynamics and function of
the corresponding mammalian protein. Before modeling

the plant MIPs, we first validated our approach by modeling the SoPIP2;1 structure using the templates from bacteria and mammals and compared with the experimental
structure determined at 2.1 Å resolution (Figure 7; see
Methods section). The α-carbon backbone of the model
generated using three templates shows an excellent agreement with the x-ray structure in the TM region (six TM helices + loops B and E). The higher RMSD observed for the
Cα atoms of the whole structure is due to the differences
in the loops outside the TM region. Except SIPs, almost all
the plant MIP sequences considered for this study have
the characteristic sequence features typically found in
aquaporin sequences (such as NPA motifs, conserved
glutamates in TM1 and TM4 etc.).
Homology models of plant MIPs were characterized and
structural subclasses were derived based on the residues
forming the ar/R selectivity filter. The ar/R tetrad in PIP,
NIP and TIP members from Arabidopsis obtained in this
study are identical to that reported earlier by Wallace and
Roberts [24](see above). They used the MOE homology

approximate location of ar/R constriction region. The position Z = 0 Å corresponds to the location of NPA region.

The differences observed in the selectivity filters of one
subgroup of SIP sequences in the two studies could be
attributed to the fact that SIP sequences are the most
diverse sequences. Many structurally important positions
in GlpF and AQP1 have been shown to be different in SIPs
[50]. For example, the conserved E17 (1J4N numbering)
in TM1 is replaced by aspartate. Similarly, F24 in TM1 and
Y99 in TM3 are replaced by Trp and Arg respectively. Our
modeling approach indeed correctly aligned the residues
E17, F24 and Y99 and the highly conserved Q103 in TM3
with the corresponding residues in SIP members (see
Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). However, Wallace
and Roberts' method failed to align these positions correctly and several positions in the N-terminal half of SIP
proteins are not correctly aligned (see supplementary data
of [24]). Hence we believe that our alignment is more
accurate and our model which resulted in a different selectivity filter for AtSIPs (Table 4) is more likely to be the correct one. Thus despite low sequence identities with the
bacterial and mammalian template structures, the TM
region of all the plant MIP homology models gives a reliable starting point to characterize the transmembrane
helix packing and pore regions of four MIP subfamilies
from three plant species.

program [53] based on a segment matching procedure
[54]. In the present study, MODELLER [55] was used to
build the homology models and SCWRL3 [56] was used
to refine the side chains. Although MOE and MODELLER
used different modeling strategies, the resultant models
from two different approaches have clear agreement in the
pore region.

Small residues at helix-helix interfaces are strongly groupconserved in plant MIPs
Analysis of high-resolution structures of 11 membrane
and 23 soluble α-helix bundle proteins revealed that high
abundance of small residues (Gly, Ser, Thr and Ala) mediate helix-helix interactions in membrane proteins and
result in closely packed helices [33]. The high propensity

the closely packed interfaces give rise to motifs such as
GxxxG that are known to drive transmembrane helix association [32,57]. Because of the lack of side chain, interfacial Gly residues can participate in weak Cα-H...O type of
hydrogen bonds. The small size of the residues can also
facilitate inter-helix interactions involving backbone C =
O and N-H groups [32]. The functional groups of the Ser,
Thr and Cys side-chains can also form inter-helical hydrogen bonds with the backbone C = O and N-H groups
across the helix interface. It has been observed that the
interfaces of transmembrane helix pairs in GlpF are lined
by small and polar residues [33] and networks of CαH...O interactions were identified in the high-resolution
crystal structure (PDB ID: 1FX8) of this protein [32].
Stroud et al. [18] have suggested that such weak hydrogen
bonds could explain the stability of E. coli AqpZ in denaturing conditions. Close packing of helices due to the
occurrences of small residues at the helix-helix interface
has been shown to have functional significance. Recent
experimental studies showed that anion permeability of
mammalian AQP6 might be due to the substitution of
interfacial glycine at TM2 by an Asn residue [58]. This Gly>Asn substitution observed in AQP6 seems to give more
flexibility to this protein compared to water-specific AQP1
and such flexibility is proposed to be one of the require-

ments to convert a water-specific channel to anion permeable channel.
Structure-based sequence alignments have helped in identifying highly conserved active site residues [59,60]. In
this study, analysis of sequence conservation in the structure-based sequence alignments of plant MIPs clearly
showed that the small residues occurring in the transmembrane helix interfaces are very highly conserved as a
group in plant MIPs. This conservation is seen for most of
the small residues in the interface even in distantly related
SIP families (see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). For
any one amino acid type, the sequence identity may be
40% (example, Gly 133 position in TM3; Table 3), but
when the small and polar amino acids Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr
and Cys are considered as a group, the conservation is
close to 100%. In the analysis of high-resolution crystal
structures, Smith and his coworkers have shown that the
molecular notches created by these small residues are a
common element of the most closely packed helices in
the core of membrane proteins [33,49]. In an analysis of
1047 class A GPCRs, it was revealed that small or polar
residues are strongly group-conserved in helix-interface
positions [49]. The same analysis was carried out in opsin,
amine, olfactory and peptide GPCR subfamilies separately

and it was shown that in some positions one or another
amino acid of this group is strongly preferred in the subfamilies. In the present analysis of 105 plant MIP
sequences, we have shown that the small or polar residues
are strongly conserved in the helix-helix interfaces as a
group. In the subfamily-specific analysis, we have also
observed that in some positions, a specific amino acid of
this group is preferred in the subfamilies. For example,
position 256 is Ala in PIPs and TIPs and it is Gly in NIPs
(Table 3). Similarly in position 55, Thr is predominantly
observed in PIPs while most of the other family members
have Gly in this position. It should be noted this group
conservation at the helix-helix interface would not have
been recognized if we had compared just the sequences
alone using the conventional multiple sequence alignment tools. In substitution matrices developed exclusively
for transmembrane proteins [61,62], the substitution of
Thr by Gly or vice versa is more unlikely. This clearly demonstrates the use of structure-based sequence alignment
for diverse proteins belonging to the same family where
the relationship is difficult to detect.

are occupied by small residues, indicating that ar/R constriction of this group will be the largest among all the
modeled plant MIPs. Our HOLE [63] analysis shows that
the diameter at this constriction is more than 4.0 Å that is
~1.2 Å larger than that of glycerol transporter, the largest
known constriction among the experimentally determined structures. Experimental studies have shown that
NIP members facilitate the transport of glycerol [12]. It
has been speculated that plant aquaporins transport different solutes such as arsenite [64]. Rice and maize NIP
members with small residues in three out of four positions of ar/R tetrad (Table 5) have the capability to conduct much larger solute molecules and thus will have
distinct structural and functional features, representing a
novel group of plant MIPs. This is supported by a recent
study that identified a silicon transporter gene in rice [65].
This gene belongs to the aquaporin family and the protein
amino acid sequence is identical to that of OsNIP2;1. The
same study also suggested that other NIP members,
ZmNIP2;1 and ZmNIP2;2, might also be involved in silicon uptake in maize.

Ar/R selectivity filters unique to rice and maize
Nine rice and eight maize MIPs have ar/R signatures that
seem to be distinct from any of the Arabidopsis MIPs (Table
5). Among the nine OsMIPs, eight have been shown to be
expressed [43] and the maize MIPs are derived from the
cDNA sequences [7]. The ar/R tetrad of three rice and four
maize TIP members (Table 5) is not found in Arabidopsis.
The conserved feature of five of the members of this group
(OsTIP4;1, OsTIP4;2, ZmTIP4;1, ZmTIP4;2 and
ZmTIP4;3) is that the residue at H2 position is
hydrophilic and the H5 residue is either serine or threonine. This gives rise to a wider hydrophilic constriction.
Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies on rat AQP1
showed that replacement of Phe at H2 and His at H5 positions by Ala did not have any effect on water flux [23]. It
was concluded that rat AQP1 water permeability is independent of the polarity at the ar/R constriction. However,
the increase in constriction diameter did play a role in the
mutant rat AQP1, facilitating the transport of bigger molecules like glycerol. Experimental studies have demonstrated that Arabidopsis TIP members have been shown to
transport urea (AtTIP1;1, AtTIP1;2, AtTIP2;1 and
AtTIP4;1) [8] and ammonia (AtTIP2;1 and AtTIP2;3) [10].
To our knowledge, no experimental data for the selectivity
of the above rice and maize TIP members is presently
available. The hydrophilic putative ar/R selectivity region
for this group of TIP members (OsTIP4;1, OsTIP4;2,
ZmTIP4;1, ZmTIP4;2 and ZmTIP4;3) with its wider constriction appears to be capable of transporting larger
hydrophilic solutes similar to glycerol (Figure 5).

A recent study on the two Arabidopsis NIP members demonstrated that the residue at H2 position is key in determining the selectivity of the channel [11]. Functional
studies showed that AtNIP6;1 with Ala at H2 position
exhibited extremely low water permeability but transported larger uncharged solutes like formamide, glycerol
and urea. When Ala at H2 was substituted by Trp similar
to the ar/R signature of soybean nodulin 26, the archetype
of the NIP subfamily, the mutant channel acquired the
ability to facilitate water transport and prevented the
transport of bulkier urea similar to the soybean nodulin
26 and other NIP members having this signature (Table
4). Due to the presence of a small residue at H2, the pore
aperture at the ar/R region increased in NIP6;1. The larger
diameter should have resulted in a pore with higher water
permeability. Contrary to the expectations, this was not
the case. A similar paradox was also observed by Stroud
and his coworkers [22]. The ar/R regions in the crystal
structures of AQP1, AqpM and GlpF constrict the diameter
of the channels to 1.86 Å, 2.54 Å and 3.14 Å respectively.
Yet, the most efficient water channel is AQP1 and GlpF is
a poor water-conducting glycerol channel. Conductance
rate of water in AqpM is relatively low in comparison to
AQP1. Thus the cross-sectional surface area of the ar/R
selectivity filter and the rate of conductance of water seem
to be inversely correlated. A hypothesis based on thermodynamic considerations postulates that in pores with
larger diameters, the channel may not be able to properly
organize water at the ar/R region [11]. Computational
studies have to be carried out to validate this hypothesis.
With three of the four in the ar/R tetrad are small residues,
in the NIP members like OsNIP2;1 identified in this
study, the small residues essentially do not impose any

constriction. We propose that these NIP members with
diameter larger than that of GlpF in this region are likely
to show the rate of water conductance that will be comparable to or even lower than that of GlpF (see above).
SIP subfamily is distantly related in sequence to the other
MIP family members and many substitutions in the putative functional regions have been noticed in the analysis
of SIP family of proteins [50]. Recent studies using membrane vesicles from yeast cells harbouring one of the Arabidopsis SIP members showed that both AtSIP1;1 and
AtSIP1;2 have water channel activity [66]; AtSIP2;1 did
not show any such activity although the protein was
clearly present in the membrane vesicles. The biochemical
characterization of the channel and the actual physiological functions remain to be determined for the SIPs.
Homology modeling of SIP members shows that the ar/R
filters have features that are very different from other MIP
members. The conserved Arg at LE2 position is absent in
all the SIPs. The challenges imposed due to the sequence
divergence resulted in a slightly different model for
AtSIP1;1 and AtSIP1;2 in our study (see above). While the
model of Wallace and Roberts [24] contained a threonine
at H2 position, our model has a hydrophobic residue at
the same position. Sequence analysis and putative ar/R
signatures suggest that SIPs are most likely to have substrate specificity very different from all known characterized MIPs.

Conclusion
We have structurally characterized rice aquaporins along
with those from maize and Arabidopsis. Homology modeling studies were used to build structural models for 105
plant MIPs. Analysis of structure-based sequence alignment of plant MIPs showed that small and weakly polar
residues have very high group conservation in the helixhelix interface. We propose that occurrence of small residue in the transmembrane helix interface enables close
helix – helix interactions in the transmembrane region in
MIP members. Homology models were used to identify
the ar/R constriction in all three plant species. Structural
characterization based on the ar/R signatures showed that
TIP, NIP and SIP members from rice and maize have selectivity filters in the ar/R region that are not found in Arabidopsis. A subclass of NIP members has been found to have
the constriction with the largest pore diameter since three
of the four residues in the ar/R tetrad are small. A recently
discovered rice silicon transporter [65] belongs to this
group. Members of this subgroup could thus represent a
novel group of plant MIPs. SIP members with their unusual ar/R tetrad suggest that their substrate specificity
could be very different from known characterized MIP
genes. In summary, while the subfamilies diverge in the
ar/R signatures that can be directly related to the selectivity of the substrates, a strong conservation of small and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/27

polar residues at the helix-helix interfaces indicates that
such group conservation is intended to keep the integrity
of the "hour-glass" right-handed helical bundle structures
in MIP family members. Now that the functional diversity
of plant aquaporins has been recognized [67], characterization of novel plant MIPs, identification of new substrates that are transported by these proteins and
mechanism of the transport will become the focus of
future research that will eventually attempt to answer
some of the important questions regarding the role of
plant MIPs in root water uptake, reproduction or photosynthesis.

Methods
Homology modeling of plant MIPs
Modeling of rice, maize and Arabidopsis aquaporins was
carried out in two stages. In the first stage, MODELLER
[55,68] software package (version 7v7) was used to construct homology models of all the three plant aquaporin
proteins. MODELLER derives distance and dihedral angle
restraints on the target sequence from its alignment with
template 3-D structures and these relationships are
expressed as conditional probability density functions.
The spatial restraints thus derived and stereochemistry
enforced by CHARMM22 force-field terms [69] are combined into an objective function and this function is minimized by an optimization procedure during model
building. It has been shown that in MODELLER, using
more than one template usually improves the quality of
the model [70]. Hence for each of the plant MIP sequence,
three high-resolution aquaporin structures [bovine AQP1
(PDB ID: 1J4N; [16], E. coli GlpF (PDB ID: 1FX8; [17] and
chain B of E. coli AQPZ (PDB ID: 1RC2; [18] were used as
templates simultaneously in the comparative modeling
procedure.

Pairwise sequence alignments between each plant MIP
member and the three template sequences were carried
out using the 'GAP' program available in the GCG package. Scoring matrix was BLOSUM62 and default values
were used for all other parameters. The pairwise sequence
identities between members of the MIP subfamilies and
the three template sequences (AQP1, GlpF and AQPZ)
range from 22.0 to 46% (Table 6). Among the subfamily
members, the PIPs are the most closely related to the template sequences and the SIPs are the most distant family
members. A multiple structural alignment based on iterative least-squares superposition technique was first carried
out on the three template structures. Template sequences
thus aligned based on the structural superposition were
then used for aligning the target sequence. A dynamic programming method as implemented in MODELLER using
"variable gap opening penalty" is used to align the target
sequence with the template sequences. This gap penalty
avoids placing gaps in secondary structural elements and

favours gap in exposed regions and curved parts of the
main-chain. Since sequence-structure alignment is a vital
step in the model building process, we further checked the
target-template alignment manually and gaps in the middle of the helices or in the conserved loops B or E were
removed. The knowledge of strictly conserved residues in
the transmembrane region reported in the aquaporin
sequence analysis studies [71] has been used to further
refine the target-template alignment. The residues E17 in
TM1, Q103 in TM3, E144 in TM4 and P218 in TM6 (1J4N
numbering) are highly conserved and hence alignments
in these transmembrane segments have less ambiguity. In
a few cases, the alignment was manually adjusted so that
the conserved residues in the respective positions are
brought under the same column. The default AS1 scoring
matrix was used. The resultant alignment was given as
input to MODELLER to build models with 'very fast' simulated annealing protocol. For each target sequence, 10
final models were created and the model with the lowest
objective function value was selected. The loops of this
model were further refined using MODELLER'S loop optimization procedure.
Prediction of side-chain conformation is an important
component of the modeling procedure. In the second
stage, we have used a side-chain prediction algorithm,
SCWRL3 [56,72], on the MODELLER-generated structure.
SCWRL3 uses graph theory to solve the combinatorial
problem encountered in the side-chain refinement. This
algorithm was used to build side-chains of the non-conserved residues on the backbone models generated by
MODELLER. Finally, this model was subjected to 200
steps of steepest descent and 200 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization methods using GROMACS
[73,74]. The stereochemical quality of all the models was
evaluated using PROCHECK [75,76].
Analysis of the pore dimensions of MIP structural models
has been carried out using the program HOLE [63,77]. In
this algorithm, a Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedure is used that finds a best path for a sphere with a variable radius to squeeze through the channel. Initially, the
model was superposed on the crystal structure of AQP1
(PDB ID: 1J4N) using the "Structure Alignment" option
available in the "Homology" module of InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). This enables easier comparison of
pore diameter profiles of different models and hence the
coordinates of the superposed structure were used to analyze the pore dimensions. The initial point within the
channel is taken as the average of Cα coordinates of the
two conserved asparagines (Asn 78 and Asn 194 in 1J4N
numbering) and a third residue (Val 178 in 1J4N or an
equivalent residue in other models) from TM5 which is
located on the channel wall opposite to the conserved
asparagines. An initial vector of <0, 0, -1> was specified.
AMBER [78]-based van der Waals radius file was used in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/27

the calculation of pore dimensions. Crystal structure studies [79] and molecular dynamics simulations [80] suggest
that Arg side chain in LE2 position can exist in two distinct
conformations, one that maintains a continuous single
file of water molecules and the other that completely
occludes the channel. It is suggested that alteration
between the two conformations can regulate the open
probability of the water pore and hence such a fluctuation
is proposed to be a good candidate for a possible gating
mechanism in aquaporins. In the HOLE calculations, our
aim is to find the pore diameter in the open state of the
channel. Hence in all the homology models of plant
MIPs, the sidechain dihedral angles of Arg in LE2 position
were constructed similar to that of water-specific AQP1
channel (PDB ID: 1J4N).
Validity of the modeling protocol
To test the validity of the approach, we constructed
homology models of spinach plasma membrane
aquaporin SoPIP2;1. The SoPIP2;1 sequence has 30–44%
identity with the three template sequences. A comparison
of the experimentally determined structure showed that
RMSD of Cα-trace is 4.16 Å and if only the transmembrane helical regions are considered, it is 1.06 Å. In the
generated SoPIP2;1 model, a slight improvement in the
RMSD of transmembrane helices is seen after side chain
refinement and minimization. The superposed experimental and model SoPIP2;1 structures are shown in Figure 7. The helical backbone and the ar/R selectivity filter
residues of the model structure are in excellent agreement
with the X-ray structure. Small deviations are observed in
the termini of transmembrane helices. It has been shown
that use of more than one template structure generally
increases the accuracy of the models [70]. Hence in the
present study, three templates (PDB IDs: 1J4N, 1FX8 and
1RC2-B chain) were chosen for modeling the plant MIPs.
