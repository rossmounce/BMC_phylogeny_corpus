Abstract
Background: Evolutionary biologists want to explain the origin of novel features and functions.
Two recent but separate lines of research address this question. The first describes one possible
outcome of hybridization, called transgressive segregation, where hybrid offspring exhibit trait
distributions outside of the parental range. The second considers the explicit mapping of form to
function and illustrates manifold paths to similar function (called many to one mapping, MTOM)
when the relationship between the two is complex. Under this scenario, functional novelty may be
a product of the number of ways to elicit a functional outcome (i.e., the degree of MTOM). We
fuse these research themes by considering the influence of MTOM on the production of
transgressive jaw biomechanics in simulated hybrids between Lake Malawi cichlid species.
Results: We characterized the component links and functional output (kinematic transmission,
KT) of the 4-bar mechanism in the oral jaws of Lake Malawi cichlids. We demonstrated that the
input and output links, the length of the lower jaw and the length of the maxilla respectively, have
consistent but opposing relationships with KT. Based on these data, we predicted scenarios in
which species with different morphologies but similar KT (MTOM species) would produce
transgressive function in hybrids. We used a simple but realistic genetic model to show that
transgressive function is a likely outcome of hybridization among Malawi species exhibiting MTOM.
Notably, F2 hybrids are transgressive for function (KT), but not the component links that contribute
to function. In our model, transgression is a consequence of recombination and assortment among
alleles specifying the lengths of the lower jaw and maxilla.
Conclusion: We have described a general and likely pervasive mechanism that generates
functional novelty. Simulations of hybrid offspring among Lake Malawi cichlids exhibiting MTOM
produce transgressive function in the majority of cases, and at appreciable frequency. Functional
transgression (i) is a product of recombination and assortment between alleles controlling the
lengths of the lower jaw and the maxilla, (ii) occurs in the absence of transgressive morphology,
and (iii) can be predicted from the morphology of parents. Our genetic model can be tested by
breeding Malawi cichlid hybrids in the laboratory and examining the resulting range of forms and
functions.

Background
Biologists are captivated by the evolution of new forms
and functions [1]. Over large evolutionary scales, new
traits like oxygen metabolism [2], flowers [3], limbs [4]
and the vertebrate neural crest [5] have facilitated the ecological and numerical dominance of the lineages that possess them. On more recent timescales, organisms adapt to
their environments by continued innovation and modification of these features. A growing literature seeks to
explain the genetic and developmental mechanisms of
both macro- and micro-evolutionary novelty [6].
Two recent but largely separate lines of research address
the question. The first amounts to a renaissance in our
understanding of the evolutionary role of hybridization
[7,8]. Hybrid organisms are generally unfit when compared to parent populations [9]. However, hybrids may
have greater fitness than their parents in extreme environments [10], when environments fluctuate [11], or after
environmental and/or human disturbance [12]. Hybridization contributes to 'creative' evolution in two major
ways: by (i) providing hybridizing species with genetic
variation for adaptive traits, or (ii) producing new species.
Hybrid origin (or hybrid swarm) theories of evolutionary
radiation combine these two ideas [13,14]. As an example
of (i), Grant et al. [15] used long-term study of Darwin's
finches to show that directional introgression of alleles
from Geospiza fortis to G. scandens, coupled with natural
selection, could explain trends in beak shape and body
size. The work of Rieseberg and colleagues on Helianthus
sunflowers provides one of the best examples of (ii).
Hybrid speciation in Helianthus is a product of chromosomal rearrangement [16] and ecological selection acting
on pleiotropic genes in remote habitats [10]. Helianthus
hybrid species specialize in extreme environments, where
they out-compete their parents [17]. This phenomenon of
transgressive segregation (TS), in which hybrids outperform parental forms, is more common than once
believed. Rieseberg and others [18] summarized data
from 1229 traits in 171 experiments and found that 91%
of studies reported at least one transgressive trait and that
44% of traits were transgressive overall.
Importantly, Rieseberg et al. [18] also considered the
genetic architecture of TS and proposed that complementary action of genes with additive effects was the major
cause. Complementary gene action works as follows (see
also Table 1 of [18]): species A (large) segregates 6 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for size and 4 of these contribute
phenotypic effects of 'large,' while 2 contribute phenotypic effects of 'small;' species B (small) also segregates 6
QTL for size, 4 of which contribute phenotypic effects of
'small,' while 2 contribute phenotypic effects of 'large.'
Species A and B produce hybrids that intercross to produce F2; after recombination and independent assort-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/122

ment, some F2 are larger than parent A (e.g., F2 with 6
'large' QTL) and some are smaller than parent B (e.g.,
those with 6 'small' QTL). Thus, complementary gene
action may be a general genetic mechanism of TS.
An upshot of this reasoning was that traits experiencing a
history of strong directional selection were less likely to
exhibit TS [19]. This was codified in Orr's QTL sign test
[20], which compares the distribution of direction of QTL
effects to a random expectation, as a quantitative genetic
metric of directional selection. Albertson and Kocher [21]
extended this logic to argue that directional selection and
genetic architecture limit the evolutionary role of TS.
Using Malawi cichlid hybrids, they showed that lower jaw
shape, a trait under strong directional selection [22], did
not exhibit TS while the shape of the neurocranium, a trait
not under directional selection, did. They concluded that
natural selection might constrain the degree of diversification that can be achieved via hybridization. This might
hold, in particular, for aspects of the craniofacial skeleton
involved in feeding, including the shape of skeletal components, the dentition, and simple levers involved in jaw
function [22-24].
A second line of research targeting the evolution of novelty departs from a concentration on trait morphology per
se and instead focuses on function, or more specifically
the relationship between form and function. Investigators
have contrasted the relationship between shape and biomechanics for simple versus more complex lever systems
in fish jaws to illustrate a general principle of organismal
design [25]. For instance, the 4-bar linkage system (Figure
1) models the rotation of the maxilla given a known input
of lower jaw depression. The output of the model can be
computed by geometry when component lengths and
angles are measured. As with simpler, two component
lever systems, one can estimate kinematic transmission
(KT), in this case the amount of motion transmitted to the
maxilla, through the linkage system, from lower jaw
depression [26]. Jaw linkages with higher maxillary KT
transmit more motion through the system and are predicted to evolve in fishes that feed on elusive prey [27]. In
contrast to simple levers, morphological variation is only
a modest predictor of KT for the 4-bar system [25]. Many
different morphological designs can yield similar values
of maxillary KT [26]; this is called many to one mapping
(MTOM) of form to function. In essence, MTOM is an
example of functional redundancy. Diverse lineages that
exhibit MTOM may be predisposed to evolutionary novelty, because manifold solutions exist among species for
new ecological or functional demands [25]. MTOM of
form to function may be a general property of all but the
simplest biomechanical systems and may influence system diversity, robustness, modularity and evolvability in
complex ways [28].

in relative lengths of input and output links for these high and low KT exemplars.

We reasoned that MTOM of form to function might contribute to functional transgression in hybrid offspring. Just
as complementary gene action describes hybrid trait transgression as the piling up of QTL of the same direction
(e.g., 'large') from different parental genomes, we envisioned scenarios in which MTOM parental species might
segregate 4-bar links to hybrids in combinations producing biomechanical output (KT) well beyond the parental
range. To evaluate this possibility, we characterized the 4bar mechanism in Lake Malawi cichlids and simulated
hybrids using a simple but realistic genetic model. Lake
Malawi cichlids are apposite study organisms for this
question. They exhibit tremendous morphological diversity on a background of genomic mosaicism [[29,30], Loh
et al. 2008 in review]. Species hybridize in the wild [3133] and speculation persists that hybridization has contributed to the adaptive radiation of this species flock
[13]. Our simulations demonstrate that transgressive
function is a likely outcome of hybridization among
Malawi species exhibiting MTOM. Functional transgression is a product of recombination and assortment
between alleles controlling the lengths of the lower jaw
and the maxilla, occurs in the absence of transgressive
morphology, and can be predicted from the morphology
of parents.

Results and Discussion
Diversity and correlation in the Malawi 4-bar linkage
We calculated maxillary KT from 86 Lake Malawi cichlid
species (169 individual fishes) sampled in July 2005 or
borrowed from the American Museum of Natural History.

Malawi species exhibit a wide spread of KT values (range
for individuals, 0.41 â 1.57; Figure 2; [see Additional file
1 for species averages]) comparable to that observed in
other fish lineages [34,35]. The bulk of the specimens had
KT values between 0.61 â 0.80 (avg. = 0.77; sd. = 0.16),
corresponding to putatively intermediate jaw speeds and
force potentials. Planktivores, on average, exhibited
higher maxillary KT than other trophic groups [see Additional file 2]. The input (lower jaw, r = 0.473; p < 0.0005)
and output (maxilla, r = -0.379; p < 0.0005) links were significantly and antagonistically correlated with KT across
the data set (Table 1).
We next asked whether correlations among links and KT
were robust to the pattern of Malawi cichlid evolutionary
history. It has been known for some time that trait correlations should be corrected for phylogeny because related
individuals do not represent independent statistical samples [36]. This is a particularly important and difficult
problem in the Malawi cichlid assemblage where species
are young (e.g., 1000 years, [29]) and phylogenetic resolution is limited [30,37]. Table 1 (above the diagonal)
shows evolutionarily independent correlations calculated
using the phylogenetic topology shown in Additional file
3, employing an approach described in Hulsey et al. [30].
We use a single mitochondrial genealogy because the
locus offers more resolution than nuclear genes in this
rapidly evolving lineage [30,37]. The corrected correlations are similar to the uncorrected in all but one case. The
lower jaw link, positively associated with KT using uncorrected data, is not associated with KT across the Malawi

lengths was a near perfect predictor of the fully parameterized calculation of KT (Figure 3; r2 = 0.94; p < 0.0005).
Our data point to an appreciable linear component to variation in this 4-bar linkage system noted for its non-linear
evolutionary dynamics [25,26].

Given this caveat, our empirical data support results from
simulation in other studies [25,26]: longer lower jaws on
average yield higher values of KT while longer maxillae
produce the opposite (see also Figure 1). Notably, lower
jaw and maxillary links were positively correlated with
one another in our data set (corrected r2 = 0.44; p <
0.0005; Table 1). Moreover, a simple ratio of LJ/Max

Comparison of species' trait values (corrected for body
size) identified numerous cases of convergence in KT via
divergence in link length, or MTOM of form to function
[25]. The correlations noted above help to explain this
observation. For example, both Cynotilapia afra and Pseudotropheus elongatus have KT values of approximately 0.7,
but they exhibit distinct morphologies. Cynotilapia afra
has relatively long input and output links, while P. elongatus has relatively short elements of each. We reasoned
that hybridization between species like these that are
MTOM for function might produce F2 hybrids with
extreme KT values, if independent assortment recombines
the long lower jaw of C. afra with the short maxilla of P.
elongatus (high KT) or the long maxilla of C. afra with the
short lower jaw of P. elongatus (low KT). We tested the generality of this prediction using a simple, but realistic
genetic model.

Malawi cichlids are similar for uncorrected (below the diagonal)

A simple ratio of input (lower jaw) to output (maxilla) links is strongly positively correlated with the fully

Simulated hybrids of MTOM species are transgressive in
function
Our Mendelian genetic model assumes no evolution and
no environmental variance (VE = 0). We specified that
size-standardized lengths of each of the four linkage components (Figure 1) were controlled by 4 independent loci
(2 alleles at each locus). Links themselves were modeled
to be genetically independent of one another. The effect of
each allele was assumed to be equal and additive. Importantly, the assumptions of (i) number of loci per link, (ii)
genetic independence of links and (iii) additivity of allelic
affects are supported by empirical quantitative genetic
data for the cichlid craniofacial skeleton [22]. For example, even though the lower jaw and maxilla links are positively (phenotypically) correlated in our data set, this is
unlikely to be due to genetic linkage; QTL for the shape of
these elements map to distinct chromosomal regions. We
used this model to (a) determine if MTOM species would
produce hybrids transgressive for function, (b) estimate
the percentage of F2 progeny exhibiting transgression from
specific Lake Malawi cichlid intercrosses, and (c) investigate the genetic contribution of each link to the phenomenon of functional transgression.

We assumed that each F0 parent was homozygous at every
locus; since every allele had additive and equal effects, no
transgression was produced in the physical lengths of 4bar links. By contrast, transgression in 4-bar function (KT)
was found in 80% of simulated crosses (16/20, Table 2)
in which we calculated KT for each and every of 6,561
composite F2 genotypes. Note that we have employed a
modified and conservative definition of transgression,
specific to the distribution of KT produced by the model;
an individual is 'transgressive' if its KT value lies Â± 1 standard deviation (or more) from the mean. The frequency of
transgressive individuals, per cross, ranged from 0.1 â
34%, with up to 6% of the KT values lying two (or more)
standard deviations beyond the mean for some (e.g., C.
afra Ã P. elongatus; Figure 4).
We used bubble plots to examine the genetic limits to
transgression in each of the simulated crosses and the distribution of those limits among the four link lengths (Figure 5). These plots show the frequency of parental (F0)
alleles for each link in F2 hybrids exhibiting transgressive
KT, where hybrid KT is lower (A, C) or higher (B, D) than
parental values. For example, in the cross between Cynotilapia afra and Pseudotropheus elongatus, transgressive KT
lower than parental values (Figure 5A) is possible with

ing morphology of the parents (F0) and the noted relationship (from simulation and our empirical data above)
between the input link (lower jaw), output link (maxilla)
and KT. Both Pseudotropheus elongatus and Protomelas fenestratus have short maxillae and short lower jaws; Cynotilapia afra and Protomelas ornatus possess long elements of
each. Recombination and independent assortment of alleles controlling lower jaw and maxillary links produce
functional transgression in KT, according to this model.
Our choice of the 20 crosses to analyze presents a biased
estimate of the proportion of crosses that would yield TS.
However, because of the computation involved, a full
analysis of all possible crosses in our data set is prohibitive. To overcome this, we realized that the simple ratio of
lower jaw length to maxilla length is a strong predictor of
KT from the fully parameterized calculation (Figure 3).
We also realized, from the detailed analysis of the genetic

model above, that transgression is usually produced by
recombination between loci specifying the lengths of the
lower jaw and maxilla. Combining these ideas, we devised
a test to ask whether all pairwise crosses between any two
of the 86 species in our data set would produce F2 hybrids
transgressive for KT. We generated a matrix encompassing
all possible pair-wise combinations of size-adjusted lower
jaw and maxilla lengths from all species in the data set.
Roughly a third of these combinations (29%) produced
transgression in KT value. We next used these data to ask
whether the occurrence of transgression in F2 could be predicted by the degree to which parents (F0) are MTOM. As
a proxy for MTOM, we used a simple metric of KT distance
between the parents of any cross. Formally, if MTOM contributes to hybrid transgression in KT, we expect crosses
that produce transgressive hybrids to be between parental
species with smaller differences in starting KT. This is in
fact what we observed (Figure 6; t-test, p < 0.001).

mouth. Mismatches in the length of upper and lower jaw
elements may have negative functional ramifications that
outweigh increased performance in jaw speed.

beyond the 5th and 95th percentiles.

Conclusion
We have described a general and likely pervasive mechanism that generates functional novelty. Simulated hybrid
offspring among Lake Malawi cichlids exhibiting MTOM
are transgressive for function at appreciable frequency.
Our modeling approach is noteworthy because it allows
us to identify morphological components of the 4-bar
mechanical system that contribute to TS. Functional transgression is a product of recombination and assortment
between alleles controlling the lengths of the lower jaw
and the maxilla and occurs in the absence of transgressive
morphology. Transgression occurs when link lengths
approaching parental values assort in new combinations
in the F2 generation. Novel function therefore is realized
via new morphological combinations, but not transgressive lengths for any single link. Our model can be tested
by breeding Malawi cichlid hybrids in the lab and examining the morphological and mechanical diversity of their
4-bar linkages.
It is important to comment that the model we present
shows how MTOM of form to function in the Malawi
cichlid 4-bar linkage could generate TS in jaw biomechanics. One question raised by the modeling results is why
mbuna species have not evolved higher maxillary KT
(mbuna range = 0.58 â 0.85). What maintains the positive
phenotypic correlation between the lower jaw and maxilla
links? One possibility is functional constraint imposed by
other aspects of the feeding apparatus. For example, the
lower jaw and maxilla both function to position the oral

Recombinational evolution, MTOM and the limits to
functional diversity
The genomic era has changed the way that evolutionary
biologists think about hybridization. Gene flow among
recently diverged species (or those evolved through premating barriers) is common rather than the exception
[13,15,29]. Hybridization may provide an important
source of genetic variation in the form of new trait combinations [10] that sometimes help hybrid organisms
maneuver across fitness landscapes [14]. The phenomenon of TS, wherein hybrids outperform the parents, is a
frequent observation in laboratory and natural outcrossings [18].

It has been suggested that strong directional selection and
simple genetic architecture should limit TS because they
point the phenotypic effects of QTL in the same direction;
this would essentially constrain diversification by hybridization [21]. Our analysis shows how MTOM promotes TS
in function, without transgressive morphology, via
recombination and independent assortment. Because
multiple morphological solutions exist for any function
(i.e., value of KT), MTOM may buffer those constraints,
imposed by directional selection, on the extent of
mechanical diversity produced by hybridization. As the
craniofacial skeleton evolves, functional demands of
numerous mechanical systems shape the lengths and linkages of bony elements [28]. MTOM of form to function in
each of these systems might facilitate, or perhaps even
require, the evolution of diversity.

Methods
Specimen information
Cichlid specimens were collected during July 2005 from
various sites in southern Lake Malawi. Fishes were labeled
with a unique identifier and fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution. Upon returning to the U.S., carcasses were
transferred to 70% ethanol for storage. Additional specimens were borrowed from the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) to supplement the collection. Up to
three individuals of each species (depending on the
number available) were cleared with trypsin and doublestained using alcian-blue (cartilage) and alizarin-red
(bone). This method allows clear visualization of the skeletal components while maintaining skull articulations
[27]. Cleared and stained fish were transferred to glycerin
for storage.

Morphometrics and correlation
We measured the anterior jaw 4-bar linkage model as
described [26,38,39]. The four physical units of the linkage were quantified on 169 specimens of 86 Lake Malawi
cichlid species. Up to three individuals were measured for
each species using dial calipers (nearest 0.1 mm) to quantify each link (Figure 1). The four links (lower jaw or
input, maxilla or output, nasal or coupler, and fixed or
suspensorium) are described in detail, with their respective measurement landmarks, by Hulsey and Wainwright
[26]. The linkage measurements were used to calculate the
kinematic transmission (KT) of each jaw [27]. Anterior
jaw KT is used as an estimate of the speed of motion transmitted through the 4-bar linkage, and in addition, the
measurement of KT simultaneously describes the force
transmission (FT) through the 4-bar as the reciprocal of
KT [26]. The method of KT calculation followed that of
Hulsey and Garcia de LeÃ³n [27] and was accomplished
using an iterative function in Microsoft ExcelÂ® with a starting angle of 15Â° and an input angle of 30Â°.

Correlations were calculated between each of the 4-bar
links and KT to examine the relationship therein. Because
the structural components of the anterior jaw are highly
correlated with body size [[26], NFP unpublished] each 4bar link was corrected for fish standard length (SL) prior
to correlation. We used the residuals of linear regression
of link length to SL. Felsenstein [36] has shown that correlations may not be statistically independent when compared across taxa with common evolutionary history.
Therefore, we calculated phylogenetically independent
contrasts following an approach outlined in Hulsey et al.
[30]. We constructed a phylogeny of 52 Lake Malawi species using sequences from the mitochondrial ND2 gene
[see Additional file 1, Additional file 3]. All species were
collected from the wild in Lake Malawi from various locations. DNA extractions, PCR parameters, and sequencing
followed previously published protocols [30].
The ND2 gene was transformed into its three codon partitions. ModelTest 3.06 [40] was used to identify the most
likely model of molecular evolution for each codon partition. Standard Bayesian analyses were executed to find the
maximum log-likelihood topology using MrBayes 3.0
[41]. Independent contrast analyses were performed using
CAIC [42] in order to assess correlations among the SLcorrected residuals of the four link lengths and among
those values and KT. We employed the highest log-likelihood tree from the above Bayesian search to correct for
phylogeny [Additional file 3].
Genetic model of hybrid crosses
Several approaches can be taken to model the generation
of novelty in jaw structures and for this project we chose a
simple genetic model. Previous studies have examined

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/122

how 4-bar function changes with different structural configurations, as well as how the 4-bar can evolve based on
selection for different KT [25,26,43,44]. Also, Albertson
and Kocher [21] have examined the phenotypic distribution of one interspecific Lake Malawi cross in terms of cranial and jaw morphology. For this paper we wanted a
model that would not only describe the distribution of
genotypes and phenotypes for specific intercrosses, but
also allow the incorporation of empirical data from the
Lake Malawi system.
We constructed a simple but realistic individual-based
Mendelian genetic model, which incorporated assumptions of no mutation, no selection, and no error. We
assumed that the size-standardized (below) length of each
of the four anterior jaw links was controlled by 4 independent loci with 2 alleles at each locus, for a total of 8
alleles per link. Links themselves were modeled to be
genetically independent of one another. The effect of each
allele was assumed to be equal and additive, and therefore
each of the four lengths (lower jaw, maxilla, nasal, fixed)
for each parental (or F0) specimen was divided by 8. Note
that the assumptions of (i) number of loci per link, (ii)
independence of links and (iii) additivity of allelic affects
are supported by empirical quantitative genetic data for
the cichlid craniofacial skeleton [22]. We controlled for
differences in body size among species in the model by
dividing each parental link length by SL. In this way, the
heritable unit of link length can be thought of as the proportion of SL made up by each link. We also ran models
using residuals from linear regression of link length on SL
as input variables, and this did not change the outcome.
Using this rubric, each allele inherited from a parent
would impart 1/8th of the total length of that link to the
offspring. Parents were assumed to be homozygous at all
loci. The initial cross among F0 produced F1 progeny with
identical 4-bar lengths (and KT values) equal to the average of the two parents. A second cross within the F1 progeny produced all potential parental and recombinant
genotypes in the F2 generation (6,561 possible). Hybrid
link lengths were calculated by the summation of all
allelic contributions totaled over the four loci per link.
Thus, each composite F2 genotype was assigned a 4-link
phenotype, and KT was calculated for all. Some recombinant link lengths did not support a functional jaw linkage in some crosses. This result was taken to represent
potentially unfit hybrid individuals within a cross and
these individuals were left out of further analyses; this
effect has been noted in prior simulation [26]. Frequency
distributions of F2 progeny were created (MS ExcelÂ® and
SigmaPlotÂ® 8.0) to compare hybrid KT values to parental
KT. Bubble plots were generated (SigmaPlotÂ® 8.0) to
examine the contribution of parental alleles to link length
in F2 exhibiting transgressive KT. A total of 20 interspecific

crosses were simulated with this model and F2 KT values
were examined for evidence of transgression. Species were
chosen for these 20 iterations (i) if there is a report of
hybridization between them in nature, (ii) if laboratory
hybrids have been made, or (iii) if we were particularly
interested in the cross from inspection of parental morphometrics.
These 20 simulated crosses present a biased look at the
possibility of transgressive function in Lake Malawi cichlid hybrids. The calculations are iterative and time consuming. We wanted an unbiased means to ask if a hybrid
cross between any two species would produce F2 with
transgressive KT. To accomplish this, we made use of the
tight relationship between the fully parameterized model
of KT and the simpler ratio of input to output links (Figure
3) and the relationship between input link, output link
and KT observed in our data (see Results) and from previous simulation [25,26]. We generated a 86 Ã 86 species
matrix containing all possible combinations of sizeadjusted lower jaw and maxilla lengths from all species in
the data set (7,310 combinations). We essentially asked if
recombining the maxilla from one species with the lower
jaw from the other (and vice versa) would produce hybrid
linkages transgressive in KT. We carried out this operation
for all pairs of species in the data set.
