Abstract
Background: Ferlins are membrane proteins with multiple C2 domains and proposed functions
in Ca2+ mediated membrane-membrane interactions in animals. Caenorhabditis elegans has two ferlin
genes, one of which is required for sperm function. Mammals have several ferlin genes and
mutations in the human dysferlin (DYSF) and otoferlin (OTOF) genes result in muscular dystrophy and
hearing loss, respectively. Drosophila melanogaster has a single ferlin gene called misfire (mfr). A
previous study showed that a mfr mutation caused male sterility because of defects in fertilization.
Here we analyze the expression and structure of the mfr gene and the consequences of multiple
mutations to better understand the developmental function of ferlins.
Results: We show that mfr is expressed in the testis and ovaries of adult flies, has tissue-specific
promoters, and expresses alternatively spliced transcripts that are predicted to encode distinct
protein isoforms. Studies of 11 male sterile mutations indicate that a predicted Mfr testis isoform
with five C2 domains and a transmembrane (TM) domain is required for sperm plasma membrane
breakdown (PMBD) and completion of sperm activation during fertilization. We demonstrate that
Mfr is not required for localization of Sneaky, another membrane protein necessary for PMBD. The
mfr mutations vary in their effects in females, with a subset disrupting egg patterning and causing a
maternal effect delay in early embryonic development. Locations of these mutations indicate that
a short Mfr protein isoform carries out ferlin activities during oogenesis.
Conclusion: The mfr gene exhibits complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation
and functions in three developmental processes: sperm activation, egg patterning, and early
embryogenesis. These functions are in part due to the production of protein isoforms that vary in
the number of C2 domains. These findings help establish D. melanogaster as model system for
understanding ferlin function and dysfunction in animals, including humans.

Background
Membrane-membrane interactions play key roles in animal physiology and development, and one protein family
that has been implicated in these interactions is the ferlins. In mammals, there are four ferlin genes: dysferlin

(DYSF), myoferlin (MYOF), otoferlin (OTOF), and ferlin-1like 4 (FER1L4) [1]. In Caenorhabditis elegans, there are
two: fertilization defective-1 (fer-1) and fertilization defective
like-1 (ferl-1) [2]. D. melanogaster has one ferlin gene, misfire (mfr) [3]. Thus far, ferlins have been characterized by

multiple C2 domains (between four and six) and a transmembrane (TM) domain near the C-terminus [1]. C2
domains are independently folded units of ~130 amino
acids that form parallel β-sheets connected by surface
loops. They are present in many proteins involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking, such as protein kinase C, phospholipase, and synaptotagmin, and
have the capacity to bind substrates that include Ca2+,
phospholipids, inositol polyphosphates, and phosphotyrosines [4-6].
The specific roles and binding partners of the ferlin C2
domains, which are denoted C2A-C2F, are largely
unknown. At least a subset are proposed to bind Ca2+
since the activities of mammalian and C. elegans ferlins are
Ca2+-mediated [1,2,7-10]. A study using an in vitro assay
to measure changes in fluorescence emission spectrum
after Ca2+ binding, suggested that the C2D domain of
mouse OTOF has Ca2+ binding capacity [9]. In addition,
in vitro assays have been used to document differences
among the C2 domains in human DYSF and MYOF. Of
the six C2 domains in these proteins, only C2A, which
resides closest to the N-terminus, was found to bind phospholipid vesicles in a Ca2+ dependent manner [7,10].
The functional roles of ferlins are revealed by the detrimental effects of gene disruptions. An important example
occurs in the skeletal muscles of mice and humans with
mutations in the DYSF gene [11,12]. Current data suggest
that DYSF, which is localized to intracellular vesicles, acts
to repair skeletal muscle membrane tears by permitting
vesicle fusion and creating a plasma membrane patch
[1,8]. In humans lacking normal DYSF, muscle membrane tears are inefficiently repaired, and, consequently,
two forms of muscular dystrophy, Limb Girdle Muscular
Dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi Myopathy, can develop
[11,12].
Other members of the ferlin protein family have also been
implicated in membrane-membrane interactions. Mutations in mammalian OTOF cause a form of autosomal
recessive deafness known as DFNB9 due to problems with
synaptic vesicle exocytosis in inner ear hair cells [9,13,14].
Although MYOF has not yet been associated with a disease
phenotype, it is localized to closely apposed membranes
in a cell-culture model of muscle differentiation and
myoblasts from MYOF null mice do not fuse efficiently
[10]. Mutations in C. elegans fer-1 affect the fusion of
Golgi-derived membranous organelles with spermatid
plasma membrane [2,15]. As a result, the spermatids fail
to mature into motile sperm, causing male sterility. The
functions of mammalian FER1L4 and C. elegans FERL-1
are not yet known [1,2].

Ohsako et al. [16] previously reported that the D. melanogaster mfr gene is specifically required for male fertility
and fertilization. This conclusion was based on a phenotypic analysis of only a single mutant allele. Here we characterized the mfr gene and showed that it has a complex
transcriptional profile, with testis- and ovary-specific promoters and alternatively spliced transcripts that predict
multiple isoforms. Through studies of 11 mfr mutations,
we confirmed a role for mfr in sperm function and discovered roles in egg patterning and early embryogenesis.
Together, the molecular and genetic studies permitted a
correlation of ferlin structure with function and provided
evidence that mfr carries out its multiple developmental
roles using different protein isoforms.

Results
Mutations in the mfr gene have been recovered in two
independent screens for male sterile mutations [16,17].
Here, we describe 11 alleles that were recovered from the
screen of Wakimoto et al., [17] as strong male sterile
mutations. We classified these mutations as arresting
sperm activation based on similarity to the phenotype
induced by mutations in the snky gene [18]. Genetic mapping and complementation tests with mfr1 [16] confirmed
these mutant alleles are new mfr alleles. To understand
effects on ferlin function, we molecularly characterized
the mfr gene and the mutant alleles.
The mfr gene exhibits complex transcriptional regulation
As reported by Yamamoto and Ohsako [3], mfr corresponds to CG5747, whose structure was predicted by the
Drosophila Genome Project [19]. The lack of mfr ESTs
recovered from various cDNA screens [20,21] and failure
to detect mfr transcripts on Northern blots containing
poly A+ RNA from 1,000 testes, 500 ovaries, and male and
female carcasses (data not shown), indicates that mfr transcripts may be rare. Consequently, we used RT-PCR to
search for mfr transcripts and detected transcripts in the
testes and ovaries, but not in the carcasses of adult flies
that lacked gonads (Figure 1A).

To determine the mfr transcript structure, we performed 5'
and 3' RACE using poly A+ RNA isolated from testes and
ovaries. Sequence analysis of 10 testicular and 15 ovarian
5' RACE products revealed multiple transcriptional start
sites (Figure 1B). All six of the identified testis transcription start sites mapped within a 35 bp region. This pattern
of multiple nearby start sites is characteristic of a slippery
promoter, which has previously been described by Yasuhara et al., [22] for other Drosophila genes. In contrast, the
three identified ovarian transcription start sites mapped
over a wider span of 516 bp, with each site distinct from
those identified in the testis.

Figure gene is expressed in the testis and ovaries and uses multiple promoters
The mfr 1
The mfr gene is expressed in the testis and ovaries and uses multiple promoters. In (A), an ethidium-bromide
stained gel shows the results of an RT-PCR analysis of transcripts in testes (T), ovaries (O), male carcasses lacking reproductive organs (MC), and female carcasses lacking reproductive organs (FC). Gene specific primers for mfr or yip-6, the ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein L5 gene [44], were used for each tissue sample. In (B), each arrow on the DNA sequence
corresponds to a transcription start site represented by a 5' RACE product from testis (below the sequence) or ovary (above
the sequence). Brackets indicate that either the G or A/C may serve as the actual transcription start site (see Methods). Also
noted are sequences that are highly conserved among Drosophila species (boxed); potential start codons for the longest testis
cDNA (T1) (gray ATG#1–3); and underlined intronic sequences in the 5' UTR of ovary transcripts (underlined lowercase letters are intronic in all six ovarian cDNAs, while underlined uppercase, italicized letters are also intronic in four of the cDNAs).
Release 5.0 coordinate of the D. melanogaster genome sequence is indicated; 300 nts were omitted as indicated by the slashed
lines.

The mfr promoters lack the motifs identified by Ohler et
al. [23] as common to Drosophila promoters. However, we
note two regions of interest as putative regulatory
sequences that are highly conserved among Drosophila
species (Figure 1B). A 22 bp sequence, located just downstream of the 5' most testes transcription start site is also
found in the homologous mfr region in D. simulans, D.
yakuba, D. ananassae, and shows 86% identity in D. pseudoobscura. A 17 bp sequence which is located 87 bp
upstream of the most 5' ovarian start site shows complete
conservation in D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D.
pseudoobscura, and 76% identity in the more distantly
related D. mojavensis, and D. virilis. The location of this
sequence is also within the 5' UTR of Tsp66E, which is
transcribed from the opposite strand of mfr orthologs in

all of these species. Therefore, it may be an important regulatory sequence for either gene.
Sequence of 12 testicular and 10 ovarian 3' RACE products indicated that mfr has a single site for polyadenylation, which is located 103 nt downstream of a predicted
stop codon. Together, the 5' and 3' RACE studies defined
a minimal gene size of 6.761 kb, extending from the most
upstream ovarian start site to the polyadenylation site. An
estimate of maximum gene size was provided by testing a
transgene containing a 10.7 kb genomic fragment for its
ability to rescue mfr mutant phenotypes. Two independent insertions of the transgene fully rescued the mfr male
sterility in a single copy (Table 1) and also rescued a defect
in egg patterning, which is described in more detail below,

in two copies (Table 2). Compared to the 6.761 kb region,
this transgene includes an additional 131 bp of upstream
sequence and ~3.85 kb downstream of the polyadenylation site.
Differential splicing of mfr transcripts predicts tissuespecific protein isoforms
We used the RACE results to design primer sets to recover
near full-length mfr cDNAs from polyA+ selected testis
and ovary RNA. Analysis of six testicular and nine ovarian
cDNAs revised the CG5747 predicted gene structure [19]
and identified differently spliced mRNAs with the potential to yield seven different Mfr protein isoforms (Figures
2 and 3).

The longest cDNA (T1), which was recovered from testis
RNA, contains 14 exons and an open reading frame (ORF)
with three in-frame Met codons located in exon 1 (Figures
1B and 2A). ATG#1 may be the initiating methionine
codon for the mRNA corresponding to cDNA T1 because
the sequences between ATG#1 and ATG#3 in D. melanogaster and its sister species are largely conserved (D.
simulans with 93% identity, D. sechellia 74% identity, D.
yakuba 74% identity, and D. erecta 76% identity), suggesting a selective pressure to maintain the region as coding.
The longest ORF predicts a protein with 1,684 amino
acids, a TM domain near the C-terminus, and five C2
domains (Figure 2B). The C2 domains are denoted C2BC2F based on their homology to C2 domains in mammalian ferlin proteins [2]. Three additional testis cDNAs
(cDNA T2–T4) reflect alternative splicing events that
increase the length of the 5' UTR and shorten the length of
the ORF (Figure 2A). Corresponding protein isoforms are
predicted to have two or three C2 domains, with the
shortest isoform (T4) lacking the TM domain (Figure 2B).
Analysis of nine ovarian cDNAs revealed three different
splicing variants, and all were different from those seen in
testis cDNAs (Figure 3A). The ovarian transcripts vary in
coding capacity and the length of the 5' UTR. Corresponding protein isoforms are predicted to have between one
and three C2 domains, and only isoform O2 is predicted
to have a TM domain (Figure 3B).

mfr mutations indicate that male fertility requires the
longest predicted Mfr isoform
For each of the 11 mfr mutations, we assayed the fertility
of males that were homozygous or hemizygous in combination with deficiencies Df(3L)h-i22 or Df(3L)ED4415.
We also tested the fertility of males with several mfr heteroallelic combinations (see methods). The result in all
cases was strong recessive male sterility, with no progeny
produced from any of the crosses between mfr males and
wild-type females.

To understand how mfr mutation might affect ferlin function, we identified the molecular lesions in each of the 11
mutations. The mutations are distributed throughout the
gene and provide information about the functional significance of predicted isoforms and specific residues (Table 3
and Figure 4). In particular, they implicate isoform T1 as
essential for male fertility as it is the only isoform expected
to be disrupted by all of the mutations. The missense
mutation mfrZ1250, which changes a methionine to an isoleucine, provides additional evidence that ATG#1 (Figure
1B) encodes the initiating methionine. Also, mfrZ6248,
which, like mfrZ1250, is expected to affect only isoform T1,
changes a valine that is conserved in D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, and D. erecta to aspartic acid in the region
of the protein that is predicted to form the C2C domain.
Because valine is a hydrophobic nonpolar amino acid and
aspartic acid is a negatively charged amino acid, the
mfrZ6248 mutation likely disrupts C2C structure. In addition, mfrZ1021 replaces a glycine, which is located between
C2E and C2F, to a serine. This glycine is conserved in all
known and predicted ferlin proteins in other species, indicating a key functional role in ferlins.
Mapping of the mutations also revealed a disproportionately high number of nonsense mutations. Eight mutations are predicted to truncate isoform T1, either by
mutating a splice junction (mfrZ2942) or in seven cases, by
changing an amino acid to a stop codon (Table 3 and Figure 4). Three of the nonsense mutations, mfrZ1386,
mfrZ4070, and mfrZ0695 are the best candidates for mfr null
mutations since they map to the C2E-C2F region that is
shared by all of the predicted testis isoforms.

mfr mutations consistently affect sperm function during
fertilization
To characterize the cause of mfr male sterility, we introduced a transgene that expresses the Don-Juan GFP (DJGFP) sperm tail marker into five different mfr mutant
backgrounds, then monitored efficiency of sperm entry
into the egg. Studies with a control strain show that the
DJ-GFP assay detects 87% of the sperm entry events in
eggs for up to 90 min after egg deposition (see methods).
During normal fertilization, sperm entry is followed by
events of sperm activation, including sperm plasma membrane breakdown (PMBD), nuclear decondensation, and
formation of male pronucleus, in rapid succession. We
found that in 85–100% eggs laid by wild type females
mated to mfr males, sperm entered the egg (Table 4).
However, nearly all retained a highly condensed nucleus
(Figure 5). Three mfr alleles, including two nonsense alleles, occasionally allowed sperm to undergo nuclear
decondensation and reach the pronuclear apposition
stage, but not beyond (Table 4).

Previous studies indicated that the mfr1 allele [16], like
snky mutations [18,24], affects PMBD. To monitor PMBD
in eggs fertilized by sperm produced by mfrZ0695 males, we
used the method of Wilson et al. [24]. Specifically, the
membrane protein CD2 was introduced into the sperm
plasma membrane through expression of a CD2 transgene
during spermatogenesis and its presence was monitored
by immunolocalization before and after sperm entry into
the egg. We found that the CD2 epitope was retained
around the head and tail of mfrZ0695 mutant sperm for at
least 20 min after egg deposition in 83% of the eggs we
monitored (n = 12, Figure 6), supporting an effect of mfr
on PMBD.
Because snky is also important for sperm PMBD [18,24],
Mfr could affect this event by controlling the localization
of Snky. To test this idea, we introduced Snky-GFP into
sperm produced by mfrZ0695 males and assayed GFP
expression. As shown in Figure 7, this mfr nonsense muta-

tion does not alter the localization of Snky-GFP to the
acrosomal membrane [24].
A subset of mfr mutations affects egg patterning
Expression of mfr transcripts in ovaries suggested a possible function during oogenesis. This role was confirmed by
the discovery a recessive egg patterning phenotype
induced by a subset of mfr mutations when expressed in
females. The defect is visible in late stage eggs as abnormally short and closely apposed dorsal appendages (Figure 8A and 8B), a feature of the eggshell that signifies a
ventralized egg chamber [25].

Penetrance of the egg patterning defect varied among the
alleles (Figure 8C), with females hemizygous for the
mfrZ0695, mfrZ1386, or mfrZ4070 allele producing 14–22%
abnormal eggs. The fact that these three nonsense alleles
induced defects, but four nonsense mutations located
upstream of the C2D encoding region do not (Figure 4),
suggests that normal egg patterning requires a short Mfr
isoform. Interestingly, two additional mutations that map
downstream of C2D do not induce egg patterning defects.
These mutations are mfrZ1021, which changes a glycine to
a serine, and mfrZ2942, which mutates a splice junction to
create a premature stop codon in some transcripts. Based
on the locations of the nonsense mutations, the ovarian
transcript that is important for egg patterning likely
encodes the C2E and C2F domains, but does not use the
splice junction affected by the mfrZ2942 mutation. This
structure is not represented among the three identified
ovarian cDNAs.
We note that penetrance of the mutant phenotype in eggs
produced by hemizygous females does not exceed 22% in
any case, indicating that Mfr likely has a redundant function in ovaries. Surprisingly, we found that the percentage
of egg patterning defects significantly increases to as high
as 41% when the mfrZ0695, mfrZ1386, and mfrZ4070 are
placed in heteroallelic combinations (Table 5, Figure 8C).
This observation verifies that Mfr proteins are expressed

Next, we investigated whether the defect might be
accounted for by disruption of Gurken, a key ligand in the
egg patterning pathway. In normal stage 10 egg chambers,
Gurken shows a characteristic distribution in the anterior
dorsal corner of the oocyte. This distribution permits
proper signaling to overlying follicle cells [26]. Follicle
cells that receive the Gurken ligand activate a downstream

pathway that is responsible for the formation and proper
spacing of the dorsal appendages [27]. Immunolocalization of Gurken revealed that in the majority of stage 10
egg chambers produced by control bw;st or mfrZ4070/
mfrZ1386 females, Gurken is properly localized (Figure 9A).
However, in 15% of the bw;st egg chambers (n = 46) and
43% of the mfrZ4070/mfrZ1386 egg chambers (n = 44),
Gurken does not extend as far posteriorly (Figure 9B). A χ2
likelihood ratio test reveals that this difference is statistically significant (P = 0.0025, R2 = 0.0861).

mfr mutations affect female fertility and the progression
of embryogenesis
Mutations in mfr also affect embryonic development.
Notably, only 43% of the total eggs laid by mfrZ4070/

mfrZ1386 mutant females mated to wild-type males hatch
(n = 376 eggs). This hatch rate is similar for eggs with
wild-type eggshell morphology and those with defective

may be separate from its role in egg patterning. Furthermore, the hatch rate of embryos of mfrZ4070/mfrZ1386
mothers is significantly lower than the 84% hatch rate of
embryos produced by the mfrZ4070 or mfrZ1386/TM6 control strain (P < 0.0001 R2 = 0.10 n = 340 eggs) and the 52%
hatch rate observed for the bw;st parent strain (P = 0.0232
R2 = 0.0049 n = 392 eggs).
To determine if the lower hatch rates are caused by visible
defects during early embryonic development, mfrZ4070/
mfrZ1386 and control (mfrZ4070 or mfrZ1386/TM6 and bw;st)
females were mated to wild-type males and a minimum of
150 eggs were collected from each mating at 50 and 90
minutes after egg deposition. The embryos were fixed and
stained with DAPI to visualize nuclei, and then classified
according to mitotic cycle (Figure 10). This analysis
revealed that the development of embryos produced from
mfrZ4070/mfrZ1386 mothers is delayed compared to
embryos produced from mothers of the two control
strains (mfrZ4070 or mfrZ1386/TM6 and bw;st). Furthermore,
an ordinal logistic regression analysis confirms that the
effect of maternal strain on the stage of the embryonic
development is statistically significant (P < 0.0001, X2 =
58.31, d.f. = 2). This effect remains statistically significant
when pairwise comparisons between the three strains are
made.
Compared to mfrZ4070 or mfrZ1386/TM6, embryos produced by bw;st females have low hatch rates. However, if
the embryos arrested before a the end of cycle 1 are

removed from the data set and a subsequent ordinal logistic analysis is performed, the effect of strain on mitotic
stage is no longer significant between the bw;st parent
strain and the mfrZ4070 or mfrZ1386/TM6 control strain (P =
0.86, χ2 = 0.03). This results suggests that embryos from
bw;st mothers show defects in completing cycle 1, but if
the embryos complete cycle 1, then the distribution of
mitotic stages is similar to embryos from the mfrZ4070 or
mfrZ1386/TM6 mothers through cycle 14. Conversely, after
the cycle 1 data is removed, maternal strain retains a significant effect on mitotic stage when embryos from
mfrZ4070/mfrZ1386 mothers are compared to embryos from
both bw;st (P = 0.0016 χ2 = 9.99) and mfrZ4070 or mfrZ1386/
TM6 (P < 0.0001 χ2 = 15.40) mothers. This result indicates
that mitotic defects in embryos from mfrZ4070/mfrZ1386
mothers are not limited to the completion of cycle 1, but
instead extend into later cycles.

Discussion
We found that the D. melanogaster ferlin gene misfire is
expressed in the testis and ovaries of adult flies, and has
tissue-specific transcription initiation sites, alternatively
spliced mRNAs, and multiple developmental functions.
Our analysis of cDNAs, while not exhaustive, has provided a framework for predicting potential Mfr isoforms
and for interpreting the differential effects of mutations
on male and female fertility.
Thus far, ferlins have been described as having multiple
C2 domains, typically four to six, and a TM domain at the

fertility. However, we also isolated cDNAs that predict
shorter testis and ovary isoforms. Alternative splicing
appears to be common in the ferlin gene family
[2,13,14,28-30]. For human OTOF, Northern blot analysis shows that both short and long transcripts are produced [13]. The functional significance of the short
transcript is unknown, but its structure is strikingly similar
to that predicted for Mfr isoforms T2 and T3. Also, a subset of mfr cDNAs (T4, O1, and O3) predicts isoforms that

contain one to three C2 domains, but lack the TM
domain. cDNAs that predict ferlin isoforms lacking TM
domains have also been reported for human MYOF and

needed to determine which ferlin isoforms are produced
and whether variation in C2 domains or presence of soluble versus membrane forms contributes to function.
Ferlin proteins are known to have a role in Ca2+-dependent membrane-membrane interactions in mammalian
muscle cells, myoblasts, and inner ear hair cells [7-10],
and C. elegans spermatids [2,15]. Therefore, Mfr may also
mediate Ca2+-dependent interactions between membranes. In males, Mfr's time of action may be during spermatogenesis to affect sperm function during fertilization.

However, its multiple effects on PMBD and later stages of
sperm activation suggest activity of the protein during fertilization. After insemination, Mfr could facilitate interactions between the acrosome and sperm plasma
membrane to elicit PMBD. These interactions may also
involve Snky, an acrosomal membrane protein that like
Mfr, we propose is acting as a signaling protein for PMBD
[24]. Previously it was proposed that PMBD might occasionally occur spontaneously, allowing sperm produced
by snky mutant males to effectively bypass the requirement for Snky and produce a few progeny [18]. Here, we

show that a subset of sperm lacking Mfr function progress
past PMBD to achieve nuclear decondensation and pronuclear apposition, but produce no progeny. Later events
of sperm function, perhaps those associated with nuclear
envelope dynamics or pronuclear apposition, may also
require one or more Mfr isoforms. Possible Ca2+ cues for
Mfr activation may come from an intracellular source
such as the acrosome, which is a Ca2+-storage vesicle in
sperm of some species [31,32], or from cytoplasmic
sources in the activated D. melanogaster egg [33].
Only three of the male sterile mutations, which are all
located downstream of the C2D encoding region, induce
detectable effects on female fertility. The locations of these
mutations are consistent with the idea that a short ovarian
isoform, which includes the C2E and C2F domains, is
important for Gurken localization and consequently egg
patterning. However, the incomplete penetrance of the
mfr phenotype even with presumed null alleles mfrZ0695,
mfrZ1386, and mfrZ4070 suggests that other proteins can at
least partially compensate for loss of Mfr. In addition,
embryos produced by mfrZ4070/mfrZ1386 mothers show
developmental delay and/or arrest during the earliest
mitotic divisions. During these early mitotic divisions, D.

melanogaster embryos are rapidly dividing in a syncytium
and do not undergo transcription. Consequently, the
early mitotic cycles are under maternal genetic control.
The defects observed in embryos produced from mfrZ4070/
mfrZ1386 mothers before cycle 13 suggest that mfr mRNA
and/or proteins are maternally deposited into the embryo
and used during the early mitotic divisions. Microdomains of Ca2+ have been identified in D. melanogaster syncytial embryos undergoing mitosis [34] and Mfr may
associate with these transient Ca2+ signals that are critical
for cell division.
For ferlin proteins, the contribution of individual C2
domains to ferlin function remains largely an unanswered
question. In addition to biochemical analyses to address
this question [7,9,10], these studies and those of Washington et al. using C. elegans [2] show that genetic analysis
provides a complimentary approach. For the C. elegans fer1 gene, a predominance (8/10) of missense mutations
were recovered. The location of these mutations within
the C2C-, C2E-, and C2F-encoding domains suggested
that each of these domains is important for fer-1 function,
and that there is little functional redundancy among the
C2 domains. In contrast, we recovered an unusually high

Page 11 of 15

BMC Developmental Biology 2007, 7:21

proportion of mfr nonsense mutations (8/11), which may
reflect functional redundancy among C2 domains within
the Mfr protein. Alternatively, there may be functional
redundancy among protein isoforms expressed in the
same tissue, with the introduction of premature stop
codons expected to have more general effects on isoform
production. However, one critical difference between the
C. elegans and D. melanogaster studies is that the majority
of the C. elegans mutations were selected as temperature
sensitive male sterile alleles, which precludes the recovery
of nonsense mutations. For both organisms, now that the
mutant phenotypes and gene structures are known, the
function of C2 and other ferlin domains can be systematically tested. For instance, the effects of targeted disruptions of individual domains on phenotypes or the ability
of individual isoforms to rescue mutant phenotypes can
be evaluated.
Finally, we note that while ferlin genes are expressed in
the gonads and required for fertility in both D. melanogaster and C. elegans [2,15], this gene family has not yet
been implicated in fertility in mammals. To date, studies
of mammalian ferlins have focused largely on tissues that
show a disease phenotype caused by ferlin mutations and
a role in the gonad has not been explored. However, ferlin
transcripts have been detected in the testis and male germline of colts [35] and mice [36], and an antibody that recognizes mouse OTOF shows that this protein is located in
the testis [9]. It will be interesting to determine if one or
more of the mammalian ferlin proteins, like those in D.
melanogaster and C. elegans, play a role in fertility. Alternatively, ferlins whose original function in animal evolution
may have been specific for the gonad, may have been coopted for entirely new uses in mammals.

Methods
D. melanogaster strains and transgenes
Strains are described on FlyBase [37] or by Wilson et al.
[24]. The mfr mutations (mfrZ2713, mfrZ0695, mfrZ2942,
mfrZ1021, mfrZ6248, mfrZ1386, mfrZ4070, mfrZ3281, mfrZ3323,
mfrZ1250, and mfrZ4901) were recovered in a screen for ethyl
methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced male-sterile mutations
in a bw;st background [17] from the Zuker collection [38].
The mfr1 stock was provided by T. Ohsako and M-T.
Yamamoto [16].

The two deficiency chromosomes, Df(3L)h-i22 and
Df(3L)ED4415, were used in this study. Although they
behaved identically in failing to complement the male sterility associated with each mfr mutation, Df(3L)h-i22 was
variable compared to Df(3L)ED4415 in complementation
assays of mfr/Df females. Both chromosomes lack the mfr
gene, as verified using a PCR assay on embryos
homozygous for the deficiencies (K. Okada, personal
communication). Therefore, we attributed the difference
to a possible genetic suppressor of the female phenotype
in the Df(3L)h-i22 stock and used Df(3L)ED4415 for
assaying hemizygous female genotypes.
Transgenic lines containing the mfr genomic region were
constructed using a 10.7 kb BssHII/BsiWI fragment isolated from BACN18D24 (Children's Hospital Oakland
Research Institute, Oakland, CA). After attachment of NotI
linkers (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), the fragment was cloned into the pCasPeR4 transformation vector. Standard germ line transformation techniques and
genetic crosses were used to construct two independent
strains (A and B) of the genotype w1118; P [w+mcmfr+t10.7]A
or B/SM1; st mfrZ0695/TM6 and test for rescue of the mfr
mutant phenotypes.

Conclusion
We found that a D. melanogaster ferlin gene is important
for male and female fertility and carries out its functions
using multiple testis and ovary promoters, alternatively
spliced mRNAs, and protein isoforms. Genetic analysis of
a spectrum of mfr mutations shows that expression in
males is required for efficient breakdown of the sperm
plasma membrane and completion of sperm activation
during fertilization. In females, a subset of mfr mutations
perturbs egg patterning by limiting the localization of
Gurken, a key ligand in this pathway, and delays the progression of maternally controlled stages of embryogenesis. These findings provide the first evidence for diverse
roles of ferlins in both male and female reproduction and
help establish D. melanogaster as model system to study
the complex regulation and function of ferlins.

Analysis of mfr transcripts
RNA was harvested from testes, ovaries, and carcasses of
male and female flies that were 1–3 days old using the
RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). PolyA+ RNA was isolated by the MicroPoly(A) Purist Kit (Ambion, Austin,
TX). To determine the tissue specificity of mfr, first strand
cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript II
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RT-PCR
was carried out on cDNA with mfr gene specific primers
(located in exon 8 and 14 in testis cDNAs, and exon 7 and
13 in ovary cDNAs) and yip-6 control primers that span an
intron. Sequences of these and other primers used in this
study are available upon request. PCR products from the
testes and ovaries were cloned in the TOPO-TA vector
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and generated clones were
sequenced using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an
ABI/PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer.

BMC Developmental Biology 2007, 7:21

For RACE analysis on the testes and ovaries, first-strand
cDNA synthesis was performed with PowerScript™
Reverse Transcriptase (SMART RACE cDNA Amplification
Kit, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) for 5'RACE and MMLV
Reverse Transcriptase (First Choice RLM-RACE Kit,
Ambion, Austin, TX) for 3' RACE. For both 5' and 3' RACE,
PCR products were generated with two different primer
sets and cloned using the TOPO-TA vector. Generated
clones were sequenced as described above. For 5' RACE,
the PowerScript™ Reverse Transcriptase can add between
3–5 C residues to the first strand of cDNA, an activity that
later creates ambiguity for defining the exact start site of
the cDNA if the corresponding genomic sequence contains one or more Gs. This ambiguity occurred for a subset
of mfr start sites and is noted by the brackets in Figure 1B.
Sequences determined to be at the 5' and 3' end of the mfr
transcript by RACE analysis were used to design primer
sets to isolate near full-length cDNAs. PCR was performed
under conditions optimized for long products (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) with a combination of ProofStart DNA
polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and the products
were cloned into the TOPO-TA vector. Generated clones
of six testis and nine ovary cDNAs were selected and
sequenced as described above. Sequences of cDNAs are
available in GenBank as: EF120975 (T1), EF120976 (T2),
EF120977 (T3), EF120978 (T4), EF120979 (O1),
EF120980 (O2), and EF120981 (O3).
Localization of mfr mutations
To determine the location of the mfr mutations, genomic
DNA was extracted from males of the bw;st parent strain or
mfr strains. Overlapping primer sets were used to amplify
the entire mfr ORF and splice junctions, except 48 bp of
the 5' end of exon 2. PCR products were then sequenced.
Each mutation was verified by sequencing two independent products.
Assays for male fertility and fertilization
To assess fertility, single males were mated to three Canton-S (CS) virgin females and cultures were inspected for
the presence of progeny over the course of 15 days. At least
10 males were assayed for each mfr allele in hemizygous
combinations with Df(3L)h-i22 or Df (3L)ED4415 and for
a subset of mfr alleles in heteroallelic combination
(mfrZ0695/mfrZ1386, mfrZ2942/mfrZ3281, mfrZ2942/mfrZ4070,
mfrZ2942/mfrZ1386, mfrZ2942/mfrZ6248, mfrZ2942/mfrZ1021,
mfrZ2942/mfrZ1250, mfrZ2942/mfrZ4901). Control crosses used
males from the bw;st parent strain or sibling mfr/Balancer
males.

In order to compare efficiencies of fertilization of mfr and
normal sperm, a transgene expressing the don juan-GFP
(dj-GFP) sperm tail marker [39] was introduced into the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/21

mfr mutant background to create w; dj-GFP; st mfr/
Df(3L)h-i22 males for five alleles: mfrZ0695, mfrZ6248,
mfrZ2942, mfrZ3281, and mfrZ2713. Males were mated to CS
females and laid eggs were collected up to 90 minutes
after egg deposition then processed as described below to
assay GFP. dj-GFP; mfr+ males were used in a control cross
to monitor the efficiency of the assay. In this cross, 98% of
the eggs hatch (n = 335 eggs), and we detected the DJ-GFP
sperm tail marker in 87% of the eggs (n = 60 eggs).
Eggs laid by females were dechorionated in 50% bleach,
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with an octane overlay,
devitellinized with methanol, stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI,
and then mounted on slides in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Preparations were viewed
using a BioRad Radiance 2000 LSCM confocal microscope
in conjunction with a Spectra-Physics Mai Tai Laser, a 488
nm Kr/Ar laser, and a Nikon Eclipse E600-FN fluorescent
scope. Z-series stacks were compiled using NIH Image and
images were edited using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.
Two additional transgenes, expressing CD2 or Snky-GFP,
were introduced into a mfrZ0695 mutant background.
Assays for protein expression in sperm were performed as
described by Wilson et al. [24] except a 1:25 dilution of
the anti-rat CD2 monoclonal antibody (Harlan Sera-Labs
Ltd, Loughborough, UK) and a 1:200 dilution of the Alexa
488 rabbit anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies
(Alexa 488 Signal-Amplification kit, Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) were used.
Assays for mfr effects during oogenesis and embryogenesis
To assay for mfr effects in females, crosses were set up to
generate siblings with control and mfr mutant genotypes.
These crosses allowed morphological comparisons of eggs
laid by bw/+; st mfr+/Df(3L)ED4415 control females to bw/
+; st mfr/Df(3L)ED4415 females for each of the 11 mfr
alleles, and to eggs laid by heteroallelic bw/+; st mfrZ0695/st
mfrZ1386, bw/+; st mfrZ0695/st mfrZ4070 and bw/+; st mfrZ1386/
st mfrZ4070 females. A minimum of 176 eggs was examined
for each female genotype. Eggs were classified as having
either wild-type or mutant morphology based on length
and distance of the two dorsal appendages. Eggs were
photographed using a Nikon photomicroscope equipped
with a CoolSNAP cool-charged coupled device camera (RS
Photometrics, Tucson, AZ).

Additional assays in females focused on mainly on the
mfrZ4070 and mfrZ1386 mutations. To examine localization
of Gurken during oogenesis, ovaries from bw;st and bw;st
mfrZ4070/st mfrZ1386 females were dissected and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 1 × PBS and heptane. The ovaries
were incubated overnight with a 1:100 dilution of a primary mouse Gurken antibody [40] (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) and then

subsequently with a 1:1000 dilution of the Alexa 488 goat
anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR). The ovaries were stained with 0.1 mg/ml
DAPI, cleared in 80% glycerol overnight at 4°C, then
mounted on coded slides so scoring could be done without knowledge of the genotype. Localization of the
Gurken signal was scored as abnormal if the signal did not
extend posteriorly beyond the oocyte nucleus in stage 10
egg chambers.

To assess female fertility and maternal effects on embryogenesis, bw;st, bw/+;st mfrZ1386/st mfrZ4070, and bw/+;st

50 min, 90 min, or 48 hours. After 50 or 90 minutes,
embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach, rinsed in
0.2% NaCl/0.2% Triton-X and water, and treated with 0.5
M EGTA. The embryos were vortexed in a 50:50 mixture of
octane and methanol. The octane layer was removed and
the embryos were rinsed in methanol and a step-wise
increase in 0.1% Triton X in 1 × PBS. The embryos were
stained in 0.1 μg/ml DAPI, placed in 90% glycerol at 4°C
overnight, and staged according to the number of nuclei
in the embryo. Total nuclei were counted for embryos in
cycle 1 through cycle 8. After cycle 8, the total number of
nuclei was extrapolated from the number of nuclei along
the embryo periphery. For the embryos held for 48 hours,
the hatch rate was determined by counting the unhatched
embryos.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with the program
JMP (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). χ2 likelihood ratio tests
were used to compare the goodness-of-fit between models. Because multiple tests can increase type 1 error, when
three pairwise comparisons were made, the sequential
Bonferroni correction was used to determine the critical Pvalue (lowest P < 0.0167, middle P < 0.025, and highest P
< 0.05). An ordinal logistic regression model was used to
analyze the distribution of embryonic mitotic stages for
Figure 10.
Protein prediction programs
The predicted Mfr protein structure was evaluated by
SMART [41,42]. The C2 domain closest to the C terminus
(C2F) was not predicted by SMART, so the boundaries of
this domain were determined by homology to predicted
C2F domains of Mfr orthologs in other Drosophila species.
Percent identity between sequences was determined with
ClustalW [43].

Authors' contributions
MS designed and carried out the studies, analyzed the
data, and drafted the manuscript. BW isolated the mfr
mutations, conceived of the study, participated in experimental design and data analyses, and helped draft the
manuscript. Both authors read and approved the final
manuscript.
