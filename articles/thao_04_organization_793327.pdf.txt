Abstract
Background: With some exceptions, mitochondria within the class Insecta have the same gene
content, and generally, a similar gene order allowing the proposal of an ancestral gene order. The
principal exceptions are several orders within the Hemipteroid assemblage including the order
Thysanoptera, a sister group of the order Hemiptera. Within the Hemiptera, there are available a
number of completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes that have a gene order similar to that of
the proposed ancestor. None, however, are available from the suborder Sternorryncha that
includes whiteflies, psyllids and aphids.
Results: We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genomes
of six species of whiteflies, one psyllid and one aphid. Two species of whiteflies, one psyllid and one
aphid have mitochondrial genomes with a gene order very similar to that of the proposed insect
ancestor. The remaining four species of whiteflies had variations in the gene order. In all cases,
there was the excision of a DNA fragment encoding for cytochrome oxidase subunit III(COIII)tRNAgly-NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3(ND3)-tRNAala-tRNAarg-tRNAasn from the ancestral
position between genes for ATP synthase subunit 6 and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5. Based
on the position in which all or part of this fragment was inserted, the mitochondria could be
subdivided into four different gene arrangement types. PCR amplification spanning from COIII to
genes outside the inserted region and sequence determination of the resulting fragments, indicated
that different whitefly species could be placed into one of these arrangement types. A phylogenetic
analysis of 19 whitefly species based on genes for mitochondrial cytochrome b, NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 1, and 16S ribosomal DNA as well as cospeciating endosymbiont 16S and
23S ribosomal DNA indicated a clustering of species that corresponded to the gene arrangement
types.
Conclusions: In whiteflies, the region of the mitochondrial genome consisting of genes encoding
for COIII-tRNAgly-ND3-tRNAala-tRNAarg-tRNAasn can be transposed from its ancestral position to four
different locations on the mitochondrial genome. Related species within clusters established by
phylogenetic analysis of host and endosymbiont genes have the same mitochondrial gene
arrangement indicating a transposition in the ancestor of these clusters.

Background
Whiteflies, psyllids, and aphids correspond to superfamilies within the suborder Sternorrhyncha (Hemiptera)
[1]. These insects share a number of common properties
that are a consequence of their utilization of plant phloem
as their diet. This mode of feeding is accomplished by
means of needle-like stylets that probe plant tissues
between plant cells until they enter the phloem-sieve elements. Due to this mode of feeding, some species are of
major agricultural importance in that they vector plant
pathogens and in high numbers may cause plant debilitation due to excessive nutrient consumption [1]. Whiteflies, psyllids, and aphids have an obligatory association
with prokaryotic endosymbionts localized in specialized
cells called bacteriocytes that constitute a larger structure
called the bacteriome [2-4]. In the past, numerous studies
have been performed on the phylogeny of some of these
endosymbionts and their hosts [2-5]. The results have
indicated congruence between the endosymbiont and the
host derived phylogeny. This observation has been interpreted as being the consequence of an infection of an
insect ancestor by a prokaryote and the vertical transmission of the endosymbiont resulting in cospeciation or
cocladogenesis. In a recent study of whiteflies, we compared the phylogeny based on endosymbiont 16S*-23S*
rDNA to the phylogeny of the host based on several mitochondrial genes [6]. During this study, we found that in
the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, the order of some of the mitochondrial genes was quite different from the frequently
found order of genes in the mitochondria of the class
Insecta. This observation led us to obtain the full sequence
of the mitochondrial genome of representatives of the
suborder Sternorrhyncha. Due to the observed differences
in the order of genes in the mitochondrial genome of
whiteflies, we obtained additional mitochondrial
sequences from species representative of the major phylogenetic clusters previously established on the basis of
whitefly mitochondrial and endosymbiont genes [6]. Previous studies of the phylogenetic relationships of member
of the Sternorrhyncha, using host 18S rDNA, indicated
that it is a monophyletic group [7-9]. These studies also
showed that aphids and whiteflies were more closely
related to each other than to psyllids.
In animals, the mitochondrial genome is generally circular (14–17 kb), is maternally transmitted and has a relatively simple genetic structure, and a rapid rate of
sequence change [10-12]. Of the thirty seven genes found
in animal mitochondria, thirteen encode for proteins,
consisting of three subunits of cytochrome oxidase (COI,
COII, COIII), two subunits of ATP synthase (atp6, atp8),
seven subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (ND1, ND2,
ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, ND6), and cytochrome b (cytB).
Two genes encode for the large subunit of ribosomal RNA
(16S) and the small subunit of ribosomal RNA (12S). In

addition, there are 22 tRNAs, two for leucine and two for
serine, and one tRNA each for the remaining eighteen
amino acids. In general, there is conservation of the gene
order within phyla but variation between phyla [10,1317]; the tRNA genes are subject to more change in their
position than the genes for proteins and rRNAs. The order
of mitochondrial genes has been suggested to be a good
phylogenetic marker for studies of relationships [14]. The
animal mitochondrial genome is generally very compact
with few if any intergenic spaces. Usually there is one (or
rarely more) noncoding region, frequently following 12S
rDNA. Such a region most often has a reduced G+C content and all or some of the following properties: a) direct
repeats, b) inverted repeats, c) stretches of "T"s, "A"s, or
"TA"s. By analogy with other well-studied mitochondria,
such a region is considered to be a putative origin of DNA
replication and a region from which transcription is initiated [10,12]. Variation in mitochondrial size is generally
a consequence of variation in the length of the repeats in
the noncoding region and not in the number of structural
genes. Early studies within the class Insecta suggested conservation of the gene order over a wide range of different
organisms indicating an ancestral gene order for this
group [10,18]. However, more recent studies have shown
that within the Hemipteroid assemblage, there is considerable variation in the order of genes in the orders
Phthiraptera, Psocoptera, and Thysanoptera, but no variation in the order Hemiptera (that includes the suborder
Sternorrhyncha) [18-21]. The complete sequence of the
mitochondria of a representative of the Phthiraptera (wallaby louse) and the Thysanoptera (plague thrips) has been
obtained [18,20]. The latter shows major differences from
the ancestral gene order. The Hemiptera and the Thysanoptera are sister groups and it was consequently of interest
to obtain sequences of the mitochondrial genomes of the
former. Since the sequence of mitochondrial genomes is
poorly conserved, sequence determination of a portion of
the genome is useful for the study of closely related species or the population structure within a species [22,23].
The availability of completely sequenced mitochondrial
genomes is also an aid to the design of primers for the
PCR amplification of the regions selected for population
studies.

Results
Evolutionary relationships within the Sternorrhyncha
Table 1 gives the properties and the accession numbers of
the mitochondrial DNA sequences determined in this
study. An unrooted phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of whiteflies, psyllids and aphids, based on
mitochondrial cytB (partial), ND1, and 16S rDNA is presented in Fig. 1. A similar tree is obtained when the amino
acid sequence of CytB (partial) and ND1 is used. The sole
difference is the position of Neomaskellia andropogonis
which becomes part of the cluster containing Bemisia

tabaci, Tetraleurodes acaciae, Aleurochiton aceris, and Trialeurodes vaporariorum. Whiteflies, psyllids and aphids have
associations with different primary endosymbionts that
are transmitted vertically and are essential for the survival
of the insect host [2-6]. The time for the establishment of
these endosymbiotic associations and the emergence of
the composite organism is generally estimated to be
between 100 and 200 million years ago [2]. The representative species chosen for study (Fig. 1) probably span the
range of diversity within whiteflies, psyllids, and aphids.
The maximum % difference in the DNA sequence of these
organisms is 33.5 % for whiteflies, 29.7% for psyllids and
13.1% for aphids suggesting that the rate of mitochondrial sequence change in aphids is considerably less than
that in whiteflies and psyllids. Resolution of the order of
branching among these insect groups is not possible using
mitochondrial sequences, since due to their rapid rate of
change they are saturated.
Mitochondrial genomes with a similar gene order
With some notable exceptions, within the class Insecta the
order of the mitochondrial genes is highly conserved and
has led to the proposal of an ancestral gene order [10,18].
An identical or a similar gene order has been observed in
the mitochondrion of Pachypsylla venusta (psyllid), Schizaphis graminum (aphid), as well as Aleurodicus dugesii and
Trialeurodes vaporariorum (whiteflies) (Fig. 2). In pysllids

and aphids, tRNA-C is followed by tRNA-Y (Fig. 2,
extreme right) which corresponds to the ancestral Insecta
gene order. In most whiteflies (Fig. 2, 3, 4, 6), the order of
these tRNA genes is reversed and this probably constitutes
the whitelfly ancestral gene order. In the mitochondria of
T. vaporariorum, tRNA-G is transposed from its position
between COIII and ND3 to a position between tRNA-W
and tRNA-Y (Fig. 1). tRNA-S1 was not detected in the
mitochondria of S. graminum; this tRNA and tRNA-Q was
not detected in A. dugesii.
Mitochondria of whiteflies with transposition of COIII(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N)
A number of whitefly mitochondria had transpositions of
DNA fragments containing COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAsA-R-N). In most cases in which these genes are removed,
there is a change in the direction of transcription of the
adjacent downstream tRNA-S1 from clockwise to counter
clockwise (Fig. 3, 5, 6). There is variation in the mitochondrial position into which these genes are transposed. In
addition, there are differences with respect to the
retention of the number and the order of the excised tRNA
genes at the mitochondrial location in which the genes are
inserted. The maximal insertion involves all of the genes
from the excised fragment in their original order (Fig. 3)
(tRNAs-A-R-N)-ND3-(tRNA-G)-COIII), the minimal
insertion involves ND3-(tRNA-G)-COIII (Fig. 4, 5). In all

insertions, the transcription direction is altered from that
in the original position. Based on the location of the insertions and the adjacent genes, we have subdivided these
transpositions into four types (A-D) (Fig. 3,4,5,6). In all
cases, it would appear that the excision involved the
removal of COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N). However, the DNA that is inserted always contains COIII(tRNA-G)-ND3 and may contain all or only some of the
tRNA genes.
Transposition of the A type is shown in Fig. 3. In this case,
COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N) is removed from
the inferred ancestral position and placed between 12S

rDNA and tRNA-I. Additional changes involve the
position of tRNA-D, tRNA-Q and the direction of transcription of tRNA-S1 and tRNA-E. There is a total of 5 difference between the A type gene arrangement and the
ancestral whitefly gene order. Sequence determination of
smaller DNA fragments from two related species (cytBCOIII) were consistent with the same gene order (Fig. 3).
Transposition of the B type is shown in Fig. 4. In this case,
ND3-(tRNA-G)-COIII is inserted into a location
downstream of 12S rDNA and is bounded by tRNAs that
have also changed locations (tRNAs-Q-V and tRNAs-R-D).
In addition, the position of tRNA-A is changed as

genes for N, S1, and I were detected. Sequence determination of a smaller DNA fragment (cytB-COIII) from two
related species was consistent with the same gene order.

ND3-(tRNA-G)-COIII is inserted downstream of 16S

PCR-based screening for excision of COIII-(tRNA-G)ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N) and identification of transposition
types
We have devised a set of oligonucleotide primers complementary to COII and ND5 that allow the amplification of
the DNA between these two genes. The size of the resulting fragments is a potential indication of the presence or
absence of COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N) between
COII and ND5 (Fig. 2). Fig. 7 shows the results obtained
with insects containing mitochondria that have these
genes in the ancestral position (lanes 6–8, bands of 3.7
kb) and those in which they have been excised from this
position (lane 2–5, bands of 2.2 to 2.3 kb).

In addition, we have devised a set of PCR primers that
allow the distinction of the four types of transpositions.
Using oligonucleotide primers complementary to COIII
and cytB, the PCR fragments shown in Fig. 8 were
obtained. The sizes characteristic of arrangement types A,
B, C and D, were 4.9, 4.5, 3.5, and 1.5 kb, respectively.
Non-coding regions
Mitochondrial genomes of insects are very compact. The
principal non-coding segments of the genome are a low
G+C content region usually following 12S rDNA [10-12].
The low G+C region usually has stretches of "T"s or "A"s
as well as multiples of the sequence "TA." Another feature
of this region may be inverted and direct repeats. Fig. 9
presents a diagrammatic summary illustrating some of the
properties of the non-coding regions of the mitochondria
of the studied insects. Only direct repeats and their sizes
are indicated in this figure. No consistent pattern of
inverted repeats was found and these are not indicated in
the diagrams. All of the non-coding regions in the vicinity
of 12S rDNA had a G+C content lower than the G+C content of the full genome (Fig. 9). The decrease ranged from
3.2 to 10.0%. Some of these regions of lower G+C content, adjacent to 12S rDNA, contained direct repeats (Fig.
7, Adu, Tva, Aac). In Bta and Nan (Fig. 9), the direct
repeats were in a non-coding region following COIII that
also had a decrease in the G+C content. The noncoding
regions of Tac, containing direct repeats, had a G+C
content that was actually higher than that of the full Tac
mitochondrial genome. However, the segment before the
repeats had regions with a lower G+C content. In Sgr (Fig.
9), the direct repeats were between tRNA-E and tRNA-F
and had essentially no decrease in the G+C content. In
this organism and Pve (Fig. 9), the region following 12S
rDNA had a decrease G+C content but did not contain
substantial direct repeats.
tRNA anticodons
In general, the anticodons found in the tRNAs of the mitochondria of whiteflies, psyllids, and aphids were those
expected of insect mitochondria [12]. Some exceptions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/25

were "TTT" (instead of CTT) for tRNA-K for B. tabaci and
A. dugesii, and "TCT"(instead of GCT) for tRNA-S1 for B.
tabaci, A. aceris, N. andropogonis and T. vaporariorum. The
latter codon maybe the usual tRNA-S1 anticodon in
whiteflies; this tRNA was not detected in T. acaciae and A.
dugesii.

Discussion
The novel aspect of this study is the finding that whitefly
mitochondria contain a region of their genome spanning
COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N) that is prone to
excision followed by insertion as a unit or as fragments in
different parts of the mitochondrial genome. Based on the
collection of whiteflies we have examined, this event
occurred three or four different times in the ancestors of
the studied species. These conclusions are summarized in
Fig. 10 where the phylogeny of the whiteflies is compared
to the gene arrangement types. The designation Y refers to
the ancestral arrangement established in the species under
this designation. Species bracketed under A and B have a
similar insertion position for COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3) (Fig.
3, 4) but differ in adjacent tRNAs, so that it is possible
these differences followed the insertion of the transposed
fragment in a common ancestor. The positions of the
transpositions in species of clusters C and D are very different and are probably the results of independent events.
For purposes of this discussion we have chosen the
simplest interpretation but this does not exclude other
more complex scenarios. Cluster C is of additional interest
since it is related to two species of Aleyrodes that have the
ancestral (Y) arrangement. From the 16S*-23S* rDNA
sequence divergence of Portiera (the primary endosymbiont of whiteflies) and the estimated rate of endosymbiont
sequence change [24], it is possible to estimate the time of
divergence of cluster C and the two Aleyrodes species. This
value corresponds to 30–60 million years ago which is the
maximum time for the occurrence of the transposition in
an ancestor of cluster C.
The excision of the same mitochondrial fragment at least
four times during the evolutionary history of whiteflies
suggests that this fragment is prone to transposition. In
spite of the apparent similarity of the excisions, we have
not been able to find any conserved sequence properties
either adjacent to the region of the excised fragment or
adjacent to its insertion site. The excision appears to be
associated with a change in the direction of transcription
of the previously adjacent tRNA-S1 (Fig. 3, 5, 6) and a
change in the direction of transcription of the relocated
fragments. As previously noted the order of the mitochondrial genes is conserved in most insects [10,14]. The major
exceptions are within the three hemipteroid orders
Phthiraptera, Psocoptera, and Thysanoptera [18,20,21].
The rearrangements are different within these three
orders, being rather extreme in the Thysanoptera. In most

insects, the order of the rRNA genes is 16S-(tRNA-V)-12S
and the genes are transcribed in the counterclockwise
direction [10,18]. A major exception is in the mitochondrion of Thrips imagines where these two genes are distant

from each other and transcribed in opposite orientations
[18]. In the C type gene order, there is an inversion of 12S(tRNA-V) that is possibly associated with the insertion of
ND3-(tRNA-G)-COIII between 16S and 12S rDNA (Fig. 5,

Summary of the major transpositions occurring in the mitochondria of whiteflies and the relationship of these
changes to the phylogeny of whitefly species. The phylogenetic tree was obtained on the basis of combined mitochondrial cytB-N22-16S rDNA and Portiera endosymbiont 16S* and 23S* rDNA using the maximum likelihood method. Numbers at
nodes correspond to bootstrap values after 500 replicates. The combination of the host and endosymbiont sequence data is
justified by their cospeciation [6]. A, B, C, D indicate transposition type; Y, indicates mitochondria with an ancestral gene
arrangement. Large arrowhead in mitochondrial genome indicates the original position of the transposed genes. Small arrowheads indicate the position of the insertion of the genes. Arrows outside circle indicate the direction of the transcription of the
transposed genes. Arrow by the arrowhead of the B type transposition indicates the changed direction of transcription of the
12S rDNA. tRNAs have been omitted. (*), by species names indicate that the full mitochondrial genome was sequenced. (+), by
species names indicates that a DNA fragment containing all or a part of the gene encoding for COIII and adjacent genes was
sequenced. (o), by species name indicates that using oligonucleotide primers to COII and ND5 a PCR product was obtained
corresponding to a size that was consistent with the presence of COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N) in the ancestral position
(Fig. 8).

10). This situation resembles that found in Thrips imagines
in that the rRNA genes are transcribed in opposite directions. In whiteflies, besides rearrangements involving
COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N), there are also substantial rearrangements involving single tRNAs. The physiological significance (if any) of these rearrangements is
not known. Genes that are highly expressed (16S, 12S
rDNA) when separated and transcribed in opposite orientations would have to become part of different transcription units. In addition, we are not certain of the validity or
significance of our inability to find a few of the tRNAs. In
some cases, this may stem from our inability to recognize
them. In other cases, such as tRNAs-A-R-N that are absent
in the type C gene order, there would not appear to be any
room for these genes on the mitochondrion and it might
be that the tRNAs for these amino acids are provided by
the host [25].

The mitochondrion of A. dugesii has a G+C content of
13.8 moles % (Table 1). All the other sequenced whitefly
mitochondria have G+C contents of 18.7 to 27.7 moles %
(Table 1). On the basis of morphological classification,
Aleurodicus has been placed into a subfamily Aleurodicinae, while the remaining whitefly species listed in Fig. 10
have been placed into the subfamily Aleyrodinae [1]. This
separation is supported by a phylogenetic analysis of
mitochondrial DNA, host 18S rDNA, as well as Portiera
DNA from different whitefly species [6-8]. It is possible
that the common ancestor of whiteflies had a higher G+C
content in its mitochondria and that in Aleurodicus there
was a decrease. Alternatively, it is possible that the ancestral G+C content was low and increased in the
Aleyrodinae.

Our work points to the uncertainty inherent in making
generalizations from one or a few organisms assumed to
be representative of a group. We were fortunate that in the
whiteflies the first mitochondrion we chose to study was
that of B. tabaci which had an altered gene order. Had we
started with our second or third choice (T. vaporariorum, A.
dugesii) we would have concluded that the whiteflies have
the ancestral mitochondrial gene order and not pursued
further studies of mitochondria within this group of
insects. Previously, evidence was found of a correlation
between the rate of nucleotide sequence change and the
rate of gene rearrangement [26]. If this has general
applicability one would expect conservation of the
mitochondrial gene order in aphids which have a low rate
of sequence change (Fig. 1) and perhaps some changes in
the gene order of psyllids as has been observed with
whiteflies. The relatively localized different changes
observed in several whitefly lineages may be of use in the
study of the phylogeny and taxonomy of these organisms
as is already indicated from the relatively small sample of
organism studied in the present work.

Conclusions
Psyllids, aphids, and many whiteflies have mitochondria
in which the order of the genes resembles the proposed
Insecta ancestral gene order. However, in a variety of
whitefly species there is a change in the gene order. In
these organisms, there is an excision of a DNA segment
containing COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N) from
the ancestral position, between atp6 and tRNA-S1, and the
insertion of all of these genes or fragments containing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/25

COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND and tRNAs into different locations
on the mitochondrial genome. On the basis of the
insertion positions, four gene arrangement types were
identified. A phylogenetic analysis of 19 whitefly species
involving mitochondrial and endosymbiont genes
showed that each arrangement type was characteristic of a
cluster of related whitefly species indicating that the transposition occurred in a common ancestor of the related
species. The reason for the "restlessness" of this DNA segment in whiteflies and the physiological significance of
these rearrangements are not known.

Methods
Amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial genomes
In all cases, the starting material was whole insect DNA
that was prepared and used in a previous study [6]. In our
initial attempts at cloning mitochondrial DNA, we used
methods previously developed for obtaining clones of
insect endosymbiont DNA that have been described in
detail [27]. In outline this involved obtaining a homologous probe for COI using previously described primers
[28], followed by restriction enzyme and Southern blot
analysis of insect DNA. Appropriate sized fragments were
electroeluted from agarose gels and cloned into λ-ZAP
(Stratagene, La Jolla, California). Following excision of
the insert-containing plasmid, the DNA sequence was
determined using a double stranded nested deletion kit
(Pharmacia, Piscatawy, New Jersey) and where necessary
custom-made oligonucleotides. As new sequence data was
acquired for the mitochondria of several insect species our
ability to design more specific oligonucleotide primers

was improved. This allowed us to use pairs of primers, in
combination with PCR, to obtain the full mitochondrial
genome in 2–4 overlapping fragments. Conserved regions
of the whitefly mitochondrial genome that are of use for
the design of oligonucleotide primers, based on comparisons of six mitochondrial genomes, are given in Table 2.
Usually the oligonucleotide primers had added sequences
at the 5'-ends for restriction enzymes.
We will illustrate the approach by describing how the full
genome of the mitochondrion of T. acaciae was obtained
in three overlapping fragments. Using primers F-CYTB
and R-12S-2 (Table 2) and PCR, a 3.6 kb DNA fragment
was obtained. Similarly, using the pairs of primers F-COI2 and R-CYTB and F-12S-2 and R-COI fragments of 7.3
and 5.5 kb, respectively, were obtained. For fragments of
4 kb or less, the PCR reaction mixture (10 ul) contained
10 ng insect DNA, 1 ug bovine serum albumin, 5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, 10 pmoles of each primer, 0.6 U
Bio-X-Act DNA polymerase, in Opti-Buffer (Bioline, London, United Kingdom). The PCR program was 94°C for 3
min, 30 cycles of, 94°C 30 sec, 55.0–65.0°C (predetermined optimal annealing temperatures) 30 sec, 70° 5
min, followed by 70°C 10 min. For the 5.5 and 7.3 kb
DNA fragments, the PCR reaction mixture was modified
by the increase of dNTPs to 0.3–0.4 mM and Bio-X-Act to
0.8 U. The PCR program was 94°C for 2 min, 10 cycles of
92°C 20 sec, 55.0–65.0°C (predetermined optimal
annealing temperatures) 30 sec, 68° 10 min, followed by
20 cycles of 92°C 20 sec, optimal annealing temperature
30 sec, 68°C 10 min with increases of 15 sec each cycle,
followed by 68°C 10 min. The DNA fragments were purified by means of the Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) as directed by the
manufacturer. Following digestion with restriction
enzymes the mitochondrial DNA fragments were cloned
into pBluescript (Stratagene). In some cases where difficulty was experienced with using this vector due to possible toxicity of the inserts, the low copy number plasmid
pWSK130 was used [29]. The DNA sequence was obtained
as described above. Sequences were determined at the
University of Arizona (Tucson) LMSE sequencing facility.
In some cases, PCR fragments of 1 to 4 kb were directly
sequenced after gel purification using custom made oligonucleotide primers.
PCR amplification of other mitochondrial fragments
CytB-12S mitochondrial DNA fragments were amplified
and cloned into pBluescript as previously described [6].
CytB-COIII DNA fragments were obtained using oligo WFCYTB-3 (BamHI, SacII; 5'-GCAGGATCCG CGGCCWTGRG GHCAAATATC WTTTTGRGGD GC-3') and WFCOIII-3 (KpnI, 5'-GTGCGGTACC TTCWATTTGR TATTGRCATT TYGTTGA-3') and cloned into pBluescript. COIIND5 DNA fragments (indicative of the presence or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/25

absence of COIII-(tRNA-G)-ND3-(tRNAs-A-R-N) were
obtained by use of oligo WF-COII (5'-TGYTCAGAAA TYTGTGGRGT TAATCAYAGR TTTATRCC-3') and WF-ND5
(5'-TCAGCMTTAG TYCAYTCWTC AACAYTAGTW ACAGCAGG-3'). CytB-COIII fragments (size diagnostic of the
arrangement type) were obtained by use of WF-CYTB-1
(5'-TTTATRGGBT ATATYTTRCC TTGRGG-3') and WFCOIII-1 (5'-TATTCWRTWT GATATTGACA TTTYGT-3').
The PCR reaction mixture (10 ul) differed from those
above in containing 0.1 mM dNTP, and 0.8 U Bio-X-Act
DNA polymerase. The PCR program was 94°C for 5 min,
30 cycles of, 94°C 30 sec, 56.0–63.1°C (predetermined
optimal annealing temperatures) 30 sec, 70° 5 min, followed by 70°C 10 min.
Identification of genes and phylogenetic analyses
The protein-coding and rRNA genes were identified by
BLAST searches [30] of GenBank. tRNA genes were identified by tRNAscan-SE [31], DOGMA [32] and in some
cases by eye from the anticodons and inferred secondary
structures. The methods used for the phylogenetic analyses have been described [6]. In Fig. 1, the phylogenetic
analysis of mitochondrial cytB-ND1-16S was based on
2730 characters; the analysis in Fig. 10, which besides
cytB-ND1-16S also included cospeciating endosymbiont
16S*-23S* rDNA [6], was based on 6860 characters.
