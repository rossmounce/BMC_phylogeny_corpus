Abstract
Background: The much-debated phylogenetic relationships of the five early branching metazoan lineages
(Bilateria, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Placozoa and Porifera) are of fundamental importance in piecing together events
that occurred early in animal evolution. Comparisons of gene content between organismal lineages have been
identified as a potentially useful methodology for phylogenetic reconstruction. However, these comparisons require
complete genomes that, until now, did not exist for the ctenophore lineage. The homeobox superfamily of genes
is particularly suited for these kinds of gene content comparisons, since it is large, diverse, and features a highly
conserved domain.
Results: We have used a next-generation sequencing approach to generate a high-quality rough draft of the
genome of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi and subsequently identified a set of 76 homeobox-containing genes
from this draft. We phylogenetically categorized this set into established gene families and classes and then
compared this set to the homeodomain repertoire of species from the other four early branching metazoan
lineages. We have identified several important classes and subclasses of homeodomains that appear to be absent
from Mnemiopsis and from the poriferan Amphimedon queenslandica. We have also determined that, based on
lineage-specific paralog retention and average branch lengths, it is unlikely that these missing classes and
subclasses are due to extensive gene loss or unusually high rates of evolution in Mnemiopsis.
Conclusions: This paper provides a first glimpse of the first sequenced ctenophore genome. We have
characterized the full complement of Mnemiopsis homeodomains from this species and have compared them to
species from other early branching lineages. Our results suggest that Porifera and Ctenophora were the first two
extant lineages to diverge from the rest of animals. Based on this analysis, we also propose a new name ParaHoxozoa - for the remaining group that includes Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria.

Background
Ctenophores are a phylum of marine metazoans with
uncertain phylogenetic affinity. Their signature morphological features include a set of eight ciliated comb rows
that are used for swimming; these are controlled by an
aborally located statocyst called the apical sense organ.
Most ctenophores have a pair of feeding tentacles that

contain specialized adhesive cells called colloblasts.
Ctenophores are extremely fragile and difficult to culture
and, as such, we know very little about their biology relative to other metazoans [1].
The unique ctenophore body plan has made it difficult
to untangle its phylogenetic position in relation to other
animal phyla. The earliest comparative classifications by
Cuvier allied ctenophores with cnidarians and echinoderms in the Radiata [2]. Later, Leuckart grouped ctenophores with sponges and cnidarians in the Coelenterata
[3]. Associations proposed between ctenophores and other

taxa include groupings with Platyhelminthes, trochozoans,
bilaterians and subsets of sponges and cnidarians (see [4]
for a review). Many of the early molecular studies using 18
s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences placed ctenophores
sister to Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria (for example,
Wainright et al., 1993; Smothers et al. 1994; Bridge et al.
1995; Collins 1998; Kim et al. 1999 [5-9]).
The 18 S rRNA placement of ctenophores has recently
been challenged using data generated in expressed
sequence tag (EST)-based phylogenomic studies. One
study re-allies ctenophores with the cnidarians [10],
while another has ctenophores branching at the base of
the animal tree [11,12]. Yet another study combined
morphological, structural and sequence data, leading to
the placement of ctenophores in a clade with all other
non-bilaterians sister to the Bilateria [13]. These conflicting results could be due to the use of different
methods, the inherent incomplete nature of transcript
sequencing (in the case of the EST-based studies) or for
other reasons. This series of studies have left most
investigators waiting for further evidence to tilt the consensus convincingly in one direction or another.
Phylogenomic approaches hold the promise of reconstructing the true tree of life (reviewed in [14]). Thus
far, most phylogenomic efforts that have included data
from all four of the early branching phyla have been
restricted to the aforementioned (and conflicting) ESTbased analyses (for example [10-12,15]). Methods based
on whole-genome content rather than large concatenated data matrices can provide an independent assessment of current phylogenetic hypotheses and, due to
the rarity of events measured, may arguably be more
appropriate in this context [14,16]. One such rare genomic change that has previously been employed involves
the presence or absence of gene duplications of homeobox genes [17-19].
Homeobox genes encode transcription factor proteins
characterized by the presence of a helix-loop-helix
DNA-binding domain called the homeodomain [20].
Homeobox genes were present in the last common
ancestor of plants, animals and fungi and underwent
extensive independent diversification in each of these
lineages [21,22]. In animals, the homeobox superfamily
has been separated into 11 classes and more than 125
gene families [21,23,24].
Examination of the homeobox complement of species
from early-branching metazoan phyla (such as Cnidaria
[25,26], Placozoa [27,28] and Porifera [29,30]) has been
an especially fertile area of research, one that has been
fuelled by the recent availability of full genomic
sequence data from several non-bilaterian genomes. The
last remaining non-bilaterian phylum lacking a species
with a sequenced genome (and, therefore, a completely
examined homeobox repertoire) was Ctenophora.

We have used a next-generation sequencing approach
to sequence and assemble the ~150 MB of the lobate ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidyi. Here, we present the first
whole-genome investigation of the ctenophore homeobox superfamily. Our results expand on previous studies
that have utilized degenerate polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) approaches to identify ctenophore homeoboxes
from the PRD, ANTP and SINE classes [22,31-36].
In addition to these classes, we show that the POU, LIM
and TALE classes were also present prior to the divergence of the ctenophores from the rest of Metazoa.
This is also the first study to compare the complete
homeobox catalogue of species from all of the non-bilaterian phyla, along with that of the two major bilaterian
lineages (Protostomia and Deuterostomia) where complete genomic sequence data is available. As such, this
work provides a major missing piece of evidence that is
critical to understanding the makeup of the homeodomain superfamily in early metazoan history. With these
data in hand, we evaluate the congruency of the homeodomain data with the recently proposed phylogenetic
relationships of the early branching phyla.

Results
Overview of homeobox genes in Mnemiopsis

We extracted 76 homeoboxes from the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi. The corresponding homeodomains were
aligned to the human and Drosophila dataset used in
Holland et al. 2007 [23] and supplemented with eight
amphioxus homeodomains known to be missing from
humans. The sequence alignment is available as supplemental material (Additional File 1). We generated nine
trees from this alignment using multiple methods (neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
inference), multiple starting trees and multiple implementations. For example, in the case of ML, we used
RaxML [37] and PhyML [38]). In this case, we generated
a likelihood value for each tree and then chose the one
with the highest likelihood (Figure 1). We subsequently
used this tree and secondary domain information, along
with the classification scheme in the Homeo Database
(HomeoDB) [24], to divide the 76 Mnemiopsis homeodomains into the following classes: ANTP (22 homeodomains); PRD (7); TALE (3); POU (4); LIM (4); and SINE
(18). Eighteen homeodomains remained unclassified
(Table 1).
Most of these class-level assignments are confirmed by
the presence of secondary domains, sequence signatures,
and/or class-specific introns (Table 1). To all of these
classes (with the exception of the 18 homeodomains that
remained unclassified), we added corresponding homeodomain sequence data from the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica [30], the placozoan Trichoplax
adhaerens [27], the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis [26]

Figure 1 Homeodomain superfamily tree. This tree is based on a RaxML tree that included homeodomains from human, Drosophila,
Mnemiopsis and a few related species that serve as place-holders for homeodomains known to be missing from human and Drosophila (see
Figure 2 legend for species codes). This tree is referred to as a âsuperfamily treeâ as it includes homeodomains from all classes of the
homeodomain superfamily, in contrast to the trees in Figures 2, 3 and 4 that include only homeodomains from individual classes. Mnemiopsis
sequences are shown in red; human and other deuterostome sequences are shown in blue; Drosophila and other protostome sequences are
shown in green; and cnidarian sequences are shown in brown. This RaxML tree had a higher likelihood value compared to several other
methods and variations of starting trees supplied to RaxML (see methods). Collapsed clades represent clades with no Mnemiopsis representative
and include a code that indicates how many deuterostome, protostome and cnidarian homeodomains are in that particular clade (for example,
2D4P1C would signify 2 deuterostome, 4 protostome, and 1 cnidarian). ML bootstraps are included for clades with bootstrap values greater than
50. Black dots appear on clades with Bayesian posterior probability values greater than 50 and red dots on clades greater than 90. Rooting of
this tree is for display purposes only; branch lengths are presented uniformly, also for display purposes. Actual branch lengths can be viewed by
opening the Newick-formatted tree file (Additional File 4), which also includes bootstrap and Bayesian support values, in a tree viewing/editing
program such as FigTree [53].

The first column (Name) contains the names given to each gene. The second
column (Domain) indicates any additional domains detected either in the
predicted gene sequence or in close genomic proximity to the homeobox in
the same orientation. If NKL, HOXL, HOXL2 or PRD sequence signatures or are
present in the translated homeodomain (as defined in [40]), this is noted in
the third column. The third column (Signature) also includes the amino acid
sequences of atypical insertions if they are present. The format for insertions
is the word âinsertâ followed by the amino acids that make up the insertion in
parentheses and the first codon of the homeobox occupied by the insertion.
For those homeoboxes that are interrupted by one or more introns, the
fourth column (Intron Codons) lists either the codon that is interrupted (noted
by a single number) or the two codons that are separated by an intron (noted
by two numbers separated by a forward slash). Commas separate codon
positions for genes with multiple introns. The five MlSIX59 homeoboxes are
truncated at the 57th codon and occur at the end of their corresponding
GENSCAN gene prediction. The last column indicates the GenBank accession
of the corresponding nucleotide sequences. An asterisk next to an accession
indicates a previously described version of this homeodomain exists. The
previously described homeodomains are as follows: MlANTP65 - ACD85820
(Tlx-like), MlANTP66 - ACD85819 (Dlx/NK-like), MlANTP67 - ACD85818 (BarH/
BarX-like), MlANTP68 - ACD85817 (Bsh), MlPRD10b - ACD85823 (Prd3),
MlPRD16 - ACD85821 (Prd1), MlPRD44 - ACD85822 (Prd2).

and the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevis [39]: we then
performed class-specific phylogenetic analyses. We
named Mnemiopsis homeodomains that showed a
strong affiliation for a particular family accordingly;
otherwise, the name of the class is used in conjunction
with a preliminary number that was originally assigned
to the homeodomain.
ANTP class NKL subclass

Eighteen of the 22 ANTP homeodomains group are
within the NKL subclass. There is only weak support for
assigning any of the Mnemiopsis NKL homeodomains
with particular families but, in some cases, there is consistency between our initial superfamily tree (Figure 1)
and our ANTP-specific tree that included the additional
Amphimedon, Nematostella, and Trichoplax sequences
(Figure 2).
The following groupings are consistent in both trees
and have support values over 50 in our best Bayesian
tree: (1) MlANTP65 with the Tlx family and (2)
MlANTP22 with the Human Ventx gene. MlANPT25,
MlANTP35, MlANTP67 and MlANTP78 group with the
Dlx family consistently in both trees but, in the full tree,
the Dlx clade also includes MlANTP66. Similarly,
MlANTP19, MlANTP68, MlANTP71 and MlANTP72
form clades positioned sister to the Barx, Bsx, Dbx and
Hlx familes. However, the relationships between Mnemiopsis homeodomains is inconsistent between these
trees. The other NKL homeodomains identified are
MlANTP21, MlANTP23, MlANTP25, MlANTP35,
MlANTP37, MlANTP47, MlANTP48, MlANTP51,
MlANTP63, MlANTP66, MlANTP67 and MlANTP78.
Consistent with our analysis, a previous study classified
MlANTP65 as a Tlx-like homeodomain [36]. The same
study also associated MlANTP66 with the Dlx family,
MlANTP67 with the Barh family and MlANTP68 with
the Bsx family, an observation that was not consistently
reproduced in our trees.
Evidence in the form of diagnostic residues can provide
additional support to classifications [40]. The following
homeodomains all contain the diagnostic residues associated with the NKL subclass ([AKST][DENPS][LAST]
[Q][V] at positions 41-45): MlANTP19, MlANTP37,
MlANTP48, MlANTP68, MlANTP71 and MlANTP72.
The only other Mnemiopsis homeodomain with the NKL
signature is the SINE class homeodomain MlSIX36. (The
position of MlSIX36 on the tree in Figure 1 and its
upstream SIX domain led to its SINE class designation.)
In addition to the NKL signature, the MlANTP37 homeodomain also contains the HOXL signature ([KT][IV]
WFQNRR[AMV]K[DEHKLMQWY][KR][KR] at positions 46-58) and the MlANTP48 homeodomains contains the HOXL2 signature (LE[AGKNR]E at positions
16-19) (Table 1).

Page 5 of 18

ANTP class HOXL-related

Four paralogous Mnemiopsis ANTP homeodomains (MlANTP03a, MlANTP03b, MlANTP03c and
MlANTP03d) group with the engrailed family in our
superfamily tree (Figure 1) and with the Evx family in
the ANTP tree (Figure 2). Despite the engrailed family
being assigned to the NKL subclass in HomeoDB [24],
engrailed has been historically allied with the extended
Hox subclass based on synteny [41,42] and phylogeny
[43]. Evx is also considered a member of the extended
Hox subclass. While it is difficult to pin down the exact
relationship of the MlANTP03 homeodomains, it does
appear that they are the most likely descendants of the
homeodomain that gave rise to the HOXL genes in the
lineage leading to Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria. Consistent with this classification, the MlANTP03a and
MlANTP03b genes both contain the HOXL2 diagnostic
residue signature. There are no clear ParaHox or Hox
genes in Mnemiopsis.
PRD class

We identified seven PRD class homeodomains in the
Mnemiopsis genome. The PRD class is divided into
three subclasses based on the amino acid residue at
position 50: Q50, K50 and S50 [44]. As with most
homeodomain studies, these subclasses are not monophyletic in our trees (Figure 3). However, given the
extremely low support values at the subfamily level, this
may not reflect their true relationship. All three subclasses are clearly present in the genomes of bilaterians,
Nematostella and Trichoplax. Eight of the nine PRD
class homeoboxes in Amphimedon possess the Q50 residue. The remaining PRD homeodomain is the Amphimedon PaxB homeodomain, which is has a degenerate
homeodomain [45] and, as such, was not included in
our phylogenetic analysis.
Of the seven Mnemiopsis PRD class homeodomains, six
have a Q at position 50. The exception (MlPRD43) is
missing sequence information at that position. (Note: just
prior to the submission of this manuscript, a new assembly has revealed the likely 3â end of this homeodomain
that includes a Q at position 50). We did not find any
Mnemiopsis genes with an S at position 50. The only
other Mnemiopsis genes with a K at position 50 are the
18 SINE class genes that, like the K50 PRD class genes,
also characteristically have a K residue at position 50.
Consistent with the absence of lysine or serine residues at position 50 in Mnemiopsis and Amphimedon
PRD homeodomains, we see no grouping of Mnemiopsis
or Amphimedon homeodomains with S50 or K50 clades,
with the following exceptions: (1) MlPRD16 groups with
the Nematostella S50 homeodomain NvPRD074, albeit
with virtually no support (ML bootstrap = 2, Bayesian
posterior probability distribution = 2), within a larger

sequences. Collapsed clades (triangles) represent clades with no Mnemiopsis representative. These clades have families represented in bold along
with the phyla/subkingdom who have sequences represented in the collapsed clade (P = Protostomia; D = Deuterostomia; C = Cnidaria;
T = Placozoa; A = Porifera). Support values shown are maximum likelihood (ML) bootstrap greater than 50%. Nodes with posterior probabilities
generated by MrBayes greater than 50 are represented by a black dot and those clades with posterior probabilities greater than 90 are
represented by a red dot. For visibility, trees were initially formatted in FigTree [53] as cladograms with decreasing ordered nodes and uniform
branch lengths. They were later formatted by hand in Adobe Illustrator. Rooting of this tree is for display purposes only; branch lengths are
presented uniformly, also for display purposes. Actual branch lengths can be viewed by opening the Newick-formatted tree file (Additional File 4),
which also includes bootstrap and Bayesian support values, in a tree viewing/editing program such as FigTree [53]. Homeodomain names are
prefixed with two letter species abbreviations as follows: Ml = Mnemiopsis leidyi; Aq = Amphimedon queenslandica (Porifera/demosponge);
Ta = Trichoplax adhaerens (Placozoa); Nv = Nematostella vectensis (Cnidaria/starlet sea anemone); Dm = Drosophila melanogaster (Protostomia/

homeodomain AqQ50a groups with the highly divergent
HsDUXBI (ML bootstrap = 27, Bayesian posterior probability distribution = 95), also within a larger clade of
Q50 homedomains (Figure 1). The overwhelming evidence suggests that Mnemiopsis and Amphimedon are
devoid of S50 and K50 PRD class homeodomains.

Conversely, Nematostella and Trichoplax both have
clear K50 and S50 homeodomains. The phylogenetic
distribution of Q50, S50 and K50 PRD homeodomains
in our study is consistent with the hypothesis that Q50
homeodomains were the founders of the PRD class [44].

[AEFHKQRV][ADEGKNSTW][CHKMPQR][FHY]P at
positions 16-26) associated with paired homeodomains
in bilaterians: MlPRD10a, MlPRD10b, MlPRD16,
MlPRD44, MlPRD61 (Table 1). No other Mnemiopsis
homeodomains display this pattern. MlPRD10b,
MlPRD16 and MlPRD44 had been identified as Paired
class genes in a previous study and were named Prd3,
Prd1 and Prd2 respectively [36]. MlPRD44 also contains
the HOXL2 diagnostic residues (Table 1).
MlPRD16 and MlPRD61 have clear octapeptide
sequences upstream of the homeodomain (SSISSLLS
and HSIDDILG, respectively), a hallmark characteristic
of a subset of the PRD class homeodomains. MlPRD43
and MlPRD50 have less-conserved but possible octapeptides as well (QRILGILS and YNIEGLLG, respectively).
There are no paired domains associated with any Mnemiopsis homeodomains, but there are two independent
paired domain sequences that appear to be direct orthologs of the two identified in the ctenophore Coeloplana
willeyi [33].
Like most PRD class homedomains [46], all but one of
the Mnemiopsis PRD homeodomains have an intron
that occurs in the vicinity of the 46th and 47th codons.
The one exception, MlPRD10a, has a single intron that
interrupts the 37th codon. This might be the result of a
retrotransposition event involving a transcript from its
paralog (MlPRD10b) followed by an intron gain event.
There are additional introns in the N-termini of the
homeodomains of MlPRD10b, MlPRD50, and MlPRD61.
POU class

MlPOU1, MlPOU26a, MlPOU26b, and MlPOU26c make
up the four Mnemiopsis POU class homeodomains.
MlPOU1 has relatively strong support values, placing it
in the POU1 family (ML bootstrap = 65; Bayesian posterior probability distribution = 98; Figure 4A). In addition,
it has a POU-specific domain upstream of the homeodomain, a defining factor of the POU class [47]. There is
weak support uniting MlPOU26a, MlPOU26b and
MlPOU26c with the human HDX (highly divergent
homeobox) homeodomain of POU class genes (ML
bootstrap = 19; Bayesian posterior probability distribution = 45). Only one of the three MlPOU26 homeodomains (MlPOU26a) contains an upstream POU-specific
domain.
TALE class

MlPbx, MlMeis and MlPknox, like other TALE class
homeodomains, have a three amino acid insertion in the
loop between the first and second alpha-helices (Table 1).
MlPbx, MlMeis and MlPknox consistently group with the
Pbx, Meis and Pknox families, respectively, in both trees
with moderate support (Figures 1 and 4B). In all three

Page 9 of 18

cases, the phylogenetic assignment of these homeodomains is reinforced by the identification of several conserved motifs outside of the homeodomain, as well as by
conserved intron positions (Table 1).
Like other Pbx genes (and unlike other TALE genes),
MlPbx has a glycine residue at position 50 of the homeodomain. In addition, a Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool (BLAST) search to the contig containing MlPBX
shows significant similarity to the PBC domain [48]
located ~1.5 KB upstream of the homeodomain, as
assessed by BLAST [percent identity (ID)= 25/67, expectation (E)-value = 2 Ã 10 -7 ). Like the cnidarian and
human PBX genes, MlPbx has an intron that interrupts
the second codon and one that falls between the 47th
and 48th codon of the 63-codon TALE homeobox.
Meis homeodomain proteins have several conserved
motifs in addition to the homeodomain [49]. A GENSCAN prediction containing the MlMeis homeodomain
shows similarity to the upstream MEIS A domain (ID =
19/69, E-value = 0.005), as well as weaker similarity to
the MEIS D domain downstream of the homeodomain
(ID = 16/48, E-value = 0.014). Similar to bilaterians and
cnidarians, MlMeis has two introns. One falls between
the 25th and 26th codons, while another interrupts the
51st codon.
The GENSCAN-predicted peptide that contains the
MlPknox homeodomain also includes the abbreviated
MEIS A domain that is characteristic of the Pknox
family, as well as the MEIS B motif (ID = 33/139,
E-value = 8 Ã 10-5). MlPknox, like the human PKNOX1
and PKNOX2 genes, has an intron that separates the
25th and 26th codons and one that interrupts the 51st
codon of the homeobox.
We were unable to identify an Irx homeodomain in
Mnemiopsis, despite there being Irx family members
from Amphimedon, Trichoplax and Nematostella. Also
absent was the Tgif homeodomain, found only in cnidarians and bilaterians.
LIM class

MlIsl, MlLhx1.5, MlLhx3.4 and MlLmx make up the
four LIM class homeodomains of Mnemiopsis (Figure
4C). We assigned these four Mnemiopsis homeodomains
to the Isl, Lhx1/5, Lhx3/4 and Lmx families, respectively,
based on the consistency between tree runs (Figures 1
and 4C) and moderate support in the full homeodomain
tree (Figure 1). BLAST searches of the genomic scaffolds
containing Mnemiopsis LIM homeodomains reveal LIMtype zinc finger domains immediately upstream of these
four homeodomains. Additional BLAST searches also
reveal traces of LIM domains independent of homeodomains in the Mnemiopsis genome (data not shown), suggesting the existence of LIM domain transcription
regulator genes.

http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/9

SINE class

Eighteen SINE class homeodomains representing seven
distinct SINE lineages were recovered from the Mnemiopsis genome (Figure 4D, Table 1). Of these, all but
one have the characteristic lysine at position 50 (as
described in [21]). The exception is MlSIX41, for which
we are missing the sequence information from the
C-terminus of the homeodomain (including position 50).
Additionally, 17 of the 18 SINE class homeodomains
have a SIX domain upstream of the homeodomain. The
exception, MlSIX32a, is situated on the N-terminal end
of a small scaffold in our current assembly, so its absence
may be due to the resolution of our assembly.
The SINE class is monophyletic in our superfamily
tree except for a clade of five Mnemiopsis homeodomains (MlSIX59a, MlSIX59b, MlSIX59c, MlSIX59 d and
MlSIX59e), which group with Zhx/Homez (Figure 1).
This exception is perhaps not completely unexpected
given that, like the Zhx/Homez genes, MlSIX59 homeodomains are quite divergent; they are five of only six
homeodomains in our entire Mnemiopsis set that do not
include a tryptophan at position 48, which is characteristic of the typical homeodomain. The other homeodomain, MlSIX45, is also a member of the SINE class.
The Mnemiopsis SINE class homeodomains do not
clearly separate into the three families recognized in
bilaterians. Only two of the 18 maintain the four familydefining diagnostic residues (positions 3-6) in the homeodomain [50]. MlSIX41 and MlSIX27 have the SIX1/2
family âETSYâ pattern in positions 3-6 of the homeodomain. However, neither MlSIX41 nor MlSIX27 group
convincingly with the Six1/2 group. The Mnmemiopsis
SIX class is the result of extensive ctenophore-specific

Page 10 of 18

diversification. A more in-depth phylogenetic analysis
that includes SIX domains may provide additional
insight into these relationships.
Unclassified Mnemiopsis homeodomains

Two clades consisting of 18 Mnemiopsis homeodomains
appear as separate offshoots in our superfamily tree
(Figure 1, Table 1). None of these 18 homeodomains
have introns, or any of the known class signatures, that
would hint that they might belong to an existing class.
MlHD60 and MlHD79 have insertions that interrupt
the homeodomain but these insertions are unlike the
known insertions seen in the TALE, HNF and PROS
classes. The MlHD60 insertion consists of two amino
acids that occur in the third alpha-helix. The other
insertion occurs in the loop region between the first
and second alpha-helices but, unlike the TALE insertions, it consists only of a single amino acid. The average branch length of the homeodomains in these clades
is 5% shorter than for the other Mnemiopsis homeodomains, confirming that these unclassified Mnemiopsis
homeodomains do not simply comprise a clade of unusually long branches.
Missing classes

There are no Mnemiopsis homeodomains that grouped
with HNF, CUT, PROS, or CERS classes in our analyses.
Consistent with this result, no Mnemiopsis homeodomains exhibit insertions between the second and third
helices, like those seen in the bilaterian HNF and PROS
class homeoboxes. Besides the five apparent SINE class
homeodomains, no other Mnemiopsis homeodomains
group with zinc finger (ZF) homeodomains.

Homeobox linkage

There are four pairs of linked homeoboxes in our current
Mnemiopsis genome assembly (Figure 5). The tightest
linkage is between two ANTP class homeoboxes
(MlANTP19 and MlANTP47), which are 4.7 KB apart.
A different ANTP class homeobox (MlANTP68) is situated 5.0 KB downstream from the SINE class homeobox
MLSIX36. The HOXL-related ANTP class homeobox
MlANTP03a is separated by 26.0 KB from the PRD class
homeobox MLPRD16. The ANTP class MlANTP21 and
the SINE class homeobox MLSIX59 are on the same contig, 148.9 KB apart. None of the linked homeoboxes are
obvious paralogs, suggesting that these pairs are not the
result of recent duplication events.
Evolutionary dynamics of the Mnemiopsis homeodomain
superfamily

In order to better-understand the nature of the homeodomain superfamily in Mnemiopsis, we compared average branch lengths and the number of species-specific
homeodomain clades in the Mnemiopsis, Amphimedon,
Trichoplax, Nematostella, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis
elegan, and human genomes (Table 2). We performed
ML analyses with homeodomain sequences from this
set of species. Degenerate homeodomains (for example,
Amphimedon PaxB) and homeodomains from pseudogenes were not included. The resulting tree and alignments are included as supplemental material (Additional
file 2).
For each species, we recorded the number of speciesspecific clades that included more than one homeodomain, as well as the total number of homeodomains in
those species-specific clades (Table 2). These numbers
give us an approximation of the number of lineage-specific homeodomain duplications that have been preserved in a specific lineage since it split from its closest
relative in the analysis [51]. A species that has recently

undergone extensive genome reduction would be
expected to harbour less species-specific clades than a
genome that has experienced a recent genomic expansion. Our data shows that very few paralogous homeodomains exist in the Amphimedon (7) and Trichoplax
(0) genomes, whereas the human genome has a remarkably high level of paralogs (197). Mnemiopsis (45) and
Nematostella (66) are both very close to the mean
(Table 2).
Branch lengths provide a means of measuring the level
of divergence for a particular homeodomain. Longer
branches correspond to higher levels of divergence. We
rooted the same neighbor-joining tree described above
at its midpoint and determined the average branch
lengths for each speciesâ set of homeodomains (Table 2).
In our tree, the Mnemiopsis branches tend to be longer
than for all the other species except for C. elegans,
which is known to have very long branches [52]. The
Mnemiopsis average branch length is slightly closer to
the mean than it is to the C. elegans average, suggesting
that the Mnemiopsis homeodomains are moderately
divergent. The trees used in this analysis are included as
supplemental material (Additional Files 2 and 3) and
branch lengths can be visualized directly using a treeviewing program such as Figtree [53].

Discussion
There is strong evidence suggesting that Mnemiopsis has
homeodomains belonging to six of the 11 defined homeodomain classes (ANTP, PRD, LIM, POU, SINE and
TALE). Mnemiopsis appears to be missing the other five
homeodomain classes (HNF, CUT, PROS, ZF and
CERS). It is also missing ÃÂ¬the Hox/ParaHox and
extended Hox subclasses of the ANTP class, as well as
the S50 and K50 subclass of the PRD class. Given that
Trichoplax, Nematostella and the bilaterians examined
in our study clearly possess all of these classes and

Figure 6 Phylogenetic relationship of early-branching animal lineages. Given the conflicting results of several recent studies and the
current existing phylogenomic evidence presented in this study, we have constructed an animal phylogeny that includes two polytomies. It is
uncertain whether Porifera or Ctenophora branched at the base. The evidence from this study (and others) unites Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria
into the subkingdom ParaHoxozoa. The origins of class and subclass founders are indicated along major branches of the tree.

subclasses, the most parsimonious animal tree would
involve Ctenophora and Porifera branching off the main
animal trunk prior to the Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria (Figure 6). This configuration is congruent with
most of the previously published 18 S phylogenies and
results from several of the EST-based phylogenomic studies [12,15].
ParaHoxozoa

The apparent absence of Hox/ParaHox, S50 and K50
PRD and HNF class homeodomains in Amphimedon
and Mnemiopiopsis supports an organismal clade that
unites cnidarians, bilaterians and placozoans. Although
previous analyses have strongly suggested a monophyletic relationship of these three phyla (particularly
Collins [6]), we are not aware of any studies to date that

have given this subkingdom a name. We propose the
name ParaHoxozoa for the clade containing Bilateria,
Placozoa and Cnidaria.
Studies have shown that the ancestor of the ParaHoxozoa had at least one Hox/ParaHox gene [26,54] and that
these genes are missing from both ctenophores and
sponges ([55] and this study). While cnidarians and bilaterians have homeodomains that are clearly descended
from both ancestral Hox and ParaHox genes, Trichoplax,
has only a single Hox/ParaHox gene, Trox2 [54]. This
homeodomain consistently forms a moderately supported
clade with the ParaHox GSX family ([28,56] and this
study) and may be a true ParaHox gene. However, it has
been postulated that the Trox2 gene may be a direct descendant of an ancestral âProtoHoxâ gene rather than a
proper ParaHox gene [28,54,56]. The name ParaHoxozoa

our tree) and redo the analysis, the number of Mnemiopsis-specific clades does not change (Additional File 3).

Evidence distinguishing Mnemiopsis from the
ParaHoxozoa

Incongruence with the âCoelenterateâ hypothesis

The presence of ample paralogs in the Mnemiopsis genome suggests that it has not undergone extensive genome reduction. Currently, we cannot rule out the
possibility that recent duplication events have masked
more ancient gene losses or that the paralog count in
the homeobox superfamily is not typical of most superfamilies. Regardless, the level of paralog retention does
give some initial insight into the evolutionary dynamics
of the Mnemiopsis genome, while also lowering the
probability that the Mnemiopsis lineage at one time had
(and subsequently lost) these missing homeodomains.
The availability of other ctenophore genomes for future
studies and analysis of other gene superfamilies will help
to better-resolve the evolutionary dynamics of the Mnemiopsis genome.
The unusually high level of conservation of the homeobox genes and their vital roles in early development
further lowers the possibility that the loss of entire
classes and subclasses of these genes could be tolerated.
There are numerous examples of homeobox families
missing from a wide array of phylogenetically disparate
lineages. For example, Ciona intestinalis and multiple
species of parasitic platyhelminthes appear to have lost
several Hox genes [57,58]. In addition, the genomes of
Drosophila and human are each missing several homeobox families [26]. However, it is important to note that
no species examined thus far has been shown to be missing entire classes or subclasses of homeobox genes.
Long branches do have the ability to distort phylogenies
and the presence of longer branches in our Mnemiopsis
data set was initially a concern. However, if ctenophores
are among the earliest metazoan branches and substantial
expansion of the homeodomain superfamily occurred
along the lineage leading to Mnemiopsis, these long
branches are not entirely unexpected. Conversely, the
somewhat shorter branches in Amphimedon homeodomains, despite its early-branching phylogenetic position,
are likely due to it having far fewer paralogs.
Another possible concern is that our paralog results are
an artifact caused by the attraction of long branches and
that these long branches represent class members that
appear to be missing but are perhaps unrecognizable in
Mnemiopsis. Two pieces of evidence undermine this
assertion. First, C. elegans, which has 9% longer branches
than Mnemiopsis and 67% more homeodomains, would
be expected to have more species-specific homeodomain
clades, but in fact has 23% fewer (Table 2). Second, when
we remove the C. elegans homeodomains from the dataset (which vastly reduces the number of long branches in

A scenario grouping cnidarians and ctenophores into a
âcoelenterateâ clade consistent with the phylogenomic
study by Philippe et al. [10] seems unlikely based on the
number of clades that include a Nematostella homeodomain to the exclusion of a Mnemiopsis representative.
For example, Nematostella has representatives of the
ANTP homeodomain families Mox, Emx, Gbx, Ro, Mnx,
Vax, Not, Nk1, NK2 and NK3, as well as two ParaHox
and three Hox-related homeoboxes (Figure 2). If Ctenophora and Cnidaria were, in fact, sister taxa, an extraordinary number of gene losses would have been required
in the Mnemiopsis lineage, given the observation that
Mnemiopsis is lacking these families. This amount of loss
seems very unlikely given the pattern of paralog retention
in Mnemiopsis. A more recent study by this group also
failed to recover the âcoelenterateâ clade [15].
Mnemiopsis extended Hox?

The origin of the four paralogous Mnemiopsis ANTP
homeodomains (MlANTP03a, MlANTP03b, MlANTP03c
and MlANTP03d) that group with the engrailed family in
the superfamily tree (Figure 1) and with the Evx family in
the ANTP tree is difficult to interpret. The presence of the
HOXL signature in two of these four homeodomains,
combined with their tendency to form a clade with hoxrelated genes, suggests that these four homeodomains may
have descended from an ancestral homeodomain; this
ancestral homeodomain may then, in turn, have led to the
formation of the extended Hox (Evx, Gbx, Meox, Mnx,
Rough), Hox and ParaHox classes through a series of
duplications in the ParaHoxozoa stem.
Functional analysis of the MlANTP03 genes may give
further insight into the role of this ancestral gene, which
would be particularly interesting given the roles that
extended Hox genes play in critical biological processes
such as neurogenesis, myogenesis, axial patterning, segmentation, gastrulation and photoreception.
Identifying the basal branch

Despite strong evidence uniting the ParaHoxozoa to the
exclusion of Porifera and Ctenophora, it does not appear
that homeodomain sequences alone (at least based on
the current set of available sequences) will be powerful
enough to incontrovertibly determine the basal metazoan
branch. There are several unambiguous clades containing
Mnemiopsis homeodomains grouping with parahoxozoan
clades to the exclusion of Amphimedon representatives
(for example, Lmx, Hlx and Pbx). The many occurrences
of this pattern insinuate that sponges branched off at the
base of the Metazoa. This pattern is consistent with

Ryan et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:9
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/9

Page 14 of 18

many of the 18 S phylogenies (see Table 1 in [59] and
references therein), as well as a recent EST-based phylogeny [15]. However, there is substantial evidence suggesting the alternative relationship.
A number of parahoxozoan clades include Amphimedon homeodomains but lack a corresponding Mnemiopsis homeodomain (for example, NK2 and Irx). The
scarcity of paralogous homeodomains could be a sign
that the Amphimedon genome is reduced. This, in turn,
increases the chance that multiple homeodomain
families were lost in Amphimedon. In addition, the lack
of a homeobox associated with a paired domain in Mnemiopsis opens the possibility that the fusion of the
homeobox and paired domain postdates the divergence
of ctenophores from the rest of Metazoa. This would be
consistent with other phylogenomic studies [11,12].
It is possible that similar analyses of additional gene
families with the same set of taxa might be able to
resolve the basal branch. Alternatively, it could be that
sequence data from additional sponge and ctenophore
genomes will be required to satisfactorily settle the
debate. The current study does make a strong case that
this uncertainty might eventually be resolved using a
gene family-type approach.

duplications (reviewed in [60]). A recent study showed
that six of the eight Amphimedon NKL homeoboxes are
clustered [30] and are likely descendants of the ancestral
ANTP megacluster. One of the four Mnemiopsis homeobox clusters - specifically, the cluster containing
MlANTP19 and MlANTP47 - is potentially a remnant of
this ANTP megacluster as well (Figure 5). In our phylogenetic analyses, MlANTP47 consistently groups with
the Amphimedon NK5.7b homeodomain with moderate
support (ML bootstrap = 24, Bayesian posterior probability distribution = 95; Figure 2). The family-level identity
of MlANTP19 is uncertain but it does not appear to be
paralogous with MlANTP47.
It is very difficult to draw any conclusions as to the
implications of the other three linked homeoboxes, particularly given the difficulty of assigning family-level
orthology to the Mnemiopsis homeodomains. The process for detecting ancestral/functional linkages involves
identifying orthologs in multiple evolutionarily disparate
genomes. Therefore, it may be possible that these linkages are significant and, perhaps, representative of some
ancestral cluster, but the current phylogenetic resolution
of the Mnemiopsis homeoboxes may make this relationship difficult to detect.

Implications for the evolution of homeobox clusters

Conclusions
We have identified, named and classified 76 homeoboxes
in the Mnemiopsis leidyi genome. In many cases, we have
provided additional evidence for our classifications

Extensive genomic clustering of ANTP homeoboxes in
multiple metazoan genomes suggests that the ANTP
class homeobox genes were formed by a series of tandem

The first column contains the class (bold) or subclass (indented). A plus indicates the presence of a clear member of the class or subclass. Alternatively, a minus
indicates the absence of a clear member of the class or subclass. Inference of the homeodomain complement of the ancestral eukaryote is based on Derelle et al. [22].

through the detection of diagnostic residues, presence of
surrounding domains and identification of conserved
intron positions. We have shown that several classes and
subclasses are present in placozoan, cnidarian and bilaterian species but are missing from both Mnemiopsis and
the sponge Amphimedon (Table 3). Using a phylogenomic approach, we have determined that it is very likely,
based on the presence and absence of homeodomains,
that the phyla Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria are more
closely related to each other than they are to Ctenophora
or Porifera. Based on this evidence, we have proposed the
name ParaHoxozoa for the clade that includes Placozoa,
Cnidaria and Bilateria.
The expansion of the homeobox superfamily has played
a major role in the evolution of animal phyla [61]. An
understanding of this expansion, along with an accurate
animal phylogeny, is critical to understanding metazoan
evolution. With this new dataset and phylogeny, as well
as the help of functional genomic techniques, we can
start piecing together the evolutionary steps that led to
such astounding evolutionary feats such as the development of nervous systems, muscular systems, and complex
symmetry.

Superclass alignment

The Mnemiopsis homeodomains were aligned by eye to
the dataset used by Holland et al. 2007, which consisted
of all human homeodomains and a representative set of
protostome set consisting mostly of homeodomains
from Drosophila melanogaster [23]. We supplemented
these sequences with eight Branchiostoma floridae
homeodomains that are known to be missing from
humans. Insertions in the loop-region of the Mnemiopsis
homeodomains were removed as done in [23] and other
studies. In determining which amino acids to remove
from atypical homeodomains, we realized that there was
inconsistency in the Holland set as to which three
amino acids were removed between the Drosophila and
the human sequences. As with the human sequences,
we removed the 23rd, 24th and 25th amino acids from
the Mnemiopsis atypical TALE sequences and adjusted
the Drosophila sequences so they conformed to this
rule. Alignment is available as supplementary material
(Additional File 1).
Class alignment

Genomic DNA was isolated from the larvae of two separate self-fertilizing hermaphroditic individuals. A library
from one source was sequenced to 10Ã coverage using
454 sequencing: 8.1 million reads totaling 2.7 gigabases
were assembled into 29,877 contigs (contig-N50 =
11KB) using the Phusion assembler [62]. Subsequently,
we constructed and sequenced a paired-end DNA
library with insert sizes of ~4kb from the second genomic source using Illumina sequencing. These 2.8 million
paired end reads were used to compile the contigs into
10,106 scaffolds (scaffold-N50 = 123 KB) bringing the
physical coverage to ~50Ã.

The superclass alignment was divided into six separate
alignments, (1) ANTP, (2) PRD, (3) SIX, (4) LIM, (5)
POU and (6) TALE based on the best superclass tree
and the class membership of the bilaterian homeodomains determined from HomeoDB [24]. The three
amino acid insertions were reinserted into the TALE
alignment. To each of these datasets we added homeodomains from other non-bilaterian species based on
published classifications. We added 32 homeodomains
from the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica [30],
37 homeodomains from the placozoan Trichoplax
adhaerens [27], 127 homedomains from the cnidarian
Nematostella vectensis [26] and two homeodomains
from the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevis [39]. These
alignments are available as supplemental material (Additional File 1).

Retrieval of Mnemiopsis homeodomains

Phylogenetic analyses

A TBLASTN search of the Mnemiopsis assembly was
conducted using a set of bilaterian homeodomains
downloaded from the Homeodomain Resource [63].
This set was compared to and supplemented by previous Mnemiopsis homeodomains that were generated
from degenerate PCR and RACE [36].

The Perl script proteinModelSelection.pl (available from
the RaxML [37] web site) was used to determine the
best scoring amino acid substitution model for our
supertree alignment (RTREV +GAMMA). All subsequent analyses used this model.
Three independent runs of RaxML version 7.0.4 [37]
were conducted. Two runs used random starting trees
with the following command line (raxmlHPC-MPI -m
PROTGAMMARTREV -s ALN.phy -#10 -n NAME -k).
One run used a neighbor joining starting tree that
was generated with default parameters in Phylip
version 3.6a3 [64]. The command line for this run was
(raxmlHPC -m PROTGAMMARTREV -s ALN.phy -t
NJ.tre -n NAME -k).

MlPRD60, MlPRD77b and MlPRD86 homeoboxes had

of the genome and are included in this study. These
were isolated as previously described [36].

Ryan et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:9

Three independent runs of PhyML version 3.0 [38]
were conducted. Two runs used random starting with
the following command line (phyml -i ALN.phy -d aa
-m RtRev -a e -q ârand_start -s SPR âr_seed âcat FILE_W_RANDSEEDâ). One run used a neighbor joining
starting tree with the following command line (beorun
phyml -i ALN.phy -d aa -m RtRev -a e -q -s SPR).
Two independent runs with the MPI version of Mr.
Bayes version 3.1.2 [65] were conducted with the following
execution block (prset aamodelpr = fixed(RTREV); lset
rates = gamma; mcmcp mcmcdiagn = no nruns = 1 ngen
= 5000000 printfreq = 5000 samplefreq = 500 nchains = 5
savebrlens = yes; mcmc; sumt filename = tale_w_insert.
nex nRuns = 1 Relburnin = YES BurninFrac = .25 Contype
= Allcompat;). Log likelihood values were plotted and their
progression was visually examined over time. All runs
were found to be asymptotic before the .25 burnin
fraction.
Likelihood values for all runs (3 RaxML, 3 PhyML, 2
Bayes and 1 neighbor joining) were generated using
PhyMl version 3.0 [38] with the following command line
(phyml -i ALN.phy -c 4 -m RtREV -a e -o lr -f d -u
TREE.tre -d aa -b 0 -s NNI). The tree with the highest
likelihood value was chosen for all downstream analysis.
The best trees were as follows: Supertree = RaxMLrandomstart, ANTP = RaxML-randomstart, PRD =
RaxML-randomstart, SIX = PhyML-randomstart, LIM =
RaxML-randomstart, POU = RaxML-NJstart, and TALE
= RaxML-randomstart. The best trees are available as
supplemental material (Additional File 4).
Support indices

Support was assessed by 100 replicates of the bootstrap
using the method that provided the highest likelihood
value. Bootstrap values greater than 50 were applied to
the best tree. To these three trees, Bayesian posterior
probabilities were also added from the Bayesian tree
with the highest likelihood score. The best trees with
support values are available as supplemental material
(Additional File 4).

(Additional File 2). A version of this analysis was run
without the C. elegans data (see Additional File 3).
Branch length analysis

The tree used in the paralog analysis was subsequently
used to estimate average branch lengths (Table 2). This
tree was opened in FigTree v.1.2.3 [53], rooted at the
midpoint, and saved. This rooted tree was then opened
in TreeStat v.1.2 [67] and the Root-Tip Lengths were
calculated. A Perl script (calculate_average_root_tip.pl)
was used to parse the output of TreeStat and calculate
the average branch lengths. This Perl script, tree, and
alignment are included as supplemental material (Additional File 2). In order to compare lengths of subsets of
Mnemiopsis data, we ran a separate instance of this analysis, substituting the two-letter âMlâ prefix of the subset
to be analysed with âZzâ. In order to assess the feasibility
of using this technique to assess the relative branch
lengths from trees based on 60 amino acid matrices, we
performed a simulation study, and the details of this
simulation study are available as supplemental material
(Additional File 5).

Paralog retention analysis

From our initial superfamily alignment, we removed all
sequences that were not Mnemiopsis, Drosophila, or
human. To this, we added all Trichoplax, Nematostella
and Amphimedon sequences that were used in our
class-level phylogenies. Finally we added all the C. elegans homeodomains that were used in [66]. We ran a
neighbor-joining analysis using default parameters in
Phylip [64]. This tree was then parsed with a Perl
script (count_species_specific_clades.pl) that identified
occurrences of homogeneous clades of taxa with identical two-letter prefixes. This Perl script, tree and
alignment are included as supplemental material
