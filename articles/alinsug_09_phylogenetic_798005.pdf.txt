Abstract
Background: Although histone deacetylases from model organisms have been previously
identified, there is no clear basis for the classification of histone deacetylases under the RPD3/
HDA1 superfamily, particularly on plants. Thus, this study aims to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree
to determine evolutionary relationships between RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases from six
different plants representing dicots with Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, and Pinus taeda,
monocots with Oryza sativa and Zea mays, and the lower plants with Physcomitrella patens.
Results: Sixty two histone deacetylases of RPD3/HDA1 family from the six plant species were
phylogenetically analyzed to determine corresponding orthologues. Three clusters were formed
separating Class I, Class II, and Class IV. We have confirmed lower and higher plant orthologues
for AtHDA8 and AtHDA14, classifying both genes as Class II histone deacetylases in addition to
AtHDA5, AtHDA15, and AtHDA18. Since Class II histone deacetylases in other eukaryotes have
been known to undergo nucleocytoplasmic transport, it remains unknown whether such functional
regulation also happens in plants. Thus, bioinformatics studies using different programs and
databases were conducted to predict their corresponding localization sites, nuclear export signal,
nuclear localization signal, as well as expression patterns. We also found new conserved domains
in most of the RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases which were similarly conserved in its
corresponding orthologues. Assessing gene expression patterns using Genevestigator, it appears
that RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases are expressed all throughout the plant parts and
developmental stages of the plant.
Conclusion: The RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylase family in plants is divided into three distinct
groups namely, Class I, Class II, and Class IV suggesting functional diversification. Class II comprises
not only AtHDA5, AtHDA15, and AtHDA18 but also includes AtHDA8 and AtHDA14. New
conserved domains have also been identified in most of the RPD3/HDA1 family indicating further
versatile roles other than histone deacetylation.

Background
Histone deacetylases (HDACs or HDAs) have been generally responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on
the N-terminal region of core histones. This usually gives

a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role
in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and
developmental events. They are classified into three different families namely the RPD3/HDA1 superfamily, sirtuin

family, and the HD2 family [1]. Members of RPD3/HDA1
superfamily and sirtuin family are proteins homologous
to the yeast reduced potassium dependency 3 (RPD3)/
Hda1 and silent information regulator 2 (Sir2), respectively, whereas HD2 family is unique in plants. Phylogenetic studies classify the RPD3/HDA1 superfamily (nonsirtuin) histone deacetylases into three classes: the class 1
(RPD3-like), class 2 (HDA1-like), and an additional class
defined by the human HsHDA511 (also called
HsHDAC11) [2]. This third class has been named class 4
to distinguish it from the unrelated NAD-dependent sirtuin deacetylases, which have sometimes been called class
3 HDACs.
Among the RPD3/HDA1 superfamily histone deacetylases
in Arabidopsis, AtHDA6, AtHDA19, and AtHDA18 have
been demonstrated to play essential roles in plant development and environmental stress response [3-9]. Aside
from regulating rRNA genes and affecting transgene
expression and DNA methylation, AtHDA6 is also known
as a global repressor involved in JA pathway, senescence,
flowering, repression of embryonic properties, and establishment of nucleolar dominance [8,10-14]. Similarly,
AtHDA19 is a global repressor in embryonic and flower
development, JA and ethylene signaling, and regulates
plant basal response via interaction with WRKY transcription factors [3-5,8,15,16]. Studies by Xu et al. [17] suggested the involvement of HDA18 in root epidermal
patterning.
To date, there are 18 histone deacetylases known in Arabidopsis with the RPD3/HDA1 superfamily subdivided into
three classes [1]. Four proteins were reported to be under
Class I namely AtHDA6, AtHDA7, AtHDA9, and
AtHDA19 while three have been shown to be classified
under Class II, namely AtHDA5, AtHDA15, and
AtHDA18. On the other hand, AtHDA2 was the sole plant
histone deacetylase under the Class III group with no
other identified plant homologue [1]. Still, there are those
that remain unclassified but are grouped within the
RPD3/HDA1 superfamily such as AtHDA8, AtHDA10,
AtHDA14, and AtHDA17 [1,18]. On another study conducted by Fu et al. [19], results on the phylogenetic analysis of the RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases on Oryza
sativa suggested this group to be divided into four classes.
Due to the limited number of studies and incongruent
results using different plant samples, there remains to be
no clear basis for the classification of histone deacetylases
under the RPD3/HDA1 superfamily, particularly on
plants.
This study aims to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree to determine evolutionary relationships between RPD3/HDA1
histone deacetylases from six different plants representing
dicots with Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/37

Pinus taeda, monocots with Oryza sativa and Zea mays, and
the lower plants with the moss, Physcomitrella patens. Phylogenetic analyses of these 62 genes predicted to be members of the RPD3/HDA1 family showed that this
superfamily constitute 3 distinct phylogenetic groups classified as Class I, Class II, and Class IV identifying corresponding orthologues in all the six plant species studied.
AtHDA2 was classified as Class IV based on phylogenetic
analyses and sequence similarity to its mammalian orthologue, hsHDA511, and to distinguish it from sirtuin
deacetylases.

Results
Phylogenetic analyses of RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases
in Arabidopsis, yeast, and metazoans
Prospective members of RPD3/HDA1 superfamily from
six yeast and metazoan species (Table 1) including Arabidopsis were phylogenetically analyzed to determine evolutionary relationships and sequence homology (Figure
1). Based on the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from
1000 replicates, histone deacetylases similar to the yeast
RPD3 classified as Class I includes ScHDA202,
ScHDA201, ScHDA203 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae;
CaHDA3201,
CaHDA3202,
CaHDA3205,
and
CaHDA3206 in Candida
albicans; CeHDA301,
CeHDA302, and CeHDA303 in Caenorhabditis elegans;
DmHDA401 and DmHDA402 in Drosophila melanogaster;
HsHDA501, HsHDA502, HsHDA503, and HsHDA508 in
Homo sapiens; AtHDA6, AtHDA7, AtHDA19, AtHDA9,
AtHDA10, AtHDA17 in Arabidopsis thaliana. On the other
hand, Class II histone deacetylases manifesting high
sequence similarity to the yeast Hda1 includes the following: ScHDA204 and ScHDA205 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; CaHDA3204 and CaHDA3203 in Candida albicans;
CeHDA304, CeHDA305, CeHDA306, and CeHDA307 in
Caenorhabditis elegans; DmHDA404 and DmHDA405 in
Drosophila
melanogaster; HsHDA504, HsHDA505,
HsHDA506, HsHDA507, HsHDA509, and HsHDA510 in
Homo sapiens; while in Arabidopsis thaliana, AtHDA5,
AtHDA18, AtHDA15, including AtHDA14 with 78%
bootstrap support and AtHDA8 with 93% bootstraps all
belong to the Class II group. Another cluster grouped as
Class IV is only represented by the metazoans namely,
CeHDA308, DmHDA403, HsHDA511, and AtHDA2. The
emergence of the Class IV group from the metazoans may
reflect evolutionary divergence paving the way for functional specialization in multicellular metabolic processes.
Phylogenetic analyses of RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases
in plants
To analyze further the classification of RPD3/HDA1
superfamily in plants, amino acid sequences from 62
RPD3/HDA1 proteins (Table 2) were used to derive
sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses. The overall phylogenetic tree inferred to represent all the 62 pro-

data used to generate it. As shown in Figure 2, a Neighbor

Joining phylogenetic tree of RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases in the six plant species analyzed exhibited 3 different
clades isolating the AtHDA2 group from the other groups.
Thus, each clade can be classified as Class I for the RPD3
group, Class II for the HDA1-like group, and Class IV for
the AtHDA2 group. All the RPD3/HDA1 proteins in Arabidopsis were distributed accordingly to their proposed

Moreover, Class II seems to manifest three different clusters separating the AtHDA8 group, AtHDA14 group, and
the originally identified class II genes, AtHDA5,
AtHDA15, and AtHDA18 [1]. In previous studies,
AtHDA8 and AtHDA14 were considered unclassified proteins because they failed to cluster within the other HDAs
even if they share the same conserved amino acid positions for Class II proteins. In addition, there were no
known closely related proteins to compare with these
HDAs to establish its classification as a Class II histone
deacetylase [1]. Fortunately, we have identified representative monocot, other dicots, and a lower plant moss
orthologues for all the Class II genes including AtHDA8
and AtHDA14 with high bootstrap support.
Class I: the RPD3-like Group
For the RPD3 group, it appears that Arabidopsis AtHDA10
and AtHDA17 are orthologues of the pine PtHDA1801
with a high bootstrap support of 93%. Although
AtHDA10 and AtHDA17 are considered in-paralogues, its
emergence after the species split technically makes it a
bona fide orthologue [20]. However, the divergence of this
group from the majority of Class I may be due to its short
sequences but have high sequence similarity mainly in the
RPD3 HDA domain exhibiting 93% bootstraps. Moving
further, AtHDA9 of Arabidopsis was found to be similar
with the poplar PtHDA904 but with a mediocre bootstrap
of 51%. Its monocot counterparts OsHDA2208 and
ZmHDA102 manifested a perfect bootstrap of 100%. Its
lower plant orthologue PpHDA1506 from Physcomitrella
diverged early on from its higher plant homologues
exhibiting a 64% bootstrap. The poplar PtHDA909 and
PtHDA908 appear to be orthologues of Arabidopsis
AtHDA6 (80% bootstraps) which is highly similar still to
AtHDA7 (64% bootstraps). With a 99% bootstraps as
quantifier for its robustness, this dicot group found its
monocot counterparts in OsHDA2206 and ZmHDA108
which were highly similar demonstrating 100% bootstrap
support. On the other hand, AtHDA19 or AtHDA1 from
Arabidopsis is orthologous to poplar PtHDA903 and
PtHDA902 with 93% bootstraps. However, its immediate
sister group in Physcomitrella PpHDA1504 and
PpHDA1505 (with 100% bootstraps) showed low bootstrap support (41%) indicating that they may have the
same ancestral roots but are unlikely to be the closest link.
This gene group appears to be anomalous since Physcomitrella is expected to be the most ancestral which
should have diverged first before any higher plant species
split. It is quite strange to note that its monocot counterparts diverged twice earlier on during its evolutionary
process. The more recent deviation lead to the speciation
of rice OsHDA2205 and maize ZmHDA116 (100% boot-

straps) and another monocot sister group ZmHDA101
and ZmHDA119 (97% bootstraps). Unfortunately, this
two monocot sister groups have a low bootstrap support
(40%) with which only one of this group can truly represent the closest monocot orthologues of AtHDA19. The
earliest divergence, however, can be traced back to its rice
orthologues coupled with gene duplications yielding
OsHDA2204 and OsHDA2207 (100% bootstraps).
Class II: HDA1-like Group
Based on phylogenetic analyses as reflected on the consensus trees in Figure 2 and 3, the class II group is composed of three clusters wherein each cluster contains
monocot, eu-dicot, and lower plant moss representatives.
The first cluster is represented by the AtHDA8 group
which diverged the earliest from the Class II group (93%
bootstraps). The lower plant PpHDA1508 split earlier
from the line (100% bootstraps) followed by the monocot/eu-dicot split with a mediocre 67% bootstraps.
AtHDA8 from Arabidopsis appears to be orthologous to
poplar PtHDA905 with 78% bootstraps. Its monocot sister group comprises ZmHDA117 from maize and
OsHDA2211 and OsHDA2212 from rice (99% bootstraps) showing a perfect 100% bootstraps. The emergence of the second cluster made up of homologues of

AtHDA14 seems to take a different evolutionary route
from the classic lower plant/higher plant first followed by
monocot/dicot split events. The poplar PtHDA912
diverged early from the line (96% bootstraps) followed by
the divergence of the lower plant PpHDA1509 and the
rest of higher plant group (76% bootstraps) separating
further the dicots from the monocots (80% bootstraps).
The dicot group was composed of Arabidopsis AtHDA14
which appears to be an orthologue of the poplar (65%
bootstraps). Its monocot counterpart was basically comprised of the maize ZmHDA118 and Oryza sativa which
underwent further speciation producing 2 orthologues
from rice, OsHDA2214 and OsHDA714, both with 100%
bootstrap support.
The third cluster is composed of the originally identified
Class II genes, AtHDA5, AtHDA15, and AtHDA18 (99%
bootstraps). Both AtHDA5 and AtHDA18 belong to the
same group since AtHDA18 is basically a product of gene
duplication of AtHDA5. From the dicot group, only
PpHDA906 shows high sequence similarity to AtHDA5
(99% bootstraps). From its monocot counterpart, the
maize ZmHDA115 diverged earlier prior to the separation
of another maize, ZmHDA109, leading to the rice speciation of OsHDA2213 and OsHDA713, indica and japonica,

respectively, with 100% bootstraps. Moreover, the lower
plant moss HDA1511 (75% bootstraps) diverged from
the main line followed by the lower plant moss HDA1501
and HDA1510 which shows high sequence similarity
(100% bootstraps). This was followed by a dicot-monocot split (96% bootstraps) with the dicot represented by
the poplar PtHDA907 which is an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtHDA15 (100% bootstraps). The monocot group,
on the other hand, is represented by maize ZmHDA110
and rice which underwent further speciation in
OsHDA2209 and OsHDA704, indica and japonica, respectively, both reflecting 100% bootstraps.

The monocot group deviated from the eu-dicot group
(90% bootstraps) with rice OsHDA2210 and maize
ZmHDA120 as the monocot orthologues. The eu-dicot
group, however, underwent further speciation separating
the gymnosperm PiHDA1802 from the angiosperms

Conserved Domains
Different databases such as Pfam [21], InterPro [22],
Automatic Domain Decomposition Algorithm [23], and
UniProtKB/TrEMBL [24] were used to determine the conserved domains of these histone deacetylases (Figure 4).
Based on the sequence analysis from Pfam database, a
new conserved domain was detected in AtHDA9. A BH3only pro-apoptotic domain (BAD) from the Bcl-2 protein
family is encoded at amino acids 385–402. This protein
family is highly regulated by phosphorylation in response

to survival factors [25] not to mention phosphorylationregulated 14-3-3 binding with BAD proteins [26].
Although AtHDA10 and AtHDA17 are classified under the
RPD3 group due to sequence similarity with their histone
deacetylase domain, they do not contain any active sites.
On the other hand, Class II HDAs manifest variable conserved domains. AtHDA5 contains the histone deacetylase
conserved region at amino acids 46–348 with a histidine
active site located at amino acid 158. Two other conserved
regions were identified by Pfam-B at amino acids 383–
436 (Pfam-B 134244) and 438–659 (Pfam-B 18135). As
retrieved from the Automatic Domain Decomposition
Algorithm (ADDA) database, Pfam-B 134244 corresponds to a phosphate ABC transporter which is a substrate binding component. On the other hand, Pfam-B
18135 corresponds to a conserved 117 amino acid, hypothetical protein found in Pyrococcus horikoshii. Both PfamB regions were also found in its monocot orthologues in
maize MzHDA109 and rice OsHDA713 and
OsHDA2213. The poplar orthologue, PtHDA906, on the
other hand, also contains the Pfam-B 18135 region
together with a conserved sedlin N and transposase 24
domain. Sedlin N functions in endoplasmic reticulum-togolgi transport while transposase 24 are necessary for efficient DNA transposition.
AtHDA8 contains a histidine active site at amino acid 145
in the histone deacetylase domain (amino acids 39–335).

The conserved histone deacetylase region in AtHDA14
was estimated at amino acids 80–387 with an active site at
202 (H). In addition, AtHDA14 also contains a predicted
integral membrane protein DUF2275 which is found in
various hypothetical bacterial proteins and in RNA
polymerase sigma factor. However, its relevant function in
AtHDA14 remains to be elucidated. Its plant orthologues
also contain domains which can be traced back to
prokaryotic proteins but with unknown function such as
DUF1820 in PtHDA901 and DUF2089 in PpHDA1509.
However, its monocot orthologues uniquely display variable conserved regions such as Rab5-binding domain for
both rice orthologues, OsHDA714 and OsHDA2214. This
domain allows binding to GTPase Rab5 necessary for
Rab5-dependent recruitment of Rabaptin5 to early endosomal membranes [27]. The maize orthologue,
MzHDA118, on the other hand, contains RanBP1 which
is known to regulate receptor mediated transport between
nucleus and cytoplasm.
In AtHDA15, the conserved histone deacetylase domain
was estimated at amino acids 171–461 with its active H
site at amino acid 277. AtHDA15 contains a zinc finger
RanBP2 type region encoded at amino acids 86–115. This
Zn finger RanBP2 domain also appears to be conserved in
its lower plant orthologue, PpHDA1501 and
PpHDA1510, and monocot orthologues in rice,
OsHDA704, and maize, MzHDA110. RanBP2 has been
well implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Its zinc

finger has a high binding specificity to exportin-1
(CRM1), a nuclear export factor, serving as its docking site
for nuclear export [28]. Moreover, it also contains an
uncharacterized DUF2086 protein which is conserved in
bacteria. Based on the Pfam B database, an overlapping
domain, Pfam-B 108730, is encrypted at amino acids 1–
109, which is also found in its maize orthologue,
MzHDA110, at amino acids 24–82 and poplar,
PtHDA907, at amino acids 28–135. This uncharacterized
Pfam-B domain is homologous to a cDNA, FLJ32790 FIS,
found in humans and in pufferfish, Tetraodon nigroviridis,
which encodes a Tau-tubulin kinase 2 belonging to a CK1
Ser/Thr protein kinase family wherein mutations or
defects of which causes spinocerebrallar ataxia. This coincides with the InterPro signature database classifying this
region as a short repeat motif that will not fold into a
globular domain on its own unless more copies are
present. Tau-tubulin proteins generally promote microtubule assembly and stabilize microtubules. Thus, it is possible that AtHDA15 may localize and function not only in
the cytoplasm but also in the cytoskeleton and plasma
membrane as well. In addition, an aspartate-rich region
was detected by UniProtKB at amino acid 58–77. The
monocot orthologue of AtHDA15, ZmHDA110, contains
a zinc finger C3HC4 type RING finger that plays a key role
in ubiquitination pathway.

deacetylases in Arabidopsis. Conserved domains of
RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases in Arabidopsis thaliana are

162–168, HDA15: 484–491, HDA18: 538–549).

AtHDA18 is a tandem duplication of AtHDA5 with mutational insertions and deletions including an additional α
helical domain near its C terminal region. Aside from a
coiled-coil domain and leucine zip motif, based on the
pfam database, AtHDA18 also contains a domain of
unknown function, DUF220, at amino acids 43–55 which
can be traced back to archea and eubacteria. It also contains a 60s acidic ribosomal protein encoded at amino
acids 193–203 which serves a structural component of
ribosome for translational elongation. At amino acids
402–559, a CR6 interaction protein is encrypted which is
known to be involved in growth arrest and DNA-damage
inducible protein interaction. CR6 interaction protein act
as negative regulators of G1 and S cell cycle phase progression by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases. They also
function as a repressor of orphan nuclear receptor,
NR4A1, by inhibiting AB domain-mediated transcriptional activity [29]. Also, a conserved oligomeric complex,
COG6, domain is found at amino acids 629–641. COG6
is a component of a conserved oligomeric golgi complex
and is required for normal golgi morphology and localization [30,31]. There are other 246 Pfam-B matches for
AtHDA18 which still remains to be described and annotated.
For Class IV, AtHDA2 contains a domain of unknown
function, DUF1409, at amino acids 75–86 generally
described as short conserved sequences found mostly in
hypothetical Oryza sativa proteins with unknown funcPage 7 of 15

tion. Furthermore, a regulator of RNA terminal phosphate
cyclase, RtcR, is encrypted at amino acids 297–312. This is
usually found at the central region of protein sequences
and is known as a sigma54-dependent enhancer binding
protein which activates the transcription of the rtcBA
operon [32].
Subcellular Localization
Bioinformatics data were generated from five different
programs to predict the possible localization sites of Class
II & IV HDAs (Table 3). Forecasts from TAIR were limited
only to AtHDA5 and AtHDA14 with no localization predictions to AtHDA2, AtHDA8, AtHDA15, or AtHDA18.

The Subcellular Localization of Proteins using Local alignment (SLP-L) program [33], on the other hand, generated
very low reliability scores in the predicted subcellular
localization of Class II and Class IV histone deacetylases.
Similarly, WoLF PSORT [34] reported low observed frequency values for both classes of HDAs. However,
AtHDA5 scored relatively high for both nuclear and cytoplasmic localizations suggesting a possibility for nucleocytoplasmic transport. NetNES predicts nuclear export signals (NES) in AtHDA2, AtHDA8, AtHDA15, and
AtHDA18 with a threshold value of 0.5. Surrounding
amino acids of predicted NES residues also exhibit low
intensity signals below the set threshold value. Based on

Table 3: Subcellular localization of Class II and Class IV histone deacetylases in Arabidopsis were predicted using different databases

another basic region composed of at least 3 K/R residues out of 5 amino acids. Pattern 4 (pat4) is composed of 4 basic residues (K or R) or 3 basic
residues and either H or P. Pattern 7 (pat7) starts with P then followed within 3 residues by a basic segment with 3 K/R residues out of 4. NLS
score delineates the tendency of the protein to be either nuclear or cytoplasmic which is calculated based on its amino acid composition according
to the neural network developed by Reinhardt & Hubbard (1998). Positive numbers indicate higher probability for nuclear localization whereas
negative numbers lean towards more cytoplasmic localization.

Expression Patterns of RPD3/HDA1 family Histone
Deacetylases
Based on the Genevestigator from the microarray data
generated by Schmidt et al [35] and Kilian et al. [36],
AtHDA19 and AtHDA9 expressions significantly predominate other class I histone deacetylases in all the vegetative
parts as well as developmental stages of the plant (Figure
5). The highest expression for AtHDA19 can be observed
at the germinating seeds and bolting stages as well as
imbibed seeds. In addition, cold stress significantly
induces its expression. AtHDA9 is at its peak during developed rosette stage and concentrate mostly in the cotyledons. Elevated expression of AtHDA9 can further be
enhanced by JA and GA treatment. It can be observed that
AtHDA6 appears equally expressed in all the plant parts
all throughout the developmental stages but is highly
modulated by biotic stress induced by nematode. On the
contrary, AtHDA7 do not seem to be expressed at all in
any parts of the plant nor during developmental stages.
However, its expression can be induced by ethylene, light
intensity, heat, and biotic stress by Pseudomonas syringae.
The expression patterns of AtHDA10 and AtHDA17 are
similar in all the plant parts in all the developmental
stages and consistently the same still in response to all the
stress treatments.

On the other hand, Class II histone deacetylases have varied expression patterns with AtHDA8 predominating
mostly all developmental stages with its peak of expression during mature silique stage and in pollen and cauline
leaf parts. AtHDA14 manifests its expression starting at
the seedling stage with its highest during young flower. In
addition, AtHDA15 is significantly expressed at the root
tip and pollen while AtHDA5 is at its highest during boulting stage and in cork and xylem. Although AtHDA18
appears to be at a minimum during developmental stages
and organ parts, its expression can be induced by IAA, SA,
and cold treatment. Moreover, heat stress seems to upregulate most of the Class II HDAs while NaCl treatment
only stimulates AtHDA14 and AtHDA2 expression. Furthermore, the expression levels of all these genes, especially AtHDA5 and AtHDA2 are somehow affected by
biotic stress induced specifically by Pseudomonas syringae.

Discussion
With the exception of AtHDA10 and AtHDA17, all the
RPD3/HDA1 family histone deacetylases studied contain
histidine as an active site. Active sites are usually known as
catalytic pockets of enzymes where a substrate is bound
and converted to a product which is eventually released.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/37

In this case, acetyl groups are released. Thus, since most of
the RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases contain histidine as
an active site, it can then be speculated that all these
HDACs are functional as a histone deacetylase. However,
mutational inactivation studies such as converting histidine to tyrosine still needs to be conducted to confirm the
functionality of these active sites. Although HDA10 and
HDA17 both contain the conserved RPD3 histone
deacetylase domain, they may not be enzymatically functional due to the absence of an active site. These two have
been speculated to be mere gene fragments but its identical expression in the microarray data may somehow suggest subfunctionalization. However, there is extensive
evidence for HDAC-HDAC interaction in humans where
the RPD3-like HsHDAC501 and HsHDAC502 were found
in the same multiprotein complex [37]. In HsHDAC510,
the C-terminal catalytic domain lacks an active pocket
required to activate its enzymatic activity. Its deletion,
however, led to its sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibitors, trapoxin and sodium butyrate, suggesting that its
functional N-terminal and inactive C-terminal catalytic
domains interact [38]. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that AtHDA10 and AtHDA17 may interact and be
functional with an active histone deacetylase.
Domain analysis indicated that AtHDA6, AtHDA7 and
AtHDA9 have a poly-glycine rich region in the histone
deacetylase domain. In addition, both AtHDA6 and
AtHDA9 have an aspartate rich region at the C terminus.
Furthermore, AtHDA9 contains a BH3-only pro-apoptotic
domain (BAD) which is known to bind with 14-3-3, thus,
may undergo nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. The specific
domains identified in different class I HDACs suggest
functional specification. Indeed, AtHDA6 appeared to be
unique among the class I HDACs in Arabidopsis since it is
the only one that was found to be important in controlling epigenetic states such as DNA and histone methylation [10-13], although the molecular basis for how
AtHDA6 is involved in these process is still unclear.
There is extensive evidence to show that plant histone
deacetylases act as global transcriptional regulators playing crucial roles in a range of plant developmental processes and plant responses to a variety of environmental
stresses [3-9]. AtHDA19 has been well studied as a global
repressor where 7% of the plant's genome is either up- or
down-regulated in hda19 mutants [5]. Furthermore,
mutant lines exhibited a wide range of developmental
abnormalities affecting flowers and siliques, premature
death of seedlings, reduced male & female fertility, and
embryonic defects [3,4,8]. AtHDA19 has also been shown
to work antagonistically with GCN5 to regulate lightmediated processes [6]. Upon biotic stress such as wounding and pathogen infection, it regulates gene expression in
JA and ethylene signaling pathways [16]. In a recent study

by Kim et al [9], it has been demonstrated that AtHDA19
regulates plant basal response via interaction with WRKY
transcription factors. Similar to AtHDA19, AtHDA6 is also
known as a global repressor involved in JA pathway,
senescence, flowering, and repression of embryonic properties [8,10-14].
Prior studies by Pandey et al. [1] on the sequence analysis
of AtHDA8 and AtHDA14 suggested S. cerevisiae HDAC
protein Hos3 as the closest related protein but with very
low bootstrap support. Thus, with the failure to identify
more closely related proteins to HDA8 and HDA14, other
than Hos3, they have concluded AtHDA8 and AtHDA14
to be mere relatives of Class II proteins with AtHDA8
seemingly more related to the prokaryotic acetylpolyamine aminohydrolase proteins than Class II. With
the recent updates of databases, we have data mined and
analyzed the possible orthologues of these 2 proteins in
both lower and higher plants establishing its classification
as a Class II histone deacetylase. Moreover, the formation
of three clusters separating the AtHDA8 group, AtHDA14
group, and the originally identified class II genes,
AtHDA5, AtHDA15, and AtHDA18 may suggest functional diversification.
With AtHDA15 containing a RanBP2 type zinc finger
which serves as a docking site for exportin-1 for nuclear
export, it also contains a Tau-tubulin kinase 2 which promotes microtubule assembly and stabilization which
oftentimes result in a stiffening effect of the microtubules.
Thus, this may append the potential of AtHDA15 to localize not only in the cytoplasm but aggregate as well in
microtubules, cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. On
the other hand, AtHDA18 may play multiple roles other
than histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression.
With its multiple conserved domains intact, it is probable
that HDA18 may also play crucial roles in translational
elongation, cell cycle inhibition, DNA-damage mechanisms, and golgi morphology. Although its amino acid
sequence is merely a product of duplication of AtHDA5
coupled with evolutionary winnowing, AtHDA18 appears
to be an interesting protein among the Class II HDAs due
to its multiple conserved domains and upregulation by
stress treatments. However, functional analyses such as
loss-of-function and/or gain-of-function studies as well as
localization analysis are needed to further analyze its
potential functions.
AtHDA18 has been implicated to have an active role in
root epidermal patterning such that reduced HDAC activity via trichostatin A (TSA) treatment deregulates the
expression of key patterning genes GLABRA2 (GL2),
CAPRICE (CPC) and WEREWOLF (WER) [17]. Such
deregulation had led to elevated expression of CPC and
GL2 at the hair forming (H) position leading to increased

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/37

root hair formation and altered cellular patterning in
hda18 mutants. Although hda5 and hda14 mutants similarly exhibited increased root hairs, only HDA18 was
implicated to be involved in root epidermal patterning
due to its altered cellular pattern similarly manifested by
TSA treated plants. However, it still remains unclear how
HDA18 specifically takes part at the interplay between
these key genes in root epidermal patterning and the yet
unidentified "positional cue". In a recent study conducted
by Caro et al [39], a GL2-expression modulator (GEM) is
recruited specifically at the promoter regions of CPC and
GL2 manifesting histone H3 hyperacetylation and H3K9
methylation restricting cell division and negatively regulating GL2 expression. Assuming the CR6 domain in
AtHDA18 is functional, there is a possibility for AtHDA18
acting in tandem with GEM maintaining a closed chromatin configuration at the GL2, CPC, and/or WER loci while
simultaneously modulating cell division by inhibiting
cyclin dependent kinases for DNA licensing. In another
perspective, there is a possibility for functional redundancy between HDA5 and HDA18, since HDA18 is basically a duplication of HDA5 and share 84% homology
mostly in the conserved HDA domain [1].
Most of the plant Class II HDACs contain nuclear export
and import signals indicating their potential for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Similar to mammalian Class II
HDACs, all 5 plant Class II HDACs contain conserved Ser/
Thr residues (Figure 6) which are potential phosphorylation sites for 14-3-3 binding. However, mammalian Class
II HDACs are group into Class IIa (HsHDA504,
HsHDA505, HsHDA507, HsHDA509) and Class IIb
(HsHDA506 and HsHDA507) [20]. Class IIa HDACs are
dependent on 14-3-3 binding to translocate into the cytoplasm and binds with myocyte enhance factor 2 (MEF2)
when it shuttles back to the nucleus and becomes active as
a histone deacetylase. On the other hand, Class IIb
HDACs contain double domains and are dependent on
strong NES and NLS for its nuclear import and export. In
plants, however, all the Class II HDAs may potentially be
regulated via 14-3-3 proteins for cytoplasmic translocation. Given the proper signals for these HDAs to be translocated back into the nucleus, dephosphorylated, and
activated as a histone deacetylase, they may bind to
MADS-box type II transcription factors which are the
plant homologues of MEF2 [40].
In addition, AtHDA2 is still neither classified as Class I
nor Class II but rather confirms Pandey et al [1] findings
isolating it as a separate group within the RPD3/HDA1
superfamily. To refrain from ambiguous and overlapping
class groupings, AtHDA2 and its plant orthologues have
been classified as Class IV since AtHDA2 is the plant
orthologue of the mammalian HsHDA511 previously
designated as Class IV [2,41]. Although we found its cor-

responding orthologues from all the six plants studied, it
still remains unclear how this protein differs from Class I
and Class II other than functional diversification. In terms
of localization based on bioinformatics, AtHDA2 may
similarly be exported out of the nucleus just like Class II
HDAs due to the presence of multiple NES. However, the
mechanisms underlying such process may be different

from Class II. With the rtcR imprinted within its sequence,
it is more likely that AtHDA2 remains nuclear as it may be
actively involved in regulating the transcription of the
rtcBA operon. Nevertheless, further experiments should
be conducted to confirm its localization site/s as well as
functional activities within and outside the nucleus.

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:37

It should be noted, however, that all the Class II and Class
IV histone deacetylases still contain conserved domains
with unknown functions which can be traced back from
prokaryotic origins. Based on its evolutionary history, histone deacetylases belong to an ancient protein superfamily which also includes acetoin ulitilization proteins
and acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases found in eubacteria and archeal bacteria, respectively. Thus, the evolutionary retention of these domains suggests critical functions
which may or may not influence its role as a histone
deacetylase.

Conclusion
The RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylase family in plants is
divided into three distinct groups namely, Class I, Class II,
and Class IV. All the 62 genes studied from six different
plant species were grouped accordingly identifying their
corresponding orthologues. Moreover, Class II comprises
not only AtHDA5, AtHDA15, and AtHDA18 but also
includes AtHDA8 and AtHDA14 with their parallel orthologues from all the six plants exhibiting similar conserved
domains. Although there is a high prognosis for this
group to translocate both in the nucleus and cytoplasm
due to the presence of NES, NLS, and conserved Ser/Thr
residues for 14-3-3 binding, intensive studies are needed
to further support this. If plant Class II HDAs can indeed
translocate into the cytoplasm, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling then becomes a hallmark for all Class II histone
deacetylases likely conserved in the eukaryotes. Thus, it is
speculated that this novel characteristic trait may be well
encrypted within its conserved regions which is part and
parcel of its versatile function and regulation as a histone
deacetylase. In addition, there are numerous conserved
domains imprinted within each RPD3/HDA1 protein
indicating versatile functions other than histone
deacetylation and transcriptional repression but also in
phosphate ABC transport, microtubule assembly, and
golgi morphology just to name a few. Nevertheless, further studies are still needed to elucidate clearly the functional roles of these histone deacetylases in plants.

plant Chromatin Database (ChromDB) http://
www.chromdb.org/index.html were also used for multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW2 http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html. Highly conserved regions were highlighted in black. Generated phylograms based on the sequence alignments from
ClustalW2 were compared with phylogenetic trees
inferred from MEGA4.

MVA carried out the phylogenetic and bioinformatics
studies, conducted analysis for expression patterns of
Class II and Class IV HDAs, and drafted the manuscript.
CWY conducted analysis for expression patterns of Class I
HDAs and help draft the manuscript. KW conceived and
designed the study and drafted the manuscript. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
