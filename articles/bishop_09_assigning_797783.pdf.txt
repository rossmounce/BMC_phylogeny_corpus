Abstract
Background: Methods for assigning strains to bacterial species are cumbersome and no longer fit
for purpose. The concatenated sequences of multiple house-keeping genes have been shown to be
able to define and circumscribe bacterial species as sequence clusters. The advantage of this
approach (multilocus sequence analysis; MLSA) is that, for any group of related species, a strain
database can be produced and combined with software that allows query strains to be assigned to
species via the internet. As an exemplar of this approach, we have studied a group of species, the
viridans streptococci, which are very difficult to assign to species using standard taxonomic
procedures, and have developed a website that allows species assignment via the internet.
Results: Seven house-keeping gene sequences were obtained from 420 streptococcal strains to
produce a viridans group database. The reference tree produced using the concatenated sequences
identified sequence clusters which, by examining the position on the tree of the type strain of each
viridans group species, could be equated with species clusters. MLSA also identified clusters that
may correspond to new species, and previously described species whose status needs to be reexamined. A generic website and software for electronic taxonomy was developed. This site http:/
/www.eMLSA.net allows the sequences of the seven gene fragments of a query strain to be entered
and for the species assignment to be returned, according to its position within an assigned species
cluster on the reference tree.
Conclusion: The MLSA approach resulted in the identification of well-resolved species clusters
within this taxonomically challenging group and, using the software we have developed, allows
unknown strains to be assigned to viridans species via the internet. Submission of new strains will
provide a growing resource for the taxonomy of viridans group streptococci, allowing the
recognition of potential new species and taxonomic anomalies. More generally, as the software at
the MLSA website is generic, MLSA schemes and strain databases for other groups of related
species can be hosted at this website, providing a portal for microbial electronic taxonomy.

Background
The methods used to assign strains to bacterial species,
and the definition of species, have been much debated [14]. There is widespread recognition that the current methods of defining prokaryotic species are no longer adequate
and there has been little progress in developing an agreed
concept of species that can guide a new definition of species [5-7]. The current approach for distinguishing species
within a genus, and for defining new species, is based on
polyphasic taxonomy, which incorporates all available
phenotypic and genotypic data into a consensus classification [8]. The accepted genotypic method for defining species is based on overall genomic relatedness, such that
strains which share approximately 70% or more relatedness using DNA-DNA hybridization, with 5°C or less ΔTm
(the difference in the melting temperature between
homologous and heterologous hybrids), under standard
conditions, are considered to be members of the same
species [9]. The cut-off value implied by this definition
may not be appropriate for all bacterial populations and
in recent years a move away from this cumbersome procedure to other ways of identifying and circumscribing bacterial species has been encouraged [10].
One approach is to observe the distribution of a large
number of strains of closely related species in sequence
space and to identify clusters of strains that are well
resolved from other clusters. This approach has been
developed by using the concatenated sequences of multiple core (house-keeping) genes to assess clustering patterns, and has been called multilocus sequence analysis
(MLSA) [2,11] or multilocus sequence phylogenetic analysis [12]. MLSA has been used successfully to explore clustering patterns among large numbers of strains assigned to
very closely related species by current taxonomic methods
[12-18], to look at the relationships between small numbers of strains within a genus [19], or within a broader taxonomic grouping [20], and to address specific taxonomic
questions [21,22]. More generally, the method can be
used to ask whether bacterial species exist – that is, to
observe whether large populations of similar strains invariably fall into well-resolved clusters, or whether in some
cases there is a genetic continuum in which clear separation into clusters is not observed.
Although there are limitations of the MLSA approach
[11], it is attractive since it should allow the assignment of
unknown strains to species clusters via the internet (electronic taxonomy), in a similar way that isolates have been
assigned to strains (sequence types) or clonal complexes
within a species using multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
[23]. Electronic taxonomy requires the recognition and
circumscription of species by the generation of a large initial database (and associated MLSA data) of multiple
strains from all of the recognized species within a genus,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/3

or part of a genus. It also requires a website and software
that allow the sequences from the house-keeping genes of
a new query strain to be entered via the internet, and for
the sequence cluster (if any) within which the query strain
falls to be returned, along with a species assignment for
the strain. The approach therefore allows species assignment via the internet and also allows the recognition of
the appearance in the database of new clusters, which can
be assigned as new candidate species.
We describe an exemplar for electronic taxonomy (and a
generic website) using the viridans group streptococci,
since the taxonomy of this group has been, and to some
extent remains, problematic [24]. The non-pyogenic
streptococci are subdivided into the Mitis, Anginosus, Salivarius, Mutans and Bovis groups, of which the first three
are often referred to as viridans streptococci. The Mitis
group currently includes the important pathogen S. pneumoniae and 12 other validly described species, S. australis,
S. cristatus (formerly S. crista), S. gordonii, S. infantis, S.
mitis, S. oligofermentans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis (formerly
S. parasanguis), S. peroris, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. sanguinis
(formerly S. sanguis) and S. sinensis. The Anginosus group
includes three recognized species, S. anginosus, S. constellatus (including two subspecies subsp. constellatus and subsp.
pharyngis) and S. intermedius, and the Salivarius group
includes S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, and S. thermophilus. All
viridans streptococci (with the exception of S. thermophilus, which is not associated with humans) are commensals of the human upper respiratory tract and,
excepting S. pneumoniae, rarely cause disease in immunecompetent individuals. They have been strikingly resistant
to satisfactory classification, reflected in frequently changing nomenclature and significant problems of identification by phenotypic analysis and by sequencing of 16S
rRNA genes [16,25-33].
There is extensive evidence that recombination occurs
between closely related Mitis group species [34-38], which
can lead to fuzzy species [14], and may explain some of
the taxonomic confusion within this group, and could
prevent the identification of well-resolved sequence clusters. However, initial studies of the Mitis group using
MLSA have shown that sequence clusters corresponding
to S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis
can be resolved using trees constructed from the concatenated sequences of six of the seven housekeeping genes
used in the S. pneumoniae MLST scheme [11,39]. Similarly, concatenation of the sequences of four house-keeping genes has been shown to resolve the more distantly
related species within the viridans streptococci [16],
although with four genes there was poor resolution
between the strains of the closely related species, S. pseudopneumoniae and S. mitis [18].

In this study, the sequences of a set of seven house-keeping gene fragments were obtained from 420 strains,
including strains of all species within the Mitis, Anginosus
and Salivarius group streptococci, to develop a viridans
group MLSA scheme and strain database. A generic openaccess MLSA website http://www.eMLSA.net was developed that allows query strains to be assigned via the internet to known species clusters, to as yet unnamed sequence
clusters, or as single divergent genotypes.

Results
Amplification and sequencing of gene fragments from
viridans group streptococci
The primers for the amplification of internal fragments of
eight house-keeping gene fragments were selected as in
Methods (Table 1). The primers successfully amplified the
eight gene fragments from 326 of the 375 (87%) Mitis
group strains that were examined. They also amplified the
correct fragments from some streptococcal species outside
the Mitis group, including all strains of S. anginosus, S. vestibularis and S. pyogenes that were examined. However, the
guaA gene could not be amplified from some strains
(mostly S. sanguinis and S. cristatus) and this gene was
eliminated to produce the final seven-locus MLSA
scheme. The seven selected house-keeping genes could be
amplified from all viridans group streptococci that were
examined and were at least 40 kb apart on the S. pneumoniae R6 chromosome.

For each strain, the gene fragments were sequenced on
both strands and trimmed to defined start and end positions. For each locus, the trimmed sequences from all

strains were the same length, indicating that indels in
these genes were absent, as they were in the corresponding
S. agalactiae, S. mutans and S. suis sequences, and are thus
likely to be uncommon among the viridans group.
Identification of sequence clusters
Figure 1 shows a neighbour-joining tree for all 420 concatenated sequences (402 from viridans group strains, 17
from strains of S. pyogenes and one from S. agalactiae) of
the seven loci used in the new seven-locus MLSA scheme,
with the strains coloured where a clear species assignment
was provided by the laboratory of MK. The tree identified
a number of sequence clusters that were well resolved,
with ≥ 95% bootstrap confidence values for the nodes.
The strains identified as S. pseudopneumoniae (including
the type strain) clustered together but were not well
resolved from the S. mitis cluster (bootstrap value of 92%
for the node separating the S. pseudopneumoniae and S.
mitis clusters on the neighbour-joining tree, but only 46%
on a minimum evolution tree; see below). The S. mitis
cluster was unusual as it consisted of a set of closely
related sub-clusters arising from the branch that separates
the S. pneumoniae and S. pseudopneumoniae clusters from
that of S. oralis.

Concordance between these clusters and the assigned species names was imperfect, in accord with the difficulties in
assigning viridans group strains to species. However,
almost all of the clusters contained only one designated
type strain (Figure 1). Accordingly, the majority of the
sequence clusters may be equated with recognized species,
that is, S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. cristatus,

S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S.
parasanguinis, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius, S. thermophilus and S. vestibularis. The only exceptions
were the S. peroris type strain which, although on an unusually long branch, fell within a cluster that otherwise
included the S. infantis type strain and several reference
strains of that species, and S. oligofermentans that was
within a subgroup of S. oralis (see below).
For several of the sequence clusters there was complete, or
almost complete, concordance with species names
assigned on the basis of phenotypic examination. However, for some species (for example, S. mitis, S. infantis and
S. oralis) that have been affected by changing taxonomy,
or difficulties in phenotypic differentiation, there was significant discordance between the clusters and previously
assigned species names. The major anomaly was that
strains historically assigned as S. mitis fell into a number
of different closely related sequence clusters, particularly
those otherwise consisting of S. infantis and S. oralis. This
anomaly was due largely to strains initially assigned as 'S.
mitis biovar 2' being either part of the S. oralis cluster (see
below), in agreement with a recent observation [18], or
part of the subsequently described S. parasanguinis cluster
[26]. Besides the anomalous clustering of some 'S. mitis'
strains, there were single strains assigned as S. gordonii and
S. infantis within the S. oralis cluster, a single strain of 'S.
mitis biovar 2' within the S. anginosus cluster and a single
strain of S. anginosus within the S. constellatus cluster.
The strains within the major sequence clusters correlated
sufficiently well with the species names obtained through
standard taxonomic procedures, and included the type
strain of the species, that each of the sequence clusters was
considered to represent a species cluster. Figure 2A shows a
neighbour-joining tree for all 420 strains with the strains
within each cluster coloured according to their assigned
species names. Figure 2C shows the same tree with the Mitis
group clusters collapsed to show better the resolution of the
species clusters within the Anginosus and Salivarius groups.
A few strains that were on the fringes of sequence clusters
were not coloured, to represent uncertainty as to the species
to which they belong. The tree shown in Figure 2A was used
as the MLSA reference tree for assigning a query strain to a
viridans group species from its location within one of the
defined species clusters.
Comparing clustering patterns using different MLSA
schemes and different tree-building methods
If MLSA is to be a reliable approach to identifying species
as sequence clusters, the same clusters should be obtained
for the same set of strains with different sets of housekeeping genes. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the trees
produced from a set of 93 strains of S. pseudopneumoniae,
S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis that were characterized
by both the new seven-locus MLSA scheme and the earlier

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/3

scheme that used six of the pneumococcal MLST genes
[11,15]. Although these schemes used completely different house-keeping genes, the trees were remarkably similar. The genetic distances between clusters were, however,
less with the new MLSA scheme than with the earlier
scheme (Figure 3). There were two minor differences
between the trees. Firstly, two strains on the fringes of the
S. pseudopneumoniae cluster using the MLST loci were
allied to the S. mitis cluster using the seven-locus MLSA
scheme and were re-assigned as uncertain species. Secondly, one strain (768-1) was an outlier of the S. pneumoniae sequence cluster in the six-locus tree but not in the
seven-locus tree; however, its guaA gene was unusually
divergent and it was also an outlier when this gene was
added to the seven-locus MLSA scheme (Figure 4B).
The clustering patterns were not greatly influenced by the
tree-building algorithm. Figure 2B shows the tree produced by minimum evolution (a method based on local
optimization of an initial neighbour-joining tree), compared with that obtained using neighbour-joining (comparisons were restricted to these two methods since both
are computationally efficient, as required for the rapid
generation of trees on-line with sequences from large
number of strains). The assignment of strains to the
sequence clusters was the same, and the only significant
difference was a slightly more marked sub-division of the
S. mitis group into sub-clusters using minimum evolution.
As expected for sequences that are closely related, using a
genetic distance correction made no difference to the clustering patterns (data not shown).
Effect of adding an eighth gene to the MLSA scheme
To assess whether the addition of an eighth gene
improved the resolution of sequence clusters (particularly
of S. mitis and S. pseudopneumoniae), the 326 Mitis group
strains in which the guaA gene could be amplified were
used to produce an eight-locus tree, that could be compared with the seven-locus tree produced for all Mitis
group strains (Figure 4). There were only minor differences between the eight and seven-locus trees and, excepting the location of the S. peroris type strain as either
within, or an outlier of, the S. infantis cluster, none of the
differences affected the resolution of the sequence clusters, and the seven-locus scheme was chosen for all further
work.
Identification of potential new viridans group species
The MLSA scheme should be able to identify possible new
species as groups of strains, or individual strains, which
clearly do not fall within any of the known species clusters.
We firstly checked whether strains that did not fall into
known species clusters, or were outliers of species clusters,
could be the result of using DNA from mixed cultures. In all
cases, further sub-culturing of these strains (labelled in Figure 2A) and re-sequencing of the seven loci gave the same

Effect on clustering patterns of adding an additional locus (guaA) to the seven-locus scheme
Figure 4
Effect on clustering patterns of adding an additional locus (guaA) to the seven-locus scheme. The guaA gene was
successfully sequenced from 326 of the Mitis group strains and the neighbour-joining tree obtained for these strains using the

results as obtained initially, ruling out the possibility that
the position on the concatenated tree of these strains was
due to the use of DNA from mixed cultures.
One example of an unidentified cluster is provided by
four closely related strains (assigned by MK as S. mitis)
that arose as a distinct lineage from the branch separating
the S. mitis and S. oralis clusters (unknown A in Figure 2).

These four strains were isolated from members of two
families included in a study of the clonal diversity of S.
mitis within individuals [40]. Although the strains cannot
be distinguished from S. mitis by phenotypic analysis,
they may constitute a separate species.
Likewise, the two major clusters that include the type
strains of S. mitis and S. oralis both include several sub-clusPage 8 of 20

ters, which may warrant recognition as separate species. As
an example, 10 strains previously assigned to 'S. mitis biovar 2' [25], formed a sub-cluster (including strains SK34,
SK79, SK96 and others) within the major S. oralis cluster
(Figure 5), in agreement with recent observations [18].
These strains are phenotypically distinct from the remaining part of the S. oralis cluster by being arginine hydrolysis
and α-maltosidase positive, and by expressing the Lancefield group K cell wall carbohydrate antigen (data not
shown). In addition, all strains of the 'S. mitis biovar 2' subcluster lacked IgA1 protease activity (Figure 5).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/3

These gene trees failed to resolve the species clusters
obtained using the concatenated sequences and all individual trees showed anomalous clustering of some strains
(Figure 6; Additional file 1). For example, S. mitis and S.
pseudopneumoniae could only be resolved on the map and
pyk gene trees (Figure 6B). Similarly, strains of S. infantis
and S. australis could not be resolved on the sodA gene
tree, and strains of neither of these species could be
resolved from each other, or from S. parasanguinis, on the
ppaC tree (Figure 6A).

Another sub-cluster within the major S. oralis cluster was
also composed exclusively of strains that lacked IgA1 protease activity, while only six of the 59 S. oralis strains that
were not in the above two sub-clusters were IgA1 protease
negative (Figure 5). Surprisingly, the latter IgA1 proteasenegative sub-cluster included the designated type strain of
S. oligofermentans, in spite of its significantly different 16S
rRNA sequences [41].

Approximately 96% of strains assigned to a particular species by MLSA had alleles at all seven loci that were most
similar to those of other strains of that species and, in
individual gene trees, the sequences clustered with those
of other strains of the species. However, 16 of the viridans
group strains (4%) had alleles that were considered to be
foreign (see Methods for criteria used to assign alleles as
foreign). Table 3 shows the putative origins for each of the
seven alleles in these 16 strains.

Apart from these examples, none of the other sub-clusters
identified within the S. mitis and S. oralis clusters had distinguishing phenotypic properties, and their potential recognition as separate taxa should await further expansion
of the eMLSA database and comprehensive phenotypic
characterization of strains. A single strain (unknown B)
was located on a long branch on the reference tree
between S. agalactiae and the species clusters of the Salivarius group (Figure 2C) and its taxonomic status is
unclear. However, from BLAST comparisons of the housekeeping genes of this strain to the nucleotide sequence
databases this strain is almost certainly a member of the
Bovis group streptococci.

Assigning strains to species via the internet
The main features of the eMLSA.net website are described
in the Methods section. Figure 7 is a screenshot from the
species assignment window of http://viridans.eMLSA.net,
showing the position of a query strain (S. parasanguinis
SK264) on the reference tree, and the list of species assignments of the five strains in the database with the most
similar concatenated sequences, and their sequence similarity to the query sequence. In this example the query
strain is assigned as S. parasanguinis since the concatenated sequence of the seven MLSA loci clusters within this
species cluster, and the top five most similar concatenated
sequences are from strains assigned to this species.

Differences in diversity of species clusters
There were substantial differences in the extent of diversity
within the species clusters and in their patterns of branching. For example, S. pneumoniae strains formed a tight
sequence cluster on the tree and the average within-species
diversity was only 0.3%, whereas the average diversity
within several other clusters, including those of S. anginosus, S. australis, S. infantis, S. mitis and S. oralis, was 12 to 16
times greater (Table 2). Additionally, unlike S. pneumoniae
and S. pyogenes, where there is a branching structure within
the species clusters, with some strains being almost identical and others being more distantly related, the other species clusters typically included strains that were relatively
distantly related to each other (for example, the S. infantis
and S. mitis clusters), as implied by the long branch lengths
from each strain in a cluster to its node (Figure 2A).

Figure 8 shows a screenshot of the resident, resident compatible or foreign status assigned by eMLSA.net to each of
the seven individual alleles of the above query strain. In
this case, five of the individual loci are most similar to
sequences from S. parasanguinis (resident alleles) or are
resident compatible (for example, ppaC; Figure 6A). However, the pyk gene is within a cluster that is well resolved
from the main S. parasanguinis cluster and which includes
S. infantis, S. australis and S. cristatus (Figure 6B), and the
tuf gene clusters within the well-resolved S. australis cluster (Figure 6C). These two alleles are therefore assigned by
eMLSA.net as foreign, which may explain why this strain
is an outlier within the S. parasanguinis cluster (Figure 2A).

Clustering patterns obtained using single gene trees and
identification of interspecies imports
Neighbour-joining trees were constructed from the
sequences of the seven individual genes from all strains.

Discussion
The aim of this paper was to produce a generic electronic
taxonomy website and software that can be used for the
assignment of bacterial strains to species via the internet
and to develop a comprehensive dataset that can form a
framework for establishing a more satisfactory approach
to prokaryotic taxonomy. The viridans group streptococci

were chosen as an exemplar of electronic taxonomy using
the MLSA approach since their taxonomy by traditional
means has been problematic, with poorly defined species,
frequent revisions and changes of species names [24].
The seven-locus MLSA scheme resolved sequence clusters
that were broadly consistent with those expected from the
species assignments provided by standard taxonomic
methods. Importantly, except for S. peroris and S. oligofermentans, the sequence clusters included the type strain of
only a single species which, in a formal taxonomic sense,
defines these as species clusters. The location of the S. peroris type strain on a long branch within the S. infantis cluster is consistent with the close relationship between these
species in the tree based on four loci described by
Hoshino et al [16], and with % DNA-DNA hybridization
values as high as 62% between some strains of S. infantis
and S. peroris [30]. The lack of any other strains assigned
to the latter species precluded any further exploration of
the validity of the distinction between these two very similar species, but the species status of S. peroris needs to be
re-assessed.
The type strain of S. oligofermentans [41] was within the S.
oralis species cluster. Similarly, six of the seven individual
loci clustered with S. oralis strains; the other locus (sodA)
clustered with S. mitis. Sequences of three of the MLSA
genes (sodA; accession number DQ232554, tuf;
EU156926 and rpoB; DQ232508) from the same strain of

S. oligofermentans have been deposited in the nucleotide
sequence databases. These genes have sequences identical
to those we obtained, eliminating the possibility of any
errors in our data on this strain, and the species status of
S. oligofermentans also needs to be re-examined.
Otherwise, the major anomaly was the apparent difficulty
that taxonomists have in recognizing strains of S. mitis;
strains assigned on standard taxonomic grounds to this
species were found among several clusters, although the
major cluster included the S. mitis type strain. This problem is largely resolved by the recognition that 'S. mitis biovar 2' strains are a sub-cluster within the major S. oralis
cluster, as also suggested by Kilian et al [18].
MLSA schemes using different sets of house-keeping genes
should give the same clusters and this requirement was
fulfilled, although the resolution between S. pseudopneumoniae and S. mitis was less clear using the concatenated
sequences of the seven genes than with the six MLST
genes. The poorer resolution may be a consequence of the
method used to ensure that the gene fragments could be
amplified from all Mitis, Anginosus and Salivarius group
species (see Methods), which may favour genes that
evolve more slowly than the average house-keeping gene.
This was apparently the case as the genetic distances
between clusters was clearly less with the new MLSA
scheme compared with the earlier scheme (Figure 3).
However, the new scheme is favoured as it allows a much
wider group of species to be studied, allowing strains to be
assigned via the internet to all Mitis, Anginosus and Salivarius group species (and to some other non-viridans
streptococci including S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes) using
the initial database of 420 strains. The concatenated
sequences of some of these species differed at over 20% of
nucleotides and it is likely that the degenerate primers will
amplify the seven loci from other closely related streptococcal species, allowing the MLSA scheme to assign strains
to these additional species.
As new strains are added to the database, electronic taxonomy allows the identification of new sequence clusters
that can be assigned as new species. Additionally, the
mapping of phenotypic characteristics onto sequence
clusters provides an important way of exploring the consistency of taxonomic assignments. In some cases this
may produce evidence supporting the splitting of a cluster
into more than one species. This was evident among the
S. oralis species cluster where one sub-cluster, corresponding to 'S. mitis biovar 2', had clearly distinctive biochemical properties, which may be an argument for recognizing
it as a separate species.
The individual gene trees failed to identify the sequence
clusters that were resolved with the concatenated
sequences, a phenomenon observed previously in an

Examples of individual gene trees produced from the sequences of all 420 strains. A-C shows the ppaC, pyk and tuf
gene trees, which each fail to resolve some of the species clusters. Strain SK264 (assigned as S. parasanguinis; labelled in Figure
2A) was used as the query strain in Figures 7 and 8. The ppaC allele of this strain is assigned as resident compatible as it falls
within an unresolved cluster that includes the other S. parasanguinis sequences. For both pyk and tuf, the sequences from
SK264 fall within clusters that are well resolved (bootstrap values of ≥ 80%) from the cluster that includes all (or the great
majority) of the other S. parasanguinis sequences and are assigned as foreign alleles. For pyk the source of the foreign allele is
unclear as its sequence falls within a cluster that includes those from several species. For tuf, the sequence appears to have
been introduced from an S. australis strain. The major unresolved clusters in the trees are indicated.

MLSA study of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. mitis
and S. oralis [11,15]. The most likely reasons for the differences in the individual gene trees are either that there were
insufficient informative sites to resolve some species using
a single gene fragment, or that a history of interspecies
recombination has distorted the relationships between
species clusters. There was, however, sufficient signal in
the individual gene trees to resolve the species clusters
using the concatenated sequences of all seven genes.
Only 16 strains clearly had foreign alleles, which presumably had been introduced by interspecies recombination
from another viridans group species. However, the
approach used would not detect recombination between
very similar species that are not resolved on individual
gene trees (which are likely to be the most common
events; see below) and, together with the conservative
high bootstrap value (≥ 80%) used to define clusters as
well resolved, this may have lead to a considerable underestimate of the extent of inter-species recombination
within this group. The efficiency of recombination falls
off as the logarithm of the sequence divergence between
the donor and recipient strains [42] and, as expected from

this relationship, where the source of alleles could be
clearly assigned, most foreign alleles were from donor
species that clustered on the concatenated tree close to the
recipient species. For example, the source of foreign alleles
in S. pseudopneumoniae was S. pneumoniae, and for S. oralis
it was S. australis/S. infantis andIgA1 protease-negative S.
oralis.
Interspecies recombination could lead to a strain clustering on the tree away from other strains of the species if the
recombinational replacement is from an unusually divergent donor, or there is more than one locus that has
received a recombinational replacement. This phenomenon has been found with Salmonella enterica var Typhi
strains, where six of the genes used in MLSA clustered
within those of other strains of S. enterica, whereas the
purE sequence was about 6% divergent such that, using
the concatenated sequences, the Typhi strains clustered
slightly apart from the S. enterica cluster [43]. This potential problem can be recognized using the MLSA website by
examination of the individual gene trees and the resident
or foreign status of the alleles (and the percentage diver-

gence) in strains that are outliers of known species clusters.
How do the results described here inform the way bacterial species should be defined? Firstly, the patterns of clustering observed in the viridans group have relevance to
any method that attempts to define bacterial species using
fixed cut-off values, whether these are based on percent
DNA-DNA hybridization [9] or average percent nucleotide differences between all shared genes [44]. The very
different levels of diversity among the different species
clusters (Table 2) highlight the difficulties in defining bacterial species using a fixed cut-off value. The advantage of
electronic taxonomy is that species clusters can be identified and circumscribed by visual inspection of the tree,
without regard to preconceptions about the extent of

diversity a bacterial species should have. The diversity of
genotypes within some species of this group, and recombination among similar species, could make it unlikely
that there will be a single phenotypic characteristic, common to all strains of a species but not to those of other
similar species, which can be used to recognize each viridans group species. The requirement for a defining phenotypic characteristic for the official recognition of new
species can in any case be questioned as outmoded and
unnecessary if these can be identified simply by their clustering on a tree using MLSA [11]. Finally, as shown by the
unexpected clustering of the S. oligofermentans and S. peroris type strains, the results highlight how MLSA can evaluate the taxonomic status and validity of proposed or
accepted new species and can identify taxonomic anomalies.

Figure 8
Online assignment of alleles as resident or foreign
Online assignment of alleles as resident or foreign. Having assigned a query strain to a species (Figure 7), the locus view
page shows the assignment of each of the seven individual sequences as resident to that species (or compatible with being resident) or foreign. In the example, the sequences of five of the genes from strain SK264 are assigned by eMLSA.net as resident
(that is, S. parasanguinis) or resident compatible, but the pyk and tuf genes are assigned as foreign. The locus view page allows
the individual gene trees (in this case, the tuf tree) to be displayed to explore why the algorithm considers the sequences of an
allele of a query strain to be resident, resident compatible or foreign (see Figure 6 for details). The colour codes for species
clusters are as in Figure 2.

The number of house-keeping loci needed for electronic
taxonomy using MLSA is not yet clear, and resolution
between species clusters should improve with increasing
numbers of loci. However, in practice, the number will be
a balance between that needed for good resolution of species clusters and that which allows the generation of large
databases and the uptake of the method by taxonomic
laboratories. The number is likely to vary depending on
the extent of sequence diversity within the group and the
extent of interspecies recombination. In groups of species
where recombination is very rare, resolution between
clusters will depend on the number of polymorphic sites,
and the aim of MLSA is to use sufficient genes to obtain

enough polymorphic sites to adequately resolve species
clusters. For such highly clonal species three or four
house-keeping genes may be adequate to resolve clusters.
In groups where interspecies recombination occurs, multiple genes are required both to provide adequate numbers of polymorphic sites and to overcome the distorting
effects of interspecies recombination at individual loci, by
extracting adequate taxonomic signal from the weak signal present in each of the individual genes. Seven-locus
MLSA schemes appear to be adequate for resolving closely
related species that undergo relatively frequent recombination, such as the viridans streptococci.

It is tempting with a bacterial group that has been well
studied to select for MLSA schemes those genes for which
the individual trees give the best approximation of the
expected relationships among strains. However, for a general approach to discerning clustering patterns this is
unwise, as the expected clusters will not be known when
poorly studied bacteria are examined. Initial MLSA studies
should therefore use the concatenated sequences of all
selected genes to build a tree to identify the sequence clusters. It is advisable when developing MLSA for a poorly
studied group of species to select more genes than are
needed for the final MLSA scheme (for example, eight or
nine genes for a final seven-gene scheme), so that the least
informative can be eliminated from the final scheme. The
best gene(s) to eliminate can be identified by using the
tree based on the concatenated sequences of all genes as
the reference tree, and examining the maximum likelihood of each of the single gene trees as a fit to the reference tree, eliminating those with the lowest likelihood.
Although we have used the term electronic taxonomy, the
assignment of strains to known species and the identification and acceptance of new species cannot realistically be
automated as it requires the experience, knowledge and
judgement of taxonomists. The assignment of species
using MLSA for electronic taxonomy should therefore be
a community activity, in which those interested in a particular taxonomic group can share their experience and
knowledge to provide a consensual approach to deciding
whether new sequence clusters should be assigned as new
species. As with the MLST databases, eMLSA.net is an
actively curated open-access website and submissions of
MLSA data on further strains of those species that currently are represented by only a small number of strains
will help to circumscribe these species. Similarly, the submission of strains that are difficult to speciate by standard
methods may identify new sequence clusters, and submission of sets of strains of other closely related streptococcal
species will expand the breadth of streptococcal species
that can be assigned to species clusters. Furthermore,
those who consider they have identified, using standard
taxonomic methods, a new species within or closely
related to the viridans group streptococci can perform
MLSA and submit the strain(s) to the database to see
whether it matches any already in the database or
whether, once submitted, new strains that cluster with
that of the proposed new species appear as the database
grows. Developers of MLSA schemes for other closely
related bacterial (or other microbial) species are encouraged to host their data at http://www.eMLSA.net to take
advantage of the generic analysis software and to provide
a single portal for the electronic taxonomy of many
groups of microbial species. A site for the on-line speciation of vibrios is also available http://www.taxvi
brio.lncc.br, although at present it only identifies the most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/3

similar species to a query strain using BLAST, rather than
generating the more informative sequence clusters [22].

Conclusion
The identification of species by electronic taxonomy using
the MLSA approach provides a way of identifying species
that is as least as valid as any other current taxonomic
approach. The clustering patterns from MLSA provide a
framework for species definition that can be further validated or revised by mapping on additional phenotypic,
ecological or genomic data. Finally, this approach to electronic taxonomy, and our generic MLSA website, are not
restricted to identifying and circumscribing bacterial species and could be applied to the Archaea and some eukaryotic microorganisms.

Methods
Bacterial strains
The Mitis group streptococci studied here included strains
(numbers of strains are shown in parentheses) assigned
by standard taxonomic procedures (or, subsequently,
from their clustering patterns) as S. australis (10), S. cristatus (5), S. gordonii (28), S. infantis (24), S. mitis (88), S. oligofermentans (1), S. oralis (84), S. parasanguinis (25), S.
peroris (1), S. pneumoniae (51), S. pseudopneumoniae (20),
S. sanguinis (25) and S. sinensis (1). Strains of S. anginosus
(7), S. constellatus (4) and S. intermedius (2) (Anginosus
group streptococci), S. salivarius (4) and S. vestibularis (4)
(Salivarius group streptococci) and S. pyogenes (17) (Pyogenic group streptococci) and S. agalactiae (1) were also
studied. Sequences of the MLSA loci of the third member
of the Salivarius group, S. thermophilus, were obtained
from the type strain (ATCC 19258T) and from the genome
sequences of strains LMD-9, CNRZ1066 and LMG 18311
(GenBank: CP000421, CP000024 and CP000023). Two
strains of S. pseudopneumoniae (one of which is the type
strain ATCC BAA-960T) were from the study of Arbique et
al [45], who proposed this new Mitis group species.
Another 21 strains were considered to be this species as
they (and the above two strains) formed a well-resolved
sequence cluster using the MLSA scheme based on six
MLST loci [11]. Three of these were subsequently reassigned as uncertain species (see Results).

The type strains of all of the viridans species, except S.
pneumoniae, were included in the strain collection. Strains
assigned, or tentatively assigned, to the above viridans
species (except S. pneumoniae and S. pseudopneumoniae)
were selected from the collection of MK and were sent (in
most cases without the species name assigned by the laboratory of MK) to Imperial College London for MLSA. In
addition, a number of strains that were difficult to assign
to the recognized species were included, as well as 52 viridans streptococci recovered in a UK hospital from infections in neutropenic patients [46]. The S. pyogenes and S.

pneumoniae strains were from the collections of WPH and
BGS. In total there were 420 sets of sequences, corresponding to those obtained from 399 viridans group
strains (plus three extracted from S. thermophilus genome
sequences), 17 obtained from S. pyogenes strains and one
from S. agalactiae. Details of all strains are available as
Additional file 2.
The sequences of the seven MLSA loci were also obtained
from the complete genome sequences of S. mutans UA159
(GenBank:AE014133), S. uberis 0140J (Sanger Institute
website; http://www.sanger.ac.uk), S. equi 4047 (Sanger
Institute website) and S. suis P1/7 (Sanger Institute website). The positions of the latter species on the reference
tree are not shown in this paper as we have not examined
whether all seven MLSA genes can be amplified from these
species with the viridans group primer set, but there is an
option to include these strains on the reference tree generated at the eMLSA.net website.
Assignment of strains to viridans species using standard
taxonomic methods
The strains from the laboratory of MK were initially identified over a period of 20 years according to the current
taxonomic status by a combination of extensive phenotypic analysis, sequencing of 16S rRNA and sequencing of
selected house-keeping genes [16,18,25]. Serotypable S.
pneumoniae strains were identified by standard methods;
non-typable presumptive pneumococci were assigned to
either S. pneumoniae or S. pseudopneumoniae as described
previously [11].
Multilocus sequence analysis of viridans group
streptococci
Suitable loci for the discrimination of species clusters
must be present in all strains of the species under study,
and should be sufficiently conserved that a fragment of
each locus can readily be amplified from each species
using a single set of primers, but sufficiently diverse that
they are useful in resolving species clusters. Two of the loci
used in the new MLSA scheme (rpoB and sodA) were
included in the study of Hoshino et al [16]. To select additional house-keeping loci, we used the multi-genome
homology comparison tool available through the Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR; http://cmr.jcvi.org/
) to search for proteins present in all available streptococcal genomes that had at least 80% amino acid sequence
identity. This retrieved 138 proteins and, from those that
had house-keeping functions, the corresponding genes
were selected at random and examined for their suitability
as candidate MLSA loci. An alignment was produced of
the sequences of each candidate locus from S. agalactiae
NEM3 (GenBank:AL732656), S. mitis NCTC 12261
(available at J Craig Venter Institute website; http://
www.jcvi.org), S. mutans UA159 (GenBank:AE014133), S.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/3

pneumoniae TIGR4 (GenBank:AE005672), S. pyogenes
MGAS10394 (GenBank:CP000003), S. thermophilus LMD9 (GenBank:CP000421) and Lactococcus lactis II1403
(GenBank:AE005176). Degenerate primers were designed
for each selected locus, based on stretches of six amino
acids that were conserved in all these species, which
would allow an internal gene fragment greater than about
350 bp to be fully sequenced on both strands, and in
which no indels were found in any of these genomes.
The pairs of PCR primers were each checked for their ability to amplify the correct gene fragment from a diverse
subset of the collection of viridans group streptococci.
Those primers that failed to amplify the correct fragment
from all of the subset of strains were replaced with primers
for amplifying a fragment of another of the conserved
house-keeping genes, until a set of eight genes and PCR
primers were obtained that allowed amplification of an
internal gene fragment of each gene from the subset of
strains. On characterizing the full strain set it was found
that the primers for guaA (and two alternative pairs of
primers) failed to amplify the fragment from a small
number of strains and this gene was dropped from the
final MLSA scheme. The genes, gene products, primer
sequences, length of the sequences used in the MLSA
scheme, and the annealing temperatures for amplification
are shown in Table 1.
The gene fragments were amplified by PCR (30 cycles)
using, for each gene fragment, a single annealing temperature for all strains (Table 1), and were sequenced on both
strands, using the primers for the initial amplification,
with an ABI 3700 or ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer. The
sequences were aligned and trimmed to defined start and
end positions using MEGA version 4 [47]. The trimmed
sequences of the seven gene fragments from strains of
each species can be found at http://viridans.eMLSA.net.
The sequences of the seven gene fragments from each
strain were joined in-frame, in the order map-pfl-ppaC-pykrpoB-sodA-tuf, to generate a single 3063 bp concatenated
sequence. Unrooted individual gene trees, and trees
obtained using the concatenated sequences, were generated by neighbour-joining or minimum evolution from
the proportions of sequence differences between all
strains using MEGA version 4 [47]. The robustness of the
nodes was evaluated by bootstrapping (1000 replicates).
All of the sequences (including the concatenated
sequences and the sequences of each locus) from the 417
strains
can

Electronic taxonomy website
A generic web application for electronic taxonomy was
developed at http://www.eMLSA.net. This open-access
site serves three main functions. It provides a database of

Page 17 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2009, 7:3

all characterized strains of a group of similar species (in
this case, all of the 420 streptococcal strains characterized
by MLSA), to which new strains can be added by the user
community. Secondly, it allows the species assignment of
query strains and, thirdly, it allows the identification of
alleles that appear to have been introduced into the query
strain from a closely related species.
The database (available to download at http://viri
dans.eMLSA.net) consists of a table containing strain
information including, for each entry, the strain name; the
species name assigned by MLSA and by standard taxonomic methods (a comment field provides the basis for
these species assignments; another field allows the entry
of any unusual features of the strain compared with typical strains of the assigned species); the country of origin,
date of isolation and source of the strain (nasopharynx,
blood, etc); whether it is a type strain; the names and
addresses of the laboratories or culture collections that
hold the strain; the contact details of the person who submitted the strain data; and any publication relating to the
properties or taxonomic status of the strain. Further database tables hold the sequences that correspond to the alleles at each locus.
On-line species assignments
To observe the patterns of clustering of the strains in the
database, and to show the species cluster into which a
user's strain falls, the seven edited and trimmed sequences
of a query strain are cut and pasted into individual text
boxes. Sequences are checked for the correct length for the
locus and the absence of any characters other than A, C, G
and T; the submitter is alerted if any entered sequence is
of non-standard length or contains unexpected characters.
If the sequences are all of the expected length, they are
concatenated in-frame, and the query sequence is added
to the concatenated sequences of all strains in the MLSA
database. To construct the tree, a module of MEGA was
used (kindly provided by Dr Sudhir Kumar, Arizona State
University), which takes the concatenated sequences and
generates in Newick format either a neighbour-joining or
minimum evolution tree, incorporating options for a
range of genetic distance corrections and for bootstrap resampling. If the sequences have insertions or deletions
(indels), a modification of the software is used that generates an alignment of the concatenated sequences, which is
used by the MEGA module to produce the tree. A module
of Phylowidget (http://www.phylowidget.org; [48])
developed using the visual programming language
Processing http://www.processing.org, provides easy
communication between the tree diagram and the underlying database. Phylowidget is embedded within the website and is passed the Newick file generated by the MEGA
module for display as a radial tree (the tree can also be displayed in the standard rectangular format or in circular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/3

format). The position of the query strain is highlighted on
the tree and, using the intuitive click-drag-zoom interface,
the tree can be explored further. Individual gene trees can
also be constructed by the same method. A standard database search facility is available allowing details of any
strain or set of strains to be viewed, and a search box on
the reference tree allows the position of any strain to be
highlighted on the tree.
A species assignment can be proposed if the concatenated
sequence of the strain falls within a known species cluster,
and it can be assigned as an unknown species if it falls
within a cluster with no assigned species name, or as a
unique divergent strain if it clusters apart from any of the
sequence clusters. In addition, a list of the species names
assigned to the five concatenated sequences in the database that are most similar to the concatenated query
sequence is shown, together with the % sequence similarity values to these strains (an alert shows if there are less
than five strains of this species in the database).
The tree produced on-line must be the same for all users
of the website and only a single tree-building method is
employed within eMLSA.net and, as the tree is to discern
clustering patterns rather than phylogeny, an unrooted
tree is generated and is displayed by default in radiation
format, although other tree display formats can be
selected by the user. The default settings for the trees produced for a particular MLSA scheme (for example, minimum evolution or neighbour-joining), can be changed by
the curator of the scheme to any of those provided by the
MEGA module, and one of a number of different genetic
distance corrections can be applied. All of the concatenated sequences can be downloaded from the website in
MEGA format to allow other types of tree to be constructed off-line, using MEGA4 or alternative tree-building packages.
On-line assignment of source of individual alleles
To assign the alleles at each locus in a strain as 'resident',
'resident compatible' or 'foreign', the sequence at each
locus of a query strain that has been assigned to species A
is compared with all other sequences at that locus, and the
species assigned to the strains with the five most similar
sequences are displayed (an alert shows if there are less
than five strains of the latter species in the database). If the
most similar sequences are all from strains of species A,
the sequence at that locus is defined as a resident allele.
However, if the best matches are sequences from strains
assigned to another species, the allele is considered to be
foreign, as long as species A and the species cluster
assigned for that allele are well resolved on the individual
gene tree. Resident compatible is used where the allele
sequence is within a cluster of two or more species
(including species A) that are not resolved on the gene

Page 18 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2009, 7:3

tree. Resolution and lack of resolution between clusters
are guided by the bootstrap values for the nodes on the
individual gene trees separating the relevant species. A
cluster is defined as resolved if the bootstrap value of the
node separating it from neighbouring clusters is ≥ 80%.
To ensure that the assignment of alleles as foreign is
dependent on good resolution on the gene tree, a look-up
table was generated for each locus, which lists those species that could not be resolved on the gene tree for that
locus. For example, only two of the individual gene trees
(map and pyk) could resolve S. mitis and S. pseudopneumoniae strains (see Additional file 1). Thus, if the concatenated sequence of a particular strain was assigned to the S.
mitis cluster, but it had its five closest matches at rpoB with
S. pseudopneumoniae strains (or a mixture of S. mitis and S.
pseudopneumoniae strains), this would not be scored as a
foreign rpoB allele within the S. mitis strain, as the look-up
table indicates that the rpoB tree cannot resolve S. mitis
and S. pseudopneumoniae. This result is therefore consistent
with the S. mitis rpoB allele being a resident allele (resident
compatible). Where the best matches are not from species
A, but are from two species that are both well resolved
from species A (but not from each other), the allele at that
locus is assigned as foreign, and the source is shown to be
one or other of the latter two species. The website then
returns the predicted resident, resident compatible or foreign status of each of the sequences at the seven loci for
the query strain (or for any strain in the database).
For each locus, the website also shows the % sequence
divergence of the query sequence from the best-matching
sequences. These values identify sequences that are highly
divergent from other alleles of the same species, as one or
more divergent alleles could result in anomalous clustering of the concatenated sequence of the strain.
Strain submission to eMLSA.net
Submission to the eMLSA.net curator of the details of new
strains, with their sequences at the seven loci and the original sequencer trace files, and proposed species assignment, is strongly encouraged to build up the viridans
group electronic taxonomy database. After checking the
sequences for quality and correct trimming, and the proposed species assignment, each new strain and the strain
details are added to the database. Submission of viridans
group strains that do not fall within the existing sequence
clusters are particularly encouraged to allow the identification of potential new species within this group.
