the relative effect of gene-knockouts and genomecoli and S. cerevisiae reveals that asymmetric protein interactions affect gene expression,
<p>An investigation of metabolic
Asymmetric protein interactions networks in E. evolution.</p>

Abstract
Background: The relationships between proteins are often asymmetric: one protein (A) depends
for its function on another protein (B), but the second protein does not depend on the first. In
metabolic networks there are multiple pathways that converge into one central pathway. The
enzymes in the converging pathways depend on the enzymes in the central pathway, but the
enzymes in the latter do not depend on any specific enzyme in the converging pathways.
Asymmetric relations are analogous to the “if->then” logical relation where A implies B, but B does
not imply A (A->B).
Results: We show that the majority of relationships between enzymes in metabolic flux models
of metabolism in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are asymmetric. We show
furthermore that these asymmetric relationships are reflected in the expression of the genes
encoding those enzymes, the effect of gene knockouts and the evolution of genomes. From the
asymmetric relative dependency, one would expect that the gene that is relatively independent (B)
can occur without the other dependent gene (A), but not the reverse. Indeed, when only one gene
of an A->B pair is expressed, is essential, is present in a genome after an evolutionary gain or loss,
it tends to be the independent gene (B). This bias is strongest for genes encoding proteins whose
asymmetric relationship is evolutionarily conserved.
Conclusions: The asymmetric relations between proteins that arise from the system properties
of metabolic networks affect gene expression, the relative effect of gene knockouts and genome
evolution in a predictable manner.

Background

Cellular processes can only be fully understood by considering how the functions of proteins depend upon each other.

The relationship between two proteins can be symmetric - for
example, when they mutually depend upon each other for
their function within a protein complex. Proteins can also be

asymmetrically related. This occurs when the function of one
protein (A) depends on another protein (B), but the function
of protein B does not depend on A: A→B. For example, in regulatory interactions, the function of the regulator depends on
the presence of its target, but the target can often function
without the regulator. Examples of asymmetrical relationships also exist in metabolism. For instance, multiple
enzymes may produce the same substance (Figure 1), creating
a situation in which the function of the proteins in the converging reaction fluxes (A) depends on the flux through B, but
the function of B does not specifically depend on one of the
converging fluxes. With the availability of accurate stoichiometric models of entire metabolic networks, it has become
possible to infer symmetric and asymmetric coupling of reaction fluxes, not only at short metabolic distances, but
throughout the complete network [1]. Asymmetrically coupled fluxes, when related to in vivo flux measures, do not
exhibit a complete correlation (that is, symmetry) [2], and are
much more frequent than the symmetric fully coupled fluxes
(see below). Here we examine whether the asymmetric
dependencies between proteins, as predicted from models of
the complete metabolism of species at steady-state, are
reflected in several genomic observables: which protein is
expressed without the other, which is more essential than the
other for survival or growth, which occurs in different
genomes without the other and, finally, which is gained or lost
without the other in evolution. To address these questions, we
combined the dependencies of all reaction pairs in the metabolic networks of Escherichia coli [3] and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae [4] with genome scale data sets for gene expression
[5], gene essentiality [6,7], growth defects [8], and phylogenetic distribution [9].

Results and discussion

Most coupled reaction pairs have an asymmetric dependency
(that is, directional coupling): 82% in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [4] and 67% in the metabolic network of Escherichia coli
[3] (see Materials and methods). As these asymmetric relations are so abundant in metabolism, we asked whether this

characteristic is also reflected in other system properties of
the cell. Given an asymmetrically coupled reaction pair A→B
where A depends on B, but B does not depend on A (Figure 1),
we expect that if one of the two reactions is inactive, it is most
likely reaction A. To test this, we compared the asymmetric
reaction pairs in the metabolic networks of E. coli and S. cerevisiae with four main types of genome scale data in which
genes can be 'present' or 'absent'.
We first assessed the asymmetry in the lethality [6,7] and condition-specific growth defects [8] of gene knockouts. In an
A→B situation, we expect that if only one of the two genes is
essential or affects growth, this will be the B gene: in the
absence of gene A, a flux may still flow through the reaction
catalyzed by protein (gene) B, but without B, A cannot function. Indeed, we find that for 87% of the A→B pairs, in which
one of the genes is essential, B is the essential gene (Figure 2;
McNemar test; S. cerevisiae, n = 417; E. coli, n = 331; p < 1036). The result for the condition-specific growth defects of
non-essential A→B pairs is less pronounced, but still for 64%
of the conditions, the loss of B causes a greater growth defect
than the loss of gene A (Figure 2; two-sided Wilcoxon test; S.
cerevisiae, n = 141; p < 2 × 10-3).
We also find a consistency of the asymmetric relations with
gene expression patterns. Because gene A depends for its
function on gene B, there should be few conditions where A is
expressed without B, relative to situations where B is
expressed without A. As expected, the B gene is expressed in
61% of the conditions where only one of two asymmetrically
related genes is expressed (Figure 2; S. cerevisiae, n = 573; E.
coli, n = 1,166; p < 10-6). In conclusion, these analyses show
that asymmetric relations between metabolic enzymes are
reflected in system properties of the specific organisms.
Next, we asked whether the asymmetric relations between
enzymes are also reflected in evolution. Generally, functionally interacting proteins tend to co-occur across genomes
[10,11]. This raises the question of whether the asymmetric
relation of reactions is also reflected in the evolution of
genomes. Although asymmetrically linked enzymes tend to
co-occur [3], if only one of the two enzymes is absent from a
genome, we expect this to be enzyme A: as A depends on the
function of B, it will rarely be present in genomes where B is
absent. To test this, we analyzed the phylogenetic distribution
of all E. coli and S. cerevisiae A→B pairs across 373 species
[9]. Indeed, gene A is the absent gene in 62% of the species
where one of the two genes is absent (Figure 2; two-sided Wilcoxon test; E. coli, n = 1,225; S. cerevisiae, n = 2,242; p ≈ 0).
Besides asymmetry in the occurrence of genes in present day
species, we also expect asymmetry in the gains and losses
across evolutionary history. We inferred the occurrence of A
and B in their ancestors by maximum parsimony [12]. In line
with our expectations, gene A is more frequently lost (59%) in
cases where a presence of both A and B in the ancestor was
followed by a loss of either A or B (Figure 2; E. coli, n = 1,215;

Asymmetrically linked reaction pairs (A→B) related to asymmetry in gene essentiality, growth defects, gene expression and genome evolution. The
fraction (f0/1 = n0/1/(n0/1 + n1/0)) where only B is essential in rich medium (essentiality) or has an effect on the growth across conditions (growth), where
only B is expressed across conditions (expression), where only B is present across species (occurrence), where only B is present after gain, loss or
maintenance over evolutionary lineages, and where A is contingently gained over evolutionary lineages (contingent gain A) is averaged over all reaction
pairs (see Materials and methods). For conserved pairs there is no relevant result on gain, because too few (n = 2) events were found.

S. cerevisiae, n = 1,423; p < 10-7). Gene B is more often gained
(60%) in cases where an absence of both A and B in the ancestor was followed by a gain of either A or B (E. coli, n = 605; S.
cerevisiae, n = 1,449; p < 10-6). It is also expected that a gain
of A depends on the presence of B (contingent evolution [13]).
Indeed, a gain of gene A occurs more often when B is present
(78%; E. coli, n = 824; S. cerevisiae, n = 1,472; p ≈ 0) than
when B is absent (see Materials and methods). Finally, there
are also situations where a presence of only one gene in the
ancestor is maintained along the evolutionary lineage (that is,
neither of genes A or B were gained or lost). As expected,
maintenance of A absent and B present was found more frequently than the reverse (62%; E. coli, n = 1,223; S. cerevisiae, n = 2,230; p ≈ 0).

Aspartate semialdehyde
dehydrogenase
(asd)

Although the various genomic and phylogenetic properties
correlate significantly with the asymmetric relationships in
the metabolic networks of E. coli or S. cerevisiae, exceptions
remain where gene A is present while gene B is not. How can
this be explained? For phylogenetic presence/absence patterns, one explanation for these irregularities is species-specific differences in metabolism. For example, the large scale
replacement of amino-acid biosynthetic pathways by amino
acid importers in Thermofilum pendens [14] has led to a situation where aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd),
one of the basal enzymes for amino-acid synthesis, is absent
while homoserine kinase (thrB), which depends on asd, is still
present (Figure 3). To examine such cases with unexpected
phylogenetic occurrence systematically, we listed all asym-

phylogenetic distributions
The asymmetric relationship between asd and thrB, two proteins conserved between E. coli (green) and S. cerevisiae (blue), is reflected in their asymmetric
phylogenetic distributions. The activity of asd does not depend on thrB while the activity of thrB does depend on asd. Although in most cases both
enzymes are present or absent together (243), thrB is more frequently absent while asd is present (129) than vice versa (1). The exception to the pattern
comes from Thermofilum pendens, a species that has lost a large number of amino acid biosynthetic pathways, and imports most of its amino acids [14].
Note that a second asymmetric reaction pair between asd and the initial enzyme in the lysine synthesis pathway, present in E. coli, is not conserved in S.
cerevisiae.

metrically dependent reaction pairs that lost gene A but not
gene B in at least five monophyletic species (the expected pattern), and also lost gene B but not gene A in at least five monophyletic species (the unexpected pattern). Species with both
genes present or both genes absent were allowed in both partitions (Additional data file 1). Some of these cases indeed
reflect a change of metabolism, such as ubiquinone synthesis,
which, in a species like S. cerevisiae, depends on the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway, while in Homo sapiens tryptophane is part of the diet and tryptophan biosynthesis has
been lost but ubiquinone synthesis has been conserved. In
most cases of unexpected loss, however, B has been replaced
by a non-orthologous functional equivalent. Thus, the metabolic dependency of reaction A on B as identified in our reference metabolism may have remained intact, but the protein
catalyzing B has changed. We also found cases of multiple
functional specificities in orthologous group A, corresponding to a different substrate specificity of A in the species where
B was lost, relative to the reference species E. coli or S. cerevisiae (Additional data file 1).
Even when genes and reactions are conserved across evolution, the nature of their relation can vary among species, as it
depends on the overall functional and metabolic capabilities
of the organism. Such variations could reduce the extent of
asymmetry in the phylogenetic distribution. If this is the case,
we expect to find a stronger correlation for genes with a conserved asymmetric dependency between the distantly related
species E. coli and S. cerevisiae (see Figure 3 for an example).
Indeed, we find a stronger correlation between the asymmetry in metabolism and the asymmetry in genomic occurrence
across present day species and ancestral states if we consider
reaction pairs with a conserved asymmetric relationship (n =
16) between the two studied networks (approximately 90%;
Figure 2). Nevertheless, this set of conserved reactions has
few exceptions to the predicted asymmetry which, like the
exceptions above, can be explained by differences in the
metabolism between species (Additional data file 2).
Having established that asymmetric dependencies derived
from the metabolic networks are reflected in both speciesspecific system properties and evolution, we asked whether
this correlation could simply be an effect of local network
topology rather than the complete metabolism. We defined
network distance between two reactions in the network as the
minimal number of metabolites that separate them. For all
the genomic properties studied, we find in most cases that the
asymmetry is actually more pronounced at larger (non-trivial) network distances (d ≥ 4), with a fraction ranging from
56% to 99% (Additional data file 3). This shows that the asymmetric dependencies are not simply an effect of local network
topology.

Conclusion

We show here that the relationships between proteins that
arise from their functional dependencies can have an important influence on other elements of the biological system. The
analysis of relationships between genes has so far focused on
symmetric relations, including correlated and anticorrelated
phylogenetic distributions of genes, and on higher order logic
[10,11,15,16]. Our findings underline the relevance of asymmetric binary relationships between proteins, such as those
that can be inferred from metabolic networks, to explain the
evolution and functioning of the system. We demonstrate that
asymmetric flux relations between enzymes are more abundant than symmetric relations. Furthermore, we show that
this asymmetry is reflected in gene expression, gene essentiality and the evolution of genomes, even for proteins at large
metabolic distances. Our results suggest a potential to predict
asymmetric functional relations between proteins on the
basis of genomic data.

Materials and methods
Flux coupling analysis
Flux coupling [1] between reactions within the genome-scale
metabolic networks of E. coli K12 (iJR904 GSM/GPR) [17]
and S. cerevisiae iLL672 [18] was based on two recent studies
[3,4]. Flux coupling relies on minimization and maximization
of flux ratios (Rmin = lowest possible vA/vB ratio and Rmax =
highest possible vA/vB) to determine the dependency between
reaction A and B within the network (at steady-state [19]),
given mass-balance constraints and flux capacity constraints
(range of possible flux values; see also [1] for details).
In this study we mainly investigated the most abundant type
of flux coupling, referred to as directional coupling (asymmetric dependency): the activity (flux) of one reaction (A)
implies the activity of the other (B), but not necessarily the
reverse (A→B, Rmin = 0 and Rmax = finite value). These reactions are coupled, but may not always operate together. In
contrast, in fully coupled pairs (symmetric dependency) the
activity of one reaction implies the activity of the other and
vice versa (Rmin = Rmax = finite value). Calculations were done
without assuming a constant biomass composition to avoid
coupling of a large set of fluxes to the biomass reaction. All
biomass components were allowed to be drained independently of one another (see [1,2] for details). Directional coupling between reactions was computed at a condition where
all external nutrients were allowed for uptake and secretion
(via capacity constraints on the exchange fluxes with environment) [3,4].

Network distance
Network distances (d) were calculated by representing the
network as a directed graph consisting of nodes (metabolites)
and edges (reactions), and applying a shortest path algorithm. Distances correspond to the minimal number of nodes
that separate any two reactions in the network. To increase

the functional relevance of network distance, we removed the
most highly connected nodes, including ATP, ADP, AMP,
CO2, CoA, glutamate, H, NAD, NADP, NADH, NADPH, H2O,
NH3, phosphate, and pyrophosphate [20].
We grouped directionally coupled pairs (A→B) into two network distance groups - close network distance (d < 4) and
non-trivial distance (d ≤ 4) - to investigate whether the identified asymmetric relations are independent of network distance. Our conclusions are not affected by the exact distance
cutoff between small and large network distance (Additional
data file 3).

Subsequently, for each reaction pair A→B with a corresponding pair of growth effect profiles we calculated the fraction (f0/
1) of conditions in which reaction A showed no growth effect
while reaction B did (n0/1), relative to the total number of conditions in which only one of the reactions showed a growth
effect (n0/1 + n1/0). We tested the distribution of these fractions against the null-hypothesis that there is no bias, that is,
no asymmetry (H0: f0/1 = 0.5), with the two-sided one-sample
Wilcoxon test as implemented in R [21]. We averaged the calculated fractions over all pairs. For this and all other datasets,
our results were qualitatively the same if we summarized the
distribution as the mean or as the fraction of reaction pairs
with a f0/1 > 0.5.

Gene essentiality
Essentiality data for S. cerevisiae was obtained from the
MIPS (Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences)
database [7] (gene disruption table, 14-11-2005). Only essentiality information that referred to an original publication was
retained, that is, database entries with a PubMed ID. If a gene
was classified as both essential and non-essential by different
sources, we assigned essentiality according to a majority rule
and if no decision was possible, we marked the gene as ambiguous. For E. coli, we used the gene essentiality determined by
Gerdes et al. [6]. We analyzed the essentiality on the level of
reactions, using the gene-reaction associations as defined in
each metabolic model. Reactions can be catalyzed by complexes of multiple enzymes (subunits linked by 'AND' in the
model). Only if all subunits of an enzyme complex were essential did we consider the reaction essential. Conversely, only if
all subunits were non-essential was the reaction considered
non-essential. Otherwise, reactions were discarded. Reactions can also be catalyzed by iso-enzymes (linked by 'OR' in
the model). If the individual iso-enzymes are classified as
non-essential in single knockout experiments, it is still possible that the reaction is essential, because the loss of one isoenzyme can be compensated by the other iso-enzymes. For
this reason, we did not consider reactions with iso-enzymes.
We summarized the combinations of essentiality and nonessentiality of all directionally coupled reactions in a 2 × 2
contingency table and tested for its symmetry by a McNemar
test as implemented in R [21].

Growth defects of gene knockouts
We used the condition-specific growth data of Hillenmeyer et
al. [8] restricted to measurements at generation 5 of
homozygous strains (12 conditions including dropouts of adenine, arginine, isoleucine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, or
tyrosine, as well as YP glycerol, minimal, sorbitol, synthetic
complete media). We used the empirical p-values published
by Hillenmeyer and co-workers [8] to derive binary profiles of
significant (1) and insignificant (0) growth defects. To obtain
unique p-values for every gene and condition, we calculated
the geometric mean over batches, pools and scanners. A
growth defect was considered significant if this average pvalue was < 10-3. The mapping from gene to reaction level was
done in the same way as for the essentiality data (see above).

Gene expression
The expression data were based on 13 studies with 327 conditions for S. cerevisiae and 12 studies with 420 conditions for
E. coli (Additional data file 4). These data were obtained from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [5] at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Presence
(expressed)/absence (not expressed) calls were made using
the BioConductor affy package [22]. For each experimental
condition, the presence/absence calls of individual genes
were translated into 'presence/absence calls' of reactions
based on the gene-reaction associations. Reactions that were
catalyzed by multiple enzymes (iso-enzymes or subunits; see
above) were considered present if at least one of the isoenzymes or all subunits of enzyme complexes were present.
For each reaction pair A→B with a corresponding pair of
expression profiles, we calculated the fraction (f0/1) of conditions in which reaction A is absent while reaction B is present
(n0/1) relative to the total number of conditions in which only
one of the reactions is present (n0/1 + n1/0). We tested the distribution of these fractions against the null-hypothesis that
there is no bias - that is, no asymmetry (H0: f0/1 = 0.5) - with
the two-sided one-sample Wilcoxon test as implemented in R
[21].

Reaction-level phylogenetic profiles and ancestral state
reconstruction
We constructed phylogenetic profiles that denote the presence and absence of enzymes across 373 species according to
the STRING 7.0 orthologous groups [9]. To explore the presence and absence of reactions across species, we mapped the
enzyme orthology information to the reactions-level using the
gene-reaction associations. In situations of iso-enzymes, we
considered the reaction present in a species if at least one isoenzyme was present. If a reaction was catalyzed by an enzyme
that had multiple subunits, it was considered present in a species only if all these subunits were encoded in the genome. For
each reaction pair A→B with a corresponding pair of 'reaction-level' phylogenetic profiles, we calculated the fraction
(f0/1) of genomes in which reaction A is absent while reaction
B is present (n0/1) relative to the total number of genomes in
which exactly one of the reactions is present (n0/1 + n1/0). We
tested the distribution of these fractions against the null-

hypothesis that there is no bias - that is, no asymmetry (H0:
f0/1 = 0.5) - with the two-sided one-sample Wilcoxon test as
implemented in R [21].
We inferred the most parsimonious ancestral presence/
absence states of A and B using a phylogenetic tree of all 373
species included in this analysis (this tree contained some
multifurcations to account for uncertainties [9]) and PAUP
[12]. The tree was manually rooted at the trifurcation of
eukaryotes, Eubacteria and Archaea. All results were based
on a gain/loss cost ratio of 2/1 [23] and a delayed transition
assumption ('DELTRAN'). Importantly, varying the parameters did not affect our conclusions.
We examined for each reaction pair A→B the following situations: type i, both reactions are absent in the ancestor and one
is gained in the descendent; type ii, both reactions are present
in the ancestor and one is lost in the descendent; type iii, the
presence of exactly one of the reactions is maintained, that is,
no change of state occurs. We calculated the fraction (f0/1)
where B was gained (n0/1, type i) and where A was lost (n0/1,
type ii) or maintained (n0/1, type iii) relative to the total
number of instances of that type (that is, n0/1 + n1/0). We
tested the distribution of these fractions (over all AB pairs)
against the null-hypothesis as mentioned above.
To analyze contingent gain of A, we determined for all gain
events of A whether B was already present in the ancestor or
not. The fraction of gains in presence of B (over all AB pairs)
was tested against the null hypothesis that a gain of A is independent of the presence of B (that is, H0: fgain of A in presence
of B = 0.5).

Conserved directionally coupled reaction pairs
We considered a reaction to be conserved between S. cerevisiae and E. coli if it was catalyzed by orthologous enzymes. In
the case of iso-enzymes we required that at least one orthologous enzyme was present in both organisms. For reactions
catalyzed by enzyme complexes, we required that orthologs of
all subunits were present in both organisms. The deviation of
the asymmetry in gene gain, loss and maintenance was tested
as discussed in the section 'Reaction-level phylogenetic profiles and ancestral state reconstruction'.
The absolute number of conserved directionally coupled pairs
is limited (n = 16) because conservation of directional coupling required: both genes of a pair to be present in S. cerevisiae and E. coli; the type of coupling to be conserved; and the
directionality (A→B) to be conserved.
