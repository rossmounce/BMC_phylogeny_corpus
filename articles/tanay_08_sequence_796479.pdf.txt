Abstract
Background: Insertions and deletions (indels) are an important evolutionary force, making the
evolutionary process more efficient and flexible by copying and removing genomic fragments of
various lengths instead of rediscovering them by point mutations. As a mutational process, indels
are known to be more active in specific sequences (like micro-satellites) but not much is known
about the more general and mechanistic effect of sequence context on the insertion and deletion
susceptibility of genomic loci.
Results: Here we analyze a large collection of high confidence short insertions and deletions in
primates and flies, revealing extensive correlations between sequence context and indel rates and
building principled models for predicting these rates from sequence. According to our results, the
rate of insertion or deletion of specific lengths can vary by more than 100-fold, depending on the
surrounding sequence. These mutational biases can strongly influence the composition of the
genome and the rate at which particular sequences appear. We exemplify this by showing how
degenerate loci in human exons are selected to reduce their frame shifting indel propensity.
Conclusion: Insertions and deletions are strongly affected by sequence context. Consequentially,
genomes must adapt to significant variation in the mutational input at indel-prone and indel-immune
loci.

Background

The evolution of genomes is driven by an influx of mutations
that are subject to a stochastic process of neutral fixation and
to multiple selective pressures that can change the neutral fixation dynamics. Good understanding of the evolutionary
process requires characterization of both the mutational and
fixation processes. This is particularly important in applications that try to reveal genomic loci that are evolving under
selection by looking for slowly or rapidly evolving sequences.

In such studies one has to make sure the mutational input at
the genomic regions under study is not abnormally high or
low [1-4], or else the inferred selection may be an artifact of
the mutational dynamics and not a true indication for a functional constraint on the sequence. Changes are introduced
into genomes through point mutations, insertions and deletions. The dynamics of each of these mechanisms may vary
according to genomic context and the presence of various factors acting in trans.

Before the availability of numerous fully sequenced genomes,
evolutionary studies focused on two extremes: replacements
of entire genes and chromosome domains or point mutations.
The former can be detected over long evolutionary times and
their gain or loss has an immediate functional interpretation.
Quantitative molecular evolution has developed around the
occurrence of point mutations over limited regions of the
genome, where it is feasible to compare intra-species variation with inter-species change, and infer fitness. Intermediate
in scale are small (1-50 bp) insertions or deletions (indels).
They are less numerous than single base substitutions, but
can account for comparable base-pairs of change. For example, 3.2% of the base-pair changes between the fly species and
0.8% of the base-pair changes in the primate species analyzed
here are affected by indels, compared with 1.8% and 1.5%
affected by point mutations in flies and primates, respectively. Short indels are, therefore, a significant factor in the
mutational input that feeds into the evolutionary process, a
fact that underlines the importance of characterizing the
mechanisms that induce or suppress their activity. Earlier
work focused on human insertions and deletions at disease
loci [5-8] or on indels detected between relatively distant species [9,10] suggested that such events are correlated with specific sequence contexts. More recent works [11,12]
characterized extensive collections of indels in the humanchimp lineages, further motivating a comprehensive
approach to the description of their sequence contexts.
In this work, we construct an evolutionary model for small
indels in flies and primate genomes. We characterize these
processes using mechanistic insights (tandem duplication for
insertion, replication slippage for deletion). We discover significant sequence contexts that are susceptible to deletion or
insertion. Using the new data, we are able to predict the rate
of insertions and deletions at each genomic loci given the
sequence surrounding it. We show the indel rate at different
loci can vary within more than two orders of magnitude, making specific loci susceptible to rapid insertion or deletion and
other loci immune to it. Our results suggest that indels are
introduced into the genome by a random process, but that the
rate of this random process is highly dependent and, to a great
extent, predictable from the sequence. We demonstrate the
significance of this indel rate variability by showing how synonymous codons in human exons are selected for low frame
shifting indel potential.

panzee with Rhesus macaque as the outgroup. Human indels
inferred from these three species have recently been studied
by Messer and Arndt [12] and using a non-primate outgroup
by Chen et al. [11]. For flies, we compared the Drosophila species D. simulans with D. sechelia, using D. melanogaster as
the outgroup, refining an earlier study [10] that compared D.
melanogastar with D. yakuba using D. pseudoobscura as the
outgroup.
Our aim is to model the indel rates from the sequence context.
We therefore developed a filtering and weighting scheme in
an attempt to extract a maximal amount of insertion and
deletion loci for which the sequence context is unambiguous.
One class of potentially ambiguous indels consists of loci that
were affected by multiple insertion or deletion events. Multiple events may result in inconsistent gap boundaries among
the aligned species. Interestingly, although the global rate of
indels in the phylogenies we have analyzed was less than 1
event per100 bp, 33% of the gaps in the primate alignments
(35% in the flyalignments) had inconsistent boundaries. To
avoid ambiguities in sequence context, we filtered out such
gaps from further analysis and, for similar reasons, we also
filtered gaps that had another gap within 20 bp of the insertion or deletion point. To account for gaps with ambiguous
positions, we determined all possible equally probable alignments of each gap and treated them uniformly (see Materials
and methods). Statistics on gaps and inferred insertions and
deletions are provided in Figure 1a.
We further controlled for possible alignment problems in primates by performing direct searches for putative human and
chimp inserts and their flanking 60 bp in the chimp and
human genomes, respectively (see Materials and methods).
We performed similar searches for the sequences flanking
putative deletion points. All putative insertion or deletion
sequences (including the flanking regions) that were aligned
to the other genome without gaps were defined as questionable and removed from further analysis (Figure 1b). Comparison of two multiple alignment sets (based on the panTro1 and
panTro2 assemblies) revealed that many of the questionable
indels are inconsistent between versions of the alignment
(data not shown). On the other hand, analysis of sequence
quality data in the chimp assembly did not support a connection between dubious indels and low sequence quality.

Distribution of inserted and deleted sequence lengths

Results
A comprehensive compendium of short insertion/
deletion events in primates and flies
Close, fully sequenced species grouped around one species
with high quality annotation permit good single indel event
statistics to be inferred. Three species are necessary, the two
closest 'ingroups' are compared, while the third 'outgroup'
defines the ancestor and thus distinguishes insertions from
deletions. For the primates we compared human and chim-

It is widely assumed (for example, by alignment algorithms)
that gap lengths are distributed as geometric variables, but as
shown in Figure 1c the length distributions of the events in
our set are not geometric, and vary between insertions and
deletions. In the primate lineages, the length distributions for
both insertions and deletions may reflect two geometric
regimes, making short and long events more probable than
expected given a simple, single parameter geometric distribution. The shift between the two regimes occurs at length 8-10
bp for deletions and at length 10-12 for insertions. For flies,

and in the primate deletion data (the probability of a single exponential fit has P < 10-150 (KS goodness of fit)). The peaks at, for example, primate insertions
of length 4 and 8 are not understood but statistically significant. The fluctuation around the trend for longer events reflects lower sample sizes.

the deletion lengths are distributed as a simple geometric distribution. The insertions in flies are also distributed with two
geometric regimes, one for short events (2-10 bp) and the
other for longer ones (10 bp and more). The observed length
distributions can indicate that multiple mechanisms are contributing to the insertion or deletion processes. Interestingly,
the length distributions of questionable events are markedly
different than those of the retained events, supporting our filtering scheme (Figure S1 in Additional data file 1). We were
unable to detect specific families of sequences that significantly affect the length distribution in any of the tested lineages. Previous studies that argued for geometric gap length
distributions [13-15] were based on smaller numbers of
events than present in our set, and were, therefore, limited
with respect to inference of the distribution of low frequency
(that is, long) events (which are those that seem to break the
simple geometric regime).

Most short insertions are accounted for by simple and
complex tandem duplications, sometimes involving the
reverse strand
Short insertion events were shown before to be mechanistically possible through micro-tandem duplication (illustrated
in Figure 2a) [16]. We found that the majority, but not all, of
the insertions in our compendium have a tandem match (or
'template'), suggesting that simple tandem duplication is the
major mechanism for short insertions and confirming earlier
results [5,6,12]. To further characterize insertions that lack a
good tandem match, we studied the matching between subsets of the inserted sequences and their surrounding
sequences, carefully controlling for spurious regional
sequence matches, hypothesizing that several copying events
might explain these insertions (Figure 2b; see Materials and
methods), as previously suggested for indels associated with
human disease loci [8]. We also tested the matching between
inserted sequences and the proximal sequence of the reverse
strand, following observations of inserts with perfect reverse
strand templates (Figure 2c; see Materials and methods).
Using data on all the insertions in both our compendia (Figure 2d), we could attribute about 80-90% of the insertions to
a simple or complex tandem duplication event. Complex
events become more prominent for longer insertions. We
observed a considerable number of primate events with a
template on the reverse strand. A number of cases in bacteria
have been documented where DNA polymerase can transiently switch strands at the replication fork [17,18], although
these did not involve more than a single base indel. We further analyzed the distances between the reverse complement
insert and the presumed original sequence (Figure 2e). There
is a pronounced peak of reverse templates located about 10 bp
from the insertion point, confirming the non-randomness of
the reverse strand templates and suggestive of helical
phasing.
The remaining putative insertions lack apparent sequence
templates in their immediate neighborhood. To see if

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R37

Tanay and Siggia R37.4

sequence templates for such insertions can be found in more
remote chromosomal regions, we examined insertion events
of length above 30 bp (for which genome-wide searches are
specific) that lacked a tandem template. We detected only few
cases where a possible insert template was located out of the
immediate locus neighborhood. In no case did we find a possible insert template in a different chromosome. We next
computed the average chimp assembly (panTro2) quality
around putative insertion events with and without a tandem
template. We could not detect a significant difference in the
sequence quality around the two groups (Figure S2 in Additional data file 1). In flies we found that the many non-tandem
long inserts were present (though mutated) in D. yakuba.
This suggests another instance of incomplete lineage sorting
[19], where structurally polymorphic loci persist throughout
the speciation of the Drosophila species we analyzed. Other
effects (for example, alignment artifacts) may also be contributing to the increase in non-tandem fly insertion fraction as a
function of the insert length. To summarize, for our compendium, the dominant mechanism for insertions is tandem
duplication, perhaps in several steps, and in a minority of
cases the copy is from the complementary strand. A fraction
of the gaps still cannot be rationalized using this model, and
although there is some indirect evidence that suggest many of
these are in fact alignment errors, other explanations are still
possible.

Sequence preferences of short insertion events
While tandem duplications explain the majority of short
insertions in all lineages we considered, we wished to explore
possible contribution of specific sequence contexts to the initiation of the duplication process. It is known, for example,
that even imperfect stems can stabilize sequence intermediates that enhance rearrangements [20]. We wished to generalize and quantify this phenomenon using our compendium
of short insertion events. We first built a profile model for
each insertion length by computing the nucleotide frequencies around insertion points. Working with large genomes
(and many insertion events), the profiles were very robust
statistically. Moreover, depending on the event length, the
profiles proved informative, indicating many specific nucleotide preferences that deviate from the expected background
pattern. To control for the non-uniform distribution of nucleotides in genomes (and the human genome in particular), we
next recomputed the profiles for groups of insertion events
that are present in regions with predefined G+C content, and
used the background nucleotide distribution in such regions
to compute a log odds score for each profile entry (see Materials and methods; Figure 3). The results reflect several universal preferences and other preferences that are particular to
specific insertion lengths. Overall, insertion points are
flanked by low GC content (when compared to the regional
GC content), with more A than T nucleotides towards the 5'
end and more T than A nucleotides towards the 3' end. It is
possible that such contexts make the replication process more
vulnerable to slippage and reconnection, or affect the capacity

Sequence preferences around human insertions
Sequence preferences around human insertions. Shown are profiles of log odds (base 2) for the nucleotide composition around human insertions of
lengths 1-4. The 0.95 confidence intervals are plotted for each frequency. For each offset relative to the insertion point, we computed the frequency of
each nucleotide and compared it to the frequency in genomic regions with similar GC content. The graphs indicate strong preferences for specific
nucleotides in the context of an insertion, suggesting these nucleotides are contributing to the insertion process. The shaded region represents the
nucleotide profile of the inserted sequence itself. Profiles around chimp insertions are highly similar to those shown here (Figure S3 in Additional data file
1). The number of events in flies is too small to reliably define these profiles.

of the sequence to form short loops [17,20]. As we shall see
below, we can use the identified sequence preferences to predict the rate of insertions at each genomic locus, although
their mechanistic role awaits further characterization.

Short deletions are marked by short matches at the
deletion junction
Figure 4a illustrates a possible mechanism for deletion of
short sequences during replication. Sequences are lost after
slippage of the replication machinery at one locus, followed
by re-association with the DNA at a different locus, leaving
the sequence between the two loci unreplicated. It is likely
that some similarity between the sequences of the slippage
and re-association loci would contribute to the deletion process [6,7]. To quantify this effect, we computed the percent
identity between deleted sequences and their immediately
flanking sequences, and compared it to the percent identity of
inserted sequences and their tandem sequences (see
Materials and methods). We used the flanking sequence on
the side that had better overall percent identity. As expected,
we derived contrasting results for deletions and insertions
(Figure 4b). The percent identity for insertions is high and
stable along the entire inserted sequence, agreeing with the
statistics on tandem duplications discussed above. For deletions, we observed high similarity for the first few base-pairs
at the deletion junction, but then rapid decrease in similarity
to the expected background levels. Similar results are
observed for flies and primates. These results support the
mechanism outlined above and confirm that replication slippage can be induced by matching of few base-pairs around the
junction. To further quantify this effect, we compared the
number of deletion events of length l and deletion junction
matching of length s to the overall number of genomic loci
with s matching base-pairs spaced by l nucleotides. The ratio
between these numbers reflects the probability of deletion
given a deletion junction match of length s. As shown in Figure 4c, the probability of deletion increases by a factor of 100
between loci without any match at the deletion junction to
loci that have at least 5 bp matching. We observed no correlation between the size of deletion and the quality of the match
at the deletion junction.

Additional sequence preferences for short deletions
As is the case for insertions, deletions can be shown to have
specific sequence context preferences beyond the matching of
2-3 bp at their junction. This is demonstrated by the log odds
for nucleotide preferences at different GC content regions and
different deletion lengths (Figure 5; computed as for insertions, see Materials and methods). First, as observed for
insertions, we detect an A-T asymmetry around the deleted
sequences (more As to the 5' end, more Ts to the 3' end).
Unlike insertions, we also observed marked differences
between Gs and Cs, where Cs are preferred just before the
deletion junction and Gs after it. Many other details can be
extracted from the nucleotide preference graphs, and these

will be used below to construct a probabilistic model for predicting indel propensity.
We next wished to test if higher level interactions between
nucleotides are significantly associated with deletion or insertions events. We searched for such interactions systematically
(see Materials and methods), identifying all pairs of positions
relative to the deletion/insertion sequence in which the joint
distribution of nucleotide pairs differ significantly from the
genomic distribution of nucleotide pairs at the same distance.
The strongest pairs other than the tandem effects we discussed above (compare Figure 4b; correlation between nucleotides spaces by the length of the deletion) indicated
interaction between Cs and Gs in the positions adjacent to
deletions of even lengths (Figure 5b). It is possible that some
sort of G-C pairing at these positions contributes to the generation and stabilization of non-B-DNA structures and, therefore, enhances deletion propensity [20]. In bacteria,
palindromic sequence favors deletions since it stabilizes the
fold-back configuration by internal base pairing [17].

The indel propensity model
The sequence contexts we described above were next used to
construct a probabilistic model for predicting the insertion
and deletion potential at a genomic locus given its sequence
context. The indel propensity models (one for each length,
lineage and event type) are designed to predict the insertion
(deletion) probability at a given genomic locus and phylogenetic branch (Figure 6a). The prediction is based on the
sequence surrounding the locus as present in the genome
prior to the putative insertion or deletion. The key features of
the models are the frequencies of nucleotides at each position
relative to the putative indel locus (Figures 3 and 5) and the
conditional probability of nucleotides given their previous
(5') nucleotide. For deletions, we also used the joint distribution of nucleotides that are spaced l nucleotides from each
other (these are not used for insertions since we are applying
the model to the sequence present prior to the insertion). To
compute the insertion or deletion propensity for length l, we
compared the likelihood of the above model to the likelihood
of a similar model that was trained using the genomic background, generating a log odds score that is used for downstream analysis.

Over 100-fold change in insertion/deletion probability
given preferred sequence contexts
To test the predictive power of the models described above
and to ensure the context model does not introduce overfitting, we performed standard cross validation. We divided the
human genome into two (odd and even numbered chromosomes). We trained our models using the data from only oddnumbered chromosomes. We then computed the distribution
of model scores for each type of event (length, lineage, type)
for the background genomic sequence and around indel
events occurring at even-numbered chromosomes (Figure
6b). Working with the highly similar primate genomes, we

Short matches define the limits of a deletion
Short matches define the limits of a deletion. (a) Deletion via replication slippage. Illustrated is a process by which a replication fork slips from the
sequence and reconnects at a different locus, thereby deleting the short sequence shown. The stability of a slippage event is controlled by the length of
matching sequence (red) at the deletion junction (arrow) (b) Similarity between deleted/inserted sequence and its flanking nucleotides. We computed the
similarity between deleted (first row) and inserted (second row) nucleotides and the nucleotides flanking them (comparing each position to the position l
nucleotides away, where l is the indel length). We used the flanking sequence in the side with better overall percent identity and averaged the statistics
over all optimal alignments to control for alignment algorithm artifacts (see Materials and methods). For insertions we observe high similarity that is
unaffected by the distance from the junction, while for deletions the similarity is rapidly decreasing as a function of the distance. D. Sec, D. sechelia; D. Sim,

by a factor of 100-fold with s, but retains the same slope, regardless of the deletion length l. Combined human and chimp data are shown.

Sequence preferences around human deletions
Sequence preferences around human deletions. (a) Nucleotide profiles. Shown are profiles of log odds for the nucleotide composition around human
deletions of lengths 1-4 (Figure 3; see Materials and methods). The 0.95 confidence intervals are plotted for each frequency. For each offset relative to the
deletion point, we computed the frequency of each nucleotide and compared it to the frequency in genomic regions with similar GC content. Shaded
regions represent the nucleotide preferences of the deleted sequence itself. The analogous chimp profiles are shown in Figure S4 in Additional data file 1.
(b) Higher order nucleotide correlation. Shown are schematic illustrations of the two strongest statistical associations between pairs of nucleotides
flanking insertions or deletions of a specific length. Both cases represent co-occurrence of G-C pairs flanking a deletion of even size (red nucleotides
represent the deleted fragment). It is possible that base pairing between these two positions contributes to specific deletion scenarios.

Predicting insertion and deletion rates using the indel propensity probabilistic score
Predicting insertion and deletion rates using the indel propensity probabilistic score. (a) The model. We trained a positional Markov model that computes
the probability of a nucleotide at each position relative to the insertion/deletion point given its position, the previous nucleotide, and possibly the
nucleotide l bp upstream of it (l being the event length). Model parameterization was done separately for each length, event type (insertion/deletion) and
GC content region. We can score a locus for indel propensity by dividing the probability from the model by that of a similar model estimated from
background sequences. (b) Predicting indel rates. The graphs summarize the results of a cross validation assay consisting of training indel propensity
models on half of the aligned human chromosomes and applying them to predict insertions and deletions of various lengths in the other half of the genome.
For each type of event, we show the relative increase in indel probability in the human lineage as a function of the propensity score. In all cases, the model
is robustly predicting an increase of 100-1,000-fold in the indel rate for high versus low scoring loci. Similar results for chimp events are shown in Figure S5
in Additional data file 1.

Human exons are optimized for low indel propensity
Human exons are optimized for low indel propensity. The fraction of positions with indel propensity score above 1 (indel-susceptible loci) was computed
across all exons in the human genome. The graphs show the ratio between these fractions and the fraction of such loci in exons that were randomized by
shuffling (preserving GC content) synonymous codons. We see a clear preference of synonymous codons for low indel propensity, except for indels of
size 3, which do not cause frame shifts.

assumed the ancestral sequence is identical to the human
genome (that is, we ignored point mutations), with the exception that inserted sequence has to be removed, and deleted
sequence has to be retained. Cross validation confirmed the
robustness of the indel propensity score, showing increasing
indel probability for higher log odds values. The results
indicate that the relative rate of insertions and deletions of all
tested lengths vary by as much as a factor of 100 as a function
of the model score. Loci with very high indel propensity have
a very high probability for insertion or deletion (of a specific
length) and behave much like micro-satellites. Loci with very
low indel propensity may be almost indel free. Between these
two extremes we observe a whole array of weaker phenomena, consisting of diverse sequence contexts with variable
indel propensity.

Indel constraints in coding regions
To further validate our conclusions on the importance of
sequence contexts to the indel process, and to illustrate their
possible functional and evolutionary significance, we analyzed the indel potential of human exons. Exons are typically
under purifying selection through the proteins they encode.
Degenerate codon positions are also under some secondary,
multifaceted selection (for example, [21,22]) which results in
the codon bias phenomenon. As demonstrated before [11],
insertion and deletions in exons are likely to have particularly
deleterious effects, especially when introducing a frame shift
(that is when their length is not a multiple of three). We therefore hypothesized that genomes will use some of the flexibility
inherent in degenerate codons to lower the indel potential of
exons. To test if this is indeed the case, we compared human

exons to randomized exons obtained by shuffling nucleotides
in synonymous positions while maintaining the resulting
amino acid sequence and regional GC content. For each insertion and deletion length, we computed the distribution of
model scores in the two sets, adding up data from all loci in all
human exons. As shown in Figure 7, the results reflect a
significantly smaller number of coding loci with high indel
propensity than what should have been expected from
random selection of codons. Interestingly, this trend is highly
significant (P < 10-150) for all event lengths except for 3 bp,
showing that degenerate codon positions evolved to reduce
the indel propensity of frame shifting indels more than frame
conserving mutations. The low rate of frame shifting indels
that was demonstrated before is, therefore, partially enabled
by fine tuned sequence contexts, suggesting that genomes
may use their sequence itself to adapt their mutability in specific functional regions.

Discussion

The existence of a dense web of fully sequenced metazoan
genomes around those of human and fly permits a thorough
study of short indel events. Although their rate is below that
of base substitution events, they account for a comparable
number of base-pairs of sequence change and, thus, are
potentially at least as important for evolving new functionality as are single base changes. The indel rate is also very context dependent, as is most immediately evident from our
finding that half of the indels present between our ingroup
species did not map exactly onto the outgroup. We believe
this reflects a large number of multiple events that have

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R37

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/2/R37

Genome Biology 2008,

occurred even though the primary events are rare (occurring
on < 0.5% of the genome) for the genomes we compare.
New inserted sequence can usually be rationalized as a copy
of adjacent sequence, but the copying process is sometimes
complex or involves the complementary strand in primates.
We found no systematic evidence for copying from far away
(for example, 10 kb) in the size range of 50 bp or less. In the
fly a possible explanation for many of the putative insertions
that were not copied is incomplete lineage assortment, but
this was not observed in primates. We note that there is a
tradeoff to be made when choosing the outgroup: one too
removed allows for multiple events and overlaid point mutations, and one too close and the phylogeny of the locus may
not conform to that of the species, as is the case for some of
the fly loci.
Deletions have fewer sequence constraints, namely only the
propensity for the match of a few base-pairs flanking the
junction (Figure 4). The relative rates of insertions to
deletions differs between flies and primates for lengths over
10 bp, perhaps because most of the fly sequence is under some
functional constraint [10,23], whereas the primate genomes
are much less constrained. The length spectra of both
insertions and deletions have two power law regimes, which
prima facie contradicts the scoring assumption of standard
alignment algorithms.
One of the emerging themes from recent analyses of divergence in closely related genomes is that the mutational
process is highly dependent on sequence context. Adjacent
nucleotides are known to affect point mutation rates [24] but
understanding of more complex sequence context and their
possible roles in changing the mutational input and/or selective pressure are only now beginning to emerge (for example,
as in the case of CpG dinucleotides [25,26]. We have shown
that a model using only the distribution of nucleotides suitably defined with respect to the indel predicts over 100-fold
variation in the rates of the appropriate indel event. Interestingly, the sequence context of insertions and deletions of different lengths share only some of their features (for example,
AT asymmetry) and differ in others (G-C coupling in deletions of even length), suggesting specific interaction with the
replication machinery.
For molecular evolution, our indel propensity model can be
used as a refined neutral standard in applications that search
for categories of sequence that are evolving slowly due to
putative selection. In particular, we have demonstrated how
coding regions bias their codon usage to suppress frame
shifting mutations. Indels may contribute more to the evolution of regulatory sequences than their frequency would suggest, because their size is comparable to a protein binding
site. It would be interesting to see whether our model can
explain some of the drift in binding sites that have been
mapped on a genome scale [27-29].

Materials and methods
Alignments, indel detection and filtering
Primate sequences were downloaded from the remarkably
useful UCSC genome browser site [30], using the hg18,
panTro2 and rheMac2 assemblies. Multiple alignments were
generated by extracting the primate sequences from the vertebrate maf files (28 vertebrate species, 2007 version) and
concatenating contiguous fragments. To annotate known
repeat sequences, we used the RepeatMasker data from the
UCSC genome browser site.
We used release 4.3 of the D. melanogaster genome from
[31]. The D. simulans sequence was the 'mosaic' assembly
from [32], which was generated using their genome assembler to combine the sequences from six D. simulans strains
(this assembly is also used on the UCSC browser). The D.
sechellia sequence is a contig library from the same source.
Three way alignments were done with the TBA codes from
[33], and the parameters T = 1, C = 2, and L = 10,000 were
modified from their defaults.
We observed for both our fly ingroup species that our alignments predicted that about 6% of all exons had a 1 bp indel
when compared with the D. melanogaster annotation. This is
an unreasonably high rate of frame shifts, so we downloaded
the alignments of the individual D. simulans strains against
D. melanlogaster from [34]. The six strains together with D.
melanogaster where then multi-aligned using TBA and a new
consensus was derived using the majority pattern among the
D. simulans strains if one existed; otherwise, the strain
matching D. melanogaster if one existed; otherwise, an array
of 'N's.
With the new consensus the number of length 1 indels in
exons fell to 0.4%, with the majority of these in regions of low
coverage or homopolymer repeats. However, we continued to
use the 'mosaic' alignment since it was no worse than the D.
sechellia data, which we had no means to correct, and also the
errors for indels larger than length 1 were tolerable (12% of
length 2 indels and 0.5% of length 4 and larger could be spurious, estimated from the number of frame shifting indels
observed (and assuming all of these are spurious) and
multiplying by the fraction of coding sequence in the genome
and the total number of indels we found).
To construct a reliable compendium of short insertions and
deletions, we identified all gaps in the multiple alignments
that had clearly defined boundaries in all three species (the
outgroup aligned exactly with one of the ingroups) and were
flanked by at least 20 bps of gapless matches. We annotated
each gap as an insertion or deletion based on the known triplet phylogeny of primates and flies. We ignored cases that
occurred in the outgroup lineage (and therefore could not be
resolved as insertion or deletions). To control for arbitrary
gap positions in the multiple alignments, we computed for
each gap the set of all possible optimally scoring gap positions

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R37

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/2/R37

Genome Biology 2008,

by sliding the gap in both the 5' and 3' directions, and computing the number of resulting mismatches at each position. All
gap positions with the minimal number of mismatches were
considered as candidates, and were assigned with a weight of
1/(Number of optimal gap positions). We used the weights
when computing statistics for the insertion/deletion ensembles, unless otherwise noted. To prevent a bias from large
families of short repeats, we filtered out all gaps that were
within 40 bp of an annotated repeat in all the analyses
reported, except for the data in Figure 1a. Including the
repeats in the analysis did not affect the results significantly,
nor did imposing a minimal percent identity on the ungapped
flanking sequence.
To minimize alignment errors for the primate data, we further filtered events using direct genomic searches. For each
insertion event we used the sequence of the insert flanked by
60 bp on each side. For deletions we used the flanking 60 bp
around the deletion point. We then used J Kent's blat program (with standard parameters, see UCSC website [30]) to
search for these sequences in the orthologous chromosome
(searching the chimp genome for human indels and the
human genome for chimp indels). We defined an event as
questionable whenever blat returned a hit that spanned the
insertion or deletion junction with 20 bp of flanking gapless
match. The size distributions of retained and questionable
events are shown in Figure S1 in Additional data file 1.
To characterize the sequence quality around different classes
of indels, we used data from the chimp panTro2 assembly,
extracted through the UCSC database. To generate supplementary Figure 2, we computed for each human insertion the
minimal sequence quality (scaled from 0 to 97) in the aligned
chimp sequence that surrounded the putative insertion point
(20 bp for each side). Note that we did not use the sequence
quality in the filtering process.

cases is 1%. We applied the same technique to classify insertions as matching the reverse strand.

Detecting nucleotide and nucleotide pair preferences
To compute the sequence context preferences of insertion
and deletions, we grouped similar events by their type
(length, insertion/deletion, and lineage). We also computed
the GC content in a window of 400 bp around the event and
grouped together events with similar GC content (using bins
of 10%). We constructed the nucleotide profile for each event
group by simple counting, and transformed the frequency at
each position to log odds by comparing it to the background
probability in sequences with similar GC content. To detect
statistically significant correlations between pairs of positions
relative to the insertion or deletion junction, we constructed
the joint distributions of nucleotides for each pair of positions
in the range -20 to +20 bp relative to insertions or deletions
of a given type. We also computed the background joint distribution of nucleotide pairs at each distance. We used chisquare statistics to test if the two contingency tables differ,
and a hyper-geometric test to check if particular pairs of
nucleotides are correlated in a positive or negative way.

The indel propensity model
To model the sequence around indels of specific type (length,
lineage, insertion/deletion), we constructed a positional
Markov model that determines the probability of observing a
nucleotide X at position i relative to the indel point by looking
up a conditional probability table that is parameterized by the
position itself and by the nucleotide at position 'i - 1' (for
inserts) and by both the nucleotides at positions 'i - 1' at 'i - l'
for deletions (l being the length of the event). The probability
tables were inferred directly from the sequences in our compendium. To score a genomic locus for a certain event type,
we computed the model likelihood and compared it to the
likelihood of a background model that was constructed similarly, but trained using background sequences.

Looking for sources of inserted sequences
To identify possible sequence templates for short inserts, we
applied several layers of analysis. First, we directly tested the
number of mismatches between the insert and its immediately flanking sequence (on both sides). In cases where more
than one alignment configuration was possible for the gap, we
tested all possible configurations. Inserts that had at most one
mismatch for the sequence in either side were considered as
perfect tandems (this was feasible for indels of length more
than 5). At the second level, we searched for the longest
perfect match between a substring of the insert and all
sequence within 'l + 10' nucleotides on either side of the insert
(of length l). We compared this number to the longest match
in the 1.1 kb upstream and downstream of the insert (excluding the 100 bp immediately flanking it on each side). All cases
where the longest match near the sequence was longer than
that in the larger surroundings were assumed to be complex
tandem duplications, as the expected random fraction of such

Exon analysis
To test possible preferences of human exon against high indel
propensity, we generated a set of randomized exons by shuffling synonymous codons while preserving GC content. This
was done by first determining for each codon its regional GC
content and then selecting a synonymous codon at random
such that the expected overall GC content distribution at the
synonymous sites before and after the randomization is similar. We then computed the fraction of exon loci with indel
propensity score larger than 1, in both the real and
randomized sets, and determined the significance of the
detected differences using binomial statistics.
