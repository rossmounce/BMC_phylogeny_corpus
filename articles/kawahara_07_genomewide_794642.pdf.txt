Abstract
Background: Changes in protein evolutionary rates among lineages have been frequently
observed during periods of notable phenotypic evolution. It is also known that, following gene
duplication and loss, the protein evolutionary rates of genes involved in such events changed
because of changes in functional constraints acting on the genes. However, in the evolution of
closely related species, excluding the aforementioned situations, the frequency of changes in
protein evolutionary rates is still not clear at the genome-wide level. Here we examine the
constancy of protein evolutionary rates in the evolution of four closely related species of the
Saccharomyces sensu stricto group (S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus).
Results: For 2,610 unambiguously defined orthologous genes among the four species, we carried
out likelihood ratio tests between constant-rate and variable-rate models and found 344 (13.2%)
genes showing significant changes in the protein evolutionary rates in at least one lineage. Of all
those genes which experienced rate changes, 139 and 49 genes showed accelerated and
decelerated evolution, respectively. Most of the evolutionary rate changes could be attributed to
changes in selective constraints acting on nonsynonymous sites, independently of species-specific
gene duplication and loss. We estimated that the changes in protein evolutionary rates have
appeared with a probability of 2.0 × 10-3 per gene per million years in the evolution of the
Saccharomyces species. Furthermore, we found that the genes which experienced rate acceleration
have lower expression levels and weaker codon usage bias than those which experienced rate
deceleration.
Conclusion: Changes in protein evolutionary rates possibly occur frequently in the evolution of
closely related Saccharomyces species. Selection for translational accuracy and efficiency may
dominantly affect the variability of protein evolutionary rates.

Background
The molecular clock hypothesis asserts that the number of
amino acid differences in a protein appear to be roughly
proportional to the divergence time of the two organisms
compared [1,2]. Furthermore, Motoo Kimura claimed
that the rate of protein evolution for each protein is
approximately constant for various lineages, as long as the
function and tertiary structure of the molecule remain
essentially unaltered [3]. However, the accuracy of the
molecular clock has been controversial for several decades
[4,5].
To date, accelerated evolution of some genes in specific
lineages has been reported. In particular, changes in the
protein evolutionary rates accompanying remarkable phenotypic evolution have been well studied. For example,
relative to the lineage leading to rodents, accelerated evolution of the genes involved in the development and physiology of the nervous system was observed in the lineage
leading to humans [6]. It was suggested that these genes
might have played important roles in the unique evolution of the complex human brain. However, interestingly,
some genes involved in the nervous system also showed
higher rates of protein evolution in the domesticated dog
lineage than in the human lineage, suggesting that the relatively higher rate of evolution in the lineage leading to
humans may reflect decelerated evolution in the rodent
lineage, or possibly independent adaptive evolution in
the human and dog lineages. Thus, it is necessary to be
cautious in regarding the accelerated evolution of human
nervous system-related genes as representing human-specific innovations [7]. Moreover, using the relative rate test,
it has been reported that approximately 0.76% of the proteins seem to have experienced accelerated evolution
when comparing across human, mouse and rat [8]. As for
other eukaryotic organisms, genome-wide acceleration of
protein evolution, which might be caused by physiological and ecological factors that affect the mutation rate, was
observed in the diptera lineages when compared with the
beetle lineages [9]. According to these studies, in the evolution of morphologically and evolutionarily distant species, the rate of protein evolution seems to change
frequently due to adaptive evolution, and changes in
mutation rates and selective constraints. Another known
cause of changes in protein evolutionary rates is the relaxation of functional constraints acting on duplicate genes
following duplication events [10]. In fact, recently duplicated genes evolve faster than unduplicated genes having
the same level of divergence and similar functions in 39
genomes from eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes [11].
Using amino-acid based method, Zhang et al. [12] found
that nearly 60% of duplicated pairs have evolved in an
asymmetric divergent manner in the human genome.
Analysis of four complete genome sequences (two yeasts,
fruit fly and nematode) suggested that 20–30% of dupli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/9

cate gene pairs show asymmetric evolution that might
have been caused by relaxed functional constraints on one
of the duplicates [13]. Furthermore, other large-scale studies have shown that duplicate gene sequences often
diverge asymmetrically [14,15].
According to the molecular clock hypothesis and aforementioned studies, if the mutation rate and selective constraints on a protein remain constant over time, the rate of
protein evolution should also remain constant. However,
it is not known whether the protein evolutionary rate is
indeed constant in the ordinary state (neither immediately after gene duplication and loss nor during remarkable phenotypic evolution) of the evolution of biologically
similar and closely-related species.
Comparative analysis of multiple closely related genomes
allows us to accurately trace evolutionary changes at the
genome-wide level. Moreover, based on the maximumparsimony principle and using three or more species for
which the phylogenetic relationship is evident, we can
estimate the occurrences and the precise directions of evolutionary changes (such as rate acceleration or deceleration) on each lineage. Such an analysis will be feasible for
many closely-related species since the genome sequencing
projects are complete or in progress for some eukaryotic
organisms, such as primates, fruit flies and yeasts [16].
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, baker's yeast, is the best-studied
eukaryote in terms of molecular cell biology, genetics and
genomics. The whole genome sequence of S. cerevisiae, the
first complete eukaryotic genome sequence, was published in 1996 [17]. The genome sequences of close relatives of S. cerevisiae were determined, and more
sequencing efforts are still ongoing [16,18,19]. In particular, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus were frequently
used for comparative studies. These species are biologically and morphologically similar to S. cerevisiae, and can
grow under the same conditions. To date, many researchers have compiled a large amount of biological information for S. cerevisiae, such as expression data for each gene
[20,21]. Therefore, the use of S. cerevisiae as the subject of
an evolutionary study would be beneficial for examining
the relationships between estimated evolutionary events
and other biological features.
In this study, to test the constancy of the protein evolutionary rate in the evolution of closely related species, we
examined changes in protein evolutionary rates among
the lineages of four species of Saccharomyces sensu stricto
group: S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus.
To reveal the biological features of the genes experiencing
changes in rate of protein evolution, we compared some
evolutionary and functional data, such as molecular function, gene length, expression level and codon usage bias,

across four groups of genes: (i) genes evolving at a constant rate (constant-rate genes); (ii) genes experiencing
evolutionary rate changes (either acceleration or deceleration: variable-rate genes); (iii) genes experiencing acceleration (rate-accelerated genes); and (iv) genes experiencing
deceleration (rate-decelerated genes).

Results & discussion
Estimation of the number of genes with changes in protein
evolutionary rates
We constructed 2,610 unambiguous 1:1:1:1 orthologous
genes among four closely related sensu stricto Saccharomyces species (S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus) by using synteny-based orthology information and
data cleaning processes (see Methods). Figure 1 shows the
phylogenetic tree which was constructed by the neighborjoining (NJ) method [22] based on the concatenated
nucleotide open reading frame (ORF) sequences of 2,610
orthologous genes (3,776,106 sites), which was consistent with the consensus phylogeny [23]. The genetic distances between species were based on the numbers of
nucleotide substitutions estimated by Kimura's twoparameter method [24]. In further analysis, we used this
tree topology as the standard phylogenetic relationship
among four species of Saccharomyces sensu stricto group.

For each of the 2,610 orthologous genes, the number of
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and
the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN) in the five lineages shown in Figure 1
was estimated by the maximum-likelihood method
implemented in the PAML CODEML program [25]. In
Table 1, medians, means and standard errors of dS and dN
values for each lineage are shown. Both dS and dN values
in the lineage B are significantly lower than those in the
lineage A (Wilcoxon rank sum test; P < 2.2 × 10-16). This
trend could be also observed as a shorter branch length of
the lineage B when compared with the lineage A in Figure
1. The lower rates of substitutions in the lineage leading to
S. paradoxus would reflect a lower mutation rate in this lineage [19]. This species-specific lower mutation rate would
not cause any change in the dN/dS ratio across the lineages, because changes in mutation rates should affect both
dS and dN in the same way.
To examine the constancy of protein evolutionary rates in
the four Saccharomyces species, we performed a series of
likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) between constant-rate and
variable-rate models for each orthologous gene (see Methods). The results of the LRTs showed that the dN/dS ratios
of 344 (13.2%) genes have changed significantly, in at
least one lineage, during the evolution of the four species
of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group (P < 0.05, after
correction of multiple tests by Bonferroni-correction). As
shown in Figure 2, based on the maximum-parsimony

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/9

principle, we found that the rates of protein evolution of
7, 52, 22, 24 and 34 genes were accelerated in the lineages
A, B, A-B, A-B-C and D, respectively. Similarly, the protein
evolutionary rates of 16, 1, 10, 8 and 14 genes were decelerated for the corresponding lineages. The dN/dS ratios of
19 and 118 genes have been changed in the lineages C and
E, respectively. Because these rate changes could not be
explained by one rate-change event (either rate-acceleration or rate-deceleration event) and there is no outgroup
lineage, we could not easily distinguish rate acceleration
from rate deceleration. In addition, the rates of protein
evolution of 19 genes differ from lineage to lineage. Overall, the protein evolutionary rates of at least 139 genes
were accelerated, whereas those of 49 genes were decelerated. These numbers are in a proportion of 2.8:1, suggesting that accelerated evolution was about three times more
frequent than decelerated evolution in the evolution of
four Saccharomyces species. However, the proportion of
these two types of genes varied from lineage to lineage,
and the ratio of number of the genes with rate accelerations to those with rate decelerations was significantly
lower in the lineage A, and higher in the lineage B, than
for the average of all lineages (Fisher's exact probability
test; P < 0.001). These observations may reflect some species-specific biological features, such as changes in the
growth environment, in the lineages A and B. Yang (1998)
[26] reported that, by the LRT, the significant variations in
dN/dS were observed at 22 of 48 nuclear loci across the
lineages of primates, artiodactyls and rodents. However,
these results are not easily comparable with ours because
they examined the rate variations over a longer evolutionary time span (divergence time among these species is
approximately 90 MYA) and analyzed a limited number
of genes. Therefore, our results would be expected to show
more reliable estimates of changes in protein evolutionary
rates at the genome-wide level.
To confirm the changes in dN/dS ratio estimated by the
LRTs, we tested the differences in the ratio of number of
nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, estimated
by the approximate method performed by yn00 in the
PAML package, between the lineage of interest and other
lineages by Fisher's exact probability test. Most of the rate
changes (82.6%) were confirmed by this test (P < 0.05).
Because the maximum-likelihood method considers a
more realistic evolutionary model and has some advantages [26,27], compared with the approximate method,
we analyzed the genes experiencing changes in protein
evolutionary rates estimated by the LRTs in this study.
Although the number of genes with changes in protein
evolutionary rates differs from lineage to lineage, we
roughly estimated the frequency of the rate changes in the
course of closely related Saccharomyces evolution. In order
to estimate the evolutionary time scales for each lineage,

Figure 1
Phylogenetic relationships of the four species of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group
Phylogenetic relationships of the four species of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group. The phylogenetic tree was
constructed with the number of nucleotide substitutions, estimated by Kimura's two-parameter method, of concatenated
nucleotide sequences of 2,610 orthologous genes (3,776,106 sites) by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [22]. The names of
branches defined in this study are shown above each branch. The number below the interior branch represents the bootstrap
value (1000 replicates).

we constructed the linearized tree based on the concatenated nucleotide sequences of the genes which evolved at
constant rates. As shown in Figure 1, the divergence time
between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus was assumed to be
10 MYA and that between S. bayanus and the common
ancestor of the other three species was assumed to be 20
MYA. The results show that the changes in rates of protein
evolution have occurred with a probability of 2.0 × 10-3
per gene per million years on average. Furthermore, when
we divided it into the rate-acceleration and the rate-decel-

eration, each frequency was at least 1.3 × 10-3 and 4.6 × 104 per gene per million years, respectively. In this study,
because we assumed no variations in dN/dS ratio among
sites and then averaged the ratio over all sites in the gene,
we could only detect the variations in the rate of protein
evolution that occurred over a large part of a given gene in
a certain lineage. Thus, it should be noted that we may
have missed the rate changes occurring over a small part
of the gene and underestimated the number of genes with
rate changes.

Most of the changes in rates of protein evolution would be
caused by changes in the strength of functional constraint
There are two possible explanations for the changes in
rates of protein evolution. One is positive Darwinian
selection, and the other is change in the strength of functional constraints. It is generally thought that the genes
which experienced strong positive Darwinian selection
will have a dN/dS ratio greater than one. Thus, to examine
the contribution of positive Darwinian selection to the
changes in rates of protein evolution, we searched for the
rate-accelerated genes that have a dN/dS ratio greater than
one in the lineage in which rate acceleration occurred. The
dN/dS ratios for each lineage were estimated by the
CODEML program under the free-ratio model. As a result,
we found only six genes in which accelerated evolution
might be driven by positive Darwinian selection (Table
2). It is difficult to explain the rate decelerations by positive Darwinian selection, because positive selection usually acts to increase a dN/dS ratio in a given lineage.
Therefore, this result suggested that the remaining
changes in protein evolutionary rates (338 of 344 genes)
were mainly caused by changes in the strength of functional constraints during their evolution. Because positive
Darwinian selection often acts on a small number of
amino acid sites in a short period of evolutionary time, it
is difficult to detect it and such type of adaptive evolution
might be the cause of rate-acceleration in some of the
genes.

Changes in the dN/dS ratio can be caused by changes in
selective pressure acting on either synonymous or nonsynonymous sites. The major selective pressure acting on synonymous sites is codon usage bias. It is generally thought
that codon preferences reflect a balance between mutational biases and natural selection for translational optimization and that optimal codons help to achieve faster
translation rates and high accuracy [28]. Using the codon
adaptation index (CAI) [29] as a measure of codon usage
bias, we examined whether the changes in dN/dS ratio
were due to differences in codon usage bias among the
species. First, to examine whether codon usage biases acting on the genes with rate changes were more varied than
those on the genes with constant rate among the four Sac-

charomyces species, we calculated the coefficient of variation of CAI among the four species and compared the
distributions of those between the two groups of genes.
The resulting means of the coefficient of variation of CAI
were 0.054 and 0.051 for the genes with constant rates
and rate changes, respectively, and therefore were not very
different. Rather, in the constant-rate genes, codon usage
bias was more varied across the species. Next, for each
gene with rate changes, we examined whether the changes
in dN/dS ratio can be explained by higher or lower codon
usage bias in a specific lineage. For detecting the lineages
in which the codon usage bias was higher or lower than
others, we set the cut-off of CAI at the mean plus or minus
the standard deviation. Under this criterion, 2,541
(97.4%) genes showed variations in CAI across the four
species. As a result of detailed analysis of the relationships
between patterns of the changes in dN/dS ratio and the
variations of codon usage bias for each gene, we found
that only nine rate changes could be explained by changes
in codon usage bias in the specific lineage; these genes
were YDR490C, YEL036C, YER174C, YGL141W,
YIR003W, YJL061W, YLR298C, YMR301C and YPR113W.
For example, YEL036C, for which accelerated evolution
was observed in the lineage D, had stronger codon usage
bias in S. mikatae than in other species. This stronger
codon usage bias acting on the synonymous sites in the
lineage of S. mikatae might have caused the apparently
higher dN/dS ratio of YEL036C in the lineage D. These
results suggest that, although nine potential cases of variations in selective pressures acting on synonymous sites
were observed, this mechanism was not the major reason
for the changes in rates of protein evolution. Therefore,
most of the changes in protein evolutionary rates would
be caused by the changes in functional constraints acting
on the nonsynonymous sites.
Contribution of paralogous gene duplication and loss to
the changes in rates of protein evolution
In 1970, Ohno proposed that an increase in rates of protein evolution occurs immediately after gene duplication,
because of relaxation of the functional constraints acting
on the genes involved in the event [10]. Because we
excluded from our analysis orthologous genes that have

Lineage in which the accelerations of protein evolutionary rates occurred.

experienced recent species-specific duplication and loss
by the process of estimation of 1:1:1:1 unambiguously
defined orthologous genes, none of the rate changes
seemed to be caused by recent gene duplication and loss.
However, when paralogous genes, which were duplicated
before the divergence of the four Saccharomyces species, of
a given orthologous gene have similar functions and compensate for the function of each other, a species-specific
paralogous gene duplication and loss may affect the functional constraints acting on the orthologous gene, and
thus may cause the changes in protein evolutionary rates
in a given lineage. To examine this possibility, we estimated the paralogous gene duplication and loss that
occurred in the course of the evolution of four Saccharomyces species by checking the variations in the number of
family members among the four species (see Methods). As
a result of detailed investigations of the relationships
between changes in protein evolutionary rates and paralogous gene duplications and losses for each gene with rate
changes, we found only one case (YGL255W) in which the
rate change could be explained by loss of a paralogous
gene. In this case, the strengthened functional constraints
in the lineage D due to the loss of a paralogous gene might
be the cause of the protein evolutionary rate deceleration
in the lineage D. This suggests that most of the changes in
rates of protein evolution due to the changes in functional
constraints would have occurred in the evolution of Saccharomyces species, independently of gene duplications
and losses.
Biological function of the genes with protein evolutionary
rate changes
To reveal biological functions of the genes with the
changes in protein evolutionary rates, we used the Gene
Ontology (GO) annotation. GO terms assigned to each
gene in the S. cerevisiae genome were obtained from SGD
ftp site and statistical significances were assessed by using

GO::TermFinder [30] with 5% false discovery rate cut-off
level. As a result, "the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle"
related terms ("succinate dehydrogenase complex (ubiquinone)", "respiratory chain complex II", "succinate dehydrogenase complex" and "fumarate reductase complex")
were overrepresented in the genes with rate-change.
Under the presence of glucose, Saccharomyces generally
prefer to metabolize glucose by using the fermentative
Embden-Meyerhof pathway and produce ethanol even
when oxygen is abundant. When the glucose is exhausted,
cells undergo a "diauxic shift", in which they switch to a
fully respiratory metabolism, catabolizing carbon compounds via the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
in the mitochondria. Indeed, under conditions of glucose
scarcity, the expression levels of TCA cycle related genes
were significantly increased compared with those under
abundant glucose conditions [31]. Therefore, the functional constraints acting on these genes might be highly
variable by the effect of growing environment during the
Saccharomyces
evolution. Furthermore, "transport
between nucleus and cytoplasm" and "nuclear pore
organization" related terms ("snRNP protein import into
nucleus", "ribosomal protein import into nucleus",
"snRNA transport", "tRNA export from nucleus", "rRNA
transport", "tRNA transport" and "nuclear pore organization and biogenesis") were significantly enriched in the
genes with rate-acceleration in the Lineage B. Indeed, one
of nuclear pore protein genes, Nup96, is known as a gene
that causes epistatic inviability in hybrids between two
Drosophila sibling species, Drosophila melanogaster and D.
simulans [32]. These accelerated evolution of the genes
related to "transport" and "nuclear pore organization"
might be involved in the speciation between S. cerevisiae
and S. paradoxus. For other lineages, there are no critical
functional biases that characteristic to the genes with rate
changes, suggesting that the changes in functional constraints acting on those genes might be caused by a variety

of reasons in each lineage. The list of the functional
descriptions for all the genes with rate changes is available
as an additional file (Additional File 1).
Biological features of the genes with changes in protein
evolutionary rates
To reveal biological features of the genes with rate
changes, we compared some evolutionary and functional
data, such as gene length, mRNA expression level and
codon usage bias, across four groups of genes consisting
of the genes with constant rates, variable rates, rate accelerations and rate decelerations.

First, the lengths of nucleotide ORF sequences were measured in S. cerevisiae, because almost all S. cerevisiae genes
have been experimentally validated, and thus are more
reliable than those measured in other species. The gene
lengths (mean ± standard error) were 1,460 ± 18 bp and
1,731 ± 53 bp for the constant-rate and variable-rate
genes, respectively, and the variable-rate genes have significantly longer gene lengths than the constant-rate genes
(Wilcoxon rank sum test; P = 2.1 × 10-8). In addition, the
mean gene length for the genes with rate accelerations was
1,731 ± 78 bp, and for those with rate decelerations was
1,508 ± 133 bp. The rate-accelerated genes have significantly longer gene lengths than the constant-rate genes
(Wilcoxon rank sum test; P = 2.5 × 10-4) and also longer
than the rate-decelerated genes but not significantly.
Longer gene lengths of the rate-accelerated genes suggested that a longer sequence might be required for accumulation of still more substitutions. In other words,
because a large fraction of shorter protein-coding genes
consists of functionally important sequences, the protein
evolutionary rates of shorter genes might be difficult to
accelerate.
In order to examine the relationships between the mRNA
expression levels and the changes in rate of protein evolution during evolution, we used two kinds of mRNA abundance data (mRNA molecules/cell) measured by highdensity oligonucleotide array [20] and DNA microarray
[21]. As shown in Figure 3, for the high-density oligonucleotide array data of Holstage et al. (1998) [20], no significant difference in the expression level was observed
between the constant-rate and variable-rate genes; the
mean mRNA abundances were 2.17 ± 0.12 and 2.85 ±
0.40 mRNA molecules/cell, respectively. Furthermore, the
mRNA abundances of the rate-accelerated genes were
lower than those of the rate-decelerated genes, though the
difference is not significant; the mean mRNA abundances
were 1.47 ± 0.22 and 3.19 ± 0.99 mRNA molecules/cell,
respectively. When we used the DNA microarray data of

To further examine the relationships to the expression levels, codon usage bias was used as the second measure of
mRNA expression level. Codon usage bias is more likely
to reflect the level of expression linked to protein evolution, because it determines the efficiency of translation
and therefore will be a good predictor of expression level
over the evolutionary history of the gene, rather than at a
single time point in the laboratory. We used mean CAI
among the four species as a measure of codon usage bias
for each gene. As shown in Figure 4, a significant difference in CAI was observed between the rate-accelerated
and -decelerated genes (Wilcoxon rank sum test; P <
0.01); the mean CAIs were 0.28 ± 0.01 and 0.34 ± 0.02,
respectively. The genes with rate accelerations have significantly lower CAI and those with rate decelerations have
significantly higher CAIs than the constant-rate genes
(Wilcoxon rank sum test; P < 0.05); the mean CAI of the
constant-rate genes was 0.30 ± 0.00. Together with the
results from analysis using mRNA abundance data, these
results suggest that the rate-accelerated genes have lower
expression levels, and have weaker codon usage biases,
than the constant-rate and rate-decelerated genes. When
we used effective number of codons as another measure of
codon usage bias, we also obtained essentially the same
results (data not shown).
Some of the aforementioned functional data, such as gene
length and mRNA abundance, were measured only in S.
cerevisiae. Therefore, we limited the rate changes to those
occurring in the lineages leading to S. cerevisiae after the
divergence from the S. mikatae lineage, that is the lineages
A, A-B and A-B-C, and performed the same analysis as
described above. In the limited data, the numbers of the
genes with rate accelerations and decelerations were
reduced to 53 and 34 genes, respectively. As a result, the
genes with rate accelerations still showed significantly
lower expression levels (Wilcoxon rank sum test; P < 0.05)
than those with rate decelerations. The significantly lower
levels of CAI for the genes with rate accelerations, corresponding to weaker codon usage bias, were also confirmed in the limited data. However, although the genes
with rate accelerations have gene lengths even longer than
those with rate decelerations (the mean ± standard error
gene lengths were 1,627 ± 133 and 1,586 ± 205 bp, respectively), no significant difference was observed between the
two groups of genes. Thus, the gene length may seem to
weakly relate to the variability of the rate of protein evolution. Taken together, these results suggest that the probability of the acceleration of protein evolutionary rates was
highly influenced by the selection underlying level of
mRNA expression. It is thought that this is due to an excessive accumulation of nucleotide substitutions that would
be a significant problem for highly expressed genes.

Recent studies have reported that selection for translational efficiency and accuracy (translational selection)
was a major cause of the variation in protein evolutionary
rate among genes in the Yeast genome [33], and that the
protein evolutionary rate was negatively correlated to
mRNA abundance in the cell and codon usage bias.
Indeed, in our dataset, mean dN/dS ratios among the four
species were negatively correlated to the mRNA abundances (n = 2481, P = 4.5 × 10-73, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: r = -0.35) and CAI (n = 2481, P = 6.3 ×
10-210, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: r = -0.57).
From these results, we concluded that the protein evolutionary rates of the genes having relatively high dN/dS
ratios, lower expression levels and weaker codon usage
biases tend to be accelerated during the evolution of
closely related species and this directional selection may
increase variation of protein evolutionary rates.

Conclusion
Using the LRTs, we found that the rates of protein evolution of many genes changed even in the evolutionary
course of closely related biologically and morphologically
similar species. Furthermore, we found that the genes with
rate accelerations tend to have lower expression level and
weaker codon usage bias than those with rate decelerations, suggesting that selection for translational efficiency
and accuracy may underlie the variability of the protein
evolutionary rates. Therefore, when we estimate the accurate evolutionary times or phylogenetic relationships of
species based on the sequence divergences of orthologous
genes, we should be careful about variable-rate genes,
because amino acid substitutions did not occur in proportion to evolutionary time in such genes. In addition, it is
also necessary to be very careful to regard such genes as
biologically and evolutionally meaningful, because such

rate-changes possibly occur frequently even in the evolution of closely related species. Although it is still not
clearly understood why such changes in selective constraints acting on the genes occurred, our research sheds
light on the features of dynamic changes in protein evolutionary rates in the evolution of closely related species and
on the major factors for the rate variability at the genomewide level.

Methods
Construction of the set of 1:1:1:1 orthologous genes among
four Saccharomyces sensu stricto species
The entire set of nucleotide ORF sequences of S. cereßvisiae
were downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD, updated on 26 Jan, 2006) [34]. For S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus, the nucleotide ORF
sequences predicted by Kellis et al. (2003) [19] were
downloaded from SGD (updated on 15 Dec, 2004). The
numbers of downloaded nucleotide ORF sequences were

5,874, 8,955, 9,057 and 9,424, respectively. All nucleotide ORF sequences were translated into amino acid
sequences, and we excluded truncated ORF sequences
from the dataset. As a result of this process, the numbers
of ORF sequences were reduced to 5,855, 7,474, 7,095
and 7,948, respectively. To extract 1:1 orthologous genes
between S. cerevisiae and other species, using these ORF
datasets and the information of potential orthologous
gene sets estimated by synteny-based orthology designation [19], we discarded the genes of other three species
that corresponded to two or more S. cerevisiae genes. The
information whether a given gene hits a single S. cerevisiae
gene or multiple genes is contained in the ORF sequences
files downloaded from SGD. As a result, 3,622 sets of
orthologous genes among the four Saccharomyces species
were obtained. Next, we aligned the translated amino acid
ORF sequences by ClustalW [35] with the default parameters, and the aligned amino acid sequences were reverse-

translated into nucleotide sequences, converting a single
gap into a group of three gaps using in-house perl scripts.
For each orthologous gene, the number of synonymous
substitutions per synonymous site and the number of
nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site
in each lineage were estimated by the maximum-likelihood method implemented in the PAML CODEML program [25]. To determine equilibrium codon frequencies,
we used two models. The first model used the nucleotide
frequencies at the three positions within the codon and
had 9 = 3 × (4 - 1) parameters. The second model used
empirical estimates of 61 codon frequencies and had 60
parameters. Likelihood ratio tests comparing these two
models with 51 (= 60 - 9) degrees of freedom suggested
statistically significant differences for 2,625 of 3,622
(72.5%) orthologous genes, and the second model was
better in the majority of cases. dN and dS estimated with
both models were similar and results obtained using
empirical estimates of codon frequencies were used in further analysis.
To avoid contamination of paralogous genes and underestimation of the numbers of synonymous substitutions
due to the saturation of synonymous sites, we excluded
the genes having a dS greater than 1.0 in at least one lineage. We also excluded the genes having less than one synonymous substitution in at least one lineage. Finally, we
obtained 2,610 unambiguously defined 1:1:1:1 orthologous genes among the four closely related Saccharomyces
species.
Statistical test for detecting changes in protein
evolutionary rate across lineages by likelihood ratio tests
To test the constancy of rate of protein evolution during
the evolution of four Saccharomyces species, we performed
a series of likelihood ratio tests between constant-rate and
variable-rate models for five lineages corresponding to
four exterior branches and one interior branch shown in
Figure 1[26,36]. We used the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio (denoted as dN/dS ratio or ω)
as a measure of protein evolutionary rate.

First, to test whether rates of protein evolution are different among all evolutionary lineages, we performed the
LRT comparing the free-ratio model where all five lineages
have different values of ω estimated from the data with
the one-ratio model where all lineages share a common
value of ω. Because the free-ratio model has five parameters for ω and the one-ratio model has only one, the LRT
statistic is calculated as 2 times the differences in maximum log likelihood (2ΔlnL) and is asymptotically distributed as a χ2 distribution with 4 degrees of freedom. Next,
we tested whether the lineages of interest have a different
ω from other lineages, in other words, whether the protein

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/9

evolutionary rate has changed at a certain point in the
course of evolution. For this purpose, we conducted the
LRTs independently, comparing the one-ratio model with
seven two-ratio models (Figure 2), which assumes that the
lineages of interest have a ωX that is different from the
background ratio ω0. In these LRTs, 2ΔlnL between oneratio and two-ratio models should follow a χ2 distribution
with 1 degree of freedom. In each two-ratio model, we
assumed that lineage A, B, C, D, E, the pair of the lineages
A and B (lineage A-B), and the combination of the lineages A, B and C (lineage A-B-C) have their corresponding
individual ωX, respectively. For example, in the case of
detection of variation in the rate of protein evolution in
the lineage A, we assume that the lineage A has a certain
ωA that is different from that background (lineage B, C, D
and E) ratio ω0 and compare log likelihood value between
one-ratio and this two-ratio models. If the null hypothesis
in which ω is constant among the five lineages is correct,
2ΔlnL between the two models asymptotically has a χ2
distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
When the variable-rate (free-ratio and two-ratio) model fit
the data significantly better than the constant-rate model,
we assigned the variable-rate model as the best-fit evolutionary model of the gene (P < 0.05, after correction of
multiple tests by Bonferroni-correction). When two or
more variable-rate models fit the data significantly, we
chose the model with the lowest P-value for LRT as the
best-fit evolutionary model of the gene. The 2ΔlnL scores
and P-values under the best-fit evolutionary model for all
genes experiencing change in protein evolutionary rate are
shown in Additional File 1. Furthermore, for the genes
having two different dN/dS ratios in their evolution, we
assigned the lineage and the direction of change in the
dN/dS ratio (acceleration or deceleration of protein evolutionary rate) based on the maximum-parsimony principle.
To confirm the genes experiencing rate changes estimated
by LRTs, we compared the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions in the
lineage of interest with the average ratio in other lineages
by Fisher's exact probability test. The ancestral nucleotide
sequences of two interior nodes were estimated by the
joint reconstruction method implemented in PAML [37],
and estimation of the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were performed with the yn00
program in PAML package [27].
Identification of duplicated genes and estimation of
paralogous gene duplication and loss
To identify duplicated genes in each of the four Saccharomyces genomes, every translated amino acid ORF
sequence was used as a query to search against all other
ORF sequences using the SSEARCH program in FASTA

package [38]. In this analysis, we excluded the ORF
sequences that were estimated as one-to-one orthologous
genes of S. cerevisiae dubious ORF by synteny-based
orthology designation [19] from the ORF sequences for S.
paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus. Duplicated genes in
each genome were identified as hits with an E-value of
smaller than 10 that could be aligned over 50% of the
length of the longer protein, following the study of Gu et
al. (2003) [39]. In addition, we also used a cutoff threshold of identity score between two ORFs (sequence identity
>30% in amino acids), according to the study of Gu et al.
(2002) [40]. As a result of this analysis, we obtained
1,930, 1,776, 1,508 and 1,553 duplicated genes for S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus, respectively.
We estimated the number of gene families and the members of each family by a single linkage clustering of duplicated genes for each species. Furthermore, for each
orthologous gene, based on the phylogenetic relationships and the numbers of family members for each species, we estimated species-specific paralogous gene, which
were duplicated before the divergence of the four species,
duplication and loss occurring in the evolution of the four
Saccharomyces species. When three species, for example S.
paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus, have five members in
a certain gene family, whereas only four genes in the corresponding S. cerevisiae gene family, we can estimate a
paralogous gene loss in the lineage leading to S. cerevisiae
(lineage A) based on the maximum-parsimony principle.

Functional genomic data
As measurements of expression levels, we used two sets of
mRNA abundance data measured by high-density oligonucleotide arrays [20] and cDNA microarrays [21]. As
measurements of expression levels and selective constraints acting on synonymous sites, we used the codon
adaptation index (CAI) [29] and the effective number of
codons (ENC) [41]. The set of optimal codons for calculating CAI values was taken from the top 20 highly
expressed genes in S. cerevisiae [42].
