Abstract
Background: The expression of gene batteries, genomic units of functionally linked genes which
are activated by similar sets of cis- and trans-acting regulators, has been proposed as a major
determinant of cell specialization in metazoans. We developed a predictive procedure to screen
the mouse and human genomes and transcriptomes for cases of gene-battery-like regulation.
Results: In a screen that covered ~40 per cent of all annotated protein-coding genes, we identified
21 co-expressed gene clusters with statistically supported sharing of cis-regulatory sequence
elements. 66 predicted cases of over-represented transcription factor binding motifs were
validated against the literature and fell into three categories: (i) previously described cases of gene
battery-like regulation, (ii) previously unreported cases of gene battery-like regulation with some
support in a limited number of genes, and (iii) predicted cases that currently lack experimental
support. The novel predictions include for example Sox 17 and RFX transcription factor binding
sites that were detected in ~10% of all testis specific genes, and HNF-1 and 4 binding sites that were
detected in ~30% of all kidney specific genes respectively. The results are publicly available at http:/
/www.wlab.gu.se/lindahl/genebatteries.
Conclusion: 21 co-expressed gene clusters were enriched for a total of 66 shared cis-regulatory
sequence elements. A majority of these predictions represent novel cases of potential coregulation of functionally coupled proteins. Critical technical parameters were evaluated, and the
results and the methods provide a valuable resource for future experimental design.

Background
To understand how gene expression is coordinated to produce hundreds of cell phenotypes from an identical complement of genes is a principal challenge in mammalian
genome research. A commonly suggested model for termi-

nal differentiation in metazoans is that the core features of
the cellular phenotype are mediated by a set of genes that
is regulated as a gene battery, i.e. a set of functionally coupled genes that are activated by similar cis- and trans-acting regulators [1-3]. Although the gene battery is an

idealized concept, concrete examples of gene battery-like
regulation have been found in for example muscle subtypes [4-7], megakaryocytes [8], the epidermis [9] and
lymphocytes [10,11].
A key step in the elucidation of gene battery-like regulation is to detect and functionally test the cis regulatory elements that mediate the co-regulation. A number of
computation-based methods have been proposed to do
this. In micro-organisms, computational methods have
proven useful to detect modules of co-regulated genes
[12,13]. In mammals, predictive models based on
assumed co-regulation at the cis level have been constructed for liver- and skeletal muscle-selective gene regulation [14,15], and general tools have been developed for
the regulatory analysis of co-expressed genes [16-18].
The aim of this work is to screen the mouse and human
genomes and transcriptomes for instances where sharing
of cis-regulatory sequences is statistically coupled to conserved co-expression of genes, i.e. cases that fall within or
near the idealized gene battery concept. Another aim is to
critically investigate technical parameters in order to maximize the sensitivity by which co-regulation of coexpressed genes can be detected. In a screen that covered
~40 per cent of all protein-coding genes according to the
latest Ensembl annotation, we identified 21 co-expressed
gene clusters with 66 cases of statistically supported sharing of cis-regulatory sequence motifs. The predictive value
of the assignment of transcription factor binding sites was
experimentally evaluated on EBF binding sites in a set of
B-cell expressed gene clusters. The predicted cases of coregulation include several previously known prototype
examples of tissue specific regulation, but also novel predictions. All data are made available to the research community in the form of an internet resource that may serve
as a starting point for further analysis.

Results
The analysis was based on the assumption that homologous genes in mouse and human are equivalent in most
aspects of regulation and function. In particular, we
assumed that the transcriptional regulation is conserved
for orthologous genes. For example, the mouse gene Myh1
and the human gene MYH1 are assumed to share expression pattern and to share important cis-regulatory
sequences. Below, the term 'ortholog pair' will be applied
as a two-species equivalent of 'gene', for which expression
and sequence data where retrieved for both mouse and
human. Ensembl gene annotations [19,20] were applied
thoughout the analysis.

Co-expressed gene sets were defined from a compendium
of mouse and human expression data and tested for
functional coupling
Previous results by our group and others have shown that
statistical analysis of gene expression profiles in a large
compendium of expression data can predict targets of differentiation processes, and identify functionally coupled
genes [12,21,22]. In the following analysis, we specifically
focused on a compendium derived from the recently completed Novartis expression atlas (SymAtlas) [23]. These
data contain transcription profiles for 140 mouse and
human tissues generated by hybridization on customized
Affymetrix chips, and cover a large fraction of the mouse
and human protein-coding genes. Sequence annotation
of the Novartis probes linked the mouse and human data
to approximately 17.000 unique Ensembl gene identities
in each species (Table 1). Between the two datasets, 13282
non-redundant ortholog pairs could be identified by linkage of reciprocal Ensembl homology assignments (Table
1). In later steps, we excluded genes for which regulatory
sequence could not be extracted (Methods), leaving 9561
ortholog pairs for clustering (Table 1). The final dataset
included ~40% of the mouse and human Ensembl annotated genes.
Clustering
We clustered the mouse/human ortholog pairs based on
their expression profiles across the 140 mouse and human
tissues (Methods). We computed clusters at cut-off levels
ranging from Pearson's correlation coefficient (hereafter
termed PCC) 0.61 to 0.99. At the lowest applied cut-off,
57% of all ortholog pairs in the data were members of a
cluster. The cluster sizes were distributed in a skewed
manner, with a predominant formation of small clusters
(Figure 1A). All analyses hereafter were performed at a
PCC = 0.75 cut-off, which generated 160 clusters with
2407 ortholog pairs. This relatively stringent cut-off was
chosen to reduce the number of non-relevant genes in the
clusters. A higher cut-off did not seem reasonable given
the noise-level of the microarray experiments (as judged
by the Pearson correlation between replicated samples
and between probes that are annotated for the same gene,
data not shown).
Assessment of functional linkage
According to the definition, a gene battery should encode
functionally linked proteins. We used Gene Ontology
(GO) terms, protein-protein interactions (from the BIND
database [24]), and manual curation to assess functional
linkage within our expression clusters. First, we investigated the relationship between expression profile similarity of two ortholog pairs and their relative probability to
share a functional annotation term or to encode interacting proteins (Figure 1B). There was a consistent correlation between co-expression and the relative probability

for two genes to share a GO-term or to encode interacting
proteins (Figure 1B).
Second, we studied the statistical over-representation of
GO terms and interacting proteins inside the clusters
(Methods). 30/32 clusters with ten or more ortholog pairs
contained at least one over-represented GO term. The proportion of small clusters with over-represented GO terms
was lower, which reflects a lack of statistical power in
small clusters. Genes encoding interacting protein pairs
were also over-represented inside clusters. 35 cases of protein-protein interaction between two genes in the same
cluster were found. In contrast, 1000 simulations on permuted data revealed a median of 9 interactions (observations ranging between 5 and 21). The BIND data
contained only 600 interactions that could be mapped to
the dataset, which explains the seemingly low number of
35 interactions.
Finally, the clusters were annotated by manual curation.
Six examples are shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and clusters with predicted regulators are listed in Table 2. For a
full overview, see the web supplement http://
www.wlab.gu.se/lindahl/genebatteries. Several clusters
clearly represent gene sets that mediate specialized features
of different cell types, including smooth muscle specific
genes (cluster 40, Figure 2), B lymphocyte-specific genes
(cluster 16, Figure 3), and genes selectively expressed in
the testis (cluster 5, part shown in Figure 4). Further, we
detected clusters that were related to cellular processes or
organelles, including endoplasmatic reticulum (cluster 13,
Figure 5), protein synthesis (cluster 1, Figure 6), and modulators of transcriptional regulation (cluster 65, Figure 7).

A grand majority of the clusters were defined by peaks at
different amplitudes in several tissues. As an example, the
endoplasmatic reticulum cluster (Figure 5) was defined by
a highly variant profile with strong expression in, for
example, exocrine glands. Generally, the cluster profiles
were conserved between species, in the sense that clusters
were defined by peaks in the same organs. This effect was
more pronounced for clusters with expression in a single
organ, such as the testis (data not shown).
In combination, the GO term enrichment, the proteinprotein interaction, and the manual curation convincingly show that clustered genes are functionally linked.
Regulatory DNA and descriptions of transcription factor
binding sites were extracted and pre-processed
In the next part of the analysis, individual ortholog pairs
were scored for transcription factor binding sites. Binding
motifs were represented in the form of Position Frequency
Matrices (hereafter denoted PFMs). Based on a fixed
amount of upstream DNA sequence in each ortholog pair,
a statistical score was computed to predict the potential
for a site in the sequence to bind the factor corresponding
to a PFM (described in detail in Methods). We extracted
upstream + intronic sequence from the Ensembl database,
in amounts of 2, 6 or 15 kb per gene (see Methods for
details on boundaries). A filter was applied that removed
ortholog pairs for which the transcription start differed
between the two species (>1000 bp difference, see Methods). Filtering was successful for 12239 unique ortholog
pairs (Table 1). In a subsequent filter, DNA sequence that
was not conserved between mouse and human was
removed,

footprinting.

Co-expression as a predictor for shared function, protein interaction and paralogy. We identified all gene pairs that correlated
above or below a threshold T (X-axis). We measured the fraction of such pairs for which there was (i) a BIND database protein-protein interaction recorded in human, (ii) at least one shared gene ontology term, and (iii) evidence of paralogy. We then
computed the relative probability for genes above T with this feature, compared to gene pairs below T. At expression correlation 0.80, co-expression was associated with a 100-fold relative probability for genes to encode protein interactors, a 10-fold
probability for genes to share functional annotation, but only a 3-fold probability for genes to be paralogs. C: Fraction of clusters with at least one over-represented GO term (Y axis), as a function of cluster size (X axis). GO term over-representations

Over-represented motifs arranged by cluster number. FDR column: False Discovery Rate (estimated probability for the over-representation to be a
spurious detection). Motifs are are shown both by their numerical identifiers (PFM number) and by their annotation (PFM annotation). In cases
where a PFM is a composite based on more than one source, the components are given separated by commas. The data where generated from the
PCC = 0.75 clustering, 2 kb sequence database, at 90% phylogenetic conservation.

Phylogenetic footprinting was applied at different stringency, to allow the following optimization of the protocol
(below). Furthermore, all exon sequence was removed
from the analysis (Methods). Finally, the sequences were
matched with the expression data based on annotation,
the overlap being 9561 ortholog pairs (Table 1).
322 vertebrate PFMs were downloaded from the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases [25,26]. Since the databases
appeared to contain redundant or equivalent entries,
highly similar PFMs were grouped and merged using single linkage hierarchical clustering and a PFM distance
measure defined in [27], which reduced the number of
PFMs from 322 to 266 (Methods). This step reduced the
redundancy, but did not merge all identically annotated
PFMs (see for example the redundant serum response factor (SRF) PFMs in Table 2, cluster 40).

Design of a predictive scoring system for transcription
factor binding
After the retrieval and preprocessing of both sequences
and PFMs, all individual sequences were tested for PFM
matches using the MAST software [28], a software for
identifying single or multiple motifs in sequences. MAST
was set to compute one p-value for each PFM with respect
to each sequence (Methods). Based on the p-values
obtained from the MAST software, a composite score was
defined as the product of the p-value in the mouse and
human sequences of an ortholog pair (Methods). A composite score close to 0 indicates that both the mouse and
human promoter sequence in the ortholog pair contains
sequence elements that are in very good agreement with a
certain PFM.

To address the biological validity of the MAST composite
scores within the context of a set of co-expressed genes, we
screened 48 ortholog pairs present in B-cell expressed
clusters for individual EBF sites. In all, 24 individual EBF

sites in 15 different ortholog pairs were detected (supplementary data, additional file 1). To test the functionality
(in terms of EBF binding) of these sites, we examined the
potential of 22 basepair duplex oligo-nucleotides spanning the presumed sites to compete for protein binding in
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA:s). EBF binding capacity was assayed using nuclear extracts from the
pre-B cell line 40-EI, a labelled mouse mb-1 promoter
high affinity EBF site [29], and competitor oligo-nucleotides covering the new potential binding sites. In the
absence of competitor oligo-nucleotide, a prominent
DNA/protein complex (mb-1/EBF) could be detected
whereas this complex was undetectable after the addition
of a 300 fold molar excess of the unlabeled binding site
(mb-1). The identity of the protein and the specificity of
the binding were verified by competition with a point
mutated mb-1/EBF site and by the inclusion of an EBF
specific antibody into the reaction mixture (Figure 8B).
The point mutated EBF binding site was unable to abolish
complex formation even in a 1000-fold molar excess (Figure 8B), indicating that we detect specific protein DNA
interactions with this experimental set up. 18 out of the 24
new binding sites competed for complex formation when
added in a 300- or 1000-fold molar excess, and thus have

the ability to bind EBF in vitro (Figure 8A). We conclude
that the large majority of binding sites were able to functionally interact with the predicted protein, and that the
composite score in principle detected factor binding. It
should however be emphasized that the quality of
predictions is dependent on the quality of the binding site
descriptions, and the result does not necessarily imply
that other predicted factors bind.
A statistical procedure was used to detect enriched motifs
in the clusters
To test whether the identified clusters represent potential
gene batteries, i.e. contain shared cis-regulatory elements,
we designed a procedure to detect significant over-representation of orthologs that match a PFM inside a cluster.
The procedure is based on a modification of Fisher's exact
test, which tests for dependency between two events (in
this case cluster membership vs detection of a motif) [30].
We introduced a procedure to optimize the composite
score thresholds for individual PFMs. In brief, we selected
the threshold that gave the lowest Fisher test p-value in
any one cluster. This was based on the assumption that
non-random distribution of detections over clusters

The Fisher test p-values with the optimized thresholds are
hereafter termed p-scores.

The tests of multiple detection thresholds, multiple clusters and 266 PFMs led to a need to compensate for mass
testing. This was done by estimating false discovery rates
(FDR) based on simulations on randomized data. In brief,

we compared the outcome when using permuted and
when using observed data at different p-scores, and
defined the FDR as the ratio between the two (Figure 9A).
This procedure allowed us to choose a significance threshold with a controlled expected number of spurious detections. Simulations were repeated 100 times. Since
optimization of detection thresholds were repeated in
each simulation round, no bias in disfavour of the control
case was introduced.

The detection of over-represented PFMs was affected by
DNA amount and masking, but not affected by gene
paralogy
Using the described algorithm, we analyzed the number
of times a motif was over-represented when using different amounts of DNA sequence per gene (2, 6 or 15 kb)
and different stringency in the phylogenetic footprinting
(>0% (keep all sequence), >60%, >70%, >80% or >90%

phylogenetic footprinting appeared to be beneficial, and
between DNA amounts, 2 kb and 4 kb compared favourably over 15 kb (Figure 9C). We conclude that optimal
results are obtained when using a limited amount of
sequence per gene (see Discussion).

A potential confounding factor in the analysis is that similarity in upstream sequence may be attributable to factors
other than shared cis-regulatory elements. The most
important such factor is likely to be gene paralogy, since
over-represented motifs might simply represent matches
to non-functional (not yet diverged) sequence in a co-

expressed gene family. In total, 22343 cases of pairwise
paralogy were detected in the dataset of 9561 ortholog
pairs using BLAST. All genes with transcripts matches at a
BLAST E-value less than 1.0 were defined as potential paralogs. Of the 2407 ortholog pairs that clustered, 219 genes
had a paralog inside the same cluster. This was clearly an
over-representation since filling clusters with random
genes from the dataset produced an average of 122 genes
with a paralog inside a cluster (values between 104 to 131
observed in 10 randomization rounds). In a side-by-side
comparison, we therefore analyzed the effect of removing
paralogs from a cluster before testing for over-represented
motifs (see Methods), as opposed to not removing paralogs but the same number of randomly selected genes. The
results showed no increase in the number of over-represented motifs when allowing paralogs in the same cluster
(Figure 9B).
66 over-represented motifs were observed in 21 clusters
The final analysis was performed with 2 kb sequence and
80% phylogenetic footprinting (results generated with
variations of these parameters are found in the web supplement). Again, the clustering generated at PCC = 0.75
was chosen for analysis. The over-representation algorithm was run in the above cases, using 100 simulations
to estimate false discovery rate thresholds. Over-represented motifs with FDR:s less than 2.5% and 10% were
recorded. Key features of these results are presented in
Tables 2 and 3, and the complete results are available by
web browser http://www.wlab.gu.se/lindahl/genebatter
ies.

A predictive screen performed with these settings associated 66 motifs to co-expression in a total of 21 clusters at
FDR thresholds 2.5% and 10% (Table 2). There was a
clear tendency for motifs to be detected in most large clusters, and for smaller clusters to lack over-represented
motifs. This can be directly explained by the fact that even
a high degree of motif presence in a small cluster can be
attributed to spurious detections, and that the Fisher test
accounts for that. The over-represented motifs were validated against the literature, and fell into three main categories: 1) previously described cases of gene-battery-like
regulation, 2)previously unreported cases of gene batterylike regulation with some support in a limited number of
genes, and 3) hypothetical cases of gene battery regulation
(Table 3, Discussion).
In the typical case, an over-represented motif did not
cover all cluster members but rather a fraction. The average coverage was 15%, with observations ranging from
1% to 100%. The limited coverage can be exemplified by
the relatively large (104 ortholog pairs) cluster of liverselective genes, which contained 8 over-represented
motifs at FDR<10%, where the PFM annotation implied
HNF1, HNF4, ARP1, PPAR-γ, and COUP-TF as the binding factors (Table 2). These different motifs were detected
in between 8 and 19 ortholog pairs, indicating a cluster
coverage of less than 20%. An example of very high
coverage was observed in the cluster that contained
smooth muscle differentiation markers, in which 6/7
(86%) ortholog pairs were positive for a Serum Response
Factor (SRF) motif. We compared our results for HNF-1 to

False discovery rate estimation. A: Illustration of how false discovery rates (FDRs) were estimated by use of simulations.
Values on the y axis represent the number of motifs below a certain p-score (x axis). Triangles show results for observed data,
filled circles show results for permuted data (error bars show the 90% confidence interval from 100 simulations). The FDR was
calculated as the ratio between the simulated expectation and the observation. Red dotted line: The number of clusters with at
least one enriched motif. Note that several motifs where over-represented in the same cluster. B: Removal of paralogous
genes from each cluster did not affect the number of detected motifs. Consequently, co-expressed paralogs is not an important
source of false positives. C: The amount of DNA used per gene, and the phylogenetic footprinting stringency has a strong
effect on the number of detected over-represented motifs. The sensitivity is higher when the amount of DNA is reduced.
Error bars in B and C were obtained by using the 5th and 95th percentiles in the simulation to define the FDR.

a whole-genome experimental screen for targets of this
factor in hepatocytes [32]. 28% (29/104) of the ortholog
pairs inside the liver cluster contained experimentally verified HNF-1 sites, which indicates a high but not complete
coverage. Cross-comparison of experimentally and computationally identified HNF-1 targets showed a 69% –
71% agreement (results for the two different HNF-1 PFMs
at 2 kb/gene masked for 90% phylogenetic conservation).
As a complement to using database motifs, we applied de
novo motif elicitation to screen the regulatory sequence of
each cluster for over-represented DNA motifs that were
not present in databases. A two-step procedure based on
the MEME algorithm [33] was developed (Methods). The
use of a cluster to define a PFM will lead to a bias when

testing for over-representation. A simulation that involved
motif elicitation from randomized clusters was used to
account for this bias (Methods). 28 de novo motifs were
identified as over-represented in relation to the null simulation (Supplementary data, additional file 1). Of these
28 motifs, 13 matched a described database motif (based
on the PFM similarity score described in Methods and in
footnote of supplementary table). 9/13 of the matching
motifs corresponded to motifs that were over-represented
in Table 3. The remaining 15 motifs may represent novel
regulatory elements. These motifs, and a description of
the procedure, are available in the supplementary
information.

Discussion
The gene battery theory predicts that the core features of
differentiated cells are encoded by gene batteries, i.e.
groups of functionally coupled, co-expressed genes that
are regulated by similar sets of cis-regulatory elements. The
primary aim of this article was to survey the mouse and
human genomes for cases that fall within or close to the
idealized gene battery concept.
Hierarchical clustering of an extensive compendium of
micro-array expression data in mouse and human
identified large numbers of co-expressed gene groups. A
grand majority of the larger clusters were significantly
enriched for genes that shared one or several GO-terms,
indicating that co-expressed genes are functionally coupled. Moreover, interactions were significantly more common between proteins that are encoded by clustered pairs
compared to randomly chosen pairs. 21 clusters, finally,
were significantly enriched for genes that shared potential
cis-regulatory elements
Confirmation and extension of several cases of gene
battery-like regulation
The predicted over represented motifs (Table 2) fell into
three principal categories: (i) predictions in agreement
with described gene batteries, (ii) predictions supported
by a limited number of observations, where the analysis
predicted gene battery-like regulation, and (iii) novel
predictions of hypothetical gene batteries. The findings
are summarized with respect to these categories in Table 3.

For type (i) predictions the method is useful for proposing
new target genes. As an example, the smooth muscle cluster contains 4 validated serum response factor (SRF)
targets (Acta2, Actg2, Myl11, Tagln) [5]. The method identifies two more genes in this cluster, Myl9 and Lpp as
potential SRF targets in smooth muscle (Figure 2). The
findings in two clusters that are relevant for lymphocytes
(cluster 4 in the web supplement) and B-lymphocytes
(cluster 16, Figure 3) are further examples of type (i) predictions. Cluster 4 contains genes that are expressed by
various lymphocyte populations. Significantly enriched
motifs were Irf1/Irf2, NF-kappaB, and ISRE. Irf1 and Ir2
appear to bind the same sites [34]. Irf1 knockout mice are
impaired in their myelopoiesis [35]. NFkappaB is a wellknown regulator of inflammation and immune functions
[36]. Cluster 16 contains genes that are specifically
expressed in B-lymphocytes. SpiB was identified as the
most over-represented PFM followed by AREB6 and Oct1. Knockout of SpiB caused specific defects in B-cell
terminally differentiated functions [37]. AREB6 is a
hematopoietic transcriptional repressor [38]. Whereas
Oct-1 seems to be dispensable for B-cell development
[39], it regulates B lymphocyte genes in combination with
specific co-activators [40].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/68

In type (ii) cases, a regulator with some degree of documentation is statistically supported to play a role in gene
battery-like regulation. As an example, RFX family proteins have been shown to regulate a limited number of
genes in spermatogenesis, and SOX17 has been shown to
be expressed in the testis [41-43]. Here, we demonstrate
that motifs corresponding to these factors are present in
8–11% of testis-selective genes (Figure 4). 29% of kidneyspecific genes were covered by HNF-1 and HNF-4 sites,
suggesting that these genes may be general regulators in
the kidney.
Finally, type (iii) cases represent novel predictions which
can be viewed as testable hypotheses of regulatory mechanisms. A complete list of PFMs in the different categories
with references to the literature is presented in Table 3.
Examples include a potential functional role for an Ikaroslike motif in retina-selective genes (cluster 44 in the web
supplementary), and a Pax family factor acting on extracellular matrix genes with strong expression in arteries
(cluster 8 in the web supplementary). Interestingly, a
combination of Ets family factor motifs, Nuclear respiratory factor motifs, and E2F motifs was detected in several
clusters of a housekeeping character (Table 3).
Incomplete coverage of cis-regulatory motifs indicates
that other mechanisms than co-regulation may contribute
to coordinated expression
The gene battery concept predicts that upstream transcription factors coordinate the expression of target genes
through binding to similar cis-regulatory elements in the
target genes. In a recent report, Alloco and co-workers [44]
studied the relationship between co-expression in yeast
(as determined by correlation in a set of 610 arrays) and
the probability of sharing a transcription factor (as determined by experiments). In their experiments, an
expression profile correlation of 0.85 implied a probability of transcription factor sharing of >0.5. The incomplete
coverage in our analysis may similarly indicate that other
mechanisms than co-regulation contribute to the coordinated expression. Importantly, it is technically difficult to
accurately quantify the fraction of genes in a cluster that
respond to a factor. The presence of false positive gene
cluster members reduces the coverage. Uncertainty in the
motif assignment to ortholog pairs may also reduce the
coverage. In one case study, we could use data from an
independent experimental screen to confirm that the
liver-selective cluster had a limited coverage of HNF-1
responders (results). Further experiments are required to
resolve to what extent the lack of coverage reflects alternative regulatory mechanisms or technical limitations.
Data limitations
The tissues in the dataset represent samples of limited
morphological resolution at a fixed time point. As a

consequence, co-expressed gene groups that are active
under specific developmental phases, under specific environmental stresses, or in small and localized anatomical
structures are likely to escape detection. Moreover, coexpressed gene groups with a peak in one tissue only are
unresolved for single cell types. Low coverage of motifs in
such clusters may reflect contaminating genes that derive
from another cell type.
The Affymetrix technology that were used to generate the
expression measurements has been validated and match
results obtained with tag sampling for sufficiently abundant genes [45,46]. Low intensity signals did not correlate
well, indicating that such genes are less likely to form clusters (data not shown). Cross hybridization between
related genes may, in theory, contribute to correlating
expression levels. We can exclude that clusters primarily
form as a result of cross-hybridization, since (1) members
of well-characterized gene families appear in different (the
expected) clusters (eg smooth muscle and cardiac actins)
and since (2) co-expressed genes tended to share GO
terms or to encode interacting proteins to a higher degree
than they tended to be paralogs (supplementary data,
additional file 1). We cannot however exclude subtle
effects related to cross-hybridization, since results with
cDNA microarrays indicate this possibility [47].
Transcription factors in the same family often have similar
DNA binding properties and bind to the same sites on target genes. This leads to an ambiguity in the interpretation
of PFM annotations. The MEF2 motif, is for example a
receptor for the mammalian MEF2A, MEF2B, MEFC and
MEFD transcription factors [48]. Similarly, the E2F motif
is a receptor for a family of 9 E2F family proteins that form
heterodimers with another family of proteins, the DP proteins, in a way that affects the binding affinity [49]. Different E2F proteins act at different stages in the cell cycle
[50], and this is not captured by our method.
One additional data limitation is that a fraction of
Ensembl transcripts may lack sequence in their 5' ends.
The accuracy of our transcription starts is therefore
dependent on the quality of the Ensembl transcript
database.
Method considerations and perspectives
Our approach is technically related to the Toucan and
ConFac tools [17,51]. Important differences and extensions are the introduction of a composite scoring system,
a procedure to optimize PFM thresholds, and the use of
simulation at the level of the whole clustering to measure
significances.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/68

and clustering of such genes is clearly not a significant
source of false positive motif prediction. Consequently,
we decided to include the paralogs in the final analysis
since we believe that co-expression of such genes may be
a result of shared cis-regulatory elements.
We further evaluated the effects of using different DNA
amounts in the analysis. In principal, it is motivated to
include a substantial amount of DNA sequence per gene,
since mammalian enhancers are frequently located far
upstream in relation to the transcription start, or downstream in intronic DNA. However, the benefits of including as much sequence as possible must be balanced
against the risk of introducing vast amounts of noninformative sequence into the analysis. The evaluation
clearly favoured using limited amounts of DNA, and high
stringency phylogenetic footprinting (Figure 9C). The
optimal future alternative may be to assemble a small
amount of DNA from a large area of the genome using
algorithms that sort out regulatory DNA regions more efficient than phylogenetic footprinting.
The approach presented here needs to be extended to generate more complete models of gene battery regulation.
Modelling of cis-regulatory element combinations and the
relative position and spacing of elements are examples of
such extensions. The use of PCC as a measure of coexpression may need to be reconsidered if extending the
approach to very large datasets, since this measure may be
sensitive to noninformative signals in a majority of samples. Further, the expression levels of potential trans-regulators and co-factors (based on protein interaction
networks) can be introduced. Most likely, the method will
benefit from a more accurate identification of regulatory
regions (Crawford-04)

Conclusion
We screened the mouse and human genomes and transcriptomes for instances of gene battery-like regulation.
Comparative clustering was highly predictive of gene
function and protein interaction, which indicates that
potential gene batteries could be identified this way.
Based on a statistical composite score for motifs in
ortholog pairs, and a simulation approach to determine
significance levels, we found 21 instances of statistically
supported gene battery-like regulation that were conserved between mouse and human. These included
known cases of gene battery regulation in tissues such as
muscle, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and liver. A second
category of predictions included regulators with some
degree of documentation, e.g. in testis, kidney, and endoplasmatic reticulum. Finally, new candidate gene batteries
with statistically enriched cis-regulatory motifs were listed.

The performance of the method was not affected by the
removal of paralogous genes from the clusters (Figure 9B),

The results of this investigation emphasizes the need to
study differentiation in terms of larger transcriptional
units, and extends the methodology for doing this.

Methods
Annotation and preprocessing of gene expression datasets
Target sequences for the Novartis Gene Atlas V2 mouse
and human expression datasets [23] were matched against
the Ensembl [20] collection of mouse and human transcripts using BLAST [52]. In cases where the E-value
exceeded 10-20, the BLAST search was re-done against
Ensembl gene sequences. If there was no match below 1020, the probe set was excluded from further analysis. The
resulting datasets covered 17552 mouse and 16929
human unique Ensembl genes (Table 1). Mouse/human
orthologous gene pairs were formed using Ensembl
homology maps. Redundant occurrences of the same gene
in more than one ortholog pair were avoided according to
the following procedure: the Ensembl human orthologs
for each Ensembl mouse gene were identified. When more
than one ortholog was assigned to a mouse gene, the one
with the lowest positional disagreement d (defined
below) was chosen. The procedure was repeated for all
Ensembl human genes. Reciprocally matching ortholog
pairs were identified, and others were excluded from further analysis. The mouse and human expression profiles
of each ortholog pair were normalized with respect to
mean and standard deviation and combined into a single
larger profile, finally yielding an expression dataset with
13282 non-redundant ortholog pairs (Table 1).
Preparation of upstream DNA sequence
For each ortholog pair, mouse and human candidate regulatory sequence was extracted from Ensembl. The
sequence extraction algorithm starts with an ortholog
pair, localizes the 5' end of the transcript in the genome in
each species, and computes a value that measures the
positional disagreement between the transcript 5' ends in
the two species. If the disagreement is too large, the
ortholog pair is excluded from the analysis. Of the 12239
ortholog pairs in the expression dataset, 9561 satisfied
this criterion (Table 1). A full description of the sequence
extraction procedure is available in the online
supplement.

Three different lengths of DNA were extracted: 2 kb, 6 kb
and 15 kb. The 2 kb dataset contained nucleotide positions ranging from -2000 to -1 relative to the transcription
start, the 6 kb dataset contained positions -4000 to +2000
and the 15 k dataset contained positions -10000 to
+5000.
Phylogenetic footprinting
The sequence datasets were subjected to phylogenetic
footprinting, i.e. removal of poorly conserved sequence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/68

The mouse and human sequences of each ortholog pair
were aligned by use of the LAGAN software [53] (standard
settings). Similarity was defined as the number of identical nucleotides in a 20 bp window. Nucleotides in
windows with similarity below the threshold were
removed. In all, five different similarity threshold were
applied: >0% (no footprinting – use all sequence), >60%,
>70%, >80% and >90% identity.
Removal of exonic sequence
Each candidate regulatory sequence was aligned to the
corresponding transcripts (pairwise BLAST, e-value
threshold 0.01). Nucleotides aligning with one or more
transcripts were removed.
Clustering
The set of 9561 orthologs pairs, for which both regulatory
sequence and expression data could be assembled, were
clustered with respect to expression pattern using hierarchical clustering [54] with average group linkage and
Pearson's correlation coefficient as distance measure. In
the average group linkage algorithm, cluster distances are
defined as the distances between cluster means. We
defined the cluster mean as the arithmetic mean of all
cluster members. Correlation thresholds between 0.61
and 0.99 were applied in steps of 0.01.
Assembly of 266 non-redundant motif position weight
matrices
Motifs represented as position frequency matrices (PFMs)
were downloaded from the TRANSFAC [55] and JASPAR
[25] databases. Non-vertebrate matrices were filtered out.
Highly similar matrices were grouped and merged using
single linkage hierarchical clustering, reducing the
number of PFMs from 322 to 266. Distances between
matrices were calculated using a probabilistic method
[56]. Individual positions between matrices were
compared using the chi square test, and p-values for all
overlapping positions were combined using the geometric
mean. Sense and antisense of motifs were compared for
all possible frameshifts with at least 75% overlap. Clustered motifs (score > 0.5) were added together in overlapping positions, and flanking positions were discarded.
PFMs were transformed into position weight matrices
(PWM:s) to make them compatible with the MAST software (see below). The value of each matrix element was
calculated according to the following formula:

n + N /4
N+ N
log 2
p(b)
where n is the raw count from the corresponding position
in the PFM, N is the the number of observations (sum of
each position/column in the PFM),

N /4 and

N are

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:68

pseudocounts and p(b) is the background frequency of the
corresponding nucleotide.
Scoring of regulatory sequences for motif position weight
matrices
Scoring of individual sequences
For each ortholog pair, both mouse and human regulatory sequences were scored for all motif PWM's using the
MAST software [57]. MAST was set to compute wholesequence p-values (-seqp setting), using a first order
Markov chain background. The Markov chain background
data where computed from unmasked genomic sequence
-4000 upstream to +2000 downstream in all ortholog
pairs.
MAST composite scores
The p-values reported by MAST for the mouse and human
sequences of an ortholog pair were multiplied for each
PWM. The result was treated as a composite score that
reflects the overall "signal" for a certain binding site in the
regulatory sequences of an ortholog pair. The composite
score is a product of two p-values but should not be
interpreted as a p-value, since the mouse and human
sequences are highly dependent.
Algorithms to detect over-representation of GO terms and
motifs
GO over-representation
Clusters were evaluated for over-representation of GO
terms using Fisher's exact test [30]. Due to the large
number of tests (the number of clusters times the number
of GO terms), the resulting p-values were corrected using
the Bonferroni method [30].
Motif over-representation
The test was applied to the 9561 ortholog pairs with both
sequence and expression data. These constituted the population. For each PWM, genes with MAST composite scores
below a threshold were defined as labeled and the others
as unlabeled. Further, each cluster was considered as a sample from the population. The algorithm is briefly sketched
here and is available in detail in the online supplement:
Step 1: Compute p-scores under the null hypothesis
First, ortholog pairs were permuted across the dataset,
making each cluster a random selection of genes. Second,
an optimal composite score threshold was found for each
PWM. This was done by computing the Fischer test pvalue for over-representation of labeled ortholog pairs for
all clusters k at a range of detection thresholds ranging
from 10-8 to 10-3 in stepwise increases by a factor of 100.5.
The threshold chosen for each PWM was the one that gave
the best p-value for that PWM in any cluster. P-values for
over-representation of all motifs in all clusters were finally
calculated using the optimized thresholds. We refer to this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/68

statistic as the p-score. This whole procedure was repeated
for 100 iterations, which resulted in empirical estimates of
how many over-represented motifs we could expect below
a certain p-score under the null hypothesis.
Step 2: Compute p-scores for the observed data
This step was identical to step 1 but without permutations
and repetitions.
Step 3. Compute the false discovery rate
After the simulation, we defined the false discovery rate
(FDR) at p-score p as the expected number of over-represented motifs in the null simulation, divided by the corresponding value in the observed data.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
40-EI and 230–238 cells were grown in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM pyruvate, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol and 50 µg gentamicin per
ml (complete RPMI media). STAT activation in 230–238
cells was achieved by 5 hours of incubation with 0.5 ng/
ml
recombinant
mouse
interferon
gamma
(Immunokontact, Germany). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. [58]. DNA probes were
labelled with γ[32P] ATP (Amersham Biosciences, UK) by
incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and purified on a mini
Quick Spin Oligo Column (Roche Diagnostics, Sweden).
Nuclear extracts were incubated with labelled probe
(20,000 cpm, 3 fmol) for 30 min at room temperature in
binding buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 70 mM KCl, 1
mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 4%
Glycerol) with 0.75 µg Poly(dI/dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). When EBF-binding was investigated, 1
mM ZnCl2 was supplemented to the mixture. The samples
were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel, which
was dried and subjected to autoradiography. In the
supershift experiments (Figure 8B), DNA competitors or
antibodies (anti-EBF SC-15333, anti-Actin SC-1616, Santa
Cruz Biotech) were added 10 min before the addition of
the DNA probe. To visualize the super-shifted complex,
the unbound probe was run out of the gel. The following
Oligonucleotides were used for EMSA: mb-1 sense: 5'AGCCACCTCTCAGGGGAATTGTGG-3'; mb-1 antisense:
5'-CCACAATTCCCCTGAGAGGTGGCT-3'; mutated mb1sense:
5'-AGCCACCTCTCAGCCGTTTTGTGG-3';
mutated mb-1 antisense: 5'-CCACAAAACGGCTGAGAGGTGGCT-3';
