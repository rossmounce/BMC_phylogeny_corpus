Frequent gene conversion events between the
X and Y homologous chromosomal regions in
primates

Abstract
Background: Mammalian sex-chromosomes originated from a pair of autosomes. A step-wise cessation of
recombination is necessary for the proper maintenance of sex-determination and, consequently, generates a four
strata structure on the X chromosome. Each stratum shows a specific per-site nucleotide sequence difference
(p-distance) between the X and Y chromosomes, depending on the time of recombination arrest. Stratum 4 covers
the distal half of the human X chromosome short arm and the p-distance of the stratum is ~10%, on average.
However, a 100-kb region, which includes KALX and VCX, in the middle of stratum 4 shows a significantly lower
p-distance (1-5%), suggesting frequent sequence exchanges or gene conversions between the X and Y
chromosomes in humans. To examine the evolutionary mechanism for this low p-distance region, sequences of a
corresponding region including KALX/Y from seven species of non-human primates were analyzed.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of this low p-distance region in humans and non-human primate species revealed
that gene conversion like events have taken place at least ten times after the divergence of New World monkeys
and Catarrhini (i.e., Old World monkeys and hominoids). A KALY-converted KALX allele in white-handed gibbons
also suggests a possible recent gene conversion between the X and Y chromosomes. In these primate sequences,
the proximal boundary of this low p-distance region is located in a LINE element shared between the X and Y
chromosomes, suggesting the involvement of this element in frequent gene conversions. Together with a
palindrome on the Y chromosome, a segmental palindrome structure on the X chromosome at the distal
boundary near VCX, in humans and chimpanzees, may mediate frequent sequence exchanges between X and Y
chromosomes.
Conclusion: Gene conversion events between the X and Y homologous regions have been suggested, mainly in
humans. Here, we found frequent gene conversions in the evolutionary course of primates. An insertion of a LINE
element at the proximal end of the region may be a cause for these frequent conversions. This gene conversion in
humans may also be one of the genetic causes of Kallmann syndrome.

Background
The mammalian sex chromosomes (X and Y chromosomes) differentiated from a pair of autosomes (protosex chromosomes) more than 200 million years (myr)
ago, before the divergence of monotremes from other
mammals [1,2]. The physiological and biological differentiation of proto-sex chromosomes began with the
emergence of two or more sex-determining genes,

including SRY (sex-determining region on Y) and RBMY
(RNA binding motif protein, Y-linked), on one of the
proto-sex chromosomes, the proto-Y chromosome. The
tight linkage of sex-determining genes on the proto-Y
chromosome is required for normal development of
male characters or male determination [3], and the suppression of homologous recombination produced the
tight linkage of male-sex-determining genes on the
proto-Y chromosome. Through suppression of homologous recombination, nucleotide substitutions accumulated on each chromosome, leading to the emergence of
X- and Y-specific regions on each sex chromosome.

Eventually, the increased divergence between the X and
Y chromosomes led to a complete cessation of recombination between them, leading to the rapid degradation
of the Y chromosome. This degradation arises primarily
from the loss of a mechanism that avoids the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the Y chromosome
[4,5].
Lahn and Page [6] first proposed a scenario to explain
the process of sex chromosome differentiation. The
extent of nucleotide divergence per synonymous site
(K S ) for 19 X-Y pairs of genes in humans or squirrel
monkeys varied greatly from 0.05 at ARSE/ARSEP to
1.25 at SRY/SOX3. In addition, the KS of the 19 pairs
decreased with position on the X chromosome from the
long arm tip to the short arm tip. Based on this variation, the 19 pairs were classified into four distinct categories, or strata. Stratum 1 contains three genes with KS
> 0.9, stratum 2 contains two genes with KS of approximately 0.5, and strata 3 and 4 comprise seven genes
with K S = ~0.2, and K S = ~0.1, respectively. The K S
values in strata 1 and 2 suggest that recombination
between X and Y chromosomes ceased before the divergence of monotremes from other mammals for stratum
1, and before the divergence of marsupials and eutherian
mammals for stratum 2. The observed KS values of ~0.2
and ~0.1 also suggest that stratum 3 formed before the
mammalian divergence and that stratum 4 formed in
the primate lineage after the divergence of prosimian
and simian primates. To confirm whether this step-wise
divergence between X and Y chromosomes is observed
in other non-coding regions on the X and Y chromosomes, Iwase et al. [7] compared nucleotide sequences
in the distal half of the short arm of the human X chromosome with a homologous region on the Y chromosome. This analysis revealed a step-wise change in the
p-distances and confirmed the scenario of sex chromosome differentiation proposed by Lahn and Page [6].
However, some p-distances within stratum 4, where the
p-distance is ~0.1 on average, were significantly lower
(0.01~0.05) (Additional file 1) [7]. This low p-distance
region has been reported independently in other studies
[8]. The region is ~100 kb long and encompasses the
KALX to VCX2 genes in humans (Additional file 1). The
cause for this low p-distance has been argued to be gene
conversion [8].
KALX, which is one of the genes responsible for Kallmann syndrome [9-12], is located on the X chromosome, and is composed of 14 exons, encompassing a
210-kb region. The gene encodes an extracellular matrix
glycoprotein of ~100 kDa which is called anosmin-1 and
is expressed in the kidneys and in multiple embryonic
tissues [9,13,14]. Anosmin-1 is conserved in a wide
range of animals, from nematodes to humans [14-17]
suggesting the functional importance of the protein. A

deletion in or of the KALX gene results in an X-linked
recessive form of Kallmann syndrome, whose typical
symptoms are anosmia, small genitalia, and sterility. The
defective gene product prevents the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and olfactory neurons to the hypothalamus [17-21]. A homolog
of KALX, KALY, is located on the long arm of the Y
chromosome, but because of deletions and nonsense
mutations the gene is a pseudogene [22,23]. Since KALX
and KALY are in the middle of stratum 4, the two genes
began to differentiate after simian primates diverged
from prosimians [6].
VCX and VCY form a relatively small gene family,
with four members of VCX and two of VCY being identified in humans. Each member of the VCX gene family
has three or four exons and is 1320 ~1880 bp in length,
whereas VCY genes have two exons and are 742 bp
long. All members of VCX and VCY are expressed
exclusively in male germ cells [24]. VCX and VCY
sequences show a high degree of sequence similarity
within each gene family as well as between genes on the
X and Y chromosomes [25]. Sequence identity within
VCY is due to frequent gene conversion between palindrome arms [26,27].
The purpose of this study was to examine the evolutionary mechanism that produces the low p-distance
region within stratum 4 in non-human primates. To this
end, we compared nucleotide sequences of corresponding regions between X and Y chromosomes of several
primates. The analysis showed that relatively frequent
gene conversions between the X and Y chromosomes
have occurred independently in each of the primate
lineages. This frequent gene conversion is argued to be
a result of genomic structure, such as repetitive elements at the boundary of the region.

Results
Comparison of genome sequences reveals low p-values
in stratum 4

Window analysis of p-distances between X and Y chromosomes in chimpanzees shows a low p-distance region
on the X chromosome that corresponds to a similar low
p-distance region on the X-chromosome in humans.
With the exception of the centromeric region containing
KALX or KALY (Additional file 1), the corresponding
regions show similar p-distances in the two species. The
sub-region values are ~10 kb with p = 0.05, ~5 kb with
p = 0.10, and ~70 kb with p = 0.05, and the boundaries
of the chimpanzee sub-regions are almost identical to
those in humans (Additional file 1). A part of the KAL
coding region, however, differs between the two species.
In chimpanzees, a region covering the middle of intron
9 to the 3’ flanking region of KALX shows a divergence
with KALY of p = 0.05. An adjacent region shows an

identical nucleotide sequence (p = 0), whereas the corresponding regions in humans have values of p = 0.01 and
0.05, respectively (Figure 1B, Additional file 1). It should
be noted that the boundaries of the above two subregions differ between the two species (Figure 1B). In
addition, the organization of the KALY gene (Figure 1A)
also differs between the two species: human KALY has a
large deletion containing introns 7 to 9, whereas chimpanzee KALY retains all exons and introns, with the
exception of exon 3, which is also deleted in human
KALY.
The entire rhesus monkey KALY is not available from
data obtained in the present study or sequence databases, but the available KALY sequence shows a deletion
from intron 9 to 11 (Figure 1A). In the 50 kb sequence
obtained in the present study the p-distance between
KALY and KALX is ~0.10, while in a 1.5 kb region
including exon 14 and the 3’ flanking region the value is
~0.01 (Figure 1B). We also found an inversion on the X
chromosome from intron 6 to exon 8 with a length of

~3.5 kb in rhesus monkeys. The low p-distance region
in rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans shows
some species-specific patterns of p values, suggesting
that the timing of gene conversion between X and Y
chromosomes is species-specific in each of the lineages
leading to the three species.
Gene conversion in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus
monkeys

The formation of a low p-distance region in the middle
of stratum 4 is likely due to gene conversion between
the X and Y chromosomes. Therefore, we examined
how often and where in the KAL genes these conversions occurred. First, to determine the position of the
most recent conversion between KALX and KALY in
humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys, we examined the boundary of the low p-distance region by phylogenetic analysis. We constructed 50 phylogenetic trees
for 2 kb-fragment windows with a sliding overlap of 1
kb. Based on the topologies of these trees, the KAL coding region was classified into two sub-regions: one
encompassing exons 5 to 7 (Region A in Figure 1, Figure 2A) and the other encompassing exons 12 to 14
(Region B in Figure 1, Figure 2B). The region from
intron 7 to 11 was not included in the analysis because
of independent deletions in the KALY gene of humans
and rhesus monkeys. The phylogenetic trees of Region
A show the history of stratum 4. Recombination
between X and Y chromosomes ceased before the divergence of Old World monkeys and hominoids (apes and
humans) and no further exchanges occurred. Therefore,
sequences from the three primates show the reciprocal
monophyly of KALX and KALY. In contrast, Region B
shows rather species-specific clustering, suggesting independent gene conversion in these species.
Second, to determine the timing of the most recent
conversion in these lineages, the per-site nucleotide
divergence (d) on the branches leading to the X and Y
chromosome sequences in Regions A and B were calculated. Since the nucleotide substitution rates of the X
and Y chromosomal genes differ [28], d values on the X
and Y chromosomes are estimated separately on the
tree (Figure 2A and 2B). The average d value on the
lineage leading to KALX (dX) and KALY (dY) in rhesus
monkeys and hominoids from a common ancestor of
these species is given by dX = 0.023 ± 0.007 and dY =
0.041 ± 0.006 for Region A, and dX = 0.023 ± 0.003 and
dY = 0.046 ± 0.001 for Region B. The values of dX and
dY in Region A are similar to those in Region B. This is
consistent with the gene conversion that does not affect
species divergence. The divergence re-estimated using
both sequences in Regions A and B gives dX = 0.023 ±
0.005 and dY = 0.044 ± 0.005. Assuming a divergence
time between rhesus monkeys and hominoids of 30 myr

Figure 2 The phylogeny of Regions A and B of KALX and KALY in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys. The phylogenetic trees
for both Region A and Region B are based on p-distances. The numbers of sites used for constructing the tree are indicated at the bottom
right of each tree. An open diamond at a node indicates KALX and KALY differentiation, and the number at the node is the bootstrap value in
500 replications. Filled diamonds indicate gene conversion events. The branch lengths are shown below each branch. A scale bar for the pdistance is indicated at the bottom left of the tree. Sequences on the X and Y chromosome are represented by bold and regular fonts,
respectively.

[29], the average substitution rate of KALX and KALY is
0.78 ± 0.18 × 10-9 and 1.45 ± 0.17 × 10-9 per site per
year, respectively. Based on these substitution rates, the
timing of gene conversion in Region B for rhesus monkey X and Y chromosomes was estimated to be 17~28
myr ago and that for hominoids was 19~24 myr ago
(Figure 2A and 2B). Gene conversion between the X
and Y chromosomes could also be observed in other
hominoid species, such as gorillas and gibbons.
Gene conversion in other primate species

To test whether gene conversion can be observed in
other primates, specifically gorillas, gibbons, New World
monkeys, and ring-tailed lemurs, the chromosomal positions of KALX and KALY in the genomes of these primates were confirmed by FISH with DAPI (4,6diaminido-2-phenylidole) staining of the chromosomes.
A single copy of KAL was detected on the X and Y
chromosomes of each species, with the exception of
lemurs (Additional file 2). The observation is consistent
with the origin of stratum 4 in simian primates. We
sequenced the low p-distance 7 kb region, encompassing
exon 10 to exon 14 of the KALX and KALY genes from
gorillas and gibbons. However, KALY gene sequences
were not available for ring-tailed lemurs or New World
monkeys. Based on the obtained sequences, phylogenetic
trees were constructed separately for Regions A and B
using the ring-tailed lemur KALX as the out-group
(Additional file 3) in both trees. The phylogenetic tree

of Region A shows again a typical topology of stratum
4: recombination between X and Y halted after the
divergence of prosimian and simian primates, producing
the reciprocal monophyly of KALX and KALY of simian
primates. In Region B, in contrast, the clusters were
taxon-specific. This result suggests that multiple gene
conversions occurred in Region B, at least three times;
once in the common ancestor of chimpanzees, gorillas
and humans, once in an ancestor of gibbons, and once
in the lineage of rhesus monkeys. In addition, New
World monkey KALX appears as an out-group of Catarrhini (Old World monkeys and hominoids) KALX and
KALY, reflecting an ancient gene conversion between X
and Y in the stem lineage of Catarrhini.
To understand whether or not there are hot spots of
conversion in the B region, we analyzed the 7 kb region
in detail. We investigated a total of 20 NJ trees with a
sliding window width of 500 bp and an overlap of 100
bp for the B region. Based on the topologies of the 20
trees, the B region was further classified into seven subregions, each of which shows signatures of gene conversion (Figure 3). Region I shows at least three conversion
events: one in gibbons, another in the stem lineage leading to humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, and the third
in humans. Similarly, conversions occurred twice in
Region II, once in Region III and in Region IV, twice in
Region VI, and once in Region VII. In total, at least 10
gene conversions were detected. However, no conversion has occurred in the A region since the divergence

window of 500-bp with a 100-bp overlap. In total, 20 trees were obtained. These trees were divided into seven groups by topology. Trees for
the seven sub-regions are indicated. Filled diamonds indicate gene conversion events. The number inside the diamond indicates the conversion
event given in Figure 6. Sequences on the X and Y chromosome are represented by bold and regular fonts, respectively.

of Catarrhini from New World monkeys. These observations strongly imply that the entire B region is prone to
gene conversion and that some factors that enhance
gene conversion may be present at the boundary
between the A and B regions.
Gene conversion between KALX and KALY in whitehanded gibbons

Numerous (at least ten) independent inter-chromosomal
gene conversions between KALX and KALY have
occurred during primate evolution. The direction of
gene conversion was inferred from the phylogenetic analysis. Among the conversions, five were from KALY to
KALX and the remaining five were in the opposite
direction. We also identified an example of ongoing
gene conversion from Y to X chromosomes in whitehanded gibbons. The alignment of four KALX and two
KALY sequences from four (two females and two males)
white-handed gibbons (Figure 4) indicates that the 70
bp sequence starting from the end of exon 10 in one of
the KALX alleles (white-handed gibbon 2845FX) is identical to a KALY sequence (white-handed gibbon 2846
MY). Since these KALX and KALY sequences differ by
eight substitutions, it is unlikely that all eight substitutions are the result of recurrent substitutions on a particular region of the KALX allele sequence. This
observation is likely an example of a recent gene conversion in this region in a non-human primate.
Repetitive elements in the region

To infer the molecular mechanism for the frequent gene
conversions in the B region, repetitive sequences such as
LINE, SINE, and simple repeats, which are known to be
involved in sequence exchanges, were searched for at the
boundary of the low p-distance region of humans,

Page 6 of 11

chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys. LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons represent at least 17% of the human genome
[30], and the number of these elements in the low p-distance region does not differ from the average over the
entire lengths of the X and Y chromosomes. KALX and
KALY, however, share L1 elements (about 3 kb) near the
boundary (Figure 1A) of the low p-distance region in
intron 9, although human KALY lacks the LINE due to a
large deletion encompassing introns 7 to 9.
The LINE element shared among primate KALX and
KALY has been annotated as LINE3A. This LINE element
is likely to have been inserted before the formation of
stratum 4, and it has been a breakpoint for gene conversion. An alignment and phylogenetic analyses of the
LINE3A sequences revealed the boundary between
Regions A and B was located in the sequence and the
phylogeny of LINE3A showed a reciprocal monophyly in
the 5’ half of the X and Y sequences but a species-specific
clustering in the 3’ half of the X and Y sequences (Figure
5). This data suggests the occurrence of at least two independent gene conversions (one in rhesus monkeys and
the other in hominoids) in a similar position in LINE3A.
VCX and VCY

The low p-distance region in stratum 4 ranges from
KALX to VCX2 in human and chimpanzee sequences
(Additional file 1). Frequent gene conversions between
paralogs on the same chromosome are well known
among the VCX and VCY genes. In particular, gene
conversion between VCY genes is due to the P8 palindrome in humans and chimpanzees [26]. In contrast to
KAL sequences, VCY sequences are only available
for humans and chimpanzees. This lack makes it very
difficult to infer inter-chromosomal gene conversions
between VCX and VCY in non-human and non-

chimpanzee primates. The most recent gene conversions between VCX and VCY in humans and chimpanzees are estimated to be 4.2 ± 1.4 and 6.9 ± 1.5 myr
ago, respectively (Additional file 4). We identified four
VCX sequences in the New world monkey genome
(data not shown), although no one-to-one orthologous
relationship with the four human VCX sequences was
detected, suggesting species-specific gene duplications
or frequent gene conversions within the VCX genes on
the X chromosome in New world monkey.

Discussion
Repetitive sequences in the converted region

Gene conversion is an event in genetic recombination that
occurs at high frequencies not only in germ cells through
meiotic division but also in somatic cells through mitosis.
Recombination occurs between molecules possessing similar nucleotide sequences and is a common repair mechanism for nucleotide lesions in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. Recombination is initiated by a double-strand
break in one gene followed by the repair of this gene by
copying the sequence of a similar gene. In the process of
this repair, a “Holliday structure” is constructed and
depending on the resolution of this structure, the result is
called either gene conversion or crossing over [31,32].
However, it is still not clear whether gene conversion
between paralogs on the same or different chromosomes
proceeds by the same mechanism.
An L1 element may play an important role in the
repair process. Although the mechanism is not yet well
defined, double-strand breaks at chromosomal LINE elements can be repaired by gene conversion with another

LINE element in cis or trans [33]. Such conversion is
often responsible for disease-causing genetic rearrangements [34,35]. In fact, Han et al. [36] identified 73 cases
of human-specific deletions associated with recombination between L1 elements that have resulted in an
approximately 0.5 Mb reduction in the amount of
human DNA within the past few million years.
In the present study, we identified a LINE element at
the boundary of the low p-distance region and found
that the boundary was located within this LINE element
(Figure 4). Further, we observed frequent deletions in
the primate Y chromosome in the low p-distance region.
These observations provide evidence of the significant
role of repetitive elements, such as a LINE, as a source
of instability in the region.
At the telomeric end, in contrast, we found a truncated or segmented palindrome, which included three of
the four VCX members. This palindrome on the X chromosome has a relatively long loop and short arms.
Palindrome arms, which contain VCX gene family
sequences, may have facilitated frequent exchanges with
palindrome arms on the Y chromosome [25].
History of KALs and Kallmann syndrome

A sizeable body of evidence has accumulated to show
that, although gene conversion has been an important
driving force in human genome evolution, it can also be
a cause of inherited diseases [37].
Identical KALX and KALY sequences were located on
a pair of ancestral chromosomes before the cessation of
recombination in stratum 4 (Figure 6). Both KALX and
KALY were subjected to mutations following the

Figure 6 History of gene conversion in the X and Y homologous chromosomal region. The hypothesized scenario for KAL gene evolution
in primates is presented. Before the divergence of Platypus from mammals, the differentiation of sex chromosomes was initiated. After the
divergence of prosimian from simian primates, stratum 4 was formed and the differentiation of KALX and KALY started. There were numerous,
independent gene-conversion-like events (at least 10) during the evolution of primates, as indicated by the red stars. The arrows show the
direction of conversion. The number in each red star corresponds to the conversion event identified in Figure 3.

establishment of stratum 4. However, selection pressure
removed deleterious mutations from KALX, whereas
mutations accumulated on KALY which subsequently
became a pseudogene. Later, frequent gene conversions
resulted in partial homogenization between KALX and
KALY, resulting in a reduced number of nucleotide differences between the two genes.
Since KALY is a pseudogene and KALX is functional,
the direction of genetic exchange should be mostly from
KALX to KALY. Gene conversion from KALY to KALX
can potentially destroy the functional KALX gene, resulting in Kallmann syndrome. Thus, the conversion from Y
to X chromosome after the formation of stratum 4 could
lead to Kallmann syndrome. In primate evolution, gene
conversion from KALY to KALX actually occurred as frequently as that from KALX to KALY (Figure 6). Guioli et
al. [38] proposed that exon 14 in KALX was replaced
homologous segment in KALY. This replacement would
result in the loss of function in authentic KALX and
cause the syndrome, suggesting that the translocation of
KALY onto the X chromosome may be the cause of this
replacement. However, the authors did not examine
sequences downstream of exon 14 or whether the KALX
in individuals with Kallmann syndrome is the result of a
translocation or the result of gene conversion. The present study raises the possibility that the novel molecular
characteristics may indeed affect KALX function.

Conclusions
Genomic sequence analysis revealed a low p-distance
region in the middle of stratum 4 on the X chromosome
of primates. This low p-distance was probably caused by
ectopic gene conversion in the course of primate evolution and was independently observed in several primate
species. Phylogenetic studies of the region revealed at
least ten gene conversions within a relatively small ~10
kb region, suggesting the presence of a hot spot for conversions. The examination of primate genome structures
reveals the presence of structures that may enhance
conversion in the region: large repetitive elements at the
centromeric end and a segmented palindrome at the
telomeric boundary of this region. This conversion may
be one of the causes of Kallmann syndrome.

and X68770.
PCR was performed in reaction volumes of 20 μl using
20 pmol of each primer, 100 ng of genomic DNA, 10
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 200
μM dNTPs, and 2.5 U ExTaq DNA polymerase
(TaKaRa). Amplifications were carried out using a RoboCycler Gradient 96 instrument (Stratagene) with the following standard conditions: denaturation at 95°C for 3
min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 56-62°C
for 30 sec and 72°C for 6 min, and a final extension at
72°C for 10 min. For rhesus monkeys, we used LA
ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) to amplify long fragments (>10 kb) with PCR conditions of denaturation at
95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min,
56-62°C for 1 min and 69°C for 6 min, and a final
extension at 69°C for 10 min. These PCR conditions
were modified slightly for some primer sets.
All PCR products were purified using a QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN). Some products were
directly sequenced while others were cloned into pCRKL-TOPO using a TOPO XL Cloning kit (Invitrogen).
Plasmid DNA was purified with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep column (QIAGEN) and used as the template for
sequencing reactions. We used the GeneJumper Primer
Insertion Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen) the long rhesus monkey gene sequences.
Sequencing reactions were performed using an ABI
Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready
Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on an ABI
PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Sequences for each sample were confirmed by means of
independent PCR and subsequent sequencing. To avoid
sequencing errors, PCR products or plasmid DNA fragments were sequenced at least twice in both directions.
The sequence fragments were assembled by DNASIS (Hitachi) and deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ).
Data Analysis

We obtained 3 kb (exon 5 to 6) and 6 kb (exon 10 to 14)
genomic sequences of KALX and KALY from chimpanzees, gorillas, agile gibbons, white-handed gibbons, squirrel
monkeys, and ring-tailed lemurs. For rhesus monkeys, we
obtained ~50 kb fragments containing exons 5 to 14 of
KALX and KALY. These rhesus monkey sequences were
used for phylogenetic analysis, together with human and
chimpanzee genomic orthologous sequences from GenBank. We detected homologous fragments using DOTTER
[39], made an alignment using CLUSTALW [40], and

adjusted the alignment manually (available upon request).
GenBank accession numbers of the sequences retrieved
from the database (GenBank) are given in Additional file 5.
We computed p-distances (the number of nucleotide
differences per site) for all pairwise comparisons of primate sequences. To perform the sliding window analyses of p-distances for these sequences, we used our
own FORTRAN program (available upon request). We
constructed phylogenetic trees using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [41] and/or the maximum parsimony
(MP) method [42] in MEGA4 [43]. The NJ tree was
based on p-distances in the complete-deletion option
and the reliability of the tree was assessed by bootstrap
test with 1,000 replications.
Chromosomal Locations of KALs

The chromosomal locations of KALX and KALY are
known in humans [22]. To map these loci on the chromosomes of chimpanzees, gibbons, rhesus monkeys,
squirrel monkeys, and ring-tailed lemurs, we conducted
FISH using species-specific KALX and KALY sequences.
Slide preparations of the chromosomes for chimpanzees
were made from phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral white blood cells. Chromosome preparations from
gibbons, squirrel monkeys and ring-tailed lemurs were
made with fibroblasts [44]. After incubating the slides for
a few days at 37°C, FISH was conducted using 200 ng
plasmid clones of the KAL sequences for each primate as
probes. These probes were labeled using a BioNick labeling kit containing biotin-14-dATP (Gibco BRL) [44].
Fluorescent signals were amplified using the sandwich
technique [45]. The FISH images were collected using a
CCD camera (Photometric) attached to an epifluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Carl Zeiss) and saved on a
computer (Macintosh 8500/120) with the IPLab imaging
software (Signal Analytics Corporation).

Additional material
Additional file 1: Window analysis of nucleotide differences (y-axis)
along the X chromosome. The position of the KALX and VCX exons are
indicated at the bottom of each graph. Each bar corresponds to a pdistance in a non-overlapping window of 500 bp. A low p-distance
region is indicated by the two-headed arrows. The region indicated by
the rectangle is enlarged in Figure 1B.
Additional file 2: FISH analysis using species-specific KALX and KALY
probes. FISH was carried out on metaphase chromosomes from human
(a, b, c and d), chimpanzee (e, f, g and h), and rhesus monkey (i, j, k and
l). The X (left: a, b, e, f, i. j) and Y (Right; c, d, g, h, k, l) chromosomes are
marked (arrowheads). Green fluorescence indicates a positive signal. A
short white bar marks the centromeric region (scale bar: 10 μm).
Additional file 3: The phylogenetic tree of region A and B of KALX
and KALY in several primates. The trees for Regions A and B are based
on p-distances. The numbers of sites are given at the bottom right of
each tree. A yellow diamond at the node indicates KALX and KALY
differentiation, and the number beside each node is the bootstrap
probability after 500 replications.
