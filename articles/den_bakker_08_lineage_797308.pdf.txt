Abstract
Background: The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is a saprotroph as well as an opportunistic human
foodborne pathogen, which has previously been shown to consist of at least two widespread lineages
(termed lineages I and II) and an uncommon lineage (lineage III). While some L. monocytogenes strains show
evidence for considerable diversification by homologous recombination, our understanding of the
contribution of recombination to L. monocytogenes evolution is still limited. We therefore used
STRUCTURE and ClonalFrame, two programs that model the effect of recombination, to make inferences
about the population structure and different aspects of the recombination process in L. monocytogenes.
Analyses were performed using sequences for seven loci (including the house-keeping genes gap, prs, purM
and ribC, the stress response gene sigB, and the virulence genes actA and inlA) for 195 L. monocytogenes
isolates.
Results: Sequence analyses with ClonalFrame and the Sawyer's test showed that recombination is more
prevalent in lineage II than lineage I and is most frequent in two house-keeping genes (ribC and purM) and
the two virulence genes (actA and inlA). The relative occurrence of recombination versus point mutation
is about six times higher in lineage II than in lineage I, which causes a higher genetic variability in lineage II.
Unlike lineage I, lineage II represents a genetically heterogeneous population with a relatively high
proportion (30% average) of genetic material imported from external sources. Phylograms, constructed
with correcting for recombination, as well as Tajima's D data suggest that both lineages I and II have
suffered a population bottleneck.
Conclusion: Our study shows that evolutionary lineages within a single bacterial species can differ
considerably in the relative contributions of recombination to genetic diversification. Accounting for
recombination in phylogenetic studies is critical, and new evolutionary models that account for the
possibility of changes in the rate of recombination would be required. While previous studies suggested
that only L. monocytogenes lineage I has experienced a recent bottleneck, our analyses clearly show that
lineage II experienced a bottleneck at about the same time, which was subsequently obscured by abundant
homologous recombination after the lineage II bottleneck. While lineage I and lineage II should be
considered separate species from an evolutionary viewpoint, maintaining single species name may be
warranted since both lineages cause the same type of human disease.

Background
Listeria monocytogenes is a common bacterium that can be
found in a large number of different natural and manmade habitats. While it is well adapted to a saprotrophic
lifestyle, it can cause severe invasive disease in humans
and a wide range of animals with manifestations including septicemia, encephalitis and late-term abortion.
Human listeriosis represents a foodborne infection that
predominantly affects the elderly, immunocompromised
individuals, and pregnant women [1]. Based on most
molecular subtyping methods, L. monocytogenes isolates
can be subdivided into three main lineages, termed lineages I, II, and III [2]. Lineage I strains are significantly
overrepresented among human listeriosis cases [3], while
lineage II strains have a higher prevalence among isolates
from environmental samples, foods, and animal listeriosis cases [2,4]. Lineage III strains are rare and mainly associated with animals [5]. Recent evidence suggests that
isolates originally classified into lineage III represent a
polyphyletic group [6] that includes at least three different
lineages (lineage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC), which all contain
serotype 4a, 4c, and atypical serotype 4b isolates.
Recombination plays an important role in the evolution
of most bacterial species [7-9] and has often been presented as the equivalent of sex in eukaryotes. It constitutes
a means for the rapid introduction of new genetic material
into the genome, thus providing a much more rapid mode
of evolution than point mutations [10,11]. Abundant
recombination has also been associated with increased
pathogenicity of selected bacterial strains [9]. Recombination poses a number of challenges for the evolutionary
biologist as it blurs species boundaries and hampers
proper inference reconstruction of the evolution of
recombining organisms. For example, a comparative
genomic study of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica
[12] demonstrated that certain regions of the genome can
be involved in inter-species recombination, even tens of
millions of years after divergence. Recombination does
not only violate the assumption of strict bifurcation of
most phylogenetic algorithms [13], but also makes it difficult to infer the mutation rate and the age of the most
recent common ancestor of groups of recombining organisms [14].
The goal of this study was to improve our understanding
of the evolution and population structure of L. monocytogenes, with a particular focus on the role of recombination in lineage I and II. As previous studies [2,15,16] have
suggested that there is a considerable amount of homologous recombination in the genome of at least some L.
monocytogenes, we used STRUCTURE [17] and ClonalFrame [14], two programs that model the effect of recombination in genetic diversification, to draw inferences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/277

about the population structure and different aspects of the
recombination process in L. monocytogenes.

Methods
L. monocytogenes isolates
Our study used multilocus sequence typing data for 195 L.
monocytogenes isolates. A total of 184 isolates had been
obtained from human clinical cases (n = 60), foods (n =
30) and animal clinical cases (n = 30) (as previously
described by Nightingale et al. [2]) as well as natural and
urban environments (n = 43) [4] and ruminants without
clinical symptoms and farm environments (n = 21) [18].
All of these isolates were obtained from sources within
New York State between 1999 and 2003. DNA sequences
for all but the 21 isolates from ruminants without clinical
symptoms and farm environments have previously been
reported [18]. All isolates had previously been characterized by automated ribotyping and classified into lineages
I, II, and III based on ribotype data. Because only four lineage III isolates were found among these 184 isolates we
also included sequence data for 11 additional lineage III
isolates representing lineage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC, for a total
of 195 isolates (see Additional file 1 for extra information). Only sigB and actA sequence data had previously
been reported for these 11 lineage III isolates [6]. Glycerol
stocks of the isolates stored at -80°C were revived on BHIagar plates and liquid cultures obtained from single colonies were used to make lysates.
Genes Sequenced and MLST analysis
Partial DNA sequences of seven genes including four
housekeeping genes (gap, prs, purM and ribC), two virulence genes (inlA and actA), and one stress response gene
(sigB) were used for our analyses; a detailed description of
the function of these genes and their position on the chromosome can be found in Nightingale et al. [2]. Sequencing of these seven loci for isolates without previously
reported sequence information was performed as detailed
by Nightingale et al. [2].

Assignment of sequence types (STs) and allelic types of
the individual genes was performed using DNAsp 4.10.9
[19] as detailed by Nightingale et al. [2]. Previously
reported STs and allelic types were numbered to be consistent with those reported by Nightingale et al. [2]; STs
and allelic types not previously encountered were given
new identification numbers. Isolate information and all
sequence data used in this study are available in Pathogen
Tracker http://www.pathogentracker.net. Sequences and
alignments have also been deposited in Genbank (actA

nr EU521211 to EU521394 and EU847062 to
EU847073).
Descriptive analysis of sequence data
DNAsp 4.10.9 [19] was used to calculate the average pairwise nucleotide difference per site (π), the average pairwise nucleotide difference per sequence (k), the number
of polymorphic sites, the number of mutations, the
number of alleles, the GC content, Tajima's D (test for
neutrality of the data [20]), the number of synonymous
and non-synonymous mutations, and the rate of non-synonymous to synonymous changes with a Jukes-Cantor
correction. All calculations were performed for all isolates,
and separately for the isolates belonging to lineages I and
II. Separate analyses were not performed for the lineage III
isolates due to the small number of isolates.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic relationships between the individual
sequence types were inferred using ClonalFrame v1.1
[14]. This software is based on a model of genetic diversification that accounts for the way recombination occurs in
bacterial populations. This enables the inference of phylogenetic relationships based on sequence data of multiple
MLST loci, even if they are partly incongruent due to
recombination. Besides the genealogy of the sample,
ClonalFrame also infers when and where recombination
events took place in the evolutionary history of the sample and estimates population-wide evolutionary parameters (e.g., mutation rate; recombination rate). Sequence
data of the 92 unique STs identified among the 195 isolates were input into ClonalFrame and default values were
used for all options. Five independent ClonalFrame runs
were performed, each consisting of 300,000 iterations.
The first 100,000 iterations in each run were discarded,
and the phylogeny and additional model parameters were
sampled every 100 generations in the last 200,000 iterations; thus, each run produced a sample of size 2,000
from the posterior. The convergence of the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) in the different runs was judged
satisfactory based on the Gelman-Rubin test [21] as
implemented in the ClonalFrame GUI, and using Tracer
v1.4 (available from A. Rambaut and A. J. Drummond at
http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/). The samples from the five different runs were then concatenated for further analysis,
resulting in a sample of size 10,000 from the posterior.
The genealogies for our sample population were summarized in two complementary ways: a 95% majority rule
consensus tree [22] constructed using the ClonalFrame
GUI, and a consensus network built using Splitstree [23].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/277

Recombination and recombination rate
Sawyer's test of recombination was performed using
GENECONV version 1.81a [24]. Analyses were performed
using separate alignments for each of the seven loci; alignments were constructed using one sequence for each
unique allelic type. The default settings for GENECONV
were used and the number of recombinant events was
inferred from the output as described in Nightingale et al.
[2].

Recombination events were also assessed using ClonalFrame v1.1, assuming that a posterior probability of import
above 95% is conclusive evidence for the occurrence of a
recombination event. The recombination rates within lineages I and II were also inferred using ClonalFrame v1.1.
For this purpose ClonalFrame was run independently
using separate data sets that only included STs that
grouped into lineage I and only the STs that grouped into
lineage II. Because these datasets are smaller than the
combined dataset for all lineages, we did not attempt to
jointly infer the values of the mutation rate (θ) and the
mean tract length of imported sequence fragments (δ).
Instead, we set δ equal to the mean value inferred by the
analyses of the whole dataset (δ = 122 bp), and we used
fixed mutation rates (θ) for the individual lineages (i.e., θ
= 91 for lineage I and θ = 60 for lineage II corresponding
to the average value of θ obtained from single runs with
300,000 iterations). Two complementary measures of the
recombination rate were calculated: ρ/θ which measures
the relative frequency of occurrence of recombination and
mutation in the history of the lineage [25], and r/m which
measures the relative impact of recombination and mutation in the genetic diversification of the lineage [26].
To assess the influence of recombination on the inference
of the phylogeny and particularly the branch lengths, five
individual ClonalFrame analyses (100,000 burn-in iterations plus 200,000 sampling iterations) were performed
without allowing for recombination (i.e., the recombination rate ρ was set equal to zero).
Population History
To infer the population history of lineage I and lineage II
we used the external/internal branch length ratio test [27]
as implemented in the ClonalFrame GUI. This test calculates the ratio of the sum of the external branches (the
ones that connect a leaf of the tree) to the sum of the internal branches for each tree in the posterior. The distribution of these ratios is than compared to the distribution of
the external/internal branch length ratio as expected
under the coalescent model [28]. If the distribution of this
ratio is significantly larger than expected this means that
the genealogy is unexpectedly 'star-like', which is consistent with a recent expansion of the effective population

size, either due to a population bottleneck or a selective
sweep.
STRUCTURE analysis
To infer the ancestry of the lineage I and lineage II STs in
our dataset, we performed an analysis using the linkage
model of the program STRUCTURE [17,29]. This software
assumes that the observed data is derived from K ancestral
subpopulations. In the linkage model, the observed
sequences are assumed to be made of blocks, each of
which is inherited from one of the ancestral subpopulations. The program therefore infers for each site of each
sequence its posterior probability of deriving from any of
the K ancestral subpopulations, and by averaging these
probabilities over all sites, we get the average proportion
of genetic material derived from each ancestral subpopulation by each individual. To estimate K (the number of
ancestral subpopulations), the probability of observing
the data given a certain value of K (Pr(X|K)) was calculated for values of K ranging from 1 to 10 (three replicates
per value of K). These values were estimated based on relatively short runs of STRUCTURE (20,000 burn-in iterations and 40,000 sampling iterations). STRUCTURE
calculates a heuristic estimate of Pr(X|K) after each individual analysis. The value of K that maximized Pr(X|K)
was then used for five longer runs (20,000 burn-in iterations and 100,000 sampling iterations).

Results
Descriptive analysis of sequence data
The 195 isolates characterized were classified into 92
unique sequence types (STs; see Additional file 1 for all
STs and allelic types) whereas a previous analysis of 120 L.
monocytogenes isolates from human and animal clinical
cases and foods (Nightingale et al. [2]) only revealed 52
STs. The addition of sequences for 75 isolates from other
sources thus resulted in a considerably more diverse data
set for our population genetics analyses. The increase in
STs is mainly caused by an increase in lineage II isolates;
the 45 additional lineage II isolates contributed 26 new
STs.

The genetic diversity of the seven loci sequenced ranged
from π = 0.0044 (gap) to π = 0.0669 (purM) with the
number of allelic types ranging from 18 (gap) to 50 (inlA)
(Table 1). When the different parameters were calculated
separately for isolates in lineages I and II, the genetic
diversity in each lineage was typically considerably lower
as compared to the overall genetic diversity (e.g., for actA
πall = 0.0558, while πlinI = 0.0058 and πlinII = 0.0064); the
only exception being gap (Table 1). One locus (ribC)
showed a significant positive value for Tajima's D (Table
1) when the data for all lineages were analyzed, suggesting
a divided population structure. On the other hand, prs
showed a significantly negative value of Tajima's D in lin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/277

eage II (-2.02, P < 0.05), which is indicative of a bottleneck or selective sweep [30,31]. For lineage II, Tajima's D
was also negative for sigB (-1.69), however this value was
not significant (P > 0.05).
Phylogenetic analysis
The consensus network tree based on the combined output of all five ClonalFrame runs (10,000 trees) shows that
the clades representing lineage I and lineage II receive significant support (>95% posterior probability) (Figure 1).
The lineage IIIA and IIIB isolates each form separate significantly supported clades (>95% posterior probability).
The analysis is inconclusive about the monophyly of lineage III or the phylogenetic placement of lineage IIIC.
Within lineage I, significant support was found for a subdivision between STs 4, 13, 46 and 48 and the remainder
of the lineage I isolates. Lineage II contains several significantly supported clades of closely related STs.
STRUCTURE analysis
Multiple STRUCTURE runs with different values of K (the
number of ancestral subpopulations) showed that the
probability of the data given K was maximal at K = 4. For
simplicity we will call the ancestral populations with the
highest proportion of lineage I, II, IIIA and IIIB isolates
the 'ancestral' populations of the respective lineages [32].
Lineage I forms a genetically homogeneous group with an
average of 93% of genetic material descended from the
ancestral lineage I population (Figure 2). In contrast, only
an average of 74% of the genetic material found in lineage
II isolates is descended from the ancestral lineage II population (Figure 2), whereas 20% of it came from the
ancestral lineage IIIA population. In particular, 14 STs in
lineage II had an exceptionally low proportion (between
50 and 66%) of genetic material from the ancestral lineage II population. In these STs, up to 47% of the material
came from the ancestral lineage III population. Due to the
small number of lineage III isolates in our dataset (n =
15), we did not explore the population structure of lineages IIIA, B, and C. Rather, lineage III isolates were only
included in the STRUCTURE analyses to estimate the proportion of lineage I and II genetic material that was
obtained from the ancestral, lineage III populations.
Population history
The internal/external branch length ratio test showed that
both recombination corrected genealogies of lineage I and
lineage II exhibit a significantly higher internal/external
branch length ratio (lineage I: 1.50, P = 0.005; lineage II:
1.64, P = 0.00002) than expected under the coalescent
model (see Figure 3). This clearly indicates that the contemporary population in both lineages experienced a
recent expansion of the effective population size, which is
consistent with a population bottleneck.

Recombination events
The majority of the 17 recombination events found by the
Sawyer's test was found in the house-keeping genes purM
(4 events) and ribC (8 events) (Table 2). The average tract
length of recombination imports inferred by the Sawyer's
test was 302 bp for inlA, 114 bp for purM and 192 for ribC.
ClonalFrame also inferred a high number of recombination events in purM (13 events) and ribC (10 events), but
in contrast to the Sawyer's test it inferred a high number
of recombination events in the virulence genes actA (11
events, only one event according to the Sawyer's test) and
inlA (16 events, only three events according to the Sawyer's test) (Table 3). The number of events inferred by
ClonalFrame may be higher because it detects recombination events in a phylogenetic framework, which allows the
detection of recombination events involving the entire
length of the locus as well as events involving only parts
of the locus. Closer examination of the results of both
tests revealed that the majority of the recombination
events in actA involved an 80 bp region on the 5'-end of
the locus. The average tract length of recombination

imports (δ) for all loci inferred from the combined ClonalFrame runs was 126 bp with a 95% credibility interval
of 100 to 154 bp. While ClonalFrame may have a tendency to underestimate the tract length [14], this result is
in fairly good agreement with the short lengths of recombinant fragments inferred by Sawyer's test.
Overall effect of recombination
To compare the rate of recombination between lineage I
and II, ClonalFrame analyses were run separately on isolates representing each lineage (Table 4). We found a
mean value for ρ (the recombination rate times two) of
11.4 (with credibility interval [2.2–21.8]) for lineage I,
and of 42.6 (C.I. [29.3–56.3]) for lineage II. The relative
frequency of occurrence of recombination versus mutation (ρ/θ) was 0.13 (C.I. [0.03–0.23]) for lineage I, and
0.71 (C.I. [0.49–0.94]) for lineage II. The relative effect of
recombination versus point mutation (r/m) was 0.66 (C.I.
[0.24–1.19]) for lineage I and 4.42 (C.I. [3.04–5.89]) for
lineage II. Both the frequency and effect of recombination
was therefore estimated to be about six times higher in lin-

Unrooted consensus network based on 10,000 phylograms obtained from ClonalFrame analyses of the individual sequence
Figure
types 1
Unrooted consensus network based on 10,000 phylograms obtained from ClonalFrame analyses of the individual sequence types. Genealogical inference was performed for all 92 unique STs using ClonalFrame as described in the Methods. A consensus network was built using Splitstree [23]. Reticulate relationships were found in at least 20% of the trees and
indicate phylogenetic uncertainty. Branches supported by a posterior probability of more than 95% are colored in red. Leaves
are labeled with ST designations.

eage II than in lineage I, and the non-overlapping of the
credibility intervals between lineage I and II strains for all
parameters indicated that these differences are statistically
significant.
The influence of recombination on the phylogenetic inference of L. monocytogenes was clearly demonstrated by comparison of ClonalFrame results with and without
correction for recombination (Figure 4). The phylogram
based on the analysis without correction for recombina-

tion (Figure 4a) suggested a time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of lineage I that is clearly smaller
than the TMRCA of lineage II, whereas a phylogram based
on the analysis with correction for recombination (Figure
4b) revealed that the TMRCA of lineages I and II are similar. This indicates that lineage I and II appeared at approximately the same time, and that the higher genetic
variability of lineage II can be attributed to its higher
recombination rate.

Discussion
The different tests and analyses we used all show that
recombination is more prevalent in L. monocytogenes lineage II than in lineage I. The Bayesian inference of the relative recombination rate (ρ/θ) for both lineages shows that
the relative recombination rate in lineage II is approxi-

mately six times higher than in lineage I (Table 4). Comparison of the values of ρ/θ with those that have been
previously calculated for other species or groups of related
species of bacteria (Table 5) shows that the recombination
rate in lineage II is higher to that inferred for the Bacillus
anthracis/cereus-clade [14], but still relatively low in com-

model, which is indicative of a bottleneck event during the population history.

monocytogenes lineage II strains compared to lineage I
strains has previously been reported [36,37], one other
recent study [38] found no clear differences in recombination rates between L. monocytogenes lineage I and II isolates. By contrast, our data reported here indicate that the
higher diversity among lineage II strains is exclusively due
to a higher recombination rate in lineage II strains, and in
particular to a large number of imports from lineage IIIA.
While both our data reported here and the data reported
by Ragon et al. [38] are consistent with regard to the relative contribution of recombination and point mutations

to the diversity of lineage I strains (r/m rates for nucleotides were between 0.6 and 0.7 in both studies), our data
indicate a much higher r/m ratio for lineage II strains (r/
m = 4.42) as compared to the r/m rate reported for linage
II strains by Ragon et al. (r/m = 0.47) [38]. These differences in the relative recombination rates for lineage I and
II strains between our study and the Ragon et al. [38]
study are likely related to differences in the selection of
isolates and target genes for MLST between these two studies. While the study of Ragon et al. [38] is heavily biased
towards human clinical isolates (75%) with limited representation of animal (7%), food (3%) and environmental
isolates (3%), 69% of the isolates in our study were from
sources other than human clinical cases. The higher
source diversity represented among our isolates, including
use of a considerable number of environmental isolates
that may be more likely exposed to donors of genetic
material, may explain the increased frequency of recombination among the lineage II isolates characterized here.
Ragon et al. [38] also used seven housekeeping genes,
which are assumed to be under negative selection and
subject to less homologues recombination, while our
study used four housekeeping genes as well as two genes
involved in virulence (actA and inlA) and one stress
response gene (sigB). Interestingly, we identified recombination events in both virulence as well as housekeeping
genes, consistent with a comparative genomic study by
Orsi et al. [16], who found that close to 50% of the 2267
genes found in the L. monocytogenes/L. innocua core
genome show evidence for recombination and that
recombination is more frequent in lineage II than lineage
I strains based on evaluation of 40 randomly selected

genes. While the loci used by Ragon et al. [38] are thus
ideal for intraspecific phylogenetic reconstruction, due to
their low recombination rate, these genes are not necessarily representative for the recombination rate throughout
the whole genome. The loci used in our study may be
biased towards recombining loci and therefore lead to
over-estimation of recombination rates, however the
nearly identical r/m rates for lineage I isolates reported
here and by Ragon et al. [38], suggest that selection of loci
has a limited effect on estimates of recombination rate
among lineage I strains. While multiple studies (e.g.,
Meinersmann et al. [36], Orsi et al. [16], etc.) support that
recombination is frequent among lineage II strains, clearly
some genes (e.g., those selected by Ragon et al. [38]) will
show limited recombination in both lineages. An unbiased estimate of the contributions of recombination to
diversity among bacteria will thus require future genome
wide studies, such as those reported by Orsi et al. [16],
and Lefebure and Stanhope [39]. Combined with an initial genome wide study already published (e.g., Orsi et al.
[16]), our study shows that phylogenetic lineages, even
within a given bacterial species, can differ significantly in
their recombination and mutation rates. Similar findings
have previously been reported for different species within
a given genus. For example Lefébure and Stanhope [39],
found that a much higher percentage (37%) of genes in
the Streptococcus core-genome of Streptococcus pyogenes
show evidence for recombination compared to Streptococcus agalactiae (18%). These results illustrate the need to
develop new inferential tools that account for the possibility of variations in the recombination rate from one lineage to another.

Mutation hotspots, short stretches of sequence that evolve
at a higher mutation rate than their flanking region, have
been shown to cause homoplasy that can be incorrectly
identified as being caused by recombination [40]. One
stretch of sequence in our dataset, the first 80 bp of the
actA locus, is potentially a mutation hotspot. Both the
Sawyer test and ClonalFrame identify this stretch of
sequence as being involved in recombination. ClonalFrame inferred that this fragment was involved in 9 independent recombination events. It is highly unlikely that
the same stretch of sequence is involved in that many
import events and therefore we consider this a case of
mutation hotspot related homoplasy. The first 80 bp of
the actA locus contain two amino acid positions that have
been proven to be under positive selection [2], which may
explain why this stretch of sequence experiences an elevated mutation rate. The occurrence of this hotspot may
influence the inference of the recombination rate and the
average length of the recombination fragments, however
its effect is limited because it only involves ca 20% of the
events inferred by ClonalFrame.
Mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria
include conjugation, transduction and transformation
[41]. Transduction and conjugation usually involve long
imported fragments (several kb's to hundred's of kb's)
[41], and are therefore unlikely to be responsible for the
homologous recombination events in L. monocytogenes we
observed. Considering the short size of the recombinant
fragments identified, horizontal gene transfer in L. monocytogenes most likely occurs through transformation. This
is supported by the observation that short import elements of only a couple of hundred bp have been observed

in the naturally competent bacterium Helicobacter pylori
[42]. While L. monocytogenes does not show evidence for
competence under laboratory conditions generally used
to induce competency [43], our observations suggest that
L. monocytogenes and in particular lineage II isolates may

be competent under certain environmental conditions.
This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that L.
monocytogenes possesses a large number of genes (e.g.,
comC, comEA, comEB), which, in B. subtilis, encode proteins important for transformation [43].

Table 5: Relative recombination rates found in other bacteria

While most lineage I and II strains possess the ability to
cause listeriosis, lineage I, the lineage with the lowest
recombination rate, appears to be more virulent for
humans [44]. In particular, lineage I strains have been
linked to almost all major human listeriosis outbreaks
and are responsible for the majority of sporadic listeriosis
cases [45], show a higher infectious dose [44], and, on
average, have a higher ability to spread inside human cells
[46]. In contrast, Wirth et al. [9] proposed, based on data
for Escherichia coli, that epidemic and virulent bacteria face
an increased selective pressure for rapid diversification in
response to host immune defenses, resulting in higher
recombination rates. As L. monocytogenes is an opportunistic pathogen with a wide host range as well as a sapro-

troph found in many different environments, we propose
that the high recombination rate in lineage II is not due to
selective forces involved in its virulence. Rather recombination may be critical for lineage II to successfully compete and survive in a broad range of different
environments, consistent with the observation that lineage II strains are typically found at higher levels than lineage I strains (e.g., in foods [44]) and are more common
than lineage I strains in natural environments.
Our data suggest that both lineages I and II have been subject to a recent expansion in population size, which is
obscured in lineage II by a high level of recombination.
The question is if this recent expansion started from a
small founder population that survived a major extinction
event (a population bottleneck) or from a limited number
of strains with a higher fitness as compared to related
strains in the ancestral population (selective sweep). It is
difficult to differentiate between these two scenarios,
since they both leave the same population genetic signal
in a contemporary population. While previous studies
[36,37] proposed that only L. monocytogenes lineage I
strains experienced a recent bottleneck, our analyses suggest that both lineages have been affected. Using ClonalFrame, which takes recombination into account when
reconstructing a phylogeny, we showed that lineage I and
II do not differ considerably in age (assuming that the
mutation rate follows a molecular clock in both lineages).
The external/internal branch length test shows significant
support for a bottleneck scenario in lineages I and II.
Additional support for a bottleneck in lineage II is found
in a significant negative value of Tajima's D for prs and an
almost significant negative value for sigB; a negative value
of Tajima's D indicates that these loci did not evolve neutrally and is suggestive of a selective sweep or a population
bottleneck [30,31]. This signature of a bottleneck event in
lineage II is not apparent among the other genes studied
as most of them (i.e., actA, inlA, purM and ribC) were subject to a considerable number of recombination events in
lineage II. The occurrence of a most recent common ancestor around the same time in two independent lineages
supports the scenario of a population bottleneck (as
opposed to a selective sweep), since it implies a common
cause for the reduction in population size, such as a climatological change or an alteration of their habitat. Meinersmann et al. [36] estimated the time to the most recent
common ancestor of lineage I to be between one-half and
one million years ago. This coincides with the first glaciation cycles of the Pleistocene [47], which induced a rapid
change both in climate and biota. A decline of available
hosts and/or a strong selective pressure for adaptation to
colder temperatures could therefore be the cause for the
population bottlenecks in both lineages. It is tempting to
speculate that the fraction of the population that survived
may have been adapted to growth and survival at low tem-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/277

peratures (a hallmark phenotypic characteristic of L.
monocytogenes [48]) and/or to specific mammalian hosts
that were available at that time.
Our data also support L. monocytogenes lineage I and lineage II should be considered distinct species-like evolutionary lineages, consistent with the conclusions reached
by Ragon et al. [38] in their recent study. The results of our
ClonalFrame and STRUCTURE analyses support the existence of lineage I and II as separate evolutionary lineages
with little genetic material exchanged between them,
which is in agreement with a number of previous studies
[2,49]. The number of lineage III isolates in this study is
too low to draw conclusions on the evolutionary status of
this lineage. Though a well-supported subdivision was
found within lineage I in the phylogenetic analysis, no
evidence for a further subdivision of lineage I and lineage
II could be found with the STRUCTURE analysis. The
STRUCTURE analysis showed that 14 lineage II STs
acquired less than 67% of their nucleotide alleles from the
ancestral lineage II population. Wirth et al. [9] considered
isolates with less than 2/3 overlap with one of the ancestral populations to belong to a hybrid group. The uncertainty in our phylogenetic inference (the reticulate
relationships depicted in Figure 1) of the lineage II STs
seems to be mainly caused by these 'hybrid' STs. Therefore
lineage II could be considered a so-called fuzzy species
[50], i.e., a species that has unclear boundaries because of
its inherent ability to import genetic material from other
species. A previous study [51] has shown that in the case
of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the apparent status as a fuzzy species was an artefact caused by sequencing of differentially
amplified fragments from mixed non-viable historical cultures. In our case all sequences were obtained from viable
cultures and started from single colonies in order to avoid
mixed cultures. We can therefore be confident that lineage
II truly represents a fuzzy species. Lineage I, on the other
hand, seems to be a species with clearly defined species
boundaries and few imports from an external origin.

Conclusion
Our study not only adds to an emerging body of literature
that supports the importance of recombination in the evolution of bacterial populations, but also shows that even
closely related bacterial populations can differ considerably with regard to the contributions of homologous
recombination to diversification and evolution. Our
study further illustrates the challenges that lineage specific
recombination provides for inference of the phylogeny
and population history of bacterial populations. While L.
monocytogenes lineage I has traditionally been seen as less
divergent and more clonal than lineage II, our analyses
clearly show that high diversity in lineage II is due to
recombination and that both lineages went through a
population bottleneck. Previous suggestions that only lin-

eage I experienced a bottleneck appear to be an artifact of
the high recombination rate in lineage II. While both lineages I and II seem to represent species-like lineages, lineage I appears to be a genetically isolated population with
a low recombination rate, whereas lineage II seems to
have more diffuse genetic boundaries due to a relatively
high frequency of imports of genetic material from other
lineages. While our data supports that lineage I and lineage II each constitute species from an evolutionary perspective and while the two lineages appear to differ in
their virulence [44], they both are able to cause human listeriosis. From a practical perspective, it may therefore be
best not to change theses lineages to an official rank of
species.
