Abstract
Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by mosquito-transmitted filarial
nematodes, including Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program
in Thailand has reduced the prevalence of nocturnally subperiodic W. bancrofti (Thai strain), mainly
transmitted by the Ochlerotatus (Aedes) niveus group in Thailand to 0.57/100,000 population. However, it
is estimated that more than one million Myanmar migrants with high prevalence of bancroftian filariasis
have settled in the large urban cities of Thailand. These infected migrants carry the nocturnally periodic
W. bancrofti (Myanmar strain) which has Culex quinquefasciatus as the main mosquito vector. Although
transmissions of the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti by the Thai Cx. quinquefasciatus has never been
reported, previous study showed that Cx. quinquefasciatus could nurture the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti
to the infective stage. Thus, the potential now exists for a re-emergence of bancroftian filariasis in Thailand.
The present study was undertaken in an attempt to differentiate between the Thai and Myanmar strains
of W. bancrofti.
Methods: The microfilarial periodicity of Thai and the Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti were determined.
Comparative morphology and morphometry of microfilariae and a study of random amplified polymorphic
DNA (RAPD) was performed. The Nei's genetic distance was calculated, and a phylogenetic tree was
constructed using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA).
Results: The Thai strain of W. bancrofti was nocturnally subperiodic, and the Myanmar strain of W.
bancrofti was nocturnally periodic. The body length, cephalic space length, and cephalic space width of the
Thai strain of W. bancrofti were significantly larger than those of the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti (p <
0.05). However, an overlapping mean of these parameters made it impractical for field application. RAPDPCR profiles showed specific bands characteristic for the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti. The phylogenetic
tree indicated two genetically distinct clusters of the Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti.
Discussion: This study was the first report on the genetic polymorphism of the Thai and Myanmar strains
of W. bancrofti. Differentiation between the Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti could not rely on
morphological criteria alone. However, RAPD profiles revealed a significant diversity between the two
strains. The RAPD-PCR technique was suitable for differentiating Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti.
The RAPD marker could be used for epidemiological assessment of the Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti in
Thailand.

Background
Lymphatic filariasis (LF), the second leading cause of
long-term disability worldwide from lymphedema,
elephantiasis, hydrocele and periodic fevers, is caused by
mosquito-transmitted filarial parasites, Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi [1]. It is estimated that 1.1 billion
people, 20% of the world's population, in more than 83
countries are at risk of acquiring the infection, while more
than 120 million individuals have already been infected
[2]. In 1993, the International Task Force for Disease
Eradication (ITFDE) identified LF as one of six potentially
eradicable infectious diseases. In 1997, the World Health
Assembly passed a resolution to eliminate of LF as a public health problem by 2020 [3].
In Thailand, bancroftian filariasis is endemic on the ThaiMyanmar border (mainly Tak, Kanchanaburi, and Mae
Hongson Provinces) [4-6]. The nocturnally subperiodic
W. bancrofti (rural strain; Thai strain) found in infected
Thai rural populations has the Ochlerotatus (Aedes) niveus
group as the main mosquito vector. Recently, it has been
reported that Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand carry
W. bancrofti at a prevalence of 2–8% [4]. These infected
Myanmar migrants carry the nocturnally periodic W. bancrofti (urban strain; Myanmar strain) which has Culex
quinquefasciatus as the main mosquito vector [7]. Cx. quinquefasciatus readily breeds in urban areas of Thailand. The
Thai strain of Cx. quinquefasciatus could nurture the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti to the infective stage in a recent
laboratory study [5]. This means that the urban Thai population is at risk of the infection. The high prevalence of
W. bancrofti infection in Myanmar migrant workers has
prompted concern that a re-emergence of bancroftian
filariasis in Thailand is impending.
The Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti has been proven to be
distinct from the Thai strain of W. bancrofti based on
microfilarial periodicity, its dimensions and the number
of nuclei between the cephalic space and nerve ring [8,9].
However, a morphological and morphometric study is
time-consuming, laborious, and consequently not suitable for large-scale application. DNA polymorphism assay,
based on random the amplified polymorphic DNA
polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR), has been proved
useful for analyzing the inter- and intra-specific genetic
variations and phylogenetic relationships. The RAPD
technique is based on the amplification of a random DNA
segment with a single primer of arbitrary nucleotide
sequence and using the polymerase chain reaction
[10,11]. This technique is very rapid, simple, and generates a reproducible fingerprint of the PCR products. In
addition, it neither depends on previous knowledge or
availability of the target DNA sequences nor requires DNA
hybridization. The potential use of RAPD in taxonomy
and population genetics has been widely documented

http://www.filariajournal.com/content/6/1/6

[12-15], including with W. bancrofti populations in India
[16,17]. However, no information is available concerning
the genetic polymorphism between the Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti. We developed the RAPD-PCR
technique to differentiate between the Thai and Myanmar
strains of W. bancrofti.

Methods
Study population
The Thai strain of W. bancrofti microfilariae was collected
from microfilaraemic Thai patients living in Tha Song
Yang District, Tak Province, and Sankhla Buri District,
Kanchanaburi Province, in the western region of Thailand. The Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti microfilariae
were collected from microfilaraemic Myanmar migrants
living in Mae Sot District, Tak Province, in the western
region of Thailand. Among 6 Myanmar patients recruited
for this study, 3 were from Rangon and 3 from Moulmein,
Myanmar (Figure 1).

This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (Bangkok, Thailand). As almost none of the Myanmar
workers spoke or read either Thai or English, verbal
informed consent in the Myanmar language was obtained
from each volunteer in the presence of two witnesses. We
had a Thai-Myanmar interpreter for communicating with
the Myanmar migrants. After the study was completed, all
volunteers received a standard course of treatment with
diethylcarbamacine.
Microfilarial periodicity
The periodicity of each strain of W. bancrofti microfilariae
was determined by counting the microfilariae from 20 μl
finger-prick blood films, in triplicates, taken at 2-hour
intervals over a period of 24 hours. We obtained microfilariae from 4 Thai and 4 Myanmar infected cases. Each
blood film was stained with Giemsa (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany), as previously described [6,18,19]. The blood
film was examined under a light microscope by two independent individuals. The average counts of microfilariae
were plotted against time.
Blood collection
Blood for morphological and morphometric studies and
RAPD was obtained from each infected individual. Ten
milliliters of venous blood were collected under sterile
technique and universal precautions from Thai patients at
20.00 hours, and from Myanmar patients at 02.00 hours,
as previously described [18,19].
Morphological and morphometric study
The standard smear method [20] was used to prepare the
slides. Twenty microliters of blood were smeared in a
straight line on a clean slide, dried, dehemoglobinized,

transferred to the plate containing PBS, microfilariae were
harvested using a needle under a stereo microscope, and
suspended in 10 μl of PBS.
DNA extraction
DNA extraction was performed using FTA paper (Whatman Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) as previously described
[21]. Briefly, the microfilariae were washed twice with
PBS, and then subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles, and blotted onto the FTA paper. After air drying, the FTA paper was
washed twice with 200 μl of FTA purification buffer (Life
Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) for 15 min, washed
twice with 200 μl of TE-1 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0],
0.1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) for 5 min, and then dried on a
heating block at 56°C for 10 min. The dried FTA paper
was used as the DNA template in RAPD-PCR amplification.

and stained with Giemsa. The stained microfilariae were
assessed by counting the number of nuclei between
cephalic space and nerve ring using a light microscope.
The body length and width at various sites were measured
using an ocular micrometer, the camera-lucida, and curve
meter, determined by two independent individuals.
Thirty microfilariae from each patient were studied. Differences in means were analyzed by standard t-test using
SPSS software program.
Microfilaria harvesting
One milliliter of blood was mixed with 9 ml of isotonic
phosphate buffered saline (PBS [pH 7.4]; 137 mM NaCl,
2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mM KH2PO4), filtered through a 5.0 μM Millipore membrane filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA), followed by adding approximately
20 ml of PBS, and air drying [20]. After the filters were

RAPD-PCR parameters
Six oligonucleotides from the ready-to-go RAPD analysis
kit (Amersham Biosciences Ltd., Piscataway, NJ) were
used for amplification of random DNA markers to reveal
the genetic diversity among W. bancrofti populations.
RAPD-PCR was performed with ready-to-go RAPD analysis Beads as described by the manufacturer (Amersham
Biosciences). Approximately 10 ng of genomic DNA from
microfilriae was used. The RAPD reaction was performed
in a DNA thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 2400,
Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT), for 1 cycle at 96°C for 4 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 40°C for 1 min
and 72°C for 2 min, respectively. The final amplification
cycle included 7 min extension at 72°C. Amplified products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel (USB, Cleveland,
OH) electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and
visualized under ultraviolet light. The size of each band
was determined by Quantity One® 1-D Analysis Software
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). RAPD analysis of human DNA
(control), using the same primer and protocol was also
conducted to rule out the possibility of contamination of
human DNA in the samples. The amplification of all the
DNA samples was repeated three times in order to see the
variability, if any, in the amplification patterns. Similar
patterns were obtained from all experiments.
Phylogenetic analysis of the RAPD profiles
RAPD profiles were used to measure genetic similarity
among W. bancrofti populations. The presence or absence
of bands was coded in binary (0, 1) form in a data matrix.
Parasites from one individual patient were treated as a
genetic population. Relationships among the individual
genetic populations of W. bancrofti were determined by a
distance matrix method. The approach involved calculation of the Nei (1973) index of genetic similarity [22].
Distance values were subjected to phylogenetic analyses
using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithme-

strain of W. bancrofti microfilariae in peripheral blood was
at 02.00 hours.

Results

Microfilarial morphology and morphometry
Microfilariae of both the Thai and Myanmar strains of W.
bancrofti were sheathed, lying in graceful coils without secondary kinking. Somatic nuclei were discrete, overlapping
where crowded but with distinct borders, and countable.
The nuclear column stopped before the tip of the tail.

Microfilarial periodicity
The periodicity profiles of the Thai and Myanmar strains
of W. bancrofti were determined (Figure 2). The microfilariae were present in peripheral blood of 4 Thai patients at
all times during a 24-hour period but with higher numbers during the nighttime than during the daytime. This
indicated the nocturnal supperiodicity character of Thai
strain of W. bancrofti. The peak count of the Thai strain of
W. bancrofti microfilariae in peripheral blood was at 20.00
hours.

The microfilariae were present in peripheral blood of 4
Myanmar patients during 18.00 hours and 10.00 hours,
and absent during 12.00 hours and 16.00 hours, indicating the nocturnal periodicity character of the Myanmar
strains of W. bancrofti. The peak count of the Myanmar

Morphometric measurements and counts of nuclei
between the cephalic space and nerve ring of the two
strains of W. bancrofti microfilariae were demonstrated
(Table 1). Some measurement parameters of the Thai
strain of W. bancrofti (body length, 299.20 ± 11.87 μm;
cephalic space length, 5.47 ± 0.68 μm; and cephalic space
width, 5.91 ± 0.53 μm) were significantly (p < 0.05) larger
than those of the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti (the
body length, 286.92 ± 9.42 μm; cephalic space length,
5.20 ± 0.71 μm; and cephalic space width, 5.62 ± 0.57
μm). However, other parameters of the Thai strain of W.

cephalic space and nerve ring, 88.51 ± 8.29).
RAPD analysis
Out of the six oligonucleotides assayed, only the RAPD
Analysis Primer 1 (5'-dGGTGCGGGAA-3') revealed
unambiguous genetic polymorphisms between the Thai
and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti, and was retained for
the analysis in this study. The RAPD profiles of W. bancrofti from 12 genetic populations (6 Thai patients and 6
Myanmar patients) were analyzed (Figure 3). The analysis
of RAPD profiles indicated the existence of genetic variability between the Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti. The number of DNA fragments amplified in the
RAPD-PCR from each sample ranged from 5–9. The fragment sizes of different bands recorded for all the samples
ranged from 300–1400 bp. The 300 bp and 795 bp bands
were specific to the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti
because the Thai strain did not show these bands. Both
strains shared the 645, 705, 1290, and 1400 bp bands.
Amplification of human DNA (non-infected with W. bancrofti) with the same primer, under similar conditions,
yielded 7 fragments ranging from 470 to 1200 bp, but
none of these fragments was identical to the fragments
amplified in the W. bancrofti DNA samples (Figure 3).
This observation shows that there was no human DNA
contamination in the parasite DNA samples used for this
study.

Phylogenetic analysis
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using PAUP software
to characterize W. bancrofti populations through phylogenetic analysis. Twelve genetic populations fell into two
major clusters (Figure 4). The upper half of tree consisted
of 6 genetic populations from the Thai patients. The lower
branch consisted of all 6 genetic populations from the
Myanmar patients. This phylogenetic tree demonstrated
clearly that a genetic diversity existed between the Thai
and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti.

Discussion
The microfilarial periodicity of the Thai strain of W. bancrofti was nocturnally subperiodic, with a peak microfilaremia at 20.00 hours (Figure 2). The microfilarial
periodicity of the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti was nocturnally periodic, with a peak microfilaremia at 02.00
hours. The microfilarial periodicity found in our study
corresponded to previous reports [8,9].
We found that only 3 morphometric measurement
parameters, body length, cephalic space length, and
cephalic space width, of the Thai strain were significantly
larger than those of the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti
(Table 1), while previous studies [8,9] showed that all
parameters measured in the Thai strain of W. bancrofti
were larger than in the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti.
This might be the result of a difference of geographic locations of the study populations. The Thai strain of W. bancrofti in our study was obtained from Tha Song Yang
District, Tak Province, and Sankhla Buri District, Kanchanaburi Province, while the Thai strain of W. bancrofti
in previous studies was obtained from Mae-Ramat District, Tak province. However, the previous studies do not
provide the information where the Myanmar strain of W.

bancrofti was obtained. Further studies would clarify this
issue. Although the body length, cephalic space length,
and cephalic space width were significantly different
between the Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti, the
ranges of these parameters were overlapping (body
length, 270–324 μm versus 255–310 μm; cephalic space
length, 4.00–7.00 μm versus 4.00–7.00 μm; and cephalic
space width, 4.00–8.00 μm versus 4.00–7.00 μm, from the
Thai strain and the Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti,
respectively). The overlapping range of values made it
impractical to differentiate between the Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti. In addition, the morphological
and morphometric studies were time-consuming, laborious, and consequently not suitable for large-scale application [8,9]. This difference can only be distinguished by
highly experienced personnel [8,9].
Differentiation of filarial nematodes have been reported,
using DNA hybridization assays [24-27], PCR [18,28-30],

PCR-RFLP [6,31-34], and RAPD [12-17]. However, there
is no report of any molecular technique that could differentiate between the Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti. Our RAPD profiles of the Thai and Myanmar strains
of W. bancrofti revealed a significant diversity (Figure 3),
with 300 bp and 795 bp bands specific for the Myanmar
strain of W. bancrofti. The phylogenetic analysis exhibited
two distinct clusters of the Thai and Myanmar strains of
W. bancrofti (Figure 4). Therefore RAPD-PCR was suitable
to differentiate between the Thai and Myanmar strains of
W. bancrofti. The RAPD-PCR has been proven to be an
easy, reproducible and rapid technique that could be used
as a diagnostic tool to assess the real burden of Thai and
Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti in Thailand. Further study
of the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti-specific bands by
Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) [35,36]
should be performed to develop strain-specific PCR primers/probes, to identify the Myanmar strain of W. bancrofti.

Conclusion
Although the existence of different strains of W. bancrofti
(based on microfilarial periodicity) was documented in
the past [20], differentiation techniques using laboratory
methods (eg. morphological and morphometric study)
have been a problem. We could differentiate between the
Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti by comparing
morphology and morphometry using microscopy, biological behavior by microfilarial periodicity, and genetics by
RAPD technique. However, the PCR-based technique for
RAPD could clearly characterize genetic differences
between the Thai and Myanmar strains of W. bancrofti.
The RAPD-PCR technique was indeed useful for the differentiation of strains of W. bancrofti because of its relative
ease, simplicity and reproducibility.
