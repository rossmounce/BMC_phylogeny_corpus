Evidence from comparative genomics for a complete sexual cycle
in the ‘asexual’ pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata

Background: Candida glabrata is a pathogenic yeast of increasing medical concern. It has been
regarded as asexual since it was first described in 1917, yet phylogenetic analyses have revealed
that it is more closely related to sexual yeasts than other Candida species. We show here that the
C. glabrata genome contains many genes apparently involved in sexual reproduction.

Background

to diploid S. cerevisiae but unable to sporulate. By genetic
engineering to create MTLa and MTL␣ hemizygotes, C. albicans was induced to mate in the laboratory and in infected
mice, forming tetraploids [2,3]. In addition, Miller and
Johnson [4] showed that C. albicans MTL hemizygotes
undergo phenotypic switching between the common ‘white’
form and an ‘opaque’ form that is a million-fold more active
in mating. Further analysis of the almost-complete genome
sequence of C. albicans revealed that it contains homologs of

information

The genus Candida consists of ascomycete yeast species that
lack an apparent sexual (teleomorph) stage in their life cycle
and seem to reproduce only mitotically. However, data from
the C. albicans genome project has recently led researchers
to question the asexuality of that species. C. albicans was
found to have a mating type-like (MTL) locus similar to the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAT locus [1]. Natural isolates of
C. albicans are diploid MTLa/MTL␣ heterozygotes, similar

interactions

Conclusions: We infer that C. glabrata is likely to have an undiscovered sexual stage in its life
cycle, similar to that recently proposed for C. albicans. The two Candida species represent two
distantly related yeast lineages that have independently become both pathogenic and ‘asexual’.
Parallel evolution in the two lineages as they adopted mammalian hosts resulted in separate but
analogous switches from overtly sexual to cryptically sexual life cycles, possibly in response to
defense by the host immune system.

refereed research

Results: By genome survey sequencing, we find that genes involved in mating and meiosis are as
numerous in C. glabrata as in the sexual species Kluyveromyces delphensis, which is its closest
known relative. C. glabrata has a putative mating-type (MAT) locus and a pheromone gene
(MFALPHA2), as well as orthologs of at least 31 other Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes that have no
known roles apart from mating or meiosis, including FUS3, IME1 and SMK1.

to C. albicans, C. glabrata also undergoes phenotypic
switching [14,15], raising the interesting question of whether
it too may have an undiscovered teleomorph form.

most of the S. cerevisiae genes involved in the key sexual
processes of meiosis and sporulation as well as mating [5].
These findings have led to the hypothesis that the life cycle
of C. albicans includes a cryptic sexual phase, which perhaps
is utilized only occasionally or under particular environmental conditions [6] - infrequently enough not to have been
detected during more than a century of research into C. albicans, but frequently enough to cause evolutionary conservation of the genes involved in the sexual process.
Interestingly, sexual forms of some other Candida species
were identified long ago by mycologists but their significance
has often gone unrecognized by molecular biologists because
the anamorphs and teleomorphs are assigned different
names - for example, the sexual form of Candida krusei is
called Issatchenkia orientalis [7,8].
Medically, C. albicans is still the major fungal agent of
human disease, but C. glabrata is a species of growing
concern. The incidence of C. glabrata infections, particularly
in the bloodstream, has risen alarmingly over the past
decade [9,10]. It has also gained much attention since the
discovery of its inherently low susceptibility to the drug fluconazole [11]. The genome of C. glabrata appears to be

In phylogenetic trees drawn from rDNA sequences, most
Candida species including C. albicans fall into one monophyletic group, whereas C. glabrata is much more closely
related to S. cerevisiae than to the C. albicans group
(Figure 1 and [16-18]). Therefore, the ‘asexual’ life cycles of
C. glabrata and C. albicans arose independently from sexual
ancestors [16,19]. Phylogenetic analysis also showed unexpectedly that C. glabrata’s closest relative is Kluyveromyces
delphensis, a sexual species [17,18]. C. glabrata is a commensal resident of the human intestinal tract and an opportunistic pathogen [20,21], whereas K. delphensis was first
isolated from dried figs [22] and is often found associated
with Drosophila willistoni [23]. The type strain of
K. delphensis is homothallic and therefore probably diploid.
It has been studied very little at the molecular level.
The aim of the present study was to use genome survey
sequencing (GSS) to characterize the genomic differences
between the closely related asexual C. glabrata and the
sexual K. delphensis. However, we find that there are no significant differences between the gene repertoires of these
species. C. glabrata has many genes involved in mating,
meiosis and sporulation, including a pheromone gene and a
putative mating-type locus. This leads us to propose that,
like C. albicans, it must have an undiscovered sexual phase
in its life cycle.

Results
Genome survey sequencing of C. glabrata and
K. delphensis
We constructed plasmid libraries with random genomic
inserts of 7-15 kilobases (kb) from C. glabrata and
K. delphensis and sequenced both ends of about 3,000 plasmids (> 3 megabases (Mb) of primary sequence data, or
approximately 0.2x genome coverage) from each species.
Phylogenetic analysis of the combined complete 5S, 18S,
5.8S and 26S rDNA sequences from yeasts (Figure 1) confirms that C. glabrata and K. delphensis are each other’s
closest known relatives [17,18]. The phylogenetic tree also
confirms that C. glabrata is more closely related to S. cerevisiae than to C. albicans, indicating that the two Candida
species originated independently from sexual ancestors.
Assembled sequence contigs from C. glabrata and K. delphensis were searched against the complete set of S. cerevisiae proteins using FASTY reciprocal best hits to identify putative
orthologs (see Materials and methods). The results of the
genome surveys of the two species should be roughly comparable to one another, because the same methods and similar
numbers of clones were used in both cases. The genomes can

be assumed to be similar in size [24,25], and the two species
are equally distantly related to S. cerevisiae. Indeed, they
yielded similar numbers of sequence contigs (4,481 from
C. glabrata, 4,202 from K. delphensis) and similar numbers of
putative genes with unambiguous S. cerevisiae orthologs
(1,941 and 2,057, respectively).

S. cerevisiae genes for the ␣1 transcription activator and the
␣2 repressor (MATALPHA1 and MATALPHA2, respectively), oriented divergently (Figure 3). As expected from the
species phylogeny, the level of amino-acid sequence identity
between S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata (38% in ␣1, and 40%
in ␣2) is greater than that between S. cerevisiae and K. lactis
or C. albicans in the same proteins [1,35]. Between
C. glabrata and K. delphensis, there is 59% amino-acid
sequence identity in ␣1 and 76% in ␣2.

C. glabrata has orthologs of RIM4 and MUM2, both of
which are needed for premeiotic DNA replication [44,45],
and HOP2, which acts to prevent synapsis between nonhomologous chromosomes [46]. We also found MSH4,
which is implicated in synaptonemal complex formation and

information

The GSS data from C. glabrata also identified orthologs of
many S. cerevisiae genes involved in meiosis, a central step
in the sexual cycle that leads ultimately to the production of
gametes (sporulation). We found C. glabrata orthologs of 19
S. cerevisiae genes whose only known functions are in
meiosis or sporulation (Table 3), including the master regulatory switch gene IME1 [38]. S. cerevisiae IME1 expression
is induced by the a1/␣2 heterodimer representing the
genetic signal from a diploid cell, in combination with nutritional signals. We found C. glabrata orthologs of MCK1 and
RIM9, which are inducers of IME1 expression, and UME6
which negatively regulates meiosis-specific genes during
vegetative growth but is converted into an activator of early
meiosis genes when Ime1 is present [39,40]. C. glabrata also
has orthologs of IME2, which can promote sporulation in the
absence of IME1 [41], and IDS2 and RIM4, whose products
promote Ime2-dependent activation of many downstream
targets [42,43].

C. glabrata appears capable of responding to pheromones as
well as synthesizing them, because it has genes for the
polarity-establishment proteins Far1 and Cdc24 [30], for
Sgv1 (a kinase acting in the pheromone adaptation pathway
[31]), and Akr1 (a protein with an inhibitory effect on the
pheromone signal transduction pathway [32]). At the end of
the signal transduction cascade it has orthologs of Fus3 (the
final MAP kinase in the mating response pathway, which
activates Ste12 and Far1 [33]), as well as the nuclear fusion
protein Kar5 [34].

deposited research

We identified C. glabrata orthologs of many genes in the
S. cerevisiae mating response pathway including the Ste11,
Ste7 and Fus3 kinases and the Ste12 transcription factor
(Figure 2). Because some components of the mating pathway
also participate in other pathways (such as filamentous growth)
that might legitimately be expected to be present in an asexual
organism, we focus here on genes that have no other known
functions apart from mating. The GSS data identified
C. glabrata orthologs of 13 S. cerevisiae genes that may be
involved exclusively in mating (Table 2). These include an
␣-factor pheromone gene (MFALPHA2 [26]), STE13, whose
sole function appears to be maturation of prepro-␣-factor [27],
and STE6, whose only known role is in a-factor export [28].
The complete C. glabrata MFALPHA2 gene was sequenced
and codes for a signal peptide and three repeats of a candidate
mature pheromone sequence WHWV(R/K)(L/I)RKGQGLF
(single-letter amino-acid notation) flanked by processing
sites for Kex2 [29], Kex1 and Ste13 proteases. The ortholog
in K. delphensis was also sequenced and has four copies of
the sequence WHWLSVRPGQPIY. The two precursor proteins share 49% sequence identity.

In K. delphensis the ␣2 and ␣1 genes are flanked on one side
by a series of five genes whose orthologs are beside the MAT
locus on S. cerevisiae chromosome III (Figure 3), in the
same arrangement except that K. delphensis lacks PHO87.
These genes include BUD5, which is almost twice as large in
K. delphensis as in S. cerevisiae (1,241 amino acids versus
642). The predicted KdBud5 protein includes an extra SH3
domain near its amino terminus, giving it an overall structure more similar to Cdc25 [36]. On the other side of the ␣2
and ␣1 genes in K. delphensis there is a series of five genes
whose orthologs are on S. cerevisiae chromosome XII,
beginning with YLR186W (EMG1 [37]). The same breakpoint between chromosome III and chromosome XII
orthologs is also seen in C. glabrata (Figure 3). It therefore
seems likely that a chromosomal rearrangement occurred on
the right-hand side of the MAT locus either in an ancestor of
K. delphensis and C. glabrata, or in an ancestor of S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, the coding regions of the ␣1 gene and
EMG1 overlap by 28 nucleotides at their 3؅ ends in both
K. delphensis and C. glabrata.

Gene functions in C. glabrata and K. delphensis were inferred
from the known functions of their S. cerevisiae orthologs,
using the ‘cellular role’ categories of the Yeast Proteome Database (Table 1). Orthologs were found for approximately 40%
of the S. cerevisiae genes involved in most cellular roles,
reflecting the level of GSS coverage. The numbers of genes
found in C. glabrata and K. delphensis for each cellular role
are highly similar (Table 1), and the two genomes are not significantly different in any of the 42 categories (p > 0.05 by ␹2
test). Importantly, C. glabrata does not have significantly
fewer genes than K. delphensis in the categories of mating
response and meiosis, which relate to sexual functions.

Similarly, we found orthologs of genes involved in the

include SPO1, a phospholipase B homolog that promotes

spindle-body duplication exclusively during meiosis [48],
and SPO22, CSM1 and CSM3 which are less well characterized but show meiosis-specific expression with deletion
mutants exhibiting varying degrees of chromosome missegregation [49]. C. glabrata also has a homolog of SMK1,

noted that the genome was only surveyed to 0.2x sequence
coverage, so that only 1,941 genes (roughly one-third of the
expected number of genes in the genome) were detected in
this study. It is interesting that C. glabrata has orthologs of
MFALPHA2 and IME1, which were not found in C. albicans
[5]. However, this is possibly just due to extensive sequence
divergence, rather than gene loss, in C. albicans. The complete sequence of C. glabrata Ime1 has only 27% amino-acid
sequence identity to S. cerevisiae Ime1. Very recently, a candidate C. albicans pheromone gene was described [55,56].

meiotic genes [50,51]. Another surprising finding is an
ortholog of DIT1, which is required for dityrosine biosynthesis [52]. In yeasts, the dimerized amino acid dityrosine
has only been found on the outer surface layer of the
ascospore wall but not in vegetative cell walls [53]. The
maintenance of these genes in C. glabrata is highly indicative of an ability to sporulate.

Discussion
The results from survey sequencing of the C. glabrata and
K. delphensis genomes show that they have very similar
repertoires of genes in all categories of cellular roles (Table 1),
including mating and meiosis. More detailed analysis showed
that C. glabrata has orthologs of at least 31 genes that in
S. cerevisiae have no known functions apart from mating or
meiosis (Tables 2 and 3), and that it has intact genes for ␣factor and a putative mating-type locus. Together, these
results suggest that C. glabrata has an undiscovered sexual
cycle. Although it is possible that future studies in S. cerevisiae will discover new roles for some of these genes other
than in mating or meiosis, it seems more reasonable to
propose that C. glabrata has a sexual cycle than to propose
that it is asexual and that all 31 genes have been preserved in
its genome because they have undiscovered roles in nonsexual processes. The compact nature of yeast genomes makes it
unlikely that all the sexual genes we identified by GSS are
pseudogenes, and the MFALPHA2, MATALPHA1 and
MATALPHA2 genes certainly are not pseudogenes.
Even though we did not find orthologs of some other genes
that are central to mating (for example, STE2/STE3 and

Despite the evolutionary distance between them (Figure 1)
and gross differences such as the fact that C. glabrata is
haploid whereas C. albicans is diploid, there are remarkable
parallels between the evolution of C. glabrata and C. albicans. The two species have evolved independently from sexually reproducing yeast ancestors that are unlikely to have
been pathogenic, because the majority of lineages in this
phylogenetic group are not pathogenic (Figure 1). Thus, in
becoming human pathogens, both C. glabrata and C. albicans have adopted a lifestyle where the sexual phase is
hidden. Miller and Johnson [4] proposed that, in
C. albicans, this is because the white (asexual) form survives
better in the mammalian host. By analogy, it is tempting to
speculate that one of the forms produced by phenotypic
switching in C. glabrata [14,15] might be mating-competent.
It is interesting to note that in other species of Candida for
which sexual forms (teleomorphs) have been identified, such
as Candida krusei, the form isolated in clinical settings is
invariably the asexual one [7,8]. We hypothesize that having
a sexual cycle may be essential for the long-term evolutionary viability of all yeast species because of the evolutionary
advantages conferred by recombination [57,58], but that
mating confers a disadvantage on those individuals that
mate because they are somehow more vulnerable to the
host’s immune response. The result of these opposing forces
seems to have been the evolution of cryptically sexual
pathogens in which the frequency of mating in the population has been reduced to a low but optimal level.

Materials and methods
The type strains of C. glabrata (CBS 138) and K. delphensis
(CBS 2170) were purchased from the Centraalbureau voor
Schimmelcultures (Utrecht, Netherlands). High-molecularweight DNA was prepared using standard procedures and
partially digested with Sau3AI. Fragments in the size range
7-15 kb were isolated and used to make random genomic
libraries in the low copy number Escherichia coli vector
pMCL210 (AGOWA, Germany). Sequences were obtained
from both ends of the insert for 2,939 C. glabrata (CG) and
2,974 K. delphensis (KD) clones, with a further 449 CG and
290 KD clones sequenced successfully from one end only.
The average lengths of sequence reads used for analysis were
548 base-pairs (bp) (CG) and 515 bp (KD). Representation of

S. cerevisiae chromosome XII

Genome Biology 2003, 4:R10

information

We used a recent annotation of the S. cerevisiae genome
[62], containing 5,583 annotated proteins (excluding ‘very
hypothetical’ proteins and pseudogenes), downloaded from

Among the full set of contigs, those that contained rDNA
sequences were identified. These were used in conjunction
with publicly available rDNA sequences, isolated from the
C. glabrata and K. delphensis type strains, to create the
complete rDNA repeating unit for both species. The two

interactions

Trace files from the random genomic clones were basecalled using PHRED [59,60] and vector clipping was done by
CROSS_MATCH. Clipped sequences shorter than 100 bp
were discarded from the dataset. Contigs were assembled
using PHRAP with the original trace quality files and are
available on request. Contigs were filtered to eliminate mitochondrial DNA as well as known repetitive sequences such
as rDNA and Ty elements, which may cause misassembly.
This was achieved using the contigs as queries in BLASTN
and BLASTX searches [61] against the relevant S. cerevisiae
sequences. Any contig with a significant expect value
(E-value) of < 1e-5 was excluded from ortholog assignment.

[63]. Orthologs of these genes in the C. glabrata and
K. delphensis filtered contigs were identified using FASTY
version 3.4t05 [64], after a low complexity masking step
using the NSEG and PSEG programs [65]. For any gene-sized
region in a contig, we considered the S. cerevisiae protein
with the strongest FASTY hit to be the ortholog, provided that
the E-value for this hit was < 1e-5 and was more than 1e3
times lower than the E-value for the second-best hit to the
same region of the contig. For each ortholog identified, its
function in S. cerevisiae was examined using the ‘cellular
role’ categories of the Yeast Proteome Database (YPD) of the
Incyte BioKnowledge Library [66]. It should be noted that in
this functional annotation scheme, a single protein can be
classified into more than one cellular role. While we adhered
strictly to the YPD classification of genes in our initial analyses (Table 1), we also discovered some genes that can be
reclassified on the basis of the literature (for example, SPS2
was classified under ‘differentiation’ in YPD but was found to
be meiosis-specific on further examination) and included
these reclassified genes in Tables 2 and 3.

refereed research

mitochondrial DNA in the libraries appeared to be very low,
even though we did not take any specific measures to
exclude it. After data analysis, the inserts of selected plasmid
clones were sequenced completely on both strands by primer
walking. Sequences have been deposited in GenBank with
accession numbers BZ293019-BZ299345 (C. glabrata GSS),
BZ299346-BZ305583 (K. delphensis GSS), AY181247AY181250 (complete sequences of MAT and MFALPHA2
loci), and AJ535506 (C. glabrata IME1).

*We

are not certain whether plasmid CG4206 contains an ortholog of
SPS2 or the similar gene YCL048W, but we have included it in the table
because both SPS2 and YCL048W encode prospore membrane proteins
induced during sporulation [70].

rDNA sequences were combined with those from 14 other
hemiascomycete yeast species used in our previous study
[67] and aligned using T_COFFEE [68]. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using the NJ method as implemented in
CLUSTALW [69].
