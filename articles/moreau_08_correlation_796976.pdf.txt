Abstract
Pre-treatment HCV quasispecies complexity and diversity may predict response to interferon
based anti-viral therapy. The objective of this study was to retrospectively (1) examine temporal
changes in quasispecies prior to the start of therapy and (2) investigate extensively quasispecies
evolution in a group of 10 chronically infected patients with genotype 3a, treated with pegylated
α2a-Interferon and ribavirin.
The degree of sequence heterogeneity within the hypervariable region 1 was assessed by analyzing
20–30 individual clones in serial serum samples. Genetic parameters, including amino acid Shannon
entropy, Hamming distance and genetic distance were calculated for each sample. Treatment
outcome was divided into (1) sustained virological responders (SVR) and (2) treatment failure (TF).
Our results indicate, (1) quasispecies complexity and diversity are lower in the SVR group, (2)
quasispecies vary temporally and (3) genetic heterogeneity at baseline can be use to predict
treatment outcome.
We discuss the results from the perspective of replicative homeostasis.

Background
The Hepatitis C virus (HCV), is the causative agent of
chronic hepatitis C and infects at least 170 million individuals worldwide [1-3]. The virus has been classified into
six major genotypes and more than 70 subtypes based on
sequence diversity [4-10]. The most important feature of
HCV is that it causes chronic infection in about 50–80%
of individuals [3,11-13].
The HCV genome exhibits significant genetic heterogeneity due to accumulation of mutations during viral replica-

tion, attributed to a limited fidelity of the RNA dependent
RNA polymerase [14,15]. This phenomenon generates a
dynamic population of heterogeneous but closely related
variants designated as quasispecies [14-17]. The massive
genetic heterogeneity present in quasispecies has important biological consequences and enables HCV to escape
immune clearance and to establish chronic infection [1822]. Furthermore, the quasispecies distribution may influence the outcome of anti-viral therapy and be important
in the development of resistance to anti-viral therapy [2327]. It is well established that HCV genotype influences

both response to therapy and disease severity as well as
the viral-host interactions [19,28-30]. Patients infected
with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 respond more favourably than
genotype 1 to pegylated α2a-Interferon and ribavirin antiviral therapy [12,27,31,32].

virus (HBV) which provides solid experimental evidence
of replicative homeostasis [48]. The authors have demonstrated that mutant pre-core protein significantly reduces
HBV replication and HBe antigen (HBeAg) expression relative to the wild type protein [48].

The HCV genomic heterogeneity is not distributed evenly
across the HCV genome. In particular, the untranslated
region at 5' and 3' ends of the genome exhibits areas of
conservations, whereas the hypervariable region 1
(HVR1) located in the amino-terminus of the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 is the most variable part of the HCV
genome. There is strong evidence to suggest that the
HVR1, encoding 27 amino acids (positions 1491 to 1571
on reference strain H77), is susceptible to immune pressure involving neutralising antibodies and allows the
selection of escape mutants [27,31,33-36]. A considerable
number of investigations into HCV quasispecies have
focused on the analysis of the HVR1, given that a high
degree of diversity increases the likelihood of distinguishing one viral species from another. Many studies have
investigated the composition and the evolution of HCV
quasispecies to determine whether the genetic changes
could provide biological clues for understanding and predicting the outcome of anti-viral therapy. These studies
have suggested a correlation between a high level of heterogeneity within the HVR1 and a poor response to
pegylated α2a-Interferon and ribavirin therapy
[21,28,30,31,37-43].

In the present study we have retrospectively investigated
the genetic distance profile and the molecular evolution
of the HCV quasispecies of a group of patients chronically
infected with HCV genotype 3a (1) in the pre-treatment
period and (2) during the course of treatment with
pegylated α2a interferon plus ribavirin. Our goals were to
define (1) temporal changes in QD during the time prior
to therapy and (2) whether the patterns of these changes
would correlate with the outcome of anti-viral therapy.

A growing body of evidence suggests that the molecular
profile of an individual's pre-treatment HCV quasispecies
diversity (QD) could potentially be used to identify
responders and non-responders. Currently there is little
information on the temporal changes to the QD in
chronic HCV carriers prior to therapy as QD is usually
assessed only at baseline [28,30,37-41,43]. Mapping
sequential alteration to the QD may define possible windows of opportunity during which therapy may have
increased efficacy for patients.
A mechanistic explanation for the temporal patterns of
quasispecies complexity in the non treatment period may
be found in replicative homeostasis (RH), a recently proposed hypothesis [44-47]. Briefly, RH consists of a series
of autoregulatory feedback epicycles that link RNA
polymerase function, RNA replication and protein synthesis through interactions between mutant or wild type proteins and the RNA dependant RNA polymerase (RDRP)
causing formation of stable, but reactive, replicative equilibria [47]. Replicative homeostasis provides a rational
explanation for HCV persistence, for HCV viral kinetics,
for quasispecies stability and also for the various
responses seen during anti-viral treatment of HCV.
Recently Chen et al. have reported a study on Hepatitis B

Results
Characterisation of the study group
All the samples used in this study were obtained from
chronically infected patients with genotype 3a hepatitis C
virus. The total number of individuals was 10; n = 7
females. Patient demographic details are outlined in Table
1. 9/10 patients were treatment naïve prior to the start of
the standard 24 weeks pegylated α-2a interferon plus ribavirin therapy (Table 1). Among the ten patients included
in the study, 6 were classified as sustained virological
responders, hence SVR, and 4 were classified as treatment
failure, hence TF (Table 1). Within the SVR group one
patient, SVR12, could be classified as superfast responder,
hence SFR, as HCV RNA was undetectable in serum at
week 1 of treatment (Table 1). Within the TF group, one
patient was classified as a non responder, hence NR2, as
the viraemia remained stable during the whole course of
treatment, whereas the three others were classified as
relapsers, hence R (Table 1). A t-test was performed to
investigate whether factors as age, body mass index (BMI)
and Viral load at baseline and were significantly different
between SVR and TF group. None of these comparison
were significantly different (P > 0.05, data not shown).
[49,50].
Clonal analysis and sequences data
Reproducibility, accuracy and sensitivity of the RT-PCR
protocol were assessed by use of sera normalised to 4 log10
IU/mL and by use of Pwo DNA polymerase which exhibits
proofreading activity [51].

In the present study, between 2 and 6 serial samples per
individual were subjected to RT-PCR and clonal sequence
analysis with a mean of 23 individual clones sequenced
for each serum sample (Table 1). A total number of 839
molecular clones were recovered. The sequence analysis
was performed after exclusion of all the defective
sequences: nucleotide deletion (n = 2) or mutation (n = 3)
producing a stop codon. A total number of 834 molecular

The pre treatment period corresponds to E and B time point. E for early sample, taken between 6 to 12 months before treatment and B for
baseline sample, taken at day 0 of pegylated INF-α2a/ribavirin treatment. The early treatment period corresponds to W1 to W4 time points
(samples taken at 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks of treatment). The sample taken at week 12 of treatment was only available for the non-responder patient
(W12*). The post treatment period corresponds to the L time point and was only available within the TF group. L for late sample taken at 2, 3, 10
or 12 weeks after the end of treatment). +, sample available with successful analysis. -, sample available with unsuccessful analysis. TND, target not

clones, corresponding to a total of 267240 bp, were further examined. Sequence analysis of these 834 individual
clones revealed a sequence of 320 bp in length encompassing the 81 bp of the HVR1, except for 30 clones which
presented with a 12 nucleotide in-frame insertion. No
other insertions were observed among the entire clonal
population. For the purpose of the genetic analysis, the
804 sequences consisting of a 320 bp amplicon and the 30
sequences consisting of 332 bp amplicon (12 bp insertion) were trimmed by 14 bp, (specifically, 9 bp at the
5'end and 5 bp at the 3'end of the amplicon) leading to a
final sequence of 306 bp or 318 bp (12 bp insertion),
respectively. The 834 trimmed sequences were assigned
unique GenBank accession nos. EU023073–EU023906.
The 12 bp insertion observed among 30 individual molecular clones, is located exactly at the junction of the E1 and
E2 regions (5'end of the 27 aa HVR1) and encoded a
sequence of 4 aa. All of the 30 individual clones belonged
to patient SVR6. A description of the molecular clones
containing the 12 bp insertion is detailed at the end of the
results section.

Phylogenetic trees reconstruction has shown independent
clustering of the sequences from each individual or set of
separate sequences. This finding confirms the absence of
inter sample contamination (data not shown).
Genetic variation during the pre-treatment assessment
period
A serum sample 24–44 weeks prior to the start of therapy
was available for each patient. This early sample, hence E,
represents an intra-patient untreated control. The mean
time between the E sample and the baseline sample,
hence B, was 34 weeks (SEM ± 10) for the SVR group and
24 weeks (SEM ± 0) for the TF group (Table 2). At E and B
time points the viral load did not differ significantly
among SVR and TF groups (P > 0.05, Figure 1A). The
changes in viral load observed for E vs B time points and
B vs W1 time points were found to be significant within
each group of patient but were non significant for intergroup comparison (Table 2). Although at E and B time
points, within the HVR1, samples from the TF group
exhibited higher viral load and higher quasispecies com-

plexity (QC) than patients in the SVR group, (1) the viral
load, (2) the normalised Shannon entropy at the nucleotide level (Sn-nt) and (3) the genetic distance (GD) did
not differ significantly between the two groups of patients
(p > 0.05, Figure 1A). In contrast, the normalised Shannon
entropy at the amino acids level (Sn-aa) and the genetic
diversity (mean Hamming distance, HD), within the
HVR1, were significantly lower in the SVR than in the TF
group at B time point (P = 0.019 for both parameters, Figure 1A) but not at E time point (P > 0.05, Figure 1A). The
same analysis was performed on the 62 predicted aa
sequences outside the HVR1 located at the 5'end of the
HVR1. In all patient groups, the normalized Shannon
entropy at both nucleotide and amino acid level, the
genetic diversity and the genetic distance were always
lower outside the HVR1 than within the HVR1 (Figure
1B). No significant difference for any of the genetic
parameters examined outside the HVR1 was observed at E
or at B time point between the two groups of patients (P >
0.05, Figure 1B).
Genetic variation and molecular evolution of the HCV
quasispecies during treatment in patients with different
patterns of response
Samples in the SVR group showed a decrease in HD, GD,
Sn-nt and Sn-aa between the B sample and the other serial
samples available for analysis but none of the difference
were significant (Table 2). These variations were associated with a significant reduction of HCV viral load (P =
0.01, Table 2). In the majority of SVR patients these
changes occurred before week 2, leading to a collapse of
QD followed by a decrease of viral RNA below the lower
level of detection (LOD, 10 IU/mL) (Figure 2A and Table
1). Within the TF group, despite a decrease in viral load
over time, this variation was not significant (P = 0.057,
Table 2). For the TF patients who had an end of treatment
response followed by relapse, genetic diversity decreased
at a slower rate than within the SVR group, leading to an
almost homogeneous HCV quasispecies population at the
time of relapse only (R4, Figure 2B). The reduction in Snaa at time point B versus W1 was significant when compared the two groups of patients (P = 0.038, Table 2).
Among the TF group, NR2 who did not response to therapy had a viral load that was stable during the course of
treatment (mean 5.15 ± 0.33). In NR2 the genetic diversity increased in the first 2 weeks of treatment and then
decreased slightly over the 24 weeks of treatment where
samples were available (NR2, Figure 2B). The same analysis was performed on the 62 predicted aa sequence outside the HVR1 located at the 5'end of the HVR1. In all
patient groups, the normalized Shannon entropy at both
nucleotides and amino acids level, the genetic diversity
and the genetic distance did not show any significant variation over time (P > 0.05, Table 2).

The analysis of individual viral variants within a patient
was performed by examination of the 27 aa HVR1
sequences at each time point and grouped according to
the pattern of response to therapy (Figure 2). The two representative examples of the SVR group, patient SVR3 and
SVR8 depicted in Figure 2A, showed clearly that the
number of viral strains present at baseline and at week 1
is reduced or retain at a low level of heterogeneity. In all
SVR samples the dominant strain at week 1 of therapy represents an average of 90% of the total viral population.
Interestingly, the dominant strain present at baseline was
still present in 3 patients in the SVR group at week 1 (Figure 2A, SRV8 is a representative example, other results not
shown) and retained dominance in two of them while
disappearing in 1 patient (results not shown). In the case
of the superfast responder, SFR (SVR12, Table 1), there
was 100% homogeneity at the amino acid level at baseline (data not shown).
The two representative examples in TF group, patient NR2
and R4 depicted in Figure 2B, showed clearly that the
number of viral strains present at baseline and at week 1
is higher than in the SVR group. Interestingly, the difference observed between the two groups was significant at
both time points. At B time point in the TF group, the
number of clonotypes was 6 versus 3 in the SVR group
with a P value of 0.024, whereas at W1 time point, the
number of clonotypes in the TF group was 5 versus 2
within the SVR group with a P value of 0.03. In all TF cases
at least one strain present at B time point was retained during the course of therapy and after the end of treatment.
In all TF cases at the L time point, where sample was available, the pre-dominant strain was either the dominant
strain or a minor strain already present at B time point.
This finding suggests the pre-existence of a "future" high
fitness strain able to persist and effectively dominate the
quasispecies population under interferon base anti-viral
therapy.
Phylogenetic analysis of the HCV quasispecies prior and
during treatment in patient with different patterns of
response
To monitor viral variation and evolutionary relationships
over time, phylogenetic analysis of all amino acid viral
sequences of the HVR1 within a patient were performed.
The phylogenetic trees represented in Figure 3 correspond
to representative patterns according to therapy outcome.
In the SVR group a distinct cluster of a monophyletic population was observed at E time point in 5 over 6 patients
(representative example SVR3, Figure 3A) supported by a
bootstrap proportion of greater than 650 of 1000 bootstrap replicates annotated at the appropriate branches as a
percentage value (Figure 3A). During the course of therapy in all cases examined, the viral sequences showed distinctive clustering within the sampling time points for the

Kimura's distance, shown as scale bar below each tree. A bootstrap analysis using 1000 bootstrap replicates was performed to
assess the reliability of each branch point. Bootstrap scores are given as percentage value. The values greater than 60% are

SVR group. This phenomenon was not observed for the TF
group. Thus for SVR patients, there was a progressive shift
in the viral population over time (Figure 3A). This observation is consistent with the low level of quasispecies
diversity observed during the pre-treatment assessment
period and with the decrease of QD observed over time
within the SVR group. In contrast, no cluster of a monophyletic population was observed at E time point within
the TF group and in most cases the viral sequences showed
no emergence of a cluster within the sampling time
points, during the course of treatment. The NR2 case in
Figure 3B is a representative example of this pattern showing intermingling of variants. This observation suggests a
relative evolutionary stasis of the viral population in
response to interferon based therapy compared to the pattern observed in the SVR group. However, in relapse
patients a tendency to form clusters was observed at the
time of relapse only, case R4 in Figure 3B. These results are
consistent with the high level of QD observed within the
TF group during the pre-treatment assessment period and
with the decrease in QD observed in relapse patient at the
time of relapse.

Intra-sample and inter-sample genetic distance variability
during treatment in patient with different patterns of
response
The intra-sample analysis which is a pairwise comparison
between all sequences within a particular quasispecies
population, measured the level of diversity within each set
of quasispecies population. At the HVR1, the mean intrasample genetic distance variability showed no marked
change over time within the SVR group (P > 0.05, Table
3). Within the TF group, the mean intra-sample genetic
distance variability showed a slight decrease over time but
the magnitude of change between the different time
points were not significant (P > 0.05, Table 3). Overall,
these results are concordant with the lower QC and QD
observed within the SVR group when compared to the TF
group during the pre-treatment assessment period and
during the course of therapy (Figure 2).

Inter-sample analysis which is the comparison of the
baseline sample alone versus the consensus of baseline
plus follow-up samples showed a slight increase of the
mean genetic distance within the SVR group (Table 3). In

contrast, within the TF group, inter-sample genetic distance variability revealed a slight decrease over time
(Table 3). None of these changes were significant (P >
0.05, Table 3). These findings are concordant with the
phylogenetic analysis indicative of a relative evolutionary
stasis of the viral population in response to interferon

based therapy within the TF group and a dynamic change
in the quasispecies population in response to interferon
based therapy within the SVR group.

regional analysis showed a lower rate of genetic variability
and heterogeneity over time (Table 3).
Rate of accumulation of synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitutions during treatment in patients with different
patterns of response
The accumulation rates of synonymous substitutions per
synonymous site (Ks) and nonsynonymous substitutions
per nonsynonymous site (Ka) were compared in each
group of patients to screen for positive selection in the
HVR1. Table 3 shows the intra-sample accumulation rates
of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions at
each time point and inter-sample accumulation rates of
synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions when
compared to the consensus of the viral sequence derived
from the B time point.

At the HVR1, in both group of patients during therapy, the
intra-sample rate of nonsynonynous substitution was
higher than the rate of synonymous substitution indicating that HVR1 is under positive selection (ratio Ka/Ks > 1).
The number of both synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions over time was higher within the
TF group compared to the SVR group with a significant
difference observed at B time point for Ka (P = 0.025,
Table 3). Furthermore, the intra-sample ratio Ka/Ks was
significantly higher in the TF group when compared to the
SVR group at B time point (P = 0.01, Table 3) and at W1
time point (P = 0.05, Table 3). This result is consistent
with the higher intra-sample QC and QD at B time within
the TF group when compared with the SVR group. No significant difference was observed between the two groups
of patients for the other follow up samples probably due
to the limited number of sample available (P > 0.05, Table
3).
Inter-sample analysis within the SVR group showed a relatively stable Ka, associated with a decreasing Ks, hence,
an increase in the magnitude of the Ka/Ks ratio in
response to interferon based therapy (Table 3). In contrast, inter-sample analysis within the TF group showed a
concomitant decline in Ka and Ks resulting in a progressive decrease of the Ka/Ks ratio in response to interferon
based therapy (Table 3). Overall, intra-sample analysis
indicates that while the QC remains relatively stable over
time, the actual amino acid composition changes due to
nonsynonynous mutations in the SVR group likely due to
enhanced positive selection in the SVR group compared to
the TF group. In contrast, the intra-sample and the intersample substitutions outside the HVR1 were mainly synonymous in all groups of patients suggesting that this
region evolved under purifying selection (Table 3).

Sequence analysis of the molecular clones with the 12 bp
insertion
A total of 30 molecular clones were found to contain a 12
bp in-frame insertion. All these molecular clones
belonged to patient SVR6, a patient from the SVR group
who had been examine at E and B time point only,
because no viral RNA was recovered after viraffinity protocol on the W1 sample (Table 1). For this particular
patient, at E time point, 50% of clones (n = 10/20) contained the 12 bp insertion encoding the following amino
acids: KTGG (EU023503–EU023512). At B time point
100% of clones (n = 20) contained the 12 bp insertion
with 2 different non-synonymous mutations compared to
the original 4 aa motif. The 12 bp insertion encoded the
aa sequence KTDG within 85% of clones (EU023525,
EU023526 and EU023528–EU023542), whereas the 12
bp insertion of the remaining 15% of individual clones
encoded the aa sequence KTEG (EU023523, EU023524
and EU023527). Interestingly, the 3 different species harbouring the insertion contained no synonymous mutations within the region sequenced. Furthermore, the 3
variants showed conservation of 3/4 aa, the aa change
occurring always at the third position of this short motif.
The variant with the insertion at E time point encodes for
a Glycine (G) at the third position whereas the two other
variants present at B time point encode for an Aspartic
Acid (D) or a Glutamic Acid (E). Aspartic Acid and the
Glutamic Acid are both hydrophilic, polar and negatively
charged amino acids whereas Glycine is a less hydrophilic
and neutral amino acid (i.e. uncharged). These differences
suggest that KTDG and KTEG motifs present at B time
point are more likely coding for external motifs with the
potential to bind to positively-charged molecules. These
findings strongly suggest that the 12 bp insertion may be
an important part of the quasispecies evolution.

The HVR1 of the HCV genome in this particular quasispecies population, i.e., SVR6, likely encodes 31 aa instead of
27 aa. In fact this is not the first description of a 12 nucleotides in-frame insertion at this position. However, this is
the first reported, to our knowledge, of an in-frame insertion in a genotype 3a virus. Aizaki et al. [52] have reported
a 12 nucleotides in-frame insertion at exactly the same
position, junction of the E1 and E2 regions, within a genotype 1b isolate. Only a limited number of other variants
harbouring insertions of 1 to 4 amino acids without frame
shift have been reported [53-57]. These insertions
occurred at the same position as the insertion we
described here, i.e., 5'end of the 27 aa HVR1 [52,54]) or
after the first amino acid within the HVR1 [53,55-57].
Based on GenBank database sequence analysis we found
no sequence identity at both nucleotide and amino acid
level between our sequence and the few variants already
published [52-57]. According to their recent data, TorresPuente et al. argued that variability in the size of the HVR1

Page 9 of 15

Virology Journal 2008, 5:78

could affect its antigenic property and its ability to bind to
cellular receptor [57]. Their results suggest a possible association between the presence of insertion and a lack of
response to therapy for genotype 1b infected patients. In
contrast in our study, the patient harbouring the insertion
within the HVR1 had showed a sustained virological
response after the end of therapy. Further studies are
needed to definitively understand the contribution of
these naturally occurring variant viruses to the HCV quasispecies population dynamics and their implication in
the HCV life cycle and pathogenicity.

Discussion
In this retrospective study we aimed to characterise QS
evolution in chronically infected hepatitis C genotype 3a
patients, (1) in the pre-treatment period and (2) during
the course of standard combination anti-viral therapy.
The study outlined here is the first to evaluate QS genetic
evolution in a single HCV genotype 3a population. Treatment resulted in an early virological response rate of 90%
(TND at week 1 to 4 of treatment), an end of treatment
response rate of 90% and a sustained virological response
rate of 60%. The rate of SVR reported here is slightly lower
than the rate for larger studies [58] for genotype 3a
patients, probably because of the limited number of samples analysed. Age, BMI and viral load were not associated
with treatment outcome as previously demonstrated in
larger genotype 3a population studies [49,50]. In the
present study, we have described (1) temporal changes
during the pre-treatment period in Sn-aa and in HD and
(2) how these changes in Sn-aa and HD relate to treatment outcome. Baseline complexity was significantly
lower in the SVR groups compared to the TF group (P =
0.019 for Sn-aa and in HD).
Our results are in broad agreement with previous studies
that have investigated viral genetic parameters as possible
predictive markers of treatment outcome [28,37,43].
However, our study advances these observations and further confirms the findings reported by Yeh et al. on a
homogeneous population of HCV genotype 1b infected
patients. Our data suggests that it may be possible to predict treatment outcome on the basis of QC at an earlier
stage in the treatment regimen [30]. The observed variances between our study and those of Farci et al. and
Chambers et al. is likely due to differences in the genotype
composition of the study population, in the methodological approach and in the genetic parameters examined
[28,37,43]. In the study reported here, variables were controlled to reduce the number of parameters contributing
to the analysis: (1) single genotype/subtype examined, (2)
evolution rates were controlled by use of intra-patient
data, (3) sera was normalised to 4 log10 IU/mL and (4) a
previously validated proof-reading DNA polymerase
based PCR methodology was used [51]. This study design,

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/78

in particular, the use of intra-patient versus inter-patient
controls and the use of a proof reading polymerase, likely
accounts for the differences in the proportion of defective
or unreadable clones (0.006) seen in our study and that
reported by Farci et al. (0.099), P < 10-6 (data not shown)
[28]. Consequently, the inferred HCV quasispecies complexity defined in our study is likely more reflective of the
true quasispecies complexity in vivo.
It is widely accepted that the genotype of the infecting
virus has a very large impact on treatment efficacy and the
kinetics of response in terms of actual viral load. Perhaps
the quasispecies dynamic also varies by according to genotype. The investigation of the molecular changes induced
by an interferon based therapy in a mixed HCV genotype
infected population suffers from this caveat. [28,37].
Abbate et al. and Yeh et al. have both examined a homogeneous population of HCV genotype 1b infected patients
[30,43]. At baseline, Yeh et al. found that the quasispecies
complexity at the amino acid level was significantly lower
in the SVR group than in the TF group. Conversely, Abbate
et al., despite using a homogeneous genotype population
and importantly utilised a proofreading DNA polymerase
protocol, did not find any significant difference between
the SVR and the TF group with respect to Shannon entropy
at the nucleotide level [30,43]. However, Abbate et al. did
not present data relating to Shannon entropy at the amino
acid level [43]. Chambers et al. in their study on HCV genotype 1a and 1b infected patients described a trend
towards a greater pre-treatment amino acid complexity in
the HVR1 amongst non-responders and this pattern was
significantly associated with a higher likelihood of nonresponse [37]. However, the authors have additionally
concluded that this trend could not significantly distinguish responders from non-responders based on achievement of a SVR [37]. Our study showed that a significant
difference between the SVR and the TF group existed for
Shannon entropy at the amino acid level but not at the
nucleotide level. These latter results are consistent with
Yeh et al [30].
The diversity, measure by the mean HD, was significantly
lower in the SVR group when compare to the TF group in
our study population. This result indicates that, at baseline in the SVR group, the individual viral strains are
closely related to each other, as the mean HD defines the
diversity among a set of sequences. Farci et al. did not correlate the mean HD results at baseline to the different patterns of response [28]. Therefore it is difficult to directly
compare the two studies based on the mean HD parameter.
Our findings document patterns of quasispecies change in
the HVR1 in a genotype 3a population in the months
prior to the start of therapy. Therapy-driven changes to the

quasispecies are a key viral trait in the early response to the
therapeutic pressure and likely vary according to the genotype sensitivity to pegylated interferon and ribavirin.
Abbate et al. have reported results supporting this concept,
in a single genotype population, and have postulated that
the evaluation of viral quasispecies at time points earlier
than baseline is likely to be more informative with respect
to viral evolution [43]. Collectively this information begs
the following question: what mechanism could rationally
explain why a low level of quasispecies complexity and
diversity prior to the start of anti-viral therapy correlates
with therapy induced HCV viral clearance? Replicative
homeostasis may provide a mechanistic explanation [4447].
Replicative homeostasis (RH) consists of an epicyclical
regulatory mechanism which links dynamically RNA
polymerase function with quasispecies phenotypic diversity resulting in the formation of stable, but reactive, replicative equilibria [47]. Experimental evidence for RH has
been recently reported by Chen et al. in Hepatitis B virus
infection [48]. In brief, RH hypothesises that a RDRP that
is highly processive has a reduced replication fidelity
resulting in a high intracellular concentration of mutant
genomes and consequently, a mutant spectrum of proteins. This mutant protein population (out) competes
with wild type forms and RNA polymerase interactions
resulting in a progressive increase in RDRP fidelity. Hepatitis C has a breadth of sequence space within which
mutations can be tolerated. This epicyclic variation in
viral sequence space is continuously constrained by factors such as viral fitness and the totality of the host's
defence systems. The normalised Shannon entropy at the
amino acids level (Sn-aa) can be considered, in part, a
measure of the fidelity of the RDRP. However, fidelity can
be influence by other factors. High Sn-aa equates to a
highly processive RDRP, which equates to a high quasispecies complexity. The potential pre-treatment efficacy of
peglyated interferon based therapy is related to Sn-aa, in
our study population, as evidence by the fact that the SVR
group had a significantly lower Sn-aa at time point B
when compared to the TF group (P = 0.019, Figure 1A).
The normalised Shannon entropy at the amino acids level
could therefore be used to predict treatment outcome
before therapy has started in a genotype 3a population.
The differences between the Sn-aa at the E and B time
point, even within the limited sample set examined, indicated that oscillations in the Sn-aa value occur over a short
period of time. These oscillations are of limited variance
for the SVR group with a trend towards reduced Sn-aa (0.026, Table 2) and according to RH likely to be in a phase
where RDRP fidelity is high [47]. Knowledge of the Sn-aa
may assist in the pre-treatment identification of the
approximate 20% of HCV 3a patients who will not
respond to pegylated interferon based anti-viral therapy.

The separation of SVR from TF based on Sn-aa and HD
suggests that real time mapping of QC and QD may identify windows of reduced Sn-aa and HD and by association,
windows of enhanced treatment efficacy. Two cases that
highlight the possible existence of windows of enhanced
treatment efficacy are (1) SVR8 and, (2) NR2 (Figure 3):
(1) SVR8 exhibited a Sn-aa and HD for the E sample that
were considerably higher than that recored for the B sample, 0.467 versus 0.067, and, 10.80 versus 5.20, respectively. While it is impossible to predict what the treatment
outcome would have been at time point E, the quasispecies complexity at time point B is less, existing primarily as
a single strain representing 95% of clones recovered.
Based on the Sn-aa, the extent of clonotype diversity and
the HD, perhaps the timing of treatment of SVR8 was fortuitous. (2) Conversely, NR2 may have had a window of
greater efficacy 24 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy.
Specifically, the Sn-aa and HD for NR2 between the E and
B time points were 0.173 versus 0.481, and, 1.40 versus
5.40, respectively. The expansion of the viable sequence
space for the pre-treatment B sample correlates with
reduced treatment efficacy.
The SFR (SVR12) represents an extreme example of RDRP
fidelity which results in a collapsing of the quasispecies
diversity at the HVR1 and likely viable sequence space.
The addition of exogenous pegylated interferon and ribavirin further restricts the viable sequence space and in
combination with a RDRP of high fidelity results in viral
extinction.

Conclusion
In conclusion, low Sn-aa and low HD at baseline are significantly associated with the clearance of HCV in this
genotype 3a population. The replicative homeostasis
hypothesis provides a probable mechanistic explanation
for our findings [30,47,48]. Temporal windows of
enhanced efficacy for pegylated-interferon based therapy
may exist, although this will require prospective evaluation.

Methods
Patients
Ten patients with a chronic HCV genotype 3a infection (7
females and 3 men, mean age of 41 ± 9 years) were
included in the present retrospective study. All the
patients had been treated with standard pegylated α-2a
interferon plus ribavirin for 24 weeks and 9/10 patients
were treatment naïve at the start of the therapy (Table 1).
Previously, patient SVR9 had been treated with Interferon
A alone for a period of 3 months. SVR9 was off treatment
for 6.5 years before the start of the standard pegylated α2a interferon plus ribavirin treatment course. All HCV
viral load measurements were determined by use of commercial assay Ampliprep/COBAS-TaqMan 48 platform

(Roche Diagnostic, UK) (Table 1). Treatment outcome
was defined by viral status six months post-cessation of
therapy, i.e., non detectable viral RNA equated to a sustained virological response (SVR) and presence of detectable viral RNA equated to a treatment failure (TF). For the
purpose of this study, sera samples were classified in (1)
SVR or (2) TF in accordance to their treatment outcome
(Table 1). A waiver of consent was provided by Clinical
Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals as samples used in this study were surplus to requirements following diagnostic investigations.
Design of the study
The number of viral variants, the genetic distance among
the different variants (genetic diversity), the level of complexity (Shannon entropy), the evolution of HCV quasispecies and the level of viral replication were studied in
serial serum samples obtained at different time points
before and during the course of therapy.

All serum samples were normalised to 4 log10 IU/mL
before RNA preparation in order to (1) standardise amplification efficiencies for intra and inter-patients sera and
(2) reduce the number of variables relative to the study.
The lower limit of detection (LOD) of the HVR1 RT-PCR
reaction was 3 log10 IU/mL. Viral load 4 log10 IU/mL was
chosen as the normalisation point for all samples.
Viraffinity reagent (Biotech Support Group, US), allows
the capture and the subsequent recovery of whole infectious virions, viral components, and sample preparation
for subsequent detection and analysis. In the present
study, 7 serum samples which had RNA level between 3–
4 log10 IU/mL were treated with the Viraffinity™ reagent
(Table 1).
For each patient the following serial serum samples were
obtained: one sample between 6 to 12 months before the
start of treatment (hence E, for early), one sample at day 0
before the start of treatment (hence B, for baseline) and
one at week 1 of treatment (hence W1) (Table 1). Additional serial serum samples were analysed, according to
the pattern of response, between week 2 and week 12 of
treatment (hence, W2–W12) (Table 1). A later sample
(hence, L) was analysed for the TF group (Table 1). In
relapse patients, the later sample was taken at time of
relapse, between 2 to12 weeks after the cessation of therapy and in the non-responder patient it was taken 3 weeks
after the end of treatment (Table 1).
Amplification of the E1/E2 region encompassing the HVR1
All serum was normalised to 4 log10 IU/mL by dilution in
buffer Tris-Hcl 10 mM pH 7.5. Total RNA was extracted
from 140 μl of the normalised sera (QIAmp Viral RNA
Mini kit, Qiagen, UK) and eluted in 60 μl of molecular
biology grade water. For the 7 serum samples which had

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/78

RNA level between 3 log10 (LOD of RT-PCR reaction) and
4 log10 IU/mL, 1 ml of pure serum was processed in presence of 250 μl Viraffinity™ reagent (Biotech Support
Group, US) according to the manufacturer recommendations and viral particles when recovered at the last round
of centrifugation were directly lysed into 560 μl of lysis
buffer provided in the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, UK). Unfortunately, 4 samples had insufficient RNA
to permit amplification even after Viraffinity treatment
and were therefore excluded from the study (Table 1).
0.5 μg random primers mix (Promega, Madison, WI) was
added to 11 μl of RNA. The RNA and primer mixture was
heated at 75°C for 10 min. and then cooled on wet ice. To
this was added 400 μM dNTPs (Roche, UK), 40 units
RNAse inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), 4 μl of AMV RT
5× reaction buffer and 10 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) to a final volume of 20
μl. The reaction was incubated at 42°C for 60 min. with a
final 94°C, 3 min. enzyme denaturation step. The amplification of E1/E2 region encompassing the HVR1 was carried out by use of nested primers, hence, set I previously
described by Ju Lin et al resulting in a 320 bp fragment
extending from nucleotides 1254 to 1572 according to
reference strain HCVCENS1 genotype 3a (GenBank accession no X76918)[59]. The primer sequences were as follow
(5'
to
3'):
outer
forward,
OF
(I),
ATGGCATGGGATATGAT; outer reverse, OR (I), AAGGCCGTCCTGTTGA; inner forward, IF (I), GCATGGGATATGATGATGAA;
inner
reverse,
IR
(I),
GTCCTGTTGATGTGCCA. The PCR reactions were performed with the proofreading Pwo DNA polymerase
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, UK) to ensure the accuracy of observed quasispecies diversity as previously
described by Mullan et al. [51]. First round-PCR was performed by mixing 5 μl of RT reaction mixture to a final
volume of 50 μl containing 15 pmol each of OF (I) and
OR (I) primers, 200 μM dNTP mix, 5 μl 10× Pwo PCR
MgSO4 free buffer (Roche, UK), 1.5 mM MgSO4 and 2.5
units of Pwo DNA Polymerase. Samples were amplified in
a GeneAmp PCR System 2700 thermal cycler (Perkin
Elmer, Kenilworth, NJ) under the following thermal
cycling profile: 3 min. at 94°C for initial denaturation of
cDNA; 35 cycles of 94°C, 15 s; 51°C, 30 s and 72°C, 45
s; followed by final elongation at 72°C for 7 min. The secondary nested PCR reaction was done using 4 μl of primary PCR product as a template and identical
composition to the first round of PCR, except for the relevant nested primer set, IF (I) and IR (I) (15 pmol each), a
MgSO4 concentration adjustment to 1 mM and a melting
temperature (Tm) of 53°C for the annealing step.
Suitable precautions were taken to reduce the risk of intersample contamination as suggested by Kwok and Higuchi
[60]. In addition, for each test sample, a negative control

was analysed in parallel throughout the entire procedure.
To screen for potential contamination of product DNA,
the viral sequences were analysed by cross comparisons of
all PCR product sequences included in the study as well as
comparisons with other viral sequences generated in the
laboratory by using a Neighbor-Joining algorithm
(PHYLIP) [61].
Molecular cloning and sequencing
After gel purification (Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit, QIAGEN, UK), the amplicons from E1/E2 were cloned into
pCR4 Blunt-Topo vector by use of the Zero Blunt TOPO
system (Invitrogen, Belgium) and transformed into chemically competent Escherichia Coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen, Belgium). This cloning kit provides a quick and
highly efficient one-step cloning strategy for direct insertion of blunt-end PCR products, generated by thermostable proof reading polymerases such as Pwo DNA
polymerase, into a plasmid vector specifically designed
for sequencing. Transformants were detected and 20
recombinant clones for each sample were selected at random, plasmid DNA was purified by use of QIAprep Spin
Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, UK) and screened for presence of
inserts. The double-stranded plasmid DNA sequencing
was out sourced to MWG-Biotech, Germany. Where
sequences had a high degree of homogeneity primary and
secondary PCR amplicons were re-generated in duplicate
from the initial cDNA template. After cloning into pCR4
Blunt-Topo vector only 5 additional clones were recovered for each new generated amplicon, purified and
sequenced as previously described.

of shared sites in two aligned nucleotide sequences. The
mean Hamming distance which is the average of the values taken for all sequence pairs derived from a single sample was separately calculated within the HVR1 (27 aa) and
on the sequence outside the HVR1 (62 aa) [28]. The mean
genetic distance (GD), the number of synonymous
(silent) nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site (Ks)
and the number of nonsynonymous (amino acid replacement) nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous site
(Ka) were calculated with the Kimura two-parameter
method, all sites, in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis software package (MEGA2 program, [63]. The
average number of Ks and the average number of Ka relative to the ancestral consensus sequence were calculated
for each time point within a single patient with the
MEGA2 program. Sequences obtained from each time
point were compared with the consensus reference
sequence of the baseline sample [28,37].
The complexity of the HCV strain in the region of interest
was quantified by calculating the normalised Shannon
entropy (Sn) at both nucleotides and amino acids level.
The Shannon entropy is a measure of the proportion of
identical sequences in a mutant distribution. The possible
values of Sn range from zero (when all genomes are identical) to one (when all genomes differ from one another).
Sn was calculated following the formula: Sn = Σi[(pi × ln
pi)ln n], in which pi is the frequency of each sequences in
the mutant spectrum and n is the total number of
sequences compared [64]. Phylogenetic analyses were
conducted by using the NEIGHBOR program in the
PHYLIP package [65], as previously described [62].
Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as the mean ± SE. The statistical
significance of comparisons among individual samples or
between the two groups of patients were analysed with
non parametric Mann-Whitney U test. A Chi Square Test
was performed to compare the overall proportion of viable sequences obtained in our study and in Farci et al.
study [28]. In all tests a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Sequence alignments were performed with CLUSTALW
(version 1.74) http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/ as previously described [62]. Sequence analysis was performed
after exclusion of all the defective sequences due to nucleotide insertion or deletion or mutation producing a stop
codon. Genetic diversity was calculated by analysis of predicted amino acid sequences amplified from E1 and E2
genes of the HCV genome including and excluding the 27
aa of the HVR1. The genetic diversity was calculated as
Hamming distance, or (1-S) ×100, where S is the fraction
