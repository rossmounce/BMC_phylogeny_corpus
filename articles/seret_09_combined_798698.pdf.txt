Abstract
Background: Pleiotropic Drug Resistant transporters (PDR) are members of the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC)
subfamily which export antifungals and other xenobiotics in fungi and plants. This subfamily of transmembrane
transporters has nine known members in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
We have analyzed the complex evolution of the pleiotropic drug resistance proteins (Pdrp) subfamily where gene
duplications and deletions occur independently in individual genomes.
This study was carried out on 62 Pdrp from nine hemiascomycetous species, seven of which span 6 of the 14
clades of the Saccharomyces complex while the two others species, Debaryomyces hansenii and Yarrowia lipolytica,
are further apart from an evolutive point of view.
Results: Combined phylogenetic and neighborhood analyses enabled us to identify five Pdrp clusters in the
Saccharomyces complex. Three of them comprise orthologs of the Pdrp sensu stricto, Pdr5p, Pdr10p, Pdr12p,
Pdr15p, Snq2p and YNR070wp. The evolutive pathway of the orthologs of Snq2 and YNR070w is particularly
complex due to a tandem gene array in Eremothecium gossypii, Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces (Lachancea)
kluyveri. This pathway and different cases of duplications and deletions were clarified by using a neighborhood
analysis based on synteny.
For the two distant species, Yarrowia lipolytica and Debaryomyces hansenii, no neighborhood evidence is available
for these clusters and many homologs of Pdr5 and Pdr15 are phylogenetically assigned to species-based clusters.
Two other clusters comprise the orthologs of the sensu lato Pdrp, Aus1p/Pdr11p and YOL075cp respectively. The
evolutionary pathway of these clusters is simpler. Nevertheless, orthologs of these genes are missing in some
species.
Conclusion: Numerous duplications were traced among the Hemiascomycetous Pdrp studied. The role of the
Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) is sorted out and our analyses confirm the common ancestrality of Pdr5p
and Pdr15p. A tandem gene array is observed in Eremothecium gossypii. One of the copies is the ortholog of Snq2
while the other one is lost in the post-WGD species.
The neighborhood analysis provides an efficient method to trace the history of genes and disentangle the
orthology and paralogy relationships.

Background
The phenotype for pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SACE) was discovered in 1973 by
RANK and BECH-HANSEN[1], who reported that single gene
mutations were responsible for resistance to multiple
drugs of different chemical structures and different targets.
The genetic and molecular mapping revealed that these
mutations are located in the transcription factors Pdr1p
and Pdr3p [2-4] and increased the expression of a series of
target genes [5] including those encoding the ABC efflux
pumps Pdr5p [6-8], Snq2p [9], Pdr10p and Pdr15p
[10,11] or Pdr11p [10].
Analysis of the full genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [12] revealed that these transporters are members
of a large phylogenetic subfamily of ABC transporters
named Pdrp (for pleiotropic drug resistance proteins),
where nuclear binding folds (NBF) alternate with
domains comprising six predicted transmembrane spans
(TMS) to form a NBF-TMS-NBF-TMS pattern [13]. NBF
includes a distinctive series of amino acid sequence
motifs, including Walker A, Walker B and ABC signatures
involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis.
The inventory of all full-sized Saccharomyces cerevisiae ABC
transporters reveals six Pdrp sensu stricto namely: Pdr5p,
Pdr10p, Pdr12p, Pdr15p, Snq2p and YNR070wp [13],
characterized by three criteria: (1) The alternation NBFTMS-NBF-TMS, which is different from the classical TMSNBD-TMS-NBD topology reported for the mammalian
multidrug resistance MDR and MRP drug efflux pumps
[14,15]; (2) The presence of a cysteine residue (C) instead
of the lysine residue (K) in N-terminal Walker A motifs as
well as the specific NVEQ motif in the C-terminal ABC signature [6,13]; (3) The efflux of multiple drugs [16-18].
The structural determinants for the broad substrate specificity of Pdrp pumps have not yet been identified even
though dozens of publications have reported hundreds of
amphiphilic substrates for Pdr5p and Snq2p. These two
pumps share many substrates even though some drugs are
preferentially handled by either one or the other [17,19].
In contrast, Pdr12p exhibits clear substrate specificity for
short chain weak organic acids [20].
Fully sequenced Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were all
examined and found to contain several Pdr proteins [21]
but their evolutionary lineage is unclear. A previous phylogenetic classification of Pdrp from five species spanning
the full Hemiascomycetes phylum identified seven subclusters [22]. GBELSKAet al. [23] showed that in contrast to
the other ABC subfamilies which remain as single copy in
each species during evolution, a series of gene duplications occurs independently in the PDR subfamily in five
hemiascomycetous species. GAURet al. [24] compared the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/459

NBF domains of S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans Pdrp.
They concluded that C. albicans contains a cluster of four
proteins homologs to Pdr5p and a single protein
homolog to Snq2p.
In addition to the Pdrp clusters sensu stricto, the S. cerevisiae genome contains two other ABC phylogenetic clusters
exhibiting the alternation of NBF-TMS-NBF-TMS domains
[13]. One cluster comprising Aus1p and Pdr11p are sterolinflux pumps [25] while another cluster comprising
YOL075cp is of undetermined function. As the members
of these two phylogenetic clusters show neither drug
efflux properties nor the K/C substitution in the Walker
A1 motif, we classified them as Pdrp sensu lato.
The aim of the present paper is to trace the evolution of
the Pdrp subfamily in nine species belonging to the Hemiascomycetes phylum, believed to have separated from the
filamentous fungi 300 to 400 million years ago [26,27].
Seven of these species span the 14 clades constituting the
Saccharomyces complex [28]. Among those, three novel
genome sequences from the Lachancea or Zygosaccharomyces clades were analyzed: Saccharomyces (Lachancea) kluyveri (SAKL), Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (ZYRO) and
Kluyveromyces (Lachancea) thermotolerans (KLTH) [29].
Two hemiascomycetous sequences of older lineage; Debaryomyces hansenii (DEHA) and Yarrowia lipolytica (YALI)
were also explored. An exhaustive database of all the chromosomal neighbors of the PDR genes from all nine hemiascomycetous species was developed (SERETet al., in
preparation) and allowed us to carry out combined phylogenetic and neighborhood analysis. Gene neighborhood
analysis has been pioneered by BYRNE and WOLFE[30] for
tracing the ancestral gene blocks produced by the Whole
Genome Duplication (WGD). We will illustrate the extent
and the limits of the information provided by analysis of
gene neighborhood data for deciphering the evolution of
the large Pdrp subfamily in addition to classical phylogenetic analysis based only on amino acid sequence similarity.

Results
The Pdrp transporters are a well characterized family of
genes implied in drug resistance. All genes share typical
features, such as Walker A and B and an ABC signature,
and are very similar in terms of sequence. In the Génolevures database, the family GL3C0025 which contains all
SACE Pdrp comprises 62 members (Table 1) of which 6
are considered as pseudogenes or fragments (Additional
file 1). The phylogenetic tree in Figure 1, based exclusively
on full-length proteins to improve multiple alignment,
shows that the 56 full-Pdr proteins of the GL3C0025 family (Additional file 2) branch into five clusters labeled A to
E. Each cluster is named according to its S. cerevisiae member(s): A, the cluster Pdr12p (8 members); B, the cluster

Snq2p/YNR070wp (11 members); C, the cluster Pdr5p/
10p/15p (25 members) which ramifies into 4 subclusters
labeled C1, C2, C3, C4; D, the cluster YOL075cp (7 members); E, the cluster Aus1p/Pdr11p (5 members).
Neighborhood analysis (Additional file 3) was carried out
to delineate Subsets of Orthologs by Neighborhood and
Similarity (SONS). Seven SONS labeled "a" to "g" (Figure
2) provide information on the evolution of 40 proteins
displaying informative neighborhood among the 62 PDR
from the GL3C0025 family.
For most genes, the phylogenetic clusters are confirmed
by the neighborhood analysis. But in some cases, divergences are observed. In the next sections, each phylogenetic cluster of genes is discussed in an evolutionary
perspective integrating the evidence from the neighborhood analysis.
Cluster A (Pdr12p)
This cluster comprises 8 members in SACE, CAGL (Candida glabrata), ZYRO, SAKL, KLLA (Kluyveromyces lactis) and
YALI (Figure 1). No full-Pdrp orthologs are detected in
KLTH, even though the neighborhood is well maintained
on chromosome E, ERGO (Eremothecium gossypii) and
DEHA. The neighborhood analysis (Figure 2 SONS a)
shows a clear connection (9 neighbors) between
SAKL0H10670g and the PDR belonging to the other species, except YALI. A second PDR copy is present in SAKL
on chromosome C. SAKL0CO5654g only shares one
neighbor, belonging to the GL3R2315 family. The very
high amino acid identity (98%, 17 substitutions) between
the two paralogs suggests a very recent duplication. A tandem gene array occurred in ZYRO where the two copies
diverged a little more (87% amino acid identity). None of
these duplications (on different chromosomes in SAKL

and within the same chromosome in ZYRO) were maintained in other species. Pdr12p and Snq2p are in closely
related clusters as they share a high similarity rate. Despite
this proximity of sequence, neighborhood evidence
shows that they evolved separately, at least since the speciation time of KLLA.
Cluster B (Snq2p/YNR070wp)
The phylogenetic Snq2p cluster comprises 11 members
that are represented in all the examined species except
YALI. A shared neighborhood is present from ERGO to
SACE (Figure 2 SONS b). It comprises a single ortholog of
Snq2p in each species except in SACE where YNR070wp is
a paralog of Snq2p. Moreover, neighborhood analysis
shows an apparent tandem gene array in ERGO chromosome B. However, the two copies are different (38%
amino acid identity). ERGO0B8140p has 63% identity to
Snq2p and only 41% identity to Pdr5p (Figure 3). In contrast, ERGO0B8162p has a higher amino acid identity to
Pdr5p (53%) than to Snq2p (36%). A similar heterologous tandem in a similar neighborhood is observed for
KLLA and SAKL with, however, the insertion of an increasing number of genes between the two members of the
repeat. ZYRO also presents two genes in this neighborhood but they are no longer in tandem gene array. It is
noteworthy that KLTH only has one gene, an ortholog of
Snq2, in this neighborhood.

The phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 also shows that paralogs
of Snq2 are observed in SACE (YNR070w), ZYRO
(ZYRO0B14762g) and SAKL (SAKL0H21010g) in nonshared chromosomal environments. YNR070w and
ZYRO0B14762g probably derive from a species specific
duplication event. The case of SAKL0H21010g suggests a
duplication followed by a rapid evolution of the copy. In
terms of identity, the DEHA0A03696g gene, which does

not share any neighbor with any Snq2 or Pdr12's
homologs, is closer to Snq2p (56%) than to Pdr12p
(44%).
Cluster C (Pdr5p/10p/15p)
The phylogenetic C cluster contains 25 members including the SACE Pdr5p/10p/15p. Figure 2 SONS c shows that
in the pre-WGD species ZYRO, three copies of Pdr5/15
orthologs
(ZYRO0D11836g,
ZYRO0D11858g,
ZYRO0D11880g) are organized in tandem on chromosome D. The triplicated ortholog copies of Pdr5/15 from
ZYRO are inserted in a neighborhood that can be traced
back in KLLA, SAKL and KLTH but none of these chromosomal environments contain a Pdr5/15 homolog. However, in each of these species a Pdr5/15-like copy is present
in a neighborhood different from that of the ZYRO triplicate. The KLTH, SAKL and KLLA copies show a strong phy-

logenetic link with Pdr5p/15p: nearly 67% amino acid
identity for KLTH0G19448p, nearly 70% amino acid
identity for SAKL0C08008p and nearly 65% amino acid
identity for KLLA0F21692p. KLLA0F21692g and
SAKL0C08008g share a common neighborhood (see Figure 2, SONS f) which is not shared with KLTH0G19448g
(see Figure 2, SONS g).
The ancestor of the ZYRO copies was duplicated by the
WGD and produced the ohnologs Pdr5 and Pdr15 [30]. In
fact, Pdr15, which is located on chromosome D, possesses
two common neighbors with ZYRO while Pdr5, located
on chromosome F, shares five common neighbors with
ZYRO. Only the Pdr15 copy was retained in CAGL in this
neighborhood. A second PDR, CAGL0M01760g, with a
high amino acid identity with Pdr5p/15p is present in
CAGL in another neighborhood.

framed in red represents a PDR. Adjacent boxes represent the PDR neighbors. Homologous neighbors, based on Génolevures
families, are highlighted in the same color. These SONS were calculated with 15 neighbors on each side, but the representation
was truncated to 5 neighbors for the sake of clarity.

Pdr10p shows high amino acid identity to Pdr5p/15p
(65% and 62% respectively). Segment alignment reveals
that Pdr10p can be differentiated from other SACE Pdrp
by a 22 amino acid insert (SDAAIMGNDKTVAKEHYSSPSS), located at the intersection of the two half PDRregions (NBF-TMS-insert-NBF-TMS). This marker means
that Pdr10p can be detected in S. cerevisiae, Saccharomyces
bayanus, Saccharomyces paradoxus and Saccharomyces mikatae but no ortholog was found in CAGL and in the preWGD species (data not shown, inferred from Broad Institute [31]). The event that gave rise to Pdr10p is thus postWGD.
In addition to the major subcluster C1 (Figure 1) comprising Pdr5/10/15p, cluster C contains three additional phylogenetic subclusters. Two of these subclusters show a

spectacular species-based clustering. Indeed, very similar
proteins tend to cluster with proteins belonging to the
same species rather than with orthologs in other species.
One of the subcluster (C3) comprises five DEHA members. The neighborhood analysis suggests a putative link
between DEHA2F16478g and the orthologs of YOL075c.
The other subcluster (C4) comprises four YALI members.
Neighborhood analysis of this subcluster is not conclusive
but phenotype analysis reveals that one of them
(YALI0C20265p) is an azole efflux transporter with properties similar to those of Pdr5p/Snq2p [32] while another
(YALI0E14729p) has the unique property to export C16
hydrocarbon residues [32].
The last subcluster (C2) contains five members:SAKL0C06996g, SAKL0C11704g, KLLA0D03476g as

Relationships between the PDR sensu stricto based on the neighborhood analysis. Each box represents a PDR gene.
Grey lines join PDR genes located on the same chromosome. When non-adjacent, the number of coding sequences between
two PDR genes is noted in white. Note that SAKL0C05654g, SAKL0C11616g and SAKL0C11704g are on the same chromosome.
Shared neighborhoods are represented by connectors whose colors match those of Figure 1. Two colors were used for SONS
b in order to distinguish the lineage of ZYRO0D17710g and the one of Snq2 and YNR070w. A large connector links PDR genes
sharing more than one common neighbor while a thin connector links PDR genes sharing one neighbor only. Dotted connectors link genes whose relationship is based on phylogenic evidence only. For the story leading to Pdr5/15 and Snq2, the percentage of identity with their homologs in the other species is given. The label WGD stands for Whole Genome Duplication.
Our representation does not imply that the present ERGO species is the ancestor of all the other species we analyzed.

well as ERGO0B08162g and ERGO0G05126g which are
very similar (73% amino acid identity). Three of them,
ERGO0B08162g, KLLA0D03476g and SAKL0C11704g are
in tandem gene array. Interestingly, they belong to the C
cluster (Pdr5p/10p/15p) when using phylogenetic criteria
but share some neighbors with the B cluster (Snq2p). This
is also the case of ZYRO0D17710g of the subcluster C1.
Cluster D (YOL075cp)
This cluster comprises a total of 7 members; one per species except in DEHA and ERGO. A spectacular shared
neighborhood presence is observed for the orthologs of
YOL075c (see Figure 2, SONS d). Eight common neigh-

bors are, for instance, identified in the post-WGD species
SACE and CAGL, four common neighbors are identified
in the pre-WGD species and four common neighbors link
ZYRO, one of the pre-WGD species to the post-WGD species. The YALI homologue (YALI0D25828p) has no conclusive neighborhood but it exhibits high amino acid
identity (41%) to the SACE YOL075cp. This suggests that
all hemiascomycetous orthologs of YOL075c originate
from an ancestor existent prior to the speciation event of
YALI.
The neighborhood analysis links a tandem gene array
made up of DEHA2F16478g and the fragment

DEHA2F16500g
to
cluster D.
However, the
DEHA2F16478g is classed in subcluster C3 by phylogeny
and does not display the specific motifs of YOL075cp
orthologs.
Cluster E (Aus1p/Pdr11p)
This cluster comprises members of four species only:
SACE, CAGL, SAKL and ERGO. Using neighborhood analysis, an ortholog of Aus1p was only identified in CAGL.
There is no evidence that the two SACE paralogs, Aus1p
on chromosome O and Pdr11p on chromosome I, issue
from the WGD as there is no shared neighborhood with
pre-WGD species. In SACE, both Aus1p and Pdr11p are
essential for anaerobic growth as they contribute to the
uptake of ergosterol under conditions which prevent the
aerobic synthesis of sterols [25]. The sterol transporter
function was recently demonstrated for the CAGL
ortholog of Aus1p [33]. The two characteristic Pdrp
motifs, N-terminal Walker A and the C-terminal ABC signature, remain, but only partially (Additional file 1).
Fragments
Six fragments of 72 to 1099 amino acids belonging to the
GL3C0025 protein family have been identified. Despite
their subtelomeric location, that we define as the last 30
kb of each chromosome following FAIRHEAD and DUJON
[34], the two fragments KLTH0E17138g and
KLTH0H00110g
share
the
neighborhood
of
KLTH0G19448g, the ortholog of Pdr5/15, which may suggest duplications followed by pseudogenization. Because
phylogenetic analysis of fragments may be error-prone,
their evolutionary significance will not be analyzed.

Discussion
Orthologous PDR transporters with typical NBF-TMSNBF-TMS topology are found in all higher fungi such as S.
cerevisiae [6,13], the hemiascomycetous human pathogen
C. albicans [35], Euascomycetes [36], Archiascomycetes
[37,38], Basidiomycetes [39] and all plants [40] including
Arabidopsis thaliana [41] and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia
[42]. In contrast, the PDR topology has not been detected
in protozoa [43] or chordates [44] where multiple drug
resistance results from the overexpression of MDR/MRP
efflux transporters of opposite TMS-NBF-TMS-NBF topology.
Our analysis of 56 full-sized Pdrp from 9 different Hemiascomycetes shows that the Génolevures subfamily
GL3C0025 [29] is subdivided into five phylogenetic clusters labeled A to E (Figure 1). Each of these clusters can be
characterized by its SACE members originally identified
by DECOTTIGNIES and GOFFEAU[13]. Within the phylogenetic Saccharomyces complex defined by KURTZMAN[28], a
total of 40 Pdrp homologs sharing significant chromosomal neighborhood were classified in seven SONS,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/459

labeled "a" to "g" (Figure 2), in which phylogenetic and
neighborhood data are combined.
It now appears that the Pdrp sensu stricto phenotype can be
allocated only to cluster A (Pdr12p), to cluster B (Snq2p/
YNR070wp) and to cluster C (Pdr5p/10p/15p), given that
all three share not only the NBF-TMS-NBF-TMS topology
but also the two additional Pdrp traits: efflux drug pumping and typical Walker A1 and ABC Signature 1 motifs.
On the other hand, no experimental information is available concerning the unknown substrates of the members
of cluster D (YOL075cp), while the SACE members of
cluster E (Aus1p/Pdr11p) are clearly sterol influx pumps
[25]. Moreover, as neither cluster D nor cluster E contains
members with the typical Pdrp motifs, they may be considered to be Pdrp sensu lato.
Our combined phylogenetic and neighborhood analyses
support the evolutionary pattern illustrated in Figure 3 for
the Pdrp sensu stricto of the Saccharomyces complex [28].
Pdr12p is a Pdr sensu stricto, according to our three criteria.
Its origin remains questionable as no Pdr12p neighbors
are shared either with Pdr5p/15p or Snq2p. In SACE, the
function of Pdr12p, which effluxes food preservatives
such as short chain weak acids [20], is different from that
of Snq2p and Pdr5p which share the function to efflux a
series of antifungal azoles and other hydrophobic substrates [17]. Nevertheless, the SACE Pdr12p sequence is
closer to SACE Snq2p (46%) than to SACE Pdr5p (38%).
This may suggest a common origin of both Pdr12p and
Snq2p clusters. The sequence analysis of new yeast species, phylogenetically situated between DEHA and ERGO,
should make it possible to disentangle the exact evolution
lineage.
The unlinked ancestor of Pdr5p/15p ohnologs of KLTH
jumped and triplicated on ZYRO chromosome D. An
ancestor of the three copies, already in this neighborhood,
was duplicated through WGD and produced Pdr5p and
Pdr15p in all Saccharomycetes.
The phylogenetic tree of the Pdr5p/15p clusters shows
several subclusters (C3 and C4) which aggregates members belonging to specific species such as DEHA or YALI.
These are cases where species-based clustering is suspected
of hindering a functional inference based on sequence
similarity only. For example, the subcluster C4 contains
four YALI members belonging to four different chromosomal fragments in unshared environments. Despite
being inside the same subcluster, theses genes seem to
have very different functions. One of them,
YALI0E14729g, exhibits the function of alkane efflux,
unique as yet, while another, YALI0C20265g, seems to

control the classic azole resistance function of the SACE
Pdr5p/15p pumps.
The evolutionary patterns of the Pdrp sensu lato are simpler and totally independent from that of the Pdr sensu
stricto. The members of Pdr sensu lato Aus1p/Pdr11p cluster are present in four different species only: ERGO, SAKL,
CAGL and SACE. These genes may be lost in other species.
Indeed, sterol influx pumps are essential only under
anaerobiosis conditions. However, no clear relation
between the presence of homologs of Aus1p or Pdr11p
sterol-influx pumps and facultative anaerobic growth
could be detected among the species composing the Saccharomyces complex [45].
The members of the Pdr sensu lato YOL075c cluster are of
unknown function and belong to species of both ancestral
clade (YALI0D25828g) and recent clades. No homolog of
YOL075c is found in DEHA and ERGO. Extensive neighborhood preservation is observed for all Kluyveromycetes
and Saccharomycetes species. Even though the substrates of
this cluster of putative transporters are unknown, its continued presence in many pre- and post-WGD species from
the Saccharomyces complex indicates that these gene products exert an important physiological function. This function and the subcellular localization of the transporter
have not yet been determined. Curiously all members of
the YOL075c SONS have at least 100 less amino acid residues (1247 to 1328) than all other members of the
GL3C0025 family. Moreover, the cysteine of SGCT motif
of the N-Walker A is replaced by the "classic" lysine residue and the NVEQ motif of the C-Walker Signature is
replaced by SGGE (Additional file 1).
In three cases only, we observed a divergence between the
neighborhood
and
phylogenetic
analyses.
ERGO0B08162g, KLLA0D03476g and SAKL0C11704g are
allocated to the C cluster (Pdr5p/15p) by phylogeny and
to the SONS b (Snq2p/YNR070wp) by neighborhood.
This divergence can be explained by the fact that they
belong to a tandem gene array in which a copy has been
subjected to neofunctionalization. In another case,
ZYRO0D17710g (subcluster C1) is allocated to SONS b
(Snq2p/YNR070wp) by neighborhood. Its high amino
acid similarity with Pdr5p (70%) and significant difference
of
sequence
with
SAKL0C11704g
and
ZYRO0A04114g suggest an evolution based on gene conversion with one of the member of the ZYRO0D11836g,
ZYRO0D11858g and ZYRO0D11880g tandem gene array.
Finally, the divergence observed for DEHA2F16478g (subcluster C3 and SONS d) may be linked to a species-based
clustering of DEHA genes within the subcluster C3.

Conclusion
In order to assess the evolution of genes using a neighbourhood analysis, we considered four more species in
addition to those examined in the study by Gbelska et al.
[23]. Our classification is consistent for the 24 genes in the
five species we share with Gbelska et al. Moreover, the
additional species enabled us to follow more accurately
the evolution of the chromosomal environments of the
Pdrp and to distinguish between paralogous and orthologous status, and, in so doing, clarify the fate of some
ERGO and KLLA genes. We found that some orthology
relationships are confused by SYNERGY [23,46] (see
Additional file 4). Our analysis converged with the Yeast
Gene Order Browser [30], except for the orthology relationship of the two members of the KLLA tandem gene
array which are inverted in the YGOB.
We demonstrate that, combined with phylogenetic analysis, neighborhood analysis allows us to trace back the
detailed evolutionary history of most members of the
phylogenetic subfamilies of Pdrp sensu stricto from SACE,
CAGL, ZYRO, KLTH, SAKL, KLLA and ERGO. These species span 6 out of the 14 clades from the phylogenic Saccharomyces complex [28] that may have separated from the
other yeasts around 150 million years ago. We may therefore conclude that Pdr5p and Pdr15p issued from a single
ancestral gene present before the WGD. In contrast, both
Pdr10p (a Pdr5p paralog) and YNR070wp (a Snq2p paralog) originated from independent post-WGD duplication
events.
We show that for a large subfamily such as Pdrp, whose
members share high amino acid sequence similarity,
neighborhood analysis can be used to trace the duplicates
from pre-WGD or post-WGD and to describe in detail the
tandem or repeat duplications and the gains, loss or transposition of gene copies.

Methods
Pdrp
Protein sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SACE),
Candida glabrata (CAGL), Zygosaccharomyces rouxii
(ZYRO), Kluyveromyces thermotolerans (KLTH), Saccharomyces kluyveri (SAKL), Kluyveromyces lactis (KLLA), Eremothecium gossypii (ERGO), Debaryomyces hansenii
(DEHA) and Yarrowia lipolytica (YALI) were retrieved from
the Génolevures database in July 2007. A bioinformatics
analysis based on BLAST and Smith-Waterman alignments, clustering and Condorcet election, was applied to
the Génolevures data set by NIKOLSKI and SHERMAN[47] in
order to define consensus families. All SACE Pdrp were
found to belong to a single family, the GLC2004, recently
relabeled GL3C0025. This family comprises 62 members
(Table 1). Six peptides of 72 to 1099 amino acid residues
were considered as fragments, leaving 56 full-sized mem-

revisions from AG and PB. All authors read and approved
the final manuscript edited by M-LS.

Principle of assignation to SONS
Within the Génolevures GLC3C0025 family, the Subsets
of Orthologs by Neighborhood and Similarity (SONS)
were identified as schematized in Additional files 2 and 3.
Fifteen neighbor genes were retrieved on each side of the
62 PDR (called "query gene"). Each of these 30 genes is
assigned to a Génolevures family. As family assignment is
based on similarity criteria, neighbor genes belonging to
the same GL family were considered orthologs by similarity. Two PDR query genes, sharing at least one neighbor
being classified in the same GL family, were regarded as
belonging to the same SONS. Indeed, in this case, the
orthology based on similarity evidences is confirmed by
the neighborhood information. Out of the 62 Pdrp, 40
show informative neighborhoods. Due to the complexity
of the PDR evolutionary history, the SONS were manually
curated to remove some weak links between chromosomal environments. The curated output of the SONS
analysis is presented in Figure 2. For the sake of clarity, the
representation is limited to five neighbor genes on each
side of the query PDR genes. In fact, no conclusive neighborhood could be identified in the DEHA or YALI species.
Therefore all neighbor analyses of Figure 2 excluded
DEHA and YALI and were restricted to the seven species
we examined from the Saccharomycetes complex defined
by KURTZMAN [28], except one DEHA gene in SONS d.

Additional material

Motifs
The Pdrp sequences were aligned with ClustalW [49] on
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/ and visualized with
Jalview [50]. The N- Walker A and C-terminal ABC signature motifs were identified based on alignments with the
motifs defined by DECOTTIGNIES and GOFFEAU[13] for the
Pdrp of S. cerevisiae. Identity was calculated after removing
the filter for low complexity.
Phylogenetic Tree
Multiple alignment was calculated by MUSCLE [51]. The
phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 was constructed using PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR in the PHYLIP suite [52]. The use
of Maximum likelihood (PROTML) or parsimony
approach gave identical results. Only NEIGHBOR JOINING results are, therefore, presented. Representation of
the phylogenetic tree made use of the Dendroscope application [53].

Steps of the Identification of Orthologs by Neighborhood and Similarity method. (1) The building of SONS (Subset of Orthologs defined by
Neighborhood and Similarity) begins by taking a family of genes whose
translation products show sequence similarity for example, the family
GL3C0025. (2) For each query gene of this family we identify 15 genes,
which we call neighbors, on each side and especially the family to which
these neighbors belong. (3) Two query genes whose translation products
belong to the same family (homologs by similarity) are members of the
same SONS if they share at least one pair of neighbors that are also
homologous to each other by similarity. These neighbors are highlighted in
the same color. In the example, YOL075c shares some neighbors with the
query gene of CAGL and has one neighbor in common with the query gene
of KLTH. CAGL has no gene in common with KLTH, however YOL075c
must be in the same SONS as the query genes of CAGL and KLTH. In
consequence, the three query genes are clustered in the same SONS.
Homologs that do not share a pair of homologous neighbors are separated
into two distinct SONS. (4) See Figure 2 SONS d for the complete SONS
of YOL075c.
