Abstract
Background: Bottle gourd [Lagenaria siceraria (Mol.) Standl.] is an important cucurbit crop worldwide.
Archaeological research indicates that bottle gourd was domesticated more than 10,000 years ago, making it one
of the earliest plants cultivated by man. In spite of its widespread importance and long history of cultivation
almost nothing has been known about the genome of this species thus far.
Results: We report here the partial sequencing of bottle gourd genome using the 454 GS-FLX Titanium
sequencing platform. A total of 150,253 sequence reads, which were assembled into 3,994 contigs and 82,522
singletons were generated. The total length of the non-redundant singletons/assemblies is 32 Mb, theoretically
covering ~ 10% of the bottle gourd genome. Functional annotation of the sequences revealed a broad range of
functional types, covering all the three top-level ontologies. Comparison of the gene sequences between bottle
gourd and the model cucurbit cucumber (Cucumis sativus) revealed a 90% sequence similarity on average. Using
the sequence information, 4395 microsatellite-containing sequences were identified and 400 SSR markers were
developed, of which 94% amplified bands of anticipated sizes. Transferability of these markers to four other
cucurbit species showed obvious decline with increasing phylogenetic distance. From analyzing polymorphisms of
a subset of 14 SSR markers assayed on 44 representative China bottle gourd varieties/landraces, a principal
coordinates (PCo) analysis output and a UPGMA-based dendrogram were constructed. Bottle gourd accessions
tended to group by fruit shape rather than geographic origin, although in certain subclades the lines from the
same or close origin did tend to cluster.
Conclusions: This work provides an initial basis for genome characterization, gene isolation and comparative
genomics analysis in bottle gourd. The SSR markers developed would facilitate marker assisted breeding schemes
for efficient introduction of desired traits.

Background
Bottle gourd [Lagenaria siceraria (Mol.) Standl.] (2n =
2x = 22), also known as calabash or opo squash, is a
diploid belonging to the genus Lagenaria of the Cucurbitaceae family [1]. Phylogenetically, bottle gourd is
close to many economically important cucurbit species
including cucumber and melon that belong to the genus
of Cucumis, as well as watermelon that belong to the
genus Citrullus. Worldwide, bottle gourd is grown for

its fruit either being harvested young and used as a
vegetable or harvested mature and used as a bottle,
utensil, or pipe. The fresh fruit, which usually has a
light green smooth skin and a white flesh, is frequently
used in many regions of Asia and Africa as either a stirfry or soup vegetable ingredient [2]. Another recent utilization of bottle gourd is as rootstocks for watermelon
against soil-borne diseases and low soil temperature
[3,4].
Bottle gourd was one of the first crops to be domesticated. Based on archaeological evidence, bottle gourd is
presumed to have been domesticated in Africa [5,6], and
might have dispersed to the New World by ocean

currents or by human migration in pre-historic times
[7,8]. Africa is believed to be the centre of genetic diversity for bottle gourd, although wild progenitors of bottle
gourd have not been identified there [6]. Substantial
morphological variation for fruit and seed size, shape,
color and rind hardness exists in the bottle gourd gene
pool [8-10]. Yetisir et al. observed a wide range of morphological variation among Turkish bottle gourd accessions despite the fact that this region is not a center of
origin of the crop [11].
At present, very few molecular genetic/genomic
resources are publically available for bottle gourd. Achigan-Dako et al. measured the genome size of bottle
gourd and showed that the nuclear 2C-value of DNA was
around 0.734 pg, which is estimated to be equal to ~ 334
Mb [12]. In spite of the relatively small genome size of
bottle gourd, there are only dozens of bottle gourd DNA
sequences available in the public DNA database, making
it unfeasible to identify bottle gourd genes or to analyze
their functions. A limited number of anonymous random
amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers have been
described [10,13], but there has been no locus specific
DNA markers such as microsatellite (SSR), sequence
tagged site (STS) or single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) markers available for bottle gourd so far. Also
unclear is the extent of genome conservation/diversification between bottle gourd and other important cucurbit
species such as the model cucumber (Cucumis sativus
L.), which serves as the basis for comparative genomic
analysis across cucurbit species.
Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are
short repeat motifs usually associated with a high level
of frequency of length polymorphism. With the advantages of being stable, PCR-based and relatively low-cost,
SSR markers are one of the best choices for genetic
research and molecular breeding. SSR markers can be
developed, in case of the availability of large number of
DNA sequences, in silico [14], or experimentally [15].
Traditionally, the experimental approach requires the
construction of a genomic library enriched for repeated
motifs, hybridization and isolation of microsatellite containing clones, sequencing of positive clones and primer
design [16]. Most of these steps, especially the hybridization/isolation step, are expensive and time-consuming.
Recent emerging ‘next generation’ sequencing technique,
for instance, the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX (GS-FLX
Titanium) shotgun System (Roche, Penzberg, Germany),
provides a powerful alternative for generating a tremendous number of DNA sequences for genomics study
and marker development. Instead of creating a conventional genomic library enriched for microsatellites, GSFLX Titanium system sequences a shotgun library in a
high-throughput manner, producing tens of thousands
of reads around 300-400 bp. By mining the sequence

reads, SSR-containing sequences can be identified. Using
this technology, we partially sequenced the bottle gourd
genome. Through assembling and annotating the
sequence reads, tens of thousands of genes with broad
range of functional types were recognized. Moreover,
hundreds of microsatellite markers were developed
using the sequencing data, which are invaluable in
future marker assisted breeding and phylogeny analysis.
The markers were then applied to a range of bottle
gourd accessions to assess genetic diversity to enable
more efficient parental line selection for breeding purposes and to dissect the genetic factors underlying morphological variations.

Methods
Plant materials

Forty-four accessions representing geographically and
phenotypically different bottle gourd germplasm in
China were used in this study (Figure 1; Table 1). The
bottle gourd accession used for GS-FLX Titanium
sequencing is ‘Hangzhou gourd’, a landrace from southern China. One accession of each of the following four
cucurbits i.e. bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.),
loofah [Luffa acutangula (L.) Roxb], pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) and watermelon [Citrullus lanatus
(Thunb.)] were also used.
DNA extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from leaves of two-weekold seedlings using a modified CTAB method [17].
DNA library construction and sequencing

To construct DNA library for GS-FLX Titanium
sequencing, 5 mg of genomic DNA were fragmented
into 300-800 bp by nebulization. Short adaptors were
then ligated to the 3’ and 5’ ends. Emulsion PCR
(emPCR) was carried out at a concentration of 1 copy
per bead in six emulsion oils, to give 43,800 enriched
beads. Amplified fragments were sequenced on 1/4th of
an LR70 plate. The reads from GS-FLX Titanium
sequencing were assembled with the software Newbler
(http://rcc.uga.edu/software/app/newbler_GS_De_Novo_Assembler/) under default parameters.
Functional annotation of genes and gene ontology
analysis

Functional annotation of the sequences was performed
by BLAST × search against the NCBI no-redundant (nr)
protein database using the assembled contigs/singletons
as queries. The cut-off value for significance was set as
e-10. A putative gene ontology and functional category
were obtained on the basis of GO Consortium (http://
www.geneontology.org/) by BLAST2GO (http://www.
blast2go.de).

Alignment of gene sequences between genomes

The cucumber genome sequence was downloaded from
Phytozome (ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/JGI_data/phytozome/v6.0/Csativus/). A total of 16,135 bottle gourd
contigs/singletons, which were functionally annotable
under an E-value < e-10 and thus were considered originated from the gene space of the genome, were compared with the cucumber genome sequence by BLAST
N under an E-value threshold of e-10 in at least 100 bp
overlap. For comparison of the Cryptochrome 1 molecular clock marker genes and the UDP-glucosyltransferase
genes among species, each gene sequence was download
from Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) under the
accession numbers of AB073546.1 (OsCRY1a, rice),
EF601539.1 (TaCRY1a, wheat), AB498928.1 (GmCRY1,
soybean), FE690583.1 (PvCRY1, common bean) or from
the cucurbit unigene database (http://www.icugi.org/cgibin/ICuGI/EST/home.cgi?organism=melon) under the
accession number of MU45735 (CmCRY1, melon) and
MU59780 (UDP-glucosyltransferase gene, melon), with
the exception of cucumber CRY1 and UDP-glucosyltransferase genes, whose sequences were extracted from
the cucumber genome database [18].
Microsatellites mining, primer design and SSR assay

The assembled contigs/singletons sequences were
screened for perfect microsatellites using the software
mreps 2.5 (http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/mreps/) [19]. The software Websat (http://wsmartins.net/websat/) was used to

design primers flanking SSRs [20]. Only sequences containing SSRs equal to or longer than 20 bp were used
for primer design. The procedure of SSR assay followed
Xu et al. [14].
Analysis of genetic diversity

The alleles present in each genotype were scored
visually for each SSR locus. Number of alleles and allele
frequency per locus were calculated manually. The computer program PIC_Calc 0.6 (http://www.esnips.com/
doc/9171097b-ac41-424a-9d35-e7d4e540ec9f/Picalc) was
used to measure the polymorphism information content
(PIC) value for each SSR locus under the formula PIC =
1-ΣPij2, where Pij is the frequency of jth allele of the ith
locus [21]. Calculation of Nei’s genetic distance (D A )
and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) were performed with NTSYSpc 2.10 [22]. A dendrogram showing relatedness among the 44 bottle gourd accessions
were constructed using the unweighted pair-group
method (UPGMA) based on the information of DA.

Results
Summary of the GS-FLX sequencing data

A ¼ run on the GS-FLX system generated 150,253 reads
that passed the quality filters, giving a total length of
56,368,975 bp. The length of individual reads ranged
from 23 bp to 700 bp, with an average of 375.2 bp. The
majority of the read lengths fell between 350 bp and
500 bp. These sequences then were assembled into

long contigs (> 2 kb) that were found from a chloroplast/mitochondrial origin, 3,994 contigs ranging from

and 82,522 singletons ranging from 23 bp to 649 bp

Functional annotation of the sequences

BLAST × search against the NCBI GenBank peptide
database performed using the 3,994 sequence assemblies
and 82,522 singletons resulted in 18,033 annotated
sequences under an E-value threshold of e -10 . After
removing putative plastid/mitochondrial sequences and
retrotransposon/transposon elements, 16,135 ‘clean’
sequences were maintained. The lengths of the annotated sequences varied from 105 bp to 1,873 bp. Of
these, 11,216 (69%) hit a gene function as hypothetical/
predicted proteins or unknown/unnamed proteins while
4,919 (31%) sequences had known putative gene function annotations (Additional file 1).
Functional assignments for the 4,919 sequences with
putative gene function annotations covered all three
top-level ontologies i.e. cellular component, biological
process and molecular function. Among those sequences
that fell into the functional classification of molecular
function, the largest categories were binding (40.8%),
followed by catalytic activity (39.1%). In the class of biological process, cellular processing formed the major
category (22.5%). Cell part (31.4%) is the dominant
group of the cellular component classification (Figure 2).
Conservation of gene sequences between bottle gourd
and cucumber

To estimate the extent of sequence conservation
between the gene spaces of bottle gourd and the model
cucurbit cucumber, we compared 16,135 bottle gourd
contigs/singletons that were assigned a functional annotation with the newly available cucumber genome
sequence. BLAST N result showed that 13,370 bottle
gourd sequences matched the cucumber genome in at
least 100 bp overlap (Additional file 2). As expected,
most of the matched sequences occur in the exon
regions, giving an average sequence identity value of as
high as 90.3%. Six hundred and fourteen bottle gourd
sequences (4.6%) had more than 95% identity with
cucumber, while 1252 sequences (9.4%) showed

relatively low sequence conservation (less than 85%
identity). Notably, we found that the gene Cryprochrome
1 (CRY1), which encodes a blue light receptor ubiquitous throughout the plant kingdom and that is frequently used phylogenic molecular clock marker [23,24],
showed an identity value of as high as 93.5% in the conserved C-terminus DAS domains between the two species, demonstrating that the two species are
phylogenetically very close. Another conserved plant
gene, the UDP-glucosyltransferase gene, showed 85%
sequence identity between bottle gourd and cucumber
and a much higher sequence identity between melon
and cucumber (93%, see discussion below).
Characterization of microsatellites in bottle gourd

A search against the sequenced bottle gourd genome for
microsatellite-containing sequences hit 201 positive contigs and 3815 singletons at the threshold of SSR length
≥ 20 bp, harboring a total of 4395 discrete microsatellites. Of these, dinucleotide and dekanucleotide repeats
are the most abundant, each accounting for ~13% of the
total number. Trinucleotide repeats is also abundant,
while mononucleotide and pentanucleotide repeats are
relatively rare (Table 3). The length of the majority of
the SSRs ranged from 20 to 56 nucleotides, with the
longest up to 244 nucleotides. The number of repeat
units varied between 2 and 122. Of the dominant dinucleotide and dekanucleotide repeats, AT/AT and
TTCTCTCTCT/AGAGAGAGAA are the most frequent
types of motif. AAT/ATT, TTTA/TAAA and AAAA
AT/ATTTTT are the most common tri-, tetra- and
hexa- nucleotide repeats, respectively (Figure 3). Clearly,
AT rich repeats take up the majority of the microsatellites longer than 20 bp in the bottle gourd genome.
Around 32% of the non-redundant microsatellite-containing sequences were suitable for design of flanking
PCR primers. The rest of the microsatellite-containing
sequences were less useful in primer development
because the microsatellites were too close to fragment
ends to enable design of flanking PCR primers. We
designed 400 SSR markers (Additional file 3) from the
contigs/singletons sequences and tested the

with anticipated sizes (data not shown), demonstrating a
high fidelity and efficiency for large scale SSR marker
development by the GS-FLX sequencing approach.
Transferability of the microsatellite markers across
species

To test the usefulness of the newly developed microsatellite markers in other understudied cucurbit species,
we investigated their transferability to four other cucurbits, i.e. bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.), loofah
[Luffa acutangula (L.) Roxb], pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo
L.) and watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)] by
amplification with 200 primer pairs (LSR001-LSR200).
Relatively low cross-species SSR transferability was
observed except that between bottle gourd and

Benincasinae, and, as expected, rate of marker transferability showed significant decline with increasing phylogenetic distance (Table 4). Using genomic sequences
from non-expressed regions may partially account for
the low marker transferability across species.
Genetic diversity of 44 Chinese bottle gourd accessions
as assessed by SSR markers

Fourteen primer pairs that detected polymorphisms in
at least two of the four selected bottle gourd lines, i.e.
‘Long gourd’, ‘Longyan April gourd’, ‘Nanxiu’ and
‘Yongzhen No. 1’ (data not shown) were used to genotype 44 entries of Chinese bottle gourd accessions
(Table 1). A total of 51 alleles with two to eight alleles
per locus were detected among the accessions, providing
an average allele number of 3.64 per locus. The overall
polymorphism information content (PIC) value varied
from 0.11 to 0.72 with an average of 0.4 (Table 5).
A two-dimensional principal coordinates analysis
(PCoA) did not detect significant subgrouping among
the 44 lines, while the tendency of certain accessions to
congregate together still can be observed (Figure 4).
This distribution of the cultivars/landraces in general
showed an association with fruit shape rather than geographic origin. For example, accessions with pyriform
and tubby fruit formed a cluster in the upper right and
upper left corners, respectively, while two round-fruited
accessions clustered in the lower right corner. The rest
of the accessions exhibited a scattered distribution along
the two axes. Consistent with this, the dendrogram constructed from UPGMA analysis showed three major
groups, which in general corresponds to the three clusters revealed by PCoA (Figure 5). The smallest group

(group III) consisted of the two lines (No. 1 and 17)
with round fruits. Lines in Group I were all landraces
with a pyriform fruit except for ‘Nanxiu’ (No. 12), which
is a commercial cultivar popular in central China with a
slender straight fruit. Group II, the biggest class, consisted of 25 accessions with a slender straight fruit and
7 tubby-fruited accessions with six of the latter showed
a clustered distribution in the dendrogram (Figure 5).
Even though no strong association was observed
between the subgrouping and geographic origin of these
accessions, cultivars or landraces sharing the same or
close origins still tend to be clustered together in certain

from Zhejiang province, a center of cultivation of bottle
gourd in China were clustered together in group II (Figure 5).

Discussion
Through partial sequencing of the genome via the 454
GS-FLX Titanium sequencing platform, we were able to
rapidly generate DNA sequence recourses for molecular
marker development and genomic inquiry in bottle
gourd, an ‘orphan crop’ for which few genomic
resources have been developed thus far. Tens of

thousands of sequences with putative functional annotation were identified, which will allow primer design or
probe development for gene expression analysis, microarray assay, in silico cloning of the genes, as well as
comparative analysis among cucurbits. The availability
of bottle gourd genome sequences will be helpful to get
a better understanding of some bottle gourd or

cucurbits specific traits. For example, the sequences
information will facilitate the identification of genes
responsible for the highly efficient water transport system that is characteristic to bottle gourd and other
cucurbits [25], and the hunt for genes related to the bitter taste-causing cucurbitacins biosynthetic pathway in
cucurbits [26,27].
We provided the first insight of genome conservation/
diversification between bottle gourd and the model
cucurbit cucumber. We showed that the extent of gene
space conservation between the two species is as high as
90%, demonstrating a close relationship between bottle
gourd and cucumber. This is consistent with the result
from analyzing the CRY1 molecular clock gene, which
showed a 93% sequence identity between the two species in the C-terminus DAS domain. This value is higher
than that between rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum estivum) (69.4%), two related Poaceae species, and
even higher than between the warm season legumes
soybean (Glycine max) and common bean (Phaseolus
vulgaris) (88%), indicating again that bottle gourd and
cucumber are phylogenetically very close. However, the
value is lower than that between melon (Cucumis melo)
and cucumber (95%), which is consistent with the current phylogeny of cucurbits [28]. Similar results were
obtained from analyzing the UDP-glucosyltransferase
genes, where a much higher level of sequence identity
was observed between melon/cucumber (93%) than

between bottle gourd/cucumber (82%). Assay of SSR
markers transferability across different cucurbit species
also supported the known phylogeny and demonstrated
that the bottle gourd SSR markers could be selectively
used for watermelon (41% amplification rate), and loofah (20% amplification rate) if necessary, due to their
relatively higher cross-species transferability.
Another direct use of the sequencing information is to
develop large number of microsatellite markers for marker-assisted breeding. The quick generation of over
150,000 sequence entries that enabled development of
thousands of SSR markers within only 1 week at low
cost is far superior to the traditional, hybridization and
Sanger sequencing based method [15,29] in terms of
time, labor and other costs. The GS-FLX Titanium system was chosen because it generates longer sequence
length (~ 400 bp) per read than most other next generation sequencing systems, which is important for the subsequent design of SSR primers flanking the
microsatellite motifs. We identified 4395 SSRs longer
than 20 bp from the non-redundant 32 Mb bottle gourd
genome sequence, which provides a frequency of 1 SSR
per ~7.3 Kb. This frequency is nearly double the estimation from cucumber (1 SSR per ~14.6 Kb) using 3x
shotgun genome sequencing data [30], and demonstrates
that SSRs could serve as a rich source for marker development in bottle gourd. The high frequency of dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats is consistent with the
situation in most other plant species including the
cucurbits cucumber and watermelon [29-31]; however,
the significantly high portion of dekanucleotide repeats
could be a feature of the bottle gourd genome although
dekanucleotide repeats is also common in other plant
genomes such as cowpea [31]. The AT-rich nature of
the microsatellite motifs is conserved between bottle
gourd and cucumber [30].
A dendrogram established based on SSR genotyping of
44 representative China bottle gourd cultivars/landraces
didn’t detect obvious clustering by geographical location,
which is in agreement with Yetisir et al. in which clustering of bottle gourd accessions from Turkey was based
around fruit morphology much more than on geographical origin [11]. Founder effects followed by assortive
mating, i.e. the original introduction of only limited
genetic diversity within fruit types, followed by matings
mostly within fruit types, would lead to the patterns of
genetic diversity observed. This is supported by the relatively high genetic similarity observed among the bottle
gourd lines, which varied between 51.2% and 94.3%.
Decker-Walters et al. (2001) characterized 74 landraces/
cultivars from a global sample and revealed that the
lines from diverse origins (Africa, Asia and the New
World) were readily separated [10]. Consistent with the
result from Morimoto et al. (2005), fruit shape was

Page 9 of 10

found a principal component of the variation and is in
general associated with the grouping of the lines based
on molecular markers [8]. Our results indicate that
China bottle gourd germplasm could be divided into
three major groups in terms of fruit shape, i.e. slender
straight, tubby and round, although the variation of fruit
shape is quantitative. Heiser proposed that bottle gourd
plants producing large round fruits are typically native
to tropical West Africa, whereas the long, thin, snakelike fruits are considered to be of Asian origin [9]. This,
if true, is indicative of a mixed origin of Chinese bottle
gourd germplasm. The presence of the pyriform and
tubby fruit lines, which are considered an intermediate
type, could be indicative of natural or artificial hybridization between the two ancient cultivar groups. Relatively recent human migration events and recent
germplasm introduction activities may further blur the
patterns of diversity as revealed by the imperfect association between the morphology of the lines and their
grouping.

Conclusions
We report here the generation of 454 GS-FLX Titanium
sequencing data of the bottle gourd genome and its
application to SSR marker discovery and genetic diversity analysis. The sequence information will allow characterization of the bottle gourd genome, facilitate gene
isolation and comparative genomics analysis across species. The SSR markers developed will enable marker
assisted breeding of bottle gourd, while the characterization of patterns of diversity among representative China
bottle gourd accessions will facilitate the optimal use of
genetic resources for breeding. In the near future, with
more and more genome sequence information of other
cucurbits becoming available [18,32], soon it will be feasible to draw deeper and clearer insights into genome
conservation/diversification among related crop cucurbit
species.
