Abstract
The first workshop towards the control of cestode zoonoses in Asia and Africa was held in Asahikawa Medical
University, Japan on 15 and 16 Feb 2011. This meeting was fully supported by the Asian Science and Technology
Strategic Cooperation Promotion Programs sponsored by the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science
and Technology, the Ministry of Education Japan (MEXT) for 3 years from 2010 to Akira Ito. A total of 24
researchers from 9 countries joined together and discussed the present situation and problems towards the
control of cestode zoonoses. As the meeting was simultaneously for the establishment of joint international, either
bilateral or multilateral collaboration projects, the main purposes were directed to 1) how to detect taeniasis/
cysticercosis infected patients, 2) how to differentiate Taenia solium from two other human Taenia species,
T. saginata and T. asiatica, 3) how to evaluate T. asiatica based on the evidence of hybrid and hybrid-derived adult
tapeworms from Thailand and China, 4) how to evaluate T. solium and T. hyaenae and other Taenia species from
the wild animals in Ethiopia, and 5) how to detect echinococcosis patients and 6) how to differentiate
Echinococcus species worldwide. Such important topics are summarized in this meeting report.
History
The coordinator, Akira Ito at Asahikawa Medical University (AMU) organized a symposium on cysticercosis at
the 3 rd Seminar on Food-borne Parasitic Zoonoses in
Bangkok, 2000 [1]. From 2003, Akira Ito was recommended to establish leadership in science and technology
in Asia through his research on cestode zoonoses by a
special Japanese Governmental fund for three year project (2003-2005). Akira Ito set up an international symposium every year [2] and seminars for the transfer of
technology through joint research projects on cestode
zoonoses mainly in Asia and some in Africa. The first
seminar was held in AMU from 17 Jan until 2 Feb 2004.
We invited 10 guests from Inodonesia (4), Thailand (3),
China (3) with international consultants from USA (Peter
M Schantz, CDC), Australia (David D Jenkins, the President of Australian Society for Parasitologists) and UK
(Philip S Craig, University of Salford, the coordinator for

the WHO informal Working Group on Echinococcosis).
The second one was held from 14 Sept until 1 Oct 2004.
We invited 7 guests from Cameroon (2), Nepal (2),
Vietnam (1), Philippines (1) and Australia (1). The third
one was held from 17 Jan until 2 Feb 2006. Nine guests
were from China (4), Indonesia (2), Philippines (1), Thailand (1) and France (1). The biggest program was to
organize the international symposium entitled “Taeniasis/cysticercosis and echinococcosis with focus on Asia
and the Pacific” held in the Asahikawa Grand Hotel on
5-8 July 2005. The proceedings of this meeting were published as a supplement of Parasitology International in
2006 [3]. All participants were invited to join together in
Asahikawa with full support for travel expenses including
air tickets, accommodation and living expenses. Approximately 100 researchers from 30 countries, including
Japan, participated. Approximately 80 participants were
foreign guests including experts from WHO, FAO and
CDC. After this 3 year project, we received another 3
year project for the establishment of the reference center
for cestode zoonoses in Asia and Africa from the Japan

Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) twice continuously (2006-2008, 2009-2011). Akira Ito organized
international symposia in Bangkok (2006) at JITMM2006
[4], Okinawa (2007) at the 21st Pacific Science Congress
[5-9], Cheju at 17th ICTMM (2008), Bangkok (2009) at
JITMM2009, Bangkok (2010) at JITMM2010. In 2011,
we also expect to organize it in Bangkok at JITMM2011.
These symposia are the major subjects sponsored by
JSPS fund from 2006 until 2011.
From 2010, Akira Ito has been recommended to start
a special project entitled “Development of molecular
and immunological tools for detection of neglected cestode zoonoses” from the Ministry of Education, Japan
(MEXT) for three years. This special fund is mainly for
development of international collaborative research
based on the establishment of the network by the JSPS
fund.

Report
The first Workshop and seminar for the transfer of
technology through joint projects

From 15 February 2011, we organized the first workshop
of this new project and also simultaneously started seminars for the transfer of technology through collaboration
for 3 weeks. In this report, we would like to introduce
what we have been doing through this new project sponsored by the Japanese Government. A total of 23 participants including two PhD students from Cameroon and
Iran studying at AMU, joined together from 15 Feb 2011
at AMU. Guests were from China (2), Mongolia (3),
Thailand (2), Indonesia (3), Ethiopia (2), Finland (1) and
Japan including AMU staff (8).
On 15 and 16 Feb 2011, we had the first workshop with
an observer, Takashi Nishigaki, the project coordinator
head from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST),
Ministry of Education (MEXT), Japan. After Akira Ito’s
brief welcoming remarks stressing that “We live together
and share the science, technology and philosophy to do
joint projects for control of cestode zoonoses”, Tiaoying
Li and Xingwang Chen from Chengdu, China introduced
the present problems of taeniasis/cysticercosis in
Sichuan, China with an excellent general overview of taeniasis/cysticercosis [10] and made very clear what they
wanted to do on this topic in AMU: 1) seroepidemiology
of cysticercosis where we had previously confirmed
taeniasis/cysticercosis of Taenia solium, taeniasis of both
T. saginata and T. asiatica in the past several years, 2)
molecular identification of 51 tapeworms collected in
October 2010 through the joint project with the Japanese
team (Akira Ito, Munehiro Okamoto, Minoru Nakao,
Tetsuya Yanagida, Agathe Nkouawa) and international
consultants (Patrick Giraudoux, Francis Raoul from
France and Philip S Craig from UK), 3) copro-PCR for
150 stool samples and 4) cysticerci collected from 16 pigs

during the new year 2011 to detect hybrid metacestodes
of T. saginata and T. asiatica, and 5) discuss the strategy
for transmission ecology of cysticercosis from taeniaisis
using GIS [6] which we have been doing as multilateral
joint project in China (China, France, UK and Japan)
using Japanese funds, with the aim of establishing the
current transmission model of T. solium in Tibetan communities of Sichuan, China. Hybrid and hybrid-derived
tapeworms were already confirmed not only from Thailand [11] but also from China (Yamane et al. in prep.;
Nkouawa et al. in prep.).
The second speaker was Toni Wandra. He overviewed
the present situation of taeniasis/cysticercosis in Indonesia.
Taeniasis of T. saginata was rather common but cysticercosis of T. solium was very rare and sporadic in Bali,
whereas taeniasis/cysticercosis of T. solium was still very
common in Papua [12-16] and T. asiatica was not so rare
in Sumatra [12]. Nyoman S Dharmawan presented serological studies of bovine cysticercosis experimentally
infected with eggs of T. saginata. This is one of the joint
projects with Munehiro Okamoto and Akira Ito. Kadek I
Swastika presented an important topic from Karang Asem,
northeastern part of Bali, where an Indonesian and Japanese joint team worked from 17 until 21 Jan 2011. His
main purpose was 1) to investigate serology for people
from Karang Asem, and 2) for people randomly taken in
Wamena, Papua in July 2010, and 3) undertake molecular
identification of Taenia samples from both Papua and Bali
and also 4) confirm molecular and serological confirmation of one ocular cysticercosis in Bali.
Paron Dekumyoy and Teera Kusolsuk from Thailand
focused on taeniasisis/cysticercosis in the border between
Thailand and Myanmar [17,18] and reported 4 day field
work in Tak province with Munehiro Okamoto and
Akira Ito from 5 to 8 Feb 2011, just a few days before
this seminar in Asahikawa. His colleagues and the Japanese participants performed microscopy of 150 stool
samples and found taeniid eggs from 6 people. So, the
main work was to identify the eggs by multiplex PCR and
LAMP and do the same work using stool samples.
Abmed Davaajav and Anu Davaasuren from Mongolia
summarized taeniasis cases in Mongolia [19]. The main
purpose of this project was 1) molecular identification of
Taenia spp. using multiplex PCR and compare it with
copro LAMP, and 2) serodiagnosis for several CE cases.
Temuulen Dorjsuren summarized echinococcosis in
Mongolia [20,21]. Her main purpose was 1) molecular
identification of G1 and G6 genotypes of Echinococcus
granulosus sensu lato using approximately 50 CE cases
and 2) confirm additional one AE case, and 3) serology
for both CE and AE. These samples were provided from
many collaborators in Ulaanbaatar through Akira Ito’s
continuous effort to establish a better network for all
researchers involved in echinococcosis join together. It

Ito et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:114
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/114

was encouraging to hear that Mongolian researchers
from different institutions joined together for the
“Echinococcosis Working Group in Mongolia” [20,21].
Sissay M Mekonnen from Ethiopia summarized
human taeniasis and taxonomy of Taenia from wild animals in Ethiopia. His main purpose was to analyze the
taeniid worms collected from hyenas, since we were
interested in obtaining molecular information on
T. hyaenae [22]. Zerihun H Negasi presented echinococcosis in domestic and wild animals in Ethiopia. His main
purpose was molecular identification of parasite specimens from camels, cattle and goats.
Antti J Lavikainen from Finland gave a brief talk on his
interest in molecular phylogeny of Taeniidae including
Taenia from wild bear in Finland and stressed his main
purpose to pursue molecular work on this parasite and
several others in Europe and Russia, and join with an
Ethiopian project [23]. All Japanese researchers were
basically the host scientists and gave brief introductions
for their main studies and tools, which they would like to
share with the guests. Minoru Nakao spoke on the molecular phylogeny of Taeniidae and molecular evolutional
aspects of Echinococcus spp. worldwide and explained
molecular approaches for parasite samples from all guests
[24,25]. Yasuhito Sako gave new tools for serodiagnosis
for echinococcosis and cysticercosis. He developed highly
specific and sensitive serology for both AE and CE using
recombinant antigens including the rapid immunochromatographic kits [26] and for cysticercosis using native
and recombinant antigens [27]. This time, he established
a novel simple method for purification of diagnostic antigens for cysticercosis (Sako et al., in prep.) and opened it
for all guests. Tetsuya Yanagida discussed the haplotype
network of Echinococcus spp. and Taenia solium [28].
Kazuhiro Nakaya summarized the usefulness of experimental animal models for these cestode zoonoses [29].
Munehiro Okamoto talked on the recent topics on the
hybrids of between T. saginata and T. asiatica [11].
Finally, Takashi Nishigaki gave a perspective for the
Governmental special fund for future collaboration and
stressed that we should continue international collaboration projects and apply for future funding (Figure 1).
So, the levels in science, technology, knowledge and
experience in parasitic diseases and evidence-based epidemiological studies were highly variable among the participants from different countries joined together in
Asahikawa. However, this was not problematic but
encouraged all participants to join together and help one
another and improve the curiosity or interest for further
studies and collaboration. PhD students from Cameroon
and Iran also joined together. Agathe Nkouawa from
Cameroon showed how to conduct multiplex PCR and
LAMP for taeniasis and cysticercosis of all parasite samples from human or animal origins and copro-PCR and

-LAMP for stool examinations, not only in the laboratory
but also in the field for the real time identification of the
species [30,31]. Tahereh Mohammadzadeh used mitochondrial DNA confirmation for Echinococcus spp. and
serology for CE.

Outcome from the seminar from 15 Feb until 4
March 2011
Every Wednesday, we had a 2-3 h seminar to summarize
what we had done.
1) China project: Of 51 tapeworms from 35 Tibetan
carriers analyzed by multiplex PCR and LAMP, 9 worms
from 4 carriers were confirmed as T. solium, 40 worms
from 30 individuals were identified as T. saginata, and
the remaining 2 worms from two carriers were confirmed
as hybrids of T. saginata and T. asiatica. Additionally,
one of the 35 carriers was identified as dual infection of
T. solium and T. saginata. Serology for cysticercosis in
the same Tibetan community revealed that 10.4%
(25/240) showed positive response. Further imaging
examination is necessary for these sero-positive individuals. Copro-PCR suggested that 35 (23.3%) of 150 stools
were positive for T. solium or T. saginata. Of these 35
positive samples, 25 were verified as taeniasis by collection of tapeworms following treatment with pumpkin
seeds combined with areca [32] and/or by microscopy,
whereas the remaining 10 cases were newly diagnosed. In
other words, copro-PCR could detect more taeniasis carriers in endemic areas.
2) Indonesia project: Although we could not find any
T. solium carriers in Bali in the past decade, we finally
succeeded in detection of several carriers from Karang
Asem (Swastika in prep.). All including an immature
cysticercus of an ocular cysticercosis case [33] were confirmed to be the Asian genotype of T. solium [34] by
multiplex PCR and/or LAMP. Molecular identification of
T. solium from Papua and Bali showed more similarity
than we had obtained previously [35]. Further studies are
necessary for such work to reach a conclusion on the origin of T. solium in Papua. Serology for cysticercosis in
Bali and Papua showed critical differences. People in Bali
showed relatively weak positive responses from few people, whereas those in Papua showed very strong positive
responses from the majority of people [36]. As we know
well, cysticercosis is highly endemic in Papua, but it is
still sporadic and, therefore, we expect that the control of
cysticercosis in Bali may be feasible after the establishment of the strategy for control of cysticercosis by both
the central and local Governments. As the field survey
has been carried out by the central CDC in Jakarta, Provincial CDC in Bali and Udayana University in Bali, we
expect that we can control cysticercosis in Bali. By contrast, it is very difficult to control cysticercosis in Papua
within a few decades [9,12,15,16].

participants.

3) Thai project: Stool examination by multiplex PCR
and LAMP revealed that 6 taeniases were by T. solium
(n = 5) and one was by T. saginata. As the carriers were
not treated during our short stay in Feb 2011, we were
setting up treatment of the people and additional stool
examination in the same village and serology for cysticercosis. [We had a second visit to the same village for
treatment of these carriers in May 2011. Unexpectedly,
we failed in treatment of three of these carriers, who
were basically refugees or immigrants from Myanmar
and unable to move out. They moved to urban areas to
obtain jobs without treatment. Therefore, these carriers
are expected to become high risk persons who may
cause secondary cysticercosis in the urban areas in the
future.]
4) Mongolian project: All Taenia specimens were confirmed as T. saginata by multiplex PCR as was confirmed
from another project coordinated by Abmed Davaajav in
2006 [17]. Echinococcus specimens from CE were confirmed to consist of G1 and G6 as we recognized it in
advance in 2006 when Akira Ito invited one junior
researcher under Abmed Davaajav [17] and the 6th AE
case was confirmed after Bat-Ochir Oyun-Erdene at the
Pathology Center, Ministry of Health showed the pathological data in 2010 to Akira Ito [18].
5) Ethiopian project: Molecular approaches for the
Taenia spp. collected from hyenas showed at least three
unknown different Taenia species. Morphological

description is ongoing. We, including Ethiopians, Antti J
Lavikainen and Japanese, have a great interest on the origin of human Taenia [22], since T. solium has a high
homology with Taenia species found from African wild
animals including hyena and others. In addition, parasite
cysts from 11 sheep, 19 cattle and 16 camels were analyzed. E. granulosus G1 genotype was identified from all
host species and E. canadensis G6 genotype from camels
and cattle. Surprisingly, one cattle cyst represented an
unknown Taenia species, the adult stage of which was
found in hyenas.

Perspectives
Our research team at AMU has been working on the
establishment of immunological and molecular diagnosis
of cestode zoonoses, mainly echinococcosis, and taeniasis
and cysticercosis. Confirmative studies are necessary for
future and further studies for evidence-based control of
such cestode zoonoses or any other infectious diseases.
During this period (from 2001 until 2007), four foreign
researchers completed their PhD studies in our team:
two students from China and one from Brazil were sponsored by the Japanese Government or other international
funds (US-NIH RO1), and one sandwich PhD program
student, Ronpaku, a researcher from Indonesia, was
sponsored by the Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science (JSPS). One guest from Cameroon received a
Japanese Governmental scholarship to become a PhD

Ito et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:114

student at AMU from 2006 and was awarded a PhD in
March 2011. Two guests completed their PhD thesis at
Mahidol University and Akira Ito was an overseas examiner for them. In addition, Akira Ito was an overseas PhD
examiner at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate
Medical Education and Research, India in 2011 and will
become an overseas examiner at Mahidol University for
one of the guests who just started his PhD studies on taeniasis/cysticercosis.
Through such joint projects sponsored by MEXT, we
continue to encourage colleagues who will actively work
for control of such parasitic diseases as the key researchers and establish better networks. Our philosophy may be
easily recognized by the authorship of the joint papers in
Indonesia, Thailand, China, Mongolia and Cameroon.
Basically, we do not become the first author for any of
the primary studies from any countries but invite junior
colleagues from the counterpart countries especially on
the field work in their home countries, except in a few
cases.
