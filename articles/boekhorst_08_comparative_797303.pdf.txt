<p>A comparison of phosphoproteomics
Phosphorylation in eukaryote evolution datasets of six eukaryotes shows significant overlap between phosphoproteomes.</p>

Abstract
Background: Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is involved in a wide range of processes,
ranging from signaling cascades to regulation of protein complex assembly. Little is known about
the structure and evolution of phosphorylation networks. Recent high-throughput
phosphoproteomics studies have resulted in the rapid accumulation of phosphopeptide datasets for
many model organisms. Here, we exploit these novel data for the comparative analysis of
phosphorylation events between different species of eukaryotes.
Results: Comparison of phosphoproteomics datasets of six eukaryotes yields an overlap ranging
from approximately 700 sites for human and mouse (two large datasets of closely related species)
to a single site for fish and yeast (distantly related as well as two of the smallest datasets). Some
conserved events appear surprisingly old; those shared by plant and animals suggest conservation
over the time scale of a billion years. In spite of the hypothesized incomprehensive nature of
phosphoproteomics datasets and differences in experimental procedures, we show that the
overlap between phosphoproteomes is greater than expected by chance and indicates increased
functional relevance. Despite the dynamic nature of the evolution of phosphorylation, the relative
overlap between the different datasets is identical to the phylogeny of the species studied.
Conclusion: This analysis provides a framework for the generation of biological insights by
comparative analysis of high-throughput phosphoproteomics datasets. We expect the rapidly
growing body of data from high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis to make comparative
phosphoproteomics a powerful tool for elucidating the evolutionary and functional dynamics of
reversible phosphorylation.

Background

Post-translational modifications play important roles in a
wide range of cellar functions. Reversible phosphorylation
has been studied extensively and is known to influence pro-

tein function by changing protein-protein binding properties,
activity, stability, and spatial organization [1]. Phosphorylation plays a key role in signal transduction cascades [2] and
allows the fine tuning of protein complex assembly [3]. It is

estimated that about one-third of all proteins in eukaryotic
cells are phosphorylated at any given time [1].
Recent developments in high-throughput phosphoproteomics studies have resulted in the availability of phosphopeptide
datasets for many model organisms. As a result, tools for the
comparison of phosphoproteomes are emerging [4].
Although these high-throughput datasets do not capture all
phosphorylated peptides of a species under a given condition,
large advances in enrichment strategies and mass spectrometry techniques have been made in the past few years, and
studies comparing partial phosphoproteomes are emerging
[5]. Even though both the incomprehensive nature of the data
as well as differences in experimental procedures complicate
comparative analysis, we can now start to exploit these data.
Comparative analysis of phosphoproteomics data could
increase our understanding of phosphorylation and the evolution of the phosphorylation network as a systems level
property.
Not only do comparative analyses aid in elucidating the evolution of phosphorylation, but they also are a powerful tool
with which to improve function prediction from sometimes
noisy high-throughput datasets. For example, the use of conserved gene order has been shown to be a much stronger signal for protein function prediction than the order of genes in
a single genome [6-8]. Similarly, the conservation of coexpression has been shown to aid function prediction from
microarray data [9,10].
In this study we perform comparative analysis of phosphorylation events in eukaryotes. Our aim is to determine whether
the quality of the data is sufficient to detect functionally significant overlap between high-throughput phosphoproteomics datasets, and to identify an evolutionarily significant
pattern in this overlap. To address these questions, we compare recent high-throughput phosphoproteomics datasets of
human, mouse, zebra fish, fruit fly, yeast, and plant. We
determine the overlap between these datasets and show that
this overlap is statistically, functionally, and evolutionarily
relevant.

Results
Measuring the overlap in phosphoproteomes
We analyzed the overlap between high-throughput phosphoproteomics datasets from six species of eukaryotes. These
datasets were created by different laboratories, using different experimental procedures (Table 1). In order to amend
these datasets for comparative analysis, we imposed a relatively strict set of cutoffs on phosphopeptide calls in order to
improve the uniformity and reduce noise caused by differences in scoring methods and thresholds (more details are
provided in the Materials and methods section, below). The
sizes of these individual datasets range from 724 to 3,296
(Table 1).

aCan be less than the number mentioned in the original papers,
because we imposed a relatively strict set of cutoffs on
phosphopeptide calls to improve the uniformity and reduce noise.

We identified homologous sequences by an all-against-all
Smith-Waterman search of all full-length proteins for which
one or more phosphopeptides were present in the datasets.
Phosphosites are considered homologous when a phosphosite in the query is aligned with the same type of phosphosite in the target sequence (workflow illustrated in Figure
1). For each dataset (the query) we counted the number of
phosphorylation sites in the query datasets with at least one
homolog in each of the target datasets (Table 2). The overlap
between the datasets ranges from approximately 700 sites for
human and mouse (two large datasets from closely related
species) to a single site for fish and yeast (both distantly relate
as well as two of the smallest datasets). Despite the virtually
nonexistent overlap between fish and yeast, larger datasets of
distantly related species exhibit considerable conservation;
for example, mouse and plant share 27 phosphosites. We
detect an overlap that is substantially larger than the overlap
reported in specific phosphoproteomics experiments; the
analysis conducted by Lemeer and coworkers [11] resulted in
50 phosphosites in zebrafish that had already been reported
in human or mouse, whereas we find an overlap of more than
150.

The overlap between phosphoproteomics sets is
significant
In both a scenario in which the rate of evolution of reversible
phosphorylation is so high that the species are too diverged to
detect real homologous phosphosites, and when species completely re-wire their phosphoproteome after speciation,
chance alone would result in a certain amount of overlap. We
thus randomized for every protein in the datasets the positions of the phosphorylated residues across 1,000 trials and
computed the average overlap. Note that this is a conservative
null model, because it assumes that different species phosphorylate the same protein, whereas cases have been
described in which different species use phosphorylation of
different proteins for the regulation of the assembly of homologous protein complexes [3]. The observed overlap is larger
than the average random overlap for almost all species comparisons (Table 2), strongly suggesting that the observed
overlap is the result of significant evolutionary conservation.

Given the difficulty of formulating a null model for the significance of conservation between two species, we next considered the conservation of phosphorylation events over three or
more species; if evolution plays no role in the overlap between
datasets, then the chance of a specific site being conserved in
one species will be independent of the presence or absence of
that same site in other species. We thus compare the number
of sites with homologs in two or more species with the
number of sites that we would expect if we assume the
chances of being conserved in different species to be independent (Table 3). For all datasets we observe that the
number of sites observed in three, four, or five different species exceeds the number of sites expected assuming inde-

pendence. Although we do not observe any phosphosites with
homologs in all six species, we do observe a number of phosphorylation sites in Arabidopsis thaliana with homologs in
one or more of the other datasets. These sites predate the evolutionary split between plants and ophistokonts, making
them more than a billion years old [12].

Relative overlap between phosphoproteomics data

Two independent tests suggest that the phosphorylation
overlap is quantitatively significant. As a next step we tested
for qualitative relevance by searching for a possible evolutionary pattern in the conservation of phosphoproteomics data-

sets. Specifically, we wondered whether a purported dynamic
system level property such as the phosphorylation repertoire
reflects the species phylogeny. However, interpreting the relative differences in overlap is far from trivial, because a myriad of both biological and technical factors, ranging from the
sensitivity of the mass spectrometry analysis to experimental
conditions under which phosphoproteomes were sampled,
convolute a potential signal.

Variations in experimental conditions and protocols potentially obscure the evolutionary signal in the overlap between
datasets. If this evolutionary signal is relatively strong, then
the relative overlap between datasets from a single species
should be greater than the relative overlap between datasets
from different species. We determined the relative overlap
between an additional dataset from fly [13] and the other six
datasets (Figure 3a). This additional dataset contains many
more phosphosites than the fly dataset that is already part of
our analysis (the additional dataset contains 10,293 sites, as
compared with the 2,080 of the original dataset), and the two
datasets were constructed by different laboratories using different techniques [13,14]. Nevertheless, the relative overlap
between both fly datasets is more than twice that with any of
the other datasets (Figure 3a), and an extended neighborjoining tree groups these two datasets together (Figure 3b).
The relative overlap between the datasets is thus not only
higher than expected by random chance; the relative overlap
also follows phylogeny and thus contains a qualitatively
strong and relevant evolutionary signal.

In order to extract this potential signal, we determined the
relative number of conserved phosphorylation sites by comparing the overlap with the number of sites that can potentially be conserved, given the proteins in the specific datasets:
the relative overlap. This relative overlap can be obtained in a
relatively straightforward manner by dividing the number of
conserved phosphorylation events of the query and target
datasets by the number of sites in the query dataset with one
or more homologous positions in full-length proteins of the
target dataset. We subsequently clustered the six species on
the basis of their relative by the neighbor joining algorithm
using 1 - (relative overlap) as the distance measure (Figure 2
and Additional data file 1). The topology of the unrooted tree
that is the result of the neighbor-joining is identical to the
topology of the tree of life for this small sample of six species.

tional meaning [8]. Low-throughput experiments are in general considered to be more reliable than high-throughput
experiments, because they tend to be more suited to controls
and validation. Several databases collect experimental data
on reversible phosphorylation, for example Phospho.ELM
[15] and Phosida [16]. Of all of the phosphosites in the human
dataset, 2.5% have also been observed by a low-throughput
experiment in the Phospho.ELM database; for the mouse
dataset this is 2.0%. In contrast, 4.8% of the conserved sites
in human and 4.2% of the conserved sites in mouse have been
measured using low-throughput techniques, a significant
increase (2 test P < 0.0001). This observation shows that
putative phosphorylation events with homologs in other
high-throughput experiments are less likely to be false positives. This increase in reliability suggests that the overlap
between phosphoproteomics datasets could be used as a tool
with which to assess the reliability of putative phosphosites
identified in high-throughput experiments, similar to the use
of comparative methods for improving reliability of interactomes [17].
Because some functional classes of proteins have been shown
to be more conserved than others, we wondered whether this
also holds for phosphorylation events. We utilized the functional classification provided by the Clusters of Orthologous
Groups database [18] to study over-representation of biological processes among proteins with well conserved phosphosites (Figure 4a,b). These data reveal a clear functional
trend in conserved phosphorylation sites; compared with
sites that are found in only a single species, a relatively high
percentage of phosphosites with homologs in two or more
species are found in proteins with functions related to infor-

mation storage and processing. Most striking is the over-representation of proteins that are involved in replication,
chromatin structure, and cell cycle related processes, classes
that contain functions that could be considered to be most
fundamental for the survival of the cell. The presence of
highly conserved phosphorylation events in these functional
categories suggests that the fine-tuning mechanisms provided by phosphorylation arose early in evolution. Although
based on these data we cannot exclude the possibility that this
over-representation is influenced by other factors (for example, proteins with functions related to information storage
and processing being more likely to have homologs in all six
species studied), a link between conservation of phosphorylation events and protein function is in accordance with other
observation (for example, protein function and duplication
rate [19]).
Phosphorylation events identified in a single high-thoughput
experiments are known to cluster outside globular domains,
as meausured by PFAM [20]. Of the events we analyzed, 15%
are found inside a domain predicted using domain predictions from the PFAM database [21]. When we only consider
conserved phosphorylation events, this shows a slight
increase to 17%. The similar percentage shows that the low
occurrence of phosphoryalation in known globular domains
holds true for evolutionarily conserved events, and hence is
not the result of the presence of spurious phosphorylations in
unconfirmed high-throughput data.

Discussion

Both the incomprehensive nature of high-throughput phosphoproteomics experiments as well as idiosyncrasies of the
experimental pipelines used by different laboratories compli-

all phosphorylation events in that functional category. Significance was determined using a Fisher's exact test; scores with a P value below 0.05 after
Bonferroni correction were considered significant. (b) Subclasses. The numbers in the cells are the fold increase of the fraction of phosphosites in that

cate the comparison of high-throughput phosphoproteomics
datasets. In addition, the data we are comparing result from
experiments designed with different biological questions in
mind; the plant experiment, for example, focuses on the
phosphorylation of membrane associated proteins from cells
grown in culture [22], whereas the mouse experiment uses
protein extract from homogenized liver tissue [23]. All of
these differences will undoubtedly introduce dissimilarities

in the observed phosphoproteomes that do not reflect the
evolutionary changes in phosphorylation networks between
the different species, making the overlap that we found a minimal estimate. Randomization trials, functional bias in highly
conserved phosphorylation events, and the relative differences in overlap between the six high-throughput phosphoproteomics datasets all suggest the overlap between these
datasets to be biologically relevant, and we successfully iden-

tified the evolutionary signal in this overlap. We find a
number of phosphorylation events that are likely to predate
the evolutionary split between plants and animals. These sites
thus appear to be ancient in origin, which is perhaps surprising, given that phosphorylation is thought to be a subtle regulatory mechanism.
Our work suggests that our understanding of reversible phosphorylation can be increased by comparing the results of
high-throughput phosphoproteomics analysis with those
from large-scale in vitro phosphorylation assays (for example
[24,25]) or computationally predicted phosphoproteomes. In
the current setup (comparing different mass spectrometry
based high-throughput phosphoproteomics datasets), experimental idiosyncrasies already loom large over any comparison; hence, we did not include such datasets in this study.
However, because we have now shown that the overlap is biologically significant, this restraint can be relaxed; comparative analysis in fact enables the use of the ever-increasing
amount of data on phosphorylation obtained by highthroughput mass spectrometry experiments that were not
designed specifically for this particular purpose.
Previous studies have described the conservation across multiple species of amino acid residues that are known to be
phosphorylated in a specific organism [26] and have studied
the conservation of the phosphorylation events themselves on
a small scale (for example [27]). PhosphoBlast [4] provides a
powerful tool with which to compare (phosphorylated) peptides, illustrated by the authors by comparing human and
mouse phosphopeptide datasets. These studies revealed a relatively high conservation of amino acid residues that are
known to be phosphorylated in one or more phosphoproteomics experiments, and identified a substantial overlap
between the phosphoproteomes of different species. We
extend this observation to larger evolutionary distances and
show that the overlap is statistically, functionally, and evolutionarily relevant. These insights can applied, for example, to
discriminating between noise and real phosphorylation
events in high-throughput mass spectrometry experiments
(analogous to the use of conserved gene order in the evaluation of BLAST significance scores [28]).

Conclusion

The presence of functionally and evolutionarily significant
overlap between high-throughput phosphoproteomics experiments allows the use of comparative phosphoproteomics in
the prediction and evaluation of phosphorylation networks,
similar to the established use of comparative genomics and
transcriptomics in the elucidation of protein functions and
biological networks. We expect the rapidly growing amount of
data from high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis to
make comparative phosphoproteomics a powerful tool in predicting,
evaluating,

Materials and methods
Datasets
Table 1 lists the datasets compared in this study. Because our
comparison of high-throughput datasets is already complicated by many factors, ranging from the incomprehensive
nature of the data to differences in experimental procedures,
we made an effort to keep putative false-positive phosphorylation sites from further confounding the analysis. We used
criteria for filtering the input data that in many cases are
more stringent than the criteria used in the original publications. Each dataset was preprocessed by removing all phosphopeptides with ambiguous sites (phosphogroups that could
not be attributed to a specific amino acid residue), by removing peptides that could not be retraced unambiguously to one
specific protein, and by applying a strict threshold on the peptide identification scores. For the human, fly, Arabidopsis,
and zebrafish datasets we used a Mascot peptide score threshold of 35; for the mouse dataset we used an Ascore threshold
of 19; and from the yeast dataset we took only phosphorylation sites with e-values of 1 × e-04 or lower. For the additional
fly dataset we used an dCn threshold of 0.1 and a
PeptideProphet threshold of 0.9. Data handling was done
with ad hoc Python scripts.

Overlap
Homologous phosphosites were identified by doing an allagainst-all similarity search using the Paralign implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm [29] of all of the fulllength proteins for which one or more phosphopeptides were
present in the datasets, followed by the identification of highscoring segment pairs with an e-value of 1 × e-10 or lower in
which both the query and the target had the same type of
phosphosites at exactly the same position in the alignment (a
phosphorylated serine residue should be aligned with a phosphorylated serine residue). Because this procedure does not
include any (reciprocal) best hit criteria, all we conclude is
that similar sites are homologous; the exact nature of this
relationship (orthologous, paralogous) remains unclear. We
used a strict e-value threshold of 1 × e-10 for the identification
of homologous sequences. The use of a more liberal threshold
would increase the overlap (we are now probably missing
some homologous phosphorylation events because we did not
consider the surrounding sequence to be sufficiently conserved) but would also introduce more noise into an already
noisy dataset. In addition, a strict cutoff means that we do not
erroneously assume convergently evolved small linear motifs
to be homologous (motifs involved in recognition of phosphosites by their kinases tend to be extremely short [30]).

Expected overlap between datasets assuming
independence
The probability that a phosphorylation event in a query dataset is conserved in a target dataset is given by Equation 1.

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R144

P(q  OQ, T) = NQ, T/NQ

Where Q is the query dataset, q is a phosphorylation event in
Q, T is the target dataset,  means 'element of',  means 'not
an element of', OQ, T is the overlap of Q and T (events from Q
with a homologous event in T), NQ, T is the number of events
in OQ, T, and NQ is the total number of events in Q.

The probability that q has homologs in x of the target datasets
is the sum of all possible combinations of presence and
absence in all of the target datasets, given x. As an example,
we consider target datasets A, B, and C. The probability P that
q has homologs in two out of these three datasets is given by
Equation 2.
P(q|x = 2) = P(q  OQ, A ʝ q  OQ, B ʝ q  OQ, C)+ P(q  OQ, A
ʝ q  OQ, B ʝ q  OQ, C) + P(q  OQ, A ʝ q  OQ, B ʝ q  OQ, C)

Where P(q|x = 2) is the probability that q has homologs in two
target datasets, and ʝ is the 'and' operator.
The expected number of phosphorylation events from a query
dataset with homologs in x target datasets is now given by
Equation 3.
E (x = i) = P(q|x = i).NQ

In which E is the expected value, and i is a number lower than
the total number of datasets.

Relative overlap
Relative overlap was calculated by dividing the number of
conserved phosphorylation events of the query and target
datasets by the number of sites in the query dataset with one
or more homologous positions in the target dataset. We identified homologous positions using the results of the allagainst-all similarity search described above; a site has a
homologous position in a target dataset when the site is part
of one or more high-scoring segment pairs in that dataset,
irrespective of the specific residue type the site is aligned
with.

Domains
We identified known domains in the full-length sequence of
all proteins with one or more phosphorylation events.
Domains were identified with HMMER [31], using models
provided by version 23 of the PFAM database [21]. The location of phosphorylation events relative to these domains was
determined using python scripts.
