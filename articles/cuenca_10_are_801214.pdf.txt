Are substitution rates and RNA editing
correlated?
Argelia Cuenca1*, Gitte Petersen1, Ole Seberg1, Jerrold I Davis2, Dennis W Stevenson3

Abstract
Background: RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that, in seed plants, involves a cytosine to uracil change
in messenger RNA, causing the translated protein to differ from that predicted by the DNA sequence. RNA editing
occurs extensively in plant mitochondria, but large differences in editing frequencies are found in some groups.
The underlying processes responsible for the distribution of edited sites are largely unknown, but gene function,
substitution rate, and gene conversion have been proposed to influence editing frequencies.
Results: We studied five mitochondrial genes in the monocot order Alismatales, all showing marked differences in
editing frequencies among taxa. A general tendency to lose edited sites was observed in all taxa, but this tendency
was particularly strong in two clades, with most of the edited sites lost in parallel in two different areas of the
phylogeny. This pattern is observed in at least four of the five genes analyzed. Except in the groups that show an
unusually low editing frequency, the rate of C-to-T changes in edited sites was not significantly higher that in nonedited 3rd codon positions. This may indicate that selection is not actively removing edited sites in nine of the
12 families of the core Alismatales. In all genes but ccmB, a significant correlation was found between frequency of
change in edited sites and synonymous substitution rate. In general, taxa with higher substitution rates tend to
have fewer edited sites, as indicated by the phylogenetically independent correlation analyses. The elimination of
edited sites in groups that lack or have reduced levels of editing could be a result of gene conversion involving a
cDNA copy (retroprocessing). If so, this phenomenon could be relatively common in the Alismatales, and may have
affected some groups recurrently. Indirect evidence of retroprocessing without a necessary correlation with
substitution rate was found mostly in families Alismataceae and Hydrocharitaceae (e.g., groups that suffered a rapid
elimination of all their edited sites, without a change in substitution rate).
Conclusions: The effects of substitution rate, selection, and/or gene conversion on the dynamics of edited sites in
plant mitochondria remain poorly understood. Although we found an inverse correlation between substitution rate
and editing frequency, this correlation is partially obscured by gene retroprocessing in lineages that have lost most
of their edited sites. The presence of processed paralogs in plant mitochondria deserves further study, since most
evidence of their occurrence is circumstantial.

Background
RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that, in the
plant mitochondria, causes a nucleotide change, generally
from cytosine to uracil, in mature messenger RNA. It has
been estimated that ca. 90% of all encoded genes in the
mitochondrial genome of angiosperms are affected by
RNA editing [1]. In Arabidopsis mitochondria, 441 edited
sites are present in coding regions [2], and similar levels of

editing have been found in other land plants [3-5]. Editing
also occurs but is less frequent in plastids, with only 25 to
30 sites known to be edited in angiosperms [6,7].
Most edited sites are located within protein coding
genes, although reduced levels of editing are found in
non-coding regions such as introns and tRNAs [[8], and
references therein]. It is well established that RNA editing
tends to increase conservation of the amino acid composition of homologous proteins across species [9,10]. This is
consistent with the fact that editing mostly affects 2 nd
codon positions, with only a few 3rd codon positions having been observed [2-5].

The mechanisms of RNA editing in plastids and plant
mitochondria share a number of characteristics [7]. This,
together with the absence of editing in the organelles of
green algae, suggests a common acquisition of RNA editing during the origin of land plants [11,12]. However, this
conclusion relies on limited data from the green algae.
It has been shown that sequences 20-40 nt upstream
and 2-10 nt downstream of an edited cytosine are critical for its recognition as target for editing [[13] and
references therein], with a bias towards having a U and
an A flanking the edited site at the 5'- and 3'-ends,
respectively [2,7]. However, no consensus recognition
sequence has been found for all edited sites. Recent studies have proposed that a family of nuclear encoded
pentatricopeptide repeat proteins (PPR) are involved in
the recognition of sites subject of RNA editing in the
organelles [14,15], while it is unclear whether this kind
of proteins also carry on the enzymatic reaction. The
PPR proteins are encoded by about 450 genes in Arabidopsis, suggesting that the entire family diversified and
proliferated simultaneously with the establishment of
edited sites in land plants [16].
Editing frequency is generally similar among homologous genes across angiosperms [4], and many edited sites
are conserved among distantly related groups. However,
there is some species-specific diversity in terms of
whether a given site either requires editing or the edited
version (a T) is encoded in the DNA. Recent observations
from a number of plant lineages show surprisingly large
differences in editing frequency. For example, there are
cases in which all or the majority of the edited sites have
been lost in one or more genes [17,18]. It is largely
unknown which kinds of processes are responsible for
the distribution of edited sites in the mitochondrial genome. In angiosperm mitochondrial genomes, the number
of cytosine residues that are edited has decreased over
time, being replaced by DNA encoded thymine residues
[19]. It has been shown that the C-to-T mutation rate at
edited sites is higher than the rate of C-to-T transitions
at 3rd codon positions [19,20]. As both substitutions are
synonymous, it has been proposed that selection is acting
to remove edited sites in plant mitochondria. C-to-T
mutations at a site that usually is edited could provide a
selective advantage, because this would make editing
superfluous and remove any dependency on a number of
trans-acting factors and recognition sequences that
otherwise need to be conserved [19-21]. This raises the
question of how RNA editing evolved in the first place,
whether RNA editing could have provided an adaptive
advantage during the early stages of land plant evolution
[5,8,12] or whether its origin was neutral and driven by
genetic drift [22].
Several authors have suggested a possible correlation
between substitution rates and editing frequency

Page 2 of 15

[16,17,21]. The low substitution rates found in coding
areas of plant mitochondria could generate an environment in which it is easier to conserve edited sites by
reducing selection pressure. As the substitution rate
increases, the mutational load against editing will
increase too, as editing relies heavily on conserved
recognition sequences [21]. It is noteworthy that
lineages with a dramatic increase in substitution rate,
such as Pelargonium and other Geraniaceae, are associated with a strong reduction in editing [23]. This phenomenon is also observed in species of the genus Silene
(Caryophyllaceae, [24]). Conversely, higher editing frequencies are found in lineages with a low synonymous
substitution rate, such as Magnolia [25] and several
gymnosperms [17]. Contrary to these examples, there
appears to be limited correlation between editing frequency and substitution rates in the Asparagales [18].
No evidence of correlation between substitution rate
and editing frequency was found in comparisons of 21
mitochondrial genes in seven land plant taxa [5]. However, this study shows a clear correlation between gene
function and editing frequency, hence, a correlation test
including all 21 genes simultaneously could confound
the effect of gene function and substitution rate over
the editing frequency. In order to eliminate the confounding effect of different gene function, gene-specific
comparisons need to be done.
Besides C-to-T mutations in the DNA, mitochondrial
genes could lose their edited sites by homologous recombination with a cDNA copy [19,26,27]. It has been suggested that in some cases the cDNA copy could be
reinserted in a different location within the mitochondrial genome or transferred to the nucleus (creating a
processed paralog [26,28]), whereas the original unedited
sequence may remain as a functional copy, degenerate
into a pseudogene or be completely deleted [26]. However, no evidence of the coexistence of processed paralogs and the original sequence is known in plant
mitochondria. The lack of edited sites in cox3 and rps13
in some lineages of Amaryllidaceae and Iridaceae has
been explained by multiple independent incorporation
events of processed paralogs into the mitochondrial genome, replacing the original gene [18]. This also applies to
the lack of editing in, e.g., coxI in Gingko and Larix [17].
In many of these studies it is impossible to determine
whether the C-to-T changes removing the edited sites
occurred simultaneously, as expected in the case of gene
conversion with a cDNA copy, or whether they have
been lost gradually as a consequence of other factors
such as changes in mutation rates, increase in selection
against edited sites, modifications in the C-to-T fixation
rate, or simply random fixation.
To explain why some taxa with a high substitution
rate are also lacking edited sites (e.g., Pelargonium), an

Cuenca et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:349

association between retroprocessing and substitution
rates has been suggested. It is well known that reverse
transcriptase is an error-prone enzyme and consequently
a processed paralog may appear to have an increased
substitution rate [23]. However, this does not seem sufficient to explain the high substitution rates of some
taxa. In addition, it is not evident whether a processed
paralog facilitates an increase in substitution rate or if it
is the general increase in substitution rate that facilitates
the formation of processed paralogs [28].
Recent phylogenetic analyses within the monocots
have identified a group within the order Alismatales as
one of the lineages with pronounced changes in the
editing frequency. In the following discussion we will
refer to this group as the "core Alismatales", which
includes all families in Alismatales [29] except the Araceae and Tofieldeaceae. Together with a strong reduction in the number of edited sites found in the two
mitochondrial genes studied (cob and atp1, [28]), a
number of mitochondrial anomalies have been found in
the core Alismatales. This has included a remarkably
large number of losses of mitochondrial genes [30],
removal of introns in nad1 [31], and a likely insertion of
processed paralogs [28].
In the present paper we extend the Alismatales data
from [28] to include five mitochondrial genes. With
these data we aim to 1) explore the correlation between
substitution rates and editing frequency, 2) identify possible cases of retroprocessing and explore a possible correlation between this phenomenon and the substitution
rates, and 3) test whether the rate of change in edited
sites follows the dynamics of C-to-T changes in 3 rd
codon positions, as expected under neutrality, or if there
is any other indication of selection acting to remove edited sites in this group.
We found a significant correlation between synonymous substitution rate and editing frequency for three
of the four genes analyzed. Several cases of retroprocessing are hypothesized, in some cases involving the complete gene, which could be indirect evidence of the
existence of processed paralogs occurring in the mitochondria. In eight of the twelve families included, edited
sites seem to be removed at just a slightly faster rate
than the C-to-T changes in 3rd codon positions (difference not significant). This may indicate that in taxa with
low substitution rates, edited sites are behaving as

effectively neutral, with selection not playing an active
roll in purging them from the mitochondrial genome.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis

Two most-parsimonious trees (L = 2083, CI = 0.55
excluding autapomorphies, RI = 0.804), were obtained
from a parsimony analysis of a combined matrix of five
mitochondrial genes (cob, atp1, exon 2 of nad5, mtt2,
and ccmB) and 46 Alismatales taxa (4357 characters of
which 647 are parsimony informative). Taxon sampling
and GenBank accession numbers are shown in Table S1
in the Additional file 1. The only difference between the
trees is in the position of Stratiotes, which is placed
either as sister to the remaining Hydrocharitaceae or
embedded within the family. A maximum likelihood
analysis recovered a tree (not shown) identical to one of
the parsimony trees, with Stratiotes as sister to the
remaining Hydrocharitaceae, but also collapsing the
clade consisting of Posidoniaceae, Ruppiaceae, and Cymodoceaceae. Because the difference between one of the
most parsimonious trees and the likelihood tree has no
impact on our analyses, all the subsequent results are
based on the former.
All but one of the twelve families included within the
core Alismatales are resolved as monophyletic (Figure
1). The exception is Alismataceae, which is resolved as
paraphyletic with respect to Limnocharitaceae. In this
study we will refer to this clade consisting of Alismataceae and Limnocharitacae simply as Alismataceae s.l.,
unless specified otherwise. In addition, a different editing pattern was consistently found between Stratiotes
and the rest of the Hydrocharitaceae (see below). Subsequently, we refer to members of this family, excluding
Stratiotes, as the core Hydrocharitaceae.
Edited sites and substitution rates
Editing in cob

PREP-Mt [10] was used to predict the number of edited
sites per taxon and cDNA from a subset of our taxon sampling was used to verify experimentally the predictions
from PREP-Mt (Table S2 in Additional file 1). Twenty-five
edited sites were found in cob, and of those the majority,
16 (64%), are at 1st codon positions (Table 1). Variation in
the number of edited sites ranges from 22 in the Araceae
to zero in some Hydrocharitaceae (Table S3 in Additional

file 1). Only one of the sites found to be edited in RNA
sequences was not predicted as edited by PREP-Mt.
Neither edited sites at 3rd codon positions nor evidence of
incomplete editing were found in cob.
In all genes analyzed, members of Alismataceae s.l. and
Hydrocharitaceae tend to have fewer edited sites than the
remaining members of the order. The dynamic of gain
and loss of edited sites was reconstructed in two ways: a)
using parsimony to optimize the character change, and b)
inferring the edited ancestral codon and predicted amino
acid sequence for each node of the tree, and comparing
both to observe discrepancies caused by editing. Both
approaches indicated that all edited sites present in the
most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the order
were lost in the branch leading to Hydrocharitaceae after
the divergence of Stratiotes (Figure 1). Additionally, nine
edited sites were lost in the branch leading to the

Alismataceae s.l., with subsequent gains and losses arising
within this clade. Instances of gain of edited sites were
found in Limnocharis (7 edited sites gained) and Sagittaria (3 edited sites gained).
Synonymous substitution rates (dS) were estimated for
each branch of the tree. To obtain the absolute synonymous substitution rate (R S ), the branch length was
divided by its time of duration, as obtained by calibrating
the tree by penalized likelihood in r8s [32]. However, as
single gene d S values gave many branches with zero
length, we decided to use the distance to the most recent
common ancestor of the core Alismatales divided by the
age estimated for this node (79.1 Ma) as a taxon-specific
estimate of RS. A 6-fold difference (P < 0.001) in RS was
found between the slower (Triglochin RS = 0.35 × 10-9,
Figure 2 and Table S4 in Additional file 1) and the faster
evolving taxa (Halophila, RS = 2.13 × 10-9). Congruent

Figure 2 Synonymous substitution rates (dS) for five mitochondrial genes in Alismatales. Synonymous substitution rates (dS) calculated
using the program HyPhy ver. 0.9 with the MG94×HKY85_3 × 4 codon model and using one of the two trees obtained by the parsimony
analysis for the combined data set. All trees are drawn at the same scale. The outgroup was removed from the figure to save space. Clades
marked as HH, EE, and ALB correspond to likely insertions of processed paralogs in nad5 (see text).

with this, pairwise relative ratio tests show roughly three
groups with significant differences in d S : the first is
formed by the faster evolving Halophila, Najas, and Ruppia, the second includes most members of the core Alismatales, and the third includes the slower evolving taxa,
such as Triglochin and Stratiotes.
In order to test whether there is a correlation between
substitution rate and the number of changes in edited
sites, we performed an analysis of regression through
the origin [33,34] and a phylogenetically independent
contrast analysis (PIC, [35]). Both methods compare sister clades, which are independent to each other up to
the MRCA, and therefore can be included as independent points in a correlation analysis. We found a significant correlation between the d S and the number of
changes in edited sites in each branch of the tree (r =
0.532, Table 2) when a regression through the origin is
carried on. Similarly, the phylogenetically independent
contrast analysis shows a significant correlation between
the RS and the number of changes in edited sites from
the MRCA to the tip of the tree (r = 0.477), but not

between R S and the number of edited sites present in
each taxa (r = -0.270, P(32 df) = 0.061). These correlations include all species with no edited sites, which may
cause an underestimation of the correlation between
both variables, because they cannot lose more edited
sites, irrespective of their substitution rate (Figure 3). To
avoid this, the PIC analysis was repeated removing all
the members of the core Hydrocharitaceae where no
edited sites were found, leaving only one representative
of the non-edited group (either the species with the
shortest branch or the one with the longest branch,
Table 2). When we do so, all correlations increase considerably, all of them becoming significant.
When the C-to-T substitution rate in 3rd codon positions
was compared with the rate of C-to-T change in edited
sites, we found that both rates are similar in Aponogetonaceae, Scheuchzeriaceae, Juncaginaceae, Potamogetonaceae,
Zosteraceae, Butomaceae, Ruppiaceae, and Stratiotes
(Table 3). Not surprising, major discrepancies between
these rates are found in the Alismataceae s.l. and Hydrocharitaceae, where most or all edited sites have been lost.

Editing in nad5

For this gene, three more edited sites were found in
cDNA sequences than were predicted by PREP-Mt. In
addition, three sites predicted as edited by PREP-Mt
show heterogeneity among taxa in their editing status
(e.g., C nucleotides edited in some species but not in
others). In particular, three C's edited in Zannichellia
and Zostera show no evidence of being posttranscriptionally modified in Ruppia and Acorus, and they were
excluded from the analysis. This resulted in a total of 25
edited sites in nad5, most of them in 2nd codon positions (64%, Table 1). The number of edited sites per
species ranged from 22 in Araceae, to zero in members
of Hydrocharitaceae (Table S3).
All but one edited site were lost in the Baldellia Alisma - Luronium (ABL) clade, and a reduction in the
number of edited sites was also found in Ruppia (Ruppiaceae). Instances of ambiguous optimization are found
within Hydrocharitaceae, as DELTRAN optimization
indicates a parallel loss of 14 edited sites in two branches
within the family (Figure 1 and 3). ACCTRAN optimization, on the other hand, mapped these characters as
reversals in two branches within the Hydrocharitaceae.
This could be a problem of taxon sampling; however, the
reconstruction of ancestral codon and amino acid
sequences in PAML further supports the parallel loss of
those characters, rather than the reversal hypothesis.
An up to 22-fold difference (P < 0.001) in absolute
synonymous substitution rate was estimated between
Ranalisma (RS = 0.13 × 10-9; Figure 2, and Table S4 in
Additional file 1) and Halophila (RS = 2.88 × 10-9). The
pairwise relative ratio test shows a significant difference
in the substitution pattern of five species of Hydrocharitaceae (Halophila, Najas, Hydrilla, Nechamandra, and
Vallisneria) with respect to the rest of the core Alismatales, which exhibits a homogeneous substitution rate.

Weak but significant correlations were found between
1) dS and the number of changes in edited sites for each
branch (r = 0.434), 2) the RS and the number of changes
in edited sites from the root to the tip of the tree (r =
0.498) and 3) the RS and the number of edited sites per
species (r = -0.489). As for cob, the correlations increase
considerably when members of Hydrocharitaceae with
no edited sites are removed from the analysis, and only
one representative of the group is left (Table 2).
We found a 3 to 4 times higher rate of C-to-T change
in edited sites than in 3 rd codon positions (Table 3),
except in the two clades where processed paralogs are
suspected (e.g., Hydrocharitaceae and the ABL clade, see
discussion), or in the remaining Alismataceae, where the
rate of change in edited sites is zero.
Editing in atp1

For the atp1 matrix only five edited sites were predicted
by PREP-Mt and corroborated via cDNA sequences.
The number of edited sites by taxon varies from zero to
three and no edited sites were found at 3rd codon positions. All edited sites in atp1 were lost in Alismataceae
s.l. and in some members of Hydrocharitaceae. Najas,
Nechamandra, Ottelia, and Hydrilla regained up to
three edited sites following complete elimination (Figure
1). atp1 showed the highest substitution rate of the
genes analyzed in this study (Figure 2). A 4.5-fold rate
difference was found between Aponogeton (RS = 1.30 ×
10 -9 ) and Sagittaria (R S = 5.75 × 10 -9 ). Given the
reduced number of changes of edited sites, no correlation analyses were performed.
Edting in ccmB

For some taxa of our data set, no amplification of this
region was obtained (Table S1 in Additional file 1).
Among-taxon heterogeneity in editing status was found
in three positions, and these sites were excluded from
the analysis.

with respect to its sister clade and/or its most recent ancestor.

ccmB shows the largest proportion of edited sites found
in this study, ranging from 43 sites in Aponogeton to 8 in
Hydrocleys (Table S3 in Additional file 1). Instances of
major losses of edited sites were mapped in the branch
leading to Alismataceae s.l. (22 sites lost), with a further
loss of eleven sites in Hydrocleys (Figure 1 and 3). Eleven
sites were lost in the Nechamandra-Vallisneria clade,
and seven in Ruppia.
In ccmB a 12-fold difference (P = 0.001), in synonymous substitution rate was found between Posidonia

(RS = 0.08 × 10-9) and Hydrilla (RS = 0.99 × 10-9). No
significant correlation was found either between substitution rate and the number of changes in edited sites in
any of the sister group comparisons (Table 2), or
between substitution rate and number of edited sites
present in each taxa.
Editing in mtt2

Thirty edited sites were found in mtt2, ranging from 29
in Araceae to one in Halophila (Table S3 in Additional
file 1). Fifteen of the 30 edited sites found in cDNA

sequences of mtt2 were either not predicted by PREPMt or predicted with a threshold value lower than 0.6.
For mtt2 the most dramatic losses of edited sites were
found in Halophila, Echinodorus, Hydrocleys, and
Hydrilla, where 21, 14, 11 and nine sites were lost,
respectively (Figure 1). Edited sites were regained in
Najas (five edited sites) only. The relative ratio test for
d S in mtt2 shows an accelerated substitution rate for
Halophila (RS = 2.2 × 10-9 ) with a 3.6-fold difference
compare to the slower evolving taxa such as Stratiotes
(R S = 0.6 × 10 -9 , P < 0.001). With the exception of
Hydrocharitaceae, Echinodorus, and Hydrocleys, the rate
of C-to-T change in 3rd codon positions is roughly the
same as the rate of change in edited sites (Table 3). A

significant correlation was found between 1) dS and the
number of changes in edited sites for each branch of
the tree (r = 0.603), 2) RS and the number of changes
from the MRCA to the tip of the tree (r = 0.768), and
3) the RS and the number of edited sites present in each
taxa (r = -0.707, Table 2).

Discussion
Phylogenetic relationships in the core Alismatales

A robust phylogeny and a dense taxon sampling are
fundamental to our understanding of the dynamics of
edited sites. However, no consensus exists concerning
the phylogenetic relationships among the twelve families
that constitute the core Alismatales. The few analyses

Cuenca et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/349

explicitly addressing this issue are based on a single
chloroplast gene, rbcL [36,37], or on a combined analysis of rbcL and morphological data [38]. Perhaps the
most obvious disagreement between our phylogenetic
hypothesis and those previously published is in the position of the Alismataceae s.l. In our analyses this clade is
sister to the remaining core Alismatales, with strong
bootstrap support (Additional file 2), whereas the rbcL
data place it as sister clade to Butomaceae and Hydrocharitaceae [37]. This difference is unfortunate, since
the Alismataceae s.l., together with the Hydrocharitaceae, has experienced profound changes in the number
of edited sites. However, even the postulated monophyly
of Hydrocharitaceae, Butomaceae, and the Alismataceae
s.l. cannot explain the reduction in number of edited
sites as a single event, since most of the changes have
taken place only in selected clades within the affected
familes. Therefore, regardless of the relationships
among these families, we are confident that the
dynamics of change in edited sites have been inferred
correctly.
The other problematic area of our phylogeny is the placement of Ranalisma. Single-gene analyses (not shown)
show incongruence in the placement of this genus, and
its place in the combined tree is in disagreement with
previous studies and with the established classification.
When Ranalisma is excluded from the analysis, the
reversion of seven edited sites of cob that were re-gained
in Limnocharis, are optimized as losses in Hydrocleys,
which is more in agreement with what we know about
the dynamics of editing sites and with the results from
other genes.
Characteristics of edited sites in Alismatales

Although most edited sites are generally present in 2nd
codon positions [2-4,8], this is not true for all genes
included in this study. In cob and mtt2, the majority of
edited sites are in fact present in 1st codon positions (60
and 53%, respectively). In agreement with other studies
[1,5] editing led to an increase in hydrophobicity of the
encoded protein. This increase in hydrophobicity is more
pronounced in codons with editing in the 2nd position.
The amino acid changes inferred from editing at 2nd
codon positions in the core Alismatales correspond to
those inferred for Arabidopsis thaliana, Beta vulgaris,
and Oryza sativa [5], with Ser to Phe (34%), Ser to Leu
(29%), and Pro to Leu (25%) being the most common.
In contrast, replacement of Arg with Trp, by far the
most common change in 1 st codon position in other
taxa [5], accounts for only 14% of changes in the core
Alismatales, where the most common changes were
from Pro to Ser (30%), His to Tyr (24%), and Arg to
Cys (24%). It is not clear whether this difference has any
biological significance or if it is a spurious pattern

Page 9 of 15

related to the reduced sample size of our analysis as
opposed to the broader analysis of Jobson and Qiu [5].
Dynamics of gain and loss of edited sites

In this study we refer to sites as being edited when DNAencoded cytosines undergo post-transcriptional modification, resulting in uracil in the mature mRNA. At the
DNA level, we consider all changes in which an edited
cytosine is replaced by thymine as losses of editing,
because this editing is no longer needed to synthesize the
correct protein sequence. Another manner of losing an
edited site is by a C-to-A or C-to-G change at an edited
position, resulting in a non-synonymous change in the
encoded protein. We are aware that both scenarios are
oversimplifications. Even when the editing mechanism is
no longer needed at a particular site (simply because the
C subject to editing is not present), this does not necessarily imply that the mechanism itself is lost. Editing relies
heavily on interactions between protein factors and
recognition sequences upstream and downstream from
the edited site. Therefore, it is plausible that, as long as
the recognition sequences are conserved, a particular site
will not lose the ability to be edited, even though the C
has been substituted by another base. This leads us to
believe that if a back mutation recovers the original C,
this C may possibly still be edited, though this may not
always be true. In our analyses ca. 29 T to C reversions
were found at editing sites. Although we were unable to
confirm their editing status by comparison to cDNA
sequences in all cases, we did find heterogeneity between
the editing status at some sites. In all cases where heterogeneity among taxa was detected in the editing status,
the edited site was removed from the analysis. However,
it remains a possibility that we are still overestimating
the number of gains of edited sites, because not all reversions were checked against cDNA data to ascertain their
editing status.
Consistent with other studies [18,25,28], large differences in the number of edited sites were found among
the taxa examined here. Both Alismataceae and Hydrocharitaceae tend to retain fewer edited sites than the
remaining members of the Alismatales. Parallel losses
were found for both families in at least four of the five
genes analyzed, whereas in atp1 there are too few
instances to draw any conclusion. Reduction in the number of edited sites does not appear to be a process that
affects the four genes simultaneously, as each coding
region has lost sites in different branches within each
family. One of the most problematic branches on which
to optimize characters was the branch leading to Alismatales. This ambiguity is attributable to a lack of edited
sites in Acorus coupled with extensive editing in other
members of the outgroup. Further optimization problems
were found in nad5 within Hydrocharitaceae. A large

Cuenca et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/349

number of edited sites were lost in this family; however,
the precise branch(es) on which a site is lost is difficult to
establish. DELTRAN optimization favors parallel loss of
edited sites in two branches within the family (Figure 2
and 3), and the same result is obtained by reconstruction
of ancestral estates in PAML. ACCTRAN optimization
favors a less likely scenario where edited sites are lost at
the base of the core Hydrocharitaceae, and secondarily
gained in the Blyxa-Ottelia clade. Although it has been
shown that loss of edited sites occurs more easily than
gain [19], we cannot reject the possibility that a reversal
may have occurred. A denser taxon sampling within the
Hydrocharitaceae may help to unambiguously reconstruct the dynamics of edited sites within the family.
Changes in edited sites compared with C to T changes in
3rd codon positions

Several authors [19,20] have been suggested that a C at
an edited site is not neutral, but has a selective disadvantage with respect to a T in the same position. The
presence of edited sites may represent a "burden", since
they are dependent on specific recognition sequences
and trans-factors that need to be conserved to maintain
editing activity. If a mutation re-establishes a genomically encoded T, it may be favored by selection, because
dependence on the complex editing machinery is eliminated. These observations are complicated by the observation of reversions or re-acquisitions of edited sites.
A strong selective disadvantage would render reversions
extremely rare, making it unlikely that up to seven
reversions occurred rapidly in some branches of our
phylogeny. Although some of the inferred reversals
could be an artifact of incomplete taxon sampling or
errors in the phylogenetic reconstruction, this is unlikely
to be the case for all of them. A large number of mutations restoring an editing site would suggest that a C in
a particular position is in some way advantageous.
The idea of selection against editing sites has been supported mainly by a number of analyses showing that the
rate of C-to-T substitution at edited sites is significantly
higher than the rate of C-to-T change at synonymous
positions [19,20]. Edited sites in mitochondrial genes
undergo from four to 15 times more C-to-T replacements than C residues at synonymous non-edited 3 rd
positions [19]. The elevated substitution rate at edited
sites is not a consequence of hyper-mutability of DNA
motives coincidentally associated with editing. It is, in
fact, quite the opposite, since edited sites are usually
embedded in regions with low mutation rates [7,20].
Similarly to other studies [19,20], we compare the rate of
C-to-T mutations in edited sites with the rate of C-to-T
mutations in 3rd codon positions. In most lineages (about
8 of the 12 analyzed families), the rate of C-to-T change in
edited sites is not significantly different than the rate of C-

Page 10 of 15

to-T change in 3 rd codon positions. This may indicate
that, in at least a subset of our taxon sampling, edited sites
are behaving in a neutral fashion, with no evidence of
selection acting to remove them from the genes. It is noteworthy that mutation rates tend to be lower in all of the
taxa where the rate of removal of edited sites can be
explained exclusively by the synonymous rate of C-to-T
mutations. This could further support the hypothesis that
at higher substitution rates edited sites become "a burden"
to the genome, whereas at low substitution rates this "burden" is so small that edited sites behave as practically neutral. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this
is a spurious pattern caused by the small number of substitutions observed in our dataset.
An additional caveat of comparing the rate of change in
edited sites with the rate of change in 3rd codon positions
is the assumption that the latter changes are effectively
neutral. It is known that edited sites conserve a cis-element that is most likely independent of codon location.
This could decrease the rate of C-to-T change in 3 rd
codon positions, since many of those positions may need
to be conserved for maintenance of cis-elements. This
may result in the comparison of a potentially neutral
change in the edited site to 3rd positions restricted from
C-to-T changes. This bias will be greater in densely edited genes, and it may hide positive selection for C's at
certain edited sites. In addition to the recognition of
cis-elements, differences in codon preference could also
be acting to restrict the rate of change in 3rd codon positions in some groups [39].
In contrast to what is found in the other families, the
frequency of C-to-T change at edited sites in the core
Hydrocharitaceae and some Alismataceae was up to ca.
80 times greater than the frequency of similar changes
in 3 rd codon positions (Table 3). In fact, in many
Hydrocharitaceae all C-to-T substitutions occur exclusively at edited site for four of the five genes analyzed.
Two different processes may affect the number of edited
sites in these taxa: 1) an accelerated substitution rate
and perhaps stronger selection against editing, and 2)
retroprocessing, meaning gene conversion with a cDNA
intermediary [26-28].
Likely instances of gene conversion or insertions of
processed paralogs

A non-random distribution of editing sites has been
shown in a number of genes in the plant mitochondrion
[27]. This means that in coding regions groups of edited
sites are separated by gaps with limited or no editing. It
has also been shown that the distribution of edited sites
in some genes corresponds to functional domains of the
protein, where selection will favor conservation of editing
[1]. Therefore, edited C's outside the structural domains
will more easily lose the ability to be edited, as changes in

Cuenca et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/349

the amino acid composition will have a smaller impact on
protein function. However, this hypothesis does not
explain the simultaneous loss of edited sites in large
regions of the gene. To explain this, several authors have
suggested the occurrence of gene conversion with a
cDNA copy (e.g., retroprocessing [24]) removing adjacent
edited sites and replacing them with the edited sequence
[27]. As with many other processes affecting the
dynamics of editing, the lack of empirical evidence is
manifest. Nothing is known about the sizes of contiguous
stretches that retroprocessing could be modifying, or
about the recurrence of such events.
Correlations between the number of changes in edited
sites and dS in nad5 highlight three instances where the
elimination of edited sites is very high irrespective of the
synonymous substitution rate (indicated in Figures. 2 and
3 with the names EE, ABL and HH). We believe that the
rapid loss of 14 (EE), 16 (HH), and 18 (ABL) edited sites
in these clades could be caused by retroprocessing. One
single event of gene conversion could explain the complete elimination of all edited sites in the HH clade and
the removal of 17 of the 18 edited sites in the ABL clade
(Figure 3). Only in the HH clade is accelerated substitution found. It has been suggested that the insertion of a
processed paralog could affect the mutation rate, because
the reverse-transcriptase needed to generate the cDNA
copies is an error-prone enzyme [23]. However, an insertion of this sort is a single occurrence; it would only have
the possibility of introducing a large number of mutations in the apparent ancestor of the group (in which the
retroprocessing occurred). Such an occurrence would not
explain why all members of the HH clade still show an
accelerated substitution rate. It is also unclear how this
process could generate an accelerated substitution rate in
one clade, but not in others where retro-transcription
also may have occurred. The increase in substitution rate
in a processed paralog has been associated with its reinsertion into the nucleus [26], but we do not accept this
explanation primarily because some edited sites have
been regained in the clade (albeit their editing status has
not been confirmed by comparison to cDNA copies), and
secondarily, because the nad5 gene of these taxa still possesses at least one intron. An alternative possibility is the
insertion of a cDNA copy (a processed paralog [28])
causing partial gene duplication, and thereby relaxing the
selection pressure on one of the copies. However, no evidence of gene duplication or a significant selective shift
towards neutrality was found in the group, although
more thorough tests need to be performed.
In cob, the insertion of a processed paralog is proposed to have occurred in the core Hydrocharitaceae,
removing all edited sites in the group [28]. This conclusion is confirmed by our analyses (Figures. 1 and 3).
Together with the loss of all edited sites, a single

Page 11 of 15

synonymous substitution was found in this branch. In
contrast, its sister clade (Stratiotes) showed seven synonymous substitutions, but no change in edited sites. A
slight acceleration in the substitution rate seems to have
occurred in this group, but this occurred after the edited
sites were removed, and only in more terminal branches
such as Halophila. In the Alismataceae clade the situation is less clear. In this particular branch the frequency
of C-to-T changes at edited sites over synonymous substitutions is up to 30:1, indicating either very strong
selection against edited sites, several events of retroprocessing, or gene conversion with a partially edited
cDNA copy [40].
In ccmB, 22 losses of edited sites were found in the
branch leading to the Alismataceae s.l.; however, the
losses occurring in this branch seem to be evenly distributed along the gene with the exception of eight edited sites lost in a section of 122 nt, and five lost in a
section of 21 nt (Figure 3). Thus, even if the loss of 13
edited sites is explained by two gene conversion events,
there are still nine others that cannot be easily explained
by this phenomenon. This explanation assumes that retroprocessing affects large stretches in the gene. However, recent evidence suggests that "microconversion"
[24] affecting only one or few contiguous sites could be
acting to actively eliminate edited sites.
Similarly, the loss of eleven edited sites in Hydrocleys
could be explained by one gene conversion event that
occurred in the last section of 287 nt at the 3' end of
ccmB.
Correlation between substitution rate and number of
edited sites

For three of the four genes analyzed, we found a correlation between synonymous substitution rates and the
number in changes in edited sites per branch in the phylogeny. Except for ccmB, this correlation is consistent
with the observation that taxa with higher R S tend to
have suffered major changes in the number of edited
sites and have fewer codons that need to be edited
(Table 2). As expected, correlations between substitution
rates and the number of edited sites increase considerably
when cases of suspected insertion of cDNA copies are
removed from the calculations, as in members of Hydrocharitaceae in cob and nad5. An inverse correlation
between substitution rates and editing frequency has
been suggested by several authors [16,21,23,41], together
with the idea that plants displaying an unusual frequency
of editing could be those exceptional in having either
very high or low rates of synonymous substitution [19].
Our analysis shows that heterogeneity in editing frequency may be found in taxa without exceptional substitution rates. Lynch et al. [21] suggested that the effect of
selection against edited sites is only relevant under higher

Cuenca et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/349

mutation rates, whereas genomes with lower rates would
be prone to high frequency of editing, reducing the associated mutation load [16]. Although heterogeneity in substitution rates is found within Alismatales, the differences
between fast and slowly evolving taxa are almost negligible when compared with other groups (e.g, Geraniaceae
or Caryophyllids). However, we still found that taxa with
lower mutation rates tend to have elevated numbers of
edited sites. The correlation found between substitution
rates and number of edited sites is obscured by other
processes such as genetic drift, positive selection, and
retroprocessing. In some cases, the presence of taxa that
do not conform with this pattern, viz. taxa with reduced
editing frequency and low substitution rate, may be
explained by gene conversion or insertion of a processed
paralog. In other cases, however, retroprocessing is not a
useful alternative to explain low substitution rates
coupled with low editing frequency, i.e., when the editing
sites are lost randomly across the gene, and not in contiguous stretches. The opposite condition is also found, e.
g., in taxa with a high substitution rate and high levels of
editing (e.g., ccmB in Lilaea). The strongest correlation
between d S and editing frequency was found in mtt2.
Substitution rates in this gene are considerably higher in
taxa that have lost most of their editing sites. This makes
it difficult to determine whether the lack of most edited
sites is a consequence of the high substitution rate (e.g.,
in Halophila) or whether gene conversion has occurred,
and if accelerated substitution rate is a consequence of
this phenomenon instead.

Conclusions
In this paper, we have focused on the effect of substitution rates on the rate of change of edited sites. A correlation between the synonymous substitution rate and
editing frequency has been found; however, this correlation is weak and is diminished by recurrent gene conversion or insertion of processed paralogs. Additionally,
selection does not actively remove edited sites in nine of
the 12 families of the core Alismatales. In the remaining
three families an up to ca. 80 times increased rate of loss
of edited sites with respect to C-to-T changes in non-edited 3rd codon positions was found, indicating either that
selection against editing sites is particularly severe in
these lineages, or that a different type of process (e.g., retroprocessing) is particularly prone to occur in these taxa.
Why retroprocessing has occurred repeatedly in the same
groups is something that needs to be explored.
Although the effects of substitution rates, selection and/
or gene conversion in shaping the dynamics of editing
sites in plant mitochondria is still an open question, it is
possible that another type of nuclear mechanism is directly
involved in the evolution of edited sites. Recent evidence
indicates that a particular class of pentatricopeptide repeat

Page 12 of 15

proteins (PPR) is involved in a number of processes within
plant mitochondria, and that their proliferation roughly
corresponds with the number of edited sites present in different lineages [[42] and references therein]. Hence, an
increased understanding of the role of PPR proteins may
hold the key to a better understanding of the evolution of
RNA editing in plant mitochondria.

Methods
Forty-six taxa were included in this study, comprising
the twelve families that form the core Alismatales.
Seven taxa from Tofieldiaceae, Araceae, and Acorales
are included in the outgroup (Tables S1 in Additional
file 1). DNA extraction was performed using the plant
DNA kit (Qiagen, Solvna, Sweden).
The data used in this study include five coding mitochondrial genes (cob, atp1, exon 2 of nad5, mtt2, and
ccmB) comprising 4357 characters after alignment.
Sequences of cob and atp1 were reused from Petersen et
al. [28], the remaining were produced for this study. The
PCR amplification primers used are shown in Table S5
in Additional file 1. Amplification reactions were performed in 50 μl total volume using about 50 ng of template DNA, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Ampliqon,
Rødovre, Denmark), 40 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM of
each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2 , and 10× standard buffer
provided by the company. The resulting PCR products
were visualised on a 1% agarose gel and purified using
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Purified PCR
products were sequenced using ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing v2.0 Ready Reaction Kit (AP
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplification primers
were used as sequencing primers in mtt2 and ccmB, and
additional internal primers were used to recover overlapping sequences for nad5, cob and atp1. Sequencing
products were cleaned with Qiagen Dye-Ex Spin columns and analyzed on an ABI PRISM (PE Biosystems)
automated DNA sequencer.
cDNA sequences were generated either from fresh
plants or tissue stored in RNAlater (Qiagen). Total RNA
was extracted using the Total RNA extraction kit
(Ambion, Austin, TX) and DNAased with 1 μL of
DNAase I (Promega, Madison, WI). The one step RTPCR kit (Qiagen) was used to generate cDNAs and to
amplify each region. Specific RNA primers were designed
to anneal in the junction between the exon 1 and exon 2
of nad5 (Table S5 in Additional file 1). For the other
genes in this study, the DNA primers were used. RT-PCR
was performed in accordance to the protocol provided by
the producer and using 50°C for 30 min. to generate the
cDNA copies and 52°C as annealing temperature during
the DNA amplification.
Edited sites were estimated using PREP-Mt [10]. This
program works by contrasting the predicted amino acid

Cuenca et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/349

sequence to the possible states of a codon with/without
RNA editing against a homologous amino acid site of the
coding gene from which RNA editing has been experimentally determined or from organisms with lack of editing capability. Results of PREP-MT were verified by
comparison to the cDNA sequences that we generated
(Table S2 in Additional file 1). For the purposes of this
study, we considered a site as edited when at least one
taxon showed an edited C at a particular position of the
alignment, even though cDNA sequences were not
obtained for all included taxa. All sites with experimental
evidence of editing in some taxa but not edited in others
were excluded from the analysis.
Phylogenetic reconstruction was carried out in PAUP*
ver. 4.0b10 [43] using parsimony as the optimality criterion. The effect of edited sites in phylogenetic reconstruction is spurious, in particular if both homologous
and processed paralogs are sampled. To minimize this
potential source of error, we excluded the edited sites
from the analyses. An initial heuristic search was carried
out with 1000 replicates, holding a maximum of 10
trees per replicate. A random stepwise addition
sequence was used to create the starting tree in each
replicate. Branch swapping was performed using treebisection reconnection (TBR) with MulTrees in effect. A
second search was performed by TBR-swapping the
trees saved from the 1000 replicates in the first search.
Bootstrap proportions were calculated based on 500
bootstrap replicates, using the same settings as for each
replicate in the heuristic search, but with only 10 random stepwise addition sequences per replicate.
Maximum likelihood (ML) searches were performed
using GARLI version 0.96b8 [44] with the general timereversible model + invariant sites + gamma-distributed
rate heterogeneity and the default settings for the search
algorithm. Five initial runs of GARLI were carried out
to ensure that the same topology was achieved.
In order to study the dynamics of loss and gain of edited
sites during the evolution of the group, MacClade ver.
4.08 [45] was used to map edited sites. To do so, a matrix
including only edited sites was constructed for each gene.
Parsimony was used to reconstruct the states for each
node of the phylogeny, and in the case of ambiguities in
the mapping, they were resolved favoring parallel loss
(DELTRAN) of edited sites over reversals (ACCTRAN).
This decision is based on previous studies indicating that
loses of edited sites are more probable that gains [19]. As
a second approach, we predicted the amino acid sequence
of the existing data and used PAML v. 4.2 [46] to reconstruct the ancestral amino acid sequence for each node in
the phylogeny. This was done in codeml using the JTT
amino acid substitution model [47]. Similarly, we reconstructed ancestral codon sequences. This was done assuming equal codon frequencies at equilibrium, equal amino

acid distance, and treating w as a free parameter. We then
compared the amino acid and codon sequence for each
node, and tracked changes in edited sites on each branch.
Both methods of character mapping gave similar results.
The only difference was in the way a few characters are
optimized at the base of the three. As these differences do
not have a major impact on the character mapping, only
the parsimony mapping will be considered in further
analyses.
Synonymous branch lengths (d S) were estimated for
each gene in HyPHy ver. 0.99 [48] using one parsimony
tree and the MG94×HKY85_3×4 codon model with the
local option in effect, allowing independent estimates for
each branch of the tree. A pairwise relative rate test was
used to estimate the probability of heterogeneity in the
synonymous substitution rate between two taxa. This was
also carried out in HyPhy using Tofieldia as outgroup.
In order to obtain the absolute synonymous substitution rate, a temporal scale is needed. To obtain relative
ages of different clades, we use an age of 130 Ma to fix
the age of Alismatales (sensu APGIII [29]), following
previous monocot dating analyses based on rbcL [49].
Dating analyses were performed on the same topology
as used to map edited sites. Because sequences of ccmB
are missing for five taxa, this region was excluded from
branch length calculations, together with the edited sites
of the remaining regions. Estimates of branch lengths
were obtained from the concatenated matrix by maximum likelihood optimization using the GTR+G+I
model in PAUP*, with all parameters estimated from
the dataset. Non-parametric rate smoothing as implemented in r8s [32] was used to obtain divergence times.
Searches were restarted five times with a perturbation of
the initial parameters to ensure that the solution
reached a stable optimum.
The branch lengths were divided by duration time of
to obtain an absolute value of synonymous substitutions
per branch per gene (RS). However, as single gene d S
values gave many branches with zero length, we used
the distance to the most recent common ancestor
(MRCA) of the core Alismatales divided by the age estimated for this node (79.1 Ma) to obtain a rough approximation of the absolute synonymous substitution rate for
each taxon.
Changes in 3rd codon positions were optimized on the
tree using the same strategy as for optimization of edited
sites. In this case, however, we did not decide a priori
how to resolve ambiguities in optimization. C to T
changes in 3rd codon positions were counted in the same
manner as changes in edited sites (e.g., by adding up the
changes from all branches leading from the ancestor) in
order to compare both estimates. Fisher exact test was
used to assess whether the C-to-T changes were significant different in edited sites than in 3rd codon positions.

Species are part of a hierarchical structured phylogeny,
and cannot be considered as independent points in a
regression analysis [35]. However, comparisons between
sister clades allow us to test character correlations,
because two sister branches are independent of each
other after diverging. For each gene, except atp1, we
calculated the d S distance from node-to-tip for each
terminal branch in the tree. For branches deeper in the
tree this was done by averaging the branch lengths from
the daughter branches [33,34]. The same was done for
the number of changes in edited sites for each branch.
Independent contrasts were calculated as differences in
branch lengths (d S) and number of changes in edited
sites for sister clades descending from each node. As sister clades are of the same age, differences in their
branch lengths directly reflect differences in their synonymous substitution rate, and the same applies to differences in rate of change in edited sites. We used a
regression through the origin to explore the relationship
[50] between dS and number of changes in edited sites.
Additionally, we used Felsenstein's method of phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC, [35]) as implemented in the PDAP package v. 1.14 [51] for Mesquite v.
2.72 [52]. In this analysis, contrasts were calculated for
1) the absolute synonymous substitution rate of each
species (RS, shown in Table S4 in Additional file 1) and
the number of changes in edited sites counted from the
MRCA of the Alismatales to the tip of the tree, and 2)
the RS and the number of edited sites present in each
taxa. The PIC analyses were performed after standardizing for the age of the split among sister groups [53]. For
each gene, the Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for each set of contrasts. In nad5 and cob many
members of the Hydrocharitaceae have lost all their edited sites, and independent of the substitution rate, no
more changes occur at these sites. In these cases, the
PIC analyses were performed 1) including all taxa of
Hydrocharitaceae, 2) removing the taxa of Hydrocharitaceae without edited sites but leaving the longest branch,
and 3) removing the taxa of Hydrocharitaceae without
edited sites but leaving the shortest branch.
