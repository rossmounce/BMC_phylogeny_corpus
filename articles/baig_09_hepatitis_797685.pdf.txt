Abstract
Background: As the hepatitis B genotyping is important for assessing its clinical implications and
geographical distribution, the sub-genotypes have been found useful for determination of specific
genomic markers related to hepatocarcinogenesis. In Pakistan, there is no reported data on
molecular evolutionary analysis of HBV. A study was, therefore, much needed to evaluate the
spectra of mutations present in the strains prevalent here.
Findings: to confirm specificity of PCR typing, phylogenetic analysis of the pre-S1 region and the
divergence was studied through 13 sequences of 362 bp (accession number EF432765 – EF432777).
A total of 315 serum samples, selected from HBsAg positive patients representing the major ethnic
groups, residing in Karachi, Sindh were tested for genotyping. Genotype D (219/315) was found to
be the most prevalent (70%) amongst our patients. The rest of the genotypes A and a mixture of
A and D (AD) were distributed as 20%, and 10% respectively. Phylogenetic tree demonstrated
clustering of 11 samples with subgenotype D1 sequences and the remaining two strains on a branch
within D3 samples. All samples intermixed with strains from other countries and were found to be
closely related to Indian, Iranian and Egyptian HBV strains with 98.7 – 99.0% homology.
Conclusion: This study confirms the predominance of genotype D in southeastern Asia and
presence of subgenotypes DI and D3 in the Pakistani infected patients. More studies are required
to investigate the reason for fewer inclusions of D3 compared to the D1 in Pakistani HBV strains.

Findings
The structural and functional differences between HBV
genotypes are the mainstay to severity, complications,
treatment and possibly vaccination against the virus. Subgenotypes have been identified in different HBV genotypes on the basis of a > 4% (but < 8%) difference in the
complete nucleotide sequences [1]. The phylogenetic
method, a reliable tool to study the divergence in the
HBV, are now being utilized to elucidate the history and
origin of HBV genome scattered geographically around

the world [2]. It has become well known that the genotypes/sub-genotypes vary in the geographical areas and
correlate strongly with ethnicity [3]. Pakistan is one of the
intermediate HBV endemic countries having distinct multiethnic populations. However, sufficient information on
the molecular epidemiology of HBV is not available.
There is no data on subgenotypes and their recombination or the phylogenetic relatedness of the virus endemic
in the country. Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan and
capital of the province of Sindh, is considered 'mini PakiPage 1 of 7

stan' as all ethnic groups including Punjabis, Sindhis,
Pukhtoons, Balochis and migrants from India and
Afghanistan are living here. A study was therefore, undertaken to analyze DNA sequence of the 362 nucleotides of
pre S gene of randomly selected HBV isolates from
patients with hepatitis B in Karachi. The objective of the
study, was to determine the genotypes and subgenotypes
and to analyze the spectra of mutations through phylogenetic analysis of HBV strains prevalent in Pakistan.

Results
Prevalence of HBV/D as the most common genotype
Genotype D (219/315) was found to be the most prevalent (70%) amongst our patients. The rest of the genotypes A and a mixture of A and D (AD) were distributed as
20%, and 10% respectively (Table 1).
Dominance of subgenotype D1 and D3
The sequence of nucleotide and the amino acid residue
are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Among the
samples studied through phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3),
all 13 belonged to genotype D, including 11 to subgenotype D1 and 2 to D3.
Frequency and Distribution of Mutations in the PreS Gene
The nucleotide sequences of the samples with genotype D
were compared to those of reference D1 sequences
AY741798 from Iran, AY161159 from India, AY796032
from Turkey and reference D3 sequences AY373430 from
India, EI00615 from Eastern India, X85254 from Italy and
V01460 from France. In the 11 samples of genotype D,
mutations were detected at 27 different sites and insertion
of nucleotide C was noted after nt 2893 in sample
562HBV2 (Figure 1). Amino acid sequences of part of the
pre S protein (14–135) for the HBV isolates from the
study samples with genotype D were compared with the
amino acid sequences of the same reference sequences
(Figure 2).

Discussion
On the basis of 362 nucleotides sequence in the pre S
gene, this study demonstrates that Hepatitis B virus geno-

type D with subgenotype D1 and D3 is circulating in Karachi, Pakistan. Previously, several studies have been
conducted which report Pakistan among many regions
with intermediate to high HBV sero-prevalence, with D
being the most prevalent genotype [4,5]. Our study was
based on patients who, either were settlers in Karachi but
originally belonged to different provinces or had come to
Karachi for treatment. The pattern of genotype prevalence
found through this study is in line with the studies from
South East Asia, especially the countries sharing borders
with Pakistan and thus confirms the high proportion of
genotype D in southeastern Asia.
In Asia, research on genotyping, was initially conducted
extensively in Japan and China, therefore, the genotypes
of these countries namely B & C were considered as the
most prevalent genotypes of Asia. Later on, when research
was extended to other countries, predominance of D was
found in South Asia and the Middle East such as India,
Afghanistan and Iran [6-9]. The genotype D, in particular,
happens to be most widely distributed and found universally, with its highest prevalence in a belt stretching from
Southern Europe and North Africa to India, and in West
and South Africa, having intravenous drug users as the
most affected population within these countries [10,11].
This study, therefore, highlights the genotypic link
between various ethnic groups within the country and
people of the neighboring countries.
Phylogenetic analysis of genotype D could distinguish
four subgenotypes, D1 to D5 [1,12]. The geographical distribution of the subgenotypes within D was found less
restricted than that of genotypes A, B, and C, although the
strains from Middle East mainly belonged to D1, those
from South Africa and Alaska to D3, while those from
Oceania and Somalia to D4. Whereas, D5 was only
reported from Japan and India. The majority of the strains
in this study belonged to subgenotype D1(84.6%). This
subgenotype has mainly been shown in strains from Turkey, India, Iraq, Iran and Israel [11]. History of population
migration from the Middle East to Pakistan is well known,
which explains the predominance of HBV/D1 infection in

this population. In neighboring India, genotype D is predominant with presence of subgenotypes D1, D2, D3 and
D5 [1,12]. None of these subgenotypes was characterized
by specific amino acid substitutions [11].
Two strains which clustered on a branch within the D3
samples EF432767 and EF584672 were more similar to
each other than to the other D3 strains and seem to be
derived from a phylogenetically related common ancestor.
The ayw3 specifying strains within this subgenotype D3
have so far been reported from IDUs in Europe and the
USA [11]. More studies are needed to investigate if the D3
strains have had fewer introductions into Pakistan compared to the D1 strains. The isolates studied, were found
closely related to each other rather than with other D
sequences, clustering near each other having 98.1–99%
identity between the sequences. This close relationship
demonstrates a consistent circulation of closely related
viruses within this relatively multidimensional population.
Besides genotype D (76.3%), being the most prevalent,
20% of patients of the present study were found to be
infected with genotype A, whereas 10% were co-infected
with both types A and D. A recombination between genotypes A and D has also been reported from India [13].
Presence of mixed genotypes A and D in this study indicated a need for further studies for evaluation of possible
recombination in samples from Pakistan. Studies from
India have generally reported a similar pattern, predominance of genotype D coexisting with varying proportion
of genotype A. HBV genotype D has also been described as
the genotype of intravenous illicit drug users [14]. In a
Pakistani study on IDUs by Alam et al. [5], the genotype
distribution was found to be quite similar to the one in
our study; genotype D at 62.5%; genotype A, 8.9% while
28.5% individuals were found to be infected with a mixture of genotype A & D. In our patients, the A and D combination was 10% compared to 28.5% reported earlier in
Pakistani IDUs. This three times high percentage explains
the cross contamination due to sharing of the syringes.
Even triple infection has been reported in 0.9% of HBV
infected intravenous drug users from areas where 3 HBV
genotypes A, B and C are prevalent such as in China [15].

Conclusion
This study confirms the predominance of genotype D in
southeastern Asia. The sub-genotypes D1 and D3, dominate
in the Pakistani patients. All isolates closely matched with
those reported from Iran, India and Egypt. More studies are
required to find out the genotypic heterogeneity as a result
of intermixing with strains due to population migration.

din University Hospital (ZUH), diagnosed positive for
HBV by HBsAg (ELISA – MUREX kit by Abbott Laboratories). The patients were randomly selected irrespective of
their age and gender and a written consent (parental consent in case of under 18 years of age) was obtained. The
study was approved by the Ziauddin University ethical
review committee.
DNA extraction and Amplification by PCR
DNA was extracted from 200 μl of serum using extraction
kit (QIA AMP DNA mini kit 250 reactions Cat #51306). A
modified version of nested PCR developed by Naito et al.
[16] was followed for amplification. The step one PCR was
carried out with universal outer primers P1 (sense) and S12 (antisense) in a tube containing 50 μl of a reaction buffer
made up of the following components: 50 ng of each outer
primer, a 200 μM concentration of each of the four deoxynucleotides, 1 U of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, Conn.), and 10× PCR buffer containing 1.5 mM
MgCl2. The thermocycler (GeneAmp PCR system 2400,
9600, and 9700; Perkin-Elmer) was programmed to first
incubate the samples for 2 min at 94°C, followed by 35
cycles consisting of 94°C for 20 s, 55°C for 20 s, and 72°C
for 1 min with a final extension of 5 min at 72°C and incubation at 4°C. Two second-round PCRs were performed for
each sample, with the common universal sense primer B2
used as the inner primer (sense) with a combination called
mix A for genotypes A, B and C. Mix B consisted of antisense primer B2R with a combination of Mix B for genotypes D, E and F. A 2.5 μl aliquot of the first PCR product
was added to two tubes containing the second sets of each
of the inner primer pairs, each of the deoxynucleotides, Taq
polymerase and PCR buffer, as in the first reaction and
amplified for 35 cycles with: preheating at 94°C for 3 min,
15 cycles of amplification at 94°C for 20 s, 58°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 40 s, and an additional 20 cycles of 94°C for
30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s with an extension of
7 min. at 72°C and incubation at 4°C. Genotypes of HBV
for each sample were determined by identifying the genotype-specific DNA bands on electrophoresis. Positive PCR
results were repeated twice for confirmation.
Sequencing
The PCR product of 1065 bp obtained with the universal
primers P1 and S1-2 was sequenced in 13 HBV genotype
D strains on an automated DNA sequencer by Gene Link
USA.
Data analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was done using sequences from various countries retrieved from the international DNA database (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank).

Methods
Specimens
Blood was drawn from 350 patients undergoing treatment
at Pakistan Medical Research Council (PMRC) and Ziaud-

The best and the high scoring matches with our sequences
were aligned with the CLUSTAL W software program [17]
and the alignment was confirmed by visual inspection.

Phylogenetic analysis of a 362 nt fragment of the S gene
employing MEGA, version 2.0 [18], and PHYLIP, version
3.54c [19], was the basis for HBV genotyping using
Kimura's 2-parameter algorithms with the neighbourjoining method. The reliability of different phylogenetic
groupings was evaluated using the bootstrap test (1000
bootstrap replications). As almost identical groupings
were observed with these tree-building programs, only the
MEGA-based tree is presented.
