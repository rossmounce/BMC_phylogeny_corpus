In Medicago truncatula, water deficit modulates
the transcript accumulation of components of
small RNA pathways
Cláudio Capitão1*, Jorge AP Paiva2, Dulce M Santos3 and Pedro Fevereiro1,4

Abstract
Background: Small RNAs (sRNAs) are 20-24 nucleotide (nt) RNAs and are involved in plant development and response
to abiotic stresses. Plants have several sRNA pathways implicated in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing
of gene expression. Two key enzyme families common to all pathways are the Dicer-like (DCL) proteins involved in
sRNAs maturation and the Argonautes (AGOs) involved in the targeting and functional action of sRNAs. Posttranscriptional silencing mediated by AGOs may occur by cleavage or translational repression of target mRNA’s, while
transcriptional silencing may be controlled by DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. Thus far, these gene
families have not been characterized in legumes, nor has their involvement in adaptation to water deficit been studied.
Results: A bioinformatic search in Medicago truncatula genome databases, using Arabidopsis thaliana AGO and
DCL cDNA and protein sequences, identified three sequences encoding for putative Dicer-like genes and twelve
sequences encoding for putative Argonaute genes. Under water deficit conditions and mainly in roots, MtDCL1
and MtAGO1, two enzymes probably involved in the processing and activation of microRNAs (miRNAs), increased
their transcript levels. mir162 which target DCL1 mRNA and mir168 which target AGO1 mRNA reduced their
expression in the roots of plants subjected to water deficit. Three putative genes, MtDCL3, MtAGO4b and MtAGO4c
probably involved in DNA methylation mechanisms, increased their mRNA levels. However, the mRNA levels of
MtAGO6 reduced, which probably encodes a protein with functions similar to MtAGO4. MtAGO7 mRNA levels
increased and possibly encodes a protein involved in the production of trans-acting small interfering RNAs. The
transcript abundance of MtAGO12a, MtAGO12b and MtAGO12c reduced under water deprivation. Plants recovered
from water deprivation reacquire the mRNA levels of the controls.
Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that in M. truncatula the transcript accumulation of the components of small
RNA pathways is being modulated under water deficit. This shows that the transcriptional and post-transcriptional
control of gene expression mediated by sRNAs is probably involved in plant adaptation to abiotic environmental
changes. In the future this will allow the manipulation of these pathways providing a more efficient response of
legumes towards water shortage.

Background
In plants, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression mediated by sRNAs [1] is
involved in several biological processes, ranging from
organ differentiation to biotic and abiotic stress responses
[2-4]. Small RNAs are divided into two main classes based

on their biogenesis: the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
are processed from perfect and long double-stranded
RNAs while miRNAs are processed from single-stranded
RNA transcripts that fold back onto themselves producing
an imperfectly double-stranded stem loop [5]. The endogenous siRNAs are divided into trans-acting-siRNAs (tasiRNAs) and heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs) [6].
The pathways of gene silencing mediated by sRNAs
share, in plants, four consensus biochemical steps [7]: (1)
the biosynthesis of a double strand RNA (dsRNA); (2)
the cutting of the dsRNA by a Dicer-like protein (DCL) in

18-25 nt-long sRNAs; (3) the O-methylation of the sRNAs
by Hua Enhancer (HEN1), to protect them from degradation through the Small RNA Degrading Nuclease (SDN)
class of exonucleases [8]; and (4) the integration of the
sRNAs into an Argonaute (AGO) that associates with
other proteins to promote gene silencing by partially or
fully complementation with target RNA or DNA.
Plants have at least four different DCL proteins and
each generates predominantly a particular class of
sRNAs: DCL1 cleaves the imperfect double-stranded
stem loop generating the miRNAs with around 21-nt
[9]; DCL2 produces viral siRNAs 22-nt long [10]; DCL3
generates hc-siRNAs with 24-nt [10]; and DCL4 generates ta-siRNAs 21-nt long [11].
Plant DCLs contain six domains: one PAZ, two RNaseIII, one DEAD-helicase box (DEXD/H-box), one
DUF283, at least one double-stranded RNA-binding
(dsRB) domain and one Helicase-C domain [12]. The PAZ
domain binds to double-stranded RNAs at the 3’ end [13].
The two RNaseIII domains form an intramolecular dimer
and the active site of each domain cleaves the dsRNA [14].
The DExD/H-box domain might have an auto-inhibitory
function, because removal of this domain increases the
cleavage rate of the human dicer [14]. The DUF283
domain displays affinity to bind the double-stranded
RNA-binding domains of the A. thaliana dsRNA binding
proteins (DRBs) [15] suggesting a functional role in the
selection of the small RNA processing pathway.
The A. thaliana and Oryza sativa genomes have been
completely sequenced and annotated [16,17]. These plant
species encode ten and eighteen AGOs, respectively
[16,17]. Both species share common phylogenetic related
AGOs that are divided in three clades [18]. In A. thaliana
some AGOs are well studied, for example AGO1 binds
the miRNAs to mediate the cleavage of targets mRNAs
and together with AGO10 both promote the translational
repression of the targets but with different selectivity for
the miRNAs [19,20]. AGO4, AGO6 and AGO9 fall in
another clade and they are associated with hc-siRNAs to
control DNA methylation [21]. AGO7 in the last clade is
implicated in the production of the ta-siRNAs [22].
The AGO proteins generally contain one variable Nterminal region and one conserved C-terminal region
constituted by the PAZ, middle (MID) and PIWI
domains [23]. The PAZ domain binds to the 3’ end of
the guide strand of the sRNAs. The PIWI domain is
responsible for the Argonaute slicer activity. The cleavage activity is carried out by the active site on the
PIWI domain usually presenting an Asp-Asp-His (DDH)
motif [19,24]. The slicer activity of Argonaute requires a
perfect complementarity around the cleavage site of the
guide-target duplex [25]. The 5’ phosphate group of the
sRNA guide strand is buried in a deep pocket at interface between the MID domain and PIWI domain [23].

In A. thaliana, the sRNAs association with the Argonaute proteins is based on the recognition of the 5’ end
nucleotide. This specificity is mediated by the MID
domain [26]. For example AGO1 binds mainly to RNAs
with a uridine at their 5’ end, whereas AGO2, AGO4,
AGO6 and AGO9 recruit RNAs with a 5’ end adenosine
and the AGO5 predominantly binds to sRNAs with a
cytosine [21,26].
The biogenesis of miRNAs is under feedback regulation such that two key players are themselves regulated
by miRNAs. DCL1 mRNA has a complementary
sequence for miR162, which leads to the cleavage of
DCL1 mRNA [27]. Likewise, AGO1 mRNA contains a
complementary sequence for miR168 which leads to
AGO1-mediated cleavage of AGO1 mRNA [28].
Medicago truncatula is a model legume [29], and its
genome is almost completely sequenced (accessed 2
April 2010) [30]. However, almost nothing is known
about the identification and function of AGO and DCL
genes in legumes species. In M. truncatula several
sRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in different organs and abiotic stress conditions [2,3,31,32].
Recently we described the up-regulation of miR398a/b
and miR408 under water deficit and the corresponding
down regulation of their respective targets, COX5b and
plantacyanin [4]. However, no studies have been reported
implicating the modulation of small RNA pathways in
response to either water deficit or any other abiotic stress
in legumes.
In the present study we identify three putative DCL
and twelve putative AGO genes in the M. truncatula
genome. We also established their phylogenetic relationship with the A. thaliana DCLs (AtDCLs) and AGOs
(AtAGOs) and performed their domain characterization.
The mRNA levels of these genes were quantified by
quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) in vegetative growing
plants under water deficit conditions. Our results show
that the mRNA levels of the identified AGO and DCL
genes are modulated when M. truncatula is subjected to
water deprivation.

Methods
Plant material, growth and treatment conditions

Medicago truncatula Gaertn. cv. Jemalong seeds were
scarified and sterilized in concentrated anhydrous sulfuric
acid for 15 minutes according to Araújo et al [33]. After
thoroughly washing with sterile water, seeds were placed
on soaked filter paper in Petri dishes in the dark at 24°C.
Three days later the seeds were transferred to a growth
chamber (thermoperiod of 25/18°C, photoperiod of 16/8 h
day/night, relative humidity of 40% and a Photosynthetic
Photon Flux Density (PPFD) of 500μmol m−2 s−1). One
week old seedlings were transferred to vermiculite for
2 weeks and then individually transferred to 0.5 L pots

with standard commercial non-sterile soil (“terra de Montemor”, Horto do Campo Grande, Lisboa, Portugal). No
nutrients were added to avoid any interference with the
nodulation. The water status and physiological conditions
of the different experimental groups were described in
Nunes et al (2008) [34]. Briefly, eight-weeks-old plants
were divided into four groups. The Control group (Ct,
with a relative water content (RWC) = 80%) was constituted by plants maintained fully irrigated (maximum soil
water capacity) (Additional file 1). The second and third
groups were constituted by plants subjected to water
deprivation for five (Moderate Water Deficit, MWD,
RWC = 50%) and eight days (Severe Water Deficit, SWD,
RWC = 30%). This severe time point was selected because
above this point plants were unable to recover and quickly
died. The fourth group consisted of the SWD plants that
were re-watered for three days following water deficit, and
so regained their original water status (Rec, RWC = 80%).
All plants were nodulated when water uphold was started.
The control plants always showed healthy nodules. At the
severe water deficit condition most of the nodules
senesced, but after 3 days of re-watering the nodules
restart to develop.
Identification of putative Dicer-like and Argonaute genes
in M. truncatula

The mRNA and protein sequences of A. thaliana DCL
and AGO genes were downloaded from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database
[35] (Additional file 2). The algorithms BLASTn and
tBLASTn were used to search the nucleotide sequence
of the genes of interest, using a cut-off E-value of e-20,
in the NCBI database [36], in the DFCI M. truncatula
Gene index version 9.0 (MtGI9.0) and in the M. truncatula genome release version 3.0 (Mt3.0), using CViTBlast and IMGAG-Blast [37].

nomenclature used in A. thaliana and on their family
phylogenetic relationships. Protein isoelectric point (Pi)
was determined with the Protein Isoelectric Point software and calculation of protein molecular weight (MW)
was performed using the Protein Molecular Weight software, both software are from the Sequence Manipulation Suite (SMS) package (version 2.0) [41,42].
Protein domain search

Domain search was performed in the NCBI Conserved
Domain Database (NCBI-CDD) [43-45]. The catalytic
amino acids characteristic of the AGO proteins were identified aligning the PIWI domain sequences of M. truncatula and the known amino acid positions of A. thaliana
AGO1 protein. The identification of the amino acid that
separates the MID domain from the PIWI domain of
MtAGOs protein sequences was obtained from the alignment of Thermus thermophilus AGO (gi:46255097)(PIWI
start - 544), Pyrococcus furiosus AGO (gi:18976909)(PIWI
start - 544), Aquifex aeolicus AGO (gi:15606619) (PIWI
start - 487), human PIWI (gi:24431985) (PIWI start - 731),
human AGO1 (gi:6912352)(PIWI start - 575) and human
AGO2 (gi: 29171734)(PIWI start - 577) [25], with the
AtAGOs and MtAGOs.
Protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree
building

The complete protein sequence of each putative AGO or
DCL gene was used for the construction of the phylogenetic tree. Protein alignment was done using T-Coffee
software [46-48]. The phylogenetic tree was generated
with MEGA4.0 software [49] using the distance model
for amino acid substitution of Jones-Taylor-Thornton
(JTT) matrix, the Neighbor-joining algorithm for clustering and 1000 replications for the bootstrap analysis.
RNA Extraction and quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR)

Characterization of the M. truncatula Dicer-like and
Argonaute genes

The protein and nucleotide sequences of M. truncatula
DCLs and AGOs were downloaded from MTGI9.0 and
Mt3.0 databases. For MtAGO11 and MtAGO12b the
annotation given by the Fgenesh algorithm was chosen.
Fgenesh (Medicago matrix) is one of the gene prediction
algorithms used in M. truncatula genome annotation by
IMGAG (International Medicago Genome Annotation
Group) [38,39]. In cases where the protein sequence was
not available, the translation of the nucleotide sequence
was done with the Translate software from Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) [40]. The end of protein
translation was considered when the first stop codon
appeared. The longest amino acid sequence from the 6
possible reading frames was selected. The newly identified genes in this study were named based on the

Extraction of total RNA from the shoots and roots of four
plants per treatment was done as previously described [4].
The RNA samples were treated with the TURBO DNAfree Kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA) to eliminate DNA
contaminations. Total RNA pools from shoots and roots
and per treatment were made. The RNA quantification
was performed using the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts,
USA). After DNAse digestion, the absorbance ratios of the
RNA samples at 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm were
between1.9-2.0. One μg of RNA from each pool was
reverse transcribed using the Promega-ImProm-II™
Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison,
Wisconsin, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using the poly-T oligonucleotide primer. Three
independent reverse-transcription reactions (RT) were
performed using the RNA pools and each one was diluted

5-fold before each quantitative Real Time Polymerase
Chain Reaction (qPCR) reaction.
PCR primers (Additional file 3) were designed using the
Beacon Designer software (version 7.0) (Premier Biosoft
International, Palo Alto, California, USA). Primers were
designed to have a size between 18-24 bp, GC content of
40-60% and melting temperature (Tm) of 58-62°C. The
MtAGO1 and MtDCL1 primer pairs were designed to
amplify a region containing the cleavage site of miR168
and miR162 respectively. Other criteria, such as primer
self-annealing, were also taken into account. Predicted
fragment size ranged between 80 and 180 bp. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Stabvida (Stabvida, Caparica,
Portugal).
qPCR reactions were performed in an iQ™5 Real-Time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, München,
Germany), by adding 10μl of iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad Laboratories), 4μL of diluted cDNA, 0.5 pmol
of each primer, and water to a final volume of 20μL.
After one initial incubation step at 95°C for 3 min, amplifications were performed for 40 cycles with the following
cycle profile: a denaturing step at 95°C for 15 s followed
by an annealing step at 60°C for 10 s, and an extension
step of 72°C for 10 s. Fluorescence data were collected
during the 72°C step, and the specificity of qPCR products was confirmed by performing a melting temperature analysis at temperatures ranging from 55°C to 95°C
in intervals of 0.5°C. PCR products were run in a 2.5%
agarose gel to confirm the existence of a unique band
with the expected size.
Reference genes were selected based on a previous study
where the accumulation of HDA3, L2, APRT, ELF-1a,
ACT7 and ACT11 (Additional file 3) was quantified on
cDNAs from the plants with different water status and
plant organs (shoots and roots) using the geNorm [50]
and NormFinder [51] in Genex software (version 4.3.8)
(MultiD, Göteborg, Sweden). L2 was found to be the best
reference gene for the experimental conditions (Ct, MWD,
SWD and Rec) and plant organs (shoots and roots) used
in this work.
For all the genes studied, three independent cDNA samples of the RNA pools from each experimental condition
were amplified in technical duplicates, giving a total of 6
replicates for each treatment. The raw, background-subtracted, fluorescence data provided by the iQ5 software
(version 2.0) was analyzed by the real-time PCR Miner
software (version 2.2) [52,53]. The resulting PCR efficiency
and cycle number quantification were used for transcript
quantification. The efficiency for each gene was calculated
using the arithmetic mean of all efficiencies given by PCR
Miner.
The Pfaffl method [54] was used for the relative quantification of the transcript accumulation of the genes of
interest using L2 as reference gene. For each gene the

results were normalized against the shoot control treatment. The One Way ANOVA Test of significance was
used to compare the four conditions in each organ followed by the Tukey Test (SigmaStat version 3.5, Systat
Software Inc., San Jose, California).
The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) check list
could be find in the Additional file 4[55].
miR162 and miR168 northern blot analysis

Total RNA (15μg per lane) was blotted to a Hybond-NX
membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and
hybridized according to Trindade et al [4]. Small nuclear
RNA U6 was used as a loading control. The Locked
Nucleic Acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotides (Exiqon,
Vedbaek, Denmark) complementary to miR168 and
miR162 and the molecular weight probes were labeled
with gP32-ATP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Massachusetts,
USA) according to Trindade et al [4]. Membranes were
striped with boiling 0.1% SDS and hybridized with the
small nuclear RNA U6 loading control probe.

Results
Molecular characterization of MtDCLs and MtAGOs

A BLASTn and tBLASTn search in M. truncatula genome
databases, using A. thaliana DCL and AGO cDNA and
protein sequences, identified three putative coding
sequences for Dicer-like (MtDCLs) genes and twelve putative coding sequences for Argonaute (MtAGOs) genes
(Table 1). MtAGO1 was identified in M. truncatula gene
index database (MTGI9.0), whereas MtDCL2, MtDCL3
and MtAGO11 were only identified in M. truncatula
annotated genome (Mt3.0) (Table 1).
The International Medicago Genome Annotation
Group (IMGAG, Mt3.0) annotated MtAGO12b as three
independent genes: Medtr2g074590.1, Medtr2g074600.1
and Medtr2g074610.1 (Additional file 5). But each
sequence corresponded to an incomplete Argonaute
gene. The Fgenesh annotation of the M. truncatula genome generates a unique gene sequence instead of the
three incomplete genes. Therefore we decided to use the
Fgenesh annotation since it retrieved a more complete
Argonaute gene sequence. The region of Medtr2g074590
not considered by the annotation made by Fgenesh, presented several N entries. This could be the reason why
the Paz domain is incomplete and the DUF1785 is missing (Figure 1, B, AGO12b). The same problem occurred
with MtAGO11 that corresponds to the junction of:
Medtr3g016400.1, Medtr3g016410.1 and Medtr3g016420
(Additional file 6).
The putative MtDCL genes probably encode proteins with
molecular weights that range between 160.96 and 218.32
KDa, with a neutral isoelectric point ranging from 6.22 to
7.30 (Table 1). The predicted MtAGO proteins have a

lower molecular size of ~100 KDa and a basic isoelectric
point between 8.37 and 9.99 (Table 1). The identified DCL
and AGO genes are distributed on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 5,
7 and 8 of M. truncatula (Figure 2) but more concentrated
in chromosomes 2, 3 and 5.
M. truncatula DCL and AGO protein domains

To assign the putative M. truncatula DCL and AGO genes
a Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was generated with
the predicted complete protein sequences of M. truncatula and A. thaliana DCLs and AGOs (Figure 3, A and
Figure 1, A). DCLs and AGOs clustered into 4 and 3 subgroups respectively, similar to those described by Margis
et al, and Vaucheret [12,56]. The names of the M. truncatula predicted proteins were given according to their phylogenetic relationship with A. thaliana protein sequences.
The protein domains searches using the CDD software
from NCBI revealed the presence of DExD, Helicase-c,

DUF283, PAZ, RNaseIIIa/b and dsRBa/b in the predicted
DCL protein sequences analyzed (Figure 3, B). MtDCL2
has only one dsRB domain, similar to the A. thaliana,
Oryza sativa and P. trichocarpa DCL2 proteins [12].
Crystal structure of a full-length Argonaute protein,
from the archaea species Pyrococcus furious, showed
that the sequence motif originally defined as PIWI
domain by Cerutti et al [57] consists of two structural
domains, termed MID and PIWI [58]. Wang et al, [25]
identified the amino acid that separates the MID
domain from the PWI domain in Thermus thermophilus
(Tt), Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf), Aquifex aeolicus (Aa) and
human (Hs) AGO protein sequences [25]. The CDD
software can only find the PIWI domain defined by Cerutti et al [57] and does not separates the MID and PIWI
domains. We aligned these protein sequences together

thaliana (At) AGOs. The complete protein sequences were aligned using the T-Coffee software [46-48] and a Neighbour joining tree was
constructed using the MEGA4.0 software [49]. (B) Characterization of the MtAGO proteins domains. The protein domains were obtained using
the Conserved Domains Database (CDD) database of NCBI. The Argonaute protein domains DUF1785 (purple), PAZ (dark-blue), MID (orange) and
PIWI (black) are shown. (C) The catalytic center of MtAGOs was obtained from the alignment of the PIWI domains, corresponding to the
positions of the aspartate, aspartate and histidine (DDH) motif and the Argonaute 1 histidine at position 800 (H800). D, aspartate, H, histidine, S,
serine, A, alanine, P, proline, R, arginine. Figure B to scale.

Almost all predicted MtAGO proteins presented the
domains DUF1785, PAZ, MID and PIWI (Figure 1, B).
An exception to this is MtAGO12b where the DUF1785
and the PAZ domain are missing. There are several N
entries upstream of the start codon, indicating that the
sequence quality at that site is not good. MtAGO12c
contains one incomplete MID domain and lacks the
PIWI domain, but this fact is unexplainable.
Several structural studies have shown that the PIWI
domain folds similar to RNaseH proteins [58]. Consistent with this observation, some plant and animal Argonaute proteins are known to cleave the target mRNAs
that have sequence complementary to the small RNAs
[19,59]. The catalytic center of these proteins are known
to possess three conserved metal chelating amino acid
residues in the PIWI domain i.e. aspartate, aspartate and
histidine (DDH) that function as a catalytic triad. In A.
thaliana AGO1 the histidine at position 800 (H800) was
also shown to be critical for this endonuclease activity
[19].

To interrogate which of the predicted MtAGOs
included the conserved catalytic residues and could
potentially act as the slicer component of the silencing
effectors complexes, we aligned the PIWI domains of all
the predicted MtAGOs and AtAGOs using T-Coffee
(Additional file 7). Two predicted protein sequences,
MtAGO1 and MtAGO7 were found to have the conserved domain DDH/H (Figure 1, C). In other MtAGOs
like MtAGO12b the motif was missing or the residue
H800 substituted by A, S or P, or in MtAGO2 the H (in
the DDH motif) is substituted by one D (shifting to a
DDD motif), characteristic of AGO2 and AGO3 proteins
in A. thaliana and O. sativa [18].
qPCR of the MtDCLs and MtAGOs

Plants have several Dicer-like and Argonaute genes with
different functions. AtDCL1, AtAGO1 and AtAGO10 are
involved in the miRNAs production and function [20,56].
In our study, plants under water deficit increased the
transcript levels of MtDCL1 and MtAGO1 in the roots

and shoots (Figure 4). Notably, in roots, 5 and 3.5 fold
increase was found for MtDCL1 and MtAGO1 transcripts accumulation under severe water deficit.
Shoots of plants subjected to water deprivation
showed a decrease in the transcript abundance of MtAGO12a, MtAGO12b and MtAGO12c (Figure 4). However a different picture was seen in roots: the mRNA of
MtAGO12a was not detected; MtAGO12b maintained

its mRNA level under water deficit; and the level of
MtAGO12c transcripts decreased significantly following
the same pattern found in shoots.
AtDCL3 cleaves endogenous dsRNA producing 24-nt
sRNAs and AtAGO4, AtAGO6 and AtAGO9 use these
sRNAs to direct transcriptional gene silencing (TGS),
which perform chromatin remodeling [56]. MtAGO6

roots (Figure 4 andAdditional file 8). MtDCL3, MtAGO4b and MtAGO4c increased their transcript abundance in similar way under water deficit in both shoots
and roots. The mRNA levels of MtAGO11 (a protein
similar to AtAGO6 - Figure 1, A) could not be
quantified.
AtAGO7 is involved in the biogenesis of trans-acting
small RNAs (ta-siRNAs) derived from TAS3 RNA [56].
Both shoots and roots presented an increase in transcript
levels of MtAGO7 under water deficit with a very high
variation in severe water deficit in the roots (Figure 4
andAdditional file 8).
In Arabidopsis DCL2 cleaves double-stranded virus
RNA producing 22nt small RNAs [56]. A small but significant variation was found for the accumulation of
MtDCL2 transcripts in shoots under MWD condition. In
the roots no significant variation was found along the
water deficit treatments and recovery (Figure 4).
The function of AtAGO2 is not clear but has a distinct
characteristic from other AGOs, it is highly specific for
small RNAs with a 5’ terminal adenosine [26]. Under
water deficit MtAGO2a transcripts levels increased while
MtAGO2b remained almost stable in both shoots and
roots (Figure 4).
Expression of miR162 and miR168a/b and their targets
during water deficit

DCL1 and AGO1 are two enzymes that have very important roles in miRNA maturation and functionality. In M.
truncatula their mRNAs are targeted by miR162 and
miR168 respectively [2,3]. In M. truncatula miR162 and
miR168 are expressed in different plant organs (Additional
file 9). For miR162, two bands were visible (Figure 5
andAdditional file 9): one band of 21-nt that correspond
to the miR162 size [2,3] while the other low intensity band
is of 24-nt. For miR168, again two bands are visible, one of
21-nt that corresponds to the miRNA [2,3] and a faint
band of 24-nt. The probable reason for the extra bands is
that DCL3 competes with DCL1 for the same miRNA precursors to produce small RNAs molecules with 24-nt [60].
The expression of both miR168 and miR162 did not
seem to change in the shoots of plants subjected to
water deficit and in the recovered plants when compared with the controls (Figure 5). On the other hand
both miRNAs decrease their accumulation in roots subjected to water deficit and their expression did not
returned to the control levels when plants were rewatered. It seems that only in the roots and especially
for the MtDCL1 a post transcriptional control mediated
by miRNAs is taking place (Figure 4 and 5).

Discussion
In the present work we have identified 3 putative DCL and
12 putative AGO genes in the genome of M. truncatula

Page 9 of 14

from which only the transcript levels of MtAGO11 could
not be detected. Thus far the identification and characterization of these important gene families was mostly limited
to A. thaliana and O. sativa.
The catalytic center of MtAGOs

The slicing activity has been demonstrated for A. thaliana AGO1, AGO2, AGO4 and AGO7 [19,22,61,62] and
almost all of them have a catalytic center carrying a DDH
motif also found in animal AGOs [24]. The exception is
AtAGO2, which has a DDD motif (Figure 1, C) [19]. In
Homo sapiens the AGO3 protein has a DDH motif but
without a slicing activity [59,63]. On the other hand, the
Drosophila melanogaster PIWI domain has one DDK
motif and has catalytic activity [64]. In conclusion, the
existence or absence of a DDH motif does not necessarily
imply a slicing activity. Baumberger and Baulcombe [19]
showed that the histidine residue in position 800 is essential for the slicing activity of AtAGO1. However AtAGO4
has a serine residue instead of a histidine in position 800
but still has slicing activity. Therefore the existence of
this residue in Argonautes may not be an obligatory
determinant for their cleavage activity. The DDH/H or
DDD/H motifs are present in MtAGO1, MtAGO2a and
MtAGO7 (Figure 1, C) and are homologous to AtAGO1,
AtAGO2 and AtAGO7, indicating that they probably
have slicing activity in M. truncatula. It is also possible
that MtAGO4s, MtAGO6, MtAGO11, MtAGO12a and
MtAGO12 presenting a DDH/(A/S/P) motif and
MtAGO11 and MtAGO2b presenting a DDD/S motif
may have as well a slicing activity.
MtDCL1

MtDCL1 mRNA levels increased in M. truncatula under
water deficit (Figure 4), which may imply the increase of
mature miRNAs. DCL1 is subjected to negative feedback
regulation by miR162 [27]. In our case, miR162 is less
accumulated in the roots under water deficit, having the
lowest accumulation in SWD (Figure 5). The correlation
of this with the increase of MtDCL1 transcript levels,
most notorious in roots under water deficit (Figure 4),
probably indicates that the regulation of MtDCL1 by
miR162 is relaxed in response to water deprivation,
increasing the possibility of a higher DCL1 activity in
plants subjected to this stress condition. Since DCL1 is
involved in synthesis of miRNAs, this suggests that these
sRNAs may play an important role in plant responses or
adaptation to water deficit.
MtAGO1

AGO1 is the main protein mediating miRNA posttranscriptional directed regulation and ago1 mutants show
several developmental defects [28]. The AGO1 homeostasis
is maintained by the post-transcriptional regulation of

Figure 5 miR162 and miR168 expression in shoots and roots of M. truncatula in different water status. The U6 small nuclear RNA was
used as internal loading control. The accumulation of miR162 and miR168 (numbers indicated under each lane) was quantified according to U6
small nuclear RNA loading control and normalized to control conditions. The membrane was first hybridized with miR162 probe and then
striped and rehybridized with miR168 probe. (M) miRNA size marker with three bands of 24, 21 and 17 nt (New England Biolabs) is shown in the

AGO1 by miR168 and the stabilization of miR168 levels by
AGO1 [65]. Another way of regulating AGO1 is through
AGO1-derived short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However,
for this type of regulation to happen it is required that
these siRNAs were produced by DCL2 and DCL4 [66].
Three enzymes, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR6),
Suppressor of gene silencing 3 (SGS3) and Silencing Defective 5 (SDE5) are involved in double strand RNA (dsRNA)
production from the cleaved mRNA of AGO1. In addition
Mallory et al. [67] demonstrated that AGO10 is a negative
regulator of AGO1 levels and Brodersen et al [20] showed
that AGO10 together with AGO1 mediate the translational
repression of miRNAs targets in a miRNA-dependent
manner.
In our case we observe that the transcript levels of
MtAGO1 increased in M. truncatula under water deficit
(Figure 4). However we could not correlate this with the
variation of miR168 accumulation (Figure 5). Vaucheret
et al. [28] verified that the over-accumulation of AGO1
causes developmental defects in Arabidopsis which
means that the homeostasis of AGO1 is important to stabilize the functioning of the miRNA pathway. More evidence is needed to understand the MtAGO1 transcript
increase in water deprived M. truncatula plants although
this indicates an implement of the activity of miRNAs.
MtAGO12a, MtAGO12b and MtAGO12c

MtAGO12a, MtAGO12b and MtAGO12c are similar to
AtAGO10 as shown by BLASTn and BLASTp (Table 1)
and have the highest homology with AtAGO10 (Figure 1,

A). In A. thaliana, AGO10 promote the translation repression of some miRNAs targets [20]. Giving these homologies
MtAGO12 enzymes probably share the same functionalities
with AtAGO10. In M. truncatula shoots MtAGO12b and
MtAGO12c transcript levels decreased in response to water
deficit, suggesting that the mechanism of translation repression mediated by MtAGO12s is probably being shut down.
In the roots these genes are differentially expressed, suggesting that they could have the same function but have
evolved to respond differentially to water deficit, in a similar
way to what was observed with the rice OsAGO1a-d under
different stress conditions [18].
MtAGO7

Argonaute 7 specifically associates with miR390 and
directs the cleavage at the 3’ end of its non-coding target
TAS3 RNA [22,68]. The TAS3 cleavage products are stabilized by Suppressor of Gene Silencing 3 (SGS3), and
one of the two TAS3 cleavage products is converted to
dsRNA by RNA dependent RNA Polymerase 6 (RDR6).
Finally this dsRNA is diced by DCL4 into 21-nt trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) a process assisted by a dsRNA
binding protein 4 (DRB4). The bioinformatic search for
DCLs in M. truncatula, could not find a homolog
sequence to A. thaliana DCL4, possibly because the M.
truncatula genome is not yet fully sequenced. Nevertheless, three annotated genes homologous to the Auxin
Response Factor 3 (ARF3) of A. thaliana were identified
in the M. truncatula genome by Jagadeeswaran et al. [3]
as targets of two TAS3-derived ta-siRNAs.

Capitão et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:79
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/79

A. thaliana AGO7 mutants accelerate the juvenile to
adult transition but not the onset of reproductive competence or flowering time [69]. ARF3 over-expression
resulted in further acceleration of phase change and
severe morphological and patterning defects of leaves
and floral organs [70]. In our study we observed that
MtAGO7 mRNA levels increased under water deficit in
both shoots and roots (Figure 4). Several previous works
correlated the role of TAS3 derived ta-siRNAs with
plant development processes, but our results indirectly
suggest that ARF3 can have a role in plant reaction to
water deficit, maybe by repressing the development processes in the plants that are under stress conditions.
This correlates with the observed reduction in growth
and development of M. truncatula plants subjected to
water deprivation when compared with the controls.
The expression levels of the TAS3, the three ARF3
genes and TAS3 derived ta-siRNAs from M truncatula
should be analyzed under water deficit to test this
hypothesis.
Water deficit response in M. truncatula and chromatin
rearrangements

In plants, chromatin gene silencing involves the coordinated action of: (1) a DNA dependent RNA polymerase IV
(Pol IVa and Pol IVb) that transcribes genomic regions
with transposons and highly repeated sequences [71,72];
(2) a RNA dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2), that
produces a dsRNA sequence from the regions transcribed
by RNA Pol IV [73]; (3) a Dicer-like 3 (DCL3), that cleaves
the dsRNA in 24-nt sRNAs [10,61,73]; (4) the Argonaute 4
and 6, that are important for the accumulation of specific
heterochromatin-related siRNAs, and for DNA methylation and subsequent transcriptional gene silencing [73-75].
We showed that the M. truncatula MtDCL3, MtAGO4b and MtAGO4c transcript levels increased under
water deficit situations (Figure 4). However MtAGO4a
had no clear response to water deprivation while
MtAGO6 mRNA levels decreased. These results might
suggest that the chromatin rearrangements may have a
role in the plant responses to water deficit. A possible
explanation for the differences in the transcript abundance patterns of the MtAGO4s (Figure 4) is that MtAGO4b and MtAGO4c are phylogenetically more related
to each other than with MtAGO4a (Figure 1).
Havecker et al. [21] verified that in Arabidopsis AGO6
is only expressed in the shoot and root growing tips and
AGO4 is expressed predominantly in leaves of adult
plants and in all flower and embryo developmental
stages. Both Argonautes bind to 5’ adenosine 24-nt small
RNAs meaning that these characteristics do not distinguish their functional diversification. The functional
divergence between AGO4 and AGO6 is related with
their expression in different tissues and the epigenetic

Page 11 of 14

modifications are influenced by interactions between the
AGO protein and the different target loci [21]. We identified 3 genes as AGO4 and one as AGO6 in M. truncatula (Figure 1). These genes are possibly expressed in
different tissues and have different degrees of interaction
for the same loci as well. The increased MtDCL3, MtAGO4b and MtAGO4c mRNA levels under water deficit
are very similar in both shoots and roots (Figure 4). Thus
it is possible that the spatial production of small RNAs
by MtDCL3 coincides with the spatial expression of
MtAGO4b and MtAGO4c since they are related with the
same mechanism of silencing.

Conclusion
We identified and characterized three DCLs and twelve
AGOs genes in the genome of M. truncatula. These
genes probably encode enzymes that integrate different
sRNA pathways and their transcript levels are modulated
in response to water deficit. This modulation is more evident in roots. The processing and activation of miRNAs
are up regulated as well as the sRNAs mediated DNA
methylation mechanisms and the production of transacting small interfering RNAs. Our observations opened
an opportunity to study the impact of sRNA metabolism
in the response of legumes toward water deficit.
