Abstract
Since its discovery in 1998, representatives of the extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber
have been found in many hypersaline environments across the world, including coastal and solar
salterns and solar lakes. Here, we review the available information about the distribution,
abundance and diversity of this member of the Bacteroidetes.

Introduction
During the summer of 1998, in the course of a study
focused on the identification by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) of the then uncultured square
archaeon, high proportions of Bacteria were detected by
FISH in crystallizer ponds from solar salterns [1].
Although bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences had been
previously detected in these environments [2,3], that was
the first report on high abundance of potentially active
Bacteria, for which the candidatus name of "Salinibacter"
was proposed. Shortly after, some of these Bacteria could
be grown in pure culture and were characterized taxonomically [4,5]. The candidatus species was finally classified as
a new genus and species, and named as Salinibacter ruber
gen. nov. sp. nov. In these last few years a considerable
advance in the knowledge of these microorganisms has
been achieved [6-8] and even its genome has been completely sequenced and annotated [9].

According to phylogenetic reconstructions based on the
16S rRNA gene [5] and on the inter-spacer region between
the 16S and 23S rRNA genes [10] S. ruber can be affiliated
with the phylum Bacteroidetes, being its closest related cultured organism Rhodothermus marinus, a thermophilic,
slightly halophilic marine bacterium. The clade comprising R. marinus and S. ruber appeared as a deep branch
within the phylum, placed close to the node of bifurcation
of the superphylum that comprises Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi [11]. The phylogenetic position of S. ruber was further
studied analyzing a total of 22 genes from the genome of
S. ruber strain M31 [12]. All these genes had essential
functions for the organism, were dispersed within the
genome, and rendered a final alignment informative
enough for phylogenetic reconstructions. Although single
genes supported different topologies, the tree topology of
concatenated genes was identical to that previously
observed based on small subunit 16S rRNA gene analysis

genealogical reconstruction.

proportion of acidic amino acids, which yields an acidic
proteome with a median isoelectric point of 5.2 [9]

This bacterium turned out to be extremely interesting for
its surprisingly high similarity with haloarchaea: both
types of microorganisms share the same habitat, are
extremely halophilic, aerobic and heterotrophs, pigmented, maintain high intracellular potassium concentrations, have very high GC proportion in their genomes
(with the exception of Haloquadratum walsbyi), and retinal
proton pumps in their membranes. Indeed, one of the
most striking features of S. ruber is the presence in its
membrane of xanthorhodopsin [13], a retinal proton
pump with a light-harvesting carotenoid antenna, that
represents "the simplest electrogenic pump with an accessory antenna pigment".

Here we will focus on what we have learned during these
almost ten years about the distribution, abundance and
diversity of Salinibacter spp. For a more comprehensive
review on other aspects of the biology of this bacterium,
the reader is referred to the corresponding chapters in The
Prokaryotes and the Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [17,6].

Both Salinibacter and most of extremely halophilic
Archaea inhabit hypersaline environments, i.e. environments with salt concentrations above that of seawater,
very often close to saturation. These environments are
among the most extreme on Earth since their microbiota
is normally exposed to more than one stress: high salt,
high radiation, some times high pressure or high pH. In
particular, we have focused our studies on an artificial
hypersaline environment: the solar salterns. They consist
of a series of shallow ponds connected in a sequence of
increasingly saline brines that are used for the commercial
production of salt from seawater. During evaporation of
sea water, sequential precipitation of calcium carbonate
and calcium sulphate occurs, leaving a hypersaline
sodium chloride brine that precipitates in ponds known
as crystallizers (salinity above 30%). Although there are
some other microorganisms present in low numbers, the
prokaryotic community in crystallizers is dominated by
dense populations of halophilic square Archaea (Haloquadratum walsbyi) and a lower proportion, from 5 to
30%, of extremely halophilic members of the Bacteria
such as S. ruber [4,14] or, in some instances such as in
Maras salterns (see below), Salicola spp. [15]. Inside the
Eukaryotic domain, the green alga Dunaliella acts as the primary producer. In addition, hypersaline environments
show one of the highest number of virus-like particles
(VLP) reported for planktonic systems [16].
The fact that S. ruber shares its habitat with extremely
halophilic Archaea together with the many "haloarchaeallike" characteristics of this bacterium indicated that it
could have experienced lateral gene transfer (LTG) from/
to Archaea. The analysis of S. ruber M31 genome suggested
that this was indeed the case, although the amount of
genes likely involved in LGT events was more modest than
expected [9]. In any case, S. ruber proteins, although not
necessarily related to their archaeal homologues, are
adapted to function at high salt and therefore have a high

Abundance and distribution
Salinibacter representatives have been detected in the environment using different techniques, with different levels
of sensitivity that can yield contradictory results even
when applied to the same sample (some examples are
given below). Therefore, one must be aware of their characteristics in order to compare results obtained using different techniques. Our group has used basically three
methods for the detection of S. ruber and relatives in natural samples: FISH, 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and
DGGE analysis, and culture. Among these three, fluorescence in situ hybridization, FISH, is the only method for
direct quantification in natural samples as it permits the
identification of single cells by means of the use of phylogenetic probes. However it has some well known limitations like problems with cell permeation, relatively high
thresholds of ribosome content, accessibility to the secondary structure, etc. [18]. One of the major constraints of
the technique is the database comprehensiveness, i.e.
when new sequences belonging to a given group are discovered, probes should be re-evaluated and redesigned so
they target the whole group (see below the example of
Salinibacter sequences in Tuz Lake).
Second, a microorganism can be detected in environmental samples by analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences PCR
amplified from environmental nucleic acids, either by
clone library construction or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE is normally used for community fingerprinting as it allows the separation of different
sequences of the same size on the same denaturing gel.
Since they include a PCR step in which 16S rRNA genes
are amplified using "specific" primers (not always so specific) and environmental DNA as template, both techniques do not provide quantitative data but, obviously,
allow for the detection of sequences related to that of S.
ruber. In the case of DGGE, there is an extra limitation
since the sequences retrieved are partial and therefore
almost two thirds of the phylogenetic information is missing.
Finally, the culture approach provides a source of detection and quantification despite it has important limitations derived from the different degree of culturability of

the natural microbial populations. In any case, it provides
important and accessible information on the isolates.
In addition, Salinibacter spp. have been also monitorized
by means of other techniques like sulfonolipid detection
[19], pigment composition analyses [20], total melting
profiles, and reassociation techniques [21], among others.
Using all these methods, S. ruber or closely related bacteria
has been detected all over the world (Figure 1). In Europe,
for instance, Salinibacter representatives have been found
in crystallizer pond salterns in mainland Spain (Alicante
and Tarragona), Balearic (Mallorca and Ibiza) and Canary
Islands. In all cases, the bacterium was detected both by
culture and molecular methods, including FISH, DGGE
and 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis. Additionally,
the analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry of lipid
extracts allowed the detection of S. ruber sulfonolipid signature peak at m/z 660 in a crystallizer pond in the Margherita di Savoia salterns in Italy [19].

In Asia, Salinibacter close relatives have been found in Turkey and Israel. When analyzing the bacterial community
inhabiting the hypersaline Tuz Lake in central Anatolia,
Turkey [22], sequences related to Salinibacter dominated
bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and DGGE profiles although FISH counts gave very low numbers. A close
look at the new 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that
many of them, although clustering with Salinibacter phylotypes (see below and Fig. 2), lacked the signature
sequences targeted by the FISH probes. This is an example
of how dependent FISH results are on the specificity of the
probes. Therefore, caution must be exerted when analyzing by FISH a microbial community since, strictly speaking, probes should be always rechecked against 16S rRNA
gene sequences retrieved from the samples being analyzed. In Israel, although S. ruber could not be detected by
culture-independent methods in water samples from Eilat
salterns, it could be readily isolated [23].

In Africa, sequences related to S. ruber have also been
retrieved from water and sediments from three different
soda lakes in the Wadi An Natrum depression in Egypt
[24]. We also detected S. ruber by FISH in a water sample
taken from a shabka in Suez (Fig. 1).
In the Andean Maras salterns, in Peru, S. ruber could be
easily isolated in culture from brine samples taken in different years although it could not be detected either by
FISH or by analyzing 107 bacterial 16S rRNA gene clones
[15]. In fact, the bacterial community there was dominated by members of the class Proteobacteria, and specially
representatives of the recently classified Salicola marasensis
[15]. Finally, during the last Halophiles meeting, the presence of S. ruber-related sequences has also been reported
for other locations in America, such as the Great Salt Lake
in Utah (oral presentation by C. D. Litchfield), in the atalassohaline Andean Lake Tebenquiche in Northern Chile
(oral presentation by C. Pedrós-Alió), and Guerrero Negro

(oral presentation by S. Sabet) salterns in Baja California,
Mexico.
Both clones and isolates very closely related to S. ruber
have been recently found in crystallizer ponds from three
different salterns in Australia (Dickson Oh and Mike
Dyall-Smith, personal communication): one at Dry
Creek, South Australia; another in Lara, Victoria, and a
third in Bajool, Queensland (Fig. 1). Most interestingly,
some of these isolates correspond to the so-far uncultured
(see below) cluster EHB-2.
Apart from sequences clustering with S. ruber phylotypes
EHB-1 and EHB-2 (from Extremely Halophilic Bacteria 1
and 2 [4], Figure 3), Bacteroidetes sequences more distantly
related to S. ruber, were very abundant in 16S rRNA gene
libraries constructed with DNA extracted from the different layers of an endoevaporite (crystallized gypsum-halite
matrix in near-saturated salt water) from saltworks in

Guerrero Negro, Mexico [25]. In addition, partial 16S
rRNA gene sequences with similarities of less than 92% to
Salinibacter have been retrieved from biofilms colonizing
Mayan monuments in Uxmal (Mexico) [26]. Also, similar
gene sequences were found in clone libraries obtained
from a hypersaline endoevaporite microbial mat from a
pond of 20% salinity in Eilat salterns in Israel [27]. These
sequences were most abundant in the green layer of the
mat. Finally, 16S rRNA gene sequences that could represent distinct novel lineages within the radiation of the
genus Salinibacter have been recovered from evaporite
crusts in brine pools at the Badwater site in Death Valley
National Park, California [28]. Bacteria with similarities
between 93 and 94% with S. ruber 16S rRNA gene have
been isolated from these samples [28].
As illustrated by all these examples, S. ruber and relatives
have been detected by different methods in a wide variety

of environments. In some case, the bacterium is abundant, as directly demonstrated by FISH or other methods,
or has been retrieved only by cultivation. The relevance of
the finding of Salinibacter in a given environment depends
on the technique used for its detection: it is possible, as
with the example of Maras salterns, that the bacterium is
a very minoritary component of the community or, as
seen in Mallorca salterns, is a very abundant component,
easily detectable. Thus, depending on the analyzed environment, Salinibacter spp. can be either one of the most
abundant, and most likely ecologically relevant organisms, or be part of what has been called "the seed bank"
[29]. According to Pedrós-Alió [29], most abundant taxa
in a given environment would be the "core" species that
would be maintained through active growth and fuel carbon and energy flows. This group would be accessible
through molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA gene
clone library analysis. In addition, there would be a

Saline Systems 2008, 4:15

diverse assemblage of rare taxa, or "seed bank", that "will
seldom be retrieved" by this molecular approach but
could occasionally be recovered by cultivation. In our
examples of Mallorca and Maras samples, S. ruber would
be core and seed bank, respectively. One thus may
hypothesize that in a given environment S. ruber could
also change its status as it becomes more or less abundant.
However, the preliminary data we have obtained so far
with crystallizer ponds from solar salterns indicate that
although the bacterium experiences changes in numbers
along the year, those are not very dramatic, at least under
"normal" environmental conditions (unpublished
results).
The abundance of Salinibacter spp. has been thoroughly
measured only in a few hypersaline environments and
therefore, we do not have a clear picture of how abundant
this bacterium is at a global scale. In the places analyzed,
Salinibacter spp. ranges form 2 to 30% (see Figure 1)
although in some cases, like Tuz Lake, this value is clearly
an underestimation since the FISH probes used did not
target the whole assemblage of Salinibacter sequences. In
Santa Pola salterns, Salinibacter spp. was detected only in
ponds with salinities above 22.4%. In fact, the numbers
detected by FISH increased with salinity (from 3.5 to 12%
in three ponds of 25, 31.6 and 37% total salts) [4]. However, direct proof of the activity of Salinibacter spp. in the
highest salinity (37% total salts) ponds has not been
obtained so far. In fact, Gasol et al. [30] found evidences
that above 32% salinity all the prokaryotic activity was
carried out by haloarchaea in the same ponds where S.
ruber accounted for up to 18% of the DAPI counts. This
observation was based on the assumption that Salinibacter
was not inhibited by taurocholate, which is a potent
haloarchaeal inhibitor. In a recent work [7], Elevi Bardavid and Oren have shown that taurocholate does not
inhibit aminoacid synthesis by Salinibacter. Therefore, the
function of Salinbacter in most saturated crystallizers
remains unkown.

Diversity at 16S rRNA gene level
The first step taken after the detection by FISH, ten years
ago, of abundant members of the Bacteria domain in a
crystallizer pond, was the analysis by DGGE of the bacterial community in the systems. Two bands were obtained,
corresponding to two partial bacterial 16S rRNA gene
sequences, named as EHB-1 and EHB-2. The analysis of a
16S rRNA gene library from the same sample allowed the
retrieval of the complete EHB-1 and 2 sequences, that
shared an identity of 97.6%. FISH quantification with specific probes indicated that EHB-1 was the dominant bacterial phylotype in Santa Pola Salterns (about 5 times
more abundant than EHB-2 detected cells). Shortly after,
isolates related to these sequences were retrieved from
crystallizers in Mallorca and Santa Pola. All theses isolates,

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/15

a total of 5, and the rest (around 200) that we have
obtained since then from these and other salterns in
mainland and inland Spain, clustered with EHB-1 (Figure
2). When more S. ruber isolates were obtained from salterns in Israel, Peru, and Turkey, all of them belonged also
to EHB-1. Only very recently, Dickson Oh and Mike
Dyall-Smith have been able to retrieve a member of the
EHB-2 group, most likely a new species of the genus
Salinibacter, in pure culture (personal communication).
Since the discovery of Salinibacter, many other sequences
affiliating with the phylum Bacteroidetes have been
retrieved from hypersaline environments around the
world including, for instance, athalassohaline environments such as the Lake Chaka (32.5% salinity) in Northwestern China [31], and lakes from Los Andes with a wide
range of salt concentrations and compositions [32]. The
obvious question to ask is whether these sequences form
a monophyletic group; in other words, whether there is a
group of extremely halophilic Bacteroidetes that have
evolved from a common ancestor or the sequences
retrieved from hypersaline environments are scattered
across this phylum. To address this question, we constructed [22] a tree with complete sequences of Bacteroidetes
retrieved from hypersaline and other
environments, including cultured and non-cultured
microorganisms (Figure 3). Indeed, there is a big group of
sequences, which includes Salinibacter, that all come from
high salt places (labelled with H in the figure), although
there are also "high salt sequences" scattered across the
tree. However, there is a group that includes Salinibacter
and is formed only by sequences retrieved from hypersaline environments such as endoevaporitic salt crust from
New Mexico, water samples from lakes in Salar de Atacama (Chile) or an endoevaporitic microbial mat from
Eilat (Israel). This group may represent additional genera,
different from Salinibacter.

Comparison of S. ruber strains isolated from
different locations: clues for biogeography
As previously shown for extremophiles such as the
archaeon Sulfolobus [33] and thermophilic Cyanobacteria
[34], the extreme conditions and geographical isolation of
the environments from which we have isolated S. ruber are
an optimal scenario for observing allopatric speciation
processes in prokaryotes. However, our initial studies
based on genomic fingerprinting by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA
analyses, although indicating a certain trend, did not provide clear evidence of geographical discrimination for S.
ruber. [10]. In addition, and contrary to what was
observed with fluorescent pseudomonads [35], internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were not suitable for
ascertaining biogeographical similarity since all these
strains had identical or very similar ITSs. In order to com-

pare the geographical genetic discrimination of extremophiles evidenced by Whitaker et al. [33], we studied a
subset of 10 strains using multilocus sequencing analysis
(MLSA). For these, 8 housekeeping genes phylogenetically
informative were PCR amplified and sequenced. In contrast to what was observed for thermophilic Archaea, this
analysis did not show a clear geographical segregation of
the analyzed strains [36]. Obviously, this finding is not
meaning that there are no genetic differences between the
strains just that, in our case, MLSA cannot be correlated
with their geographical origins.
As an alternative to the genetic studies, we recently [36]
undertook a metabolomic study focused to understanding of the metabolic similarities occurring among isolates
of the same location. We studied a collection of 28 S. ruber
strains isolated from 7 different locations in the world
(Mallorca, Alicante, Tarragona, Ibiza, Israel, Canary
Islands and Peru). These locations corresponded to three
main geographical areas (Mediterranean: 10 strains,
Atlantic: 13 strains, and Peruvian: 5 strains).
The 28 strains were then analyzed using ion cyclotron resonance Fourier transform mass spectrometry (12T ICRFT/MS), a mass spectrometry method that currently provides the highest available molecular resolution. All
strains were grown at the same time under the same conditions and extracts from their supernatants and the cellular soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed. The
common peaks for all extracts (i.e. the core metabolome)
consisted of 2550 single m/z compounds while there were
6323 peaks not common to all extracts (or discriminative
metabolites). The analysis of presence or absence of individual metabolites did not alone reveal clear geographical
trends. However, when the relative intensity of every individual peak (the concentration of every metabolite) was
introduced in the considered data, a multivariate analysis
revealed "statistically significant differences between the
different samples" ([36], Figure 4). Samples from different
origins had thus different levels of expression of certain
metabolites, and these differences could be correlated
with the origin of isolation of the strains. The metabolites
responsible for the geographic differentiation could be
putatively identified as having aliphatic structures
depleted in oxygen, such as fatty acids and terpenoids,
that are generally associated with cell membranes.
We could also identify the presence of typical sulfonolipids previously described for S. ruber strain M31 [19]. Our
analysis showed that besides the M31 sulfonolipid, S.
ruber may contain at least 9 additional sulfonolipids, with
variations in their elementary composition, saturation
and side chain structure (Figure 5). In addition, some sulfonolipids specific for Atlantic strains were also found.

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/15

All these results indicated that there is a metabolic diversity among S. ruber strains that can be correlated with geographical patterns. Indeed, the three groups of strains
analyzed came from three clearly different ecosystems.
Although all the strains had been isolated from crystallizer
ponds, the strains from Maras salterns (the Peruvian
group) came from an inland saltern located at more than
3000 meter above sea level, in which the prokaryotes were
around one or order of magnitud less abundant than in
coastal crystallizer ponds, most likely due the lower concentration of nutrients (these salterns are fed by saline
spring water) and the low environmental temperatures. S.
ruber were very minority members of the microbial community of these salterns, as explained above, and showed
very low genomic diversity [37]. On the other side, Mediterranean strains came all from coastal crystallizer ponds
exposed to rather high temperatures in the summer, in
which prokaryotic numbers were above 107 cells/ml, with
high nutrient concentration (the salterns are fed with
coastal sea water, that is concentrated more than 10 fold
in the crystallizers), in which the S. ruber assemblage is
abundant and diverse [37]. Atlantic strains were all isolated from solar salterns in the Canary island, that would
correspond to intermediate conditions between Peruvian
and Mediterranean strains. It is not surprising that strains
that have to cope with so different environmental conditions display different metabolomes. Indeed, comparison
of the metabolomes indicated that the largest differences
were found between Peruvian and Mediterranean strains
[36].

Future research
Now that we know that the genus Salinibacter is widespread, diverse and abundant, we can address more questions relevant to its ecology and activities in the
environment. For instance, why is Salinibacter so often
present in hypersaline environments although is always
outnumbered by Archaea? How do they interact? Do they
compete for nutrients or kill each other with halocin-like
molecules? Under which circumstances, if any, could
Salinibacter outgrow haloarchaea? What is the role of
phages in maintaining the equilibrium between extremely
halophiles of both Domains. What is the diversity of
Salinibacter beyond 16S rRNA? Do different S. ruber types
compete among them? Most of these questions are at this
moment unanswered although we are starting to get
insight into some of them. We know, for instance, that the
response of Salinibacter and haloarchaea to environmental stresses such as high radiation, is different (Santos et
al., unpublished results). We have also found that certain
haloarchaea can inhibit Salinibacter growth (Nercessian et
al., unpublished; Elevi-Bardavid and Oren, Halophiles
2007 meeting) and that different strains of S. ruber can
show antagonistic effects (Peña et al., unpublished). In
addition, the diversity of S. ruber seems to be much higher

than 16S rRNA analysis indicated: for instance, we isolated 45 new strains (López-Pascual et al., upublished
results) from the very same crystallizer where the type
strain was isolated 9 years before; despite the fact that all
these strains had identical 16S rRNA genes, they displayed

22 different PFGE patterns, none of them corresponding
with that of the type strain.
In future, we will focus our research in these aspects and
follow looking for Salinibacter spp. and other new
extremely halophilic microorganisms in hypersaline envi-
