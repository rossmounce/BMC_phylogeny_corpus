Abstract
Background: Adaptive radiation within fishes of the Coregonus lavaretus complex has created numerous morphs,
posing significant challenges for taxonomy and conservation priorities. The highly endangered North Sea houting
(C. oxyrhynchus; abbreviated NSH) has been considered a separate species from European lake whitefish (C.
lavaretus; abbreviated ELW) due to morphological divergence and adaptation to oceanic salinities. However, its
evolutionary and taxonomic status is controversial. We analysed microsatellite DNA polymorphism in nine
populations from the Jutland Peninsula and the Baltic Sea, representing NSH (three populations, two of which are
reintroduced) and ELW (six populations). The objectives were to: 1) analyse postglacial recolonization of
whitefish in the region; 2) assess the evolutionary distinctiveness of NSH, and 3) apply several approaches for
defining conservation units towards setting conservation priorities for NSH.
Results: Bayesian cluster analyses of genetic differentiation identified four major groups, corresponding to NSH
and three groups of ELW (Western Jutland, Central Jutland, Baltic Sea). Estimates of historical migration rates
indicated recolonization in a north-eastern direction, suggesting that all except the Baltic Sea population
predominantly represent postglacial recolonization via the ancient Elbe River. Contemporary gene flow has not
occurred between NSH and ELW, with a divergence time within the last 4,000 years suggested from coalescence
methods. NSH showed interbreeding with ELW when brought into contact by stocking. Thus, reproductive
isolation of NSH was not absolute, although possible interbreeding beyond the F1 level could not be resolved.
Conclusion: Fishes of the C. lavaretus complex in the Jutland Peninsula originate from the same recolonization
event. NSH has evolved recently and its species status may be questioned due to incomplete reproductive
isolation from ELW, but it was shown to merit consideration as an independent conservation unit. Yet, application
of several approaches for defining conservation units generated mixed outcomes regarding its conservation
priority. Within the total species complex, it remains one among many recently evolved unique forms. Its
uniqueness and high conservation priority is more evident at a local geographical scale, where conservation efforts
will also benefit populations of a number of other endangered species.

Background
Pleistocene glaciations and subsequent postglacial recolonisation events have profoundly affected biota within the
Northern Hemisphere in terms of the distribution of
genetic diversity and phylogeographical lineages [1-3].
Evolution did not, however, cease after the last glaciation.
Thus, in several cases it has been difficult to disentangle
population differentiation that can be ascribed to postglacial processes, i.e. within the past ca. 10,000 years, versus
longer term evolution pre-dating the last glaciation [4-6].
This problem is particularly evident in freshwater fishes
such as whitefish (Coregonus spp.) and threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), both of which show extensive phenotypic variability and comprise sympatrically
and allopatrically divergent morphs [7-9]. Polymorphisms involving both benthic and limnetic forms and
differences in lateral plate number have been extensively
studied in sticklebacks, and it has been found that similar
morphs have evolved repeatedly and independently, primarily representing postglacial divergence [10-12]. In
Coregonus, "dwarf" vs. "normal" sized morphs and
morphs with high vs. low gill raker number have attracted
considerable interest, and the situation appears highly
complex. In North America dwarf-normal forms and
high-low gill raker forms in lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis) have in some cases been found to represent different phylogeographical lineages and in other cases
postglacial divergence [9,13]. Moreover, for dwarf-normal
systems parallel evolution has been suggested to involve
the same loci [14,15]. In the closely related European lake
whitefish (C. lavaretus), most gill raker morphs appear to
represent postglacial divergence [16,17] and there are
striking examples of other phenotypic forms that have
evolved within the past few thousand years [8,18].
Cases like these pose significant challenges in the context
of setting conservation priorities. Are similar phenotypes
mono- or polyphyletic in origin? How much of the phenotypic diversity represents long-term evolutionary processes (e.g. different phylogeographical lineages) and how
much represents more recent (e.g. postglacial) evolution?
How should the outcomes of recent versus longer-term
evolution be weighted in conservation priorities? Important components of these questions involve the estimation of long- and short-term adaptive divergence and
reproductive isolation [19-22].
The North Sea and Jutland peninsula region (Fig. 1) are
interesting both in terms of geology and freshwater fish
biogeography. Immediately after the last glaciation, ca.
13,000 years bp, the current North Sea, the Jutland Peninsula and the continent to the south was one coherent land
mass. The postglacial Elbe River extended through this
region and had its outlet in the current Skagerrak Sea,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/137

which was at that time a trough separating Norway and
Sweden from Jutland. West flowing rivers in the Jutland
Peninsula were tributaries to the postglacial Elbe River
thus constituting one large river system. As glaciers
melted, the sea level started to rise, and eventually the
melting of the gigantic ice masses of the North American
Wisconsinan glaciers from ca. 10,000 - 8,000 years bp led
to the formation of the current North Sea, isolating the
rivers of Western Jutland from the Elbe River system.
Today, a number of freshwater fish species including grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and dace (Leuciscus leuciscus) are
found only in rivers draining to the North Sea, presumably reflecting recolonization via the postglacial Elbe River
system and absence of immigration via the Baltic Sea [23].
European lake whitefish (in the following denoted the
Coregonus lavaretus complex, as this group of fishes
involves several taxonomic controversies) shows a similar
distribution pattern, although it spread further via ancient
waterway connections into the Limfjord in northern Jutland and further to a few rivers, including the Gudenaa
River on the Jutland East coast [24] (see Fig. 1).
The North Sea houting (hereafter denoted NSH), categorised by traditional taxonomy as C. oxyrhynchus, is a morphologically and ecologically divergent form of whitefish.
Its most prominent feature is an elongated snout, which
on average constitutes 6.2% of the total fork length (snout
length is measured from the eye cavity to the tip of the
snout). Conversely, in lake whitefish (hereafter denoted
ELW) from the same geographical region the relative
snout length is 4.6%, and the differences are statistically
significant (Hvidt CB, Christensen IG: Træk af Nordsøsnæblens (Coregonus oxyrhynchus L.) biologi i Vidå-systemet.
Aarhus, Denmark: Institute of Biology, University of
Aarhus; 1990. M.Sc. Thesis). The feature of an elongated
snout is nevertheless not unique to NSH, and has also
been described in other populations [25]. However, what
makes NSH stand out within the C. lavaretus complex is its
ability to tolerate oceanic salinities [26]. Anadromy is not
uncommon within this complex, involving migration
into brackish environments such as fjords and the Baltic
Sea with salinities ranging from near zero to approx. 15
‰. In contrast, NSH undertakes feeding migrations into
the North Sea, where salinity is approx. 35 ‰ [26].
NSH was previously distributed throughout the Wadden
Sea area, a coastal zone of the North Sea extending from
southern Jutland to the Netherlands characterized by
huge tidal flats, where it spawned in tributary rivers,
including major rivers like the Rhine and the Elbe. At
present, all but one extant and indigenous population of
NSH remains in the Danish Vidaa River, due to extensive
pollution and habitat degradation. However, its species
and conservation status is controversial. Based on microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA analysis Hansen et al.

into the Limfjord, but later it changed outlet towards the Kattegat Sea [24]. Arrows indicate the direction of immigration.
[24] found NSH to be closely related to other Danish ELW
populations, but did not rule out that it represented a
recent speciation event. Similarly, Østbye et al. [17] analysed mitochondrial DNA variation in populations of the
C. lavaretus complex encompassing most of its distributional range in Europe and found that NSH did not constitute a divergent lineage relative to other populations.
Finally, Freyhof & Schöter [27] analysed snout length and
gill raker numbers in preserved specimens of whitefish
from extant and extinct populations. They concluded that
the remaining extant NSH population represents the same
species as other Danish whitefish (named C. maraena),
whereas the "true" NSH (i.e. C. oxyrhynchus) was restricted

to the Rhine River region but is now extinct. However, the
basis for this conclusion must be considered questionable, as homoplasy for morphological traits is common
within Coregonus [9,16,17,28].
The extant NSH population is now subject to a large-scale
rehabilitation programme, which involves habitat restoration and removal of impassable dams in rivers along the
Danish Wadden Sea coast. NSH has also been reintroduced into other Danish and German rivers in the region.
Nevertheless, knowledge of the evolutionary history of
NSH and its relationships to ELW populations in the
region remains scarce. The studies undertaken so far have

either focused on the evolutionary history of the C. lavaretus complex on a large geographical scale [17] or made
deductions about genetic relationships based on estimates of genetic differentiation [24]. Both in the context
of setting conservation priorities and understanding the
dynamics of postglacial phenotypic divergence there is an
important need to obtain specific knowledge of historical
and contemporary gene flow and to assess reproductive
isolation between NSH and ELW.

distinctiveness of NSH vs. ELW. This was achieved by analysing contemporary and historical gene flow and reproductive isolation between populations. Based on these
results we assessed whether NSH fulfils the criteria of the
Biological Species Concept [29], and we used the frameworks described by Waples [20], Moritz [30], Crandall et
al. [21] and Green [31] for assessing its conservation priority.

Methods
We analysed variation at 12 microsatellite DNA loci in 9
populations of the C. lavaretus complex (Table 1; Fig. 2).
One ELW population was from the Baltic Sea, five populations represented ELW from the North Sea region, and
NSH was represented by samples from the extant Vidaa
River and samples from two rivers subject to reintroduction efforts. Temporal samples from 1977–1980 and to
the present were available from the Vidaa (NSH) and the
Ringkøbing Fjord (ELW) populations.
The main objectives of the study were to analyze postglacial recolonization patterns and assess the evolutionary

Samples and populations
We analysed 15 samples from 9 populations, summarized
in Table 1. All except two populations are anadromous,
but only NSH populations migrate into a fully saline environment, whereas the other populations migrate into
brackish environments (< 15 ‰). Two of the samples
(VID80 and RIN77) consisted of archived scale samples,
whereas the remaining samples consisted of adipose fin
clips stored in 96% ethanol. The fish were caught either by
electrofishing (samples from rivers) or by net (samples
from fjords and lakes).

Microsatellite DNA analysis
DNA was extracted from tissue samples using either phenol-chloform extraction [32] or proteinase K – Chelex
extraction [33]. DNA from archived scale samples were
extracted using a phenol-chloform extraction procedure
modified for "ancient" DNA [34]. Twelve microsatellite
loci were analysed: Sfo23 [35], Bwf1 and Bwf2 [36],
BFRO018 [37], C2-157 [38], Cocl-Lav1, Cocl-Lav4, CoclLav6, Cocl-Lav18, Cocl-Lav27, Cocl-Lav49 and Cocl-Lav52
[39]. Details about PCR conditions, electrophoresis and
scoring are given in [40].

Statistical analyses
Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were tested
by exact tests [41] using GENEPOP 3.1d [42]. Genetic variation within samples was quantified by observed (Ho)
and expected (He) heterozygosity, and by allelic richness
[43], a measure of the number of alleles independent of
sample size.

We tested for outlier status and possible selection at each
of the microsatellite loci using the method and software
FDIST2 [44]. We assumed a model of 50 populations

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:137

exchanging migrants and sample sizes of 30 individuals
and further based the simulations on a step-wise mutation
model.
Genetic differentiation was estimated by θST [45] and by
RST, the latter of which incorporates mutational information and assumes a step-wise mutation model [46]. The
software ARLEQUIN 3.0 [47] was used for estimating θST
and the significance was tested by permuting individuals
100,000 times among samples. RST was estimated using
SPAGEDI 1.1 [48], and by permuting allele sizes among
alleles (10,000 times) it was tested whether RST was significantly higher than θST [49]. The genetic relationships
among populations were further visualized by a multidimensional scaling plot based on θST between pairs of samples, using VISTA 5.6.3 (Young FW. ViSta: The Visual
Statistics System. Research Memorandum 94-1(b) (2nd.
ed.). 1996. Chapel Hill, NC, L.L.Thursone Psychometric
Laboratory, University of North Carolina). All tests for significance of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and pairwise
θST and RST were corrected for multiple tests by calculating
the False Dicovery Rate (FDR) [50].
We used the Bayesian clustering approach implemented
in STRUCTURE 2.2 [51,52] for 1) estimating the number
of populations/groups represented by the sampled individuals (k) and 2) assigning individuals to populations
without using prior information of the sample of origin.
For estimating the most likely k we conducted runs assuming k = 1..10. We assumed an admixture model and correlated allele frequencies. Each run consisted of a burn-in of
100,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps, followed by 500,000 steps. Ten replicates were conducted for
each k. We plotted the probability of the data [(P(D)] and
the ad hoc statistic Δk [53], the latter of which measures
the steepest increase of the probability of k. STRUCTURE
2.2 was furthermore used for estimating individual
admixture proportions in the VAR94 and VAR04 samples,
which represent an introduced NSH population that we
suspected had become admixed with ELW. We used individuals from VID and RIN as baseline samples, chose the
option "use popinfo" for VID and RIN individuals,
assumed an admixture model and correlated allele frequencies, and then estimated individual admixture proportions and their 90% posterior probability intervals for
the VAR94 and VAR04 individuals.
Population level admixture proportions in VAR94 and
VAR04 were analysed using the method and software
ADMIX 2.0 [54], with standard deviations estimated
based on bootstrapping 10,000 times over loci. Given that
admixture was expected to have occurred recently, we did
not consider molecular distances between alleles.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/137

Contemporary gene flow among most populations was
considered unlikely, as this would require migration
through highly saline water. However, given that NSH can
tolerate oceanic salinities, gene flow may occur between
VID, RIB and VAR and the neighbouring RIN and NIS
ELW populations. This was analysed using the individual
assignment based method BAYESASS 1.3 [55], which estimates migration rates based on the inferred proportion of
immigrants within the past two generations. Initial runs
showed that genetic differentiation was too low for estimating migration involving VID and RIB and RIN and
NIS, respectively, and due to possible hybridization in
VAR (see Results) this population was not included. Consequently, VID and RIB and RIN and NIS were pooled into
two groups of populations. Three independent runs
showed that 107 MCMC steps, of which the first 106 steps
were burn-in, were sufficient to achieve convergence. We
then conducted a final analysis based on 2 × 107 MCMC
steps, of which 2 × 106 steps were burn-in.
We further estimated effective population size (Ne) in VID
and RIN using 1) a temporal method which assumes a
closed population [56], and 2) a temporal method which
assumes a population open to gene flow and estimates
immigration rate (m) and Ne [57]. This was based on the
temporal samples from VID taken in 1980, 1994 and
2002, and from RIN taken in 1977, 1995 and 2004. When
Ne and m was estimated for VID, all temporal samples
from RIN were pooled to represent a possible source of
migrants and vice versa. We assumed a generation length
of 4 years for NSH [40] and for RIN ELW we estimated the
mean age of reproduction to be 2.92 (~3) years based on
unpublished data from scale readings, and used this value
as a proxy for generation length.
Historical gene flow and effective population size was
analysed as implemented in the software MIGRATE 2.0.3
[58]. The method is based on a coalescence model with
mutation and migration and estimates a measure of effective population size, θ, defined as 4Neμ, where μ denotes
mutation rate, and migration M, defined as m/μ, where m
denotes migration rate. To provide unscaled parameters
we estimated mutation rates for the individual loci based
on an analysis of the GUD sample using the method
MSVAR 2.0 [59]. This approach yielded mutation rates
ranging from 1.01 × 10-4 to 9.00 × 10-4 for individual loci,
with a geometric mean value of 2.81 × 10-4. This value corresponds well with an estimate of mutation rate for microsatellite loci in Cyprinus carpio of 5.56 × 10-4 [60] and a
mean mutation rate of ca. 10-4 for microsatellites in
humans [61]. We assumed a step-wise mutation model
and based estimates on fifteen short (104 MCMC steps)
and five long (105 steps) chains. To ensure convergence,
we used the "adaptive heating" option with one "cold"
and three "hot" chains. Three runs were conducted, with

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:137

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/137

run number two and three using the estimates of the previous run as starting parameters. The results did not
change much after the first analysis, suggesting that convergence had been achieved, and we report the results of
the third run. We omitted the RIB and VAR populations
from the analyses, as they are assumed to represent introduced populations, and we used the most recent samples
from the VID and RIN populations (VID02 and RIN04).
Finally, we estimated historical effective population sizes,
migration rates and splitting time between the VID and
RIN populations using the Bayesian, coalescence and
MCMC based method IMa [62]. The method assumes an
isolation-with-gene-flow model, where a single population at some point back in time splits into two, which are
subsequently connected by some level of gene flow. The
following parameters are estimated: θA, the effective population size in the ancestral population prior to splitting;
θ1 and θ2, the effective population size of population 1
and 2, respectively, after splitting; m1 and m2, the migration rate from population 2 into population 1 and vice
versa; and t, the point back in time when the ancestral
population split into two. All parameters are scaled by
mutation rate. To provide unscaled parameters we used
the same mutation rate estimate as described for
MIGRATE (see above). We conducted several initial runs
and found that a heated chain approach with 25 chains
(parameters g1 = 0.0013 and g2 = 2) and an initial burnin of 106 MCMC steps followed by 4 × 106 steps was
required to reach convergence. We assumed a generation
time of four years and the following additional parameters: q1 = q2 = qA = 40, m1 = m2 = 40 and t = 10.

Results
Genetic variation and relationships among populations
Variation at the 12 microsatellite loci ranged from 4 to 34
alleles (see Additional file 1). Eleven significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed

among a total of 180 tests (6.1%). Three deviations were
observed at the locus Sfo23 and three at locus Cocl-Lav1.
However, there were no general patterns suggesting null
alleles at these loci, although we cannot rule out that null
alleles may be present at varying frequencies among populations.

θST [45] among all populations was moderate but statistically highly significant (0.069, p < 0.0001; temporal samples from the same populations were pooled). A test for
outlier status of individual loci using FDIST2 [44] identified one locus, Cocl-Lav27, as a significant outlier (θST =
0.249, p < 0.0001). This locus showed low variation (a
total of four alleles; see Additional file 1), and one allele
(183 bp) exhibited a frequency of 0.857 in VID, whereas
another allele (185 bp) was present at a frequency of
0.838 in ROS. We were unable to distinguish if diversifying selection is acting on this locus or if the strong differentiation is due to a combination of a signal of postglacial
recolonization and low variability. However, we omitted
the locus from analyses based on coalescence (MIGRATE
and IMa), where selection at a locus could result in seriously misleading outcomes.
Pairwise θST between all samples showed low and mainly
non-significant differentiation between temporal samples
from the NSH population VID and the ELW population
RIN, whereas significant differentiation was observed
between temporal samples of NSH from RIB and VAR
(Table 2). Significant differentiation was evident between
samples of NSH from VID and RIB vs. the two geographically most proximate ELW populations, RIN and NIS (θST
ranging between 0.055 and 0.108). Curiously, however,
the VAR sample from 2004 showed closer genetic relationships to the RIN and NIS ELW samples (θST from
0.017 – 0.033) compared to the VAR sample from 1994.
The GUD ELW population showed relatively close relationships to RIN and NIS and more distant relationships

loci (results not shown). At the single locus level, 22 tests
among a total of 432 tests yielded p-values < 0.05 (without correction for multiple tests). Five of these involved
the locus Sfo23 and the ROS population, which was the
most divergent population in terms of θST (see Table 2),
whereas thirteen tests involved the locus bwf1 and samples of North Sea houting from VID, RIB and VAR. Thus,
we do not entirely rule out that mutation has played a
minor role in generating genetic divergence, but drift has
played the predominant role.

to the other populations. Both Limfjord populations (KIL,
FLY) and particularly the Baltic Sea population ROS,
showed strong genetic differentiation to other populations (pairwise θST up to 0.184).
A multidimensional scaling plot based on pairwise θST
values identified four groups of samples separated along
dimensions 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). The first consisted of NSH
samples from VID and RIB along with the VAR sample
from 1994. The second consisted of ELW samples from
RIN, NIS and GUD. The VAR sample from 2004 was intermediate between these two groups. The two Limfjord
populations KIL and FLY formed a third group, whereas
the fourth group consisted only of ROS, which was distinct from all other populations. Applying other genetic
distances, such as Nei's DA [63] yielded essentially similar
results.
RST was 0.036 (p < 0.001) among all populations. Pairwise RST values between samples are shown in Table 2. If
RST > FST (or θST) this would imply that mutation as
opposed to drift plays a significant role in creating genetic
differentiation among populations, suggesting that divergence has occurred over very long time scales. However,
the test for RST > θST [49] yielded no evidence for a higher
RST than θST among all samples. Tests between pairs of
populations, after pooling temporal samples within populations, also yielded no significant outcomes across all

Bayesian clustering of individuals
Replicate estimation of the probability of the data [P(D)]
using STRUCTURE 2.2 [51,52] and assuming k = 1..10
showed that P(D) reached a plateau for k = 4 (Fig. 4). Conversely, estimation of Δk, which measures the steepest
increase in P(D) [53], was clearly highest for k = 2 (Fig. 4).
Inspection of the partition of individuals showed that
individuals from NSH samples were split from the
remaining populations at k = 2, but k = 3 and 4 provided
further partitioning of populations. Assuming k > 4 did
not identify more groups, and we therefore conclude that
k = 4 captures most of the biological information in the
data. The partitioning of individuals at k = 4 is shown in
Fig. 5. The first cluster consists of individuals from NSH
populations (VID and RIB), and the second cluster consists of individuals from the ELW populations RIN, NIS
and GUD. Interestingly, the VAR94 and particularly
VAR04 samples appear to consist of a mixture of these two
groups. This analysis, involving all samples and not making use of learning samples, does not resolve whether or
not interbreeding occurs between NSH and ELW. Consequently, we conducted more detailed analyses of individual admixture proportions in VAR using VID and RIN as
baseline samples and assuming k = 2 (see below). The
third cluster consists of the populations FLY and partly
KIL, both from the Limfjord region, whereas the ROS population from the Baltic Sea makes up the fourth cluster.
Analyses of the four clusters separately did not identify
additional groups (data not shown).
Contemporary gene flow and effective population size
Contemporary gene flow estimated using BAYESASS 1.3
[55] was very low: 0.0055 (95% CI 0.0001 – 0.0167) from
NSH to ELW (i.e. VID/RIB to RIN/NIS) and 0.0049 (95%
CI 0.0002 – 0.0162) from ELW to NSH (i.e. RIN/NIS to
VID/RIB).

Effective population size (Ne) estimated using a temporal
method assuming no migration [56] yielded values of 522
and 521, respectively, in VID and RIN (Table 3). Using a
method which assumes a population open to gene flow
and which simultaneously estimates Ne and m (immigration rate) [57] yielded very low m values, i.e. 0.0007 in
VID and 0.0062 in RIN. However, under this assumption

Ne estimates differed considerably; 1139 in VID and 273
in RIN (Table 3), demonstrating that Ne estimates with
this method are highly sensitive towards inferred migration rates [64].
Historical gene flow and splitting time
Analysis of historical demographic parameters using
MIGRATE 2.0.3 [58] yielded θ values ranging between
0.31 (GUD) and 0.57 (ROS) (Fig. 6). Assuming a geometric mean mutation rate of 2.81 × 10-4 as estimated for the
loci analysed in this study, this would correspond to historical Ne estimates ranging from 276 to 508. Historical
migration rate estimates, M, ranged from 4.8 to 36.4 (see
Fig. 6 and Additional file 2). Assuming the same mutation
rate as above this corresponds to migration rates ranging
between 0.001 and 0.010. The direction of migration and
approximate migration rates are shown in Fig. 6. The
results suggest historical migration in a north-eastern
direction from VID, along the Jutland North Sea coast and
via the Limfjord, with bidirectional gene flow occuring
within regions (i.e. VID, RIN, NIS and FLY, KIL). ROS
from the Baltic Sea was the most isolated population.

Estimation of splitting time between the indigenous NSH
population VID and the geographically most proximate
ELW population RIN using the IMa software [62] resulted

in a scaled splitting time parameter, t, of 0.174 (Table 4).
Assuming the estimated mutation rate of 2.81 × 10-4 this
corresponds to 2482 years before present (90% credible
interval 641 – 4344 years). The inferred estimates of historical Ne and m showed good correspondence with those
obtained using MIGRATE (Table 4).
Admixture analyses
Several of the analyses suggested that the VAR population,
which was supposed to represent NSH reintroduced from
VID, was in fact admixed with ELW. We obtained information that the VAR river had been stocked with ELW in
the 1980s originating from either KIL or RIN (Peter
Geertz-Hansen, Technical University of Denmark,
National Institute of Aquatic Resources, personal communication). However, the results using STRUCTURE 2.2
(Fig. 5) pointed to RIN or NIS as the most likely contributors rather than KIL. Analysis of admixture proportions
using ADMIX 2.0 [54] and assuming VID, RIN and KIL as
baseline populations showed a negative admixture proportion of KIL in the VAR94 sample, suggesting that KIL
had not contributed to admixture, whereas VID and RIN
contributed approx. 80 and 20%, respectively (Table 5). A
positive, albeit small admixture proportion of KIL (9%),
was found in the VAR04 sample, whereas VID contributed
50% and RIN 41% (Table 5). Thus, we conclude that VAR

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:137

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/137

is an admixed population with the major proportions
contributed by VID and RIN, whereas KIL has made a
minor, if any contribution.
We further used STRUCTURE 2.2 [51,52] for analysing
individual admixture proportions (q) in VAR94 and
VAR04 using VID and RIN as learning samples. In the
VAR94 sample there was limited evidence for hybridization, although two individuals showed intermediate q values (Fig. 7a). The VAR04 sample, however, contained
several individuals showing intermediate q values and
with 90% confidence intervals not including 0 and 1 (Fig.
7b). A total of 16 individuals (44%) showed individual
admixture proportions of RIN ranging from 0.25 to 0.75.
We cannot be certain that they all represent admixed individuals and the results do not allow for distinguishing F1
hybrids from backcrosses. Nevertheless, the results provide evidence that NSH and ELW are not reproductively
isolated when they occur in sympatry.

Discussion
Our study's results suggest that the sampled populations
constitute four major groups, one of which represents
NSH, and that all populations except ROS from the Baltic
Sea show modest genetic differentiation, presumably
reflecting a recent common ancestry and a single postglacial recolonization event. Moreover, the two geographically closest indigenous populations of NSH and ELW
(VID and RIN) must be considered reproductively isolated at present but have nevertheless split recently, perhaps within the past few thousand years. Finally, NSH and
ELW appear to interbreed where they have been brought
into contact in one locality (VAR). We discuss these findings below along with their implications for species designation and for prioritizing populations for conservation.

Postglacial recolonization and genetic population
structure
Subfossil remains of fish from the Coregonus lavaretus
complex, northern pike (Esox lucius), burbot (Lota lota),
ruffe (Acerina cernua) and smelt (Osmerus operlanus) have
all been recovered from a lake deposit in northern Jutland
and dated to approximately 11,000 years bp [65]. Hence,
whitefish were among the first freshwater fish species to
recolonize the Jutland Peninsula. In general, whitefishes,
northern pike and burbot exhibit a circumpolar distribution and bear genetic signatures of rapid postglacial
expansion [17,66-69], thereby conforming to the definition of pioneer species sensu Hewitt [70]. There was moderate genetic differentiation among all samples (excluding
ROS) and the tests for RST > θST [49] suggested that mutation has played a minor role in generating population differentiation. This indeed suggests rapid recolonization of
the Jutland Peninsula, predominantly from a single
source. The inferred direction of historical gene flow (Fig.

European lineage, encompassing the Jutland Peninsula.
However, this study also found a minor contribution of a
separate Northern European lineage in several Danish
populations, a finding that would be difficult to confirm
by analyzing microsatellite DNA markers. Moreover, our
results do not allow for distinguishing whether this
admixture of lineages occurred prior to postglacial recolonization, or if a separate minor recolonization event by
the Northern European lineage took place.
The Bayesian clustering of individuals (Fig. 5) might at
first seem to contradict a common source of recolonization of all populations, given that ELW from RIN, NIS and
GUD formed one cluster, whereas the two populations
from the Limfjord, KIL and FLY, formed a separate cluster.
These latter two populations are interspersed between NIS
and GUD on the supposed route of recolonization via the
Elbe River (Fig. 1), so it seems illogical that they should
not belong to the same cluster. However, whereas the
environment in GUD has been relatively stable in the long
term, the Limfjord is a highly dynamic region, which has
experienced repeated opening and closure of the connection to the North Sea. The latest disconnection from the
North Sea lasted from ca. 1100 to 1825, and during that
period the main part of the Limfjord was brackish and
supported large populations of ELW [71]. In 1825, a
storm reconnected the Limfjord and the North Sea, and
the increased salinity caused immediate extirpation of
most whitefish. The FLY and KIL populations can be considered remnants of these large populations, and we suggest that repeated extinctions, recolonizations and
population size fluctuations during cycles of brackish and
high salinity conditions have led to stronger drift and
changes in allele frequencies as compared to other Danish
ELW populations.
Whereas gene flow has occurred historically between populations, they must now be considered reproductively isolated, although contemporary gene flow might still take
place between certain ELW populations owing to their
low genetic differentiation (e.g. RIN and NIS). The region
inhabited by RIN and NIS is marshy with several smaller
lakes and rivers, which could become connected at high
water levels. Hence, occasional gene flow is certainly a
possibility. Available temporal Ne estimates (under the

assumption of no gene flow) in RIN and VID, were also
relatively high (point estimates exceeded 500). Detailed
analyses of the demographic history of VID further
showed that Ne has been stable over the past ca. 20 years
[40]. We cannot be certain that current Ne is also high in
the other samples for which temporal samples were not
available. However, since historical Ne (θ) did not vary
much among populations (Fig. 6), it is reasonable to
assume that all populations are relatively large. Hence,
NSH and ELW of the Jutland Peninsula can be described
as a system of relatively large populations sharing a common postglacial ancestry, which are now reproductively
isolated and potentially following separate evolutionary
trajectories.
Reproductive isolation and species designation
The taxonomy of the Coregonus lavaretus complex is chaotic and numerous species have been described [72].
These species designations have been based on the Phylogenetic Species Concept [73], which defines species as the
smallest lineages or population groups that can be united
by synapomorphic characters, i.e. shared characters derived
from a common ancestor. NSH has traditionally been
considered a species (C. oxyrhynchus) separate from ELW
(C. lavaretus) based particularly on its elongated snout
and its ability to tolerate oceanic salinities [26]. It has also
sometimes been denoted as a high gill raker morph,
although by comparison to other C. lavaretus populations
the gill raker numbers must be considered intermediate;
the mean gill raker number is 32.1 (s.d. 1.7) in VID vs. a
range of mean values from 16.8 – 46.0 in other European
populations, and a range from 29.1 to 35.5 in RIN, NIS,
FLY and GUD (see supplementary material in [17]).
Hence, gill raker number does not separate NSH from
geographically proximate ELW populations. On the other

Page 12 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:137

hand, NSH is distinct by showing a higher age at reproduction than ELW; 4.0 years in NSH from VID vs. 2.9 years
in ELW from RIN ([40]; this study), and a considerably
higher mean length at reproduction in VID than in RIN
(ca. 45 cm vs. 35 cm; Hvidt CB, Christensen IG: Træk af
Nordsøsnæblens (Coregonus oxyrhynchus L.) biologi i Vidåsystemet. Aarhus, Denmark: Institute of Biology, University of Aarhus; 1990. M.Sc. Thesis). All together, these
characters might justify separate species designation of
NSH adopting a Phylogenetic Species Concept, but the
lack of demonstration of the genetic basis of these characters and absence of analysis of phenotype-environment
associations would inevitably cast doubt on this classification.
From an evolutionary biology perspective, adoption of
the Biological Species Concept [29] is more satisfactory, as
it directly addresses the issue of reproductive isolation;
species are defined as biological entities that show reproductive isolation even when they occur in sympatry. The
presence of both ELW and NSH in VAR provides a rare
opportunity for testing reproductive isolation in sympatry, and the results suggest interbreeding in the VAR04
sample, as 16 out of 36 individuals showed individual
admixture coefficients ranging between 0.25 and 0.75
(Fig. 7b). It is puzzling that there is a lower contribution
of ELW and fewer hybrids in the VAR94 sample. Based on
records from 1994 we assume that this is due to biased
sampling, where individuals with ELW morphology were
omitted.
The results suggest that NSH and ELW may not qualify as
separate species according to a Biological Species Concept. The acid test would involve demonstration of interbreeding beyond the F1 generation and lack of
postzygotic selection against hybrids, which could otherwise act to maintain species integrity despite interbreeding. There was insufficient statistical power in the
STRUCTURE analyses to unambiguously identify backcrosses, which would require analysis of many more loci
given the relatively low genetic differentiation [74]. It
should be noted that further analyses using the method
NEWHYBRIDS [75] yielded qualitatively similar results,
but also failed to distinguish F1 hybrids from F2 and backcrosses (data not shown).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/137

A more pragmatic alternative to the Biological Species
Concept would be Mallet's concept of Genotypic Clusters
[76], where species are identified as groups of individuals
separated into discrete clusters of genetic variation. This
concept allows for interbreeding between species as long
as clustering is maintained. NSH and ELW have recently
come into contact in VAR and some discreteness of clustering would be expected even in the case of random mating. However, continuous monitoring of individual
clustering using STRUCTURE could provide a test of species integrity according to the concept of Genotypic Clusters.
Although NSH and ELW do not show reproductive isolation in VAR, their sympatric occurrence is an artefact
resulting from stocking. Different statistical methods
based on fundamentally different principles [55,57,62] all
suggest contemporary reproductive isolation between
allopatric NSH and ELW populations. However, estimated splitting time between VID and RIN was surprisingly recent, ranging between 600 – 4300 years under the
assumption of the estimated mutation rate of 2.81 × 10-4
(Table 4). The formation of the Wadden Sea dates back to
the rise of sea level 8,000 – 10,000 years bp, though it has
since then been a dynamic region [77]. The estimate of
splitting time is highly dependent on the assumed mutation rate, and it would require only a slightly lower mutation rate, 1.5 × 10-4, for the 90% credible interval for
splitting time to encompass 8,000 years. We therefore
conclude that NSH and ELW have split within the past few
thousand years, but we are unable to provide a more exact
timing. Given that NSH inhabits the Wadden Sea area we
find it most plausible that its divergence is associated with
the formation of this marine region.
The question remains whether the VID population is in
fact a remnant of a single species or morph previously distributed throughout the Wadden Sea region. Coregonids
show extensive potential for homoplasy in morphological
traits [9,16,28], and the possibility certainly exists that
similar morphs have evolved repeatedly and independently within the region from the Rhine River in the South
to the Varde River in the North. Answering this question
would require analysis of samples from other, now extinct
populations. Analysis of DNA from archived historical

samples, such as scales, is probably the only option for
resolving this issue [34].
Conservation priorities
Questioning species designation can be contentious, as
species have previously been conceived as the primary
units for conservation. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that conservation should also recognize
intraspecific diversity to conserve the evolutionary legacy
of species [20-22]. In the following we apply four different
approaches for defining conservation units to the case of
NSH vs. ELW.

The Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) concept as
defined by Waples [20] states that an ESU is a population
or group of populations that shows substantial reproductive
isolation from other populations and constitutes an important component of the evolutionary legacy of the species. Under
natural circumstances NSH does show reproductive isolation from ELW populations in the region. However, most
allopatric ELW would also fulfill that criterion. NSH is
also morphologically distinct and shows adaptation to
oceanic salinities. The latter property could be regarded as
an important component of the evolutionary legacy of the
C. lavaretus complex, though it ranks as one among a
number of other recently evolved remarkable features
found among populations within the complex (see e.g.
[8,18]). Hence, NSH would qualify as an ESU, but so
would numerous other recently diverged forms. This
would be biologically defendable [78], but would lead to
a very large number of units with limited resources to protect them all. On the scale of the North Sea region and the
Jutland Peninsula, NSH would stand out more clearly as a
distinct unit.
The second approach by Moritz [30] adopts the criteria
that ESUs should exhibit reciprocal monophyly for mtDNA
haplotypes and significant genetic differentiation at nuclear
loci. This approach operates with a second category, management units (MU), i.e. populations showing significant
differentiation at nuclear loci but not reciprocal monophyly at mtDNA. As this ESU definition stresses the timeframe over which populations have been reproductively
isolated, it is unsurprising that NSH does not qualify as an
ESU; mtDNA haplotypes in NSH vs. neighbouring ELW
populations do not show reciprocal monophyly [17].
Instead, the three phylogeographical lineages identified
by Østbye et al. [17] would be designated as ESUs. Given
the significant differentiation at microsatellite loci, NSH
would be categorized as an MU within the Central European lineage, but most of the other studied populations
would also be granted MU status.
Crandall et al.'s [21] framework for defining conservation
units assesses both reproductive isolation and adaptive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/137

divergence by considering hypotheses of genetic exchangeability (reproductive isolation) and ecological exchangeability (essentially adaptive divergence). Moreover, these
criteria are considered on both a contemporary and historical time scale. We reject the hypothesis of contemporary genetic exchangeability between all populations. If
we define historical exchangeability as dating back to
postglacial recolonization, then we accept the hypothesis
of historical genetic exchangeability of all populations.
However, if "historical" is defined as pre-dating major
anthropogenic influence, tentatively 500 years bp, then
we reject the hypothesis for most populations, including
VID vs. RIN.
The data on ecological exchangeability is much scarcer.
We are not aware of any adaptive divergence among the
ELW populations of the study. This, however, does not
preclude that adaptive divergence actually exists. The only
feature that really stands out is high salinity tolerance in
VID (NSH) and we therefore reject the hypothesis of contemporary ecological exchangeability between NSH and
ELW. There are no long-term data relating to ecological
exchangeability. If we consider a postglacial time-scale,
then we would assume that ecological exchangeability
existed, while it is most likely that high salinity tolerance
was present in VID (NSH) if we consider a time scale of
500 years bp. Depending on the definition of historical
exchangeability the recommendation would then be to
treat VID (NSH) as a distinct species (500 years time scale)
or a distinct population (postglacial time scale).
Finally, the Designatable Unit (DU) described by Green
[31] is closely related to Waples' ESU definition [20], but
additionally takes extinction risk into account. As previously discussed, NSH must be considered a separate unit,
though its uniqueness depends on the scale considered. It
is virtually impossible to assess extinction risk across the
whole C. lavaretus complex, but on a local scale none of
the studied ELW populations are considered endangered.
The VID population appears stable and not immediately
endangered [40] but is nevertheless the only remaining
indigenous population of NSH. Hence, NSH and the VID
population would qualify as a Designatable Unit, but its
conservation priority and need for a recovery plan would
require more detailed analysis of extinction risk.
Altogether, NSH stands out as a separate conservation
unit, although its distinctiveness varies considerably
depending on the framework applied. Moreover, prioritization depends on the spatial or temporal scale considered, with highest prioritization granted on finer or
shorter scales.
The current rehabilitation program for NSH is based on
restoring habitat in four rivers in the Danish region of the

Page 14 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:137

Wadden Sea, including the Vidaa River. These rivers harbour a number of other endangered species listed in the
Berne Convention on the Conservation of European
Wildlife and Natural Habitats. This includes the last remnants of indigenous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations in the region from the Jutland Peninsula to
Northern France [79], twaite shad (Alosa fallax) and sea
lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), all of which would benefit
from a NSH conservation program. Thus, an integrated
approach combining conservation priority of NSH relative to other C. lavaretus forms with principles for identifying areas of importance for biodiversity conservation
[80] might be a fruitful way to settle uncertainties, and
would undoubtedly result in higher priority for the rehabilitation program as a whole.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/137

in most cases remains scarce and circumstantial, unless
demanding tests such as common garden experiments are
conducted. There are also no ideal frameworks available
for assessing conservation priorities at the subspecific
level. Even putatively objective methods involve subjectivity, such as defining time scales for historical exchangeability using Crandall et al.'s [21] approach or defining the
geographical scales to consider. This calls for pragmatism,
where the subjectivity involved is acknowledged and
clearly presented. Finally, just as identification of conservation units should consider intraspecific biodiversity,
our study shows that consideration of biodiversity at the
species level in the region of interest may help to settle
otherwise unclear cases of conservation priorities.

Authors' contributions
Conclusion
We conclude that fishes of the C. lavaretus complex that
have recolonized the Jutland Peninsula after the last glaciation are the result of recolonization, which mainly or
exclusively took place via the ancient Elbe River system.
The present populations arose due to vicariance following
rising sea levels that disconnected water bodies from the
Elbe River.
Based on all existing scientific information, NSH is genetically and ecologically distinct albeit closely related to
ELW populations in the same region. In particular, the
ability of NSH to tolerate high salinities is unique within
the C. lavaretus complex. Estimates of splitting time suggest that divergence has occurred within the past few
thousand years. Natural gene flow does not occur at
present between NSH and ELW, but the observation of
interbreeding in one location where they have been
brought into contact by stocking, suggests that reproductive isolation is incomplete. Depending on the degree of
interbreeding beyond the F1 level and the presence or
absence of postzygotic reproductive barriers this may call
the separate species status of NSH and ELW into question,
and NSH is perhaps best regarded as an ecologically and
morphologically divergent morph and incipient species.
NSH should be managed separately from ELW populations in the region, but the degree to which it should be
prioritized depends on the spatial or temporal scale considered.
The case of the North Sea houting and European lake
whitefish provides an important example of postglacially
evolved biodiversity in the Northern Hemisphere. It also
illustrates the challenges for setting conservation priorities
for species complexes exhibiting a shallow phylogeny but
potentially considerable phenotypic and adaptive diversity. Even though analysis of molecular markers may
greatly increase knowledge about genetic contingency and
reproductive isolation, evidence for adaptive divergence
