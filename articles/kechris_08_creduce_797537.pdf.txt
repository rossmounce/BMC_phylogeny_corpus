Abstract
Background: Computational methods for characterizing novel transcription factor binding sites
search for sequence patterns or "motifs" that appear repeatedly in genomic regions of interest.
Correlation-based motif finding strategies are used to identify motifs that correlate with expression
data and do not rely on promoter sequences from a pre-determined set of genes.
Results: In this work, we describe a method for predicting motifs that combines the correlationbased strategy with phylogenetic footprinting, where motifs are identified by evaluating
orthologous sequence regions from multiple species. Our method, c-REDUCE, can account for
variability at a motif position inferred from evolutionary information. c-REDUCE has been tested
on ChIP-chip data for yeast transcription factors and on gene expression data in Drosophila.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that utilizing sequence conservation information in addition to
correlation-based methods improves the identification of known motifs.

Background
An important problem in genome annotation is the identification and characterization of functional elements.
These elements include transcription factor binding sites
(TFBS), which are short, degenerate sequences that appear
frequently in the genome. The interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their respective binding sites
are critical for regulating gene expression. To characterize
binding sequences for a TF, computational methods
search for sequence patterns or "motifs" that appear
repeatedly in genomic regions of interest (for a recent
review, see [1]).
For many motif-finding methods, it is necessary to input
upstream sequences from a set of genes (e.g., genes that

have been identified as co-expressed from a microarray
gene expression analysis), with the assumption that a
common motif is shared by the sequences (e.g., [2,3]).
However, upstream sequences of genes included in this
set may not have an occurrence of the same motif, or
genes that have the occurrence of the motif in their
upstream sequence may not be identified in the coexpressed set. To address these weaknesses, correlationbased motif finding methods [4] have been developed
that do not rely on a pre-determined set of genes either
based on co-expression (e.g., [2,3]) or over-representation
of motifs as in [5]. Using all genes from a single experiment, oligos in a specified length range are enumerated in
their upstream sequence and tested for significant correlation with expression values or genome-wide location

measurements for a particular TF. The correlation-based
motif finding approach was introduced in the "Regulatory
Element Detection Using Correlation with Expression"
(REDUCE) software [4] using a linear regression framework and has since been adapted in several ways including the use of scores to motifs instead of oligo counts [6],
probabilistic representations of motifs [7], binary indicators for word occurrences [8] and flexible non-linear
regression functions [9,10].
An alternative motif-finding strategy, relying on the availability of complete genomes from related species, has
made it possible to search for putative TFBS in evolutionarily conserved sequences. It has been shown that for
closely related species, where reasonable alignment of the
orthologous promoter sequences can be achieved, the
binding sites for many TFs are evolutionarily conserved.
Different computational methods have been developed
that vary in the number and diversity of species investigated, in search strategies, i.e. genome-wide (e.g., [11,12])
versus gene sets (e.g., [13]), in whether they use known
transcription factors motifs (e.g., [14]) or predict motifs de
novo (e.g., [15]), in how they integrate inter-species conservation with intra-species conservation (e.g., [16]), in
whether the alignment of the motif occurrences across
species is required (e.g., [17]) and in whether global alignments in orthologous sequences are necessary [18].
In summary, there are numerous motif finding methods
that fall into several different classes, including those
reviewed that are correlation or sequence-conservation
based. Because of their successes individually, in this
work, we describe a new method for predicting motifs that
combines these two strategies.
Due to the variability in TF-DNA interactions, TFBS are
characterized by motifs containing degenerate positions.
For example, the second position in the consensus TFBS
for the yeast transcription factor OPI1 (GRTTCGA) can be
A or G, which is denoted by the IUPAC symbol R. At a
functional TFBS, the possible substitutions at a position
may be observed in aligned sequences from multiple species. For example, an OPI1 functional site may be fully
conserved across species (as GATTCGA or GGTTCGA) or
exhibit A or G at the second position for different species.
To search for degenerate motifs, we have developed an
adaptation of the correlation-based algorithm REDUCE
[4] called conservation-REDUCE (c-REDUCE). In cREDUCE, a multiple species alignment is generated and
then translated into a consensus pattern using degenerate
nucleotide symbols that capture the variation at each
position across species. All oligos, including those with
degenerate symbols, are then evaluated for significant correlation. By using multiple species data, we can identify

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/506

motifs that may be missed by REDUCE, which only examines sequences from a single species and requires exactly
the same oligo in different sequences.
An alternative method for identifying degenerate motifs is
fast-REDUCE (f-REDUCE) [19], which was developed for
single species data and identifies degenerate motifs
through an enumerative approach. However, enumeration of degenerate motifs can become very costly as the
length of the motif and number of degenerate positions
increases. In contrast, c-REDUCE reduces the search space
of degenerate motifs by taking into account the variability
at a position inferred from evolutionary information.
In summary, c-REDUCE benefits from the use of conservation in two ways. First, it predicts degenerate motifs, but
reduces the search space by only focusing on naturally
occurring degeneracies that appear across multiple species. Second, by examining sequences from multiple species, it will discount chance matches of a motif in a single
species if it the match has a highly degenerate consensus
sequence in the multiple species alignment. The degeneracy of the consensus, reflecting random mutations in
other species, makes a functional TFBS at that position
less likely. To predict transcription factor binding site
motifs, our method is evaluated on ChIP-chip (chromatin
immunoprecipitation on microarray) data in yeast and
gene expression data in Drosophila. We find that the conservation and correlation-based approaches perform better in combination than they do individually.

Results
c-REDUCE applied to yeast data
c-REDUCE was first applied to the 78 genome-wide location data sets of 37 TFs where six other methods failed to
identify the motif specified in the literature for that TF
[20]. These six alternative methods were applied to sets of
sequences that were determined to be significantly
enriched for TF binding. Two of the six methods also
incorporated sequence conservation. In comparison, cREDUCE uses upstream sequences from the entire set of
genes AND incorporates conservation information. The
results for both c-REDUCE and f-REDUCE (degenerate
motifs but without conservation) are displayed in Tables
1 and 2. For 18 of the 37 transcription factors, c-REDUCE
identified the specified motif in at least one of the conditions, while f-REDUCE discovered the correct motif for 10
transcription factors. In many cases, both programs were
successful, but f-REDUCE often discovered a shorter or
more degenerate motif than c-REDUCE. Both programs
are not suitable for finding long motifs with dimer patterns. Therefore, some of the missed cases were for TFs
such as GAL80, with the motif CGGn(11)CCG.

The 37 transcription factor (TF) motifs not discovered by the methods applied in [20] are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Only exact matches to the motifs
(see Methods) are considered. The first and second columns list the transcription factor and known motif given in the Supplementary Table 3 file
from [20]. The third column lists the environmental conditions examined (YPD: Rich medium, HEAT: Elevated temperature, SM: Amino acid
starvation, H2O2Hi: Highly hyperoxic, H2O2Lo: Moderately hyperoxic, BUT14: Filamentation inducing, RAPA: Nutrient deprived and GAL:
Galatose medium). The fourth and fifth columns list the results for c-REDUCE and f-REDUCE respectively. For example, "1: ATTGGY 3.0" for
HAP2, indicates that the oligo ATTGGY was the first predicted oligo with a -log10(p-value) of 3.0 under the YPD condition. The degenerate
symbols are R = (A, G), Y = (C, T), M = (A, C), K = (G, T), S = (C, G), W = (A, T), B = (C, G, T), D = (A, G, T), H = (A, C, T), V = (A, C, G) and
N = (A, C, G, T).

We also ran c-REDUCE on the complete set of 81 TFs
given in [20]. We separated the complete set into the 44
TFs with motifs that were recovered by one of the programs applied by [20] (labeled "Recovered") and the 37
from above that were not recovered by any of their programs (labeled "Not-recovered") (See Additional File 1:
Supporting Table 1). While we were unable to find some
of the Recovered motifs, c-REDUCE, using exact matches,
performed much better on the Not-recovered set for a
total correct prediction rate of ~65% compared to ~54%
in Harbison et al. [20] (Table 3). We also relaxed our
matching criteria to allow for one mismatch or one shifted
match (1 MM/S). For example, in Harbison et al. [20],
although there was one mismatch, the predicted motif
"CACATGC" was considered a successful prediction for
the known INO2 motif "ATTTCACATC". We discovered
the motif "TCACATG", very similar to their predicted
"CACATGC", but because of the last position "G" it was
not considered an exact match. Therefore, relaxing our criteria to allow for one mismatch or one shifted position,
we were able to improve our correct prediction rate to
79% (Table 3).
Comparisons with other programs
We compared c-REDUCE with four other programs that
also use multiple species data for motif prediction on the
more difficult "Not-recovered" set from Harbison et al.
[20]. All methods we evaluated, Phylocon [21], Converge
[21], Phylogibbs [22] and Tree Gibbs Sampler [17,23], are
designed to be applied to orthologous sequences from a
subset of all genes. PhyloGibbs and Tree Gibbs Sampler
also incorporate the phylogenetic relationships among
the species into their search. Although sequence conservation is incorporated into these methods, they differ from
c-REDUCE in that they use a sequence set approach,
where only sequences with the most significant TF binding enrichment are used rather than all sequences.

In the PhyloGibbs program [22], there were a total of 21
TF data sets in the "Not-recovered" list where we could
compare our results and in those cases, both programs

made 16 correct predictions, although not always for the
same TF motif (Table 4, Additional File 1: Supporting
Table 2). In comparison to the method of Tree Gibbs Sampler [17,23], which was applied to a subset of the 15 "Notrecovered" TFs, c-REDUCE with 1 MM/S made more correct predictions and less false positive predictions (Table
4, Additional File 1: Supporting Table 3). Finally, for Converge and PhyloCon [21] results for almost all of the "Notrecovered" cases were reported in their "Additional File
2". c-REDUCE was able to correctly predict ~65% of the
motifs, while PhyloCon and Converge predicted ~26%
and ~41% respectively (Table 4, Additional File 1: Supporting Table 4). Only when their predictions were combined did these two programs have more similar accuracy
to c-REDUCE.
There are some caveats regarding the comparisons
between methods. We use reported successes by the
authors since motif predictions were not always provided
and the evaluation criteria, typically for predicted position
weight matrices, were usually quite different from those
for the c-REDUCE oligo predictions. For Tree Gibbs Sampler [17,23], we could make a more direct comparison
because the authors provided all consensus motifs for
their predictions and their reported evaluation criteria
could be used to compare the c-REDUCE oligos with the
known motif. However, the Tree Gibbs Sampler evaluation may be at a disadvantage to c-REDUCE because
degenerate symbols were not used to construct their consensus motifs. Because of this, the Tree Gibbs Sampler
incorrect predictions were manually checked with a more
relaxed criteria allowing for more mismatches, but the
results in Table 4 did not change.
Application to insect data
To investigate the performance of c-REDUCE on more
diverse species, we applied our method to insect data. To
predict the binding site motif for the Drosophila (fruit fly)
transcription factor Dorsal, we applied c-REDUCE to data
from a microarray study on Dorsal targets [24] and 5 kilobase upstream sequences from four insect species (See

Methods). Dorsal is important for the initiation of tissue
differentiation in the early embryo and many of its target
genes are sequence-specific transcription factors. The
experiment in [24] determined genome-wide expression
levels comparing mutant embryos that contain no Dorsal
protein (none) or uniformly high levels (high) or low levels (low) of Dorsal throughout the embryo. Known Dorsal binding sites are represented by the consensus
sequences GGGWWWWCCM or GGGWDWWWCCM
[25]. Table 5 summarizes the results of running cREDUCE on the Dorsal data. For all three comparisons
(high vs. none, high vs. low, low vs. none) the top predicted oligo matched the consensus Dorsal binding sites
using exact matches. REDUCE, without the conservation
information, was unable to predict this binding site,
although it did predict the motif ACCCC for high vs. none
(-log10 p-value = 3.15) and high vs. none (-log10 p-value =
4.71) but it is not an exact match to the known motif.

for the purpose of de novo motif finding, which is the focus
here.
c-REDUCE in its current form has some limitations. Some
transcription factors motifs were not predicted by cREDUCE, possibly due to dimer patterns that are not well
characterized by this method, weak evidence for this motif
in the literature, or low quality of the genome-wide location data. c-REDUCE is not well suited for finding very
degenerate motifs; we only allow 2 degenerate symbols
total. It is also not well suited for searching very long
motifs (> 10 base pairs) because of the small sample size
associated with matches to the longer motifs. c-REDUCE
also has some limitations in particular for higher eukaryotes. It requires global alignments of the sequences,
expects aligned binding sites within the global alignment,
and does not explicitly model cis-regulatory modules.
Despite these limitations, it was successfully applied to a
difficult insect data set.

Discussion
c-REDUCE is a straightforward adaptation of the REDUCE
software. It uses the same algorithm but requires consensus sequences from multi-species alignments and an initial enumeration of oligos to remove those that have more
than two degenerate symbols from the search process.
Because it takes advantage of the speed in REDUCE, it is
well suited for searching long sequences. In contrast, programs such as Tree Gibbs Sampler have been limited to
testing at most 1 kilobase regions. Recently, sequence conservation data was used to enhance MatrixREDUCE
[7,26], an adaptation of the REDUCE algorithm, but not

The yeast data set is a common benchmark test set and
consists of Saccharomyces sensu stricto species which are
only separated by ~20 MYA [27]. For a more challenging
prediction problem, we applied c-REDUCE to insect data
with species separated by ~250 MYA (between Drosophila
and mosquito) [28]. In higher eukaryotes, TFBS are often
dispersed in long intergenic regions so it is important to
consider a longer upstream sequence region. However,
TFBS are typically less than 20 base pairs, so increasing the
sequence search space decreases the signal to noise ratio
making the search problem more difficult. Despite these
challenges, c-REDUCE correctly predicted the Dorsal

Conclusion

Methods

c-REDUCE, which relies on sequence conservation and a
correlation-based strategy across all gene upstream
sequences, shows improved performance on a comprehensive genome-wide location dataset for yeast. Our comparisons to f-REDUCE, which does not use sequence
conservation, and to several other programs that use conservation but only on sequences from gene subsets, indicate that the combination of these two approaches yields
more predictive power. c-REDUCE can be used to find
degenerate motifs but instead of relying on exhaustive
searches with degenerate symbols, which can quickly
become intractable, it limits the search by taking advantage of evolutionary information and discounts false

Yeast Data
Genome-wide location analysis results of 203 transcription factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under several environmental conditions were taken from Harbison et al.
[20]. For each experiment, there is a transcription factor
binding enrichment value for ~5000 gene promoters. For
each gene promoter, orthologs from five yeast species (S.
cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii and S.
bayanus) were obtained from [11,12] and aligned using
ClustalW [29]. The average alignment length is ~800 base
pairs.

Insect Data
Expression data to identify Dorsal targets using the
Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome Array
DrosGenome1 [30] were obtained from GEO ([31]http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) with GEO identifier Series
GSE86. We obtained a four species insect genome alignment from UCSC Genome Browser (Jan. 2003 [32]http://
genome.ucsc.edu/). The alignment contained three Drosophila species, D. melanogaster (BDGP Release 3), D.
yakuba (WUSTL Release 1.0), and D. pseudoobscura (HGSC
Freeze 1), and mosquito Anopheles gambiae (Release IAGP
v.MOZ2). The alignments provided by UCSC are separated into blocks, which we concatenated by the symbol
"N". A 5000 base upstream region for each gene listed in
FlyBase (BDGP Release 3 [33]http://flybase.bio.indi
ana.edu/) was extracted from the alignment with overlapping regions from upstream genes removed. The array
consists of 12,782 probes for annotated genes, of which
10,572 have upstream sequence alignments greater than
100 base pairs.

Consensus Sequence
We created a consensus sequence for multiple species
alignments using the following procedure. At each position, one of the IUPAC symbols for the four bases (A, C,
G, T) or degenerate symbols representing multiple bases
(e.g., W = A or T), is used for the observed nucleotides (see
examples in Table 6, positions 1 and 2). If less than half
of the sequences have "N"s or gaps ("-"), we ignore those
symbols. But if the majority of symbols at a position are
"N"s, "-"'s or both, we use "N", "-" or "-" respectively
(positions 3–5) For some sequences, if a "N' or gap
appears and there are only two sequences in the alignment including the reference genome S. cerevisiae (or D.
melanogaster), we use the symbol observed in S. cerevisiae
(or D. melanogaster) (Position 6–7).

c-REDUCE results were obtained by running the REDUCE
program, provided by the authors [4], on the multiple
species consensus sequences. The program evaluates all
oligos, including those with degenerate symbols (in cREDUCE), for significant correlation across all genes
between the counts of the oligo in a gene promoter and
the experimental values (e.g., gene expression or TF binding enrichment) for that gene. We examine oligos 5–7
base pairs long for both c-REDUCE and f-REDUCE.
Because of the large number of oligos with degenerate
symbols, we only test oligos with at least 10 counts and at
most two degenerate symbols in c-REDUCE. Methods for
finding multiple oligos and for determining statistical significance are described in [4]. Any oligos with gaps due to
the alignment were not considered in the analysis.
For oligos with degenerate symbols in c-REDUCE, we considered two options for degenerate oligo counting in our
sequences illustrated by the following examples: 1) "W" is
counted only when "A" or "T" are in the global alignment;
2) "W" is counted when "A", "T" or "W" are in the global
alignment. We did not consider a third option of "W"

Sequences (rows) are from the yeast species, S. cerevisiae (Scer), S.

being counted when "D", and "H" are in the global alignment, since "W" would only characterize a subset of the
observed nucleotides. However, in #2, "D" is counted
when "A", "T", "G", "K", "R", "W", or "D" occur. We found
that option #2, although intuitively more correct, was
much slower on the yeast data and did not dramatically
improve the results based on option #1.
f-REDUCE results were provided by the authors [19]. To
make a fair comparison, f-REDUCE was applied with the
same oligo options as c-REDUCE (5–7 length oligos and
allowing for 2 and 3-fold degenerate symbols). Although
these options are different than the options reported in
[19] and produced different predictions in some cases, the
results in Tables 1 and 2 and "Supplementary Table 1"
from [19] are still consistent qualitatively.
Motif Evaluation
We took the top 5 significant oligos positively correlated
with transcription factor enrichment or expression from cREDUCE and f-REDUCE based on a forward selection
process (p-value < .01). Then, using a script written in perl
we compared these oligos with the consensus motif (and
its reverse complement) found in the literature [17,2022,25] for each TF. Degenerate IUPAC symbols are
expanded for matching. For example, the predicted oligo
YCAAD would be considered a match to the HAP3 motif
(CCAAT/ATTGG) since it can be expanded into the oligos
which include CCAAT. If there was no exact match to one
of the top 5 predicted oligos, we then considered at most
1 mis-match (e.g., the predicted oligo TCACATG matches
the motif ATTTCACATC) or one shifted position (e.g., the
predicted oligo RCATTC is shifted one position from the
motif CATTCY). When comparing an oligo with a motif at
a position where both have a degenerate symbol, we
checked if there are any nucleotide overlaps. For example,
the predicted oligo SAATA would match the motif for
YOX1 YAATA because S = (C, G) and Y = (C, T) overlap at
the C nucleotide.
Comparison with Other Software
We compared c-REDUCE predicted oligos with the list of
motifs for 81 TFs in "Supplementary Table 3" from Harbison et al. 2004 [20], list of 35 "Not-recovered" motifs (see
definition above) in MacIsaac et al., 2006 [21] (Converge/
PhyloCon), list of 15 "Not-recovered" motifs in Li and
Wong, 2005 [17] (Tree Gibbs Sampler) and list of 21
"Not-recovered" motifs in Siddharthan et al., 2005 [22]
(PhyloGibbs).

MacIsaac et al., 2006 [21] and Li and Wong, 2005 [17]
only use a 4 species alignment. Therefore, to compare
with these methods we removed S. kudriavzevii and S. paradoxus respectively to construct our consensus sequence.
For comparison with Li and Wong, 2005 [17], we used the

curated list of "Not-recovered" motifs found in "Supporting Table 4" of their paper and their definition of a match:
"The criterion for matching with TRANSFAC motifs is that
there should be at most one mismatch in the orange
regions. Those orange regions must be continuous except
the ambiguous positions ... The length of the orange parts
must be at least 6 unless the motif is shorter than 6." For
comparison with PhyloGibbs [22], we used the "Notrecovered" TFs listed in their "Table 1" and the motifs they
extracted
from
http://fraenkel.mit.edu/Harbison/
release_v24/final_set/. For comparison with MacIsaac et
al. 2006 [21], we used the "Not-recovered" TFs and corresponding motifs from their "Additional File 2".
