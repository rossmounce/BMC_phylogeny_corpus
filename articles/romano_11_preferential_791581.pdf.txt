Preferential expression of human endogenous
retrovirus K (HERV-K/HML-2) type 1 in tumor cells

Human endogenous retroviruses of the K family (HERV-K)
are among the most recently integrated retroviruses in the
primate genome. HERV-K(HML-2) is classified in Type 1
that encodes a nonstructural protein Np9 and Type 2 that
encodes the accessory protein Rec. Both proteins have
been detected in tumors and transformed cell in different
levels, and there are evidences that they play a role in cancer development. HERV-K mRNA has also been detected
in normal tissues, but its expression is remarkably
enhanced in HIV-1 infected patients. Here, we performed
an in silico analysis to describe which HERV-K(HML-2)
proviruses contribute to transcripts detected in normal tissues, tumor tissues and HIV-1 infected patients. Proviral
transcripts from distinct sources (downloaded from GenBank) were subjected to phylogenetic reconstructions
together with fifty-five complete HERV-K genomes. Overall, most of the proviruses that did match to transcripts
integrated in the host genome between 0 and 7.6 million
years ago. A positive relation between proviral activity and
integrity of the upstream promoter and GC boxes (putative
sites for Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors) in the 5’ LTR
was also noticed. Interesting, while no significant relation
was observed between the type of the proviruses and the
ability to be transcribed in HIV carriers and normal tissues,
80% of the active proviruses from cancer tissues were type
1 HERV-K. Our results not only describe which proviruses
are more active in normal and pathological conditions but
also suggest a selective transactivation in tumor cells, supporting the tissue specificity of HERV-K LTR activity.
