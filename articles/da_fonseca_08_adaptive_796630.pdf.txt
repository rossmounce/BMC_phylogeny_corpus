Abstract
Background: The mitochondria produce up to 95% of a eukaryotic cell's energy through oxidative
phosphorylation. The proteins involved in this vital process are under high functional constraints.
However, metabolic requirements vary across species, potentially modifying selective pressures.
We evaluate the adaptive evolution of 12 protein-coding mitochondrial genes in 41 placental
mammalian species by assessing amino acid sequence variation and exploring the functional
implications of observed variation in secondary and tertiary protein structures.
Results: Wide variation in the properties of amino acids were observed at functionally important
regions of cytochrome b in species with more-specialized metabolic requirements (such as
adaptation to low energy diet or large body size, such as in elephant, dugong, sloth, and pangolin,
and adaptation to unusual oxygen requirements, for example diving in cetaceans, flying in bats, and
living at high altitudes in alpacas). Signatures of adaptive variation in the NADH dehydrogenase
complex were restricted to the loop regions of the transmembrane units which likely function as
protons pumps. Evidence of adaptive variation in the cytochrome c oxidase complex was observed
mostly at the interface between the mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits, perhaps evidence
of co-evolution. The ATP8 subunit, which has an important role in the assembly of F0, exhibited
the highest signal of adaptive variation. ATP6, which has an essential role in rotor performance,
showed a high adaptive variation in predicted loop areas.
Conclusion: Our study provides insight into the adaptive evolution of the mtDNA genome in
mammals and its implications for the molecular mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation. We
present a framework for future experimental characterization of the impact of specific mutations
in the function, physiology, and interactions of the mtDNA encoded proteins involved in oxidative
phosphorylation.

Background
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has long been treated as an
ideal marker because of its convenience for reconstruction
of gene genealogy and population history inference. However, the selective neutrality assumption of the mtDNA is
simplistic because variation in mitochondrial proteincoding genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation
(responsible for the production of up to 95% of the
energy of eukaryotic cells) can directly influence metabolic performance. Because of the importance of this biochemical pathway, evaluating selective pressures acting on
mtDNA proteins could provide key insight into the adaptive evolution of the mtDNA genome as has been suggested by recent empirical evidence (e.g. Ruiz-Pesini et al.
2004 [1], Moyer et al. 2005 [2], Bazin et al. 2006 [3]). As
amino acid changes cause inefficiencies in the electron
transfer chain system, oxidative phosphorylation produces reactive oxygen molecules, causing oxidative damage to mitochondrial and cellular proteins, lipids and
nucleic acids, and eventually interrupting the production
of mitochondrial energy.
Mutations in mitochondrial-encoded genes can influence
the production of reactive oxygen species in mice [4] and
have been implicated in a large number of human and

mouse diseases [5]. Some amino acid changes may also
improve aerobic capacity and adaptation to new thermal
environments [6-11]. Furthermore, mutations in mitochondrial genes have been implicated in exercise intolerance in humans [12] (see Table 1). Metabolic capacity
varies widely among mammalian species [13], and variation in the elements of the oxidative phosphorylation
pathway have been linked to different life history traits
and environmental adaptations [14-16]. In addition,
functional interactions between mitochondrial- and
nuclear-encoded proteins may result in co-adaptation to
maintain or improve metabolic fitness [9,17].
The mtDNA comprises a closed circular DNA strand that
encodes the following proteins involved in the oxidative
phosphorylation machinery: seven subunits of the NADH
dehydrogenase or NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase
complex (ND: ND1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, 5 and 6), the cytochrome
b subunit of the ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase
or cytochrome bc1 complex (CytB), three subunits of the
cytochrome c oxidase complex (COX), and two subunits
of ATP synthase (ATPase: ATP6 and ATP8) [18] (Figure
1A). These key components of four of the five complexes
involved in oxidative phosphorylation, combine with
other subunits encoded by the nuclear DNA genome [18]

The mammalian mitochondrial genome and its protein-coding gene repertoire involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathFigure 1
way
The mammalian mitochondrial genome and its protein-coding gene repertoire involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. (A) Schematic representation of genes within mammalian mitochondrial genome (~7,000 bp). Genes
on the outer circle are transcribed from the light-strand. Location of the tRNAs (red boxes) conform to the canonical placental mammalian arrangement. Abbreviations: HSP, putative heavy-strand promoter; OHR, origin of heavy-strand replication;
OLR, origin of light-strand replication. (B) Simplified view of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Complexes I (NADH dehydrogenase) and II (succinate dehydrogenase) receive electrons from either NADH or FADH2. Electrons
are then carried between complexes by the carrier molecules coenzyme Q/ubiquinone (UQ) and cytochrome c (CYC). The
potential energy of these electron transfer events is used to pump protons against the gradient, from the mitochondrial matrix
into the intermembrane space [Complexes I and III (cytochrome bc1) and IV (cytochrome c oxidase)]. ATP synthesis by Complex V (ATP synthase) is driven by the proton gradient, and occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. MM: mitochondria matrix; IM:
intermembrane space.
(Figure 1B). In the oxidative phosphorylation, reducing
equivalents resulting from the oxidation of nutrients such
as glucose, are carried by a series of molecules (the electron transport chain), which have increasing standard
reduction potentials. The resulting free energy is transformed into a proton gradient that is used by ATP synthase to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP
(adenosine diphosphate) [18].

species (Table 2) from each of the four major clades of the
placental mammals. Since most of the cell's ATP production results from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, we also use estimates of metabolic rates based on
oxygen (O2) consumption under aerobic conditions as a
surrogate for physiological or metabolic differences
among the species in our analyses.

Results and Discussion
Although mtDNA sequence data have been extensively
used in mammalian phylogenetics [19-24], relatively little
attention has been devoted to the study of molecular
adaptation of mitochondrial encoded proteins. In this
work we combine molecular evolution analyses with crystallographic and secondary structure prediction analyses
to explore how mitochondrial genetic variation may be
linked to the diverse metabolic patterns of 41 mammalian

The mitogenomic phylogenetic reconstruction (Figure 2)
obtained with Bayesian inference methods [25,26] is
mostly congruent with previous comprehensive analyses
from nuclear and mtDNA genes [27] where mammalian
species form four major groups: Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires, Xenarthra, and Afrotheria. The superordinal tree
is resolved with posterior probabilities greater than 0.99.
The relative positioning of the orders is in agreement with

that obtained using Maximum Likelihood [see Additional
file 1, Fig. S2], supporting the previous topology.
Significant physicochemical amino acid changes among
residues in mitochondrial protein coding genes were
identified by the algorithm implemented in TreeSAAP
[28], which compares the observed distribution of physicochemical changes inferred from a phylogenetic tree
with an expected distribution based on the assumption of
completely random amino acid replacement expected
under the condition of selective neutrality (see details in
the Methods section). There are more modifications in the
number of radical amino acid property changes in the tips
(80%) relative to the interior branches (20%) of the mammalian tree (Figure 3). The interior branches with the
highest number of radical amino acid property changes
are those that lead to the house mouse and the rat (node
78 to 80; a total of 55 changes across all proteins), the
branch leading to the elephant shrews (node 45 to 46; 43
changes across all proteins), the branch leading to the
guinea pig and the greater cane rat (node 78 to 79; 21
changes across all proteins), and the branch uniting the
humpback whale and white-beaked dolphin (node 64 to
65; 17 changes across all proteins). There was an average
of 10 changes per interior branch. The proteins with the
highest average number of changing properties per site are
ND and ATPase (0.7 and 0.8 average changes per site,
respectively), while CytB and COX were the lowest (0.3
and 0.2 changes per site, respectively) (Figure 4). Noteworthy, a distinction arises between loop areas and transmembrane domains for all proteins complexes. Loop
areas are, in general, more affected by positive selection
than transmembrane domains (0.52 property changes
showing strong positive selection per site vs 0.39 for the
latter).
Amino acid properties with signals of strong positive
selection accumulated at a rate roughly equivalent to the
mutation rate of the gene itself (i.e. mutation rate of ATP
> ND > CytB > COX; see Lopez et al. 1997 [29]) (Figure 5;
[see Additional file 1, Fig. S3]). This correlation is more
pronounced for the protein-coding genes with higher
mutation rates, such as ATPase and ND, as is most apparent in analyses of the variation along the interior
branches, where 20% of the radical amino acid property
changes occur [see Additional file 1, Fig. S3]. The best correlation between overall mutation rate and number of
sites with radical amino acid changes was observed for
NDs, while the existence of several outliers for ATPase
slightly reduced the strength of the correlation [see Additional file 1, Fig. S3].
The biochemical complexity of the oxidative phosphorylation processes precludes a clear discussion on the functional implications of the amino acid properties that are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/119

under selection (Figures 6 and 7). Negative selection dominates the categories of radical changes. Moderate changes
(categories 1 and 2) characterize most of the positive
selection detected. Properties under positive destabilizing
selection (the power to be at the N-terminal, refractive
index, long-range non-bonded energy, coil tendencies,
compressibility, turn tendencies and the power to be at
the C-terminal) will interfere both at a chemical and structural level. However, since we are considering events as
diverse as protein-protein interactions, molecular oxygen
and proton diffusion and electron-transfer, it is not possible to establish a direct correlation with the previously
referred properties. Discussion on varying amino acid
properties will therefore be made specifically for those
sites which can be mapped on available structural data.

strong positively selected changes in amino acid properties are within ND2, ND4 and ND5 [see Additional file 1,
Fig. S4]. These subunits show a high average in the
number of such changes per residue (1.1, 0.6 and 0.8,
respectively, for an overall average of 0.5) (Figure 4).
NADH dehydrogenase is the first (Figure 1B) and the largest enzyme complex in the respiratory chain. It receives
electrons from the oxidation of NADH and provides electrons for reduction of quinone to quinol. This is coupled
to the translocation of four protons across the inner membrane, generating an electrochemical proton gradient
(Figure 1B). Complex I is an L-shaped complex (as shown
in low resolution electron microscopy analysis [30]) that
contains all seven mtDNA encoded subunits in a membrane-embedded arm. The subunits of the "peripheral
arm" (that projects into the mitochondrial matrix) are
encoded by the nuclear DNA genome. Forty-six different
units have been identified in complex I from bovine heart
mitochondria [31], although the 14 bacterial subunits are
the minimum needed for sufficient energy transduction
by complex I [32]. The electron transfer chain events occur
in the peripheral arm subunits and the proton pumping
occurs in the membrane-embedded module. ND1 and
ND2 have been suggested to be located at the junction
between the peripheral and the membrane arm [32],
while ND4 and ND5 should occur at the distal end of the
latter [31]. ND2, ND4, and ND5 are suggested to be the
actual proton pumping devices because of their sequence
homology with a class of Na+/H+ antiporters [32]. The
overall variation in these subunits, which have already
been assigned some function, is larger than the observed
variation in the subunits with still unknown functions.
Mutations in these subunits may interfere with the efficiency of the proton-pumping process. This could either
occur through chemical changes that hinder/improve the
proton translocation or by disrupting/improving the
long-range redox-linked conformational changes that are

higher variation (20 < number of changes < 110) are
located only in the loop regions, suggesting that functional constraints are acting upon the TM domains, which
would be consistent with their putative proton-pumping
function.

Cytochrome b
CytB is an extremely conserved protein, reflecting its fundamental role in energy production in the mitochondria.
It catalyses reversible electron transfer from ubiquinol to
cytochrome c coupled to proton translocation (Q-cycle
[34,35]). A quinol molecule at the Q0 site donates an electron to cytochrome c via the iron-sulfur protein (ISP) and
cytochrome c1 (Figure 9). A second electron passes
sequentially through the bL and bH heme ending up in a
quinone/semiquinone radical at the Qi site. In a complete
Q cycle, two quinol molecules are the Q0 site and one
molecule of quinol is regenerated while four protons are
translocated across the membrane. Available x-ray data
showing cytochrome bc1 inhibitors bound to both Qi and
Q0 sites suggest that these mutations have functional consequences. The high degree of conservation among CytB
sequences (Figure 4) made it difficult to find evidence of

mutation originated less than 24 million years ago, after
the divergence of the American mastodon from the other
four proboscidean species analyzed [36] [see Additional
file 1, Fig. S5]). At the N-terminal site 16, adjacent to the
Qi pocket, there is a positively charged residue (lysine)
that will affect the binding of ligands at this site (Figure 9).
Residues 260 and 266 are located in loop ef, which contributes to the formation of the ISP binding crater.
Changes in shape complementarity between the ISP and
CytB have been shown to be important for the control
mechanism of ISP conformational change, an important
feature of cytochrome bc1 mechanism [37]. The aspartate
on position 260, a conserved asparagine spot (Figure 10),
may affect both the interaction with the ISP (protein recognition event) and other electron transfer events, as it
adds an extra negative charge to this interface (Figure 9).
Also on loop ef, the shift from the conserved proline on
site 266 to a leucine will alter the rigidity of the secondary
structure, with implications in the protein-protein interface contacts (Figure 9).

positive selection using TreeSAAP. Sites detected by TreeSAAP were mainly located at the interface between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits (Figure 9).
However, insight into the evolution of this protein was
obtained by inspection of the amino acid substitutions
observed in the sequence alignment of the various mammalian species.
The African savanna elephant Loxodonta Africana has two
atypical amino acid replacements at positions 16 and 260
(Figure 10) that are conserved in other members of the
Elephantidae family (the African forest elephant Loxodonta
cyclotis, the Asian elephant Elephas maximus, and both the
extinct woolly mammoth Mammuthus primigenius and the
American mastodon Mammut americanum; [see Additional file 1, Fig. S5]). Another uncommon amino acid
occurs in most of the Elephantidae group at position 266,
but not in the American mastodon, suggesting that this

The cetaceans have an alanine in position 266 (Figure 10),
which will have a similar consequence to that referred
above. The biochemistry involved in aquatic mammals is
still a matter of debate, but it has been found that mitochondria of seals can survive ischemia for much longer
than terrestrial mammals [38], suggesting changes in
function or regulation. The humpback whale has another
interesting mutation. An arginine in site 110 (Figure 10)
changes the local net charge, and being located just outside the coordination sphere of heme bH, such a difference
can interfere with the electron transfer events (Figure 9).
Such alteration is also seen in two of the Chiroptera species, the Ryukyu flying fox and the New Zealand longtailed bat (Figure 11). Curiously, the sloth, one of the
mammals showing a lower metabolic rate than expected
given its body size [14], has a positively charged residue
on site 111 (a lysine instead of the highly conserved glutamate), a yet more radical change in net electric charge at
this location (Figure 10).
Another region that shows radical amino acid variation is
helix cd2, close to the hinge region of ISP (Figure 9).
Mutations in the hinge region were shown to have drastic
consequences in the catalytic activity of ISP, by hindering
the conformational changes that are required for cytochrome bc1 function [39]. Two species have a proline residue on site 158: the greater cane rat, a rodent with spiny
fur on the back, and the pangolin, the scaly-anteater,
which has a low metabolic rate because of the combination of an invertebrate diet and a large body size [14]. Sites
16, 159, 162 and 263 show an elevated number of amino
acid changes (Figure 10), suggestive of adaptive relevance
in many mammalian species. Site 277 presents a highly
conserved alanine residue. It is placed in the middle of

helix F1, within the Q0 pocket (Figure 9). Two peculiar
species (dugong and alpaca) with distinct metabolic
requirements show very radical amino acid changes at this
site. The dugong is an aquatic mammal that is more
closely related to elephants than to other marine mammals [40]. It is sometimes referred to as a sea cow because
of its strict sea-grass diet, combining several interesting
features from the metabolic point of view: a large body
size, a low energy diet and aquatic environment adaptation. It has an arginine residue in position 277, which will
not only cause extra steric hindrance because of the size of
the side chain relative to alanine (in Figure 9 the van der
Waals surface of an arginine side chain is presented; it
clearly overlaps the stigmatellin binding position), but
will also change the binding mode of the ligand, as it is
positively charged. Finally, an important change was
detected in the alpaca, a domesticated breed of South
American camel-like ungulates that lives at an altitude of
3500 to 5000 meters above sea-level presenting metabolic
adaptations to the low O2 environment [41]. This species
has a proline at site 277, which will drastically alter the
local secondary structure, disrupting the alpha helix and
therefore changing the shape of the Q0 pocket. Such a
mutation is not present in the closest relatives of the
alpaca [see Additional file 1, Fig. S5]. Curiously, the Old
World members of the Camelidae family (the dromedary
Camelus dromedarius and the bactrian camel C. bactrianus)
have an aspartate in position 16, instead of the asparagine
exhibited by the four species that inhabit South America
(alpaca Lama pacos, guanaco L. guanicoe, llama L. glama,
and vicuna Vicugna vicugna) [see Additional file 1, Fig. S5].

Several mutations in human CytB have been related to
exercise intolerance [12] (Table 1; Figure 9), all of which
have similar chemical effects including a change in the net
charge around the heme groups and in the binding pockets and disruption of local secondary structures close to
the substrate binding areas.
Cytochrome c Oxidase
Complex IV is the terminal electron transfer chain complex that catalyses the electron oxidations of four consecutive reduced cytochrome c molecules and the
concomitant reduction of one O2 molecule to water [42].
COXI and II subunits are directly involved in the electron
transfer and proton translocation processes, while the
other 11 subunits are thought to have regulatory roles.
Results obtained with TreeSAAP were mapped on an available 3D structure for COX (Figure 11). COXI and II are the
most conserved of all the 12 subunits analyzed (Figure 3;
Figure 4; [see Additional file 1, Fig. S4]). Recent studies on
taxa that had clearly experienced significant changes in
their metabolic needs detected positive selection acting in
COXI and COXII, namely in carnivorous plants [7] and in
high-performance fish [6]. As demonstrated in high-performance fish COXII subunits, the highly variable sites in
mammals are located at the interface between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits (Table 3), suggesting
either an unknown biological role or the occurrence of
compensatory mutations in the nuclear subunits (co-evolution). The known functional spots in the complex were
found to be very conserved, namely the portion of COXII
directly involved in the electron transfer from cytochrome

enter the assembly via subunit a (corresponding to ATP6
in yeast [49]). One proton binds between two c subunits
(corresponding to ATP9 subunits in yeast [49]). In order
for the proton to reach the exit channel, the c subunits (in
a total of 10 in E. coli), that are arranged as a cylinder, have
to rotate, releasing the proton after 10 steps of proton
binding. This rotation movement involves the γ and ε subunits, that remain fixed to the top of one set of c subunits.
The rotation of γ within the α/β subunits induces conformational changes that release ATP from the alternating
catalytic cycles. The ε subunit (homologous to mitochondrial subunit δ and IF1 regulatory protein) is responsible
for determining whether complex V acts as a synthase or
catalyses the reverse reaction (pumping protons from the
cytoplasm/matrix to the periplasm/intermembrane
space) at the expenses of ATP hydrolysis. Subunits b and δ
(equivalent to mitochondrial OSCP) keep the α/β subunits in a fixed position. The conservation of ATP6 reflects
its key role in the coupling of the proton flow with the
rotation of the c subunits: as for the ND complex, the sites
with higher variation are located only in the predicted
loop regions (Figure 12B).

isms [45]. Some other interesting changes in COX
included the K216E mutation (charge inversion) in COXII
observed only in cetaceans, and Y182H in COXIII only
seen in the hippopotamus and the dugong (Figure 11).
Site 185 in COXIII shows a big variation in amino acid
type across all species. Finally, the mutation M29K in
COXII has been shown to cause exercise intolerance in
humans (Table 1; Figure 11).
ATP synthase
The proton-gradient that results from H+ pumping into
the intermembrane space, is used by ATPase to synthesize
ATP. The proton channel is located in the membrane sector (F0) which is connected to the catalytic component
(F1), located on the matrix side of the membrane (Figure
12A). The latter, when separated from the membrane,
behaves as a soluble ATPase. Large cooperative conformational changes occur in order to couple the passage of protons through the membrane arm and the production of
ATP [47,48]. In the proposed mechanism for E. coli
ATPase, protons that have accumulated in the periplasm

The ATP8 gene encodes a core subunit of the F0 component of ATPase. In its absence, the ATPase in yeast contains no ATP6 subunit, which suggests an important role
in the assembly of F0 [50]. Nevertheless, ATP8 subunit has
some highly variable sites (Figure 12B), presenting the
higher average of radically changing amino acid properties per residue, suggesting some variation of its regulatory
role across species.
Oxidative phosphorylation vs metabolic rates
Some mutations in mitochondrial genes are responsible
for severe phenotypic effects related to metabolic capacity,
such as exercise intolerance in humans [11] (see Table 1).
However, the scaling of metabolic rates in relation to the
ATP yield through oxidative phosphorylation is not
straightforward, as the total metabolic rate is influenced
by multiple characteristics varying across species. The scaling of metabolic rates by body size has been discussed for
more than a century [13] and remains controversial
[13,51-54], although generally metabolic rate increases as
body mass increases (see this trend in our dataset: Figure
13 and Table 2). However, there are numerous exceptions
such as for large tropical ant and termite predators (e.g.
the sloth, the aardvark, some pangolins, tamanduas and
armadillos), for which basal rate of metabolism decreases
when their size increases [14]. Furthermore, variation in
size is accompanied by changes in the metabolic rates
inherent to cells (in vitro studies showed that these
decline with increasing body mass; [55]). Some of the
approaches to scale the whole body basal metabolic rate
take into account the scaling of individual organ masses
and metabolic rates [56]. However, variation can occur in

the activity of oxidative enzymes, such as in the case of
acclimatization to altitude by lamas and alpacas [41].
The variation between the metabolic rates in different species is a consequence of multiple factors, including the
need to maintain body temperature, the number of mitochondria and the volume densities and/or cristae surface,
and the fact that relative organ mass and organ metabolite
rate varies interspecifically. For example, in reptiles, the
lower metabolic rates, compared to mammals, are due to
a combination of smaller internal organs, lower mitochondrial volume and cristae surface densities [55].
The scaling of metabolic rates is thus an intricate issue,
and even recent multiple-cause models [52] are flawed
[57]. Adding to the complexity of interspecies metabolic
rates analysis is the random accumulation of variation in
the coding sequences of proteins directly involved in
energy production and differential selective pressures that
arise as mutations affecting mitochondrial ATP production.

Conclusion
We present a mammalian phylogeny based on variation
in protein-coding mtDNA genes among 41 representative
species. Sequence analyses were complemented with

functional analyses to assess the potential importance of
mutations leading to radical changes in the physicochemical properties of the amino acids. Most of the mtDNA

their vital role in oxidative phosphorylation. However,
much of the observed variation had plausible adaptive
significance.

ferent base composition from the heavy-chain [58]. Gaps
and ambiguous sites adjacent to gaps were removed,
resulting in a total alignment of 10,587 nucleotides
(3,529 amino acids). The third codon position was
excluded from the phylogenetic analysis (7,058 nucleotides were used) because of observed nucleotide saturation [see Additional file 1, Fig. S1].

The ND2, ND4, and ND5 complex I genes showed higher
than average adaptive variation, with all of the variable
sites located in the assessed loop regions of these putative
protons pumps (3D structural data are needed to further
confirm these interpretations and to measure the functional implications).

Bayesian inference methods with Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling were used in MrBayes [25,26] to
assess phylogenetic relationships among the species. We
used a General-Time-Reversible substitution model [59]
with the invariant site plus gamma options (five categories) after determining the optimal model of sequence
substitution with MrModeltest 2.2 [60]. One cold and
four incrementally heated chains were run for 2,000,000
generations with chains I = 2, 3, 4, and 5 incrementally
heated with heat being 1/(1+ [i-1]T) and T = 0.2. Trees
were sampled every 100 generations from the last
1,000,000 generated (well after the chain reached stationarity) and 10,000 trees were used for inferring Bayesian
posterior probability. The burn-in fraction performance
was evaluated using the program Tracer v1.4 http://
tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/. Bayesian methods have
been successfully applied to estimation of the tree topology of placental animals using both mitochondrial and
nuclear data [27]. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic
tree was constructed in PAUP 4.0b10 [61] after determining the optimal model of sequence substitution
(TVM+I+G) with Modeltest 3.04 [62].

The available high resolution 3D structure of CytB facilitated interpretation of the functional implications of
mutations occurring at portions of the protein which
resulted in extreme amino acid properties variation in species with peculiar metabolic requirements (such as adaptation to low energy diet vs large body size, namely in
elephant, dugong, sloth, and pangolin; and adaptation to
extreme O2 requirements, i.e. diving in cetaceans, flying in
bats, and high altitudes resistance in alpacas). The adaptive variation in COX was restricted mostly to the interface
between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits,
suggesting either co-evolution or some influence in the
regulatory role of the latter. Among the ATPase subunits,
ATP8 which has an important role in the assembly of F0,
showed the highest amount of adaptive variation in this
analysis. ATP6, which has an essential role in the ATPase
rotor performance, showed a high adaptive variation in
predicted loop areas. Interpretation of possible functional
roles of these changes is limited, however, by the lack of
experimental and structural data for these genes.
Our study provides insight into the adaptive evolution of
the mtDNA genome in mammals, which may have facilitated the successful radiation and diversification of mammalian species into different environments and habits.
The evidence of positive selection acting in important
functional regions of the various mammalian mtDNA
proteins provides the framework for future experimental
characterization of the impact of specific mutations in the
function, physiology, and interactions of the mtDNA
encoded proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation.

Methods
Phylogenetic analyses
A mammalian mitogenomic phylogeny was constructed
using 12 of the 13 protein-coding genes of the mtDNA
genome of 41 species representative of all mammalian
orders (Table 2). The ND6 gene was excluded because it is
encoded by the light-strand which has a significantly dif-

Adaptive evolution analyses
Selection in protein-coding genes is generally assessed by
estimating ω, the ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) [63]. However, this
statistical approach for detecting molecular adaptation is
largely biased against even moderately conservative proteins as it does not allow the possibility that adaptation
may come in the form of very few amino acid changes.
Thus, significant physicochemical amino acid changes
among residues in mitochondrial protein coding genes
were identified by the algorithm implemented in TreeSAAP [28], which compares the observed distribution of
physicochemical changes inferred from a phylogenetic
tree with an expected distribution based on the assumption of completely random amino acid replacement
expected under the condition of selective neutrality. The
evaluation of the magnitude of property change at nonsynonymous residues and their location on a protein 3Dstrcuture may provide important insight into the structural and functional consequences of the substitutions
[64]. Eight magnitude categories (1 to 8) represent onestep nucleotide changes in a codon and rank the correspondent variation in a property scale of the coded amino
acid. Categories 1 to 3 indicate small variation in the

Basal metabolic rate vs log10 (body mass). The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is presented in three categories (low, intermediate and high). When the BMR value was not available for the species in study, either that of a close relative (indicated in

mass value). The increase in BMR with the body mass can be easily observed by comparing the average values for each category

amino acid characteristics while categories 6 to 8 represent the most radical substitutions. By accounting for the
property changes across the data set, a set of relative frequencies changes for each category is obtained allowing to
test the null hypothesis under the assumption of neutral
conditions [65]. The categories for which the observed
numbers of amino acid replacements in the data set is significantly different from the null model (z-scores > 1.645;
P < 0.05) are considered as being potentially affected by
selective pressures [65]. Here we focus on amino acid differences that correspond to radical physicochemical variation (positive-destabilizing selection) and are expected
to be linked with significant changes in function. Tree-

SAAP categorizes each amino acid site by positive and
negatively destabilizing using 31 properties (henceforth
amino acid positions will be referred as sites). To detect
strong directional selective pressure, only changes corresponding to categories 7 and 8 (the 2 most radical property changes categories) at the P ≤ 0.001 level were
considered. The total number of changes per site is the
sum of those occurring in each branch of the phylogeny.
The number of changes in amino acid properties was
standardized relatively to the overall size of the protein
when comparing different complexes (weight factor =
total number of amino acids in the complex/total number

of amino acids in ATPase, which is the smallest protein
complex).
Protein structure analyses
The functional relevance of the amino acid mutations was
discussed in the context of existing three-dimensional
(3D) structures of mtDNA encoded proteins (CytB
[PDB:1PPJ] [66]; COX [PDB:1V54] [67]). For those proteins with unknown 3D structures (ND and ATPase),
topologies for transmembrane (TM) subunits were predicted using hidden Markov model (HMM) based servers
for topology prediction of transmembrane proteins [6871]. The algorithm used by the program PRODIVTMHMM [70] has proven to be very reliable at predicting
3D topologies as it incorporates evolutionary information
from multiple sequence alignments and assigns amino
acid residues to different TM regions according to their
properties. However, since even homologous sequences
from the same protein family can have inverted topologies [72], some caution is necessary when using topologies predicted by these automated approaches. We have
therefore delineated putative TM domains by integrating
the results from PRODIV-TMHMM with two other reliable HMM based methods [73], TMHMM [68,69] and
HMMTOP [71]. Graphic representations of the 3D structures were created with the program VMD [74].
