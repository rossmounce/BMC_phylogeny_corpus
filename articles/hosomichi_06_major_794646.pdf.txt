Abstract
Background: The quail and chicken major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) genomic regions have a similar overall
organization but differ markedly in that the quail has an expanded number of duplicated class I, class IIB, natural killer
(NK)-receptor-like, lectin-like and BG genes. Therefore, the elucidation of genetic factors that contribute to the greater
Mhc diversity in the quail would help to establish it as a model experimental animal in the investigation of avian Mhc
associated diseases.
Aims and approaches: The main aim here was to characterize the genetic and genomic features of the transcribed
major quail MhcIIB (CojaIIB) region that is located between the Tapasin and BRD2 genes, and to compare our findings to
the available information for the chicken MhcIIB (BLB). We used four approaches in the study of the quail MhcIIB region,
(1) haplotype analyses with polymorphic loci, (2) cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR CojaIIB products from individuals
with different haplotypes, (3) genomic sequencing of the CojaIIB region from the individuals with the different haplotypes,
and (4) phylogenetic and duplication analysis to explain the variability of the region between the quail and the chicken.
Results: Our results show that the Tapasin-BRD2 segment of the quail Mhc is highly variable in length and in gene
transcription intensity and content. Haplotypic sequences were found to vary in length between 4 to 11 kb. Tapasin-BRD2
segments contain one or two major transcribed CojaIIBs that were probably generated by segmental duplications
involving c-type lectin-like genes and NK receptor-like genes, gene fusions between two CojaIIBs and transpositions
between the major and minor CojaIIB segments. The relative evolutionary speed for generating the MhcIIBs genomic
structures from the ancestral BLB2 was estimated to be two times faster in the quail than in the chicken after their
separation from a common ancestor. Four types of genomic rearrangement elements (GRE), composed of simple tandem
repeats (STR), were identified in the MhcIIB genomic segment located between the Tapasin-BRD2 genes. The GREs have
many more STR numbers in the quail than in the chicken that displays strong linkage disequilibrium.

Conclusion: This study suggests that the Mhc classIIB region has a flexible genomic structure generated by
rearrangement elements and rapid SNP accumulation probably as a consequence of the quail adapting to environmental
conditions and pathogens during its migratory history after its divergence from the chicken.

Background
The genomic region of the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) contains multi-gene family members involved
in the immune response. The Mhc class I and class II genes
encode glycoproteins that transport foreign peptides to
the surface of cells for recognition by T cell receptors on
lymphocytes, which in turn kill infected cells [1]. The Mhc
class II molecules have highly polymorphic peptide binding regions (PBR) for the α1 and β1 domains encoded by
the class IIA and class IIB genes, respectively, in various
vertebrates including avian [2]. These polymorphisms
may have been generated by gene conversion and positive
selection, such as balancing selection and overdominant
selection to adapt to life-environmental pathogens [3,4].
The most information currently available on the genomic
organization of the Mhc in birds is for the chicken and
quail. The chicken (Gallus domesticus) Mhc (Gado) region
is divided into two major parts, Gado-B and Gado-Y [5].
Both of these regions are inherited independently of each
other, although they are physically linked on micro-chromosome 16 (GGA16), [6-9]. From previous genomic
studies, GGA16 is suggested to be an essential immunity
chromosome, which is composed of genes involved with
adaptive immunity (BF/BL segment in Gado-B), innate
immunity (Gado-Y) and intrinsic immunity (TRIM-like
and BG gene segments in the extended Gado-B region
[[5,10-13], Shiina et al, Unpublished data].
The quail (Coturnix japonica, Coja) belongs to the same
order (Galliformes) and family (Phasianidae) as the
chicken. Whereas the quail is a migratory bird originating
from Northern and Southern Asia, flying only short distances at a time and with a relatively short history of
domestication, the chicken is a non-migratory bird originating from Southeastern Asia and with a thousand year
history of domestication. Chicken – quail hybrids have
been produced by artificial insemination of quails with
chicken sperm [22]. Several immunological traits have
been compared between various lines of quail which were
selected for high and low IgY levels in the serum [23], and
for high and low secondary antibody responses to Newcastle disease virus [24,25], influenza virus, sheep erythrocytes and Salmonella pullorum [26]. The quail is susceptible
to Marek's disease virus as observed in the chicken. The
chicken Gado-B complex has a significant influence in the
genetics of disease resistance, such as Rous sarcoma and
Marek's disease, but which genes within the complex are
responsible and how they confer resistance or susceptibil-

ity is not known [16-18]. One important obstacle to elucidating the Mhc resistance genes in chicken is that the BF,
BL and BG genes have co-evolved as haplotypes with a
high linkage disequilibrium between the genes due to the
compact structure of its "minimal essential" Mhc [19-21].
However, the immune response against the Marek's disease tumor-associated surface antigen (MATSA) in the
quail differs significantly from that in the chicken [27].
Such immunological differences are likely to be due in
part to the number and variation in Mhc gene loci and/or
alleles, but the data concerning the Coja haplotypes and
their association with disease is largely lacking. From our
previous transcription and genomic studies, we found
that the quail and chicken Mhc regions have a similar
overall organization, but differ markedly in that the quail
has an expanded number of duplicated genes with 7 class
I, 10 class IIB, 4 natural killer (NKr)-like receptor, 6 lectin-like
receptor and 8 BG genes [14,28,29]. To explain these findings, haplotypic genome comparison among quails and
between the quail and the chicken is a matter of primary
importance to elucidate the gene organization, molecular
mechanism of polymorphism generation and disease
analysis.
In order to better understand the genetic factors involved
in the generation of Mhc diversity in quail, we identified
and characterized six CojaIIB haplotypes by genotyping
and polymorphism analysis using expressed CojaIIB
sequences. We determined the genomic sequences within
the Tapasin-BRD2 genomic segment of five different Coja
haplotypes including the major transcribed CojaIIBs. We
also compared the quail Mhc class II genomic structures
and diversities of the chicken B12 and B21 haplotypic
orthologs by phylogenetic analysis and duplication modeling. This study shows that the quail has much greater
Mhc class IIB diversity and genomic structural flexibility
than the chicken even though the two species are closely
related in the evolutionary spectrum.

Results and discussion
Coja haplotype analysis with polymorphic loci
Three polymorphic markers PM1, PM2 and PM3, (Table
1) were used to genotype 48 randomly selected quails. We
chose these three markers for the preliminary classification of Coja haplotypes because they are located in the
Tapasin, Coja-DBB1 and Coja-DMB2 loci, respectively (Figure 1). The allele frequencies and heterozygosities for the
polymorphic markers are presented in Table 2. All of the
genotype frequencies were over 13% and the heterozygos-

ity for each marker was over 0.65. The minimum number
of haplotypes predicted from the maximum likelihood
analysis of the 48 quails by the two different methods, a
Bayesian statistical method and an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, was six (Table 3). Of the six haplotypes, the haplotype numbers (HT1 to HT5 had higher
frequencies, ranging from of 14.6% to 28.1%, than HT6
(5.2%). Interestingly, HT2 and HT6 had the same "6–10"
and "*02" allele combinations at the PM1 and PM2 loci
respectively, but a different allele type at the PM3 locus
(Table 3).
On the basis of finding the different allele type at the PM3
locus in HT6, recombination happened at least once in
the region within the 24.4 kb segment between the quail
genes Coja-DBB1 and Coja-DMB2 (PM2–PM3) and the
newly created haplotype has spread in the population.
Future analyses using fully pedigreed families should help
to ascertain whether the intervening segments of DNA are
the same in different individuals with the same threemarker genotype. Nevertheless, the variability in the quail
genomic segment between the Coja-DBB1 and CojaDMB2 genes corresponds to the chicken BF/BL region that
displays strong linkage disequilibrium and genomic structural stability [19,20].
Gene loci identification and haplotype reanalysis by RTPCR, cDNA cloning and sequencing of transcribed CojaIIB
loci
In order to identify and characterize the transcript
sequences expressed by the gene loci of the different haplotypes, six quails with relatively high HT frequencies representing haplotypes HT1 to HT5 were selected for RTPCR, cDNA cloning and sequencing analysis. The transcription intensity of the CojaIIB genes was estimated
from the number of clones sequenced. A summary of the
transcription intensity results for the five haplotypes is
presented in Table 4. The Table shows the transcription
intensity for HT1 to HT5 as a percent frequency of the
clones for each individual quail (identified as numbers
302, 311, 312, 321, 322 and 323) with the percent frequency of clones per haplotype in parenthesis. The Table
also shows the gene locus, the detected allele type, the
PM2 allele, the nucleotide accession number in GenBank
and the percent nucleotide similarity of the cDNA clones
to the transcribed sequences expressed by the CojaIIB loci
of HT1.

In total, 15 kinds of CojaIIB cDNA sequences derived from
the RT-PCR products of six quails were identified by
sequence comparison (Table 4). Another 19 CojaIIB
sequences were previously reported [14,25]. Altogether,
these expressed sequences were identified to be expressed
either by loci that were previously described alphabetically as Coja-DAB1 to Coja-DGB1 for HT1 or by as yet

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/322

unnamed loci. The new loci identified in this study were
therefore given names, such as CojaII-01, CojaII-02, CojaII13 and CojaII-16 as listed in Table 4, using the naming formulae "CojaII-XX" as suggested by Shimizu et al [25] for
the nomenclature of CojaIIB sequences. Each quail transcribed three to eight kinds of CojaIIB gene sequences
(Table 4). Five to six of the cDNA sequences, which were
observed in three quails (302, 312 and 321), perfectly
matched with six of the seven CojaIIB loci of Coja haplotype 1 (HT1), that is Coja-DAB1 and -DBB1 in the major
class II region, and Coja-DCB1, -DEB1, -DFB1 and -DGB1
in the minor class II region [14]. However, no sequences
were detected in our study for the HT1 Coja-DDB1 locus.
In addition, two other cDNA sequences were tentatively
named Coja-DFB1*02 in HT5 and Coja-DGB1*02 in HT1
because they appear to be additional alleles at the CojaDFB1 and -DGB1 loci, respectively, as determined from
our phylogenetic analysis (Figs. 2, Table 4, Additional file
1). The sequences of CojaII-01, -02 and -04 were perfectly
matched to the previously determined CojaII-01HL, 02HL and -04H haplotype sequences (Accession numbers; AB110476 to AB110478), respectively, which were
derived from different inbred lines [25,26]. However, the
CojaII-13, -14, -16 and -17 sequences did not have significantly high nucleotide similarities with the previously
determined sequences (76.3 ~ 88.9%) of HT1 sequences
and, therefore, were assigned as belonging to other
unique haplotypes (Table 4).
On the basis of the correlation of the Coja haplotypes and
distribution of the transcribed CojaIIBs for each of the
quails, the fifteen CojaIIB sequences were classified to five
distinct Coja haplotypes, namely, HT1, consisting of CojaDAB1, -DBB1, -DCB1, -DEB1, -DFB1 and -DGB1 loci;
HT2, CojaII-13; HT3, CojaII-16 and -17; HT4, CojaII-01, 02 and -04; and HT5, Coja-DFB1 and CojaII-14 (Table 4).
From the cDNA cloned frequencies per Coja haplotype,
Coja-DAB1, -DBB1, CojaII-01, -13, -14, -16 and -17,
excluding -DAB1 in quail 321, were the major transcribed
CojaIIBs with cloned frequencies of 34.8 ~ 100%, CojaII02 and -04 were moderately transcribed CojaIIBs with
cloned frequencies of 19.1 ~ 29.4%, and Coja-DCB1*01, DEB1*02, -DFB1*01, -DFB1*02, -DGB1*01 and DGB1*02 were minor transcribed CojaIIBs with cloned
frequencies of 2.9 ~ 14.3% (Table 4). This result suggests
that each Coja haplotype has at least one and up to seven
transcribed CojaIIB loci with one or two of them representing the major locus.
Genomic diversity of Tapasin-BRD2 segment
The Tapasin-BRD2 genomic segment contains the major
CojaIIB region with the Coja-DAB1, Coja-DBB1 and the
Coja-Lec1 genes flanked by the Tapasin and the BRD2
genes. This segment also has the PM1 and PM2 markers
that we used for haplotyping. In order to study the

genomic diversity of the Tapasin-BRD2 segments in different haplotypes by genomic sequencing, two cosmid
libraries were constructed representing the haplotypes
HT2, HT3, HT4 and HT5.
The average insert sizes of cosmid libraries constructed
from the genomic DNA of quails 311 (HT 2/3) and 322
(HT 4/5) were estimated to average 37.5 kb and 44.6 kb,
respectively, by 0.3% agarose gel electorophoresis analysis
using 20 randomly selected cosmids (data not shown). As
the quail has a genome size of 1.2 × 109 bp, similar to the
chicken, the two cosmid libraries 311 and 322 were
expected to cover 2.5 × 1010 bp (20.9-fold) and 21.4 ×
1010 bp (17.8-fold), respectively [11]. Two Tapasin (clone
number: 311CIIB-18 and 311CIIB-20) and two BRD2
positive cosmids (322CIIB-01 and 322CIIB-02) were isolated from HTs 2/3 and HTs 4/5 cosmid libraries, respectively. DNA typing revealed that the CojaIIB genes within
the cosmids 311CIIB-18, 311CIIB-20, 322CIIB-01 and
322CIIB-02 corresponded to the haplotypes HT2, HT3,
HT5 and HT5, respectively. Therefore, we selected the cos-

mids 311CIIB-18 (HT2), 311CIIB-20 (HT3) and 322CIIB02 (HT5) for the genomic sequencing study of the Tapasin-BRD2 segment.
The genomic sequences derived from 311CIIB-18,
311CIIB-20 and 322CIIB-02 cosmids were determined by
the shotgun method. Also a part of the Tapasin-BRD2 segment was sequenced from the long-ranged PCR products
amplified from the genomic DNA of HT3 and HT4
homozygote quails [25,26]. The genomic structures of the
major transcribed MhcIIB segments within the 5 quail
haplotypes H1 to H5 and the chicken haplotype B12
derived from the genomic sequencing information and
transcript alignments are shown in Fig. 3. The dot-matrix
analyses between the 5 Coja haplotypes, chicken and
quail, and two chicken haplotypes are shown in Additional file 2. After sequencing, the nucleotide lengths of
the segment between the Tapasin-BRD2 genes were determined to be 5,984 bp in HT2, 16,462 bp in HT3, 5,222 bp
in HT4 and 5,840 bp in HT5. The sequence of four segments on HT3 and HT4 was not determined fully how-

MHC genomic region (Figs. 3, Additional file 1) [31]. The
Tapasin-BRD2 segment of HT2 and HT5 contained only
one major transcribed CojaIIB (CojaII-13 and -14, respectively) and their genomic structures and nucleotide length
were similar to the chicken orthologous BL region (Figs. 3,
Additional file 1). The Tapasin-BRD2 segment of HT1 contained two major transcribed CojaIIBs (Coja-DAB1 and DBB1) (Fig. 3) [13]. Similarly, the Tapasin-BRD2 segment
of the HT4 contained two CojaIIBs (CojaII-01 and CojaII02) with major and moderately transcribed CojaIIB genes
(Table 4). In HT3, the Tapasin-BRD2 segment contained
three CojaIIBs, CojaII-16, Coja-W1 and Coja-W2. The
CojaII-16 is a major transcribed CojaIIB, but although
both Coja-W1 and -W2 have intact structures their mRNA
was not obtained from the peripheral blood cells (Fig. 3).
In all of the major transcribed CojaIIBs, the nucleotide
length of intron 1 was variable whereas the other introns
were relatively well conserved (Table 5). Moreover, one
major transcribed CojaIIB (CojaII-17) that was observed in
the HT3 (Table 4) was not identified in the Tapasin-BRD2
segment (Additional file 1). Consequently, the CojaII-17

is the only gene that either locates to a minor transcribed
CojaIIB locus or to some other genomic region.
In summary, the Tapasin-BRD2 segment contains one or
two major transcribed CojaIIBs that were identified in this
study in much the same way as the chicken with its major
transcribed MhcIIB, BLB2 (Figs. 1, 3). In contrast to Xenopus and mammals that also have MhcIIB genes located
within the Tapasin-BRD2 segment, the bony fishes, such as
medaka, fugu and rainbow trout, have MhcI genes within
the Tapasin-BRD2 segment. Thus, the locations of the
major transcribed CojaIIBs and BLB2 are well conserved in
birds and more comparable with mammals and reptiles
than with bony fish from the point of view of evolution
[15,32-34].

In a comparison of the CojaIIB gene organization of different haplotypes, the CojaIIB genomic units in the TapasinBRD2 segment of the HT1 [DBB1 – Lec – DAB1] and HT4

minor CojaIIB genomic DFB1/DEB1 unit [DFB1 – Lec4 –
DEB1], whereas those of the HT3 [CojaII-W2 – Lec –
CojaII-W1 – Nkr – CojaII-16] resemble the DFB1/DEB1/
DDB1 unit [DFB1 – Lec4 – DEB1 – NK2 – (Lec3) – DDB1],
although they are in the opposite direction to each other
(Fig. 3). Thus, two kinds of successive trans-segmental
duplications involving non-Mhc genes appear to have
produced the major CojaIIB segments independently.
However, significant nucleotide homologies between the
duplicated units were not observed (data not shown).
Since comparable segmental duplication variability has
not been observed in the Gado-B region, the trans-segmental duplications in quail are likely to have occurred after
speciation of the quail and chicken from their common
ancestor. In the case of human MHC, the traits of segmental duplications and transpositions were observed in the
HLA class I region [35], and especially the generation of
the HLA-B and -C segment that is explained by the events
involving the MHCI, MIC, HCGII, HCGIV, HCGIX, HCP5,
3.8-1 unit in the evolutionary process [36].

To clarify the genetic relationships among the CojaIIB
sequences and between the quail and the chicken MhcIIB
sequences, a phylogenetic tree of exon 2 was constructed
(Fig. 2). This tree suggests that the CojaIIB gene sequences
are more closely related to each other in the quail than to
the chicken MhcIIB (BLBs), and that the CojaIIB genes
have been duplicated after speciation of quail and
chicken. The average genetic distance of the CojaIIB
sequences (0.194+0.018) after speciation is twice as long
as that of the BLB sequences (0.107+0.016), meaning that
the CojaIIB genes have a relatively faster evolutionary
speed than the BLBs (Fig. 2). On the other hand, chicken
haplotype sequences are more closely related. From the
genome sequencing of the Red Jungle Fowl Mhc region,
the BLB nucleotide sequences were perfectly matched with
domestic chicken B21*BLB1 and B21*BLB2 sequences
[Shiina et al, Unpublished data]. Therefore, the BLB genes
appear to have been generated from a recent common
ancestor of both the egg-laying domestic chicken and
broilers.

Genomic structures of the major transcribed MhcIIB segments in the quail and chicken. The map shows the comparison of the major transcribed MhcIIB segments on five Coja haplotypic sequences (HT1 HT2 HT3 HT4 and HT5) and the
chicken B12 haplotype sequence. Gray striped and black boxes indicate the major transcribed MhcIIB moderately transcribed
MhcIIB and non-transcribed MhcIIB respectively. White boxes indicate other genes. The numbers in parenthesis are the GenBank accession numbers. The white oval indicates TB1 and the black oval indicates the location of TB2-1 TB2-2 and TB3.

In the phylogenetic tree, the quail lineage was divided
into three main clusters, one major and two major/minor
intermingled clusters, with the Coja-DCB1*01, CojaII-01
and CojaII-16 out-grouped from the three main clusters.
In comparison, the chicken lineage was divided into four
main clusters, namely one major, two minors and one
major/minor intermingled cluster (Fig. 2). In the case of
the major transcribed CojaIIBs, these were observed in all
clusters. In addition, the traits for two kinds of segmental
duplications were observed in the Tapasin-BRD2 segment
as previously mentioned, suggesting that the major transcribed CojaIIBs were generated by independent duplications and/or transpositions between the major and minor
CojaIIB segments at a relatively high evolutionary speed
after the separation of the quail and chicken from their

common ancestor (Fig. 4). In contrast, the BLB2
sequences of extant chickens appear to have been generated from an ancestral BLB2 gene with very little structural
reorganization or change (Fig. 4).
Genomic rearrangement elements in the major CojaIIB
segment involved in the generation of Mhc diversity
Four types of tandem repeat sequences were identified
that possibly drive genomic rearrangement events within
the Tapasin-BRD2 segment of HT1, HT2, HT3 and HT5
(Table 6). These simple candidate rearrangement elements are TB1, a known T-cell factor motif; TB3 and TB3,
STRs found in the mouse Mhc class II region; and TB4, a
recombination motif [37-39]. From the comparison of
the repeat numbers of the solitary repeat unit between

quail and chicken, the Coja haplotypes were found to contain numerous repeat numbers for TB1 to TB4, whereas
the chicken B12 and B21 haplotypes were found to have
none or only a few repeat numbers (Table 6). The TB
repeats were not identified in the minor transcribed
CojaIIB segment of the HT1 genome contigs [14]. Therefore, the TB repeats appear to be rearrangement elements
within the genome that provide strong driving forces for
the generation of new major transcribed CojaIIBs via
duplications and/or transpositions.
Genomic diversity within the major CojaIIB region and
disease studies
Mhc diversity in vertebrates is often attributed to the high
SNP content in this genomic region. The generation of
nucleotide polymorphism of Mhc genes is usually
explained by positive selection, such as balancing selection and overdominant selection acting on the Mhc genes,
which is necessary to maintain polymorphisms for survival against infections [3,4]. These selected pressures also
lead to a hitch-hiking effect that results in the accumulation of many additional SNPs around the Mhc gene [30].
Namely, the DNA segments affected by hitch-hiking have
arisen due to the accumulated effect of overdominant
selection and balancing selection. In the HLA region,
HLA-A, -B, -DR/DQ and -DP are thought to have been
affected by hitch-hiking and associated with several diseases, such as IDDM, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis
vulgaris [30,40]. The hitch-hiking effect was also observed
in Gado-B region [Shiina et al, Unpublished data]. Because
the CojaIIBs have developed at a faster evolutionary speed
than the BLBs (Fig. 2), the CojaIIB region is likely to be
also effected by hitch-hiking. If a harmful variation is generated around the Mhc gene via the hitch-hiking effect,
then it is likely to be selected against by genetic recombination.

A serious problem for disease mapping in the Gado-B
region is that genetic recombination within the BF, BL and
BG loci is rarely observed under experimental conditions,
Therefore, Gado-B haplotypes encompassing alleles in all
three loci are the units of inheritance most often considered in relating the Gado-B complex to immunity and disease responses [5]. On the other hand, the quail appears
to be relatively more resistant than the chicken to many
viral diseases [41]. In addition, the quail is thought to play
an important role in the evolution of influenza viruses by
acting as an intermediate host in which avian influenza
viruses can be amplified and transmitted to other animal
species [42]. Since the Coja region has the duplication and
divergence of CojaIIBs (Figs. 2, 3, Additional file 1), the
Coja region may be a superior system for the selection of
beneficial variations enabling more antigen presentation
ability than the Gado-B region. Therefore, to identify the
disease genetic factors associated with the Gado-B region,
comparative genomic and disease mapping analysis of the
Coja region is also important.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we characterized the genetic and genomic
features of the CojaIIB region and obtained the following
three main findings. Firstly, one to six transcribed CojaIIB
loci were identified in each Coja haplotype, of which one
or two of them was the major coding locus. The major
CojaIIB genes, except for CojaII-17 of HT3, were located
within the Tapasin-BRD2 segment. In contrast to the quail,
the chicken has one major and one minor MhcIIB. Secondly, phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses suggest
that the major transcribed CojaIIBs were organized by
independent trans-segmental duplications involving nonMhc genes and/or transpositions between major and
minor CojaIIBs. Consequently, the CojaIIBs have a relatively faster evolutionary speed than the BLBs. In contrast

to the quail, the chicken BLB2 alleles have been generated
from the ancestral BLB2 probably since the separation of
chickens and quails from their common ancestor. Thirdly,
four types of genome rearrangement elements (remodeling repeats) composed of tandem repeats were identified
within the 4 ~ 11 kb haplotypic Tapasin-BRD2 segment,
and the quail has far more repeat numbers for rearrangement events than the chicken that displays strong linkage
disequilibrium [19-21]. Taken together, these three main
findings support the view that the genomic diversity of the
CojaIIB region has been generated by duplications and
gene transpositions via the candidate rearrangement elements along with a fast evolutionary speed in adapting to
environmental conditions and pathogens during the
migratory history of the quail after its divergence from the
chicken. It is evident from our study that the quail MhcIIB
region has a much more flexible genomic structure than
the chicken for generating greater Mhc diversity.

Methods
Quail
Blood samples were collected from 48 randomly selected
quails maintained at the Tokyo University of Agriculture
[23,43]. The blood collection and animal studies were
conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal
Experiments at the Tokyo University of Agriculture.
Genotyping and haplotype analyses
Three polymorphic markers, PM1 to PM3, were identified
in the Mhc classIIB genomic region of the quail (Figure 1)
and were used as markers in this study for an initial haplotype analysis [14] (Tables 1, 2) either by PCR and
sequence based typing or by PCR and RFLP analysis. PM1
is a mini-satellite marker composed of two different types
of repetitive sequences and located in the Tapasin gene;
PM2 is Coja-DBB1 locus genotyping marker; and PM3 is
composed of two SNP markers located within the Coja-

DMB2 gene (Table 1). Five different PM1 alleles were first
identified by sequencing and then correlated with the
length of their PCR products. The PCR product sizes of the
PM1 alleles were then used to identify and define the alleles in the individual samples without the need for further
sequencing. The PM1 alleles were designated as "6–10",
"8–12", "9–12", "10–14" and "18–14" based on the
length of the repeat units. For example, the "6–10" allele
corresponds
to
the
sequence
TTCCTATGGGGGCTGTAGGGTGGATGGGACTGGGTGG
TA6 – ATGAT10. Five PM2 alleles (Table 2) amplified by
PCR were detected by a sequence based typing method of
the PCR products and designated as Coja-DBB1*01 (alias
"*01"), "*02", "*03", "*04" and "*05". The three PM3
alleles designated as alleles "G-C", "G-G" and "A-C" were
detected by a PCR-RFLP method using DraIII and HinfI
(Table 1) to identify the SNPs "G/A" and "G/C" at the two
SNP sites that are apart by 194 bp. Haplotype prediction
was performed by PHASE and Arlequin programs [44,45].
Maximum-likelihood haplotype frequencies were predicted by a Bayesian statistical method of the PHASE program and an EM algorithm of the Arlequin program.
RT-PCR, cloning cDNA and sequence determination
Total RNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of six
quails identified by the numbers302, 311, 312, 321, 322
and 323 and having the haplotypes (HTs) 1/1, 2/3, 1/3, 1/
4, 4/5, and 2/4 respectively. The TRIzol reagent was used
to isolate the total RNA as described by the manufacturer
(Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). Total RNA (0.2 ug)
was synthesized to cDNA by using First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Rever Tra Ace-α-) and the oligo (dT) primer
method (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The CojaIIB specific
primers were designed to amplify the exons 1 – 3 (amplified size: from 411 bp to 441 bp) and to detect polymorphisms on hyper variable β1 domain (exon 2) by RT-PCR
amplification with the sense primer (C2BNO2: 5'-GAGTGCCACTACCTGAACGGCACCGAGG-3') and the antisense
primer
(C2BNO5: 5'-GCGCCAGGAAGACGAGCCCCAGCAC-3'). These primer sequences were per-

fectly matched with all CojaIIB genes on the Coja
haplotype 1 to 5 in this study, providing confidence that
the primers will amplify all the known CojaIIB genes with
the same efficiency. cDNA (10 ng) was amplified by PCR
with 2.5 units of GeneTaq NT polymerase (Nippon Gene,
Toyama, Japan), using the thermal cycler GeneAmp PCR
system 9700. The reaction mixture (10 ul) was subjected
to 30 cycles of 30 sec at 96°C, 30 sec at 65°C, and 30 sec
at 72°C. The RT-PCR products were cloned into the
pGEM-T Easy vector with the TA cloning kit according to
the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) and sequenced using the ABI3100
genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) in accordance with the protocol of BigDye terminator method. To avoid PCR and sequencing artifacts generated by polymerase errors, 96 clones per individual were
sequenced.
Construction and screening of cosmid libraries
Genomic DNAs for constructing the cosmid libraries were
isolated from the red blood cells of two Coja haplotype
heterozygote quails (311 and 322), having HTs 2/3 and 4/
5, by the Saponin-NaCl method [43]. The libraries were
constructed by the SuperCos 1/Gigapack XL cloning kit
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA, USA). Approximately 5 × 105 independent colonies derived from these libraries were screened by using
PCR products as hybridization probes obtained from the
527 ~ 586 bp CojaIIB fragment generated by the sense
primer C2BNO2 and the anti-sense primer C2BNO5
already described above in the RT-PCR section; the 276 bp
Tapasin fragment generated by sense primer Tapasin/e5-1
(5'-CCCAAAGAACCTGGTGGTGA-3') and anti-sense
primer Tapasin/e5-4 (5'-AATGACCGTGGGTGACAA-3')
and the 134 bp BRD2 fragment produced by the sense
primer RING3/e4-1 (5'-GCAGCGGAGTGCAGAGACTT3') and anti-sense primer RING3/e4-3 (5'-CGAGTGCCAGCTGTCTCCTC-3').

Genomic sequencing strategy
The DNA of CojaIIB, Tapasin and BRD2 positive cosmids
was sequenced by the shotgun method [46]. Individual
sequences were minimally edited to remove vector
sequences, and assembled into a contig using the
Sequencher software (Gene Codes Co., Ann Arbor, MI,
USA). Remaining gaps or ambiguous nucleotides were
determined by the direct sequencing of the PCR products
obtained with appropriate PCR primers or by nucleotide
sequence determination of additional shotgun clones.

Dot-matrix analysis among five Coja haplotypes (A ~ J) between quail
and chicken (K) and between chicken B12 and B21 (L). Dot plot comparisons shows HT1 vs HT2 (A) HT1 vs HT3 (B) HT1 vs HT4 (C) HT1
vs HT5 (D) HT2 vs HT3 (E) HT2 vs HT4 (F) HT2 vs HT5 (G) HT3 vs
HT4 (H) HT3 vs HT5(I) HT4 vs HT5 (J) HT2 vs chicken B12 (K) and
chicken B12 vs B21 (L). Numbers and blue circles in the images show the
location of genome candidate remodeling (rearrangement) factors with
the numbers 1 to 3 representing TB1 – TB3 respectively as outlined in
Table 6. Gray background shows the gap within the segments that was
determined by sequencing.
