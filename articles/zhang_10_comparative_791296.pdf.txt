urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis and
bladder

Abstract
Background: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) can arise at any location along the urothelial tract, including the urethra,
bladder, ureter, or renal pelvis. Although tumors arising in these various locations have similar morphology, it is
unclear whether the gene expression profiles are similar between the upper-tract (ureter and renal pelvis) and
lower-tract (bladder and urethra) carcinomas. Because differences may facilitate different screening and treatment
modalities, we sought to examine the relationship between urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis (rUC) and
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (bUC).
Methods: Fresh tumor tissue was collected from patients with bUC (n = 10) and benign mucosa from the bladder
of individuals undergoing resection for non-UC conditions (n = 7). Gene expression profiles from these samples
were determined using high-throughput Affymetrix gene expression microarray chips. Bioinformatic approaches
were used to compare the gene expression profiles of these samples with those of rUC samples and normal
kidney samples that had been described previously.
Results: Using unsupervised analytic approaches, rUC and bUC were indistinguishable. Yet when a supervised
analytic approach was used, a small number of differentially expressed genes were identified; these differences
were most likely limited to a single pathway–the chloride ion binding activity pathway–which was more frequently
activated in rUC than in bUC.
Conclusions: We found that the gene expression profiles of UCs from the upper and lower tract were extremely
similar, suggesting that similar pathogenic mechanisms likely function in the development of these tumors. The
differential expression of genes in the identified pathway may represent a new avenue for detection of upper-tract
tumors.

Background
Urothelial carcinoma (UC) can arise anywhere along the
epithelial lining of the urinary tract, including the renal
pelvis, ureter, bladder, and urethra. Traditionally, uppertract tumors are considered to be those arising from the
renal pelvis and ureter, whereas lower-tract tumors arise
in the bladder and urethra. Despite similar morphologic
appearances, upper- and lower-tract UCs have been

proposed to represent unique entities, based on their
differing locations and embryonic derivation from distinct structures [1]. In addition, exposure to toxins may
be more pronounced in the bladder due to its storage
function, perhaps suggesting different initiating factors
in cancer development.
In general, UCs of the upper tract have been associated with a more aggressive disease course and are
often not diagnosed until the more-advanced stages,
relative to UCs of the bladder [2-5]. Many investigators
believe that the minimal sub-epithelial connective tissue
and muscularis of the upper urinary tract may predispose it to early tumor invasion [2-5]. However, uppertract tumors are often more challenging to diagnose, as
patients are often asymptomatic and urine cytology may

not be as sensitive to these more distant lesions, suggesting that a delay in diagnosis may also account for
more aggressive tumor behavior.
Regardless of the inciting mechanism or long-term
behavior, an understanding of the differences or similarities in the genetic profiles of UCs of the upper and
lower tract is critical in defining the utility of new diagnostic and treatment protocols. In order to address this,
we collected samples from patients with lower-tract UC
(bladder; bUC) and benign mucosa samples from bladder of individuals undergoing resection for non-UC conditions; their gene expression profiles were obtained
using Affymetrix gene expression profile arrays. These
profiles were compared with profiles from upper-tract
UC (renal pelvis; rUC) and benign renal pelvic mucosa
(rNO). To our knowledge, this is the first report to
compare the gene expression profiles of UCs of the
upper and lower tracts.

Methods
The bladder samples were collected from the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation which included 10 samples of muscle-invasive UC arising in the bladder (bUC), and
7 samples of benign bladder urothelium obtained from
patients undergoing cystectomy for interstitial cystitis or
non-functioning bladder. We compared the gene expression profiles of these tumors with those of 14 normal
kidney and 14 urothelial carcinoma from renal pelvis,
most of them (n = 13) were used in our previous publication [6] (with one new addition for each class in this
study). Informed written consent of each patient was
obtained, and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Cleveland Clinic, the Van Andel
Research Institute, and Spectrum Health Hospital. All
specimens were obtained within 15 minutes of surgical
extraction and were immediately opened and samples
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were
reviewed by an expert urology pathologist (D.E.H.).
Samples with >10% necrosis or contaminating renal parenchyma on frozen section of the specimen were
excluded from evaluation. Although the tissue samples
were obtained at different time periods and different
locations, all followed the same standard acquisition
procedure, and the microarray data were all obtained by
the same facility in our laboratory. This effectively
reduced the likelihood of having batch effect in the generated data set. The samples and the class abbreviations
are summarized in Table 1.
Raw gene expression levels

Ten micrograms of total RNA was processed for the
expression microarrays using the Affymetrix GeneChip
one-cycle target labeling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommended

Page 2 of 10

protocols. The resultant biotinylated cDNA was fragmented and then hybridized to the GeneChip human
genome (54,675 probe sets in total, including more than
35,000 human genes; Affymetrix). The arrays were
washed, stained, and scanned using the Affymetrix
Model 450 Fluidics Station and Affymetrix Model 3000
scanner using the manufacturer’s recommended
protocols.
Expression values were generated by using Microarray
Suite (MAS) v5.0 software (Affymetrix). The probes
were redefined using updated probe set mappings (Bioc
package: hs133phsentrezgcd [7]). The hybridizations
were normalized using the robust multichip averaging
(rma) algorithm implemented in Bioconductor package
affy (http://www.bioconductor.org/, [8]) to obtain a
summary expression value for each probe set of genes
[9-11]. This resulted in a gene expression intensity data
set containing more than 17,000 rows (genes), each of
which has one numeric value representing its relative
expression intensity in the sample.
Gene expression summary

Gene expression levels were summarized according to
the genes’ physical locations using the regional expression biases package (reb) in Bioconductor [9,10]. The
algorithm groups the gene expression intensities by the
associated gene locations. For each region (cytoband), a
general test (such as binomial or t-test) is applied to
determine if the gene expressions in the region are collectively higher or lower than the reference expressions.
The test statistics are then output for each sample and
for each cytogenetic region. As large-scale genomic gain
(or loss) is often accompanied by overexpressed (or
underexpressed) genes within the region [12], this summary was often used as a surrogate to detect the underlying genomic alterations [13-15].
Gene expression profiling study through unsupervised
and supervised clustering algorithm

A hierarchical clustering algorithm was used for finding
(unsupervised) clusters based on the Euclidean distance
for dissimilarities of gene expression profiles among the
samples. The slightly modified “plot.phylo” function
from the analysis of phylogenetics and evolution (ape)
package was used to display the clustering results [16].
The interquartile range (IQR) and coefficient of variation (CV) were used to filter the genes (in log scale of
the intensities) for the unsupervised clustering study.
The IQR was defined to be the distance between the
first and third quartiles of the data vector. The CV value
of a data vector, on the other hand, was defined to be
the standard deviation divided by its mean value. We
used IQR > 0.9 and CV > 0.1 as our filtering criteria,
which resulted in a set of about 3500 genes.

To study the stability of the clustering trees, we used
consensus clustering analysis [17]. Instead of building
one tree from the data set, this algorithm will build as
many trees as specified by bootstrap sampling the genes
from gene space and then find the percentage of occurrence of a cluster among all trees. The higher this percentage is, the more stable the cluster, and the more
similar are the gene expression profiles within the cluster. The Euclidean distance was used in this study. A
total of 500 bootstrapped samples with replacement on
the gene space were used.
We used the significance analysis of microarrays
(SAM) algorithm to pick the differential genes [18]. The
most informative genes for separating bladder and renal
UCs were selected in two steps. In the first step, genes
were filtered as before to exclude those genes with little
variation across the samples. In the second step, the top
genes were picked by statistical (2-sample) testing by
directly comparing the gene expression intensities
between samples of rUC and bUC. The p-values for
genes in the filtered gene list after the first step were
calculated by the Wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank
tests [19]. The q-values were calculated by John Storey
et al.’s procedure [20] for multiple test adjustment. The
q-value is more proper for multiple testing, as it was
designed to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR)
when the number of tests is large. The individual test pvalues are generally overestimated when there is more
than one hypothesis to be tested simultaneously.
We set 0.05 as our significance level in all tests
reported in this paper; it was also the default FDR level
for the selection of differential genes when the SAM
algorithm was used, unless otherwise explicitly specified.
All calculations were implemented in the R environment
at version 2.7.2 or higher [21].

Results
Regional gene expression bias analysis of upper- and
lower-tract UCs relative to normal references for
inference of underlining genomic alterations

Chromosomal defects such as chromosome amplifications and deletions can be detected from the analysis of
gene expression data [22,23]. For example, genes that
map to regions of chromosome amplification typically

produce more RNA than is found in cytogenetically normal samples; likewise, genes that map to regions of
chromosome deletion typically produce less RNA. We
scanned the gene expression data to determine if UCs
isolated from the renal pelvis showed a different spectrum of chromosomal abnormalities than UCs isolated
from the bladder. Figure 1A shows the unsupervised
clustering results, while Figure 1B shows a summary of
potential chromosomal abnormalities based on gene
expression data as described in the Materials and Methods. Briefly, expression values were grouped into sets
based on gene location (to the nearest cytoband) and
the expression of genes in the tumor sample were compared to the expression in the normal bladder samples
(bUC). While Figure 1A was produced on the summarization data set without cutoff values, Figure 1B was produced by using cutoff values of 4.3 from above and -4.3
from below on the summarization scores (any value in
between was set to 0). Cytobands with fewer than
10 genes in our database were removed, as too few
genes in a cytoband often produce undesired summarization results.
This figure serves as an overview of the data set and a
summary of deviation (bias) of gene expressions from
normal references values, as well as a tool for inferring
the cytogenetic alterations underlying the gene expression profiles (see Materials and Methods). As anticipated, benign urothelial samples from the bladder and
renal pelvis did not show many large-scale gene expression alterations. At cytogenetic level, we did not detect
many differences between rUC and bUC, as seen in
Figure 1A, where rUC and bUC samples were well mixed
with each other. The exception was an apparent increase
in the overall 9p loss in rUC, which is the region containing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A and 2B
(CDKN2A and CDKN2B) genes. Both CDKN2A and
CDKN2B losses have been well documented in UC, with
a CDKN2A deletion often associated with worsened outcomes [24,25]. Losses in these genes have also been
implicated in other RCC subtypes [26]. This method predicted correctly the following cytogenetic alterations that
are frequently observed in UCs: +1p36, -4q, -5p, +6p22,
-6q, +7p, +8q2, -9p, +11q13, -13q, +17, +19q13, and
+20q [27-29]. While this surrogate for detecting genomic

gains or losses is approximate and has limitations, the
pattern of chromosomal abnormalities detected does not
indicate a gross difference in aneuploidy between the
renal and bladder-derived UCs [30].
In our subsequent data analyses (Figure 1B), we
noticed that two bUCs (bU28 and bU29) and two rUCs
(rU173 and rU409) displayed patterns distinct from
those of other samples in their respective classes. Their
gene expression summarization profiles appeared more
like the profiles from normal samples than from tumors.
When they were included in the supervised or unsupervised clustering study, these four samples always segregated within the same cluster as the normal samples.
These observations lead us to believe that these four
samples may be inherently different from the rest of the
tumor samples or that their mRNA quality may have
been poor.

Indeed, a careful retrospective review of the samples
revealed that bU28 had approximately 50% stroma
admixed, while bU29 had a lesser (but still significant)
amount. This admixture likely affected the gene expression measurement. Although the urothelium in normal
samples was stripped, a small portion of the underlying
lamina propria/connective tissue remains inherently
attached to the base of the specimen and may explain
the clustering of these tumor specimens with normal
urothelium. On the other hand, both rU409 and rU173
represent high-grade invasive UC, with rU409 having a
prominent papillary component. Overall, it is unclear
why they have gene expression profiles so close to that
of normal urothelium. Tissue sample bias for running
the microarray may be one of the possible reasons. In
our subsequent analyses, these four samples have been
removed from study to avoid skewing the results. A

summarization box plot of the data set was shown in
Additional File 1: Supplemental Figure S1. Apart from
rNO samples, which appeared to have narrower IQRs,
all the rest of the samples had comparable data summarizations. We are not sure if this is due to the batch
effect or if this reflected the real differences between
rNO and other samples. Tissues for rNO cases were
obtained from the same institute as those for rUCs;
their microarray data were scanned using the same facility and in roughly the same time period as data for rUC
samples. In both cases, the difference between rNO and
the rest of the samples will have no effect on our conclusions here, as our main purpose was to compare the
profiles between rUC and bUC. In general, our microarray data set was of good quality for profiling purposes.
Unsupervised clustering reveals similar gene expression
profiles in UC but not in normal urothelium

To compare the gene expression profiles of all samples,
we first performed an unsupervised clustering study
using all genes in the database (>17,000; Figure 2A).
Several key findings emerged from this primary analysis.
First, normal samples from the renal pelvis were tightly
clustered together far from the remaining samples (cluster C1 in Figure 2A), indicating they have a highly distinct gene expression profile relative to either normal
bladder urothelium or UC. Second, normal bladder
urothelium also clustered together tightly (cluster C2 in
Figure 2A). These findings indicate that at the genetic
level, normal urothelium can be robustly distinguished
from UC, and that normal urothelium from the upper
and lower tracts have unique profiles despite identical
morphological appearance.
We next compared the relationship between rUC and
bUC. In this unsupervised clustering analysis, rUC and
bUC had overlapping profile patterns, suggesting that
the UCs from the two locations are indistinguishable at
the genome-wide gene expression level, although two
distinct groupings appeared to emerge within the total
tumor group. This was also true when the unsupervised
clustering was applied without normal renal samples
(data not shown) to exclude the possibility of renal parenchyma contamination.
To test whether the clustering patterns depended on
the number of genes evaluated, we next applied various
filtering steps to decrease the number of genes before
applying the clustering algorithm. One choice was to
use IQR and CV as our filtering criteria. About 3500
genes passed these filtering criteria (see Materials and
Methods). The clustering result is displayed in Figure
2B and is consistent with the unfiltered data. Next, we
applied the consensus algorithm to the filtered gene set
to determine the stability of the clusters (Figure 2C).
Five hundred trees were built and the frequencies of

Page 5 of 10

clusters were counted among all 500 trees. The frequencies are indicated in the nodes of the tree plot in Figure
2C. We found that the normal samples from renal pelvis
and the normal samples from bladder always clustered
together within their respective groups, distinguishable
from the rest of samples (100% in both cases). The
tumor samples in total also consistently clustered
together more than 99.9% of the time (the numbers in
Figure 2C were truncated to whole numbers), although
two overlapping groups (C3 and C4), each containing
both rUC and bUC samples, were identified. To identify
the underlying gene expression profiles, we used the
SAM method to select the most differentially expressed
genes between samples of the two clusters (C3 and C4).
The heat map of the selected 95 genes (Figure 2D,
Additional File 2: Supplementary Table S1) shows that
these genes clearly separate the samples into two classes,
as was expected.
The reason for this dual clustering pattern of UCs (C3
and C4) is currently unclear, but it was not the result of
confounding effects (day the arrays were performed, lot
number of chip, quality of RNA, etc.). We suspect that
the pattern may be inherently related to differences in
the underlying tumor biology and/or behavior; future
studies will address this possibility in more detail. Overall, the unsupervised clustering of gene profiles revealed
that it is readily possible to distinguish normal urothelium from UC, as well as to distinguish normal urothelium from the upper and lower tract, but it cannot be
used to determine whether a UC is derived from the
upper or lower urinary tract.
Supervised study of UCs reveals marked commonality in
gene profiles

We next compared the samples directly to obtain the
most informative genes between UCs of either origin
using the statistical analysis of microarray (SAM)
approach [18]. The resulting genes are generally
regarded to be the “best” for separating the two classes
of samples (most varied among the samples, plus having
the most differential ability between the two classes).
The best 21 genes are listed in Table 2 (by setting the
delta value equal to 0.37 in the SAM algorithm; it was
liberal in order to have some genes left), and the heat
map of these genes is shown in Figure 3A. All q-values
were insignificant, with the exception of that for the
CLYBL-gene, which showed a marginally significant qvalue 0.06 at FDR level 0.05. By systematically checking
the gene expression profiles individually for each gene
in the list, we found that no single gene showed expression intensities uniformly higher or lower in bUC versus
rUC. The absence of genes that significantly differentiate
between rUC and bUC further supports the overall
related nature of these two entities.

frequent overlap. D) Heat map of SAM-selected genes that are the most differentiated between UC samples in the C3 and C4 groups identified
in the unsupervised study (Figure 2A and B).

Based on the profiles of the genes in the supervised
study, the most promising genes to differentiate the
tumors are chloride channel, calcium-activated, 2
(CLCA2, FC = 12, Figure 3B) and gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) A receptor, epsilon (GABRE, FC = 9.6, Figure 3C). Both genes are frequently overexpressed in rUC
relative to both bUC and to primary renal carcinomas
(Additional File 3: Supplemental Figure S2A, S2B).
These two genes are actually related to the same functional modules. Through queries to a public database,
we found that both genes share the same biological
function of catalyzing and facilitating diffusion of chloride through a transmembrane aqueous pore or channel
without evidence for a carrier-mediated mechanism
(gene ontology GO:0005254,) and chloride ion binding
(GO:0031404,). We recently showed that FXYD domain
containing ion transport regulator 3 (FXYD3), another
gene related to these functional modules, was identified

as a marker gene for UCs from the renal pelvis (Zhang
et al, 2009, in review). Of note, CLCA2 represents a
tumor suppressor gene that has been shown to promote
apoptosis in a variety of cancer models, including breast
cancer [31,32]. Its role in UC is currently unclear.
Future studies to delineate the role of these chloridemediating factors in upper- and lower-tract UC may
reveal distinct biological functions of these molecules, as
well as provide a potential diagnostic tool for use with
urine specimens.
Supervised studies of gene expression profiles between
other pairs of classes

Using same method of identifying differential genes as
above, we next compared the gene expression profiles
between normal samples from the bladder and normal
samples from the renal pelvis (Figure 3D), and between
normal samples from the bladder and combined UC

samples (bUC and rUC, Figure 3E). With similar parameters for the SAM algorithm, there are 558 genes significantly differentiated between bNO and UC and 778
genes between bNO and rNO. The large number of differentially expressed genes in the latter comparison
implies the large number of profile dissimilarities
between bNO and rNO, as was seen in Figure 2A-2C,
clusters C1 and C2. Unlike the comparison between
bUC and rUC (Figure 3A), results from these two pairs
of comparisons show remarkable differences in gene
expression profiles, largely in agreement with our unsupervised study results in Figure 2. The gene lists are
given in detail as supplementary material (see Additional
Files 4 and 5: Supplementary Table S2 and S3).
While about half of the genes in the list are overexpressed in rNO relative to bNO, the majority of genes
identified to be significant between UC and normal
samples are underexpressed in UC relative to bNO.
Among the genes differentially expressed between bNO
and rNO, a significant number are sodium-related (15
genes in total), involving functions related to sodium
transportation (sodium ion binding, sodium ion transportation). Examples of genes include ATPase Na+/K+

Discussion
In this study, we have compared the gene expression
profiles of urothelial carcinomas arising from the upper
and lower urinary tract, as well as their relationship to
profiles from normal urothelium at both locations. Our
unsupervised clustering analyses showed that UCs from
the two locations often showed overlapping gene expression profiles, despite their different embryonic origins.
Our supervised clustering analysis showed the existence
of very limited differences in gene expression profiles
and in signaling pathways between UCs from the two
locations, although CLCA2 and GABRE may hold promise as differential markers.
Of interest, we identified a distinct genetic profile
between normal urothelium derived from the upper and
lower tract. Although identical in morphological appearance, the urothelium of the lower tract is derived from
the upper portion of the urogenital sinus, while that of
the upper tract is from the ureteric bud of the mesonephric duct. The former is potentially exposed to a
higher concentration of excreted toxins due to the storage function of the bladder. This may explain the differences in gene expression profiles of the normal
samples from the two locations. Paradoxically, the striking gene expression profile differences between bNO
and rNO did not imply the differences in regional gene
expression bias (see Figure 1). This implies that the profile differences between bNO and rNO are not a result
of underlying genetic differences. We retrospectively
evaluated the genetic background (race, gender, etc.) of
individuals whose specimens were used for this study
and identified no significant differences between the
sample populations (data not shown).
Based on the differences in profiles between rNO and
bNO, we have used benign bladder urothelium as the
general reference point in producing the gene expression summarization plot in our data analysis. Our result
confirms that the genetic backgrounds of UCs from
both locations are largely indistinguishable, offering support for the idea that they are largely the same tumors,
sharing the same genetic abnormalities. Gene therapy

Figure 3 Supervised analysis studies to identify genes differentially expressed. A) Twenty-one genes that best distinguish UC of the renal
pelvis and UC of bladder. q-values were obtained by the FDR controlling procedure on the p-values with Wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank
tests. B-C) Gene expression profiles of the genes CLCA2 and GABRA, showing significantly overexpression in bUC relative to rUC (potential
biomarkers for distinguishing between bUC and rUC). Bars show the median values for each class. D) Normal samples from bladder and renal

treatments that are effective against one of them are
quite likely to be effective against the other due to their
similar genetic backgrounds.
Our study shows that the phenotypic differences
between rUC and bUC are likely to have non-molecular
origins. For example, one such difference is the survival
prognosis. It has been demonstrated that patients with
rUC have significantly poorer survival than patients with
bUC [1]. However, these phenotypic differences do not
necessarily imply genetic differences. Studies show that
UCs from renal pelvis are more frequently at a late
stage when diagnosed than UCs from bladder [2-5]. The
anatomic and environmental surroundings of the tumor
cells may also play a role in the phenotypic differences.
Our study shows that if there are any genetic contributions toward the phenotypic differences, that contribution is very limited, possibly restricted to only one
signaling pathway. Our direct comparison did not show
strong evidence that there were genes significantly differentiated between tumors from the two locations (see
Figure 3A). Even if a study finds a difference in gene
expression between upper and lower GU tract tumors,
this still does not necessarily imply that the difference is
accounted for by the aggressiveness of the upper-tract

tumors. For example, in a case where the elevated genes
are mostly stromal genes, the elevation in gene expressions can be easily explained by the presence of more
benign stromal tissues in the bladder samples than in
the upper-tract samples. Similarly, genes related to ion
metabolism could be found elevated in the upper-tract
tumors because of the presence of benign renal parenchymal tissue in those samples.
Because the gene expression profiles are very similar
between UCs from the upper and lower tracts, it is
unlikely that direct cytogenetic profile comparisons
will find any significant differences. Indeed, our analysis of regional gene expression bias identified correctly
that the most common cytogenetic alterations seem to
appear in both rUCs and bUCs. These cytogenetic
alterations include +1p36, +6p22, +7, +8q22, -9p21,
+11q, -13q, +17, +19q13, and +20q, which have all
been previously documented in UC [27-29]. Due to the
indirect method, the complex gene regulations and
gene interactions (including unknown mechanisms for
example, in [30]), as well as noise within the data, the
results may not agree with results obtained from direct
measurement of sample DNA materials (such as from
SNP arrays).

In summary, we compared the gene expression profiles of UCs arising from the upper and lower urinary
tract, as well as the profiles of normal urothelium from
the renal pelvis and bladder. We did not identify significant differences between upper- and lower-tract UCs,
suggesting that the entities are closely related and therefore will share molecular features that can be maximized
in the development of new diagnostic markers and therapeutic interventions. Further evaluation of potential differences in the chloride transporter pathway will be
conducted to determine whether CLCA2 and GABRE
may reflect unique markers that can be used to differentially evaluate and target upper-tract UC.

Conclusions
In summary, we found that the gene expression profiles
of UCs from the upper and lower tract were extremely
similar, suggesting that similar pathogenic mechanisms
likely function in the development of these tumors.
While there may be small differences between these
profiles, they are likely to be restricted to a very limited
number of gene pathways. Therefore, it may be possible
to treat the UCs from both locations as a single entity
on a genetic level in the future.
