Gone with the currents: lack of genetic
differentiation at the circum-continental scale in
the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba

Abstract
Background: Southern Ocean fauna represent a significant amount of global biodiversity, whose origin may be
linked to glacial cycles determining local extinction/eradication with ice advance, survival of refugee populations
and post-glacial re-colonization. This pattern implies high potential for differentiation in benthic shelf species with
limited dispersal, yet consequences for pelagic organisms are less clear. The present study investigates levels of
genetic variation and population structure of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba using mitochondrial DNA and
EST-linked microsatellite markers for an unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of its populations over a circumAntarctic range.
Results: MtDNA (ND1) sequences and EST-linked microsatellite markers indicated no clear sign of genetic structure
among populations over large geographic scales, despite considerable power to detect differences inferred from
forward-time simulations. Based on ND1, few instances of genetic heterogeneity, not significant after correction for
multiple tests, were detected between geographic or temporal samples. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution
based on mtDNA sequences revealed strong evidence of past population expansion. Significant positive values of
the parameter g (a measure of population growth) were obtained from microsatellite markers using a coalescentbased genealogical method and suggested a recent start (60 000 - 40 000 years ago) for the expansion.
Conclusions: The results provide evidence of lack of genetic heterogeneity of Antarctic krill at large geographic
scales and unequivocal support for recent population expansion. Lack of genetic structuring likely reflects the tight
link between krill and circum-Antarctic ocean currents and is consistent with the hypothesis that differentiation
processes in Antarctic species are largely influenced by dispersal potential, whereas small-scale spatial and temporal
differentiation might be due to local conditions leading to genetic patchiness. The signal of recent population
growth suggests differential impact of glacial cycles on pelagic Antarctic species, which experienced population
expansion during glaciations with increased available habitat, versus sedentary benthic shelf species.
EST-linked microsatellites provide new perspectives to complement the results based on mtDNA and suggest that
data-mining of EST libraries will be a useful approach to facilitate use of microsatellites for additional species.

Background
Antarctic waters host a unique cold-adapted fauna that
constitutes a significant amount of the global biodiversity [1] and has been the subject of biological studies for
over a century. Starting with the early Antarctic expeditions of the R.R.S. Discovery (1925-1927) and H.M.S.
Challenger (1872-1876), scientists have concentrated

their efforts first on the collection and identification of
Antarctic organisms, and thereafter on the investigation
of how they are spatially distributed, leading to the
description of Antarctic biogeography [2,3]. In addition
to the considerable work on the biology of Antarctic
marine fauna and estimates of Antarctic biodiversity in
general [4-7], recent studies have focused on understanding the genetic patterns, speciation processes, and/
or environmental mechanisms that have lead to recent
Antarctic biodiversity patterns [8-15]. In particular,
most studies in the past two decades focused on

Antarctic marine benthos, for which many new taxa and
cryptic species have been described in the costal shelf
[16,17], whereas recent work in the deep sea has documented, by means of molecular tools, a spectacular and
previously-unsuspected diversity [18].
Based mainly on studies of benthos, hypotheses have
been formulated to explain Southern Ocean faunal
distribution and Antarctic endemism in relation to the
influences of oceanographic processes (e.g., Antarctic
Convergence and Antarctic Polar Front, ice advance
and retreats during glaciations as evidenced by paleoclimatic studies) in shaping the evolutionary history of
Antarctic species [19,20]. The recent finding that
many of the benthic species probably survived the last
glacial maximum [16,21] implies processes of local
extinction/eradication and survival of refugee populations in suitable areas, followed by post-glacial recolonization. This pattern implies high potential for
differentiation, particularly in species with limited dispersal, such as benthic brooders, but several exceptions seem to show the possibility of genetic
differentiation, including invertebrates with pelagic
larvae, such as the crinoid Promachocrinus kerguelensis [22]. Significant differentiation among populations
has been found in several species of nototheniod fish,
all characterized by pelagic larvae. Signals for
restricted gene flow were reported not only in demersal notothenioids but also in the few existing pelagic
species of this fish sub-order (reviewed in [23]). This
suggests that the interplay between life history traits
(i.e., larval duration, philopatry) and marine currents
may contribute to isolating populations and ultimately
lead to allopatric speciation. From this perspective,
further investigation of species with a high dispersal
potential (e.g., pelagic/planktonic forms) is critically
needed to assess whether, on the circum-continental
scale, this trait results in a genetic homogenization of
the gene pool preventing further evolution.
Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a holoplanktonic
species that is probably the most abundant multicellular
organism on the planet [24], with a biomass estimation
of 44 million tonnes in the Southwest Atlantic sector of
the Southern Ocean [25]. Euphausia superba is one of
the best-studied pelagic invertebrates, with numerous
studies since the 1920s and 1930s [26,27] and a key species in the Southern Ocean’s marine ecosystem. It occupies a central role in the Antarctic food web as the
main food source for Antarctic fish, penguins, pelagic
seabirds, seals, and whales, and also sustains the largest
single-species crustacean fishery in the world [28].
Euphausia superba has a circumpolar distribution and
shows typical swarming behaviour that leads to local
aggregations and produces a typical patchy distribution.
Although very few large-scale studies have shown

Page 2 of 18

obvious correlation between krill distribution and current systems (but see [27]), it has been suggested that
large-scale, heterogeneous distributions could be caused
by the gyral circulation pattern of Southern Ocean
water masses [29,30]. In fact, areas of higher adult krill
concentration are associated with the major oceanic
gyres, which are formed by interactions between the two
main surface currents: the eastward-flowing Antarctic
Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the westward-flowing
Coastal Current (CC). These currents play an important
role in krill dispersal, since both adults and larvae can
be passively transported among areas of high krill
abundance.
To ensure the sustainable harvesting of krill in the
Southern Ocean, CCAMLR (Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) was
designed in 1981 to set precautionary catch limits. For
the Southwest Atlantic sector, the limit was 1.5 million
tons per year. Sound management of the krill fishery
requires fundamental knowledge of krill distribution;
accurate estimation of abundance, biomass, and flux
among areas; detailed understanding of life history; and
characterization of genetic differentiation among
populations.
Unfortunately, Southern Ocean krill have proven to
be an unyielding organism for the isolation of highresolution genetic markers, such as microsatellites
[31,32]. Early studies using allozymic allelic frequencies indicated genetic homogeneity across the entire
distribution range, with several exceptions [33-35].
More recently, Zane et al. [36] studied the genetic
structure of E. superba using a portion of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase gene (ND1) and found
weak but significant genetic differentiation (Fst =
0.0213; p < 0.05) among samples, based on rather limited sampling in the Weddell Sea and near South
Georgia. The authors hypothesized that Weddell Sea
gyre and/or the Weddell-Scotia Confluence could be
responsible for the reduced gene flow between these
two areas. Nonetheless, the possibility that the
observed genetic differentiation could result from temporal (rather than spatial) variability could not be
excluded, since the samples were collected in different
years. Evidence of small-spatial scale genetic heterogeneity, based on SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in mitochondrial cytochrome b, has been
reported by Batta-Lona et al. [37] among samples and
life stages of E. superba in the Western Antarctic
Peninsula (WAP). In contrast, no genetic differences
in haplotype frequencies for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) were reported
among swarms of E. superba collected at the local
scale [38], although COI did reveal heterogeneity
among samples of E. crystallorophias (a sister species

Bortolotto et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/32

to E. superba) collected from the same region [39].
This latter suggests that differences among krill
swarms or perhaps cohorts might explain part of the
observed genetic differentiation, especially at small- to
regional geographic scales. It is therefore important
that population genetics studies in general - and for
krill in particular - investigate genetic variation associated with a range of both geographic and temporal
scales, as also proposed by Siegel [26]. In addition,
genetic differentiation among krill stocks in different
regions should consider biological processes (e.g., life
stages, population cohorts, and swarms), as proposed
by Batta-Lona et al. [37] and should be based upon
multiple samples collected from each region.
The present study extends the analysis of the population structure of E. superba by taking into account
samples collected from different areas and in different
years. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing (ND1) and
three microsatellite markers obtained by data mining
from an E. superba cDNA library [40] were employed
as molecular markers. New mitochondrial sequence
information was obtained and combined with the
mitochondrial data from Zane et al. [36] in order to
study both spatial and temporal variability of krill
genetic structure. Mitochondrial data were also analyzed to determine whether the Southern Ocean krill
species population has experienced fluctuations in size
at evolutionary time scales, and also to amend previous
estimates of population expansion. Microsatellites data
were included to increase the analytical power, since
these markers are known to be more polymorphic than
mtDNA [41]. This study describes new scenarios for
krill population dynamics and structure based upon
analysis of the largest and most extensive collection of
E. superba DNA analyzed to date.

Methods
Sample collection and DNA extraction

Samples analysed in this study were obtained during
several cruises to the Southwest Atlantic and Pacific
(Ross Sea) sectors of the Southern Ocean (Table 1; Figure 1). For the analysis of mitochondrial variability,
sequences were obtained for 8 new population samples
and merged with previously published data [36], yielding
a total of 12 population samples. Genetic analyses using
nuclear loci were performed using 10 population samples (DNA from B-1992 and W-1992 samples were no
longer available; Table 1).
Total genomic DNA was extracted from 5 - 10 mg of
muscle tissue of each individual using a salting-out protocol [42]. The DNA solution was stored at -20°C before
PCR amplification.
Molecular population genetic analysis of mitochondrial
DNA

A ~200 base-pair portion of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) was amplified using specific primers for E.
superba: ND1aR, 5’-GGCAAAAATCTTTTCCAGGCTAAGTA-3’, and ND1F, 5’-TTTTTCTTGTGTTGTACTAGTTTAGG-3’ [36]. One μl of total genomic DNA
was used in 10 μl of reaction mix (50 mM KCl, 10 mM
Tris-HCl, 0.1% TritonX-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 17.5 μM of
each dNTPs and 0.5 μM of each primer) with 0.2 unit of
Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin,
USA). The thermal cycler program was: (i) pre-denaturation at 94°C for 2 min; (ii) 35 cycles of denaturation
at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 49°C for 30 sec, extension at 72°C for 40 sec; and (iii) final extension for 5
min at 72°C.
The fragments were sequenced using the ND1aR primer in an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 3100 or

USA) after enzymatic purification. Chromatograms were
examined, manually edited using ChomasPro 1.41
(Technelysium Pty) and aligned using GENEDOC
2.6.002 [43]. Aligned sequences were combined with
published data from Zane et al. [36] and analyzed
together.
Genealogical relationships among sequences were
reconstructed using the TCS program [44], which calculates the frequency of each haplotype in the sample and
uses parsimony to create a network of haplotypes; the
default 95% cut-off was used.
Analyses of genetic variability, differentiation among
populations, deviation from mutation-drift equilibrium,
and historical demography were performed using Arlequin 3.11 [45] and DNAsp 4.50.3 [46]. Genetic variability was measured by haplotype diversity (h) and
nucleotide diversity (π; [47]).
Population genetic structure was investigated by Analysis of MOlecular VAriance, (AMOVA; [48]), which
partitions the total variance into covariance components
and verifies the hierarchical or non-hierarchical distribution of the variability as follows: among populations
(fixation index Fst), among populations within groups
(Fsc), and among groups (Fct). The analyses were performed using Kimura-2-Parameter molecular distances

[49]; given the limited divergence between haplotypes,
very similar results were obtained using different distances. The statistical significance of the fixation indices
was assessed under the null hypothesis of panmixia by
performing 10,000 permutations of the original data set
by random reallocation of individuals to each population
and of populations to each group. In addition, pairwise
Fst values were calculated between all populations and
the significance tested as above.
Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analysis
were used to investigate signatures of past demographic
events that affected the populations. Neutrality tests,
which were developed to test the neutral hypothesis
under an infinite-site model with constant population
size [50], were used to infer past population size based
upon deviation from the mutation-drift equilibrium [51].
In particular, Tajima’s D [[51], Fu’s Fs [52] and Rozas’s
R2 [53] tests were performed. Tajima’s D test calculates
the value of D (i.e., the ratio of two different estimations
of the parameter θ), which for mtDNA is twice the product of the effective population size and the substitution
rate; D is expected to be negative if the population has
experienced an expansion. Fu’s Fs test evaluates the
probability of observing a random neutral sample with
the same or fewer alleles than the observed value,
assuming the same number of pairwise differences (an

Bortolotto et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/32

estimator of θ). The FS statistic is very sensitive to population demographic expansion, which generally leads to
large negative FS values. Rozas’s R2 test considers the
difference between the number of the singleton substitutions and the average number of nucleotide differences.
This statistic is appropriate to distinguish population
growth from constant size population; lower values of
R2 are expected under a population expansion event and
R2 is more powerful than Fu’s FS for small sample sizes.
Rogers and Harpending [54] showed that demographic
events in populations affect the distribution of the
observed pairwise differences between haplotypes or
DNA sequences, which they termed the mismatch distribution. For a population at equilibrium of size, with
no recombination and under an infinite site model, the
mismatch curve fits a Poisson distribution. For a population that has undergone demographic expansion, the
distribution of pairwise differences between haplotypes
assumes a unimodal curve. The model assumes an initial
population size θ0 at time 0 (θ0 = 2N0u) that grows to a
new size θ1 (θ1 = 2N1u), where N is the population size
and u is the substitution rate for the whole haplotype.
The position of the mean (τ) in the mismatch distribution is used to infer the start of the expansion by the
equation τ = 2ut, where u is the substitution rate for the
whole haplotype and t is the time.
Molecular population genetic analysis of microsatellite
markers

An Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database specific for
E. superba [40] was mined to identify microsatellite or
Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) markers in transcripts.
A total of 1,770 ESTs was examined using MISA
(MIcroSAtellite identification tool) software [55] and
Tandem Repeat Finder [56] to detect tandemly repeated
sequences. To maximize the number of informative
markers, the search included compound and interrupted
microsatellites of any SSR motif, excluding mononucleotide stretches. SSRs containing sequences with enough
flanking region were selected and primers were designed
using PRIMER3 [57]. One μl of total genomic DNA was
used for each amplification, using the same PCR mix
described for mitochondrial markers. The thermal cycler
profile was: (i) pre-denaturation at 94°C for 2 min; (ii)
35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing
at 55 or 52°C for 30 sec, extension at 72°C for 30 s; and
(iii) final extension for 5 min at 72°C. Forward primers
were labelled with different fluorescent dyes and a fraction of the PCR product was loaded on an ABI PRISM
3100 or 3700 automated DNA sequencer. ROX-400 was
used as size standard. Allele sizes were assigned using
GENOTYPER 3.7 (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City,
California, USA).

Departures from Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium were tested with the exact test implemented in
the software GENEPOP[58]. Genetic population structure and temporal stability were investigated as before
by hierarchical and non-hierarchical AMOVA and pairwise Fst statistics, implemented in Arlequin 3.01 [48].
FreeNA [59] was used to test the occurrence of null
alleles and estimate their frequencies for each locus and
population analyzed based upon the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm [60].
Estimation of long-term effective population size was
conducted using the Bayesian method in LAMARC
2.1.3. [61], a Markov chain Monte Carlo coalescent genealogy sampler. The program estimates θ= 4Neμ (where
Ne is the effective population size and μ is the nuclear
mutation rate per generation), together with the exponential growth rate g. The parameter g is the exponent
of the exponential growth rate formula that gives the θ
at a time t in terms of the modern-day θ and the growth
rate: θ (t) = θ e -gt . Ten initial brief chains (to get the
driving values) and two final chains (to narrow the final
values) with 20 million genealogies were generated; sampling was done every 1,000 genealogies, with a burn-in
of 1,000 iterations. Mutation was modeled using a Brownian-motion approximation to the stepwise model [62].
Bayesian priors for θ and g were drawn from uniform
distributions (1-5<θ < 100; -5,000 < g < 10,000). In order
to increase the maximum allowed θ for the data set, the
relative mutation rate of each locus was set to 150.
TRACER 1.4 was used to check the convergence of the
chains [63]. Estimates of θ and g were re-scaled and the
effective population size (N e ) was estimated from θ
using the equation Ne= θ/4 μ and assuming a mutation
rate of μ = 5 × 10 -4 per generation, which was intermediate between two widely-used estimates: 10 -3 and
10-4 (the former extremely high, the latter too conservative [64,65]).
Forward-time genetic simulations and assessment of
statistical power

The statistical power of our dataset was tested in order
to establish the extent to which nuclear and mitochondrial data are able to detect genetic heterogeneity
between samples. To this end, we simulated populations
at a known level of divergence, performed non-hierarchical AMOVA on replicates of the simulated dataset (N
= 100) and recorded the fraction of simulated populations for which genetic homogeneity was rejected (a =
0.05). Simulations were carried out using simuPOP [66],
a flexible forward-time population genetics simulation
environment that allows generation of individuals characterized by both diploid genotypes (microsatellite loci)
and sequence haplotypes (mitochondrial DNA fragment)

Bortolotto et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/32

and provides appropriate mutation models and inheritance transmission schemes for both kind of markers.
In particular, 10 populations were simulated, corresponding to samples for which both nuclear and mitochondrial data were available (Table 1). Sex ratio was
assumed to be 1:1 and estimates of long-term effective
population size (see above) were used to set the population size parameter to N = 40,000. A multilocus genotype for 3 diploid loci and a sequence haplotype for 1
haploid locus was assigned to each simulated individual,
based on the frequencies of microsatellite alleles and
ND1 sequences observed in the empirical dataset. A
stepwise mutation model with a rate of 5 × 10-4 mutations per generation was assumed for microsatellites
[65], while for mtDNA a K-allele model was used with a
locus substitution rate of 3 × 10 -6, resulting from the
canonical 1% substitutions per site per million years [38]
and locus sequence length of approximately 154 bp,
with a generation time of approximately 2 years [36].
Individuals were allowed to sexually reproduce with a
random mating scheme for a predefined number of generations; at each generation parents died after reproduction and offspring received their alleles by mendelian
inheritance and the mother mtDNA haplotype by clonal
transmission. At the end of each simulation, the appropriate number of multilocus genotypes and haplotypes
(matching samples size of the empirical dataset) was
collected from each simulated population, formatted
separately for the diploid and haploid loci, and analysed
with Arlequin v 3.01, with the same settings used for
the empirical dataset. Fst/Fst values and their significances were recorded.
Simulations were performed under a pure drift model,
with the effective number of migrants per generation
(Nm) set to 0 using an approach similar to Ryman and
Palm [67], and by setting Nm = 1 and 5, corresponding
to thresholds proposed to define separate populations
[68]. The populations were allowed to diverge for 100,
200, 300, and 400 generations to generate Fst values
ranging from 0.001 to 0.004 for microsatellites and from
0.004 to 0.02 for mtDNA. For a each of the 12 set of
parameters simulated (corresponding to 3 migration
regimes × 4 drifting amounts), 100 replicates were performed and the fraction of significant Fst/Fst values
obtained from replicated simulations was taken as an
estimate of the power to detect heterogeneity under the
specific scenario.

Results
Mitochondrial DNA

The new sequence analysis for 393 specimens obtained
in this study was combined with published data from
Zane et al. [36], yielding a new data set of 641
sequences of 154 base pairs from 12 population samples.

Page 6 of 18

All sequences have been submitted to GenBank (Additional file 1, Table S1). Thirty-six new haplotypes were
detected in the new population samples, for a total of
124 haplotypes in the combined dataset. Analysis of
polymorphic sites implemented by DnaSP [46] identified
46 variable sites (18 of which were singletons that
occurred in a single individual) and 28 parsimony informative sites. Some of these sites showed multiple substitutions; for the entire dataset, a total of 59 substitutions
was detected. Considering synonymous and replacement
changes using Drosophila mtDNA code, 3 singleton substitutions were detected that caused an amino acid
change: from Alanine to Serine (position 105); from Serine to Cysteine (position 120); and from Valine to Isoleucine (position 134). The average value of haplotype
diversity (h) was 0.8561 (range from 0.8271 to 0.8889),
while average value of nucleotide diversity (π) was
0.013937 (range from 0.01196 to 0.01642; Table 2).
A network representation was used to infer haplotype
genealogies using TCS [44]. The high number of rare
haplotypes produced a complex cladogram; in order to
avoid this complexity, networks are reported for each
population sample (Figure 2). The distribution of haplotypes in the populations did not show evidence of geographic structure. In fact, frequent haplotypes (e.g. 8, 12,
51, 52 and 58) were shared among all the populations
and differences were due only to rare haplotypes, often
present in a single individual (Additional file 1, Table
S1).
Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [48] was
performed using both non-hierarchical (i.e., all populations in one group) and hierarchical designs (i.e., populations subdivided into two geographical groups
corresponding to Southern Ocean South Atlantic and
Pacific sectors; Table 3). All the variation (100%) was
due to within-population differences and no evidence
for subdivision into genetically distinct populations or
groups of populations was found. Genetic homogeneity
was also confirmed by negative or close to zero pairwise
Fst values; P-values were not significant after Bonferroni
correction (Table 4). As in the previous study by Zane
et al. [36], pairwise Fst values for comparisons between
samples of Weddell Sea and South Georgia 1994 were
significant at the P = 0.05 level (Fst = 0.02130, P =
0.03320). A similar result was obtained in this study
between two temporal replicates from South Georgia
(Fst = 0.02438, P = 0.02930).
Results of neutrality tests and associated P-values are
reported in Table 5. Both Tajima’s D [51] and Fu’s Fs
[52] tests assumed negative values in each population.
Fu’s Fs and R2 [53] associated probabilities were highly
significant in each population. When pooling samples
together, Tajima’s D provided strong support for the
departure from mutation-drift equilibrium (Table 5).

The past demographic history was further investigated
by mismatch distribution. The observed data distribution was unimodal (Figure 3), indicating that the population experienced a demographic expansion in the past
[29], with a peak at τ = 2.496 and confidence interval
(CI) = 0.438-5.607.
Microsatellite markers

Among 1,170 ESTs [40], 68 sequences contained di-, tri, tetra-, penta- and esanucleotide repeats that are potentially useful for population genetics analysis. As expected
for coding sequences, the most common repeat module
found was the trinucleotide, with different combinations
of pure, compound and interrupted microsatellites.
Many ESTs were discarded because they presented
microsatellites with long repeats interrupted by up to
100 bp. Only 12 sequences with enough flanking regions
for appropriate primer design were found. For each of
these 12 sequences, three or four primers were designed
and tested on 8 individuals to increase the probability of
obtaining good amplifications with clear and unique
amplified products (Additional file 2, Table S2). Due to
an unexpectedly high rate of unsuccessful amplification,
only seven loci were selected for preliminary genotyping
and forward primers were labelled with fluorescent dyes.
Preliminary genotyping analysis of the selected microsatellite markers detected two monomorphic loci, which
were excluded. Two additional loci were discarded that
were characterized by an unusual profile, with more
than two alleles for each individual. The remaining
three loci were used for population genetic analysis
(Table 6). These were shown to be in linkage equilibrium. Locus A 11 and B 22 were in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium for each population sample; low probabilities associated with the exact test (P HW < 0.001)

indicated strong disequilibrium at locus N 11 for each
sample. Since disequilibrium was detected only for this
locus, the occurrence of null alleles appeared to be the
most probable explanation and allelic and genotypic frequencies were re-calculated for locus N11 using FreeNA
[59].
Allelic frequencies were remarkably similar between
samples; few private alleles, with a very low frequency
(average 0.0153), were found. Accordingly, as for
mtDNA, the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
[23] for loci A11, B22, and N11 was performed both for
all samples together and for two separate geographical
groups (Table 7). The results indicated that almost all
variation (99.74%) was due to within-population differences; subdivision in different populations or different
groups was not supported, in agreement with the
mtDNA data. Genetic homogeneity detected by the
AMOVA analysis was confirmed by pairwise Fst analysis
(Table 8). In fact, Fst values for all pairwise comparisons
were negative or close to zero, with associated P-values
that were not statistically significant. Similar results
were obtained by calculating AMOVA and pairwise Fst
without correcting locus N 11 for null alleles and by
excluding locus N11 suggesting that the presence of null
alleles for locus N11 did not affect the analysis of population structure (data not shown). Comparison between
the two samples from South Georgia did not show heterogeneity (Fst = -0.00120, P = 0.46847), in contrast to
the marginal heterogeneity found with mtDNA.
Estimates of the parameters θ and g (used to estimate
long-term effective population size) are reported in
Table 9. These estimates, inferred by a coalescent-based
genealogical method [61], were calculated using only
locus A11 and B22, since locus N11 showed an allelic pattern that did not follow the stepwise mutation model.

Estimates of θ among populations ranged from 23.10 for
R-1997 (CI = 7.66 - 3,742) to 212.59 for EI-2007 (CI =
34.17 - 10,435). These values were rescaled with the
relative mutation rate set to 150; the resulting 95%

confidence intervals (CI) were very wide, probably due
to the few numbers of loci analyzed. Assuming a mutation rate of μ = 5 × 10-4, the long-term Ne value could
range from 11,554 (CI = 3,830-1,871,000) to 106,295 (CI

= 17,000-5,217,500). Growth rate (g) was also estimated
using the same method. The point estimates were positive for all the population samples, ranging from 0.95
for R-1997 to 8.10 for R-1994. The 95% CI excluded
zero, except for R-1997 (CI = -0.009 - 7.67) and overlapped between all population samples. Positive values
of the g parameter, with CI excluding zero, are an indication that the population has been growing in the past.
Forward-time genetic simulations and assessment of
statistical power

Since our study was carried out with a limited number
(3) of microsatellite markers and a single mtDNA fragment, the statistical power of our dataset was assessed
using a simulation approach (Table 10). The power of
the 3 microsatellite loci to detect genetic heterogeneity
was estimated on the basis of the observed number of
loci, observed average allele frequencies, and sample
sizes similar to those used in this work. Results
showed that the analysed microsatellites reached a
power of 0.86 (on a scale of 0-1) to detect an average
Fst of 0.0045 after 400 generations of pure drift (Table
9). However, for a smaller extent of drift, or assuming

one to five migrants per generation (values that define
a “strict” or “relaxed” genetic threshold for isolated
populations according to Waples and Gaggiotti [68]),
the percentage of rejections of the null hypothesis of
genetic homogeneity dropped considerably (Table 9).
This holds true also for values of Fst close to those
observed in our empirical microsatellite dataset (i.e.,
0.00299, Table 7). When considering simulations based
on a mitochondrial dataset, positive values of Fst are
expected (on average) in all scenarios, which is in
sharp contrast to the experimental results obtained
from the analysis of ND1 sequences (Fst = -0.0023;
Table 3). Simulations obtained from a combined
microsatellite + mtDNA dataset (possible in virtual
simuPOP by jointly modelling haploid sequences and
diploid microsatellite genotypes) clearly showed that a
statistical power higher than 80% to detect genetic heterogeneity with at least one marker was achieved after
300 generations of divergence under all scenarios.
These results suggest that our markers can provide an
accurate picture of the large scale pattern of genetic
population structure of E. superba, unless the differentiation is more recent than 300 generations.

Discussion
The present study is aimed at investigating the levels of
genetic variation and historical demography of E.
superba using both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers for an unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of populations over a circum-Antarctic range.
Analyses of species with putatively weak population
genetic structure such as E. superba should be ideally

conducted by means of hyper-variable markers such as
microsatellites, suitable to detect subtle genetic differences between populations. This approach proved problematic in krill, due to low efficiency of the markers’
isolation protocol and redundant genomic sequence portions. Considerable effort was made to isolate nuclear
DNA microsatellite markers specific to E. superba using
the FIASCO protocol [41]. However, this resulted in an
extremely limited number of loci containing microsatellites. In addition, a large portion of the isolated loci
were characterized by complex structure that made
them unsuitable for population genetics studies [32],
suggesting that Antarctic krill may have some peculiarity
in genomic organization and/or composition. Given
these difficulties, we used a specific ESTs dataset for E.
superba [40] to identify EST-linked microsatellites. This
approach yielded a limited number of microsatellites
suitable for population genetic analysis. Again, many
loci showed multiple alleles per individual, incompatible
with simple Mendelian inheritance. Sequences were
characterised by long stretches of Thymine (T) and
Adenine (A), in keeping with old reports of strong A/T
bias in base composition in krill genome [31].
Despite these limitations, the few microsatellites used
in this work provide important support and new perspectives that complement the results obtained from
mitochondrial sequences. In fact, the forward time
simulation approach, which represents to our knowledge
the first attempt to jointly model nuclear and mitochondrial markers in a population genetic context for a nonmodel organism, shows that the present dataset is
endowed with considerable power to detect genetic heterogeneity, because of very large sample size and despite
the low number of loci considered. We can, therefore,
confidently accept the results from the mtDNA and
nuclear empirical dataset, which indicate small, not significant, genetic differences among samples and pinpoint
panmixia of Antarctic krill populations on a large geographic scale, but leave open the possibility for local
genetic patchiness. Neutrality test associated with analysis of mismatch distribution carried out for the ND1
mitochondrial gene revealed strong signals of past population expansion. This was confirmed by positive values
of the parameter, g, a measure of population growth
obtained from microsatellite markers with a pattern that
further supports a recent origin of the population
expansion.
Lack of genetic heterogeneity on the circum-Antarctic
scale

Comparison of mitochondrial ND1 sequences among 12
populations from the Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the
Southern Ocean showed a lack of genetic structuring, as
suggested by negative or not significant values of Fst.

Pairwise Fst based on allelic frequencies variation using locus A11, B22, and N11 with P-values calculated by 10000 permutations of the original dataset;
significance threshold a = 0.00111 after multiple test correction.

Similarly, analysis of molecular variance based on 3
microsatellite loci did not reveal significant genetic differentiation among populations. These results are indicative of high levels of gene flow over a large geographic
range, preventing the formation of genetically isolated
gene pools. Although the absence of statistically significant differences cannot be equated with proof against
genetic structure, the statistical power of our dataset,
estimated by the forward simulation approach, suggests
that the level of genetic divergence must be exceedingly
small to have remained undetected (Table 10). This
result is somewhat counterintuitive, considering both
the small number of microsatellites and the very short
ND1 sequence used; it is due to the large sampling used
in this study and to the very high number of haplotypes
found at the ND1 locus. In particular, 29% (46 of 154)
of the ND1 sites were variable - very close to the 33% of
third positions available in the dataset. This can result in
a potential saturation problem that is expected to
increase the chances of obtaining haplotypes identicalin-state but not by descent, thus blurring any eventual

phylogeographic pattern. However, the very high number of haplotypes results in a high chance to detect differences in haplotypic frequencies, as evidenced by our
simulation approach (Table 10), thus partially compensating the problem.
We can speculate about the causes of such genetic
homogeneity and several reasons can be invoked to
explain our finding. The circum-Antarctic current system may play an active role in mixing krill populations, thus favouring the maintenance of a single
randomly-mating unit. In fact, the entire life history of
E. superba is influenced by the Southern Ocean current systems: females are thought to perform a spawning migration in deep water, eggs are laid in the
eastward-flowing ACC current, embryos perform a
“developmental ascent” migrating upward, and juveniles spend the winter under the ice that is drifted by
the currents [[69,70], but see also [71]]. The lack of
large scale genetic structuring might then simply
reflect the tight link between krill and circum-Antarctic marine currents.

Ten populations of individuals with 3 diploid loci and one sequence haplotype, initialized with the empirical microsatellites and mitochondrial dataset, were
simulated and allowed to diverge with a predefined number of migrants (Nm) for a fixed number of generations (Gen) before data collection and analysis with
AMOVA. For each set of parameters one hundred replicates were performed. Reported are the mean Fst recorded and the percentage of dataset providing
significant differences across replicates for microsatellites (μsat mean Fst and μsat power) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA mean Fst and mtDNA power). In
addition the percentage of cases in which at least one marker detected significant differences is reported in the last column.

Genetic patchiness at the local scale?

A previous study by Zane et al. [36] found significant
mtDNA genetic heterogeneity among samples collected
from the Weddell Sea and near South Georgia; the
authors suggested that the Weddell-Scotia Confluence
and the Weddell gyre could act as oceanographic barriers, leading to genetic differentiation between populations in the two regions. In the present paper, we
increased the number of analysed samples from 249 specimens in four population samples [36] to 642 specimens in 12 population samples (including temporal
replicates). The results obtained by this expanded dataset confirmed the weak differentiation between Weddell
Sea and South Georgia 1994 (Fst = 0.02130, P = 0.033),
samples shared with the Zane et al. [36] dataset, but significance was not achieved after correction for multiple
tests due to the larger number of samples considered. In
addition, a similar value of Fst was also observed
between the two replicated samples collected during
1994 and 1997 from South Georgia (Fst = 0.02438, P =
0.029), ruling out the possibility that the former result
can be explained by the presence of stable geographically isolated populations.
The biological meaning of these subtle differences is
uncertain, because the differences reported here are very
small and not significant after multiple test correction,
and thus could simply represent false positives. On the
other hand, they can reflect biological or physical processes at other spatial and/or temporal scales, making
the correction procedure inappropriate. In fact, interannual variation of krill biomass due to variable recruitment rates is well known in the South Georgia region
[72] and, based on oceanographic modelling, it has been
suggested that recruitment in this area relies on

reproduction in the Antarctic Peninsula [73]. Recent
observations indicate the presence of multiple spawning
and larval development sites in the West Antarctic
Peninsula [71,74] and several factors can affect the successful transport of krill to the S. Georgia area, including
the location and timing of spawning and the annual variation of the position of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF), potentially leading to
random variation in the genetic composition of local
recruits [75]. A recent independent study based on
Cytochrome b SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)
analysis of different life stages collected in the Western
Antarctic Peninsula [37] provides strong support for this
hypothesis. In fact, while no overall differences were
found between 2001 and 2002 collection years, significant differences occurred among samples from the same
area collected in the same year, and differentiation was
particularly evident among samples when furcilia larval
stages were analysed separately [37]. These results indicate a stage-specific patchiness that might result from
the advection and persistence of cohorts of larvae from
diverse spawning sites or from discrete spawning events,
if they involve a limited number of breeders. In fact,
fine-scale genetic patchiness can result from temporal
variation of numbers and genotypes of recruits delivered
locally [75] and it is commonly believed to arise from
instantaneous drift effects [76] for which the genetic
pool of recruits can change from time to time due to
random effects. Following Hedgecock’s [77] hypothesis
of sweepstakes reproductive success, temporal variance
in allelic frequencies may result from stochasticity in
reproductive activity and oceanographic conditions conducive to fertilization, larval development, retention and
recruitment. Under this hypothesis, many individuals fail

Bortolotto et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/32

to contribute to recruitment and this variance may
result in changes in allelic frequencies when differences
in allelic composition among spawning groups are present. Hedgecock [77] attributed the variation in reproductive success of adults to spatio-temporal variation in
oceanographic conditions that occur within and among
seasons. Considering that genetic patchiness does not
require stable genetic differentiation of populations and
unpatterned variation has indeed been found in many
noticeable cases in species with very weak differentiation
on the large scale [i.e. [78-81]], it is possible that this
phenomenon may occur in Antarctic krill, as suggested
by Batta-Lona et al. [37]. This finding is not in conflict
with the lack of differentiation at large geographic scales
found in our study. From this point of view, weak but
recurrent temporal or small-scale differences observed
for krill [33-35] might result from oscillations associated
with recruitment processes. Multi-year investigations
that incorporate environmental data and focus on krill
populations from areas with high variation in recruitment, such as S. Georgia, are therefore needed before
dismissing small-scale heterogeneity as “ecologically
uninformative” [82].
Strong and recent population expansion in krill

Analysis of the mtDNA ND1 fragment for 642 samples
confirmed its high sequence polymorphism, with 124
haplotypes observed and an average value of π = 0.013.
This variability is particularly high considering the
length of the fragment (154 bp) and comparing the
variability of a 155 bp fragment of the same gene in M.
norvegica (35 haplotypes over 982 individuals, π =
0.005) [83]. Jarman et al. [39] found 82 haplotypes
among 232 individuals for a mtCOI gene segment of
665 bp in E. crystallorophias. High polymorphism of the
ND1 mitochondrial gene portion for E. superba could
be ascribed to the departure from the mutation-drift
equilibrium, resulting in the retention of rare haplotypes. In fact, haplotype diversity (h = 0.85) indicates
that about 85% of the haplotypes occur only once in the
entire dataset. The hypothesis of departure from mutation-drift equilibrium is suggested also by the haplotype
network reconstruction, which reveals a star-like tree
topology. Rare haplotypes are derived from frequent
ones by few substitutions and the tree topology is thus
compressed near the root [54]. High numbers of rare
haplotypes - leading to the departure from mutationdrift equilibrium - is a clear indication of past population expansion. This hypothesis is also supported by the
concordant results of the neutrality tests that allow
rejection of the mutation-drift equilibrium hypothesis
with high confidence. An alternative explanation that
selection acts on mtDNA sequences and causes departure from equilibrium seems unlikely, considering that

Page 14 of 18

only 3 substitutions are non-synonymous over 59 substitutions recorded. Variation of population size better
explains the non-equilibrium condition of E. superba, as
suggested by the analysis of mismatch distribution. The
distribution of pairwise differences between haplotypes
was a better fit to the theoretical distribution curve for a
population that experienced a demographic expansion,
peaking approximately at τ = 2.50. This value is higher
than that obtained by Zane et al. [36] based on fewer
samples (τ = 1.66).
If accurate estimation of the substitution rate u was
possible, the peak of the curve (τ) could be related to the
time at which the population expansion started. Unfortunately, no calibration of rates is possible for pelagic
organisms lacking fossil records (such as euphausiids)
and the use of previously-calculated “universal” rates [36]
is not straightforward, due to rate variation among
lineages (see e.g., [84]). In addition, it has been recently
shown that rates calibrated in a phylogenetic context
should be applied with caution to intraspecific studies,
because this could result in over-estimation of divergence
times and expansion peaks, since many of the polymorphisms seen at the population level are lost over
longer evolutionary time frames [85]. As a matter of fact,
importing the crustacean phylogenetic universal rates as
in [36] to the present dataset would result in a time of
start for krill expansion ranging between 0.1 million to
more than 1 million years (taking into account the confidence interval of τ). This time window is concordant
with recent results based on a Bayesian skyride approach,
using a different marker and a slightly different universal
rate [86], which showed that the most recent doubling in
abundance occurred within the last 100 000 years [38].
Given the possible overestimation due to time dependency of these values, which could be as high as 10-20
fold older than the correct ones [85], it is conservative to
consider them as maximum ages for expansion, bearing
in mind that they could be close to the true value in the
case of little or no time dependency of the molecular
clock calibrations [87,88].
A specific estimation of divergence rate for euphausiids could be the only way to address the problem of
incorrect calculation of population expansion time and
to allow useful inference about the effect of paleoclimate
on krill population dynamics. This aspect is of particular
interest when considering that the Antarctic region has
experienced important climatic changes in the last 740
000 years, including temperature fluctuations ranging
between 8 to 10°C, with a cyclic pattern of about 100
000 years [89]. These fluctuations promoted migrations
of the marine fronts northward and southward, re-shaping the boundaries of the Southern Ocean and probably
affecting population dynamics of Antarctic pelagic species such as Antarctic krill. At present, based on the

Bortolotto et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:32
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/32

mtDNA marker, we can only point out that, given the
possible overestimation in divergence times, our value of
τ could in principle be very recent and potentially generated by expansion during the last glacial maximum,
when Antarctic planktonic ecosystems migrated equator-ward [90], in contrast to the picture reported before
for krill [36] and other Antarctic marine species [91,92].
Microsatellite analyses confirmed that Southern Ocean
krill experienced a strong population expansion in the
past. Growth rate estimates were positive for all population samples and the associated confidence interval was
significantly higher than zero in nine of ten cases. Non
significant differences between growth rates were
observed between samples (Table 10), which could
reflect distinct trajectories of growth linked, for instance,
to possible undetected genetic heterogeneity at the local
scale. However, considering that the growth rates
reported, estimated by the Bayesian approach implemented in LAMARC, refer to overall growth during the coalescent time in which polymorphisms accumulated in
the populations, it is more reasonable to assume that
such insignificant differences are simply linked to sampling errors. Thus, the approach used here is unable to
appropriately detect subtle differences in growth or,
since it is based on a simple exponential model, frequent population changes.
On the other hand, LAMARC allows calculation of
theta (θ) and estimation of the effective population size
using the exponential decay equation θt =θ now e-gt with
time toward the past expressed in mutational units [61].
Conservatively using the highest estimated value of theta
(212.59) and the smallest rate of growth (0.95; see Table
9), krill populations would have dropped 90% in the past
5,000 generations and have collapsed to as few as 10
effective individuals in less than 20,000 generations.
Thus, if the values estimated by LAMARC are realistic
and assuming a 2-3 year generation span [36,93], exponential growth (or decline backward in time) may have
occurred no longer than 60 000 to 40 000 years ago.
Using average values for θ and g (Table 10), krill population expansion may be as recent as a few thousands years.

Conclusions
The results reported in this work provide strong evidence
for lack of genetic heterogeneity of Antarctic krill at the
large geographic scale and unequivocal support for past
population growth. The lack of genetic structuring might
reflect the tight link between krill and circum-Antarctic
Ocean currents, whereas small-scale spatial and temporal
differentiation might be due to local conditions. Apparently, no geographical barriers limit the gene flow among
different areas. Since gene flow in marine species is largely due to dispersal capabilities of larval phases, it is
expected that species with high dispersal potential, such

Page 15 of 18

as E. superba, may exhibit low levels of population differentiation [94], whereas species with limited dispersal
and/or subject to geographical barrier may show a significant degree of genetic structuring [95]. In the case of
Antarctic krill, both mitochondrial and nuclear markers
point toward an overall panmictic condition, consistent
with the hypothesis that differentiation processes in Antarctic species is largely influenced by dispersal potential.
The signal of past population growth suggests the differential impact of glacial cycles on pelagic Antarctic species, for which glaciations possibly boosted population
expansions due to the increase of available habitat, in
contrast to benthic sedentary species, for which they are
believed to have promoted differentiation due to local
extinction and post-glacial re-colonization.
From a management perspective, it is important to
recognise that lack of genetic differentiation does not
imply that krill populations should be managed as a single
stock, since the amount of migration needed to maintain
populations genetically homogeneous is far smaller than
the amount required to make them demographically
undistinguishable. Using the threshold defined by Waples
and Gaggiotti [68] to define populations based on an ecological paradigm, up to 10% of individuals can be
exchanged each generation among populations that maintain their demographic independence, resulting in a maximum number of about 1,000-10,000 effective migrants
(Table 9). This level of exchange cannot be excluded with
our approach (Table 10) and would require many more
markers and sampling to directly estimate demographic
connectivity between locations [96,97].
Our study shows that microsatellite identification by
data mining of EST libraries is a powerful approach to
avoid failures associated with conventional enrichment
techniques in this species. However, considering our low
success rate (2 loci without null alleles from 68 candidates identified from 1,170 ESTs obtained with Sanger
sequencing, which in our opinion confirm some peculiarity of the krill genome), the isolation of a suite of
hypervariable markers for this species will require a concerted and comprehensive sequencing effort using high
throughput technologies.
