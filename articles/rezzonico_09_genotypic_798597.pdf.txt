Abstract
Background: Pantoea agglomerans strains are among the most promising biocontrol agents for a
variety of bacterial and fungal plant diseases, particularly fire blight of apple and pear. However,
commercial registration of P. agglomerans biocontrol products is hampered because this species is
currently listed as a biosafety level 2 (BL2) organism due to clinical reports as an opportunistic
human pathogen. This study compares plant-origin and clinical strains in a search for discriminating
genotypic/phenotypic markers using multi-locus phylogenetic analysis and fluorescent amplified
fragment length polymorphisms (fAFLP) fingerprinting.
Results: Majority of the clinical isolates from culture collections were found to be improperly
designated as P. agglomerans after sequence analysis. The frequent taxonomic rearrangements
underwent by the Enterobacter agglomerans/Erwinia herbicola complex may be a major problem in
assessing clinical associations within P. agglomerans. In the P. agglomerans sensu stricto (in the stricter
sense) group, there was no discrete clustering of clinical/biocontrol strains and no marker was
identified that was uniquely associated to clinical strains. A putative biocontrol-specific fAFLP
marker was identified only in biocontrol strains. The partial ORF located in this band corresponded
to an ABC transporter that was found in all P. agglomerans strains.
Conclusion: Taxonomic mischaracterization was identified as a major problem with P.
agglomerans, and current techniques removed a majority of clinical strains from this species.
Although clear discrimination between P. agglomerans plant and clinical strains was not obtained
with phylogenetic analysis, a single marker characteristic of biocontrol strains was identified which
may be of use in strain biosafety determinations. In addition, the lack of Koch's postulate fulfilment,
rare retention of clinical strains for subsequent confirmation, and the polymicrobial nature of P.
agglomerans clinical reports should be considered in biosafety assessment of beneficial strains in this
species.

Background
Pantoea agglomerans (Beijerinck 1888) comb. nov. [1], formerly Enterobacter agglomerans (Beijerinck 1888) Ewing
and Fife (1972), Erwinia herbicola (Löhnis 1911) Dye
1964 or Erwinia milletiae (Kawakami and Yoshida 1920)
Magrou 1937, is a Gram-negative bacterium that belongs
to the family of Enterobacteriaceae. P. agglomerans is primarily a plant epiphyte [2-4] commonly found in diverse
ecological niches including aquatic environments, soil or
sediments [5-7]. Several strains of P. agglomerans are sold
as commercial biological control agents (BCAs) against
the fire blight pathogen [Erwinia amylovora (Burrill 1882)
Winslow et al. 1999] on apple and pear trees [8,9]. P.
agglomerans strains are effective against other bacterioses,
such as basal kernel blight of barley [10] and post-harvest
fungal diseases of pome fruits [11-14]. Three commercial
P. agglomerans strains have recently been registered for
biocontrol of fire blight in New Zealand (BlossomBless™
strain P10c [15]), in the United States and in Canada
(BlightBan C9-1™ strain C9-1 [16]; Bloomtime™ strain
E325 [17]). The primary mode of action is competitive
exclusion which involves the occupation of sites otherwise colonized by the pathogen, but for some strains
reports also indicate the contribution of different antibiotics like herbicolins [16] pantocins [18-21], putatively
phenazine [22], and other unknown compounds [17].
Despite efficacy trials in commercial orchards demonstrating the potential of P. agglomerans biocontrol formulations as an alternative plant protection tool and their
approval in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as microbial pesticides http://
www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-PEST/2006/September/Day20/p8005.htm, registration efforts in Europe are hindered
by biosafety concerns stemming from clinical reports that
identify strains of P. agglomerans as opportunistic human
pathogens, and have resulted in the current classification
of this species as a biosafety level 2 (BL-2) organism in
Europe [23-27]. Biosafety classification differs among
countries; in the European Union, Directive 2000/54/EC
includes "Enterobacter spp." in the list of microorganisms
that are currently classified as a biosafety level 2 (BL-2),
while the German "Technische Regeln für Biologische
Arbeitsstoffe", TRBA 466 and Swiss regulations http://
www.bafu.admin.ch/publikationen/publikation/00594/
index.html?lang=de more explicitly identify P. agglomerans and its synonyms in BL-2. Several strains maintained
in culture collections throughout the world and the type
strain P. agglomerans LMG 1286T (= CDC 1461-61T =
NCTC 9381T = ICMP 3435T = ATCC 27155T) itself are
listed as clinical isolates [1]. Confirmed pathogenicity of
this species is difficult to ascertain, since clinical reports
involving P. agglomerans are typically of polymicrobial
nature, often involve patients that are already affected by
diseases of other origin, lack Koch's postulate fulfillment

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/204

or any pathogenicity confirmation, and diagnostic isolates are rarely conserved for confirmatory analysis [24].
There has been insufficient investigations as to whether
agriculturally beneficial isolates are distinct from clinical
isolates or harbor potential pathogenic determinants that
would justify current biosafety restrictions. Comparative
analysis of biocontrol and clinical strains, or examination
of virulence factors has been performed previously for
other 'Jekyll-Hyde' biocontrol species reported to contain
opportunistic pathogenic isolates, such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa [28-30], Serratia marcescens [31] and the Burkholderia cepacia complex [32,33]. Similar comparisons
have not been performed for P. agglomerans, leaving a gap
in knowledge critical to regulatory authorities.
The aim of our study was to perform a polyphasic genotypic and phenotypic analysis of P. agglomerans isolates of
diverse origin in order to understand whether clinical and
biocontrol (environmental) isolates can be distinguished
and have undergone a discrete evolution that would indicate specialization towards human pathogenicity or an
epiphytic lifestyle. The taxonomy of a collection of clinical
and plant isolates was assessed using fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (fAFLP) analysis of
total genomic DNA and sequence analyses of specific
genes (such as 16S rDNA gene rrs, gyrB encoding DNA
gyrase subunit B, and the P. agglomerans quorum-sensing
regulatory genes pagRI encoding homoserine lactone
receptor and synthase) [34]. The fAFLP analysis was used
as well to search for random molecular markers that could
serve as a simple and rapid discriminatory marker for clinical and biocontrol strains. Additionally, we examined the
distribution of some phenotypic and genotypic traits
among strains that may reflect adaptation to the different
lifestyles proposed for P. agglomerans, such as growth at
37°C for clinical isolates, presence of pantocin A genes or
sorbitol utilization for biocontrol strains, and presence of
type III secretion system (T3SS) for plant pathogenic
pathovars.

Methods
Bacterial strains
Thirty-two clinical isolates designated as P. agglomerans, E.
agglomerans, E. herbicola or Pantoea spp. were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, http:/
/www.atcc.org/), the Belgian Coordinated Collection of
Microorganisms (BCCM/LMG, http://bccm.belspo.be),
the
Institut
Pasteur
Collection
(CIP,
http://
www.crbip.pasteur.fr/), the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT, http://www.cect.org/) or received from the
Hospital de la Santa Crei Sant Pau (Barcelona, Spain) and
the Istituto Cantonale di Microbiologia (ICM, Bellinzona,
Switzerland). Eleven P. agglomerans strains with established biocontrol activity obtained from several sources

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/204

(including the three currently registered commercial
strains), twenty environmental isolates and three phytopathogenic strains, together with representative strains
of other Pantoea species and closely related genera such as
Erwinia, Pectobacterium and Brenneria, were included in
the study for comparison (see Additional file 1 - Table S1).
DNA extraction and PCR amplification
DNA of each bacterial isolate was extracted with the Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Dübendorf, Switzerland) from 1.5 ml aliquots of overnight
cultures at 28°C in Luria Bertani (LB) medium. Obtained
genomic DNA was quantified on a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, U.S.A.)
and 10-20 ng of genomic DNA were used for each PCR
reaction. Each PCR was performed in a total volume of 25
μl using 0.4 mM of each primer in a final concentration of
1× master mix of the HotStarTaq Master Mix Kit (Qiagen,
Basel, Switzerland). PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene rrs,
gyrB housekeeping gene, pagRI AHL receptor and synthase
genes, T3SS ATPase hrcN, and the insertion site of the P.
agglomerans genomic island carrying the pantocin genes
paaABC and these genes were performed. Primer
sequences and annealing temperature (Tm) for each PCR
are shown in Table 1. With the exception of the gyrB
amplification standard cycling conditions were used for
all PCRs with an initial denaturation and activation of the
HotStarTaq enzyme for 15 min at 95°C, followed by 35
cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at the
proper Tm for 45 s, plus 30 s of elongation at 72°C for
every 500 bp of expected amplicon size, ending with a
final elongation for 10 min at 72°C. The protocol for gyrB
amplification included, after the initial polymerase activation, 42 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, 30 s
annealing at 50°C where the annealing time increased by
2 s/cycle until 40 s were reached, plus 10 s elongation at
72°C where the extension time increased by 1 s/cycle

until 15 s are reached. Positive PCR amplification was verified by loading 5 μl of each reaction on a 1.2% agarose
gel.
Sequencing of 16S rDNA, gyrB and pagRI genes
PCR amplicons were purified from the PCR mix by washing twice with 50 μl of double-distilled water (ddH2O) on
a MultiScreen PCR Plate (Millipore, Molsheim, France),
resuspended in 30 μl of ddH2O, and quantified spectrophotometrically as described above. The cycle-sequencing
reaction was performed with 20-40 ng of purified PCR
product using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminators v1.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer instructions
employing the same primers used for PCR amplification.
For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, additional primers 16S609R and 16S-533R (Table 1) were used to obtain complete coverage of the amplicon. Cycle sequencing products were cleaned through water-swelled Sephadex G-50
columns (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) on
MultiScreen HV plates (Millipore) and sequenced on an
ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Obtained sequences
were assembled using the Sequencher software (version
4.0.5; Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, U.S.A.).
Phylogenetic analysis of sequencing data
Phylogenetic trees were generated on the basis of partial
16S rDNA, gyrB and pagRI sequences without choosing
any outgroup. DNA sequences were aligned with ClustalW [35]. Sites presenting alignment gaps were excluded
from analysis. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) program version 4.0 [36] was used to calculate evolutionary distances and to infer trees based on the
Minimum Evolution (ME) method using the Maximum
Composite Likelihood (MCL) formula. Nodal robustness
of the inferred trees was assessed by 1000-bootstrap replicates.

Identification of non-Pantoea strains
For those strains received as E. agglomerans, P. agglomerans
or Pantoea spp. from international culture collections but
not clustering with P. agglomerans in the 16S rDNA and
gyrB trees, identification was sought by blasting the
obtained nucleotide sequences in the NCBI database.
Since the best hits often led to poorly characterized or
obviously misdentified bacteria only the best match with
a secure identification was retained. Confidence of secure
identifications was based either on relatedness to the P.
agglomerans type strain or position in the BLAST distance
tree. In order to be considered trustworthy, obtained hits
were required to be flanked by sequences of representatives of the same species and not be part of a clade containing strains from related species with dissimilar
identification.
fAFLP analysis
The fAFLP pattern of strains identified by sequencing as P.
agglomerans sensu stricto (in the stricter sense taxonomically) was carried out following standard protocols with
minor modification [37-39]. Digestion of genomic DNA
and ligation to the restriction enzyme adaptors was performed simultaneously since a base-change incorporated
into the adaptors sequences hindered restoration of the
original restriction enzyme site upon ligation. Between
200-400 ng genomic DNA from each of the strains was
used for each reaction in a mix containing 5 units EcoRI
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 1 unit of MseI (Roche) and 1
unit of T4 DNA Ligase (Epicentre, Madison, U.S.A.), 5 mM
1,4-Dithio-DL-threitol (DTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs,
Switzerland), 200 μM ATP (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), 50 μg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 0.25 μM
of each EcoRI adaptor (EcoRI-F 5'-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACC-3', EcoRI-R 5'-AATTGGTACGCAGTCTAC-3') and
2.5 μM of each MseI adaptor (MseI-F 5'-GACGATGAGTCCTGAG-3', MseI-R 5'-TACTCAGGACTCAT-3') in a total
volume of 11.1 μl of 1× One-Phor-All Buffer PLUS (GE
Healthcare, Otelfingen, Switzerland). The reaction was
incubated for 3 h at 37°C and then heated for 15 min at
72°C. The digestion-ligation mixture was diluted 1:20
with nuclease-free water and 5 μl of the dilution were preamplified in a total volume of 20 μl with adaptor-specific
primers MseI-00 (5'-GATGAGTCCTGAGTAA-3') and
EcoRI-00 (5'-GACTGCGTACCAATTC-3'). The PCR mix

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/204

contained 1 unit Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), 0.2
mM dNTPs and 0.3 μM of each primer in 1× Taq DNA
polymerase buffer (MgCl2 1.5 mM) (Promega). The PCR
conditions consisted of an initial incubation for 5 min at
72°C to allow Taq DNA polymerase to fill the nick on the
ligated DNA strand, followed by 20 cycles of denaturation
at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s, plus 2 min of
elongation at 72°C, finishing with a final extension for 2
min at 72°C and 30 min incubation at 60°C. Each preamplification reaction was diluted 1:10 with nuclease-free
water and 5 μl of each dilution were used in the selective
amplification reactions, which were performed in a total
volume of 20 μl using one selective primer (0.3 μM) for
each restriction site in a final concentration of 1× HotStarTaq Master Mix Kit. The combinations of selective primers
used are listed in Table 2. Cycling conditions consisted of
an initial denaturation/activation at 94°C for 15 min and
20 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at
66°C for 30 s where the annealing temperaure was
decreased by 1°C/cycle until 56°C were reached, plus 2
min elongation at 72°C, followed by a final incubation at
60°C for 10 min. The PCR product was finally diluted
1:250 with nuclease-free water and 5 μl of each dilution
were used in the labelling reaction, which was carried out
under the same conditions as the selective amplification
reactions except for the substitution of the EcoRI+1 selective primer with a FAM fluorophor 5'-labelled EcoRI+00
(no selective nucleotides) primer. One microliter of each
reaction was mixed with 15 μl formamide containing 0.25
μl of LIZ500 standard (Applied Biosystems), denaturated
for 10 min at 95°C and loaded on an ABI 3130XL
sequencer (Applied Biosystems) for fAFLP fragment separation.
Analysis of fAFLP data
Raw data collected from the ABI 3130XL sequencer were
analyzed using the GeneMapper v4.0 software (Applied
Biosystems). To remove noise, only peaks with an absolute intensity greater than 200 (combinations CGC, TG)
or 300 (combinations GG, AT) were retained for final
analysis. The fAFLP profiles were converted into a binary
matrix of presence/absence of each peak and this data was
used to construct a UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group
Method with Arithmetic mean) dendrogram using the
MEGA software. Nodal robustness of the inferred trees

was assessed by 1000-bootstrap replicates. The fAFLP patterns of all strains were analyzed in order to identify peaks
that may be distinctive of either biocontrol or clinical isolates in agreement with the classification shown in Additional file 1 - Table S1.
Growth on sorbitol as sole carbon source
Growth ability of P. agglomerans strains on sorbitol was
studied using 200-μl microcultures in 100-well Bioscreen
C MBR system honeycomb plates (well volume 400 μl) at
24°C with regular shaking at 15-min intervals in M9 minimal medium containing 10 mM sorbitol as sole carbon
source. All strains were grown overnight in LB, collected
by centrifugation, and washed twice with sterile 0.9%
NaCl before being inoculated in M9 at an initial OD600 of
about 0.02. Growth curves were measured in triplicates by
periodically quantifying the absorbance through a 420- to
580-nm wide band filter (OD420-580 nm) using a Bioscreen
C MBR system (Growth Curves Oy, Helsinki, Finland).
Growth at 24°C and 37°C
Growth ability of selected P. agglomerans sensu stricto
strains was determined at 24°C and 37°C using the Bioscreen C MBR system. The protocol was the similar to that
described above for growth on sorbitol, except that LB
medium was used in place of minimal medium. The
mean growth rate per hour (k) was calculated each 20
minutes according to the formula

k=

log N t − log N 0
log 2× Δt

where N0 and Nt represent absorbance measured at two
consecutive time points and Δt is the time interval (i.e., 1
h) between the two measurements. The highest optical
density, the maximal growth rate, as well as the time
needed to reach the latter value were recorded for each
strain. A comparison of these parameters was performed
among the average values obtained for clinical, biocontrol
or plant-pathogenic P. agglomerans strains. Correlations
between OD420-580 nm measured in the Bioscreen C MBR
system and number of colony forming unit (CFU) was
estimated for representative strains by dilution plating on
LB agar.

Results
PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA, gyrB and
pagRI genes
Both 16S rDNA and gyrB primer sets were able to amplify
the related fragments in all of the strains tested, wheras
PCR amplification of pagRI genes was only successful for
those strains which according to 16S rDNA and gyrB phylogenies were closely related to P. agglomerans type strain
LMG 1286T (Figure 1 &2). The use of primer 16S-8F for
forward sequencing of the rrs gene proved challenging for
many strains, especially those belonging to P. agglomerans
sensu stricto, since the peaks on the electropherogram were
frequently superimposed at the very beginning of the read
making base calls virtually impossible. Independent
sequencing of all seven 16S rDNA genes found P. agglomerans C9-1 revealed insertions of guanidine at position 80
and cytosine at position 90 in four copies of the gene,
which resulted in a frameshift in the remainder of the
gene sequence. Only reverse primers were utilized to
sequence rrs with the final 90 bp discarded from subsequent analysis of the complete strain collection.

tions as P. agglomerans, E. agglomerans or Pantoea spp. did
not justifiably belong to P. agglomerans, but clustered distant from type strain LMG 1286T. Based on genotypic similarity, these strains belonged either to other Pantoea spp.
or other Enterobacteriaceae genera. In contrast, classification of biocontrol strains was more precise than for presumptively clinical strains, and all of these could be
identified unequivocally as P. agglomerans sensu stricto
(Figure 2).
Congruence between phylogenies derived from rrs (Figure
1) and gyrB (Figure 2) gene sequences was imperfect.
Analysis using 16S rDNA enabled only limited separation
of strains within each Pantoea spp., whereas analysis using
gyrB sequences revealed higher variability and enabled
finer resolution of distinct branches with some strains
clustering alongside P. agglomerans LMG 1286T in the rrs
tree. The gyrB clades corresponded largely to the MLSTgroups recently defined by Brady et al. [40] for Pantoea
spp. (Figure 2).
Four strains (EM13cb, EM17cb, ATCC 29001 and SC-1)
that grouped with representative strains of Pantoea MLSTgroups C, D and F in the rrs tree clearly diverged using gyrB
sequences. Clinical isolate EM13cb and cotton pathogen
SC-1 clustered with LMG 2558 (MLST-group C), while
two other clinical isolates, EM17cb and ATCC 29001,
clustered with LMG 24534 (MLST-group F) and LMG
5343 (MLST-group E) using either rrs or gyrB. In contrast,
LMG 5343, LMG 24198 (MLST-group B) and LMG 24199
(MLST-group A), all clustered unexpectedly with P. agglomerans in the rrs tree (Figure 1) but were clearly divergent
using gyrB. This demonstrated the resolution limits of 16S
rDNA sequence analysis among Pantoea spp. Both rrs and
gyrB sequences assigned two additional presumptive-clinical strains (ATCC 27995 and ATCC 27996) to the related
species Pantoea ananatis (Serrano 1928) Mergaert et al.
1993, while most of the other human isolates (including
representatives from Brenner's biotypes VII-XII [41]) clustered far from the P. agglomerans sensu stricto group and
could be roughly assigned to Erwinia or Enterobacter spp.
(see Additional file 2 - Table S2) based on BLAST comparison. Indicative of the uncertainty surrounding identification of this species, the BLAST best-hits list often included
isolates clearly misidentified as P. agglomerans or Pantoea
spp. Specifically, strains with extremely low sequence similarity with the P. agglomerans type strain LMG 1286T (well
below 90%) were interspersed among better characterized
Enterobacteriaceae.
Two plant epiphytic isolates (EPS486 and EPS595) from
apple and pear trees and two wheat root isolates (P8SAA
and P10QLC) formed a clearly distinct group in both trees
which is not embraced by any of the MLST-groups defined
for Pantoea [40], and are considered representative of a
single new Pantoea spp.

The P. agglomerans AHL autoinducer encoding genes pagRI
are located on a 530 kbp plasmid in the genome of strain
C9-1 [42]. Amplification of primers designed for pagRI
based on the C9-1 sequences was successful for all strains
clustered with P. agglomerans type strain LMG 1286T in the
rrs tree independent of their ecological origin except strain
LMG 5343. No amplification was observed for strains outside the P. agglomerans sensu stricto cluster. All strains positive with PCR were also positive for biosynthesis
determined using the autoinducer biosensor. Notably, the
only outlier strain, LMG 5343, does not cluster with P.
agglomerans acccording to gyrB sequence analysis. The
presence of pagRI matched the taxonomic clustering of P.
agglomerans based upon gyrB, with a few strains (Eh252,
ACW55802, P6WAL and C9-1) clustering independently
from the type strain LMG 1286T and without divergent
grouping of clinical and biocontrol strains (Figure 3). Taxonomic determination of the subgroup containing strains
Eh252, ACW55802 and P6WAL is ambiguous. All strains
clustered with P. agglomerans type strain LMG 1286T in the
16S rDNA tree, but were separated slightly from the main
group both in the gyrB, pagRI and fAFLP trees, (as well as
the reaction of AHL reporter strains) suggest that this
group may constitute a new subspecies of P. agglomerans.
Amplification of pagRI and AHL biosynthesis were positive for all P. agglomerans and no discrimination was
observed among clinical or biocontrol isolates.
fAFLP of P. agglomerans sensu stricto isolates
Analysis of fAFLP data was restricted primarily to strains
identified as P. agglomerans sensu stricto by sequence analysis, with P. ananatis, Pantoea stewartii and Pantoea dispersa
included in our analysis as outgroups. Four primer sets
were used in the selective amplification step of fAFLP giving a pool of 885 possible peak positions, with an average
of 103 peaks (signals) obtained for each strain. Each species formed a distinct cluster in the UPGMA dendrogram
consistent with the arrangement of Brady et al. [43] and
confirming the power of fAFLP as a tool for the molecularbased identification of Pantoea to the species level (Figure
4). The position of strain C9-1 was peculiar in so far that
it clustered well outside the P. agglomerans group and
showed almost no similarity even with other Pantoea spp.,
sharing only a very limited number of fAFLP peaks with
other strains of the genus (Figure 4). These results were
confirmed in three independent repetitions of the fAFLP
analysis beginning with single colonies of each strain on
different dates, and the identity of C9-1 DNA used in each
fAFLP run was confirmed by gyrB sequencing. The fAFLP
patterns were consistent with those from sequencing data
(excepting C9-1), with a distinct P. agglomerans sensu
stricto cluster and no separation of biocontrol and clinical
strains within this group (Figure 4). This supports the
redesignation of C9-1 into a new species, closely related to
P. agglomerans.

Analyis of the fAFLP profiles failed to identify any peak(s)
unique to clinical strains that could be used as marker for
pathogenicity potential. However, a 474-bp band was
obtained using EcoRI-G and MseI-G (+1) primers that was
found in all plant isolates (biocontrol strains) but none of
the clinical strains (Figure 5). The only exception was biocontrol strain C9-1 which lacked this 'biosafety' fAFLP
band. Specific primers for the putative fAFLP 'biosafety'
band were designed after cloning and sequencing the fragment. The band sequence consisted of a partial ORF identified as the encoding gene for a multidrug transport
protein AcrF, which is part of a putative RND (resistancenodulation-cell division type) efflux system. Primers for
this gene amplified in both clinical and biocontrol strains,
indicating that all strains carry this gene but that flanking
regions may differ resulting in divergent fAFLP patterns.
Comparison of other genotypic and phenotypic traits
Presence of traits that may reflect adaptation to the different lifestyles, such as sorbitol utilization, growth at 24°C
and 37°C, and pantocin A or T3SS genes was determined
in strains within the P. agglomerans sensu stricto cluster and
the two most-closely related groups represented by strains
Eh252 and C9-1. At 37°C none of these three investigated
parameters were significantly different between presumptive-clinical and plant isolates [i.e., maximal cell density
(ODmax), maximal hourly growth rate (kmax) and time
needed to attain the maximal hourly growth rate (tkmax)]
(Figure 6). In fact, the maximal hourly growth rate was
slightly less in clinical isolates, compared to Pantoea biocontrol or plant isolates. Similarly at 24°C, although clinical isolates had slightly lower maximal hourly growth
rate compared to plant strains, differences were not significant (Figure 6). All strains of P. agglomerans grew poorly
at 37°C compared to growth at 24°C.

low-GC genomic island of about 29 kbp inserted between
the mutS and narL genes, which was probably acquired by
horizontal gene transfer [42]. Using primers narL-rev and
mutS-rev, designed on the flanking regions of the insertion site, a 554-bp fragment could be amplified in all P.
agglomerans strains that were negative for paaABC (i.e.,
with no genomic island insertion). The large size of the
genomic island in paaABC-positive strains prevented
recovery of a PCR-product amplicon. This indicates that
the insertion site of the pantocin genomic island is the
same as in C9-1 for all Pantoea strains carrying the pantocin A genes. The origin of the pantocin genes remains
unknown, and no near or distant homologues have been
identified in any other organism after an extensive BLAST
search.
The T3SS gene hrcN was identified in several isolates (Figure 7), including the two phytopathogenic P. agglomerans
pv. gypsophilae strains (i.e., ATCC 43348 and CFBP 4342)
for which a T3SS has been previously reported [44,45].
Whether this suggests that these strains may have some
T3SS components and thus have pathogenic potential
(e.g., on plants) remains uncertain. Strains which amplified hrcN included four environmental strains (CIP
82.100, LMG 2557, P3SAA, P7NSW), one clinical strain
(VA21971) and two biocontrol isolates (CPA-2, Eh239).
Subsequent sequencing of the obtained fragment revealed
that the hrcN gene in all of these strains diverged significantly from the hrcN sequence carried by P. agglomerans
pv. gypsophilae and other plant pathogenic bacteria. The
sequence they carried was more closely related to that of
Pseudomonas fluorescens strains used in biocontrol of soilborne plant diseases (Figure 7), indicating a non-pathogenic alternative function.

Discussion
Utilization of sorbitol by P. agglomerans as a sole carbon
source was restricted to only a few biocontrol isolates,
indicating this as an important feature for phytopathogen
antagonism. In addition to the commercial biocontrol
strain C9-1, which has two plasmid-encoded sorbitol-utilization operons [42], only the biocontrol strains Eh252
and P10c were able to efficiently metabolize sorbitol.
Strain P. ananatis LMG 2665T, included as a positive control for sorbitol utilization, and P. agglomerans strains C91 and Eh252 gave absorbance readings that indicated a
growth after 6-8 h from inoculation, while the lag-phase
of P10c was protracted up to 24 h, suggesting that a certain
signal may be required for this strain before C6-sugar
metabolism is triggered.
Pantocin A biosynthetic genes were amplified in just four
biocontrol isolates (i.e., C9-1, Eh252, Eh318 and CPA-2)
and one clinical strain LMG 5343. Genome sequence
analysis of C9-1 has revealed that in this strain the gene
cluster coding for pantocine production is situated on a

Discrimination of clinical and plant-associated isolates of
P. agglomerans has important implications for the registration of biocontrol products for plant protection. We conducted a polyphasic genotypic analysis of a collection of
strains from different ecological niches. Our first observation was that a majority of clinical strains were in fact not
true P. agglomerans as defined by Gavini et al. [1] based on
taxonomic discrepencies revealed by sequence analysis of
the 16S rDNA and gyrB genes. All biocontrol strains in the
collection were found to be correctly identified as P. agglomerans. The reason for this discrepancy is ascribed to the
fact that bacteria selected for their biological control properties are typically better characterized, including DNA
sequencing, in comparison to those obtained in clinical
diagnostics where rapid identification for implementation of therapeutic treatment is the primary concern and
relies on less precise biochemical identification methods
(e.g., API20E and Vitek-2 from bioMerieux or Phoenix
from BD Diagnostic Systems). Biochemical methods have
previously been shown to misidentify P. agglomerans and

Additionally, many archival strains were deposited in culture collections more than 30 years ago when the genus
Pantoea was not yet taxonomically established and biochemical identification was less accurate.
The Enterobacter/Pantoea genus has undergone numerous
taxonomical rearrangements [1,41,48,50-53] (Figure 8)
and our results indicate that many strains previously identified as E. agglomerans or E. herbicola have been improp-

erly transferred into the composite P. agglomerans species
[1]. Although previous studies based on DNA-DNA
hybridization alerted that the E. agglomerans-E. herbicola
complex is composed from several unrelated species
[52,54,55] (Figure 8), these names continue to be utilized
as subjective synonyms. In this study, we analyzed the current subdivisions of P. agglomerans based on DNA-DNA
hybridization and used sequence analysis to establish
valid identity of representative strains for each E. agglomerans biotype as defined by Brenner et al. [41], and bioPage 12 of 18

Phylogeny of P. agglomerans sensu stricto strains of diverse origin based on partial sequencing the hrcN gene,
coding for the type III secretion system-specific ATPase. A total of 32 P. agglomerans or nearly related strains (e.g., SC1 or LMG 5343) were tested for the presence of a T3SS using primers hrcN-4r and hrcN-5rR, which were designed on the
basis of the alignment of the hrcN genes of E. amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae. A positive amplification was obtained as
expected in two known plant pathogens (P. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae CFBP 4342 and P. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae ATCC
43348) and in seven more strains, including four environmental strains (CIP 82.100, LMG 2557, P3SAA and P7NSW), one clinical isolate (VA21971) and two biocontrol strains (Eh239 and CPA-2). Sequence analysis revealed that the hrcN gene found in
the latter seven strains is more similar to that of biocontrol P. fluorescens and is not closely related to P. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae or other plant pathogenic bacteria, indicating a divergent function. GenBank accession numbers of reference sequences
not obtained in this work are indicated between square brackets.

type XI Leclercia adecarboxylata [52]. We could not confirm
the identity of strain LMG 5343 as P. agglomerans, indicating that biotype V should not be included in P. agglomerans as previously hypothesized by Beji et al. [53]. Our
BLAST analysis of strains belonging to other biotypes that
have not yet been assigned to a particular species showed
the highest similarity of these strains to undefined Enterobacter or Erwinia spp. Sequences belonging to P. agglomerans isolates and a wide-range of other bacteria described
as unknown or uncultured bacterium frequently were
scattered as top hits in the BLAST-search (see Additional
file 2 - Table S2). These sequences were not closely related
to any of the individual type strains of the Pantoea species.
This indicates the risk that a high number of Enterobacter
and Erwinia strains present in the databases are misidentified as Pantoea. The problematic classification of strains
belonging to the classical E. agglomerans basonym is further demonstrated by the observation of incorrect culture
collection designations. In the CECT (Colección Española

de Cultivos Tipo) three strains (including CECT 850, synonymous with the LMG 1286T type strain) can be
retrieved using "agglomerans" as search term. Strain CECT
4842, is retrievable as E. herbicola but listed as P. agglomerans despite the fact that our 16S rDNA data suggests this
strain is Klebsiella, and strain CECT 842 received by us as
E. agglomerans isolated from human feces has now been
designated as the type strain of BL-2 Cedecea davisae [56].
In the BCCM/LMG collection (Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-organisms/Laboratorium voor Microbiologie, Universiteit Gent) many strains received as
clinical E. agglomerans isolates are awaiting reclassification
and are now considered "unidentified" (see Additional
file 1 - Table S1). Most of the P. agglomerans strains
obtained from the ATCC, particularly those of clinical origin, were found in our analysis to belong to other species.
Thus, incorrect taxonomy is a major problem in terms of
biosafety classification of P. agglomerans.

Taxonomic
Taxonomic rearrangements undergone by the E. agglomerans/E. herbicola complex in the last decades and
attempts to assign still unassigned biotypes to known species. Strains belonging to the E. agglomerans/E. herbicola complex were described as early as 1888 [59] and included organisms that were saprophytes or plant pathogens [60,61] or (opportunistic) pathogens in humans [61]. The name E. agglomerans was proposed by Ewing and Fife [50] after comparing plant and
animal isolates as a subjective synonym for all three Erwinia species in the Herbicola group which was created in the meantime,
i.e., E. herbicola, E. stewartii (now P. stewartii) and E. uredvora [62]. In this process, other Enterobacter strains may have been
included in the new species. Brenner et al. [41] attempted to classify E. agglomerans strains by DNA hybridization and phenotypic tests deciding upon 13 biotypes. Subsequent classification efforts assigned several of the Brenner biotypes to new species,
including P. agglomerans, P. dispersa, P. ananatis or Leclercia adecarboxylata [1,52,54], but for most reclassification with definitive
assignment remains open. For these still unnamed biotypes an approximate classification, based on strain phylogeny (Figure 1 &
2) or 16S rDNA and gyrB sequence similarity (see Additional file 2- Table S2) is projected above.
We identified a single discriminatory marker for biocontrol strains using fAFLP which may be of use in biosafety
decisions for registration of beneficial isolates. Only biocontrol isolates had this fAFLP band, eventhough all
strains of P. agglomerans sensu stricto have indication of the
gene found within the band. For differentiation purposes
this is irrelevant since the purpose is to identify a genomic
marker, not a specific gene.
Our polyphasic analysis indicated that clinical and biocontrol strains co-cluster within P. agglomerans sensu
stricto. This suggests that both isolates from clinical and
environmental habitats have undergone indistinguishable evolutionary changes and that there is no discernable
specialization of clinical isolates toward human pathogenicity or biocontrol isolates toward a plant-associated
life-style. We observed no evidence, but can not exclude,
the possibility that clinical isolates may have acquired
specific pathogenicity factors beyond T3SS on plasmids or
other mobile elements, as has been reported for phytopathogenic strains [44,45]. The T3SS discovered in

some strains, however, was found to be more closely
related to that in biocontrol Pseudomonas spp. indicating a
non-pathogenic function [57]. Furthermore, only one
clinical isolate had a T3SS gene compared to six environmental isolates. Comparison between the completed
genome of biocontrol strain C9-1 and the in progress
genome sequencing of the clinical type strain of P. agglomerans LMG 1286T (T.H.M. Smits, B. Duffy et al., unpublished data) indicates that several features including
antibiotic production (revealed by the presence of paaABC
genes [58]), and nectar sugar utilization as a sole carbon
source are generally associated with antagonistic activity.
Our results demonstrate, however, that while many biocontrol strains have such traits, not all do and thus these
are not universal features of biocontrol potential. Also, we
have demonstrated for the first time the presence of the
antibiotic biosynthetic genes paaABC in clinical strains,
indicating that these may not be unique signatures of biocontrol isolates. What if any role pantocin may contribute
to animal associations remains to be determined. There
was no difference in growth at 37°C between clinical and

Additional material
Returning to the fundamental problem of insufficient
confidence in identification procedures, we have shown
that specific gene sequences (such as gyrB rather than 16S
rDNA) are more robust than biochemical identification
regarding P. agglomerans. The several reports of P. agglomerans from clinical literature upon which biosafety decisions have been based all lack a clear establishment of this
species as a primary and singular cause of disease. With
rare exception such isolates are not available for precise
taxonomic confirmation and detailed clinical histories are
typically absent for individual strains. We conducted a
small survey of three clinical diagnostic laboratories in
Switzerland and found that P. agglomerans is infrequently
recovered. P. agglomerans was identified, predominantly
as a polymicrobial co-isolate in patients, 21 times in the
last four years at the ICM in Bellinzona (M. Tonolla, personal communication) and six times in the last three years
at the Kantonsspital Lucerne (M. Hombach, personal
communication). At the Institute for Medical Microbiology of Zürich University several strains identified as Pantoea were reported to be present in the collection of
clinical samples, but no genetic sequence related to P.
agglomerans was retrieved from their sequence database
(G. Bloemberg, personal communication). Thus, P. agglomerans correctly characterized appears to be a more infrequent clinical organism than literature indicates.

Conclusion
Our study indicates that current restrictions on registration of microbial pesticides based on P. agglomerans biocontrol strains in Europe warrant review. The primary
argument for biosafety concerns is not supported by the
fact that a majority of clinical strains are currently misclassified as P. agglomerans as determined by sequence analysis of 16S rDNA and gyrB. Further analysis of specific
genes and fAFLP patterns also distinguish beneficial from
clinical strains within P. agglomerans sensu stricto. Moreover, the lack of pathogenicity confirmatory tests with clinical strains (i.e., Koch's postulates) and the polymicrobial
nature in clinical reports, which is probably just a reflection of the natural abundance of this species in the environment, draws into question the biosafety concerns with
plant beneficial isolates.
