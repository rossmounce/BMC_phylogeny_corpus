Abstract
Background: Lack of appropriate tools and techniques to study fate and functional integration of newly generated
neurons has so far hindered understanding of neurogenesis’ relevance under physiological and pathological
conditions. Current analyses are either dependent on mitotic labeling, for example BrdU-incorporation or retroviral
infection, or on the detection of transient immature neuronal markers. Here, we report a transgenic mouse model
(DCX-CreERT2) for time-resolved fate analysis of newly generated neurons. This model is based on the expression
of a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of a doublecortin (DCX) promoter, which is specific for
immature neuronal cells in the CNS.
Results: In the DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, expression of CreERT2 was restricted to DCX+ cells. In the CNS of
transgenic embryos and adult DCX-CreERT2 mice, tamoxifen administration caused the transient translocation of
CreERT2 to the nucleus, allowing for the recombination of loxP-flanked sequences. In our system, tamoxifen
administration at E14.5 resulted in reporter gene activation throughout the developing CNS of transgenic embryos.
In the adult CNS, neurogenic regions were the primary sites of tamoxifen-induced reporter gene activation. In
addition, reporter expression could also be detected outside of neurogenic regions in cells physiologically
expressing DCX (e.g. piriform cortex, corpus callosum, hypothalamus). Four weeks after recombination, the vast
majority of reporter-expressing cells were found to co-express NeuN, revealing the neuronal fate of DCX+ cells
upon maturation.
Conclusions: This first validation demonstrates that our new DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mouse model constitutes a
powerful tool to investigate neurogenesis, migration and their long-term fate of neuronal precursors. Moreover, it
allows for a targeted activation or deletion of specific genes in neuronal precursors and will thereby contribute to
unravel the molecular mechanisms controlling neurogenesis.

Background
Neurogenesis is a strictly controlled process generating
and maintaining the complex CNS cytoarchitecture. In
the adult brain, neurogenesis constitutes in addition a
form of cellular neuronal plasticity by continuously generating new neurons from resident neural stem cells
(NSCs). Neurogenesis progresses through several
sequential events, including proliferation, neuronal

lineage restriction of precursors, cell cycle exit, migration and integration into target area, differentiation, as
well as morphological and functional maturation. At the
end of this process, newly generated cells can be found
as functionally integrated and active neurons [1-3].
Neuronal precursors and newly generated neurons can
be identified by their expression of doublecortin (DCX)
[4,5]. In the adult CNS, expression of DCX is mainly
detected in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
and in the subventricular zone/rostral migration stream/
olfactory bulb axis (SVZ/RMS/OB) [4,6-8]. Based on the
close association between DCX expression and neurogenesis [5], we previously generated transgenic mice, to
monitor neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo, in which
reporter genes were driven by the DCX promoter [9-13].

The potential of involving adult neurogenesis in therapeutic strategies to replace pathological neuronal losses
urges for a better understanding of neurogenesis at the
molecular and cellular levels. In addition, accumulating
evidence indicates that abnormal neurogenesis might be
involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders [14-16]. Therefore, to understand and dissect the
molecular mechanisms driving neurogenesis in vivo, various models have been developed over the last years.
For example, transgenic models have been generated
based on cell-type specific promoters such as nestin,
GLAST, PLP (proteolipid protein), or DCX to investigate the biology of neural stem cells, radial glia, oligodendroglial precursors and neuronal precursors,
respectively [11,17-21]. However, these reporter mice
are not suitable for long-term studies such as fate tracing or studies on the long-term functional integration
of the newly generated neurons. For example, in the
SVZ/OB axis and in the dentate gyrus DCX is expressed
in newly generated neurons only transiently (mostly less
than 1 month in rodents’ DG and OB) [4], and thus, the
DCX reporter mice are not applicable for fate mapping
studies. In the other groups of mice, the GLAST or nestin promoter-driven expression of Cre-recombinase
takes place in cells that are still multipotent and as a
consequence the fate of these cells is not exclusively
neuronal. Therefore, the lack of suitable models to study
specifically neuronal precursors’ long-term fate still constitutes a major deficit.
To remedy this absence of suitable tool for neuronal
precursor fate analysis, we generated transgenic mice
bearing the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase
gene under the control of the DCX promoter. In this
report, we demonstrate that this new transgenic tool
allows for time-resolved permanent labeling of newly
generated neurons and long-term analysis of their fate.
Moreover, it provides a platform to induce and eliminate expression of genes in a crucial time window of
neuronal maturation and study the functional consequences of these manipulations.

Methods
Plasmid Constructs

A 2380-bp Sal I-Not I fragment of pCAG-CreERT2bpA-SS1 vector containing the CreERT2 cDNA was
subcloned into the BamH I and Not I site of the
phuDCX-3509-DsRed2 cassette [9], which contains the
promoter region of human DCX, resulting in the
phuDCX-3509-CreERT2 (Additional file 1). A 7.7-kb
DCX-3’UTR (3’UTR) was amplified with RT-PCR, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen Kit;
catalog No. 11904-018). PCR amplifications were performed with the sense primer 5’-ACTAGTAAGATGATAGGCTAAATCAAAGCC-3’ and antisense primer 5’-

GCGGCCGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATTGAAATCAAATTTTAT-3’. The Spe I and Not I sites were
inserted in the 5’ terminal of primers respectively (the
italic sequences with underlines). PCR products were
cloned into a pCRII vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit;
Invitrogen; catalog No. K4600-01) to obtain the pCRIITOPO-3’UTR plasmid. A 7.7-kb Spe I-Not I fragment
of pCRII-TOPO-3’UTR was subcloned into the Spe I
and Not I site of the phuDCX-3509-CreERT2 cassette
to get the phuDCX-3509-CreERT2-3’UTR targeting
plasmid.
Generation of the DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice

The targeting plasmid, phuDCX-3509-CreERT2-3’-UTR,
was linearized by digestion with Sal I-Not I. The purified linearized DNA was microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes of FVB inbred mice. Genotypes
of the offspring were determined by PCR analysis and
Southern Blot of tail DNA. An initial screen of the offspring was performed via PCR analysis with Cre sense
primer 5’-TGCATTACCGGTCGATGCAAC-3’ and the
antisense primer 5’-GAAATCAGTGCGTTCGAACGCTAGA-3’. Cre-positive mice were further analyzed with
Southern Blot (Additional file 1). A 1.27-kb Sal I-Hind III
fragment of pCAG-CreERT2-bpA-SS1 vector was
employed for preparing the probe with random primer
(GE Healthcare Kit; catalog No. RPN 1633), the labeling
probe was purified with MicroSpin S-300 HR
(GE Healthcare Kit; catalog No. 27-5130-01) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. In case of positive insertion this probe detects a 7424 bp fragment after digestion
of the genomic DNA with Kpn I, or two fragments after
digestion with EcoR V (the size of one fragment is 8415
bp and the other at least is over 4103 bp). (All restriction
enzymes are from Roche Applied Science).
Transgenic Mice Treatments

Animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with the Council of European Communities Directive of
the 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and approved by
the HelmholtzZentrum Munich Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. To expand the DCXCreERT2 transgenic mouse line, DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice were backcrossed with wildtype C57Bl/6J
mice. DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice were in addition
mated with two reporter lines: CAG-CAT-EGFP mice
[22] or ROSA26lacZ mice [23] to obtain DCX-CreERT2:
ROSA26lacZ or DCX-CreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP double
transgenic mice. Recombination activity in these lines
induces expression of the corresponding reporter gene
and was used for the various analyses described
hereafter.
Tamoxifen (TAM, T-5648, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in corn oil (C-8267, Sigma-Aldrich) at a stock

concentration of 10 mg/ml. To analyze the expression of
CreERT2 or reporter genes in embryonic stages 20 μg
TAM/g bodyweight was injected once intraperitoneally
(i.p.) into pregnant mothers at different gestational
stages. One day after the TAM injection, embryos were
dissected for whole-mount X-Gal staining or immunostaining. To follow the fate of cells targeted at embryonic
stages during adulthood, the same protocol of TAM
injection was employed in pregnant females of 17.5 day
gestational stage, and the offspring was sacrificed at 2
months of age. To identify whether the CreERT2
recombination can be activated with a single TAM
injection in adult brain (8 to 10 week-old), one dose of
200 μg TAM/g bodyweight was injected (i.p.) and mice
were analyzed 1 day later. Finally, study of the expression patterns of CreERT2, reporter genes and cell-type
specific markers in the adult brain was realized by
injecting daily 100 μg TAM/g bodyweight (i.p.) for 5
consecutive days. These mice were analyzed 2 days
(D2), 8 days (D8), 15 days (D15), or 29 days (D29) after
the last TAM injection. For all experiment control mice
were included that were injected with vehicle only, i.e.
corn oil.
Twenty-four hours prior to perfusion, mice were
injected with 200 μg/g bodyweight BrdU (5-Bromo-2’deoxyuridine; B5002; Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in sterile
PBS, pH7.4.
Histology

For whole-mount X-gal staining, embryos were fixed by
immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 5 mM
EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2 in PBS solution for 30 minutes at
room temperature (RT). They were then rinsed in 0.1 M
sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (PB), 2 mM MgCl2,
0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40, and incubated with X-gal staining buffer (0.1% X-gal, 2 mM
MgCl 2 , 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40,
5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6 in PB) for several
hours in the dark at 37°C to visualize the beta-galactosidase (b-gal) activity as a blue reaction product. Stained
embryos were washed twice in PBS and post-fixed with
4% PFA in PBS overnight at 4°C. X-gal staining of free
floating sections was carried out as described above,
with the modification that sections were post-fixed with
4% PFA in PBS only 1 h at RT, and then lightly counterstained with Eosin Y (0.1%, E4382, Sigma-Aldrich).
Embryos for immunohistology were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer pH 7.5 for 2-8 hrs. Thereafter the whole embryo
was embedded in paraffin, and sagittally sectioned
(8 μm) using a Microm HM 355 s Microtome (Leica).
Brains of adult mice were removed after transcardial
perfusion with 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH
7.5. Brains were post-fixed for 2 hours in the same

fixative. Thereafter, brains were immersed in 20%
sucrose at 4°C overnight and embedded in OCT compound. Brains were sectioned using a Leica cryostat into
serial coronal or sagittal sections (40 μm) for a systematic sampling of the entire brain.
Immunostainings

For immunofluorescence staining, free-floating sections
were rinsed with PBS and blocked with PBS++ (PBS++:
5% fetal calf serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h
at RT. However, in cases of staining involving the detection of BrdU, sections were pretreated in 2 N HCl at
37°C for 30 min, followed by a 10 min neutralization in
0.1 M borate buffer and six washes in PBS prior to
blocking. Then they were incubated in PBS++ containing primary antibody dilutions (see Table 1) for
24 hours at 4°C, followed by three 10 min washes in PBS.
Sections were then incubated with secondary antibody
conjugated to cyanine 2 (cy2), cy3 or cy5 diluted in PBS++
for 2 h at RT (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab). After
three 10 min washes in PBS, sections were incubated with
5 mg/ml 4’,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (SigmaAldrich, D9564) for 20 min, followed by three 5 min
washes in PBS. Finally, sections were mounted with Aqua
poly/Mount (Polysciences, 18606).
Statistics

A minimum of 100 positive cells per region of interest
in each animal and for each time point were counted to
quantify the recombination events. Data are presented
as mean ± SD.

Results
Generation of transgenic Dcx-CreERT2 mice

We previously demonstrated that a 3509-bp DCX
genomic fragment could properly drive expression of
reporter genes in neuronal precursors and immature
neurons in vitro and in vivo [9,10]. Therefore, the
CreERT2 encoding sequences were subcloned downstream of this DCX regulatory fragment (Additional
file 1). Two male founders carrying the CreERT2 transgene were obtained after pronuclear injection. Both
founders transmitted their transgene to the F1 generation and Southern blot analysis suggested that only 1
copy of the transgene was integrated into the host genome (Additional file 1).
Cre-recombinase activity was assessed on the F1 generation of both founder-derived lines following mating
with Rosa26 lacZ reporter mice bearing a lacZ expression cassette activated following recombination [23].
Two month-old DCX-CreERT2:Rosa26 lacZ mice were
perfused two weeks after a tamoxifen (TAM) or vehicle
injection and stained for b-gal activity. Both
DCX-CreERT2 transgenic lines exhibited the expected

TAM-induced b-gal expression in the adult neurogenic
regions, i.e. SVZ and dentate gyrus (Additional file 1).
In contrast, no b-gal activity was observed following
vehicle injections in the progeny derived from founder
2. However, in mice derived from founder 1, numerous
b-gal positive profiles could be detected after vehicle
injection indicating unspecific recombination events
(data not shown). Therefore, only the transgenic DCXCreERT2 founder 2 line was expanded and employed
for the following experiments.
Expression and sub-cellular localization of CreERT2 in
DCX positive (DCX+) cells

To validate that CreERT2 expression coincides with
endogenous DCX expression in the DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, we investigated their respective expression
patterns. At the cellular level, CreERT2 was detected in
virtually all DCX+ cells of the developing CNS (E15.5).
Furthermore, one day after injection of TAM, the
CreERT2 has been translocated to the nucleus (Figure 1a).
Similarly, in the adult brain, CreERT2 expression was, one
day after TAM injection, strictly restricted to the nucleus
of DCX+ cells (Figure 1b). Nuclear localization is induced
by TAM administration and is a prerequisite for CreERT2
activity [24].
To determine the time window in which CreERT2
exerts its function in the nucleus after the TAM

injection, DCX-CreERT2 adult mice were perfused at
different time points post-injection and the sub-cellular
localization of the CreERT2 was assessed. Seven days
after TAM injection, the nuclear localization was dramatically decreased as compared to the first day. At this
time point, CreERT2 expression was still co-localized
with DCX, but its distribution returned to be mostly
cytoplasmic (Figure 1c). Furthermore, two weeks after
TAM injection, CreERT2 was exclusively localized in
the cytoplasm (Figure 1d and 1e). Taken together, our
results indicate that the CreERT2 nuclear localization
rapidly recedes after the last TAM administration, indicating that CreERT2 activity was transient and virtually
ceased after 7 days.
Assessment of CreERT2 activity in neuronal precursor
cells

Having confirmed the correct co-localization of
CreERT2 with DCX+ cells, we then analyzed recombination activity and specificity. To this end, we mated
DCX-CreERT2 mice with Rosa26 lacZ or CAG-CATEGFP reporter mice, which allow to monitor the activation of the respective reporter gene expression, following
successful excision of the loxP-flanked cassette. The fate
of DCX-expressing cells can then be followed by analyzing reporter gene expression at various time points following recombination.

injection in DCX-expressing cells (red). Insets show higher magnification of the selected areas. Scale bar in (a) = 33 μm.

The CreERT2 activity at embryonic stages was analyzed first. Twenty-four hours after a single TAM injection performed on E14.5, X-gal staining revealed that
b-gal expression was restricted to the developing CNS
and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) (Figure 2). This distribution coincided with the pattern of endogenous DCX
expression at this stage (Figure 2a). Activation of
CreERT2 at E17.5 by a single TAM-injection led to a
wide distribution of EGFP reporter expression in the
adult brain (Figure 2d to 2k and Additional file 2).
EGFP+ cells were detected in most regions of the brain
parenchyma, such as in the granular cell layer of dentate
gyrus, striatum, cortex, thalamus, Ammon’s horn (CA1),
etc. according to DCX expression pattern at E17.5.
Noteworthy, virtually all EGFP+ cells expressed NeuN,
and thus had become mature neurons (Figure 2d to 2g).
EGFP expression was neither detected in DCX-positive
cells in the SVZ (Figure 2f and 2g), nor in the rostral
migrating stream (RMS) (data not shown) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (Figure 2d and 2e).

A few EGFP+ cells could be found in or in close association to the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles
(Figure 2f, arrows). These EGFP+ cells, however, did
neither co-express NeuN nor DCX and their nature
remains to be elucidated.
Due to the lower numbers of neurons continuously
generated in the adult CNS, adult mice were injected
with TAM on 5 consecutive days and then perfused for
analysis 4 weeks after the last injection. At this time
point, SVZ-generated EGFP+ cells reached the OB and
were distributed mainly within the granular cell layer
(GrO) (Figure 2h and 2i) and to a lower extent in the
periglomerular cell layer (pGl). The EGFP+ cells present
in the OB were found to express the mature neuronal
marker NeuN, whereas no co-expression of DCX could
be detected (Figure 2h and 2i). Within the rostral RMS
in contrast, a few scattered EGFP-expressing cells
appeared to have retained expression of DCX. Moreover, only rare EGFP+ cells could be found in the SVZ
(data not shown). Similarly to cells detected in the OB,

four weeks after TAM administration, EGFP+ cells in
the dentate gyrus expressed NeuN and were devoid of
DCX (Figure 2j and 2k).
The efficiency and the specificity of the recombination
event in DCX-expressing cells were evaluated in the

adult SVZ and SGZ. The percentage of all DCX+ cells
expressing EGFP was defined as the efficiency of recombination, and the percentage of all EGFP+ cells expressing DCX was defined as the specificity. Since levels of
accumulated EGFP within cells were relatively low at

the neurogenic regions of adult DCX-CreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP mice 2 days (a-d), 8 days (e-h) and 15 days (i-l) following last TAM administration.
The extensive co-localization of DCX and EGFP observed at D2 rapidly decrease over time. The frequency of co-localization between EGFP and
DCX was quantified at various time points. Percentages of EGFP-labeled cells among all DCX-expressing cells decreased over time in the SVZ (m)
and in the DG (n). The efficiency of recombination, i.e. the percentages of all DCX+ cells that expressed EGFP, in shown in (o), whereas the

the earliest time point studied, EGFP signals were
amplified using an anti-EGFP antibody in all following
experiments. In the SVZ, we observed that approximately 94% DCX+ cells were co-expressing EGFP two
days after the last TAM injection (Figure 3c and 3o). At
the same time point in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus,
EGFP could be detected in approximately 77% of DCX-

expressing cells (Figure 3d and 3o). Moreover, approximately 96% EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% EGFP+ cells
in SGZ (Figure 3p) were co-expressing DCX, demonstrating that the CreERT2 activity was highly efficient
and specific.
In order to characterize further the kinetics of the
DCX+ cells’ emigration from their site of birth to their

target structures, the distribution of EGFP-expressing
cells following recombination was investigated over
time. To this end, adult mice were sacrificed eight, fifteen or twenty-nine days after the last TAM injection
(D8, D15 and D29, respectively). Co-localization of
EGFP expression with DCX and NeuN was analyzed
within the SVZ-RMS-OB axis and within the dentate
gyrus at these time points.
In contrast to the high percentage of EGFP-expression
within DCX+ cells two days after the last TAM injection, the percentage of EGFP-expressing DCX+ neurons
in the SGZ decreased to 41% at D8, and declined gradually to roughly 25% of all DCX+ cells at D15 (Figure 3).
Concomitantly, the frequency of co-localization in the
SVZ decreased at D8 to 26.7%, further diminished to
12.5% at D15 (Figure 3). Finally, at D29, only rare EGFP
+ cells remained within the SVZ and were found to
express DCX, whereas no co-localization could be
detected in the SGZ at this time point. Taken together,
our data indicate that the main emigration wave of
EGFP-labeled neurons departed away from the SVZ
within the first 15 days (Figure 3).

GAD65, a marker found in GABAergic neurons, could
be detected at this time point in EGFP-expressing cells
located in the OB. Moreover, a sub-population of periglomerular EGFP+ cells was found to co-express TH, a
marker specific for dopaminergic neurons (Figure 5).
On the other side, VGLUT2, a commonly used marker
for glutamatergic terminations, could be detected in the
granular layer of the dentate gyrus and surrounded EGFP
+ cells at D29, revealing that EGFP-expressing cells
received glutamatergic inputs (Figure 5). In addition, we
scrutinized for the expression of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin in the
EGFP-labeled granule neurons at this time point. The
calbindin-D28K, which is expressed in mature granule
neurons, could be detected in most EGFP+ cells of the
dentate gyrus (Figure 5). In contrast, no parvalbumin and
only weak expression of calretinin could be detected in
EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus at this time point,
although cells expressing high levels of parvalbumin or
calretinin, the latter been specifically found in newly generated granule cells, could be detected in the vicinity
(see for example arrow in Figure 5e).

Neuronal phenotypes of EGFP+ cells integrated into adult
neurogenic regions

Proliferative capacity of EGFP+ cells in the adult
neurogenic regions

EGFP+ cells migrating along the RMS from D2 to D15
were found to maintain an immature neuronal morphology and only rare co-localization with NeuN could be
documented (Figure 4). Over the next 4 weeks, expression of NeuN within EGFP+ cells was broadly induced
as cells reached the GrO or the pGl of the olfactory
bulb (Figure 2h and 2i, Figure 4 a, e and 4i). Notably, in
the GrO, we found only weak expression of DCX in
EGFP+ cells. In contrast, DCX was still strongly
expressed in the cytoplasm of EGFP+ located at the
anterior end of the RMS (Figure 2i, arrow), revealing
that the expression of DCX decreased gradually as
EGFP+ cells migrated into their target areas (data not
shown). These observations reveal that DCX expression
in cells migrating to the olfactory bulb is regionally
regulated. In a similar fashion, EGFP-expressing cells in
the dentate gyrus integrated in the inner granular layer
over time and gradually induced the expression of
NeuN. Quantitative analyses revealed that 15 days after
the last TAM administration, more than 80% of EGFP+
cells found in the dentate gyrus (Figure 4m) and virtually all EGFP+ cells found in the olfactory bulb (data
not shown) expressed the mature neuronal marker
NeuN.
To further characterize the neuronal phenotypes of
EGFP-labeled neurons, the presence of neurotransmitter-specific markers and calcium-binding proteins was
investigated by immunohistology at D29 (Figure 5). In
agreement with previous studies [25,26], expression of

DCX expression takes place in a relatively heterogeneous population of neuronal precursors and young
neurons of various maturation stages and proliferative
statuses. Administration of BrdU to label proliferative
cells was performed at various time points following
recombination. At the earliest time point investigated,
D2, approximately 51.1% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ, but
only 7.7% of EGFP+ cells in the SGZ incorporated BrdU
respectively, confirming that a fraction of the cells was
still proliferating (Figure 6). The higher proportion of
mitotically active cells in the SVZ might be explained by
the emigration of post-mitotic young neurons out of the
SVZ towards the OB, leaving the most immature cells
behind. Furthermore, no more BrdU incorporation in
EGFP+ cells was observed in SGZ at D15 (Figure 6),
underscoring the temporally limited proliferative capacity of DCX+ cells. In contrast, although no more BrdU
incorporation in EGFP+ cells was observed in SGZ at
D15, a few BrdU+/EGFP+ co-labeling cells could be
found in RMS (data not shown), suggesting that some
EGFP+ cells in SVZ/RMS/OB axis could keep proliferative capacity until at least D15.
EGFP+ cells outside of adult neurogenic regions

Following administration of TAM to adult DCXCreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP mice, EGFP+ cells could be
detected outside of the described neurogenic regions. In
this respect, scattered DCX-expressing cells have previously been reported in adult cerebral cortex of

rodents, cats and primates [7,27]. To validate that EGFP
expression in cells located outside of the neurogenic
regions ensued from concomitant expression of DCX,
we scrutinized by immunohistochemistry DCX expression pattern in the whole adult brain in respect to the
activation of the EGFP expression.
Low to moderate levels of DCX expression could be
detected in cells dispersed throughout the cerebral cortex
(Figure 7). Some weak DCX expression could also be perceived in corpus callosum, as well as around the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, the molecular cell layer (MCL)
and the granular cell layer (GCL) of cerebellum (data not
show). Four weeks after TAM injection, EGFP+ cells also
appeared in these regions (Figure 7). The reporter expression levels however were significantly higher than the
endogenous DCX expression levels, since upon recombination, expression of the reporter gene was under the
control of a strong promoter. Importantly, EGFP+ cells
located outside of the neurogenic regions were not proliferative, as demonstrated by the absence of BrdU incorporation. Therefore, the nature and fate of these
immature neurons remains to be deciphered.

Discussion
In this report, we demonstrated that CreERT2-mediated
recombination can be efficiently and specifically targeted

in vivo in DCX-expressing cells, i.e. in the neuronal precursors and young neurons, using a DCX promoter-driven CreERT2. In contrast to DCX promoter-driven
reporter lines previously generated [10,11], the DCXCreERT2 construct described here additionally encodes
the 3’UTR region of the DCX mRNA. The large DCX
3’UTR is known to contain post-transcriptional regulation elements of gene expression [28]. However, under
experimental conditions used in this study, no overt differences in the expression pattern of the CreERT2 transgene could be documented in comparison to former
lines devoid of DCX 3’UTR sequences. Nevertheless, the
presence of DCX 3’UTR could lead to a more faithful
CreERT2 expression pattern within the DCX-expressing
cell population and more investigation will be required
to understand its function.
One day after TAM administration, the CreERT2 protein was translocated to the nuclear compartment of
DCX-expressing cells where it could proceed to recombination. The latter resulted in a rapid activation of
reporter expression; b-gal or EGFP could be readily
detected in the embryonic, as well as in the adult CNS,
one day after tamoxifen injection (Figure 2). Following
five daily tamoxifen administrations, 94% DCX+ cells in
SVZ and 77% DCX+ cells in the dentate gyrus induced
expression of EGFP, demonstrating a high efficiency of

Figure 7 Expression of DCX and EGFP outside of neurogenic
areas. Low levels of DCX expression can be detected outside of
neurogenic areas. For example, DCX-expressing cells were detected
by immunohistochemistry in the piriform cortex (a) and in the
corpus callosum (b). Accordingly, EGFP-expressing cells were
detected following TAM administration in the piriform cortex (c)
and corpus callosum (d). Scale bar in (a) = 33 μm; Scale bar (b), (c)
and (d) = 50 μm.

Figure 6 Proliferative potential of EGFP-labeled cells. One day
or 14 days after the last TAM injection, dividing cells were labeled
via a single BrdU injection and co-localization of EGFP with BrdU
was examined at day 2 (a and c) and day 15 (b and d), respectively,
in the SVZ and DG. Quantification on day 2 revealed that the
percentage of all EGFP+ cells labeled with BrdU rapidly decreases
and is shown in (e). Scale bar in (c) = 33 μm.

recombination using our experimental paradigms. On
the other side, about 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and
90% of EGFP+ cells in SGZ were co-expressing DCX,
confirming that the recombination activity was induced
with high specificity. (Figure 3). As the fate of EGFP+
cells was observed to be solely neuronal, we conclude
that the absence of DCX expression in a small fraction
of the EGFP+ resulted from the maturation-associated
downregulation of DCX+ over the 5 days of TAM
injection.
Although the nuclear translocation of the CreERT2
was transient, expression of the reporter got permanently induced following recombination, which allows
for the long-term analysis of cell types arising from
DCX+ cells. Hence, one month after recombination in
the DCX-CreERT2, the vast majority of the EGFP+ cells
in the neurogenic target regions expressed NeuN, a
marker found in mature neurons. In addition, a few

EGFP+ cells along the neuroblasts’ migratory route or
localized outside neurogenic regions were found to
express low levels of DCX. Importantly, one month after
the last TAM injection, no co-localization between the
EGFP signal and the expression of GFAP (astrocyte
marker), CNPase (oligodendrocyte marker) or Iba I
(microglia marker) was detected (data not shown). This
substantiates evidences that DCX-expressing cells are
determined to become neurons under physiological conditions. This contrast with the use of the nestin promoter to drive the expression of the CreERT, which
resulted in the labeling of the neural stem cell population generating thereafter a continuous flow of new neurons and glia [17].
Calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin belong to
the superfamily of low molecular weight calcium-binding proteins and are characteristic of different subpopulations of neurons [29]. Hence, in the dentate gyrus,
Calbindin-D28K is as marker of mature granule cells
while calretinin is transiently expressed in postmitotic
newly generated neurons [30,31]. In agreement with the
latter, we observed that EGFP+ granular cells in the
dentate gyrus were expressing Calbindin-D28K, a few of
them expressed low levels of calretinin, and none of
them expressed parvalbumin four weeks after recombination (Figure 5). The absence of co-localization

Zhang et al. BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:158
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/11/158

between EGFP and parvalbumin reinforced evidence
that this GABAergic subpopulation is not replenished
by a constant addition of new neurons in adult dentate
gyrus, although this matter is still under debate [32-34].
The EGFP+ cells outside the classical adult neurogenic
regions

Following recombination in DCX-CreERT mice, EGFP+
cells were also found within non-neurogenic brain areas.
In mammals, DCX+ cells have been reported outside
neurogenic regions, including temporal and prefrontal
cortex layer II, piriform cortex layer III/endopiriform
nucleus, corpus callosum, nucleus accumbens, ventromedial striatum, ventrolateral septum, bed nucleus of
the stria terminalis, molecular cell layer, granular cell
layer and white matter of cerebellum. The distribution
and frequency of these DCX+ cells appear to increase in
superior species of the phylogeny, although it remains
to be elucidated to which extent this is due to an
increase of DCX expression levels and thereby a better
immunohistochemical detectability [7,8,35-37].
Intriguingly, the numbers of EGFP+ cells around the
3 rd ventricle and hypothalamus appeared markedly
higher than the numbers of DCX+ cells detected in
these regions. The reason of this discrepancy may be
related to a very low expression level of DCX in these
cells, which would be hardly detectable using current
antibodies. In contrast, once DCX-associated recombination occurred, the expression of reporter genes is controlled by a strong constitutive promoter allowing for an
easy detection of targeted cells.
The origin and function of DCX-expressing cells outside of the neurogenic regions remain to be elucidated.
For instance, it was reported that the neural stem cells
can be isolated from virtually every region of the adult
CNS [38]. In addition, upon specific treatment, neurogenic events have been induced within the adult cortex,
striatum, CA1 region of the hippocampus, and even
within the white matter [39-42]. It is tempting to conclude that some of the DCX-expressing cells detected in
these regions were generated by a very low rate continuous neurogenesis. However, the absence of BrdU labeling obtained in these cells under physiological
conditions suggests that such a mechanism of DCX+
cells generation would be marginal in the best case.
On the other side, there exists good evidence that the
extra-neurogenic DCX-expressing cells might have been
generated during developmental neurogenesis, but never
fully completed their maturation process [43]. These
cells would remain in the parenchyma as “quiescent”
local neuronal precursors. The existence of such quiescent precursors has also been suggested following grafting experiments in which neural stem cells were
injected into the ventricles during cortical development

Page 12 of 14

[44]. Detection of these cells at a later time point
revealed that stem cells were integrated as neurons into
various brain regions, but at the same time, a certain
amount of cells remained as immature neurons in the
parenchyma, potentially as a reservoir of precursor cells
available for plasticity or local repair.
Recently, another mouse model expressing the DCXCreERT has been reported [34]. In contrast to our
model based on the human DCX promoter, Cheng and
colleagues used a BAC construct encoding the murine
DCX promoter. The latter, together with a possible
positional effect of the transgene may explain the differences observed between the two models. For instance,
in contrast to our mouse model, the model from Cheng
et al. is exclusively active in DCX-expressing cells within
the hippocampus [34]. Also, the authors claim that
recombination in their DCX-CreERT mice takes only
place in post-mitotic neuronal precursors. Given the
fact that a significant fraction of all DCX-expressing
cells are still in a proliferative state (see Figure 6 and
[10]), this suggests that the induction of the DCXCreERT transgene expression reported by Cheng is
delayed in respect to the endogenous DCX. Thus, the
DCX-CreERT mouse model presented by Cheng and
colleagues appears to be well-suited for the study
addressing the maturation and fate of newly generated
granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Still, there is a lack of
model(s) addressing the fate of DCX-expressing cells
located outside of the dentate gyrus - such as in the
subventricular zone (SVZ) - which is now possible by
the model presented in this manuscript.

Conclusion
We report here a transgenic mouse model based on an
inducible Cre recombinase driven by the DCX promoter
(DCX-CreERT2). Taken the high specificity and efficiency of recombination in neuroblasts and young neurons, this transgenic mouse model constitutes a
powerful tool for tracing neurogenesis and fate-analysis
of newly generated neurons. It is moreover a valuable
model for studying molecular mechanisms of neural
plasticity and neurogenesis through induction or silencing of specific genes in neuroblasts and young neurons.
Finally, the possibility to analyze the long-term fate of
newly generated neurons will be an asset in the development of innovative therapies against neurologic diseases.
