Abstract
Background: When orthologous sequences from species distributed throughout an optimal
range of divergence times are available, comparative genomics is a powerful tool to address
problems such as the identification of the forces that shape gene structure during evolution,
although the functional constraints involved may vary in different genes and lineages.
Results: We identified and annotated in the MitoComp2 dataset the orthologs of 68 nuclear genes
controlling oxidative phosphorylation in 11 Drosophilidae species and in five non-Drosophilidae
insects, and compared them with each other and with their counterparts in three vertebrates (Fugu
rubripes, Danio rerio and Homo sapiens) and in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, taking into
account conservation of gene structure and regulatory motifs, and preservation of gene paralogs in
the genome. Comparative analysis indicates that the ancestral insect OXPHOS genes were intron
rich and that extensive intron loss and lineage-specific intron gain occurred during evolution.
Comparison with vertebrates and cnidarians also shows that many OXPHOS gene introns predate
the cnidarian/Bilateria evolutionary split. The nuclear respiratory gene element (NRG) has played
a key role in the evolution of the insect OXPHOS genes; it is constantly conserved in the OXPHOS
orthologs of all the insect species examined, while their duplicates either completely lack the
element or possess only relics of the motif.
Conclusion: Our observations reinforce the notion that the common ancestor of most animal
phyla had intron-rich gene, and suggest that changes in the pattern of expression of the gene
facilitate the fixation of duplications in the genome and the development of novel genetic functions.

Background
As the number of sequenced eukaryotic genomes steadily
increases, systematic comparison of closely related species
("phylogenetic shadowing") [1] allows characterization
of recent evolutionary events before they are obscured

through accumulation of random mutations, while comparison over larger evolutionary distances highlights lineage specific changes. Besides providing a better
understanding of many aspects of genome evolution,
recent studies based on a comparative genomic-based

approach led to significant progress in clarifying the
molecular mechanisms that control gene evolution and
the origin of the differences in gene structure between
eukaryotic species [2], showing that changes in exonintron structure are largely independent of protein
sequence evolution [3]. Comparative analysis is also a
powerful tool to identify conserved noncoding sequences
essential for regulating gene expression [4-7]. However,
investigation of the forces that shape eucaryotic genomes
is still significantly hampered by the absence of comprehensive and readily available data on a sufficient number
of informative lineages. Studies involving as large as possible a number of different species and gene subsets are
needed, because selective pressures may differ significantly not only between different evolutionary lineages
but also between particular types of genes [8].

exon-intron structure of insect OXPHOS genes with their
counterparts in three vertebrate species (Fugu rubripes
(pufferfish), Danio rerio (zebrafish) and human), and in
the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (starlet sea anemone).
The last comparison was felt informative because of the
pivotal position that cnidarians occupy in metazoan phylogeny [14].
On the whole, our findings further validate the use of
interspecific multialignments of orthologous sequences as
a powerful tool to identify crucial features that constrain
genome evolution. We identified several such features
within OXPHOS genes transcriptional units, including
known and novel regulatory motifs, splicing sites and previously unidentified genes within genes.

Results and discussion
Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the primary
energy-producing biological process in all aerobic organisms [9], generates ATP using the products of both nuclear
and mitochondrial genes (OXPHOS genes); because they
encode products organized in the respiratory complexes
spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane, OXPHOS
genes are subject to specific evolutionary constraints, e.g.
because coordinate evolution is required to maintain the
stochiometric balance between components of multisubunit complexes [10].
We previously reported [11] the identification of the D.
pseudoobscura and A. gambiae orthologs of a set of D. melanogaster genes which are the putative counterparts of
human OXPHOS genes [12]. To extend our analysis, we
recently identified and annotated the OXPHOS genes
orthologs in nine more Drosophilidae genomes, in
another Culicidae species (the yellow fever mosquito,
Aedes aegypti), and in three non Dipteran insect species,
i.e. Bombyx mori (silkworm), Apis mellifera (honeybee) and
Tribolium castaneum (red fluor beetle), and we have compiled the MitoComp2 dataset [13], that provides an integrated view of the data obtained. Duplicates of the
OXPHOS genes, when present in a genome, were also
included in the dataset, which at present contains more
than 1300 annotated genes. Drawing on this information,
we present here a detailed comparative analysis of 68 gene
clusters each comprising the putative orthologs of an
OXPHOS gene in 11 Drosophilidae species and in five
non-Drosophilidae insects.
This study focuses on three aspects of the evolutionary history of the insect OXPHOS genes, i.e. i) conservation of
the exon-intron structure during evolution; ii) identification and conservation of a putative regulatory motif specific of genes involved in energy production in insects; iii)
origin, fixation in the genome and functional significance
of OXPHOS genes duplicates. We also compared the

MitoComp2 : a web resource for the comparative analysis
of insect OXPHOS genes
The MitoComp2 dataset [13] includes sequence and structural information about the orthologs of 68 D. melanogaster OXPHOS genes in a set of sequenced insect
genomes diverging enough to make possible the investigation of long term trends in the evolutionary history of
these gene. Table 1 lists the 68 OXPHOS genes addressed
by our analysis. Beside information on D. melanogaster, D.
pseudobscura and A. gambiae OXPHOS genes [11],
MitoComp2 annotates the OXPHOS orthologs in 13
additional insects whose genome has been recently
sequenced: nine Drosophilidae (D. simulans, D. yakuba, D.
erecta, D. ananassae, D. persimilis, D. willistoni, D. mojavensis, D. virilis and D. grimshawi), a second Culicidae (Aedes
aegypti), and three non-dipteran insects (Bombyx mori, Apis
mellifera and Tribolium castaneum).

The Drosophilidae species studied span an evolutionary
time of 40–60 Myr [15,16] (Figure 1A), while A. aegypti
and A. gambiae diverged approximately 180 Mya [17]. A
simplified evolutionary tree including all insect species
studied in this work is shown in Figure 1B. According to
most recent phylogenies, Hymenoptera are shown in the
figure as basal to Coleoptera in the Endopterygota
[18,19].
To identify the putative orthologs of the D. melanogaster
OXPHOS genes in other insect species we performed
whole genome BLAST searches using the CDSs and
amino-acid sequences of the D. melanogaster genes as queries. Orthology/paralogy relationships were inferred from
(1) similarity of gene products, (2) conservation of exon/
intron structure, (3) conservation of microsyntenic gene
order and (4) evidence from phylogenetic trees.
Sequences giving the reciprocal best hits in each genome
were considered members of the orthologous gene cluster
provided that the BLAST E-value was less than 10-30 and

that they could be aligned with the D. melanogaster gene
over at least 60% of the gene length. According to this criterion, all 68 OXPHOS genes investigated were found to
have a counterpart in each insect species studied, except
for five genes that were not identified in A. mellifera and
one in T. castaneum possibly because the relevant genomic
sequences were incomplete or did not give significant
BLAST E-values due to an high level of divergence with the
query sequences.
In total, we have annotated 1336 OXPHOS genes of 16
insect species. Table 2 shows a overwiew of the comparison of the OXPHOS genes in the species addressed in this
work. Each Mitocomp2 gene record shows the exonintron structure of the gene, its annotated genomic
sequence, the mRNA or CDS sequence and the amino acid
sequence of the encoded polypeptide. A textual hyperlink
is also provided to a web page containing comparative
data on the orthologous genes and their duplications in
all Drosophilidae species studied, including comparison
of exon-intron structure, alignments of the coding
sequences and of the deduced amino acid products, and
alignments of the conserved noncoding sequences. Data
on the microsyntenic context and phylogenetic relationships of OXPHOS gene duplicates, when present, are also
reported.
MitoComp2 also contains additional information on the
comparison of the non-Drosophilidae OXPHOS genes
with their D. melanogaster orthologs (taken as representative of the Drosophilidae), providing a link to the multia-

lignment of the coding sequences of the genes compared
where the position of the introns is highlighted; a link to
the multialignment of the deduced amino acid sequences
of the gene products, including their human counterpart;
and finally a schematic drawing comparing the exonintron structure of members of the orthologous gene cluster.
OXPHOS gene structure evolution in insects
Intron sequences are subject to selection not only because
they may contain ORFs or form part of coding sequences
due to alternative splicing, but also because they can play
a regulatory role in transcription or translation, or in
maintaining pre-mRNA secondary structure [2]. However,
the evolutionary mechanisms and dynamics of intron
gain/loss are as yet only incompletely understood. On the
assumption that comparison of the structural organization of OXPHOS genes in an informative range of species
would prove useful to study the mechanisms shaping
gene structure during evolution, we first compared the
exon-intron structure of 68 OXPHOS orthologous genes
in 11 Drosophilidae species, then we assessed intron gain/
loss in the orthologs of these genes in five non Drosophilidae insects. As an example of the results obtained, a visualization of the changes in the exon-intron structure of a
few orthologous gene sets during evolution is shown in
Figure 2. Similar data for all the gene clusters studied are
available at the MitoComp2 website [13].

structure of the OXPHOS genes is completely conserved in
61 out of 68 orthologous gene clusters; 117 out of 127
intron positions are conserved at the same nucleotide
position throughout the species studied, and only 10 discordant positions in seven different genes were found.
Microsyntenic gene order and comparison with non-Drosophilidae insects suggests that nine of the changes are
due to intron loss, one to intron gain (Figure 3 and Additional file 1). Eight orthologous gene clusters comprise
only intronless genes.

intron at a given position in a single species only as a criterion to infer intron gain after lineage divergence, we
observed one lineage-specific gain event in the 11 Drosophilidae species studied, one in A. gambiae, two in A.
aegypti, 36 in B. mori, 27 in A. mellifera and 15 in T. castaneum. It is of course possible that some of the concordant
intron positions are due to independent insertions in different lineages [21,22]; however, this is unlikely to explain
all, or even most, observed intron-position correspondences [23].

Comparison of Drosophilidae and Culicidae indicates
descent from a common Dipteran ancestor for members
of almost all orthologous gene clusters studied; massive
intron loss appears to have occurred indipendently in the
two lineages (Figure 3).

Assuming that positions conserved in multiple insect lineages and also in Vertebrates (see below) represent
retained ancestral introns, the presence of a minimum of
136 introns in the OXPHOS genes of a common ancestor
predating the divergence of insect lineages can be inferred;
of those introns, 63 were lost in Drosophilidae, 63 in A.
gambiae, 64 in A. aegypti, 44 in B. mori, 57 in T. castaneum
but only 20 in A. mellifera (Figure 4 and Table 3).

Comparison of Dipterans with B. mori, T. castaneum and
A. mellifera also indicates descent of non-Dipteran
OXPHOS genes from ancestral intron-rich genes that
existed before the divergence of insect lineages. 32% of
the OXPHOS genes maintain an identical exon-intron
structure in all insect genomes studied, while in 19% a
discordant intron position was observed in at least one
species. In the remaining instances, multiple changes in
gene structure were found. In accord with studies suggesting that recombination between genomic sequences and a
product of reverse transcription of a processed mRNA is
the main mechanism of intron loss in mammals [20], in
most cases only a single intron was lost, while the neighboring introns are conserved; in no case a gap was
observed in the alignment, and the sequences flanking the
lost intron are always strongly conserved.
The amount of both intron loss and intron gain differs
strikingly between insect lineages. Using presence of an

The number of discordant intron positions observed in A.
gambiae and A. aegypti, compared with the data obtained
in Drosophilidae, suggests that the number of intron
gain/loss events is not directly related to divergence time.
Comparing A. gambiae and A. aegypti, on 121 total intron
positions, 12 discordant positions were observed in 11
genes (Figure 3 and Additional file 2); in nine cases, comparison with other species strongly suggests intron loss; in
three, the change in gene structure was most likely due to
intron gain.
Overall, our data support a scenario in which extensive
intron loss from intron-rich ancestral genes occurred during evolution of most insect OXPHOS genes. Intron gain
also appears to have occurred quite often, although much

(Figure 4).
Long term evolution of OXPHOS genes
The tentative scenario inferred from the comparative analysis of OXPHOS gene evolution in insects prompted us to
extend our analysis to other, distantly related evolutionary
lineages. First, we asked whether insect OXPHOS genes
share a subtantial fraction of the intron positions with

their orthologs in vertebrates, which would indicate an
ancient origin predating the insect-vertebrates evolutionary split. To get information on this question we compared the exon-intron structure of the OXPHOS genes in
Fugu, zebrafish and humans with each other and with
their insect orthologs; the human/fish comparison is
highly informative because among sequenced vertebrate
genomes fish genomes are the most distantly related available for comparison with humans (the last common

divergence time substantially longer than the time of
divergence of the insect species studied in this work).
Conservation of intron position, exon phase and exon
length between insect OXPHOS genes and their counterparts in Fugu, Zebrafish and human strongly suggest
descent from a common intron-rich ancestor in 55 out of
68 orthologous gene clusters.
In accord with recent work showing that the exon-intron
structure of the gene is highly conserved throughout Vertebrates [24], very few changes in the organization of the
OXPHOS genes were observed between Fugu and
zebrafish, and, strikingly, between fish and humans. We
found only two gene structure changes in vertebrates: the

Number of intron gains and losses in the OXPHOS genes of
extant insects with respect to the inferred gene structure in
a common ancestor.

ATP5A1 gene, encoding the alpha chain of Complex V, is
interrupted in human, but not in fish (Figure 2).
The last column of Table 3 reports the number of intron
positions shared by human OXPHOS genes with their
orthologs in the insect species studied. In accord with
recent findings suggesting that the honeybee genome is
the slowest evolving of the insect genomes so far
sequenced [25], among the insect species examined A.
mellifera shares the largest number of OXPHOS gene
intron positions with Vertebrates: out of 171 total introns
identified in the OXPHOS genes of A. mellifera, 60% are
conserved at the same position in their human counterparts, while 34% of 301 intron position in human
OXPHOS genes are shared with A. mellifera.
Finally, to extend the evolutionary history of the OXPHOS
genes beyond the recent report that a significant fraction
of human introns are shared with the genome of annelids
[26] and therefore must predate the bilaterian radiation,
we thought of interest to compare the exon-intron structure of 15 human OXPHOS genes with their orthologs in
the cnidarian N. vectensis (as shown in Figure 1C, separation of the cnidarian lineage from Bilateria predates the
Urbilaterian ancestor). This comparison revealed that N.
vectensis shares 80% of the intron OXPHOS gene positions
with Vertebrates, while 84% of the human intron positions are shared by Nematostella (Figure 2 and
MitoComp2 web site [13]). Thus, these introns appear to
have been present in very ancient ancestral genes predating even the cnidarian/Bilateria divergence, and the
remarkable genetic complexity of Nematostella [14],
toghether with the high level of conservation of intron
positions between Cnidarians and Vertebrata, makes
questionable a correlation between morphological complexity and gene structure.

Specific constraints on conservation of individual introns
Specific constraints may act on individual introns, favoring their conservation during evolution. Unsurprisingly,
and in agreement with our previous report concerning a
more limited OXPHOS genes sample [11], the exonintron structure and the alternative splice forms of the
orthologous genes encoding the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase acyl carrier protein (D. melanogaster mtacp1,
CG9160) [27]) and the ATP synthase epsilon chain (sun,
CG9032) [12]), are strictly conserved in all insects studied,
as shown by genomic structure comparison, alignment of
splice variants and EST mapping (see the gene records in
the Mitocomp2 dataset [13]). As suggested by Fedorova
and Fedorov [28], conservation of the first intron at the
5'end of many genes also appears to be under stringent
functional constraints. Because the first exon of most
OXPHOS genes encodes a mitochondrial import signal
and is usually much less conserved than other coding
exons [29,30], its alignment with orthologous regions is
often problematic, and conservation of the first 5' intron
position can only be inferred from phase conservation
and exon length. With this caveat, the conservation at this
position is striking: no loss of this intron was observed in
56 out of 68 orthologous gene clusters, although our analysis necessarily underestimates conservation at this position, since it can only address introns that interrupt the
CDS because conservation of introns in the 5' UTR, that
usually is hardly alignable with orthologous sequences,
cannot be unambigously shown.

As discussed in the next section, conservation of the first
5' intron in OXPHOS genes may have important functional implications depending on the position of the
nuclear regulatory gene motif (NRG) [31]: only 13 intronless genes were found out of a total of 283 genes belonging to 48 orthologous gene clusters in which the energy
regulatory motif is usually located in the first intron of the
coding sequence; on the other hand, when the NRG motif
is located upstream of the CDS (as it is in 18 OXPHOS
gene clusters), the frequency of one-coding-exon genes is
almost 25% (27 out of 107).
Conservation of regulatory elements
The regulation of eukaryotic gene expression is a process
involving many different control mechanisms, including
chromatin structure and cis-regulatory DNA sequences
that bind specific proteins [32]; recent observations
emphasize the importance of intergenic and intronic
sequences in regulating transcription [33]. Cross-species
DNA sequence comparison is an excellent tool for identifying these biologically important elements, because the
level of evolutionary conservation is correlated to the
extent of functional constraints.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/215

We used multialignment footprinting [34] and DNA pattern discovery programs [35,36]) to identify conserved
motifs in noncoding sequences of the OXPHOS genes in
11 Drosophilidae species, two Culicidae (A. gambiae and
A. aegypti), and three non-dipteran insects (B. mori, A. mellifera and T. castaneum).
We focused our attention primarily on the genomic
regions that in D. melanogaster contain the nuclear respiratory gene element (NRG), a palindromic 10-bp motif
(RTTAYRTAAY) shared by all nuclear OXPHOS genes
listed in Table 1 and by many other nuclear genes
involved in the biogenesis and function of the mitochondrion [31]. In D. melanogaster, most NRG elements are
located 160–280 bp downstream of the transcription start
site, most often within an intron.
The criterion for scoring the conserved NRG elements was
presence of a match to the 8 bp core sequence, allowing
for substitutions that maintained the consensus structure
of the element, which we assume necessary for its function (see also [31]). We searched stretches of about 1000
bp, both upstream and downstream of the TSS, for the
presence of the element. With the exception of the
orthologs of the D. melanogaster CG7610 ATPsyn-gamma
gene, containing a conserved variant derivative of the
NRG motif in all the species examined, NRG elements
were identified in all OXPHOS genes annotated. Interestingly, significant conservation of additional nucleotides
flanking the standard 10 bp NRG consensus appears to be
a specific feature of different OXPHOS gene clusters. Such
extension of the NRG motif beyond the consensus "core"
may play a role in the modulation of the expression of
individual OXPHOS genes. MitoComp2 [13] shows the
relevant features of the NRG elements identified in Drosophilidae, i.e. their consensus sequence, position in the
transcriptional unit, and distance from the ATG start site.
Links are provided to the alignments of the genomic
regions encompassing the elements. As a typical example
of the results obtained, Figure 5A shows the multialignment of the NRG-containing intronic sequences of the
Drosophilidae orthologs of the D. melanogaster CG10219
gene encoding the cytochrome b small subunit of complex II.
Multiple NRG motifs are present in several genes: in 13
orthologous genes clusters, genes containing at least two
NRG were found. The number of copies per gene of the
element is variable, but is generally conserved between
orthologs. An extreme case is the D. melanogaster CG1746
gene, encoding the lipid-binding protein P1 of ATP synthase: in the introns of this gene, and in its orthologs in
other Drosophilidae species, seven copies of the element
were identified.

The NRG element was always found downstream of the
transcription start site, in 53 out of 68 orthologous gene
clusters within the first intron of the gene. In all other
cases, with a single exception, it is located either in the second intron or in the putative 5' UTR sequence. Only in the
CG6666 gene cluster, encoding the cytochrome b560 subunit of complex II, the NRG element is located in a coding
exon.
To study the conservation of the NRG element over long
evolutionary times, we also searched noncoding regions
of homologous OXPHOS genes of A. gambiae and A.
aegypti, and of B. mori, A. mellifera and T. castaneum. Notwithstanding a divergence time between A. gambiae and A.
aegypti of approximately 180 Mya, pairwise alignment and
comparison with orthologous noncoding Drosophilidae
sequences identified conserved NRG elements in most
OXPHOS genes of these species, often with conservation
of the subgenic localization (see Figure 5B for an example,
and the MitoComp2 web site [13]), and it was possible to
define a Culicidae NRG consensus for almost all OXPHOS
genes.
NRG sequences were also found in the OXPHOS genes of
the three non-dipteran insect species studied. In A. mellifera, the average number of NRG elements per gene is
higher than in other insects (in 41 out the 63 A. mellifera
OXPHOS genes analyzed more than a single NRG element is present), and a TTATATAA NRG sequence is often
observed, presumably because the A. mellifera genome is
more (A+T)-rich than other insect genomes [25]. The list
of the all NRG elements found in insect species examined,
their position within the transcriptional unit and their distance from the beginning of the CDS (ATG) are shown in
MitoComp2 [13]. Figure 6 displays a logo representation
of the NRG consensus in these species and the associated
position weight matrix.
The distance between NRG elements and the beginning of
the CDS (ATG) is strictly conserved among orthologous
Drosophilidae genes (Figure 7A) and is also generally conserved in the non-Drosophilidae insect species studied
(Figure 7B). When the putative transcription start site of
the gene could be inferred from EST sequences present in
the public databases, a strong bias for a location of the
NRG element approximately 200 bp downstream of the
transcription start site was also observed (Figure 7C). In
our opinion, this suggests a critical spatial relationship
between the NRG position in the transcriptional unit and
the nucleosomal structure of the chromatin, as could be
expected if chromatin-domain related mechanisms were
implied in controlling the expression of OXPHOS genes.
Although NRG elements represent the most conserved
noncoding sequences in orthologous OXPHOS genes,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/215

multispecies alignments also identified other significantly
conserved elements with a tendency to maintain the same
subgenic position, at least in Drosophilidae. Some of
these sequences are strictly conserved in several OXPHOS
gene clusters; others are specific of a single gene cluster
(see Mitocomp2 dataset [13]). As these sequences are
almost certainly subject to strong functional constraints,
our findings further validate the use of intraspecific phylogenetic comparison to identify novel candidate regulatory elements, although there is increasing evidence of
sequences with a cis-regulatory function that exhibit little
if any primary sequence conservation, and cannot therefore be identified by multispecies DNA aligment [37].
We did not attempt a systematic study of the functional
significance of the non-NRG conserved sequences in the
non coding regions of insect OXPHOS genes. However,
we would like to report an intriguing example of the interesting insights into the mechanisms shaping genome evolution that data mining the information available in the
Mitocomp2 will hopefully provide in the future.
The CG1746 gene, encoding the lipid-binding protein P1
of ATP synthase, contains, besides seven highly conserved
copies of the NRG element, at least 15 conserved DNA
blocks of various lengths scattered throughout its non
coding sequences. Eight such DNA stretches, strictly conserved in all the Drosophilidae species studied, are located
within the intron at the 3' end of the gene (see the CG1746
gene entry in Mitocomp2 dataset [13]). A FlyBase [38]
search revealed that in D. melanogaster this intron encompasses the untranslated Ribonuclease P RNA gene
(RNaseP:RNA), and the sequences highly conserved in
this intron are known to be crucial for the ribozyme function [39]. Intriguingly, a search for homologous
sequences in A, gambiae, A, aegypti, A. mellifera, B. mori and
T. castaneum indicated that in these insects the orthologous intron does not contain the Ribonuclease P RNA
gene, which is instead found within an intron of other,
unrelated genes, different in each species (data not
shown).
OXPHOS gene duplications
After previously identifying several duplicates of OXPHOS
genes in D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae
[11], we have now asked the question whether annotation
of OXPHOS genes duplicates in a greater number of insect
species at various levels of divergence could provide further information on the forces that have shaped the evolutionary history of this functionally essential set of genes.
We found one or more paralogs of 22 different OXPHOS
genes in the Drosophilidae species studied. All the identified duplicates of OXPHOS gene appear to be true functional genes, since all present intact ORFs. Assuming that
duplicates found in different microsyntenic contexts orig-

inated from independent duplication events, 34 independent duplication events would be sufficient to explain
all the observed duplicates.
Not surprisingly, since retroposition is probably the most
important mechanism of gene duplication and eventual

evolution of novel genetic functions [40], of the 34 duplication events inferred 26 almost certainly were retropositional events originating duplicates that are intronless or
possess only a very few introns, presumably subsequently
acquired. In contrast, four of the events originated duplicates that maintain the intron/exon structure of the paren-

duplication events. There is no sufficient evidence to
assume either mechanism for the remaining four duplication events.

conservation of microsyntenic gene order and evidence
from phylogenetic trees suggest that 14 of the duplication
events occurred before, and 20 after the Drosophilidae
speciation (Figure 3).

Interestingly, seven of the independent events originated
duplicates within introns of other genes, in support of the
suggestion that retrocopies can become functional genes
by exploiting the regulatory elements and the open chromatin state of neighboring transcriptional units [41]. Presence of the duplication in all the species studied,

We also found duplications of the OXPHOS genes in nonDrosophilidae. Eight independent duplication events
were observed in A. gambiae, four in A. aegypti (assuming
for convenience that in this species the 80 or more copies
of the Aaeg/CG4692 gene, encoding the f chain of ATP
synthase, originated from a single amplification event),

seven in B. mori, two in A. mellifera and three in T. castaneum. Seven of these duplications involve genes also
duplicated in Drosophilidae, so, although pair-wise
orthology can not be reliably assigned between duplicates
in Drosophila and in other insects, they were probably
present in a common ancestor of all the insect species
adressed in this work.
It should be noted that the number of OXPHOS gene
duplication events inferred to have occurred in Drosophilidae is significantly higher than in any of the other insect
lineages examined. This fact could indicate the existence
in Drosophilidae of special mechanisms favoring the fixation of OXPHOS gene paralogs in the genome, or,
together with the high number of intron gain/loss events
in Drosophilidae reported in a previous section, indicate
an especially high level of retrotranscriptional activity in
this lineage.
In D. melanogaster and in A. gambiae, OXPHOS gene duplicates are expressed at a much lower level than their parent
genes, as inferred by the abundance in the public databases of ESTs derived from their transcripts; moreover, in
D. melanogaster they exhibit a strongly testis-biased pattern of expression [11]. Based on this data, we suggested
that acquiring a new pattern of expression could be
required to maintain a duplicate copy of certain genes in
the genome. In support of this hypothesis, in an EST
library from D. yakuba testes (WashU Drosophila Yakuba
EST Project) the expression of OXPHOS gene duplicates is
also strongly testis-biased (not shown). That similar
mechanisms could favor fixation of gene duplications not
only in insects, but also in other organisms is suggested by
the independently formulated "out of the testes" hypothesis [41], proposing that in primates functional retrogenes are initially expressed in testes and only later evolve
different expression patterns and potentially novel genetic
functions.
The study of the conservation of the NRG putative regulatory element in insect OXPHOS genes presented in this
paper (see above) provides intriguing evidence suggesting
a possible mechanism to maintain OXPHOS gene duplications in the genome. In total, we have identified 215
OXPHOS gene duplicates in the insect species studied. In
214 out of the 215 cases we found one or more NRG elements only in one of the identified paralogs. Conservation of microsynteny (where possible to ascertain, i.e., in
Drosophilidae) and of the structural organization of the
gene strongly suggest that the genes maintaining the NRG
element are the direct phylogenetic derivatives (true functional orthologs) of the ancestral insect genes responsible
for the basic housekeeping function of energy production.
On the other hand, the NRG motif is absent (or, as shown
in the examples of Additional file 3, sharply diverges from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/215

the consensus) in almost all OXPHOS gene duplicates
that have achieved long-term fixation in the genome.
While the absence of the NRG motif is of course expected
in duplicates originated by retroposition of genes in
which the element is located in an intron, it suggests preferential loss due to selective constraints in duplicates originated by segmental duplication, or by retroposition from
the 26 genes in which it is in the 5'UTR. The single exception showing conservation of a standard NRG element in
the 5'UTR of two paralogs of the same gene concerns a
duplicate of the mtacp1 gene, encoding the acyl carrier
protein of complex I, which is found in D. persimilis but
not in its sister species D. pseudoobscura. The 100% identity shared not only in the CDS but also in the UTRs
regions with one of the mRNAs generated by the alternative splicing of the mtacp1 gene transcript, the lack of the
introns and of the promoter region and a target-site duplication of eight bp flanking the duplicate suggest that it
derives from one of the more recent retroposition events
documented to date (see the mtacp1 gene entry in
MitoComp2 dataset [13]).
Conservation of the NRG element, and probably of its
localization in the transcriptional unit, are evolutionary
constraints expected to act in a specific manner on
OXPHOS genes; however, we would like to suggest that
loss of regulatory elements and consequent changes in the
pattern of expression of the gene could be a general mechanisms that facilitates the fixation of duplications in the
genome when, as in the case of genes encoding products
that are part of multiprotein complexes, the presence of
multiple gene copies with the original pattern of expression would be deleterious [42]. In turn, this could allow
the development of novel genetic functions that is usually
assumed to be the main evolutionary advantage of gene
duplication [43].

Conclusion
We have cataloged the orthologs, as identified by
sequence homology, conservation of microsynteny and
structural organization, of 68 nuclear genes that control
oxidative phoshorylation in 11 Drosophilidae species
whose genomic sequencing has been recently completed,
and in five non-Drosophilidae insect species, and compiled a web-based dataset, MitoComp2 [13], containing
all data on which this paper is based and available online.
Our results indicate that a common ancestor of the insect
lineages examined possessed intron rich OXPHOS genes
and that extensive intron loss occurred during evolution;
lineage-specific intron gain also occurred, least frequently
in Dipterans. Furthermore, comparison with the very distantly related vertebrate and cnidarian lineages shows that
many of the OXPHOS genes introns already existed in
ancestral genes predating the cnidarian/Bilateria evolutionary split.

Comparative analysis also suggests that conservation of
the nuclear respiratory gene element, constantly conserved in the OXPHOS gene orthologs of all the insect species examined, has played a key role in the evolution of
the insect OXPHOS genes. Furthermore, we found one or
more paralogs of 22 different OXPHOS genes in the Drosophilidae species studied, and showed that only the
functional orthologs of the ancestral insect genes responsible for the basic housekeeping function of energy production maintain the NRG element, while their paralogs,
either originated by retrotranscription or by segmental
duplication either completely lack the NRG element or
possess only presumably non-functional relics of the
motif. Based on this data, we suggest that changes in the
pattern of expression of the gene (as testis-specific expression) could facilitate the fixation of duplications in the
genome and in turn the development of novel genetic
functions.

Methods
BlastN and TBlastN [44] searches of contigs, scaffolds and
ESTs from FlyBase [38] were performed using D. melanogaster OXPHOS CDSs and peptides listed in the MitoDrome database [12] as queries to identify orthologous
OXPHOS genes and their duplications in Drosophilidae
and other insect genomes.
Sequence sources: D. erecta, D. ananassae, D mojavensis, D.
virilis and D. grimshawi were sequenced by Agencourt, D.
simulans and D. yakuba were sequenced at Washington
University, D. persimilis and A. aegypti were sequenced by
the Broad Institute, D. willistoni was sequenced by TIGR,
D. melanogaster was sequenced by the Berkeley Drosophila
Genome Project and Celera [45], D. pseudoobscura [46], T.
castaneum and A. mellifera [25] were sequenced at Baylor,
A. gambiae was sequenced by the Anopheles Genome
Consortium [47], B. mori was sequenced at the Southwest
Agricultural University [48] and by the Silkworm Genome
Research Program [49].
Contigs, scaffolds and ESTs from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [50] and StellaBase
[51] were searched using the human OXPHOS peptides
from Swiss-Prot [52] to identify orthologous OXPHOS
genes and their duplications in F. rubripes, zebrafish (D.
rerio) and N. vectensis. Additionally, single-trace sequences
were screened at the TraceSite of NCBI [50] using MEGABlast and were assembled manually. Human genomic and
mRNA sequences were retrieved from Ensembl [53].
Duplicate gene pairs within a genome were identified as
best reciprocal hits with an E-value of less than 10-20 in
both directions in a TBLASTN search using the default
parameters. For convenience, each newly identified insect
gene is indicated in this paper by a term comprising the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/215

abbreviation of the species followed by the CG number of
its counterpart in D. melanogaster.
Multialignments of amino acid, and of coding and noncoding sequences and visualization of dendrograms were
obtained using the MultAlin 5.4.1 software [34] from the
MultAlin server [54].
The genomic sequence of each gene identified was
searched manually for exon-intron boundaries and the
predicted transcribed sequence was reconstructed in silico.
All insect genomic, mRNA/CDS and amino acid
sequences utilized for this study are archived at the
MitoComp2 web site [13]; the vertebrate and Nematostella
genomic sequences recovered are available on request
from C.C.
To identify NRG motifs and other conserved elements in
noncoding sequences of Drosophilidae OXPHOS genes,
we aligned members of each orthologous gene cluster,
manually defined exon-intron boundaries, and searched
for DNA stretches maintaining high consensus in all the
Drosophilidae species studied. Pair wise alignment and
comparison with orthologous Drosophilidae sequences
was used to identify conserved NRG elements in noncoding sequences of A. gambiae and A. aegypti OXPHOS genes.
To identify NRG motifs in B. mori, A. mellifera and T. castaneum OXPHOS genes we used the Weeder pattern discovery program [35] and the Regulatory Sequence
Analysis Tools from the RSAT server [55]. Position weight
matrices (PWM) were created with the Consensus software from the RSAT server. The graphical representations
of NRG motifs as sequence logos [56] were generated
using WebLogo [57].
