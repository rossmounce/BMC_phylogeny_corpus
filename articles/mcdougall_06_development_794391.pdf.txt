Abstract
Background: To understand the evolution of animals it is essential to have taxon sampling across
a representative spread of the animal kingdom. With the recent rearrangement of most of the
Bilateria into three major clades (Ecdysozoa, Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia) it has become
clear that the Lophotrochozoa are relatively poorly represented in our knowledge of animal
development, compared to the Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia. We aim to contribute towards
redressing this balance with data on the development of the muscular, nervous and ciliary systems
of the annelid Pomatoceros lamarckii (Serpulidae). We compare our data with other
lophotrochozoans.
Results: P. lamarckii develops locomotory and feeding structures that enable it to become a
swimming, planktotrophic larva within 24 hours. Formation of the trochophore includes
development of a prototroch, metatroch and neurotroch, development of apical and posterior
nervous elements at similar times, and development of musculature around the ciliary bands and
digestive tract prior to development of any body wall muscles. The adult nervous and muscular
systems are essentially preformed in the late larva. Interestingly, the muscular systems of the larvae
and juvenile worms do not include the circular muscles of the body wall, which are considered to
be plesiomorphic for annelids, although the possibility that circular muscles develop after these
stages cannot be ruled out at this point.
Conclusion: A comparison between polychaetes shows variability in the timing (heterochrony) of
development of body wall muscles and elements of the nervous system. These heterochronies are
one route for evolution of different life history strategies, such as adaptations to feeding
requirements.

Background
Analysis of molecular data has changed our understanding of bilaterian phylogeny, and produced the clades

known as Ecdysozoa, Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia. With this new view of bilaterian relationships, it is
apparent that established model organisms, such as DroPage 1 of 14

sophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Ciona intestinalis, and Mus musculus are restricted to only two out of the
three major phylogenetic groups, the Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia [1]. Therefore, the accumulation of developmental and morphological data for taxa within the
Lophotrochozoa is required to help distinguish patterns
of conservation or convergence within the Bilateria and
address questions about the evolution of the three major
clades. Recently, some lophotrochozoan model systems
have begun to be developed (for example, Platynereis
dumerilii [2] and Haliotis asinina [3,4]), but studies on
these organisms must be coupled with wider investigations in order to understand the diversity of developmental processes in the clade.
Within the Lophotrochozoa, many polychaete annelids
display a classic vermiform and triploblastic body organisation [5] and possess relatively conserved gene sequences
with respect to other bilaterians [6]. For these reasons they
have been proposed by several authors to exhibit 'ancestral' bilaterian qualities and to be an excellent model system to study animal evolution and development [5,6].
However polychaete annelids are a speciose and morphologically diverse group, and investigation of their evolution and development needs to be coupled with further
exploration of two areas. First, the phylogenetic relationships within the annelids are largely unresolved, with conflicting topologies achieved from molecular and cladistic
methods [7-10]. Second, comparative embryological,
developmental and genomic work should encompass a
diverse range of annelids, as this will enable a more robust
reconstruction of their ancestral condition.
The use of modern microscopy and immunohistochemical techniques has greatly aided our understanding of
lesser known taxa, such as sipunculans [11], acoels [12],
cycliophorans [13], entoprocts [14], and phoronids [15].
The most informative of these studies examine the development of various structures throughout the different life
stages of the animal, enabling comparisons of the developmental pathways of different taxa and the formation of
evolutionary hypotheses. While work of this nature has
begun for the polychaete annelids [16-19], further work
needs to be carried out to get a clear picture of development from embryo to adult in a variety of polychaete
groups.
Segrove [20] described the development of the serpulid
Pomatoceros triqueter, and the majority of his study (with
the exception of his description of metamorphosed animals) has been corroborated by other work [21,22]. In
addition, the literature contains some reconstructions of
the serpulid nervous system by light microscopy [23-25].
This study aims to build on these previous studies by
examining myogenesis, neurogenesis and ciliation in the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/16

tube-building polychaete, Pomatoceros lamarckii (Serpulidae) (see Fig. 1), using methods that are directly comparable to similar work being carried out on other invertebrate
taxa. These events are investigated throughout embryogenesis, larval life and metamorphosis and the results represent a significant increase in the information available
from the polychaete annelids.

Results
Development
P. lamarckii embryos undergo equal spiral cleavage and
form a hollow blastula (Fig. 2A) which, during gastrulation, forms a blastopore at the posterior pole (Fig. 2B).
This blastopore elongates and becomes slit-like, the lateral
edges of the slit draw together (Fig. 2C) and fuse to produce two apertures, which subsequently become the
mouth and anus. In some annelid species these apertures
may close and re-open later in development [26], but this
was not observed in P. lamarckii. Within 24 hours the
embryo has developed into a diamond-shaped, planktotrophic larva (Fig 2D). The mouth has migrated ventroanteriorly and assumed its final position just below the
ciliated prototroch, whereas the anus is situated posteriorly on the dorsal side. After the next 24 hours the development of the trochophore is complete. Additional ciliary
bands include the metatroch and neurotroch, and an apical tuft is situated at the anterior extreme of the larva (Fig
1A, Fig. 2E). This 'complete larva' stage is maintained for
several days before the hyposphere begins to elongate
posteriorly (the 'elongation phase', Fig. 2F). The elongation phase is followed by the formation of a metatrochophore larva that possesses three segments, each with a set
of chaetae (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2G). The metatrochophore larvae
spend a period of time exploring surfaces before attaching
and initiating metamorphosis, which involves the loss of
ciliary bands, the emergence of adult structures such as the
primary filaments of the branchial crown, the thoracic
membrane, and collar, and the secretion of a mucous tube
that later becomes calcified (Fig. 1C, D; Fig. 2H, I). P.
lamarckii is known to require various cues in order to settle
and metamorphose [27], and in several cases the biofilm
that developed within the culture vessel was sufficient to
induce settlement. Time taken to reach the metatrochophore stage varied from 9–16 days, even within a single
culture separated into several dishes, possibly due to different larval densities or food levels. Due to this variation
developmental stages are not assessed according to age
but instead according to morphological features.
Muscle development
Muscle development was visualised using phalloidin, a
compound that binds to F-actin. Staining is first visible
just after gastrulation has commenced, as a horseshoeshaped strip associated with the developing gut (Fig. 3A).
As the mouth migrates anteriorly away from the anus, F-

actin staining in the oesophagus, stomach and intestine
becomes more obvious (Fig. 3B). The zonulae adhaerens
(a particular type of cellular junction) also bind phalloidin at this stage (Fig. 3A, B).
At the early trochophore stage (Fig. 3C) bands of circular
muscle have begun to form around the oesophagus and a
large muscle can be seen running alongside the intestine
from its origin near the stomach to the dorsally located
anus. The prototroch muscle ring has also developed by
this stage. Once a complete trochophore has developed,
the oesophageal musculature is more prominent, particularly around the mouth. An additional circular muscle
ring has developed and is associated with the metatroch
(Fig. 3D).

dorso-laterally. The origin of these muscles is within the
anterior muscle mass, which consists of several loops of
fibres that either wrap around the stomach dorsally or
arch anteriorly to come into close contact with the apical
organ before progressing ventrally to connect with the
oesophageal musculature. At the posterior end of the animal another muscle mass is present, running obliquely
from the ventral surface (anterior to the anal vesicle) to
the dorsal surface near the anus. The prototroch muscle
ring now consists of two distinct bands, whereas the metatroch muscle ring consists of one band that follows the
metatroch around its entire circumference. An extra muscle band can be seen in close proximity of this band on the
dorsal side of the animal, however this muscle band
passes anterior to the mouth on the ventral side.

The elongation phase of the larva (Fig. 3E) is associated
with the development of many more muscles, most of
which are retained after metamorphosis. At this stage the
four longitudinal muscles develop, which all originate at
a similar position anterior to the stomach and extend posteriorly in two pairs, one ventro-laterally and the other

The metatrochophore (Fig. 3F) exhibits an increase in
muscle fibres within the four longitudinal muscles, making them the most prominent muscles in the animal. The
number of muscle fibres in the prototroch and metatroch
also increases (data not shown). Complex musculature
associated with the formation of chaetae is present in

three pairs corresponding with the three larval segments.
A thin transverse muscle is also present in each segment
and appears to associate with the chaetae.
After metamorphosis the majority of the metatrochophore musculature is still present (Fig. 3G). The four longitudinal muscles run the length of the animal, inserting
at the base of the branchial crown. The intestinal muscle
traces the majority of the intestine. The oesophageal musculature is funnel shaped and its position reflects the
migration of the mouth which is now present at the anterior of the organism. New musculature includes the oper-

cular and branchial crown muscles, the branchial crown
retractors, the collar muscles and a ring of muscle around
the anus. The prototroch and metatroch circular muscles
are apparently resorbed along with their associated ciliary
bands.
Ciliary bands
The first ciliated structure to develop is the prototroch,
which forms primarily from two rows of cells soon after
gastrulation (Fig. 2C; Fig. 4A). Each cell is multiciliate,
and initially there is a break in the prototroch on the dorsal side of the animal. Before this break is closed, the cilia

of the apical tuft are formed (Fig. 4B). At these stages the
ciliated cells themselves are reactive to anti-acetylated
tubulin (Fig. 4A, B).
As the larvae near the feeding stage (Fig. 2D; Fig. 4C, D)
the mouth opening has migrated to its ventral position
beneath the prototroch. Underneath the prototroch a
broad band of shorter cilia (the adoral ciliary band)
forms. A third band of cilia, the metatroch, also forms at
this time and encircles the larva at the level of the posterior edge of the mouth. Cilia in the oesophagus and stomach are also obvious. The ciliated bands, including the
neurotroch that runs longitudinally along the ventral side
of the larva posterior to the mouth, are fully developed in
the complete trochophore (Fig. 2E; Fig. 4E, F, G). There is
no obvious ventral break in the metatroch to allow the
neurotroch to reach the mouth. The anus is clearly distinguishable by the tuft of cilia that emerge from it, and
paired protonephridia can be traced from the anus to a
region in the proximity of the metatroch (Fig. 4F, G).

metatrochophore (Fig. 5F) the commissures and associated immunoreactive cells are visible and correspond to
the newly formed segments. The cerebral ganglion has
formed, and the apical organ is reduced but still present.
Paired FMRFamidergic fibres can be seen on either side of
the cerebral ganglion and may be associated with the eyespots. Fainter fibres can be seen encircling the mouth,
and, more posteriorly, the lower intestine. A faint nerve
fibre (medial nerve) can be seen between the two ventral
nerve cords, this becomes more pronounced at the posterior extremity of the larva.
After metamorphosis the apical organ is no longer visible,
the most anterior FMRFamidergic structure is now the cerebral ganglion (Fig. 5G). As in the larvae, this cerebral
ganglion is connected to the two ventral nerve cords and
associated commissures that continue to the posterior of
the animal (obscured partly in the figure by gut autofluorescence). The medial nerve is still present. In addition to
these retained features, fibres can be seen running alongside the intestine.

In the elongating larva and metatrochophore ciliary patterns remain much the same, except that the neurotroch
becomes denser towards the posterior pole of the animal
and no longer reaches anteriorly to the mouth (Fig. 2G;
Fig. 4H). Much of the larval ciliation is lost at metamorphosis, with the exception of that in the gut. Cilia form on
the developing branchial crown (Fig. 4I), and in later
stages bands of cilia, which are the beginnings of the adult
faecal groove, appear on the dorsal side of the animal (Fig.
2I).

Serotonergic nervous system
The first serotonergic cell appears at the blastoporal pole
of the embryo at approximately the same stage that FMRFamide signal is visible in the apical region (Fig. 6A). This
cell has a large process that it sends to the very posterior of
the larva; the cell and its process persist throughout larval
development. A second, less reactive cell becomes visible
shortly after the posterior serotonergic cell and is situated
in the mouth region.

FMRFamidergic nervous system
The first FMRFamidergic signal appears in the apical organ
just after the appearance of the apical tuft (Fig. 5A). Staining in this region becomes more intense during early
development (Fig. 5B) and is restricted to the apical organ
until the trochophore is almost fully developed. At this
stage (Fig. 5C), FMRFamidergic processes with a ventral
trajectory can be seen emerging from the apical organ. A
nerve ring is also visible around the opening from the
stomach into the intestine. Another much more weakly
fluorescent nerve ring can be seen in the oesophagus near
its entry into the stomach (data not shown). This nerve
ring is much more visible in the complete trochophore
(Fig. 5D), where it is much larger in diameter and in closer
proximity to the mouth.

When the mouth has reached its final ventral position
under the prototroch, much of the trochophore nervous
system is in place (Fig. 6B, C). The prototroch possesses a
serotonergic nerve ring, and there are several fibres associating with the mouth and oesophagus. A process that runs
midventrally to the apical organ also originates at the
junction between the oesophageal nerves and the prototroch nerves. The posterior serotonergic cell sends processes anteriorly; these connect with the prototroch and are
the precursors of the ventral nerve cords. The second,
more weakly fluorescent posterior cell is now located
below the mouth in the position of the future
suboesophageal ganglion. A nerve ring later appears that
runs around the larva in the vicinity of the metatroch (Fig.
6D).

In the elongating larva FMRFamidergic fibres appear in
the paired ventral nerve cords (Fig. 5E). These connect to
the cerebral ganglion, which develops in pockets lateral
and posterior to the apical organ, via the circumoesophageal connectives. The ventral nerve cords also associate
with the nerve ring that encircles the mouth. Commissures begin to form between the ventral nerve cords. In the

At the elongation stage (Fig. 6E), the serotonin reactivity
in the apical organ increases and high levels of serotonin
are present in the developing cerebral ganglion and circumoesophageal connectives. The cerebral ganglion, apical
organ, circumoesophageal connectives and ventral nerve
cords are reactive for both anti-FMRFamide and anti-serotonin, although it is not known if these co-localise in the

Discussion
Myogenesis
Annelid muscles have been studied in depth in the adults
of several species [8,28,29] but investigations of the
ontogeny of these muscle systems are largely lacking.
Phalloidin labelling of F-actin has facilitated studies of
myogenesis in many invertebrate phyla, including acoels
[12], molluscs [30,31], entoprocts [14], phoronids [15],
cycliophorans [13] and sipunculans [11]. One study of
phalloidin labelling in Capitella sp. 1 larvae [16] shows

that myogenesis in this polychaete annelid first begins
with a ring of muscle around the stomodaeum and is followed by the development of numerous longitudinal and
then circular body-wall muscles. These muscles persist in
the adult. Capitella, however, possesses non-feeding larvae
that are brooded and emerge as highly derived metatrochophores, skipping the typical trochophore stage
[16,32]. In P. lamarckii, myogenesis is first seen in the
developing gut. Oesophageal muscles and the prototroch
and metatroch muscle bands form in the trochophore
larva, and body wall musculature is not added until the
trochophore elongates to form the metatrochophore. It
therefore appears that a change in timing has occurred in
the development of P. lamarckii and Capitella, with

Capitella developing body wall musculature first, and P.
lamarckii forming the musculature of the digestive system
before any body wall muscles. This is an example of heterochrony in development and appears to correlate with
the different feeding strategies of the two species, with the
planktotrophic P. lamarckii developing feeding musculature earlier in development whereas in the non-feeding
Capitella larvae the process is delayed. Which, if either,
represents the ancestral pattern of myogenesis is a moot
point, as it is a matter of debate as to whether lecithotrophic or planktotrophic larvae are basal [33-35]. In both
cases, however, the body wall musculature that develops
in the larva persists through to adulthood. This is likely to
be a common feature of polychaete annelid larval development.
A prototroch muscle ring has been observed in many molluscan larvae, including polyplacophora, bivalves and
gastropods, but is distinctly lacking in the scaphopod
Antalis entalis [30,31]. In addition, the sipunculan Phascolion strombus lacks a muscle ring associated with its prototroch [11]. Although the homology of the mollusc and
annelid prototroch (and its muscle) is likely, based on
embryological considerations [26], the possible
(although still uncertain) placement of the Sipuncula as a
sister group to the annelids [36,37] raises the possibility
that the prototroch muscles are independent innovations
in molluscs and annelids. A more likely explanation is
that the sipunculan prototroch and its associated structures are secondarily reduced. In sipunculans, the prototroch does not develop to its full extent, and the animal
uses a post-oral ring of cilia for locomotion [38]. This
could explain the lack of muscles (and nerves) in the
sipunculan prototroch, and does not invalidate the
hypothesis that the prototroch is a homologous structure
in trochozoans.
In addition to the prototroch muscle ring, P. lamarckii also
possesses a metatroch muscle ring. This muscle ring has
been described in other polychaete species [19,24]; however its distribution outside the Annelida is undocumented.
P. lamarckii exhibits no circular muscle in the body wall
(except for the prototroch and metatroch muscle bands)
in larvae or juveniles. Muscles repeated in the segments of
later stages are components of the chaetal musculature
(see Fig. 3F), and should not be confused with circular
muscles [28]. The widely accepted view on adult annelid
musculature is that the body wall consists of an outer layer
of circular muscle and an inner layer of longitudinal muscle [5]. This general assumption has been challenged by
the finding that members of several groups of polychaete
annelids lack circular muscle altogether [28,29]. The
transverse muscles seen in P. lamarckii are not likely to be

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/16

rudiments of these circular muscles as they are associated
with the chaetae and not with the body wall. Thus reinvestigation into the ancestral state for body wall muscles in
the Annelida is warranted, which must be combined with
a more robust annelid phylogeny [10,28,29].
Ciliation
P. lamarckii larvae possess a conspicuous prototroch,
which is the first ciliary feature to appear on the developing embryo. The prototroch ring is initially open on the
dorsal side of the larva, as has been documented in other
polychaetes [18,26], and appears to form from two rows
of cells. Additional cells may contribute to the prototroch
as seen in other annelids [39], but these were not visible
here. Later ciliation in P. lamarckii is quite typical for trochophore larvae and consists of an apical tuft, adoral ciliary zone, metatroch, and neurotroch, i.e., all the
components of the 'opposed-band feeding' system [34]. A
ventral break in the metatroch, allowing the neurotroch to
reach anteriorly to the mouth, has been described previously for some annelids [24,26]. This does not appear to
be the case in P. lamarckii, instead the metatroch appears
to be continuous with cilia that run inside the oesophagus. P. lamarckii lacks a telotroch at all stages of development. Early in development, cilia become visible in the
developing gut and tubulin staining clearly highlights a
pair of protonephridia, which either lead to the anus or a
paired opening in the vicinity of the anus. These protonephridia can not be seen in later stages, and possibly degenerate, as is the case in some phyllodocid larvae [40]. Antitubulin immunohistochemistry has been used in numerous studies to visualise axon fibres in developing larvae
(for example see [18,41,42]), however in P. lamarckii
intense staining of ciliated bands made visualisation of
neural elements impossible until the late stages of development.
Neurogenesis in P. lamarckii
Immunohistochemical analyses of neurogenesis have
been carried out on the larvae of three polychaetes, Polygordius lacteus (Polygordiidae) [19], Phyllodoce maculata
(Phyllodocidae) [18] and Pomatoceros lamarckii (Serpulidae) (this study). These larvae show basic similarities; all
develop paired ventral nerve cords, possess a suboesophageal ganglion, an apical organ and later a cerebral ganglion, develop a prototrochal nerve ring and a complex of
nerves in the oesophagus (described in detail in [24]). The
larvae differ in terms of the timing of formation of various
features, and there are some differences in neuronal structures. Each of these larvae are morphologically and developmentally different, with P. lamarckii possessing a freeswimming planktotrophic larva, P. maculata possessing an
initially encapsulated larva [18] and P. lacteus possessing
a free-swimming larva that develops adult segments
inside the hyposphere in later larval stages [19,43]. P. mac-

Frontiers in Zoology 2006, 3:16

ulata and P. lamarckii are most likely phylogenetically distant from one another, while the position of the
Polygordiidae is still unresolved [43]. Neurogenesis in a
species of Myzostomidae has also been described but will
not be discussed here as the phylogenetic placement of
this species is uncertain and their body plans are highly
derived, due to their parasitic lifestyle [17,42].
The finding that neurogenesis in gastropods proceeds
from the posterior periphery of the organism to the anterior and centre challenged the widely held view that neurogenesis follows a strictly anterior to posterior pattern in
these animals [44,45]. In response to this Voronezhskaya
and colleagues [18] examined neural development in the
polychaete Phyllodoce maculata to investigate whether this
posterior-first pattern was more widespread. In P. maculata the first immunoreactive cell is a posterior serotonergic cell that gives rise to the ventral nerve cords.
Immunostaining in the apical region is not seen until
twelve hours later. Therefore, neurogenesis in P. maculata
is similar to that seen in molluscs, i.e. progressing from
the periphery to the centre.
The posterior serotonergic cell seen first in P. maculata
neurogenesis is strikingly similar to the posterior serotonergic cell seen early in P. lamarckii development. Both cells
are in a similar position in the embryo and contribute
fibres to the ventral nerve cords. In P. lamarckii, however,
this cell arises at a very similar time to (if not after) the first
anti-FMRFamide signals in the apical organ. It is
unknown whether neurogenesis in P. lacteus begins at the
anterior or posterior of the embryo because data on the
early stages is not available [19]. In light of these studies,
peripheral to central neurogenesis does not appear to be
the case in all polychaetes. We suggest the mode of neurogenesis is variable and subject to heterochronic shifts
depending on the life history of the organism, i.e., that
planktotrophic species require the development of anterior and posterior neural elements early in development
for coordination of swimming and/or feeding, whereas
lecithotrophic species do not require the anterior elements until later in development.
The neuroanatomy of the polychaetes studied showed
several features that are shared between many trochozoans. A prototroch nerve ring is found in all three species, and a metatroch nerve ring is found in P. lamarckii
and P. lacteus (P. maculata lacks a metatroch). In both P.
lacteus and P. maculata these nerve rings are reactive for
both serotonin and FMRFamide, whereas in P. lamarckii
only serotonin staining is observed. These nerve rings possess multiple fibres, an observation that has also been
made in the prototroch of bivalve molluscs [46], and the
marginal ciliary band of the pilidium larvae of nemerteans [47], while polyplacophorans and ectoprocts have a

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/16

more extensive nerve net [48,49]. Therefore, complex
innervation of ciliary bands may be a common feature of
Lophotrochozoa. A medial nerve, situated between the
ventral nerve cords, is only seen in P. lamarckii, although
it appears to develop in the very late larvae and may have
been present in stages outside the scope of the study by
Voronezhskaya et al. (2002). This median nerve is likely
to be homologous to the 'neurotroch nerve' of Spirobranchus polycerus described by Lacalli [24] using transmission
electron microscopy. Both the prototroch nerve ring and
the median nerve have been identified in several other trochozoan taxa, although the neurotransmitter content of
these structures varies [11,38,45,50]. Neurotransmitter
content of a neuron can change during development
[51,52], therefore the difference in neurotransmitters does
not necessarily mean these structures are not homologous. This also applies to the ventral nerve cords, which
are considered to be homologous in protostomes but also
differ in neurotransmitter content [53].
Comparisons with earlier reconstructions of the serpulid
nervous system using light microscopy [24] shows that
visualisation using antibodies against FMRF-amide and
serotonin gives a comprehensive picture of neurogenesis
in these animals. From his reconstructions, Lacalli [24]
stated that the larval nervous system in S. polycerus consisted of two separate parts: the pre-trochal part comprising the apical organ, prototroch, and connections
between, and the oral part comprising pharyngeal nerves,
the metatroch nerves and the neurotroch nerve. He also
proposed that the adult nervous system develops entirely
separately from the larval nervous system. This latter finding was disputed by Voronezhskaya and colleagues [18],
and is not supported by this study. Both Voronezhskaya et
al. [15] and ourselves were able to detect the posterior serotonergic cell and the rudiments of the ventral nerve
cords, which were either missed in the S. polycerus reconstructions or are not present in this particular polychaete
annelid [24]. In the immunohistochemical studies on P.
maculata connections were seen between the oesophageal
nerves and the prototroch [18]. In our P. lamarckii study
connections between what Lacalli [24] calls the pre-trochal and oral systems were also detected, notably between
the metatroch and ventral nerve cords. The larval nervous
system of polychaetes is thus interconnected, and reorganises into the adult nervous system at metamorphosis.
In the metatrochophore of P. lamarckii, the serotonergic
ventral nerve cords have a double appearance (Fig. 6F).
The pattern seen here strongly resembles that seen in
Lacalli's reconstruction of S. polycerus [24], where the
inner cords give rise to the anterior-most commissures
and the outer cords give rise to those toward the posterior
pole. However, it is not known how integrated the two

Page 11 of 14

Frontiers in Zoology 2006, 3:16

parts of the cords are to each other, and therefore whether
they should be treated as separate nerve cords.
Phylogenetic considerations
Molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown that Annelida and Sipuncula are closely allied taxa [54,55]. Indeed,
the nervous systems of the two groups are similar [11].
The ventral nerve cords and cerebral ganglia are reactive
for serotonin and FMRFamide in both taxa, and the dominant neurotransmitter in the apical organ in early stages
is FMRFamide. Both P. lamarckii and the sipunculan Phascolion strombus possess an FMRFamidergic medial nerve
and peripheral nerves associated with the viscera. In late
larval stages convergence of serotonergic fibres in the ventral nerve cords can be seen posteriorly in both species.
Obviously, these features are not shared by all groups of
annelids and sipunculans, for example the annelids Phyllodoce maculata and Polygordius lacteus do not show any
evidence of a medial nerve [18,19]. However the fact that
members of both phyla possess these characters is consistent with a close relationship between the two taxa. Similar
comparisons with other lophotrochozoan taxa can be
made when more data are available.

Conclusion
This study adds to the growing bank of morphological
and developmental data that is accumulating for lophotrochozoan taxa. This data and comparisons between
groups will help us to answer major questions about the
evolution of the Bilateria. For example, this study is consistent with previous hypotheses that the prototroch nerve
ring, apical organ, ventral nerve cords and medial nerve
are basal characters for trochozoans [49,53]. It also shows
that the larval nervous system is interconnected rather
than consisting of unconnected pre-trochal and oral systems, and is rearranged at metamorphosis to form the
adult nervous system, observations that have bearings on
the evolution of the biphasic life cycle.
The comparison of the results from this study with those
of other polychaetes gives major insight into the diversification of annelid body plans. It highlights that the timing
of developmental events such as anterior and posterior
nervous system formation and gut and body wall myogenesis is variable between polychaete taxa. Heterochronies, such as changes in the timing of developmental
events or switching of two processes in developmental
time, can cause major changes in the gross morphology of
animals (see [56] for review). These changes enable animals to develop different life history strategies, such as
early feeding. Heterochrony can thus be a major adaptive
route in evolution and further investigation into its
molecular basis will reveal the mechanisms by which this
evolution occurs.

Methods
Animal collection and larval culture
Adult P. lamarckii (Quatrefages, 1865) were collected
from the littoral zone at Tinside, Plymouth, UK, and were
maintained at 12°C in a recirculating aquarium system.
Adult worms (Fig. 1D) were removed from tubes by
breaking open the posterior section and forcing the animals backwards using a blunt probe. Fertile animals
began releasing gametes at this stage. Male and female
worms were immediately transferred to separate Petri
dishes or six-well plates containing filtered, UV treated
seawater (FSW). Eggs were rinsed through a 100 μm cell
strainer (Falcon) to remove tube debris, and then collected in a 40 μm cell strainer (Falcon). The strainer was
then transferred to a Petri dish containing a dilute sperm
suspension, agitated, and left for 10 minutes to allow fertilisation to occur. Eggs were rinsed and gently washed
into a 300 ml Pyrex crystallisation dish containing 250 ml
FSW. These dishes were covered and incubated at 19°C.
From 24 hours post fertilisation (hpf) onwards larvae
were fed on the red alga Rhinomonas reticulata.
Fixation
Fixation and immunolabelling followed the methods of
Wanninger and colleagues [11]. Larvae were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) at 4°C overnight, washed three times in PBS and
then stored at 4°C. Metatrochophore larvae and juveniles
were relaxed in 7% MgCl2 in FSW prior to fixation.
Immunolabelling
Calcareous tubes of juveniles were dissolved in 0.1 M
EGTA for approximately 15 minutes at room temperature
(RT), which was followed by four washes in PBS. Permeabilisation of tissue was performed in 0.1 M PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBT) for 15 minutes at RT, and was followed
by blocking of non-specific binding sites overnight at 4°C
in PBT with 2% bovine serum albumen (block-PBT). The
following steps were all performed at 4°C. Animals were
incubated in 1:1000 (monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin,
Sigma), 1:40000 (polyclonal serotonin 5-HT antiserum,
Immunostar), or 1:200000 (polyclonal FMRF-Amide
antiserum, Immunostar) dilutions of the primary antibodies in block-PBT for 24h. After four 1h washes in
block-PBT specimens were incubated in 1:800 dilutions of
Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (serotonin and FMRFamide) or Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (tubulin)
(Molecular Probes) in block-PBT for 24h. Specimens were
then washed four times in PBS for over 1h, immersed in
60% glycerol in PBS and mounted in Vectashield with
DAPI (Vector Labs). Negative controls were obtained by
omitting primary antibodies and showed no specific
staining.

For F-actin staining all steps were performed at RT. Specimens were permeabilised in PBT for 1h. A 1:40 dilution of
Oregon Green 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in PBT
was added to animals for 1h and was followed by three 15
minutes washes in PBS. Specimens were then immersed in
60% glycerol in PBS and mounted in Vectashield with
DAPI. Negative controls were obtained by omitting phalloidin and showed no specific staining.
A minimum of 40 individuals of each larval stage (or 20
juveniles) were investigated per staining procedure. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axioskop 2
and images were captured using Axiovision 4. Several representative individuals from each developmental stage
were studied further using confocal microscopy, which
was performed on a Leica DMIRE2 microscope equipped
with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal unit.
Scanning electron microscopy
Embryos/larvae were fixed in a mixture of 75 mM sodium
cacodylate, 3% glutaraldehyde and 1% of calcium chloride for at least 2h. The fixative was replaced by two 5 minutes exchanges of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate and then 1%
osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 1h.
After the specimens were rinsed twice with 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate for 5 minutes, dehydration was performed via
an acetone series (50%, 70% and 90%; two 3 minutes
washes for each concentration) to 100% (2 washes each
10 minutes). Specimens were then rinsed with 1:1 acetone:HMDS (hexamethyldisilizane) for 10 minutes, followed by two 10 minutes washes in 100% HMDS.
Samples were air-dried for at least 2h before they were
sputter-coated with gold.
