Abstract
Background: TRP (Transient Receptor Potential) channels respond to diverse stimuli and thus
function as the primary integrators of varied sensory information. They are also activated by
various compounds and secondary messengers to mediate cell-cell interactions as well as to detect
changes in the local environment. Their physiological roles have been primarily characterized only
in mice and fruit flies, and evolutionary studies are limited. To understand the evolution of insect
TRP channels and the mechanisms of integrating sensory inputs in insects, we have identified and
compared TRP channel genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum, Apis
mellifera, Nasonia vitripennis, and Pediculus humanus genomes as part of genome sequencing efforts.
Results: All the insects examined have 2 TRPV, 1 TRPN, 1 TRPM, 3 TRPC, and 1 TRPML subfamily
members, demonstrating that these channels have the ancient origins in insects. The common
pattern also suggests that the mechanisms for detecting mechanical and visual stimuli and
maintaining lysosomal functions may be evolutionarily well conserved in insects. However, a TRPP
channel, the most ancient TRP channel, is missing in B. mori, A. mellifera, and N. vitripennis. Although
P. humanus and D. melanogaster contain 4 TRPA subfamily members, the other insects have 5 TRPA
subfamily members. T. castaneum, A. mellifera, and N. vitripennis contain TRPA5 channels, which have
been specifically retained or gained in Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. Furthermore, TRPA1, which
functions for thermotaxis in Drosophila, is missing in A. mellifera and N. vitripennis; however, they
have other Hymenoptera-specific TRPA channels (AmHsTRPA and NvHsTRPA). NvHsTRPA
expressed in HEK293 cells is activated by temperature increase, demonstrating that HsTRPAs
function as novel thermal sensors in Hymenoptera.
Conclusion: The total number of insect TRP family members is 13-14, approximately half that of
mammalian TRP family members. As shown for mammalian TRP channels, this may suggest that
single TRP channels are responsible for integrating diverse sensory inputs to maintain the insect
sensory systems. The above results demonstrate that there are both evolutionary conservation and
changes in insect TRP channels. In particular, the evolutionary processes have been accelerated in

the TRPA subfamily, indicating divergence in the mechanisms that insects use to detect
environmental temperatures.

Background
Transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily members
of cation channels share six common transmembrane
domains and permeability to cations. Despite these similarities, TRP channels are highly unusual among the
known families of ion channels in displaying an impressive diversity of cation selectivities and specific activation
mechanisms. TRP channels have crucial functions for various sensory modalities in different metazoans. They are
involved in vision, thermosensation, olfaction, hearing,
and mechanosensation and thus enable animals to perceive the external environment. Moreover, TRP channels
enable individual cells to sense changes in their local environment, for example, osmolarity and fluid flow. Many
TRP channels are activated by a variety of different stimuli
and function as primary signal integrators. TRP channels
are expressed and function in a variety of multicellular
organisms, including nematodes, fruit flies, fish, mice,
and humans. The TRP superfamily is divided into seven
subfamilies, namely, TRPC, TRPA, TRPV, TRPN, TRPM,
TRPP, and TRPML based on their sequence elements and
domains. For example, TRPC, TRPA, TRPV, and TRPN
channels have multiple N-terminal ankyrin repeats [1-3].
Physiological functions of TRP channels have been exclusively characterized in fruit flies and mice to date. Moreover, comparative genomics and evolutionary studies of
TRP channels are also limited. We therefore performed a
comparative genomics study of insect TRP channels as
part of insect genome sequencing efforts. The sensory
modalities of insects are almost comparable to those of
mammals; insects can see, feel touch, hear, smell, taste,
and detect temperature, humidity, wind, gravity, magnetism, and seismogram. It has been shown that some of
these sensory modalities are dependent on TRP channels
in fruit flies [4-10]. Among insect sensory modalities, the
mechanisms of thermosensation could be quite different
from those of mammals because insects are relatively
small, and thus they have a larger ratio of surface area to
volume than mammals. Furthermore, they do not have
systems to keep their body temperature constant. Thus,
their body temperatures are more susceptible to changes
in environmental temperature than mammals. While
mammals sense the temperatures of body surface and
directly touched objects as somatosensory stimuli, insects
are able to sense temperatures from the distance by detecting the temperature gradient of air [11,12]. This might
lead to the different evolution of thermo-sensitive TRP
channel genes in insects and mammals. Thermo-sensitive
TRP channels are the specific TRP channels which are acti-

vated by either temperature increase or decrease [1-3].
Since all thermo-sensitive TRP channels belong to TRPA
subfamily in fruit flies [8-10], the evolution of insect TRPA
subfamily might be very dramatic. Here, we identify and
compare all TRP channel genes in the sequenced insects,
Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera), Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera), Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera), Apis mellifera
(Hymenoptera), Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera), and
Pediculus humanus (Phthiraptera). These insect species represent 4 major orders of holometabolous insects as well as
1 order of hemimetabolous insects. Evolutionary conservation and changes in the insect TRP channels are discussed.

Results and Discussion
Conservation of insect TRPV, TRPN, TRPM, and TRPML
subfamilies
There are 13 identified TRP channel genes in Drosophila
[1]; we used them as queries to identify TRP channel genes
in the P. humanus, B. mori, T. castaneum, A. mellifera, and
N. vitripennis genomes. A summary of the results is shown
in Table 1 and 2. Classification of the TRP channels into
subfamilies is based on the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) constructed from the channel-forming six transmembrane
domain sequences of all TRP channels identified. These
sequences were chosen for the analysis because they are
the only domains shared with all TRP channels, and the
other parts are too divergent. All the insects examined
contain 2 TRPV, 1 TRPN, 1 TRPM, 3 TRPC, and 1 TRPML
channels. Drosophila TRPV channels (Nan and Iav) are
necessary for hearing [6,7,13], and Nan functions as a dry
receptor for hygrosensation [14]. The Drosophila TRPN
channel, NompC, is associated with mechanosensation
[4] as well as hearing [13,15]. Drosophila TRPC channels,
TRP and TRPL, are necessary for phototransduction
[16,17]. TRPML is necessary for lysosomal function and
autophagy in Drosophila [18]. The functions of the TRPM
channel have not been identified in insects. Some of
mammalian TRPM channels are associated with taste [19]
and cold perception [20,21]. These results may suggest
that the mechanisms to detect mechanical and visual
stimuli as well as humidity are evolutionarily well conserved in both holometabolous and hemimetabolous
insects. Daphnia pulex, a crustacean, contains the same
numbers of members of these TRP subfamilies except that
it has 2 TRPM channels (data not shown). These results
thus suggest that 2 TRPV, 1 TRPN, 1 TRPM, 3 TRPC, and 1
TRPML channels were at least present in the last common
ancestor of insects and branchiopods [22-24]. Furthermore, they could be the "core" set of TRP channels present

in arthropods. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains 5 TRPV, 1 TRPN, 4 TRPM, 3 TRPC, and 1 TRPML
channels, more TRPV and TRPM channels than are
present in insects [25]. Similarly, the vertebrates, for
example mouse, have 6 TRPV and 8 TRPM channels. Phylogenetic analysis of C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and
mouse TRPV and TRPM channels demonstrates that C. elegans and mouse independently expanded these subfamily
members during their evolution (Fig. 2). It is therefore
unlikely that insects have lost them from the last common
ancestor of Bilateria (Urbilateria). The origin of the TRPN
channel can be traced back to Urbilateria because it is
present in both Ecdysozoans (insects, water flea, and
nematode) and zebrafish [26], and has been specifically
lost in mammals.

[31]. The lack of TRPP demonstrates that the functions of
TRPP can be compensated by evolving an alternative pathway or other TRP subfamilies in Lepidoptera and
Hymenoptera. Moreover, Fig. 1 shows that the evolutionary rate of TRPP channels in Pediculus, Tribolium, and Drosophila has been accelerated relative to other TRP
subfamily members. Thus, TRPP channels could have different physiological functions in each insect species.
Differences in insect TRPC subfamily members
The Drosophila TRPC subfamily members, DmTRP and
DmTRPL, were the first and founding members of the
whole TRP superfamily. They were originally identified in
association with phototransduction [16,17]. It has been
suggested that the primary channels functioning in phototransduction are DmTRP homomultimers and two
types of heteromultimers--DmTRPL/DmTRP and
DmTRPL/DmTRPgamma--based on the observation that
these channels were activated by stimulation of signaling
pathways coupled to activation of phosphoinositide (PI)dependent phospholipase C (PLC) in vitro [32,33]. Nevertheless, DmTRP homomultimers should be the major
components in vivo because trpl mutant flies show only
subtle defect in the light response [1]. Bombyx, Apis, and
Nasonia contain 3 TRPC subfamily members that cluster
with either DmTRP, DmTRPL, or DmTRPgamma (Fig. 1).
This suggests that TRPC subfamily members of B. mori, A.
mellifera, N. vitripennis, and D. melanogaster share the same
functions in phototransduction. However, Tribolium and
Pediculus appear to lack the DmTRPgamma and DmTRPL
orthologs, respectively. Instead, these insects contain
TcXP970049.1 and PhPHUM009153 that cluster separately from the other TRPC subfamily members (Fig. 1).
This suggests that both heteromultimers corresponding to
DmTRPL/DmTRP and DmTRPL/DmTRPgamma and the
heteromultimer corresponding to DmTRPL/DmTRPgamma may be absent in P. humanus and T. castaneum,
respectively. Thus, TRPC subfamily members may have
been co-opted to play physiological roles other than pho-

The total number of insect TRP family members is 13-14,
approximately half that of mammalian TRP family members. Nevertheless, insects have highly developed sensory
systems almost comparable to mammals, suggesting that
some single TRP channels are responsible for detecting
multiple sensory stimuli in insects as reported for mammalian TRP channels. This is also supported by the facts
that Nan, the Drosophila TRPV channel, is essential for
both hearing [6] and hygrosensation [14], and DmTRP
and DmTRPL, Drosophila TRPC channels, function in
vision [16,17] and possibly thermosensation [27].
TRPP subfamily is missing in Bombyx, Apis, and Nasonia
Interestingly, a TRPP channel is absent in Bombyx, Apis and
Nasonia (Table 1). Because TRPP is present in yeast, it is
thought to be the most ancient TRP subfamily [28]. This
suggests that TRPP was present in Urbilateria, and has
been lost in Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. TRPP channels are present on both motile and primary cilia, and
they may function to sense fluid flow, osmolarity, and
mechanical stretch [2]. The Drosophila TRPP, Pkd2, is
essential for sperm entry in the female storage organs
[29,30], and is also involved in larval feeding behavior

totransduction in P. humanus and T. castaneum. In fact, the
nematode has 3 TRPC channels similar to insects, and one
of them, TRP-3, is expressed in the spermatids and functions for fertilization [34]. To address this question, it will
be useful to examine where the TRPC subfamily members
are expressed in Tribolium and Pediculus.
Dynamic evolution of the insect TRPA subfamily
As shown in Table 2, 5 TRPA subfamily members are
present in Bombyx, Tribolium, Apis, and Nasonia, while 4
members are present in Pediculus and Drosophila. This is in
contrast to mammals which have only 1 TRPA channel.
Interestingly, Daphnia and Caenorhabditis appear to contain only 1 and 2 TRPA channels, respectively. These
results demonstrate that insects specifically expanded the
TRPA subfamily members during their evolution after
diverging from other metazoans.

The phylogeny of insect TRPA channels demonstrates that
all insects examined contain TRPA channels orthologous
to Drosophila Pain, Pyr, and Wtrw. Drosophila Pain and Pyr
function as thermosensors responding to different "hot"
temperatures (The temperature thresholds for activating
Pain and Pyr are 42.6 and 37.5-40°C, respectively)
[8,10,35], and Drosophila Wtrw functions as a moist receptor for hygrosensation [14]. These results suggest that the
mechanisms to detect harmful high temperatures as well
as moisture are conserved among different insect species.
Tribolium, Apis, and Nasonia (data not shown) have an
extra TRPA channel, TRPA5, (Fig. 1). Based on the recent
phylogeny of holometabolous insects [36,37], it is likely
that the ancient TRPA5 was present in the common ancestor of holometabolous insects, and then has been lost in
Lepidoptera and Diptera. To address whether TcTRPA5
and AmTRPA5 have the same origin, we compared the
positions and phases of their introns [38]. We were not
able to analyze NvTRPA5 since there is a sequence gap in

the genomic region. TcTRPA5 and AmTRPA5 contain 6
and 8 introns, respectively; however, 3 introns of
AmTRPA5 are located in the alignment gap sites (Fig. 3).
Among them, one intron in the most conserved ion transport domain-coding region shares the same position and
phase (Fig. 3). Intriguingly, this intron is absent in all
other insect TRP genes at the corresponding sites. This suggests that the ancient TRPA5 was retained only in Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, and then intron gain and loss have
occurred. Nevertheless, the possibility that Coleoptera
and Hymenoptera have independently gained TRPA5
could not be completely ruled out. AmTRPA5 expressed in
HEK293 cells cannot be activated by temperature fluctuations (data not shown); thus, it remains to be determined
how the TRPA5 channel is activated.
Apis and Nasonia lack TRPA1, which functions in thermotactic behaviors of Drosophila larvae and adults [9,39,40]
(Table 2 and Fig. 1). Moreover, DmTRPA1 was shown to
be activated by temperature increase [39,41]. Remarkably,
Apis and Nasonia have HsTRPAs (Hymenoptera specific
TRPA) which cluster with Wtrw members (Fig. 1). We will
show below that HsTRPA functions as a thermosensor to
detect temperature increase. HsTRPA genes have evolved
by duplication of Wtrw genes, since these two genes lie
next to each other in Apis and Nasonia chromosomes (Fig.
4). Interestingly, 2 Bombyx Wtrw genes, encoding
BmWtrw1, which forms a clade with DmWtrw and
TcWtrw, and BmWtrw2, which forms a clade with
PhWtrw, have also evolved by duplication since they are
present in the same genomic scaffold (data not shown).
Because it is unlikely that the duplication of Wtrw has
occurred independently in Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, this event must have occurred in the common ancestor of holometabolous insects, and the duplicated genes
have been lost in Diptera and Coleoptera. Since DmWtrw
was shown to be necessary for detecting moist air [14], it
will be interesting to see how BmWtrw1 and BmWtrw2

channels are activated. AmHsTRPA, NvHsTRPA, AmWtrw,
BmWtrw1, BmWtrw2, TcWtrw, and PhWtrw lack introns,
while NvWtrw and DmWtrw have 2 and 3 introns, respectively. This suggests that the ancient Wtrw gene evolved by
retrotransposition of another TRP channel gene, most
likely Pyr, and then Drosophila and Nasonia have gained
introns in the Wtrw genes. The lack of introns in NvHsTRPA suggests that it also has evolved by retrotransposition of NvWtrw in Nasonia. Apparently, the evolution of
TRPA channels has been most dramatic among TRP subfamilies in insects, suggesting that the mechanisms to
detect environmental temperature vary in different insect
species.
NvHsTRPA is a thermo-sensitive TRP channel
To characterize the properties of the NvHsTRPA channel,
we expressed it in HEK293 cells. Localization of the V5
and His epitope-tagged NvHsTRPA protein showed a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/228

staining pattern at the plasma membrane, demonstrating
that it reaches to the cell surface (Fig. 5A). Nevertheless,
some proteins are present in the cytoplasm as well. The
molecular weight of the tagged protein was approximately
112 kDa, which is slightly larger than expected (105 kDa)
from the amino acid sequence. The protein size was constant in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of Nglycosylation (Fig. 5B), indicating that NvHsTRPA does
not contain N-glycans unlike the vertebrate TRPV1, 4, 5,
and TRPC3 and 6 as reported [42]. The partial denature of
NvHsTRPA (60°C for 5 min) may result in the aberrant
migration through 6% SDS-PAGE gel which makes the
correct estimation of protein size difficult. Nevertheless,
the possibility that NvHsTRPA undergoes the other posttranslational modifications can not be ruled out. Patchclamp experiments with the cells expressing the tagged
NvHsTRPA protein showed that it is activated by temperature increase, and quickly inactivated by constant heat
application (Fig. 5C, left panel). Desensitization of the
channel by repeated heat applications was also observed
(Fig. 5C, left panel). Similar rapid inactivation and desensitization was also observed with DmPain [35]. The current activation was not observed with the mocktransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 5C, right panel), suggesting
that it is specifically mediated by NvHsTRPA. The rapid
inactivation as well as desensitization properties of NvHsTRPA suggest that it is only once activated by rapid temperature increase during a short period (<60 sec). Thus,
NvHsTRPA may allow Nasonia to detect the rapid increase
of environmental temperature. To determine the temperature threshold for NvHsTRPA channel activation, we performed several experiments. As shown in an Additional
file 1, NvHsTRPA appears to be activated as soon as temperature rises regardless of initial temperatures. The channel was activated even by small temperature increase
(Additional file 1 right panel, RT to heat, a red dotted
line), suggesting that it is very sensitive to temperature
changes. We therefore lowered the temperature to ~7°C,
and then applied heat stimulation very slowly (~0.25°C/
sec) to activate the channel. However, the current developed gradually, and was small (< 100 pA, data not
shown), demonstrating that NvHsTRPA activation is
highly dependent on the heating rate. Thus, it is difficult
to define the temperature threshold for this channel activation in HEK293 cells. NvHsTRPA may sense temperature increase without a specific temperature threshold,
which requires further analyses. The current-voltage (I-V)
relationship of NvHsTRPA showed dual rectification with
a slight positive reversal potential (Fig. 5D), suggesting
that it had high permeability to one of the cations (most
likely Ca2+) included in the bath solution. It will be very
interesting to compare these channel properties with
those of TRPA1, which has not been fully characterized in
any insect. We would like to propose that HsTRPA, origi-

thermoresponsive property, and this has resulted in the
loss of TRPA1 in Hymenoptera. If NvHsTRPA complements the functions of TRPA1, it could have roles in thermotactic behavior of Nasonia similar to DmTRPA1 in
Drosophila. Knock-down of NvHsTRPA by RNAi followed
by the analysis of thermotactic behavior will test this possibility.

tute for the lack of TRPA1 in Hymenoptera. However,
TRPA1 activation by temperature fluctuations appears to
be established in both vertebrates and invertebrates.
DmTRPA1 and the vertebrate TRPA1 are activated by temperature increase [39,41] and cooling to 10°C [43],
respectively. Thus, the thermoresponsive property of
NvHsTRPA demonstrates that it is a likely channel to complement the lack of TRPA1 in Nasonia.

DmTRPA1 was shown to be necessary for Drosophila larvae
to discriminate between 18°C and slightly higher temperatures (19-24°C), and function downstream of a phospholipase C-dependent signaling pathway [40]. Under
this behavioral paradigm, DmTRPA1 is not necessary to
be heat-activated, and thus any TRP channel could substi-

Conclusion
TRP channels respond to diverse stimuli, and thus function as the primary integrators of various kinds of sensory
information. To understand the evolution of insect TRP
channels, and thus the mechanisms of integrating sensory
inputs in insects, we have identified and compared TRP

which functions in thermotaxis in Drosophila, is missing in
A. mellifera and N. vitripennis; however, they have other
Hymenoptera-specific TRPA channels which function as
novel thermal sensors. The total number of insect TRP
family members is 13-14, approximately half that of
mammalian TRP family members. As reported for mammalian TRP channels, this may suggest that some single
TRP channels are responsible for integrating multiple sensory inputs to keep the breadth of insect sensory systems
comparable to that of mammals. These results demonstrate that there have been both evolutionary conservation
and changes in insect TRP channels. In particular, the evolutionary processes have been accelerated in the TRPA
subfamily, thus indicating the diversity of mechanisms for
detecting environmental temperatures used by various
insect species.

Methods
Bioinformatics
The amino acid sequences of 13 Drosophila TRP channels
were retrieved from FlyBase http://flybase.org/, and were
used as queries to identify TRP channel genes of Pediculus,
Bombyx, Tribolium, Apis, and Nasonia by TBLASTN search
using the E value 1E-10 against the genomes and gene
model DNA sequences. The genome databases used were

insect TRP channels analyzed in this study is shown in an
Additional file 2. The amino acid sequences of C. elegans
and mouse TRPV and TRPM channels were retrieved from
the NCBI protein database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sites/entrez?db=protein. The six transmembrane ion
transport domains of each TRP channel were identified by
InterProScan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/
search. The amino acid sequences of ion transport
domains were aligned by the Muscle program [44], and
then PhyML3.0 algorithm [45] was applied for the maximum likelihood analyses, under the WAG amino acid
substitution model and with 100 bootstrapped data sets
using the PhyML Online server. A phylogeny created with

The NvHsTRPA expressing cells were treated with (+) or without (-) tunicamycin (Tun). The positions of MW markers are
shown on the left in kDa. (C) Heat elicits inward current activation in a NvHsTRPA-expressing HEK293 cell (NvHsTRPA, left

pipette solution were used. NvHsTRPA is activated by temperature increase, and quickly inactivated by constant heat application. Desensitization of the channel is also observed by repetitive heat applications. The current activation is not observed with
the mock-transfected cells (Mock, right panel). (D) Current--voltage relationship of heat evoked current exhibits dual rectification with a slight positive reversal potential. Heat-dependent shifts of the liquid junction potentials (ΔJPH) were not corrected
in the plot (n = 9). A standard bath solution and Cs-Asp/Ca2+(-) pipette solution were used.

for multiple replacements had an identical topology. The
amino acid sequences of TcTRPA5 and AmTRPA5 were
aligned with the CLUSTALW program [46], and the intron
positions and phases were identified by searching the
above databases.
Characterization of NvHsTRPA channel protein
The full length NvHsTRPA cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR
with adult N. vitripennis head RT and two primers, 5'
TTTTTGCGGCCGCACCATGTCGCGCTCGTGGAAAC TG
GACGAGGTC 3' and 5' TTTCTAGACTCCTCGGTTGCACTCTTCGAGCCACG AGATT 3'. The PCR product
was digested with NotI and XbaI, and then cloned in
pAc5.1/V5-His B vector (Invitrogen) in which the Drosophila actin 5C promoter was replaced with CMV promoter. The cloned cDNA was sequenced; it was identical
to the one deposited in a database. HEK293 cells grown
on cover slips were transfected with 1.2 μg NvHsTRPA
expression vector using Attractene transfection reagent
(Qiagen) for 2 days at 37°C. The cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature
(RT), and then permeabilized with 0.5% TX-100/PBS for
5 min. After washing the cells with PBS containing 0.1%
TX-100 (PT), they were blocked with PT containing 5%
normal donkey serum for 30 min followed by incubation
with rabbit anti-V5 antibody (Sigma, 1000 fold dilution)
for 2 hr at RT. The cells were washed, and then incubated
with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Chemicon, 300 fold dilution) for 2 hr at RT. The cells were
observed with a confocal laser microscope. The cell lysates
prepared from the cells transfected with empty vector
(mock) and NvHsTRPA expression vector were analyzed
by Western blot using rabbit anti-V5 antibody and HRPconjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (GE healthcare, 3000
fold dilution). Tunicamycin was added to the cells at the
concentration of 10 μg/ml for 15 hr where indicated. The
signal was detected by an ECL detection system (GE
healthcare).
Electrophysiology
HEK293 cells in a 35-mm dish were transfected with 1 μg
of NvHsTRPA expression vector and 0.1 μg of pGREEN
LANTAN 1 using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen). After incubating for 3-4 hours, cells were reseeded
on cover glasses and further incubated at 33°C and 5%
CO2. Cells were used for the experiments 20-40 hours
after transfection. The standard bath solution contained
(in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES,
and 10 glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. The CsCl
pipette solution contained (in mM) 140 CsCl, 5 EGTA
and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH. Whole-cell
recording data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5
kHz for analysis (AxoPATCH 200B amplifier with
pCLAMP software, Molecular Devices). Membrane potential was clamped at -60 mV. The current-voltage (I-V) rela-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/228

tionship upon heating was obtained by using voltage
ramps (-100 to +100 mV in 100 ms). Cells were stimulated with temperature changes by decreasing or increasing the bath temperatures with an iced or preheated
perfusate through the lines, respectively (with a minimum
8°C for cooling, and a maximum 44°C for heating). After
whole-cell configuration was achieved, the cell was raised
50 μm and placed in the center of the chamber. Temperature was monitored with a thermocouple (TA-30, Warner
Instruments) placed within 100 μm of the patch-clamped
cell.
