Abstract
Background: High taxonomic level endemism in the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka biodiversity
hotspot has been typically attributed to the subcontinent's geological history of long-term isolation.
Subsequent out of – and into India dispersal of species after accretion to the Eurasian mainland is
therefore often seen as a biogeographic factor that 'diluted' the composition of previously isolated
Indian biota. However, few molecular studies have focussed on into-India dispersal as a possible
source of endemism on the subcontinent. Using c. 6000 base pairs of mitochondrial and nuclear
DNA, we investigated the evolutionary history and biogeography of true toads (Bufonidae), a group
that colonized the Indian Subcontinent after the Indo-Asia collision.
Results: Contrary to previous studies, Old World toads were recovered as a nested clade within
New World Bufonidae, indicating a single colonization event. Species currently classified as Ansonia
and Pedostibes were both recovered as being non-monophyletic, providing evidence for the
independent origin of torrential and arboreal ecomorphs on the Indian subcontinent and in SouthEast Asia. Our analyses also revealed a previously unrecognized adaptive radiation of toads
containing a variety of larval and adult ecomorphs. Molecular dating estimates and biogeographic
analyses indicate that the early diversification of this clade happened in the Western Ghats and Sri
Lanka during the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene.
Conclusion: Paleoclimate reconstructions have shown that the Early Neogene of India was
marked by major environmental changes, with the transition from a zonal- to the current
monsoon-dominated climate. After arrival in the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka hotspot, toads
diversified in situ, with only one lineage able to successfully disperse out of these mountains.
Consequently, higher taxonomic level endemism on the Indian Subcontinent is not only the result
of Cretaceous isolation, but also of invasion, isolation and radiation of new elements after accretion
to the Eurasian mainland.

Background
The Western Ghats of India and highlands of Sri Lanka are a
global biodiversity hotspot, i.e. they contain several endemic
animal and plant species which are recognised as being distinct at a high taxonomic level [1]. Endemism is particularly
marked among amphibians, with over 75% of subcontinent
species restricted to this region alone [2,3]. Explaining biogeographic patterns has mainly focussed on the geological history of the subcontinent, which indicates prolonged periods
of isolation from the Late Cretaceous to the Early Tertiary [49]. Before joining the Eurasian mainland, India was part of
Gondwana (South-America, Africa, Indo-Madagascar, Australia-New Guinea and Antarctica) and gradually became
detached from other landmasses during its northward journey across the Tethys Sea [10-12]. Although the actual isolation of India has been debated (see [13] and references
therein), molecular studies have demonstrated the presence
of ancient lineages in India, and these are interpreted as evidence of this geological history [4-6].
The subsequent accretion of the Indian plate into Eurasia
during the Early Tertiary [13] was a potential catalyst for
biotic exchange between the subcontinent and the Eurasian mainland. It has been shown that an out-of-India dispersal of Gondwanan elements into Eurasia resulted in
the wider distribution of previously isolated groups [5,1417]. However, less attention has been given to the opportunity of "into-India" movement of Laurasian species after
the establishment of this new geological connection. The
exchange of species between the Indian Subcontinent and
Eurasia must have been affected by the geomorphological
changes generated after their collision. The uplift of the
Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau not only created physical barriers for dispersal, but also heavily influenced the
prevalent climate [18,19]. The climatic regime in Asia
changed from a zonal-pattern to a monsoon-dominant
system, a reorganization that had major consequences for
Asian and Indian terrestrial ecosystems [20,21].
True toads (Bufonidae) are a family of anurans with a
wide distribution, comprising over 500 species [22,23].
Their present-day natural absence on several landmasses
of Gondwanan origin (Australia, Madagascar, Seychelles),
their nested position within Nobleobatrachia (Hyloidea
sensu [6]), and their recent origin [24-26], imply that they
reached the Indian subcontinent only after the Indo-Asia
collision. Toads thus constitute an ideal group for studying Tertiary into-India dispersal. Despite numerous studies on phylogenetic relationships in Bufonidae [27-38],
species from the Indian subcontinent were always underrepresented and their phylogenetic relationships remain
largely elusive. In addition to multiple species whose taxonomic affiliations are uncertain (i.e., provisionally
labelled "Bufo" pending more detailed phylogenetic evidence [37]), toads on the Indian subcontinent are classi-

fied in five genera: Bufoides (North-India) and Adenomus
(Sri Lanka) are considered endemic to the subcontinent,
Duttaphrynus has a wide distribution, and torrentially
adapted Ansonia and arboreal Pedostibes species show disjunct distributions in wet-zone areas of South-East Asia
and India [23]. Current taxonomy therefore suggests multiple dispersal events between the Indian subcontinent
and adjacent regions.
Here we analysed a combined set of mitochondrial and
nuclear gene fragments to investigate phylogenetic relationships and biogeography of Indian Bufonidae. Our
sampling includes 15 toads from the subcontinent and a
representative diversity of species of adjacent regions, with
particular attention to shared genera Ansonia, Pedostibes
and Duttaphrynus. We performed dating estimates and
biogeographic analyses to investigate biotic exchange
between the Indian subcontinent and adjacent regions,
and evaluated how this affected endemism in the Western
Ghats-Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic relationships of Bufonidae
Our data matrix consists of 6309 basepairs (bp, 4339 bp
mitochondrial- and 1970 bp nuclear DNA), 5116 bp of
which could be unambiguously aligned. Maximum Parsimony (MP) analyses of the total dataset produced 2
equally parsimonious trees of 15224 steps. Maximum
likelihood (ML) analyses of the total dataset produced a
single ML tree (-lnL = 71238.66624, with gamma shape
parameter = 0.533, and proportion of invariable sites =
0.483), which is very similar to the Bayesian consensus
phylogram (Figure 1). Our analyses confidently determine the phylogenetic position of ten known species currently treated as incertae sedis "Bufo" in Figure 1). In
agreement with previous evidence [31,32], we recover
with high support the Northern African "Bufo" mauritanicus as sister species of a sub-Saharan Amietophrynus clade
(Figure 1). Based on this support, we suggest transferring
the species "Bufo" mauritanicus Schlegel, 1841 to the genus
Amietophrynus. The remaining "Bufo" species in our study
are nested in, or closely related to the genus Duttaphrynus
as originally defined ([37], i.e. in essence the Bufo melanostictus group sensu lato [39,40], Table 1). The Bufo scaber
group [39], here represented by "Bufo" scaber and "Bufo"
atukoralei, is nested in Duttaphrynus. To restore monophyly of Duttaphrynus and to place sampled "Bufo" species
in a taxonomic framework, we suggest expanding Duttaphrynus to include the most recent common ancestor of
Bufo melanostictus (Schneider, 1799) and Bufo stomaticus
Lütken, 1864, and all of its descendants. Eight known species, including those belonging to the Bufo stomaticus
group sensu [39] (here represented by "Bufo" dhufarensis,
"Bufo" hololius and "Bufo" stomaticus), are thus transferred
to this genus (Figure 1, 2).

In contrast to previous studies, we recover with high support the Old World toads as a clade nested among New
World taxa (Figure 1), but the sequence of early diversification of its major lineages remains poorly resolved. Furthermore, our analyses differ from previous hypotheses in
a number of important aspects: First, the African species
Schismaderma carens, in contrast to other studies [2932,37,41], is recovered as sister species of a strongly supported Churamiti-Nectophrynoides clade. However, support for this African clade as a whole remains moderate.
Second, in agreement with a previous study [42], our analyses do not support the monophyly of Pseudepidalea but
find an ambiguous phylogenetic position for Pseudepidalea brongersmai (Figure 1; Table 1, PAU = 0.302, BPP
< 0.001). Third, the genus Pedostibes is not recovered as
being monophyletic (Table 1, PAU < 0.001, BPP <
0.001):P. hosii does not group with the type species P.
tuberculosus, but comes out as the sister species of Phrynoidis juxtaspera (Figure 1). Fourth, species of the genus
Ansonia similarly do not form a clade (Table 1, PAU <

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/131

0.001, BPP < 0.001). Instead, South-East Asian species
group with Pelophryne (Figure 1).
A previously unrecognized adaptive radiation of toads
Our analyses reveal a previously unrecognized adaptive
radiation of toads, containing torrential, (semi-) arboreal,
and drought-adapted ecomorphs in adult and/or larval
forms (Figure 1, grey box). The name Adenominae Cope
1861 is available to denote this clade in a phylogenetic or
Linnaean system [43]. The Malabar Torrent Toad "Ansonia" ornata from the Western Ghats is the sister lineage of
all other genera in this radiation (Figure 1). Courtship,
mating, egg-laying and tadpole development of this species all happens in and around torrential habitats. It also
exhibits morphological characters that reflect its torrential
ecology (i.e. toe webbing, slender body and long legs).
Furthermore tadpoles of this species possess a specialized
suctorial disk, allowing them to cling on rocks in fast flowing water (S.D. Biju, personal observation). Although
both larvae and adults of the disjunctly distributed South-

East Asian Ansonia species look remarkably similar [44],
they form the sister clade of the Asian genus Pelophryne,
species that show terrestrial adaptations (i.e., few large
eggs and non-feeding tadpoles developing in small temporary pools or water-filled leaf axils [44-46]). The creation of a new genus will be necessary to accommodate the
Indian species Ansonia ornata Günther, 1876 (unpublished data).

which (Adenomus kandianus) is considered extinct, inhabit
streams in tropical montane forests or are semi-arboreal
[49]. The radiation also includes a Western Ghats endemic
lineage containing "Bufo" koynayensis, a species formerly
placed in its own species group because its morphology
did not correspond with any other recognized Oriental
group [39]. This species often inhabits rocky mountain
streams and has a bright yellow coloration during the
mating season. Interestingly, it also lays its eggs in
clutches (Varad Giri – personal communication). Because
of these reasons, we suggest transferring "Bufo" koynayensis
and its undescribed sister species to a new genus (unpublished data). Finally, the radiation includes a clade of
pond-breeding species with a warty skin and more "typical" toad morphology. This group contains toads that
were formerly placed in the Bufo melanostictus, Bufo stomaticus, Bufo scaber or Bufo arabicus groups. Together, they
have a broad distribution, covering India, South-East Asia,
the Arabian Peninsula, and possibly Northeast Africa.

Another interesting member of this toad radiation is the
Malabar Tree Toad Pedostibes tuberculosus, a Western Ghats
endemic species that is largely arboreal [47]: During the
night, males attract the females by calling from tree holes
or an elevated position on leaves of vegetation. Furthermore, the fingers and toes of this species are dilated in
broad truncated disks, which is a clear adaptation to their
arboreal lifestyle. Our analyses indicate that Pedostibes
from the Indian Subcontinent and the Malayan Peninsula
independently evolved toe pads and an arboreal ecology
[47,48]. Pedostibes tuberculosus also has a specialized development: it lays about 250 eggs in a clutch (i.e., not in
strings, typical for many bufonid species) at the edge of
streams, in which the bottom-feeding tadpoles further
develop (S.D. Biju – personal observation).

Dating estimates
Our dating estimates are listed in Table 2 and 3. Analyses
using ingroup + outgroup calibrations (analysis A) and
ingroup calibrations alone (analysis B) resulted in highly
similar node ages. Additionally, removal of individual
time constraints resulted in congruent dating estimates
(data not shown). All analyses place the crown origin of
Bufonidae around the Paleocene-Eocene border (analysis

Various ecomorphs are also evident in the genus Adenomus, which are slender toads endemic to the highlands
of Sri Lanka (Figure 1) [49]. The three members, one of

Ancestral areas were reconstructed by both DIVA and MP analyses. Dating estimates of two sets of calibration points are shown (analysis A and B,
see main text). Abbreviations are: S, South-East Asia; W, Western Ghats and Sri Lankan highlands; I, remaining Indian subcontinent; A, Arabian
Peninsula. Nodes are cross-referenced in Figure 2

A: 55.35 ± 8.26 million years ago (Mya); analysis B: 54.49
± 7.30 Mya, Table 2). This divergence time estimate is consistent with previous amphibian studies that cover a variety of methods and taxon sampling [24-26]. Our analyses
further indicate that bufonids reached the Old World
around 28.94 ± 4.43 Mya (Table 2). The origin of specialized endemic lineages ("Ansonia", Pedostibes, the "bufo"
koynayensis clade and Adenomus) on the Indian subcontinent is estimated between 22.42 ± 3.59 and 17.00 ± 2.86
Mya (Figure 2, nodes 3 to 6; Table 3).
Our time estimates for the origin of bufonids differ substantially from a recent study where this event was placed
in the Late Cretaceous (around 83 Mya) [30]. This older
dating estimate can be attributed to the use of the oldest
"leptodactylid" fossil Baurubatrachus pricei† (86 Myr, [50])
to calibrate the crown node of Nobleobatrachia. This is
possibly an overestimation: the identification of Baurubatrachus as a leptodactylid is questionable given the lack of
synapomorphies defining this family [22] and its
polyphyly according to molecular studies ([24] and references therein). For example, Calyptocephalella gayi was
originally assigned to Leptodactylidae, but recent molecular studies have shown a close relationship to Australian
Myobatrachidae. Therefore, calibrating the most recent
common ancestor of all "Leptodactylidae", including
Calyptocephalella gayi and Nobleobatrachia, at 86 Myr
would have been a more conservative approach and
would likely have given results similar to our dating estimates.

Biogeography
Our trees show a deeply nested clade of Old World bufonids, indicating a single dispersal event (Figure 1). This
result is in contrast with a previous hypothesis suggesting
that one toad lineage returned to the New World [30].
Bayesian dating estimates suggest that bufonids reached
the Old World around the Late Oligocene, a period that
has been associated with global climate warming [51]. We
hypothesize that this allowed toads to access northern latitudes and subsequently reach Eurasia. Although transoceanic dispersal cannot be excluded, colonization is
more likely to have occurred over the Trans-Beringian
land bridge, which connected Eurasia and North America
intermittently from the Mid-Cretaceous until the late
Pliocene [52,53]. After arrival in Eurasia, they rapidly
spread southwards, reaching Africa, South-East Asia and
the Indian subcontinent around the Oligocene-Miocene
transition.

The early diversification of toads on the Indian subcontinent led to the origin of specialized endemic lineages
("Ansonia", Pedostibes, the "Bufo" koynayensis group and
Adenomus) in the Early Miocene (Figure 2). Dispersalvicariance (DIVA) analyses (Table 3) indicate that this
radiation occurred on the Southern parts of the subcontinent, as the oldest lineages are currently restricted to the
Western Ghats and Sri Lankan highlands. The timing of
this radiation corresponds with a period that is marked by
global climatic- and environmental changes [18,54].
These were probably caused by the combined effect of

Tibetan uplift and retreat of the Paratethys epicontinental
sea, both of which were initiated by the Indo-Asia collision [20]. On the Indian subcontinent, the transition
from a zonal to a monsoon-dominated climate pattern
may have led to the aridification of the remaining peninsula, and a significant shift from closed forested tropical
ecosystems towards more open savannah-like ecosystems
[18,20,21,55-58]. If correct, specialized frogs distributed
in the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot
would have become isolated from similar mountainous
rainforest habitats. This would also explain why other
rainforest clades radiated and largely remained in the
highlands of Sri Lanka, even when sea-level variations frequently permitted dispersal to the mainland [59].
Our ancestral area reconstruction and dating estimates
(Figure 2) indicate that around the Middle Miocene, toads
successfully dispersed out of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka
hotspot and colonized other parts of the subcontinent,
South-East Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula. It is possible
that dispersal of these toads was more frequent, but more
extensive taxon sampling is required to address this question.

Conclusion
Our results show that the Late Oligocene-Middle Miocene
interval was an important period for the diversification of
specialized endemic lineages on the Indian subcontinent.
It is likely that this period was not only essential for bufonid diversification, but also led to isolation of newly
arrived lineages in other taxa of Laurasian origin. If confirmed, the Indian subcontinent's higher taxonomic endemism not only originated from Cretaceous isolation, but
also from into India dispersal and subsequent radiation of
new elements after accretion to the Eurasian mainland.

Methods
Taxon sampling and DNA protocols
This study includes 86 bufonid frog taxa representing the
major lineages within the family, and a particularly comprehensive Indian sampling; 21 species served as outgroup taxa for dating estimates and 7 of these served as
outgroup for phylogenetic analyes (see Additional file 1).
DNA was extracted from muscle or liver tissue using a
standard extraction protocol modified from Sambrook et
al. [60]. Our total data matrix encompasses fragments of
2 nuclear genes (NCX1 and CXCR4) and 9 mitochondrial
genes (12SrRNA, tRNAVAL, 16SrRNA, tRNALEU, ND1,
tRNAILE, tRNAGLN, tRNAMET, ND2). Primers used in this
study are published elsewhere [6,61-64]. PCR-products
were purified following an agarose gel extraction protocol
(Qiagen), cycle sequenced on both strands and analysed
using a GeneScan 3100 automated sequencer. For 18 taxa,
sequences were solely obtained from GenBank: ~2000 bp
of mitochondrial (12SrRNA and 16SrRNA) and ~700 bp

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/131

of nuclear DNA (CXCR4) for 13 taxa, and ~2000 bp of
mitochondrial DNA (12SrRNA and 16SrRNA) for another
5 taxa (see Additional file 1, indicated with gb).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were aligned using ClustalX 1.64 [65]. Ambiguous sections were identified by eye for non-coding DNA
and by comparison with amino acid sequences for coding
DNA using MacClade v4.0 [66]. Sequences were deposited in GenBank, accession numbers are listed in Additional file 1. Phylogeny estimations were obtained under
the maximum parsimony- and maximum likelihood criteria, and in a Bayesian framework. Heuristic MP searches
were performed using PAUP* [67] and executed in 10000
replicates with all characters unordered and equally
weighted, and using tree bisection reconnection branch
swapping. ML searches were performed under the General
Time Reversal (GTR) model, with substitution rates,
gamma-shape parameter and proportion of invariable
sites estimated from neighbour joining trees. These
parameters were re-estimated from the best ML tree found
so far, and this procedure was repeated several times. ML
clade stability was estimated by non-parametric bootstrapping in 1000 replicates with PHYML 2.1b1 [68] using
a GTR+G+I model of sequence evolution. Bayesian analyses were performed with MrBayes 3.1.2 [69], using a
mixed model with four partitions: protein-coding
mtDNA, RNA-coding mtDNA and the two nuclear gene
fragments. Two runs of four Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) chains each were executed in parallel for 10 million generations, with a sampling interval of 500 generations and a burn-in corresponding to the first five million
generations. Convergence of the parallel runs was confirmed by split frequency standard deviations (<0.01),
and by potential scale reduction factors (~1.0) for all
model parameters using the software Tracer v1.3 [70].
Posterior probabilities for clades were obtained by combining the post-burn-in trees from parallel runs in a single
consensus tree.
Evaluation of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses
Alternative phylogenetic hypotheses represented by candidate trees estimated under ML using constraints in
PAUP*, were compared using the approximately unbiased (AU) test [71]. Site-wise log-likelihoods for all trees
were estimated using PAUP* and used as input for CONSEL 0.1 g [72]. Bayesian posterior probabilities for alternative phylogenetic hypotheses were estimated by screening
the post-burn-in trees sampled by MrBayes using topological constraint filters in PAUP*.
Divergence time estimates
We estimated nodal ages and 95% credibility intervals
from our total DNA sequence data using MultiDivtime
[73]. One single MCMC chain was run for 1.1 million

generations, with a sampling frequency of one per 100
generations and a burn-in corresponding to the first
100,000 generations, assuming a F84+G model and an
auto-correlated rate change. We calibrated our Bayesian
consensus phylogram using five ingroup and two outgroup calibration points. Constrained nodes in the
ingroup are: (A) A minimum age of 20 million years
(Myr) for the split between North- and Central America
based on the fossil Bufo praevis [74]. (B) A minimum age
of 18 Mya for the stem origin of toads belonging to the
Bufo viridis group based on several fossils belonging to this
group: the Lower Miocene of Southeastern France, Greece
[75], Northern Turkey [76] and Southern Germany [77].
(C) A minimum age of 11 Myr for the origin of Rhinella
marina based on a fossil of this species from the Middle
Miocene [78]. (D) A minimum age of 9.6 Myr for the origin of toads belonging to the Bufo bufo group based on the
appearance of a Bufo bufo fossil from the Miocene of
Europe (Czech Republic) [75]. The combined information of morphological species groups and high geographic
structure in the phylogeny allowed using these fossils as
conservative minimum age constraints.
Constrained nodes in the outgroup are: (E) A minimum
age of 15 Myr for the stem origin of the subgenus Eleutherodactylus based on a fossil from northern Hispaniola
[79,80]. (F) A minimum age of 35 Myr for the split
between Phyllomedusidae – Pelodryadidae [81] corresponding to the last contact between the Australo-Papuan
realm and the Neotropics [82].
We performed two analyses using different sets of calibration points as follows: (1) using all calibration points,
referred to as analysis A and (2) using calibration points
A-D, referred to as analysis B. For analyses A, the priors for
the mean and standard deviation of the ingroup root age
were set to 64.85 Myr and 12.25 Myr, respectively; for
analyses B, the priors for the mean and standard deviation
of the ingroup root age were set to 47.3 Myr and 9.8 Myr,
respectively [24]. These ages define a fairly broad prior
distribution for the origin op Nobleobatrachia and Bufonidae and cover the results of previous large-scale phylogenetic studies [24-26]. All estimates were done using the
bayesian consensus phylogram; for analyses A, outgroup
relationships were resolved according to previous phylogenetic evidence [24].
Ancestral area reconstruction
Ancestral distributions were estimated on the Bayesian
consensus phylogram under Maximum Parsimony using
MacClade v4.0 [66] and under a dispersal-vicariance event
based method implemented in DIVA 1.1 [83]. Both methods do not require a hypothesis of area relationships, but
DIVA implements an explicit cost for extinction and dispersal events [83], for which default settings were used.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/131

We used four areas, corresponding to relevant biogeographic units: (1) South-East Asia (2) Western Ghats and
Sri Lankan highlands, (3) remaining Indian subcontinent,
(4) Arabian Peninsula. Taxa were coded based on their
sampling locality, i.e. not on their presumed distribution.
Although some species in Duttaphrynus (for example Duttaphrynus melanostictus here sampled in the Western
Ghats) are not restricted to the coded area, this does not
affect the general outcome of Early Miocene diversification of endemic genera in the Western Ghats – Sri Lanka
biodiversity hotspot.
