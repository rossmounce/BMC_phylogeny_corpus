Abstract
Background: Members of the makorin (mkrn) gene family encode RING/C3H zinc finger proteins with U3 ubiquitin
ligase activity. Although these proteins have been described in a variety of eukaryotes such as plants, fungi,
invertebrates and vertebrates including human, almost nothing is known about their structural and functional
evolution.
Results: Via partial sequencing of a testis cDNA library from the poeciliid fish Xiphophorus maculatus, we have
identified a new member of the makorin gene family, that we called mkrn4. In addition to the already described
mkrn1 and mkrn2, mkrn4 is the third example of a makorin gene present in both tetrapods and ray-finned fish.
However, this gene was not detected in mouse and rat, suggesting its loss in the lineage leading to rodent
murids. Mkrn2 and mkrn4 are located in large ancient duplicated regions in tetrapod and fish genomes, suggesting
the possible involvement of ancestral vertebrate-specific genome duplication in the formation of these genes.
Intriguingly, many mkrn1 and mkrn2 intronless retrocopies have been detected in mammals but not in other
vertebrates, most of them corresponding to pseudogenes. The nature and number of zinc fingers were found to
be conserved in Mkrn1 and Mkrn2 but much more variable in Mkrn4, with lineage-specific differences. RT-qPCR
analysis demonstrated a highly gonad-biased expression pattern for makorin genes in medaka and zebrafish (rayfinned fishes) and amphibians, but a strong relaxation of this specificity in birds and mammals. All three mkrn
genes were maternally expressed before zygotic genome activation in both medaka and zebrafish early embryos.
Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that the makorin gene family has evolved through large-scale duplication
and subsequent lineage-specific retroposition-mediated duplications in vertebrates. From the three major
vertebrate mkrn genes, mkrn4 shows the highest evolutionary dynamics, with lineage-specific loss of zinc fingers
and even complete gene elimination from certain groups of vertebrates. Comparative expression analysis strongly
suggests that the ancestral E3 ubiquitin ligase function of the single copy mkrn gene before duplication in
vertebrates was gonad-specific, with maternal expression in early embryos.

Background
Despite their presence in organisms as diverse as fungi,
plants and animals, the functions and evolution of
Makorin (Mkrn) proteins in eukaryotes remain poorly
understood. Makorins are zinc finger proteins with a
typical C3HC4 motif called the RING domain. This protein-protein interaction motif is found in most E3 ubiquitin ligases, a category of enzymes mediating the
transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme to target protein substrates. The RING domain
is responsible for the ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to
mono-ubiquitination and/or to synthesis of poly-ubiquitin chains on lysine residues (for review [1]). Accordingly, some Makorin proteins work as E3 ubiquitin
ligases [2]. In Makorin proteins, the RING domain is
associated with typical arrays of one to four C3H
domains, a type of zinc finger found in a variety of ribonucleoproteins [3]. Another motif rich in Cys and His
residues, with so far unknown function, is also generally
present in Mkrn proteins [4](Figure 1).
Three functional mkrn genes, mkrn1, 2 and 3, have
been described so far in vertebrates, with mkrn3 being
specific to therian mammals. Makorin1 has been well

studied in mammals. Its described functions are linked
to E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, for example ubiquitination-mediated degradation of capsid proteins as a
defence mechanism against virus infection [5]. Mkrn1 is
also involved in the control of cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis through ubiquitination and proteasomedependent degradation of proteins p53 and p21 [6].
Mkrn1 targets human telomerase catalytic subunit
(hTERT) for proteasome processing during differentiation or cell cycle arrest [7]. Makorin1 might also have
transcriptional activity and regulates RNA polymerase
II-dependent transcription independently from E3 ligase
activity, with either negative or positive effects on gene
expression [8]. Changes in mkrn1 expression have been
associated with different types of cancer and other diseases, as observed for other RING proteins with E3
ligase activity [9-12].
A close relative to mkrn1 is mkrn3 (aka Znf127 in
human and mouse), which has been detected only in
therian mammals. Mkrn3 has been first identified in the
Prader-Willi syndrome critical region on 15q11.2 in
the human genome [13,14], but with no obvious role in
the disease [15]. No function has been assigned so far to

Mkrn3. Mkrn3 in fact corresponds to an intronless retrocopy of mkrn1 generated through reverse transcription of
an mkrn1 mRNA molecule. The formation of such retrogenes is catalyzed by the reverse transcriptase encoded
by autonomous retrotransposable elements. Several other
retrocopies of mkrn1 have been identified in mammalian
genomes, most of them probably corresponding to pseudogenes. The possible involvement of such pseudogenes
in the regulation of the founding source gene mkrn1 has
been proposed and debated [8,13,14,16].
The third functional member of the makorin family
described in vertebrates is mkrn2. This gene partially
overlaps with the raf1 proto-oncogene in antisense transcriptional orientation [17]. Functional data have been
only published for the clawed frog Xenopus laevis, where
Mkrn2 is a neurogenesis inhibitor acting upstream of
glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. The third C3H zinc
finger, the Cys-His motif as well as the RING zinc finger
are necessary for this anti-neurogenic activity [18,19].
During the screening of a testis cDNA library from
the platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus (poeciliid), we have
identified a gene with gonad-specific expression representing a new divergent member of the makorin gene
family in vertebrates, which was named mkrn4. Comparative analyses in different species revealed the evolutionary dynamics of this family of RING finger proteins,
suggesting an ancestral gonad-specific function and
maternal embryonic expression before duplication in
vertebrates.

Results and discussion
Mkrn4 is a new member of the vertebrate makorin gene
family

In order to identify new potential gonad-specific transcription factors or regulatory proteins expressed in fish
gonads, we randomly sequenced clones from a testis
cDNA library of the platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus.
In silico screening for sequences containing zinc finger
domains revealed a clone with similarity to uncharacterized members of the makorin gene family [20] (Genbank
accession number HQ377193). Since three functional
mkrn genes have been described so far in vertebrates,
the newly identified gene was called makorin4 (mkrn4).
We could identify sequences orthologous to platyfish
mkrn4 in other fish species (Figures 1 and 2). All fully
sequenced fish genomes including zebrafish (Danio
rerio), medaka (Oryzias latipes [21], green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis),[22], fugu (Takifugu
rubripes) [23] and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus
aculeatus) contained mkrn4 as a single copy gene. Mkrn4
ESTs were also identified in databases for other fish species without available genome draft. Mkrn4 is present in
birds (on Gga26 in chicken) and amphibians as well as in

most mammals, including human (Hsa6q14.1, where it
was annotated as a pseudogene, see below). Mkrn4
sequences form a clear monophyletic group within the
Makorin molecular phylogeny (Figure 2).
Surprisingly, analysis of genome sequence drafts and
EST data failed to detect mkrn4 in two murid rodents,
the mouse Mus musculus and rat Rattus norvegicus, even
after targeted scrutiny of chromosomal segments syntenic to mkrn4-containing loci from other species (on
Mmu17 in mouse and Rno20 in rat). Partial mkrn4
sequences were found in other rodents such as Ord’s
kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii), thirteen-lined ground
squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) and Guinea pig
(Cavia porcellus; for this species a deduced sequence
could be included into the Mkrn phylogeny), as well as in
the American pika Ochotona princeps (lagomorph). No
mkrn4-related sequences were identified in the genome
draft of another lagomorph, the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, and in the northern tree shrew Tupaia belangeri

Böhne et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:721

(order Scandentia). For all these species, no mkrn4 EST
sequence was present in databases. Hence, these results
suggest that the mkrn4 gene has been lost in murid
rodents (mouse and rat). In some other rodent or lagomorph species, mkrn4 may be also on the way of degradation (as suggested by long branch for Guinea pig
sequence; Figure 2) or even might have been already
eliminated, but genomic sequences of better quality will
be required to confirm this hypothesis.
We noticed that mkrn4 was annotated as a pseudogene
in the current Ensembl human genome release, under the
name of Mkrnp2 [24]. Very similar orthologous sequences
were identified in syntenic regions of the genome of chimpanzee (chr. 6, 99% nucleotide identity with the human
sequence in the coding region), orangutan (chr. 6, 99%
nucleotide identity) and macaque (chr. 4, 96% nucleotide
identity), a degree of conservation surprising for a pseudogene evolving under neutral selection. Only gorilla did not
show any mkrn4 sequence, despite the presence of a large
syntenic region on chromosome 6 including several genes
surrounding mkrn4 in other primates. However, the draft
sequence of this region contains many gaps, especially at
the position where mkrn4/mkrnp2 would be expected.
Hence, mkrn4 might be absent from draft but present in
the genome of the gorilla.
In human, mkrnp2 was annotated as pseudogene due
to a premature stop codon at position 53 in the
Ensembl transcript. We suggest that the translation
start codon was wrongly annotated in the Ensembl
prediction. A start codon in frame +3, using the ATG
at position 54 of the predicted transcript, leads to a
full length protein without any further interruption of
the open reading frame. This ATG is conserved
between primate sequences and annotated as the bona
fide start codon in GenBank entry EAX03829.1 used in
sequence alignments and molecular phylogenies (Figures 1 and 2). Primate sequences were reannotated
accordingly (Figure 1).
Using primate sequences as query against EST databases in BLAST analysis, no evidence of transcription
could be found. We then compared the rate of nonsynonymous (Ka) to the rate of synonymous substitutions
(Ks) between mkrn sequences in primates (human, chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque) and other vertebrates.
The average Ka/Ks value obtained between primate
mkrn4 sequences was 0.12, indicating an excess of synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitutions. This value was
similar to those obtained between primate mkrn1 (0.16)
and mkrn2 (0.11). The average Ka/Ks ratio for mkrn4
between fish sequences (medaka, platyfish and guppy)
was 0.27. Taken together, these observations suggest that
mkrn4 evolved under purifying selection in primates and
fish, as observed for other makorin genes. Mkrn4 might
be a functional protein-coding gene in primates but

Page 4 of 13

expressed at a very low level, in a particular type of cells
or under very specific conditions. Alternatively, mkrn4
might have lost its expression potential after initial functionality in different primate species.
No mkrn4 sequence was found in the genome of more
divergent species, including the elephant shark Callorhinchus milii (Chondrichthyes aka cartilaginous fish, a
divergent jawed vertebrate) [25] and the invertebrate
chordates Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus) and
Ciona intestinalis/savignyi (sea squirts).
Large-scale duplication and the evolution of the makorin
gene family

Mkrn1, mkrn2 and mkrn4 are all present in both rayfinned fish and tetrapod lineages, indicating that these
genes have been formed through gene duplications at
least 450 million years ago early in the vertebrate lineage. Mkrn1 and mkrn2 but not mkrn4 were detected in
the genome of elephant shark Callorhinchus milii, a cartilaginous fish. In contrast, we could identify only one
makorin gene in amphioxus and sea squirts (non-vertebrate chordates), as well as in other more divergent
non-vertebrate species including yeast and rice. In the
fly Drosophila melanogaster, four makorin genes were
identified, but three of them clearly corresponded to retrocopies of the only bona fide intron-containing mkrn
gene. Hence, the mkrn gene family observed in vertebrates is probably the result of two events of gene duplication having taken place between the emergence of
vertebrates and the divergence between tetrapods and
ray-finned fish. At least the duplication having led to
mkrn1 and mkrn2 occurred before the split between cartilaginous and bony fish.
In order to know if gene duplications at the origin of
the mkrn family might be linked to rounds of whole
genome duplications having occurred at the basis of the
vertebrate lineage [26-29], we tested if mkrn genes
might be included in large ancient duplicated regions
called paralogons having resulted from such events.
On human chromosome 3, mkrn2 and the raf1 protooncogene partially overlap in antisense transcriptional
orientation. This syntenic relationship is conserved in
most vertebrates but not in teleost fish, with the exception of the zebrafish, where mkrn2 and raf1 are closely
linked on chromosome 11 (Figure 3). Strikingly, in
medaka raf1 is located close to mkrn4 but not mkrn2.
We further analyzed syntenic relationships between
genomic regions containing mkrn2 and mkrn4 in
human, chicken, medaka and zebrafish genomes (Figure
3). We could identify a set of genes with duplicated
copies linked to mkrn2 and mkrn4 in at least one species (for example ppard/pparg in human, chicken and
medaka). Other genes like raf1 or cnpb showed only
one copy but either linked to mkrn2 in some species or

to mkrn4 in others, suggesting differential loss of paralogous copies after duplication.
These results indicate that mkrn2 and mkrn4 are parts
of ancient large duplicated regions present in distant
vertebrate species. Hence, these paralogons might have
been generated by one of the whole genome duplications having occurred in the ancestral vertebrate lineage,
the so called 1R and 2R duplications [26-29]. Both
mkrn2 and mkrn4 are called ohnologs (paralogous
sequences resulting from whole genome duplications).
On the other hand, we can not exclude the occurrence
of a very large segmental gene duplication having generated these duplicated blocks.
The region containing mkrn1 shows little conservation
between mammals and fish (data not shown). We could
not find any evidence for synteny between the mkrn1containing region and other mkrn regions. It has been
previously proposed that mkrn1 and mkrn2 are indeed
the result of a single gene duplication event [17].
Retroposition and the evolution of the makorin gene
family

In addition to mkrn1, mkrn2 and mkrn4, multiple other
mkrn-like sequences are present in mammalian genomes. Some of these sequences correspond to intronless
retrocopies of mkrn1. Their functional status concerning
expression, regulation and mutual interference has been
the source of controversial debate [16,30].
In order to identify all vertebrate mkrn-related sequences,
we searched over the Ensembl Genome Browser the current genome releases of representatives of all vertebrate
groups including all mammalian genomes [24]. The great
majority of identified sequences corresponded to retrogenes of mkrn1 (Table 1), with the characteristic absence
of introns due to reverse transcription of the mature
mRNA molecule [31]. Besides mkrn3, which probably corresponds to an expressed functional retrogene present in
human and mouse, as many as ten different retrogenes
located on eight different chromosomes were identified in
the human genome. Most of them presented inactivating
mutations or severely truncated open reading frames.
Almost no EST corresponding to these retrogenes was
detected in databases. Hence, most of these mkrn1 retrocopies probably correspond to pseudogenes. Six mkrn1 retropseudogenes located on five different chromosomes were
identified in the mouse.
We detected makorin3 and other retrocopies of
makorin1 only in mammals and not in chicken, frog
and all five fish genomes analyzed. An mkrn3 sequence
was detected in opossum, suggesting an event of retroposition that took place before the split of marsupials
from therian mammals. No mkrn3 was found in the current genome draft of the platypus.

Page 6 of 13

Retrocopies of mkrn2 were found in the mouse but
neither in the human nor in non-mammalian vertebrate
genomes (Table 1). These three retropseudogenic copies
of mkrn2 are located on three different chromosomes in
M. musculus. No retrocopy of mkrn4 was found in all
vertebrate genomes analysed, but three potentially functional retrocopies of the single intron-containing mkrn
gene were identified in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Taken together, these observations demonstrate
an intriguing tendency of the mkrn gene family to generate duplicated copies by retroposition.
Structural evolutionary dynamics in the Makorin family

The evolution of the nature and number of zinc fingers
in the Makorin protein family was investigated (Figure 4).
In most plants and invertebrate species (but not in Drosophila), the single Makorin protein contains the RING
domain flanked by three C3H zinc fingers on its N-terminal side and one C3H zinc finger on its C-terminal side.
An additional motif rich in cysteine and histidine residues (the CysHis motif) is located between the third C3H
zinc finger and the RING domain (Figures 1 and 4). This
structure, likely to be ancestral in vertebrates, is also
found in most, if not all Mkrn1 and Mkrn2 proteins.
In contrast, this otherwise well conserved structure was
not found in Mkrn4 proteins (Figures 1 and 4). While the
RING domain and the C-terminal C3H zinc finger are
found in all Mkrn4 sequences, the third C3H zinc finger
and the CysHis motif are missing and have been probably
lost in the ancestral mkrn4 gene early after duplication.
Only fish and Xenopus have kept the first two C3H
complete domains, which are both absent from mammalian sequences. In birds, a remnant of one of these
domains has been retained in chicken and zebra finch
under the form of a C2H domain, the second C3H
domain having been maintained only in zebra finch but
not in chicken.
These results indicate that the evolution of the Mkrn4
protein is associated with the dynamic loss of zinc finger
domains otherwise conserved in Mkrn proteins. This is
consistent with a to some extent faster evolution also
reflected by the longer branches in the Makorin-like
group in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). Another
example of zinc finger domain loss is visible in mkrn3:
this mkrn1-derived retrogene encodes a protein having
lost the second C3H zinc finger (Figures 1 and 3) in
human and mouse.
In the much conserved Mkrn1 and Mkrn2 groups, the
platypus sequences present a reduced number of zinc
fingers, like the opossum Mkrn2 sequence. This might
reflect a biological reality, but might also be an artifact
of local poor sequence assembly quality of the genome
drafts for these species.

Evolution of makorin expression in vertebrates

We compared the expression of the different vertebrate
makorin genes in different species representative of the
fish (medaka and zebrafish), amphibian (the African
clawed frog Xenopus laevis) and bird (chicken) lineages
(published and EST data are generally available for
mammals) (Figures 5 and 6). This might allow to assess
the functional evolution of mkrn genes in vertebrates
and to estimate the ancestral expression pattern and
function in the primitive vertebrate before gene
duplication.
In adult tissue, the whole mkrn gene family showed a
clear gonad-biased expression in fish and frog, with particular high expression in ovary (Figure 5). Accordingly,
mkrn1 is upregulated during ovarian maturation in flatfish, with strong expression in previtellogenic ovarian
follicles [32]. Such a specificity of expression was not
observed in birds and mammals, even if mkrn1 has been
reported to be strongly expressed in mouse adult testis
[4] and mkrn4 showed a slightly testis-biased expression
in chicken.
Taken together, these results suggested that the ancestral mkrn gene was preferentially expressed in the

gonads in a primitive vertebrate, with conservation of
expression pattern after duplication in fish and amphibians but partial relaxation of this specificity and possible extension of functions in birds and mammals.
Mkrn expression during early embryonic stages in fish
largely reflected maternally stored mRNA expressed
during oogenesis [33,34], since mRNA levels were very
high at very early stages (Figure 6). RNA levels then
decreased throughout development, probably due to
dilution effect through continuous cell division, and
reached a very low level shortly after midblastula transition (MBT), the state of zygotic transcription activation.
MBT takes place around stage 11 in medaka [35] and
starts at cycle 10 corresponding to 512 cell stage in zebrafish [36] (between 128 cell stage and dome in our
experiments). Maternal expression was observed for all
three mkrn genes in both medaka and zebrafish, suggesting here again an ancestral expression pattern. As
observed in adults, no tissue-specific expression was
observed in chicken embryos one day before hatching
(Figure 6).

Conclusion
Through the identification of mkrn4, a new member of
the makorin gene family present in tetrapods and rayfinned fishes, we were able to gain some insights into
the structural and functional evolution of this E3 ubiquitin ligase gene family. We could show that different evolutionary dynamics affect different mkrn genes in
vertebrates. While mkrn1 and mkrn2 were detected in
all bony vertebrates studied, mkrn4 was found to be
absent from rat and mouse, two rodent murids, as well
as from rabbit, a lagomorph. In addition, both Mkrn1
and Mkrn2 proteins have retained the ancestral arrangement of zinc fingers, with four C3H motifs surrounding
the RING domain responsible for the ubiquitin ligase
activity. In contrast, Mkrn4 has lost several motifs early
after its formation through duplication, and subsequent
lineage-specific zinc finger loss was observed. Taken
together, these observations suggest that Mkrn4 is subject to more relaxed evolutionary constraints than
Mkrn1 and Mkrn2, with possible development of new
general and lineage-specific functions. However, all
Mkrn proteins contain the RING domain with adjacent
C-terminal C3H zinc finger, indicating that E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity and interactions with nucleic acids might
be properties common to all Makorin proteins. It
appears therefore possible that Mkrn4 function, if still
required in rat and mouse, might be performed by
Mkrn1 or Mkrn2.
Through comparative genomics, we could find evidence that mkrn2 and mkrn4 have been duplicated
together with other genes through a large-scale duplication. These genes are embedded in paralogons, i.e. in

Figure 5 RT-qPCR expression analysis of makorin genes in vertebrate adult tissues. Q-PCR values for each gene were normalized to
expression levels of rpl7 using the 2-DDCT method [71]. Expression in eye (fish) or heart (chicken and frog) was set as a reference (value: 1);

large syntenic chromosomal blocks of duplicated genes
within a same genome. These paralogons were found in
both tetrapods and ray-finned fish, tracing back their
origin to at least 450 million years ago. We propose that
mkrn2 and mkrn4 duplication was the result of either
1R or 2R, the two events of genome duplication having
taken place at the basis of the vertebrate lineage
[12,26-28]. Both 1R and 2R arose before the split
between cartilaginous and bony fish; one might therefore expect the presence of both mkrn2 and mkrn4 in
the genome of elephant shark. However, only mkrn2
was detected. This might be explained by secondary loss
of mkrn4 or incomplete coverage of the elephant shark
genome. The molecular mechanism of formation of
mkrn1 remains elusive. Involvement of 1R or 2R appears
possible (but we could not find any evidence for that) or
of a more local event of segmental duplication. Conservation of intron position between mkrn1, mkrn2 and
mkrn4 (data not shown) suggests that retroposition was
not involved.

After formation of mkrn1, mkrn2 and mkrn4, the
makorin gene family was shaped by lineage-specific retroposition-mediated duplications in vertebrates. Such retrogenes are formed by reverse transcription of generally
mature mRNA molecules followed by integration of the
formed cDNA into a new location of the genome. In
mammals, retrogene formation is catalyzed by reverse
transcriptase encoded by LINE-1 retrotransposons [37].
Retrogenes were detected for mkrn1 and mkrn2 in mammals but not in other vertebrates, and not for mkrn4.
Most of the retrogenes are pseudogenes, but at least one
of them, mkrn3, is functional and conserved in therian
mammals. Hence, retroposition is an evolutionary
mechanism of duplication and functional diversification
in the mkrn family. There is at the moment no satisfying
explanation for the strong tendency of the mkrn family to
generate retrogenes. Germ cell expression, necessary for
retrogene formation and transmission to the next generation, might predispose mkrn genes to duplication
through retroposition. Goncalves et al. [38] have

Figure 6 RT-qPCR expression analysis of makorin genes in vertebrate embryos and embryonic tissues. Q-PCR values for each gene were
normalized to expression levels of rpl7 using the 2-DDCT method [71]. Expression in adult eye (fish) (Fig. 5) or heart (chicken) was set as a
reference (value: 1). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of two independent quantitative real-time PCR experiments (average of
two independent reverse transcription reactions, each tested with two PCR reactions). Black bars represent male tissues and organs, white bars
female tissues and organs. For grey bars, the sex of the donor(s) is undetermined (embryos prior to sexual differentiation) or both sexes have

proposed that the gene expression level in the germ line
is correlated with the number of retropseudogenes, since
abundant mRNAs are more likely to be taken as a substrate by reverse-transcriptases. However, high mkrn
expression is not the only explanation, since no retrocopy
was detected for mkrn genes in amphibians and fish, in
which they show a strong gonadal expression. Other factors might be involved, for example the affinity of
expressed reverse transcriptases for mRNA molecules.
Finally, comparative expression analysis showed a
strongly gonad-biased expression pattern for mkrn1,
mkrn2 and mkrn4 in medaka and zebrafish (ray-finned
fishes) and amphibians, with particularly strong expression
in ovary. Even if some mkrn genes showed also preferential gonadal expression in chicken and mouse, expression
was much less specific in birds and mammals. Maternal
RNA was detected for all three genes in early medaka and
zebrafish embryos. Taken together, these results suggest
that the ancestral single-copy mkrn gene was gonad-specific in primitive vertebrates, with a possible role in sexual
development or gonad functions. This ancestral gene was
also possibly maternally expressed and therefore

potentially involved in fundamental processes such as fertilization, cell division or germ cell development [34].
Nothing is known concerning the functions of Mkrn
proteins in fish and amphibian gonads and embryos, with
the exception of a described role for Mkrn2 as a negative
regulator of neurogenesis in Xenopus [18]. At the moment
it is therefore difficult to propose a function for the ancestral vertebrate Mkrn protein, but results obtained for
Mkrn1 suggest a link with the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis [4,6]. An involvement of the ubiquitin
pathway in testis and spermatogenesis has been proposed
for different organisms and testis-specific transcripts of
different ubiquitin-interacting factors have been reported
(for example [39-43]). Some data indicated an involvement
of the ubiquitin pathway in the maintenance and development of ovarian germ cells in the fly [44] and the zebrafish
[45] and during maturation of the ovary in mouse [46].
Several examples of maternally-expressed RING finger
proteins with essential functions during development have
been reported [47-51]. Multispecies comparative functional analysis of mkrn genes is now required to better
understand the evolution of this gene family in vertebrates.

Methods
Fish

Platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus, population Rio Jamapa
WLC1274, closed colony stock derived from Jp163A),
zebrafish (Danio rerio, strain AB/TU) and medaka (Oryzias latipes, strain Hd-rR) were kept under standard conditions at the PRECI aquarium facility of the IFR128
Biosciences Gerland-Lyon Sud (Lyon, France). Fish
embryos were raised to the required stages of development in E3 embryo media [52] at 26°C for medaka and
28.5°C for zebrafish. Medaka and zebrafish embryos were
staged according to Iwamatsu [53] and Kimmel et al.
[54], respectively. Chicken samples (embryonic chicken,
one day before hatching and male adult tissue) were provided by B. Pain (Institut de Génomique Fonctionnelle de
Lyon, ENS de Lyon, France). Adult Xenopus laevis samples were gifts from F. Vollmar (Department of Cell and
Developmental Biology, University of Würzburg, Germany) and C. Schultheis (Physiological Chemistry I, University of Würzburg, Germany). Experimental research
reported here has been performed following internationally recognized guidelines (DDSV, Direction Départementale des Services Vétérinaires de Lyon, agreement
number A 69 387 0602).
In silico analyses

Protein and nucleotide sequences of mkrn genes were
identified using BLAST/BLAT searches against GenBank
[55], the current Ensembl genome assemblies ([24] version 57, March 2010) of human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla),
orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), macaque (Macaca
mulatta), mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), mouse
(Mus musculus), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), horse
(Equus caballus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), cow
(Bos taurus), opossum (Monodelphis domestica), wallaby
(Macropus eugenii), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), chicken (Gallus gallus), clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis), zebrafish (Danio rerio), medaka (Oryzias
latipes), green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), fugu (Takifugu rubripes), three-spined stickleback
(Gasterosteus aculeatus), sea squirts (Ciona intestinalis
and Ciona savignyi), the amphioxus genome (Branchiostoma floridae) [56] and the elephant shark genome (Callorhinchus milii) [57]. Automatic genome annotation
was refined manually using EST data and related protein
sequences with the help of FGENESH [58].
Nucleotide and protein sequences were loaded into
BioEdit [59] and aligned using MUSCLE [60,61] and
CLUSTALW2 [62]. Alignments were checked manually
and ambiguously aligned regions were removed before
phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic trees were calculated

Page 11 of 13

based on a 131 amino acid alignment including the
RING domain and the downstream adjacent C3H zinc
finger. Maximum likelihood reconstruction was done
using PhyML 3.0 [63,64], with 1000 bootstrap replicates
under the LG model. Similar results were obtained
using the neighbor-joining method as implemented in
MEGA4 [65] with bootstrap values of 10.000 replicates.
MEGA4 was also used to visualize phylogenetic trees.
To establish syntenic relationships between genomes we
used Genomicus [66], Synteny Database [67] and information provided by Ensembl Gene Trees [24]. Annotation of conserved protein motifs was performed with
Motif Scan [68] and NCBI conserved domains [12].
Ka/Ks calculation was peformed using KaKsCalculator
under the MYN model [69] on pairwise nucleotide
alignments done with LASTZ [70] and MUSCLE
[60,61]. Indicated Ka/Ks values are averages of values
obtained for all possible pairwise comparisons.
RT-qPCR expression analysis

Total RNA was extracted from separated male and
female tissues (brain, eyes, gills, heart, intestine, kidneys,
lung, liver, muscle, ovary, skin, spleen and testis) and
from whole embryos using the TRIReagent (Molecular
Research Center, Inc.). After DNase treatment, reverse
transcription was performed starting from 1 μg of total
RNA using the RevertAid First Strand Synthesis kit (Fermentas) and random hexamer primers. Real-time PCR
was done on 2 μl of dilutional series of cDNA starting
from a dilution of factor 20 using IQTM Custom SYBR®
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). PCR amplification was monitored with a CFX96 RealtimeSystem (Bio-Rad). After
one incubation step at 95°C for 3 min, the thermal
cycling protocol was as follows: 95°C for 10 seconds, 5562°C (primer-dependent annealing temperature) for 20
seconds and 72°C for 15 seconds during 40 cycles. Primers were designed manually and ordered from Invitrogen (Additional file 3). For each primer set, the
efficiency of the PCR reaction was measured in duplicate on serial dilutions (factor 10) of the cDNA sample.
Real-time PCR efficiencies (E) for each reaction were
calculated from the slope of the standard curve using
the equation E = 10 (-1/slope) -1 as implemented in the
BioRad CFX manager V1.5 software, with 100% efficiency as an indicator of a robust assay. All results
reported here are averages of two independent reverse
transcription reactions, which have been each tested
with two PCR reactions. For quantification, data were
analyzed by the 2-DDCT method [71], by normalizing
to the housekeeping gene rpl7 (ribosomal protein l7).
Expression was normalized to eye tissue (fish) or heart
(due to lack of eye samples for female frog and chicken).
