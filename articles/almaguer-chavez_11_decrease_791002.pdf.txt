Abstract
Background: Subculturing has been extensively used to attenuate human pathogens. In this work we studied the
effect of continuous subculturing of Nocardia brasiliensis HUJEG-1 on virulence in a murine model.
Methods: Nocardia brasiliensis HUJEG-1 was subcultured up to 130 times on brain heart infusion over four years.
BALB/c mice were inoculated in the right foot pad with the bacteria subcultured 0, 40, 80, 100 and 130 times (T0,
T40, T80 T100 and T130). The induction of resistance was tested by using T130 to inoculate a group of mice followed
by challenge with T0 12 weeks later. Biopsies were taken from the newly infected foot-pad and immunostained
with antibodies against CD4, CD8 and CD14 in order to analyze the in situ immunological changes.
Results: When using T40, T80 T100 and T130 as inoculums we observed lesions in 10, 5, 0 and 0 percent of the
animals, respectively, at the end of 12 weeks. In contrast, their controls produced mycetoma in 80, 80, 70 and 60%
of the inoculated animals. When studying the protection of T130, we observed a partial resistance to the infection.
Immunostaining revealed an intense CD4+ lymphocytic and macrophage infiltrate in healing lesions.
Conclusions: After 130 in vitro passages of N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 a severe decrease in its virulence was observed.
Immunization of BALB/c mice, with these attenuated cells, produced a state of partial resistance to infection with
the non-subcultured isolate.
Keywords: Mycetoma, Nocardia, attenuation

Background
Mycetoma in Mexico is mainly caused by actinomycetes
with Nocardia brasiliensis being predominantly isolated
(86.6% of the cases) together with Actinomadura
madurae (9.6% of the cases)[1]. In the state of Nuevo
León, in northeast Mexico, where Monterrey is located,
N. brasiliensis is isolated in 96% of cases [1]. Nocardia
brasiliensis is a normal inhabitant of soil and from there
it is inoculated by minor trauma with thorns or wood
splinters. In humans, the disease is characterized by the
production of extensive microabscesses surrounded by
granulomatous tissue production. Its pathogenic
mechanisms include the production of several proteases

that might be involved in tissue destruction [2,3]. The
production of an immune cellular response seems to be
essential in order to stop infection [4]. However, it has
also been claimed that the humoral immune response,
particularly IgM subtype antibodies, plays an important
role in resistance to infection [5].
Subculturing has been extensively used to attenuate
human pathogens. The clearest example is the bacillus
of Calmette and Guérin (BCG) which is a Mycobacterium bovis attenuated by continuous subculturing on
potato-bile medium [6]. Avirulent BCG was produced
after 230 serial passages of M. bovis and it is utilized to
prevent extensive forms of tuberculosis. The mechanisms involved in its avirulence were obscure until
recently when by sequencing the complete BCG chromosome, deletions of DNA stretches of up to 10-kb
(designated as RD, regions of difference) were observed

[7]. The reconstitution of some of these genes restores
most of the virulence of M. bovis BCG [8].
In the present work we studied if changes in virulence
of Nocardia brasiliensis HUJEG-1 occurred by subculturing this microorganism 130 times. We also studied
the ability of the non-virulent N. brasiliensis to induce
resistance to the infection with the non-subcultured
microorganism.

inoculated a group of animals with N. brasiliensis subcultured 130 times in the right foot pad. After 12 weeks
the left footpad was inoculated with the non-subcultured bacteria (T0). As a control we inoculated a group
of animals of the same age with the non-subcultured
isolate in the right footpad. In all cases the development
of lesions was scored and measured as described above.
Histopathological analysis comparing T0 and T130 strains

Methods
Subculture method

N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 was used for these experiments;
it has been utilized in previous assays [5,9]. Bacterial cultures obtained from mouse lesions were kept frozen at
-70°C in 20% skim milk. From these stocks, bacteria were
grown on Sabouraud agar at 30°C for 4 to 7 days; then a
single colony was placed in a 7 mL sterile Eveljham-Potter device. We added 2.5 mL of sterile saline and the bacterial mass was ground to obtain a homogeneous
suspension and turbidity adjusted to McFarland’s tube
No 1. With this suspension (0.1 mL) we inoculated a 125
ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 33 ml of previously sterilized liquid medium Brain Heart Infusion (BHI). It was
incubated with constant agitation at 110 rpm, at 37°C.
After 72 h the bacterial mass was harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 3 minutes, washed, and ground
as above. A new Erlenmeyer flask was inoculated with 0.1
ml of this suspension. These steps were repeated until
reaching 130 subcultures (T 130 ). Samples were taken
every 10 passages and kept frozen at -70°C, including T0.
The entire process took about four years.
Experimental mycetoma in a murine model

Cultures were obtained from the aliquots stored in the
deep freezer of passages 40, 80, 100 and 130 (T40, T80,
T100 and T130 respectively), as well as T0. The inoculums
were prepared using a previously published technique [9],
and adjusted to 20 mg (wet weight) of Nocardia brasiliensis in 50 μL of saline solution. Female BALB/c mice, 8-12
weeks-old were injected with 50 μl of the nocardial suspension in the right footpad and the development of
lesions was scored from 0 (for no inflammatory changes)
to 4+ (extension of the lesions beyond the ankle of the animal with extensive production of inflammation and
abscesses) as previously described [9]. The thickness of
each lesion was measured with a caliper every week for 12
weeks. The study was approved by the Comité Local de
Investigación en Salud No. 1908, Centro de Investigación
Biomédica del Noreste, IMSS, and the animal handling
was done according to our institutions’ guidelines.
Induction of infection resistance in a murine model

In order to study if infection with subcultured N. brasiliensis produced a state of immune resistance we

For histopathological evaluation of the infection process
we obtained biopsies of the inoculated footpad on weeks
1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 post-inoculation in both groups: the
T130 re-inoculated group and the control. Biopsies were
stored in 4% formalin for further processing and staining with H&E, Kinyoun, and PAS. To identify the subsets of the inflammatory cells, the tissue samples were
stained with antibodies against CD4 (helper T cells),
CD8 (suppressor/cytotoxic T cells) and CD14 (monocytes). Briefly, sections from affected feet destined for
immunohistochemistry were deparaffined, rehydrated
and subjected to a sequence of incubation steps starting
with sodium citrate (0.01 M) for epitope recuperation.
After blocking endogenous peroxidase activity with 1%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol, sections were incubated
in a humidity chamber during 18 h at 4°C with polyclonal anti-CD4, anti-CD8 and anti-CD14 (Dako Corp.,
Carpinteria, CA) diluted 1:200 in PBS. Following rinses
in PBS, sections were incubated for 20 min at room
temperature with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody,
and diluted 1:500 in PBS. This was followed by rinses in
PBS and 20 min humidity chamber incubation in streptavidin-biotin. Peroxidase activity was visualized by incubating the sections with 3,3’,-diaminobenzidine and
counterstaining with hematoxilin.
Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was performed with Statgraphics
under the heading of The StatAdvisor and also with
SPSS, Sigma Plot and Excel 2007. For comparison
between groups an ANOVA analysis was conducted and
as an alternative a Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. A P
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
I. Effect of subculture on Nocardia brasiliensis HUJEG-1
virulence

In Figure 1 we show the evolution of the natural infection in mice when inoculating the bacteria subcultured
for 40 and 80 passages compared with the control (T0).
In the animals inoculated with T0 there is an initial
inflammation due to an intense antigenic stimulation
produced by the inoculum, followed by a decrease in
the thickness of the footpad. Mycetomas appear after 56 weeks after infection. Twelve weeks after inoculation

Figure 1 Development of lesions of mice infected with T40, and T80. Mice were infected with 20 mg (wet weight) of bacterial fragments
from T40 (left) and T80 (right). The footpad thickness was measured weekly; each point represents the mean of 20 animals and bars represent
the standard deviation. As a control we inoculated a group of animals with T0 (open circles). When analyzed with the ANOVA test, a significantly
difference was observed with regard to the control at 12 weeks post inoculation (P < 0.001) in both cases.

there is an intense increase in the footpad size characterized by the presence of abscesses and fistulae.
When inoculated with the subcultured N. brasiliensis
strains a different behavior was observed. After the
initial inflammatory response the mean thickness of the
footpad decreased significantly after five weeks postinoculation in all cases. The formation of mycetoma
lesions (more than +) at week 12, was observed in 10, 5,
0 and 0 percent of the animals inoculated with T40, T80,
T100 and T130 respectively (Table 1). Their controls produced mycetoma in 80, 80, 70 and 60% of the inoculated animals. At week 12, the development of lesions in
the groups inoculated with the subcultured isolate was
compared with its own control (inoculated with T0),
and analyzed with the ANOVA test. A P < 0.001 was
observed in all cases.
II. Induction of infection resistance in a murine model

The animals inoculated with N. brasiliensis subcultured
130 times produced no lesions until 12 weeks after
inoculation (P < 0.001). At the end of 12 weeks, these

animals were challenged with the non-subcultured isolate in the left footpad (Figure 2). The natural evolution
was similar in the first five weeks after inoculation with
the non-subcultured isolate, but subsequently, we
observed a decrease in the development of lesions as
compared to their respective controls (P = 0.021) (P
value determined by a variance test ANOVA).
III. Histological study of the lesions

In mice inoculated with the non-subcultured N. brasiliensis we observed abundant polymorphonuclear cells
(PMN) surrounding the N. brasiliensis fragments inoculated (not yet constituted in grains) after 1 week of
inoculation (Figure 3). Two weeks later, grains were
observed surrounded by PMN and fibrosis was visible
while at the periphery a layer made up of abundant
foamy macrophages was evident. Seven weeks postinoculation abundant grains and microabscesses contained in concentric fibrotic walls were observed. And at
the 12 weeks of inoculation gigantic foamy cells were
present around the abscesses with grains floating in a
huge abscess composed of PMN and necrotic cells.
Macroscopically it was assigned as a 4+ lesion.
The animals inoculated with T130 and re-inoculated
with T0 showed an initial PMN infiltrate around the
inoculum’s fragment (Figure 4). Three weeks post-infection, micro abscesses containing the grains or inoculum
fragments surrounded by a layer of foamy macrophages
were present. At week five, microabcessess were formed
with smaller amounts of foamy cells than in those in
animals inoculated with T0 and grains in different stages
of destruction were observed. A strong mononuclear
infiltrate in the periphery of the microabscesses amongst

the collagen fibers was evident. After five weeks, there
was a decrease in the number of animals with lesions
(Figure 2). Biopsies taken from animals presenting
lesions at 12 weeks showed abundant grains in microabscesses encapsulated in fibrotic walls.
IV. Immunostaining of the lesions

In Table 2, the results of the immunostained biopsies
are shown. In the animals inoculated with the non-subcultured isolate, we observed few CD8+ T lymphocytes,
mostly situated around microabscesses, among the fibrosis; macrophages (CD14+ cells) were rarely seen. CD4+
T lymphocytes were observed more numerous. In heavily infected mice (12 weeks after infection), there were
few lymphocytes and macrophages, perhaps due to the
fact that most of the lesions were composed of
abscesses.
In the animals inoculated with T130 and then challenged with the non-subcultured bacteria a different pattern emerged. CD8+T lymphocytes were rarely seen
(Table 2) in all samples analyzed, while CD4+ lymphocytes were much more numerous after 5 weeks of
inoculation (Figure 5). At this time clinical lesions
decrease in size and most animals started to heal.
Macrophages (CD14+ cells) were observed very abundantly in clusters from the fifth week in the scarred
areas of the lesions, constituting most of the cells present (Figure 5).

Discussion
Five weeks after infection the lesions started to heal in
the animals inoculated with T130 and re-inoculated with
T0. At this time the lesions were microscopically

characterized by the presence of hollow and semidestroyed grains as well as by the presence of an intense
mononuclear infiltrate. These microscopical features are
similar to those observed in Lewis rats infected with N.
brasiliensis [10]. These animals are naturally resistant to
the infection even when using high amounts of bacteria.
They present an initial inflammatory reaction, but from
this point the lesions start to heal spontaneously; in the
microscope, thin-walled, semi-destroyed grains are
observed. This suggests that immunization with the attenuated cells (T130) can induce an immune state of resistance, although it is not complete. It will be important
to assay re-immunizations with the whole bacteria or
crude extracts to determine if the level of resistance can
be increased.
The presence of small amounts of lymphocytes and
macrophages in biopsy tissue of human cases of actinomycetoma has been reported [11,12]. They are present
in low numbers and are situated at the periphery of the
microabscesses; similar findings were observed in this
work in mice infected with T0. In leprosy, two patterns
of in situ localization of T lymphocytes subsets have
been described: in tuberculoid lesions CD8+ (OKT8+)
cells are found around the granulomata, and CD4+
(OKT4+) cells are distributed throughout the granuloma
[13]. In lepromatous patients both subsets are distributed throughout the granuloma with no predilection for
the periphery. The organization of T lymphocyte subsets
in tuberculoid leprosy reflects an effective immune
response. In actinomycetoma, there are not true granulomas, instead the microorganisms are contained inside
microabscesses surrounded by a layer of foam laden
macrophages. These microscopic features have been

described before as “N. brasiliensis lesions” which are
different of those presented by “N. asteroides“ [14]. In
the case of mice immunized with T130 and then challenged with T0 we observed an increase in CD4+ lymphocytes as well as an abundant infiltrate of

macrophages (CD14+ cells) five weeks after immunization. Mononuclear cells were always located in clusters
outside the microabscesses in the scar tissue. It appears
that this remarkable increase in the number of macrophages is responsible for the elimination of Nocardia

and consequent healing of the lesions in our experiments. The identification of the antigens of N. brasiliensis which elicits this cellular immune response, as well
as the immune mechanisms (cytokines and cells)
involved in the destruction of the grains, will help to
provide a better understanding of the resistance
mechanisms to N. brasiliensis.
Studies on bacterial evolution have permitted the analysis of changes in the genome produced by adaptation
to a particular medium or niche. In Escherichia coli it
has been observed that mutations, deletions, IS insertions, duplications and inversions in the chromosome
appear in as short as in 2000 generations [15] and gene
changes increase in a linear form until 20,000 generations producing the loss of about 1.2% of the original
chromosome (during a total of 20 years of subculturing).
Although it is a large amount of deleted, DNA most of
the mutations observed were synonymous (without
sense), not affecting the biological properties of the bacterium. In our case it seems that Nocardia needs only a
few generations to produce changes in its virulence,
since after 40 subcultures we observed a remarkable

Page 7 of 8

difference in virulence. In Burkholderia cenocepacia as
little as 500 generations made this bacterium unable to
kill the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [16]. In that
work 1000 generations took about 152 daily subcultures.
Given the longer generation time of Nocardia it took
about 4 years to achieve 130 subcultures. It is difficult
to calculate the exact number of generations since
Nocardia brasiliensis divides by producing filaments
rather than by binary fission. It will be necessary to
design an experiment to overcome this problem and
determine the number of generations in order to compare our results with other experiments in microbial
evolution.
In the case of M. bovis, a phylogenetically related
organism, it took about 230 subcultures in potato-ox
bile liquid medium to decrease its virulence for several
mammals, including calves, horses, and man [6]. BCG
attenuation has been explained by the loss of large DNA
stretches (known as the regions of difference, RD) [7],
with the most important being RD1 which includes
ORF’s coding for proteins ESAT-6 and CFP10. In the
case of N. brasiliensis, we observed a significant decrease
in virulence, however since we do not yet have the N.
brasiliensis genome sequence, we can not determine the
genetic changes responsible for the decrease in virulence. DNA sequence analysis of the complete genome
of N. brasiliensis will allow us to determine the genes
involved in Nocardia brasiliensis virulence.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we observed a remarkable decrease in the
virulence of Nocardia brasiliensis HUJEG-1 after subculturing it 130 times in vitro, compared to the parent
strain. This can be an excellent model to study the
immunological mechanisms involved in resistance in
mycetoma, since a previous inoculation with the attenuated N. brasiliensis provides protection against the infection with the parent strain or T0.
