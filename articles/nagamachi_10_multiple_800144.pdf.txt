Abstract
Background: Gymnotus (Gymnotidae, Gymnotiformes) is the Neotropical electric fish genus with the largest
geographic distribution and the largest number of species, 33 of which have been validated. The diploid number varies
from 2n = 39-40 to 2n = 54. Recently we studied the karyotype of morphologically indistinguishable samples from five
populations of G. carapo sensu stricto from the Eastern Amazon of Brazil. We found two cytotypes, 2n = 42 (30 M/SM +
12 ST/A) and 2n = 40 (34 M/SM + 6 ST/A) and we concluded that the differences between the two cryptic species are
due to pericentric inversions and one tandem fusion.
Results: In this study we use for the first time, whole chromosome probes prepared by FACS of the Gymnotus carapo
sensu strictu species, cytotype with 2n = 42. Using two color hybridizations we were able to distinguish pairs 1, 2, 3, 7, 9,
14, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21. It was not possible to separate by FACS and distinguish each of the following chromosome
pairs even with dual color FISH: {4,8}; {10,11}; {5,6,17}; {12,13,15}. The FISH probes were then used in chromosome
painting experiments on metaphases of the 2n = 40 cytotype. While some chromosomes show conserved synteny,
others are rearranged in different chromosomes. Eight syntenic associations were found.
Conclusions: These results show that the karyotype differences between these cryptic species are greater than
assumed by classical cytogenetics. These data reinforce the previous supposition that these two cytotypes are different
species, despite the absence of morphological differences. Additionally, the homology of repetitive DNA between the
two provides evidence of recent speciation.
Background
Cross-species FISH using whole chromosome painting is
widely used for phylogenomic studies in many vertebrate
groups, including primates [1-7], bats [8,9], deer [10],
birds [11,12], etc. These studies make important contributions to our understanding of genomic reorganization

Research using chromosome painting in fishes is
unusual. It has been used only with probes made by
microdissection [13-19] or by CGH, the latter without
defining chromosome pairs [20]. The probes made by
flow cytometry have higher complexity than those made
by microdissection, and are more appropriate for crossspecies hybridization [21]. However, there are no reports
in the literature of FACS (Fluorescent Activated Chromo-

some Sorting) generated probes for chromosome painting involving a whole fish genome.
The chromosome structure of a fish, a cold-blooded
vertebrate, lacks both GC-rich and GC-poor compartments. The absence of compartmentalization of their
genomes may be the reason for failure to obtain good Gbands (for revision, see [22]). Also, this could explain the
difficulty in getting whole chromosome-specific probes
by FACS. As well, fish chromosomes are small and there
is not enough difference in size to allow the separation of
each individual pair. An additional difficulty is to obtain
fibroblast cultures and chromosome preparations of high
quality and with sufficient metaphases.
Gymnotus (Gymnotidae - Gymnotiformes) is the Neotropical electric knifefish genus with the largest geographic distribution, occurring from southern Mexico to
northern Argentina [23]. It is also the most diverse
known Gymnotiformes genus, with 33 validated species,
of which 18 are known to occur in the Amazon basin
[24,25,23,26]. Previous cytogenetic studies show that the
diploid number in this genus ranges from 2n = 39-40
(with sex chromosomes of the type X1X2Y) to 2n = 54,
exhibiting variation in the karyotype formula, the quantity of heterochromatin, and the position of the Nucleolar
Organization Region [27-30].
Gymnotus carapo (holotype from Suriname) was
described by Linneaus in the first half of the XVIII century (Albert & Crampton, 2003). Currently it is defined as
G. carapo sensu stricto and is understood as a complex of
morphologically similar or cryptic species, with a large
distribution area (Albert & Crampton, 2003). Cytogenetic
studies of samples identified as G. carapo show different
karyotypes: 2n = 54 and 2n = 52 from Southern Brazil, 2n
= 48 in Amazonas, 2n = 42 in Pará (reviewed [30]).
Recently we studied the karyotype of morphologically
indistinguishable individuals from five populations of G.
carapo sensu stricto from the Eastern Amazon of Brazil.
We found two cytotypes, 2n = 42 (30 M/SM + 12 ST/A)
and 2n = 40 (34 M/SM + 6 ST/A) and we concluded that
the differences between these two cryptic species are due
to pericentric inversions and one tandem fusion [31].
In this study we were able to use, for the first time,
whole chromosome probes prepared by FACS from a
fish, Gymnotus carapo sensu stricto species, with 2n = 42
cytotype. These probes were used in hybridizations on
metaphases of the cytotype with 2n = 40, to determine
the differences between the karyotypes of the two cryptic
species.

Methods
We performed chromosome painting analysis on two
specimens of Gymnotus carapo from two localities in the
Eastern Amazon Basin, Pará State, Brazil: Santa Cruz do
Arari (00°42'03.2"S,049°,10'42.1"W) on Marajo Island

(MCP 40926) and Almeirim (01°31'34.2"S,052°33'37.9"W)
(MPEG 13329). These specimens are part of the sample
studied by Milhomem et al. [30,31].
A primary fibroblast cell line was established from an
electric knifefish Gymnotus carapo sensu stricto, cytotype
2n = 42, from Santa Cruz do Arari (Marajo Island).
Whole chromosome probes were made from this cell line
at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of
Cambridge, UK. The chromosome specific probes were
made by degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR (DOPPCR) on flow-sorted chromosomes as described previously [32,10]. Briefly, the chromosomes were prepared as
described and stained with Hoechst 33258 (2 mg/mL)
and Chromomycin A3 (40 mg/mL) in the presence of
magnesium sulfate (2.5 mmol/L) for 2 h. Sodium sulfate
(25 mmol/L) and sodium citrate (10 mmol/L) were added
15 min prior to flow sorting. Chromosome sorting was
performed using a dual-laser cell sorter (FACStar Plus;
Becton Dickinson Immuno-Cytometry Systems). About
400 chromosomes were sorted from each peak in the flow
karyotypes. Chromosomes were sorted directly into PCR
tubes containing 30 μL distilled water. These samples
were amplified by DOP-PCR using the primer 6 MW
[32]. Primary PCR products were labelled either with biotin-16-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim), Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-12-dUTP (Amersham) or Cy3-dUTP,
by taking 1 μL of product to a second round of DOP-PCR
using the same primer. The biotin probes were detected
with avidin-Cy3 or avidin-Cy5.
The metaphase chromosomal preparations from Gymnotus carapo sensu stricto, cytotype with 2n = 40 from
Almeirim, were made following the methods described
by Bertollo et al. [33].
In-situ hybridization of painting probes was performed
as previously described [10]. Briefly, 14 μL of the hybridization mixture (50% formamide, 1 × SSC, 10% dextran
sulfate, 5 mg salmon sperm DNA) and 1 μL of labeled
PCR product were denatured at 65°C for 1 min. In-situ
hybridization was performed for 48-72 h at 37°C. The
hybridization signal was detected as described earlier
[10]. After hybridization and washing of the slides, biotinylated chromosome paints were detected with avidin
(Vector Laboratories) coupled with Cy3, CY5 or FITC
(Amersham). Probes directly linked to fluorochromes
were also used, especially for dual or multi-FISH experiments. DAPI was used as a counterstain. In England,
FISH digital images were obtained using a cooled CCD
camera (Photometrics NU200 series equipped with a
Kodak KAF 1400 chip) coupled to a Zeiss Axiophot
microscope. The software Smart Capture VP (Digital Scientific) was used for camera control, digital image acquisition and the merging of DAPI and the fluorochrome
images of the paints. In Brazil, digital images were captured with a CCD camera AxioCam Mrm coupled to a

Figure 1 shows the DAPI banding karyotype of Gymnotus carapo sensu stricto, cytotype with 2n = 42 (30 M/SM
+ 12 ST/A), from which the whole chromosome paints

were made. The bivariate flow karyotype shows the four
regions (Figure 2), from which whole chromosome
probes were produced. Hybridization experiments on
metaphases from the same species (Figure 3) show that
the only GC-rich region, R1, is represented by the NORbearing chromosome (pair 20 - Figure 3a); R2 is represented by the four biggest pairs (1, 2, 3 and 16 - Figure
3b); R3 by the eight medium sized pairs (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17,
18 and 19 - Figure 3c) and R4 by the eight smallest pairs
(9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 21 - Figure 3d). A same species multicolor FISH experiment with all the four probes
shows that all the 42 chromosomes were hybridized,

without superimposition (Figure 3e). From each of the
three regions (R2, R3 and R4) further sorting produced
three (R2) and four (R3 and R4) subregions (Figure 2).
The results of same species hybridization showed that
these subregions contain fewer chromosomes (Figure 4).
From S2A, S2B, and S2C of R2: S2A contains pairs 1, 2
and 16; S2B contains pairs 2 and 16; S2C contains pairs 1
and 16. From S3A, S3B, S3C, and S3D of R3: S3A contains
pairs 5, 6, 7 and 17; S3B contains pairs 7 and 19; S3C contains pair 7; S3D contains pairs 5, 6, 7, 17 and 18. From
S4A, S4B, S4C, and S4D of R4: S4A contains pairs 12, 13
and 15; S4B contains pairs 12, 13, 14 and 15; S4C contains
pairs 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 21; S4D contains pairs 12, 13,
14, 15 and 21. These results are summarized on Table 1.
Apart from the homologous sequences, the probes also
hybridized to non-specific regions, mainly in centro-

meric, interstitial, pericentromeric areas and/or the arms
of some chromosomes, including the NOR. These areas
have highly repetitive DNA.
Dual color hybridization was used for identification of
chromosomes pairs from each of the regions (R2, R3 and
R4), as illustrated in Table 2. In brief, it is possible to identify individually pairs 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21,
while it was not possible to distinguish each of the following chromosome pairs even with dual color FISH: {4,8};
{10,11}; {5,6,17}; {12,13,15}.
Cross-species hybridization: Gymnotus carapo sensu
stricto: cytotype 2n = 42 hybridized to cytotype 2n = 40
Whole chromosome paints from Gymnotus carapo
sensu stricto, cytotype 2n = 42, were hybridized on metaphases of the cryptic species with cytotype 2n = 40. For
the precise definition of which chromosome belongs to
each region, dual colour FISH was used with R3 × R4
(Figure 5). It was possible to define the chromosome or
chromosome segment in the 2n = 40 genome that corresponds to each chromosome from R3 (pairs 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
17, 18, 19) and R4 (pairs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21) from
cytotype 2n = 42. The remaining chromosome or chromosome segments correspond to R1 (the easily identified
NOR pair - Figure 6a) or R2 (pairs 1, 2, 3, 16 - Figure 6b,
c). Using dual color FISH with probes from the same
region, it was possible to identify the chromosomes of
this region (Figure 6).

Figure 7 shows the karyotype with DAPI banding of G.
carapo 2n = 40 cytotype. Analysis of the hybridizations
(Figure 7, Table 3) shows that the pairs 1, 2, 9, 14, 19, 20
and 21 (cytotype 2n = 42) had their synteny conserved
and correspond to pairs 1, 2, 14, 17, 19, 20, 15 (cytotype
2n = 40), respectively. Pairs 3, 7, 16 and 18 were rearranged in two parts each. The {10,11} group of chromosomes reveal two separate segments of homology, the
{4,8} group reveal three segments and the {5,6,17} and the
{12,13,15} groups reveal four segments. The following
syntenic associations were found (Figure 7, Table 3): 18/
{12,13,15} (pair 3); {10,11}/3 (pair 5); 3/{4,8} (pair 6); 18/
16 (pair 7); 7/{5,6,17} (pair 8); 7/{4,8} (pair 9); {12,13,15}/
{10,11} (pair 12); 16/{5,6,17} (pair 18).
The probes also painted highly repetitive DNA regions
in the 2n = 40 genome, usually in a pericentromeric

Chromosomes

region in a non-specific way. A large region on 4p proximal, 10p proximal and 11q proximal also painted in a
non-specific way, probably because of highly repetitive
DNA.

Discussion
Gymnotus carapo sensu stricto with 2n = 42 from Marajó
Island (Pará-Brazil) is the first fish whose genome was
used to generate FACS whole chromosome-specific
probes covering the whole karyotype. This is a landmark
in the cytogenetic studies of the family Gymnotidae
(Gymnotiformes) and the fish in general.
The genome organization of fishes, with its small-sized
chromosomes and non-compartmentalization of the
chromosomes in GC- or AT-rich sequences (for review,
see [22]), makes it difficult to isolate single chromosomes

The dual color FISH allowed the distinction of all four
chromosome pairs from Region 2. In Region 3, this allowed the
distinction of pairs 7, 18 and 19. It is not possible to distinguish
pairs {4, 8} and {5, 6, 17}. In region 4, this allowed the distinction
of pairs 9, 14 and 21. It is not possible to distinguish pairs {10, 11}
and {12, 13, 15}.

by FACS. As a consequence, most of the probes obtained
in our study represent chromosome groups and not single chromosomes. So, for chromosome identification we
have to apply a strategy different from that used for
warm-blooded vertebrates, in which most probes are
actually derived from single chromosomes. Dual color
FISH using probes from the same flow karyotype region
allowed the identification of many chromosomes individually (pairs 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21) except
groups: {4,8}, {10,11}, {5,6,17} and {12,13,15}, as shown in
Table 2.
The mapping of these probes in the 2n = 40 G. carapo
cytotype shows surprising and very interesting results.
Using classical cytogenetics we supposed that the differences between these karyotypes resulted from a tandem
fusion, to explain the diploid number difference, and several pericentric inversions to explain the differences in
the karyotypic formula [31]. However, the cross-species
FISH made clear that genomic rearrangements were
much more frequent than supposed by classical cytogenetics. From the original 21 chromosome pairs of the 2n
= 42 G. carapo cytotype, only seven chromosomes (pairs
1, 2, 9, 14, 19, 20, 21) have their synteny conserved in the
2n = 40 cytotype. The remaining chromosomes which
were individually identified (pairs 3, 7, 16, 18) are all
involved in rearrangements with other chromosomes
(Figure 7, Table 3). From the chromosomes that remained
in groups, the {4,8} group of chromosomes paint a single
chromosome (pair 10) and two other chromosomal segments (6q distal and 9q); the {5,6,17} group of chromosomes paint two single chromosomes (pairs 4 and 11) and

These results show the great importance of comparative genomic mapping using FACS generated whole chromosome-specific probes. In cold-blooded vertebrates like
fishes, whose chromosomes do not have a G-banding pattern, the number of rearrangements that differentiate
karyotypes is likely to be underestimated. Probably many
species with similar 2n and fundamental numbers have
many rearrangements, like translocations, that do not
change the diploid number and chromosome morphology.
The large genomic reorganization found between the
two population cytotypes of Gymnotus carapo sensu
stricto here studied confirms the hypothesis that they are
really different species. The fact that the external morphology, the meristic data and their pigmentation do not
allow their distinction [31], suggests that their speciation
has been a recent event, in which chromosomal reorganization had a major role.
The paint probes from the 2n = 42 genome also hybridize to highly repetitive DNA regions in the 2n = 40
genome, indicating that this DNA is homologous in both
species. Normally, satellite DNA has great sequence
divergence between closely related species, despite having great similarity within the repeats of one species [3436]. The homology of this DNA in both species is additional evidence for recent speciation.
The production of FACS whole chromosome probes
from other fishes will be important for understanding
chromosomal evolution in vertebrates. Certainly this
approach is revealing a wealth of new data in these organisms.

Conclusion
The whole chromosome probes in Gymnotus carapo
sensu stricto with 2n = 42 here described and obtained by
FACS were used in a cross-species experiment. The chromosome painting demonstrated the large genomic reorganization found between the two cytotypes.

Authors' contributions
CYN conceived of the study, carried out chromosome painting in Gymnotus
carapo sensu stricto with 2n = 42 and 2n = 40, organized the data and wrote
most of the paper. JCP carried out chromosome painting in Gymnotus carapo
sensu stricto with 2n = 42 and contributed to the discussion of data. SSRM carried out chromosome painting in Gymnotus carapo sensu stricto: cytotype 2n =
40 and contributed to the discussion of data. ACPS collected the samples and
helped with the FISH analysis. PCMO'B carried out the whole chromosome
probes from Gymnotus carapo sensu stricto with 2n = 42 cell lines. MAFS participated of the techniques development and coordinated the study. All authors
read and approved the final manuscript.
