Abstract
This essay explores the link between the limbic/hypothalamic systems within the complex
conditions of hydrocephalus and myelomeningocele. Acknowledging the neuroanatomical and
neuroendocrine risks inherent in the developing brains of these individuals, we focus on the
converging components of temperament, cognition, and language.

Introduction
Children with myelomeningocele (MM) do not easily fit
into stereotypical profiles. Professionals, families, and
inter-disciplinary teams, devoted to the support of these
individuals and the reduction of secondary disabilities,
see daily testaments to individual variations. Clinical
commonalities among those with MM are frequently
noted and perhaps too often – and too simplistically –
considered inherent to the condition. Behavioral characteristics have long been one such category for easy generalities. As modern investigators study the underlying keys
to cognitive and behavioral disabilities, theories related to
cortical development and differentiation have offered
insightful possibilities [1]. Much remains to be discovered
in the realm of behavior, emotions, and personality profiles within this group and the biologic differences that
may explain them.

This essay is submitted with the suggestion that in our
ongoing quest to understand the learning and behavioral
characteristics in youth with MM, focus might reasonably
be placed on cellular and neurobiological mechanisms
specifically related to the limbic and hypothalamic systems. Given the developmental shifts in neuro-architecture in the fetus and infant with MM, we offer the limbic
system with its cortical, and brain stem interconnections,
and particularly its close association with the hypothalamic region, as an area wherein many of the phenotypic
commonalities may arise.
Similarities and variations in temperament profiles
among children with MM present an opportunity to
explore and enhance our understanding of this ontologically old but, as yet, not fully understood portion of the
brain. Temperament patterns among this group, differing
from other cohorts, may be reflective of altered integrity

within this intricate neural system. The converging components of temperament, memory, and language in this
group of children with developmental differences may
help the researcher and the clinician to better address the
so-called behavioral issues that impact academic learning.

Entorhinal, subicular cortices – are implicated in spatial
memory storage, connect hippocampus to remainder of
temporal cortex [2].
Septal nuclei – a subcortical target of hippocampus [2].

We will re-visit established and emerging information
related to the limbic and hypothalamic systems. We will
review reports from recent studies on language and on
temperament among children with MM, and comparative
work focused with different at-risk populations of children. These will be considered along with other clinically
relevant phenotypic findings among children with MM
that have clear links to the limbic and hypothalamic systems.

Le Grand Lobe Limbique
The limbic system consists of structures reminiscent of the
old mammalian brain corresponding to that of the socalled higher mammals [2,3]. The various components of
the limbic system influence a diversity of functions that
are integral to the cognitive aspects of autonomic, affective, and sexual behavior [4]. Components of the system
and their general activities that might be expected to
impact memory and/or temperament include the following:
Amygdala – little almond shaped structure near the temporal pole. It receives catecholamine and 5-HT containing
projections from the brain stem. Its most prominent projection (stria terminalis) runs in the wall of the lateral ventricle, ultimately connecting to the hypothalamic center.
Along with other behaviors (particularly sexual), it mediates the major affective activities describe as fear [3,5,6].
Anterior thalamic nucleus – associated with variations in
emotional reactivity [3].
Cingulate gyrus – located on the medial side of brain
near the corpus callosum. Implicated in encoding and
retrieval of semantic and episodic memories, attention,
drive and pain perception [7].
Hippocampus – formed from the inferior portion of the
temporal lobe into the lateral ventricle. It is involved in
memory, especially long-term memory. When both hippocampi are completely ablated, nothing can be retained
in the memory. The intact hippocampus allows comparison of the conditions of a present challenge with similar
previous experiences. This process is central to the ability
to make choices [3,8]. This can be critical for survival in
the wild – or perhaps survival in the classroom.

Mamillary complex – is the major limbic-hypothalamic
area [2].
From a cellular and structural aspect, the proximity of limbic structures to the ventricles hints at the possibility of
neuropathological changes in these structures either
directly through mechanical compression effects of the
dilated ventricles, or indirectly via alterations of metabolic
pathways in children with MM [9-11]. Structural changes,
and potential functional sequellae, may also arise through
deficiencies in the developmental process when HC
occurs in the fetus. Behaviorally, an emerging body of
neuropsychological data suggests a critical relationship
between these structures, their functions, and their relationship to emotion, memory, and learning.

Tell-tale signs of limbic influence: Learning and
Temperament
Much has been written over the past decade describing
phenotypic profiles related to executive functions among
youth with MM. While the term executive function continues to be somewhat enigmatic, it has generally been
used to encompass a set of abilities including: sustained
focused attention and organizational skills, goal-directed
behaviors, flexibility with novel situations, generation of
unique plans, and working memory functions [12,13].
Long relied-upon anecdotal concepts (short attention
spans, poor organization skills, and memory problems)
have given way to more controlled studies [14-19].
Language skills evaluated in recent research described
both language production and comprehension within
theoretically grounded language subsystems [20-30].
From this, a modal profile for MM has been proposed:
strengths in syntax and lexicon; and weaknesses in pragmatic communication, making inferences, and understanding nonliteral language [31]. Research supporting
this modal profile for children with MM (especially as it
relates to higher-order language skills) is based on their
inclusion within the larger heterogeneous samples of children with hydrocephalus (HC) whose conditions were
associated with multiple etiologies, both congenital and
acquired (e.g. refs. [22,30]). Recent studies of a large sample of children with shunted HC and MM only, demonstrated that these children scored lower than age-matched
controls in all areas of language skills – even in the more
basic lexical semantic skills which, have long been considered "strengths" [26,29]. But two areas provided the chilPage 2 of 8

dren with particular difficulty: supralinguistic skills
(making inferences and understanding nonliteral language) and pragmatic judgment.
Cognitive skills of attention/executive function and memory are deeply embedded within acquisition and appropriate application of language [32,33]. The ability to make
inferences and understand ambiguities (both supralinguistic tasks) involves the integration of previously
learned world and linguistic knowledge with the new
knowledge presented [34,35]. For a pragmatically competent communicator, successful language outcomes
depend on adequately functioning systems of memory
(encoding and retrieval of experiential and linguistic
knowledge), attention (ability to focus on the presented
communicative task), and problem solving (including the
ability to judge and utilize social situations). The few studies that measured memory function in mixed samples of
children with MM and HC have demonstrated memory
deficits in encoding and retrieval both for verbal and nonverbal information [16,18]. Similarly, current research
seems to suggest a prevalence of attention/executive deficits in children with MM [14,15,17,19,36,37].
A more than moderate interaction between the successful
development and function of the limbic structures and
successful learning experiences among children with MM
seems likely. Structural or functional malformations of
this system should impact the unique learning and cognitive profiles of these children.
Prefrontal regions have been identified as critical in functions of memory, language and logical reasoning [38-40].
Animal models and clinical evidence suggest the integral
role of the limbic system. The uni-modal and poly-modal
inputs from neocortical association areas (including prefrontal), important for information processing, storage,
encoding and retrieval, all rely on competent structures
within the limbic system [8,41-46].

http://www.cerebrospinalfluidresearch.com/content/1/1/6

of the spinal cord, and the functional motor and urological deficits. The clinical manifestations of underlying neurodevelopmental aberrations centrally (the Arnold-Chiari
II malformation, ventricular variations, callosal variations, and associated migrational anomalies) are frequently as disabling as the more obvious motor deficits.
Structural and functional differences can result from
developmental and/or mechanical disruptions in the
formative stages – prenatally or thereafter. These central
nervous system anomalies, often accompanying the MM,
would be expected to influence behavior and learning in
these children [e.g. [47,48]].
Developmental disruptions such as those related to MM
can also provide "spin-off" developmental deficits related
to anatomy and physiology arising from structures that
form the limbic system and hypothalamus. Similarly, the
potential exists for the developing HC, with its cerebrospinal fluid blockage within and around the brain, to impact
the architecture of the emerging limbic system and its neuronal projections.
For example, vacuolization and degeneration of neurons
in the hippocampal formation have been observed both
within hydrocephalic rabbits and humans [9]. Dendritic
changes were observed in the hippocampus of neonatal
rats with kaolin-induced HC [10], and HC exacerbated
hypoglycemic injury in rat hippocampal cells [49]. Indeed
in a rat model of kaolin-induced HC, the resultant impairment of glucose metabolism was first observed in the CA3
region of the hippocampus [50], suggesting this area is
metabolically vulnerable to dysfunction. Further support
of limbic involvement in HC comes from a recent study
that reports damage to the fimbria/fornix of the hippocampus from autopsy-acquired brains of humans with
chronic HC [51].

How might these facts relate to our children with MM?
Shortly after the neural tube is formed, its caudal portion
develops into the spinal cord and the rostral portion into
the brain [3]. Of the three early brain vesicles, the forebrain gives rise to the telencephalon and diencephalon
from which structures of the limbic system and the
hypothalamus arise. The limbic system, arising from this
phylogenetically ancient region of the brain, incorporates
the hippocampus, the amygdala, and numerous receptor
sites for adrenal and endocrine neuromodulators.

Clinical evidence from patients, and recent brain imaging
studies suggest lesions of the right hippocampus result in
spatial memory deficits while left lesions impact verbal
memory [3,8,52]. Thus, resultant left and right CA3 dysfunction potentially contributes to the verbal and nonverbal memory deficits noted in children with MM and HC.
Further, findings by Dolan and Fletcher [53] provide evidence that the left hippocampus is active in encoding of
episodic memories by registering and processing novel
verbal material, the end-product being the so-called memory trace or engram. The inability of children with MM
and HC to respond efficiently to novel stimuli is well documented [54,55].

MM, resulting from a developmental disruption of this
normal neuroembryogenic process, is commonly characterized by its more visual and tangible manifestations:
defects within the bony vertebra, associated impairment

Anatomical and central molecular dynamics involved
with these language and memory deficits remain critically
important areas for future research. Equally intriguing are
those – or other – molecular substances and pathways

that mediate the response to the perceived frustrations
associated with functional deficits, which come into play
daily and hourly. What underlies and mediates the style of
behavioral responses? In other words, how does the
child's temperament phenotype become an integral part
of the clinical management, and neurophysiological
understanding of learning differences among children
with MM?
This task of describing individual differences among individuals within a society is ancient in its origin. Early Chinese tradition offers a view of human nature differences
based on a dark, female, earthly force (yin) and the accompanying active, light, heavenly force (yang). The great 2nd
century C.E. Roman physician, Galen, conceived a system
of balanced equilibrium of four basic humors, which
allowed the physician clues as to the nature of an illness
by his awareness of personality traits. This system, based
on yellow or black bile and phlegmatic or sanguine
natures, represented a culmination of prior ideas (Hindu,
Greek, Chinese, others) and provided the understanding
of the relationship of temperament to health and function
for more than a millennium [56].
More modern scientists have provided differing slants
regarding temperament characteristics of children. The list
includes Bates, Buss, Carey, Chess and Thomas, Goldsmith, Kagan, and Plomin [56-61]. The nature of temperamental categories, taking the various researchers' ideas
into account, seems to embody four qualities described by
Kagan: 1) variability among individuals, 2) relative stability over time and situation within the individual, 3) under
some genetic influence, and 4) emergence early in life
[56].
Temperament has been described in typically developing
children as the "how " of behavior distinct from ability or
"what" of behaving, and motivation or "why" of behavior
[60]. One recurring theme among the conceptual descriptions of temperament remains the notion of multiple
behaviors, along a continuum, which combine to interact
either favorably or unfavorably with the surrounding
environment. The nature of these behaviors is not at the
level of psychopathology. Rather, the potential for pathologic development lies within the process of the interaction
– the "goodness of fit" – between the environment and
the individual's behavioral responses. Consonance
between the child and his/her environment potentiates
optimal development and supportable teachable
moments [62]. Conversely dissonance between the child's
capacities, and style of behavior and the environment
demands result in maladaptive functioning. Such was the
case with Annie.

Annie's Story
Annie is an attractive little girl, eight years old, and with
abundant red-haired curls. Her diagnosis of MM and
shunted HC requires part-time wheelchair use as she
attends a public school and participates in recreation
activities in the community. Intelligent and engaging, she
has, nonetheless, met frustrations during her days at
school. Variably described as shy, capable, anxious, and/
or self-doubting, teachers and family members know of
Annie's apparent emotional lability.
Recent academic testing reconfirmed her cognitive
strengths with a full scale IQ in the above-average range.
Language evaluation showed "relative strengths" in lexicon and syntax, lesser scores in pragmatics, and significant
problems with higher-order language, and cognitive tasks
that required quick retrieval of stored information. Of
note, during the initial testing, Annie became tearful quite
quickly. Her negative responses related to the new tasks,
new environments, and her persisting fear of "not being
able to finish" (on any given activity). The examiner,
familiar with children with MM, recognized the triggers
and the responses before her. By careful explanations,
negotiating cues to assure Annie of her successes in the
testing, and agreements for "breaks" as needed, Annie
calmed, warmed to the tasks at hand, and completed the
testing successfully in the allotted time.
The developmental pediatric team was recently notified
by the family that Annie was experiencing episodes at
school of skin flushing, sweating, sensations of nausea,
and emotional stress. On one occasion, urinary incontinence accompanied the episode. These symptoms were
eventually noted to be related to those (infrequent) occasions when the teacher felt it necessary to enter a note
onto Annie's personal folder for parent review. Beginning
hints of school avoidance prompted the parents' concern.
Academic challenges and barriers as in the story of Annie
are quite common among youth with MM. Layers of
seemingly separate but simultaneous factors – cognitive,
memory, language, temperament, physical – can elevate
even daily and mundane tasks into sources of stress not
experienced by the typical classmate. Recent studies of
youth with MM and shunted HC, ages 5–12, demonstrated clusters of findings different from those classically
described by Chess and Thomas ("easy", "difficult", or
"slow to warm") or by Kagan ("inhibited" or "uninhibited"). Children with MM in these studies were reported
to be significantly different from normative profiles in five
areas: 1) adaptability – less; 2) distractibility – more; 3)
approach – guarded; 4) persistence on task – less; and 5)
predictability – less [55]. Given these temperament characteristics in a child with MM, perhaps related to the
unique differences in both central molecular dynamics

and neurodevelopmental anatomy, responses such as
Annie's begin to be understood.
While the focused study of the biological basis for temperament dates to mid-20th century, only recently have physiologic variables and temperament categorical descriptors
been paired for critical comparisons. These investigations
stem from relatively firm notions about the anatomy and
physiology of the central nervous system. Researchers
have tracked differing patterns of social response, and
encoding of emotional memories to the limbic system,
and particularly amygdala [63,64]. The amygdala has
been implicated in social cognition, involving adequate
recognition and judgment of facial expressions [3,65].
Preliminary studies within our institution reveal our
patients with MM and shunted HC had difficulty understanding nonverbal facial cues and expressions of annoyance (explaining in part their poor pragmatic skills).
Opioid-mediated inhibitory activities, or responses to the
dozens of neurotransmitters or neuropeptides both have
genetic implications and biochemical importance as they
potentially affect excitability centrally within the amygdala or connecting structures [56]. Potential changes in
functional outcomes might be anticipated.
These limbic structures – and their vulnerability in the
developing brain affected by MM – offer fertile ground for
clinical exploration in the broader study of cognition,
memory, and temperament. The segregation of emotion,
temperament, language, and cognitive performance is difficult to accomplish in the typical child; it is decidedly
more complex in the child with MM and HC who has coexistent ventriculomegaly from early gestation, mid-brain
variations, and cerebellar differences.
What then are the capacities and activities of these central
nervous system components – the limbic and hypothalamic systems – that are typically relied upon for daily
function, and which might have significant impact on
those outward actions and responses which we categorize
as temperament? Emotional triggers, goal direction for
problem solving, assimilation of information from the
various senses (vision, touch, auditory) – all of these
relate to the anatomy and associated function of the limbic system (notably the amygdala), and the closely related
hypothalamic region. Evidence from human and animal
studies indicates that the amygdala intervenes between
the regions concerned with the somatic expression of
emotion (hypothalamus, brainstem) and the neocortical
areas concerned with conscious feeling [3].
Similarly, the hypothalamus is a central player in the integration of information. For the specific areas throughout
the neocortex to finalize and actualize those processes
described as "executive functioning", regulation of stimuli

http://www.cerebrospinalfluidresearch.com/content/1/1/6

from the environment and peripheral systems of the body
is aided through hypothalamic function. Some actions
might well be expected to impact behavior we characterize
as components of temperament.
The anatomy of the hypothalamus is important when
considered along with the variations commonly noted in
our individuals with ventriculomegaly and Chiari malformations. It lies on the ventral surface of the cortex. The
third ventricle divides the hypothalamus and lies in close
proximity to hypothalamic projections [66]. Disturbances
or disruptions in these structures due to HC would not be
unexpected. Generally, signs or symptoms associated with
hypothalamic dysfunction might include: disorders of
satiety, appetite and/or caloric homeostasis; sexual dysfunction including precocious puberty or hypogonadism;
central autonomic disorders (sleep and consciousness regulation, gastrointestinal function, thermoregulatory control, sphincter disturbance); and affective variations
[3,66]. Corticotrophin releasing factor, related to the paraventricular nucleus, is integrally involved in the management of autonomic centers within the brainstem and, via
regulation of corticosteroids, with stress adaptation [3].
The effects of HC on neuronal pathology and function in
these regions have been demonstrated in both human
studies and animal models [10,49,50,67]. Such variations
in anatomy and fetal development of the midbrain structures – areas of tremendous variations among individuals
with MM – could play important roles in the ultimate
behavioral phenotypes described by temperament. For
example, in the temperament profile of the MM cohort
described above, attention was a significant outlier. Mirsky [68] has reminded us of the multi-component nature
of attention. The nature of the neuropsychological model
of attention depends upon the data used to generate it.
The network involved in the distribution of attention to
extra-personal targets implicates cortico-limbic-reticular
and hypothalamic circuits; damage to either impacts the
attention process [68]. The ultimate functions completed
within cortical regions are clearly important. But dysfunction in the limbic and hypothalamic regions seems intuitive within this population. They can be measured in
some instances (particularly neuroendocrine), and they
are consistent with the underlying biologic bases of temperament variation as posited by Kagan and others.

Temperament as a Component for Assessment
of Learning in Youth with MM
Annie's tale is not unusual for our children with MM and
shunted HC. Clinicians and researchers alike have experienced stories of lesser or more severe impairments. For the
parents and teachers working daily with children such as
Annie, an understanding of the normal process of neurodevelopment leads to clearer understanding and a better

differentiation from the abnormal. The research and subsequent writings of T. Berry Brazelton have provided ready
information to parents of typically developing children by
blending the Gesellian milestones of development with
the temperament concepts as outlined by Carey, Chess,
and Thomas [69]. The interplay of cognition, temperament, language, executive function, given the underlying
neuro-endocrine/central molecular dynamics that accompany MM, offers a greater challenge to clinicians, teachers,
and parents.

that are barriers to inter-personal optimal functioning and
truly psychiatric disorders. Given the neuro-anatomical
and neuro-endocrine risks associated with MM, heightened awareness and assessment of temperament in this
discriminating process is important.

For the classroom, identification of stressors and methods
to minimize autonomic over-response can be as critical to
successful learning as the understanding of memory
strengths, or language problems. As in our story, Annie
demonstrated persistence to task, willingness to approach
novel situations, positive mood, and the ability to adapt
to the testing situation – all temperament domains with
which she has struggled. The "goodness of fit" between
Annie and the examiner was critical before any progress
could be made in better understanding her relative academic and learning strengths. The autonomic dysfunction, manifested in her excessive sweating, flushing, and
urinary incontinence in school, only served to heighten
both the emotional and physical symptoms.

And the end of all our exploring

The differences in temperament profiles among children
with MM are unlike those in other diagnostic cohorts of
children with special health care needs [70,71]. Hughes et
al. [72] have described temperament patterns in preterm
infants over the first year of life. Descriptors of temperament characteristics differed from that seen in typically
developing full term infants and from that of our children
with MM. Because temperament is believed to be influenced by heredity, biology, and experience, parenting
must also be considered as a variable (moderator) in temperament development. This concept of "goodness-of-fit"
plays an important role in the parents' development, their
perception of the infant, and the ultimate quality of the
parent-child interactions [72].

Conclusion
T.S. Eliot wrote,
We shall not cease from exploration

Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.
As we continue, on behalf of children and youth with
MM, to explore and better understand the cognitive and
learning differences within the group, the developmental
variations related to underlying central nervous system
structures may continue to hamper the human tendency
to categorize. The modal profile may not be singular.
As assessments of strengths and differences continue; as
descriptors of quality of life are derived; as personality variances are accounted for; as curricula and "home programs" are constructed, the bio-psycho-social model
increasingly becomes the clear route for professional and
family partnership. For the researcher trying to join unconnected dots into a cohesive whole, we, like Eliot, may
need to return to the early components long-standing in
the evolution of the brain and its function. The ancient
limbic and hypothalamic systems leave indelible tell-tale
hints that should not be left behind in our quest for
understanding and raising the resilient child.

Competing interests
Learning, for the child with MM, certainly takes place
beyond the confines of preschool and classroom. Negotiating physicians, curious strangers, medical emergencies,
educational diagnosticians, environmental barriers, and
other stressors is a continual process. Raising a happy,
self-reliant, and resilient child is the dream of parents. Perrin [73] has suggested that "adjustment" might be conceptualized as 1] the presence of fewer behavioral problems,
2] inter-personal functioning or competence, and 3]
development of a positive self-concept. Parental perceptions of their child's actions and reactions contribute
greatly to the moderation of, or exacerbation of, affective
differences. It is incumbent on the professional to accurately discriminate between temperament characteristics

The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.
