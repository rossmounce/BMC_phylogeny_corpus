Abstract
Background: Many of the mutations accumulated by naturally evolving proteins are neutral in the
sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's ability to perform its primary biological function.
However, new protein functions evolve when selection begins to favor other, "promiscuous" functions
that are incidental to a protein's original biological role. If mutations that are neutral with respect to a
protein's primary biological function cause substantial changes in promiscuous functions, these
mutations could enable future functional evolution.
Results: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how cytochrome P450
enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on a single substrate have changed in their
abilities to catalyze reactions on five other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes
changed as much as four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous activities tend
to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely rationalized in terms of the chemical
structures of the substrates. The activities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a
coordinated fashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change in one activity
based on the measurement of several others.
Conclusion: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead to substantial changes in
protein functions that are not currently under selection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily
undergo functional evolution should selection favor new functions in the future.

Background
Nature employs proteins for a vast range of tasks, and
their capacity to evolve to perform diverse functions is one

of the marvels of biology. Recently, it has become possible
to reconstruct convincing scenarios for how new protein
functions evolve. One of the most important conclusions
of this work is that the initial steps may occur even before
the new functions come under selection [1-6]. The reason
is that in addition to their primary biological functions,
most proteins are at least modestly effective at performing
a range of other "promiscuous" functions [1,2,7-10]. In
laboratory experiments, selection can rapidly increase

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

these promiscuous functions, often without much immediate cost to a protein's original function [2]. In a particularly compelling set of experiments, Tawfik and coworkers
have shown that selection for a promiscuous activity
likely explains the origin and evolution of a bacterial
enzyme that hydrolyzes a synthetic compound only
recently introduced into the environment [2,11,12].
Mounting evidence therefore supports the idea that new
protein functions evolve when selection favors mutations
that increase an existing weak promiscuous function.
But for as long as 50 years, since Linus Pauling and Emile
Zuckerkandl published their seminal analysis of molecular change in proteins [13], it has been clear that only a
fraction of the mutations that accumulate in most naturally evolving proteins are driven by selection for an
entirely new function. Instead, many of the mutations
responsible for natural sequence divergence do not
change a protein's primary biological function, but rather
are due to either neutral genetic drift [14] or pressure for a
subtle recalibration of protein properties unrelated to the
acquisition of an entirely new function [15]. However,
mutations that accumulate under the constraint that they
not interfere with a protein's primary function could still
substantially alter other, promiscuous functions. Such
alterations could then aid in the subsequent evolution of
new functions.
Here we have experimentally investigated this possibility
using a set of enzymes that have undergone genetic drift
that is neutral with respect to a well-defined laboratory
selection criterion for enzymatic activity on a single substrate [16]. We have examined how these enzymes have
changed in their promiscuous activities on five other substrates. As described below, we find that the enzymes have
often undergone substantial changes in their promiscuous
activities, suggesting that neutral genetic drift could play
an important role in enabling future functional evolution.

Results and Discussion
A set of neutrally evolved cytochrome P450 enzymes
We focused our analysis on cytochrome P450 proteins.
P450s are excellent examples of enzymes that can evolve
to catalyze new reactions, since they are involved in a wide
range of important functions such as drug metabolism
and steroid biosynthesis [17,18]. We worked with P450
BM3, a cytosolic bacterial enzyme that can perform a variety of hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions, and is
thought to have a natural function that includes the
hydroxylation of fatty acids [19,20]. We have previously
described a set of P450 BM3 heme domain variants that
were created by laboratory neutral evolution from a common parent sequence [16]. Here we briefly recap the procedure used to create these P450s in order to explain their
origin and why they can properly be viewed as the product

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

of neutral genetic drift, albeit under a selection criterion
that represents a severe simplification of the pressures
likely faced by P450s evolving in nature.
The essential difference between neutral genetic drift and
adaptive evolution is that in the former case mutations
that have no substantial effect on fitness spread stochastically in a population, while in the latter case mutations
spread because they are beneficial and so favored by selection. Of course, it may be difficult to discern whether a
specific mutation in a natural population has spread neutrally or due to favorable selection. But in the laboratory it
is possible to define an arbitrary selection criterion to
ensure that all mutations spread due to neutral genetic
drift. Specifically, we imposed the requirement that the
P450s had to hydroxylate the substrate 12-p-nitrophenoxydodecanoic acid (12-pNCA) with an activity exceeding a
specific threshold [16]. All mutant P450s were therefore
straightforwardly classified as either functional (if they
exceeded the threshold) or nonfunctional (if they did
not). We readily acknowledge that the situation is almost
surely more complicated for natural P450 BM3 enzymes,
which are probably selected for several different enzymatic functions (the natural substrates of these enzymes
are not definitively known [19,20]). In addition, we make
no attempt to define how changes in a P450's enzymatic
functions might map to changes in the overall fitness of its
host organism, since there is not sufficient data on the
metabolic and ecological role of P450 BM3 to convincingly reconstruct such a mapping. Instead, our selection
criterion is simply an abstraction of the evolutionary
requirement that an enzyme's primary activity must
exceed some critical level in order to allow its host organism to robustly survive and reproduce. To implement laboratory neutral evolution using this selection criterion, we
began with a single parent P450 BM3 heme domain variant (called R1-11) and used error-prone PCR to create random mutants of this parent [16]. Mutants that failed to
yield sufficient active protein to hydroxylate at least 75%
of the 12-pNCA of the R1-11 parent when expressed in
Escherichia coli were immediately eliminated, while all
other mutants were carried over to the next generation
with equal probability. Any mutations that spread among
the offspring sequences were therefore by definition due
to neutral genetic drift, since there was no opportunity for
any functional mutant to be favored over any other.
Throughout the remainder of this work, we will refer to
mutations that spread by neutral genetic drift during our
experiments as "neutral" – the reader should keep in mind
that these mutations might not be neutral in all other evolutionary scenarios. In addition, in many natural settings
a mutation may be slightly deleterious or slightly advantageous. A more nuanced description would therefore
characterize a full fitness landscape containing different

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

gradations of fitness [21,22], with evolution moving
along ridges of high fitness [23]. Because the binary functional/nonfunctional classification made in our experiments ignores such gradations, these ridges in the fitness
landscape are reduced to a neutral network, with all
mutants either on the network (if they are functional) or
off the network (if they are nonfunctional). We also
emphasize that the fact that the mutations spread due to
neutral genetic drift does not mean that they have no
effect on the protein's properties. Indeed, one of the growing realizations about protein evolution is that mutations
that spread by neutral genetic drift may still have an
impact on future evolution [24,25]. One mechanism for
this impact is that neutral genetic drift can change a protein's stability and so alter its tolerance to future mutations [26-28]. As will be demonstrated below, another
mechanism is that neutral genetic drift can alter a protein's promiscuous functions.
As described previously [16], the end result of the neutral
evolution was 44 different P450 variants, each of which
satisfied the selection criterion for activity on 12-pNCA
(these are the combined final sequences from the monomorphic and polymorphic populations in [16]). For the
current study, we analyzed the promiscuous activities of
34 of these neutrally evolved P450 variants. The sequence
diversity of these P450s is shown in the phylogenetic tree
of Figure 1 and the full genotypes are given in Additional
file 1; they have accumulated an average of four nonsynonymous mutations each. Most of the mutations in the
P450 variants are unique – out of a total of 105 different
amino acid substitutions, only twelve occur in more than
variant (Additional file 1).
Activities of the neutrally evolved P450 enzymes
All of the P450 variants had evolved under selection solely
for their ability to hydroxylate 12-pNCA. We examined
their promiscuous hydroxylation activities on the five
other substrates shown at the top of Figure 2. Two of these
promiscuous substrates, propranolol (PROP) and 2amino-5-chlorobenzoxazole (2A5C, also known as zoxazolamine), are drugs that are metabolized by human
P450s [29,30]. The other three promiscuous substrates,
11-phenoxyundecanoic acid (11PA), 2-phenoxyethanol
(2PE), and 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene (MDOB), are
organic compounds of increasing structural dissimilarity
to 12-pNCA. The parent P450 possessed at least some
hydroxylation activity on all of these substrates (throughout the remainder of this work, "activity" refers to total
substrate turnovers per enzyme).

Figure 2
Activities of the neutrally evolved P450s on the six substrates
Activities of the neutrally evolved P450s on the six
substrates. The heat map shows the fold change in activity
of all 34 neutrally evolved P450 variant on all six substrates.
Each row shows the data for a different P450 variant, while
each column shows the activity on a different substrate. The
fold change in activity is the ratio of the variant's activity to
that of the neutral evolution parent. Both the substrates and
the P450 variants are hierarchically clustered according to
the activity profiles, as shown by the dendrograms at top and
left. Substrate abbreviations are the same as those used in
the text: PROP – propranolol, 2A5C – 2-amino-5-chlorobenzoxazole, MDOB – 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene, 2PE – 2phenoxyethanol, 11PA – 11-phenoxyundecanoic acid. The
standard errors for the changes in activity displayed in the
heat map tend to be much smaller than the changes themselves; these errors are shown explicitly in Figure 3.

strates, and Figure 3 shows the same data with standard
errors (raw data are in Additional files 2 and 3). As is
apparent from these figures, many of the neutrally
evolved P450s have undergone changes in their activities
that substantially exceeded the standard errors of the
measurements (for a more detailed analysis of measurement variability see the Methods and Additional file 4).
Even on 12-pNCA, some of the variants have undergone
modest increases or very mild decreases in activity. The
modest increases in 12-pNCA activity were unsurprising,

The bar graphs show the fold change in activity of all 34 neutrally evolved P450 variants on all six substrates. This is the
same data as in Figure 2, except these graphs also give error
bars showing the standard errors in two separate measurements of the activities. In most cases the standard errors are
much smaller than the activity changes themselves.

since the parent P450 only hydroxylates 12-pNCA with
about a quarter of the activity reported for a P450 engineered for maximal 12-pNCA activity [31]. Likewise, the
mild decreases in 12-pNCA activity were due to the fact
that during neutral evolution the P450s were only
required to maintain this activity above a minimal threshold (75% of the total 12-pNCA conversion of the parent
protein when expressed in E. coli [16]). The changes in the
promiscuous activities were often much larger than those
on 12-pNCA. For example, several of the neutrally
evolved variants have undergone nearly four-fold
increases in activity on one or more of 2PE, 2A5C, and
MDOB. Other variants have experienced equally large
decreases in one or more of the promiscuous activities.
The changes in promiscuous activities are therefore quite
substantial, although still much less than the 10- to 40fold increases reported in directed evolution experiments
that explicitly selected for improvement in a previously
unselected P450 BM3 activities [31-33].

Broad patterns of change in activity can be rationalized in
terms of substrate properties
The data in Figures 2 and 3 clearly indicate that some of
the P450s have undergone substantial changes in their
activities. In an effort to understand the nature of these
changes, we sought to determine whether there were any
clear patterns in the activities. In Figure 2, the substrates
have been hierarchically clustered so that each successive
cluster contains substrates on which the P450s have
increasingly similar activities (the clustering is illustrated
by the tree-like dendrogram at the top of the figure, with
similar substrates in adjacent columns). This clustering of
the substrates based on P450 activities is also readily
rationalized in terms of their chemical structures. For
example, 2A5C and MDOB cluster, meaning that P450s
with high activity on one of these substrates also tend to
have high activity on the other. Presumably, they cluster
because the similarity of their structures (both are fusions
of six and five membered rings) means that they have similar modes of docking in the substrate binding pocket.
Likewise, 12-pNCA and 11PA are phenoxycarboxylic acids
of similar chain length, and are in the same cluster. To a
lesser extent, 2PE resembles 12-pNCA and 11PA in its
phenolic ether structure, and it falls into a higher level
cluster with these two substrates. PROP shares a fused ring
structure with 2A5C and MDOB, and these three substrates share a common higher level cluster. Overall, the
hierarchical clustering indicates that substrates that
appear similar to the human eye are also "seen" this way
by the P450s, since the P450s tend to increase or decrease
their activities on these substrates in a coordinated fashion.

Figure 2 also shows the P450 variants arranged in hierarchical clusters. A visual inspection immediately indicates
that there is an overall association among all of the activities. Some of the P450 variants (redder rows) tend to
show improved activity on most substrates, while others
(bluer rows) tend to show decreased activity on most substrates. Taken together with the clustering of the similar
substrates, this overall association suggests that there are
two main trends in the activity changes. First, the P450s

appear to have undergone general changes in their catalytic abilities that are manifested by broad increases or
decreases in activity on all substrates. Second, the P450s
appear to have experienced shifts in specificity to favor
either the fused ring or the phenolic ether substrates.
To test whether these two apparent trends in activity
changes are supported by a quantitative examination of
the data, we performed principal component analysis.
Principal component analysis is a well-established mathematical technique for finding the dominant components
of variation in a data set, essentially by diagonalizing the
covariance matrix. As suggested by the foregoing visual
inspection, principal component analysis revealed that
two components explained most of the changes in P450
activities (Table 1). The first component contained positive contributions from all six substrates, and so represents a general improvement in catalytic ability. The
second component contained positive contributions from
the fused ring substrates and negative contributions from
the phenolic ether substrates, and so represents an
increased preference for the former class of substrates over
the latter. Together, these two components explain 82% of
the variance in activities among the 34 P450 variants. The
remaining 18% of the variance is explained by the four
remaining components, which represent more subtle
shifts in activity that are less easily rationalized by intuitive chemical arguments. Note that the major trends in
activity changes (overall increase/decrease in catalytic
ability, and increased preference for either phenolic ether
or fused ring substrates) are unlikely to be caused by the
occurrence of the same mutation in several P450 variants,
since most of the variants share no common mutations
(Additional file 1). Instead, there must be a number of different mutations that can contribute to each of these
trends.
Overall distributions of change in the activities
The preceding sections have demonstrated that neutral
genetic drift can lead to substantial changes in P450 activities, and that many of these changes can be understood
as resulting from either fairly general increases/decreases

The first two principal components explain 82% of the variance in P450 activity profiles. The table shows the composition of these two components
and the variance explained by each. The first component contains positive contributions from all substrates and can be thought of as representing a
general high catalytic ability. The second component can be thought of as representing discrimination between fused ring substrates (PROP, 2A5C,
and MDOB) and phenolic ether substrates (12-pNCA, 11PA, 2PE). Substrate abbreviations are as defined in the legend to Figure 2. The analysis was
performed on the logarithms of the fold changes in activity.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of changes in activity for
each of the six substrates. The distribution for 12-pNCA
appears to be truncated on the left, as expected since the
P450s neutrally evolved under a requirement to maintain
the ability to hydroxylate 12-pNCA. Some of the P450s
have undergone a mild decrease in 12-pNCA activity,
reflective of the fact that the neutral evolution selection
criterion provided a small amount of latitude by allowing
the total amount of hydroxylated 12-pNCA to drop to
75% of the parental value [16]. A number of P450s have
neutrally evolved 12-pNCA activity that modestly exceeds
that of the parent – again unsurprising, because the parental 12-pNCA activity falls well below the maximal value
achievable for this type of protein [31]. The distribution
for 11PA resembles that for 12-pNCA, probably because
the activities on these two chemically similar substrates
are highly linked, as discussed in the previous section.
This is an example of apparent selection on one activity
due to actual selection on a closely linked activity.
The other four promiscuous activities are less linked to 12pNCA activity, and their distributions are much more
symmetric. The symmetric shapes of these distributions
suggest that neutral genetic drift has sampled from a
roughly Gaussian distribution for these four promiscuous
activities. For three of the substrates (PROP, 2A5C, and
MDOB), the distributions of activities are approximately
centered around the parental activity. This centering indicates that the promiscuous activities of the parent on these
three substrates are typical of what would be expected of a
neutrally evolved P450. The distribution for 2PE, on the
other hand, is shifted towards activities higher than that of
the parent. This shift indicates that the parent is less active

in catalytic ability or shifts in preference for different
broad classes of substrate structures. In this section, we
examine whether there are any pervasive trends in the distributions of activity changes – for example, did most of
the promiscuous activities tend to increase or decrease? If
a property is not under any evolutionary constraint, then
during neutral genetic drift its values might be expected to
be distributed in a roughly Gaussian fashion, as the neutrally evolving proteins freely sample from the presumably normal underlying distribution. On the other hand, if
a property is constrained by selection to remain above a
certain threshold, then during neutral genetic drift its values should display a truncated distribution since selection
culls proteins with values that fall below the threshold
(such a distribution has been predicted for protein stability by simulations [34] and theory [25]). In the case of our
experiments, selection acted explicitly only on 12-pNCA
activity, and changes in the other promiscuous activities
were limited only by the extent that these activities were
affected indirectly by this constraint (an effect termed
"apparent selection" [35]).

on 2PE than a typical neutrally evolved P450, since most
neutral mutations tend to increase this activity.
If the activity distributions of Figure 4 truly reflect what
would be expected after a very long period of neutral
genetic drift (i.e., if they are "equilibrium" distributions),
then each variant represents a random sample from the
underlying distribution of activities among all P450s that
can neutrally evolve under this selection criterion. In this
case, there should be no correlation between the extent of
change in activity and the number of accumulated mutations, since the P450s should have lost all "memory" of
the parent's activity. On the other hand, if there has only
been a small amount of genetic drift, then the neutrally
evolved P450s may maintain activity profiles that are similar to the parent simply because there have not been
enough mutations to alter unselected properties of the
enzyme (such as hydrophobicity properties of the active
site that are not essential for the selected activity, but
influence the promiscuous activities). In this sense, neutral genetic drift can be thought of as analogous to the
equilibration of a physical system, since after a long
period of time an equilibrated physical system will
explore all microstates compatible with external constraints regardless of the initial condition, but after a short
period of time the observed state may still resemble the
initial condition.
In order to determine whether the neutral genetic drift
had proceeded for enough mutations to "equilibrate" the
activity profiles, we examined whether variants with fewer
mutations more closely resembled the parent's activity
profile. Such a resemblance would indicate that the neutral genetic drift had not yet completely eliminated residual memory of the parental activity. We computed the
correlation between the magnitude of each variant's
change in activity and the number of nonsynonymous
mutations it possessed relative to the parent. Table 2
shows that the magnitude of activity change is positively

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

correlated with the number of mutations for all six substrates. Although the correlations for the individual substrates are mostly not statistically significant due to the
small number of samples, the overall correlation for all six
substrates is highly significant (P = 10-3). Therefore, the
P450 activities are still in the process of diverging from the
parental values by neutral genetic drift. If the variants were
to undergo further neutral genetic drift, one would expect
to see even larger changes in their promiscuous activities.
We note that the correlation between activity changes and
number of mutations can be explained either by a model
in which each successive mutation causes a progressively
larger change in promiscuous activity, or by a model in
which variants with more mutations are simply more
likely to have experienced one of a relatively small
number of mutations that lead to large changes in promiscuous activities.
We also examined whether P450 variants with mutations
near the substrate binding pocket were more likely to have
undergone large changes in their activities. Five of the
P450 variants had a mutation to a residue that was within
5 Å of the surrogate substrate in the P450 BM3 crystal
structure [36]: variant M2 had A74V, M8 had A330V, M13
had M354I, M15 had A74P, and M24 had I263V [16].
Two of these mutated residues are of clear importance,
since mutating residue 74 has previously been shown to
shift substrate specificity [29,37,38] and residue 263 plays
a role in the substrate-induced conformational shift [39].
We compared the activity changes for the five variants
with mutations near the binding pocket to those for the
29 variants without any such mutations, computing the
magnitude of activity change as the absolute value of the
logarithm (base two) of the fold change in activity averaged over all six substrates. The average magnitude of
activity change for the five variants with mutations near
the active site was 0.88, while the average for the other 29
variants was 0.47. These averages are significantly different, with an unequal variance T-test P-value of 10-2. Therefore, variants with mutations near the substrate binding
pocket have a higher probability of undergoing large
changes in activity than all other variants, although many
variants without mutations near the pocket also underwent substantial activity changes.

Conclusion
We have shown that neutral genetic drift can lead to
changes of as much as four-fold in the promiscuous activities of P450 proteins. The ubiquity of these changes is
striking – even though many of the neutrally evolved
P450s had only a handful of mutations, most of them had
experienced at least some change in their promiscuous
activities. P450s may be especially prone to this type of
change, since their catalytic mechanism involves large
substrate-induced conformational shifts [40] that can be
modulated by mutations distant from the active site
[32,37,41]. In addition, P450s have a tendency to eventually undergo irreversible inactivation that can be promoted by reduced coupling between substrate binding
and conformational shifts, as well as by other poorly
understood determinants of catalytic stability [19,42,43].
Therefore, the changes in P450 activities that we observed
can be caused by factors that alter the catalytic lifetime of
the enzyme in addition to factors that alter the maximum
catalytic rate. There are thus ample opportunities for
mutations that spread by neutral genetic drift to cause
subtle alterations in a P450's promiscuous activities. But
we believe that neutral genetic drift is also likely to cause
substantial changes in the promiscuous activities of
enzymes with other catalytic mechanisms. In support of
this idea, a recent study by Tawfik and coworkers [44]
indicates that mutations with little effect on the native lactonase activity of serum paraoxonase can alter this
enzyme's promiscuous activities. Taken together, this
study and our work suggest that promiscuous protein
functions can change during neutral genetic drift. These
changes could in turn have important implications for
future functional evolution. For example, one can easily
imagine a scenario in which neutral genetic drift enhances
a promiscuous protein function, and then a subsequent
gene duplication allows natural selection to transform
one of the genes into the template for a protein with a fullfledged new functional role [1-6].
One of the most attractive aspects of our study is the
degree to which the changes in P450 activities during neutral genetic drift could be understood in terms of the
chemical structures of the substrates. Neutral genetic drift
did not simply cause unpredictable shifts in activities.

The extent of change in activity is positively correlated with the number of nonsynonymous mutations the P450 has undergone relative to the
neutral evolution parent. Each column shows the Pearson correlation between the number of nonsynonymous mutations and the absolute value of
the logarithm of the fold change in activity for a different substrate, computed over all 34 P450 variants. The final column (ALL) is the correlation
among the 6 × 34 pooled data points for all six substrates. The P-values are shown in parentheses; none of the correlations for the individual
substrates are significant at a 1% level (due to the small number of data points), but the overall correlation for all substrates is highly significant.
Substrate abbreviations are as defined in the legend to Figure 2.

Instead, most of the variation was explained by two eminently intuitive components: an overall increase or
decrease in catalytic ability, and a preference for either
fused ring or phenolic ether substrates. We have suggested
that neutral genetic drift under a fixed selection criterion
can be viewed as sampling underlying "equilibrium" distributions of activities. The distributions for different
activities are linked, since we have shown that P450s with
good activity on one substrate will frequently also be
highly active on chemically similar substrates (similar
linkages have been observed in proteins created by recombination [45,46]). So while it may be impossible to know
exactly how any specific mutation will affect a given activity, measuring a handful of activities may allow one to
make relatively accurate predictions about other closely
linked activities [47]. The prerequisite for making such
predictions is an understanding of the linkages among
activities in the set of sequences explored by neutral
genetic drift. We have made the first steps in elucidating
these linkages for P450s that have neutrally evolved under
one specific selection regime. The linkages are very similar
to those that would have been made by an organic chemist grouping the substrates on the basis of their chemical
structures. Knowledge of these linkages is of use in understanding the origins of enzyme specificity [10,48] – if an
enzyme displays high activity on one substrate but low
activity on another, then either these two activities are
negatively linked during neutral genetic drift or selection
has explicitly disfavored one of them.
Our work also has implications for the general relationship between neutral genetic drift and adaptive evolution
[49-54]. A number of studies focused on RNA [50-52] or
computational systems [53,54] have suggested that
genetic drift might aid in adaptive evolution. Our study
and that of Tawfik and coworkers [44] support this notion
for the evolution of new protein functions. However, the
way that drift in promiscuous functions promotes adaptive evolution is slightly different than the paradigm proposed for RNA [50-52] and computational systems
[53,54]. In those systems, neutral genetic drift is envisioned as allowing a sequence to move along its neutral
network until it reaches a position where it can jump to a
new higher-fitness and non-overlapping neutral network.
In contrast, promiscuous protein functions change even as
a protein drifts along a single neutral network. The adaptive benefits of this drift come when new selective pressures suddenly favor a previously irrelevant promiscuous
function, in effect creating a new neutral network that
overlaps with parts of the old one.
Overall, experiments have now demonstrated two clear
mechanisms by which neutral genetic drift can aid in the
evolution of protein functions. In the first mechanism,
neutral genetic drift fixes a mutation that increases a pro-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

tein's stability [24,25,55], thereby improving the protein's
tolerance for subsequent mutations [26-28], some of
which may confer new or improved functions [28]. In the
second mechanism, which was the focus of this work and
the recent study by Tawfik and coworkers [44], neutral
genetic drift enhances a promiscuous protein function.
This enhancement poises the protein to undergo adaptive
evolution should a change in selection pressures make the
promiscuous function beneficial at some point in the
future.

Methods
Determination of P450 activities
We attempted to determine the activities of all 44 neutrally evolved P450 variants described in [16] (22 from
the final monomorphic populations and 22 from the final
polymorphic population). Ten of these variants expressed
poorly in the procedure used here (as described in more
detail below), and so were eliminated from further analysis since their low expression led to large errors in the
activity measurements. That left activity data for the 34
neutrally evolved P450 variants listed in Figures 2 and 3,
as well as for the R1-11 neutral evolution parent. The
activities for each of these P450 variants were measured
on all six substrates (12-pNCA, 2PE, PROP, 11PA, 2A5C,
and MDOB). In all cases, the activities represent the total
amount of product produced after two hours, and so are
proportional to total substrate turnovers per enzyme.
P450 BM3 enzymes typically catalyze only a finite
number of reaction cycles before becoming irreversibly
inactivated, and we believe that all reactions were essentially complete after two hours, so these activities should
represent the total turnovers of the enzymes during their
catalytic lifetimes.

To obtain P450 protein for the activity measurements, we
expressed the protein using catalase-free Escherichia coli
[56] containing the encoding gene on the isopropyl β-Dthiogalactoside (IPTG) inducible pCWori [56] plasmid
(the catalase is removed since it breaks down the hydrogen peroxide used by the P450). The sequences of the
P450 variants are detailed in [16]. We used freshly
streaked cells to inoculate 2 ml cultures of Luria Broth
(LB) supplemented with 100 µg/ml of ampicillin, and
grew these starter cultures overnight with shaking at 37°C.
We then used 0.5 ml from these starter cultures to inoculate 1 L flasks containing 200 ml of terrific broth (TB) supplemented with 100 µg/ml of ampicillin. The TB cultures
were grown at 30°C and 210 rpm until they reached an
optical density at 600 nm of ≈0.9, at which point IPTG
and δ-aminolevulinic acid were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM each. The cultures were grown for an
additional 19 hours, then the cells were harvested by pelletting 50 ml aliquots at 5,500 g and 4°C for 10 min, and
stored at -20°C. To obtain clarified lysate, each pellet was

Page 8 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

resuspended in 8 ml of 100 mM [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazinepropanesulfonic acid] (EPPS), pH 8.2 and
lysed by sonication, while being kept on ice. The cell
debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 g and 4°C
for 10 minutes, and the clarified lysate was decanted and
kept on ice.
To perform the assays, various dilutions of the clarified
lysate were used to construct a standard curve. For each
sample, we prepared dilutions of the clarified lysate in the
100 mM EPPS (pH 8.2) buffer to create samples for the
standard curves. The dilutions were 100% clarified lysate
(undiluted), 67% lysate, 40% lysate, 25% lysate, 17%
lysate, 10% lysate, 6.7% lysate, and 4.0% lysate. Similar
dilutions were also prepared of the clarified lysate of E. coli
cells carrying a null pCWori plasmid in order to assess the
background readings from lysate without any P450. A
pipetting robot was then used to dispense 80 µl of this
series of clarified lysate dilutions into 96-well microtiter
plates. Duplicate microtiter plates were then assayed for
P450 concentration and total enzymatic activity on each
of the six substrates. The R1-11 parent was assayed four
times rather than in duplicate, with the replicates labeled
A and B and those labeled C and D in Additional file 2
coming from two different protein expression cultures
and lysis replicates. To minimize variation, all of these
assays were performed in parallel, with the same stock
solutions, and on the same day.
The P450 concentration was determined using the carbon
monoxide (CO) difference spectrum assay [57]. Immediately before use, we prepared a 5× stock solution of 50
mM sodium hydrosulfite in 1.3 M potassium phosphate,
pH 8.0. A multichannel pipette was used to add 20 µl of
this stock solution to each well of the microtiter plates
(which contained 80 µl of a dilution of clarified lysate), so
that the final sodium hydrosulfite concentration was 10
mM in each well. The plates were briefly mixed and the
absorbances were read at 450 and 490 nm. The plates
were then incubated in a CO binding oven [57] for 10
minutes to bind CO to the iron. The absorbance was then
again read at 450 and 490 nm. The amount of P450 is proportional to the increase in the magnitude of the absorbance at 450 nm minus the absorbance at 490 nm. At each
dilution along the standard curve, the reading for the null
control (lysate dilutions without P450) was subtracted
from the reading for each P450 variant to control for clarified lysate background. Additional file 2 shows the standard curves for all P450 variants. Ten P450 variants had
standard curve slopes less than or equal to 0.020, indicating a low P450 concentration. These were the ten P450
variants that we discarded from further analysis, since the
low P450 concentration decreased the accuracy of the
measurements.

To determine the activity on 12-pNCA, we monitored the
formation of the yellow 4-nitrophenolate compound that
is released upon hydroxylation of the twelfth carbon in
the 12-pNCA molecule [31,58]. Immediately before use,
we prepared a 6× stock solution of 12-pNCA by adding
3.6 parts of 4.17 mM 12-pNCA in DMSO to 6.4 parts 100
mM EPPS, pH 8.2. A multichannel pipette was used to
add 20 µl of this stock solution to each well of the microtiter plates (which contained 80 µl of a dilution of clarified lysate). The plates were briefly mixed, and the
absorbance was read at 398 nm. To initiate the reactions,
we then prepared a 6× stock solution of 24 mM hydrogen
peroxide in 100 mM EPPS, pH 8.2, and immediately
added 20 µl of this solution to each well of the microtiter
plate and mixed. The final assay conditions were therefore
6% DMSO, 250 µM 12-pNCA, and 4 mM hydrogen peroxide. The reactions were incubated on the benchtop for
two hours, and the total amount of enzymatic product
was quantified by the gain in absorbance at 398 nm. At
each dilution along the standard curve, the corresponding
null control lysate dilution was subtracted from the reading to control for lysate background. Additional file 2
shows the standard curves for all P450 variants.
The activities on 2PE, PROP, 11PA, 2A5C, and MDOB
were determined using the 4-aminoantipyrene (4-AAP)
assay [59,60], which detects the formation of phenolic
compounds. For each of these five substrates, immediately before use we prepared a 6× substrate stock solution.
These stock solutions were 6% DMSO and 6% acetone in
100 mM EPPS, pH 8.2, with an amount of substrate added
so that the substrate concentrations in the stock solutions
were: 150 mM for 2PE, 30 mM for propranolol, 5 mM for
11PA, 12 mM for 2A5C, and 120 mM for MDOB. The
stock solutions were prepared by first dissolving the substrate in the DMSO and acetone, and then adding the
EPPS buffer. In some cases, the stock solution became
cloudy upon addition of the buffer, but there was no
immediate precipitation, so we could still pipette the
stock solution. A multichannel pipette was used to add 20
µl of the appropriate substrate stock solution to each well
of the microtiter plates (which contained 80 µl of a dilution of clarified lysate). To initiate the reactions, we then
added 20 µl of the freshly prepared 6× hydrogen peroxide
stock solution (24 mM hydrogen peroxide in 100 mM
EPPS, pH 8.2) and mixed. We incubated the plates on the
benchtop for two hours. To detect the formation of phenolic products, a pipetting robot was used to add and mix
120 µl of quench buffer (4 M urea in 100 mM sodium
hydroxide) to each well. We then used the robot to add
and mix 36 µl per well of 0.6% (w/v) of 4-aminoantipyrene in distilled water, and immediately read the
absorbance at 500 nm. To catalyze formation of the red
compound produced by coupling a phenolic compound
to 4-aminoantipyrene [59,60], we then used the pipetting

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

robot to add and mix 36 µl per well of 0.6% (w/v) of
potassium peroxodisulfate in distilled water. The plates
were incubated on the benchtop for 30 minutes, and the
amount of product was quantified by the gain in absorbance at 500 nm. At each dilution along the standard curve,
the corresponding null control lysate dilution was subtracted from the reading to control for lysate background.
Additional file 2 show the standard curves for all P450
variants.
In order to extract enzymatic activities from the standard
curves, we fit lines to the data points. For some of the substrates (most notably 12-pNCA and 2PE), many of the
P450 variants were sufficiently active to either saturate the
substrate or exceed the linear range of absorbance readings. Therefore, we examined each standard curve by eye
to determine which points remained in the linear range.
Lines were then fit to the points in the linear range. These
fits are shown in Additional file 2. In the plots in this file,
all points that were deemed to fall in the linear range (and
so were used for the fits) are shown as filled shapes, while
all points that were deemed to fall outside the linear range
(and so were not used in the fits) are shown as empty
shapes. The figures show the slopes of the lines for all replicates (two replicates for all P450 variants except for R111, which had four replicates). These slopes are averaged
for a best estimate of the slope, and the standard error
computed over these two measurements is also reported.
To compare the activities (total substrate turnovers per
enzyme) among the different P450 variants, it is first necessary to normalize to the enzyme concentration. To do
this, we took the ratio of the slope for each substrate
divided by the slope of the CO different spectrum, propagating the errors. These normalized slopes are proportional to the activity on each substrate. The normalized
slopes are given in Additional file 3. This file also lists the
number of nonsynonymous mutations that each P450
variant possesses relative to the R1-11 parent sequence, as
originally reported in [16]. These normalized slopes allow
for accurate comparisons among the P450 variants, and
were used in the analyses in this paper. To convert these
normalized slopes into total substrate turnovers per
enzyme, it is necessary to multiply them by the ratio of
extinction coefficients. The extinction coefficient for the
CO difference spectrum reading (the absorbance at 450
nm minus that at 490 nm) is 91 mM-1 cm-1 [57], and we
calculated the extinction coefficient at 398 nm for the 4nitrophenolate group in our buffer to be 12,000 M-1 cm-1.
Therefore, for 12-pNCA, the total number of substrate
turnovers per P450 enzyme is 7.58 times the ratio of the
12-pNCA standard curve slope to the CO difference spectrum slope. This indicates that our parent protein had
about 250 12-pNCA turnovers per enzyme, compared to
the 1,000 reported for a variant engineered for maximal

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

12-pNCA activity [31]. For the other substrates assayed
with the 4-AAP assay, the extinction coefficient at 500 nm
for the 4-AAP/phenol complex has been reported to be
4,800 [60]. However, we believe that this extinction coefficient could be of dubious accuracy for our data. Depending on the exact type of phenolic compound created by
P450 hydroxylation, the extinction coefficient for the 4AAP/phenol complex may vary. Assuming the extinction
coefficient of 4,800 M-1 cm-1 is accurate, then the total
number of substrate turnovers per P450 enzyme is 19.0
times the ratio of the substrate standard curve slope to the
CO difference spectrum slope. Using this coefficient, the
parent P450 had roughly 1,000 turnovers on 2PE, 30 turnovers on PROP, 400 turnovers on 11PA, 50 turnovers on
2A5C, and 80 turnovers on MDOB. The high activities on
2PE and 11PA are presumably due to the fact that lack of
polar substituents on the aromatic ring allows these compounds to enter the hydrophobic P450 BM3 binding
pocket [36] more easily than 12-pNCA. However, we
emphasize that the exact numerical values for the turnovers for these five substrates are questionable. Definitive
determination of the extinction coefficients would require
analytical analysis of the enzymatic products for each
P450 variant on each substrate, which is beyond the scope
of this study.
Analysis of activity data
The raw activity values computed for the P450 variants are
listed in Additional file 3. To analyze and display this
data, we computed the fold change in activity of each variant relative to the R1-11 parent P450. The fold change is
simply the variant activity divided by the parent activity
on each substrate, with the standard errors propagated to
give an error on the fold change. In Figures 2 and 3, these
fold changes are displayed on a logarithmic scale so that
each unit corresponds to a two-fold increase or decrease in
activity. In Figure 2, the substrates and the P450 variants
have both been clustered, as shown by dendrograms on
the side of the heat map. The clustering was performed
using the standard hierarchical clustering function of the
R statistical package. This is complete linkage hierarchical
clustering, with the distances computed as the Euclidian
distance between the logarithms of the fold changes in
activity. The standard errors on the fold changes in activity
are not incorporated into Figure 2 or any of the related
analysis. However, these standard errors are shown in Figure 3; it is apparent from this figure that the errors tend to
be much less than the fold changes in activity themselves.

In Figure 4, the histogram bins are logarithmically spaced
so that each bin contains a 20.5-fold range of activities. For
example, the histogram bin centered at one contains all
variants with between 2-0.25 = 0.84 and 20.25 = 1.19 fold the
parental activity, while the bin centered at 1.5 contains all

Page 10 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

variants with between 20.25 = 1.19 and 20.75 = 1.68 fold the
parental activity.
The principal component analysis shown in Table 1 was
performed using the R statistical package, with inputs
being the logarithms of the fold changes in activity. Since
these log fold changes in activity contained no arbitrary
units (they were already normalized to the parent), the
data was neither scaled nor zeroed before performing the
analysis. Table 1 shows the composition and the percent
of variance explained (the eigenvalue for that component
divided by the sum of all eigenvalues) for the first two
components. The remaining four components were relatively unimportant, explaining 7%, 5%, 4%, and 2% of
the total variance.
Variability in experimental measurements
Figures 2 and 3 show the changes in activity for each of the
34 neutrally evolved P450s. The data in this figure are the
mean of two separate measurements performed on protein samples from the same preparation of expressed and
lysed protein. Each of the two measurements involves
independent determination of the P450 concentration
and the enzymatic activity via the standard curves shown
in Additional file 2. The two measurements are not fully
independent biological replicates, since they come from
the same preparation of protein. However, expression and
lysis typically introduces variability in measurements due
to differing concentrations of protein, and since each of
the two measurements independently determines P450
concentration, they should correct for most of the variation induced by expression and lysis. To confirm this fact,
and to obtain a more detailed characterization of the variability in the readings, we performed measurements on
different preparations of the R1-11 parent protein. Overall, we used protein from four separate expression/lysis
preparations of this protein. For each of these preparations, we performed two separate measurements of P450
concentration and activity. The resulting data are shown
in the plots of Additional file 4, which is scaled so that it
can be directly compared to Figure 3. The plots of Additional file 4 demonstrate that the variability in measurements on samples from different expression/lysis
preparations is no larger than the variability between
measurements from the same preparation. This confirms
that the independent determination of P450 concentration for each measurement adequately controls for any
differences between expression/lysis preparations. Additional file 4 also demonstrates that the overall variability
in repeated measurements on the parent sample is small
compared to the difference between samples, and is adequately captured by the error bars shown in Figure 3. So
overall, while repeated measurements on the same sample
do show a small amount of variability, this variability is
smaller than the typical differences between different

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

P450 variants, and is adequately captured by the duplicate
measurements from the same preparation of protein that
were used in this study.
Phylogenetic tree
The phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1 is based on the
number of nonsynonymous mutations the P450 variants
have relative to the R-11 neutral evolution parent. Each of
the P450s that evolved in a monomorphic population
(prefix of M) are known to have diverged independently,
and so are drawn on their own branch regardless of any
sequence identity to other variants. The exact phylogenetic relationship of the P450s that evolved in the polymorphic population (prefix of P) is not known, so the
portion of the tree for these mutants was reconstructed by
maximum parsimony. The tree is based only on the nonsynonymous mutations, and all mutations weighted
equally. Full nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the
P450s are given in Additional file 1.

The manuscript by Bloom et al presents experimental data
to show how neutral evolution can explore phenotype
space and help in adaptation, adding a new answer to
Sewall Wright's question to Kimura about the potential
"future" benefit of neutral evolution [61]. They show that
the proteins that are more or less equivalent with respect
to their primary function, and that are connected through
a neutral path, vary with respect to their ability to perform
"other", promiscuous functions for which there has been
no selection. The manuscript is well written, the results
speak for themselves, the arguments are sound, and I do
not have much to add. I should comment that I am not an
experimentalist, and can therefore not judge the experimental results in detail.
Authors' response
We thank the reviewer for the paragraph putting the manuscript in this context of Wright's question to Kimura.

Specific questions:
Can the "four-fold" change in the promiscuous activities
be put into perspective? How does this e.g. compare to the
activity of a protein that has specifically been selected for
any of the tested functions?

Page 11 of 19

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

Authors' response
This is an excellent question. The short answer (which is now
briefly mentioned in the main text) is that studies selecting for
improvement P450 BM3 activities that have not previously
been the target of selection tend to report increases of 10- to 40fold. As a caveat, we note that none of these studies exactly parallel the experimental methodology used here. One study that
selected for high P450 peroxygenase activity on the substrate
12-pNCA increased the total substrate turnovers 11-fold with
9 amino acid mutations (not all 9 mutations necessarily contributed to the improved activity; some may have "hitchhiked"
along) [31]. A study beginning with the P450 BM3 holoenzyme increased the maximal rate of octane hydroxylation 38fold with 9 amino acid mutations [32]. Another study beginning with a P450 holoenzyme variant increased the number of
turnovers of propane hydroxylation 12-fold with a dozen amino
acid mutations [33].

Can the variation in catalytic activity also be explained as
a variation in enzyme catalytic lifetimes?
Authors' response
Yes! By measuring total substrate turnovers, we are essentially
measuring the product of the catalytic rate times the catalytic
lifetime. P450s are known to have finite catalytic lifetimes that
depend on the degree of coupling between substrate binding and
the conformational shifts associated with the enzyme catalytic
cycle. So mutations could affect the catalytic rate, the overall
catalytic lifetime of the protein, or the catalytic lifetime of the
protein on a particular substrate due to the degree of coupling
between binding to that substrate and conformational changes.
The fact that the total substrate turnovers depend on this entire
set of protein properties is probably the reason why so many different mutations influence activity.

Is it possible to separate the two effects of the mutations
on the activity (substrate specificity versus "overall" catalytic activity) by where those mutations occurred in the
protein, like you do in the last paragraph of the Results
section by averaging the effects of the mutations for all 6
substrates?
Authors' response
Unfortunately, we do not believe that it is possible to convincingly make such a separation. The reason is that P450 is a very
dynamic enzyme that undergoes large conformational changes
during its catalytic cycles – indeed, the exact structure of the
catalytically active form is not even known (the substrate position in the crystal structure conformation is thought to place the
substrate several angstroms too far from the iron for catalysis).
Therefore, mutations that are distant from the active site have
on occasion been shown to affect substrate specificity. So there
is no clear basis for predicting which mutations contribute more
to overall activity versus specificity.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

Fourth paragraph of the "Overall distributions of change
in the activities" in Results: "On the other hand if there
has not been enough neutral genetic drift etc." Could you
change that sentence in one way or another such that it
becomes clearer what is what relative to what? e.g. "On
the other hand if there has not been enough neutral
genetic drift after a few mutations to completely eliminate
etc."
Authors' response
We have clarified this point. There are some properties of the
protein that are not essential for the selected activity but that
influence the promiscuous activities. Neutral genetic drift will
tend to change these properties, and after some number of
mutations the properties will have changed enough that they
are no longer correlated with the properties of the evolutionary
parent more than would be expected for any two random proteins that satisfied the selection criterion. Our original meaning
was that there had been "enough" mutations that this correlation was gone. In analogy with physics, this would occur when
the autocorrelation function had decayed to zero. In any case,
we have rewritten the relevant sentences to make clear that
"enough" means that the correlation between the parental and
neutrally evolved proteins is no larger than between a random
pair of proteins that satisfy the selection criterion.

Investigations and descriptions of fitness ridges (a fitness
ridge is a function relating fitness and genotype) are necessarily difficult and confusing due to the complex and
often multidimensional nature of such ridges. Thus, it is
truly remarkable that in the recent past several studies
have attempted to describe the shapes of fitness ridges one
gene at a time. The present study is one of them. The
authors study the effects of mutations on several promiscuous functions that have been selected for not ruining
the activity of a related but distinct function. Indeed,
under laboratory conditions the mutations that are
allowed to propagate are neutral by definition, and the
authors in essence studied the effect of mutations accumulated by drift. However, I do not think that the main
claim of this paper, that "drift can aid functional protein
evolution" is appropriate and I believe that the results are
much more important to the study of fitness ridges than
to the study of the impact of neutral drift.

Assuming a starting condition of such neutral evolution
when the activity of promiscuous functions truly bears no
fitness effects, consider the impact of the past several
mutations right before this activity became a target of
selection. In an equilibrium setting, those mutations are
equally likely to have decreased the level of the activity as
they are to have lead to an increase. Therefore, the paper
could have been titled "drift can inhibit functional pro-

tein evolution" just as well. Regardless, I think that the
impact of such an artificially neutral mutation on future
adaptations is not the issue here. Just as with the original
work by Aharoni et al. [2], the issue is the degree of pleiotropic interactions of different functions that can be performed by a single protein because understanding the
nature of such interactions is crucial for our understanding of fitness ridges.
Authors' response
The reviewer raises two main points. The first point is that neutral genetic drift can both increase and decrease promiscuous
functions. The reviewer therefore argues that the original title
of our manuscript, "Neutral genetic drift can aid functional
protein evolution," was misleading since this drift can also
decrease promiscuous functions. We did not intend for this title
to convey the idea that genetic drift always increases promiscuous functions. Rather, we meant that such drift will in some
cases increase promiscuous functions, and that these increases
can aid functional evolution if there is subsequently selective
pressure that favors an enhanced promiscuous function. Essentially, genetic drift is increasing the overall variance in promiscuous functions – something that will be beneficial for
functional evolution if subsequent selection amplifies those variants with enhanced function. To better convey this idea we
have now changed the title of the paper to "Neutral genetic drift
can alter promiscuous protein functions, potentially aiding
functional evolution." The reviewer's second major point is that
our work can be interpreted in terms of fitness landscapes rather
than in terms of neutral genetic drift. We have added a text
mentioning how our work sheds light on some of the underlying
relationships among different protein functions in the fitness
landscape. The reviewer also suggests that we interpret our
results in terms of "fitness ridges" rather than "neutral drift" on
"neutral networks." Essentially, a fitness ridge [23]is a connected set of high fitness genotypes. When all genotypes are
classified as either functional or nonfunctional (as in our experiments), a fitness ridge is the same as a neutral network because
selection does not distinguish between points on the ridge of different heights. We now explain this in the text. However, in our
experiments we do not know the true fitness function for P450
BM3 enzymes evolving in nature (this would require full
knowledge of the complex interactions among the protein, the
bacteria's metabolism, and a potentially fluctuating environment), and so we cannot confidently map our measurements of
P450 enzymatic activities to the fitness landscape. Therefore, in
our evolution experiments we defined a simplified fitness function in which P450s are "functional" if their activity on 12pNCA exceeds a threshold, and "nonfunctional" otherwise.
This is clearly not the real natural fitness function, but it provided an abstraction of the basic idea that enzymatic activity
must meet some minimal threshold for bacterial viability. In the
context of our experiments, we therefore feel that neutral networks and neutral drift provide an appropriate description of
the types of mutations that have occurred. The reviewer is none-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

theless correct that it might also be possible to use our results to
map features of the P450 fitness landscape; although we do not
attempt this interpretation ourselves, we have provided the full
raw data from our experiments in case others are interested in
doing so.
The work Aharoni et al. [2] suggested that if a new previously unused function is suddenly placed under the spotlight of selection, such new functions can be found (and
substantially improved) in proteins that are already are
doing something else. The present work strongly supports
this assertion. The authors also found that the effect of
mutations on the original function is correlated to the
level of similarity of the promiscuous functions. This
observation adds a very interesting and counter intuitive
caveat: if the activity of the native function cannot be
altered, selection has a better chance improving those
functions of a gene that are more different from the original function. Obviously life is not this simple and there
must be a limit to how much a promiscuous function can
differ from the original. However, evolutionary examples
of enzyme recruitment in the vertebrate eye lens or the
evolution of antifreeze proteins have already given the
proof of concept that novel functions can evolve from
seemingly inappropriate genes.
Authors' response
We thank the reviewer for the observations contained in this
paragraph, and have added some of them to the text of the manuscript.

Secondary comments: Second paragraph of Background
section. I disagree that it is clear that only a small fraction
of mutations in proteins are adaptive. For an example see:
Andolfatto P. Adaptive evolution of non-coding DNA in
Drosophila. Nature. 2005 Oct 20;437(7062):1149-52.
Authors' response
We have rephrased the offending passage. We did not intend to
suggest that most natural mutations are necessarily due to neutral genetic drift, since we recognize that this is a hotly debated
topic. Instead, we simply meant that most mutations are not
driven by selective pressure for an entirely new function, since
the basic biochemical functions of most proteins are relatively
stable over long periods of evolutionary time even as many
mutations accumulate (as pointed out by Zuckerkandl and
Pauling [13]and many subsequent studies). It is of course hard
to discern whether these mutations are due to neutral genetic
drift or some more subtle selection pressure not due to a wholesale change in protein function (as suggested by [15]). In any
case, we have toned down the relevant passage to merely convey
the idea that proteins accumulate many mutations that are
either due to genetic drift or very subtle selection pressures unrelated to evolution of an entirely new function.

I think that one of the first papers on the impact of neutral
mutations for future adaptations has been: Lipman DJ,
Wilbur WJ. Modelling neutral and selective evolution of
protein folding. Proc Biol Sci. 1991 Jul 22;245(1312):7–
11.
Authors' response
We thank the reviewer for bringing this reference, which is
based on computational lattice models of proteins, to our attention. It is now cited in our work.

First paragraph of "Overall distributions of change in the
activities" section of Results: Another factor that may
greatly affect whether or not mutations that change a promiscuous function are at equilibrium is whether or not
there is selection against such function. Perhaps such
selection is expected, because a promiscuous function
may act as a competitive inhibitor of the original one. The
possibility of such selection is another reason why I think
that although in the laboratory these mutations are by
definition neutral, we must first study the fitness function
of these proteins before investigating the importance of
drift.
Authors' response
We agree with the reviewer that in a natural setting there may
be selection against some promiscuous functions, and we now
mention this possibility in the text. However, due to the limitations of what is realistically possible to accomplish in the laboratory, we are not in a position to determine the natural fitness
function for P450 enzymes. The reason is that while it is possible to accurately measure enzymatic activities as we have done
in this paper, we do not have the capability of directly measuring how these changes in activity would affect the fitness of an
organism in a natural setting.

First and second paragraphs of "Overall distributions of
change in the activities" section of Results: When selection
on one phenotype causes a change in another, this is
called "apparent selection."
Authors' response
We thank the reviewer for pointing out the correct term for this
phenomenon; we now use this term at the relevant point in the
text.

Third paragraph of Conclusions: "The adaptive benefits of
this drift come when new selective pressures suddenly
favor a previously irrelevant promiscuous function, in
effect creating a new neutral network that overlaps with
parts of the old one." If a new selective pressure appeared,
it changed the neutral network to a ridge. In general I
think that the term "neutral network" should be avoided
because it describes a specific model where each mutation
is either lethal or neutral. This is exactly replicated in this

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

experimental setup, however, as soon as adaptive selection comes into play the "neutral network" model
becomes insufficient to describe either the fitness states of
each genotype or the evolutionary processes that follow.
In general, the term "fitness ridge" or "fitness landscape"
is preferable for this reason.
Authors' response
This point is addressed to some degree in previous responses to
the reviewer's comments. Essentially, we have now comment on
the relationship between fitness ridges [3]and neutral networks.
However, we have still retained the term "neutral network" in
the text, since this term is widely used and since we do not know
the true fitness function of P450s (the binary selection of our
experiments map fitness ridges to neutral networks).

I would be interested to see the correlations of the change
of each promiscuous function to that of the native one.
Figure 2 and 3 but with the values showing a correlation.
Just by looking at Fig 2, it seems that every single function
is actually correlated, but it would be interesting to see
how much.
Authors' response
The reviewer is correct that the promiscuous activities are correlated to the native one. However, rather than computing correlation coefficients we have chosen to perform the principal
component analysis shown in Table 2. The reason is that this
sort of analysis better captures the complete relationship among
all six functions, which contains extensive covariances. One
major component of this relationship is indeed the correlation
among all activities. However, another major component of the
relationship is the tendency of the P450 to favor either the phenolic ether or fused ring substrates. These two relationships tend
to obscure each other when analyzed in terms of simple correlation coefficients, so for this reason we prefer the principal component analysis.
Reviewer 3: Dr. Dan S. Tawfik (nominated by Christoph
Adami), Weizmann Institute of Science
Major comments:

1. Outside the context of organismal fitness, neutrality is
obviously hard to define, and even the former is highly
dependent on growth conditions. The limitations of
determining neutrality in an in vitro system should be discussed. These limitations should also be addressed in view
of the fact that P450s are broad range, rather than a 'one
substrate' enzyme. Evidence in favour of 12-pCNA being
a reasonable surrogate of the primary substrate(s) of the
P450 studied here should also be outlined.
Authors' response
This is an excellent comment by the reviewer (some similar
points were also raised by Reviewer 2) that is now addressed in

Page 14 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

more detail in the main text. Quite simply, a limitation of our
study is that we lack a solid basis for connecting the changes we
observe in P450 activity to organismal fitness. We do not know
exactly how a modest change in the activity profile of its P450
enzymes would affect the metabolism of a bacterium living in
an environment with fluctuating concentrations of various substrates. As the reviewer points out, P450s tend to be broad
range, and catalyze multiple reactions in biological settings. In
fact, the primary natural substrates of P450 BM3 are not definitively known, although they are thought to include fatty acids
[19,20]. There is thus no strong basis for believing that 12pNCA is a close surrogate of a primary natural P450 BM3 substrate, and the reviewer is completely correct that natural P450s
are probably not one-substrate enzymes. We therefore make no
claims that the evolutionary changes that we observe in our
studies parallel any specific changes that would be of biological
relevance in natural P450 BM3 evolution. Instead, our study
relates to the more general issue of how different enzyme specificities can evolve – certainly, such evolution is of relevance in
biology, even if we cannot tie our exact choice of substrates to
those that occur in nature. Our choice to define mutations as
"neutral" if they maintain 12-pNCA activity above some
threshold is based on the abstraction that selection in nature
requires specific P450 activities to exceed some minimal value
for viable metabolism. Given this abstraction, we believe our
study sheds valuable light on how promiscuous activities can
change when enzymes are constrained by limits on another primary activity.
2. Being an integral part of the Results section, the
sequence of the studied variants should be provided for
this paper (notwithstanding [16], e.g., in the form of a
table listing all mutations.
Authors' response
We have added a text file as Additional file 1that lists the
mutations of all the neutrally evolved P450 variants as well as
the full sequence of the parent P450.

3. Given the nature of the drift that led to the studied variants, the phrase "any mutations that spread among offspring sequences were therefore by definition due to
neutral drift..." (second paragraph of Results section),
should be supported by showing that the mutations in the
studies variants all largely polymorphic, and none was
enriched/fixated (see also point 2 above).
Authors' response
As mentioned above, we have added a list of all mutations
(Additional file 1). In a few cases, the same mutation occurs
in more than one P450 variant. However, we see no strong evidence of any specific mutation being unusually enriched among
any of the variants. Overall, of the 105 different amino acid
mutations occurring in the set of P450 variants, only twelve
occur in more than one variant. Of these twelve mutations that

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

occur multiple times, six are found mostly in variants from the
polymorphic population that are evolutionarily related on the
phylogenetic tree of Figure 1(for example, P9, P13, and P18
share a common mutation, but are evolutionarily related),
meaning that the multiple occurrences can be explained by neutral spread of a single mutation to several members of the polymorphic population, rather than by repeated occurrence and
fixation of the same mutation. So a visual inspection of the
mutation data does not indicate any glaring trends for the
enrichment of specific mutations. We have not attempted a formal population genetics analysis to see if the frequency distribution of mutations is compatible with the neutral theory (such an
analysis would be complicated by the need to correct for phylogenetic relationships and the fact that error-prone PCR is biased
towards creating certain types of mutations). However, our
inclusion of the full mutational data should allow the reader to
attempt such a population genetic analysis if he/she desires to
do so. In any case, our statement that any mutations are "by
definition due to neutral genetic drift" is simply based on the
fact that the experimental procedure cannot directly favor any
mutation, since all mutants have either equally high or zero fitness.
4. The standard errors refer to two separate measurements
of the activities (legend of Figure 3). However, the Methods section describes a protocol by which a single lysate
was aliquoted to two plates and measured separately
(third paragraph of Methods section). This procedure
hardly reflects the major sources of experimental variability, namely, differences in growth densities and lysis efficiency. Thus, separate measurements should involve
independent growth of two colonies, lysis, and activity
measurements.
Authors' response
This comment is addressed along with comment 5 in the next
response.

5. There is no proper assessment of the likelihood that the
observed variations in the measured activity are simply
due to experimental variations. In other words, data
should be provided to indicate the level of variation
observed in an appropriate set of independent repeats of
the parental protein ("wild-type") grown, lysed, and
assayed for the various activities.
Authors' response
This response addresses the last two comments from the
reviewer (4 and 5). New data and discussion to address these
comments has been added in the form of Additional file 4and
the new Methods section "Variability in experimental measurements." Here we briefly recap this new data and discussion. The
reviewer correctly notes that the duplicate measurements of
activity were performed on P450 from the same expression/lysis
preparation of protein, and so do not constitute full biological

Page 15 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

replicates (which would start with independent single bacterial
colonies). However, most of the variation due to expression/lysis
is due to differences in enzyme concentration in the resulting
lysate. In most high-throughput assays, this is a severe problem
since there is no means for correcting for differences in enzyme
concentration. But in the case of our experiments, for each
measurement we constructed a full standard curve to accurately
determine the P450 concentration as well as the activity (Additional file 2), thereby correcting for any variability in P450
concentration. To demonstrate that these measurements capture the variability between different measurements, we now
describe activity measurements on four separate expression/lysis
preparations of the parental protein (as suggested by comment
5 from the reviewer). These measurements are now shown in
Additional file 4. They show that the variation between different expression/lysis preparations is no larger than the difference
of separate measurements on samples from the same preparation, confirming that the approach we have taken adequately
corrects for most of the experimental variability. The data in
Additional file 4also show that the experimental variability of
repeated measurements on different preparations of parental
protein is small compared to the typical differences among different P450 variants. Overall, these data support the notion
that the error bars in Figure 3, calculated from separate measurements from the same expression/lysis preparation and containing propagated errors from repeated measurements on the
parental protein, are a fair representation of the experimental
variability.
Other comments:
1. One of the questions remaining to be answered concerns the relationship between the level of neutrality that
has to be maintained and the changes and improvements
displayed in the promiscuous activities. This study shows
that the original activity can be maintained while exhibiting changes in promiscuous activity. However, the issue
regarding a possible tradeoff between the two still remains
unknown. It is therefore worthwhile, using the results
from this study, to check if there is any form of association
between the level of 12-pNCA activity, for each variant,
and the tendency to show large deviation in other promiscuous substrates.
Authors' response
The reviewer raises the excellent question of whether the P450s
are able to change their promiscuous activities by large amounts
while still maintaining 12-pNCA activity. To look at this question, we examined the correlation between fold-change in 12pNCA activity and the extent of change (absolute value of the
logarithm of the fold-change in activity) on each of the five promiscuous substrates. The correlations and their P-values are:
0.51 (0.003) for 2PE, -0.07 (0.67) for PROP, 0.29 (0.10)
for 11PA, 0.07 (0.66) for 2A5C, and 0.53 (0.002) for
MDOB. Therefore, only two of the promiscuous substrates (2PE

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

and MDOB) show a significant positive correlation between
12-pNCA activity and the amount of change in promiscuous
activity. However, these correlations do not necessarily indicate
an underlying relationship between 12-pNCA activity and
amount of change in promiscuous activity. The reason is that,
as shown in Table 2, the extent of change in all promiscuous
activities tends to increase with more mutations, and this effect
is largest for 2PE and MDOB. The change in 12-pNCA activity
also increases with the number of mutations (Table 2). Therefore, it seems likely to us that the correlation between 12-pNCA
activity and the change in promiscuous 2PE and MDOB activities is simply due to the fact that changes in all of these activities increase with more mutations. In order to control for this
effect, it would be necessary to look at activity changes in a set
of proteins with roughly the same numbers of mutations. Unfortunately, the iterative nature of the evolution experiments that
we used to create our P450 variants created a large variance in
the number of mutations per variant. Therefore, our study is not
well posed to answer this question more quantitatively. However, we do refer the reader to [44]for a study that is better
designed to answer this question.
2. The relationship between the number of mutations and
the degree of improvement toward promiscuous activities
can be explained also by a probability distribution that
describes the number of successes in a sequence of n
draws from some finite population (e.g. hypergeometric
distribution). For example, assume there is a small set of
residues in P450 that influences protein activity upon
mutation. In such a case, the higher the number of mutations imposed on the protein, the more likely the event
that we randomly pick up one or more of the residues
from that small set. In such a scenario, a large number of
mutations does not form the basis and is not a prerequisite for a change in activity. Rather, it is just related to the
elevating the probability of picking the influential residues by random mutagenesis.
Authors' response
The reviewer is absolutely correct that the correlation between
the number of mutations and the extent of activity is probably
due to the fact that the occurrence of more mutations increases
the chance that one of these mutations is at an influential residue. We believe our interpretation of the data is consistent with
this explanation, and have slightly modified the text to emphasize this point along the lines suggested by the reviewer. However, we do not speculate on the exact distribution of activity
changes caused by random mutations, since there are probably
some highly influential mutations, some moderately influential
ones, and some with essentially no effect.

3. Do the specific clusters of variants shown in figure 2
relate to specific mutation, or a group of specific mutations? Since the number of variants analyzed is relatively

Page 16 of 19

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/17

small, it would be best to add a table showing the genotype of each mutant.

network would be expected to have higher 2-phenoxyethanol
activity.

Authors' response
The clustering of variants in Figure 2is based on their activity
profiles (variants with similar activity profiles are clustered
together). Overall, the sharing of common mutations does not
appear to be a major determinant of these activity profile clusters. The reason is that most variants do not have any mutations
in common (of the 105 different amino acid mutations, only
12 occur in more than one variant). Figure 1captures some of
the mutational clustering of the variants. In a few cases, variants that are evolutionarily related (Figure 1) also cluster
together based on activity (Figure 2), for example P16 and
P22. But there are also cases of variants that share an evolutionary relationship that do not cluster in activity, for example
P8 and P10. We have not done a formal analysis of the relationship between common mutations and activity clustering for
the simple reason that most variants share no common mutations with any other variant, and so cannot be meaningfully
included in such an analysis. We interpret the fact that there
are similarities in activity profiles despite little sharing of common mutations to indicate that many different mutations can
cause similar changes in activity profiles (for example, there are
multiple different mutations that preferentially enhance activity on either phenolic ether or fused ring substrates). In any
case, as suggested by the reviewer, we have now included a table
(Additional file 1) listing the full genotype of each variant.
We also now briefly make reference to this issue in the text.

Comments regarding style:

4. The distribution of 2-phenoxyethanol in Figure 4 is
skewed to the right. The authors mention that it indicates
that the parent is less active on that particular substrate
than a typical neutrally evolved P450. On what grounds is
that claim given? Is there any supporting data on other
neutrally evolved P450 to support that? If not, could it be
that the sequence context of R1-11 promotes improvements towards 2-phenoxyethanol because of some specific position on the neutral network that elevate the
chances of increasing activity against 2-phenoxyethanol?
Authors' response
The only grounds for claiming that the parent is less active on
2-phenoxyethanol than the typical neutrally evolved P450 is the
fact that most of the neutrally evolved P450s had higher 2-phenoxyethanol activity than the parent. There are no supporting
data from other studies (since we know of no similar studies on
P450s). In any case, we believe that saying that the parent is
less active on 2-phenoxyethanol than the typical neutrally
evolved P450 is essentially the same as saying that the parent
occurs on a position of the neutral network that elevates the
changes of increasing activity on 2-phenoxyethanol. That is, if
the parent is at a neutral network position with abnormally low
2-phenoxethanol activity, most nearby sequences on the neutral

1. The term "ask new questions" (last sentence of abstract)
is somewhat colloquial. Wouldn't "favour new functions
or metabolic capabilities" be equally clear?
Authors' response
We have accepted this recommendation, and replaced "ask new
questions" with "favor new functions."

2. Why aren't substrate names abbreviated all along the
article?
Authors' response
We were hoping to minimize the use of confusing abbreviations, but have realized that our mixing of abbreviations and
full names was probably even more confusing. Therefore, we
have accepted the recommendation to abbreviate the substrate
names throughout the article after defining the abbreviations at
their first appearances in the text and in the figures.

3. In the sentence: "Therefore, variants with mutations
near the substrate binding pocket are especially likely to
have altered activities" author may change to: "Therefore,
variants with mutations near the substrate binding pocket
show higher probability of attaining large differences in
activity as compared to all other variants."
Authors' response
We have accepted this recommendation, since it more precisely
conveys the meaning we intended.

4. In the Methods section under the header "phylogenetic
tree" fix the sentence (the word "they" specifically):
"...polymorphic population (prefix of P) is not known so
they portion of the tree for these mutants..."
Authors' response
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error, which we
have corrected.

5. In the legend for Table 1 correct "...phenolic either substrates..." to "phenolic ether substrates."
Authors' response
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error, which we
have corrected.

6. In figure 1, variant P9 is shown to be at the top of a vertical branching line. What does it mean? It is probably
some mistake.

Page 17 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:17

Authors' response
It is actually not a mistake. The horizontal lengths of the
branches indicate the number of accumulated mutations, while
the vertical spacing is arbitrary, and simply chosen to yield a
tree that does not look too crowded. In the specific case of variant P9, P9 shares a common mutation with P18 and P13 but
has only this one mutation while P18 and P13 also have other
mutations. Therefore, P9 should be placed at the point in the
tree at which P18 and P13 diverge. In order to indicate that it
is at this location, the tree-drawing program draws a vertical
branch for P9. The legend explains that the vertical spacing is
arbitrary while the horizontal length is proportional to the
number of accumulated mutations. We see how this could be
somewhat confusing, but it is a standard feature of trees drawn
in this fashion, and we are not sure of a better way to indicate
the position of P9.

Additional file 4
Variability of experimental measurements. The attached PDF file shows
the results of repeated activity measurements performed on the R1-11 parent P450. The plots are scaled so that they can be directly compared to Figure 3 to see how much of observed differences among neutrally evolved
P450 variants might be due to variability in experimental measurements.
Such a comparison indicates that the experimental measurement variability is much less than the differences between P450s. The plots also show
that most of the experimental variation is introduced during the activity
measurements rather than during expression/lysis.
