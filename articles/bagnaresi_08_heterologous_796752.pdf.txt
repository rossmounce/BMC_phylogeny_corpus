Abstract
Background: Since its discovery more than 100 years ago, potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber cold-induced
sweetening (CIS) has been extensively investigated. Several carbohydrate-associated genes would seem to be
involved in the process. However, many uncertainties still exist, as the relative contribution of each gene to the
process is often unclear, possibly as the consequence of the heterogeneity of experimental systems. Some
enzymes associated with CIS, such as β-amylases and invertases, have still to be identified at a sequence level. In
addition, little is known about the early events that trigger CIS and on the involvement/association with CIS of
genes different from carbohydrate-associated genes. Many of these uncertainties could be resolved by profiling
experiments, but no GeneChip is available for the potato, and the production of the potato cDNA spotted array
(TIGR) has recently been discontinued. In order to obtain an overall picture of early transcriptional events
associated with CIS, we investigated whether the commercially-available tomato Affymetrix GeneChip could be
used to identify which potato cold-responsive gene family members should be further studied in detail by RealTime (RT)-PCR (qPCR).
Results: A tomato-potato Global Match File was generated for the interpretation of various aspects of the
heterologous dataset, including the retrieval of best matching potato counterparts and annotation, and the
establishment of a core set of highly homologous genes. Several cold-responsive genes were identified, and their
expression pattern was studied in detail by qPCR over 26 days. We detected biphasic behaviour of mRNA
accumulation for carbohydrate-associated genes and our combined GeneChip-qPCR data identified, at a sequence
level, enzymatic activities such as β-amylases and invertases previously reported as being involved in CIS. The
GeneChip data also unveiled important processes accompanying CIS, such as the induction of redox- and
ethylene-associated genes.
Conclusion: Our Global Match File strategy proved critical for accurately interpretating heterologous datasets,
and suggests that similar approaches may be fruitful for other species. Transcript profiling of early events
associated with CIS revealed a complex network of events involving sugars, redox and hormone signalling which
may be either linked serially or act in parallel. The identification, at a sequence level, of various enzymes long
known as having a role in CIS provides molecular tools for further understanding the phenomenon.

Background
Affymetrix GeneChips have set the standard in terms of
reproducibility, sensitivity and other quality parameters,
even among other oligonucleotide arrays that are usually
the most reputable in terms of reliability compared to
other microarray platforms [1,2]. The array design of
Affymetrix includes multiple probes for each gene and the
presence of mismatch (MM) as well as perfect mach (PM)
probes. These features can be exploited in order to minimize major problems in genome-wide approaches such as
cross-hybridization, background and noise [3]. Unfortunately, plant-related Affymetrix GeneChips are only available for Arabidopsis, sugarcane, tomato, Vitis vinifera,
soybean, rice, poplar, Medicago, cotton, Citrus, maize, and
barley. One possible solution to this limitation would be
to perform unassisted heterologous hybridizations.
Although this approach has not been endorsed by Affymetrix itself, it has nonetheless resulted in some valuable
achievements, e.g. [4]. This is especially true for the plant
kingdom, as the availability of several microarray platforms for A. thaliana has been exploited with several studies addressing close relatives of this model species [[5,6]
and references therein]. However, most researchers refrain
from using heterologous approaches due to the uncertainties in the interpretation of results. To help overcome
these problems, one approach recently developed for the
Affymetrix GeneChip platform is the NASCarrays Xspecies
project, which is based on the preliminary hybridization
to the GeneChip of genomic DNA for the species of interest [7,8]. Here we describe the development of an alternative approach, based on the generation of a list (Global
Match File) where GeneChip target sequences are aligned
to EST-derived clusters/singletons from the species of
interest [TIGR Transcript Assemblies, TIGR TA [9]]. This
means that: (i) any alignment can be assessed among an
available plant GeneChip target sequence and its heterologous counterpart transcript; (ii) an updated and high
quality annotation (based on TIGR TA) can be used for
this transcript; (iii) a subset of "highly reliable" probesets
in the GeneChip species can be generated whose alignments to ESTs of the species of interest are above a threshold and thus can be considered without further
substantial scrutiny.
High-throughput sequencing in recent years has produced
large amounts of EST data. Based on TIGR plant transcript
assemblies (TIGR TA), more than 1,000 ESTs or cDNA
sequences are available for 254 plant species reaching a
sum of 10,974,563 ESTs (Current Release Summary,
update July 2007). Well-known species such as the potato
present a total of 81,072 (26,280 TA plus 54,792 singletons) suggesting a fair transcriptome coverage. In cases of
low sequence representation, which are typical, for example, of wild relatives of crop species, it can be argued that
even transcript profiling of just a few hundred (fully vali-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/176

dated) genes in a species of interest would be cost-effective
when compared to traditional methods. In fact, while fullreliability of expression data in a heterologous approach
would be based on assessing the sequence similarity
between ortholog genes of the two species, a much higher
amount of crude expression data would be available that
would span all genes represented in the GeneChip.
We have chosen the potato as a study organism to query
the tomato GeneChip microarray consisting of 10,038
Solanum lycopersicum probesets representative of over
9,200 genes. In fact, Affymetrix has not yet developed a
potato GeneChip, although spotted cDNA arrays (e.g.
TIGR) have been available for the potato for some time.
However, TIGR Potato cDNA Microarray distribution has
recently been discontinued [10]. Potato and tomato
appear to be suitable for conducting a heterologous
approach as the two Solanaceous species are strictly phylogenetically related [11]. In fact, several groups have concluded that at least for core genes exhibiting significant
sequence homology to the selected solanaceous platform
[e.g. potato or tomato spotted cDNA arrays [11,12]] reliable gene expression values can be obtained. Yet it is
unclear which genes are eligible for the "core" definition,
indicating that a precise validation procedure is required.
Our heterologous approach was conceived as a prerequisite step for investigating a well-known phenomenon,
namely the potato tuber cold-induced sweetening, which
has been studied for more than 120 years since its first
description [13]. Incubating potato tubers at 2–8°C
causes the accumulation of sugars (mainly sucrose, glucose and fructose) at the expense of starch, and is therefore detrimental for tuber quality despite delayed tuber
sprouting [14]. Furthermore, upon cooking, dark, bitter
tasting melanoidins are produced by Maillard reaction
involving reducing sugars (as glucose and fructose) and
free amino acids[15]. In recent years, there has been
increased concern since a specific type of Maillard reaction
involving the amino-acid asparagine (abundant in potato
tubers) and reducing sugars has been shown to produce
the genotoxic and neurotoxic compound acrylamide [15].
Since the discovery of cold sweetening, the various genes
playing a key role in the carbohydrate metabolism from
starch degradation to sucrose synthesis and breakdown
have been investigated [14]. However, the precise contribution of each gene is still unknown and there is no
detailed overall picture of the early events triggering cold
sweetening. This could be in part attributable to the heterogeneity of the systems used (tuber varieties, experimental
settings, etc.) and is an unavoidable drawback of lowthroughput expression profiling techniques that focus on
one or a few genes that code for well-known enzymes.

Some agreement exists on the following early, coldinduced events as being causative/associated with cold
sweetening. At least one amylase activity, demonstrated to
be a β-amylase based on substrate specificity, was visible
very early in iodine-stained zymograms [3-day cold induction at 3°C; [16,17]]. Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS)
underwent a change in kinetic properties and its transcript
was induced in a few days at temperatures of 5–3°C [17].
UDP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) transcript
level was high in developing tubers but an increase was
also evident upon cold incubation of tubers [18]. Also,
specific UGPase isoforms may be associated with
increased susceptibility to cold sweetening [14]. Acid
invertase was observed as playing a critical role in reducing sugar accumulation and its transcripts were found to
be strongly induced after a few days at 4°C; however, the
total amount of invertase activity was found to be solely
related to the hexose/sucrose ratio rather than total reducing sugars [19].

the use of a single, standardized system (i.e. same genotype and experimental settings); (iii) to obtain a crude,
global view of early expression trends for those genes that
are not carbohydrate-associated.

Results and Discussion

In this study, we have explored the feasibility of a heterologous GeneChip approach which we believe should be of
great interest for researchers dealing with species for
which no GeneChip is available. We tested our heterologous approach on potato tuber cold-induced sweetening,
a phenomenon known for over a hundred years and
which is nowadays extremely important as it has been
shown to strongly enhance acrylamide formation in
potato processed products.

The "Global Match File" as an assisting tool for tomato vs.
potato heterologous hybridizations
A Global Match File was generated in order to address the
following issues: (i) considering a given tomato probeset,
which (if any) potato transcript(s) are reliably represented
and what is the quality of this association; (ii) retrieval,
for such a potato transcript, of an updated and high quality annotation (based on TIGR TA); and (iii) generation of
subsets of "highly reliable" probesets whose alignment
scores to potato counterparts are above a tuneable threshold and thus can be considered with confidence. The Global Match File (see additional files 1 and 2) consists of
269,474 alignments (see methods for further details). We
have added several indexes for assessing alignment fidelity among tomato and potato sequences. Table 1 shows
the most relevant parameters contained in the Global
Match File and their intended use. "ALL_90%" and
"ALL_70%" sets are grouped into separate sheets and
include alignments scoring above the 90% and
"70%_PERF_ALIGN" threshold, respectively. As a single
probeset can produce more than one hit, both > 90% and
> 70% sheets are accompanied by a further sheet that lists
non-redundant probesets above the threshold.

Apart from investigating heterologous GeneChip
approaches, our main aims were: (i) to identify early coldresponsive gene family members to be studied in more
detail by qPCR over a 26-d time course; (ii) to obtain an
overall and unifying transcriptional picture of these genes,
including those previously studied, taking advantage of

As the Affymetrix GeneChip target region design procedure [with some exceptions such as Arabidopsis ATH1
GeneChip; [20]] is routinely aimed at 3' ends of mRNA,
we observed homology drops downstream of the stop
codon attributable to lower evolutionary conservation in
3' UTR. Thus, in cases where it is desirable to query low

Various indexes were developed in the Global Match File in order to characterize alignment quality between tomato target and matching potato
counterparts. The most relevant parameters are listed above along with their intended use in terms of assessing alignment quality.

%_PERF_ALIGN values, we developed a further index,
"%_STOP_DIST", (Table 1) allowing to assess the possible presence of a stop in the alignment (see examples in
Table 1). In some cases, however, small stretches of high
homology were further present downstream of the stop
codon, and are listed as additional match lines in the Global Match File.
To summarise, the following use of the Global Match File
is proposed: a tomato probeset of interest can be simultaneously searched for in all the sheets and thus the best
matching potato counterpart and updated annotation can
be determined. If the searched probeset matches the >
90% PERF_ALIGN list, this generally indicates that there
is a high-confidence match to a potato counterpart. Inclusion in the > 70% PERF_ALIGN still indicates fair
sequence similarity, and in most cases this is sufficient for
large-scale analysis. For matches slightly below 70%
PERF_ALIGN further matches between the same probeset
and potato TA should be searched, which may add up to
the desired % PERF_ALIGN value. If no further alignments are revealed, then further cases as described in
Table I should be investigated to see if they apply (intervening stop). Finally, in cases of even lower %
PERF_ALIGN, valuable information can still be obtained
by analyzing identity at a probe level (e.g. Affymetrix
probe match facility) including .cel files in order to disaggregate probeset signals. In this way, signal intensities
associated with perfectly matching probes can be evaluated directly.
Despite these "advanced" procedures to recover specific
genes of interest, the 70%_PERF_ALIGN threshold in our
dataset was satisfactory as 6,690 out of 10,038 probesets
were conserved. In addition, in only rare cases of genes of
special interest, further analysis of low %_PERF_ALIGN
probesets was necessary. The 70%_PERF_ALIGN threshold thus seems a good compromise between the number
of conserved probesets and the fidelity of alignments,
especially in cases of alignment drop due to intervening
stop codons as found in the tomato GeneChip. In any
case, with the higher-confidence threshold of
90%_PERF_ALIGN, 4,893 unique probesets were still
conserved.
Our GeneChip dataset reveals 1,854 differentially
expressed genes (DEG; Additional file 3). In the DEG list,
each probeset is accompanied by the three best matching
potato TAs. For each TA, perfect alignment values, TA
identification number and TA annotation are reported.
Out of the 1,854 DEG, 1,199 and 1,528 are conserved
when filtered at thresholds > 90 and > 70, respectively.

differentially expressed probesets and the intersection

Figure 2 exemplifies how sequence mismatches affect
GeneChip signal intensities at the level of single probes
within probesets. SPS (Probeset Les.3522.1.S1_at; potato
counterpart TA26174_4113; 2.96 fold induction) is listed
in the 70% group (79% %_PERF_ALIGN value) but a further, high similarity region is present towards the 3' region
(16% %_PERF_ALIGN) making a 95% total
%_PERF_ALIGN score. As a general trend, probes with
100% match to potato sequences (1, 2, 4, 6 and 10) or just
one peripheral mismatch towards 5' or 3' extremities (3, 7

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/176

and 8) showed the highest differences in cold vs. control
datasets. The fact that probes 100% identical to potato
sequences showed different absolute intensities is not surprising as various sequence-specific phenomena, including probe GC % composition, cross-hybridization and
interference with mismatch (MM) probes are known to
alter absolute hybridization efficiencies [3]. However,
those differences are strongly mitigated when the intensity
ratios between stress vs. control dataset rather than absolute values are compared. On the other hand, probes with

TA26174_4113; 2.96 fold induction) is shown as an example. The figure was generated as follows: based on the Global Match
File, potato SPS (Transcript Assembly TA26174_4113) best aligns to the target sequence of probeset Les.3522.1.S1_at. Thus,
the 11 probes (perfect match probes, PM) associated with this probeset (on the left, upper sequences) were aligned to
TA26174_4113. The 25 nt-long potato subsequences that align to tomato probes are reported below the tomato probe
sequences, numbered from 1 to 11. Mismatches are highlighted in red. Red and blue bars represent signal intensities associated
with perfect match and mismatch probes, respectively. Similar intensities were obtained for the two biological replicates of
control and cold conditions, but for the sake of clarity only one of the two GeneChip replicates is shown.

central mismatches and/or more than one mismatch (5, 9
and 11) tended to exhibit severely altered signals and signal ratios. Only multiple or central mismatches affecting
central probe regions dramatically altered signal detection
(probes 9 and 11).
One of the many uses of the Global Match File is that keyword searches can immediately provide hits and related
alignments pointing to probesets of interest. These are
especially valuable as GeneChip tomato default annotations may be substantially less informative and/or
updated. In these keyword searches, the > 90 and > 70 lists
are particularly useful when a narrowing down of hits to
best alignments is desired.
Overall, the Global Match File proved efficient in identifying reliable potato counterparts. In fact, by filtering out
matches below 70 %_PERF_ALIGN, no discrepancies
could be found in up-regulation vs. down-regulation calls
in the 11 genes further tested by qPCR (see also Fig 3).
However, as discussed in the next section, in several cases
GeneChip fold induction was less than that measured by
qPCR.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/176

GeneChip vs. qPCR Data
Possibly as a consequence of mismatches between querying vs. target sequences, we noticed that GeneChip fold
induction estimates compared better to qPCR data in
cases of high "Max Signal" index. This parameter is equal
to the maximum average chip signal (both in the control
and cold-treatment chip datasets) and was chosen to
roughly estimate overall transcript abundance.

In rare or less-abundant transcripts, fold-induction magnitudes appeared to be underestimated by GeneChip
dataset. This is shown in Figure 3, where the GeneChip to
qPCR fold induction ratio is plotted versus Max Signal
parameters. This was taken into account when interpreting our GeneChip dataset and should possibly be considered in heterologous GeneChip approaches. Thus, it is
likely that a disturbance factor inherent in the heterologous approach is a generalized lowering of the Max Signal
parameter, which in turn may affect fold induction estimates in some extreme cases.

as measured by GeneChip dataset and qPCR are plotted as percentage values against "Max Signal" values, which represent the
highest average GeneChip signals, both in the control and cold-stressed dataset.

Cold-associated genes
The first step in assessing the reliability of the heterologous GeneChip approach was to verify the up-regulation
of known cold-inducible genes. It has been shown that
cold can result in the induction of a broad spectrum of
Heat-Shock genes [21,22]. In fact, several genes of this
class were highly induced following a 4-day incubation at
4°C (Table 2). Table 3 details further known cold-responsive genes in our dataset, including dehydrin-class genes
[23,24], Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase [25], alternative oxidase and plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein [26],
omega-3 fatty acid desaturases [27], temperature-induced
lipocalin, and various entries belonging to the class of
Late Embryogenesis Abundant proteins (LEA) [28,29].

In addition to the above genes, a widespread reaction to
chilling stimuli in plants is the accumulation of sugars, as
they can act like compatible solutes fulfilling an osmoprotective role [30-32]. Enhanced mRNA levels for carbohydrate-associated genes accompany sugar increases [30], as
confirmed in our GeneChip dataset and further ascertained by qPCR data (as detailed in the next section).
Other genes that are frequently reported to be coldresponsive are flavonoid-associated as summarized in
Table 4[32,33]. However, sugars and in particular sucrose
are a well-established trigger for this pathway [34-37] and
thus cold may only indirectly mediate enhanced expression of flavonoid-associated genes via an increase in sugar
levels. As a consequence of cold incubation, sucrose

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/176

reaches levels that are known to influence transcript accumulation for the above genes in just a few days [36].
Transcript profiling of carbohydrate-associated genes
during early cold sweetening events
We preliminarily investigated the pattern of sugar accumulation in a time course experiment spanning 26 days.
Day 0 represents the 17°C control. Sucrose, glucose and
fructose contents of three independent tubers for each
time point were measured and their averaged values ± SD
are plotted in Figure 4. In agreement with other studies
detailing early cold sweetening events [38,39], sucrose
began accumulating at the onset of cold incubation and
reached a plateau within two weeks. Glucose and fructose
accumulated slowly during the first few days and
increased sharply as the sucrose levels stopped increasing.
At the last sampling time (day 26) glucose and fructose
levels equalled sucrose concentration on a molar basis.

It is generally accepted that cold sweetening is fuelled by
starch-derived hexoses, and various studies have been carried out to investigate the contribution of starch-degrading enzymes. Some studies have reported an involvement
in CIS of Glucan phosphorylases, α and β-amylases, and
α-glucosidases [14]. Glucan phosphorylase has long been
argued as being responsible for cold-triggered starch degradation [[14] and references therein] and transgenic antisense approaches, including recent ones, have succeeded
to some extent in lowering glucose accumulated over
three months of cold storage [40]. However, several stud-

ies do not support the prominent role of phosphorolytic
starch degradation in the early stages of cold storage, as
opposed to other enzymes. In fact, at least one cold-triggered amylase activity was shown to be activated as highlighted by zymograms [38]. These amylolytic activities
were identified as β-amylases based on substrate specificity [16] but still remained uncharacterized at a molecular
level. Our GeneChip data indicated that a β-amylase
(Les.2844.1.S1_at; best potato hit: TA23155_4113)
underwent strong (61-fold) up-regulation. A qPCR Taqman assay based on the potato TA23155_4113 sequences
is shown in Figure 5, indicating a strong up-regulation

within the first two days, peaking at day 2 with a 112-fold
induction and a subsequent decline to 4-fold induction at
day 26. This potato TA showed maximum homology
(82% identity and 92% homology based on TblastN output) to plastid-targeted Arabidopsis β-amylase BMY7
(At3g23920) known to undergo redox activation by
thioredoxins and to be especially expressed in non-photosynthetic tissues in a stress-responsive manner [41].
However, TA23155_4113 was not full length and covered
only about 70% of Arabidopsis BMY7 most 3' CDS. Nonetheless, all 6 Cys residues in the alignment were con-

sequences perfectly matched potato TA23155_4113 and
confirmed the presence in Stu.4927 of ESTs encompassing
the start codon (e.g. CK274395) of all the remaining 2
Cys, including Cys-32. Furthermore, chloroP v1.1 [42]
predicted a plastid transit peptide for the same 5' EST in
Stu.4927 cluster. It seems therefore likely that
TA23155_4113 and the more complete Stu.4927 unigene
entries do represent the potato ortholog (which we propose to call St-BMY7) of Arabidopsis BMY7. Intriguingly,
transcriptional up-regulation of St-BMY7 closely mirrored
the β-amylase activity profiles shown by Hill et al. [38]
and Nielsen et al. [16].
We next investigated the possible cold-dependent regulation of additional β-amylase mRNAs. Probeset

(TA33682_4113), i.e. potato tuber chloroplast-targeted βamylase (Arabidopsis homologue: BMY8; At4g17090; [4345]), but showed only negligible induction (1.1 fold).
Nonetheless, the very low signal intensity (Max Signal
equal to 14) coupled with moderate identity despite the
otherwise full alignment (95% identity within alignment,
as assessed by the Global Match File) suggested that further probe level analysis was necessary to rule out significant up-regulation of this further β-amylase. Indeed,
probe match analysis revealed that only probes 8 and 9
matched perfectly, and subsequent visualization at a
probe level highlighted that some higher up-regulation
was indeed occurring (data not shown). We thus tested
PCT-BMYI transcript levels by qPCR confirming significant early up-regulation, peaking on day 3 but still sustained at day 26 (9-fold induction; Figure 5).

as forming an inhibitory disulfide with Cys-32 in BMY7

Overall, our data indicate that at least two cold-triggered
β-amylase activities can be identified at the sequence level
with TA23155_4113 (which we propose to call St-BMY7)
and PCT-BMYI i.e. potato tuber chloroplast-targeted βamylase [43]. As in previous studies only one or at best
two β-amylases were visible in zymograms [16,38], we
believe that most of the early, cold-triggered β-amylase
activity has now been accounted for. The finding that an
Arabidopsis BMY7 homologue was induced by cold may
have important implications in terms of a redox regulation of early amylolytic events and the overall contribution that such redox signalling can exert over the entire
sweetening process. Intriguingly, the activation of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and thus the fuelling
of NADPH for redox-controlled processes was supported
by transcript accumulation of several dedicated genes.
Some of these entries are listed in Table 5. In particular,
transcripts for a plastid-targeted Glc 6-P dehydrogenase
(Les.824.1.S1_at; TA30812_4113) are 2.8-fold induced.
This dehydrogenase belongs to the P2-type group showing reduced NADPH feedback inhibition and redox modulation, and thus seems most appropriate for determining

a NADPH upsurge to cope with redox processes in a heterotrophic tissue [46]. Similarly, 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase (Les.2101.1.A1_a_at; TA27126_4113)
transcript was 3.4-fold induced. Although the tomato
GeneChip may not represent some gene family members
and some homologies may be too poor to disclose full upregulation, several additional transcripts encoding genes
involved in thiol signalling are indeed upregulated, such
as several Trx homologs [including an m-type Trx, recently
observed in amyloplasts isolated from wheat starchy
endosperm by Balmer et al., [47] and ferredoxin-NADP+
reductase and ferredoxin-Trx-reductase [Table 5]]. A nonphotosynthetic ferredoxin type III [48] is induced as well
(Les.1990.2.A1_at; 2.32-fold). Amyloplasts contain a
complete battery of enzymes for redox thiol signalling,
including ferredoxin-NADP reductase, ferredoxin, ferredoxin-Trx reductase (FTR), and Trx (m-type). It thus
appears that amyloplasts can translate a sugar signal to a
redox signal for further, thiol-mediated redox post-translational regulation [46,49,50]. However, such activation
has not been reported for PCT-BMYI. One explanation
may be that the two transcriptionally activated β-amylases, St-BMY7 and PCT-BMYI, exhibit complementary
features. The first enzyme is regulated by redox cues, while
PCT-BMYI is capable of hydrolysing, in addition to soluble starch, intact potato starch granules [43]. Furthermore,
at the very end of our sampling time, PCT-BMYI transcripts were still tenfold higher than the control, suggesting persisting transcriptional activation even at later stages
of cold incubation.

We then investigated other amylolytic enzymes. Glucan
phosphorylase has been widely mentioned in the coldsweetening process as being involved in starch breakdown
[14]. Two probesets, namely Les.2820.1.S1_at and
Les.2820.2.S1_at with best hit TA24089_4113, coding for
potato glucan phosphorylase (α-1,4 glucan phosphorylase, L-1 isozyme, chloroplast precursor) showed downregulation at day 4 of cold-incubation (2.94- and 3.22fold, respectively, with the first probeset included in the
DEG list). qPCR confirmed moderate transcript down-regulation, which after a negligible induction in the first two
days started decreasing with an intervening minor peak on
day 4 down to a more than 30-fold decrease on days 8 and
10 (Figure 5). The transcript level then rose steadily to
reach a 1.8-fold induction, suggesting that transcriptional
regulation of glucan phosphorylase, if present, may only
be relevant at later stages. Glucan-water-dikinase (GWD)
is another key enzyme controlling the phosphorylation
degree of starch and its susceptibility to degradation, possibly as a consequence of relaxed steric hindrance and
increased accessibility of amylolytic enzymes [51]. Arabidopsis defective for the GWD homolog gene (SEX1;
STARCH EXCESS 1) exhibited a starch over-accumulating
phenotype and reduced freezing tolerance and SEX1 tran-

scripts were also cold induced [52]. Furthermore, some
transgenic antisense approaches with GWD were successful in reducing level of sugars in tubers following a twomonth-long incubation at 4°C [53]. Probesets
Les.3195.1.S1_at and Les.3195.2.S1_at (best hit for both
TA25853_4113, potato GWD, chloroplast precursor)
were both included in the DEG list (1.96 and 2.12 -fold
down-regulation, respectively). Figure 5 shows that the
time course for GWD transcript accumulation was similar
to glucan phosphorylase with a net decrease approaching
one-tenth of the control levels after one week and a subsequent rise to half that of the control levels at the last sampled time. Overall, these two genes showed moderate
transcriptional regulation by cold at least within the
experimental time frame of 26 days. However, both
enzymes are known to be redox-regulated by thioredoxins
[47] and thus post-transcriptional events may alter this
scenario. On the other hand, activity measurements on
zymograms have failed to detect glucan phosphorylase
activity modulation at least in the first 48 days [38].
We also analysed invertases, as they convert sucrose to the
reducing sugars glucose and fructose. Invertases have been
extensively investigated in the context of potato cold
sweetening, and several studies have concluded that these
enzymes mainly control the hexose/sucrose ratio, ruling
out a more general influence on overall sugar accumulation [14]. Poor correlation was in fact found among total

invertase activity (both acid and neutral) and overall sugar
accumulation [19]. The scenario is however rather intricate as an invertase inhibitor may alter the overall activities [54]. Using northern blots Zrenner et al. [19]
monitored the accumulation of transcripts coding for a
soluble acid invertase (Pain-1), and detected a strong
accumulation after tuber storage at 4°C, rising steadily
after 2 days up to two weeks, until a decline was observed
after 6 weeks. A transgenic antisense approach with the
same acid invertase solely resulted in a lowering of hexoses, which was however paralleled by an increase in
sucrose levels after tuber cold-incubation for 20 weeks. A
transgenic approach involving ectopic expression of a
tobacco invertase inhibitor circumvented the problem of
possible invertase isoforms and resulted in a fair reduction (up to 75%) of hexoses [55]. Nonetheless, as noted
elsewhere, cold-induced reducing sugar accumulation was
still noticeably high to comply with processing industry
requirements [14].
The existence of other cold-induced invertases has been
widely proposed. Several cold-induced invertases with
distinct properties such as pH-dependence, Km and heatstability could be separated by column chromatography
[56]. Our GeneChip data revealed that only two probesets
referring to invertases were differentially regulated. The
first one, Les.2702.1.S1_a_at, despite an intervening stop
codon in the tomato target region influencing the overall

alignment and a low Max Signal (Max Signal value equal
to 20), was included in the DEG list and was 2.7-fold
induced. The probeset best refers to potato
TA26908_4113, annotated as potato acid invertase, which
in turn refers to invertase Pain-1 [19]. qPCR with Pain-1
specific Taqman assay revealed a biphasic induction pattern, with 400-fold induction peaking at day 3 and, following a slight decline to a 30-fold induction, again
increased to reach an apparently stable plateau (1100fold) until the final sampling time (Figure 6). This pattern
may not really be distinct from the Pain-1 transcript pattern described above, as the early induction peak may not
have been observed in the previous analysis due to fewer
samplings in the 4- to 14-day time window [19].
A second probeset (LesAffx.37983.1.S1_at, corresponding
to potato TA42474_4113 annotated as "putative neutral/
alkaline invertase Cassava") showed a 2.37 fold induction. Although not listed in our DEG list, the very low Max
Signal level (Max Signal value equal to 15) suggested that
some underestimation might have occurred. Indeed,
probe level analysis confirmed induction as assessed by
signals associated to perfectly matching probes (not
shown). As cold-triggered transcript up-regulation for an
invertase has only previously been reported for the acid
invertase Pain-1, we monitored neutral invertase transcripts by qPCR. As shown in Figure 6, we confirmed upregulation (24-fold induction at day 4) followed by a
decline to levels slightly above the controls (3- to 4-fold
induction) in the remaining sampling times. The partial
success previously obtained with transgenic Pain-1 acid
invertase antisense approaches over total sugar accumulation may be due to the expression of this additional neutral invertase.
UDP-Glucose-pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) catalyses the
formation of the high energy compound UDP-Glc which,
with Fru-6-P, is the substrate for sucrose synthesis and
therefore is of paramount importance for sweetening.
Despite the presence of various isoforms which have been
involved in conferring differential susceptibility to CIS
[14,57], the enzyme is poorly regulated, and antisense
approaches have revealed that as little as 4–5% of UGPase
expression was sufficient to carry out normal functions, as
the tuber did not show relevant changes in carbohydrateassociated parameters [14]. In any case, steady-state levels
of UGPase mRNA were found to be very high in sink
tubers, and dropped dramatically following harvest and
prolonged storage (8 months) in the dark at room temperature. Cold storage of these tubers led to a significant
increase in steady-state mRNA levels compared to tubers
stored for 8-months at room temperature at weeks 1 and
2, with a slight decrease at week 3 [18]. Tomato GeneChip
Probeset Les.3208.1.S1_at refers to UGPase (potato

lation following the 4-day cold treatment. A moderate,
but clear, induction was observed in qPCR peaking at day
3, followed by a decline to one-tenth of the control transcript and a subsequent, steady rise which continued to
the final time point (Figure 7). Again, this profile is similar to previous northern experiments [18] when taking

into account the less frequent sampling times used by
these authors.
Sucrose Phosphate Synthase (SPS) has been widely studied in the context of sweetening. SPS is a highly regulated
enzyme, undergoing modulation by allosteric effectors
(Glc6P and Pi) and phosphorylation. Furthermore, SPS
seems to alter its kinetic properties rather than its
amounts of protein as a consequence of cold incubation
and, as it is thought to be expressed in excess over cell
demand, its activity is substrate-limited [58]. Nonetheless,
it has been reported that SPS may undergo transcriptional
activation since after 1, 2 or 3 weeks of 4°C storage, a constant increase in steady-state mRNA levels was observed
[59]. Probeset Les.3522.1.S1_at is included in the DEG list
(2.96-fold induction) and best matches potato
TA26174_4113 annotated as Solanum tuberosum SPS.
qPCR analysis showed an early induction peak (day 3;
3.5-fold) followed by a decline and again a stepping up
which was sustained until day 26 (Figure 7). This data is
in good agreement with previous northern experiments
and similarly to those cases the first sampling time (1
week) was too late to detect the early burst of transcript
accumulation [58].

that
probeset
Les.157.1.S1_at, with the highest similarity to potato
TA24067_4113 annotated as potato sucrose synthase 2,
was 6.75-fold induced. As sucrose synthases are thought
to mainly function in the sucrolytic direction, with a key
role in determining tuber sink strength [60], comparatively fewer studies on sucrose synthase (SuSy) have been
conducted in the context of potato tuber cold sweetening.
As shown in Figure 7, SuSy transcript shows a relatively
slower induction, possibly resulting from the sum of two
early peaks. Maximum fold induction (10-fold) was at day
8 and was followed by a slow decline to values closely
resembling control at the last time point. Since some SuSy
gene family members contain sucrose-responsive elements [61], transcriptional activation may be triggered by
sucrose accumulation, which is sustained within the first
two weeks. The possible sucrose-dependent gene expression occurring in tubers after four days of cold storage is
further supported by the induction of patatin,
(Les.4742.1.S1_at; TA23313_4113; 6.46-fold), the abundant vacuolar storage protein bearing a well-characterized
sucrose-responsive (SURE) element in its promoter [61].
SURE elements respond to, among others, WRKY transcription factors, which are in turn sugar-inducible [62],
and at least two WRKY factors are upregulated based on
our GeneChip data upon cold storage. These are "WRKY

indicates that cold-associated sugar accumulation in
potato tubers may in turn trigger the activation of a variety
of sugar-responsive genes (e.g. the previously mentioned
flavonoid- and anthocyanin-associated genes) thus
branching outside carbohydrate-pertinent processes.
Ethylene and fruit-ripening associated genes
The potato counterparts of numerous tomato ethylene
biosynthesis, ethylene responsive and, more in general,
fruit ripening-modulated genes were upregulated as a consequence of cold incubation for 4 days at 4°C. Table 6 lists
the tomato probesets, fold induction, associated potato
TA/singleton and annotation (best hit according to Global Match File) and reference material. Where applicable,
the probeset entry refers to the tentative consensus ID and
relative annotation of a recently produced list of ripening
up-regulated transcripts (tomato ripening induced genes)
available in the Tomato Expression Database (TED) [6365]. The genes in Table 6 are listed according to their fold
induction and only consist of a subset of representative
ripening-upregulated transcripts selected to cover various
biological processes. With respect to genes for ethylene
biosynthesis, a probeset referring to potato ACC oxidase
ACO1 gene (Les.2560.1.S1_at; potato best match
TA25537_4113, annotated as potato ACC oxidase ACO1)
was strongly upregulated (13-fold). A gene family member of ACC synthase (Les.3769.1.S1_at; best match
TA42274_4113 annotated as potato ACC synthase) was
only moderately induced (1.4-fold) and is not listed in the
DEG. This may be due to known post-transcriptional regulation of ACS [66,67] or to the fact that ACO and ACS
expression profiles frequently differ in timing [68-71].
Similarly, ACO but not ACS transcripts were found to
strongly accumulate in mature green vs. breaker tomato
fruit transition stages in the ripening-upregulated list
[TED database [64]].

To confirm the GeneChip data, we monitored potato
ACO1 transcripts by qPCR. A dramatic transcript accumulation was detected which peaked at day 3 with a 5,800fold induction. Transcript levels were subsequently lowered with an intervening shoulder at day 8 which preceded a further decrease. However, at the last sampling
time point, ACO1 transcripts were still 43 times higher
than the baseline (Figure 8).
Further early events known to occur following exposure to
ethylene include the accumulation of transcripts for some
ethylene receptors [72,73]. Indeed, transcripts for two ethylene receptors (Les.36.1.S1_at; CN214325 and
Les.3490.1.S1_at; TA42479_4113) accumulate 3.30- and
4.27-fold, respectively, as a consequence of cold incubation in tubers. Several additional components of the
downstream ethylene signalling machinery are known to
undergo prevalent post-transcriptional regulation. These

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/176

include the EIN3 transcription factor, which lies downstream of the ethylene receptors, and the negative regulator CTR1 and activates a wide range of ethyleneresponsive transcription factors belonging to the ERF/AP2
group [74]. EIN3 protein steady state levels are tightly regulated by an ubiquitin/proteasome pathway mediated by
the F-box proteins EBF 1 and 2 (EIN3-binding F-box proteins) [75]. While EBF2 is not represented in the tomato
GeneChip, the potato homologue of tomato EBF1
(Les.411.2.A1_at; TA30136_4113) is 2.21-fold induced,
mirroring what has been reported for the Arabidopsis EBF
homologs upon ethylene stimulation [75].
In order to assess up-regulation of ethylene-induced genes
in downstream steps, we tested the expression pattern of
ER24 [76] by qPCR, an ethylene-responsive factor bearing
similarities
to
transcriptional
co-activators
(Les.3551.1.S1_at; CV475083; GeneChip induction of
22.9-fold). ER24 transcripts increased at day 2 of cold
incubation reaching a 60-fold induction until day 6 when
they started to decline to tenfold with respect to the control. At day 26, ER24 transcripts were reduced to half that
of the controls (Figure 8).
Various further ethylene-responsive transcription factors
belonging to the ERF/AP2 were induced on the basis of
our data set. To name just a few, JERF3 (Jasmonate and
ethylene-responsive factor 3; Les.2992.1.S1_a_at;
BQ504492; 2.58-fold), CaERFLP1, and Pti6, as further
detailed below.
In conclusion, taking into account that a variety of ethylene-responsive genes whose induction kinetics are different from our GeneChip sampling time (4 days at 4°C)
would have escaped detection and that the tomato GeneChip contains only 10,000 elements (and further entries
are lost due to poor potato-tomato homology), various
ethylene and ripening-induced genes in tomato and other
climateric and non-climateric plants appear to be induced
by cold in potato tubers.
No role, to our knowledge, has to date been attributed to
endogenous ethylene in triggering/signalling potato tuber
cold sweetening. However, in addition to our data, some
circumstantial evidence supports this view. In fact, potato
ACO1 and ACO2 have been shown to respond to various
abiotic stresses including cold [77]. The production of
"chilling ethylene" appears to be common in Solanaceous
[[78] and references therein] and microarray studies reveal
enhanced expression of numerous ethylene-responsive
factors upon chilling treatment in pepper [79]. Similarly,
exogenous ethylene administration to potato tubers
closely mimics the effects of cold incubation. In fact, it
causes the enhancement of CN-insensitive respiration,
enhanced glycolysis and, where tested, the accumulation

Selected entries from a set of genes, which are transcriptionally up-regulated by both ripening (various databases as indicated) and cold (our
GeneChip dataset). TED database [64] refers to a recent list of tomato ripening-up-regulated genes (transition from mature green to breaker stage)
and the ID of the corresponding tomato Tentative Consensus (TC) entry is reported. Fold changes represent the ratios of stress to control average
signals (two biological replicates for both control and stress conditions). Further details are as described in Table 2.

of sucrose and reducing sugars [[80-84], and references
therein]. Studies on the exogenous ethylene anti-sprouting potential on potato tubers have determined that ethylene amounts need to be carefully modulated to avoid
sugar accumulation and chip darkening upon frying. The
threshold of ethylene concentration affecting fry darkening is lower than 0.4 μl L-1 and is saturated at 4 μl L-1 [[85],
and references therein]. These levels are similar to those
that trigger respiratory stimulation [0.02 μl L-1 for partial
effects and 2 μl L-1 for full stimulation, respectively
[86,87]].
Much less information is available on potato endogenous
ethylene. It is produced at low rates in unchallenged
tubers, but in wound-induced tubers hormone levels
inducing respiratory responses may be reached, and thus
potato tuber ethylene responsiveness may represent a
physiological response to wounding [86]. Indeed, levels
of endogenous ethylene up to 0.4 μl Kg-1 h-1 upon environmental stress have been reported [[88,89] and references therein] suggesting that in appropriate post-harvest
settings chilling ethylene may play a role in CIS.
In agreement with these arguments, 1-methyl cyclopropene (1-MCP), an ethylene competitive inhibitor, counteracts chip darkening induced by exogenous ethylene
[[90-92] and references therein].
It thus appears that many phenomena associated with
cold sweetening may be accounted for an upsurge in
endogenous ethylene production. Intriguingly, both ethylene-responsive (EREBP or ERF) and cold-responsive
(DREB/CBF) transcription factors belong to the same
AP2/ERF family of transcription factors [93]. Some members of this family can bind to both cis-elements (GCC
and CRT/DRE, respectively) albeit with different affinities,
as in the case of the tobacco ethylene-inducible Tsi1 transcription factor. Tsi1 over-expression results in enhanced
expression of biotic, GCC-controlled pathogenesis-related
genes as well as abiotic stress signalling (CRT/DRE-con-

trolled) pathways [94]. It is interesting that the tomato
counterpart of Tsi1 (Pti6) and its closely matching potato
counterpart showed enhanced expression in our dataset
(Les.3574.1.S1_at; TA30534_4113; 4.65-fold). A similar
case is the abiotic Ethylene-Responsive Factor Like Protein
1 in hot pepper [CaERFLP1; [95]]. Again, our dataset indicated
enhanced
expression
of
this
factor
(Les.4102.1.S1_at; TA24509_4113; 3.58-fold). In Arabidopsis, a recent report indicates that TINY, a DREB-like factor strongly activated by drought, cold and ethylene, is
capable of binding both CRT/DRE and GCC elements
with similar affinity. In the same report, ethylene and cold
were shown to up-regulate CRT/DRE- and GCC-controlled genes, respectively [96]. Numerous, similar cases of
transcription factors with such potential cross-functionality are emerging especially in the Solanaceous species [97100].
Overall, based on our own data, TED database and
numerous further reports [[68,70,101], and references
therein] cold and ethylene stimuli appear to cause similar
effects on potato tubers such as sugar accumulation, heat
shock responses, flavonoid and carotenoid accumulation
and enhanced (cyanide-insensitive) respiration. At a gene
level, "Cold-Induced 7" protein, acid invertase, enolase,
alternative oxidase, ELIP and Glu-6-P-dehydrogenase, to
mention only a few among the best-known entries in
Table 6, are induced by both triggers.

Conclusion
Our tomato-potato heterologous approach proved to be
essential in planning qPCR experiments regarding coldresponsive gene family members and hinted at further
cold-triggered processes that accompany CIS. This suggests that the wealth of available sequence information
provided by current plant databases can be fruitfully
exploited using heterologous GeneChip approaches for a
wide range of species. This applies at least for preliminary
screenings that aim to identify candidate genes for further
study using more precise techniques such as qPCR. The

related species is in any case likely to greatly exceed the
number of genes that can be treated using traditional profiling approaches. Furthermore, the use of a ready, highly
standardized platform with publicly available probeset
data such as the commercially available GeneChip should
reduce cross-laboratory differences, which may affect custom array approaches.
The GeneChip-assisted qPCR dataset provides a unifying
picture of transcriptional events during the first 26 days of
CIS. This should prove helpful when trying to ascertain
the contribution of various carbohydrate-associated genes
to CIS.
In addition to detecting a previously unknown early burst
of expression of several carbohydrate-associated genes,
our data highlight the key role of β-amylases, which
undergo an early enhanced expression. In particular, we
identified a β-amylase (St-BMY7) at the sequence level
that shows maximum homology to a Trx-regulated Arabidopsis counterpart, BMY7. This, coupled with the activation of redox machinery, suggests that thiol signalling
may play a critical role in early cold-sweetening events,
especially in the breakdown of starch. In fact, since starch
synthesis is known to be modulated by thiol signalling
[102], further issues related to the metabolism of starch
may be controlled by redox cues.
At least for the subset of early cold-responsive gene family
members represented in the GeneChip, no phosphorolytic starch degradation can be seen from our transcriptional data, while an unexpected accumulation of SuSy
transcript is evident in the first days. In accordance with
previous investigations, transcript profiling supports a
continuative role of SPS and acid invertase in CIS.

assessment of alignment quality using a global match procedure should lead to the identification of subsets of
highly conserved genes for virtually all species with a reasonable level of phylogenetic relatedness to a "GeneChip
available" species. As a result, expression data for genes
whose sequence information is available can be validated
and optimized while still providing an insight into overall
expression trends for all the genes represented in the
GeneChip. The potentially low number of sequences

An intricate crosstalk of regulatory molecules including
ethylene and sugars appears to be triggered within a few
days at the onset of cold incubation in potato tubers. Ethylene production in potato tubers may be a specific
response to chilling or a vestigial response due to relatedness to climateric Solanaceous species such as tomato.
Further research is needed to assess the contributory/causative role of ethylene in CIS. It would also be interesting
to determine to what extent the manipulation of endogenous, cold-induced ethylene in potato tubers could positively impact CIS.
The identification at a sequence level of various enzymes
well established as playing a role in CIS and the discovery
of several unexpected CIS-associated global expression
trends provides new molecular and conceptual tools for
further understanding this phenomenon. This would then
improve our knowledge of key food safety issues such as

potato chip darkening and acrylamide content upon frying.

Methods
Plant material
Field-grown potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum cv Hermes)
were harvested at physiological maturity (as judged by
skin setting) and subjected to a two-week curing period
(25°C) before storage at 17°C in the dark for one month.
Tubers devoid of defects and of a similar size were incubated at 4°C in the dark in an aerated chamber (90% relative humidity). For the GeneChip experiments, two
biological replicates (two distinct tubers) for both control
(17°C) and cold-incubated tubers (4 days at 4°C) were
used. Tuber material was collected by punching the pith
with a 15-mm cork-borer taking care to avoid any vascular
tissue. Disks of about 0.5 cm were immediately sliced in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use.
Sugar determinations
Tuber disks were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. For each tuber, 500 milligrams were resuspended in
5 ml of 80% (v/v) ethanol and incubated in a shaking
water bath at 75°C for 1 hour. Two milliliters of the resulting suspension were centrifuged at 15,000 g and 7 μl of
supernatant were used for triplicate determinations.
Sucrose, glucose and fructose were determined enzymatically using a UV-method (Boehringer Manheim/R-Biopharm Cat. Nr. 716260035) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. A Tecan spectra plate reader
equipped with a 340 nm filter was used for absorbance
readings. The automated readings were carried out using
Magellan software. For each sampling time during sweetening, three independent tubers were assayed and results
are reported as means ± SD.
RNA extraction
A method based on a Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kit was
used with slight modifications. Tuber disks (see above)
were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and 1 g
of powder was routinely used. To avoid starch interference
and improve the RNA yield, 1 vol of Qiagen RLT extraction buffer was combined with an equal volume of the
following solution: 2 % (w/v) CTAB (Cetyl Trimethyl
Ammonium Bromide); 2% (w/v) PVP 40; EDTA 25 mM;
Tris/HCl 100 mM (pH 8). The resulting milky mixture
(buffer A) was brought to 2 M NaCl and beta-Mercaptoethanol was added (1% final concentration). For each
gram of tuber powder, 1.5 ml of buffer A was used. Subsequent steps in RNA preparation were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions, the only exception
being that, when spin column capacity was exceeded,
washes were repeated when necessary to allow for the
higher volumes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/176

qPCR experiments
Total RNA, extracted as above, was subjected to an extensive DNase treatment using a TURBO DNA-free kit
(Ambion). Five micrograms of each sample were reverse
transcribed into cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA
archive kit (Applied Biosystems). qPCR amplification was
carried out using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems) in accordance with the
default ABI Prism 7000 PCR program for PCR conditions.
Potato EF1-alpha (AB061263) was used as an endogenous control since it is an appropriate reference for cold
stress in potatoes [108]. Gene-specific primers/TaqMan
probes were used. When the exon-intron structure of a
potato gene was known, TaqMan probes were designed
over an exon-intron boundary. Probe and primer
sequences are reported in Additional file 4. PCR reactions
were carried out using 50 ng of cDNA and TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), following
the manufacturer's instructions. Relative quantitation of
each individual gene expression was performed using a
comparative CT method, as described in the ABI PRISM
7700 Sequence Detection System User Bulletin #2
(Applied Biosystems). Data points in qPCR time courses
are reported as means ± SD of two technical replicates of
a single, representative profile.
Microarray Experiments and Statistical Analysis
Two biological replicates were used by extracting total
RNA from two distinct tubers for both the control (17°C)
and cold treatment (4 days at 4°C). RNA quality was
assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. RNA processing for use on the tomato GeneChip
Array was carried out as in [34]. Hybridization, washing,
staining, and scanning procedures were performed as
described in the Affymetrix technical manual.

Microarray analysis was performed using R/Bioconductor
[109]. Expression measures for each probeset were
obtained using GCRMA [110], which is a multi-array
analysis method estimating probeset signals considering
the physical affinities between probes and targets. Normalization was performed using a quantiles method
[111]. To discard probesets with the lowest variability
from the two experimental conditions (control vs. cold
treatment), thus reducing the number of non-informative
genes, a filter based on an interquartile range was applied
(IQR = 0.18).
This filtering method discards approximately half of the
total amount of probesets. To identify a statistically reliable number of differentially expressed genes from the two
conditions, a linear model was performed [112]. To assess
the differential expression, an empirical Bayesian method

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/176

[113] was used to moderate the standard error of the estimated log-fold changes. This method, applying a hierarchical model, allows to estimate the hyperparameters of
prior distribution directly from the data. The advantage is
an improvement in error estimates for genes with a small
number of replicates. To control the number of false positives, a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction of
the false discovery rate [114] was applied (adjusted Pvalue <= 0.05). This procedure led to the final number of
1,854 differentially expressed probesets.

To characterize the alignment quality and reduce the
number of redundant alignments with low matching
scores, three different quality indexes were defined and
added to the global match file as follows:

We used a hierarchical clustering method to concisely represent the expression profiles of all the 1,854 differentially
expressed probesets, and the intersection between these
probesets and those selected by matching tomato vs.
potato at a 70% perfect alignment (%_PERF_ALIGN)
threshold. The length of each branch of the dendrogram
indicates (1 – Pearson) correlation coefficients as a measure of similarity. The resulting tree structure shows the
relationship between the expression profiles of each
probeset. The figure is a heat map of the 1,854 differentially expressed probesets. The expression values of each
probeset are divided by the median value, and the log2 of
this ratio is reported. Red indicates samples where the
probeset is more expressed, blue where the expression is
smaller. Probesets (rows) are reordered based on their
similarity, as indicated in the respective dendrograms. The
column between the dendrogram and the heatmap represents the probesets either differentially expressed and
selected with the 70% perfect alignment threshold (yellow), or the probesets differentially expressed but not
selected by the Perfect Alignment threshold (black).

- %_PERF_ALIGN: Corrected ratio between aligned portion of a potato's EST against the tomato's target
(%_ALIGN/TARG * %_IDENTITY)/100. This correction is
needed to obtain the percentage of net alignment, thus
hiding the effects of non-contiguous alignment regions.
Scores of 100% meant that the entire length of the tomato
target sequence was aligned. Matches below the 5%
PERF_ALIGN threshold were excluded.

Tomato vs. potato global matching
A BLAST [115] of all the tomato targets – derived from
Affymetrix's Tomato GeneChip [116] – against the total
amount of TIGR 's Potato EST Release 2 [117] was performed. Standalone BLAST was run locally using default
settings. In order to get a customized BLAST, a local potato
database was built by downloading TIGR TA Potato ESTs
(Release 2) and formatting them with the BLAST formatDB integrated function. Finally, a global query for all
the tomato targets was performed. Results were parsed to
colligate the BLAST indexes into a single file, which enabled them to be easily compared and further indexes
defined. A BLAST search was executed on an Intel Pentium
IV with a 3 Gb RAM running Linux. A redundant set of
430,000 alignments was obtained, since the tomato target
sequences frequently produced numerous multiple
matches of various scores, unless a threshold value for
alignment quality/magnitude was set. By filtering matches
below a 5% %_PERF_ALIGN threshold (Table 1; and for
more details see below), we reduced the number of entries
to 269,474.

- %_ALIGN/TARG: Rough ratio between aligned portion
of a potato's EST against the total length of a tomato's target (ALIGN_LENGTH/LENGTH_TOM) * 100 to roughly
assess alignment regions. Scores higher than 100% mean
that there were some 'holes' in the alignment.

- %_STOP_DIST: Ratio between position of last nucleotide aligned in a tomato's target against the total length
of the tomato's target (LAST_POS_TOM/LENGTH_TOM)
* 100. As Affymetrix target region design procedure is oriented towards 3' end of tomato mRNAs, this index may
help when trying to predict whether a lack of alignment
involves coding sequences or more downstream regions
in the 3' UTR.

Tomato-Potato Global Match File part 1 (GMF 1). All GeneChip
tomato target sequences were blasted against TIGR potato TA (release 2).
Matches below a 5% perfect alignment threshold were discarded. The
alignments are listed in separate sheets due to size constraints and are split
into five parts (part 1 to 5). Parts 1 and 2 are contained in this first file
(GMF 1), and parts 3 to 5 are included in additional file 2 (GMF 2). The
first part of the Global Match File also includes alignments scoring above
the 90% and 70%_PERF_ALIGN thresholds (ALL_90% and ALL_70%
sheets, respectively). As a single probeset can produce more than one hit,
both > 90% and > 70% sheets are accompanied by a further sheet listing
non-redundant probesets above the corresponding threshold. The Global
Match File was split into two parts due to upload size limits. Ideally the
two files should be merged back together, this would then enable searches
to be performed with just one query across the whole Global Match File
alignments
