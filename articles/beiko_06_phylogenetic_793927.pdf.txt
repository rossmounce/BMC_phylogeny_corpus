Abstract
Background: Lateral genetic transfer can lead to disagreements among phylogenetic trees
comprising sequences from the same set of taxa. Where topological discordance is thought to have
arisen through genetic transfer events, tree comparisons can be used to identify the lineages that
may have shared genetic information. An 'edit path' of one or more transfer events can be
represented with a series of subtree prune and regraft (SPR) operations, but finding the optimal
such set of operations is NP-hard for comparisons between rooted trees, and may be so for
unrooted trees as well.
Results: Efficient Evaluation of Edit Paths (EEEP) is a new tree comparison algorithm that uses
evolutionarily reasonable constraints to identify and eliminate many unproductive search avenues,
reducing the time required to solve many edit path problems. The performance of EEEP compares
favourably to that of other algorithms when applied to strictly bifurcating trees with specified
numbers of SPR operations. We also used EEEP to recover edit paths from over 19 000 unrooted,
incompletely resolved protein trees containing up to 144 taxa as part of a large phylogenomic study.
While inferred protein trees were far more similar to a reference supertree than random trees
were to each other, the phylogenetic distance spanned by random versus inferred transfer events
was similar, suggesting that real transfer events occur most frequently between closely related
organisms, but can span large phylogenetic distances as well. While most of the protein trees
examined here were very similar to the reference supertree, requiring zero or one edit operations
for reconciliation, some trees implied up to 40 transfer events within a single orthologous set of
proteins.
Conclusion: Since sequence trees typically have no implied root and may contain unresolved or
multifurcating nodes, the strategy implemented in EEEP is the most appropriate for phylogenomic
analyses. The high degree of consistency among inferred protein trees shows that vertical
inheritance is the dominant pattern of evolution, at least for the set of organisms considered here.
However, the edit paths inferred using EEEP suggest an important role for genetic transfer in the
evolution of microbial genomes as well.

Background
An unexpected observation from the early genome
sequencing era has been the extent to which different sets
of putatively orthologous genes often yield strongly supported but incompatible tree topologies. Whether this disagreement is due primarily to violations of phylogenetic
assumptions or to lateral genetic transfer (LGT) is still the
subject of fierce debate [1-6]. Where one or more LGT
events are suspected as a cause of topological differences
between trees, it is often desirable to identify the lineages
implicated, and if possible the direction of transfer (precisely identifying the donor and recipient taxa) as well. The
correct identification of these events depends on the size
and shape of the trees being compared, and the position
of the LGT events within these trees. When taken in aggregate, the LGT events implied by many trees can reveal
information about major pathways of gene sharing
between closely and distantly related organisms [7-9].
Deduction of LGT events from phylogenetic trees is often
based on the implicit or explicit idea of a reference tree that
)

accurately describes the evolutionary relationships
between the organisms under consideration [9-11]. In the
absence of statistical bias, complications of paralogy, and
LGT, all strongly supported gene or protein trees would
agree with this reference topology. Even if the reference
tree is simply an amalgam of many trees based on molecular sequence (e.g., a supertree), the implied 'organismal'
history will be represented as a strictly bifurcating hierarchy with a defined point of origin in time (the last common ancestor or root). Test trees inferred from a single
gene or protein, or even a concatenated set of such
sequences, will have no obvious rooting unless uniform
rates of evolution (a molecular clock) are assumed, in
which case the tree can be midpoint rooted [12], or if the
inferred gene tree is sufficiently similar to the reference
tree such that the root of the latter can be confidently
assigned to the former. Since a strict molecular clock
assumption is frequently violated by empirical data
[13,14], and the rooting of test trees may not be obvious
in the face of LGT and biased evolution, comparisons
between a rooted reference tree and one or more unrooted

SPR operation on a rooted phylogenetic tree
SPR operation on a rooted phylogenetic tree. The tree in panel (a) is subjected to an SPR operation, with participants
and direction indicated with the dashed arrow. Edge E4 is the donor edge, which is split by acquisition of the recipient edge E3.
Since they are no longer split by E3, edges E0 and E2 are consolidated into a single edge, which implies the same split of taxa as
E2. Splitting E4 yields a new parent edge E(3+4), and a child edge that implies the same split as E4. Finally, the bipartitions implied
by every other edge up to the common ancestor of the donor and recipient edges (in this case, the root R) are modified by the
swapping of subtree t from one partition to the other. Thus, in this case E1 now implies a different set of taxa and is renamed
E(1+3). Edges that are not part of the donor/recipient pair or ancestral to these edges are not affected by the inferred transfer
event.

'test' trees have the strongest evolutionary justification
and are more general than comparisons between two
rooted trees.
Another important component of tree comparisons is the
ability to deal with multifurcating nodes in trees that are
incompletely resolved. While most traditional phylogenetic methods produce completely resolved, strictly bifurcating trees as output, the statistical support (often,
bootstrap proportion or Bayesian posterior probability) at
some of these bifurcating nodes may be extremely weak.
Thus, a disagreement between two trees that is based on a
weakly supported topological feature may be of no interest, and it is often preferable to collapse the corresponding
feature into a multifurcating node. Finally, in broad phylogenomic studies most sets of putatively orthologous
genes or proteins will not cover the entire reference tree,
so it may be necessary to 'project' the reference tree by
removing the non-represented taxa before performing the
comparison. However, if inferred LGT events are to be
compared, it must be possible to evaluate them all in light
of the complete reference tree.
While many tree comparison metrics exist [15-18], the
subtree prune and regraft (SPR) distance [19-21] is most
relevant to the inference of LGT events. A subtree prune and
regraft operation on a binary tree T is performed by cutting
any edge and thereby pruning subtree t, and then regrafting the subtree by the same cut edge to a new vertex
obtained by dividing a pre-existing edge in T-t (Figure 1).
Forced contraction is also applied to maintain the binary
property [20]. In the context of an LGT event, the edge that
is regrafted onto corresponds to the donor taxon, while
the edge that is cut corresponds to the position of the
recipient taxon. An edit path is any set of such SPR operations that can be applied to a reference tree to yield a
topology that is congruent with the inferred protein tree.
By extension, an optimal edit path is one of the (possibly
many) edit paths that is minimal or most-parsimonious
for a given reference and test tree, such that there exists no
edit path solution requiring fewer edit operations. The
length of the optimal edit path is the minimal SPR distance
or edit distance between the two trees.
The computational complexity of calculating the SPR distance between unrooted binary trees is unknown. A proof
of NP-hardness was given in Hein et al. [19], but was subsequently noted to be incorrect by Allen and Steel [20],
who further showed that the related tree bisection and
reconnection (TBR) distance problem is NP-hard but fixed
parameter tractable (FPT) for unrooted binary trees. Bordewich et al. [21] showed that computing the SPR distance between rooted binary trees is also NP-hard. The
problem that we are attempting to solve here is slightly
different from the above in that we have a rooted binary

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/15

reference tree and an unrooted, possibly multificating, test
tree. The bipartition measure we use to compare trees
treats the reference tree as if it were unrooted and multifurcating when comparing it to the test tree. Thus the
problem we are attempting to solve is the SPR distance
between unrooted multifurcating trees. The complexity of
this problem is open, but given the above results it is very
likely to be NP-hard.
A variety of algorithms for calculating or approximating
SPR and other distance measures between trees have been
proposed in the literature. Hein et al. [19] gave an algorithm that claimed to approximate SPR distance between
rooted phylogenetic trees to within a factor of 3. However,
Allen and Steel [20] showed that it is actually the tree
bisection and reconnection (TBR) distance that is being
calculated, and in Rodrigues et al. [22] the approximation
factor was shown to be 4. LatTrans [23] calculates the minimum number of SPR operations in the path between two
rooted binary phylogenetic trees subject to certain direction of time constraints. They identify two ways in which
the (augmented) reference tree and the test tree can disagree (I-fat and H-fat vertices), and give corresponding SPR
operations to fix them (I-moves and H-moves). The algorithm is then to find an I-fat or H-fat vertex, fix it, and then
recurse, checking that cycles (time violations) are not
introduced. The case where there may be multiple copies
of a gene in a given species is also considered. The algorithm has been used to identify up to 20 transfers in 300
leaves [24], but in 1% of trials, the algorithm did not find
a valid scenario with the real number of transfers.
The HorizStory algorithm [25] approximates the SPR distance between rooted and possibly multifurcating phylogenetic trees. The algorithm works by first eliminating
rooted subtrees in the gene and reference trees that are in
complete agreement, i.e. are identical. SPR moves are then
recursively proposed on the remaining trees until they are
brought into agreement. A unique feature of the algorithm is that is can propose phantom sister taxa, which are
not represented in the reference tree because of incomplete taxon sampling, but donate genes to taxa that are
represented in the analysis. While this is a realistic innovation that was not implemented in previous algorithms,
a given set of lateral transfers involving no phantom sisters can often be "explained" by a smaller set of transfers
involving phantom sisters, in which case the algorithm
will not find this larger set.
We have developed a new program EEEP (Efficient Evaluation of Edit Paths) for the inference of edit paths which
imposes evolutionarily reasonable constraints on the
search space of edits to reduce the overall computational
burden while retaining the ability to produce accurate
solution sets. An important feature of EEEP is the ability

Phylogenetic tree reconciliations proposed by LatTrans, HorizStory, and EEEP
Phylogenetic tree reconciliations proposed by LatTrans, HorizStory, and EEEP. Different sets of edit operations,
indicated by arrows marked A through E, are proposed to reconcile the reference tree (a) with either a rooted (b) or an
unrooted (c) test tree. As described in the main text, LatTrans proposes edits A and B, while HorizStory proposes these two
as well as the phantom sister edit C. EEEP with time constraints will propose edits A, B, D, and E, while removing the time constraint allows donation of genetic material from ancestor to descendant, which is analogous to edit C.
to partition the reference tree into regions of discordance,
which are reconciled internally with no LGT events permitted between regions. We also introduce the idea of tree
distance ratchets, where proposed SPR operations on a reference tree are only accepted if the resulting tree is more
similar to the test tree (under a strict ratchet), or at least as
similar (under a permissive ratchet). The partitioning of the
reference tree and the use of tree distance ratchets do not
always yield a complete solution set, but can reduce the
running time of the algorithm by several orders of magnitude. The EEEP algorithm has been developed to address
some of the problems outlined above, by considering
unrooted, possibly multifurcating test trees while imposing time constraints on edit operations that are implied by
a rooted reference tree. A precursor to EEEP was used to

extract edit paths from a set of 144 prokaryotic genomes
[9], with frequently observed edits assigned to 'highways'
of LGT between organisms. This precursor version lacked
many features that are implemented in the present release,
including the permissive ratchets described below, and
the ability to remove time constraints on edit operations,
which is now a core component of the ratchets. In the
analysis presented here, we use random trees to compare
the performance of EEEP to that of two other recent LGT
detection algorithms, and use EEEP to recover edit paths
for the large set of protein trees described in Beiko et al.
[9]. We compare the edit distances inferred from this data
set with similar distances derived from random trees to
assess the extent to which vertical or horizontal signal
dominates in the protein trees. Finally, examination of the

Effect of3 misplaced root on inferred edit paths
Effect of a misplaced root on inferred edit paths. Trees (a) and (b) are identical if the rooting of one or the other is
ignored, as would be the case in EEEP, and no edit path reconciliation is necessary. However, LatTrans and HorizStory, which
both require a rooted test tree, would be adversely affected by misplacement of the root, since four edits are required to reconcile trees (a) and (b) if the rooting is preserved.

distribution of phylogenetic distances spanned by
inferred LGT events is used to determine whether most or
all inferred events occur between closely related taxa (as
theory would suggest) or if long-distance transfers are also
implied.

Results and Discussion
Benchmarking of EEEP
The performance of EEEP was evaluated with both simulated and empirical data. Random rooted and unrooted
trees were generated and the performance (time taken and
number of edit paths returned) of EEEP was compared to
that of LatTrans and HorizStory for strictly bifurcating
trees.

The following example, illustrated in Figure 2, shows the
differences between the approaches of EEEP, HorizStory
and LatTrans, as applied to a reference tree (Figure 2a) and
corresponding rooted (Figure 2b) or unrooted (Figure 2c)
test trees. The differences between the trees may be
resolved by a single lateral transfer in a number of ways,
which are indicated with arrows in the figure. LatTrans
proposes transfer scenarios A and B: the parent edge of
leaf 4 donates to the parent edge of leaf 5, or vice versa.
HorizStory proposes three transfer scenarios, the first two
(A and B) as for LatTrans, and the third (scenario C) being
a phantom sister transfer. The phantom sister edge joins
the reference tree between the root and the pendant sub-

tree covering taxa 1, 4, and 5, and this edge donates to the
parent edge of leaf 1. The effect is to cut the parent edge of
leaf 1 and reattach it above leaves 4 and 5. Without the
phantom sister interpretation this would represent a
donation to descendant time violation. For EEEP with
time constraints, four solutions are found: A and B as in
LatTrans and HorizStory, and two further scenarios (D
and E) where the edge joining the root of the reference
tree to the pendant covering taxa 2 and 3 donates to the
parent edge of 1, and vice versa. LatTrans and HorizStory
do not propose these solutions, since scenarios D and E
lead to a reference tree with a misplaced root. A non-time
constrained EEEP search finds a further solution which
corresponds to scenario C, the phantom sister solution
found by HorizStory.
Another difference between the algorithms is the requirement that the test tree be rooted. An example of the effect
of root placement on path recovery is shown in Figure 3.
The reference (Figure 3a) and test (Figure 3b) trees differ
only in the positioning of the root, so EEEP, which does
not consider the rooting of the test tree, would not need
to produce an edit path at all. Conversely, LatTrans and
HorizStory would need to infer four sequential transfers
to reconcile the first tree with the second, since taxa T2
through T5 would all need to be transferred to the other
side of the root (the side containing taxon T6), one at a
time.

Random rooted binary phylogenetic trees were generated
for n taxa as follows. A bipartition on the integers from 1
to n was created by randomly cutting the list into two nonempty parts. This bipartition then represents the edges
adjacent to the root node of the tree being constructed.
Each of the two induced partitions was then randomly
split into two lists to create a further bipartitioning of
these sets. New bipartitions were then created recursively
by cutting elements of previously created bipartitions into
two sets until the bipartitions only consisted of singleton
elements. Thus the tree was created by starting at the root
and creating bipartitions (edges) until the leaf nodes were
reached.
Sets of transfers were then applied to the rooted binary
phylogenetic trees by choosing random donor and recipient edges to generate test trees. No attempt was made to
avoid time violations in generating these random edits. In
the case of EEEP the test trees were then unrooted. The leaf
and transfer combinations that were tested are shown in
Table 1: for each of these combinations, 10 reference and
test trees were generated, giving in total 320 reference and
test tree pairs tested. The programs were benchmarked on
a cluster of 2.0 GHz AMD Opteron computers running
Linux. Each process was limited to completing within 5
hours and using at most 3.9 GB of RAM.
Comparisons of the performance of EEEP, HorizStory and
LatTrans on recovering edit paths for varying numbers of
leaves and transfers in randomly generated trees are
shown in Table 1. For HorizStory the cases for which a
solution was not found were all due to reaching the time
limit of 5 hours. The maximum RAM used by HorizStory
was 432 MB. For EEEP, the limiting factor was RAM, with
no search taking more than 3 hours. LatTrans never
exceeded the RAM or time limits, and the small number of
cases where no solution was found were likely due to limits in the heuristics of the algorithm. Overall, LatTrans
found a solution in 99.4% of cases, HorizStory in 72.8%
and EEEP in 88.1%. LatTrans performed remarkably well
on every tree size, failing only in a small minority of cases

on the set of 100-taxon trees. HorizStory recovered an edit
path from every tree of size 5, 10, and 15, but many of the
edit paths in larger trees could not be recovered in less
than five hours.
The success of several different types of EEEP run, as well
as HorizStory and LatTrans, in recovering edit paths from
trees of various sizes is shown in Figure 4. EEEP runs performed without ratchets failed to recover edit paths from
many trees of size 15 or greater, with the worst performance obtained from runs that did not partition trees into
regions of discordance (see Methods) and those that did
not make use of time constraints. While the performance
of EEEP dropped with increasing tree size, the use of ratchets substantially improved the recovery of edit paths, with
the permissive test tree ratchet yielding a modest improvement over the standard EEEP run, and the strict ratchet
recovering paths from > 80% of all trees containing 75 or
fewer taxa, and 66% of all trees with 100 taxa. We assessed
the ability of each of the four types of ratchet to recover
the correct edit distance as determined by the unratcheted
runs. For tree comparisons in which the unratcheted run
returned a solution, each type of ratchet was able to
recover the correct edit distance from >90% of all data
sets, with both permissive ratchets yielding better accuracy
(97.1% for both reference and test tree distances) than the
strict reference tree (93.8%) and test tree (94.1%) ratchets.
Thus, the ratchets provide a considerable increase in
speed, with a small sacrifice of accuracy.
Phylogenomic analysis of 144 prokaryotic taxa
EEEP was also used to infer pathways of LGT by comparing a set of 22 432 protein test trees derived from the
microbial data set described in Beiko et al. [9], to a reference supertree constructed using the MRP algorithm [26]
and rooted to follow the (by no means universally
accepted) paradigm of Bacteria and Archaea as separate,
monophyletic domains [27-29]. These trees were inferred
from aligned, putatively orthologous sequences using version 3.04 beta of the MrBayes program [30], which samples from a likelihood distribution of trees and generates

a posterior probability estimate for each possible bipartitioning of taxa. We considered only those bipartitions
with a posterior probability (PP) of 0.95 or greater, which
immediately eliminated 2740 data sets from consideration, since the inferred trees for these sets had no bipartitions with support above this threshold. While some of
the differences between the protein trees and reference
supertree are likely due to violations of phylogenetic
assumptions or failure of ortholog mapping and sequence

alignment, an extensive set of statistical tests and parsimony analysis of insert/delete states were used in Beiko et
al. [9] to show that discordant trees were not simply a consequence of inadequate methods or biased sequenced
evolution.

runs: a) no constraint; b) a permissive test tree distance
ratchet; c) a strict test tree distance ratchet; d) a permissive
reference tree distance ratchet; and e) a strict reference tree
distance ratchet. These runs were constrained to run
within 4 GB of RAM, and the success rate of each method
in recovering a solution was assessed. The edit distance
and path properties of inferred protein trees were compared with similar properties of randomly generated trees.
In the majority of cases, EEEP runs of even the largest data
sets completed in less than 30 minutes, either successfully
returning a set of edit paths, or reaching the imposed
memory limit and terminating.
Figure 5 shows the success rate of five different types of
EEEP run, with varying levels of constraint on the accept-

ance of edit operations. Only the permissive reference tree
ratchet did not recover most-parsimonious edit paths for
every protein tree of size 4â10, failing to return a solution
for 12 out of 796 ten-taxon protein trees. In every other
pooled set, the strict ratchets returned solutions for the
largest percentage of protein trees, while the unconstrained runs were least successful in recovering edit
paths. There is a tendency toward the recovery of fewer
edit solutions from larger data sets, but the recovery rate
from protein trees of size 101â144 (33%â65%) was actually better than for protein trees of size 51â100 (28%â
51%). An edit path was recovered by at least one method
in 19 544 of 19 672 cases. As mentioned above, memory
consumption, rather than computational time, was the

of genes has influenced genome evolution in the represented taxa. Simulations of random LGT events via multiple SPR permutations can be used to distinguish empirical
trees from random trees, since the former should only
approximate the latter when LGT is rampant and sufficiently random [31]. Thus, if random LGT events dominate a given dataset, then the SPR distance between any
inferred tree and the reference tree should be similar to the
average distance between pairs of random trees. If vertical
inheritance (or some other cohesive signal) dominates in
a set of inferred trees, then the number of edit paths
observed should be smaller. To assess the significance of

the average similarity between reference and test trees, we
should know the distribution of edit distances between
pairs of random trees. The average distance between a pair
of trees is not known, though Song [32] presents a formula for the number of trees that are separated from a
given tree by a single SPR operation. We must therefore
resort to building an empirical distribution from random
pairs of trees. Another problem is the bias toward nonrecovery of edit paths from larger trees will yield underestimates of mean edit distance for these sets. Consequently,
we performed comparisons between many pairs of random trees to generate a background distribution of edit
distances between trees, and concentrated on trees with
15 or fewer taxa, in a range where EEEP was able to recover
edit path solutions for every protein tree tested above. Figure 6 shows the mean edit path length recovered for each
size class of protein trees, compared to the maximum pos-

sible edit path length (= n - 3) and the mean edit path
length recovered from comparisons between 500 pairs of
random trees. For comparisons between random trees,
each unit increase in taxon size yields an increase of 0.675
in average edit distance (R2 = 0.998). When protein trees
of size 4 to 15 are considered, each unit increase yields an
increase of only 0.087 in average edit distance (R2 =
0.968). Extending the model to include protein trees of
sizes 16 to 100 yields a similar slope (0.080), with a
reduced linear fit coefficient of 0.656 due to instability in
mean estimates for larger protein tree sizes. Since the
slope of this relationship between inferred protein trees is
approximately 1/8 of the equivalent relationship between
random trees, it is clear that there is a strong cohesive,
likely vertical, signal in the protein trees.
Tree edits induced by an SPR operation can implicate lineages that are separated by any number of internal
branches. This concept of 'short' versus 'long' edits is captured in measures such as the nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI) distance [33-35], but must be assessed

indirectly in the case of SPR operations. The count or total
length of internal branches separating the donor and
recipient lineages can be used to assess the 'length' of an
edit operation [36]. For a fixed number of edits, the
number of regions of discordance and other tree distance
measures can be used as well: long-distance edits will tend
to overlap, yielding fewer and larger regions of discordance, and bipartition-based measures such as the Robinson-Foulds distance will be larger due to the greater
number of bipartitions disrupted by edit operations. Figure 7 shows the normalized reference tree distance
(number of discordant reference tree bipartitions divided
by the count of discordant and concordant reference tree
bipartitions) for several combinations of tree size and
number of edits, for inferred protein trees and the randomly permuted trees described earlier in "Benchmarking
of EEEP" above. While the average normalized reference
tree distance is invariably larger in the set of randomly
permuted trees, there is a wide distribution of normalized
distances in both types of tree, evidenced by the large
standard deviations associated with each group. If Î± =

Figure destruction for two pairs of six-taxon trees
Trails of8
Trails of destruction for two pairs of six-taxon trees. Two pairs of reference and test trees are shown: in both cases,
the test tree is the consequence of two edit operations on the corresponding reference tree. The edits are indicated with
boldface arrows, with the arrowhead pointing to the recipient lineage. The trails of destruction are composed of the edges in
each reference or test tree which imply bipartitionings of taxa that are incompatible with the other tree. These incompatible
edges are drawn with dashed lines in the figure, and the endpoints indicated with filled circles. In Figure 8a, there are four endpoints on the trail of destruction, thus identifying the minimum number of edit operations as 2. The trail in Figure 8b has only
two endpoints, so in this case the minimal edit distance of 1 suggested by the endpoints is not the correct number of edits.

0.05 is used as the cutoff for statistical significance, and
divided by ten to yield a Bonneferroni-corrected threshold
of 0.005, then in only three out of ten classes (15 taxa / 2
edits, 20 taxa / 2 edits, and 30 taxa / 2 edits) is the difference between experimental and random trees statistically
significant. Thus, edits inferred from protein trees tend to
be 'shorter' on average than randomly induced edits, but
there is considerable overlap between the distributions of
the two sets. There is a similar tendency of random edits
to associate into fewer regions of discordance. When trees
with > 1 edit (and therefore potentially > 1 region of discordance) were considered, in all cases a majority of trees
contained only a single discordant region. However, a
larger minority of protein trees contained multiple
regions of discordance (typically 30â50%) than did the
randomly permuted trees (typically 10â20%). This observation is consistent with the ability of EEEP to recover edit
path solutions for very large protein trees with > 10 edits,
due to partitioning of the tree into multiple regions of discordance, while randomly permuted trees of a similar size
often could not be resolved.

tion in each protein tree. For the 3714 protein trees with
an edit distance of 1 relative to the supertree, the result is
trivial: a single edit operation on a reference tree induces
a trail of destruction containing exactly two endpoints,
with the donor and recipient lineages at opposite ends of
the chain. Each of these trees must therefore contain a single linear trail. Each subsequent edit operation can
increase the number of endpoints by 0, 1, or 2 with
respect to the original reference tree, so among protein
trees with an edit distance D â¥ 2, the number of endpoints
is bounded by 2 and 2D. If 2D or 2D - 1 endpoints are
observed in comparing a reference with a test tree, then D
is guaranteed to be the minimal edit distance. Of the 2062
protein trees with D â¥ 2, 873 (42.3%) could be confirmed
as minimal edit paths with this approach. Two simple
examples of trails of destruction from overlapping edit
operations are shown in Figure 8: an example where the
number of endpoints is equal to 2D (Figure 8a), and a
case where the endpoint count is equal only to D (Figure
8b).

Conclusion
While inferred protein trees showed a high degree of similarity (characterized by low edit distance) to a reference
supertree, the number of internal edges spanned by
inferred edit operations was only marginally shorter than
those generated under a random model. While statistical
and biological hypotheses tend to predict 'local' topological rearrangements (characterized by low NNI distance),
in our data set we frequently inferred LGT events between
prokaryotic phyla and between the bacterial and archaeal
domains. The dissimilarity between orthologous
sequences from different phyla precludes homologous
recombination, which requires a high degree of sequence
similarity, so these transfers require illegitimate recombination to integrate the donor DNA into the recipient
genome [37-40]. The existence of these transfers is supported by phylogenetic profile analysis, which shows a
patchy distribution for many sets of genes that cannot be
explained through loss alone.
Relationship between discordant bipartitions and edit
distance
When an SPR operation is performed on a reference tree,
the internal edges in the original tree that connect the
donor and recipient taxa will be incompatible with edges
in the derived tree, since the bipartitions of taxa implied
by these edges are not found in the new tree. This chain of
internal edges defines a 'trail of destruction' that can be
used to set minimum bounds on the number of edit operations needed to reconcile the two trees (described in
detail in Methods). For each protein tree that could be reconciled with the reference tree by EEEP, we compared the
minimum edit distance recovered by EEEP with the total
number of endpoints associated with the trails of destruc-

All three algorithms tested here on random trees were limited to some extent by computational resources: the
amount of RAM was typically limiting for EEEP, and running time for HorizStory. LatTrans is extremely fast and
efficient relative to the other algorithms, but its requirement of strictly bifurcating, rooted trees makes it an inappropriate choice for phylogenomic analyses. The most
straightforward approach to increasing the range of problems that can be resolved with EEEP is through the use of
faster computers with more memory, and parallelization.
However, the 'trails of destruction' give interesting clues
about the nature and number of SPR operations that are
required, and should be considered as a possible source of
new ways to refine the search for most-parsimonious edit
paths.
We have used EEEP to reconcile a reference supertree comprising 144 organisms with 19 672 microbial protein trees
as part of a large phylogenetic study [9]. Not surprisingly,
for these data the inferred protein trees were far more similar to each other and to the reference supertree than were
randomly generated pairs of reference and test trees. This
similarity reflects cohesive signal in the inferred protein
trees that is congruent with the organismal history, e.g.
'vertical' inheritance from parent to offspring. Since vertical signal dominates in this data set, there is no evidence
that LGT has destroyed the organismal signature that
should be evident in sequence phylogenies. As statistical
tests and corrections for violations of basic phylogenetic
assumptions improve [28,41-44], and as hypotheses
about the 'transferability' of different types of gene are
refined [2,7,9,45], the underlying organismal history ini-

tially suggested by 16S rRNA analysis and refined using
other data sets should solidify.
Final words â interpreting edit paths
A final challenge in the inference of edit paths is the interpretation of multiple, equally parsimonious edit paths.
The most frequent examples of multiple edit paths
involve simple permutations of the same set of edits,
which imply that there is no time constraint on the order
in which those edits can occur. Also common are symmetrical exchanges, where a gene transfer event involving two
taxa yields the same effect on tree topology regardless of
which taxon is the donor and which the recipient. In these
cases, information about the partners obligately involved
in the exchange may be clear, and interpretable in light of
hypotheses about preferential gene sharing between
organisms, but the direction of transfer cannot be deduced
solely from the tree topology. Finally, a given comparison
of trees can produce multiple edit paths that suggest partially overlapping or non-overlapping sets of transfer partners. These cases typically identify a small set of possible
exchange partners, but fail to uniquely identify each pair
of taxa participating in a transfer. Analysis of large sets of
obligate and possible transfers can reveal trends that correspond to 'highways' of gene sharing [9], but conclusions
about the sharing history of individual genes may be
unclear.

Can other information be used to uniquely identify the
donor and recipient implicated in an LGT event? While
EEEP, HorizStory and LatTrans consider only the branching order of phylogenetic trees, other features of the trees
and the underlying sequences can potentially convey useful information as well. If genome-to-genome 'distances'
are implied either in the reference tree or through some
other method, then sequence-to-sequence distances that
are much shorter than expected may identify the partners
in a recent genetic transfer event. This type of assessment
relies on the assumption that sequences have evolved in a
clock-like fashion, which may be frequently violated if
transferred sequences evolve more rapidly in the recipient
genome due to amelioration pressures or functional
duplication [46]. The topological analysis performed by
EEEP may also be complemented by the use of surrogate
methods which consider the deviation of residue composition within a gene from that of the 'background' genome
sequence [45-47]. Most of these methods can be applied
to a single genome, so the detection of recently acquired
sequences is not dependent on having a relative of the
donor sampled as well. However, since these methods
typically rely on genomic sequence bias to generate a null
distribution, they are particularly sensitive to amelioration [46] and the overlap among the predictions of different methods is quite poor [48]. Given the evidence that
different surrogate methods may detect different types of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/15

LGT events, or events of different ages [49], the best strategy is to carefully consider the results of several different
approaches.

Methods
Tree features
We require a method to compare a rooted binary reference
tree and an unrooted multifurcating test tree to test when
they are topologically congruent. The approach taken by
EEEP is to consider the bipartitions induced by the edges of
reference and test trees. The key to topological comparisons is the subdivision of reference tree bipartitions into
those that are concordant and discordant with respect to
the test tree. A reference tree bipartition splits the set of
taxa T into two sets A = {A1, A2, ..., Am}, and B = {B1, B2,
..., Bn}. This bipartition is concordant if a bipartition exists
within the test tree which implies the exact same split of
taxa, with the exception of those taxa that are not present
in the test tree. The reference bipartition is discordant if
both sets of taxa implied by one or more test tree bipartitions contain representatives of set A and set B. A reference
tree bipartition may be neither concordant nor discordant
if the test tree contains multifurcating nodes, and none of
the supported test tree bipartitions satisfy the criteria for
concordance or discordance. The goal of EEEP is to reconcile a reference tree with a test tree by performing SPR
operations on the reference tree until no discordant bipartitions remain, and it is completely consistent with the test
tree.

An LGT event is the donation of genetic material from a
donor lineage in the tree to a recipient lineage, and is represented in our diagrams with an arrow connecting the
two lineages that participate in the transfer operation. The
consequent SPR operation merges the recipient and donor
lineages, which subdivides the donor edge (E4 in Figure 1)
into a descendent edge which implies the same bipartitioning as the donor, and an ancestral edge that is the parent of the new merged donor-recipient clade (E(3+4) in
Figure 1). The parent edge of the old recipient (E0 in Figure
1) is lost. Every other bipartition corresponding to an edge
that is ancestral exclusively to either the donor or the
recipient is modified, as the recipient clade is exchanged
between the two bipartitions implied by these edges. The
bipartitions induced by the donor and recipient edges,
and any of their descendants, are not affected by the SPR
event, nor are any edges ancestral to the common ancestor
of the donor and the recipient edges. A special case of the
SPR event occurs when the donor and recipient taxa are
already sisters. While LGT is likely to be most common
between closely related genomes due to the propensity of
similar DNA sequences toward homologous recombination, such events have no impact on the resulting phylogenetic tree and as such cannot be detected using
topological comparisons. Since they are unproductive,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:15

SPR operations between sister taxa are prohibited by
EEEP.
A consequence of comparing many test trees to a single
organismal reference is that many or all of the test trees
may contain only a subset of the taxa that are covered by
the reference tree. In such cases, the reference tree must be
projected by removing taxa that are not represented in the
test tree, and consolidating the edges that confer the same
information as a result. For instance, if a test tree containing only taxa T1 - T6 was compared to the reference tree
shown in Figure 1a, then removal of T7 from the reference
tree would eliminate edge E11, and edges E5 and E10 would
describe the same bipartitioning of taxa. In such a case, E5
and E10 would be collapsed into an equivalence class,
since operations involving one of these edges would yield
the exact same tree topology as operations involving the
other.
Another important feature of trees induced by one or
more LGT events is the set of discordant bipartitions. Suppose we have a reference tree and a test tree on the same
set of leaves for which there have been no lateral transfer
events. In this case the reference tree and the test tree will
be identical. Now suppose there is a reference tree as in
Figure 1 and that a single gene transfer event has occurred
between two edges. The edges in the original reference tree
that are inconsistent with the resulting gene tree are
exactly those on the unique path between the edges
involved in the transfer. Similarly, the discordant edges in
the test tree are those on the path between the donor and
recipient points. Hence an LGT event leaves a 'trail of
destruction' of discordant edges in the reference and test
trees.
If we were given any reference tree and a test tree for which
the discordant edges in the reference tree formed a single
chain it would be evident that at least one transfer event
would be required to reconcile the differences between
the trees, and if it were indeed a single transfer event then
it must have occurred from and to the ends of the chain.
More generally the sub-graph on discordant edges of the
reference tree can yield information on the minimum
number of transfers required to reconcile the reference
and test trees. If the discordant edge subgraph forms a single component, then it follows immediately that the
number of transfers required is at least the number of
degree 1 nodes (leaves) of the discordant subgraph
divided by 2. This is illustrated in Figure 8, where the discordant edges are drawn with dashed lines. There are 4
degree 1 nodes in Figure 8a and 2 such nodes in Figure 8b,
hence the minimum number of LGT events is 4/2 = 2 in
the first case and 2/2 = 1 in the second. Most generally, if
the discordant edge subgraph has multiple components,
under the assumption that transfer events have not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/15

occurred between components, then the minimum
number of transfer events is again at least the number of
degree 1 nodes of the discordant subgraph divided by 2.
The EEEP distribution contains software that will draw a
reference/test tree pair, and indicate which edges in each
are discordant, to highlight these 'trails of destruction'.
Constraints on SPR operations
The length of all possible most-parsimonious edit paths
between any pair of strictly bifurcating trees covering n
taxa is between zero and (n - 3) [20]. While the scaling of
the longest possible most-parsimonious edit path is linear
with the number of taxa, the number of possible mostparsimonious edit paths is proportional to the number of
possible trees. A tree with n taxa contains n terminal edges
and (n - 3) internal edges, with an additional edge
induced if the tree is rooted: for instance, the tree in Figure
1a has a total edge count Îµ of (7 + 4 + 1) = 12. If no constraints are placed on the choice of donor and recipient
edges, then a total of Îµ(Îµ -1) distinct SPR operations can be
carried out on any given tree, reflecting the total number
of donor/recipient pairs than can be chosen. In the case of
the seven-taxon tree in Figure 1a, a total of (12 Ã 11)4 =
303595776 edit paths of length 4 can be generated. Constraints on the set of proposed SPR operations must be
used to resolve all but the most trivial problems in reasonable time. In EEEP, the edit path determination is carried
out in a breadth-first fashion, where candidate SPR operations are performed on the current modified version(s)
of the reference tree with an edit path of length l before
any paths of length l + 1 are considered. In the absence of
any knowledge of the total length of the most-parsimonious edit path(s), the breadth-first search is necessary to
avoid performing more SPR operations than are necessary
in any given edit path.

Two restrictions have a modest impact on the number of
cases that must be considered. The first, mentioned above,
is the prohibition of transfers between edges that are sisters in the original or modified reference tree, since such
transfers yield no change in the tree topology when
branch lengths are not considered. Secondly, in an edit
path of length > 1, the same edge cannot act as recipient
in multiple SPR operations, since the effect of the first
such SPR event would be most parsimoniously explained
by a single transfer event.
The number of tree and bipartition comparisons that
needs to be considered can be considerably reduced by
identifying and eliminating regions of the reference tree
that will definitely not occur in the most-parsimonious
edit path, and by partitioning the tree into regions of discordance which will not be bridged by SPR operations.
After zero or more edits, each derived reference tree topology is compared to the test tree to determine whether any

Ratchets based on reference tree distance
Ratchets based on reference tree distance. Comparison of a rooted reference tree (a) with an unrooted test tree (b)
shows that five internal edges in the reference tree imply bipartitionings of taxa that are not consistent with the test tree (note
that since they imply the exact same bipartition, the two edges connected to the root of the reference tree only contribute a
single count), corresponding to a reference tree distance of 5. Two SPR operations that could be proposed by EEEP are indicated with dashed arrows: the resulting modified reference trees are indicated for arrow number 1 in panel (c), and for arrow
number 2 in panel (d). These two trees have reference tree distances of 4 and 3 respectively from the test tree, and are therefore not treated equally if a ratchet is being used. Under a permissive ratchet, both edits would be accepted and used for subsequent SPR moves, because both yielded a decrease in the overall reference tree distance. However, under a strict ratchet,
only the edit that yielded a reference tree distance of 3 would be accepted, because it yielded the largest decrease in reference
tree distance.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:15

concordant pendant edges are present. Allen and Steel
[20] showed that for unrooted binary trees, any pendant
subtrees that are completely concordant can be excluded
from further SPR operations in searching for the SPR distance (though not necessarily the complete set of paths),
and the same result holds for unrooted multifurcating
trees. If such edges are observed, the entire set of bipartitions and taxa in the subtree are replaced with a single
taxon representing the entire group, which reduces the
number of comparisons that are necessary. In some cases,
the reference tree can also be cut into two or more
'regions' if the discordant edges are interspersed with concordant ones. A given region will have either a concordant
edge or the root of the tree as its last common ancestor,
and concordant edges (which may be terminal and subtend only single taxa) as its descendants. By prohibiting
SPR exchanges where the donor and recipient are from
different regions of the tree, the number of edit operations
that needs to be considered can be reduced dramatically.
However, partitioning the tree in this manner yields a
final edit path solution that may not be complete: some
alternatives among the most-parsimonious set of edit
paths for unusual trees may in fact implicate donor and
recipient lineages from different regions of discordance.
The time constraints implied by a rooted tree can be used
to constrain the set of legal donor/recipient pairs. If a
given edge has been either the donor or recipient in an
SPR operation (and thus implicitly participated in an LGT
event), the ancestors of that edge are prevented from participating in subsequent SPR operations, since this order
of events would imply that a transfer event between a pair
of ancestors occurred after an exchange between their
descendants. Similarly, donor/recipient pairs where one
edge is an ancestor of the other are prohibited, since transfers must occur between contemporary genomes. However, this last restriction can be relaxed in EEEP, because
an SPR event where the donor is an ancestor of the recipient could imply a contemporary donor or "phantom sister" [25] that is not represented in the reference or test
trees, due either to limited sampling or extinction. Unlike
the donor taxon, the recipient or one of its descendants
must be present in the tree for the transfer event to be
detected.
There are many ways to express the degree of difference
between a pair of trees. Any of these measures (save the
edit distance itself) can be used to assess whether a modified reference tree obtained after an edit operation is more
or less similar to the test tree than the pre-modification
tree. Two types of ratchet can be imposed: a weaker or
'permissive' constraint that prohibits edits which fail to
yield increased similarity between the reference and test
trees, and a 'strict' constraint that permits only the best
(i.e., most-similar) trees from the current round to be con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/15

sidered in the next round of operations. None of these
ratchets has yet been proven to yield an optimal and complete set of solutions (and many clearly do not), but in
practice they usually yield a substantial increase in computational efficiency and a solution set that is identical to
a ratchet-free run. Also, as mentioned previously, by
counting terminal nodes in the discordant edge subgraphs, in many circumstances we can be sure of having
found a shortest edit path. Two types of ratchet are currently implemented in EEEP: the test tree bipartition distance counts the number of bipartitions from the test tree
that are discordant with the current reference tree, and the
reference tree bipartition distance counts the number of
bipartitions from the reference tree that are discordant
with the current test tree. An example of the reference tree
distance ratchet is shown in Figure 9. If a ratchet is used,
then the time constraints above must be temporarily discarded, since the SPR operations that yield the best
improvement in tree similarity may not necessarily occur
earlier in the tree (closer to the root) than later operations.
Under a time constraint and a ratchet, performing the best
move first could preclude subsequent moves closer to the
root that yield lesser (but still necessary) improvements.
Consequently edit path determination is carried out without the time constraint, but any edit paths obtained at the
end are permuted to determine whether a solution does
exist that is legal in time.
