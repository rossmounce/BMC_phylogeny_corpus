Abstract
Background: Experimental verification of gene products has not kept pace with the rapid growth
of microbial sequence information. However, existing annotations of gene locations contain
sufficient information to screen for probable errors. Furthermore, comparisons among genomes
become more informative as more genomes are examined. We studied all open reading frames
(ORFs) of at least 30 codons from the genomes of 27 sequenced bacterial strains. We grouped the
potential peptide sequences encoded from the ORFs by forming Clusters of Orthologous Groups
(COGs). We used this grouping in order to find homologous relationships that would not be
distinguishable from noise when using simple BLAST searches. Although COG analysis was initially
developed to group annotated genes, we applied it to the task of grouping anonymous DNA
sequences that may encode proteins.
Results: "Mixed COGs" of ORFs (clusters in which some sequences correspond to annotated
genes and some do not) are attractive targets when seeking errors of gene predicion. Examination
of mixed COGs reveals some situations in which genes appear to have been missed in current
annotations and a smaller number of regions that appear to have been annotated as gene loci
erroneously. This technique can also be used to detect potential pseudogenes or sequencing
errors. Our method uses an adjustable parameter for degree of conservation among the studied
genomes (stringency). We detail results for one level of stringency at which we found 83 potential
genes which had not previously been identified, 60 potential pseudogenes, and 7 sequences with
existing gene annotations that are probably incorrect.
Conclusion: Systematic study of sequence conservation offers a way to improve existing
annotations by identifying potentially homologous regions where the annotation of the presence
or absence of a gene is inconsistent among genomes.

Background
The rapidly growing amount of genomic sequence information necessitates tools for its annotation. Although predicting bacterial genes is in many ways simpler than

predicting eukaryotic genes, it is clear that there remains
room for improvement in the bacterial case. Several
groups have undertaken efforts to re-annotate specific
genomes [1-3], often finding a small but significant

number of errors in existing annotation of gene loci. The
presence of these errors has motivated the effort of some
groups to systematically revise the gene annotations in
public databases as a continuous process [4,5].
Because technology for genome sequencing is much more
mature than proteomic analysis, only a small fraction of
annotated bacterial gene products have been detected as
protein; most have been annotated using only computational methods. Although methods for detecting and
identifying all proteins in a cell are being developed
[3,6,7] and incorporated into annotations of newlysequenced genomes [8], these techniques are currently
limited by the ability to express all of the polypeptides in
an organism and separate them into fractions with low
enough complexity for analysis. It is still useful to refine
our computational predictions so that we can make targeted searches for potential proteins.
Accuracy of gene identification is particularly important
in studies of the gene content of a genome as a whole.
Studies of phyletic patterns of gene presence [9], the
extent of horizontal gene transfer among genomes, the
entire set of protein structures encoded by a genome [10],
and the components of a "minimal genome" [11,12] are
all predicated on an accurate catalog of the genes within
an organism. Because these studies involve comparing the
presence or absence of genes among several organisms, it
is particularly important that all of the genes present be
identified. Insights in these areas of study could impact
our understanding of bacterial evolution physiology and
pathogenicity. As an example, in the initial report of the
Mycoplasma mobile genome sequence the correlation of
presence or absence of certain genes with a presence or
absence of a specific phenotypic characteristic (motility)
among nine species was used to suggest genes which
might confer that phenotype [8].
Methods for predicting protein-coding genes are often
divided into intrinsic and extrinsic classes [13,14]. Intrinsic
methods only use evidence from within the primary
sequence of a genome. This evidence may include i) the
presence of a relatively long frame uninterrupted by a stop
codon, ii) the statistical pattern of polynucleotide
stretches that match the typical frequencies present in
other coding regions of the organism and iii) the existence
of appropriate non-coding control elements. It may be
difficult to identify some small genes using the first two
types of evidence; small genes can be difficult to distinguish from open reading frames that occur by chance, and
in such short regions, sequence characteristics may be
affected stochastically. Gene finding methods which use
sequence characteristics or control elements often need to
be tuned for the specific organism studied, and in many

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/31

cases several statistical models of coding regions may need
to be developed in a single organism [15].
Extrinsic methods use information from comparisons of
genomes. These analyses originally used simple pairwise
comparisons among potential protein-coding regions.
Harrison et al. [16] examined ORFs of 15 or more codons
in 65 microbial genome sequences, using BLAST E-value
of less than 10-4 to indicate similarity suggestive of conserved function. Other searches use sequence alignments
of a protein family as a query against all possible translations of the genome of interest. This alignment may be
specified beforehand (e.g. using a Pfam protein family) or
developed as part of the search as by PSI-BLAST [17]. Pair
hidden Markov models use a pairwise sequence alignment coupled to a hidden Markov model to more precisely determine the amino termini of protein-coding
genes [18]. Programs have been developed that use pairwise alignment of syntenic regions to predict gene structure in eukaryotes [19]. The ratio of synonymous to
nonsynonymous substitutions between pairs of putative
genes can be used to examine whether there is selection
for protein-coding function, but this requires sequences
from closely related organisms [20]. The majority of bacterial genome annotations have used intrinsic methods at
least initially to predict the presence of genes. Extrinsic
gene prediction methods serve as a useful complement to
intrinsic methods because independent information is
used to make the same prediction.
In this study we describe a systematic extension to examining similarity shared among several genomes using a
modification of the analysis of Clusters of Orthologous
Groups (COGs). COGs were developed to cluster annotated genes into functionally related groups in order to
facilitate the transfer of functional annotations among
organisms [21]. Here we use COGs to cluster open reading
frames as a means of recognizing genes. An advantage of
the COG analysis is that no explicit threshold for
sequence similarity is used; genes that are missed in pairwise comparisons may be detected. Because the focus is
on annotation of gene location rather than gene function,
we are not concerned with finding genes that are strictly
orthologous. Evidence of homology to another gene is
sufficient to imply that a region is a gene, and we make no
effort to avoid the joining of COGs which may occur due
to a gene fusion [22]. The idea of stringency [23] of COGs
expands upon the initial COG definition by requiring an
adjustable of connectedness for grouping genes. As the
number of studied organisms increases, the stringency can
further filter some similarities which may have occurred
by chance. ORFs that do not correspond to annotated
genes but that nonetheless have conserved sequences
present in several genomes are likely to be protein-coding
genes that have been missed by current annotations.

and annotated genes reference Genome Reviews version 25.0

A cluster of ORFs can be examined with regards to its multiple sequence alignment, the network of similarities
among the ORFs, and the respective genomic contexts of
the ORFs in the cluster. These characteristics of ORF clusters can be used to screen existing gene predictions for
potential errors. The extrinsic nature of the use of COGs of
ORFs is complementary to the intrinsic methods that have
been used in producing the majority of gene loci annotations. Because our strategy has different strengths and
weaknesses from the intrinsic methods, it may be
expected to pick up some genes that other methods have
missed.
In this study we examined open reading frames from the
complete genome sequences of 27 bacteria (Table 1). We
selected these genome sequences for the following reasons. M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae are model systems
for defining the minimal cellular genome. Consequently,
their proteins became the focus of research at the Berkeley
Structural Genomics Center [10,24]. Other members of
the class Mollicutes provide a closely related set which
may help identify genes specific to this class. The protein
products of M. pneumoniae and M. mobile have been
recently studied using high-throughput identification

using multidimensional chromatography and mass spectrometry [3,8]. We included other small-genome parasitic
bacteria to study the extent to which gene content has convergently evolved among this group. We also included a
more diverse selection of bacterial genome sequences
from major phylogenetic groups to see how robust our
strategy would be when examining distantly related
organisms.
We wanted to detect fragments of genes and genes which
use start codons other than ATG, so we used a very general
definition of an ORF: any frame of length at least 30
codons (90nucleotides) uninterrupted by stop codons.
The software developed as part of this study, SPROCKET,
can be used to detect probable errors in existing gene
annotations.

Gene discovery using conservation of potential peptide

Extrinsic gene-finding methods are based on the duality
that, given sufficient evolutionary distance, conserved
sequences are likely to be functional and that functional
sequences are likely to be conserved. The conserved

Gene prediction based on sequence conservation
Gene prediction based on sequence conservation. (A) and (B) show receiver-operator characteristic curves summarizing the sensitivity and specificity of gene prediction based on COG membership when compared to the current gene annotations. In (A), an ORF is classified as a gene if it is conserved in a COG at a certain stringency; for (B), the ORF must be in a
COG that contains at least one annotated gene from another species. Curves are produced by examining COGs at different
stringencies. At stringency 2, tests are very sensitive but not very specific (points at upper right of each panel). As stringency
increases, specificity increases and sensitivity decreases (indicated by arrow). For clarity, full ROC curves are shown for only
seven of the organisms studied, and for the pooled result among all of the organisms studied. The plotting symbols and colors
used in (A) and (B) are next to the organism names in (C). (C) shows the areas under the curves in (A) black bars and (B) grey
bars. The ROC curve of a perfect test would enclose an area of 1, for a completely arbitrary test the area would be 0.5. The
organisms in (C) are ordered by the area under the ROC curve in (B).
regions may represent control elements or may encode
functional RNA molecules or proteins. We examined the
extent to which multi-species sequence conservation
could be used to detect the presence of protein-coding

genes. We considered two systems for classifying ORFs as
genes or not-genes. The first system was based solely on
existence of a COG containing the ORF. If we determined
that an ORF was a member of a COG then we classified it

Presence of annotated genes in COGs of ORFs
Presence of annotated genes in COGs of ORFs. Open
reading frames (ORFs) of at least 90 nucleotides between
stop codons were used to construct COGs at varying stringencies as described in the methods. COGs were divided
into one of three groups: "All members match annotated
genes" â contain only ORFs which correspond to annotated
genes, "No members match annotated genes" â contain no
ORFs which match annotated genes, or "Mixed" â contain
some ORFs that correspond to annotated genes and some
that do not. The numbers of ORFs in COGs of each of these
classes are plotted along the y-axis with a logarithmic scale.

as a gene, otherwise we classified it as not being a gene.
Our second classification system used existing gene annotations for all genomes except the one containing the ORF
to be classified, reducing the number of false positives. In
this system we classified an ORF as a gene if we found it in
a COG containing at least one ORF from another genome
that was annotated as a gene. In both systems the COG
stringency controlled the extent of conservation required
for
classification.
We compared these gene predictions to existing gene
annotations
using
sensitivity/specificity
analysis.
Although there are errors in existing gene annotations (as
discussed below) the current annotations represent the
expert consensus. Sensitivity for a gene classification system is the number of correct gene predictions divided by
the number of actual genes. The specificity is the number
of true negative predictions divided by the total number
of non-genes.
Sensitivity and specificity of gene predictions varied at different stringency levels of the COGs used in classification.
The accuracies of both classification systems are summarized in Figure 1. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC)
plots show the true positive rate (sensitivity) along the
vertical axis against the false positive rate (1-specificity)
along the horizontal axis. An ideal test (when compared

to an ideal "gold standard") would be represented by a
point plotted in the upper-left corner (0,1). Figures 1A
and 1B show the classifications based solely on COG
membership and based on COG membership with an
annotated gene from another organism, respectively. Each
point plotted on this graph represents the sensitivity and
specificity of classification at a given stringency. ROC
curves are shown for a sample of seven of the genome
sequences studied and for the pooled results for all of the
genomes. The accuracy of tests for each genome sequence
and pooled results for all of the genome sequences are
summarized across COG stringencies by the area under
the ROC plots (Figure 1C). The sensitivity and specificity
values for all of the studied genomes were computed [see
Additional file 1].
"Mixed" COGs
COGs formed from ORFs can also be used to mine existing gene location annotation for potential errors. COGs in
which there are some ORFs that correspond to annotated
genes and other ORFs that do not correspond to annotated genes represent potential anomalies in existing
annotations. The number of these mixed COGs at different stringencies is shown in Figure 2. Also shown in Figure
2 are the number of COGs at each stringency level which
contain only ORFs which correspond to annotated genes
("all matches") or which contain no ORFs which correspond to annotated genes ("no matches"). The initial
increase in numbers of COGs when moving from stringency two (single-linkage clusters) to three is the result of
larger, weakly connected COGs splitting into several
smaller COGs. As stringency increases beyond three, the
number of COGs in each group decreases exponentially.
The "all matches" and "mixed" classes have similar connectedness structures in that the numbers of COGs in
these classes decay at similar rates. The number of COGs
in the "no matches" class drops more rapidly because the
less well-conserved or connected sets of ORFs that may
not be conserved due to protein-coding function are not
present at higher stringencies.
Screening existing gene predictions for errors
Mixed COGs are attractive targets when looking for errors
in existing gene predictions. We examined the genomic
context and peptide sequence alignments of the mixed
COGs of stringency six to explain the inconsistency of
gene annotation within these COGs. In COGs where the
majority of ORFs correspond to annotated genes, the
remaining ORFs are likely to represent missed genes or
pseudogenes. At stringency six there are 147 mixed COGs
in which the majority of ORFs correspond to annotated
genes (Table 2). At this stringency every member of a COG
is in a bidirectional best-hit relationship with at least six
other ORFs in the COG. These COGs contain 143 ORFs
that are not associated with annotated genes. Some of the

length present in two different strands; however the opposite strand had previously been chosen as coding.
In 60 (of 143) cases comparison of gene lengths to ORF
lengths indicates that the ORFs that are not annotated as
genes may be pseudogenes (Table 3); most have
frameshifts but some have nonsense mutations. 20 of
these are annotated as pseudogenes in Genome Reviews
25.0 [4,25]. It is possible that some of the apparent nonsense or frameshift mutations may be due to sequencing
errors.

For COGs in which the majority of members do not correspond to annotated genes, the preponderance of evidence suggests that sequence conservation can be better
explained by reasons other than protein coding of the
ORF. At stringency 6 there are 12 of this type of COG
among the organisms we studied, representing 11 distinct
annotated genes (Table 4). The presence of a conserved
ORF of length sufficient to be a potential gene may be
explained by the presence of a gene in the opposite strand.
This is particularly likely in species such as those of the
Mollicutes class that do not use UGA as a stop codon. In

these organisms, the exclusion of TAA and TAG in the
actual coding frame can be associated with a relative
shortage of TAn codons in the opposite strand, leading to
ORFs of substantial length on the non-coding strand. This
was the case for 7 of the 11, and we predict that the previous annotations are erroneous. Three of the annotated
genes in majority-unannotated COGs overlap regions that
appear to encode non-translated RNA genes. The constraints of the RNA genes may have reduced the probability of occurrence of stop codons in the region, which lead
to ORFs of sufficient length that they have been annotated
as hypothetical genes in previous annotations.
Possible pseudogenes as listed in Table 3 can be resequenced to evaluate whether there is in fact an underlying sequencing error. Although this could be done on
individual regions of a genome, the recent re-sequencing
[26] of Mycoplasma genitalium strain G-37 [GenBank:AAGX00000000] when compared to the original
sequence [NC_000908.1] is illustrative. There are no
mixed COGs at stringency 6 which contain unnannotated
ORFs from the original M. genitalium sequence, but there
are four such COGs at stringency 4 (Table 5). One of these
ORFs (in COG 4-3347) is highly similar to sequences
from 12 other organisms. The other ORFs contain apparent frameshifts that are resolved in the new sequence.

Discussion
Peptide sequence similarity as a gene discovery technique
Although studies of intrinsic gene prediction report higher
accuracies (for example, GeneMark is reported to have
detected genes with sensitivity 98.3% and specificity
91.3% averaged over eight prokaryotes [27], this fact
should be considered with the caveat that those algorithms or algorithms similar to them were used to produce the initial annotations. Because intrinsic methods
require statistical models of coding sequence to be tuned

to a specific organism, they may miss recently acquired
genes for which selection has not yet altered the polynucleotide frequencies to match the new host organism.
Intrinsic methods may also miss small genes for which
there is insufficient nucleotide sequence to provide a statistically significant result. Most of the genes missed by
our method are likely to be species specific among the
organisms studied, (i.e. they are ORFans [28] within the
context of the analyzed genomes). Our method may be
more able to pick up genes that may have been horizontally transferred when compared to intrinsic methods.
A different choice of size cutoff for consideration of ORFs
would affect the accuracy of our method because longer
ORFs are more likely to represent genes but genes smaller
than the cutoff would be excluded. An increase in ORF
size cutoff would result in an increase in specificity with a
corresponding decrease in sensitivity. The fact that we
were able to detect some genes that had been missed in
prior genome annotations is in part because we used a
very small size cutoff for consideration of which ORFs
may be genes. The newly detected genes we report are disproportionately small (27% are shorter than 100 codons,
compared to 11% of annotated genes).
A comparison of Figures 1A and 1B shows that incorporating gene information from other organisms greatly
increases the specificity (reducing false positives) of similarity-based gene identification, with a much smaller
decrease in sensitivity. Classification using stringency 2
COGs (i.e. single linkage clusters) is highly sensitive but
not very specific. Increasing stringency to three (the COGs
as described by Tatusov et al. [21]) causes the largest difference in specificity. The difference in specificity between
stringencies two and three is even more pronounced when
incorporating gene information from the other organisms.

The two gene prediction systems shown in Figure 1 are in
general most accurate for the small genomes (Mycoplasma
genitalium , Haemophilus influenzae , other Mycoplasma species). The high accuracies for Mollicutes may be explained
by the presence of many members of this class in the set
of organisms studied. The genes for Escherichia coli strain
K12 can also be relatively well predicted, perhaps due to
the fact that it is so well studied. Classification of E. coli
genes performs particularly well in the second classification system, when information about annotated genes
from other genomes is included. This may be due to the
fact that the characteristics of genes of E. coli have been
used to find those other genes in other organisms.
Limitations of using sequence conservation for gene
prediction
Genes with little conservation among the studied
genomes or which are only present in a few genomes cannot be detected using sequence conservation, leading to
false negatives. Sequence similarity can be due to reasons
other than selection due to protein-coding function. This
can lead to false positive gene predictions. Sequences that
do not encode protein may be similar because: i) they are
conserved for other reasons (non-coding control elements, RNA-genes) or ii) because there is insufficient evolutionary distance between a pair of studied species. The
latter can be the case for pseudogenes â a region in one
genome may contain a gene while the corresponding
region in another genome may not actually code for protein but may not have accumulated enough mutations to
prevent detection of homology.
Examples of gene prediction inconsistencies in COGs of
ORFs
The ORFs in Mycoplasma penetrans from 1316960 to
1317088 on the minus strand and in Mycoplasma mycoides
from 830742 to 830915 on the minus strand do not contain annotated genes. They are however members of a
COG at stringency 6 (COG id 199 in Table 2) in which the
majority of ORFs (25 of 27) correspond to annotated
genes. The annotated members of the COG encode the

50S ribosomal protein L36. The sequence identities from
the M. penetrans ORF to the annotated genes in the COG
range from 39.0% to 83.3%. For the M. mycoides ORF the
range is from 35.2% to 75.7%. Neither of the ORFs have
any interruption in coding potential compared to the
annotated genes in the COG. It is likely that these ORFs
contain genes that were missed in the initial annotations
of their organisms. The peptides they encode are less than
40 amino acids long, and this may account for the fact
that the genes had not been previously detected.
The Vibrio cholerae ORF from 637551 to 638246 in the
plus strand of chromosome I is present in a COG of stringency 6 (COG id 1826 in Table 3) in which 11 ORFs correspond to annotated genes. The V. cholerae ORF is only
about 60% as long as the annotated genes, and the potential peptide sequence it encodes aligns to the amino terminal region of the annotated genes. Examination of the
genomic context of the members of this COG reveals a
nearby V. cholerae ORF from positions 638126 to 638788
which could encode peptide which would align the to carboxy terminus of the annotated genes of this COG. This
suggests the presence of a frameshift or sequencing error
in the region encompassing the two V. cholerae ORFs.
The secG gene annotated in M. genitalium , M. penetrans ,
M. pneumoniae and U. parvum has homologs in M. gallisepticum , M. mobile , M. mycoides and M. pulmonis . The M.
genitalium homolog was detected by curators of the
Genome Reviews database (it is not identified in the
EMBL genome file). This group of homologs is present in
COG id 3175 in Table 2. The M. gallisepticum homolog is
identified as a potential gene, but given the annotation
"unique hypothetical". The M. mobile and M. mycoides
homologs are not identified as genes. In M. pulmonis , the
ORF homologous to secG (genomic coordinates 412829
to 413074 on the forward strand) is not identified as a
gene, but overlaps the locus MYPU_3500 which is on the
opposite strand. It is likely that this is an error in the existing annotation â that the secG homolog is a real gene and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/31

the MYPU_3500 locus, while being slightly longer, does
not actually encode a peptide sequence in the cell.
Detecting pseudogenes
Several groups have used computational techniques to
find pseudogenes in prokaryotes. Intrinsic techniques are
poorly suited for identifying pseudogenes. Pseudogenes
may lack characteristics of protein-coding sequence in a
particular organism because they have resulted from
recent horizontal transfer [29] or because there is a lack of
selective pressure to maintain the characteristics. As a
result, extrinsic techniques are common when searching
for pseudogenes. Liu et al. [29] sought pseudogenes using
SwissProt entries as queries in FastX searches against
genome sequences. They used a fixed similarity cutoff
score of 0.01 to define significant matches. The lack of
selective pressure and resulting genetic drift that makes it
difficult to find pseudogenes by intrinsic methods can
also make it difficult to find homology between a pseudogene and the gene from which it was derived in disparate
genome sequences. Lerat and Ochman [30] considered
sets of closely related organisms and used thresholds for
inferred homology as strict as TBLASTN E-value < 10-15
and protein identity >79%. By using COGs we were able
to detect much more distant homology. There were 232
COGs of stringency-6 that contained at least one best-hit
with a BLASTP E-value > 1.0.

Figure 3
COGs at varying stringencies
COGs at varying stringencies. The concept of stringency
places a requirement of interconnectedness of elements of a
COG. As stringency increases, COGs may split into smaller
COGs and less-connected nodes are dropped. Each vertex
represents a gene (as used in the initial definition of COGs)
or an ORF (as used in this study). Edges represent bidirectional best-hit pairs. Dashed lines enclose elements of a single
COG. Grayed vertices and edges do not participate in a
COG at the given stringency. There is a single COG of stringency (2) containing all of the vertices in this graph because
they are all transitively connected. Stringency (3) COGs are
as described by Tatusov et al. [21]. An orthologous group of
stringency 3 forms a triangle (such as {i , j , k }); orthologous
groups of stringency (3) are clustered if they share two vertices (alternatively: if they share an edge). Stringency (4) OGs
are clustered if they share three vertices. The orthologous
groups {j , k , l , m } and {l , m , n , o } only share two vertices
so they form two separate COGs. At stringency (5) only one
orthologous group, and thus only one COG, remains.

Potential extensions and modifications to the methods of
this study
One obvious extension of this study is to apply the strategy described here to more genome sequences. The scalability of the methods described in this study are limited
primarily by the initial BLASTP searches of translations of
the ORFs. Because all pairwise comparisons are performed, this step scales as the square of the number of
ORFs among the genome sequences studied, which can be
approximated by the square of the number of genome
sequences. As of June 2005, there are 211 bacterial and 21
archaeal genome sequences published [31], about 8.9
times the number of genome sequences analyzed here.
The similarity search comparison step is time consuming
but highly parallel. Because each similarity search is independent of the other searches, the process can be carried
out among many CPUs. New genome sequences can be
added to the study incrementally.

One shortcut that could mitigate scaling issues would be
to form a standard set of COGs of the various stringencies
among only the annotated genes. All of the ORFs in a test
genome sequence could then be compared to the members of the standard COGs. The annotated genes of the
genomes studied here are only 5.75% of the ORFs of 30 or
more codons, greatly reducing the number of comparisons that would need to be performed. This shortcut has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/31

a few drawbacks: i) it will not be possible to detect genes
which are not present in enough of the genomes in the
standard set (depending on stringency) and ii) it will not
be possible to find the 'minority-annotated' mixed COGs
that can indicate over-prediction of genes.
The varying stringency COGs produced using the techniques of this study could also be used in other analyses.
The multiple sequence alignments of COGs could be used
to help define which of several potential translational
start sites may be used in a given gene. Stringency-three
COGs which contain members in many organisms have
been used to indicate genes which may be essential on
account of their pervasiveness. Higher stringency COGs
show not only that corresponding elements are present in
many organisms but also that between most or all of pairs
of organisms the elements are best-hit pairs of each other.
Relationship to proteomic studies
Jaffe et al. [3] revisited the annotation of genes in Mycoplasma pneumoniae , incorporating evidence of peptides
detected using multi-dimensional chromatography followed by analysis by mass-spectrometry. They detected
evidence for 16 proteins which could not be associated
with annotated genes. One of these (from 207448 to
207717 in the (+) strand) was present in COGs up to
stringency 10. Two more (from 250021 to 250293 and
from 415490 to 416032, both on the (+) strand) were
present in COGs of stringency 3. The others were only
present in COGs of stringency 2. The Jaffe et al. study was
aided by the fact that M. pneumoniae has a simple lifestyle
and grows in a relatively static natural environment.
Although some change in M. pneumoniae gene expression
is reported in response to heat shock [32], it is thought
that most of its genes are expressed constitutively. In
organisms with more complex niches or lifestyles that
may involve growing in multiple hosts or environments,
the shotgun proteomic approach will require exposing the
organisms to multiple conditions in order to induce
detectable expression of all proteins.

Conclusion
In this paper, we describe a method that can be used in
combination with existing techniques for detecting protein-coding gene sequences in bacterial genomes. Our
method is extrinsic an individual in that it incorporates
pairwise sequence similarities among several genomes.

SPROCKET. The SPROCKET program was developed to
facilitate the analysis performed in this study. For the members of a COG, a user can view the peptide sequence alignment (using CLUSTALW), a graph of the best-hit
relationships and the genomic context.

The methods we describe can also be used to screen existing gene predictions. The "mixed COGs", in which some
open reading frames correspond to annotated genes and
some do not, are attractive targets for further study. Such
COGs exist even when requiring best-hit similarity pairings among many organisms, and we list the COGs of this
type that exist at stringency six among 27 sequenced bac-

terial strains. The methods we describe can be used to generate hypotheses about the presence of specific genes that
may have been missed in existing annotations. Such a
hypothesis could be evaluated by a targeted search for the
expected protein product based on predicted protein characteristics.

Methods
Sequence preparation, comparison and Best Hit
determination
Sequences and existing annotations for genomes under
study (Table 1) were obtained from the Genome Reviews
database [4] version 25.0 [25]. The annotations in the
Genome Review database include those from the EMBL
sequence files with corresponding accessions as well as
some genes that were identified on the basis of BLAST
similarity to sequences in UniProt. We located open reading frames (ORFs) using the criterion of at least 90 nucleotides (30 codons) between in-frame stop codons (for
codon usage tables appropriate to each organism â the
included Mollicute species do not use UGA as a stop
codon).

Sequence libraries composed of all of the ORFs in the
sequences of included genomes were searched using each
ORF as a query. These all-against-all searches were performed using WU-BLAST (BLASTP 2.0 MP-WashU [06Apr-2005]
[macosx-10.2-g4-ILP32F64
2005-0406T17:46:37], BLOSUM62 similarity matrix, filtered with
SEG, Smith-Waterman alignment used in the scoring
phase). The top ten hits from each query to a library of
ORFs from another organism were recorded provided the
BLAST e-score was less than or equal to 20. There were
84009520 BLAST hits which met these criteria.
COG analysis
A modification of the concept of Clusters of Orthologous
Groups (COGs) [21,33,34] which includes levels of stringency [23] was used to group similar sequences among
organisms. The COGs formed are graphs with ORFs as vertices using the following procedure:

1. For each ORF, compare it to all ORFs in another organism, recording the best hit (BeT), provided that hit meets
the loose stringency cutoff mentioned above (e-score less
than 20).
2. If an ORF a has ORF b as its best hit in another organism
and b has a as its best hit when the reciprocal similarity
search is performed then a and b are said to have a "bidirectional" or "congruent" best-hit relationship. A pair of
vertices will have edges connecting them if the ORFs they
represent have a bidirectional best-hit relationship. For
purposes of this step, ORFs the two strains of E. coli were
not compared to each other.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/31

3. For a given stringency n , cliques (complete graphs â
wherein all nodes are connected to all other nodes) of size
n are found. Cliques are joined when they share a subclique of size n-1 maximally-joined sets of cliques form a
COG.
According to this formalization, the original COGs as
described by Tatusov, et al. [21] are COGs of stringency
three. They consist of triangles formed from congruent
best-hit relationships which are clustered by shared edges.
These triangles are cliques of size 3 and are referred to by
Tatusov et al. as orthologous groups (OGs). Stringencytwo COGs are equivalent to graphs clustered by single
linkage. Each stringency-two COG is an individual connected component of the total graph. As stringency
increases, poorly connected vertices drop out of COGs
and COGs may split (Figure 3).
Like the extended COGs used in the STRING database
[35], the COGs in this study are 'non-supervised'; we have
not performed any manual curation subsequent to COG
production. A gene fusion may result in the merging of
two disparate COGs. Although such an artifact affects the
use of COGs in functional annotation, it is not problematic when using COGs for gene recognition so we made
no effort to avoid these merging events. The BLAST
searches resulted in 2649524 best-hit pairs involving
891039 ORFs. Only 38 best-hit pairs involved a similarity
with E-value as high as 20, and none of these best-hit pairs
held together a COG of stringency three or higher.
SPROCKET
The SPROCKET program (System for Protein Recognition
using ORF COGs â a Knowledge Extraction Tool) provides several ways of viewing and analyzing COG data of
the type produced in this study (Figure 4). The front-end
of the program is written in Java and runs on any platform
with a version 1.4 or later Java virtual machine. Data for
the program is stored in a relational database using a
schema based on the BioSQL schema developed by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation [36] with extensions for
the COG-specific information. Loading of initial
sequences into the database was performed using portions of the BioJava project [37].

A summary view of the COGs shows the number of members of a COG and how many of those members share a
stop codon with an annotated gene. Individual COGs can
be examined in more detail by seeing a list of their members, a force-directed graph layout showing best-hit relationships among these members, an alignment of the
potential peptide sequences of the ORFs as produced by
CLUSTALW [38] or a graphical view of the regions of the
genomes around the ORFs which are in a COG.
