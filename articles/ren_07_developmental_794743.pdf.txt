<p>Developmental-stage-related usage and gene expression correlate with codon usage and genomic GC content in stem cell hierarDevelopmental patterns of codon patterns ofgenomic GC content

information

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that developmental stage-related patterns of gene expression
are correlated with codon usage (GC3) and GCg content in stem cell hierarchies. Moreover, this
paper provides evidence for the influence of natural selection at synonymous sites in the mouse
genome and novel clues for linking the molecular features of genes to their patterns of expression
during mammalian ontogenesis.

interactions

Results: In two models of mouse stem cell differentiation, we established correlations between
codon usage and the patterns of gene expression. We found that the optimal codons exhibited
variation (AT- or GC-ending codons) in different cell types within the developmental hierarchy.
We also found that genes that were enriched (developmental-pivotal genes) or specifically
expressed (developmental-specific genes) at different developmental stages had different patterns
of codon usage and local genomic GC (GCg) content. Moreover, at the same developmental stage,
developmental-specific genes generally used more GC-ending codons and had higher GCg content
compared with developmental-pivotal genes. Further analyses suggest that the model of
translational selection might be consistent with the developmental stage-related patterns of codon
usage, especially for the AT-ending optimal codons. In addition, our data show that after humanmouse divergence, the influence of selective constraints is still detectable.

refereed research

Background: The usage of synonymous codons shows considerable variation among mammalian
genes. How and why this usage is non-random are fundamental biological questions and remain
controversial. It is also important to explore whether mammalian genes that are selectively
expressed at different developmental stages bear different molecular features.

Ren et al.

Background

Synonymous codons, which encode the same amino acid, are
not used randomly. Such codon usage biases are explained as
the balance between mutational drift and natural selection
[1]. In unicellular organisms [2-6] and invertebrate metazoans [7-11], the levels of gene expression can be used to interpret their codon biases. Specifically, highly expressed genes,
compared with weakly expressed ones, selectively use 'optimal codons' that correspond to abundant tRNAs so as to
improve their translational efficiency [11-15].
Nevertheless, in vertebrates, whose genes display more dramatic codon usage biases than those of simple organisms
[14], the correlations between codon usage and patterns of
gene expression (that is, the levels and breadth of gene
expression) remain a subject of controversy [11,16]. In a
number of rodent and human tissues, recent studies have
indicated positive correlations between levels of gene expression, as estimated by SAGE and/or microarray analysis, and
GC3 [16-19]. However, these results are in contradiction with
observations made by analyzing expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) [11,16]. Among extremely highly expressed genes, the
H3 histone gene family is biased to use GC-ending codons
[20]. However, there is no difference in codon usage between
ribosomal protein genes, which are also expressed at very
high levels, and other genes [14]. As to correlations between
breadth of gene expression and codon usage, some studies
suggest that housekeeping genes, with a wider breadth of
expression, are biased to use GC-ending codons [18,21-24]
(also see the debate between [25] and [16]); however, other
papers have described different observations [11,26-29].
Although codon usage has been found to exhibit variations in
human genes specifically expressed in six tissues [30], the
effect is very weak [31] and cannot be generalized to interpret
the global variation (the preference of AT-ending or GC-ending codons) of synonymous codons in the thousands of mammalian genes.
Moreover, in vertebrates, the reasons why there are correlations between codon usage and patterns of gene expression
remain to be elucidated. By using multivariance analyses
(MVA), highly expressed genes have been observed to have
excessive usage of T-ending codons in Xenopus [32] and the
Cyprinidae family [33]. However, both natural selection and
'transcriptional associated mutation bias' (TAMB) [34-36]
would account for these observations. In the tissues with no
evidence of TAMB, a set of GC-ending codons favored in
highly expressed genes has been suggested to be optimal
codons [19]. Moreover, GC-ending codons are more abundant in highly expressed genes [18] and constitutively spliced
exons [37]. However, if GC-ending codons are optimal due to
selective advantages, it is difficult to see why the synonymous
substitution rate (Ks) would be increased with GC-ending
codon usage [38-41] or why the Ks of alternatively spliced
exons would be lower than that of constitutively spliced exons
[42]. It has been reported that highly expressed genes have

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/3/R35

higher recombination rates [43-45]. Moreover, according to
the model of biased gene conversion (BGC), recombination
rates are positively correlated with GC3 [46-51], indicating
that both natural selection and BGC may be responsible for
the correlations between the levels of gene expression and
GC3. The variations of synonymous codon usage among tissue-specific genes have been suggested to be the consequence
of translational selection [30]; a recent study, however, has
indicated that these observations were due to regional variations of substitutional patterns rather than translational
selection [31]. Taken together, further research is obviously
still needed to explore the mechanisms of vertebrate codon
usage bias.
In this paper, to investigate the regularity and mechanisms of
mammalian codon usage, we have taken developmental
stage-related patterns of gene expression into account in
models of stem cell differentiation (Figure 1 and Table 1).
Stem cells, progenitor cells and their derivates, defined by
their distinct differentiation potential (Figure 1a), play critical
roles in the early stages of metazoan ontogenesis and thus
provide ideal models of the mammalian developmental hierarchy. Moreover, developmental processes are believed to be
of critical importance to the investigation of evolutionary
mechanisms [52], even at the genomic level [53]. In the current study, therefore, we have investigated the correlations
between developmental stage-related patterns of gene
expression and codon usage in developmental hierarchies of
stem cell differentiation. Specifically, we have taken advantage of two independent models of stem cell differentiation
[54,55] to identify developmental stage-related patterns of
gene expression, as well as the correlations between these
patterns of gene expression and codon usage.
To define the developmental stage-related patterns of gene
expression in models of stem cell differentiation, we have
introduced two parameters. First, the 'level of gene expression' has been defined as the intensity of gene transcription in
a particular cell type. Second, the 'fold change of gene expression' has been defined as the ratio of the expression levels of
the same gene in two cell types of two neighboring stages in
the developmental hierarchy (Figure 1b). We have further
defined one of these two cell types, in the upper developmental hierarchy, as the earlier cell type, and the other, in the
lower developmental hierarchy, as the later cell type. These
two cell types together constitute a 'differentiation pair'.
Thus, the 'fold change of gene expression' is a descriptive
index of the levels of gene enrichment in a given differentiation pair.
In the present work, we investigate the correlations between
developmental stage-related patterns of gene expression
(that is, the 'levels of gene expression' in each cell type in the
models of stem cell differentiation and the 'fold changes of
gene expression' in each differentiation pair) and the molecular features (GC3 and genomic GC (GCg) content) of these

'Levels of gene expression' are correlated with GC3

developmental hierarchies

information

First, we established correlations between the fold changes of
gene expression and GC3 in 12 differentiation pairs for which
there was experimental evidence of the differentiation processes (Figure 1b; also see Discussion). We found that in 10 of
the 12 differentiation pairs, the fold changes of gene
expression were significantly correlated with GC3 (P < 0.005;
Table 3). Strikingly, in differentiation pairs of neural stem
cells (NSCs)/LVB and embryonic stem cells (ESCs)/hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), up to 14.3% (Rs = 0.378) and
11.4% (Rs = 0.338) variation of GC3 could be explained by the

interactions

First, we focused on the correlations between the levels of
gene expression and GC3. We found significant negative correlations between the levels of gene expression and GC3 in
eight cell types (P < 0.005; Table 2). In these datasets, we
observed that only in the lateral ventricles of the brain (LVB),
which contain predominantly mature neural cells, were the
levels of gene expression significantly positively correlated
with GC3 (P < 0.005; Table 2). We next investigated the variation of codon usage between 'highly expressed genes' and
'mid to lowly expressed genes', which were divided by quantiles of 0.67 (Q0.67) of the levels of gene expression in each cell
type. We observed that in the eight cell types in which the levels of gene expression were negatively correlated with GC3,
the highly expressed genes used significantly more AT-ending
codons compared with the mid to lowly expressed genes (P <
0.01; Table 2). In addition, in LVB, highly expressed genes
used more GC-ending codons than mid to lowly expressed

In accordance with the variation in GC3, we found that GCg
was also significantly different between highly expressed
genes and mid to lowly expressed genes in each of the nine
cell types (P < 0.05), where the levels of gene expression were
significantly correlated (positively in LVB or negatively in the
eight cell types) with GC3 (P < 0.005; Table 2). Consistent
with earlier studies (for example, [14,40]), we observed that
GC3 and GCg were closely correlated in our dataset (Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Rs) = 0.665, N = 11,066; P
< 10-6). We thus suggest that the variation of GCg between the
highly expressed and mid to lowly expressed genes might well
be a consequence of this correlation.

genes. We also explore possible mechanisms for these developmental stage-related patterns of codon usage. This study
reveals that developmental stage-related patterns of gene
expression are correlated with GC3 and GCg in models of
stem cell differentiation. Moreover, these analyses suggest
that the model of translational selection, rather than other
known hypotheses that have been put forward, might be the
most likely to account for the developmental stage-related
patterns of codon usage, especially for the negative correlations between the levels of gene expression and GC3.

Cell types of different developmental stages in two models of stem cell differentiation
Cell types of different developmental stages in two models of stem cell differentiation. (a) Cell types of earlier developmental stages can differentiate into
cell types of later developmental stages. The arrowheads indicate the direction of differentiation. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) occupy the earliest
developmental stage, as they can give rise to all cell types of the three germ layers. PSCs can generate less potent 'multipotent stem cells' (MSCs), which
are capable of generating all the cell lineages in specific tissues. MSCs can, in turn, give rise to lineage-committed progenitors (LCPs), which directly
produce mature cells in the later developmental stage. (b) Two models of stem cell differentiation in our research. The cell type colors correspond to the
developmental stages shown in (a). The arrows indicate the direction of differentiation within differentiation pairs made up of two neighboring stages in the
developmental hierarchy. Model A [54] contains pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), MSCs in adult hematopoietic (hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs))
and neural (neural stem cells (NSCs)) tissues, as well as the main cell populations in bone marrow (BM) and the cells in lateral ventricles of the brain (LVB),
which mainly contain mature cells in adult hematopoietic and neural tissues, respectively. Model B [55] contains ESCs and three types of MSCs that reside
in fetal neural (fetal neural stem cell (FNSCs)), fetal liver hematopoietic (fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells (FLHSCs)) and adult hematopoietic (long-term
functional hematopoietic stem cells (LTHSCs)) tissues. Model B also includes the key intermediate developmental stages of the hematopoietic hierarchy. In
adult bone marrow, short-term functional HSCs (STHSC) and bone marrow LCPs are intermediate developmental stages in the course from LTHSCs to
mature blood cells (MBCs). Fetal liver LCPs (FLLCPs) comprise an intermediate developmental stage between FLHSCs and FLMBCs. (For a detailed
description of each cell type and experimental evidence of these differentiation processes, see Table 1 and Discussion).

respective fold changes of gene expression in these differentiation pairs.
We next investigated the variation of GC3 and GCg between
genes enriched in two cell types of each differentiation pair.
When genes are expressed in both cell types of a given differentiation pair, the 'fold change of gene expression' is a measurement of the level of gene enrichment in this differentiation
pair. Thus, if the fold change of a certain gene expression is
higher than 2 or less than 0.5, this gene is defined as a developmental-pivotal gene in this paper. Our results show that, in
nine differentiation pairs, GC3 between the developmentalpivotal genes enriched at the earlier and later developmental

stages differed significantly (P < 0.05; Table 3). Moreover, we
also found GCg between these two groups of genes to be significantly different in seven differentiation pairs (P < 0.05),
especially in ESC/NSC, NSC/LVB, ESC/HSC, and ESC/fetal
neural stem cells (FNSCs) (P < 0.001; Table 3).
It should be noted that some genes, which were only
expressed in either the earlier or later developmental stages,
cannot be described in terms of 'fold change of gene expression'. We have defined these genes as developmental-specific
genes. We found that both GC3 and GCg were different
between developmental-specific genes in seven differentiation pairs (P < 0.05; Table 3). In addition, at the same devel-

Possible mechanisms of developmental stage-related
codon usage: testing the hypotheses of BGC, TAMB
and natural selection

The BGC model suggests a positive correlation between GC
content (including GC3) and recombination rates [46-50].
We observed that GC3 was positively correlated with recombination rates in our datasets (Rs = 0.14, N = 10383, P < 106). In this paper, we established the correlations between GC3
and the patterns of gene expression. Therefore, to determine
if the developmental stage-related patterns of codon usage
are byproducts of the BGC effect, we further studied the correlations between the patterns of gene expression and recombination rates. No significant correlations between
recombination rates and the levels of gene expression were
observed (Rs range from -0.033 to 0.020, P > 0.10; Additional data file 2). The only exception was in fetal liver mature

recombination rates only in the differentiation pairs NSC/
LVB and FLLCP/FLMBC (Rs = -0.083 and 0.062, respectively, P < 0.01; Additional data file 3). Moreover, these correlation coefficients were weaker than those between the fold
changes of gene expression and GC3 in these differentiation
pairs (Table 3). In other differentiation pairs, no significant
correlations between the fold changes of gene expression and
recombination rates were observed (Rs range from -0.045 to
0.034, P > 0.05; Additional data file 3). We also observed that
the recombination rates of developmental-specific genes,
with their excessive usage of GC-ending codons, were not significantly higher than those of non-development pivotal
genes (the fold changes of gene expression are within 0.5 and
2) (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that
the developmental stage-related patterns of codon usage are
not byproducts of the BGC effect.
The model of mutational bias proposes that the codon bias is
simply due to unbalanced base substitutions [15,56-60].
Transcriptional processes can increase the mutation frequency from cytidine (C) to thymine (T) and adenosine (A) to
guanosine (G), because the single-stranded DNA that more
frequently appears during the course of transcription is more
sensitive to deamination [34-36]. This TAMB model thus predicts a positive correlation between the levels of gene expression and the T or G content. If TAMB is the only cause of the
excessive usage of T-ending and G-ending codons in highly
expressed genes, we would expect an increase in the T3/G3
(T/G content at the third codon position) and Ti/Gi (T/G content in the untranslated region) in parallel with the levels of
gene expression. To evaluate the influence of TAMB, we
measured the slopes of Ni (the nucleotide content in the
untranslated regions) and N3 (the nucleotide content at the
third codon position) with the levels of gene expression as the
descriptive index of their increase rates. Our results show that
although there was a parallel increase in G3 and Gi in LVB,
the increase in T3 (with the slopes ranging from 5.38 to
10.60) was more rapid than the increase in Ti (with the slopes
ranging from 1.86 to 5.03) in other cell types where the levels
of gene expression were negatively correlated with GC3
(Additional data file 2). Moreover, the increase in C3 (in LVB)
relative to the levels of gene expression was not due to the
contribution of TAMB. Consequently, although these results
cannot completely rule out a potential effect of TAMB, there
is a strong suggestion that some factors other than TAMB are
the primary cause underlying our observations.
Natural selection could act on mammalian genes, for example, highly expressed genes are reported to prefer shorter
[19,61] and less introns [62], as well as cheaper amino acids
[62] (however, see [19]). Natural selection could also influence mammalian codon usage biases [62-68], for example, at
the levels of transcription [69,70], RNA processing [71-73],
translation [19,62,74,75] and mRNA secondary structure
[76], as well as at the protein level [77,78]. If codons are
selected to improve transcriptional efficiency, there would be

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/3/R35

more GC-ending codons in highly expressed genes, as the
conformation of DNA with a higher GC content would facilitate transcription [69,70]. Therefore, it is not likely that the
excessive usage of AT-ending codons in highly expressed
genes is a result of this effect. If certain codons have selective
advantages of translational efficiency over other codons,
these codons would be used more frequently in highly
expressed than in weakly expressed genes. Therefore, the correlations between the levels of gene expression and codon
usage seem to be consistent with this hypothesis. Taken
together, it is more likely that the model of translational selection, rather than BGC or TAMB, would account for these findings, especially for the negative correlations between the
levels of gene expression and GC3.
If the codon bias of highly expressed genes has undergone
selective pressures, it would be useful to determine whether
selective pressures were still effective after the human-mouse
divergence. Assuming mutational rates are near homogeneous in the mammalian genome, there would be lower synonymous substitution rates (Ks) between human-mouse
orthologous genes if selective pressure was still effective.
Except for HSCs, bone marrow (BM) of model A and CD45 of
model B, our results show that highly expressed genes had
lower Ks compared with mid to lowly expressed genes in all
other cell types (P < 0.05; Table 2). Previous studies have
indicated that the substitution rates at nonsynonymous sites
may indirectly affect silent substitution rates [79]. We thus
removed the codons in which doublet substitutions occurred
to recalculate synonymous substitution rates (Ks_noDS)
[80]. The data show that, in each of the 15 cell types in the different developmental stages, highly expressed genes had
lower Ks_noDS compared to mid to lowly expressed genes (P
< 0.05; Table 2). Moreover, we also demonstrate that the
nonsynonymous substitution rates (Ka) and Ka/Ks of highly
expressed genes are significantly lower than those of mid to
lowly expressed genes (P < 0.01; Table 2).
We next focused on the substitution rates of developmentalpivotal genes and developmental-specific genes. We found
that the developmental-pivotal genes in the earlier developmental stages of ESC/HSC and NSC/LVB had lower Ks and
Ka/Ks than non-developmental-pivotal genes (P < 0.05;
Table 3). Moreover, developmental-pivotal genes in the earlier developmental stages of ESC/HSC had lower Ks_noDS
after removal of doublet substitutions (P < 0.05; Table 3).
These results suggest the possibility that negative selection
following human and mouse divergence may still be detectable in terms of the codon usage of some groups of developmental-pivotal genes. Nevertheless, we also show that many
groups of developmental-pivotal genes, as well as almost all
groups of developmental-specific genes, have higher Ks, Ka/
Ks and Ks_noDS compared with non-developmental-pivotal
genes (Table 3).

Discussion

Developmental processes are believed to be useful guides to
the exploration of evolutionary mechanisms [93]. One
famous example is the Haeckel's hypothesis that ontogeny
may recapitulate, to some extent, phylogeny. Although it is
clear that we can not simply regard the early stages of mammalian development as simple organisms [94], in this paper,
using models of stem cell differentiation covering early stages
of mammalian ontogeny, certain useful clues about evolutionary issues at the molecular level have been obtained.
Some of these clues, for instance, the correlations between the
levels of gene expression and codon usage, are shown to be
helpful to understanding the codon usage biases that occur in
simple organisms [2-11]. In addition, stem cells are observed
as the units of natural selection [95,96] and the origin of
many types of cancer [97,98]. These observations suggest that
stem cells might play critical roles during evolutionary processes. Here we suggest that considering patterns of gene
expression in early stages of developmental hierarchies (that
is, stem cells and progenitor cells) might lead to a better
understanding of mammalian codon usage biases.

AT-ending optimal codons in early developmental stages
In this paper, we found that optimal codons displayed variation (AT-ending or GC-ending codons) in different cell types
within the developmental hierarchy. The 'optimal codons' are
defined here as those codons that are excessively used in
highly expressed genes. It has long been assumed that, in certain vertebrates, the optimal codons, if they exist, are consistent with the major codons, which are, on average, used more
frequently when taking all the known transcripts of a species

information

In this study, we observed that developmental stage-related
patterns of gene expression (that is, the 'levels of gene expression' and the 'fold changes of gene expression') were correlated with GC3. Here we suggest that neither the
methodological bias of the microarray nor the effect of the
correlations between gene length and GC3 substantially influence these observations. Methodological issues are involved
in the correlations between the levels of gene expression and
codon usage. The SAGE and microarray analysis methods
introduce a risk of overestimating the levels of gene expression with high GC content [11,92]. Therefore, our observation
of excessive usage of AT-ending codons in highly expressed
genes is not due to a methodological bias of microarray anal-

ysis. On the contrary, the actual correlation coefficients
between the levels of gene expression and AT-ending codon
usage might be even higher. Correlations between patterns of
gene expression and gene length have been reported in mammals [19,62]; therefore, it is necessary for us to identify
whether the correlations between the patterns of gene expression and GC3 are byproducts of these correlations. We suggest that gene lengths do not substantially influence these
observations because, in our datasets, the levels of gene
expression were negatively correlated with the lengths of both
transcripts (ranging from -0.182 to -0.084, P < 10-6) and coding sequences (ranging from -0.172 to -0.084, P < 10-6) (Additional data file 2), whereas the levels of gene expression were
negatively correlated with GC3 in most cases (Table 2). Moreover, gene lengths do not substantially affect the correlations
between the fold changes of gene expression and GC3. In each
of nine of ten differentiation pairs in which these correlations
exist with significance (positively or negatively), the correlations between the fold changes of gene expression and gene
lengths were weaker than, or were opposite to, the correlations between the fold changes of gene expression and GC3
(Table 3; Additional data file 3).

reviews

In this paper, to investigate developmental-stage related patterns of mammalian codon usage, we used two models of
stem cell differentiation to define the developmental-stage
related patterns of gene expression. Here we suggest that the
patterns of gene expression defined in these models are faithful reflections of developmental regulation. First, development, as a process of ontogenesis, can be divided into many
stages according to the steps of cellular differentiation. In our
models, distinct cell types within the processes of differentiation were isolated with high homogeneity by strategies of
selective culture and fluorescence activated cell sorting
(FACS) (Table 1). To identify the patterns of gene expression
in early developmental stages, these strategies of cell isolation
seem more precise than those used previously, which postulated that complete embryos represent 'early developmental
stages' [26,81], because embryos in fact are a mixture of differentiated mature cells with undifferentiated stem cells. Second, in our models, the processes of stem cell differentiation
(Figure 1b) were constructed according to published experimental evidence. The pluripotency of ESCs can be examined
by injecting them into blastocysts to produce normal embryos
[82-84]. ESCs are able to differentiate into multipotent stem
cells (MSCs), including the MSCs in neural [85] and hematopoietic [86] tissues. Moreover, both FNSCs [87] and adult
NSCs [88] are able to generate mature neural cells in vitro
and in vivo, including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, both fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells
(FLHSCs) [89] and bone marrow HSCs (or long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LTHSCs)) [90] can functionally repopulate entire hematopoietic systems in recipients. In these
repopulation processes, hematopoietic stem cells give rise to
mature blood cells by generating lineage-committed progenitors (LCPs). Notably, in cell lineage tracing assays, FLHSCs
have been observed to acquire the ability to directly generate
LTHSCs during ontogenesis [91].

into account [16,18,19,62]. Notably, our results show that, in
some special circumstances, for example, in certain mouse
stem cells and progenitor cells in early developmental stages
of mammalian ontogeny, the optimal codons were the ATending ones, while the mouse major codons are the GC-ending ones (average GC3 content of mouse transcripts is 0.555,
based on Ensembl build 26). The difference between our
observations and previous results may be explained by the
fact that the previous studies, suggesting that GC-ending
codons are the optimal codons, defined the levels of gene
expression as average levels of gene expression in whole tissues, or whole organisms in embryonic or adult stages, which
actually contain a mixture of all cell types in different developmental stages [16,18,19,62]. These strategies thus mainly
reflect the patterns of gene expression in mature cells, and
may not allow accurate characterization of gene expression
patterns in the early developmental stages because stem cells
and progenitor cells only constitute a negligible fraction of the
tissues.
Previous reports have indicated correlations between GCcontent and the patterns of gene expression in both human
and mouse [11,16-18,25,27,99,100]. Specifically, mouse GC3
content is positively correlated with levels of gene expression
in many tissues. The R2 (R2: the correlation coefficient of
determination that indicates how much of the variability in
codon usage can be "explained by" variation in the levels of
gene expression) of these correlations is as high as 2.6%
(Spleen) and 2.3% [18]. In this work, we show that the R2 of
the negative correlations between mouse GC3 and the levels
of gene expression could reach as high as 2.8% (ESCs of
model A). This value is comparable with previous observations [18]. Notably, in the models of stem cell differentiation,
defining the 'fold change of gene expression' as a novel pattern of gene expression, we observed that the R2 of correlations between GC3 and the fold changes of gene expression in
NSC/LVB (R2 = 14.3%), ESC/HSC (R2 = 11.4%) and ESC/
FNSC (R2 = 5.7%) were higher than the R2 of correlations
between GC3 and other known patterns of gene expression
tested in the other mouse microarray dataset [16,18]. In this
dataset, the levels of gene expression were defined as the
average levels in each of 45 tissues [101]. We further tested
whether taking early developmental stages into consideration
could improve the predictability of codon usage by means of
gene expression. Using MVA, we found that the levels of gene
expression explained 16.0% (in 5 cell types of model A) and
15.5% (in 10 cell types of model B) of GC3 variation. These
values are much higher than the 8.8% obtained from the average levels of gene expression in each of the 45 tissues [101].
This difference between our and previous results suggests
that the AT-ending optimal codons in the early developmental stages seem to be critical to the understanding of the regularity of codon usage.

Possible explanations for the correlations between GC3 and the levels
of gene expression
It has been suggested that the model of translational selection
cannot be used to explain mammalian codon usage [14,102].
Conversely, recent studies have presented evidence that
translational selection might influence the synonymous sites
of coding regions [19,62,74,75]. These recent findings also
agree with the observations that synonymous changes could
dramatically influence translational efficiency in mammalian
cells [103-106]. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses
of BGC, TAMB and natural selection specifically at the levels
of transcription and translation to analyze the possible mechanisms behind the developmental stage-related patterns of
codon usage. From our results it is suggested that natural
selection at the translational level, compared to the other
hypotheses tested in this paper, most probably accounts for
the finding that the levels of gene expression are correlated
with GC3 in many cell types.
If the usage of synonymous codons correlates with translational efficiency, there might be a selective pressure to choose
the synonymous codon that matches the most abundant
tRNA. In unicellular organisms and invertebrate metazoans,
the optimal codons are in general correspondence with the
abundant tRNAs of high copy number [11-14,80,107]. Moreover, in the case of mammals, the abundances of tRNAs are
also assumed to correlate with their copy number [19,74].
However, based on this assumption, it would be difficult to
understand why optimal codons display variation (AT-ending
or GC-ending codons) in the same species. Although the biological bases of the variations of optimal codons remain an
issue for further investigation, we hypothesize that one of the
aspects of these pressures may be related to variations in specific biochemical environments, for example, the developmental stage-related modification patterns of tRNA
molecules. It has been reported that biochemical modification at the wobble positions of tRNA molecules helps regulate
their codon recognition preference [108-111]. For example,
uridine modified by thiolation or 5-carboxymethylation
exhibits a preference for A over G at the third position of the
codon [112]. Moreover, developmental stage-related patterns
of tRNA modification have been observed [113,114]. Taken
together, we suggest that the developmental stage-related
variation of optimal codons might be correlated with developmental stage-related patterns of tRNA modification.

Possible explanations for the correlations between GC3 and the fold
change of gene expression
In this paper, we defined the 'fold change of gene expression'
as the ratio of the expression levels of the same gene in two
cell types from neighboring stages in the developmental hierarchy. It is not surprising that the correlations between the
'fold change of gene expression' and GC3, in specific differentiation pairs, are related to the correlations between the 'levels of gene expression' and GC3 in these two cell types.
Moreover, if the correlations between the 'levels of gene

In many groups of developmental-pivotal and developmental-specific genes, we also show that both Ks and Ka/Ks are
higher than in non-developmental-pivotal genes. These
results suggest that the codon usage of most developmentalpivotal and developmental-specific genes has been under less
selective constraints. Furthermore, the higher Ka/Ks of these
genes may imply that these genes have been subject to different functional constraints after the divergence of human and
mouse. This explanation is consistent with the observation
that orthologous genes can play different roles in human and
mouse stem cells [121]. However, it should be noted that current knowledge of the mechanisms of stem cell differentiation
is very limited. Therefore, further study of the function of
orthologous developmental-pivotal and developmental-specific genes will deepen our understanding of the higher Ks
and Ka/Ks in these genes.

interactions

First, compared with developmental-pivotal genes, developmental-specific genes used more GC-ending codons and were
located in genomic regions with higher GC content in most
cases (Table 3; Additional data file 1). Second, the Ka, Ks,
Ks_noDS, and Ka/Ks for many groups of developmental-specific genes were significantly higher than those of the developmental-pivotal genes (Table 3; Additional data file 5).
According to these observations, we suggest these two groups
of genes are different. Although more evidence is clearly still
necessary, the results suggest the possibility that the regulation patterns of genes might be correlated with their codon
usage, genomic GC content and evolutionary rates.

refereed research

The expression of developmental-pivotal genes (regulated up
and down) and developmental-specific genes (regulated on
and off) is regulated by different strategies. After the combination of these two groups of genes, both GC3 and GCg still
differed significantly between the genes selectively expressed
at the earlier and later developmental stages of many differentiation pairs (Additional data file 4). However, our data
show that these two groups of genes are different in their
molecular characteristics, genomic composition and the
related evolution rates. Therefore, in this paper, developmental-pivotal genes and developmental-specific genes are discussed separately.

deposited research

We also provide evidence of the presence of negative selection
at synonymous sites following the human-mouse divergence.
The observation that, in all mouse cell types, highly expressed
genes have a lower Ks_noDS (Ks after removing doublet substitution) is consistent with previous results showing that
synonymous substitution rates are lower in highly expressed
genes compared with other genes in bacteria and Drosophila
[9,115-117]. Considering the occurrence of negative selection
at synonymous sites, it is suggested that Ka/Ks, which have
long been used to evaluate protein evolutionary rates, carry a
risk of overestimation [64]. Therefore, early studies in which
exonic synonymous sites have been assumed neutral may
require reevaluation (also see [19,64,65]). Notably, even with
lower Ks, highly expressed genes and developmental-pivotal
genes in ESCs of the ESC/HSC differentiation pair still
showed lower evolutionary rates (Ka/Ks; Tables 2 and 3).

These findings are consistent with previous results that protein evolutionary rates are negatively correlated with levels of
gene expression from unicellular organisms to vertebrates
[118-120].

expression' and GC3 are the consequence of natural selection,
we would regard the correlations between the 'fold change of
gene expression' and GC3 as a reflection of the difference
between selective pressures in the cell types occupying earlier
and later developmental stages. In the differentiation pairs
ESC/NSC, NSC/LVB, ESC/HSC, ESC/FNSC, FLHSC/LTHSC
and LCP/mature blood cells (MBCs), selective pressure
towards AT-ending codons is much stronger in cell types of an
earlier rather than a later developmental stage; the genes
enriched in the earlier cell types will show a greater usage of
AT-ending codons than those in later cell types. In short-term
hematopoietic stem cells (STHSCs)/LCP, similar results were
obtained. Consistent with the explanation above, in ESC/
FLHSC, the selective pressures towards AT-ending codons
are very similar between the cell types of earlier and later
developmental stages, the patterns of codon usage between
the genes enriched in the earlier and later developmental
stages are not significantly different (Table 3). However, we
observed that, in FLHSC/FLLCP, FLLCP/FLMBC, and
LTHSC/STHSC, in which selective pressures towards ATending codons are very similar for the cell types of earlier and
later developmental stages, the fold changes of gene expression were significantly correlated with AT3. We suggest that
these observations may be attributed to the fact that the
codon usage of many genes enriched in certain differentiation
pairs is affected by other factors that contribute to the codon
usage bias of this differentiation pair. Taken together, our
observations are consistent with the possibility that the
greater the differences between the putative selective pressures of the cell types occupying earlier and later developmental stages, the greater the variation in codon usage (GC3)
between genes enriched in the earlier and latter cell types
(Table 3). In the differentiation pairs, we also show that the
GC3 of the genes that were highly expressed in both earlier
and later developmental stages were correlated with the sum
of the correlation coefficients between the levels of gene
expression and GC3 in these two stages (that is, the putative
combination of selective pressures; Rs = 0.78).

stem cell differentiation) at the genomic level [122]. First,
both developmental-pivotal genes and developmental-specific genes have been proposed, and many of them are experimentally demonstrated, to be responsible for maintaining
cells at each developmental stage as well as regulating cell differentiation processes [54,55]. We have shown that codon
usage, a 'silent' property of both developmental-pivotal genes
and developmental-specific genes, are different between the
earlier and later developmental stages in differentiation
pairs. These findings suggest that the genes responsible for
different developmental stages have different derivations and
regulation patterns. Moreover, developmental-pivotal genes
and developmental-specific genes exhibit different regulation
patterns. During differentiation, the transcriptional
intensities of developmental-pivotal genes need to be appropriately regulated up or down, whereas the transcription of
developmental-specific genes should be silenced in one stage
and activated in another. It has been suggested that chromatin structures and the genome location of developmental-pivotal and developmental-specific genes are quite different:
developmental-pivotal genes might be located in euchromatin, whereas most developmental-specific genes might be
located in facultative heterochromatin [123]. In this paper, we
demonstrate that developmental-specific genes generally use
more GC-ending codons than developmental-pivotal genes.
We suggest that this different molecular property may correlate with different regulation patterns and chromatin structure, but the precise mechanisms at the moment remain
unclear.

content indicate that the isochores are related to different
developmental stages during mammalian ontogenesis.

Second, it has been shown that the processes of stem cell differentiation are accompanied by remodeling of the entire
chromatin structure [123-128]. However, little is known
about the characteristics of chromatin segments involved in
these remodeling processes. Previous studies have shown
that the chromatin segments in which developmental stagespecific genes are located have been remodeled during differentiation [129-132]. Moreover, it has been reported that
nucleosome formation potential is correlated with the GC
content of DNA [69]. Our results suggest that the GC content
of genomic regions where developmental-pivotal genes and
developmental-specific genes are located is different between
the earlier and later developmental stages in differentiation
pairs. Altogether, our results suggest that, during differentiation, the genome segments that are involved in chromatin
remodeling are correlated with their GC content. It has been
suggested that mammalian genomes are made up of mosaic
'isochore' structures, which might relate to the variation in
GC content on the scale of hundreds of kilobases to megabases [22,23,40,133,134]. Furthermore, the isochores are
proposed to correlate with tissue specificity [18]. Previous
work also shows that, during ESC differentiation, many differentiation-induced replication-timing and expression
changes are restricted to AT-rich isochores [135]. Our findings of developmental stage-correlated codon usage and GCg

Conclusion

In this investigation, using models of stem cell differentiation, developmental stage-related patterns of mouse codon
usage have been observed. Notably, in early stages of mouse
ontogeny, we found a bias for AT-ending optimal codons.
Moreover, during mammalian ontogenesis, we also found
that genes selectively expressed during different developmental stages have different codon usage (GC3) and local GCg
content. We hypothesize that translational selection, compared to other hypotheses such as BGC and TAMB, most
probably accounts for these codon usage biases, especially for
the AT-ending optimal codons. The selective constraints were
still detectable at synonymous sites of many groups of developmental stage-related genes. Moreover, at the same developmental stage, we also found that developmental-specific
genes usually used more GC-ending codons, had higher GCg
content and higher substitution rates compared with developmental-pivotal genes. Applying codon usage analysis in
developmental hierarchies, this paper provides new clues for
understanding differentiation processes. For example, the
genome segments that are involved in chromatin remodeling
may correlate with GC content. Further investigation will be
needed to better understand the significance and implications of the findings presented here.

Genomic data
Removing 2,672 pseudo genes according to their annotations,
we extracted information on 31,022 transcripts from the
Mouse division (build 26) of the Ensembl genome database
for further analysis. To investigate the evolutionary conservation of mouse genes, we also extracted information from the
Human division (build 26) of the Ensembl database.

Microarray data
We used two independent oligonucleotide microarray datasets (Affymetrix MG-U74Av2) for the models of mouse stem
cell differentiation [54,55]. For dataset A, the raw data are
available from the website of Melton's lab [136]. We processed these raw data by Affymetrix MAS 5.0. For dataset B,
the raw data were processed by Affymetrix MAS 4.0 [55]. We
accessed these data from Science website [137]. For both
datasets, we used the 'Detection Call' provided by the Affymetrix MAS system to identify whether a transcript is present (P)
or absent (A); the marginal situation is marked as M.
The mapping relationships between Affymetrix probe-sets
and their corresponding transcripts were extracted from the
Ensembl database. The detailed mapping algorithms were
implemented by the Ensembl team [138].
