Abstract
Background: The exchange of nucleotides at synonymous sites in a gene encoding a protein is
believed to have little impact on the fitness of a host organism. This should be especially true for
synonymous transitions, where a pyrimidine nucleotide is replaced by another pyrimidine, or a
purine is replaced by another purine. This suggests that transition redundant exchange (TREx)
processes at the third position of conserved two-fold codon systems might offer the best
approximation for a neutral molecular clock, serving to examine, within coding regions, theories
that require neutrality, determine whether transition rate constants differ within genes in a single
lineage, and correlate dates of events recorded in genomes with dates in the geological and
paleontological records. To date, TREx analysis of the yeast genome has recognized correlated
duplications that established a new metabolic strategies in fungi, and supported analyses of
functional change in aromatases in pigs. TREx dating has limitations, however. Multiple transitions
at synonymous sites may cause equilibration and loss of information. Further, to be useful to
correlate events in the genomic record, different genes within a genome must suffer transitions at
similar rates.
Results: A formalism to analyze divergence at two fold redundant codon systems is presented.
This formalism exploits two-state approach-to-equilibrium kinetics from chemistry. This formalism
captures, in a single equation, the possibility of multiple substitutions at individual sites, avoiding any
need to "correct" for these. The formalism also connects specific rate constants for transitions to
specific approximations in an underlying evolutionary model, including assumptions that transition
rate constants are invariant at different sites, in different genes, in different lineages, and at different
times. Therefore, the formalism supports analyses that evaluate these approximations.
Transitions at synonymous sites within two-fold redundant coding systems were examined in the
mouse, rat, and human genomes. The key metric (f2), the fraction of those sites that holds the same
nucleotide, was measured for putative ortholog pairs. A transition redundant exchange (TREx)
distance was calculated from f2 for these pairs. Pyrimidine-pyrimidine transitions at these sites
occur approximately 14% faster than purine-purine transitions in various lineages. Transition rate

constants were similar in different genes within the same lineages; within a set of orthologs, the f2
distribution is only modest overdispersed. No correlation between disparity and overdispersion is
observed. In rodents, evidence was found for greater conservation of TREx sites in genes on the
X chromosome, accounting for a small part of the overdispersion, however.
Conclusion: The TREx metric is useful to analyze the history of transition rate constants within
these mammals over the past 100 million years. The TREx metric estimates the extent to which
silent nucleotide substitutions accumulate in different genes, on different chromosomes, with
different compositions, in different lineages, and at different times.

Background
Estimation of rate constants for nucleotide substitutions
at silent sites of encoding DNA is important to understanding the dynamics of molecular sequence evolution
[1-6]. Synonymous substitution can be used draw inferences about functional change in protein, explore the
influence of generation time on the rate of sequence divergence[7,8], measure the underlying rate of mutation in
natural lineages [9-12], detect different rates of mutation
in different lineages [13,14], understand the impact of GC
contact on the underlying rate of mutation [15,16], detect
covariation in frequencies of substitution [17], detect
regions of a genome that may evolve at different rates [1923], and correlate rates of change with other aspects of
genomics [24]. The dynamics of molecular evolution, in
turn, is important for inferring information about the fold
of proteins [25] and their associated functional behaviours [25]. This, in turn, is critical to making functional
assignments to proteins, understanding how that function
might have changed historically [26], and correlating
changes in biomolecular behavior with the changing palaeontology and geology of Earth and the cosmos [27].
Much literature has discussed the most appropriate way to
estimate the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions separating two sequences. These are
frequently expressed as a ratio to the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites (dS and dN).
This literature was recently reviewed by Yang and Nielsen
[6]. These authors commented in particular on what they
called "approximate methods" for determining dS and dN.
Here, the number of synonymous (S) and non-synonymous (N) sites in the sequences are counted. These
include silent sites of different degeneracies, including
four fold, three fold, and two fold degeneracies, as well as
sites that are synonymous or not depending on events at
other sites. Approximate methods then count the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous differences
between the two sequences. They then apply a "correction" to account for the fact that more than one substitution might have occurred at the sites being counted [6].

Yang and Nielsen [6] criticized several of these procedures
by noting that they do not accommodate certain wellknown features of DNA sequence evolution, such as unequal transition and transversion rate constants, and unequal codon frequencies. These make the counting of sites
and differences challenging. These authors then distinguished between four categories of substitutions: synonymous
transitions,
nonsynonymous
transitions,
synonymous transversions, and nonsynonymous transversions. The results that emerged from this analysis have
been extremely useful in molecular evolution.
The structure of the genetic code permits a more refined
type of analysis. In particular, codons within two fold
redundant coding systems are, in the universal code, interconverted by transitions only, by purine-purine transitions for the systems encoding Glu (E), Gln (Q), and Lys
(K), and by pyrimidine-pyrimidine transitions for the systems encoding Cys (C), Asp (D), Asn (N), Tyr (Y), Phe (F),
and His (H).
For this reason, two fold redundant sites in these systems
are expected to follow "approach to equilibrium" kinetics.
Such kinetic analysis is well known in chemistry, where it
was used by Manfred Eigen to analyze chemical reactions
[28]. Given certain assumptions about nucleotide substitution, the fraction of identity at the two fold redundant
sites, f2, is modelled to follow an exponential decay as two
sequences diverge, starting at unity and ending at an equilibrium value, typically near 0.5 (but not exactly 0.5) (Fig.
1).
The end point is not exactly 0.5 if the rate constant for the
forward transition is not the same as the rate constant for
the reverse transition. This difference leads to something
that is often mentioned as "codon bias". If the ratio of the
rate constants is in the same direction in two lineages
whose orthologs are being compared, then the bias will
create an end point greater than 0.5. If that ratio is not in
the same direction in the two lineages, then the end point
will be less than 0.5 (see Methods).
Assuming only that the codon bias is time-invariant, the
approach-to-equilibrium kinetic formalism captures in a

single exponential equation both the forward and reverse
rate processes at two fold redundant sites. This permits us
to avoid the "corrections" used in many approaches to
capture the possibility of multiple mutations at individual
sites. Further, as discussed below, the formalism allows
the extraction of specific transition rate constants and
equilibrium constants from genomic data, manage
directly changing codon biases, and assess the gene-, time, and lineage invariance of the transition rate constants.
In the past, the TREx formalism has been used to identify
pathways in the yeast genome [1] and to analyze the
divergence of specific paralogs in mammalian lineages
[2]. Here, we apply this formalism to the human, mouse
and rat genomes more broadly. An estimate is obtained of
the extent to which transitions at two fold redundant sites
are invariant in the corresponding lineages, which determines the extent to which a clock based on transition
redundant exchanges is overdispersed. We extend this
approach in a preliminary way to other vertebrates, to
show how it might be used in the future as more vertebrate genomes become available.

Results
Calibration of the Transition Redundant Exchange (TREx)
dating tool in mammals
Immediately after two taxa (T and U) arise by speciation,
each gene in one taxon has a corresponding orthologous
gene in the other (Fig. 2). For gene i, the two genomes generate the iT:iU pair. Subsequently, individual genes may be
lost in separate lineages, removing iT:iU pairs. Genes can
undergo further duplication to generate paralogs in one of
the two lineages. Such gene duplications subsequent to
speciation add intertaxon pairs that, although still often
called "orthologs", are associated with different functional implications. It is worth noting that speciation
need not be instantaneous, but that the time for speciation is small relative to geological time. Further, as shown
below, the time taken to speciate generally falls well
within the error of molecular clocks and the fossil record,
making it negligible on these time scales as well.

Assuming no lateral transfer, two orthologous proteins in
two taxa can have diverged no more recently than the date
when the two lineages themselves diverged. Therefore, no
clock should date any intertaxon pair as having diverged
after two taxa diverged. It is possible, however, for an
intertaxon pair to have diverged before the two taxa
diverged (and be so dated). This will be the case, for example, if the last common ancestor of the two taxa already
contained two paralogous genes arising from gene duplication prior to the date of divergence (Fig. 2).
When we consider silent sites within two fold redundant
codon systems where the amino acid has been conserved,

two fractions measure the extent of the divergence of two
sequences. The first, which we denote f2Y, is the fraction (a
number between zero and unity) obtained by dividing the
number of sites where the aligned pyrimidines are the
same, by the total number of such sites in codons for conserved Cys, Asp, Phe, His, Asn, and Tyr amino acids. The
second, which we denote f2R, is the fraction (also between
zero and unity) obtained by dividing the number of sites
where the purines aligned are the same, by the total
number of such sites in codons for conserved Glu, Gln,
and Lys amino acids. Because of these specific constraints,
the sites are unambiguously counted.
If all genes in a lineage diverge with the same transition
rate constant, then we expect the f2Y and f2R values for
orthologous pairs to have binomial distributions centered
around two means, analogous to the flipping of two coins
weighted for the mean values. We can approximate these
as normal distributions clustered around midpoint values. These midpoint values will be characteristic of the
date when the two species diverged, and the rate constants
of pyrimidine-pyrimidine and purine-purine transitions
(respectively) in the time since that divergence. Here, "rate
constant" is used in the chemical sense, and has the units
of changes per site per unit time.

ogy through different paralogs present in the last common
ancestor, should be smaller than those characteristic of
true orthologs (Fig. 2). As the path connecting such pairs
can be much longer than the path connecting two true
orthologs, their f2Y and f2R values can be much lower, even
to the point of indicating that the synonymous sites have
equilibrated.
Thus, if we compare f2Y values between homologous pairs
of proteins drawn from two species (e.g., mouse and rat),
we expect to see a bimodal distribution, with one mode
holding pairs having f2Y values clustering around those
expected for true orthologs, the other at much lower f2Y
values. This is in fact seen (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows histograms
for the f2Y and f2R values for mouse:rat intertaxa gene pairs,
where the number of sites used to calculate the values (nY
and nR) is greater than 50. The histogram shows very few
mouse:rat pairs of genes with values of f2Y or f2R near unity,
a major distribution whose mode is f2Y = 0.88 and f2R =
0.90 respectively, and a substantial number of intertaxon
pairs that have lower f2Y or f2R intertaxa values. Pairs in the
distribution centered at f2Y = 0.88 and f2R = 0.90 represent
presumed rat-mouse orthologs. Pairs having lower f2Y and
f2R values represent intertaxon comparisons between outparalogs [29].

after which sequences within lineages T and U diverged independently. AT and AU represent true orthologs. Pair BT1 and
BT2 represent paralogs. Other pairs of modern proteins are
neither orthologs nor paralogs.

If the replacement of silent nucleotides via these transitions independent at different sites, and if all silent sites in
all genes in a lineage behave the same, the breadth of the
distribution should depending only on nY and nR, the
number of characters used to calculate f2Y and f2R, respectively. Thus, if the two genes have relatively few conserved
two-fold redundant codons, the distributions of f2Y and
f2R should be rather large, just as the distribution of the
outcome of trials of a coin weighted to come up heads
90% of the time will be broad if the trials each contain
only a few coin tosses, but less broad if the trials each contain many tosses.
Other than to the extent expected from a binomial distribution, no pair should have a higher f2Y or f2R than the
mean characteristic of true orthologs (again, assuming no
lateral transfer). In contrast, the f2Y or f2R values for outparalogs [29] (Fig. 2), intertaxon pairs that trace their homol-

In the second mode of this bimodal distribution, a substantial number of intertaxon pairs have f2Y or f2R values ≈
0.59. Values of 0.52–0.54 are expected for protein pairs
whose silent sites have undergone multiple substitutions,
and have therefore equilibrated, if the codon bias is similar in the modern mouse and rat (see below).
The f2Y and f2R values of 0.88 and 0.90, with equilibrated
end points of 0.51 and 0.54, can be converted to distances
based on a simple mathematical transformation, as they
are related to distance (changes per site) by an exponential
equation (see Methods). These distances (the kobst values
from Methods Equation 20) are additive. For f2Y and f2R
values of 0.88 and 0.90, TREx distances are calculated to
be 0.281 and 0.245. If we assume that the midpoint of the
distributions centered at 0.88 and 0.90 correspond to
pairs of true orthologs, emerging at the time of the speciation that led to the emergence of independent mouse
and rat lineages, and that mouse and rat diverged 16 million years ago [30], this implies that 16 × 2 = 32 million
years of total time separate the mouse and the rat. Dividing the observed number of changes per site by the estimated years since divergence, the pyrimidine-pyrimidine
and purine-purine transition rate constants can be estimated to be kobsY = 8.8 × 10-9 changes/site/year and kobsR =
7.7 × 10-9 changes/site/year (note the units of these rate
constants; since generation times are not used to calibrate
this clock, no allowance need be made for different generation times in different lineages). It should be noted that

the date of divergence of mouse and rat, estimated from
the fossil record, is not certain; some molecular clocks
estimate the date of divergences to be as old as 40 Ma. The
estimates for the rate constants scale linearly with changes
in this date of divergence.
Is the codon bias time-invariant within the mouse-rat
clade?
This analysis assumes that the codon bias is time-invariant within this subset of rodents. This is equivalent, under
the model, to the statement that the rate constant for a forward transition (for example, the replacement of a T by a
C), divided by the rate constant for the reverse transition
(in this example, the replacement of a C by a T), is time
invariant, even if the rate constants themselves are not. To
assess the plausibility of this assumption, we examined
the codon bias of mouse and rat. The fraction of T at the
two fold redundant sites involving Cys, Asp, Phe, His,
Asn, and Tyr (feqT) is 0.45 and 0.43 in mouse and rat
respectively. The fraction of A at the two fold redundant
sites for Glu, Gln, and Lys (feqA) is 0.37 and 0.36 in mouse
and rat respectively. This suggests that the codon biases
have been quite similar in the time separating the divergence of mouse and rat.

From these biases, we calculate expected equilibrium end
points for f2R of 0.53 and 0.54 for mouse and rat respectively, and end points for f2Y of 0.52 and 0.51 for mouse
and rat respectively.
It should be noted that we also assume that the codon bias
is equal to the rate constant for the transition of T to C (or,
for purines, from A to G) divided by the rate constant for

the transition of C to T (or, for purines, from G to A). This
is equivalent to the assumption that the codon usage is at
equilibrium. This, in turn, is equivalent to saying that the
transition rate constant (a first derivative) is larger than
the rate of change of the transition rate constant (a second
derivative). This is almost certainly the case within closely
related mammals; it may not be the case, however, in
angiosperm plants, where codon bias seems to be more
rapidly changing [34].
Overdispersion of f2Y and f2R values in mouse:rat
orthologous pairs
If the transition rate constants in different genes are different (even in the same lineage), then the distribution of f2Y
and f2R values in orthologous gene pairs will be broader
than if the transition rate constants for all gene pairs are
the same. We first assumed, as a null hypothesis, that all
of the genes represented in the intertaxon pairs have
diverged with the same rate constants.

If this is true, then the distribution of f2Y and f2R values for
orthologs should broader than expected from a binomial
distribution. To determine whether these values are "overdispersed", we first calculated the breadth of the expected
distribution. As noted above, this depends only on n2Y
and n2R, the number of characters used to calculate f2Y and
f2R. These numbers are different for different pairs of
orthologs. To accommodate this, ca. 3000 mouse:rat pairs
having f2Y and f2R values distributed around 0.88 and 0.90
(right mode of distributions in f2Y and f2R, Fig. 3) were
used as mouse:rat orthologous pairs; this was confirmed
by phylogenic analysis using the Homologene database
(built in May, 2004) and the MasterCatalog (built in

March, 2004). The n2Y and n2R numbers were then determined for each pair; the distribution of n2Y and n2R numbers is shown in Fig. 4. These distributions were fit to a
Poisson distribution, and the mean of the distribution
(lambda) was calculated.
This mean was used as n2Y and n2R to calculate the distribution in the f2Y and f2R values for intertaxon orthologs
that would be expected if all genes diverged with the same
rate constant in this lineage (the null hypothesis, see
Appendix for details). Gaussian curves were then fit to the
observed distributions of f2Y and f2R in the intertaxa
ortholog pairs (Fig. 5, panels a and c). These distributions
had σ values of 0.040 and 0.034, respectively, both modestly larger than the σ values expected from the null
hypothesis (0.030 and 0.028, respectively, compare panels a and c, and panels b and d, in Fig. 5). This suggests
that the f2Y and f2R values are modestly overdispersed. A χ2
analysis confirms that the difference between the expected
and observed distributions is significant. Thus, we are able
to reject the null hypothesis, that all genes in the
mouse:rat lineage suffer transitions a TREx sites with the
same rate constants.
This observation suggests that at least one of the key
assumptions, that the rate constant for transitions is the
same at all sites in all genes, is not a perfect approximation
to reality. This, in turn, suggests that different ortholog
pairs are diverging with different intrinsic rate constants,
giving different intrinsic f2Y and f2R values for different
gene pairs.

The simplicity of the TREx formalism allows a quantitative measure of the extent to which those intrinsic rate
constants differ, however. Assuming that the rate constants for different ortholog pairs were distributed log normally, we asked how broad the distribution in intrinsic f2Y
and f2R values must be to best fit the observed distribution.
This required deconvoluting the intrinsic distribution
from the distribution arising from a finite value for n, and
then determining the distribution in the f values that
might arise from a distribution in the transition rate constants (see Appendix). The σ values associated with the
distribution in f2Y and f2Rvalues arising from different
intrinsic transition rate constants in different genes were
ca. 0.019, less than the σ values expected for a simple
Gaussian model. This implies that the variation in the rate
constants between different genes creates only modest
overdispersion in the distribution. In other words, variation in the rate constants for transitions in different genes
in the mouse:rat lineage contributes to, but does not dominate, the variance observed in f2Y and f2R.
Aggregating f2Y and f2R
One of the shortcomings of the f2Y and f2Rmetrics is that
they are each based on only 20–30% of the codons in a
pair of genes. A plot of f2Y versus f2R (not shown) showed
that the f2Y and f2R values for the mouse:rat intertaxon
pairs were reasonably correlated, and that the pyrimidinepyrimidine and purine-purine transition exchange rate
constants differed by only 14%. As the means of the f2Y
and f2R distributions are therefore not greatly different, we
combined sites undergoing synonymous pyrimidine-pyrimidine and purine-purine transitions to obtain a metric

having a smaller sampling error. We asked whether this
advantage was associated with a corresponding increase in
the dispersion of the metric, which would be expected if
the centers of the f2Y and f2R distributions were greatly different. This combined metric was termed f2.
The f2 histogram for the region for mouse:rat intertaxa
orthologous pairs is shown in Fig. 6. The greater number
of characters used to calculate f2 permitted us to examine
only those pairs where n>100. Accordingly, the distribu-

tion was sharper, with a σapp value, which is derived from
a Gaussian fit to the experimental data, equal to 0.029.
The corresponding simulated data (again assuming all
orthologous pairs diverged with the same rate constant,
and the mean value for n2 obtained by a Poisson fit) had
a σ value of 0.022. Again, a χ2 test showed that the difference was significant, suggesting that there is a difference in
the rate constant in different genes as f2Y and f2R. The ratio
(Rmv) between σ and µ of f2R,f2Y and f2 was calculated

metric. The Rapp value of f2 is smaller than those of f2R and
f2Y, demonstrating that f2 metric is better than the f2R and
f2Y metrics individually.
Applying the f2 metric to the primate-rodent divergence
Moving back in time, the f2 metric was then applied to
examine human:rat and human:mouse intertaxa
sequence pairs (Fig. 7). Here, the true orthologs arose
from duplications at the time of speciation ca. 102 million
years ago (Ma). Again, the observed distribution in f2 values was bimodal. The modes of the distribution representing orthologs for the human:rat and human:mouse
comparisons are both f2 = 0.78. The codon biases used in
humans are 0.37 and 0.45, respectively for feqA and feqT,
close to those in rodents. Using the human codon bias
values, we calculated the expected end points for f2R of

0.53 and for f2Y of 0.50 in human. These are similar to
those calculated for rodents, suggesting again that the
codon bias was essentially invariant in the ancestral
organisms separating rodents from primates.
Although the distribution in Fig. 7 is bimodal, the two
modes are not as cleanly separated as they are in the
mouse:rat comparison. Again, the left mode is interpreted
as representing intertaxon pairs that are human:rodent
outparalogs, arising because duplications more ancient
than the primate:rodent divergence generated paralogs in
the last common ancestor of primates and rodents (causing them to have lower f2R and f2Y values). This is expected,
of course, as the divergence of primates from rodents (ca.
85 Ma) is more ancient than the divergence of mouse
from rat.
To use f2 values to distinguish between orthologous
human:rodent pairs and outparalogous human:rodent
pairs, we returned to a phylogenetic analysis. A family of
proteins that had paralogs in the last common ancestor
should give rise to both orthologous and outparalogous
pairs from its descendents (Fig. 2). The latter diverged
after the former. We therefore expect that within a family,
the intertaxon pairs having the highest f2 values are the

We explored the use of f2 values to distinguish orthologs
from outparalogs within a family for the human:mouse
(Fig. 7c) and human:rat (Fig. 7d) intertaxon pairs. Here,
for families containing both, only the intertaxon pair with
the highest f2 values was included in the histogram. Obviously, the strategy biases the overall calculation towards
slightly higher f2R and f2Y values, especially when paralogization occurred in the family just prior to speciation, causing true orthologs and outparalogs to be confused. It fails
entirely when the family lacks the true ortholog (either
through incomplete gene finding or loss of the true
ortholog in one lineage). In Fig. 7c and 7d, the tail
towards lower f2R and f2Y values presumably reflects gene
loss, given that the human and rodent genomes are com-

the time separating human from mouse is the same as the
time separating human from rat (the root of the
human:mouse:rat tree lies along the segment connecting
the node of the tree and the human sequence), the similarity in the TREx distances is expected. From these data,
we can conclude that the rate constants for transitions in
the lineages represented in the tree by the node-rat and
node-mouse branches were the same, for the average
gene, within a type I statistics error.

pairs from families that had more than one intertaxon pair, the pair with the highest f2 value.
Two options were considered to estimate numerical values for the rate constants for transitions in the time separating human from contemporary rodents. The first
assumes that the rate constants were invariant over the
entire history. The time t since the divergence of rodents
and primates is estimated to be ca. 85 Ma [30], making the
total time between the two modern species ca. 170 MY.
From this, we calculate the average rate constant at two
fold redundant sites for the entire episode between modern rodents and human k2 = k2t/t = 3.6 × 10-9 transitions/
site/year. This is significantly lower than the rate constant
calculated for transitions in the time separating mouse
and rat.
It is well known, however, that genes in the mouse:rat lineage evolved more rapidly than genes in the primate lineages [21]. Therefore, an alternative that does not assume
time-invariance is preferred. Here, we calculate the rate
constant given our knowledge of the rate constants within
the mouse:rat lineage. The mode of the f2 distribution for
mouse:rat was 0.89. Assuming an end point of 0.52, this
corresponds to a TREx distance of kt /2 = 0.260/2 = 0.130
from the modern rodents to their last common ancestor,
and a rate constant (with a divergence 16 Ma) of 8.1 × 109 transitions/site/year (= 0.260/ 32 × 106 years). As the
TREx distances are additive, the TREx distance between the

last common ancestor of mouse and rat to human is 0.613
- 0.130 = 0.483. The time from modern humans to the last
common ancestor of mouse and rat is 156 MY (86 + 86 16). This implies that the average rate constant for the
period of time separating the ancestor of mouse and rat
from humans is 0.483/156 × 106 years = 3.1 × 10.-9 transitions/site/year. This implies that the transition rate constant at silent sites of two fold redundant codon systems
became considerably higher after these rodents diverged.
An analogous analysis can be obtained by explicitly reconstructing the genes in the last common ancestor, and calculating f2 values from these paired to their human
orthologs. Analogous numbers were calculated for other
divergences; for example, the transition rate constant
within artiodactyls was estimated to be 3.0 × 10.-9 transitions/site/year (data not shown). As no completely
sequenced artiodactyls genomes are yet available, this rate
constant is based on many fewer data than the rat-mousehuman rate constants.
Silent two fold sites are not fully equilibrated in time
separating mammals and birds
One standard criticism of any distance metric based on
silent substitutions is that it cannot be applied to very
ancient divergences [1]. As noted above, a clock has max-

imum accuracy when dating events that occurred one
half-life ago. Thus, a clock with a rate constant of 3 × 10.9 transitions/site/year is maximally accurate when dating
events that occurred 116 million years ago (Ma), a time in
the mid Cretaceous before the major mammal orders
diverged, but after placental mammals diverged from
marsupials and monotremes. For those interested in
mammalian biology, a clock based on f2 would appear to
be nearly ideal, especially as more genomes are sequenced
and individual transition rate constants are calculated for
individual branches of an increasingly articulated phylogenetic tree. A clock with this rate constant is, of course,
less ideal to study the divergence of vertebrate classes such
as birds and mammals, which occurred at ca. 2 half lives
ago (ca. 250 Ma).
There is no reason to expect, however, that transitions
occur at the same rates in mammal lineages in the Jurassic
and Cretaceous; such variation is well known, and
observed with the TREx metric in different mammalian
lineages. We therefore asked whether the TREx metric
might be applied to more ancient divergences. A histogram collecting the f2 values for intertaxon gene pairs from
chicken (Gallus gallus) and various mammals is shown in
Fig. 8. The histogram does not display any obvious bimodality, expected as the orthologous intertaxon pairs are
separated by ca. 500 million years. To determine the f2
value expected for pairs whose synonymous sites were
equilibrated, the codon usage in chicken was examined.
Codon usage in birds is similar to codon usage in contemporary mammals (feqA and feqT are 0.38 and 0.42 respectively). If these codon usages are used, then the end points
expected for fully equilibrated silent sites are 0.53 and

0.51 for f2R and f2Y, respectively. The apparent midpoint of
the distribution in the chicken:mammal pairs appears to
be higher (ca. 0.63). This analysis suggests (perhaps
weakly) that the silent sites used to calculate f2 have not
completely equilibrated in the time separating chickens
and humans.
As noted in the discussion of Fig. 7, one way to resolve the
overlap between truly orthologous and outparalogous
pairs is to include in the histogram only the closest pair of
intertaxa proteins within a family, set within a phylogenetic context. The results of applying this strategy to the
chicken:mammal pairs is shown in Fig. 8b. As the chicken
genome was not complete at the time of this writing, this
strategy is expected to be less effective, as many families in
the database will not contain the true ortholog from
chicken. Nevertheless, the maximum in the histogram
shifts to the right (Fig. 8b). This implies that the silent
sites are not fully equilibrated in the time separating contemporary birds from contemporary mammals.
To test the value of this approach where equilibration
almost nearly has occurred, we examined the intertaxa
distribution for Takifugu rubipres (the pufferfish) and
human, first where all homolog pairs are recorded (Fig.
9a), and then where only one pair per family is recorded
(Fig. 9b). While the differences in the two histograms are
not dramatic, and the number of pairs is dramatically
reduced, the average f2 value is shifted slightly to the right
in Fig. 9b compared to Fig. 9a. To determine the significance of this shift, we examined the codon bias in the fish
genome. The feqA and feqT are 0.31 and 0.33 respectively,
making the expected end point = 0.56. The codon bias is

in the same direction as those in other vertebrates, but
more exaggerated. This result does not exclude the possibility that silent sites have not fully equilibrated in the
time separating contemporary fish from contemporary
mammals, but it appears that they have nearly equilibrated. Obviously, as more vertebrate genomes are
sequenced, and ancestral genomes more ancient in the
lineages of fish and tetrapods are constructed, it may be
possible to align ancestral sequences to obtain ancestorancestor TREx distances where the equilibration problem
is mitigated.
Comparing f2 and f4 metrics
It is possible, of course, to exploit four-fold redundant
codon systems at conserved sites to generate an f4 metric
for divergence. All 12 reactions that interconvert the four
nucleotides, including both transitions and transversions
are silent at 4-fold redundant sites. Further, codon bias in
many organisms is more extreme within four fold redundant codon systems, and this codon bias appears to be
more likely to change over geological time. Thus, a comparison of the f2 and f4 metrics offers an opportunity to
determine whether the theoretical advantages proposed
for the f2 metric can be validated experimentally.

Fig. 10 reports f2 and f4 data side-by-side for mouse:rat
intertaxon pairs. As expected, the f4 metric has an equilibrium point that is substantially below the equilibrium
point for the f2 metric. Further, the equilibrium point is

not 0.25, which is what would be expected if all four
nucleotides were present in equal abundance at equilibrium at the four fold silent sites. Instead, the equilibrium
value appears to be somewhere between 0.3 and 0.4,
which is consistent with the known codon biases in
rodents.
The midpoint of the apparent ortholog distribution in the
f4 histogram for mouse:rat pairs is 0.84, compared to 0.89
for f2. This is consistent with the lower equilibrium value
for f4, as well as a smaller rate constant for transversions
relative to transitions. The Rmv of f4 is much greater than
that of f2, suggesting that f4 clock is more overdispersed
than the f2 clock (Table 1).
Comparison of the TREx distance with the dS distance
analyzing silent substitutions
The maximum likelihood dS metric (mldS), developed by
Yang and Nielsen [6] and implemented within the PAML
program [31], also analyzes silent substitutions in aligned
gene sequences. It has been widely used to describe the
evolutionary distance and as a molecular clock [6,32-34].
We therefore compared briefly the features of the TREx
and dS metrics.

A set of putative orthologous pairs was extracted from the
Homologene database (May, 2004 version). The
sequences of each family were aligned using ClustalW and
used for the computation of TREx and mldS. The sequence

pairs having n2 values greater than 100 were then
extracted, as short sequences cannot be appropriately analyzed using either the TREx or mldS tool. The mldS and
TREx distance for each gene pair were calculated and
pooled to form a histogram. The outliers in the multigene
distributions were trimmed from the dataset and various
probability distributions fit to the histograms. The gamma
distribution is best fit to all of the histograms of the three
genome pairs using TREx and mldS metrics (Fig. 11). Rmv
of TREx is slightly smaller than that of mldS in
human:mouse, human:rat while Rmv of TREx is slightly
greater than that of mldS (Table 2). It seems that the TREx
metric is better than mldS in the more distant genome
pairs, for example, human:mouse and human:rat, while
worse than mldS in a closer genome pair, like mouse:rat.
However, the differences in these three genome pairs are
not significant based on χ2 test, indicating that TREx distance is comparable to mldS when estimating distances.
TREx is based, of course, on a simpler model and requires
much less computation time to calculate than mldS.

metric to detect adaptive evolution in proteins [6]. This
metric has been applied to entire genes [40] and entire
databases [41], as well as to episodes of evolution represented by branches on evolutionary trees between ancestral sequences [42,43].

Discussion

Various scientists have therefore introduced parameters to
capture part of this rate variation; the work of Pollock is
especially noteworthy [39]. Even with such parameterization, assumptions and approximations remain. Most
models assume, for example, that all sites of a kind within
a gene accumulate synonymous substitutions with the
same rate constants ("site-invariance"), as do all genes
within a lineage ("gene-invariance"). It is also frequently
assumed that substitution rate constants are the same in
all lineages ("lineage-invariance"), and these are the same
within a lineage over all epochs ("time-invariance").

Ever since molecular evolution was founded [35], scientists have hoped that some feature of a protein or gene
sequence might change at a rate that is sufficiently regular
that it could serve as a distance metric. The utility of such
a metric is ultimately determined by its ability to support
comparisons. At the very least, the metric should be able
to compare distances between genes diverging in the same
lineage, as these have diverged within the same organismic contexts (e.g, mutation rates and generation times).
More ideal would be a clock that would allow the comparison of events recorded in the genome with events
recorded in different genomes, or even with events in the
geological record [36]. Thee goals generate greater
demands, as they require an understanding in lineage-specific difference in rates of divergence, and the connection
between sequence divergence and chronological time.
Many features have been considered for this purpose and
discarded. For example, the fixation of amino acid
replacements does not support well any clock, even for the
purpose of comparing divergences of different genes
within the same organism [37]. Amino acid replacement
are frequently not neutral [38]. In this case, they are driven
by purifying selection and/or adaptive evolution, causing
episodic (slow or fast) rates of accumulation.
Synonymous nucleotide substitutions in coding regions
have been viewed as nearly neutral changes [6,39], which
might avoid these problems. Because these substitutions
do not change the structure of the encoded protein, they
cannot have an impact on fitness at the level of the protein. Indeed, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
substitutions separating a pair of genes is widely used as a

The most widely used clocks based on synonymous substitutions aggregate many different types of synonymous
substitutions. These include substitutions at two, three,
and four fold sites, as well as substitutions at sites that
may (or may not) be silent, depending on events at other
sites. They also aggregate different chemical processes. At
four-fold redundant sites, for example, 12 different rate
processes are associated with the conversion of the four
standard nucleotides to give each of the three others.
There is no reason a priori for these rate constants to be
similar, let alone identical. Indeed, these are known not to
be identical in many lineages. In cases whre they have
been examined, transitions are generally faster than transversions [44].

Empirical evidence suggests that invariances of these types
are only approximations. Evidence for this comes, for
example, from the substantial codon biases found at
silent sites, biases that can differ greatly between organisms [45,46]. Assuming that the representation of nucleotides at a silent site is in equilibrium in a genome, the
ratio of nucleotide Y and X in a genome will be the ratio
of the rate constants (having units of reciprocal time) kX>Y/kY->X, describing the rate of conversion of X into Y and
Y into X, respectively. Different codon biases are therefore
the consequence of time- and lineage-variant rate constants or, more precisely, variance in their ratios.
This work shows that the silent sites at two fold redundant
codon systems are a reasonably useful feature of a coding
sequence for supporting distance measurements. Two features of the distributions in the various histograms presented here are noteworthy. The first is their bimodality.
The right hand mode is interpreted as representing orthologous pairs, intertaxon pairs of genes that diverged at the
same time as the taxa themselves diverged. The left hand
mode is interpreted as arising from outparalogs.

This bimodality is expected, rather than a single mode
with a long tail towards the left (as expected by one referee). Mammalian genomes contain many families (protein kinase, for example) where multiple paralogs arose
prior to the divergence of the principal mammal orders.
Many of these arose near the origin of multicellularity. If
even modest duplication occurred in a family prior to the
divergence of mammals, and if the duplicates have survived, the number of outparalogs in the family will be
greater than the number of orthologs. For example, if 4
paralogous families (A, B, C and D) arose before the divergence of mouse and rat, and all of their members survived,
the family will generate four pairs of true orthologs
(mouseA-ratA, mouseB-ratB, mouseC-ratC, and mouseDratD), and add four "counts" to the right hand mode of a
histogram. The ancestral duplications will generate six
outparalogous pairs. however (mouseA-ratB, mouseAratC, mouseA-ratD, mouseB-ratC, mouseB-ratD, and
mouseC-ratD), which will contribute to the left mode.
The bimodality in the distribution is therefore the consequence of the well-known pattern of recruitment of proteins early in the history of vertebrates. Whole genome
duplications are also ways to create outparalogs.
This bimodality also suggests that f2 values can be used to
identify orthologous pairs, especially in incomplete
genomes. Here, the f2 value can be judged as being consistent, or inconsistent, with the hypothesis of orthology,
with the measured dispersion in the metric used to assess
the likelihood of that judgement. As more tetrapod
genomes are sequenced, as the species trees become more
highly articulated, as individual branch-specific rate constants are estimated, and ancestral sequences are reconstructed, f2 values should be generally useful correlating
the genomic and geological records.
The second feature of the histograms is that they are modestly more dispersed than expected from a simple binomial distribution. We might ask for the cause of the
overdispersion. Kumar and Gadagkar, for example, noted
that some of the kinds of non-stationarity in evolutionary
processes discussed above might cause clocks to fail.
Those that change the composition of sequences at the
leaves of the tree can be measured using the KumarGadagkar disparity metric [3].

We asked whether the overdispersion in the f2 metric correlated with the disparity metric. To determine KumarGadagkar disparity, a compositional distance is measured
between two sequences, an expected compositional distance is estimated (the null hypothesis), the two are compared, and the probability that the observed distance can
be accounted for by the null hypothesis is calculated. Fig.
12 plots this likelihood (x axis) versus f2. If the outliers in
the f2 distribution arose because the orthologous pairs had
a high disparity, a correlation should be observed. One
can see a slight trend, whose significance is difficult to
evaluate, that is consistent with a correlation between disparity and values of f2 lower than expected in the distribution.
Another potential source of the overdispersion seen in the
histograms is different rates of divergence for different
genes on different chromosomes. One suggestion in the
literature is that the X chromosome might suffer divergence at different rates from autosomal chromosomes. To
explore this possibility, f2 values were calculated for
ortholog pairs in the mouse and rat genomes (where chromosome location is largely conserved), and plotted separately (Fig. 13(b)). Here, it is clear that in the rat-mouse
lineage, genes on the X chromosome accumulate transitions at two fold redundant sites more slowly than genes
on autosomal chromosome (Fig 13(a)). Separate examination of individual chromosomes (data not shown)
revealed that no other chromosome was similarly distinctive in this lineage. Interestingly, although similar behavior was observed in the human-mouse and human-rat
comparisons, it was not observed in the human-dog f2
comparison (data not shown).
In a post-genomic age, with the reconstruction of ancient
character states in the sequences of ancient genes and proteins becoming more reliable as each genome is completed, it should be possible to reconstruct the history of
these rate constants in specific lineages between specific
species. It should be noted that these rate constants will be
calibrated from the fossil record, and therefore have the
units of reciprocal time. All other things being equal, they
are expected (from neutral theory) to be faster in lineages
with shorter generation times. In general, calibration for
every lineage will be required, as extrapolation of rate con-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:25

stants where the lineage is calibrated to other lineages will
not, in general, be justifiable. From lineage-specific calibration, it should be possible to determine how well silent
nucleotide substitutions can be modeled as a chemical
reaction process over specific lineages through specific
epochs. This would support the use of silent substitutions
as a molecular clock, if only for the purpose of rejecting
character sets that display insufficient invariance to be
useful.
To this end, this paper makes four contributions. First, we
have described a mathematical formalism, taken from
chemical kinetics, which uses rate constants rather than
probabilities of transitions to describe substitution at
silent sites in encoding genes. This formalism has precedent in the literature of molecular evolution as far back as
Jukes and Cantor [47]. It is largely displaced in molecular
evolution, however, by a formalism based on statistical
language, including reversed Markov Chain models, and
the "approximate methods" discussed by Yang and
Nielsen [6].
The language avoids the need to "correct" for multiple
changes at individual sites. These are frequently required
for various transition probability models [6]. When
enough corrections are made, the two models converge to
the same result. But the mathematical simplicity of the
kinetic model will be valuable for a general analysis, and
especially an analysis to identify and quantitate changing
rates. This includes analyses that calculate rate constants
for ancestral lineages between ancestral nodes in an evolutionary tree and the genome-scale comparison.
Second, using this formalism, we have shown for three
mammalian lineages (human, mouse and rat) that the
variance in the rates for divergence in different gene triplets is not large enough to greatly overdisperse the f2 metric and can be fit by a model that assumes a modest
deviation from a model of gene-invariant transition rate
constants.
Third, we have shown in these mammals that a clock
based on rate constants for transitions at two fold redundant silent sites is most accurate for divergences occurring
ca. 116 million years ago. This makes it extremely valuable to support the analysis of the emergence of new biological function in mammals. An example of this was
recently shown for the aromatase gene family in artiodactyls [2]. This was also shown in analyzing paralogs in the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1].
Last, we have shown that the variance arising from examining four fold redundant sites, where both transitions
and transversions operate, is larger than the variance
observed at two fold redundant sites, where only transi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/25

tions operate. This last point prompted us to directly compare TREx distances with distances obtained from
maximum likelihood dS (mldS) calculations, which are
now being widely used as a clock when applied to analyses of genome comparison and distant homologs.
Compared to mldS metric, the breadth of the TREx distribution between presumed orthologs is comparable to that
of mldS, at least when comparing coding regions of the
human, mouse and rat genomes. This is somewhat surprising, as the TREx method uses fewer characters to establish a distance. At the same time, by focusing on a
narrower set of data that is presumably "better behaved",
the TREx tool discards characters that might cause overdispersion, specifically, the f4 data that is more overdispersed than the f2 data. Therefore, the intrinsic dispersion
of the TREx clock (that based on the number of characters
used to calculate the distance) should always be broader
than the dispersion of the mldS clock. Discarding of
poorer quality data (that from transversions, here represented by the f4 data), which leads to a narrower dispersion, balances the effect from discarding data. This means
that obtaining the theoretical simplicity of the TREx
approach, as well as its shorter computation time (ca. 5
fold faster than mldS) does not require a sacrifice measured in terms of variance.
There is, of course, no reason to believe that the most valuable data to retain, and the selection of data to exclude,
will be the same in all lineages over all times. In plants, for
example, many of the assumptions that are built into a
Poisson model are far worse than in mammals [34]; exclusion of certain characters might be more important. As
more genomes are completed, we will be able to assess
what data are most useful for constructing clocks for any
specific lineage at any specific time. This will allow future
research to exploit multiple genomes to estimate the rate
constants for transitions and transversions, in multiple
contexts, near and far from the chromosomal centromeres, and in the leading and lagging strands (for example), to build a history of transitions and transversion rate
constants throughout the history of mammals, and then
elsewhere.
Further, as various trees become better articulated, it
should be possible to construct ancestral genomes that
determine these rate constants throughout the vertebrate
lineage. This inference comes from the observation that
the TREx sites may not be entirely equilibrated in the time

The f2 values for putative ortholog pairs in rat and mouse are higher if they lie on the X chromosome (panel (b), mean f2 ≈ 0
Figure 13
The f2 values for putative ortholog pairs in rat and mouse are higher if they lie on the X chromosome (panel (b), mean f2 ≈
0.93) than pairs on autosomal chromosomes (panel (a), mean f2 ≈ 0.90), implying that the X chromosome genes have accumulated fewer silent transitions at two fold redundant sites than the typical pair of orthologs. Since fewer than 5% of the genes lie
on the X chromosome, this can account for only some of the overdispersion in the f2 values for rat-mouse orthologs. Interestingly, an analogous phenomenon was not observed in human-canine ortholog pairs (data not shown).

approaches equilibrium via an exponential process, where
the rate constant kR is equal to the sum of the forward rate
constant and the reverse rate constant, that is, kR = kA->G +
kG->A [48]. Also well-known is the fact that at equilibrium,
the ratio of [G]eq to [A]eq, where [G]eq and [A]eq are the
respective concentrations of G and A at equilibrium, is
equal to the ratio of the forward and reverse rate constants, that is, [G]eq/ [A]eq = (kA->G)/(kG->A). These rate constants can be first order if they reflect a single underlying
chemical process. They may appear first order (and hence
are called pseudo first order or apparent first order) if they
collect many chemical processes that are aggregated into a
single rate constant.
This means that if all of the material in a chemical system
is A at t = 0, where t is time, then the fraction of A remaining after time t, expressed as fA = [A(t)]/A0, is given by the
equation:

[A(t )]
= fGeq e −(kA →G + kG→ A )t + fAeq
[A0 ]

(2)

where fGeq and fAeq are the fractions of G and A at equilibrium (that is fGeq = [G]eq/([G]eq + [A]eq) and fAeq = [A]eq/
([G]eq + [A]eq)).
This expression describes accurately the change in the concentration of A in all time regimes, and captures the process by which an individual A is converted to a G, and then
back to A, and then back to G, and so on indefinitely.
There is no need to add terms to the equation, or to make
corrections to reflect the fact that as the system approaches
equilibrium, any particular molecule can undergo an
indefinite number of interconversions, back and forth,
between the two states. A classic discussion of various correction methods needed in stated-based and event-based
models is provided by Gillespie [49].
The fact that corrections are not needed by the formalism
presented here can be seen by examining the detailed derivation of Equation (2). We begin by recognizing that the
net rate of change in the concentration of A is equal to the
rate of conversion of A to G, minus the rate of conversion
of G back to A. This difference is captured in a differential
equation, where each of these microscopic rate processes

Page 18 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:25

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/25

is equal to the rate constant for the reaction multiplied by
the concentration of the reacting species:

−

d[A]
= kA −>G [A] − kG−> A [G]
dt

( 3)

If the initial concentration of [G] = 0, then at any point
during the process, [G] = [A]0 - [A]. Substituting this
expression for [G] into Equation (3) gives:

−

d[A]
= (kA −>G + kG−> A )[A] − kG−> A [A]0
dt

(4)

We then recognize that Equation (4) applies at all points
during reaction, including the point when the reaction
reaches equilibrium. Letting [A]eq represent the equilibrium concentration of A, we write Equation (5), which
holds when the reaction reaches equilibrium:
−

d[A]eq
dt

= (kA −>G + kG−> A )[A]eq − kG−> A [A]0

( 5)

Subtracting Equation (5) from Equation (4) eliminates
the kG->A [A]0 term, giving:
−

d([A] − [A]eq )
dt

= (kA −>G + kG−> A )([A] − [A]eq ) = kR ([A] − [A]eq )

(6)

This equation is readily integrated in the variable [A] [A]eq, which is the deviation of the concentration of A
from the equilibrium value, to give.
ln([A]- [A]eq) = -kRt

(7)

[A] − [A]eq = e −kRt

(8)

[A] = e −kRt + [A]eq

( 9)

To express this as a fraction of [A0], we write:

[A] e −kRt [A]eq
=
+
[A0 ] [A0 ] [A0 ]

( 10 )

This expression for the approach to equilibrium says that
in a reversible first-order process, the approach to equilibrium is an apparent first-order kinetic process, with the
apparent first order rate constant being (kA->G + kG->A) = kR.
Thus, a plot of ln([A] - [A]eq) against t will be linear, with
slope -kR, the sum of the forward and reverse rate constants. Again, this equation accurately describes [A] even
under conditions where A is transformed back and forth
to G an infinite number of times.

which is no more (and no less) than a chemical reaction
interconverting two chemical states. Here, we adopt (as do
others) a null hypothesis that substitution at a site is independent of substitutions at other sites, that the rate constants for substitutions are the same at all sites, and that
the ratio at which two species occupy a silent site is the
ratio of the forward/reverse rate constants. The last
hypothesis simply states that the system is at equilibrium,
a good approximation as long as the rate constants are
large compared to the rate of change of the rate constants.
This constitutes a null hypothesis when examining data.
Consider the case where A and G are nucleotides at n sites
constrained to accept only purines, because these are the
silent, third position, sites of a two-fold redundant codon
system for Lys, Glu, or Gln, where the encoded amino acid
is conserved throughout the period of evolution being
considered. The rate constants kA->G and kG->A now correspond to pseudo-first order rate constants for two transition processes at a silent site, the substitution of A by G
and the substitution of G by A. Let us assume that these
rate constants are time-invariant. We also assume that at t
= 0, the occupancy of A and G in a site is that expected at
equilibrium, fAeq and fGeq respectively, that is, fGeq/fAeq =
fG0/fA0 = kA->G /kG->A, where fG0 and fA0 are the fraction of
sites at t = 0 holding G and A respectively. We also assume
that each site suffers mutation independent of other sites,
and that the forward and reverse transition rate constants
are the same for all sites.
We now consider two identical sequences, where one
(note, this is a single lineage rate constant) is given the
opportunity to diverge. How will the fraction identity at
sites constrained to hold purines diverge in the evolving
sequences? Consider separately the sites that are occupied
by A at t = 0 and the sites that are occupied by G at t = 0.
For those that are originally occupied by A, the sites conserved after time t are those that have A after time t.
The conserved sites arising from A is given by Equation 11:

( fGeq e −kR t + fAeq ) fAeq

( 11 )

where the fAeq term outside of the parentheses represents
the fraction of the starting sites that are occupied by A,
while the term within parentheses describes the fraction
of these that remain A after time t. Note that the parenthetical term is always a number in the range of zero to
unity, and that this expression includes the case where A
has been converted to G, and then back to A, and so on.
The equation describing the number of conserved sites
arising from G as a function of time is similarly derived:

This approach-to-equilibrium kinetic model can be
applied to the analysis of nucleotide sequence divergence,

and 0.4 in both lineages, then the end point ER is ca. 0.52
(= 0.62 + 0.42).

( 12 )

The fraction of all sites having the same purine after time
t as they had at time zero, f2R is the sum of these two equations:
f2R = fAeq fGeq e −kRt + fAeq fAeq + fAeq fGeq e −kR t + fGeq fGeq

( 13 )

TREx distance is from ancestor to its descendent and cannot be calculated directly since we do not know the ancestral sequence. To compute the TREx distance between the
pairwise aligned sequences, equation (20) is transformed
to

Since fG + fA is always equal to unity, we have :

kobsRt = -ln [(f2R - ER)/PR] = TREx distance

(fG + fA)2 = 1

where kobsR is the observed rate constant, which is similar
to kR except that it describes the interconversions between
two descendent sequences from the common ancestral
sequence instead of between ancestral sequence and its
descendent, while t is the time from the ancestor to the
descendent.

(14)

and:
fG 2 + 2fGfA + fA 2 = 1

(15)

for all fG and fA, including fGeq and fAeq. Now, let
ER = fGeq2 + fAeq2
PR = 2fGeqfAeq2

(16)
(17)

therefore,
PR + ER = 1

(18)

The equation (13) can therefore be rewritten to give

f2R = PR e −kR t + ER

( 19 )

Here, the fraction of conserved purine nucleotides at two
fold redundant codon sites follows an exponential first
order approach to equilibrium towards an equilibrium
end point, ER, which reflects the equilibrium fractions
occupied by A and G. Again, this equation correctly handles the possibility of multiple substitutions at a single
site; indeed, this is why the equilibrium is approached.
Solving (19) gives a distance based on transition redundant exchange (TREx) kinetics:
kRt= -ln [f2R - ER)/PR] = TREx distance

(20)

where PR is the pre-exponential term (= 2fAeqfGeq) and ER is
the f2 reached at equilibrium (= fAeq 2 + fGeq 2 (Fig. 1). A
value for kRt can therefore be determined from an f2R value
using Equation (20).
In this model, f2R as a function of time follows a first order
exponential decay from unity to an end point defined by
the expression (fAeq 2 + fGeq 2) (Fig. 1). If A and G appear
with equal frequency (for example, if no codon bias
exists), then the equilibrium end point ER = 0.5. If, however, A and G appear with frequencies of (for example) 0.6

(21)

Using f2R and f2Y to construct molecular clocks
If the rate constants are assumed to be time-invariant, f2R
can be used as a molecular clock. It is a special clock, in
that it considers only sites where the amino acid has not
diverged, constraining the site to accept only a purinepurine transition. Thus, it exploits only two specific rate
constants of the twelve that describe all possible interconversions of the four letters in the genetic alphabet. As discussed below, this formalism becomes especially useful as
we estimate those rate constants for ancestral states.

To implement this clock, we identify sites in a pair of
aligned DNA sequences that are constrained to mutate
between A and G only. The third positions of codons for
three amino acids (Glu, Gln, and Lys) are so constrained
if the amino acid has not been replaced in the interval separating the two genes. In practice, as non-synonymous
substitutions are generally more infrequent than synonymous substitutions, we can ignore the possibility that two
compensatory non-synonymous substitutions have led to
overall amino acid conservation. We therefore examine a
pair of aligned gene sequences for codons encoding a Glu,
Gln, and Lys that are conserved between the two encoded
proteins, and directly calculate f2R for the pair of genes by
counting identities at the third position sites (c) of these
codons, and dividing by n, the number of such sites.
An analogous kinetic expression can be written for pyrimidine-pyrimidine transitions. The third positions of six
amino acids (Cys, Asp, Phe, His, Asn, and Tyr) are constrained to have only T or C, if the encoded amino acid is
conserved in the two encoded proteins. Identification in a
pair of aligned gene sequences of sites at the third positions of codons that encode these amino acids, where the
amino acids are conserved, counting the identities, and
dividing by n, yields f2Y (Y for pYrimidines) for the pair of

genes. Similar TREx distances can be calculated using a
formula analogous to Eq. 21.
Empirical assessment of the value of the TREx clock
The value of a clock depends on several factors. First, the
accuracy of the clock is highest when dating the divergence of genes separated by a time similar to the half-life
associated with the transition rate constant, t1/2 = ln 2/k.
For events occurring near the time of the divergence of the
major mammalian orders ca. 80 million years ago (Ma),
for example, the optimal rate constant would be ca. 4.4 ×
10-9 transitions/site/year, recognizing that 160 million
years in total time separates two contemporary taxa that
diverged 80 Ma (note how we have here doubled the time
to reflect a double lineage process). Further, the TREx
clock would be less valuable if different silent sites within
a gene undergo substitution with different rate constants,
or different genes undergo silent substitutions with different rate constants. Either of these will create an "overdispersed" clock, where the distribution of f2 values is larger
than expected from a Poisson process given the number of
sites used to estimate a distance[50,51]. Last, the clock is
less valuable if the rate constants for various transitions
are not time-invariant over the period of evolution being
considered.

We first assessed the value of the clock by looking for overdispersion in mammals and other vertebrates. To this end,
we examined f2R and f2Y for a series of inter-taxa pairs of
homologous genes for a variety of vertebrate genomes.
For inter-taxon analyses, families in the MasterCatalog
(EraGen Biosciences) were identified that contained at
least one representative protein from both of the taxa of
interest. For these families, all inter-taxa pairs of genes
were extracted, together with the pairwise protein
sequence alignment. A pairwise alignment of the DNA
sequences was then generated to follow the protein
sequence alignment. If a family contained more than one
sequence of a species belonging to one of the taxa analyzed, then those sequences were checked to determine
whether they include redundant sequences (PAM < 1, f2 >
0.99). If this was the case, only one of the redundant
sequences was retained. For g genes from one taxon and h
genes from the other within a family, there were g×h intertaxa pairs.
For each pair, the homologous codons that matched identical amino acids in the pairwise protein sequence alignment were then noted, and the identity/non-identity of
the nucleotide present at the silent site recorded. Separate
statistics were kept for codons of different redundancy
(six, four, three, and two fold redundant codon systems).
For each pair, the fraction identical, f, was recorded for
each class of codon, and each type of difference. Thus, f2 is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/25

the fraction of identical nucleotides at two fold redundant
sites, f2R is the fraction of identical nucleotides at two fold
redundant sites involving purine-purine transitions, f2Y is
the fraction of identical nucleotides at two fold redundant
sites involving pyrimidine-pyrimidine transitions, and f4
is the fraction of identical nucleotides at four fold redundant sites.
A package was implemented using JAVA, PL/SQL, PERL
language and Bioperl toolkit [52]. All computation was
carried out in a Class I Beowulf cluster based on an IBM®
eServer xSeries 250 (IBM Inc) as a file server, which is facilitated with 4 Intel® Xeon™ processors, 300 GB RAID storage system, and 9 other commodity personal computers
(HP Inc) with the installation of Linux operating system
(Redhat 8.0). The cluster is networked through a standard
10/100 Mb Ethernet and the data is stored in the file sever
using NFS (network file system) protocol. The relational
database management systems Mysql and Oracle were
used to manipulate the databases.
Sequence manipulations were aided by the Darwin bioinformatics package [53]. The starting point for this analysis
was families of all protein sequences contained within
GenBank 114. These sequences were extracted, and subjected to an all-against-all comparison [54]. The resulting
matches were grouped into a MasterCatalog (EraGen Biosciences, Madison WI) containing 32595 families holding
445185 amino acid sequences. PAM distances between
matches were calculated with variances using the Darwin
PamEstimator routine. Multiple sequence alignments and
evolutionary trees were likewise calculated using the Darwin programming environment. The Darwin package can
be obtained by sending an email request to
cbrg@inf.ethz.ch.
Codon biases were obtained from the CUTG (Codon
Usage Tabulated from GenBank) made available by the
Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation, Japan
(kazusa.or.jp/codon/).
To simulate the expected behaviour within families of
proteins, based on the assumption of a random process, a
computer program has been developed. As input for the
simulation, we require the number of characters. This
number, however, differs with different gene pairs. Therefore, as a first step, a Poisson distribution is fit to the
number of characters for the p protein families using the
statistics package presented in Matlab (see Fig. 4 below for
an example). From this, the λ value representing the distribution of n is determined. Given this λ, a simulation
generates the distribution of f-values around a mean,
based on the null hypothesis that all sites within a gene
and all of the gene pairs have diverged with the same rate
constants. Thus, if p pairs of protein are being used, the

Page 21 of 24

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:25

characters from each are concatenated to give a supersequence to obtain the midpoint of the distribution. This is
then used, with λ, as an input in the simulation to obtain
the distribution of f-values for the p pairs. In the simulation, the Poisson process is assumed, that is, site is equally
likely to suffer a substitution, second substitutions are as
likely at a site as the first, and the pattern of substitutions
is the same at each site.
Determining variation in f values arising from variation in
the rate constants for transitions in different genes
As an approximation (and a null hypothesis), we first
assume that all synonymous sites in all two fold redundant codon systems within a gene suffer transitions with
the same rate constant. We also assume, when comparing
f values and TREx distances for different gene pairs, that all
genes diverge with the same transition rate constants at
synonymous sites. The second approximation is equivalent to the assumption that different genes do not lie in
hot and cold spots in the chromosome in the same
genome. These assumptions are needed to use TREx distances to order (in rank) dates of divergence of individual
paralog pairs within a single genome and to correlate
events recorded in the genome with dated events in the
paleontological and geological records.

While these approximations certainly generate the simplest model for divergent evolution at synonymous sites,
they need not be good to any particular degree of accuracy. It is conceivable that some proteins lie in hot spots
on a chromosome. Certain segments of a DNA sequence
(CpG islands, for example) are known to undergo change
with different rate constants.
For these reasons, the degree to which this approximation
holds should be tested empirically. According to the null
hypothesis, the expected value for f (which represents any
type of f value, including f2) should be the same for each
pair of homologous proteins diverging at the same time.
Because a finite number of characters is used to calculate
f, the values for f should be distributed around this
expected value binomially; this converges to a normal distribution when the sample size becomes large. The
number of characters used to calculate f is typically 125,
and the number of genes being compared is typically on
the order of several thousand. Thus, the sample size is
large enough that a Gaussian curve is a suitable approximation, where the σ value should be a function only of
the number of characters used to calculate f (in the discussion here, this number is designated n). The corresponding Gaussian probability distribution has the following
form:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/25

( f0 − f )2

−

2
P( f ) =
e 2σ
( 22 )
σ 2π
where P(f) is the probability of a pair having a value of f,
and f0 is the mean expectation value for f.

If there is also a distribution in the rate constants between
different genes, the corresponding expectation values for f
should also be distributed, however. This implies that the
observed distribution in the values of f should be broader
than the theoretical distribution arising from a finite n.
This is because a variance in underlying rate constants will
create a breadth in the f distribution, as well as the fact
that f is calculated from a finite set of characters.
No good arguments exist to choose a particular distribution for the expected f0 values. We have therefore simply
assumed that the rate constants are distributed log normally, creating a distribution of the expectation values for
f for different genes that is distributed normally around f0.
In other words:
−

where D(fk) is the distribution of genes with different

These two distributions can be convoluted to create a new

where the apparent standard deviation σapp is related to
the theoretical σ and ρ by the expression:

( 26 )

This relationship allows us to estimate the breadth of the
observed distribution in f values that arises from different
genes in a collection having different rate constants, if the

number of characters used to calculate the distribution n
is known. First, one determines the value for σ expected
for the collection based on the value of n. Then, one fits a
normal distribution to the set of experimental data showing a distribution of f values, and estimates a value for
σapp. One then obtains a value for ρ from equation (12),
obtained from equation (11).

This provides an estimate of the distribution in the expectation values for f that rise from different genes in the set
