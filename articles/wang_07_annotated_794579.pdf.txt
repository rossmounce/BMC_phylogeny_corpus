Abstract

Background

S. invicta is one of the most extensively studied ant species.
Also known as the red imported fire ant because of its accidental introduction to the United States from South America
in the early 1900s and because of its painful, burning sting,
this species has become a major agricultural and wildlife pest

information

With the advent of new molecular and genomic techniques it
is becoming possible to identify the genes underlying social
behavior [3,4], as well as those involved in other interesting
behaviors and traits. Unfortunately, in ants such studies have
been seriously constrained by the lack of sequence data and
other molecular tools. The majority of ant gene sequences
have derived from two studies. A recent experiment examined
differential gene expression in fire ants between winged vir-

gin queens and wingless mated queens [5]. From this study 81
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were submitted to GenBank.
Another study, focusing on gene expression changes during
the development of Camponotus festinatus workers, yielded
384 ESTs [6]. While informative, both of these studies were
limited by the small number of genes examined. The goal of
this project was, therefore, to create and sequence a much
larger set of ant ESTs, namely for the ant Solenopsis invicta.
Used in conjunction with DNA microarray technology [7,8],
this sequence resource will allow us and other researchers to
examine thousands of ant genes simultaneously.

interactions

Ants are important model species for sociobiology and behavioral ecology [1]. Life in an ant colony is marked by cooperation, but it also harbors conflicts. Both aspects have been
studied extensively to understand the prerequisites for social
behavior and to test the kin selection theory (reviewed in [2]).
Other fascinating research areas in ants include self-organization, life-history evolution, as well as division of labor.

refereed research

Ants display a range of fascinating behaviors, a remarkable level of intra-species phenotypic
plasticity and many other interesting characteristics. Here we present a new tool to study the
molecular mechanisms underlying these traits: a tentatively annotated expressed sequence tag
(EST) resource for the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. From a normalized cDNA library we obtained
21,715 ESTs, which represent 11,864 putatively different transcripts with very diverse molecular
functions. All ESTs were used to construct a cDNA microarray.

in the southern USA [9]. In attempts to control this species,
its basic biology has been well elucidated [10,11]. Studies on
S. invicta led the way in a number of research areas important
for evolutionary biology: nest-mate conflicts over reproduction [12,13], sex-ratio conflicts [14,15], nepotism [16], chemical communication and warfare [17,18], and social evolution
[19]. A particularly fascinating aspect of fire ant biology is that
two distinct types of social organization exist in this species,
and this is linked to a single gene, Gp-9 [20-22]. Colonies of
the monogynous form are headed by a single reproductive
queen with a specific Gp-9 genotype (BB), while colonies of
the polygynous form contain up to several hundred reproductive queens that are all Gp-9 heterozygotes (Bb). The number
of queens is regulated by workers, which will kill or tolerate
additional queens based on their own and the queens' Gp-9
genotype [22]. This is one of a few cases where a complex
social behavior is governed by a simple genetic mechanism.
We describe here a collection of 21,715 S. invicta ESTs generated from a normalized cDNA library. This library should
encompass a maximum variety of genes, as it was derived
from mRNA of all developmental stages of queens, males and
workers from both colony types. Sequence assembly resulted
in 11,864 putatively different genes. We have used a combination of blast analysis and protein pattern searches to obtain a
preliminary Gene Ontology (GO) annotation for these genes.
By comparison to the honey bee, we identified 23 potential
Hymenoptera-specific genes. All ESTs were used to generate
a high-density cDNA microarray, which will be a valuable
resource for molecular, ecological and evolutionary studies in
ants.

developmental stages and castes (workers, queens, and
males) of both the monogynous and polygynous social forms.
First, we sequenced the 5' ends of 22,560 clones from the
cDNA library. This yielded a total of 28,113 sequence reads,
since about one-fourth of all clones were sequenced twice.
From this set we then removed artifactual sequences and
sequences smaller than 200 base pairs (bp; after vector and
primer clipping), identifying 21,715 high-quality ESTs of 522
bp average length (Table 1).
To find redundant transcripts, the 21,715 ESTs were assembled into contiguous sequences (contigs, Table 1) using the
Paracel Clustering Package. A total of 14,170 ESTs were
assembled into 4,319 contigs, while the remaining 7,545 ESTs
remained singleton sequences. In sum, there were 11,864
gene sets, hereafter referred to as assembled sequences, that
putatively represent different transcripts. However, this
number is expected to overestimate the true number of transcripts represented because some non-overlapping ESTs may
represent the same gene and because assembly may have
failed in case of alternative splicing, sequence polymorphism
or sequencing errors. Assessed with a second independent
method, the number of putatively different fire ant transcripts was indeed estimated at 'only' 9,770 (see below). The
average length of all assembled sequences was 600 bp.
Since some of the cDNA clones were sequenced several times,
1,262 of the 4,319 contigs are due to re-sequencing, that is,
composed of sequences of a single re-sequenced clone. The
remaining 3,057 contigs are 'true contigs', that is, derived
from at least two independent cDNA clones (Table 1).

Figure 1b depicts the 'best hit' for the 3,964 fire ant assembled
sequences displaying significant similarity to known or predicted protein-coding genes. The best hit was a honey bee
gene 61.6% of the time. This was expected, as the honey bee is
the most closely related species with a fully sequenced
genome. Due to the paucity of non-honey bee hymenopteran
sequences in GenBank, for only 106 (2.7%) assembled
sequences was the best hit a known ant gene; and only 41

information

We used the blastx algorithm to compare the 11,864 fire ant
assembled sequences to the nr database. Of these, 2,936
(24.7%) and 3,964 (33.4%) assembled sequences matched
known or predicted protein-coding genes at a cutoff expectation value (E) of 1e-20 and 1e-5, respectively (Figure 1a). By
contrast, 6,431 (54.2%) had no similarity at all to genes in the
nr database (E > 1). For many of these 6,431 clones, the lack
of detectible similarity may be because the sequenced region
does not encompass a long enough ORF to meet the blastx
comparisons' cutoff of 1. This may result from 5' truncation of

cDNA clones (causing ESTs to consist mostly or entirely of 3'
untranslated region), from a long 5' untranslated region, or
from priming in intron regions of the pre-mRNAs. Alternatively, transcripts may lack large ORFs because they are short
or because they are noncoding RNAs (that is, transcripts
other than rRNA or tRNA that do not code for proteins). Noncoding RNAs are now thought to make up a considerable portion of the polyadenylated transcripts found in libraries such
as ours [24,25]. For instance, in humans 57% of all polyadenylated transcripts might be noncoding RNAs [26].

To assess overall sequence quality, we computed the number
of unresolved bases, marked as N by the base-calling program
phred, present in all ESTs and assembled transcripts. The
majority of sequences (83.7% of assembled sequences and
81.3% of all ESTs) had no unresolved bases. Another 15.8% of
assembled sequences and 17.5% of ESTs had between one and
three unresolved bases. Finally, a small percentage of
sequences (0.5% of assembled transcripts and 1.2% of ESTs)
had more than four unresolved bases.

reports

Consistent with the expectation that the fire ant cDNA clones
were sequenced from the 5' end, 92.2% of all assembled
sequences with significant similarity to a gene in the nonredundant (nr) database were encoded on the plus strand.
This estimate was obtained by counting how many times the
open reading frames (ORFs) of the fire ant assembled
sequences matched that of their best homologs in other
organisms (see next section). However, a small percentage of
the ant assembled sequences (7.8%) appeared to be encoded
on the minus strand. This could be due to non-specific
annealing of the SMART adaptors, to transcription of an adjacent gene pointing in the opposite orientation, or to the presence of antisense transcripts in our library.

reviews

E=1

The number of 3' truncated transcripts was harder to estimate
because most cDNA clones (52.8%) were not sequenced all
the way through to their 3' end (that is, the 5' sequence reads
were shorter than most cDNA clones). Nevertheless, since
39.3% of all fire ant ESTs ended with a polyA sequence, up to
39.3% of our ESTs may have an intact 3' end. This is, however,
likely to be an overestimate, as not all polyA sequences are
true polyA tails.

comment

served among Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens. In total, 1,827 fire ant assembled
sequences had a highly significant blastx hit (E ≤ 1e-20) to the
Drosophila KOG proteins. Among these, 749 (41%) had
regions of similarity that started within the 20 first aminoterminal amino acid residues of their Drosophila homologs
with either an in-frame methionine at the same position as
the fruitfly start methionine (588) or upstream of the alignment start (161). This suggests that up to 41% of the assembled sequences might have an intact 5' end, whereas the
remaining 59% are probably 5' truncated.

hymenopteran species other than ants or the honey bee. An
additional 953 (24.0%) fire ant assembled sequences were
most similar to genes from non-hymenopteran insect species.
Of these, 359 and 417 had best matches to fruitfly and mosquito genes, respectively. Interestingly, a subset of 320 genes
(8.1%) shared their closest similarity with vertebrates, which
is an observation that has also been made for the honey bee
[27]. Other assembled sequences were most similar to genes
from Nematoda (11) or other Animalia (26). Several had best
matches to bacteria (4) or protozoa (13), possibly because
these sequences were derived from microbes that infect fire
ants or that have a commensal relationship with them. Alternatively, these sequences could be due to microbial contaminations acquired during sample collection. Finally, 17
assembled sequences appeared to be derived from viruses,
including the recently identified S. invicta SINV-1 and SINV1A viruses [28,29].
Interestingly, for 1,341 fire ant assembled sequences the best
hit was a non-hymenopteran gene (bacterial, viral and protozoan hits excluded). This could be due to extensive sequence
divergence between ant-bee gene pairs or gene loss in the bee.
We examined these two alternatives using the recently completed and annotated honey bee genome sequence [30]. Most
fire ant genes with a non-hymenopteran best hit (80.5%;
1,080/1,341) had a significant blastx hit to an annotated
honey bee gene (Additional data file 1). Using tblastx, blastn
or Ensembl (v38 Apr 2006 [31]) honey bee gene predictions,
an additional 69 fire ant genes showed evidence for a potential honey bee homolog (Additional data file 1). Thus, for
these 1,149 assembled sequences, sequence divergence is the
likely reason for a non-hymenopteran best hit. Such sequence
divergence could be due to directional selection in the honey
bee lineage. The remaining 192 (14.3%) assembled sequences
do not display significant similarity to the honey bee genome
(Additional data file 1). This could be because some ant
sequences are too short to meet the significance threshold for
similarity (1e-5), extreme sequence divergence, or putative
gene loss in the honey bee lineage.
We also used the blastx analysis described as an alternative
method to estimate the number of unique fire ant genes
sequenced. A total of 3,366 fire ant assembled sequences
matched 2,772 different honey bee proteins, suggesting that
82.4% (2,772/3,366) of the fire ant assembled sequences may
be unique. Thus, the 11,864 fire ant assembled sequences may
represent 9,770 different genes. Assuming that the fire ant
and the honey bee have a similar total number of genes (that
is, 13,448 to 20,998 predicted genes, Ensembl v38 April 2006
[31]), this would represent approximately 46.5% to 72.7% of
the genes in the fire ant genome.
In addition to the above-mentioned blastx searches to identify putative protein-coding genes, we carried out two other
genomic analyses. First, to identify potential noncoding
RNAs among the fire ant assembled sequences, we compared

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/1/R9

all assembled sequences via blastn to known noncoding RNAs
from the NONCODE database [32] and the miRBase microRNA collection [33]. Consistent with the view that noncoding
RNAs are often poorly conserved across taxa [25], the vast
majority of fire ant sequences had no significant hits in these
databases (E > 1e-5). Only one fire ant transcript
(SiJWG03CAD.scf) was highly similar (E = 3e-14) to a known
human microRNA (miRBase ID: hsa-mir-594). Second, we
identified 772 assembled sequences conserved between the
fire ant and the honey bee that fulfilled the following conditions: no resemblance to any known protein in the nr database (blastx, E > 1e-5), a good blastn hit against the honeybee
genome (E ≤ 1e-5), and no significant blastn hit against other
organisms (E > 1e-5). This list of genes (Additional data file 2)
is likely to include transcripts with conserved untranslated
region sequence motifs and some additional noncoding
RNAs. However, it may also contain ant protein-coding genes
that failed to have a blastx hit because they are truncated or
because their honey bee homolog failed to be predicted during genome annotation.

Functional annotation
Provisional functional annotation of the fire ant assembled
sequences was done by adopting the GO annotation of the
best-matching homologs in the nr database. At a blastx Evalue cutoff of 1e-5, 3,964 fire ant assembled sequences displayed matches to proteins in the nr database. Of these, 3,035
(76.6%) could be annotated into at least one of the three main
GO categories (biological process, molecular function, or cellular component) and 1,617 (40.8%) were in all three. The distribution of the fire ant assembled sequences among the main
subcategories is summarized in Table 2 and the full GO
assignments are in Additional data file 3. The most frequently
identified molecular functions were 'binding' and 'catalytic
activity' and those for biological process were 'physiological
process' and 'cellular process' (Table 2). In addition to the
annotation through blastx searches, GO classifications were
assigned to fire ant assembled sequences based on the Prosite
protein domains they contain (Table 2, Additional data file 4).
These two GO annotations were then contrasted with the GO
annotation of the D. melanogaster genome: The relative
counts of fire ant genes were significantly different (hypergeometric distribution: p < 1e-8) from the relative counts of
Drosophila genes in up to 23 second-level GO categories
(Table 2). This could indicate that these gene categories are
over- or underrepresented in the fire ant genome relative to
the Drosophila genome. Alternatively, these gene categories
may simply be biased in cDNA libraries relative to genomes,
for instance, because they contain mainly highly or mainly
lowly expressed genes. GO groupings and subcategories can
be further explored using the AmiGO feature [34] of the Fourmidable database. As the annotations are automated, all
functional assignments are tentative and considered at the
'inferred from electronic annotation' (IEA) level of evidence
(see [35]).

Being a Hymenopteran
The ants are classified within the order Hymenoptera, a
group of insects including ants, bees and wasps. To identify
Hymenoptera-specific genes, we looked for fire ant sequences
that exhibited similarity only to genes from the honey bee or
other Hymenoptera species. Using stringent criteria, we identified 148 fire ant sequences with strong similarity to the
honey bee genome (tblastx, E < 1e-10) but no similarity to
other known sequences (tblastx against non-hymenopteran
sequences of the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
release 88; E > 1).
As the fire ant sequences are not necessarily full-length, the
region of ant-bee homology, while apparently Hymenopteraspecific, may be part of a larger and phylogenetically conserved protein. To investigate this possibility, we examined
the surrounding honey bee genomic sequence (±5,000 bp) of
each candidate Hymenoptera-specific gene. Genes predicted
by homology with other organisms were found near most of
our putative ant-bee pairs. These regions of ant-bee homology may simply be fragments of known genes that diverged
in ants and bees. However, for 23 ant-bee gene pairs (Table 3,
Figure 2, Additional data file 5), the predicted neighboring
genes are either specific to bees or are transcribed in the
opposite direction. Unless the region of ant-bee homology is
part of a conserved gene with a large intron (that is, >5,000
bp), these 23 ant-bee gene pairs are strong candidate
Hymenoptera-specific genes.
Further examination of these 23 candidate genes in
hymenopteran species could prove interesting for understanding shared features. For instance, all Hymenoptera species have a haplodiploid sex determination system, with
males developing from unfertilized haploid eggs and females
from fertilized diploid eggs. Another feature found in many
Hymenoptera is social behavior. Social behavior evolved
independently in ants, bees and wasps [36,37] and, thus, it
may be possible that a subset of the 23 ant-bee gene pairs was
permissive for sociality to evolve or is important for social
behavior.

Behavior genes
To identify candidate genes that might be involved in the
complex behavior of ants we compared the fire ant assembled
sequences to a set of 106 Drosophila genes that are directly
implicated in behavior [27]. Of these behavior genes, 17 (16%)
matched at least one fire ant assembled sequence (Table 4).
This value is less than the 44% (47/106; chi-squared, p < 5e9) identified by the honey bee brain cDNA library [27], possibly because the honey bee cDNA library was specifically
derived from brain tissue. We also compared the fire ant
assembled sequences to all 636 Drosophila genes that had the
GO annotation 'behavior'. Of these, 81 (13%) were good hits
for at least 1 fire ant assembled sequence (Additional data file
6). In addition, some genes involved in complex behaviors in

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/1/R9

ants and other Hymenoptera may be specific to this taxon and
not homologous to known genes.

Viruses
In analyzing the cDNA library we noticed the presence of several viral transcripts. Seventeen fire ant assembled sequences
were most similar to viral genes from RNA or DNA viruses
(blastx, E < 1e-5; Table 5). Three sequences correspond to the
recently identified SINV-1 virus, which possibly affects brood
survival in Solenopsis invicta [28]. As the mutation rate in
viruses can be high, we relaxed the E-value cutoff stringency
to 1e-2, which yielded an additional nine putative viral genes.
Based on different patterns of co-expression across several
microarray experiments (unpublished data) the 26 putative
viral genes could represent at least 5 different viruses.
To verify that these ESTs are from fire ant viruses and not
from viruses infecting the insects fed to the ants, we tried to
re-amplify all putative viral ESTs from fire ant cDNA derived
from eggs, larvae and pupae. Out of 26 ESTs, 15 amplified
when using egg and/or pupal cDNA as a template. Since eggs
and pupae do not eat and either lack an intestine or have emptied their intestine, these 15 ESTs most likely stem from genuine fire ant viruses. Another five ESTs, including the three
SINV-1 ESTs, amplified only in ant larvae. For these larvaespecific ESTs and the remaining six ESTs that amplified in
none of the cDNA categories tested, additional tests would be
needed to verify that they stem from fire ant viruses.
Further characterization of viruses in fire ants may be useful
for two main reasons. First, as fire ants are an invasive pest
species that causes considerable economic damage in the
southern USA and other locations, viruses have been suggested as possible agents of fire ant control. Second, viruses
can have dramatic effects on the behavior of their hosts. For
instance, the Kakugo virus has been suggested to increase the
aggressiveness of honey bee workers, as infected workers are
much more likely to defend the nest against hornets than
non-infected nestmates [38]. Another virus is most likely
involved in superparasitism behavior in the parasitoid wasp
Leptopilina boulardi [39]. It would be interesting to determine if the viruses identified by our EST project manipulate
fire ant behavior to promote viral transmission or if they
could be used for fire ant control.

Longevity
Ant queens and workers show up to ten-fold lifespan differences, although they develop from the same eggs and are thus
genetically identical [1]. Lifespan differences must, therefore,
stem from differences in gene expression, making ants a
useful system to study aging and lifespan determination
[40,41]. The average lifespan of fire ant queens is estimated at
six to seven years [42], while workers are thought to have an
average lifespan of ten to 70 weeks [1]. We have identified fire
ant homologs (blastx, E < 1e-20) to several genes that are
likely involved in determining the lifespan of invertebrate

To permit functional genomic analysis for the fire ant we produced a cDNA microarray using all 22,560 clones sequenced
from the cDNA library. We successfully PCR-amplified
17,685 (78.4%) cDNAs (only one strong band, Additional data
file 8), which putatively represent 10,122 (85.3%) of the fire
ant assembled sequences (Additional data file 9). To evaluate
the percentage of cDNA spots derived from legitimate and
sufficiently highly expressed transcripts, we examined the
signal-to-background ratio of all spots in four test hybridizations (for details and additional analysis see Additional data
files 10, 11 and 12). The two samples compared were derived
from a mix of adults (workers, virgin queens, and males from
both colony types in equal amounts) and a mix of brood (eggs,
larvae and pupae of all castes in equal amounts). Of the spots
derived from a single good PCR product, 82.8% (14,642/
17,685) had an interpretable signal (that is, signal intensity
greater than background plus two standard deviations), indi-

In total, 67 contigs contained more than 10 ESTs (Additional
data file 7). Consistent with the hypothesis that these are
highly expressed genes, we found several homologs to

clones. Based on blastx searches this gene encodes a small (74
amino acid residue) protein of unknown function. Interestingly, this gene is highly conserved across vertebrates, arthropods and fungi. For instance, the putative fire ant protein and
its zebra fish homolog share 79% amino acid residues. While

Future prospects
The extraordinary complexity and diversity of morphology,
behavior, and social organization in ants is far from being
understood from a molecular genetics point of view. The
present work, the largest collection of ESTs for an ant species,
provides a valuable sequence, clone, and genomic resource
for the ant research community. Using this resource it will be
possible to identify genes important in caste determination,
behavioral genetics and plasticity, chemical communication,
and population control. This microarray should also allow
comparisons across related species. More broadly, as the
genome sequence for the social honey bee, Apis mellifera, is
available and that for the solitary wasp, Nasonia vitripennis,

will soon arrive, comparisons and contrasts of both gene
sequence and expression among the three species might shed
light onto hymenopteran biology, behavior and social
organization.

Conclusion

We have sequenced 22,560 ESTs from a normalized fire ant
cDNA library and assembled them into 11,864 putatively
unique transcripts. Using comparative genomic analyses and
the GO vocabulary, we have functionally annotated the fire
ant ESTs into a broad range of molecular functions and biological processes. Examination of the fire ant genes has led to
the identification of 23 putative Hymenoptera-specific genes.
Finally, we have developed a cDNA microarray that will be
useful for large-scale gene expression profiling.

Ants

Using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
total RNA was isolated from various samples of both monogynous and polygynous nests: eggs, small larvae, mediumsized larvae, sexual larvae, as well as pupae and adults of
males, workers and queens (including both virgin and mated
queens). We then pooled about 1 μg of each RNA sample to
create a master sample with a maximum diversity of transcripts. This master sample was precipitated once with LiCl to
eliminate contaminating DNA, quality checked on a 1% agarose gel and a Bioanalyzer 2100 chip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) and sent in ethanol to Evrogen (Moscow, Russia) for
cDNA library construction.

remove vector and SMART adaptor sequence, as well as to
mask polyA tails and other repetitive sequences. In addition,
Paracel was used to identify and assemble redundant transcripts: ESTs that had an overlap of >50 bp were, when possible, automatically assembled into contiguous sequences
(contigs). ESTs that did not meet this criterion were called
singletons.
In order to find homologs of the fire ant assembled sequences
in other organisms, all singletons and contigs were used to
interrogate public sequence databases. Blast sequence
alignments [49,50] were performed using the Blast Network
Service provided by the Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics or
on a desktop PC using standalone blast software. For both
blastx and blastn searches the default settings were used. Evalues are reported at 1e-5, except where indicated otherwise.

Monogynous and polygynous fire ant colonies were collected
in Georgia (USA) in 2003 and 2004 and transferred to the
laboratory as previously described [45]. Colonies were maintained in climate-controlled rooms at 25°C and fed with crickets, mealworms, a mix of vegetables, and a mix of canned tuna
fish, dog food and peanut butter. Samples were collected
manually and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

refereed research

For 22,560 clones selected at random from the cDNA library,
approximately 600 bp-sequence reads were obtained from
the insert 5' end. Of these clones, 5,573 were sequenced in
duplicate (mostly both times from the 5' end, with the
exception of 77 clones that were sequenced from both the 3'
and the 5' end). The primer used for the first approximately
8,000 sequences was SMART tag2 5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACG-3' (which forms a 1 bp mismatch, in
bold); the primer used for all other sequences was SMART
tag2 fixed 5'-AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTACG-3'
(which matches perfectly). Sequencing was done by Synergene (Schlieren, Switzerland) on plasmid DNA extracted
from overnight cultures. Base calling was performed with
phred [47,48]. The Paracel Clustering Package (Paracel,
Pasadena, CA, USA) was used to filter low-quality sequences
(base calls with phred values <15 and EST length <200 bp), to

Sequencing and sequence analysis

reports

Evrogen constructed a normalized cDNA library using the
SMART technology, which should enrich for full-length
sequences. The plasmid used was pAL16. Based on PCR
amplification of the inserts of 2,300 clones, the mean and
median cDNA clone length was estimated at 940 bp and 850
bp, respectively. The shortest cDNA clone from this subset
measured 180 bp, while the longest one measured about
3,300 bp. By comparison, the average Drosophila cDNA
clone was 2 kb and the longest clone was 8.7 kb [46], suggesting that the fire ant cDNA library has many short clones that
do not represent the entire transcriptional unit. Although the
fire ant cDNA library is not directional, a 2 bp difference
between the 3' and 5' SMART adaptors on all inserts permits
sequencing cDNA clones specifically from the 5' end.

We used the blastx algorithm to compare all 11,864 assembled sequences against the nr protein database. Using the
best GO annotated SwissProt or TrEmbl hit with an E-value ≤
1e-5, we annotated our transcripts at the IEA evidence level.
Additionally, we scanned all assembled sequences for Prosite
patterns with the stand-alone ps_scan perl program using the
default cutoff level of 0 [51]. Transcripts having a Prosite pattern with a GO annotation were also annotated with the same
GO terms at the IEA evidence level. In order to compare the
fire ant GO annotations to those of D. melanogaster, we
downloaded the D. melanogaster genome GO annotation
from [52] on 19 September 2006. The WEGO web tool [53]
was used to calculate the relative numbers of second-level GO
categories within each first-level GO category (molecular
function, biological process, cellular component) for both
species. Using the hypergeometric test in R, we then tested
which GO categories were significantly over- or underrepresented in the fire ant cDNA library relative to the Drosophila
genome. Bonferroni correction was applied to the 80 tests
carried out to correct for multiple comparisons.

Identification of Hymenoptera-specific genes

information

All fire ant assembled sequences were compared against the
nr protein database via blastx. The 6,948 transcripts that did
not show strong similarity to the non-hymenopteran
sequences of the nr database (blastx using BLOSUM45; E > 1)
were subsequently aligned to the honey bee genome (build
Amel 4.0). Of these, 216 ant transcripts had strong similarity
to honey bee sequences (tblastx using BLOSUM45; E ≤ 1e-10).

R9.14 Genome Biology 2007,

Wang et al.

These 216 sequences were compared against all non-honey
bee sequences of the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
(release 88, September 2006). We retained the 148 ant transcripts that showed strong similarity to honey bee build 4.0 (E
≤ 1e-10) and no or very weak similarity (E > 1) to known nonhymenopteran sequences (tblastx using BLOSUM45). When
multiple tblastx alignment frames were possible, the positive
strand frame with the strongest E-value was retained. The
10,000 bp honey bee genomic region surrounding each antbee sequence pair was then compared against the nr protein
database via blastx. For 31 ant transcripts, the corresponding
honey bee genomic region either did not show similarity to
known genes, or only showed similarity to genes transcribed
in the opposite direction. InterProScan was used to scan for
protein signatures [55]. Additionally, the ant transcripts were
aligned via tblastx against build 2.0 of the honey bee genome,
which is currently the bee genome version with the most
extensive annotation. With these results a GFF annotation
file was generated and uploaded to BeeBase [56] for visual
examination of all ant transcript-honey bee genome homolog
pairs. Based on the existence and orientation of surrounding
predicted genes we then determined a confidence level for
each ant-bee pair. We assigned three stars when an ant transcript overlapped with a previously known bee gene (ab initio
prediction or EST evidence); two stars if there was no known
bee gene close by; one star if a gene from another organism
appeared to hit within 5,000 bp of the ant-bee pair. In addition, 8 ant-bee pairs considered as false positives were eliminated, leaving us with 23 candidate Hymenoptera-specific
genes. BeeBase was used to generate Additional data file 5
and a preliminary version of Figure 2, which was subsequently reformatted and modified to contain only relevant
data: redundant text was removed, non-empty tracks were
collapsed and empty tracks were deleted.

Microarray construction
Bacteria clones were inoculated into PCR plates containing 5
μl modified LB-ampicillin broth (0.2 × LB without NaCl) and
grown overnight. Plasmid inserts were amplified by PCR after
adding 95 μl of PCR mix. A single primer, SMART PCR
primer
5'-AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGT-3',
which
matches both the 3' and 5' SMART adaptor of the inserts, was
used. PCR mixes contained 0.4 μl 5 U/μl TAQ (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany), 10 μl 10 × Qiagen buffer, 20 μl Q solution,
4 μl 25 mM MgCl2, 1.5 μl 25 mM dNTPs, and 1 μl 100 μM
SMART PCR primer. An initial 9 minute denaturation at 94°C
was followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 59°C, and 3
minutes at 72°C. The reaction ended with an additional incubation of 7 minutes at 72°C. PCR products (2 μl of each) were
analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Gel pictures were visually examined to classify all PCR products as follows: 'strong single
band' (78.4%); 'no band' (3.9%); or 'weak or multiple bands'
(17.5%). These data were used to create an Excel file (Additional data file 8), which will allow microarray users to
exclude data from non-single-band spots. We preferred this

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/1/R9

solution to printing only single-band PCR products, as this
would have involved an error-prone rearraying step.
PCR products were purified by a standard NaOAc/ethanol
precipitation, resuspended in 30 μl water and transferred
into duplicate 384-well plates using a Biomek FX liquid-handling robot (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Then
PCR products were dried and resuspended in 20 μl 3 × SSC,
1.5 M betaine. This spotting buffer improves spot
homogeneity and signal-to-noise ratio [57]. We also resuspended 48 times 10 commercial exogenous controls (SpotReport Alien cDNA Array Validation System, Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA, USA) in 3 × SSC, 1.5 M betaine, 1 set for each subgrid of the microarray. Microarrays were printed on aldehydesilane-coated slides (NexterionTM Slide AL, Schott
Nexterion, Jena, Germany), using an OmniGrid 300 spotting
robot (GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA, USA). Spot and printing quality were assessed visually under a dissecting microscope after printing. While a few slides had minor defects (for
example, a few spots missing or damaged by dust particles),
the majority of slides exhibited no defects. DNA was
crosslinked to slides by baking at 80°C for 1 h. Afterwards, the
slides were post-processed with NaBH4 using the manufacturer's recommended protocol.

Clone tracking
To detect major mistakes (for example, inverted or rotated
plates) made during sequencing, amplification and/or transfer into 384-well plates, we resampled and sequenced 534
PCR products from the 384-well plates. These samples were
chosen so that they represented 2 to 4 samples of each 96-well
plate. For all 96-well plates we also manually checked that
PCR length patterns corresponded roughly to sequence
length patterns. Using these 2 quality control methods, we
identified 8 96-well plates that had been sequenced upsidedown. After careful verification involving more sequencing,
we corrected these mistakes by renaming the sequences correctly. At that point only 6 control sequences (1.1%) did not
match the expected sequence, suggesting that these were sporadic contaminations.

Availability of sequence data, cDNA clones and
microarrays
The ESTs described in this paper were submitted to the GenBank data library under accession numbers EE127747 to
EE149461. The assembled sequences can be downloaded
from the Fourmidable database [54]. The microarray data
were submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus [58] with accession number GSE5995. Fire ant cDNA clones and cDNA
microarrays can be obtained according to instructions on

sequences similar to fire ant assembled sequences with a nonhoney bee best hit. Additional data file 2 lists all fire ant
assembled transcripts with a significant blastn hit to the
honey bee genome and no other blastx or blastn hit. Additional data file 3 shows the GO annotations for all assembled
transcripts based on blastx searches. Additional data file 4
shows the GO annotations for all assembled transcripts based
on Prosite searches. Additional data file 5 shows the honey
bee genome regions surrounding the candidate
Hymenoptera-specific genes listed in Table 3. Additional data
file 6 contains fire ant assembled sequences similar to D. melanogaster genes with the GO term 'behavior'. Additional data
file 7 contains an annotated list of the most abundant transcripts. Additional data file 8 shows the PCR results for the
cDNA clones deposited onto the microarray. Additional data
file 9 shows which fire ant assembled sequences had at least
one cDNA clone with a good (single-band) PCR product.
Additional data file 10 gives details on the microarray analyses performed. Additional data file 11 lists the fire ant clones
that are differentially expressed between adults and brood
based on a 4-fold cutoff. Additional data file 12 lists the fire
ant clones that are differentially expressed between adults
and brood based on a t-test (p < 0.001).
