Abstract
This report describes the genetic characterization of 297 wild-type measles viruses that were
isolated in 24 provinces of China between 1995 and 2003. Phylogenetic analysis of the N gene
sequences showed that all of the isolates belonged to genotype H1 except 3 isolates, which were
genotype A. The nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid homologies of the 294-genotype
H1 strains were 94.7%–100% and 93.3%–100%, respectively. The genotype H1 isolates were
divided into 2 clusters, which differed by approximately 2.9% at the nucleotide level. Viruses from
both clusters were distributed throughout China with no apparent geographic restriction and
multiple co-circulating lineages were present in many provinces. Even though other measles
genotypes have been detected in countries that border China, this report shows that genotype H1
is widely distributed throughout the country and that China has a single, endemic genotype. This
important baseline data will help to monitor the progress of measles control in China.

Background
Measles virus (MV), an enveloped virus with a singlestranded, negative sense RNA genome, is a member of the
genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. MV
is highly contagious and causes a disease characterized by
high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis and appearance
of a maculopapular rash [1]. Despite widespread use of a
safe and effective vaccine, it is estimated that MV still
causes close to half a million deaths per year and is a
major cause of child mortality, mostly in developing
countries [2]. However, measles has been eliminated in
countries that have maintained high vaccine coverage
rates, and four of six WHO regions now have measles
elimination goals [3,4].
MV is a monotypic virus, but genetic variability exists
among wild type strains [5]. Molecular epidemiological
studies have provided an important tool for mapping
transmission routes, documenting the elimination of
endemic virus strains, and differentiating vaccine from
wild-type strains [6-9]. The protocols and nomenclature
for genetic characterization of wild-type measles viruses
have been standardized by the World Health Organization (WHO) [10]. The WHO currently recognizes 23 genotypes of MV [10-14] based on sequence analysis of the
450 nucleotides coding for the 150 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminus of the nucleoprotein (N) and the coding
region of the hemagglutinin (H) gene [10,11]. WHO recommends that genetic analysis of MV isolates should be
conducted during all phases of measles control [15].
China, which successfully eradicated wild-type poliomyelitis virus in 1994, now has established a goal for measles
elimination by 2012. One of the strategies to achieve
elimination includes strengthening measles surveillance.
An accelerated measles control program and surveillance
activities were initiated in China during 1997 and 1998,
respectively. To improve surveillance, a laboratory network was started in 2001, and is currently composed of
one national measles laboratory, 31 provincial measles

labs and 331 prefecture labs. Measles laboratory surveillance includes serologic confirmation of suspected measles cases and genetic characterization of wild-type
viruses.
Analysis of wild-type MV circulating in China during
1993–1995 and 1998–1999 led to the initial identification of a novel genotype, H1 [16,17]. Genotype H1
viruses were isolated in Hunan, Shandong, Hebei, Beijing,
Hainan, and Anhui Provinces and were linked to cases
detected in the USA in 1997 and 1998 [7]. Epidemiological data from the exported cases suggested that the H1
viruses have a very wide distribution in China including
Hong Kong and Guangzhou [7,17]. However, continued
sampling of measles virus strains from different locations
within China is needed for a more complete understanding of the distribution of genotypes. This report greatly
expands our knowledge of wild-type MVs in China. We
describe the genetic characterization of nearly 300 wildtype MVs circulating in China between 1995 and 2003.
Viral isolates were obtained from 24 of 31 provinces. The
results showed widespread distribution of genotype H1
viruses.

Results and Discussion
To support further progress in measles control the Ministry of Health of China issued a Plan for Accelerated Measles Control in 1998 and National Measles Surveillance
Plan in 2004. The current National Measles Surveillance
Plan divides the provinces into 2 groups based on average
annual measles incidence [18]. Provinces in Group A have
an average measles incidence <6/100,000 and a measles
elimination and outbreak prevention goal. Provinces in
Group B have an average measles incidence >6/100,000
and a measles control goal. Viral isolates were obtained
from 17/18 Group A provinces and 7/13 Group B provinces. The majority of the isolates (84%) were from the
Group A provinces because the laboratory network is not
as well established in the Group B provinces. Many of the
laboratories in Group B provinces lack the necessary

equipment and supplies to obtain samples for viral isolation. Table 1 lists the number of isolates obtained from
each province in China and the location of the provinces
is shown in Figure 1. During 1995–2003, the incidence of
measles in China was <8/100,000, with fewer than 250
measles deaths reported each year (Figure 2).
The sequences of the 450 nucleotides coding for the
COOH-terminus of the nucleoprotein were derived from
all of the 297 viral isolates listed in Table 1 and 191 representative sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis.
All of the isolates were placed in genotype H1 except 3 isolates, which were in genotype A (Figure 3, 4). The grouping of the sequences within the genotype H1 was
supported by bootstrap analysis (data not shown). The
ranges of nucleotide sequence and amino acid homolo-

gies among the 294 contemporary H1 isolates were
94.7%–100% and 93.3%–100%, respectively.
Three of the viral isolates, MVi/Henan.PRC/7.99/1, MVi/
Hunan.PRC/15.96/10,
MVi/Xinjiang.PRC/24.03/1,
belonged to genotype A and the N gene sequences of these
viruses were very closely related to the sequence of the vaccine strain used in China, Shanghai-191. Pairwise comparisons of 3 genotype A isolates to Shanghai-191 showed
no more than 1.1% nucleotide variation. When these
sequences were compared the prototype Edmonston
strain, the nucleotide variation was 1.8%–2%. These genotype A viruses also shared several nucleotide substitutions that are unique to the Shanghai-191 strain (Figure
5A) [19]. Fever and rash occur in approximately 5% of
measles vaccine recipients within 10–12 days after vacci-

nation [20]. Though immunization histories were not
available for these cases, the sequence information shows
that these isolates likely represent measles vaccine viruses.
While the phylogenetic analysis clearly showed that the
vast majority of the viral isolates were in genotype H1,
there were no other obvious patterns. Within this large
group of genotype H1 sequences, there was no evidence
for geographic or temporal restriction since identical
sequences were detected in multiple provinces at the same
time and identical sequences were sometimes detected
during different years in the same province. The sequence
data suggest the presence of sustained chains of transmission in most of provinces, even in some with high immunization coverage rates, such as Shandong and Henan
(Figure 5A, 5B). Sustained chains of transmission also
were found from 2001 to 2003 in Shanghai City, which
may have been due to the influx of a large number of
undocumented individuals (floating people).

The phylogenetic tree (Figures 3, 4) shows that the
sequences of the genotype H1 viruses from China from
1995–2003 form two major clusters. A third, intermediate
cluster, contains sequences of some of the initial
sequences reported from China [16] including the reference strain for genotype H1. However, only 1 contemporary sequence, from 2000, groups with this third cluster
suggesting that viruses in this lineage may no longer be
circulating in China. The amount of nucleotide variation
between the 2 large clusters is as high as 2.9%. Within all
of the 294 Chinese sequences, the nucleotide variation
was up to 5.3% for the 450-nucleotide sequence of the N
gene. Therefore, the intra-genotype sequence diversity for
genotype H1 is greater than that measured for some other
measles genotypes. However, viruses from both major
clusters were distributed throughout China without any
apparent geographic pattern (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Therefore there is no practical reason to separate the genotype H1 viruses into multiple genotypes, at this time,

because this would not enhance our ability to describe
transmission pathways in China. It is important to note
that the genetic heterogeneity of the Chinese measles
viruses is not a result of increased mutation rates but is
due to the presence of multiple, co-circulating lineages of
virus within an endemic genotype.
The initial genetic characterization of wild-type measles
viruses from China identified a new genotype H1, which
was detected only in China and cases exported to other
countries from China [16,21]. A number of genotypes
have been detected in the countries that have borders with
China including genotypes D4 and D8 in Nepal and
India, D4 in Pakistan, G2 in Thailand, H1 in Mongolia,
and H2 in Vietnam. However, there are no reports about
measles genotypes from the countries that are on China's
western borders, but virologic surveillance is improving in
these areas [14].
The results of this report greatly expand the scope of the
previous work to clearly demonstrate that genotype H1
has a widespread distribution throughout China. The H1
genotype was also detected in large outbreaks in both
Japan, and Korea in 2000–2001 [22,23]. Genotypes D3,
D5, and D9 were the most frequently detected genotypes
in Japan before the outbreaks associated with genotype
H1 suggesting that the recent H1 viruses in Japan originated in China. Baseline virologic surveillance had not
been conducted in Korea before the large outbreak of genotype H1 in 2000–2001.

Based on the virologic surveillance data, the transmission
pattern of genotype H1 viruses in China is consistent with
ongoing endemic transmission of multiple lineages of a
single, endemic genotype. This type of transmission pattern has also been described for other countries with
endemic transmission including Nigeria, Ghana, India,
Cambodia, Turkey, Vietnam [17,24-27]. In contrast, in
areas, such as the USA, Australia, Canada and the United
kingdom where endemic transmission of virus has been
interrupted, the number of measles cases is very low and
a variety of genotypes are detected, reflecting the multiple
sources of imported viruses [7,21,28-30]. Since WPRO,
including China, has recently initiated a program to eliminate measles by 2012, this report provides important
baseline virologic information for China. Hopefully, virologic surveillance in China will be able to document the
interruption of transmission of genotype H1 viruses and,
in conjunction with epidemiological surveillance, will
help to identify the sources of imported virus.

Conclusion
This study reports virologic surveillance data obtained in
China during a period when measles control activities
were greatly accelerated. The results confirmed that genotype H1 is the endemic genotype throughout China. The
virologic data were consistent with endemic measles in
that multiple chains of transmission were evident. The H1
viruses were very diverse and formed two major clusters,
which were distributed throughout China with no apparent geographic restriction. This important baseline data

will contribute to the development of improved measles
control programs in China.

Methods
Specimens collection and virus isolation
Throat swab and urine samples were obtained from serologically confirmed measles cases. Clinical specimens
were inoculated onto B95a cells [31], and the cells were
observed for cytopathic effect (CPE). Inoculated cells were
blind-passaged up to three times before being discarded.
Cells were harvested when the CPE was maximal. Virus
isolations were performed by 24 provincial laboratories in
China and the viral isolates were shipped to the National
Measles Laboratory, in Beijing for genetic analysis.
RNA Extraction and RT-PCR
Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell lysates using
Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's directions.

RNA pellets were dried and resuspended in 50 µl of sterile
distilled water and stored at -70 C until amplification by
RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed using previously
described methods [6,20]. Primers MV63 (5'CCT CGG
CCT CTC GCA CCT AGT 3') and MV60 primers (5'GCT
ATG CCA TGG GAG TAG GAG TGG 3') were used to
amplify a 676 bp fragment of the N gene including the
450 bp fragment recommended for genotyping.
Sequence analysis
The sequences of the PCR products were derived by automated sequencing with primers MV60 and MV63 and the
BigDye terminator v2.0 chemistry using reaction conditions that were recommended by the manufacturer (ABI
373, ABI 3100, Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems).
Sequence proof reading and editing was conducted with
Sequencer™ (Gene Codes Corporation). Sequence data
were analyzed by using version 7.0 of Bioedit and phyloPage 6 of 9

Phylogenetic tree of wild-type measles viruses isolated in Henan (panel A) and Shandong (panel B) provinces between 1995 and
2003. Recent viruses from Henan are shown in red and recent viruses from Shandong are shown in blue. The intermediate
cluster containing the reference sequence for genotype H1 and older strains is shown in black. Reference strains for genotypes
H2 and A are also shown.

genetic analyses were performed using Bioedit and Mega
ver3.1. The robustness of the groupings was assessed using
bootstrap resampling of 1000 replicates and the trees were
visualized with Mega programs. 191 representative nucleotide sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers DQ356683–DQ356873.
