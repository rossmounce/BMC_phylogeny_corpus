Abstract
Background: Green algae of the family Volvocaceae are a model lineage for studying the
molecular evolution of multicellularity and cellular differentiation. The volvocine alga Gonium is
intermediate in organizational complexity between its unicellular relative, Chlamydomonas, and its
multicellular relatives with differentiated cell types, such as Volvox. Gonium pectorale consists of ~16
biflagellate cells arranged in a flat plate. The detailed molecular analysis of any species necessitates
its accessibility to genetic manipulation, but, in volvocine algae, transformation procedures have so
far only been established for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri.
Results: Stable nuclear transformation of G. pectorale was achieved using a heterologous dominant
antibiotic resistance gene, the aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase VIII gene (aphVIII) of
Streptomyces rimosus, as a selectable marker. Heterologous 3'- and 5'-untranslated flanking
sequences, including promoters, were from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii or from Volvox carteri. After
particle gun bombardment of wild type Gonium cells with plasmid-coated gold particles,
transformants were recovered. The transformants were able to grow in the presence of the
antibiotic paromomycin and produced a detectable level of the AphVIII protein. The plasmids
integrated into the genome, and stable integration was verified after propagation for over 1400
colony generations. Co-transformants were recovered with a frequency of ~30–50% when cells
were co-bombarded with aphVIII-based selectable marker plasmids along with unselectable
plasmids containing heterologous genes. The transcription of the co-transformed, unselectable
genes was confirmed. After heterologous expression of the luciferase gene from the marine
copepod Gaussia princeps, which was previously engineered to match the codon usage in C.
reinhardtii, Gonium transformants show luciferase activity through light emission in bioluminescence
assays.
Conclusion: Flanking sequences that include promoters from C. reinhardtii and from V. carteri work
in G. pectorale and allow the functional expression of heterologous genes, such as the selectable
marker gene aphVIII of S. rimosus or the co-transformed, codon-optimized G. princeps luciferase
gene, which turned out to be a suitable reporter gene in Gonium. The availability of a method for
transformation of Gonium makes genetic engineering of this species possible and allows for detailed
studies in molecular evolution using the unicellular Chlamydomonas, the 16-celled Gonium, and the
multicellular Volvox.

Background
In most multicellular lineages, the branch points that lead
to multicellularity lie so deep in the past that molecular
details of this key step on the path to complex organisms
have been obscured by the passage of time. Fortunately,
there is an exception. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of
volvocine algae showed that the last common ancestor of
the unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Figure 1A) and
the multicellular Volvox carteri, with its differentiated cell
types (Figure 1B), lived only ~200 million years ago [1].
In addition, not only do both unicellular and multicellular forms with differentiated cell types exist within this
group, but also forms that are intermediate in organizational complexity between Chlamydomonas and Volvox,
such as Gonium (Figure 1C and 1D). A stepwise progression in organismal complexity can be arranged with these
and other species of this group, which shows an increase
in the number of cells, the degree to which cellular labor
is divided between cell types, and the amount of extracellular matrix (for review see [2]). Due to the properties discussed above, volvocine algae attract the interest of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/64

researchers who are studying the molecular evolution of
multicellularity and cellular differentiation.
The detailed molecular analysis of any species requires its
accessibility to genetic manipulation. Among the volvocine algae, transformation procedures have only been
established for C. reinhardtii [3-5] and V. carteri [6]. Similarly, other molecular tools, such as selectable markers
and reporter genes, are only available for C. reinhardtii and
V. carteri, and, moreover, only the genomes of these volvocine species have been sequenced (C. reinhardtii: [7], V.
carteri: DOE Joint Genome Institute/JGI, publication in
preparation). Unfortunately, no molecular tools and
hardly any nucleotide sequence data are available for genera that are intermediate in organizational complexity
between Chlamydomonas and Volvox. Because a molecular
analysis of species with intermediate organizational complexity is important for the understanding of molecular
evolution, we planned to establish a transformation technique in Gonium pectorale to allow for its genetic manipulation. This coenobial (colonial) volvocine green alga
builds a slightly convex plate, which typically contains 16
cells in a rather square or rhomboidal arrangement, with
four cells in the center and 12 cells in the periphery (Figure 1C) [8,9]. Consistent with its position near the base of
the volvocine family tree [10-16], Gonium exhibits a
number of developmental processes that also occur during the development of its larger and more complex relatives [17] but that are not part of the Chlamydomonas
developmental program.
An important precondition for genetic transformation is
the availability of an appropriate selectable, preferably
dominant, marker. Two such genes have been shown to
work in both V. carteri and C. reinhardtii, which are the ble
gene of Streptoalloteichus hindustanus, which mediates
resistance to zeocin, and the aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase VIII gene (aphVIII) of Streptomyces rimosus,
which confers resistance to paromomycin [18-21].

pectorale (strain SAG 12.85) colony in the stage of embryogenesis. Each of the 16 cells forms a 16-cell plakea in 4 longitudinal cell cleavages.

Both genes are dominant because they add new, selectable
features to transformants, and therefore do not require
strains with particular auxotrophic defects as recipients.
The Ble protein is a binding protein, which requires a 1:1
ratio of Ble and zeocin. In contrast, the enzyme aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase VIII achieves high-affinity
phosphorylation of paromomycin, and, as an enzyme, it
works at lower concentrations than a simple binding protein. Therefore, the aphVIII gene was determined to be
more appropriate for transformation.
The expression of foreign genes is mostly carried out by
using endogenous 5'-UTRs, including promoter
sequences, and endogenous 3'-UTRs [18-21]. If the
genome of a target species has been sequenced, appropri-

ate 5'- and 3'-sequences can be found with bioinformatic
tools and can be easily amplified by PCR. Unfortunately,
the genome of Gonium or other volvocine species, except
for C. reinhardtii and V. carteri, has not been sequenced.
Although there is limited sequence information from a
few coding sequences for these species, there is no
sequence information for the corresponding 5'- and 3'UTRs, and no information is available as to whether the
genes are strongly and constitutively expressed. Because
5'- and 3'-UTRs are weakly conserved even between
closely related species, sequence information from related
species is not appropriate to allow for amplification of
UTRs by standard PCR. In addition, cloning and sequencing of flanking sequences is time consuming. Thus, our
strategy was to test flanking sequences that were derived
from species closely related to Gonium. Previously, it has
been shown that flanking sequences from C. reinhardtii
could work in V. carteri and vice versa [22]. We decided to
utilize such flanking sequences in Gonium transformation
experiments with glass beads or with two different particle
guns.
In order to allow the application of efficient molecular
genetic approaches in G. pectorale, appropriate reporter
genes that can express functional proteins within this species are also required. The candidate reporter genes that
we tested included the arylsulfatase (ars) gene from V. carteri [23,24], the tagged heat shock protein 70A (hsp70A)
gene from V. carteri [25,26], and the luciferase (luc) gene
from G. princeps, which had been previously codon-optimized for expression in C. reinhardtii [27].
Here we report the stable nuclear transformation of G. pectorale by particle gun bombardment using the heterologous, dominant antibiotic resistance gene aphVIII of S.
rimosus fused to heterologous 3'- and 5'-untranslated
flanking sequences, including promoters, from C. reinhardtii and V. carteri. We also show that the heterologously expressed luciferase gene from G. princeps, which
was codon-optimized for C. reinhardtii, can serve as a suitable reporter gene in Gonium.

strains SAG 12.85, CCAP 32/14 and NIES-1710 was verified in a phylogenetic analysis using four DNA sequences
(psaA, psaB, rbcL and ITS 1/5.8S rRNA/ITS 2) [10-16]. Both
background and procedures of the phylogenetic analysis
are described in Additional File 1, alignments are shown
in Additional Files 2, 3, 4 and 5, calculations of sequence
identities are given in Additional Files 6 and 7, and phylogenetic trees are shown in Additional Files 8, 9, 10, 11
and 12.

Preliminary transformation studies using aphVIII-based
selectable marker plasmids
For transformation experiments with G. pectorale, the
aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase VIII gene (aphVIII)
of Streptomyces rimosus was used as a selectable marker. In
the plasmid pPmr3, the aphVIII gene is under the control
of a V. carteri hsp70A-rbcS3 hybrid promoter, and the 3'UTR is derived from the V. carteri rbcS3 gene [21] (Figure
2A). In plasmid paphG the aphVIII gene is under control
of a C. reinhardtii hsp70A-rbcS2 hybrid promoter, and the
3'-UTR is derived from the C. reinhardtii rbcS2 gene [22]
(Figure 2B). This DNA construct also contains intron 1 of
the rbcS2 gene 42 bp upstream of the translation start
codon. The plasmid paphG includes not just one copy of
this hybrid aphVIII gene construct but 16 repeated aphVIII
cassettes, this resulting in a higher gene dosage [22].

We attempted to transform G. pectorale (SAG 12.85) by
using both plasmids and the glass bead-mediated transformation protocol (untreated or pretreated with proteases to reduce cell wall material) [28] and protocols
using a homemade particle gun [6]. After this treatment
and a 48-h recovery period, cells were spread on agar
plates with paromomycin, but no transformants were
obtained. However, we realized in control experiments
that we were not even able to grow the wild type cells on
agar plates without paromomycin if only a few viable cells
were spread per plate. Therefore, in all the following
experiments, selection for paromomycin-resistance was
performed in liquid medium.
In parallel to the aphVIII-based selectable marker plasmids, a promoterless aphVIII construct was tested, since a
similar promoter-trapping attempt had worked in
Chlamydomonas [20,29]. Using the particle gun and the
promoterless aphVIII, a single paromomycin-resistant
transformant was obtained (data not shown). This transformant was retained and was stable, and its paromomycin-resistance has persisted over three years.
Unfortunately, about ten attempts to reproduce this result
have failed.
Recovery of transformants after biolistic transformation
After these unsuccessful attempts, a biolistic method for
transformation, which was modified from previous protocols [4,6], in combination with the aphVIII-based plasmids pPmr3 and paphG and selection in liquid medium,
made the reproducible recovery of G. pectorale transformants possible. Optimization of the transformation protocol was done by changing several parameters
systematically (Table 1). In the most successful protocol,
gold microprojectiles (0.6 μm in diameter) were coated
with plasmid DNA by a modified ethanol precipitation in
the presence of CaCl2 and spermidine (see Methods). Logarithmically growing G. pectorale cells (strain SAG 12.85)

were spread on a cellulose acetate membrane filter, with
all liquid removed, and a PDS-1000/He biolistic device
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used to introduce the plasmid-coated microprojectiles into the cells by high-velocity
bombardment. An overview of the most successful combination of transformation parameters is provided in Table
2. After microprojectile bombardment, cells were distributed evenly among 10 flasks (Figure 3A) and incubated
for 48 h under standard conditions without selective pressure. After the addition of 1 μg paromomycin/ml, the cultures clarified within 24 h due to the death of most cells.
Re-greening of culture flasks within 9–16 days of further
incubation indicated the presence of antibiotic-resistant
transformants (Figure 3B). Due to the cultivation in liquid
medium, we could not easily determine whether the
transformed organisms were descendants of a single transformant or of more than one transformant. Thus, we
assumed a yield of only one transformant per flask, even
if there could be more than one. Based on this assumption, the transformation efficiency was estimated to be
~6.6 × 10-7 and ~1.1 × 10-7 when the plasmids pPmr3 and
paphG were used as selectable marker plasmids, respectively. Similar transformation efficiencies were achieved
when we repeated the experiments on different wild type
strains (NIES-1710 and CCAP 32/14).

that kills all wild type cells. Transformants that were produced using pPmr3 tolerated 0.75 – 2.0 μg paromomycin/
ml (Figure 3D1), which was 15 – 40 times higher than the
concentration that kills all wild type cells. Similar results
were obtained when pPmr3 was co-transformed with the
non-selectable plasmids described below (Figure 3D2).

For detailed analyses, the transformants were re-isolated
to ensure uniform genetic conditions (see Methods).

In addition, genomic DNA from transformants and from
the parent wild type strain was analyzed on Southern
blots for the presence of the aphVIII sequence. Sequences
hybridizing to a 282 bp fragment from the coding region
of the aphVIII gene were detectable in transformants, but
not in the parent strain. A Southern blot of genomic DNA
from T-J37, which is a transformant that was produced
with plasmid pPmr3, and of genomic DNA from the parent wild type strain SAG 12.85 is shown in Figure 4D. The
total size of plasmid pPmr3 is 5.1 kb, which includes the
pBluescript II vector backbone [21]. Based on the
sequence of pPmr3 (see GenBank: AY429514) and the
position of the probe (Figure 2A), a signal from a 0.37 kb
fragment was expected in the SalI/PstI digest, if pPmr3
integrated into the genome by recombination outside the

Paromomycin resistance of transformants
As a reference, wild type G. pectorale cultures (strain SAG
12.85) were examined for their sensitivity towards paromomycin. A very low concentration of 0.05 μg paromomycin/ml was able to kill all wild type cells (Figure 3C).
Transformants were tested at antibiotic concentrations
from 0.25 to 10 μg/ml, so that the lowest antibiotic concentration was five times higher than the deadly dose for
wild type cells. Gonium transformants that were generated
using the selectable marker plasmid paphG were able to
tolerate 0.75 – 1.0 μg paromomycin/ml (Figure 3D1),
which was 15 – 20 times higher than the concentration

Stable integration of plasmid DNA into the genome of
transformants
To verify the integration of plasmid DNA into the
genome, genomic DNA of strains transformed with
paphG or pPmr3 was isolated, and the wild type Gonium
strain SAG 12.85 was used as a control. Using these different genomic DNA isolates as templates, PCR amplification of a fragment of the aphVIII gene confirmed
transformation. The relative positions of the amplified
DNA fragments are indicated in Figure 2A and 2B. Based
on the known sequence, the size of the PCR fragment was
predicted to be 422 bp. Paromomycin-resistant transformants, which were generated either with paphG (Figure 4A) or pPmr3 (Figure 4B), yielded a PCR fragment of
the expected size, whereas the wild type strain gave no
such fragment, as expected. Sequence analysis demonstrated that all the amplified fragments were identical to
the sequence of the aphVIII fragment (Figure 4C).

coding region. Such a fragment was identified in T-J37
DNA, and no such fragment, or any other fragment, was
detectable in the parent wild type strain. In T-J37, a 0.54
kb fragment was detected in the SalI/HindIII digest, as
expected from the plasmid sequence, and this shows that
the sequences ~0.3 kb upstream and ~0.2 kb downstream
of the stop codon were integrated as they appear in the
plasmid pPmr3. The SalI/HindIII-lane also contained a
weak 1.2 kb band; this is a known HindIII – HindIII fragment (Figure 2A), which arises from incomplete SalIdigestion in the SalI/HindIII double digest. This 1.2 kb
fragment contained the complete aphVIII coding region,
which included ~0.2 kb upstream of the start codon and
~0.2 kb downstream of the stop codon. In addition to
these three genomic fragments that were arranged as predicted from the original plasmid pPmr3, a 6.4 kb SalIfragment was detected. Plasmid pPmr3 contains only a
single SalI-site ~0.4 kb upstream of the stop codon. The
second SalI-site of the 6.4 kb fragment must, therefore, be
located within the genomic sequence that flanked the
integrated plasmid. In addition to the pPmr3-transformants, the aphVIII gene was detected on Southern blots with
genomic DNA from transformants that were produced
with plasmid paphG (data not shown).
In Southern blot results from nine independent transformants, six of them were judged to have a single copy of
the plasmid in the genome. The other three seemed to
have two or three copies as well as DNA fragments of sizes
that were not explainable. Therefore, integration into the
genome might have been more complicated in these
transformants. The Southern blot results suggest that frequently only one copy of the plasmid integrates into the
genome.

Detection of AphVIII protein in transformants
Based on the amino acid sequence, which was deduced
from the cDNA sequence, an AphVIII protein of 30.97
kDa was predicted. In western blot analysis, an anti-AphVIII antibody detected a ~31 kDa band in strains that were
transformed with aphVIII-based selectable marker plasmids (Figure 4E). As expected, no AphVIII protein was
detectable in the parent wild type Gonium strain SAG
12.85.
Stable co-transformation of unselectable genes
The usefulness of a transformation system also depends
on the convenience with which co-transformations with
unselectable genes can be achieved, as most genes of interest do not allow for direct selection. Construction of transformation vectors is more laborious and time-consuming
if both the selectable and the unselectable gene must be
inserted into a single plasmid, particularly when the genes
are quite large. Therefore, co-transformation using two
separate plasmids is preferable, if possible. To test this,

wild type G. pectorale organisms (strain SAG 12.85) were
co-bombarded using plasmid pPmr3 (Figure 2A), which
contains the aphVIII gene for selection, and the following
four unselectable plasmids: 1) plasmid ptubar4 (Figure
2C), in which the arylsulfatase (ars) gene from V. carteri is
under control of the β2-tubulin promoter from V. carteri
[23,24,30]; 2) plasmid pHsp-HA (Figure 2D), in which
the tagged V. carteri heat shock protein 70A (hsp70A) gene
is under control of its own promoter [25]; 3) plasmid
pPsaD-GLuc (Figure 2E), in which the luciferase (luc) gene
from G. princeps is under control of the psaD promoter
from C. reinhardtii and in which the luc gene was codonoptimized for expression in C. reinhardtii [27]; and 4)
plasmid pHsp70A-GLuc (Figure 2F), in which the luciferase (luc) gene from G. princeps, which is again codonoptimized for C. reinhardtii, is fused to the first three exons
of the hsp70B gene of C. reinhardtii and in which this
hybrid gene is under control of the hsp70A promoter from
C. reinhardtii [27]. Paromomycin-resistant transformants
were obtained from all the co-bombardments, and, in all
transformants, the presence of the aphVIII gene was verified by genomic PCR. The co-bombarded plasmid was
detectable in ~30–50% of the paromomycin-resistant
transformants regardless of which co-bombarded plasmid
was used. The results of representative PCRs using
genomic template DNA of different paromomycin-resistant transformants co-bombarded with the selectable plasmid pPmr3 and the non-selectable plasmids ptubar4,
pHsp-HA, pPsaD-GLuc, or pHsp70A-GLuc are shown in
Figure 5. The primers are specific for each of the co-bombarded genes. The relative positions of the amplified DNA
fragments are indicated in Figure 2C, D, E, and 2F, respectively. In each co-transformation experiment, fragments
of the expected sizes of 212 bp (Figure 5A1), 479 bp (Figure 5B1), 343 bp (Figure 5C1), and 343 bp (Figure 5C2)
were amplified from some of the paromomycin-resistant
transformants (Figure 5). The sequence of the amplified
fragments with the correct size was confirmed by
sequence analysis in each of the four co-transformation
experiments, and all amplified fragments showed the correct sequence (Figure 5A2, B2, and 5C3).
Transcription of co-transformed, unselectable genes
The RT-PCR technique was used to verify the existence of
heterologous transcripts in Gonium transformants. Oligonucleotide primers were selected, and the following
cDNA-fragments were predicted: a 265 bp ars fragment
from ptubar4 co-transformants, a 374 bp hsp70A fragment from pHsp-HA co-transformants, and a 343 bp luc
fragment from both pPsaD-GLuc and pHsp70A-GLuc cotransformants. The relative positions of these cDNA fragments are indicated in Figure 2C, D, E, and 2F, respectively.

All RT-PCRs with the co-transformants yielded cDNA fragments with the expected sizes, and DNA sequence analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/64

demonstrated the correctness of the sequences (Figure 6).
If introns were present at the corresponding position of a
gene, the intron sequences were spliced correctly.
The RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that the promoters of the Volvox β2-tubulin and hsp70A genes and of the
Chlamydomonas psaD and hsp70A genes mediate transcription of co-transformed, heterologous genes in Gonium.
Analysis of heterologous protein expression in cotransformants
Transformants that were generated through co-transformation with the ars plasmid ptubar4 were analyzed for
arylsulfatase activity. The transformants were grown in
sulfur-sufficient medium because endogenous ars genes
are induced by sulfur deficiency. Under these conditions,
we were not able to detect any arylsulfatase activity in
transformants (data not shown). Likewise, we were not
able to detect the HA-tagged Hsp70A protein in transformants that were co-transformed with plasmid pHspHA, since there was no detectable signal in western blots
using anti-HA antibodies (data not shown).

Transformants that were generated through co-transformation with plasmid pPsaD-GLuc were analyzed for luciferase activity. In the light microscope, all transformants
show a wild type phenotype (Figure 7A) without any
detectable morphological differences in comparison to
the parent strain SAG 12.85 (Figure 1C), but when the
coelenterazine substrate is added to the lysates of these
transformants, a glow is visible to the naked eye in the
darkroom (Figure 7B). Exposure to a light-sensitive film
allows a simple qualitative analysis of chemiluminescence
(Figure 7B).
Genomic DNA from these transformants was analyzed on
Southern blots to estimate the number of copies that integrated into the genome. Using the aphVIII probe (Figure
2A), we looked for fragments that originate from integration of plasmid pPmr3 into the genome, and we obtained
fragments of the expected sizes (Figure 2A, 0.37 kb, 0.54
kb, and 1.2 kb) in transformants, but not in the parent
wild-type strain (Figure 7C), as described above. The cotransformed plasmid pPsaD-GLuc, which contains the
luciferase gene, has a total size of 5.0 kb that includes the
pBluescript II vector backbone [27]. The luc probe (Figure
2E) also detected fragments of the expected sizes (Figure
2E, 1.4 kb SacI fragment, 1.5 kb BamHI fragment) in transformants, whereas no fragments were detectable in the
parent wild-type strain (Figure 7D). We were not able to
assign the other fragment sizes observed in transformants
due to the unknown flanking sequences. However, the relatively low number of bands in each restriction digest of
genomic DNA from the two transformants that are shown
in Figure 7D and from four other transformants that were
analyzed, suggests that there are only ~1–3 integrations of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/64

the co-transformed plasmid, so a high gene dosage
through a large number of integrations can be excluded.
Transformants that were generated through co-transformation with plasmid pHsp70A-GLuc were also analyzed
qualitatively for luciferase activity, and several of these
transformants showed chemiluminescence (data not
shown).
To obtain quantitative expression data of the co-transformed luc gene, we analyzed the bioluminescence of
pPsaD-GLuc-derived transformants using a luminometer
(Figure 8A); in pPsaD-GLuc, the luc gene is under control
of the psaD promoter from C. reinhardtii. These transformants descend from the G. pectorale wild type strain SAG
12.85. For comparison, we also generated pPsaD-GLucderived transformants using a different parent G. pectorale
wild type strain, CCAP 32/14. The amount of light emission was extremely different in the transformants from
both parent strains. Several re-examinations showed that
these differences are permanent (Figure 8A and 8B). It is
known from many other species that expression of transgenes is strongly influenced by the unpredictable effects of
elements at the site of chromosomal integration [31]. For
unknown reasons, most of the SAG 12.85-derived transformants showed significantly higher luciferase expression rates than the CCAP 32/14-derived transformants
(Figure 8A and 8B).

Demonstration of co-transformation of heterologous genes
Demonstration of co-transformation of heterologous
genes by genomic PCR. PCRs were done using genomic
template DNA of paromomycin-resistant transformants cobombarded with the non-selectable plasmids ptubar4 (A1),
pHsp-HA (B1), pPsaD-GLuc (C1), or pHsp70A-GLuc (C2).
Primers were specific for the co-bombarded genes. Cotransformants were expected to yield gene fragments of the
V. carteri arylsulfatase (ars) (212 bp, A1), the V. carteri hsp70A
(479 bp, B1), or the Gaussia luciferase (luc) (343 bp, C1 and
C2). Sequences obtained from cloned fragments are shown
in A2 (ars, ptubar4 co-transformants), B2 (hsp70A, pHspHA co-transformants), and C3 (luc, pPsaD-GLuc and
pHsp70A-GLuc co-transformants). (A1, B1, C1, C2) The
parent wild type strain was analyzed as a control; lane M,

Because the promoter of hsp70A is heat-shock inducible in
C. reinhardtii, we wanted to analyze pHsp70A-GLucderived G. pectorale transformants by measuring luciferase
activities in heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked organisms. Transgene expression was induced by shifting the
temperature of the culture from 23 to 36°C for 1 h. After
a 1 h recovery phase at 23°C, luciferase activity was
assayed at 20°C and the induction factors were calculated
by comparison with non-heat-shocked samples. For comparison, induction factors were also calculated from
pPsaD-GLuc-derived transformants, in which the luciferase gene is driven by the psaD promoter. The analyses
show that heat shock induces luciferase expression to a
much greater extent in those transformants in which the
luciferase gene is driven by the hsp70A heat-shock promoter than it does in those in which the gene is driven by
the psaD promoter (Figure 8C). Thus, the C. reinhardtii
hsp70A heat-shock promoter is also inducible when utilized in G. pectorale.
Long term stability of DNA integration and gene
expression
For a variety of functional analyses, it is advantageous to
have stable transformants that express the corresponding
transgene for as long as possible. Forty independent
Gonium transformants were propagated in medium that

contained the antibiotic paromomycin (1 μg/ml) for two
years (or longer), which corresponds to over 1400 colony
generations. During this period, none of the transformant
clones was lost. After this period, PCR using genomic
DNA of these transformants as a template still yielded the
expected 422 bp fragment of the aphVIII gene (data not
shown).
In a parallel experiment, 25 independent transformants
were kept in medium containing the antibiotic paromomycin (1 μg/ml) for ~200 colony generations, then propagated for ~200 colony generations in antibiotic-free
medium without selective pressure, and finally cultivated
again in medium containing paromomycin (1 μg/ml) for
~200 colony generations. Just as in the experiment under
permanent selective pressure, all transformant clones survived this procedure, and the aphVIII gene was still detectable by genomic PCR.
The long term stability of co-transformed genes in 20 luciferase expressing transformants was also examined. Five
months, or ~300 colony generations, after transformation
with the selectable marker plasmid pPmr3 and plasmids
pHsp70A-GLuc (10 co-transformants) or pPsaD-GLuc (10
co-transformants), the luc gene was still detectable by PCR
in all the initially identified co-transformants. In addition,
bioluminescence assays showed that luciferase activity
was unchanged after this period.

Discussion
Using the aphVIII gene of S. rimosus and a hybrid hsp70A/
rbcS promoter along with an rbcS 3'-UTR from either C.
reinhardtii or V. carteri, we have demonstrated that wild
type G. pectorale strains can be transformed into paromomycin-resistant strains by particle gun bombardment.
Since there was no information with regard to activity
from any homologous Gonium promoter, we used heterologous promoters and were able to show their activity in
G. pectorale. Although the frequency of transformation
was low, the transformation process was reproducible. In
addition, co-transformants were recovered with a high frequency, and transformants were stable for hundreds of
colony generations under selective and nonselective conditions. Therefore, nuclear transformation of G. pectorale
using hybrid, heterologous genes as selectable markers is
feasible.
In Gonium, the frequency of transformation was estimated
to be ~6.6 × 10-7 or ~1.1 × 10-7 per cell in particle bombardment experiments, depending on the plasmid used.
In the related multicellular species V. carteri the mean frequency of stable transformants among the survivors of the
particle bombardment was 2.5 × 10-5 [6]. However, the
frequency presumably would have been much lower if the
calculation would have been per bombarded reproductive
cell. In the unicellular relative C. reinhardtii, a transforma-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/64

tion rate of 1.3 – 1.9 × 10-7 per recipient cell was calculated
when cell wall-deficient cells were treated using a glass
bead transformation protocol [29]. In Gonium, the estimated efficiency of transformation was based on two
assumptions, which were that all the cells that were used
in a transformation experiment were bombarded by
microprojectiles and that only a maximum of one transformant arose per cultivation flask. In reality, only a fraction of the cells are hit by a microprojectile. Most cells lie
outside the target zone, many cells are covered by other
cells, others are not hit even though they are within the
target zone, and quite a few cells get lost during handling.
In addition, it is very likely that more than one transformant occasionally arose per flask, but we counted and propagated only one transformant if a population of cells grew
in a culture flask after particle bombardment under selective pressure. Due to these reasons, the efficiency of transformation, which is considered to be the number of
independently transformed cells per total number of
treated wild type cells, is probably higher than the estimated number given above, but it is not possible to determine the exact number of treated cells if a particle gun is
used for transformation. The efficiency of transformation
should not be a limiting factor for researchers because
Gonium is a tiny organism that grows to high densities,
and the cultivation of millions of colonies requires minimal expenses.
The cause of the better yields of Gonium transformation
with the plasmid pPmr3 with its flanking sequences from
V. carteri when compared with the plasmid paphG with its
flanking sequences from C. reinhardtii and its 16 repeated
cassettes remains unclear. Possible reasons might be that
the Volvox-derived hybrid promoter in pPmr3 is more similar to Gonium promoters than the Chlamydomonas-derived
hybrid promoter in paphG or that the uptake and integration of the 31.4 kb plasmid paphG were not as efficient as
that of the 5.1 kb plasmid pPmr3.
For practical uses, the co-transformation rate is of special
interest because it is more convenient to combine a
known selectable marker plasmid and an unselectable
plasmid containing the gene of interest, instead of constructing a single, large plasmid with unselectable and
selectable genes. In Gonium, the co-transformation frequency was estimated to be ~30–50%, which means that
~3–5 co-transformants can be recovered from a single
bombardment session of the type described in the Methods section. In V. carteri, frequencies of 10–60% [19] and
40–80% [6] were reported for two different transformation systems. In C. reinhardtii, frequencies of ~50% [32] or
up to 80% [33] were achieved. These data show that cotransformation frequencies are quite high in Gonium and
other volvocine algae, and, thus, co-transformation can be
used routinely in these species.

control of the hsp70A heat shock promoter. Transformants were subject to a temperature shift from 23 to 36°C for 1 h. After
a 1 h recovery phase at 23°C, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was assayed. As a reference, non-heat-shocked transformants were analyzed in the same way.

We also show that the co-transformed genes were integrated into the genome and that they were also transcribed. We were not able to show protein function or
protein expression in transformants that were generated
using the plasmids ptubar4 and pHsp-HA, which should
have made arylsulfatase and the tagged heat shock protein
70A, respectively. Possible reasons why the arylsulfatase
or hsp70A genes fail to produce a detectable amount of
(functional) protein are: 1) there are codons within these
genes that are rarely or not used in Gonium; 2) the heterologous proteins are improperly folded, which leads not
only to a lack of activity but also to quick protein degradation; 3) Gonium detects expression-limiting regulatory elements in the heterologous coding sequences [34]; 4) at
least one intron/exon boundary within these heterologous genes is not easily recognized in the Gonium nucleus,
which leads to a frameshift and a wrong/truncated
polypeptide chain that is quickly degraded; 5) Gonium recognizes an additional intron/exon boundary in these heterologous genes, which also leads to a wrong/truncated
polypeptide chain that is quickly degraded; 6) the arylsulfatase needs a posttranslational modification for activity
[35], which is not added in Gonium.
However, transformants that were generated using the
plasmids pPsaD-GLuc and pHsp70A-GLuc showed functional expression of luciferase through light emission,
which is easily detected in bioluminescence assays. Therefore, the heterologous luciferase gene is a suitable reporter
gene in Gonium.

Conclusion
The availability of a transformation system that is based
on a dominant selectable marker now makes extensive
genetic engineering of Gonium possible. The strategy to
use a bacterial antibiotic resistance gene and flanking
sequences from close relatives might also be of interest for
those researchers seeking to transform species without
sequenced genomes but with sequenced relatives. The
existence of a transformation system for Gonium also
allows for more detailed studies of the molecular evolution of genes that regulate cellular differentiation, morphogenesis, and extracellular matrix biogenesis. This can
be done by manipulating and comparing volvocine species with increasing organismal complexity, such as
Chlamydomonas, Gonium, and Volvox, via expression of
homologous, heterologous, artificial, chimeric (GFPtagged), or otherwise modified genes.

Methods
Strains and culture conditions
The wild type Gonium pectorale Müller strains SAG 12.85,
NIES-1710, and CCAP 32/14 were obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Göttingen
(SAG), Germany [36], the Microbial Culture Collection at
the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/64

(Tsukuba, Japan) and the Culture Centre of Algae and
Protozoa (CCAP) (Ambleside, Scotland), respectively.
Cultures were grown in Jaworski's Medium (JM) [37] at
23°C or 29°C in an 8 h dark/16 h light (~10,000 lux)
cycle. Cultures were grown in 10 ml glass tubes with caps
that allow for gas exchange or in 50 ml and 300 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, which were aerated via Pasteur pipettes with
40 cm3 and 55 cm3 sterile air/min, respectively. Transgenic
strains that express the aphVIII gene were grown in JM in
the presence of 1 μg paromomycin/ml (paromomycin sulfate, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
Transformation vectors
The plasmid pPmr3 contains the 0.8 kb S. rimosus aphVIII
gene, which confers resistance to paromomycin, a V. carteri hsp70A-rbcS3 hybrid promoter (0.5 kb and 0.27 kb of
upstream sequences), and a 3'-UTR from the V. carteri
rbcS3 gene (0.53 kb of downstream sequence), and the
total size of plasmid pPmr3 is 5.1 kb, which includes the
pBluescript II vector backbone [21]. The plasmid paphG
contains the 0.8 kb S. rimosus aphVIII gene, a C. reinhardtii
hsp70A-rbcS2 hybrid promoter (0.26 kb and 0.22 kb of
upstream sequences), intron 1 (0.15 kb) of the C. reinhardtii rbcS2 gene 42 bp upstream of the translation start
codon, and a 3'-UTR of the C. reinhardtii rbcS2 gene (0.22
kb of downstream sequence), and the plasmid paphG
contains sixteen repeats of this hybrid gene in the same
orientation, which results in a 28.4 kb insert. The total size
of plasmid paphG is 31.4 kb, which includes the pBluescript II vector backbone [22]. The plasmid ptubar4 contains the 7.8 kb V. carteri arylsulfatase (ars) gene, a V.
carteri β2-tubulin promoter (0.5 kb of upstream
sequence), and a V. carteri arylsulfatase 3'-UTR (2.3 kb of
downstream sequence), and the total size of plasmid
ptubar4 is 13.2 kb, which includes the pUC18 vector
backbone [30]. The plasmid pHsp-HA contains the 3.2 kb
V. carteri hsp70A gene with its own promoter (2.5 kb of
upstream sequence) and its own 3'-UTR (0.75 kb of
downstream sequence), and the coding sequence is tagged
with a sequence coding for the HA-epitope. The total size
of plasmid pHsp-HA is 9.4 kb, which includes the pBluescript II vector backbone [25]. The plasmid pPsaD-GLuc
contains the 0.57 kb luciferase (luc) gene from G. princeps,
which was engineered to match the codon usage in C.
reinhardtii, a C. reinhardtii psaD promoter (0.8 kb of
upstream sequence), and a C. reinhardtii psaD 3'-UTR
(0.55 kb of downstream sequence). The total size of plasmid pPsaD-GLuc is 5.0 kb, which includes the pBluescript
II vector backbone [27]. The plasmid pHsp70A-GLuc contains the 0.57 kb luciferase (luc) gene from G. princeps
(codon-optimized for C. reinhardtii) fused to a 0.8 kb
DNA fragment that contains the first three exons of the
hsp70B gene of C. reinhardtii, and the hybrid gene is driven
by the C. reinhardtii hsp70A promoter (0.26 kb of
upstream sequence) and the 3'-UTR comes from the C.
reinhardtii rbcS2 gene (0.22 kb of downstream sequence).

BMC Biotechnology 2009, 9:64

The total size of plasmid pHsp70A-GLuc is 4.9 kb, which
includes the pBluescript II vector backbone [27].
Preparation of plasmid DNA
Plasmid DNA was purified routinely using the E.Z.N.A.®
Plasmid Mini Kit II (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). Large
plasmids (paphG) were purified from 50–100 ml E. coli
cultures as described [38], but the anion exchange column
step was omitted. The obtained plasmid DNA was further
purified using the E.Z.N.A.® Cycle Pure Kit (Peqlab).
Coating of microprojectiles
For particle gun transformation (most successful combination of parameters as provided in Table 2), gold microprojectiles of 0.6 μm in diameter (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
were coated with the required plasmids. To that end, ~3
mg gold microprojectiles in 50 μl H2O were quickly mixed
with 5 μg DNA of the circular selectable marker plasmid
(concentration > 0.4 μg/μl), 5 μg DNA of the circular cobombarded plasmid (if applicable), 50 μl 2.5 M CaCl2,
and 20 μl 0.1 M spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich). Mixing was
sustained for 30 min at 4°C. After the addition of 200 μl
EtOH at room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged for 2–3 s at ~5000 g. The pellet was washed three
times with 100 μl EtOH (at -20°C) and centrifuged for 2–
3 s at ~5000 g. Finally, the DNA-coated particles were
resuspended in 60 μl EtOH and kept at 4°C for use within
3 h.
Determination of cell concentration
In G. pectorale the number of cells per colony varies. Therefore, we refer to "cells/ml" rather than "colonies/ml". Cell
concentration was determined using a hemacytometer
with Neubauer ruling.
Stable nuclear transformation by particle gun
One hundred fifty milliliters of a logarithmically growing
G. pectorale culture that contained ~6 × 104 cells/ml was
harvested by centrifugation (800 g, 8 min, swing-out
rotor) and resuspended in a total volume of 12 ml JM.
Two milliliters of the suspension was spread evenly on a
cellulose acetate membrane filter with a pore size of 1.2
μm and a diameter of 47 mm (Whatman, London, UK),
and the filter was placed on top of a stack of absorbent
paper that soaked up all the excess liquid. Stable transformation of Gonium (most successful combination of
parameters as provided in Table 2) was performed using a
Biolistic® PDS-1000/He (Bio-Rad) particle gun. One-sixth
of the DNA-coated microprojectiles were spread on a macrocarrier (Bio-Rad), which was placed in a macrocarrier
holder (Bio-Rad). The distance between macrocarrier and
stopping screen (Bio-Rad) was set to 8 mm. The helium
pressure was defined by rupture disks with a burst pressure of 1100 psi (Bio-Rad). The gap between rupture disk
and macrocarrier was adjusted to 7 mm. The membrane
filter with its layer of G. pectorale was positioned in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/64

bombardment chamber, the distance between the stopping screen and target cells was adjusted to 6 cm, and the
chamber was partly evacuated to 27 inch Hg. After particle
bombardment, the colonies were washed off from the
membrane filter with JM. The procedure was repeated five
times, and the colonies from the six bombardments were
pooled and evenly distributed among ten 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks that contained a final volume of ~35 ml JM
each. Bombarded colonies were incubated under standard
conditions for 48 h, and then 1 μg paromomycin/ml was
added. Within 24 h, non-transformed cells died, which
resulted in a clarification of the medium. After another 9–
16 days of incubation in the presence of the antibiotic,
greening of a flask showed the initial presence of at least
one paromomycin-resistant cell that led to a population
of transformants. No more than one transformant per
flask was computed.
Re-isolation of transformants
For detailed analyses, transformants were re-isolated to
ensure uniform genetic condition. For this, a serial dilution of an exponentially growing Gonium culture was performed in a Terasaki plate (Nunc™ MicroWell™ MiniTrays;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Langenselbold, Germany),
which was filled with 10 μl JM medium per well. Under
microscopic control, a single Gonium colony was finally
transferred into a standard glass tube with JM medium
containing 1 μg paromomycin/ml and incubated under
standard conditions.
Paromomycin-resistance assay
Transformants or wild type strains were transferred into
glass tubes with increasing concentrations of paromomycin in JM. At the beginning of the assay, each tube contained ~12,000 healthy cells in a total volume of 10 ml.
Incubation under standard conditions continued for eight
days. Subsequently, the tubes were analyzed for either viable, green cells/colonies or cell lysis with some white
remains of dead cells/colonies.
Primer design
Oligonucleotide primers were designed using the primer
analysis software Oligo 6 (Molecular Biology Insights,
Cascade, CO), DNASIS™ (version 7.00; Hitachi Software
Engineering, San Francisco, CA), and Primer Express®
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Isolation of genomic DNA
Thirty-five milliliters of a logarithmically growing culture
was harvested by centrifugation (3500 g, 10 min). The
pellet, which had a wet weight of ~80 mg, was washed
twice with H2O, centrifuged 2×, resuspended in H2O, and
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were pulverized
in a mortar. After homogenization, the sample was
warmed to 65°C, and lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) that contained RNase A1 was added. Genomic

DNA was isolated using the spin columns of the DNeasy®
Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Larger amounts of genomic DNA were prepared by conventional methods [39], using tris-saturated phenol
(Roti®-phenol; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany).
Genomic PCR
Genomic PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl,
which contained ~100 ng of genomic DNA, 300 nM of
each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP mix, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.6
units of Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix in 1× Expand
High Fidelity buffer (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). PCR was performed on a T3 Thermocycler PCR
system (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) using the following conditions: 40 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 55°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 45 s and a final extension was at 72°C for
10 min. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced.
Southern blotting
After restriction enzyme digest, genomic DNA fragments
were separated on 1% agarose gels, vacuum transferred to
nylon membranes (Hybond-N®; Amersham Biosciences,
Little Chalfont, UK), and fixed to the membrane by baking for 30 min at 120°C using standard protocols [39]. A
282 bp fragment of the aphVIII coding region was amplified by PCR (Expand High Fidelity Plus PCR System;
Roche Applied Science) and simultaneously labeled using
a digoxigenin DNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science).
A 343 bp fragment of the coding region of the luciferase
(luc) gene from G. princeps (codon-optimized for C. reinhardtii) was amplified in the same way. Pre-hybridization
at 52°C, hybridization at 52°C, and washing steps were
carried out in standard solutions (Roche Applied Science).
Detection of the hybridizing bands was done by using an
anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:7500
dilution) and the chemiluminescent substrate CDP Star®,
in accordance with the instructions of the supplier of the
chemiluminescence reagent (Roche Applied Science).
Chemiluminescence-sensitive films (Retina XBA; Fotochemische Werke, Berlin, Germany) were subsequently
exposed to the membranes for 2–15 min.
Isolation of total RNA
Total RNA was isolated from ~9 × 106 Gonium cells using
the membrane-based SV Total RNA Isolation System
(Promega, Madison, WI). RNA quantification and purity
checks were done by agarose gel electrophoresis and by
measuring absorption at 260 and 280 nm with an Ultrospec™ 2100 pro UV/Visible Spectrophotometer (GE
Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden).
Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR
First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μg
total RNA and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)
reverse transcriptase lacking ribonuclease H activity (H

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/64

minus), according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Promega). Subsequent PCR was carried out using the
Mid Range PCR system, according to the instructions provided by the vendor (Peqlab). PCR was performed on a T3
Thermocycler PCR system (Biometra) using the following
cycling conditions: 40 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 55°C for 30
s, and 68°C for 45 s and a final extension at 68°C for 10
min. The RT-PCR products were cloned and sequenced.
Western blot analysis
Eight hundred milliliters of a logarithmically growing culture containing ~5 × 107 cells was harvested by centrifugation (3500 g, 8 min, swing-out rotor), washed with 20
mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and disrupted using a
Sonopuls™ HD2070 sonicator (Bandelin Electronic, Berlin, Germany). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation
(86,000 g, 90 min), passed through a Centricon® 100 column (Millipore, Bedford, MA), concentrated on a Centricon® 10 column (Millipore), and used for western blot
analysis. Samples were separated on a 10% standard SDSpolyacrylamide gel, electroblotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (0.45 μm; Millipore), and probed using
a purified polyclonal rabbit anti-AphVIII antibody at
1:100 dilution [20,21]. The secondary antibody was a
horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit-IgG at 1:10,000
dilution (Bio-Rad). Signals were visualized by using the
luminol-based chemiluminescent substrate Lumiglo®
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and Hyperfilm™ ECL films (Amersham Biosciences).
Luciferase assays
For assays on light-sensitive films, a Gonium culture (50
ml) with 3–6 × 106 cells/ml was centrifuged, resuspended
in 850 μl assay buffer [0.1 M K2HPO4 (pH 7.6), 0.5 M
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA] and cells were disrupted using a
Sonopuls™ HD2070 sonicator (Bandelin Electronic) and
the lysate was transferred to a 24-well plate. After addition
of 150 μl 0.05 mM coelenterazine (Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany) in assay buffer, the 24-well plate was exposed to a
chemiluminescence-sensitive film (Retina XBA; Fotochemische Werke) for 30 s at 20°C [40].

Quantitation of bioluminescence was performed as
described by Shao and Bock [27]. For it, 5 ml of a Gonium
culture, which has been grown at 23°C to a density of 3–
6 × 106 cells/ml, was centrifuged, resuspended in 300 μl
sample buffer [1.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM EDTA],
and frozen at -20°C for at least 20 min. After thawing, 20
μl samples were added to 125 μl of the assay buffer [0.1 M
K2HPO4 (pH 7.6), 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA]. Following
incubation for 15 min at 20°C in the dark, samples were
transferred to clear polystyrene vials (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany), 50 μl 0.01 mM coelenterazine was added,
and bioluminescence was assayed at 20°C using a
MiniLumat LB9506 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wild-

bad, Germany). The luminescence was recorded as relative light units.
For analysis of induction of luciferase activity in heatshocked transformants, organisms were subject to a temperature shift from 23 to 36°C for 1 h, because in preliminary tests, shifts to 36° resulted in the strongest induction
in comparison to lower or higher temperatures (data not
shown). After a 1 h recovery phase at 23°C, cells were
lysed by freezing and thawing and luciferase activity was
assayed at 20°C as described above [27]. As a reference,
non-heat-shocked transformants were analyzed in the
same way. The induction factors were calculated by comparison of heat-shocked with non-heat-shocked samples.
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignment of sequences was done using the MUltiple
Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation program
(MUSCLE) [41]. Minor manual optimization of alignments, trimming, and management of multi-aligned data
was done with BioEdit v7.0.9 [42]. Alignments were illustrated using GeneDoc 2.6 [43]. The Needleman-Wunsch
global alignment algorithm [44] from the European
Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) was
used for the comparison of two sequences [45]. Unrooted
consensus trees were calculated using the PHYLogeny
Inference Package (PHYLIP) [46]. For each consensus tree,
10000 bootstrap resamplings of multi-aligned sequences
were generated with Seqboot, distance matrices were computed with Dnadist, trees were constructed using the
neighbor-joining method [47] as implemented in Neighbor, and finally a consensus tree was built using Consense. Phylogenetic trees were drawn with TreeView [48].
