Abstract
Background: The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum executes a multicellular development
program upon starvation. This morphogenetic process requires the differential regulation of a large
number of genes and is coordinated by extracellular signals. The MADS-box transcription factor
SrfA is required for several stages of development, including slug migration and spore terminal
differentiation.
Results: Subtractive hybridization allowed the isolation of a gene, sigN (SrfA-induced gene N), that
was dependent on the transcription factor SrfA for expression at the slug stage of development.
Homology searches detected the existence of a large family of sigN-related genes in the
Dictyostelium discoideum genome. The 13 most similar genes are grouped in two regions of
chromosome 2 and have been named Group1 and Group2 sigN genes. The putative encoded
proteins are 87–89 amino acids long. All these genes have a similar structure, composed of a first
exon containing a 13 nucleotides long open reading frame and a second exon comprising the
remaining of the putative coding region. The expression of these genes is induced at10 hours of
development. Analyses of their promoter regions indicate that these genes are expressed in the
prestalk region of developing structures. The addition of antibodies raised against SigN Group 2
proteins induced disintegration of multi-cellular structures at the mound stage of development.
Conclusion: A large family of genes coding for small proteins has been identified in D. discoideum.
Two groups of very similar genes from this family have been shown to be specifically expressed in
prestalk cells during development. Functional studies using antibodies raised against Group 2 SigN
proteins indicate that these genes could play a role during multicellular development.

Background
The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is one of the
simplest model systems utilized for the study of multi-cellular development. This organism lives as individual
amoeba on forest soils, feeding on other microorganisms.

However, when their food source is exhausted, they aggregate in groups of up to 100,000 cells and initiate a multicellular developmental program to form a fruiting body
that stands on the substrate (reviewed in [1]). At the top
of the fruiting body, inside the sorus, a large proportion of

the original amoeba differentiate into resistant forms,
called spores, that stay alive for long periods of time.
Spores disseminate in the media and germinate to give
rise to new amoeba when they reach favourable environmental conditions.
Aggregation of the amoebae is directed by chemotaxis to
cAMP, secreted from discrete aggregation centres
(reviewed in [2]). Cells that converge towards aggregation
centres adhere among them forming small mounds covered by an extracellular matrix [3]. Cell-cell adhesion is
mediated by several membrane proteins, whose expression is induced during development. The first known cellcell adhesion system to be induced, soon after starvation,
is Ca-dependent and is composed of the homophilic protein DdCAD-1 (gp24), encoded by the gene cadA[4]. A
second homophilic, EDTA-resistant, adhesion system is
induced at the onset of aggregation and is composed by
the gp80 protein, encoded by the csaA gene [5,6]. A third
adhesion system is induced later during aggregation being
mediated by the gp150 proteins, encoded by the gene lagC
[7]. Mutations in some of the genes coding for these adhesion systems or experimental conditions that interfere
with their function, compromise the formation or stability of the multicellular structure [8-10].
Cells in the aggregates follow two alternative differentiation programs to become prestalk or prespore cells. At the
same time, these cells continue to move towards cAMP
secreted from the centre of the mound. Differences in
chemotaxis to cAMP and in cell adhesion mediate the segregation of cell types so that prestalk cells migrate centrally and upwards to form a small protrusion, or tip, at
the upper part of the structure [11]. This organization is
maintained during most of development, including a
migratory structure, the slug, that is formed under particular environmental conditions. Coordinated cell movement and differentiation continues during the rest of the
morphogenetic process when prestalk cells move downwards to the substrate and differentiate to form the stalk.
In the meanwhile, prespore cells migrate upwards to form
the sorus where they differentiate to spores.
Morphogenesis is coordinated through the secretion of
different factors that regulate cell adhesion, migration and
differentiation, cAMP being the most important among
them. The chlorinated alkyl phenone DIF-1 is also an
important regulator of stalk cell differentiation [12].
Other cell-signalling factors are peptides or small proteins
that are secreted by some cells to regulate the activity of
neighbouring cells. For example, countin (258 amino
acids long) and D11 (284 amino acids, encoded by the
gene ampA) are secreted proteins that inhibit cell adhesion
and contribute to regulate the size of the structure [13,14].
Also two secreted peptides, SDF-1 and SDF-2, originated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/1

by proteolysis of the AcbA protein, induce spore differentiation at culmination [15].
Dictyostelium multi-cellular development is also dependent on the co-ordinated regulation of gene expression.
Multiple genes are either inhibited or induced at different
stages of development [16]. This regulation is obtained by
the activity of several transcription factors whose expression, or activity, is regulated during development [17].
One of the best-known transcription factors that regulates
development is GBF (G-box binding factor), that is
required for induction of many prestalk and prespore
genes in the mound. For example, expression of the gene
lagC, coding for the adhesion protein gp150, is dependent
on GBF [18].
The MADS-box transcription factor SrfA is also involved
in the regulation of multi-cellular development. Strains
where the srfA gene has been knocked out showed defects
in slug migration, morphogenesis and spore differentiation [19,20]. The identification of genes regulated by SrfA
and involved in these processes can be an interesting
approach to the study of development. Twenty four SrfAdependent genes specifically expressed during spore differentiation have been described previously [21,22]. This
article describes the isolation of SrfA-dependent genes
expressed at the slug stage of development and focused on
one of them, sigN (SrfA-induced gene N). This gene
belongs to an extensive family of genes coding for small
proteins, containing less than 100 amino acids, which are
expressed in the prestalk region and seem to be involved
in maintaining the integrity of the cell aggregates.

Methods
Cell culture, transformation and development
Dictyostelium cells were grown axenically in HL5 medium
[23]. Transformations were carried out as described by
Kuspa and Loomis [24]. Transformed cells were selected
by treatment with blasticidine [25] or neomycin (GP418).
Transformants were grown on SM plates in association
with Klebsiella aerogenes for clonal isolation [23]. Development on nitrocellulose filters was performed as described
by Shaulsky and Loomis [26].
Subtractive library construction
RNA was isolated from slug structures of Wild Type (AX4)
and srfA- strains using Trizol reagent (Gibco-BRL). Four
micrograms of poly(A)+RNA, purified using a mRNA purification kit (GEHealthcare), were used for synthesis of a
cDNA subtraction library using a PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech), as previously described [21].
Wild-type cDNA was used as the tester cDNA, and srfAcDNA as the driver cDNA. Subtracted cDNAs were cloned
in the pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega).

Analyses of the promoter regions
Putative promoter regions of the sigN2 and sigN9 genes
were amplified by PCR and cloned in the PsA-ialphagal
vector [27], in substitution of the PsA promoter (excised
as a XbaI-BglII fragment). Reporter vectors were transfected in AX4 cells by electroporation and the transformed
colonies selected by geneticin (GP418) resistance. β-galactosidase activity was detected on developing structures as
previously described [28].
Generation of plasmid vectors
The plasmid vector used for RNA interference was based
on exon 2 of sigN3. This exon was amplified by PCR and
introduced in a pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega). This
sequence was used to amplify the reverse complement.
Forward and reverse fragments were cloned flanking a
stuffer DNA [29] and the whole construct introduced in a
Dictyostelium expression vector: pDXA-HC [30].

For generation of the sigN over-expression vector, a 300
bp fragment of the sigN4 gene was amplified by PCR and
introduced in pGEMT-Easy vector. The fragment was
taken out through a HindIII/XhoI digestion, and introduced in the expression vector pDXA-HC, under the control of the actin 15 promoter.
The sigN Group1 KO construct was generated from two
regions of 460 and 1300 bp respectively, flanking the
genomic region to be deleted. These fragments were
amplified by PCR and introduced in the pBlueScript vector, flanking a blasticidin-resistance cassette. Oligonucleotides 5'-CGAATTCCCTTCTAATTGGTCTAATC-3' and 5'CGCGGCCGCGGAGTTGGTTCCATTTTAACTGG-3' were
used for amplification of the 460 bp fragment and oligonucleotides
5'-CGGATCCCGCCGTGGCGGCATTAGCATTAGC-3' and 5'-GAATTCGTGAGAACAGCACTGACT
TACCTCC-3' for that of the 1300 bp fragment. The sigN
Group 2 KO vector was constructed in a similar way from
two fragments of 1000 and 730 bp, flanking the genomic
region to be eliminated. These fragments were generated
by PCR and cloned in pBlueScript at both sites of the Blasticidin-resistance cassette. Oligonucleotides 5'-CGAATTCCTACCGATGTTTCAGCAAGAGG-3' and 5'-CGGATC
CCACAGTTGGTACCATTACAAATCC-3' were used for
amplification of the 1000 bp fragment and 5'-CCGGTACCCTGTCAATGGAGTTGTTGGAGG-3'
and
5'-CCCTGCAGGAATCAAGAGGATCTGGTCAATTGG-3' for that of
the 730 bp fragment. The double-KO of Group 1 and
Group 2 genes was made by co-transfection of the plasmid vector used for generation of the Group 1 deletion
and the reporter vector ialphagal, carrying the neomycin
resistance gene [27], in Group 2 mutant cells. Transformed cells were selected by treatment with GP418,
grown on SM plates in association with Klebsiella aerogenes
and individual colonies analysed for deletion of Group 1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/1

genes by PCR. Colonies that presented deletion of Group
1 and Group 2 genes were isolated.
Generation of antibodies against Group 1 and Group 2
proteins
The differences in amino acid sequence between group 1
and group 2 proteins were used to design group-specific
peptides, CGSVLHGVGSILTGG (Group 1) and CGTVVGTVNGVVGGL (Group 2), used as antigens. Antibodies
were generated by Genosphere Biotechnologies (Paris,
France)
Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting
Cells were washed free of liquid medium spread on cover
slips and fixed with 4% PBS-paraformaldehyde during 30
minutes at room temperature. Mound structures were
developed on Nitrocellulose Filters and transferred to
cover slips before fixation. Cells and structures were
washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with chilled methanol during 2 minutes, washed again with PBS and
blocked with PBS+0,2% BSA for 20 minutes. Incubation
with the first antibody was made in 150 μl of blocking
buffer for 1 hour. Preparations were washed 6 times (5
minutes each) with PBS+BSA before incubation with150
μl of Alexa 568-coupled secondary antibody (dilution 1/
1000) for 30 minutes. Preparations were washed twice
with PBS+BSA and mounted with Prolong. Images were
taken with a confocal microscopy (Olympus Fluoview
1000 confocal microscope) and processed with Adobe
Photoshop software.

Western blot analyses of total protein extracts from vegetative cells were made as previously described [31].
Sequence Alignments
Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments were
performed with the ClustalW program at the San Diego
Supercomputer Centre server. The alignments obtained
were checked out in a local machine with the ClustalX
program. Aligned sequences were used for the generation
of phylogenetic trees using the CLC Free Workbench software.

Results
Identification of a large family of genes related to sigN, a
srfA-dependent gene
Strains mutant for the srfA gene showed abnormal slug
migration [20], suggesting that genes whose expression is
regulated by the transcription factor SrfA could be directly
involved in proper function of the slugs. The isolation of
SrfA-dependent genes was approached by the synthesis of
a differential cDNA library using RNA isolated from WT
slugs subtracted with RNA from srfA- slugs. Several cDNA
clones were obtained whose expression was higher in WT

than in srfA- slugs. One of them, named sigN (SRF-induced
gene N), is described in this article.
The nucleotide sequence of the sigN cDNA was compared
with the D. discoideum genome sequence. The corresponding gene is located in chromosome 2 and contains two
exons separated by one small intron. The open reading
frame region contained in exon 1 is 13 nucleotides long,
and that of exon 2 is 254 nucleotides long. The encoded
protein is, therefore, 89 amino acids long and contains a
large proportion of serine cystein and glycine residues (Fig
1B). Blast searches of Dictyostelium SigN protein did not
detect any homology with proteins in other organisms.
The product of the gene sigN, appears in the Dictyostelium
database as a "cysteine knot domain-containing protein".
Cysteine-knot is a special folding domain found in many
extracellular proteins like TGF-β2, PDGF, NGF and some
neurotoxins. This kind of structure involves six conserved
cysteines, generating three intramolecular disulphide
bridges arranged in a knot-like topology, which gives a
highly efficient motif for structure stabilization. The difference between this classic cysteine knot and the knot
found in SigN1 is the number of cysteines, four instead of
six, in this hypothetical protein. Several programs also
predicted the existence of a putative transmembrane
domain between amino acids 54 and 76 of the protein.
Homology searches in the Dictyostelium genome
detected the existence of 96 genes coding for small proteins (less than 120 amino acids) with high similarity to
SigN. Most of the genes (89/96) presented the same gene
structure: one exon with a 13 nt long open reading frame,
one intron and a second exon. The closest homologous
genes are shown in Table 1 and a complete relation is
shown in Additional file 1. The phylogenetic relation
among these proteins is shown in Figure 2. The analyses
of functional domain databases showed a hypothetical
"coiled-coil" secondary structure in some of the proteins.
This is a structural domain usually involved in oligomerization of proteins and is present in proteins with very different functions, which made it impossible to predict a
priori a possible function for these proteins.
Analysis of the complete sequence of Dictyostelium
genome at the DictyBase database allowed determination
of the location of all these genes. The gene coding for the
cDNA initially isolated and the closest homologous genes
were grouped in a 7 kb long region of chromosome 2 (Fig
1A and Table 1). All these genes code for highly similar
proteins (Fig 1B, Fig 2) and have been named sigN1 (the
gene isolated from the subtractive library), sigN2, 3, 4, 5
and 25 (Group 1). Another group of genes with high identity to sigN1 was found in a different 10 kb long region of
chromosome 2 (Fig 1A). The members of this second
group showed lower identity with sigN1, between 60–

bootstrap trials. The number of times each branch was
obtained is indicated. The number assigned to each sigN gene

70% of the amino acids of the encoded proteins are identical to SigN1 (Table 1). However, the identity among the
proteins encoded by this second group of genes was about
95% (Fig 1B), which made them group together in the
phylogenetic tree (Fig 2). These genes have been named
sigN6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 14 (Group 2). The identity of the
proteins encoded by the two groups of genes was very
high in their N-terminal regions. However, there were
some group-specific differences at the C-terminal region
(Fig 1B). Genes DDB0217094 (sigN105) and
DDB0168488 (sigN10) are located in the chromosomal
region of group 1 and 2 genes, respectively. They have not
been included in these groups because of their lower identity with the other genes, as shown in the phylogenetic
tree (Fig 2). The identity of the hypothetical protein
encoded by sigN105 with group 1 proteins was about
62% and that encoded by sigN10 showed an identity with
the members of group 2 of about 64%.

agreement with the results obtained in the subtractive
method used for isolation of the gene.

Temporal expression of sigN genes
The cDNA isolated in the differential screening was used
as a probe to analyze the developmental expression of
these genes in WT and srfA- strains by Northern blot (Fig
3A). No expression was detected in proliferating cells
(time 0 of development) or during the first hours of development. sigN expression was induced at 10 hours in WT
cells and is maintained during the rest of development.
SrfA mutant strains also showed induction of sigN expression at 12 hours of development but gene expression was
lower than in WT cells, especially at later stages of development. The expression of sigN at the slug stage of development was also lower in the srfA- strains than in WT, in

Analyses of sigN promoters
The temporal pattern of expression of the sigN genes and
their partial dependence on the SrfA transcription factor
prompted the interest in the study of their promoter
regions. The complete intergenic region upstream of each
gene, up to the closest coding region, was considered
putative promoter region in these studies. In some cases,
genes are adjacent and in opposite orientation (For example, genes sigN1 and sigN3 in Fig 2A) and their putative
promoter regions are complementary to each other. Clustal alignment studies were performed to find possible
identities among putative promoter regions. The intergenic regions of Group 2 genes showed a high sequence

The probe used to determine the differential expression of
sigN covered 190 nt in the coding sequence of this gene. It
is very likely that the probe can detect Group 1 and Group
2 mRNAs, due to the high identity that exists among the
genes. Specific oligonucleotides were designed to study
the expression of the two groups of genes independently,
based on the differences in their C-terminal-coding
regions. RT-PCR studies showed that expression of Group
1 genes was first detected at 2 hours of development with
a rise at 12 hours, when the mound is completely formed
(Fig 3B). Group 2 genes showed no expression until 10
hours of development with maximal induction obtained
at 14 hours. In this case, the lower bands obtained in the
RT-PCR reactions were sequenced and did not correspond
to any specific amplification product.

Expression pattern of sigN genes during multicellular development. A. RNAs from WT and srfA- strains were collected at the indicated hours (0–30) or at the slug stage of development (slug). The coding region of the sigN1 gene was used
as probe for hybridization. The mRNA detected migrated faster than the 18S rRNA. Ethidium bromide staining of the gel is
shown in the lower panel. Hybridization signals were quantified by densitometry and normalized for the rRNA present in each
lane (lower graphic). The value obtained for the 12 hours sample of the WT strain was considered 100% of expression. B.
RNA was obtained from WT (AX4) strains, collected at the indicated hours of development. SigN genes expression was determined by RT-PCR using oligonucleotides specific for each group of genes. The sequence amplified for both groups was about
240 bp, and the control sequence, obtained by amplification of a region of the large mitochondrial ribosomal RNA, about 320
bp. Bands were quantified by densitometry, normalized in relation to the control and represented in a bar graphic, assigning
100% expression to the16 hours sample for Group 1 and 14 hours sample for Group 2.

identity (Fig 4A). The similarities of the putative promoter
regions are indicated in the phylogenectic tree shown in
Figure 4B. Promoter regions of the genes sigN7 and 9 (and
their complementary sequences sigN12 and 14) are more
similar between them and slightly more distant from
sigN8 (complementary to sigN11) and sigN6. Putative promoter regions of adjacent genes, that are inverted in relation to each other, also shown significant identity among
them indicating their palindromic structure, as schematically shown in Figure 4C. These data indicate that the
genes in this group could have derived by successive
duplication of a tandem of two inverted sigN genes.
Intergenic regions of the Group 1 genes sigN1-sigN3 and
sigN2-sigN4 are very similar between them but do not
have the palindromic structure described for Group 2
genes. Therefore, the putative promoter region of the
sigN1 gene is very similar to that of sigN2 and the same
hold true for sigN3 and sigN4 regions. However, the sigN1
promoter region does not show similarity to that of the
contiguous sigN3 gene. Similarly, the sigN2 putative promoter region does not show similarity to that of sigN4.
These regions do not show similarity with the sigN5 and
sigN25 putative promoter regions, either.
The comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the putative promoter regions of Group2 genes detected the existence of four repetition of a conserved G-rich sequence
(boxed in Fig 4A), also present in Group 1 promoters.
These sequences are very similar to the GBF response element: (T/G)G (T/G)G (T/G)G (T/G) [32]. Group 2 promoter regions contain two pairs of closely locate GBFbinding sites, labelled as regions A and B in Figures 4A
and 4C, that could regulate the expression of the contiguous opposite genes.
The functionality of the putative promoter regions was
tested using reporter vectors where a lacZ gene coding for
unstable β-galactosidase was placed under the transcriptional control of sigN promoters. These assays also
allowed determining the spatial pattern of expression of
these genes during development. The high similarity of
these genes made very difficult the use of in situ hybridization to study the expression of specific genes of this family
during development. These studies were focused on putative promoter regions of one Group 1 gene (sigN2) and
one of the Group 2 genes (sigN9) given the similarity
observed between the promoters of each group. Staining
of the structures transformed with the reporter vectors
indicate that both putative promoter regions direct gene
expression in the prestalk region of developing structures
(Fig 5). Promoter of the sigN2 gene showed weaker activity in these assays but lacZ expression was first observed in
disperse cells in the mound stage of development. Later
on, prestalk cells placed at the tip of the structure showed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/1

lacZ expression in first finger and early culminant structures (Fig 5A). At the slug stage promoter activity was
detected in cells dispersed through the structure, with a
pattern similar to that of Anterior Like Cells (Fig 5A). The
promoter of the sigN9 gene also directed expression in dispersed cells in mounds and in prestalk cells at the tip of
first finger and early culminant structures and in dispersed
cells in the slugs (Fig 5B). In addition, sigN9 promoter
also directed lacZ expression in the cells that migrate from
the tip to form the stalk during culmination and in stalk
cells of the fruiting body.
Function of sigN genes
Over-expression and under-expression of sigN genes was
intended to study the function of these genes. Overexpression was performed by cloning the gene sigN4
under the control of the actin 15 promoter. Western blot
analyses of vegetative cells using antibodies specific for
Group 1 proteins indicated the expression of a 12 kDa
protein in the over-expressing strains that was not
detected in the WT strain (Fig 6A). No difference in phenotype was found between the WT and the over-expression strains. Downregulation was initially approached by
the expression of interfering RNA. Two copies of sigN3
exon 2 were placed in an inverted orientation, separated
by a stuffer sequence, under the control of an actin 15 promoter. The great identity in the N-terminal-coding region
of these genes, could make possible that the iRNA fragments generated from this construct would interfere with
the expression of all sigN genes. Strains expressing this
iRNA construct showed a strong reduction in the expression of sigN RNAs (Fig 6B) but did not show any difference in their phenotype in relation to WT strains. Mutant
strains were also obtained where all sigN genes of Group1,
Group2 or both groups were deleted by homologous
recombination. Deleted regions are indicated in Figure
1A. RT-PCR analysis was used to corroborate the absence
of sigN expression in these strains (Fig 6C–E). However,
neither of the mutant strains did show any difference in
growth or development in comparison to the WT strain.

Many proteins are secreted during Dictyostelium development to coordinate morphogenesis and differentiation.
Some of these proteins have low molecular weight and
present post-translational modifications, like glycosylations. Examples of these molecules are PSF, CMF, countin
factor and SDF, as mentioned in the Introduction section.
The small size of SigN proteins, the existence of hypothetical glycosylation sites and the predicted presence of a
cysteine-knot structure and a putative transmembrane
region would be in agreement with an extra-cellular function for these proteins. To test this hypothesis, specific
antibodies were raised against the proteins of each group.

To further study the possible function of these proteins,
antibodies were added in vivo to developing cells to try
interfering some of the developmental processes. Preimmune antiserum was used as control. Specific antibodies against Group 1 proteins did not show any obvious
interference with the developmental process in comparison with pre-immune and phosphate-based buffer (PDF)
controls.

The addition of antibodies specific for the Group 2 proteins produced some differences, in comparison to preimmune or PDF controls. Mounds were formed two hours
earlier in the presence of Group2-specific antibodies.
From there on, mounds began to disaggregate and, at 15
hours of development, when a finger is normally formed,
no visible structure remained in the filters (Fig 8). At 15
hours of development the filter treated with the antibody
was divided in two parts. One of them was incubated for
10 more hours with a PDF phosphate-based buffer, and
the other with antibody added to fresh medium. The part
incubated in PDF developed in a usual way, forming new
mounds. The part of the filter that continued in the presence of the antibody was unable to form any structure (Fig
8). These results make us suggest that sigN Group 2 genes
could be involved in the aggregation process, contributing
to maintain the coherence of the multi-cellular structure.

Discussion
The study of the gene sigN1, partially dependent on the
transcription factor SrfA for expression, has uncovered the
existence of a family of genes coding for very similar small
proteins in D. discoideum. The family is large with, at least,
96 genes, although the present study has been centred on
13 closely related genes located in two regions of chromosome 2. These genes have in common their structure and
developmental pattern of expression, in addition to the
high similarity of their nucleotide sequences. These genes
have been divided in two groups based on the sequence of
a small divergent region that code for the C-terminal
region of the protein, and their chromosomal location.
Phylogenetic analyses of the coding and intergenic
regions suggest that the genes of each group might have
originated by duplication of an original tandem of two
genes, oriented in opposite directions.
All the genes are constituted by an exon, containing a 13
nt long open reading frame, an intron and a second exon,
coding for the rest or the protein. The same structure is
share by most of the 96 similar genes mentioned above.
The conserved structure of these genes might be indicative
of their common evolutionary origin.
Northern and RT-PCR studies have shown that Group1
and Group2 sigN genes expression is induced at 10–12
hours of multi-cellular development. Analyses of the promoter regions of one gene of each group indicate that sigN
genes are expressed in the prestalk region. The sequence of
the putative promoter regions, very similar among Group
2 genes, contain several copies of a conserved G/C rich
motif similar to the GBF transcription factor binding site
[32]. GBF expression is developmentally regulated and
necessary for the expression of numerous prestalk and
prespore genes [10]. Microarray analysis of GBF-dependent genes identified sigN12 as one of them [18], in agree-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/1

ment with the presence of putative GBF-binding sites in
the promoter region. Two other sigN related genes,
DDB0230164 (sigN103) and DDB0231563 (sigN107),
coding for proteins that are 41% and 35% identical to
SigN1, respectively, are also dependent on GBF for their
expression The developmental pattern of expression of
these genes was also very similar to that of sigN genes.
Besides, Microarray and in situ hybridization analyses of
the expression of these genes have shown that these three
GBF-dependent genes are expressed in the prestalk region,
including sigN12 [18,33]. These data are in agreement
with the results presented in this article and suggest that,
since all these genes are very similar in sequence and
present similar temporal and spatial patterns of expression, might accomplish similar, and perhaps redundant,
biological functions.
The study of the function of sigN genes was approached by
their over-expression, under-expression and by deletion.
However, even the deletion of the 13 Group 1 and Group
2 genes seemed to have no effect on development. These
data could be explained by the redundant functions of
this family of genes, as previously suggested on the bases
of their structure and expression.
Only the addition of specific antibodies raised against
Group 2 sigN genes had some effect on development,
inducing disaggregration of mound structures. This effect
was specific since antibodies raised against Group 1 peptides or pre-immune serum had no effect on this process.
With the exception of the sigN4 over-expressing strain, the
antibodies raised against SigN peptides did not recognize
these proteins in Western blot, which precluded further
studies on their specificity. With this caveat in mind, the
simplest explanation for these results obtained would be
that Group 2 SigN proteins could participate in cell-cell
adhesion and that the presence of the antibody could
block interactions of SigN with other proteins, required
for cell adhesion. As mentioned in the Results section,
many proteins containing cysteine knot domains are
extracellular, which would be in agreement with the function proposed for SigN Group 2 proteins. Antibodies
raised against Group 1 and Group 2 proteins stained small
vesicles in cells at the mound stage or development, which
would be also in agreement with their proposed secretion.
The expression pattern was similar for both antibodies, as
expected from the similar structural domains predicted for
the proteins of both groups.
According to the hypothesis suggested above, sigN Group
2 mutants would be expected to show defective aggregation, which was not the case. As mentioned above, functional redundancy between sigN genes could explain these
results since the sig N Group 2 mutants could still maintain cell adhesion through the interaction of other related

Development in the presence of antibodies specific for Group 2 sigN proteins
Figure 8
Development in the presence of antibodies specific for Group 2 sigN proteins. AX4 cells were placed on nitrocellulose filters to induce multicellular development. Filters were placed over pads soaked on phosphate buffer alone (PDF) or containing preimmune serum (preimmune) or a serum raised against a Group 2-specific peptide (Anti-P2). At 15 hours of
development, the antiserum filter was divided in two parts. One half was placed on a new pad soaked in PDF alone (PDF) and
the other on a pad soaked in PDF containing Group 2 antiserum (Anti-P2), as shown in the lower part of the right-hand panels.
Pictures were taken at the times of development indicated at the left of the panels with a stereomicroscope (Bar, 0,15 mm).

proteins. A search for proteins containing sequences similar to the one of the peptide used to raise Group 2 specific
antibodies showed that at least two other proteins of the
sigN family, encoded by genes DDB0230164 (sigN103)
and DDB0168566 (sigN110), presented sequences very
similar to the peptide. One of these genes, DDB0230164
(sigN103), was also dependent on GBF for expression. It
is, therefore, possible that these proteins could mediate
cell adhesion in sigN Group 2 mutants. Antibodies would
bind to all the proteins that contain this sequence, including Group 2 and other proteins, blocking all protein interactions. In agreement with this hypothesis, the antibody is
able to disintegrate mounds formed by the Group 2
mutant strain (data not shown). These results are similar
to those previously described for other cell-cell adhesion
proteins. For example, a peptide from the N-terminal
region of the gp80 protein prevented cell adhesion [9]
while a mutant lacking the encoding gene (csA) had no
obvious phenotype in experimental conditions similar to
the ones used in the present study [34]. Antibodies specific for the cell adhesion protein DdCAD-1 also arrested
development at aggregation [35].
SigN Group 2 proteins could be also involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix that surrounds multicellular structures, isolating them from the environment
and providing a substrate for cell adhesion and migration.
The extracellular matrix is composed of cellulose and proteins, synthesized by prestalk cells [3]. Early studies on the
composition of the extra-cellular matrix identified a population of urea-insoluble proteins smaller than 15 kDa in
size. These proteins had an higher content in serine,
cysteine, glycine, valine and aspartic acid/asparagine and
a lower content in lysine and arginine than whole-cell
proteins [36]. SigN proteins had a similarly high proportion of cysteine, glycine and serine and a low proportion
of lysine and arginine. Besides, they are expressed in prestalk cells, which would be compatible with their presence
in the extra-cellular matrix.
Immunocytochemical studies detected the presence of
these proteins in small vesicles of mound cells. However,
no staining was found either at the plasma membrane, as
expected if they were involved in cell-cell interactions, or
at the extracellular matrix, making impossible to discern
between the alternative possibilities discussed above. The
lack of reactivity could be due to conformational changes
in the extra-cellular medium or to their incorporation into
structures where they would not be accessible to the antibodies used in immunocytochemistry. Therefore, while a
function in cell adhesion or extracellular matrix formation
is suggested, the lack of information on the specificity of
the antibodies and a inability to detect membrane or
external antibody binding necessitates further experiments to support this conclusion.

Conclusion
A large family of genes coding for small proteins has been
identified. Most of the genes have a similar structure containing a first exon, coding for a 13 nucleotide long open
reading frame region, an intron, and a second exon coding
for the rest of the protein. Two groups of these genes, coding for very similar proteins and closely assembled in two
different regions of chromosome 2, have been studied in
more detail. These genes are specifically expressed at the
prestalk region during development of multicellular structures. Immunochemical studies indicated that these proteins could be secreted. The addition of antibodies raised
against group 2 proteins avoided formation of cellular
aggregates, which suggest a possible role for these proteins
in development.
