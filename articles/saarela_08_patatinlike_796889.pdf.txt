Abstract
Background: In oviparous species, genes encoding proteins with functions in lipid remodeling,
such as specialized lipases, may have evolved to facilitate the assembly and utilization of yolk lipids
by the embryo. The mammalian gene family of patatin-like phospholipases (PNPLAs) has received
significant attention, but studies in other vertebrates are lacking; thus, we have begun investigations
of PNPLA genes in the chicken (Gallus gallus).
Results: We scanned the draft chicken genome using human PNPLA sequences, and performed
PCR to amplify and sequence orthologous cDNAs. Full-length cDNA sequences of galline PNPLA2/
ATGL, PNPLA4, -7, -8, -9, and the activator protein CGI-58, as well as partial cDNA sequences of avian
PNPLA1, -3, and -6 were obtained. The high degree of sequence identities (~50 to 80%) between
the avian and human orthologs suggests conservation of important enzymatic functions.
Quantitation by qPCR of the transcript levels of PNPLAs and CGI-58 in 21 tissues indicates that
expression patterns and levels diverge greatly between species. A particularly interesting tissue in
which certain PNPLAs may contribute to physiological specialization is the extraembryonic yolk
sac.
Conclusion: Knowledge about the exact in-vivo functions of PNPLAs in any system is still sparse.
Thus, studies about the temporal expression patterns and functions of the enzymes identified here,
and of other already known extracellular lipases and co-factors, in the yolk sac and embryonic
tissues during embryogenesis are called for. Based on the information obtained, further studies are
anticipated to provide important insights of the roles of PNPLAs in the yolk sac and embryo
development.

Background
In egg-laying species, the oocyte's yolk is the major source
of nutrients and regulatory factors for the developing
embryo. The accumulation of yolk is predominantly the
result of massive transport of lipids and proteins from the
liver to oocytes situated within ovarian follicles [1]. In

mature hens of the domesticated chicken (Gallus gallus),
fully-grown oocytes contain up to 5 g triacylglycerols (TG)
and 240 mg cholesterol, and ovulate every 25 h. In parallel to this oocyte-targeted flow, lipid homeostasis of
somatic tissues including the follicular cell layers is maintained. Subsequent to fertilization of the oocyte, normal

embryo growth likewise depends on efficient nutrient
transfer, i.e., mainly of lipid components, from the yolk
into the embryonic circulation. These mobilization processes are maintained through concerted regulation of
lipoprotein metabolism involving genes for lipases, lipid
transfer proteins, lipoprotein receptors, and others. Thus,
the laying hen is a prime model for delineating molecular
mechanisms underlying both unidirectional (hepatooocyte-embryo) mass lipid transfer and fine-tuned regulation of systemic lipid metabolism. Moreover, the known
components of this dichotomous regulatory system are
highly similar to those in mammals including man,
despite the specific tasks they perform [2]. Finally, the laying hen's lipid metabolism is a remarkable paradigm for
hormonal control, as estrogen directly regulates not only
the hepatic expression of genes for yolk precursor synthesis (e.g., vitellogenin and very low density lipoproteins,
VLDL) [3,4], but likely is also involved in the modulation
of lipolytic activities and lipid transfer processes important in deposition of yolk into oocytes and subsequent
embryonic yolk utilization [5]. Estrogen also induces a
unique apolipoprotein residing on VLDL particles, i.e.,
apoVLDL-II, which inhibits VLDL-lipolysis by lipoprotein
lipase (LPL) in the circulation, thereby assuring efficient
transport of TG into the oocyte for subsequent use by the
growing embryo [6]. Thus, to mediate the mobilization of
lipids from yolk, lipolytic enzymes resistant to apoVLDLII must exist which allow the developing embryo to efficiently access the lipid moiety of yolk lipoproteins.

identification of LPL [8,9] and the delineation of circulating apoVLDL-II as inhibitor of LPL [6], to date very little is
known about other lipolytic enzymes of the chicken, their
genes, expression patterns, modulation and regulation, let
alone their functional properties in the above described
processes. In man, several patatin-like lipases were identified [10,11], but their physiological roles, with the exception of adiposome TG-lipase (ATGL) [12,13], remain to
be elucidated. The patatin-like phospholipases (PNPLAs)
contain a patatin domain with lipid acyl hydrolase activity
that has been described as nonspecific. Patatin was first
identified in potato tubers [14], and subsequently patatinlike phospholipases have been found in pro- and eukaryotes [15]. The patatin domain contains an active site with
a serine-aspartate catalytic dyad and an oxyanion hole
that stabilizes the enzyme-substrate transition state [16].
The patatin domain shares a conserved core module with
mammalian lipases, where the nucleophilic serine is
located in a tight turn between a β-sheet and an α-helix in
a well conserved β-β-α-β core structure [17] which is also
present in, e.g., human cytosolic phospholipase A2 [18].

Yolk mobilization to the embryo proper is mediated by
the endodermal endothelial cells of the extraembryonic
yolk sac enclosing the yolk during embryogenesis. These
cells take up VLDL from the adjacent oocytic yolk via
receptor-mediated endocytosis, degrade the particles in
lysosomes, and de novo synthesize and secrete lipoproteins into the embryonic circulation. The yolk sac-derived
VLDL particles subsequently serve as a source of lipid
components and of important nutrients in embryo development [7]. Thus, we can define four crucial steps for the
ultimate utilization of lipids by the chicken embryo.
These steps are, in temporal order: i) massive hormonal
induction of yolk precursor synthesis in the maternal
liver; ii) oocyte-directed receptor-mediated transport of
yolk precursors and their limited proteolysis to form yolk;
iii) mobilization of yolk components, mainly lipoproteins, via the yolk sac tissue into the embryonic circulation; and iv) finally, lipid utilization by the tissues of the
developing embryo.

Results

The flux of lipid components derived from lipid-carrying
macromolecules, from the adult to the yolk, as well as
from yolk to the embryo, presumably requires a large
number of proteins including a set of lipid hydrolases and
regulatory proteins. However, with the exception of the

This report provides the first identification, sequence
information, and expression profiling of PNPLAs and the
associated activator protein (CGI-58) in the chicken. We
propose that these newly identified proteins function in
processes controlling the distribution and utilization of
lipid components within the hepato-oocyte-embryo axis
of the chicken.

Identification and sequencing of novel chicken genes
To identify novel chicken patatin-like lipases, and the
PNPLA2/ATGL-activating protein CGI-58, the draft
chicken genomic database was queried using sequences
from the human orthologs. The nomenclature of the
human PNPLAs as suggested by Wilson et al. [19] is
adopted throughout this text. PCR was performed to
amplify the identified sequences using chicken adipose
tissue cDNA as template. The resulting DNA fragments
were cloned and sequenced. By this approach we obtained
the full-length cDNA clones from the chicken genes corresponding to PNPLA2/ATGL, PNPLA4, PNPLA8, PNPLA9,
PNPLA7, and CGI-58. In addition, we were able to clone
partial cDNAs from PNPLA1, PNPLA3, and PNPLA6. The
mRNA sequences of the putative chicken PNPLAs and
CGI-58 were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers EU419873 (CGI-58), EU419874 (PNPLA2/ATGL),
EU419875 (PNPLA3), EU419876 (PNPLA1), EU419877
(PNPLA4), EU419878 (PNPLA8), EU419879 (PNPLA9),
EU419880 (PNPLA6), and EU419881 (PNPLA7).

The data concerning the newly identified chicken cDNAs
and proteins are summarized, together with the available
information on human orthologs, in Table 1 (for the

Activation of

[22]

The currently known synonyms for all gene products are listed under Name(s). Chromosomal locations of the genes, size of the cDNAs and
proteins (where "?" indicates partial avian sequence), location of the patatin-domain within the proteins, % identities between the chicken and
human proteins ("~" is used in cases where partial avian sequence is available), accession numbers of the mRNAs [64], and functions of the proteins
where known (functional data from other species are also shown here), are listed with the relevant references. Note that information on the avian
PNPLA5 could not be obtained, as described in the text.

sequences, see Additional file1). It is apparent that the
sizes of the predicted proteins, where full-length clones
could be obtained, are very similar to the human proteins,
lending support to the assigned designations of the galline
lipases. The location of the patatin-like domain within the
protein structures predicted from the cloned sequences is
shown in Figure 1. In PNPLAs 1–4, the patatin domain is
in the N-terminal region, while in PNPLAs 6–9 it is
located towards the C-terminus. We were unable to
sequence the cDNA encoding the entire patatin domain of
PNPLA3, but the high degree of similarity of the identified
partial cDNA sequence with that of human PNPLA3[10]
indicates the presence of the avian gene on chicken chromosome 1. The other chicken genes were found on chromosomes 5 (PNPLA2/ATGL), 1 (PNPLA4, -8, and -9), 17
(PNPLA7), 26 (PNPLA1), and 2 (CGI-58). PNPLA6 was
cloned from an unidentified chromosome. The amino
acid alignment of the patatin domains of the eight
chicken PNPLAs is shown in Figure 2. The sequence identity among the domains is low, but importantly, the active
site motifs are well conserved. On the other hand, the
high levels of identity with the human orthologs support
the notion that the chicken enzymes identified here have
important physiological roles.
PNPLA2/ATGL (also called desnutrin, iPLA2ζ, or TTS-2) is
the key enzyme for the generation of diglycerides from TG
[12,13], and is functionally conserved from yeast to man
[20,21]. The enzyme is activated by the protein termed
"comparative gene identification 58" (CGI-58, also
known as ABHD5) [22]. Deficiency of CGI-58 in man
leads to a rare autosomal recessive disease of lipid metab-

olism, Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (also called neutral
lipid storage disease with ichthyosis; OMIM 275630),
characterized by the presence of abnormally large
amounts of TG-rich lipid droplets in many tissues [23,24].
Here, we determined that the chicken CGI-58 protein is
79% identical to the human ortholog, the amino acid res-

Patatin domain amino acid sequence alignment of chicken PNPLAs
Patatin domain amino acid sequence alignment of chicken PNPLAs. Chicken patatin domains were aligned using
ClustalW2. Overall, the sequences show little conservation. The active-site motifs, however, are well conserved (shown in red,
as in Figure 1). The lipase consensus motif with the catalytic serine, GXSXG, is fully conserved. In addition, the active site
aspartate is fully conserved within the consensus DGG-motif. These catalytic dyad residues are indicated by triangles. The
valine in the oxyanion hole (the consensus sequence of the motif, (G/A)XGXXG, is indicated by the superscript rectangle) of
chicken PNPLA1 corresponds to a serine in the human ortholog. The non-conserved serine (instead of glycine) of the
PNPLA4-oxyanion hole is also present in the rat ortholog. The unidentified N-terminal part of PNPLA3 is indicated with
blanks. Identical amino acids in all 8 proteins are marked with an asterisk (*), conservative substitutions with a colon (:), and
semi-conservative substitutions with a period (.).

idues critical for the activation of PNPLA2/ATGL [22], and
the putative lipase motif are fully conserved.
PNPLA3 (also known as adiponutrin or iPLA2ε) was
shown to behave differently from PNPLA2/ATGL with
respect to regulation and cellular localization [11,25,26].
PNPLA3 is strongly suppressed upon fasting, but
PNPLA2/ATGL expression is increased. Intracellularly,
PNPLA3 localizes to membranes, whereas PNPLA2/ATGL
is cytosolic.
The human PNPLA family member PNPLA1 has not been
fully cloned nor its function studied [11,19]. We were
unable to obtain the full-length clone of chicken PNPLA1
cDNA, and PCR with several primer pairs was unsuccessful; however, sequence encoding the patatin domain
could be obtained. Finally, we could not find any ESTs relevant to PNPLA1 in the chicken EST-databases [27,28].
Equally, we could not obtain evidence for the existence of
PNPLA5 (also termed GS2-like) in the chicken, since the
chicken sequence databases available contain no DNA or
protein sequence similar to the human or other known
orthologs. Immunoprecipitated human PNPLA5 showed
lipase activity, and when overexpressed it functioned to
decrease intracellular TGs [11].
PNPLA4, also called gene sequence 2 (GS2) or iPLA2η,
was demonstrated to be expressed in essentially all
human tissues and to lipolyze TGs [10]. To date, a murine
PNPLA4 ortholog has not been reported.

and insulin down-regulates the mouse enzyme, which
predominates in testes, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and
adipose tissue [39]. The primary sequences of PNPLA6
and -7 have a high degree of identity; their similar features
indicate conserved functions. PNPLA7 was suggested to
have NTE-related esterase activity [40,41], whereas a more
recent study [39] showed that PNPLA7 is a lysophospholipase.
Based on the above results, particularly related to the patatin domains, we analyzed whether the avian homologs
also cluster in highly related subgroups, as was reported
for the mammalian PNPLAs [19]. The phylogenetic tree
shown in Figure 3 indicates that the relationships between
the patatin domains of chicken PNPLA2/ATGL, PNPLA1,
-3 and -4 are such that they form a distinct subfamily.
While in man, PNPLAs 5 and 4 also belong to this family
[19], a chicken PNPLA5 homologue could not be identified. A separate subfamily consists of PNPLA6 and -7, and
another is made up of PNPLA8 and -9, again in analogy
similar to the situation in man [19]. Importantly, the phylogenetic tree generated by analysis of the patatin domain
sequences is in agreement with the sizes of the entire proteins and the position of the patatin domains within them
(cf. Figures 1 and 3). Furthermore, the residues within the
oxyanion hole and the motifs containing the catalytic serine are more highly conserved within the individual
(sub)families than between them (Figure 2).
An alignment of the core modules of galline and human
PNPLAs is shown in Figure 4. Within the PNPLA super-

Of the two reportedly unique members of the human
patatin-like family [19], PNPLA8 (iPLA2γ) is ubiquitously
expressed at moderate levels and reported to be transiently upregulated during early differentiation of human
adipocytes. The other lipase in this group, PNPLA9, is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and brain, and is
upregulated late during adipocyte differentiation [19].
Endogenous PNPLA9 purified from Chinese hamster
ovary cells hydrolyzes dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine,
and the ankyrin repeats are required for enzyme activity
[29].
PNPLA6 (also known as neuropathy target esterase, NTE)
is expressed, e.g., in human blood lymphocytes [30] and
murine brain [31] and plays a role in membrane lipid
homeostasis [32,33]. PNPLA6 was suggested to be
involved in a cell-signaling pathway controlling interactions between neurons and glial cells in the developing
nervous system [34]. Human [34,35], murine [36,37],
and galline [34,38] PNPLA6 were thoroughly studied in
relation to their organophosphate-induced inactivation
and neuronal degeneration. Finally, rat PNPLA7 (also
known as NTE-related esterase or NRE), is highly
expressed in prostate, pancreas, and adipose tissue [19],

PNPLAs 1–4 form a subfamily. PNPLA6 and PNPLA7 also
form a subfamily, as do PNPLA8 and PNPLA9. The patatin
domains of PNPLA2 and PNPLA3 are 68% identical, of
PNPLA1 and PNPLA2 51%, of PNPLA1 and PNPLA3 55%, of
PNPLA1 and 4 35%, of PNPLA2 and PNPLA4 37%, of
PNPLA3 and PNPLA4 40%, of PNPLA8 and PNPLA9 31%,
and of PNPLA6 and PNPLA7 76%. Plant patatin was used as
an out-group.

family as now known in these two species (Figure 4), the
sequences in the vicinity of the active site motifs are not
well conserved, with the exception of the presence of
hydrophobic residues in nonvariant positions (indicated
in Figure 4). In contrast, the active site motifs are well conserved within subfamilies of the two animal kingdoms.
Finally, in all human and galline orthologous PNPLAs,
the lengths of the stretches separating the active site motifs
are identical.
Expression profiling
To analyze the tissue expression profiles of the above
described PNPLAs, as well as of CGI-58, we measured their
mRNA concentrations in 21 chicken tissues or cell types
by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) (Figures 5 and 6).
The results show that in tissues highest expression levels

3 to 9.29e-2. PNPLA2/ATGL and its obligatory co-factor,
CGI-58, show relatively high levels, and are expressed predominantly in adipose tissue. High expression levels of
one or both of these genes were also measured in liver,
brain, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, and skin, in addition
to yolk sac and testis. The expression patterns of PNPLA7
and PNPLA8 resemble each other, as do those of PNPLA6
and PNPLA9. Testis, skeletal muscle, and heart express
high levels of PNPLA7 and -8, whereas PNPLA6 and -9
transcript levels are high in brain and heart. PNPLA3
expression is predominant in skeletal muscle, that of
PNPLA4 in testis. In the extraembryonic yolk sac, in addition to PNPLA2/ATGL, PNPLA7 is expressed at high level.
This suggests that at least these two enzymes may perform
functions in the yolk sac to mobilize lipid-derived nutrients [7] for utilization by the growing embryo. In Figure 7

Comparison of the conserved human and chicken patatin domain core modules
Comparison of the conserved human and chicken patatin domain core modules. The GenBank accession numbers
for the chicken and human sequences are provided in Table 1. The identities between full-length patatin domains of the human
and chicken PNPLA proteins are for PNPLA1, 56%; PNPLA2, 82%; PNPLA4, 74%; PNPLA6, 88%; PNPLA7, 81%; PNPLA8, 84%;
PNPLA9, 74%. The partially identified patatin domain of chicken PNPLA3 is 62% identical with the human ortholog. The numbers in brackets between the active site motifs (in red) represent amino acids that are not shown in the alignment. The numbers behind the sequences show the final positions of the displayed sequences with regard to the full-length amino acid
sequence. Below the sequences, the triangle indicates the location of the nucleophilic serine, the rectangle indicates the location of the oxyanion hole motif, and dots mark the nonvariant positions of predominantly hydrophobic residues. The 3 open
arrows indicate regions folded as β-strands, and the cylinder indicates the region folded as α-helix in the plant (Solanum cardiophyllum) patatin crystal structure (ProteinDataBank entry 1OXW). The positions of these motifs relative to the nucleophilic
serine, which is located in a tight turn, are indicated by the subscript numbers.

Figure 5
mRNA expression profiles of chicken PNPLAs and CGI-58
mRNA expression profiles of chicken PNPLAs and CGI-58. Gene-specific primers were used to determine the expression profiles of the avian PNPLAs and CGI-58. Each chicken gene was analyzed twice independently using the LightCycler 480
system. Error bars represent the observed standard deviation. The relative expression values were scaled to a range of 0–10.
The values shown were calculated using β-actin as the housekeeping gene. For each gene, the highest relative mRNA concentration is shown next to the column representing the corresponding source. Abbreviations: Adip., white adipose tissue; YS,

are presented as a heat map to facilitate the evaluation of
the relative transcript levels. Generally, in small white and
small yellow follicles (containing oocytes which have not
yet entered the rapid growth phase; see Methods for
details), the expression levels of the genes analyzed are
low, and as the oocytes grow, the expression level, particularly of PNPLA6, appears to increase in the granulosa
cells (Figures 6 and 7; GC F3 to GC F1). In tissues of adult
animals, the peak expression levels are seen in white adipose tissue (PNPLA2/ATGL and CGI-58), brain (PNPLA9),
testis (PNPLA8 and PNPLA4), heart (PNPLA6), and skeletal muscle (PNPLA7 and PNPLA3). In addition, high levels compared with most other tissues are present in
skeletal muscle (CGI-58, PNPLA8, -9, and -4), heart
(PNPLA8, and -9), brain (PNPLA6), liver (PNPLA3), testis

(PNPLA3), skin (PNPLA3), F1 granulosa cells (PNPLA4),
and adrenal gland (PNPLA4).
In silico characterization
The avian proteins (except PNPLA3, due to the incomplete sequence information) were analyzed using in silico
methods to characterize their properties in more detail.
PNPLA2/ATGL contains a predicted nuclear localization
signal (VKKAKKKL) at residues 382–389 (the corresponding sequence in human PNPLA2, VMRAKRKL, is not predicted as nuclear localization signal) PNPLA1, -6, -7, -8,
and -9 have one or more predicted tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites. Both PNPLA6 and PNPLA7 contain two
putative cyclic nucleotide binding sites indicating that
they may be regulated by either cAMP or cGMP. Similar to
its human orthologue, chicken PNPLA9 contains several

ankyrin repeats, suggesting the potential for protein-protein interactions. The structures of CGI-58 and of all
PNPLAs except PNPLA8 are predicted to be globular. Of
the fully cloned PNPLAs (PNPLA2/ATGL, PNPLA4, -7, -8,
and -9), only PNPLA4 is predicted to contain a signal peptide. PNPLAs 4 and -7 are predicted to contain transmembrane domains at residues 7–26 and 31–53, respectively.
Human PNPLA6 was not predicted to contain a membrane spanning domain, but biochemical evidence suggests that its catalytic domain is associated with
membranes in neurons [42]. Based on the almost complete identity of the core module sequence to that of
human PNPLA6 (Figure 4), this may also be the case for
the chicken enzyme. N-glycosylation sites are found in
each of the proteins; within both PNPLA2/ATGL and
PNPLA4, one N-glycosylation site is located at the N-terminal boundary of the patatin domain, and in PNPLA9 it
is close to the C-terminal boundary, respectively.

Discussion
This is the first study providing insights into the avian
patatin domain-containing family of proteins whose
mammalian orthologs are known to be lipases that act in
several critical physiological processes. The significant
degree of sequence conservation for the proposed PNPLAs
and CGI-58 proteins in chicken to those of known human
proteins lends strong support to the notion that these proteins play critical roles in avian lipid biology. While the
catalytic mechanism of most lipases proceeds through the
nucleophilic attack of a serine-histidine-aspartate triad
[17] and is reminiscent of serine proteases, the patatin
family of enzymes operates via a serine-aspartate dyad.
The serine of this dyad is located in a so-called nucleophilic elbow, which itself is part of a region suggested by
Schneider et al. [17] to represent an ancestral sequence
module, i.e., one found in both the patatin family (harboring a catalytic dyad) and other lipases, general esterases, and (lyso)phospholipases (operating via a triad).
This sequence module, consisting of 50–70 residues form-

bottom of a funnel [18]. The surface of this funnel is predominantly hydrophobic so as to allow access of fatty acid
moieties of substrates. The two glycines in the lipase motif
(GXSXG) are structurally essential for the tight turn of the
nucleophilic elbow.

ing the β-2 - β-1 - α+1 - β+1 core (Figure 4), is sometimes
interrupted by inserts that may have arisen during evolution [17]. The characteristic nucleophilic elbow of general
esterases is located in the loop between the end of the second β-strand and the start of the α-helix. As shown in Figure 4, the overall structure of the ancestral module clearly
is present in the chicken's patatin-like lipases, and the
insert lengths are identical between the human and
chicken homologue in each of the seven members for
which this information could be obtained. Importantly,
the active site residues are highly conserved. In addition,
in the primary sequence they are flanked by hydrophilic
regions.
As revealed by crystal structural analysis, the active site serine-aspartate dyad of the plant patatin [16] and human
cytosolic phospholipase A2 is located in a deep cleft at the

As in the murine protein, the protein predicted for the
chicken PNPLA2/ATGL contains a potential lipid binding
site at residues 311–395 [43]. Importantly, this lipid binding site, unlike other portions of the protein, is as highly
conserved as the patatin-like domain. A putative nuclear
localization signal (NLS) (predicted at residues 382–389
in the avian sequence) is absent from the human protein,
however, and none of the other known PNPLAs are predicted to harbor any NLS; thus, the significance of this
observation remains unclear. In man, deficiency of
PNPLA2/ATGL causes neutral lipid storage disease with
myopathy (OMIM 610717) [44]. Genetic variations
within the human PNPLA2/ATGL gene influence fasting
free fatty acid and glucose levels as well as the risk to
develop type 2 diabetes [45]. To date, five mutations in
human PNPLA2/ATGL have been reported that cause neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy. One is a mutation in which a tetranucleotide duplication leads to a
premature truncation of the patatin domain [46]. Fischer
et al. [44] reported three patients with milder phenotypes,
and described four mutant alleles. Three of the mutations
are predicted to lead to truncated PNPLA2/ATGL proteins
with intact patatin domains, and the fourth leads to a single amino acid substitution (P195L). The affected proline
is conserved in human PNPLAs 1–5 and also in chicken
PNPLAs 1–4, further indicating an important structural
role of the residue.
CGI-58, an activator of PNPLA2/ATGL, belongs to the
esterase/thioesterase/lipase subfamily of proteins which
are structurally characterized by the presence of α/βhydrolase folds. Its interaction with PNPLA2/ATGL is
required for TG hydrolysis [22]. An intrinsic lipolytic
activity of CGI-58 could not be demonstrated to date [22];
however, CGI-58 may couple lipolytic degradation of
cytoplasmic TG to oxidation and packaging into TG-rich
lipoproteins for secretion in hepatoma cells [47]. CGI-58
reversibly binds to lipid droplets via perilipin A in the
basal state [48,49], whereas PNPLA2/ATGL does not interact with perilipin A [50]. During hormone-stimulated
lipolysis, perilipin A phosphorylation by protein kinase A
rapidly decreases the interaction between CGI-58 and perilipin A; thus, perilipin A indirectly controls PNPLA2/
ATGL activity [50]. The important role of CGI-58 in lipase
activation is further underscored by the fact that deficiency of CGI-58 in man [23,24] leads to Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, characterized by the presence of
abnormally large amounts of TG-rich lipid droplets in
many tissues.

As in mammals, the predominant expression of chicken
PNPLA2/ATGL and CGI-58 in adipose tissue is compatible with the high demand on TG-lipolysis in this tissue. In
the chicken, certain tissues such as liver, brain, kidney,
heart, skeletal muscle, and skin also show high PNPLA2/
ATGL and CGI-58 mRNA abundances, largely in concordance with the sites of TG accumulation in PNPLA2/ATGL
deficient patients [44]. In addition, the yolk sac of the
chicken embryo shows similarly high mRNA abundances
of these genes as well as that of PNPLA7. These observations suggest key roles for the gene products in embryonic
yolk mobilization and utilization. PNPLA2/ATGL has
been shown to be the main target for activation by CGI-58
[22]. Differences between PNPLA2/ATGL and CGI-58
expression levels may indicate that CGI-58 possibly activates other lipases as well; the mRNA expression level differences might not reflect the protein levels, however, as
reported for e.g., subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue
of obese human subjects [51]. In addition, Schweiger et al.
suggested that mammalian PNPLA2/ATGL likely represents the only lipase activated by CGI-58 [52]. In this context, chicken CGI-58 transcript levels are high in skeletal
muscle, where PNPLA3, -7, and -8 also are highly
expressed, whereas human PNPLA3 is reported to be
expressed exclusively in adipose tissue [44].
The high levels of PNPLA6 and -9 in the brain and of
PNPLA4 in testis, respectively, may indicate tissue specific
role(s) of these enzymes. In this respect, PNPLA6 is inhibited by organophosphate compounds, leading to delayed
neuropathy in man [34] and chicken [31]. Indeed, adult
hens are usually used as the animal model for experimental studies of organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN). The human, murine, and galline PNPLA6s
have been reported to hydrolyze a number of lysophospholipids [35-37]. Recently, Chang et al. reported partial
cloning of the chicken PNPLA6 cDNA [53]. These authors
described a novel 3' cDNA sequence to which we add new
5' sequence information and confirm the remaining
cDNA sequence reported by them. Human [42] and
chicken PNPLA6 do not appear to operate through a conventional catalytic triad, as both proteins contain two
aspartate residues, rather than a histidine residue, in addition to the nucleophilic serine. It is interesting to note that
while PNPLA6 and -7 are a pair forming one patatin subfamily, and PNPLA8 and -9 form another (cf. Figure 4),
expression levels of PNPLA6 and -9 are high in brain, and
those of PNPLA7 and -8 in skeletal muscle. This may point
to evolution of the two pairs towards performing nonredundant functions in different tissues. In heart, coexpression of PNPLAs 6–9 may indicate the particularly
high and complex energy demand of different classes of
myocytes.

Currently, we have no evidence that PNPLA5 exists in
chicken. We failed to detect any DNA or protein sequence
similar to the human or other known orthologs in the
chicken sequence databases available. Likewise, we could
not find any relevant ESTs in the available chicken ESTdatabases [27,28]. Lake et al. [11] used qPCR to show that
PNPLA5 mRNA abundance was greatest in lung, epididymal fat, and brown adipose tissue, but that these expression levels were also ~10000-fold lower than those of
PNPLA2/ATGL or PNPLA3 in these same tissues, and
undetectable by Northern-blotting [11]. PNPLA5 was
induced in the liver of ob/ob mice, indicating that the regulation of PNPLA5 resembles that of genes involved in
hepatic lipogenesis rather than lipolysis [11]. However, it
was undetectable in livers of wild-type C57BI/6J mice,
and the human ortholog was found almost exclusively in
brain [19]. In this context, the human PNPLA3, PNPLA5
and PNPLA9 loci are syntenic on human chromosome
22q13, and the galline PNPLA3 and PNPLA9 loci on chromosome 1. Further studies are required to clarify whether
galline PNPLA5 is syntenic with PNPLA3 and PNPLA9,
but lies in a region with lacking sequence information, or
is in fact absent from the entire chicken genome. Finally,
our results on galline PNPLA1 are in line with the results
obtained with PNPLA1 from man [22] and mouse [11] in
that only partial cDNA sequence could be obtained, and
attempts to generate qPCR products, even with several sets
of primers, failed. Taken together, the available data suggest that PNPLA1 may not be expressed at detectable levels in any of the three species.
Overall, we note that the expression patterns of several
members of the patatin-like lipase family vary significantly in the different species studied to date. For instance,
PNPLA3 mRNA levels are high in foetal and adult human
liver [11], but not in murine liver (Figure 2B in [11]), and
is predicted to be high in chicken skeletal muscle (Figure
6), a tissue which in the mouse does not express the
enzyme [11]. PNPLA4 shows considerable expression in
human heart and skeletal muscle [11], whereas its expression is moderate in chicken heart and skeletal muscle and
greatest in the testis (Figure 6). Furthermore, PNPLA5
expression is high in human brain [11], but not in murine
brain [11], whereas expression is high in the lung of mice
[11], but not of man [11]. On the other hand, a notable
exception to these examples is PNPLA2/ATGL, whose
expression in adipose tissue consistently prevails over that
in other tissues in all species. Since preliminary results (J.
Schatte and A. Hermetter, personal communication) indicate that chicken PNPLA2/ATGL indeed possesses TGlipase activity that is enhanced by CGI-58, it is likely that
also the other PNPLA genes have important in-vivo roles in
the chicken. Another tissue with significant expression of
PNPLA2/ATGL (and of PNPLA7) is the yolk sac of the
avian embryo, where lipases likely have significant func-

tions in the mobilization of lipid components from yolk
for utilization by the embryo. In this context, Kienesberger et al. [39] have provided strong evidence that
murine PNPLA7 is a lysophospholipase that is regulated
by nutritional status and insulin.
Major transformations in yolk lipid composition occur
during the transport across the yolk sac, an extraembryonic structure consisting of an outer mesoderm of flattened support cells and an inner layer of endodermal
endothelial cells (EECs). The EECs are responsible for
yolk absorption and secretion of de novo synthesized lipids and lipoproteins into capillaries emanating from villi
on the basal surface of the EECs [5]. Thus, the chick
embryo's yolk sac functions in lipid transport highly analogous to the mammalian placenta in terms of nutrient
provision to the embryo, and/or to the processes of intestinal lipid absorption and secretion. Following uptake of
lipids into the yolk sac, almost all unesterified yolk cholesterol (80% of total cholesterol) is esterified, which then
amounts to 81% of the total cholesterol in the yolk sac.
One striking observation associated with lipid metabolism in the avian embryo is that the proportions of 20:4n6 and 22:6n-3 fatty acids progressively increase during
transit from yolk to the embryonic plasma. Lipolytic and
re-esterification processes involving lipases lead to the
almost exclusive presence of 22:6n-3 fatty acid in the
phospholipid fraction of yolk, but interestingly, 22:6n-3
is subsequently present in the embryonic plasma's TGrich lipoproteins, which originate in the EECs. There is an
almost 60-fold enrichment of 22:6n-3 from yolk TG to
plasma TG [54]; 20:4n-6 preferentially distributes to
phospholipids in yolk and embryonic plasma, with much
smaller changes in concentrations between the fractions
than observed for 22:6n-3. These and other observations
[5] are compatible with the involvement of multiple
hydrolytic activities in cholesterol esterification, desaturation/elongation reactions, translocation of 22:6n-3 from
phospholipids to TG, and in the overall conversion of
yolk lipid components to plasma lipoproteins that supply
the developing embryonic organs via specific uptake
mechanisms.
Future studies will address the detailed temporal expression patterns of the patatin-like putative lipases identified,
and of other already known extracellular lipases and cofactors, in the yolk sac and the embryonic tissues during
embryonic development. Knowledge about the exact invivo functions of these enzymes in any system is still
sparse. Based on the information gained here, it is reasonable to anticipate important insights of general relevance
through exploitation of the advantages of the chick system
[55,56].

Conclusion
Data mining of the draft genome of Gallus gallus combined with cDNA cloning and tissue expression analysis
by quantitative PCR have resulted in the first identification of hitherto unknown putative lipolytic enzymes in
this powerful experimental system. Comparison of findings in birds, which split from the mammalian lineage
about 310 million years ago, with those in mammals provides additional analytical power. This fact is demonstrated here for the gene family encoding patatin domaincontaining proteins which putatively function as lipases.
Future studies in the chicken may reveal important features shared by this gene family and their products in different animal phyla.

Methods
Animals and tissue samples
Derco white laying hens (30–40 weeks old) and roosters
were purchased from Heindl Co. (Vienna, Austria) and
maintained on layer's mash with free access to water and
feed under a daily light period of 14 h. Fertilized chicken
eggs were incubated under standard conditions for temperature (38°C) and humidity (70%). The eggs were
removed from the incubator after 11 days of incubation,
and the shell was cut to expose the yolk sac membrane.
The yolk sac membranes were excised and washed with
ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently used for RNA extraction as described below. The
preovulatory small white (less than 5-mm diameter, without yolk) and small yellow follicles (5–12-mm diameter,
with yolk) form a pool from which the hierarchical follicles (F1-F7) develop. The F1 follicle is the largest and most
mature follicle (to be ovulated on collection day), while
higher numbered follicles are progressively smaller and
less mature. Granulosa cells were isolated from F5 – F1
follicles and washed with PBS [57]. Other chicken tissue
samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after
collection of samples or used for RNA extraction. White
adipose tissue was obtained from the abdominal cavity.
Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and sequencing
Chicken total RNA was extracted from tissue using Nucleospin RNA II -kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to instructions from manufacturer. When tissue samples were not
immediately used for RNA extraction, lysis buffer with
chaotropic ions was added prior to freezing to stabilize
RNA. All tissues used were collected from mature hens
except testis, which was from mature roosters. Yolk sac
and granulosa cells were prepared as described above. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Oligo(dT)10 primer. Patatin-like lipase genes were searched for in the
draft chicken genomic sequence database [58]. Several
primer pairs were designed to produce overlapping fragments, and finally the pairs shown in Table 2 were used to

clone the indicated cDNAs. PCR amplification was performed with a T3000 Thermocycler (Biometra) with
touch-down program using Phusion Hot Start(Finnzymes), DyNAzyme EXT- (Finnzymes), or PfuTurbo
Cx Hotstart -(Stratagene) DNA polymerase with chicken
adipose tissue cDNA as template. In touch-down PCR, the
following conditions were used during the amplification
cycles: 3 cycles at annealing temperature 3°C above the
melting temperature of the primer with lower value; 3
cycles at the melting temperature; 34 cycles at 3°C below
the melting temperature. Other steps of the PCR were as
follows: +95°C for 2 min; cycles: +95°C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s, +72°C for 1 min/kb; +72°C for 10 min. The
amplified products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (1%) and stained with ethidium bromide. Subsequently, the PCR product was excised from the gel and
DNA was purified with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). If Phusion or PfuTurbo polymerase was used in the
PCR, a tailing reaction was performed. 7 μl purified PCR
product was incubated for 30 min at +70°C with 1 μl2
mM dATP, 1 μl 10× PCR buffer, and 1 μl (1 U/ml) Taq
DNA polymerase (Roche). Next, the DNA was cloned into
the pCR2.1 TOPO -vector with the TOPO TA Cloning -kit
(Invitrogen), transformed into the chemically competent
TOP10F E. coli bacterial strain (Invitrogen), and plated on
Luria-Bertani plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and
40 μg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactoside). Insert-containing bacterial clones were screened
with colony PCR using the above described PCR conditions and primers. Positive clones were incubated overnight +37°C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/
ml ampicillin, and plasmid DNA was purified with Fast-

Plasmid Mini -kit (Eppendorf). DNA sequencing was performed by VBC-Biotech Service GmbH (Vienna, Austria).
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The mRNA sequences of the chicken PNPLAs and CGI-58
were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers:
EU419873 for CGI-58, EU419874 for PNPLA2/ATGL,
EU419875 for PNPLA3, EU419876 for PNPLA1,
EU419877 for PNPLA4, EU419878 for PNPLA8,
EU419879 for PNPLA9, EU419880 for PNPLA6, and
EU419881 for PNPLA7.
Quantitative real time PCR
Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was performed with
the LightCycler 480 system (Roche) using LightCycler
FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I -kit (Roche) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. The qPCR conditions
were as follows: +98°C for 10 min; 45 amplification
cycles at +98°C for 10 s, annealing for 10 s (5°C above
melting temperature of the primer with lower value),
elongation at +72°C for 14 to 17 s (25 bp/s + 2 s), measurement of fluorescence at +79–91°C for 1 s (see Table 3).
After amplification, melting curve analysis was performed
as follows: +98°C for 10 s; annealing temperature for 20
s; continuous temperature gradient to +98°C with 5
acquisitions/s. The tissue cDNA samples (from adult animals and the indicated tissues and cells) were diluted 1/
20 with water, and the same cDNA dilution was used for
all qPCR reactions. A fresh 10-1 to 10-9 serial dilution was
prepared from each target gene to be analyzed starting
from the 1/20 dilution of a purified PCR product, and
every gene was measured twice independently with dupli-

cate samples. From the serial dilution, 10-4 to 10-8 dilutions were used as an internal standard. As housekeeping
genes, we measured the mRNA expression levels of
chicken β-actin, 5-aminolevuline synthase (ALAS), and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). The qPCR primers used
are shown in Table 3. In qPCR, every gene had PCR efficiencies ranging from 1.926 to 1.972, as calculated from
the internal standard; thus, no efficiency correlation was
performed. The LightCycler 480 Software (release
1.1.0.0520) with absolute quantification was used to calculate the concentrations and standard deviations of the
samples. The concentration of the target gene was divided
by the concentration of the housekeeping gene thus showing the relative expression of the mRNA in the tissue. This
calculation was performed for all tissues analyzed. Standard deviations were calculated by multiplying the
obtained relative value with the standard deviation of the
target. The resulting relative and standard deviation values
were scaled to a range of 0–10 including the standard
deviations. Quantitative PCR was not successful with
PNPLA1. Specificity of the amplification reactions was
confirmed by sequencing of the qPCR products.
