Abstract
Background: Prevalence of HIV-1 non-B subtypes has increased overtime in patients diagnosed at the
time of primary infection (PHI) in France. Our objective was to characterize in detail non-B strains which
could not be genetically classified into the known subtypes/Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs).
Methods: Among 744 patients enrolled in the ANRS PRIMO Cohort since 1996, 176 (23.7%) were
infected with HIV-1 non-B strains. The subtype/CRF could not be identified in RT for 15 (2%). The V3-V5
env region was sequenced and 3 strains (04FR-KZS, 06FR-CRN, 04FR-AUK) were full-length sequenced.
Phylogenetic and bootscan analyses were used to characterize the mosaic structures.
Results: Among V3-V5 sequences, 6 were divergent A, 2 distantly related to E or D, 2 C, 1 B and 2
remained unclassified. 04FR-KZS, isolated in a Congolese woman infected in France, clustered with 2
previously described viruses from the Democratic Republic of Congo. They represent CRF27_cpx
involving A/E/G/H/J/K/U subtypes. 06FR-CRN, isolated in a homosexual Caucasian patient, was a B/C/U
recombinant involving a Brazilian C strain. 04FR-AUK, isolated in a Congolese patient infected in France,
was a A/K/CRF09/U recombinant clustering from gag to vif with HIV-1 MAL. Others PHI were further
observed in 2006–2007 with 1 KZS and 5 CRN-like viruses, suggesting their spread in France.
Conclusion: This study illustrates the increasing HIV-1 diversity in France associating new (06FR-CRN)
and old (CRF27_cpx and "MAL-like" 04FR-AUK) strains, which are rare in their region of origin but may
have a possible founder effect in France. Our results strengthen the French guidelines recommending viroepidemiological surveillance of HIV-1 diversity.

Background
Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) viruses
are characterized by extensive genetic diversity driven by
the error-prone reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme in the
context of rapid viral turn-over and its highly recombigenic nature [1,2]. HIV-1 variants are classified in three
major phylogenetic groups: M (main), O (outlier) and N
(non-M/non-O) each corresponding to independent
cross-species transmissions with SIVs from wild chimpanzees and/or gorillas in West Central Africa [3]. Only group
M viruses have spread across Africa and to all other continents. Group M can be further subdivided into subtypes
(A-D, F-H, J-K) and sub-subtypes (A1-A4, F1-F2). In addition an increasing number of Circulating Recombinant
Forms (CRFs, CRF01-CRF37) and many Unique Recombinants Forms (URFs) have also been described [4-6]. The
geographic distribution of the different HIV-1 M variants
is very heterogeneous and specific distributions of the various subtypes are seen among the different continents,
even from country to country or within countries [7]. In
France, subtype B predominates, like in other European
countries and in North America, but the overall prevalence of non-B strains is increasing, also among French
Caucasian individuals [8,9]. In chronically newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections, non-B strains represented 10% of
the cases in 1998, 33% in 2001 and 50% in 2005 [10].
The distribution of HIV-1 strains circulating in France is
particular, as successive migratory flows from African
countries with French language have led to an exceptional
viral diversity, higher than in other countries where subtype B epidemic is predominant. The increasing diversity
may have implications for HIV-1 diagnosis, treatment,
drug resistance, vaccine development, transmission and
pathogenesis.
The French multicenter PRIMO Cohort study ANRS CO06
started in 1996 and contributed to the epidemiological
surveillance of viral strains acquired at the time of PHI:
the frequency of non-B strains increased from 10% in
1998–1999 to 28% in 2006 [11]. This result is similar to
the frequency described in recently infected patients
included in the European SPREAD study (20% of non-B
viruses) [12]. In the PRIMO Cohort, 15 non-B strains,
which could not be classified into any of the known subtypes or CRFs after RT phylogenetic analysis, have also
been observed since 1996. The objective of our study was
to characterize more in detail these strains. Phylogenetic
analysis of their V3-V5 env region has been performed and
3 of them were full-length sequenced, as they seemed particularly divergent.

Methods
Study population
The study population comprised 768 patients presenting
with PHI enrolled in the French PRIMO Cohort study

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/69

between November 1996 and October 2006 [13]. The
enrolment criteria were: (i) a negative or indeterminate
HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay associated with
a positive antigenemia or plama HIV RNA; (ii) a Western
blot profile compatible with ongoing seroconversion
(incomplete Western blot with an absence of antibodies
to pol proteins); or (iii) an initially negative test for HIV
antibody followed within 6 months by a positive HIV
serology. For all patients, plasma and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) samples were collected at
inclusion and stored. Subsequent viral genotypic drug
resistance testing and HIV-1 subtyping were systematically
performed.
V3-V5 env sequences
DNA was extracted from PBMCs with the QIAamp® DNA
Mini Kit (Qiagen SA, Courtaboeuf, France). Env (640 bp)
fragments were amplified by ED3/ED12 as outer and ES7/
ES8 or Env7/ED33 as inner primers [14] with the Expand
High Fidelity plus PCR System® according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). We used PCR conditions as previously
described [14]. The amplified products were purified with
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit® (Qiagen SA, Courtaboeuf,
France). Nucleotide sequences were obtained by direct
sequencing of the amplified DNA using the inner primers
and Big Dye Terminator V1.1® technology (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Electophoresis and data
collection were performed on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyser® sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA).
Full-length genome sequences
Three overlapping nested PCRs were done to obtain the
sequence of entire genomes. A fragment that included
accessory genes, the entire envelope and nef was amplified
with hpol4235 and LsiGI as outer primers (~5 kb). Gag
and pol genes were amplified with G00 and hpol4538 as
outer primers (~4.2 kb). Unintegrated circular DNA was
targeted to amplify the rest of gag and LTR with Env1 and
G00rev as outer primers (~5 kb) [15]. Several primers
were subsequently used to perform nested PCR into these
amplified fragments, as previously described [15]. PCR
and sequence primers are available upon request. The
Expand Long Template PCR System® Taq polymerase
(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was used
according to the instructions of the manufacturer and PCR
conditions were used as previously described [15]. The
amplified products were purified using a QIAquick Gel
Purification Kit®(Qiagen SA, Courtaboeuf, France) and
sequenced as described above. Sequences were obtained
for both DNA strands and contigs were assembled and
edited using the Sequence Navigator® software [16].

Phylogenetic tree analysis
Phylogenetic relationships of the RT, V3-V5 and fulllength genome sequences were estimated from sequence
comparisons with previously reported representatives of
group M subtypes and sub-subtypes. In addition to pure
subtypes, we analyzed the new strains also for their phylogenetic relationship to CRFs for which sequences are
available in the HIV database or genbank http://www.hivweb.lanl.gov. For the analysis of the 04FR-KZS and 04FRAUK viruses, isolated in patients born in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), we added reference strains of
CRFs circulating in Africa (CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG,
CRF04_cpx, CRF05_DF, CRF06_cpx, CRF09_cpx,
CRF11_cpx, CRF13_cpx, CRF18_cpx and CRF19_cpx) and
sequences from previously reported divergent strains (tentative subtype L [17], and complex URFs from Central
Africa [18,19]). For the analysis of the 06FR-CRN virus,
isolated in a Caucasian French patient and clustering with
subtype C in the V3-V5 region, we included additional
subtype B, C and D strains from different geographic areas
as well as CRFs harbouring subtype C fragments:
CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, CRF10_CD and CRF31_BC. The
env and full-length nucleotide sequences were aligned
using Clustal W (v1.7) [20] with minor manual adjustments. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the
neighbor joining method, and reliability of the branching
orders was implemented by Clustal W using the boostrap
approach. TreeView Win16 [21] was used to draw trees for
illustrations. Genetic distances were calculated using the
Kimura two-parameter method, with a transition weight
of 0.5.
Analysis for intersubtype mosaicism
To analyze the recombinant structure of the new viruses,
several additional analyses were performed. The Simplot
3.5.1 software was used to determine the percentage of
similarity between selected pairs of sequences and to calculate bootscan plots, by performing bootscanning on
parsimony trees using SEQBOOT, DNADIST (with
Kimura's two-parameter method and F84 model of maximum likelihood method, transition/transversion ratio =
2.0), NEIGHBOR and CONSENSE from the Phylip package [22]. In the similarity and bootscan plots, the new
sequences were compared with consensus sequences
(50% threshold) of the non-recombinant subtypes and
some CRF reference strains. The regions that did not cluster with any of the known subtypes were submitted to
BLAST analysis (BLASTN 2.0.6 on line; http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/BASIC_BLAST/
basic_blast.html), to see whether they are closely related
with previously described unknown fragments of other
HIV-1 strains.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/69

Nucleotide sequences
Full-length sequences of 04FR-KZS, 04FR-AUK and 06FRCRN strains were submitted to GenBank with the following accession numbers: – [GenBank:AM851091, -GenBank:EU448295 and -GenBank:EU448296], respectively.

Results
Characteristics of the study population
From 1996 to October 2006, 744 strains have been genetically characterized among the 768 patients recruited in
the PRIMO cohort. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
176 (23.7%) were HIV-1 non-B strains. Whereas the
majority of them (57%) were CRF02_AG viruses [11], 15
(2%) were not classified into the known HIV-1 subtypes
or CRFs (Figure 1a). The clinical, virological and immunological characteristics of the 15 patients at the time of their
inclusion in the cohort are summarized in the Table 1.
Among the 15 strains, two clusters of very closely related
strains (> 99% homology) were identified: 03FR-ATKL
and 03FR-JHW from 2 heterosexual partners, and 06FRCRN and 06FR-ETU among two men having sex with men
(MSM) whose PHI occurred in 2006, although diagnosed
in two different cities. V3-V5 sequences were done on the
15 unclassified samples. A total of 13 "undetermined"
strains have been amplified and sequenced: 6 clustered in
the subtype A radiation but did not form a well supported
cluster with an A sub-subtype or CRF specific subtype A
lineage. Two samples were distantly related to subtype E
or D, 2 could be classified as C, 1 as B and 2 remained
undetermined (Figure 1b).
Full-length genome sequencing of 3 HIV-1 strains
To study more in detail these divergent HIV-1 strains, we
characterized the full-length genome for 04FR-KZS, 06FRCRN and 04FR-AUK strains. They were chosen for different reasons: 04FR-KZS strongly clustered with a previously
described complex recombinant virus (97CD-KTB49
[18]); 06FR-CRN was undetermined in RT phylogenetic
analysis but strongly clustered in the subtype C in V3-V5
analysis; 04FR-AUK displayed extensive similarity in the
RT region with one of the earliest African HIV-1 strains,
MAL, previously described as an A/D/K/U recombinant
virus [23]. Moreover these 3 strains circulated in France
between 2004 and 2006. The patients infected with these
strains were diagnosed soon after infection with an acute
retroviral syndrome (estimated delay from infection: 20,
24 and 22 days, respectively). Two of them (04FR-KZS
and 06FR-CRN) presented with a very low CD4 cell count
and a high viral load; the third one (04FR-AUK) had a
moderate CD4 cell count decrease associated with a spontaneously low viral load (Table 1). The 3 new full-length
sequences were compared with representatives of all subtypes, sub-subtypes, CRFs available in the HIV database
and with other unpublished and published URFs. The
phylogenetic tree analysis (Figure 2) showed that 06FR-

Phylogenetic tree analysis of the 15 “undetermined” viruses isolated in patients enrolled at the time of primary infection
Phylogenetic tree analysis of the 15 "undetermined" viruses isolated in patients enrolled at the time of primary infection. In the phylogenetic trees, based on the RT nucleotide sequence of the 15 “undetermined” strains (a) and the
corresponding V3-V5 env region for 13 of them (b), the reference sequences were as follows: 3 references for all pure subtypes, 1 reference for 18 previously described CRF (CRF01-16 and CRF18-19), and unique recombinant MAL [23], NOGIL
[24] and 97CD-KTB49 [18] strains. Trees based on unambiguously aligned nucleotides were generated by the neighbour-joining method, and the reliability of each clustering was assessed by bootstrapping with one hundred replicates implemented by
Clustal W. The Simplot v3.5.1 performed bootscanning on NJ trees along the genome alignment by moving a 400 base pairs
window along the genome alignment with 20 base pairs increment and one hundred replicates for each phylogeny. Only bootstrap values above 70 at each of the internal branches defining a subtype are shown.

~Caucasian patient likely to have been infected in Sub-Saharian Africa.
* HIV-1 RNA viral load performed using Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor v1.5 test® (Roche diagnostic System, Alameda, CA).
§Patient whose recombinant virus has been full-length sequenced.

CRN formed a well supported cluster with subtype C. The
04FR-AUK strain did not cluster with any known sequence
but seemed to be related to the previous reported complex
recombinant strains from central African origin: MAL [23]
and NOGIL (A/K/H/U) [24] which have a common A/K/
U structure in gag-pol.
Analysis of 04FR-KZS recombinant structure
04FR-KZS formed a separate subcluster with 2 previously
characterized env subtype E isolates from DRC with a
recombinant structure different from CRF01-AE (97CDKTB49 and 02CD-LBR024) and has been recently
described as CRF27cpx, involving six different HIV-1 subtypes (A, E, G, H, J, K) and a small unclassified fragment
(Fig. 3a) [19]. The 04FR-AUK and 06FR-CRN strains were
subjected to further analysis in order to determine their
exact structure.
Analysis of 06FR-CRN recombinant structure
The bootscan analysis of 06FR-CRN (Fig. 4a) showed that
the majority of the genome is subtype C except two small
regions in pol: the first one included part of the RT gene
and clustered with subtype B; the second one (5'end of the
integrase gene) clustered with the common branch for B
and D subtypes (region 4). The 3'end of the nef gene and
LTR were subtype B. Figure 4b shows a more detailed
bootscan analysis of 06FR-CRN against 10 subtype C reference strains, isolated from different regions over the
world and illustrates that 06FR-CRN "C" regions strongly

clustered with 98BR-BR004, isolated in Brazil [25].
Despite iterative bootscan analysis including additional B
and D reference strains or with BLAST analysis, the region
4 remained undetermined. The subtype identifications of
the various genomic regions were all confirmed by phylogenetic tree analysis of the corresponding fragments (Figure 5). We included reference sequences of CRF31_BC
strains in these trees to illustrate the differences between
this previously described CRF and 06FR-CRN, which both
resulted from the recombination between a Brazilian C
strain and a B virus. Figure 3b shows the overall mosaic
structure of the new B/C/U 06FR-CRN strain.
Analysis of 04FR-AUK recombinant structure
Although subtype A and K predominate, the complexity
of the new 04FR-AUK strain was readily apparent from the
similarity plots (data not shown) and the bootscan analyses (Fig 6a). The LTR, gag, vif, vpr and nef genes and the
majority of pol and env were subtype A (regions 1, 7, 9,
11). A short region, located at the 5'end of the RT, clustered with the common branch for F1 and F2 sub-subtypes in the phylogenetic analysis although not with a
significant boostrap value (region 2). Therefore we classified this region as "undetermined" (U1), but it might represent an "F" variant. The pol gene included two regions
(regions 3 and 5) which were clearly subtype K. A small
region between them (region 4) was not well defined in
the bootscan analysis and was therefore named "undetermined" (U2). However, 04FR-AUK clustered with subtype

be considered as a divergent "K". In the 5' end of the integrase, a small region could not be clearly defined in the
bootscan and phylogenetic tree analyses and was therefore classified as undetermined (region 6 = U3). The 3'
end of the accessory gene region, including the entire vpu
gene, was subtype K (region 8). On the boostrap and sim-

ilarity plots, a 350 bp region at the 3'end of the env gene
seemed difficult to classify (region 10 = U4). To better
characterize the undetermined regions, we performed a
BLAST search. The best match (94%) was found with an
"undetermined" fragment of CRF09_cpx in region 10
only. We included in the bootscan analysis (figure 6a) of
this region CRF09 strains and subsequent phylogenetic

AUK divergence breakpoints were located in the vpr gene,
as shown in the bootscan analyses of MAL and NOGIL
(Fig. 6b and 6c). In the 3'end of the nef gene and the LTR,
NOGIL was subtype H but 04FR-AUK and MAL clustered
together again in subtype A. Overall, it can be stated that
the 5'end of the MAL/NOGIL/04FR-AUK strains have a
common parental ancestor.
To determine to what extend previously reported strains
were related to MAL, NOGIL or 04FR-AUK strains, blast
searches were done by cutting the full-length sequence
into several fragments (about 1200–1300 bp), because an
initial blast analysis with the complete genome sequence
did not provide any significant information. We identified
four strains from DRC (97CD-MBFE185, 97CD-MBS30,
02CD-KP061 and 02CD-KP097), one from Cameroon
(97CM-MP814) and one from Senegal (98SN-40HALD)
[26,27] for which partial pol sequences (1500 bp, protease
and RT) clustered with 91% bootstrap values with 04FRAUK/MAL/NOGIL and which displayed the same recombinant structure in that part of the genome as shown by
additional bootscan and simplot analysis. Some of these
strains had also been sequenced in other genomic regions
such as the V3-V5 env or p24 gag region. Similarly as for
04FR-AUK, the following strains 97CD-MBFE185, 97CDMBS30, 02CD-KP061 and 02CD-KP097 were also subtype A in the V3-V5 region, and 97CD-MBFE185, 97CDMBS30 and 97CM-MP814 were also subtype A in gag p24.
Moreover, other sequences from Gabon (97GA-G15,
97GA-ME56, 97GA-PP98, 97GA-TB64, 00GA-GAB22S,
97GA-G32, 97GA-TB45) [28], Congo (CgARV64 and
CgARV64) [29] and Senegal (97SN-1055) [30] formed a
subcluster with MAL/NOGIL/04FR-AUK supported by
78% bootstrap within subtype A. (See figures 7 and 8

Discussion
In the French PRIMO Cohort study, which has been
enrolling 744 patients presenting during PHI, 24% of the
subjects were infected by a non-B strain over the 1996–
2006 period; 2.02% (15/744) viruses could not be classified after phylogenetic analysis of the RT gene. The frequency of these unclassified strains remained stable from
1.30% in 1996–2001 to 2.51% in 2002–2006 (p = 0.3).
These viruses were all isolated in patients whose PHI
occurred in France, except for one patient (01TG-BHL)
who acquired HIV in Togo: 10 HIV infections occurred in
Caucasians. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of V3-V5
region did not allow to classify the majority of these
viruses.
In this report, we describe the full-length genome for 3
new HIV-1 non-B strains identified during PHI in France;
these strains circulate among migrants but also in the Caucasian population. The 04FR-KZS strain was isolated in a
Congolese patient whose PHI occurred in France in 2004

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/69

and has led to the recent characterization of CRF27_cpx,
involving 6 subtypes (A/E/G/H/J/K) and 1 unclassified
fragment [19]. The other representatives of this CRF,
97CD-KTB49 and 02CD-LBR024, derived from patients
in DRC, were isolated 7 and 2 years earlier respectively
among national sentinel serosurveillance studies.
06FR-CRN strain is an illustration of the increasing complexity of the global HIV-1 genetic diversity. 06FR-CRN
represents actually a new URF between subtype B and a
Brazilian subtype C. In addition, a short region, at the
5'end of the integrase gene, remained "undetermined" as it
clustered with the common branch for B and D subtypes
and could therefore not be clearly identified as B or D.
Subtype B strains predominate in Brazil but, like in
France, subtype C viruses have been recently introduced.
Subsequently, recombinations between B and C led to
CRF31_BC and multiple unique B/C recombinants. 06FRCRN, a unique B/C/U recombinant involving a Brazilian
subtype C, could have been exported from Brazil into
France, or it could derive from a pure Brazilian subtype C
that recombined in France or from a Brazilian B/C strain
recombining with the U fragment in France.
04FR-AUK is a complex recombinant strain related to
HIV-1 strains which have been circulating for a long time
in Central Africa. The 5'end of 04FR-AUK is related to
HIV-1 MAL which has been described in France more than
20 years ago in a Congolese patient [23], and to HIV-1
NOGIL, described in Norway [24]. The 04FR-AUK
sequence contributed to better define the complex structure and the evolution of MAL and "MAL-like" NOGIL
strains. Jonassen and col. have previously reported that
MAL and NOGIL may be derived from a postulated MALNOGIL parental lineage, which probably existed before
1981 [24]. Our results showed that an additional strain is
derived from this parental lineage. We showed that the
04FR-AUK/NOGIL divergence breakpoint was located in
the vpr gene, while the divergence breakpoint between
MAL and these "MAL-like" strains was located in the vif
gene, earlier in the viral genome. Secondly, 04FR-AUK
and MAL strongly clustered together in the nef gene and
the LTR, whereas NOGIL belonged to a different subtype.
Thus, it could be expected that 04FR-AUK derived from
the recombination between the postulated parental lineage and another previously undescribed complex strain
with a "A/K/U (CRF09)" env structure or that multiple
independent recombination events occurred leading to
the final observed structure. Subsequent screening of HIV1 sequences available from genbank or Los Alamos database, for similarity with MAL, NOGIL and/or 04FR-AUK
strains identified at least 6 strains which formed a well
supported cluster with them in a 1500 bp fragment in pol
(protease and RT). Moreover, further simplot and bootscan
analyses confirmed the same recombinant structure in

this part of the genome. In addition, for some of these
strains, additional partial env and/or gag sequences were
also available and were identified as subtype A similar as
the 04FR-AUK strain, but different form MAL and NOGIL.
However, full-length genome sequence will be necessary
to identify whether these viruses share the same structure
as 04FR-AUK. Interestingly, almost all these potential
related viruses have their origin in central Africa, especially DRC or Cameroon, except one from Senegal.
Five other PHI have been further diagnosed since October
2006 with KZS and CRN-like viruses, suggesting their
spread in France. Firstly, another CRF27 infection (06FRBOR) was identified in a patient of the PRIMO Cohort
based on partial pol (RT) and env (V3-V5) sequences. This
PHI occurred in December 2006 in a 34-year old man,
originating from DRC and infected in France after heterosexual intercourse. The genetic distance between 06FRBOR and 04FR-KZS as well as epidemiological information, revealed absence of any epidemiological link. Interestingly, the genetic distances between the 4 reported
CRF27 strains are relatively high (18% diversity in the env
gene between 06FR-BOR and 04FR-KZS), indicating that
CRF27-cpx is an old HIV-1 variant and that either several
independent introductions occurred into France or either
these viruses circulated for a longer period in France but
remained undetected. Effectively, our network for the survey of the viral diversity in French primo-infected patients
included each year only 5–10% of the overall estimated
PHI [31]. This recent spread in France contrasts with the
low (0.75%) and stable CRF27_cpx prevalence in Central
Africa [32,33]. Secondly, four other strains have been isolated in our laboratory since November 2006 in French
Caucasian MSM at the time of PHI, which -strongly clustered with 06FR-CRN and 06FR-ETU, with more than
99% homology among RT and V3-V5 sequences and
seemed to belong also to the same contamination cluster
(data not shown). These results suggest the recent and
possible rapid spread of this URF in France which could
become a CRF spreading in France among the population
of MSM.

Conclusion
Our study confirms the increasing complexity of HIV-1
viruses, not only in Central Africa [29], but also in France,
even in Caucasian patients. This evolution is due to immigration flows from Africa, but also from South America
and possible other regions, and associates new (06FRCRN) and old (CRF27_cpx and "MAL-like" 04FR-AUK)
HIV-1 strains, which are rare in their region of origin but
may have a possible founder effect in France. Our results
strengthen the French guidelines which recommend to
perform genotypic resistance tests at the time of PHI to
survey the frequency of resistant strains as well as the
molecular epidemiological HIV-1 diversity.
