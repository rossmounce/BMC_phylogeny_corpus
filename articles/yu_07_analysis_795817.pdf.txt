Abstract
Background: Despite the small number of ursid species, bear phylogeny has long been a focus of
study due to their conservation value, as all bear genera have been classified as endangered at either
the species or subspecies level. The Ursidae family represents a typical example of rapid
evolutionary radiation. Previous analyses with a single mitochondrial (mt) gene or a small number
of mt genes either provide weak support or a large unresolved polytomy for ursids. We revisit the
contentious relationships within Ursidae by analyzing complete mt genome sequences and
evaluating the performance of both entire mt genomes and constituent mtDNA genes in recovering
a phylogeny of extremely recent speciation events.
Results: This mitochondrial genome-based phylogeny provides strong evidence that the
spectacled bear diverged first, while within the genus Ursus, the sloth bear is the sister taxon of all
the other five ursines. The latter group is divided into the brown bear/polar bear and the two black
bears/sun bear assemblages. These findings resolve the previous conflicts between trees using
partial mt genes. The ability of different categories of mt protein coding genes to recover the
correct phylogeny is concordant with previous analyses for taxa with deep divergence times. This
study provides a robust Ursidae phylogenetic framework for future validation by additional
independent evidence, and also has significant implications for assisting in the resolution of other
similarly difficult phylogenetic investigations.
Conclusion: Identification of base composition bias and utilization of the combined data of whole
mitochondrial genome sequences has allowed recovery of a strongly supported phylogeny that is
upheld when using multiple alternative outgroups for the Ursidae, a mammalian family that
underwent a rapid radiation since the mid- to late Pliocene. It remains to be seen if the reliability
of mt genome analysis will hold up in studies of other difficult phylogenetic issues. Although the
whole mitochondrial DNA sequence based phylogeny is robust, it remains in conflict with
phylogenetic relationships suggested by analysis of limited nuclear-encoded data, a situation that
will require gathering more nuclear DNA sequence information.

Background
The Ursidae is a major family of the order Carnivora, comprising eight species. They are generally classified into
three genera: Ailuropoda (giant panda), Tremarctos (spectacled bear), and Ursus (brown, polar, sloth, sun, and Asiatic
and American black bears) [1-3]. Despite the small
number of ursid species, bear phylogeny has long been a
focus of study due to their conservation value, as all bear
genera have been classified as endangered at either the
species or subspecies level. The ultimate recognition of the
giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca as the most basal offshoot in the bear family, after more than a century of
debate since this species' discovery in 1864, was one of the
most spectacular events in the history of modern phylogenetics [4-8]. This achievement also sparked controversy
regarding the relationships among the other members of
Ursidae and the possibility of an extremely recent radiation for genus Ursus [6,8,9] (6 million years ago). Up to
now, only the subsequent divergence of Tremarctos ornatus
(the spectacled bear) to the giant panda, and the sister
grouping of Ursus arctos (the brown bear) and Ursus maritimus (the polar bear) have been unambiguously
accepted. All other relationships within the genus Ursus
remained an unresolved polytomy (Figure 1).

Finding a valid genetic marker that offers sufficient variation to distinguish among recently divergent species
posed a major challenge to advancing the understanding
of ursid phylogeny. Previous investigations of phylogenetic relationships among the bear species mainly utilized
analysis of portions of a single mitochondrial (mt) gene
or a small number of mt genes [8,10-13]. In general,
mtDNA accumulates mutations at a relatively faster rate
and has a shorter expected coalescence time than other
types of sequence data, e.g. nuclear DNA, thus making it
particularly useful for revealing closely spaced branching
events [14-17]. However, none of the previous mt analyses provided conclusive resolution for this low-level phylogeny. Additionally, analyses of different genes within
the mt genome have resulted in inconsistent branching
patterns being reported in the Ursidae (Figure 1A–E).
Recently, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that
using sufficiently large amounts of mtDNA sequence data,
e.g. the whole mt genome, is a powerful way to ameliorate
the discordances and poor resolution that plague analyses
based on single genes or segments [16,18-22]. Thus, as a
further step toward the understanding of Ursidae phylogeny, it was highly desirable to address this evolutionary
question from a mitogenomic perspective.

On the basis of the most comprehensive molecular data
set assembled to date for the Ursidae, the present work
revisits the contentious relationships within genus Ursus
by analyzing complete mt genome sequences from all representatives of bears and, for the first time, evaluates the
performance of both entire mt genomes and constituent
mtDNA genes in recovering a phylogenetic tree within a
rapid, recent radiation. The improved reconstruction of
ursid relationships utilizing the entire mt genome also
permitted a refined dating of evolutionary divergence
among these bear species. Our research thus not only generates a strong Ursidae phylogenetic framework for future
validation using additional evidence but, most significantly, provides a model system against which to examine
the usefulness of mt genomes for resolving difficult phylogenies with rapid species radiation.

tRNA dataset (average 5.2%), from 5.0 to 18.9% for the
control region (average 10%), and from 2.2 to 17.0% for
the complete dataset (average 10.7%).
Reconstructing the Phylogenetic Relationships
The combined data set of 12 protein-coding genes (10882
aligned nucleotide sites; 3534 variable and 1970 parsimony-informative) produced a single most-parsimonious
tree of 5512 steps without MP weighting (Figure 2A). In
this tree, the spectacled bear diverged earliest (MP BS =
100%), followed by the sloth bear (MP BS = 67%). Sistergroup relationships were indicated between the Asiatic
black and the American black bear (MP BS = 86%), as well
as between the brown and the polar bear (MP BS = 100%),
while the sun bear clustered with the two black bears (MP
BS = 65%). Because the giant panda sequence deviates significantly from the mean nucleotide frequency on the 3rd
codon position by a 5% chi-square test (p < 0.05), the
phylogenetic analysis was therefore also conducted under
different weighting schemes, including P12 and RY-coding methods (see Methods). In all cases, an identical
topology to that of unweighted analysis was obtained, but
the close relatedness between the Asian black and American black bears was less well supported (MP BS < 50%;
Figure 2A). Generally, better resolution and stronger bootstrap supports were obtained from DNA datasets that
included all substitutions than from those subjected to
the weighting. As an alternative attempt to evaluate the
effect of compositional bias on the reconstructed tree, we
reanalyzed the data without the giant panda and used
spectacled bear for rooting. This approach provided a data
set without significant base composition variation (p >
0.05). Interestingly, the resulting tree topology remained
constant but there was a noticeable effect on the nodal
support, where all relationships in the tree were robustly
identified (MP BS > 85%; Figure 2A). Particularly, BS for
the positions of the sloth bear and the sun bear increased
to 90% and 87%, respectively. ML and partitioned Bayesian analyses (using distinct models and rates for each

Results
Sequence Characteristics
The general characteristics of eight bear mt genomes are
summarized in Table 1. These complete mt genomes
range from 16,746–17,020 bp in size. Length differences
are largely due to the variation in copy number of tandem
repeated sequences in the conserved sequence block
(CSB) domains of the mt control region. All genomes
share not only 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs genes,
2 rRNAs, and a control region, but also the same gene
order. The overall average nucleotide composition of bear
mt genomes is A = 30.9%, C = 25.0%, G = 15.6%, and T =
28.5%. The constancy of nucleotide base composition
was examined using the chi-square test with PUZZLE for
different subsets of mt genome (defined in Methods), and
heterogeneous nucleotide composition (p < 0.05) was
observed in the combined protein-coding gene dataset
and the complete dataset (as described below). The K2P
distances [23] among seven ingroup taxa calculated using
MEGA3 [24] range from 2.3 to 19.9% for the protein-coding dataset (average 12.8%), from 1.2 to 10.1% for the
rRNA dataset (average 6.1%), from 1.3 to 8.7% for the

protein gene) of the dataset, whether the giant panda or
the spectacled bear was used as outgroup, showed the
same tree topology as Figure 2A. All nodes in the ML and
Bayesian trees received high BP (≥ 85%) and PP (≥ 0.99)
except for the position of the sloth bear. Tables in Figure
2A illustrate the confidence level of the nodal relationships under all analytical approaches.
Both of the combined RNA data sets (rRNAs and tRNAs)
demonstrated reduced resolving power for phylogenetic
inference compared to protein-coding gene analysis (Figure 2B–D). The aligned rRNA sequences (combined 12S
and 16SrRNA genes) were 2574 bp in length, of which
480 nucleotide sites were variable and 222 were parsimony-informative. MP analysis yielded two equally mostparsimonious trees of 683 steps. One of them is topologically identical to the protein-coding gene tree shown in
Figure 2A. Although most relationships collapsed on the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/198

50% majority-rule consensus of the two parsimonious
trees (Figure 2B), the two black bears and the sun bear
formed a clade on the ML (ML BS = 62%) and partitioned
Bayesian trees (distinct models and rates for two rRNA
genes; PP = 0.95; Figure 2C), a relationship also supported
in the protein-coding gene analysis. Interestingly, when
stem-loop secondary structures were considered, the single most-parsimonious tree (495 steps) based on the loop
region (1283 bp) identified the same topology as Figure
2A. In contrast, 50% majority-rule consensus of three
equally most-parsimonious trees (186 steps) based on the
stem region (1291 bp) recovered a tree topology that differed in placing the Asiatic black bear as basal to the reset
of Ursus, while joining the American black bear, the sun
bear, and the sloth bear on a common branch (data not
shown). However, nodal supports for most relationships
in the stem and loop trees are below 50%, with the exception of the earliest branching of the spectacled bear
among the in-group and the close association of the
brown and polar bears (MP BS = 100%).
The tRNA data set (combined 22 tRNA genes) contained
1518 bp of aligned sites, of which 256 were variable and
100 were parsimony-informative. Parsimony analysis
produced a most-parsimonious tree of 341 steps with a
different topology from those of protein-coding and rRNA
gene analyses. According to this tree, the sloth bear was
grouped with the Asiatic black bear, and they are placed as
a clade sister to the lineage leading to the American black
bear and the sun bear. However, in this tree only the basal
position of the spectacled bear, and the close association
of the brown bear and the polar bear, were convincingly
supported (MP BS = 100%; Figure 2D); none of the other
relationships received MP BS larger than 50%. ML and
Bayesian analyses produced a similar tree topology and
nodal support as the MP tree.

In the control region of the mt genome, tandem repeated
sequences and ambiguously aligned regions were
excluded, leaving 1008 positions in the phylogenetic analysis. 316 were variable and 124 were parsimony-informative. MP reconstruction yielded a most-parsimonious tree
of 463 steps. The striking topological difference from protein-coding and RNA gene analyses was the positioning of
the sun bear, Asian black bear, and American bears as the
successive sister taxa to the clade consisting of the brown
and polar bears. However, only the branch that separates
the spectacled bear from Ursus and the basal diverging of
the sloth bear within Ursus, and the affinity of the brown
and polar bears, received >50% bootstrap support (Figure
2E). ML and Bayesian analyses of the same data set found
a large unresolved polytomy leading to most bear species,
and only the sister-grouping of the brown and polar bears
was strongly supported (ML BS = 99% and PP = 1.00; Figure 2F).

To maximize the amount of phylogenetic information, we
also pooled all mt protein-coding genes, RNA genes, and
control regions to form a single data set with a length of
15982 aligned sites for "genome phylogeny" reconstruction, of which 4586 were variable and 2416 were parsimony-informative. A unique topology exactly identical to
that produced by the combined protein-coding gene analysis, but with higher statistical nodal supports, was
obtained by all three analytical approaches (Figure 3; 70–
100% BS and 0.85–1.00 PP). The tree topology was not
affected by exclusion of the giant panda sequence (p <
0.05 with PUZZLE) and moreover, by rooting the tree
with the spectacled bear, the supports for most branches
increased to convincing statistical significance (≥ 85 BS
and ≥ 0.95 PP), increasing our confidence in the result.
The complete mtDNA genome-based phylogeny of the
Ursidae incorporates the largest amount of phylogenetically informative sequence-based characters and provides
the most robust tree for this carnivore family in terms of
resolved topology and support for nodes.
Assessing the Performance of Individual Genes
The determination of complete mt sequences from all
bear species affords the opportunity not only to utilize
these data to estimate the phylogeny of the Ursidae but
also, to examine characteristics of the evolution of mitochondrial protein coding and non-coding genes. It is of
interest to evaluate their individual performance in supporting the complete mtDNA-based phylogeny within
such a recent radiation involving specializations to a variety of habitats and reproductive patterns. For this reason,
unweighted MP analysis was also performed on proteincoding and rRNA genes individually (Figure 4; only >50%
MP BS are indicated on the branches). The earliest split of
the spectacled bear and the grouping of the brown bear
and polar bear, which are the only two strongly supported
hypotheses in Ursidae phylogeny to date, are observed in
all of these single-gene trees (61–100% and 76–100% MP
BS, respectively) whereas the position of the other bear

species in Ursus was either not recovered at all or varied
considerably with little or no nodal support. Among these
single gene trees, only the CYTB and ND5 trees have the
same branching order as that from the combined all gene
analysis (Figure 3).
To better assess which grouping in whole-genome phylogeny was supported by different parts of the mt genome
(i.e., protein-coding, RNA genes, and control region), we
performed partitioned Bremer support (PBS) analysis and
the result is shown in Figure 5. The partial Bremer index
for each data partition is determined by subtracting the
number of steps for that partition in the most parsimonious tree from the number of steps for that partition in the
shortest tree lacking the node in question [25]. Partial
decay indices may be either positive or negative for an
individual data partition. PBS analysis indicated that
among the 16 gene partitions examined (Figure 5), the
ND5 gene provides the greatest contribution to the complete gene tree resolution (124/750 = 16.53%) while the
ND3 gene contributes the least (9/750 = 1.30%). From
the results of PBS analysis, we find that all genes allocated
Bremer supports predominately in the traditionally wellestablished relationships, i.e., branches 1 and 5 in the tree
(94.93% in total; data not shown). Leaving these two
branches out of the analysis, the ND5 gene still provided
the largest proportion of PBS values (19/40 = 47.50%)
compared to those of the remaining branches (Figure 5).
In contrast, the ND1 gene provided the highest conflict
values (-14/40 = -35.00%). Whether branches 1 and 5
were included or not, PBS analyses give the rough appearance of relatively superior performance of ND5, ND4,
CYTB, 16SrRNA, and ND2 genes, and on the other hand,
of the poor utility of ND3, ND4L and ND1 genes. Combined tRNAs, COX2, 12SrRNA genes, and control region
are intermediate (Figure 5).
Dating the Evolutionary Divergences
Results of a likelihood ratio test of the molecular-clock
hypothesis for the five data sets, as defined for the phylogenetic analysis, are presented in Table 2. The combined
protein-coding data set was used in estimating divergence
times of Ursidae radiation, in view of its relatively good
tree resolution and constant evolutionary rates across all
taxa. By applying a minimum paleonotological date of
separation between the giant panda and the other bear
species of 12 million years ago [26,27] (MYA), which has
also been used as an established reference in all previous
studies of Ursidae [8,12,13], we inferred that the divergence of the spectacled bear from the ursine clade
occurred at 10.91 MYA (95% confidence intervals = 9.93–
11.89 MYA). The six closely related bears in genus Ursus
began their recent radiation from a common ancestor at
6.34 MYA (95% confidence intervals = 5.95–6.73 MYA;
node 5 in Figure 3). Similar thinking applied to the genus

Ursus suggests a divergence time between the brown and
polar bears and the two black bears/sun bear of 6.13 MYA
(95% confidence intervals = 5.54–6.72 MYA; node 4), and
that between the sun bear and the two black bears of
5.673 MYA (95% confidence intervals = 5.09–6.26 MYA;

between the brown bear and polar bear 1.32 MYA (95%

Discussion
Among mammalian phylogenies, those characterized by
rapid species radiations have long been one of the most
plaguing and challenging problems in species tree reconstruction [28]. This is the first study utilizing data from
whole mitochondrial genome sequences from ursids, an
approach that allows increased phylogenetic resolution of
the Ursidae family, whose origin can be traced back to the
extremely recent mid-Miocene[6,9] (15–20 MYA). Previous molecular studies relevant to Ursidae phylogeny provided either an inconsistent view on the issue or weak
statistical support for discriminating alternative hypotheses (Figure 1). The branching event following the divergence of the spectacled bear has long been a large
unresolved polytomy leading to six Ursus species, of
which only the sister-relationship between the brown
bear and polar bear was unanimously favored. The close
relatedness of brown bear and polar bear, as well as the
paraphyletic association between mtDNA of these two
bears has been upheld in previous studies [29-31]. More
sequences of brown bear and polar bear included in the
future research will help test further the earlier observations. In sum, the long-standing lack of full resolution
within Ursidae may be primarily due to the low level of
variation harbored in much shorter sequences than those
used in this study.
Based on the largest available mt data set from Ursidae,
our genome phylogeny provides strong evidence that
within genus Ursus, the sloth bear is the sister taxa of all
the other five ursines, and that the latter group is divided
into the brown bear/polar bear and the two black bears/
sun bear assemblages, upholding and strengthening the
hypothesis drawn by our previous analysis of the five fragments of mtDNA [13] (Figure 1E). Alternative hypotheses
for a mitochondrial sequence based phylogeny are not
supported when the entire mitochondrial DNA sequence
information is utilized. In particular, when nucleotide
base compositional bias introduced by the giant panda
outgroup was removed from our analysis and the specta-

cled bear was used for rooting, the overall Ursidae relationships recovered have the largest statistical support in
comparison to all other previously proposed hypotheses.
To further examine the sensitivity of our tree topology to
outgroup choice, we selected Pinnipedia. This superfamily
in Carnivora includes the Otariidae, Phocidae, and Odobenidae families, members of which have been used as
alternative roots in earlier studies of bears [8,12].
Combined protein-coding genes (10888 aligned sites,
4522 variable and 3245 parsimony-informative) and all
mt genes (15017 aligned sites, 5642 variable and 3926
parsimony-informative; control region was not included
due to alignment difficulty) analyses of the eight bear species using available Pinnipedia mt genomes as outgroups
(Accession No. AJ428576, AJ428578 and X63726;
[32,33]) gave an identical tree topology to that obtained
using the giant panda as the outgroup. Support levels for
most branches were similar to those estimated with the
giant panda outgroup except for an increased ML BS (≥
85) and PP (≥ 0.95 PP) of placement of the sloth bear
(Figure 2A and 3). A chi-square test of composition stationary showed that both Pinnipedia and the giant panda
have deviant base composition with respect to the other
bears (p < 0.05), a circumstance that might have a negative impact on the branch supports in MP analysis. Thus,
our genome phylogeny was robust with either outgroup,
though the spectacled bear, exhibiting the least phylogenetic noise, appears a more favorable outgroup for Ursidae in terms of overall support levels. Taken together, the
present genome result significantly resolved the conflict
between those trees using partial mt genes [8,11-13] and

represents the most probable explanation of bear evolution.
Nevertheless, a more in-depth understanding of the Ursidae relationships will definitely benefit from the addition
of independent sequence data, considering that the
genome phylogeny obtained here is based on a single and
haploid linkage unit. The necessity of including other
unlinked genes for phylogenetic resolution of the Ursidae
is also illustrated by the fact that our recent study on two
nuclear genes, transthyretin (TTR) and interphotoreceptor
retinoid binding protein (IRBP), has united the sloth bear
and the sun bear as sister taxa with high statistical support
[13] (Figure 1 nuA), a relationship not consistent with mt
gene analyses, including the present study. In mt trees, the
sloth bear was mostly placed as the earliest diverging taxa
among the six ursine species [8,11,13, and the present
result], and the sun bear closer to the American black bear
[11], the brown bear/polar bear clade [MP phylogeny in
12; ML phylogeny in 8], or the clade including the two
black bears (NJ phylogeny in 12; 13 and the present
result). Notably, the sister relationship between the Asian
and American black bears, previously proposed on paleontological and morphological grounds [34,35] was reinforced by consistent recovery from both our mt genome
and nuclear analysis. Such a grouping has also been
retrieved previously with moderate support by mt analysis
of complete CYTB and 2 tRNAs [12], as well as the addition of the partial D-loop region [13]. Thus, the placements of the sun bear and the sloth bear represent are the
most obvious discrepancy observed in the mt and nuclear
trees comparisons. Our genome analysis has established a

very useful benchmark that can be tested with future independent evidence.
Our genome analyses provide important insights into not
only Ursidae phylogeny, but also the phylogenetic utility
of different mt genes. Our data add to the well-studied
performance of individual mt genes, mostly protein-coding genes, for estimating phylogeny of deep divergence
[16,36], we are interested to see their relative efficiencies,
adding mt RNA genes and control region as well, in those
of extremely recent split. Our results suggest that combined mt protein-coding genes are more informative than
the other subsets of mt genes regarding the lower-level
bear relationships resolution. Only by combining all
genes is it possible to reach a fully-resolved tree with moderate to strong support from MP, ML, and Bayesian methods of analysis. Ranking single genes by their respective
contribution to the total PBS values of the genome tree, as
a rough indicator of phylogenetic utility, reveals that some
genes, such as ND5, ND4, CYTB, ND2, and 16SrRNA are
better indicators of Ursidae evolution than are other
genes, such as ND3, ND4L, and ND1 (Figure 5). Our
results add to previous findings from Zardoya and Meyer
(1996) [16] and Russo, Takezaki, and Nei (1996) [36]
that did not included concatenated tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and
control regions in the evaluation of phylogenetic performance, and also agree globally with their conclusions about
the rough classification of 12 mt protein-coding genes
into good, medium, and poor categories. These conclusions are upheld even though significantly different evolutionary time frames between our studies and theirs (i.e.,
distantly related vertebrates) (Figure 5) are involved. In
this sense, general knowledge of phylogenetic values of
the mt genes makes it possible to preselect subsets of mt
genes for different-level phylogenetic questions in the case
of mt genomes unavailable. In fact, in some previous
studies, Ursidae phylogenies based on the combined analysis of a few mt genes have also, to a degree, demonstrated
the potential valuable information as those based on
complete genome analysis [8,12].
Ursidae has one of the most extensive fossil records of
extant Carnivora families [9,26,27,35,37]. Given a good
fossil documentation and strongly supported phylogenetic relationships from the largest available data set, it is
of interest to draw a comparison between the present
mitogenomic dating results and those from previous paleontological and molecular evidence (Table 3). According
to estimates based on our genome data, all the separation
times within genus Ursus appear to have occurred in the
Late Miocene or Early Pliocene (5–6 MYA), except that in
the Early Pleistocene the most closely related bear species,
the brown and polar bears diverged. The rather recent origins and rapid succession of these bear lineages are in line
with the observation that most short mtDNA sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/198

used in previous studies lack sufficiently strong phylogenetic signals and provide limited resolving power for
recovering a strongly supported Ursidae phylogeny. As is
seen in Table 3, our estimates of the diversification of the
Ursidae family was more in agreement with those
obtained with partial mt genes analysis [12] and protein
electrophoresis analysis [6] than those obtained with the
fossil record [9,26,35]and nuclear sequence analysis [13],
which are slightly younger than the present results.

Conclusion
Identification of base composition bias and utilization of
the combined data of whole mitochondrial genome
sequences has allowed recovery of a strongly supported
phylogeny that is upheld when using multiple alternative
outgroups for the Ursidae, a mammalian family that
underwent a rapid radiation since the mid- to late
Pliocene.
The suggestion of Delisle and Strobeck (2002) [38] that
application of mitogenomic datasets would be likely to be
useful for distinguishing nodes resulting from rapid radiation episodes such as the ursine speciation events is validated by these findings. It remains to be seen if the
reliability of mt genome analysis will hold up in studies of
other difficult phylogenetic issues. Although the whole
mitochondrial DNA sequence based phylogeny is robust,
it remains in conflict with phylogenetic relationships suggested by analysis of limited nuclear-encoded data, a situation that will require gathering more nuclear DNA
sequence information.

Methods
DNA Samples and Sequence Determination
The complete mt sequences of three bear species in genus
Ursus, the polar bear (U. maritimus), the brown bear (U.
arctos), and the American black bear (U. americanus), have
been determined in previous studies of genome evolution
[38]. Thus, the availability of the other five mt genome
sequences from Ursidae was of considerable interest for
phylogenetic reconstruction. We extracted total DNA
from fresh blood or frozen tissues of the Asiatic black bear
(U. thibetanus), the sloth bear (U. ursinus), the sun bear
(U. malayanus), the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus)
and the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) using standard proteinase K, phenol/chloroform extraction [39].

Mt genome sequences were initially amplified with sets of
universal primers (73 in total) described in Delisle and
Strobeck's original study (2002) [38]. In the case of poor
PCR performance with universal primers, 31 additional
species-specific oligonucleotide primers were designed
(underlined in Figure 6). Primer sequence information
was available upon request. A "touch-down" PCR amplification was carried out using the following parameters:

95°C hot start (5 min), 10 cycles of 94°C denaturation (1

(1 min), 50°C annealing (1 min), 72°C extension (1
min). The amplified DNA fragments were purified and
sequenced in both directions with an ABI PRISM™ 3700
DNA sequencer following the manufacturer's protocol.
Mt sequences obtained were checked carefully to ensure
that they did not include nuclear copies of mtDNA-like
pseudogenes. The exact length of the control region in the
mt genome cannot be determined due to the presence of
long tandem repeated sequences. Newly determined
genomes have been deposited in GenBank under Accession No. EF19661–EF19665.
Sequence Data Analyses
The complete mt genome sequences of all extant bear species were aligned with program CLUSTAL X [40] and verified by eye. Five data sets comprising (1) all proteincoding genes combined except NADH6 gene, (2) 12S and
16S tRNA genes combined, (3) all 22 rRNA genes combined, (4) control region (CR), and (5) all genes combined were analyzed for phylogenetic reconstruction. The
NADH6 gene is excluded from the analyses due to its
anomalous nucleotide composition which can confound
phylogenetic inferences.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/198

Each of these data sets was subjected to unweighted maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML)
analyses using PAUP *4.0b8 [41]. For MP analyses, we
adopted an exhaustive search algorithm with TBR branch
swapping. For model-based ML analyses, we introduced
hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRT) to compare the
goodness of fit of 56 nucleotide substitution models using
ModelTest version 3.06 [42]. Once an appropriate model
was established, a ML tree was constructed based on this
model of sequence evolution. The reliability of phylogenetic relationships was evaluated by bootstrap analysis
[43] for MP and ML trees (BS; 1000 replicates for MP and
100 replicates for ML). In addition, we performed a partitioned Bayesian inference (pBI) analysis [44] for phylogenetic reconstruction using MrBayes 3.1 [45], allowing a
separate general time reversible (GTR) + I + Γ model and
set of parameters for each gene partition, with the assumption that the underlying evolutionary process was potentially different across these partitions. Four Metropoliscoupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses
were run for 2 million generations, sampling trees every
100 generations. Robustness for branches in pBI analysis
was assessed by posterior probability (PP). We also conducted partitioned Bremer support analysis (PBS) [46-48]
with TreeRot.v2 [25] to measure the contribution of each
data partition to the total Bremer support for the nodes of
genome-based tree topology.
To avoid potential tree estimation bias introduced by
nucleotide composition [49,50] or saturation, two additional weighting strategies were applied in the analysis of
combined 12 protein-coding genes: (1) excluding the 3rd
codon positions (P12), and (2) recoding the 3rd codon
position nucleotides to two-state categories, R (purine)
and Y (pyrimidine), (RY-coding). The RY-coding was used
here based on the growing observation that it can greatly
improve consistency in phylogenetic resolution by reducing bias from differences in nucleotide composition [5154]. In the combined analysis, portions of the 12S rRNA
and 16S rRNA genes were also partitioned into two separate subsets according to their secondary structures: singlestrand stems and base-paired loops [55,56].
The giant panda was used as an outgroup for estimating
phylogenetic relationships within genus Ursus. To examine if the resulting tree topologies were sensitive to outgroup alteration, we also carried out phylogenetic analysis
with Pinnipedia, a non-ursine superfamily in Carnivora,
for the rooting.
The molecular clock hypothesis was examined using the
likelihood-ratio test [57] with PUZZLE [58,59]. When
clock-like behavior was not rejected by the test, the divergence times among them were calculated and compared
to previous molecular results and fossil records.
