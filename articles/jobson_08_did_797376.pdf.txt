Abstract
Background: The C↔U substitution types of RNA editing have been observed frequently in
organellar genomes of land plants. Although various attempts have been made to explain why such
a seemingly inefficient genetic mechanism would have evolved, no satisfactory explanation exists in
our view. In this study, we examined editing patterns in chloroplast genomes of the hornwort
Anthoceros formosae and the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris and in mitochondrial genomes of the
angiosperms Arabidopsis thaliana, Beta vulgaris and Oryza sativa, to gain an understanding of the
question of how RNA editing originated.
Results: We found that 1) most editing sites were distributed at the 2nd and 1st codon positions,
2) editing affected codons that resulted in larger hydrophobicity and molecular size changes much
more frequently than those with little change involved, 3) editing uniformly increased protein
hydrophobicity, 4) editing occurred more frequently in ancestrally T-rich sequences, which were
more abundant in genes encoding membrane-bound proteins with many hydrophobic amino acids
than in genes encoding soluble proteins, and 5) editing occurred most often in genes found to be
under strong selective constraint.
Conclusion: These analyses show that editing mostly affects functionally important and
evolutionarily conserved codon positions, codons and genes encoding membrane-bound proteins.
In particular, abundance of RNA editing in plant organellar genomes may be associated with
disproportionately large percentages of genes in these two genomes that encode membrane-bound
proteins, which are rich in hydrophobic amino acids and selectively constrained. These data
support a hypothesis that natural selection imposed by protein functional constraints has
contributed to selective fixation of certain editing sites and maintenance of the editing activity in
plant organelles over a period of more than four hundred millions years. The retention of genes
encoding RNA editing activity may be driven by forces that shape nucleotide composition
equilibrium in two organellar genomes of these plants. Nevertheless, the causes of lineage-specific
occurrence of a large portion of RNA editing sites remain to be determined.

RNA editing refers to the general phenomenon of posttranscriptional modification of gene transcripts, including
insertion, deletion and substitution of nucleotides [1,2].
In plants, substitution types of RNA editing, mostly C to
U but occasionally U to C, have been observed in both
chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of all major lineages of land plants [3-15].

gymnosperm Pinus thunbergii [29,30], and the
angiosperms Cuscuta reflexa and C. gronovii [15], Arabidopsis thaliana [31,32], Nicotiana tabacum [33,34], Atropa belladonna [35], Phalaenopsis aphrodite [36], Saccharum
officinarum [37], and Zea mays [38]. For the mitochondrial
genome, five angiosperms have been investigated: A. thaliana [8,39], Brassica napus [10], Beta vulgaris [14,40], Oryza
sativa [41], and partially for Zea mays [42].

Previous studies have shown genome-wide occurrence of
RNA editing in both chloroplasts and mitochondria
[8,10-15], restoration of conserved amino acids by RNA
editing [3-5,11,13,15-17], increases of protein hydrophobicity after editing [8,11], correlation of editing frequency
with GC content in a gene [18], possible association of
RNA editing with gene regulation [8,19], and gain and
loss of edit sites through time [20]. The phylogenetic distribution of RNA editing across lineages of plants has also
been investigated, with patterns of editing site gain and
loss found to be mostly lineage specific [7,9,12,21-23].

In the A. formosae chloroplast genome there are 509 C→U
sites distributed across 68 genes and eight ORF's, with 94,
397 and 12 sites at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd codon positions respectively. A majority of editing events involves codon
changes from NCN to NUN (Ser, Pro, Thr, Ala → Phe, Leu,
Ile, Met, Val) with editing at 2nd positions. The 433 U→C
sites in this genome are distributed across 69 genes, with
264, 149, and 16 sites occurring at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd codon
positions respectively. 81% of the edited 1st positions convert Stop (UAR) codons to those of Gln (CAR), and Cys/
Stop/Trp (UGN) codons to those of Arg (CGN) [11,17].

Despites these studies, the fundamental question of how
RNA editing originated in plant organellar genomes
remains largely unanswered. Some researchers have suggested a hypothesis of genetic drift resulting in both the
appearance of editing activity and fixation of mutations at
editable sites [24-26], with a possibility of natural selection maintaining RNA editing activity [24]. However,
there has been no analysis using empirical data to explicitly test this hypothesis. In particular, no comprehensive
analysis has been performed to examine the extent of
functional difference resulted from amino acid changes
caused by RNA editing, even though it is generally recognized that RNA editing involves functionally important
changes in both protein-coding and structural and regulatory RNA-coding sequences. Further, in spite of the observation of hydrophobicity difference of amino acid
changes involved in RNA editing in Arabidopsis thaliana
and Anthoceros formosae [8,11], no attempt has been made
to evaluate this change of an important physico-chemical
property of amino acids from a broad perspective of the
cellular compartment environment in both organelles.
Chloroplasts and mitochondria house disproportionately
large percentages of genes encoding membrane-bound
proteins involved in electron transport and ATP synthesis
in energy metabolism [27]. Finally, the genomic and
sequence environment in which RNA editing arose
remains poorly known.

In the A. capillus-veneris chloroplast genome, 51 C→U,
and all 35 U→C editing events occur in 1st positions,
while 226 and 20 C→U changes are found at 2nd and 3rd
positions respectively. Of these editing events 75% of the
1st position U→C edits consist of Stop (UGA) to Arg
(CGA) codon changes. The C→U changes are found
across 52 genes, while U→C editing events occur in 20
genes [13].

Background

Over the last ten years, a number of plants have been
investigated for genome-wide RNA editing by comparing
the fully sequenced organellar genomes with their mature
transcriptomes. These include 11 diverse land plants for
the chloroplast genome: the hornwort Anthoceros formosae
[11,17], the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris [13,28], the

In comparison, the chloroplast genomes of seed plants
contain only ~15–44 C→U editing sites, distributed
across ~15 genes [15,22,26,29-38]. There has been an
apparent loss of RNA editing sites in the chloroplast
genome during evolution of land plants [20,26].
While the mitochondrial genome of Marchantia polymorpha (a liverwort) lacks RNA editing [9,43], a large number
of editing sites have been found in three angiosperm
mitochondrial genomes. In A. thaliana, 441 C→U sites are
spread across 30 genes with the majority found at the 2nd
codon positions (236), followed by 1st (154), and 3rd (51)
positions. 57% of 1st position editing involves URN to
CRN changes [8]. For B. vulgaris 353 C→U sites were identified across 30 protein coding genes with 125, 198, and
30 sites found at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd codon positions respectively [14]. In O. sativa, a similar pattern has been
observed, with 153, 246, and 38 editing sites at 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd positions of 29 genes respectively [41].
These data provide an opportunity to take a comparative
genomic approach to investigate the question of how
RNA editing evolved in plant organellar genomes. In this
study, we analyzed the sequence and editing data from
fully characterized organellar genomes of A. formosae, A.

capillus-veneris, A. thaliana, B. vulgaris, and O. sativa, to
gain a better understanding of conditions under which
RNA editing evolved. Since B. napus and Z. mays are
closely related to A. thaliana and O. sativa respectively, and
their editing patterns are similar to each other, they were
excluded from our analyses. The chloroplast genomes of
P. thunbergii, A. thaliana, N. tabacum, A. belladonna, Z.
mays, and other angiosperms were not analyzed here
because they contained only a small number of editing
sites and might not be suitable for detecting general patterns.
We first examined types of codons that were edited and
their editing frequencies. In particular, we investigated the
relationship between the change in hydrophobicity and
molecular size of amino acids encoded by pre- and postedited codons and the editing frequency. This analysis
should allow us to assess functional significance of RNA
editing. In the second set of analyses, we calculated frequencies of 20 amino acids in two groups of genes that
encode membrane-bound and soluble proteins respectively, in both organelles. Comparison of occurrence frequencies of amino acids in the two organelles with the
editing frequencies of codons could help identify cellular
environmental factors that might have contributed to and
shaped the origin and evolution of RNA editing. Finally,
we performed correlation analyses between editing frequencies and i) nucleotide frequencies at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
and total codon positions in all genes, and ii) gene specific rates of evolution at both synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) sites. These analyses might help to
reveal the sequence environment in which editing
evolved.

Materials and methods
Taxon sampling and annotation of editing sites
The genome sequences used in this study were obtained
from the GenBank organellar genome database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ORGANELLES/
organelles.html.

Annotation of RNA editing sites was performed for individual gene sequences in accordance with editing sites
determined by original authors from cDNA sequences
across 68 chloroplast genes of Anthoceros formosae (GenBank accession no. NC_004543) [11,17] and Adiantum
capillus-veneris (GenBank accession no. AY178864)
[13,28]. For A. formosae, 11 genes were determined not to
contain either forward or reverse editing sites, while for A.
capillus-veneris forward and reverse editing sites were not
present in 16 and 49 genes respectively. The same procedure was carried out for mitochondrial genes of Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBank accession no. NC_001284)
[8,39],Beta vulgaris (GenBank accession nos. NC_002511,
DQ381444-DQ381465) [20,40], and Oryza sativa (Gen-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/43

Bank accession no. BA000029) [41]. For A. thaliana, B.
vulgaris, and O. sativa, 30 of 33, 30 of 31, and 28 of 29 analyzed genes contained C→U editing sites respectively
(U→C editing was not observed in these three genomes).
Compositional data for codons (Figures 1, 2), and amino
acids (Figure 3), were obtained from the relevant abovementioned genomes.
Multi-gene correlations of T-A and G-C distance versus
editing frequency
To examine possible correlation of nucleotide composition with RNA editing across genes of A. formosae, A. capillus-veneris, A. thaliana, B. vulgaris, and O. sativa, 2-tailed
Pearson correlation analyses were conducted. We calculated the RNA editing frequency (%) per gene as ((number
of edited sites/gene length) × 100) for first, second, third,
and total codon positions. The ratio of compositional difference between nucleotide pairs thymidine and adenosine (T-A), and cytidine and guanosine (C-G), at first,
second, third, and total codon positions, was calculated as
%(T - A)/(T + A), and %(C - G)/(C + G). Significant associations (α < 0.01) for these two variables were determined through linear regression analysis (Figures 4, 5,
Additional file 1). For analysis of RNA editing frequency
(%) versus T-A distance in 2nd codon positions, one
extreme value was present in each data set (Figure 4a, b).
These values were found to be > 3 standard deviations
from the mean (diagnosed using the Cook's Distance procedure) [44], and were omitted from the analysis.
Multi-gene correlations of rates of evolution versus editing
frequency
Gene specific synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN)
rates were estimated using CODONML implement in
PAML [45]. The underlying model was M1+F3X4 [45].
Data sets were made of 11 and 7 taxa, across 53 and 21
edited orthologous genes, representing the conserved
chloroplast and mitochondrial proteomes respectively
(Additional file 2). Branching order of taxa followed the
phylogenetic hypothesis of [46]. Genes were omitted
from the analysis if they were found to be absent in two or
more of the candidate genomes, or if multiple alignment
was spurious. The dN/dS ratio, dN, and dS were the summed
estimates across all branches of the tree (Additional file
2).

Results and discussion
All heavily edited codons encode amino acids with
significantly different hydrophobicity and molecular size
than pre-edited codons, and editing greatly increases the
hydrophobicity of proteins
Hydrophobicity and molecular size are two fundamental
physico-chemical properties of amino acids that determine protein structure and functionality, and naturally
they greatly influence amino acid replacement rate during

shown as pre-edited to edited below all codons. The vertical axis indicates Grantham index value and editing frequency.
Edited codons are grouped into nonsynonymous 1st, 2nd, and silent site changes. Asterisks indicate arbitrarily assigned values of

protein evolution [47]. In our analyses of editing frequencies of codons and the corresponding amino acid changes
involved, we found that the changes of Ser → Leu codons
represent the highest class of conversions for the 2nd
codon position editing in both chloroplasts and mitochondria, and that the changes of Ser → Phe codons and
Pro → Leu codons take the next two places in ranking by
editing frequency.
Together, these three classes account for 73–98% of the
editing events at the 2nd codon positions and 49–68% of
all editing events in the two organelles (Figures 1, 2). For
the 1st codon position editing, the changes of Arg → Trp
codons always takes the lead, with those of Arg → Cys
codons, Pro → Ser codons, and His → Tyr codons
accounting for much of the remaining editing events,
again in both organelles. All these amino acid changes
involve large differences of hydrophobicity and molecular
size as measured by the Grantham index [47] and the
Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale [48].
In addition, a similar pattern is observed across the ~15–
44 C→U editing sites found in the chloroplast genomes of
seed plants [15,22,26,30-37].
For reverse editing in chloroplasts of both A. formosae and
A. capillus-veneris, the highest class of conversions involves
three stop codons, which are converted to Arg or Gln
codons after editing at 1st codon positions, and they represent 60% and 77% of all reverse editing events at this
codon position. The significance of this class of editing on
protein functionality is self-evident. The changes of Cys →
Arg codons and Leu → Pro codons represent most remaining editing events at 1st and 2nd codon positions, respectively. There are a few other classes of codon changes
resulted from editing that also involve changes of functionally very different amino acids, but they occur at much
lower frequencies than the ones mentioned above.
Finally, there are a small number of editing events that
cause changes of functionally similar amino acids or do
not alter amino acid identity at all (Figures 1, 2). However, we found no case of heavy editing for codon substitutions that are translationally silent or involved little
change of the physico-chemical properties of amino acids.

These data clearly and consistently suggest that RNA editing plays an important functional role in minimizing
effect of mutations that would have greatly altered protein
structure through amino acid replacement involving drastic changes in hydrophobicity and molecular size. Earlier
studies have reported restoration of conserved amino
acids by editing [3-5,11,13,15,16], but the patterns, and
moreover the consistency of these patterns, in both chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of such diverse land
plants shown here are really striking, and they are based
on much more extensive data than those earlier studies.
Previously, editing in transcripts of tRNA genes, putative
Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and group II introns has also
been shown to improve structural folding or base-pairing
of those molecules [8,11,13,49,50].
Recently, Mower and Palmer [14] also found that in the
mitochondrial genome of B. vulgaris, partial editing was
much more widespread at silent sites (58.5%) than nonsilent sites (8.0%), a phenomenon that was reported earlier on single genes [51,52]. Even though partial editing
may represent editing in progress in intermediate reaction
products [53] the discrepancy in silent and non-silent sites
is more consistent with a functional explanation. Therefore, these data and observations from previous studies
unambiguously support a role of natural selection in
maintaining RNA editing activity in plant organelles [24].
Another observation we made from these data is that in
chloroplasts or mitochondria of these five plants, editing
uniformly increases protein hydrophobicity when we
examined amino acid changes of editing events using the
Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy scale of amino acids [48]. Even
in A. formosae where almost an equal number of forward
and reverse editing events were reported, this increase of
protein hydrophobicity still holds because a large proportion of reverse editing events were involved in resurrecting
internal stop codons and did not offset the hydrophobicity increase generated by forward editing events (Figure
1a, b). This phenomenon has been observed earlier in
mitochondria of A. thaliana [8] and in chloroplasts of A.
formosae [11]. Now it seems reasonable to suggest that the
phenomenon is more widespread in land plants than pre-

viously known and may apply to most RNA editing events
in organelles of most land plants. If this is the case, one
might wonder whether there is any functional reason
behind this pattern of amino acid changes mediated by
RNA editing, which may lead closer to the answer to the
puzzle of origin of RNA editing in plant organelles.
Plant organellar genomes contain disproportionately large
percentages of genes encoding membrane-bound proteins
rich in hydrophobic amino acids
After their endosymbiotic origins from cyanobacteria and
proteobacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria became
organelles in eukaryotic cells specializing in energy
metabolism. They both contain two large sets of genes,
one set encoding proteins for either photosynthesis or aer-

obic respiration and the other set encoding proteins for
information processing, namely, gene transcription, splicing and translation [27,54,55].
While proteins involved in information processing,
Calvin cycle in chloroplasts and Krebs cycle in mitochondria are soluble ones located in stroma or matrix (actually
most of the genes encoding these proteins were already
transferred to the nucleus after endosymbioses), those
involved in photon capture (photosystem proteins) and
photophosphorylation (electron carriers and ATPase) in
chloroplasts and oxidative phosphorylation (electron carriers and ATPase) in mitochondria are all embedded in
phospholipid bilayer membranes. Hence, it is clear that
these two organelles house much larger percentages of

genes encoding membrane-bound proteins than their
free-living bacterial ancestors or the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell [27,54,55].
When we examined occurrence frequencies of 20 amino
acids in two classes of proteins encoded by chloroplast
and mitochondrial genomes of A. formosae and B. vulgaris,
respectively, we found that hydrophobic amino acids such
as Leu, Ile, Phe, Val, Gly, Ser and Ala were used much
more frequently than hydrophilic ones like His, Trp, Arg
and Lys in the membrane-bound proteins (Figure 3). Leu
consistently ranked the highest among all 20 amino acids
in membrane-bound proteins of both organelles. In soluble proteins, no such pronounced bias in amino acid
usage was observed, and instead hydrophilic amino acids
such as Arg and Lys were used as much as hydrophobic
ones like Leu and Ile (Figure 3). These data fit basic physical chemistry expectation in that abundance of membrane-bound proteins in chloroplasts and mitochondria
naturally dictates frequent use of hydrophobic amino
acids in synthesizing these proteins. Since gene contents
in both organellar genomes have been evolutionarily conserved throughout land plants, the above pattern of
amino acid usage observed from the two species can be
assumed to represent the general pattern of amino acid
usage in both organelles of all land plants.
Examination of the genetic code table shows that all
codons with U at the 2nd positions encode hydrophobic
amino acids: Leu, Ile, Phe, Val, and Met. The fact that Leu
has the highest frequency of occurrence in both organelleencoded proteomes shown above (Figure 3) and is
encoded by six codons all with U at the 2nd positions can
now explain why Ser → Leu and Pro → Leu codon changes
represent the two most frequent classes of editing events
observed in our study (Figures 1, 2). These data unequivocally demonstrate the functional basis of RNA editing in
plant organellar genomes.
RNA editing sites occur more frequently in ancestrally Trich sequences, which are more abundant in genes
encoding membrane-bound proteins with many
hydrophobic amino acids
To understand the sequence environment in which RNA
editing sites evolved, we investigated correlation between
editing frequency and T-A and C-G distance across different genes. The latter measures the amount of excess of T
over A, and C over G, at certain codon positions, under the
assumption that DNA sequences in a genome evolve
towards T = A and C = G in line with the 'second parity
rule' [56]. For analyses of mitochondrial genes in A. thaliana, B. vulgaris, and O. sativa we present only the results
B. vulgaris as correlations were very similar in magnitude
and distribution (Figure 5; Additional file 1).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/43

At the 2nd codon positions, there was a positive correlation between these two parameters in the three genomes
we examined: chloroplast genomes of A. formosae and A.
capillus-veneris and the mitochondrial genome of B. vulgaris (Figures 4a, b, 5b). In other words, in genes that
showed larger T-A distances or had an excess of T over A
in their sequences, there were more editing events. This
positive correlation between editing frequency and T-A
distance was also seen at the 1st codon positions in the
mitochondrial genome (Figure 5a). As expected, a significant negative correlation between the frequency of reverse
editing and T-A distance was found at 1st codon positions
in the chloroplast genome of A. capillus-veneris (Figure 4c),
but not in that of A. formosae (Additional file 1). These
findings are not unexpected, as when there was abundance of T in a gene, one would expect more T→C mutations, which would then be fixed and later experience
C→U changes during editing because of existence of the
editing machinery. Interestingly, T-A distance for 3rd
codon positions did not show any correlation across all of
the editing frequency comparisons (Additional file 1).
The other observation we made from these data was that
the genes encoding membrane-bound proteins tend to
have larger T-A distances in their sequences and thus more
editing events (Figures 4, 5). All the genes that are at high
ends of the correlation plots encode membrane-bound
proteins, whereas most of those located at low ends of the
plots encode soluble proteins. These data are again consistent with the idea we formulated above that the high
proportion of membrane-bound proteins in plant
organelle-encoded proteomes seems to be responsible for
the prevalence of RNA editing in these two genomes.
In these correlation analyses, the sequences of mature
transcripts were used, which was based on an implicit
assumption that the edited sequence represented an
ancestral condition and the pre-edited sequence represented a derived condition. In other words, RNA editing
was assumed to have evolved recently in eukaryotic evolution. Many previous studies have indeed observed that
editing generally restores evolutionarily conserved amino
acids [3-5,11,13,15,16]. It has also been shown that only
a small number of editing sites are evolutionarily conserved across land plants in the chloroplast genome
[7,13,15,26]. The same is true in mitochondrial genomes
of A. thaliana, B. vulgaris and O. sativa; only 118 sites
(21%) of a total of 561 editing sites were shared by these
three diverse angiosperms according to our examination.
Thus, the assumption we used in the correlation analyses
seems to be valid.

increase in line with the selection constraint on genes. We

then examined possible correlation of gene specific rates
of evolution, at both synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) sites, with total RNA editing frequency. These

6). Editing frequency data included all codon positions,
and chloroplast editing data combined both forward and
reverse editing frequencies.
Initially, the correlations were confounded by the effect of
editing sites themselves, which, when included in the estimation of molecular evolutionary rates, would invoke circularity when compared against editing frequency. In
addition, frequent in-frame stop codons in many chloroplast genes interfered with the analysis. To overcome these
problems we removed editing sites from the analyses by
converting the sites to the ancestral bases.
The results obtained for both genomes suggest that frequently edited membrane-bound genes are under
stronger selection constraint than those for soluble proteins (Figure 6a, c).
We also determined that there is little relationship
between editing frequency and synonymous rates (Figure
6b, d), which is an approximation of the neutral mutation
rate.
These findings corroborate the observation of reduced
editing frequency in chloroplast genomes of two parasitic
plants [15], in which many retained genes have undergone reduced selection pressure in two different species
from the same lineages [57].
Did RNA editing in plant organellar genomes originate
under natural selection or through genetic drift?
Ever since the discoveries of RNA editing in plant organellar genomes [3-6], geneticists and molecular evolutionists
have been intrigued by the question how RNA editing
evolved in the first place [8,24-26]. Recently, Tillich et al.
[26] uncovered a pattern termed 'preferred sequence context' in which there may be a preference for pyrimidines
immediately upstream, and purines immediately downstream of an editing site. Such a pattern could be important for site recognition by the RNA editing machinery. In
an earlier study, Covello and Gray [24] insightfully dissected the complex question into three parts: 1) the origin
of RNA editing activity, 2) fixation of mutations at editable sites, and 3) maintenance of RNA editing activity.
Further, they hypothesized that genetic drift played a key
role in the first two processes and natural selection contributed to the third. Some authors hold an even more
neutralistic view on the origin of RNA editing than these
two authors, e.g., Lynch et al. [25]. Below we present our
ideas on whether RNA editing originated under natural
selection or through genetic drift based on the analyses
shown above. To make the argument easier to construct
according to strength of the data, we follow a reverse
sequence of the three steps proposed by [24].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/43

Maintenance of RNA editing activity
In agreement with [24], we think that the data are overwhelming in supporting a role of natural selection in
maintaining RNA editing activity in organelles of plants,
despite a poor understanding of its biochemical nature
until now. Without editing, replacement of so many
amino acids with very different physico-chemical properties would dramatically alter protein structures, if not rendering these proteins completely disfunctional (Figures 1,
2). The most extreme case is the chloroplast genome of A.
formosae, where forward and reverse editing events affect
more than half of the genes in the genome [11]. In addition, stop and start codons are often created or removed
by editing [11,13,14]. Likewise, tRNAs, group II introns,
and putative Shine-Dalgarno sequences that contain editing sites are also likely to be affected if editing activity is
lost [8,11,13,49,50]. Hence, we will not elaborate on this
point any further here.
Fixation of mutations at editable sites
This is the starting point where our view differs from that
of [24] on how RNA editing evolved. If mutations at editable sites were fixed through genetic drift, one would
expect their distribution patterns to be completely random when examined against codon positions, types of
codons, and kinds of genes. However, our analyses provided ample data to contradict this scenario. First, we
found editing sites to be predominantly distributed at 2nd
and 1st codon positions (Figures 1, 2), as reported by previous studies [8,10,11,13-15,20] and found here to be
correlated across genes for all taxa examined (Additional
file 1).

Second, editing affected codons that resulted in larger
hydrophobicity and molecular size changes much more
frequently than those with little change involved, and
heavy editing uniformly increased protein hydrophobicity (Figures 1, 2). In fact, there was a conspicuous lack of
heavily edited codons that were translationally silent or
involved in little change of hydrophobicity and molecular
size. Finally, editing occurred more frequently in selectively constrained genes encoding membrane-bound proteins than those encoding soluble ones because these
genes contained many U-rich codons encoding hydrophobic amino acids (Figures 4, 5, 6). These data all support a role of natural selection in fixing mutations at
editable sites and are fundamentally incompatible with a
neutralistic explanation invoking genetic drift.
One point we want to clarify is that the exact point of contention in our exposition is slightly different from that of
[24]. Our argument is broader than theirs in that we argue
that both fixation of editing sites and fixation of mutations at editable sites were achieved by natural selection.
Theoretically, upon origin of editing activity any site with

Page 12 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:43

T or C could mutate to C or T (i.e., any site with T or C
could fall into the category of "editable sites") since it
could always revert to its original condition after editing
or reverse editing. In reality, only some sites might be
allowed to do so, as there might be sequence motifs
involved in fixing editing sites as suggested by some
authors [8,11,32].
Basically, appearance of the editing machinery relaxed
selection pressure on T↔C mutations. The data on distribution of editing sites among codon positions, codons,
and genes as we presented above demonstrate clearly that
fixation of editing sites and fixation of mutations at editable sites followed a pattern of functional selection.
Origin of RNA editing activity
It has been generally recognized that origin of genes
encoding enzymes involved in RNA editing represents a
critical step in the origin of RNA editing [8,24]. To date,
the biochemical nature of the editing machinery remains
poorly characterized even though a nuclear gene encoding
a protein essential for RNA editing in chloroplasts has
been identified in Arabidopsis recently [58].

It has also been suggested that the editing machinery
probably evolved in early land plants [7,9,13,26], and
that the same machinery may be responsible for editing in
both organelles [7,9]. The fundamental question in the
whole story of evolution of RNA editing is whether origin
of the editing machinery was merely a historic accident or
it represented an evolutionary innovation of necessity.
Genetic drift was invoked for this event [24] in the face of
lack of extensive data and any obvious functional explanation. With much more data and extensive analyses, we are
inclined to take a different view here.
While we agree that the origin of RNA editing activity itself
is clearly a neutral event, we suggest that it may confer
some fitness to the organellar genomes. Otherwise, it is
inconceivable that such a mutation would have been fixed
and then maintained in land plant organelle genomes
over a course of evolution of more than four hundred million years. We offer a hypothesis below.
One basic fact we want to point out is that editing allows
a higher GC content in the genome, because forward editing permits fixation of C in the sense strand and G in the
antisense strand, and genes in organellar genomes are distributed on both strands of a circular molecule. Perhaps
there is an upper limit of AT% that is permitted in a
genome and this upper limit may have promoted fixation
of the genes encoding enzymes involved in RNA editing.
To strengthen this argument, we remind readers that the
genetic code table and start and stop codons in this table

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/43

mandate presence of all four nucleotides in a genome.
Thus, AT content in any genome certainly cannot exceed
100%, and no genome consisted of less than all four
nucleotides has ever been reported. Still, we acknowledge
that a link between the base composition of a genome and
RNA editing frequency is weak even though the two phenomena are compatible. Further, reverse editing, which
occurs frequently in the chloroplast genome of A. formosae, and is correlated strongly with the frequency of forward editing (Additional file 1), poses a problem to our
explanation. However, if organellar genomes were under
pressure, not only to reduce AT, but also to equilibrate the
overall nucleotide composition under the second parity
rule [56], then a reduction of T would also reduce A, and
an increase in C would likewise increase G. Figure 7 shows
the dramatic convergence of nucleotide composition
toward the equilibrium value (25%) during the early evolution of land plants. This pattern is observed both at
whole genome level and across conserved protein-coding
genes in both mitochondria and chloroplasts, and may
signify a 'drive' for convergence of the four nucleotides
toward the equilibrium (Figure 7, Additional file 3). One
extreme example of nucleotide convergence can be
observed in the chloroplast genome of the lycophyte
Selaginella uncinata (Figure 7a, c) [59], in which C→U
editing affects ~5% of the total coding region (S. Tsuji,
pers. comm.).
The most difficult part of the RNA editing story to explain
is the lineage-specific occurrence of a good number of
editing sites, as many of them seem to have evolved rather
recently [7, 13, 26, this study]. Colonization of land by
charophytic algal ancestors of land plants, life history
characteristics of individual species, the evolutionary history of particular lineages, lineage-specific GC contents in
organellar genomes, different substitution rates in chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of some plants, different degrees of asymmetrical distribution of genes on two
strands in the circular organellar genomes, DNA polymerase infidelity and dNTP pool imbalances, and varying
intragenomic rearrangement rates in different plant lineages may have all or partly contributed to the origin of
editing activity. Especially, the first three processes could
result in species undergoing bottleneck periods during
which genetic drift could play a large role in fixing random mutations. However, explicit data are needed to tie
any of these factors to evolution of RNA editing before a
hypothesis favoring any one of them can be seriously
entertained.

Conclusion
Our analyses of RNA editing patterns in chloroplast
genomes of the hornwort A. formosae and the fern A. capillus-veneris and mitochondrial genomes of three
angiosperms, A. thaliana, B. vulgaris and O. sativa show

that editing mostly affects functionally important and
evolutionarily conserved codon positions, codons and
genes encoding membrane-bound proteins. In particular,
occurrence of abundant RNA editing events in plant
organellar genomes may be attributed to the disproportionately large percentages of genes in these two genomes
that encode membrane-bound proteins, which are rich in
hydrophobic amino acids encoded by the 2nd position U
(T)-rich codons. These data support a hypothesis that natural selection imposed by protein functional constraints

has contributed to selective fixation of certain editing sites
and maintenance of the editing activity in plant organelles
over a period of more than four hundred millions years.
The retention of genes encoding RNA editing activity may
be driven by forces that shape nucleotide composition
equilibrium in two organellar genomes of these plants.
However, the causes of lineage-specific occurrence of a
large portion of RNA editing sites remain to be determined.

Reviewer comments
Reviewers report 1: Michael Gray, Department of
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University
In the original three-step model of Covello and Gray (On
the evolution of RNA editing. Trends Genet. 1993
Aug;9(8):265-8), it is admittedly rather difficult to cleanly
differentiate among the three steps because the model is
so obviously a co-evolutionary one (editing sites + editing
machinery). A salient point that Jobson and Qiu make
here is that "the genomic and sequence environment in
which RNA editing arose remains poorly known". That's
an important point because it somewhat constrains what
we can infer about the beginnings of plant RNA editing by
looking at the end result (i.e., contemporary organellar
genomes).
Authors' response
The original three-step model of origin and evolution of RNA
editing proposed by Covello-Gray (1993) is still a logical one in
our opinion. That is why we used it to construct the last part of
our discussion in the paper in light of the new data. We disagree with the co-evolution argument. The RNA editing activity
(or machinery) has to evolve first; otherwise editing sites will
not appear because mutations at those sites will almost certainly
be wiped out and not be fixed given the drastic phenotypic effect
they cause as demonstrated in this paper.

It also matters precisely what one means by 'originate',
and where the transition from 'origin' to 'maintenance'
occurs. Jobson and Qiu agree, as set out in the CovelloGray model, that "the origin of RNA editing activity itself
is clearly a neutral event", although they suggest that "it
may confer some fitness to the organellar genomes". I
wouldn't dispute the latter statement, especially if RNA
editing originated in a relatively AT-rich genome whose
descendents were increasingly subjected to a GC drive that
tended to make the genome more GC-rich. The hydrophobicity argument the authors make is an excellent one,
so that RNA editing would not only have the consequence
of 'correcting' obvious 'mistakes' (such as the edits that
serve to generate two essential ligands in the CuA binding
site of wheat Cox2, or creation of translation start and/or
stop signals) but a more subtle function of ensuring that

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/43

the amino acid composition of predominantly membrane-associated proteins is optimized. Even so, it's not
clear to me that Jobson and Qiu aren't already talking
about selective forces operating at the level of maintenance, rather than at the level of origin per se. As to
whether the origin of the editing machinery "was merely
a historic accident or it represented an evolutionary innovation of necessity", a primary tenet in evolutionary theory is that evolution cannot be and is not anticipatory, so
that I would find 'innovation of necessity' a difficult concept to swallow. However, once having arisen in a neutral
context, such an activity would most certainly be subject
to strong selection, for all the reasons the authors enunciate. Thus, Jobson and Qiu list a number of factors that
they suggest could have contributed to the origin of editing
activity. In contrast, I would argue that these factors would
have contributed to the maintenance of editing activity
(i.e., selection). This view would address the authors' concern about how "such machinery would have been maintained in land plant organelles over a course of evolution
of more than four hundred million years."
[On the issue of RNA editing machinery, we have to consider not only the catalytic activity (deaminase(?), at least
for C→U) but also the many trans-acting protein factors
(PPR proteins?) that evidently provide the specificity for
plant organellar editing. The evolution via multiple gene
duplications and diversifications of the interesting multigene family that encodes PPR proteins may provide clues
as to such features as the lineage-specific editing on which
Jobson and Qiu comment.
Authors' response
Although we used the three-step model, we do not have to be
confined by semantic or even conceptual details of that model
in the discussion here. The central argument here is what step
in the whole process of origin and evolution of RNA editing
arose in a neutral way. In our view, the only neutral aspect
involves the mutations that contributed to the origin of RNA
editing activity, i.e., the nature of mutational change is neutral.
Fixation of these mutations and thus the RNA editing activity,
as well as editable sites and mutations at those sites (only C <> T changes, not any others) were all under selection.

The other important point we want to add here is that while the
nature of mutational changes leading to the origin of RNA editing activity is neutral, the genomic environment in which these
mutations arose is a history-constrained one (most of that history has been under selection). To put it explicitly, these mutations must represent a subset of all possible mutations that could
possibly occur and the subset is shaped by the history of the
genome, which is a selective one.
Finally, we actually disagree with the statement "a primary
tenet in evolutionary theory is that evolution cannot be and is

Page 15 of 22

Biology Direct 2008, 3:43

not anticipatory". In our view, evolution of life on earth is proceeding in a way that is shaped by the constant inflow of solar
energy into the life system, and with sufficient knowledge, evolution of life on this planet is anticipatory.
Another issue that is not generally considered is the effect
that editing may have on the efficiency of translation of an
edited mRNA, not just its translatability per se or the properties of the final protein product. In the case of plant
mitochondria, the tRNA population is a mix of 'native'
mtDNA-encoded tRNAs inherited vertically from a bacterial ancestor, 'chloroplast-like' tRNAs expressed from
pieces of chloroplast genome that have become incorporated into the mitochondrial genome, and imported
(nucleus-encoded cytosolic) tRNAs. Because the mix of
these three types differs in diverse plants, it seems to me
that editing might play some role in re-tailoring a message
so that it is more efficiently translated by the particular
mitochondrial tRNA population in a given plant species,
an idea explicitly outlined in the case of dinoflagellate
mRNA editing [Lin S, Zhang H, Spencer DF, Norman JE,
Gray MW. Widespread and extensive editing of mitochondrial mRNAS in dinoflagellates. J Mol Biol. 2002. Jul
19;320(4):727-39].
Authors' response
This is an interesting fact to consider. However, only seed plants
have a mix of 'native' mtDNA-encoded tRNAs inherited vertically from a bacterial ancestor, 'chloroplast-like' tRNAs
expressed from pieces of chloroplast genome that have become
incorporated into the mitochondrial genome, and imported
(nucleus-encoded cytosolic) tRNAs. The mitochondrial
genomes of bryophytes lack any tRNA genes from the chloroplast genome, yet RNA editing almost certainly already occurs
in the moss Physcomitrella patens and the hornwort Megaceros
aenigmaticus mitochondria (Li, L., B. Wang, Y. Liu, & Y.-L.
Qiu. 2008. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of
the hornwort Megaceros aenigmaticus reveals a mixed mode of
conservative yet dynamic evolution in early land plant mitochondrial genomes. J. Mol. Evol. submitted). Whether the
mixed population of tRNAs has anything to do with RNA editing remains to be investigated, but sufficient data are not available at present.

Just as Covello and I considered that the RNA editing
machinery (whatever it is) would have emerged under
neutral conditions, we imagined that editable sites would
have emerged in the same way, perhaps as a result of the
GC-drive I mentioned earlier. In our model, we defined
"editable positions or sites at the level of DNA not only as
sites that are capable of being edited (the conventional
meaning of editable), but also those that already correspond to the edited sequence. In the case of plant
organelles in which C→U editing occurs, editable sites can
be recognized at the RNA level by the editing machinery

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/43

and contain either a T or a C in the DNA at the position
that is actually edited. The mutations in Step 2 would be
between Ts and Cs at these editable positions in the
DNA." Thus, not every C position in a sequence is an editable site, only those that can be recognized by the RNA
machinery. Importantly, we also argued that "Step 1, the
appearance of RNA editing activity, has the very important
effect of making these transitions neutral." We actually
did say that it "is possible to argue for a selective advantage of RNA editing, perhaps as a result of the different
nucleotide composition of DNA and RNA (i.e. higher GC
content in kinetoplastid and plant organellar DNA)",
although admittedly we went on to say that "we do not
think this suggestion can easily be supported." Given the
data now available and considering some of the arguments Jobson and Qiu make, I would be more inclined
now to accept that possibility, although again I would
point out that the distinction between 'origin' and 'maintenance' becomes quickly blurred in these models.
In regard to the authors' statement, "If mutations at editable sites were fixed through genetic drift, one would
expect their distribution patterns to be completely random when examined against codon positions, types of
codons, and kinds of genes", I would argue that's not necessarily the case if, in fact, one accepts that (i) editable
sites, by definition, are non-random because they have to
be capable of being recognized by the editing machinery
(otherwise non-editable T→C mutations would quickly
be eliminated by purifying selection), and (ii) the three
codon positions are not equally C-rich (in angiosperms, at
least, the 3rd codon position is ~40% T).
Authors' response
Regarding point (i): Once the structural and functional aspects
of the editing machinery are solved we will be in a better position to answer this question. Does the machinery have to recognize a single site? If it utilizes a sequence motif, then the
conversion will depend on the nucleotide composition of the
motif.

Jobson and Qiu present an analysis of RNA editing sites in
two chloroplast genomes and, three mitochondrial
genomes of land plants. With this, they aimed at improving our understanding of how the two editing reactions (C
to U and U to C conversion) that exist in the plant
organellar genomes could have evolved.

I have two major (I. and II.) and two minor problems (III.
and IV.) with the way this work is presented and interpreted:

Page 16 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:43

I. The authors present data that were by and large known
before, but they offer a different interpretation of these
data. The focus of their manuscript is, therefore, more
towards presenting and justifying a new hypothesis that
may help to unravel the mystery of how RNA editing in
plant organellar genomes evolved, than towards a gain of
actual and reproducible knowledge. Unfortunately, the
authors were quite biased in the presentation of their
arguments. They amply refer to the important paper of
Covello and Gray of 1993 on the evolution of RNA editing while the thorough and much more recently published broad scale analysis by Tillich et al. (2006) is
almost unmentioned. If this manuscript is to present a
valuable reference for future research, the authors should
take a broader approach in their discussion and name all
the pros and cons of the different views on a still undecided question. In my opinion, the study by Tillich et al.
(2006) has taken such a broad approach already with an
investigation of the plastid genomes of several taxa that
were similar or even identical to those used in the present
study, including also a discussion on plant mitochondrial
genomes. The authors should mention this more explicitly here and point out where their own analysis deviates
from this previous work.
Authors' response
We agree that the Tillich et al., [26] study is comprehensive
and thought provoking, and we have discussed and cited the
work in the current paper. However, in our view the 'preferred
sequence context' pattern is most likely an artifact of: 1) the
observed higher frequency of TTA (UUA) codons in organellar
genomes of plants (~X3 that of TTG in Anthoceros cp CDS), in
combination with 2) the fact that Leu is very common in transmembrane regions, and 3) UCA→UUA is one of the most common edits. Therefore, you would expect a high probability of an
A or T up or down stream of an edit site. Whether or not the
thus-far unknown editing machinery structure requires such a
recognition pattern obviously cannot yet be determined.

II. The authors state quite correctly in the introduction
that seed plants have experienced a loss of editing sites in
their plastids compared to the more primitive ferns and
hornworts. This is an important fact that should be
included in the discussion about the evolution of RNA
editing because it shows that it is an ongoing mechanism
and not a thing of the past. Unfortunately, the authors
excluded the plastid genomes of seed plants from their
analysis and also largely from their discussion. It might be
worthwhile to reconsider this decision and elaborate
more on how the fact that RNA editing of many but not
all sites seems to have been lost, fits in with their interpretation. What made some sites apparently prone to mutation at the DNA level whereas other sites still depend on a
change at the RNA level?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/43

Alternatively, the authors should drop their claim of presenting a broad scale analysis and should clearly restrict
their arguments to those organelles and taxa they analyzed.
Authors' response
The RNA edited codon frequency pattern we observed (e.g.,
often UUR) in chloroplasts of Anthoceros and Adiantum, and
mitochondria of angiosperms (involving hundreds of sites
across 29–58 genes), is similar to that found across the ~15–
44 editing sites (most in just a few genes) in seed plant chloroplast genomes. The several studies we have cited contain tables
of the edited codons. We have included in the text a statement
explaining that these codon data fit our model (e.g., mostly
UUR), and we refer the reader to the codon tables in the relevant literature.

III. Furthermore, it has been suggested by other authors
that there seems to be an inverse correlation between
mutation rates and RNA editing frequency and that,....
Authors' response
An intriguing observation. To test this hypothesis we performed
correlation analyses of editing frequency versus gene specific
rates of evolution across nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous
(dS) sites (Fig. 6), and found an inverse relationship for dN,
but not dS. So it seems that the suggested inverse relationship
is associated more with selection constraint on the gene than
with the overall mutation rate. Such an analysis can be confounded by the editing sites themselves. For this reason we
removed the editing effect from the sequences, and sampled
across a broad range of taxa.

...therefore, RNA editing originated as a mechanism to
complement the low mutation rates in the organellar
genomes.
Authors' response
This is an interesting idea; however, we wonder why it would
be the case? The genome does not 'know' that it has a low or
high mutation rate. Unless there is, for example, some environmental change that places selection pressure on the genome to
undergo changes in function, would you expect the genomic
diversity to really matter if the required enzymes are still properly produced for Mt function? For the evolution and maintenance of RNA editing sites, it seems that changes in mutation
rate only matter if mutation rate and negative selection are not
in sync. This process would best be determined through population genetic studies that consider life history and/or ecological
factors.

In this context, recent data describing an even further
reduction in RNA editing activity in the reduced plastid
genomes of some parasitic plant species which exhibit a
high rate of mutations in their plastid genome (Funk et al.

Page 17 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:43

2007, BMC Plant Biology 7:45) would be well worth discussing.
Authors' response
We thank the reviewer and have now cited the work of Funk et
al. 2008. One would expect reduced RNA-editing activity in a
genome that is in a state of functional degradation.

IV. The argument that reaching a desired GC-content (or
avoiding a presumed upper limit of % A+T) could have
promoted the fixation of the genes encoding enzymes
involved in RNA editing is very questionable as even in
the most extensive cases editing activity concerns just a relatively tiny fraction of sites compared to the total amount
of nucleotides in coding sequences and therefore cannot
have altered the G+C content by more than a fraction of
one percent.
Authors' response
As clearly outlined in the preceding sentence of the text, we do
not suggest that the editing sites themselves have altered the
nucleotide frequency, or that editing evolved to attain "desired"
nucleotide frequencies. Instead, we suggest that whole genome
processes of nucleotide compositional re-organization during
early land plant diversification (see Fig. 7) could be selectively
unfavorable within and across most of the protein coding genes
particularly regarding a loss of hydrophobicity in membranebound proteins. The editing machinery probably evolved to
maintain protein structural fidelity in the face of the compositional re-organization mentioned above. The underlying process
of nucleotide compositional re-organization could then occur in
these genes, and the rest of the genome, dependent on levels of
selective constraint (see Selaginella uncinata Fig. 7). As the
nucleotide composition stabilized in seed plants (Fig. 7), the
corresponding editing frequencies have lowered. We do not yet
have the Mt genome-transcriptome for an early land plant
(e.g., hornwort, fern). However, from single locus studies of Mt
genes it seems likely that editing site frequencies in these early
lineages will greatly exceed those found in Mt genomes of seed
plants.

This manuscript attempts to address questions regarding
the origin and evolution of RNA editing. Specifically, the
authors wish to explore whether selection played a more
prominent role than has been previously appreciated. I
have several questions and concerns regarding their conclusions which are outlined below.

1. The authors make the very strong assertion that the
functional basis of RNA editing is to increase hydrophobicity. I'd like to point out some facts that are not consistent with this assertion:

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/43

a) For reverse edits, the most heavily edited codons (that
do not fix stop codons) are those that cause large
decreases in hydrophobicity (C>R and L>P). If their assertion is correct, you'd expect that reverse edits causing large
decreases in hydrophobicity would be the least frequent,
not the most frequent. Thus, although the function of forward editing may be to increase hydrophobicity, this cannot be the case for reverse editing because it does the exact
opposite.
b) The authors claim on p. 14 that the abundance of S>L
and P>L changes clearly supports the role of editing to
increase hydrophobicity. However, why is it then that T>I
changes are one of the least frequent types of edits? On the
Kyte-Doolittle scale, T>I changes would cause a greater
increase in hydrophobicity than would S>L changes.
Increasing hydrophobicity cannot be the only driving factor.
Authors' response
We do not suggest that the role of editing is 'to increase hydrophobicity', although without editing a change in hydrophobicity
would be the 'effect'. Obviously maintenance of hydrophobicity
is under strong selection in genomes containing mostly membrane-bound protein coding genes. Instead, we have investigated the cause, or rather, the genomic environment in which
RNA editing may have arisen. In early land plants a pattern of
nucleotide re-arrangement was taking place (Fig. 7) and editing probably evolved to compensate for such changes in nucleotide frequency – possibly driven by increased C<->T
transitions.

If editing activity suddenly ceased, there would be an overall
decrease in hydrophobicity (ignoring the effects of edited stop
codons). That is not to say that a proportion of edit sites would
not 'increase' hydrophobicity – and these may well be equally
deleterious or disruptive. Our precise point is that editing
restores amino acids with the 'correct' physico-chemical properties. In the genomes we examined, this pattern is most obvious
regarding increased hydrophobicity after editing.
c) Compositional analyses have shown that there is a
strong preference for pyrimidine immediately upstream
of edited sites and a mild preference for purine immediately downstream. This preferred sequence context of edit
sites goes a long way in explaining the patterns observed
in Fig. 1, and it provides a clear explanation for the abundance of S>L and P>L changes and dearth of T>I and A>V
changes. I suspect that editing frequency would correlate
better with sequence context than with hydrophobicity
change.
Authors' response
The 'preferred sequence context' should correlate well with editing frequency, as does the frequency of NUN codons (see Addi-

Page 18 of 22

Biology Direct 2008, 3:43

tional file 1), because they are basically the same
phenomenon. In our view this does not explain anything more
regarding the origin and maintenance of RNA editing than
what we present in Figures 4 and 5. Please refer to our explanation in Reviewer 2 responses.
2. I believe the authors have failed to capture all of the
complexities in their discussion of editing's origin and
evolution. a) When thinking about the evolution of editing there are three states that must be considered. For a
forward edit site you could have 1) a genomically encoded
T, 2) an edited C, or 3) an unedited C. Clearly, at these
positions an edited C is preferable to an unedited C,
which is the simple reason for the maintenance of this
edited site by selection. But when discussing the fixation
of a new edit site, you must compare the edited C state to
the ancestral state of a genomic T. What is the selective
benefit to going from a genomic T to an edited C? Clearly
it cannot be some protein-level effect (such as hydrophobicity), because both states generate a U in the RNA leading to identical AAs.
Authors' response
We have addressed this misunderstanding above. The protein
level 'effect' is what would happen if editing suddenly ceased.
The question of how sites are fixed as edit sites in the first
instance is a question that requires population level studies. It
is probable that during the divergence of land plants, lineages
underwent periods of reduced selection pressure. The 'editing
machinery' was probably a means of fixation of selectively constrained pyrimidines under these reduced selection periods.
Once the machinery was established the edited sites could persist and be edited, persist and be unedited, or change back to
the original pyrimidine (purified).

b) Elsewhere the authors argue that the non-random distribution of editing is evidence that selection was responsible for their fixation and is incompatible with a neutral
fixation scenario. I disagree with this statement. Instead, I
would contend that the present-day distribution results
from neutral fixation coupled with differences in the
selection pressure to maintain edit sites (eg, there are so
few 3rd position edit sites because they are silent at the
protein level so there is no selection to maintain them).
Authors' response
Good points. However, the reviewer has left out an important
point in the argument: Selection on the editing machinery to
establish fixation in the first instance.

3. I don't see the big conclusions to be drawn from Fig. 4
&5 and its associated text. The first observation is that
"RNA editing sites occur more frequently in ancestrally Trich sequences." This really isn't all that surprising as the
authors also point out. I certainly don't find it necessary to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/43

see the massive figure 4 to believe this; a simple statement
would suffice. The other observation is that "genes encoding membrane-bound proteins tend to have larger T – A
distances." Isn't this simply because codons with T code
for more hydrophobic AAs than codons with A, and membrane-bound proteins require more of these T-rich
codons? For example, codons with T at the 2nd pos
(FLIMV) are very hydrophobic, whereas codons with A at
the 2nd pos (YHQNKDE) are not. Again, I don't see the
necessity of the figure or the text in the manuscript.
Authors' response
Regarding our observation; 'RNA editing sites occur more frequently in ancestrally T-rich sequences', the reviewer states
"This really isn't all that surprising". The fact that it is not surprising does not mean it is not important regarding the genomic
environment in which RNA editing evolved – Figures 4
&5were not only intended to demonstrate that a T-rich
sequence is prone to more C mutations. If this were all we
wanted to demonstrate, we would have presented the T composition against the editing frequency. The T-A distance [%(T A)/(T+A)] represents the increase or decrease of T relative to
the composition of A. We have described our reasons for its use
in the paper. As the reviewer suggested, we have reduced the
size of Figures 4 &5.

p. 5, 2nd para: For chloroplasts, quite a few other species
have been analyzed for editing, such as Phalaenopsis,
Pisum, Solanum, Oryza and Saccharum.
Authors' response
We have cited the Saccharum and Phalaenopsis papers. The
Phalaeopsis paper contains a table of all known angiosperm
chloroplast edit sites.

On the other hand, only a small fraction of Zea mitochondrial genes has been evaluated for editing, so it should not
be listed as complete.
Authors' response
We have made this clear by including "partially" as suggested
by the reviewer – "and partially for Zea mays [42]."/p. 10,
2nd para: According to Grantham, the difference in index
between Pro > Ser change is due to their "composition"
(the third property that was measured), not to their polarity or volume. Thus, the statement that all of the changes
listed in that paragraph involve a large change in hydrophobicity and molecular size is incorrect.
Authors' response
According to the hydrophobicity scales below, hydrophobic differences between Pro and Ser residues constitute a decent shift
in hydrophobicity.

In light of the Grantham [47] discrepancy we have included the
citation for Kyte-Doolittle [48] to support our statement.
Fig 3 – This figure is unnecessarily complex, making it very
difficult to compare across plots. 1) Each plot should be at
the same scale. 2) It would be much easier to compare if
the bars for each AA were side-by-side in the same chart.
3) If the figure is attempting to contrast AA content
between membrane-bound and information processing
proteins, why not simply split genes into those two categories rather than into six? 4) The authors need to state
that the amino acids are ordered by the Kyte-Doolittle
hydropathy scale, if this is indeed how they were ordered.
p. 13, 2nd para: The authors state that Leu is the most frequent "in all classes of proteins except those involved in
information processing..." In contrast to this statement,
Leu also ranks highest for Anthoceros ribosomal subunits +
polymerases (Fig 3A plot v).
Authors' response
The sentence now reads: "Leu consistently ranked the highest
among all 20 amino acids...". Also, we have simplified Figure
3 as suggested by the reviewer, with combined 'membranebound' and 'soluble' categories for both mitochondria and chloroplasts. We have also stated in the Fig 3 legend that residues
are ordered according to the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity
scale.
