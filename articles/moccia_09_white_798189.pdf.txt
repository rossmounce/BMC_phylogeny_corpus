Abstract
Background: Expressed sequence tag (EST) databases represent a valuable resource for the
identification of genes in organisms with uncharacterized genomes and for development of
molecular markers. One class of markers derived from EST sequences are simple sequence repeat
(SSR) markers, also known as EST-SSRs. These are useful in plant genetic and evolutionary studies
because they are located in transcribed genes and a putative function can often be inferred from
homology searches. Another important feature of EST-SSR markers is their expected high level of
transferability to related species that makes them very promising for comparative mapping. In the
present study we constructed a normalized EST library from floral tissue of Silene latifolia with the
aim to identify expressed genes and to develop polymorphic molecular markers.
Results: We obtained a total of 3662 high quality sequences from a normalized Silene cDNA
library. These represent 3105 unigenes, with 73% of unigenes matching genes in other species. We
found 255 sequences containing one or more SSR motifs. More than 60% of these SSRs were
trinucleotides. A total of 30 microsatellite loci were identified from 106 ESTs having sufficient
flanking sequences for primer design. The inheritance of these loci was tested via segregation
analyses and their usefulness for linkage mapping was assessed in an interspecific cross. Tests for
crossamplification of the EST-SSR loci in other Silene species established their applicability to
related species.
Conclusion: The newly characterized genes and gene-derived markers from our Silene EST library
represent a valuable genetic resource for future studies on Silene latifolia and related species. The
polymorphism and transferability of EST-SSR markers facilitate comparative linkage mapping and
analyses of genetic diversity in the genus Silene.

Background
The White Campion, Silene latifolia Poiret, a member of
the plant family Caryophyllaceae, is a dioecious herb. The
species is diploid, has a large nuclear genome size (1C =
2646 Mbp [1]) and a haploid chromosome number of 12.
Sex is determined genetically by heteromorphic sex chromosomes that were first described by Blackburn [2] and
Winge [3]. As in humans, females are homogametic, XX,
and males are the heterogametic sex, XY. The sex chromosomes are the largest chromosomes and contribute substantially to the large genome size of this species.
Although dioecy has evolved many times in different
plant lineages [4], well differentiated, heteromorphic sex
chromosomes are relatively rare in plants. Over the last
decades, Silene latifolia has become a model organism in
plant ecology and evolution. Major research avenues
include for example the evolution of heteromorphic sex
chromosomes in plants [5-7], sexual dimorphism [8,9],
plant-pathogen [10] and plant pollinator interactions
[11], invasive plant biology [12], hybridization and introgression [13], and habitat adaptation [14].
To address these ecological and evolutionary questions, a
diverse set of molecular markers has been used to date in
Silene latifolia. Only recently have the first genomic simple
sequence repeats (SSRs), also known as microsatellites,
been identified and used [15]. Current limitations of the
available markers include the problems that the widely
used AFLPs, and formerly RAPDs, are anonymous and
dominant markers. While AFLP markers have been used
successfully for linkage mapping in the related Silene vulgaris, the resulting maps derived from the maternal and
paternal parent, respectively, could not be joined into a
single, unifying map, because of the limited information
on coupling phase provided by dominant markers [16].
Similarly, a recent genome scan analysis for markers
under selection identified several AFLP markers that carried the signature of selection [17], but characterization of
the outlier markers failed to identify transcribed genes. To
overcome such limitations, we have embarked on an
expressed sequence tag (EST) project to identify transcribed genes in S. latifolia and to characterize simple
sequence repeats in these expressed genes. SSR markers
identified in EST sequences are known as EST-SSRs.
SSRs are tandemly repeated tracts of DNA composed of 1–
6 base pair (bp) long units. They are ubiquitous in
prokaryotes and eukaryotes [18], both in coding and noncoding regions, and are usually characterized by a high
degree of length polymorphism. SSR markers are useful
for a variety of applications, because of their multiallelic
nature, codominant inheritance, relative abundance, and
good genome coverage. The conservation of flanking
sequences in the vicinity of the repeat motifs often permits the genotyping of related species with a single primer

set [19]. Microsatellites have proven to be an extremely
valuable tool for genome mapping in many organisms
[20,21], but their applications span over different areas
ranging from ancient and forensic DNA studies to population genetics and conservation/management of biological resources [22]. Moreover, microsatellites, due to their
large amount of variability, have the potential to be
informative about gene and genome duplication, but only
recently have been used for these topics [23].
Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are sequenced portions of
messenger RNA. In recent years, EST projects have been
initiated for numerous plant and animal species, and have
generated a vast amount of sequence information that can
be used for gene discovery, functional genetic studies, and
marker development [24]. SSRs are relatively common in
expressed genes, mainly in the 5' and 3' untranslated
regions (UTRs). Such EST-SSRs, or genic SSRs, have several
advantages compared to other molecular markers. First,
studies in plants, animals, and fungi have shown that ESTSSRs are often more widely transferable between species,
and even genera, than genomic SSR [25,26]. Second,
because they are located in transcribed genes, the identification of outlier EST-SSRs loci in genome scan analyses
may directly identify candidates for genes under selection
[27,28]. By comparing the EST sequence to protein
sequence databases, it may further be possible to shed
light on the functional identity of the gene. Third, the
increased likelihood for cross-species amplification and
the codominant nature of EST-SSRs make them ideal
markers for comparative mapping [29,30]. Fourth, ESTSSRs often display reduced levels of polymorphism compared to genomic SSRs [31,32], which may facilitate genotyping and allow a more accurate estimates of allele
frequencies in population genetic studies compare to
hypervariable loci. Finally, the ease with which EST-SSRs
can be mapped may facilitate the identification of new
genes that are linked to traits of particular interest, such as
to the sex chromosomes in S. latifolia.
As codominant markers, EST-SSRs are expected to segregate according to Mendel's laws in crosses between individuals, and Mendelian inheritance of alleles is a
requirement for population genetic analyses. An earlier
review of microsatellite inheritance studies found that
Mendelian inheritance was almost never rejected for diploid vertebrate species [22,33]. However, there is increasing evidence of what appear to be "non-Mendelian"
patterns of inheritance of microsatellites [34,35]. Because
relatively few studies report tests for Mendelian inheritance, it is still unclear how common non-Mendelian
inheritance is. A large fraction of "non-Mendelian" ratios
of alleles in offspring of experimental crosses is apparently
caused by null alleles [36]. Potential causes of non-Mendelian behaviour include sex linkage, physical association

with genes under strong selection, transposable elements,
or processes such as non-disjunction or meiotic drive that
act during meiosis [36,37]. To use EST-SSR loci for population genetics, it is thus essential that Mendelian segregation be verified in controlled crosses.
We constructed an EST library from floral tissue of male
and female S. latifolia with the aim to identify expressed
genes and to develop polymorphic molecular markers.
Floral tissue was chosen because we are interested in the
genetic basis of sex determination in dioecious Silene, the
evolution of plant sex chromosomes, and floral isolation
between S. latifolia and the closely related S. dioica.
In this paper we first describe our EST library and show
that this library is a rich source of genes that may be
involved in flower development and the control of floral
trait differences between male and female plants, but also
between S. latifolia and related species. Second, we
describe a set of newly characterized EST-SSR loci and provide information about their polymorphism, Mendelian
inheritance, and transferability to other Silene species.
Finally, we report on the utility of these markers for comparative mapping.

Results
EST library characterization
Random 5' sequencing of our directional cDNA library
resulted in 3662 high quality sequences with an average
length of 609 nucleotides. Assembly using TGICL resulted
in 3105 unigenes, consisting of 2673 singlets and 432
contigs. Average unigene length (625.5 bp) was shorter
than average contig length (682.6 bp). Most contigs
(80.6%) contained 2 ESTs. Only 25 contigs (5.8%) contained 4 or more sequences and the largest number of
sequences per contig was 7 (Table 1).

During pre-processing, all sequences were searched for the
tags identifying three different pools. Of the 3662 high
quality sequences, 1342 were from pool A (petals of male
and female flowers), 1385 from pool B (male buds and

In 92 sequences (2.5%) the adaptor could not be
retrieved. Despite the small number of ESTs per contig,
most contigs (76%) consisting of four or more ESTs contained sequences from more than one tissue pool. Only 6
such contigs were made up by sequences from a single tissue pool. Of these, 4 contigs combined sequences from
pool B, and one contig each combined sequences from
pools A and C.
EST annotation and functional classification
We used BLASTX to annotate our Silene latifolia unigene
sequences. 2271 (73%) of the unigenes matched genes in
other species with an expectation value of 1e-10 or better
in a search against the NCBI nr protein database (release
June 2008). Best hits in BLASTX searches were mainly to
Vitis vinifera (940 hits, 30.3% of all unigenes), Arabidopsis
thaliana (317 hits, 10.2%), Populus trichocarpa (238 hits,
7.7%), and Oryza sativa (98 hits, 3.2%). Out of our 3105
unigenes, only twenty-six had a best hit with a Silene species (0.8%). Several unigenes identified in our EST library
have been identified as putative homologs of Arabidopsis
genes that are implicated in floral development (Table 2).

Gene Ontology (GO) [38] annotation was performed
with BLAST2GO. In total, 1837 unigenes were annotated
with 7215 GO terms. At least one Biological Process was
proposed for 1308 unigenes, a Cellular Component for
1404 unigenes, and 1306 unigenes were annotated with
at least one Molecular Function. There were 863
sequences with annotations for all three GO categories
(Biological Process, Cellular Component and Molecular
Function) and 1318 unigenes had annotations for at least
2 categories. The relative frequencies of GO hits are shown
in Fig. 1.
Characterization of microsatellite motifs
We identified 255 sequences containing one or more microsatellite motifs in the library screen. The observed frequencies of di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-repeats were
16.8% (43), 64.3% (164), 15.6% (40), 5.4% (14) and
5.4% (14), respectively. The 43 di-nucleotide repeat
sequences consisted of (TC)/(GA)n, (AT)/(TA)n and (TG)/
(CA)n. Among the di-nucleotide repeats there was a distinct predominance of (TC)/(GA)n repeats (72%, 31/43),
with low frequencies of other di-nucleotide repeats, (AT)n
and (TG)n (16.2%, 7/43 and 11.6%, 5/43 respectively).
164 tri-nucleotide repeat motifs were recognized, which
represents the most frequent repeat unit (64.3%, 164/
255). Their motifs included (ATA)/(TAT)n, (AGC)/
(GCT)n, (AGA)/(TCT)n, (AAC)/(GTT)n, (ATC)/(GAT)n,
(CCA)/(TGG)n, (GTA)/(TAC)n, (GGA)/(TCC)n, (CGC)/
(GCG)n, and (GAC)/(GTC)n. Of these, the motif (ATA)/
(TAT)n was the most frequent (29.2%, 48/164), followed
by (AGA)/(TCT)n (23.1%, 38/164), (ATC)/(GAT)n

motifs were (CAAA)/(TTTG)n, (ATTT)/(AAAT)n, (ATCA)/
(TGAT)n, (AATT)/(AATT)n, but their frequency was low
(12.4%, 5/40). We identified 5 and 6 different penta or
hexa-nt SSR motifs, most of them were found only once.
Identification of polymorphic markers
Among the 255 SSR-containing unigenes we selected 106
that had long enough sequences flanking the SSR to
design primer pairs. 74 primer pairs that were not likely to
form internal secondary structures were designed and
tested by amplifying template DNA from S. latifolia. After
some optimization, 61 of these primer pairs were successfully amplified. The other 13 primer pairs failed. Among
the working primer pairs, 49 produced PCR products of
the expected size, 10 produced PCR fragments that were
considerably longer than expected and the rest produced
multiple bands. Finally, about 66% of the primers that
were initially designed appeared to amplify the expected
product as judged from agarose-gel electrophoresis. However, when these PCR products were subsequently analyzed on a capillary sequencer, some of them were not
scorable due to excessive "stutter bands". Finally, 30
primer pairs remained (Additional file 1).

In order to obtain information on the putative identities
and functions of the genes containing EST-SSRs, the corresponding unigene sequences were subjected to BLASTX
searches against the Arabidopsis thaliana Refseq database.
About 90% of EST-SSRs matched Arabidopsis genes with an
expectation value of 1e-10 or better (see Additional file 2).

The position of the SSR motifs was unambiguously identified for 24 out of the 30 loci. For five loci, the two methods used to infer the SSR position disagreed and for one
locus, no similarity was found to known Arabidopsis genes.
Of the 24 loci, 11 are located in protein coding sequences
(CDS), 11 are located in the 5' UTR, and 2 in the 3' UTR.
The level of polymorphism as estimated from the polymorphic information content (PIC) was higher in loci
located in untranslated regions (5' and 3' UTRs) than in
loci located in coding regions (PIC = 0.656 vs PIC = 0.543,
respectively).
EST-SSR Polymorphism
We surveyed the allelic variability of the markers by genotyping individuals from a natural population of S. latifolia.
Most microsatellite loci showed allelic polymorphism.
The number of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 12 in the
panel of 30 individuals, and the PIC values ranged from
0.27 to 0.81 with a mean value of 0.55. The mean number
of alleles per locus was 6.65 alleles, the mean observed
heterozygosity was 0.50, and the mean expected heretozygosity was 0.63 (see Additional file 1). A small proportion
of the microsatellite markers (13.7%) amplified more
than two alleles in some individuals, indicating that these
primer pairs may be amplifying duplicated loci. Duplicated loci can share alleles of the same length so that alleles cannot unambiguously be assigned to one locus or the
other. Therefore we were hesitant to use these loci for population genetic analysis. However, it is possible to use
these duplicated loci in other applications such as gene
mapping or the study of gene duplication. Additional file
1 lists the repeat unit found in the original EST sequence,
together with the primer sequences that were used to PCR
amplify the microsatellite loci; additionally, allele size
ranges, genomic position of SSR and the number of alleles
observed among the samples studied are given for each
locus. Exact tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
revealed that the majority of these microsatellites were in
HWE, but 6 loci (Locus SL_eSSR02, Locus SL_eSSR06,
Locus SL_eSSR11, Locus SL_eSSR16, Locus SL_eSSR17

and Locus SL_eSSR24) showed significant departure from
HWE (p < 0.002) after Bonferroni correction (see Additional file 1). Of these, 5 loci revealed a heterozygote deficit and one a heterozygote excess.
Segregation analysis
Of the 30 EST-SSR loci developed in this study, 25 were
polymorphic in an experimental interspecific cross
between S. latifolia and S. dioica. These loci were tested for
Mendelian segregation in 90 progeny. Null alleles were
deduced at some loci where unexpected progeny genotypes could be explained only by null alleles in the parents. As indicated by the X2 contingency test, most SSRs
segregated in Mendelian ratios, but 7 loci showed significant segregation distortion after Bonferroni correction for
multiple testing (Table 3).
Transferability of EST-SSR loci
Among the 30 microsatellite primers tested for amplification in other Silene species, 93% amplified a product of
expected size in S. dioica, 90% in S. diclinis, 63% in S.
nutans, 57% in S. acaulis and 47% of the primer pairs were
transferable to S. vulgaris, S. colpophylla and S. ciliata
(Table 4).

Utility of EST-SSRs for mapping
Linkage mapping based on 25 markers polymorphic in an
interspecific cross between S. latifolia and S. dioica led to
the identification of 6 linkage groups when a LOD value
of 3.0 was employed. These 6 linkage groups encompassed 17 EST-SSRs. 8 markers remained unlinked. These
unlinked markers are located on other linkage groups that
harbour only one or few weakly linked EST-SSRs, as indicated by the fact that in combination with dominant AFLP
markers, all EST-SSR markers map to one of 12 linkage
groups (unpublished results), which corresponds to the
haploid chromosome number in dioecious Silene.

Discussion
The White Campion, Silene latifolia, has long been used as
a model organism for a wide range of ecological and evolutionary questions. Despite this great interest in the species, no systematic attempts have been made to
characterize large numbers of genes across the species'
genome and to identify gene-specific markers that can be
used for a wide range of research questions and can also
be transferred to closely related species. Our EST library
and the molecular markers derived from this library may
therefore provide a valuable molecular tool for further
studies on this ecological model organism.

EST library annotation
Our normalized floral cDNA library displayed a low
observed redundancy and was efficient to identify a large
number of previously uncharacterized genes in S. latifolia
that represent all major categories in the Gene Ontology
(GO) classification. This confirms that even a limited EST
dataset represents a valuable resource for molecular nonmodel organisms [39]. The great majority of unigenes
identified in the present study (73%) had a significant
similarity with genes in other plant species. Most similarities were found to Vitis vinifera, Arabidopsis thaliana, and
Populus trichocarpa. These species are all core eudicots and
belong to the rosids, whereas Silene belongs to the core
eudicot clade Caryophyllales [40]. The fact that similarities were most often found to these particular plant species is a consequence of the fact that all these species have
fully sequenced genomes and large EST databases, and
does not reflect their phylogenetic proximity to Silene.
Similarities with genes from these species provided some
insights into the identities of Silene genes. However,

BLAST-based annotations, especially of short EST
sequences, can be misleading when hits are due to
domain homologies, rather than homology to orthologs
[39].
The few hits (0.8%) to Silene sequences available in GenBank reflect the lack of sequence information for this
genus and emphasizes the value of the EST dataset developed in the present study.
The great majority of contigs with of more than four EST
reads combined sequences derived from more than one
tissue. Of the 6 contigs for which all ESTs were derived
from a single tissue, four contained sequences expressed
in male flower buds (pool B). Two of these contigs had
strong similarities with genes that were previously found
to be expressed exclusively in males. One contig had high
similarity (8e-12) to MROS4 [41] and another one was
similar (7e-12) to Men-1 [42]. To what extend the other
genes that were found to be expressed in either males

(pool B, 2 more contigs) or females (pool C, 1 contig) in
the present study are indeed sex-specifically expressed
remains to be tested experimentally.
Floral development genes
We identified several unigenes that are putative homologs
of Arabidopsis genes that are involved in floral development (Table 2). These include genes that perceive or
respond to environmental signals such as EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4), and stress enhanced protein 2 (Sep2),
and transcription factors that control floral development
such as SEPALLATA 2 (SEP2), MYB domain protein 21
(MYB21), and zinc finger family proteins.

The transition to flowering in plants is regulated by environmental factors such as temperature and light. Daylength sensing involves an interaction between the relative length of day and night, and endogenous rhythms
that are controlled by the plant circadian clock. The gene
EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4) is involved in photoperiod
perception and circadian regulation [43]. The expression
of stress enhanced protein 2 is induced specifically by
light stress and is specific, because other physiological
stresses such as cold, heat, or salt do not promote accumulation of Sep2 transcripts [44].
SEPALLATA (SEP) genes form a subfamily of MADS-box
transcription factors that are critical for a number of developmental processes. In particular, the SEPALLATA (SEP)
genes play an important role in controlling the development of floral organs in flowering plants. In Arabidopsis
thaliana, SEP1, SEP 2, SEP3 and SEP4 are required for
specifying the identity of all four whorls of floral organs,
and for the floral meristem determination [45,46]. MYB
proteins are transcription factors that are characterize by a
MYB (DNA-binding) domain. MYB21 is specifically
expressed in flowers in A. thaliana and directly activates
the expression of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid
metabolism [47].
Analysis of expression patterns of putative homologs of
these Arabidopsis genes in S. latifolia will reveal to what
extend their functions are conserved in Silene and may
help to elucidate their roles in Silene flower development.
SSR Frequency and distribution
In this study we found trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) to be
the most common SSR type in ESTs of Silene latifolia. This
is in agreement with a majority of studies that report TNRs
as the most abundant class of SSRs in plant ESTs [48,49],
in contrast to recent studies in Actinidia [50] and Picea species [51] wherein dinucleotide repeats (DNRs) were
found to be the most abundant class of EST-SSRs. Interestingly, DNRs have been reported to be the most abundant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/243

SSRs in ESTs of many animal species such as medaka, Fundulus, zebrafish, and Xiphophorus [52].
Among the trimeric motifs, (ATA)n, (AGA)n and (ATC)n
were the most common (70%) in S. latifolia. In rice, 60%
of EST-derived microsatellite sequences were (CCG)n,
(ACG)n, (AGG)n and (ACC)n [53], and in maize (CCG)n
and (AGG)n were most abundant [54]. (CCG)n was also
the most common motif in sugarcane [55]. In contrast,
the motifs (ATC)n and (AAG)n represented 60% of all microsatellite motifs of the dicotyledon Arabidopsis [56]. The
motif (AAT)n was found to be rare in barley, rice, maize
and sugarcane, as well as in Arabidopsis, and was not found
here in S. latifolia. A possible reason for its rarity is that
TAA-based variants code for stop codons have a direct
effect on protein synthesis [54]. Of the dimeric repeats,
the motif (TC)n was the most common in our dataset with
76% of dinucleotide repeats, whereas no (CG)n motif was
found.
In plants, TC and CTT repeats (referred to as AGA in this
study) were found to be typical of transcribed regions and
to occur with high frequency in the 5' UTRs. It has also
been suggested that the high level of the (TC)n motif is due
to its translation into Ala and Leu, depending on the reading frame [57]; Ala and Leu are present in proteins at high
frequencies of 8% and 10%, respectively. (AT)n repeats
have been reported to be very abundant in the genomic
sequences of plants [58], but they were relatively rare
(16%) in our Silene EST sequences. The deficiency of ATSSRs in our EST sequences is in accordance with reports
from rice [53], Arabidopsis [56] and maize [54]. Overall,
GC-rich SSR motifs were less frequent in Silene ESTs than
GC-poor motifs. This was most evident in the relative
abundance of (GA)/(AGA)n and deficiency of (CG)/
(CCG)n repeat motifs among the DNARs/TNRs, respectively, identified in this study. Interestingly, a similar difference in SSR motif in ESTs has been reported earlier, and
seems to be a common feature of the dicotyledon species
[56,59].
EST-SSR marker polymorphism
The majority of S. latifolia EST-SSRs generated high-quality amplification products, suggesting that ESTs are ideally
suited for specific primer design. In this study, PCR amplification was successful for 82% of the primer pairs
designed from ESTs. Among the primer pairs that amplified, we noticed that in some cases the amplification product was substantially larger than expected from the EST
sequence analysis. This increase in product size was most
likely due to the presence of introns and large insertions
in the corresponding genomic sequence. Other primer
pairs (18%) failed to amplify a PCR product. Generally,
inconsistent amplification or amplification failure of ESTSSR loci may arise as a result of factors such as the pres-

Page 8 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:243

ence of introns that are too large for efficient amplification, the use of poor quality sequences for primer design,
and mutational substitutions, insertions or deletions
within the priming site [60].
Levels of polymorphism detected with EST-SSRs have
been compared in several studies to those revealed by
genomic SSRs. In most cases, the latter were found to be
more polymorphic [61]. Our EST-SSRs revealed relatively
low levels of polymorphism in the S. latifolia population
surveyed as indicated by the average number of alleles per
locus (6.65) and the average He (0.63) and Ho (0.50). A
study based on genomic SSRs [15] detected substantially
higher levels of polymorphism in SSRs, with 25–43 alleles
per locus and He between 0.86 to 0.97 and Ho between
0.23 to 1.0.
All polymorphic loci developed in the present study were
tested for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE). We observed significant deviations from HWE at
six loci (20%) after Bonferroni correction in a natural S.
latifolia population. The fact that only a minority of surveyed loci revealed deviations from HWE indicates that
the investigated population overall is in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, and that deviations at individual loci are
most likely due to locus-specific effects, and not due to
biological factors such as inbreeding or genetic drift,
which would affect all loci.
Null alleles are known to be a major cause of heterozygote
deficiencies observed in SSR analyses of animal and plant
populations [62]. Null alleles most commonly arise from
point mutations in the sequence flanking the repeat
region [63], which reduces or prevents primer annealing.
Null alleles can also be generated via differential amplification of size-variant alleles [64]. Due to the competitive
nature of the PCR process, shorter alleles often amplify
more efficiently than larger ones, such that only the
smaller of two alleles may be detected from a heterozygous individual. In general, null alleles complicate the
interpretation of microsatellite data because of the
reduced level of observed heterozygosity [62]. Problems
with null alleles can be ameliorated by improvements in
primer design [37]. In addition to these technical problems, several population genetic phenomena may give the
false impression that microsatellite null alleles are present
in a given study. Biological factors such as Wahlund effect
or inbreeding, for example, can cause significant heterozygote deficits relative to HWE that might be misconstrued
as evidence for null alleles [65]. The use of a large number
of SSR loci may help to distinguish between locus-specific
problems and biological processes leading to heterozygote deficiencies.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/243

A further potential cause of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations involves sex-linkage. The divergence
between the X and Y chromosomes in species with heterogametic males (or of W and Z chromosomes in species
with heterogametic females) often leads to the phenomenon that only one allele is amplified in the heterogametic
sex, although sex chromosomes typically evolved from
ancestral autosomes. Thus, if sex-linkage remains unrecognized at a locus, an associated locus-specific heterozygote deficit may be wrongly interpreted as indicative of
null alleles. Indeed, one locus that maps to linkage group
1, which corresponds to the sex chromosome, reveals significant deviation from HWE after Bonferroni correction.
Mendelian segregation of EST-SSR markers
We used plants from an experimental cross to assess Mendelian inheritance of our EST-SSR loci. 28% of the loci
that were polymorphic in the cross showed a significant
deviation from expected Mendelian ratios after Bonferrroni correction (p < 0.002). Segregation distortion
may be caused by technical problems, including null alleles, but may also have a biological basis, such as gametic
selection, embryogenesis, seed set or sex linkage. In addition, segregation distortion may occur as a consequence of
the divergence between the two species. Although markers
displaying segregation distortion may complicate linkage
analysis [66], distorted loci can often be mapped, and the
mapping of distorted markers may help to identify genes
that have important biological functions [67,68].
Transferability of EST-SSR markers
By virtue of the sequence conservation of transcribed
regions of the genome, a significant portion of the primer
pairs designed from EST-SSRs is expected to function in
distantly related species. Transferability of EST-derived
markers over different taxonomic levels has been demonstrated earlier [55,69]. In our study, the majority of our 30
EST-derived SSR loci from S. latifolia revealed cross-species
amplification with alleles of comparable sizes in one or
several of the tested Silene species. As expected, the transferability of the markers was higher for S. dioica and S.
diclinis than for the other species, because of their close
phylogenetic relatedness to S. latifolia. High amplification
success suggests that the flanking regions of these loci are
sufficiently conserved, and that these loci can be used for
comparative analyses of genetic diversity in the genus
Silene. In addition, these genic SSRs are good candidates
for the development of conserved orthologous markers
for linkage mapping and QTL analyses in different Silene
species [16,70].
EST-SSR markers for comparative mapping
The abundance of microsatellites in transcribed regions of
the genome and the level of polymorphism of these markers make EST libraries a valuable source of markers for

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:243

genetic mapping. The high proportion of informative
markers (83%) found in the present study for an interspecific cross between two closely related dioecious Silene
species, and the identification of 6 out of 12 expected linkage groups, including the sex chromosome, reveal that
these EST-SSR loci are valuable markers for linkage mapping in S. latifolia and related dioecious species.
Perhaps the most important feature of the EST-SSR markers for comparative linkage mapping is that they are transferable also to more distantly related species. The value of
the transferability of such markers to related species for
the purpose of comparative mapping has been demonstrated in several studies in wheat, rye and rice [30,71].
Our study shows that 93 to 47% of EST-SSR primer pairs
designed for S. latifolia will also yield amplicons in S. dioica, S. diclinis, S. vulgaris, S. colpophylla and S. ciliata and
thus provide valuable markers for comparative linkage
mapping in these species. With these markers, new
insights can, for example, be gained into the independent
evolution of sex chromosomes from ancestral autosomes
in the genus Silene, a topic that has recently received great
interest [72,73]. Moreover, the EST-SSR loci that were
found to map to the S. latifolia sex chromosomes represent a set of newly identified sex-linked genes that are now
being used to further explore the divergence between the
X and Y chromosomes in this species.

Conclusion
Only few microsatellite markers have to date been
described in the literature for Silene species [15,74] and all
of these are genomic SSRs for which no information on
transferability to other species is available. Thus, the set of
30 EST-SSR markers reported in this study represents an
important resource for future studies on S. latifolia and
other species of this highly diverse genus. Most notably,
these EST-SSRs will allow to perform comparative analyses of population structure, help with the identification of
loci under selection in population genomic studies, and
facilitate comparative linkage mapping in the genus
Silene.

Methods
Library construction and EST isolation
A cDNA library was constructed from polyA+ RNA isolated
from flower buds and open flowers of male and female S.
latifolia grown in a greenhouse at ETH Zurich under longday light conditions. Plants were grown from seeds collected in a natural population in Switzerland (site Leuk in
Valais, Switzerland; 46°19'/7°39'). Floral tissue was collected at 10 pm in the dark. At this time, flowers are fully
open and emit a strong scent [10]. Three tissue pools were
prepared. Pool A included petals from fully open male
and female flowers; pool B consisted of male buds and
flowers; pool C contained female buds and flowers. RNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/243

was isolated using TriFast (PeqLab), stored in liquid nitrogen, and sent to GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany) for
library construction. There, first-strand cDNA synthesis
was performed with M-MLV-RNase H- reverse transcriptase and a different oligo (dT)-Not I primer for each
cDNA pool. Each one of these primers contained at the 3'
end a specific 3 bp tag: pool A contained the tag 'TCG',
pool B the tag 'GAG', and pool C the tag 'ATG'. Resulting
cDNA was amplified with 10 cycles of LA-PCR. To normalize cDNA, one cycle of denaturation and reassociation
of the cDNA was performed. Reassociated ds cDNA was
separated from the remaining ss cDNA by passing the
mixture over a hydroxyapatite column. After hydroxyapatite chromatography, the ss cDNA was amplified with 12
LA-PCR cycles. For directional cloning, the normalized
cDNA was first subjected to a limited exonuclease treatment to generate Eco RI overhangs at the 5' ends and was
then cleaved with Not I. Prior to cloning, the cDNA was
size fractionated. For this purpose, the cDNA was separated on a 1.3% agarose gel. Following elution of cDNAs
larger than 0.5 kb, the cDNA was ligated into Eco RI and
Not I cleaved pBS II SK (+) vector. Ligations were electroporated into Phage T1 resistant TransforMax™ EC100™
(Epicentre) electro-competent cells. After transformation,
glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% (v/v)
and the cells were frozen at -70°C in aliquots. After a
freezing thawing cycle, the titer of the library was determined to be about 2900 cfu per μl bacterial suspension,
which corresponds to about 7.5 × 106 recombinant
clones.
The library was plated out on LB agar plates with Xgal
blue/white screening and 0.1% ampicillin, and grown
overnight. Positive colonies were picked and grown overnight in 1.5 mL medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The
colony stock was then divided in three parts: 200 μl were
divided in two plates and archived in LB broth with 15%
glycerol at -80°C; the remainder was used for plasmid
DNA isolation by using an automated system (BioRobot
3000, Qiagen) and a DirectPrep96 BioRobot kit (Qiagen).
Sequence reactions were performed on the plasmid templates by using the Big Dye Terminator v3.1 chemistry
(Applied Biosystems) and M13 forward and reverse primers. Sequences were run on an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
EST processing
We performed a total of 4416 sequencing runs. Raw
sequences were extracted from the chromatograms using
the PHRED software [75]. Vector, adaptors and potential
E. coli contaminant sequences were removed using SeqClean [76], with an extra-check performed with CrossMatch [77]. Poly-A sequences were detected and trimmed
using SeqClean. Low-complexity regions and repetitive
elements were masked using RepeatMasker[78]. This pre-

processing phase resulted in 3662 clean EST sequences
longer than 100 nucleotides. They were assembled into
3105 « unigenes » (432 contigs + 2673 singlets) using the
TGICL software [79] run with default parameters. These «
unigenes » represents putative different transcripts from
Silene latifolia floral tissue. All EST sequences have been
submitted to GenBank [GenBank: GH291501 to
GH295162].
EST annotation and function
Unigenes were compared to the NCBI nr (non-redundant) protein database (June 2008) using the BLASTX
algorithm and NCBI nr nucleotide database using the
BLASTN algorithm. The BLAST2GO [80] annotation tool
was used to assign most probable GO terms to the contigs
and singlets. Prot4EST [81] (without DECODER) was
used to predict CDS. The INTERPROSCAN web service at
EBI was used to compare those predicted CDS with
known protein motifs and domains.
Identification of EST-SSRs
The EST library was searched for sequences containing
SSRs using Tandem Repeat Finder software [82], available
at http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html. All 3105 unigenes
were analyzed. Sequences containing di- and tri-nucleotides with at least 5 perfect repeat units, and tetra, penta
and hexa-nucleotides with 4 perfect repeat units, were
selected for marker development. The mononucleotide A/
T repeat was not considered, because of the difficulty of
distinguishing real microsatellites from polyadenylation
products.
EST-SSR marker development
Primer pairs flanking repeats were designed using
PRIMER3 [83]http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/ We used the
approach of Schuelke [84] to label PCR products with a
fluorescently labelled universal primer, in order to reduce
costs. Thus, PCR reactions were performed with three
primers: one primer of the microsatellite primer pair was
designed with a universal M13 tail attached at its 5' end,
the second primer was a normal locus-specific reverse
primer, and the third primer was a fluorescently labeled
M13 primer. PCR amplifications were conducted in 10 μl
reaction volumes containing 10 ng of template DNA, 2
mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM fluorescently labeled
M13 primer, 0.2 μM reverse primer, 0.05 μM forward
primer (with M13 tail) and 0.05 U Promega GoTaq. The
polymerase chain reaction cycling profile was 94°C for 5
min; 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 45 s, 72°C for
45 s, followed by 8 cycles 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 45 s,
72°C for 45 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
Two PCR products with differences in dye and amplicon
size were combined and diluted 1:10. One μl of the
diluted sample was added to 9.1 μl of loading mixture
made up with 9 μl HiDi formamide and 0.1 μl Genescan

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/243

500 LIZ internal size standard (Applied Biosystems). Samples were run on automated DNA sequencer ABI PRISM
3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Output
files were analyzed using GeneMapper v4.0 (Applied Biosystems).
Polymorphism, SSR position and segregation analyses
Successfully amplifying loci were tested for polymorphism by genotyping 30 individuals of S. latifolia from a
natural population in Leuk, Switzerland [17]. This population contains several hundred individuals that grow in
field margins and adjacent fallow land and meadows.
Seeds of 30 individuals per population were collected
along transects. Care was taken to collect seeds from spatially separated plants (at least 1 m apart) to avoid resampling individuals. Seeds from these seed families were
grown in a greenhouse in Zurich. One randomly selected
individual per seed family was later used for the analysis
of EST-SSR polymorphisms. Voucher individuals are
deposited in the herbarium Z/ZT at ETH Zurich under the
accession number AW3746. The analyses of polymorphism including allele diversity, observed (HO) and

expected (HE) heterozygosities, Fis, as a measure of heterozygote deficiency or excess [85] and the exact test for
deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were
performed using Genepop v3.4. [86], available online at
http://www.biomed.curtin.edu.au/genepop/index.html.
Polymorphic information content (PIC), a measure of
allelic diversity at a given locus, was calculated as follows:

PIC = 1 − ∑ f i2

, where fi is the frequency of the ith allele

[87]. To determine whether the SSR motifs were located in
protein-coding sequence (CDS) or in untranslated regions
(5' or 3' UTRs) we used ESTScan2 [88,89]http://
www.ch.embnet.org/software/ESTScan2.html. In addition, we compared the SSR position with the CDS prediction obtained with Prot4EST and compared the results of
both approaches.
The segregation of alleles at 30 microsatellite loci was
compared with expected Mendelian ratios by a X2 goodness-of-fit analysis. Segregation ratios were calculated for
90 F2 individuals. These F2 plants were the result of a
cross between two F1 individuals that were obtained from
an interspecific cross between S. latifolia and S. dioica. The
S. latifolia individual used in the initial cross was from
Lyon, France, and the S. dioica individual from Davos,
Switzerland.
Cross-species amplification
To assess the transferability of our EST-SSR markers, we
tested their amplification in four individuals each of 7 furPage 11 of 14

ther Silene species. S. dioica and S. diclinis are both dioecious and close relatives of S. latifolia. Silene acaulis, S.
ciliata, S. nutans and S. vulgaris are more distantly related,
gynodioecious species. Silene colpophylla is a further dioecious species but is more distantly related to S. latifolia.
Dioecy has evolved independently from S. latifolia in S.
colpophylla [73]. Samples of these species were obtained
from Davos in Switzerland for S. dioica, Valencia in Spain
for S. diclinis, Leuk in Switzerland for S. latifolia, Davos in
Switzerland for S. acaulis, Sierra de Guadarrama in Spain

Linkage mapping
Linkage mapping was performed using JoinMap 4.0 [90]
based on genotype data from the same 90 F2 individuals
used in the segregation analysis (above). Markers with
LOD scores of ≥ 3 were assigned to the same linkage
group. Map distances in centiMorgans (cM) were calculated using Kosambi's mapping function. To identify linkage groups that correspond to the sex chromosomes, we
used male sex as morphological marker for the Y chromosome and a microsatellite locus isolated from an Xderived BAC clone (unpublished results) to identify the X
chromosome, here called linkage group 1.

Authors' contributions
AW and MDM conceived the study and collected samples.
MDM sequenced part of the cDNA library. CO and GM
analyzed and annotated the sequences. MDM identified
SSRs in the EST library, designed primers and tested them.
AW and MDM wrote the manuscript with the support of
CO and GM. All authors have read and approved the final
manuscript.
