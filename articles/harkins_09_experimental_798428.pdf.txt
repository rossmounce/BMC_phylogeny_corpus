Abstract
Background: Despite the demonstration that geminiviruses, like many other single stranded DNA viruses, are evolving at rates
similar to those of RNA viruses, a recent study has suggested that grass-infecting species in the genus Mastrevirus may have codiverged with their hosts over millions of years. This "co-divergence hypothesis" requires that long-term mastrevirus
substitution rates be at least 100,000-fold lower than their basal mutation rates and 10,000-fold lower than their observable
short-term substitution rates. The credibility of this hypothesis, therefore, hinges on the testable claim that negative selection
during mastrevirus evolution is so potent that it effectively purges 99.999% of all mutations that occur.
Results: We have conducted long-term evolution experiments lasting between 6 and 32 years, where we have determined
substitution rates of between 2 and 3 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year for the mastreviruses Maize streak virus (MSV) and Sugarcane
streak Réunion virus (SSRV). We further show that mutation biases are similar for different geminivirus genera, suggesting that
mutational processes that drive high basal mutation rates are conserved across the family. Rather than displaying signs of
extremely severe negative selection as implied by the co-divergence hypothesis, our evolution experiments indicate that MSV
and SSRV are predominantly evolving under neutral genetic drift.
Conclusion: The absence of strong negative selection signals within our evolution experiments and the uniformly high
geminivirus substitution rates that we and others have reported suggest that mastreviruses cannot have co-diverged with their
hosts.

Background
It is becoming increasingly apparent that single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) viruses such as the anelloviruses [1-3],
geminiviruses [4-9], parvoviruses [10-12] and microviruses [13,14] are probably evolving as rapidly as many
RNA viruses [15]. While the inherent infidelities of RNA
polymerases and reverse transcriptases drive the high rates
of evolution seen in RNA viruses, all known ssDNA
viruses replicate using presumably high-fidelity host DNA
polymerases. It is surprising, therefore, that the basal
mutation rates of ssDNA viruses are orders of magnitude
higher than those of their hosts [15].
The best supported, non-exclusive theories that have so far
been put forward to explain discrepancies between basal
mutation rates of ssDNA viruses and their hosts are that:
(1) when in a ssDNA state the genomes of these viruses
are subject to mutagenic processes that are less frequently
experienced in dsDNA [4]; (2) geminivirus genomes, and
those of some other ssDNA viruses, are not sufficiently
methylated such that normal host mechanisms of mismatch repair may not function during their replication
[16,17]; and (3) when replicating, ssDNA virus genomes
are only transiently double stranded such that when errors
occur they are not efficiently repaired by host base-excision pathways [4].
Evidence is mounting that the rapid evolution of geminiviruses is, at least in part, driven by mutational processes
that act specifically on ssDNA. Controlled evolution
experiments involving Maize streak virus (MSV), a geminivirus in the Mastrevirus genus, have revealed a strand specific G  T mutation bias that is possibly attributable to
oxidative damage to guanines [9]. Similarly, analyses of
nucleotide substitution biases in natural tomato and cassava infecting geminivirus isolates (in the Begomovirus
genus) have, in addition to similar G  T mutation
biases, identified overrepresentations of C  T and G 
A transitions. These biases indicate that geminivirus DNA
may experience elevated rates of spontaneous damage
while in a single stranded state [4,5]. Although it remains
to be determined in a larger scale study whether an excess
of C  T and G  A transitions have occurred during mastrevirus evolution, all these studies are consistent with the
hypothesis that viral ssDNA is subjected to greater oxidative stresses (such as oxidative deamination of guanine
and cytosine or oxidation of guanine to 8-oxoguanine)
compared to host dsDNA.
High geminivirus basal mutation rates do not, however,
necessarily imply that these viruses are also evolving rapidly. Rather than simply being the rate at which mutations
occur, evolutionary rates are also influenced by (1) the
rate at which deleterious mutations are purged from a
population by negative, or purifying, selection, (2) the
efficiency with which advantageous adaptive mutations

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/104

are fixed in a population by positive, or diversifying, selection and (3) the rate at which neutral mutations (i.e. those
mutations with no effect on fitness) are fixed in or lost
from a population by random genetic drift. Adopting the
convention of Duffy et al. [15] we differentiate between
the biochemical or basal rate at which mutations arise
(mutation rate, measured in rounds of genomic replication or units of time), and the usually slower rate at which
mutations accumulate in wild populations evolving
under natural selection (substitution rate, usually measured in years).
Geminiviruses have either one (monopartite, species in
the Begomovirus, Mastrevirus, Topocuvirus and Curtovirus
genera) or two (bipartite, species in the Begomovirus
genus) ~2.7 Kb genome components. These compact
genomes are among the smallest of any known viruses
and encode only a small number of usually multifunctional and often overlapping genes [18]. Mastreviruses
such as MSV and Wheat dwarf virus (WDV), for example,
express only four distinct proteins: a movement protein
(MP), a coat protein (CP), a replication associated protein
(Rep) and a RepA protein, expressed from an alternative
spliceform of the rep gene transcript such that it shares
~70% of its amino acid sequence with Rep [18]. The compactness of mastrevirus genomes is further emphasised by
the fact that, with the exception of MP, these proteins have
multiple known functions [18]. Given that many, if not
most, mutations that occur in such compact genomes will
be at least slightly deleterious and therefore subject to negative selection, it is expected that mastrevirus nucleotide
substitution rates will be at least slightly lower than their
basal mutation rates.
It is currently a matter of dispute as to how much lower
geminivirus substitution rates are relative to their basal
mutation rates. Experimental analyses of highly adaptive
point mutations [19-21] and mutation frequencies in
genomes sampled after 30–60 days of replication within
infected plants [6,8,22] imply that the basal mutation
rates of geminiviruses are in excess of 10-3 mutations per
site per year (mut/site/year). Correspondence between the
phylogenies of certain mastrevirus species and those of
their grass hosts has, however, prompted speculation that
mastreviruses may have co-diverged with grasses and that
their substitution rates may therefore be as low as 10-8
substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year; [23]) – i.e.
ten thousand times lower than their basal mutation rates.
It is possible that very short-term evolution experiments
(<0.2 years) produce inflated estimates of long-term substitution rates, because they are measuring adaptation
(positive selection) to a novel host (e.g., [6,9]), or have
not allowed sufficient time for negative selection to have
effectively purged mildly deleterious mutations [24].
However, the co-divergence hypothesis demands a longterm substitution rate four orders of magnitude lower
Page 2 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

Virology Journal 2009, 6:104

than the approximately 2 × 10-4 to 7 × 10-4 subs/site/year
rates that have been estimated in short-term (<5 years)
evolution experiments [7,9] and longer term (over tens of
years) substitution rates estimated from temporally structured tomato and cassava infecting begomovirus datasets
sampled from nature [4,5].
The ten-thousand-fold discrepancy between directly-calculated geminivirus substitution rate estimates and those
implied by the co-divergence hypothesis is difficult to reconcile. It has been suggested that different evolutionary
forces are operating over short- (less than one year), long(tens of years) and very long-term (thousands of years)
evolutionary timescales: even though point mutations
rapidly accumulate in geminiviruses over observable
timescales, over the millennia mastreviruses experience an
almost complete absence of positive selection and neutral
genetic drift, coupled with almost unfalteringly efficient
negative selection [23]. This argument relies on the
strange circumstance of mastrevirus species having had
long co-evolutionary histories within their hosts, but
without their having engaged in arms races with those
hosts.
Here we describe a series of evolution experiments involving MSV and Sugarcane streak Réunion virus (SSRV – a
mastrevirus species closely related to MSV [25]) that lasted
between 6 and 32 years. Our results provide extensive
additional support for the hypothesis that, as with other
geminiviruses, MSV and SSRV basal mutation rates are
possibly elevated by unrepaired oxidative damage
inflicted on ssDNA. We additionally show that, contrary
to expectations under the co-divergence hypothesis, neutral genetic drift and not negative selection appears to be
a dominant process determining the fate of new mutations.

Results and discussion
Long term mastrevirus evolution experiments
In 1971, a sugarcane plant presenting with foliar streak
symptoms later attributed to SSRV [25] was collected in
Mauritius. In 1976, viruses were leafhopper transmitted
from this plant to both a plant of the sugarcane variety
H44-3098 and the wild grass species Coix lachryma-jobi.
Both sugarcane and Coix plants were maintained in an
insect free glasshouse over the next 32 years at the Mauritius Sugar Industry Research Institute. At some time
between 1977 and 1986 viruses were retransmitted by
leafhopper from the Coix to sugarcane, and in 1987 leaf
samples from this sugarcane plant were shipped to Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du CNRS in
France, where total DNA was extracted and stored until
2008. In 1984, two stalks cut from the H44-3098 plant
were sent to the John Innes Centre in the United Kingdom
where they were planted and maintained until 1997. Total

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/104

DNA was extracted from one of these plants in 1991, and
symptomatic leaves from the other were cut in 1997 and
stored at -80°C until DNA was extracted from them in
2007. In 1989, leaf samples from the H44-3098 plant
were also shipped to the University of Cape Town in
South Africa where total DNA was extracted and stored
until 2008. Finally, in 2008 we obtained total leaf DNA
samples from the originally infected Coix and H44-3098
plants in Mauritius.
In an unrelated experiment, two naturally-infected perennial Digitaria sp grasses with mild streak symptoms (later
attributed to the MSV-strains MSV-B and MSV-F in each
plant, respectively [26]) were maintained under insectfree conditions at the John Innes Centre in the United
Kingdom between 1984 and 1997 [27]. Total genomic
DNA was isolated and stored from each of these plants in
1991 and again in 1997.
To assess sequence divergence over time in these three serendipitous evolution experiments, we cloned and
sequenced between 8 and 20 complete viral genomes
from each of the six SSRV samples (a total of 81 clones),
the two MSV-B samples (a total of 18 clones) and the two
MSV-F samples (a total of 22 clones; see Table 1 for a
breakdown of samples from which clones were obtained).
We found that the viral diversity within the various experimental plants over the duration of the experiment was
surprisingly high when compared with that observed
within natural continent-wide MSV and WDV populations (Figure 1a). For example, the degree of virus diversification noted over the 32-year SSRV experiment is
approximately (1) half that found for the major southern
African MSV-A variant [26], MSV-A4, and (2) equivalent to
that found throughout China for the wheat-adapted WDV
strain [28].
The amount of genetic variability observed in the two sixyear-long experiments involving MSV-F and MSV-B in
Digitaria spanned that previously observed in a five- year
experiment involving MSV-B in sugarcane [9]. It was
immediately apparent, however, that the virus population
within the MSV-B infected plant was substantially less
diverse over the course of the experiment than that within
the MSV-F infected plant (Figure 1b).
It is important to point out that none of the three evolution experiments was initiated using cloned viruses and
that we have no samples that were taken within two years
of the start of the experiments. Therefore, the diverse virus
populations within the infected plants could have arisen
through rapid evolutionary rates, or as a result of the
plants having been co-infected with divergent virus lineages – a situation that may have resulted in lineage sorting
or founder effects.

a All p-values are > 0.1 (i.e. there is no significant deviation from neutrality) for all tests other than for Fu and Li's F* with the full SSRV dataset which
has a p-value between 0.05 and 0.1.

However, when we compared the phylogenetic relationships of virus genomes sampled at consecutive timepoints from individual plants (represented by blue and
orange coloured branches on the trees in Figure 1b), we
noted that samples from later time-points (orange
branches in Figure 1b) were generally situated further
from the presumed root-nodes than were those sampled
at earlier time-points (blue branches in Figure 1b). Such a
temporally-structured phylogenetic pattern indicated
that, despite our knowing neither the precise genotypes of
the viruses that initiated our experimental populations,
nor the exact time of infection, we should still be able to
accurately infer nucleotide substitution rates from our
data.
Geminiviruses have uniformly high nucleotide substitution
rates
The Bayesian coalescent based methods implemented in
the computer program BEAST[29] are ideally suited to
inferring nucleotide substitution rates from temporally
structured datasets such as ours. Applying these methods
we estimated mean substitution rates of approximately
3.5 × 10-4, 2.0 × 10-4 and 2.1 × 10-4 sub/site/year over the
duration of the SSRV, MSV-F and MSV-B experiments,
respectively (Figure 2). These estimates were reasonably
consistent irrespective of the molecular clock or demographic models used. All had overlapping 95% highest
probability density (HPD) intervals within the range of
7.22 × 10-5 (observed with the MSV-F dataset using a
relaxed clock + Bayesian skyline plot model) to 6.77 × 104 subs/site/year (observed with the SSRV dataset using a
relaxed clock + Bayesian skyline plot model; Figure 2).

These rates are slightly lower than those of ~7 × 10-4 subs/
site/year previously estimated for MSV-A, MSV-B and
MSV-C in one- to five-year long evolution experiments
involving cloned virus genomes [9]. They are, however,
approximately equivalent to those estimated within a natural temporally-structured tomato infecting begomovirus
dataset employing the same methodology used here (Figure 2; [4]). Our results in relation to these other studies are
entirely unsurprising: it is expected that substitution rate
estimates from shorter term evolution experiments will be
closer to the basal mutation rate than those estimated
either from longer term experiments, or from natural
sequences sampled over a number of decades [15].
Importantly, the structure of the SSRV experiment allowed
us to verify the accuracy of our SSRV nucleotide substitution rate estimate. Firstly, we knew that the date associated
with root node separating the 2008 Coix samples from the
1989, 1991, 1997 and 2008 sugarcane samples was 1976
– the year in which viruses were transmitted from sugarcane to Coix. Secondly, we knew that in 1984 two lineages
represented by the 1991 and 1997 sugarcane samples
were split from the lineage represented by the 1989 and
2008 samples (Figure 3).
Irrespective of the demographic and clock models used,
the mean estimated date of the 1984 sugarcane lineage
split was within 4 years of the actual date, and the estimated mean date of the sugarcane to Coix transmission
event was within 8 years of the actual date. In all cases the
95% HPD intervals included the actual dates (Figure 3).

The mean substitution rate estimates for MSV and SSRV are between 2.0 × 10-4 and 3.5 × 10-4 subs/site/year.
For the six-year MSV-B and MSV-F and the 32-year SSRV evolution experiments, substitution rate estimates made using a
range of demographic and molecular clock models are presented. Whereas black squares indicate the most probable substitution rates, vertical bars indicate the 95% highest probability density of the substitution rate estimates. Red squares indicate
rates estimated using the best fit demographic and clock models (determined using Bayes factor tests; Additional file 1). Stars
indicates the models that returned the highest likelihood. When more than one red square is shown for a particular dataset
this indicates that neither demographic model provided better support for the data. For purposes of comparison, previous
estimates of substitution rates are presented (in the grey area) for both MSV (full genome sequences sampled during shorter
term evolution experiments lasting between 2 months and 5 years; [9,22] from individual plants) and the begomoviruses,
TYLCV (full genome sequences sampled from nature over 19 years [4]), East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV, full
genome sequences sampled from nature over 8 years [5]), Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCV, partial genome
sequences sampled over 1 to 2 months from individual plants [6]) and TYLCV (full genome sequences sampled over 1 month
from individual plants[8]).
models provided a significantly better fit to the data than
the relaxed-clock models while the opposite pattern was
observed for the Bayesian skyline plot model (see additional file 1). The exponential growth and constant population size strict molecular clock models both fitted the
data equally well however, with the former recovering a
marginally higher likelihood than the latter model. These
models yielded more accurate estimates of the 1976 sugarcane to Coix transmission event and the 1984 sugarcane
lineage split (within five and one years of the actual dates,
respectively), as well as narrower 95% HPD intervals.
These fairly-precise recapitulations of a known bifurcation
and a known trifurcation in our experiment serve as independent confirmation that, at the very least, our substitution rate estimates for SSRV using the strict-clock model
(between 2.27 × 10-4 and 2.86 × 10-4 subs/site/year) were

reasonably accurate irrespective of the demographic models used.
The SSRV results are the first substitution rate estimates
from a plant virus maintained in laboratory/greenhouse
settings that allowed the same heterochronous sampling
over the tens of years that are used to estimate rates from
field-isolated viruses. The agreement between the laboratory substitution rate of a mastrevirus and the field substitution rate of begomoviruses (Figure 2) indicates that the
different, potentially relaxed, selection pressures viruses
face in greenhouse-maintained plants do not lead to different rates of evolution.
Specific nucleotide substitution biases are conserved

The maximum clade credibility phylogenetic tree recovered under one of the best-fit models (exponential

The best fit model indicates that: (1) the sugarcane-to-Coix SSRV transmission event that initiated the experiment, which actually occurred in 1976, was estimated to have
occurred in 1971 (95% highest clade credibility interval = 1962–1979, indicated by the red posterior probability distribution
beneath the tree) and (2) the date of the three-way 1984 sugarcane virus population split was estimated to have occurred in
1985 (95% highest probability density = 1980 – 1989 indicated by the blue posterior probability distribution for the tMRCA situated beneath the tree). Thus, applying the estimated SSRV substitution rate quite accurately recovers the dates of two important events in the 32-year long SSRV evolution experiment.

cated that higher than expected geminivirus mutation
rates are at least partially attributable to the susceptibility
of ssDNA to oxidative damage [4,5,9]. The signatures of
such damage are elevated rates of C  T, G  A and G 
T mutations. Whereas ssDNA is known to be more prone
than dsDNA to the oxidative deamination reactions that
cause C  T and G  A transitions [30-32], it is also more
prone to reactions that convert guanine to 8-oxoguanine
and cause G  T transversions [33-35].
In each of the three independent evolution experiments,
we estimated the relative non-reversible rates of substitution between nucleotides (e.g. the rate of A  C is not necessarily the same rate as C  A) using a maximum
likelihood approach implemented in the program
HYPHY[36]. In both the SSRV and MSV-F experiments, C 
T, G  A and G  T substitutions were inferred to have
higher relative rates than all nine other substitution types
(Figure 4). Although C  T and G  A transitions also
had the highest relative rates in the MSV-B experiment, in
this experiment G  T transversions had only the seventh
highest rate. It is important to point out, however, that
there were only 17 polymorphisms in the entire MSV-B

dataset. Since the SSRV and MSV-F datasets respectively
contained 157 and 64 polymorphisms, their relative substitution rates may be more meaningful.
To determine whether specific types of mutation occur
more or less frequently during MSV and SSRV evolution
than could be accounted for by chance, we collectively
considered all 238 mutations observed to have occurred
during our three evolution experiments using the chi
square test outlined by van der Walt et al. [9]. This analysis
revealed that whereas C  T, G  A and G  T mutations
were indeed significantly over-represented (chi square p =
4 × 10-4, 7 × 10-3, and < 1 × 10-5, respectively), C  A, T
 A and T  G transversions were significantly underrepresented (chi square p = 7 × 10-3, 2 × 10-2 and < 4 × 103 ; Figure 4).
All four possible transition mutations, including C  T
and G  A, are generally thought to occur at higher frequencies than the eight possible transversion mutations
[37]. Indeed, our results across all the evolution experiments indicate individual transition substitutions
occurred at approximately twice the frequency of individPage 7 of 14

ual transversion substitutions (Figure 4). Accordingly,
when we restricted our chi square test to include only
either transitions or transversions the frequency of G  A
mutations was no longer significantly higher than that of
the other transition mutations. Similarly, whereas the frequency of T  G mutations was not significantly lower
than those of other transversion mutations, the frequency
of A  G mutations was inferred to be significantly lower
than those of other transition mutations. However, the C
 T and G  T substitutions remained significantly
higher than expected and the frequencies of the C  A
and T  A substitutions still lower than expected.
Despite the relatively good agreement of overrepresented
substitutions between begomovirus studies [4,5] and our
evolution experiments, there isn't perfect concordance
among substitution biases in different geminiviruses. For
example, whereas both our study and a Tomato yellow
leaf curl virus (TYLCV) study indicate that T  G substitutions are significantly underrepresented during the evolution of some geminiviruses, this type of substitution has
been significantly over-represented during East African
cassava mosaic virus evolution [5].
Substitution biases are strand specific
As only the virion strands of geminivirus genomes spend
significant time in a single stranded state, an additional
signature that would indicate that ssDNA is more prone
than dsDNA to mutation should be the existence of strand
specific substitution biases. While the overrepresented C
 T and G  A transitions are likely occurring on the virion strand, these two transitions are complementary and
cannot be used to determine strand-specificity. However,
G  T substitutions occur at a higher frequency than C 
A substitutions (i.e. the complement of G  T) providing
clear evidence either that: (1) C  A mutations occur
much more frequently on the complementary strand than
they do on the virion strand; or (2) G  T mutations
occur much more frequently on the virion strand than
they do on the complementary strand. It is possible to
choose between these two alternatives if, as is the case
with geminiviruses, only one strand spends an appreciable amount of time in a single-stranded state.

We devised a likelihood ratio test to determine whether
there was significant evidence of a strand-specific substitution bias in our three evolution experiments. This simply
involved determining the relative likelihoods of observing
our data given either (1) a six rate substitution matrix in
which complementary mutations were constrained to
occur at the same rate (i.e. a situation with no strand specific substitution biases) or (2) a twelve rate substitution
matrix in which all substitution types were free to occur at
different rates.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/104

For both the SSRV and MSV-F experiments this test
inferred the existence of significant strand specific nucleotide substitution biases (chi square p = 8.5 × 10-3 and 5.7
× 10-4 respectively) strongly indicative of mutational processes operating specifically on ssDNA. Possibly because of
the low numbers of polymorphisms considered, the test
failed to reveal any such evidence for the MSV-B dataset.
Such strand specific substitution biases taken together
with increased rates of specific substitutions such as G 
T, C  T and G  A amongst both mastrevirus and begomovirus datasets indicate very strongly that (1) all geminiviruses probably experience roughly equivalent
mutagenic stresses and (2) high geminivirus substitution
rates are, in part, driven by shared mutagenic processes
independent of polymerase error, operating on ssDNA.
Negative and positive selection against a background of
neutral genetic drift
The co-divergence hypothesis of Wu et al. [23] demands
that, over thousands of years, at least 99.999% of all arising mutations and 99.99% of all substitutions that appear
dominant in populations over tens of years are ultimately
purged from mastrevirus populations by negative selection. Although it is impossible to directly test this hypothesis by running controlled evolution experiments over
such long time-periods, it is possible to directly test this
supposition by looking for the predicted signal of overwhelming negative selection in our evolution experiments.

In our SSRV evolution experiment we detected significant
evidence (p < 0.1) of negative selection operating on 12 of
the 22 cp and 10 of the 48 rep codons displaying some
degree of nucleotide variation (Table 2). This indicated
that there is not strong purifying selection purging
99.999% of nucleotide variation, and implies that at least
some mastrevirus nucleotide variation is selectively neutral. It is important to note that Wu et al. [23] themselves
did not find any evidence for stronger purifying selection,
as determined by the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, among their WDV isolates than have
virologists who argue for fast long-term evolution in geminiviruses [4,5]. Of course, these ratios only quantify negative selection acting on expressed amino acid sequences
– not negative selection acting directly on the underlying
nucleotide sequences. Even Wu et al. [23] are tacitly
accepting that large numbers of synonymous nucleotide
substitutions are probably selectively neutral, weakening
their argument that negative selection on all genetic
change is overwhelming and efficient. Importantly, we
also detected two codons in mp and one in rep that are
apparently evolving under positive selection (posterior
probability  0.99; Table 2). It is very difficult to reconcile
the extremely strong negative selection demanded by the

to compete effectively with wild-type viruses. Under such
conditions the overwhelming majority of detectable
mutations should be unique to the mutant genomes that
carry them. This pattern of genetic variation is generally
detected using population genetic neutrality tests such as
Tajima's D [38] or Fu and Li's F* statistics [39] that
describe the representation in datasets of mutations that
are found only in individual sequences relative to those
that are found in multiple sequences. If these statistics
have a significantly negative value for a group of
sequences randomly sampled from a population of constant size, it implies that the accumulation of mutations
within the sequences was more strongly influenced by
negative selection than it was by neutral genetic drift.

co-divergence hypothesis with this demonstration that
natural selection does not even uniformly disfavour nonsynonymous mutations.
In fact, the degree of negative selection implied by the codivergence hypothesis would be expected to produce a situation in which all mutants would only be detectable for
a short period of time after they arise – thereafter they
would be expected to become extinct due to their inability

We were unable to find any significant deviation from
zero for either Tajima's D or Fu and Li's F* statistics in any
of the virus populations we sampled during our evolution
experiments (Table 1). Although negative scores for both
these statistics for most of the populations imply that
sequences were subjected to some degree of negative
selection, it is apparent that random genetic drift is the
dominant process determining the relative frequencies of
particular mutations in these populations. For example,
although only one sequence differed from all the rest at 53
out of 128 variable nucleotide sites in the SSRV dataset,
the remainder were sites at which mutations were present
in multiple sequences and were therefore not significantly
deleterious.
From our evolution experiment data it is very simple to
directly infer the action of genetic drift and/or positive
selection acting on mutations by tracking changes in the
population-wide frequency of particular mutants over
time. For example, in the SSRV experiment, we observed 8
instances where mutations that were present in <25% of
sequences sampled in 1989, were present in 100% of
sequences sampled from the same plant in 2008 – these
mutations could only have reached fixation by 2008
through either genetic drift or positive selection. Taken
collectively, all our data clearly indicate the mutations
that arose during our controlled evolution experiments
were not uniformly subject to anywhere near the degree of
negative selection required by the co-divergence hypothesis.
Congruent phylogenies are necessary, but not sufficient, to
demonstrate virus-host coevolution
As has been pointed out by the originators of the mastrevirus-host co-divergence hypothesis, it very difficult to
prove virus-host co-speciation [23,40]. For example, it is
usually impossible to confirm that phylogenetic signals
superficially indicative of co-divergence are not instead
caused by other epidemiological and ecological factors
[see [40] for specific examples of how these can be con-

fused with co-divergence]. Mismatched substitution rates
between viruses and their hosts have provided evidence
against some long-assumed co-divergence pairs, including
hantaviruses and their rodent hosts [41] and JC virus,
whose phylogeny had been used as a proxy for early
human migration patterns [42]. For example, the close
relationships between Human immunodeficiency virus
and other closely related lentiviruses isolated from simians are also superficially indicative of co-divergence.
Despite this it is now clear that the apparent correspondence of such virus and host relationships is as a result of
viruses being more capable of adapting to new host species if the new host species are genetically similar to their
old host species [40]. The ability of geminiviruses to adapt
rapidly to novel hosts, and the polyphagy of their insect
vectors also argue both against the hypothesis of widespread co-speciation among these viruses and in favour of
the hypothesis that apparent co-speciation signals simply
reflect the fact that genetically more similar viruses just
happen to infect, and become specifically adapted to,
genetically more similar hosts. The balance of evidence
therefore still strongly favours geminiviruses having RNA-

virus-like substitution rates that exclude the possibility of
their having co-diverged with their hosts.

Conclusion
We have used long-term evolution experiments to investigate the credibility of recent suggestions that mastreviruses may have co-diverged with their host species over
millions of years. We have shown that both the mutational processes and the substitution rates they drive are
conserved across the geminivirus family, and are orders of
magnitude higher than the rates implied by the co-divergence hypothesis. Additionally, we have provided evidence against potent negative selection as a plausible
mechanism by which very-long-term mastrevirus substitution rates could be more than 10,000 fold lower than
both their basal mutation rates and directly measured
substitution rates. While some of the genetic variation in
our three evolution experiments is under statistically significant positive selection, much of it appears nearly neutral. In short, all available evidence suggests that
mastrevirus evolution is no more severely constrained by
negative selection than is that of other rapidly evolving
viruses [15].

Methods
Virus isolates
A sugarcane plant presenting with streak symptoms was
collected in 1971 from a multiplication plot at Médine,
Mauritius, and was used in 1976 as a source of inoculum
to infect both a sugarcane plant (variety H44-3098) and a
Coix lacryma-jobi plant. These were maintained in an insect
free glass house for the next 32 years at the Mauritius
Sugar Industry Research Institute. Virus was retransmitted
from the Coix plant to a second sugarcane plant at some
time between 1977 and 1986. Samples were taken from
the original H44-3098 plant in 1989 and 2008; from the
second sugarcane plant in 1987; and from the Coix plant
in 2008. In 1984 two separate cuttings from the H443098 plant were taken and maintained separately – samples were taken from one of these cuttings in 1991 and
from the other in 1997.

Two Digitaria plants with mild streak-like symptoms were
collected in Rwanda and Burundi by R.H. Markham (the
then plant pathologist at the CAB International Institute
of Biological Control, Kenya) in 1984. After transferring
them to the John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK, viruses
were leafhopper transmitted from these plants to Digitaria
sanguinalis. These two newly infected D. sanguinalis plants
were maintained under insect free conditions between
1984 and 1997 with samples being taken from each plant
in both 1991 and 1997.
Isolation, cloning and sequencing of viral DNA
Total DNA was isolated from preserved sugarcane or Digitaria samples by either a modified CTAB method [43,44]
or the Extract-N-Amp™ Plant (Sigma-Aldrich) method as
described by Shepherd et al. [45]. The virus was amplified
using phi29 DNA polymerase (TempliPhi™, GE Healthcare, USA; [46]), the amplified concatemers were digested
with SalI (sugarcane virus isolates) or BamHI (Digitaria
virus isolates) to yield ~2.7-kb linearised viral genomes
which were cloned into pGEM3Zf+ (Promega Biotech)
cloning vector. Both strands of cloned genomes were commercially sequenced (Macrogen Inc., Korea) by primer
walking. Sequences were assembled and edited using DNAMAN (version 5.2.9; Lynnon Biosoft) and MEGA (version 4
[47]).
Detection of recombination and phylogenetic tree
construction
Sequences from all three evolution experiments were
tested for evidence of recombination using LDHAT[48] and
various methods implemented in the program RDP3[49].
These analyses failed to detect any significant evidence of
recombination in our datasets. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed using PHYML[50] with best fit models automatically selected by RDP3[49].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/104

Estimation of nucleotide substitution rates
A co-estimate of the nucleotide substitution model
parameters, phylogeny and time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was obtained for the MSV-B, MSVF and SSRV datasets using the Bayesian Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in BEAST
v1.4.8 [29]. Six different coalescent demographic models
were employed including both parametric (constant population size, exponential population growth) and nonparametric (Bayesian skyline plot; BSP) models, with both
a strict and relaxed (uncorrelated LogNormal prior)
molecular clock.

For each evolutionary model, two independent runs of
length 5 × 107 steps in the Markov chain were performed
using BEAST and checked for convergence using TRACER
v1.4 [29]. The estimated sample sizes for each run were
almost always > 200 indicating sufficient mixing of the
Markov chain and parameter sampling. When similar
results were produced from independent runs of the
Markov chain, the log files were combined with the program LOGCOMBINER v1.4.7 available in the BEAST package
[29].
Demographic and clock model comparisons
Models were compared by calculating a measure known
as the Bayes factor, which is the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of the two models being compared [51,52]. Bayes
factors allow the comparison of non-nested models (such
as the non-parametric Bayesian skyline plot vs. the parametric constant or exponential growth demographic models) that cannot be validly compared using the mean log
posterior probabilities.
Analysis of nucleotide substitution biases
We evaluated nucleotide substitution biases using maximum likelihood phylogenetic models of evolution.
Briefly, such models make use of a continuous time
Markov process in which mutations are modelled along
branches of a phylogenetic tree, according to a rate matrix
with elements (qij) describing the instantaneous substitution rate from nucleotide i to nucleotide j. These elements
(qij) typically include (i) parameters describing equilibrium nucleotide frequencies, (ii) exchangeability parameters describing the nucleotide substitution process and
(iii) rate heterogeneity parameters accounting for spatial
heterogeneity of the substitution process [53]. The most
general form of the nucleotide substitution matrix, or general time reversible model (GTR; [54]), has elements

q ij =  ij j
where j is the equilibrium frequency of nucleotide j
assumed to be in equilibrium and constant across lineages; and ij the instantaneous rate of substitution of

Page 11 of 14

Virology Journal 2009, 6:104

nucleotide i with nucleotide j. These models typically
assume time-reversibility such that ij = ij. Here we use
standard model comparison techniques to compare
reversible with non-reversible models of evolution as
applied to mastreviruses. We implemented a standard
GTR model (where forward and reverse substitutions are
constrained to have the same rate, for example, C  T
substitution rates must be the same as T  C substitution
rates) and a different non-reversible model of evolution
with six rates, in which rates are shared by complementary
substitutions (e.g. C  T rates are constrained to be the
same as G  A rates). Both six rate models are nested
within the non-reversible twelve-rate model (where all 12
substitutions are free to occur at different rates), and thus
a likelihood ratio test with degrees of freedom equal to the
difference in the number of parameters is appropriate for
model comparisons between each of the six rate models
and the 12 rate model. Phylogenetic models and statistical
tests were implemented in the HYPHY batch language [36]
and are available from the authors on request.
We reconstructed ancestors at internal nodes using maximum likelihood and a non-reversible substitution model,
and counted substitutions along branches of the phylogeny using HYPHY[36]. The relative counts of each mutation
type over the 32 years of the SSRV experiment and the 6
years of the MSV-B and MSV-F experiments were compared using the 2 × 2 chi square test described by van der
Walt et al. [9]. This takes into account nucleotide composition biases but not inherent differences in rates of transition vs. transversion mutations. We therefore also used
a modified version of this test where transitions and transversions were treated separately such that, for example,
the number of times that a particular transversion mutation was estimated to have occurred was only compared to
the collective number of times that the seven other transversion mutation types were estimated to have occurred.
Site by site analysis of natural selection
We used three methods implemented on the DATAMONKEY
webserver [55] that examine ratios of non-synonymous
(dN) and synonymous mutations (dS) to identify signals
of positive (dN > dS) and negative selection (dN <dS)
operating on individual codons within genes. Single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) infers selection by comparing observed rates of non-synonymous and
synonymous mutation at each codon to that expected
under a binomial distribution (SLAC). Fixed effects likelihood (FEL) compares model fit in which non-synonymous and synonymous mutations are constrained to be
equal, to an unconstrained model (FEL). Random Effects
Likelihood (REL) methods approximate the distribution
of non-synonymous to synonymous rates across all sites
into classes, and calculate the posterior probability that
each site belongs to each of the rate classes. Since these

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/104

methods perform better on larger data sets [56] we only
conducted these analyses on sequences obtained during
the SSRV experiment. We tested alignments of genes for
the movement protein (mp, 79 sequences, 327 nucleotides long), coat protein (cp, 78 sequences, 741 nucleotides long) and the replication-associated protein (rep,
80 sequences, 888 nucleotides long, excluding the alternate reading frame overlap between rep and repA codons
217–282). The number of sequences varied between
alignments because we excluded sequences with apparent
indels or premature stop codons.
Neutrality tests
Tajima's D and Fu and Li's F* statistics [38,39] were calculated and tested for significance using the program DNASP
version 4.0 [57]. Between 8 and 20 full length genomes
randomly cloned from each of the six SSRV samples and
the 2 MSV-B and MSV-F samples were tested. All the samples from each of the SSRV, MSV-B and MSV-F experiments were also analysed together. Both D and F*
statistics identify the contribution of rare variants to total
genetic diversity. Significantly negative statistics are indicative of an excess of rare variants and are a signature of
very strong negative selection against the survival of
mutant genomes [38,39].
