Abstract
Background: Rodentia is the most diverse order of placental mammals, with extant rodent
species representing about half of all placental diversity. In spite of many morphological and
molecular studies, the family-level relationships among rodents and the location of the rodent root
are still debated. Although various datasets have already been analyzed to solve rodent phylogeny
at the family level, these are difficult to combine because they involve different taxa and genes.
Results: We present here the largest protein-coding dataset used to study rodent relationships.
It comprises six nuclear genes, 41 rodent species, and eight outgroups. Our phylogenetic
reconstructions strongly support the division of Rodentia into three clades: (1) a "squirrel-related
clade", (2) a "mouse-related clade", and (3) Ctenohystrica. Almost all evolutionary relationships
within these clades are also highly supported. The primary remaining uncertainty is the position of
the root. The application of various models and techniques aimed to remove non-phylogenetic
signal was unable to solve the basal rodent trifurcation.
Conclusion: Sequencing and analyzing a large sequence dataset enabled us to resolve most of the
evolutionary relationships among Rodentia. Our findings suggest that the uncertainty regarding the
position of the rodent root reflects the rapid rodent radiation that occurred in the Paleocene
rather than the presence of conflicting phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic signals in the dataset.

Background
The order Rodentia is the most diverse among placental
mammals: extant rodent species represent half of the placental diversity (2,277 species divided into 33 families)
[1]. Morphological phylogenetic approaches have identified characters supporting a common origin (monophyly)
of rodents, and clustered rodents and lagomorphs (rab-

bits, pikas) in a clade called Glires [2]. Morphological
studies also generally agree on the number and content of
rodent families [1,3,4]. However, the description of the
relationships among rodent families has been confounded by rampant convergent evolution of morphological characters [5]. Based on morphological characters,
rodents have been divided into either two or three suborPage 1 of 12

ders. The first system, suggested by Brandt, divides rodents
into three suborders, Myomorpha, Sciuromorpha, and
Hystricomorpha, based on the position of masticatory
muscles (the masseters) [6]. However, it has since been
proven that this character is homoplasic and that this classification does not reflect evolutionary relationships [7,8].
The second system, proposed by Tullberg, divides rodents
into two suborders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi,
based on the position of the incisors and the angle of the
jaw [9]. The monophyly of Hystricognathi has been
accepted, based on the identification of additional morphological synapomorphies, but the Sciurognathi are usually considered to be paraphyletic [10]. Debates on the
relationships within Sciurognathi and their relationships
with Hystricognathi are the subject of numerous morphological papers [reviewed in [11]]. Molecular studies were
expected to clarify the relationships among rodents. However, early studies based on molecular data complicated
the understanding of rodent evolution by suggesting that
rodents are paraphyletic [12-14]. These results initiated
lively debates concerning evolutionary relationships
among rodents and their place among placental mammals [15-17]. Phylogenetic conclusions supporting
rodent paraphyly have been criticized, because they were
based on a very limited taxonomic sampling. It has been
suggested that increasing the sampling of rodent diversity
[2] and/or mammalian diversity [18] would have supported rodent monophyly. Additionally, over-simplified
models have been shown to erroneously support rodent
paraphyly [19]. Recent analyses based on a representative
sampling of rodent taxonomic diversity and using modelbased methods of sequence analysis have strongly supported the monophyly of rodents [20-24].
Within Rodentia, molecular analyses suggest that rodents
are divided into seven well-supported clades: 1-Anomaluromorpha (scaly-tailed flying squirrels, springhares), 2Castoridae (beavers), 3-Ctenohystrica (gundi, porcupines, guinea-pigs), 4-Geomyoidea (pocket gophers,
pocket mice), 5-Gliridae (dormice), 6-Myodonta (rats,
mice, jerboas), and 7-Sciuroidea (mountain beavers,
squirrels, woodchucks) [25-28]. However, several evolutionary relationships within Rodentia are still debated.
Recent studies have suggested that these seven clades are
clustered into three main lineages: 1 – Anomaluromorpha, Castoridae, Geomyoidea, and Myodonta together
form the "mouse-related clade"; 2 – Sciuriodea and Gliridae form the "squirrel-related clade"; and 3 – Ctenohystrica forms the third lineage [29-32]. However, most
studies have not been able to solve the relationships
among these three clades. Recently, Montgelard et al. [32]
analyzed mitochondrial genes as well as nuclear exonic
and intronic sequences, and found significant support in
favor of a basal position of the "mouse-related clade".
This result was dependent on the removal of the fastest
evolving characters from the dataset, suggesting that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/71

mutational saturation might explain the inconclusive
placement of the rodent root.
More generally, Rodriguez-Ezpeleta et al. [33] have shown
that weakly supported nodes can sometimes be explained
by the presence of conflicting phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic signal in a dataset. Three methods to reduce the
non-phylogenetic information have been suggested: identification and removal of fast-evolving positions, character-recoding (e.g., RY coding), and the use of a siteheterogenous mixture model (e.g., CAT) [34].
Here, we aimed to resolve rodent relationships at the family level and above. We established a comprehensive dataset including six nuclear gene fragments from 41 rodent
species together with eight outgroup species. We were able
to solve most evolutionary relationships among rodent
families. In order to minimize conflicting signals and thus
solve the debated basal rodent relationships, we applied
the three methods suggested by Rodriguez-Ezpeleta et al.
[33]. We show that none of these methods, nor the use of
more complex evolutionary models, can significantly
solve basal rodent relationships. Additionally, some of
our analyses, surprisingly, suggest a basal position of the
squirrel-related clade and significantly reject the basal
position of the "mouse-related clade" supported by Montgelard et al. [32]. We thus propose that the lack of resolution at the base of the rodent tree may reflect rapid rodent
radiation, rather than conflicting phylogenetic signals.

Results and discussion
The rodent phylogeny
Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian phylogenetic
analyses, based on the combined nucleotide datasets,
result in a well-resolved phylogeny (Figure 1), in agreement with the division of rodents into three major clades:
the mouse-related clade (Bootstrap Percentage (BP) = 96,
Posterior Probability (PP) = 1.0), the squirrel-related
clade (BP = 86, PP = 1.0) and the Ctenohystrica (BP = 100,
PP = 1.0).
The mouse-related clade
The mouse-related clade comprises three main lineages:
Myodonta, Anomaluromorpha (Anomaluridae and
Pedetidae), and Castorimorpha (Geomyoidea and Castoridae). The monophyly of this clade was first found in
molecular studies [25,30-32] and later corroborated by a
morphological analysis of extant and fossil taxa [8]. However, two recent molecular analyses cast doubt on the
validity of the mouse-related clade. First, analysis of complete mitochondrial protein-coding genomes placed
Anomalurus as a sister taxon of the Hystricognathi [24].
Second, structural analysis of B1 retroposon elements suggested that Castoridae could be an early diverging family
within rodents [35]. Our analysis strongly rejects both of
these possibilities. The best alternative to monophyly of

the mouse-related clade is significantly less likely than the
ML tree, based on the approximately unbiased (AU) test
(Table 1, p-value = 0.02). Analyses using RY coding or
removal of third-codon positions, as well as partitioned
analyses strongly support the monophyly of the mouserelated clade (Table 2, BP = 94–100). When protein
sequences are analyzed, the monophyly of the mouserelated clade is still supported, albeit with lower bootstrap
support (BP = 77). It is likely that the disagreement
between our analysis and that of Horner et al. [24] stems
from the fact that the latter was based on only six nonmuroid species. With regard to the B1 retroposon study,
the position of Castoridae presented by Veniaminova et
al. [35] may be an artifact, because analysis of SINE insertion loci in rodents supports the monophyly of the
mouse-related clade [36].
Previous phylogenetic reconstructions were unable to
solve the relationships among the three main lineages of
the mouse-related clade (Myodonta, Anomaluromorpha,
and Castorimorpha), and all three possible evolutionary
relationships
have
been
suggested
[22,25,26,28,31,32,36]. Our phylogenetic inference
based on the full nucleotide dataset suggests the grouping
of Anomaluromorpha with Myodonda (Figure 1). However, bootstrap and Bayesian support is at best moderate
across the analyses considered (Table 2, BP = 37–72, PP =
0.58). In agreement with the bootstrap analysis, an AU
test does not reject either alternative hypotheses (Table 1,
p-value = 0.159–0.604). Additional data are thus needed
to resolve the relationships at the base of the mouserelated clade. All other nodes within the mouse-related
clade are well supported and alternatives are rejected
based on an AU test (data not shown).
The squirrel-related clade
The grouping of Gliridae and Sciuridae has been recognized in morphological studies based on middle ear fea-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/71

tures [37], arterial pattern [38], and by most molecular
analyses. Nevertheless, high support values have seldom
been obtained to support this relationship [22,2527,29,31,32]. This node is well supported in our study
(BP = 86, PP = 1.0). It is also supported in our analyses
using different coding and partitions approaches (Table 2,
BP = 86–98). However, alternatives to the monophyly of
this clade are not rejected according to the AU test (Table
1, p-value = 0.123).
The Ctenohystrica
The clustering of Ctenodactylidae and Hystricognathi is
highly supported (BP = 100, PP = 1.0). Previous knowledge of relationships within hystricognaths has been
based either on a single gene (vWF or 12sRNA) for many
hystricognath species (22–23 species) [39,40] or on multiple genes (3–6 genes) for fewer species (8–13 species)
[22,29,32,41]. The present dataset expands that of
Huchon et al. [29] by the addition of two nuclear gene
fragments and four hystricognath taxa (in particular, a second representative of the Hystricidae). This expanded
dataset allows us to solve the debated relationships within
Hystricognathi. We find strong support for a basal position of Hystricidae within Hystricognathi (Figure 1, Table
2, BP = 89–95, PP = 1.0), while this position was previously only weakly supported [25,26,29,40]. However, AU
tests do not reject alternative positions of Hystricidae
(Table 1, p-value = 0.128).

Phylogenetic relationships among South-American hystricognaths (i.e., Caviomorpha) have long been debated.
Caviomorphs have been found to comprise four distinct
lineages (Cavioidae, Chinchilloidea, Erethizontoidea,
and Octodontoidea) [40]. Our results confirm that chinchilla rats (Abrocoma) are not related to Chinchilla but
rather belong to the Octodontoidea (BP = 100, PP = 1.0)
[40,42,43]. Previous molecular trees did not resolve the
relationships among the four caviomorph lineages with

high bootstrap support, and various alternative topologies have been suggested [22,25,26,29,40]. Our data support a sister clade relationship between Cavioidea and
Erethizontoidea (BP = 95, PP = 0.98), and a sister clade
relationship between Chinchilloidea and Octodontoidea
(Figure 1, BP = 88, PP = 0.92). In spite of these high support values, AU tests indicate that the best alternatives to
these arrangements within Caviomorpha cannot be
rejected (Table 1, p-value = 0.148–0.206). Similarly, analyses using RY coding or removal of third codon positions,
as well as protein sequence analysis, support other relationships within Caviomorpha (data not shown). This
suggests that additional species sampling is needed in
order to robustly solve caviomorph relationships at the
superfamily level.
Solving the base of the rodent tree
The most important unresolved relationship in rodent
systematics is the one at the base of the rodent tree. To
date, no phylogenetic analysis has been able to resolve
this question with strong support, whether based on
nucleotide sequence data [24,25,29,31], SINE data
[36,44], or morphological data [8,10]. The only exception
is the analysis of Montgelard et al. [32], which supports a
basal position of the mouse-related clade after removal of
fast-evolving nucleotide positions. Our nucleotide-based
ML and Bayesian analyses (all three codon positions; Figure 1) place the squirrel-related clade at the base of the
rodent tree. Our Bayesian analysis with the data partitioned by gene and partially partitioned by codon position (1st- and 2nd-position sites combined within genes,
3rd-position sites for each gene separate) appears to provide strong support for this relationship (PP > 0.90), but

the partitioned ML bootstrap support values are much
lower (Table 2, BP = 51). It is possible for Bayesian PP values to be artificially inflated under circumstances of a
near-trichotomy [45]. With this single Bayesian analysis
being the only suggestion of strong support, and with the
corresponding ML bootstrap support being so low, we
hesitate to give much weight to the partitioned Bayesian
result at the present time.
Recently, Rodriguez-Ezpeleta et al. [33] have shown that
the presence of conflicting phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic signal in a dataset may result in weakly supported
nodes. They suggested various approaches to remove the
non-phylogenetic signal and thus increase the ability to
resolve difficult phylogenetic relationships. To evaluate
whether the resolution of the basal relationships among
rodents could be improved by reducing non-phylogenetic
signal in our dataset, we tested all the approaches suggested by Rodriguez-Ezpeleta et al. [33].
Character recoding
Third codon-position sites evolve the fastest, and are thus
the most likely source of non-phylogenetic signal. In an
attempt to reduce the non-phylogenetic signal, we performed analyses using RY coding for these positions. We
also explored the extreme solution of removing all third
codon-position sites. However, none of the three possible
basal branching topologies was highly supported under
these alternatives (Table 2). The only signal that can be
seen is that a basal position of the mouse-related clade is
not supported by the analysis of either the nucleotide
dataset with only the first two codon positions, or the protein sequence dataset (Table 2, BP < 1).

Removal of fast-evolving positions
Nine datasets were delimited by retaining sites based on
their inferred site-specific rates: (1) all sites (6,255 base
pairs (bps); rates range from -0.698 to 3.989); (2) sites
with rate ≤ 3.5 (6,114 bps); (3) sites with rate ≤ 3.0 (6,058
bps); (4) sites with rate ≤ 2.5 (5,997 bps); (5) sites with
rate ≤ 2.0 (5,896 bps); (6) sites with rate ≤ 1.5 (5,759 bps);
(7) sites with rate ≤ 1 (5,444 bps); (8) sites with rate ≤ 0.5
(4,997 bps); and (9) sites with rate ≤ 0.0 (4,179 bps). The
bootstrap support as a function of the maximal evolutionary rate of site retained is presented in Figure 2. Removal
of the fastest evolving sites (rate removed ≥ 2.5) improves
the support in favor of a basal position of the squirrelrelated from 30% to 59% while support for alternative
topology remains below 25%. However, no clear trend
can be found as bootstrap support remains below 60% in
all analyses. It is worth noting that the topology supporting a basal position of the mouse-related clade is again the
least supported, except for the dataset with maximum rate
≤ 0.5. We do not believe that this result effectively supports an early divergence of the mouse-related clade,
because slight modification of the rate cutoff substantially
changes the topology. For example, while the dataset with
maximum rate ≤ 0.5 supports a basal position of the
mouse-related clade, the dataset with maximum rate ≤ 0.6
supports a basal position of the Ctenohystrica. Note that

Nine datasets were considered: (1) all sites (6,255 base pairs

3.5 (6,114 bps); (3) sites with rate ≤ 3.0 (6,058 bps); (4) sites

sites with rate ≤ 0.0 (4,179 bps).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/71

Montgelard et al. did not study the effect of varying their
cut-off value. Finally, the support for all three topologies
drops when sites with rate higher than zero are removed,
possibly reflecting the fact that only 801 out of 2,858
informative characters remained in this dataset.
Similarly, seven datasets were considered by retaining
sites based on their consistency index (CI): (1) all sites
(6,255 bps; CI range 0.0625–1); (2) sites with CI > 0.1
(6,210 bps); (3) sites with CI > 0.2 (5,864 bps); (4) sites
with CI > 0.3 (5,432 bps); (5) sites with CI > 0.4 (4,833
bps); (6) sites with CI > 0.5 (4,119 bps); and (7) sites with
CI > 0.6 (4,023 bps). When retaining sites according to
their maximal CI value (Figure 3), we observe an increase
in the bootstrap support in favor of a basal position of the
squirrel-related clade from 30.6% to 68.2%, which might
suggest that this represents the phylogenetic signal. This
support drops when sites with CI ≤ 0.6 are removed,
which might come from the fact that only 626 informative
characters remain in this dataset.
Use of site-heterogenous mixture model
The phylogenetic trees obtained under the CAT model did
not help resolving the basal rodent relationships. The CAT
analysis suggests that the squirrel-related clade is the first
rodent lineage to diverge. However, no strong support in
favor of this relationship is found, whether reconstruc-

since different datasets can lead to significantly different
results when using this approach.

Use of complex evolutionary models for protein sequences
The use of more complex evolutionary models did not
completely solve basal rodent relationships. Again, a basal
position of the mouse-related clade is generally the least
likely, and this hypothesis is even rejected using AU tests
under either the JTT+Γ model or the rate-shift model
(Table 3). However, a basal position of the Ctenohystrica
cannot be excluded. This finding is in agreement with
both the nucleotide analysis based on the first two codon
positions and the nucleotide analysis with fast-evolving
sites removed.

More generally, our results suggest that the low support at
the base of the rodent tree cannot be attributed only to the
presence of conflicting non-phylogenetic signal, since
removing such non-phylogenetic signal failed to significantly increase the tree resolution. We thus hypothesize
that this lack of resolution reflects rapid radiation at the
base of the rodent tree and possibly incomplete lineage
sorting. Indeed, rodents were already highly diversified in
the Paleocene and Early Eocene. Many extinct families are
identified in these geological periods (i.e., Decipomyidae,
Alagomyidae, Ivanantoniidae, Sciuravidae, Ischyromyidae,
Theridomorpha, and Yuomyidae). According to recent
phylogenetic work based on fossils and extant taxa [8],
some of these ancient families are sister clades of extant
clades. In particular, Theridomorpha might be related to
Sciuroidea, Sciuravidae to the mouse-related clade, and
Yuomyidae to the Ctenohystrica [8]. This supports the idea
that the divergences among Ctenohystrica, the mouserelated clade, and the squirrel-related clade occurred during
the explosive radiation of rodents in the Paleocene.

The nucleotide sequences were also analyzed using codon
models. No support for positive selection was found, and
hence, we only report the results obtained using the M8a
model, which does not allow sites to evolve under positive selection. Under this model, a basal position of the
Ctenohystrica is the most likely. However, the fit of the
data to this topology is not significantly better than alternative topologies (0.9 and 4.0 log-likelihood point differences, for the topology with a basal position of the
squirrel-related clade and the topology with a basal position of the mouse-related clade, respectively). The three
possible rootings of the rodent tree are thus not statistically different based on AU tests (Table 3).

Conclusion
Our phylogenetic reconstructions provide a well-resolved
rodent tree, except for a few nodes and the basal relationships among the main rodent clades. Unlike Montgelard
et al. [32], removing fast evolving characters did not
improve the resolution at the base of the rodent tree. This
lack of resolution remained when all the other methods
suggested by Rodriguez-Ezpeleta et al. [33] to increase tree
resolution were applied. Surprisingly, using the JTT and
the rate-shift models, we were able to reject a basal position of the mouse-related clade supported by Montgelard
et al. [32] and support instead a basal position of the
squirrel-related clade (a topology rejected by Montgelard
et al. [32]). This suggests that removing fast evolving positions is not a panacea to solve phylogenetic conflicts,

Our results further suggest that a basal position of the
mouse-related clade is the least likely, while a basal position of the squirrel-related clade may be the most likely.
Interestingly, structural analysis of B1 retroposon elements also provides additional support in favor of an
early divergence of the squirrel-related clade [35,44]. The
basal position of the squirrel-related clade may further be
supported by the fact that the earliest fossils representative
of the Gliridae, Aplodontidae, and Sciuridae families are
protrogomorphous, while most early Ctenohystrica and
most early representatives of the mouse-related clade are
hystricomorphous [see review of character states in [8]].
Consequently, an early divergence of the squirrel-related
clade appears to be the most parsimonious evolutionary
scenario, given our current knowledge.

All suborders and super families of the order Rodentia
listed by Carleton and Musser [46] are included in the

analysis (Additional file 1). The tree was rooted with the
closest rodent outgroups: representative lagomorphs, representative primates, Cynocephalus (the flying lemur,
order Dermoptera), and Tupaia (tree shrew, order Scandentia). Rodents together with lagomorphs, primates, flying lemurs, and tree shrews form a clade called
Euarchontoglires or Supraprimates [21,47-49].
DNA amplification and sequencing
Ethanol-preserved samples, frozen tissue samples, or previously purified genomic DNAs were obtained from the
donor institutions listed in Additional file 2. Total DNA
was extracted according to Sambrook, Fritsch, and Maniatis [50] with slight modifications. Fragments from the following six nuclear genes were sequenced: the alpha 2B
adrenergic receptor (ADRA2B); the cannabinoid receptor
1 (CB1); the growth hormone receptor (GHR); the interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP); the
recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2); and the von
Willebrand factor (vWF). These nuclear genes were chosen
for the following reasons: (i) a large number of sequences
are already available for those genes, especially within
rodents; (ii) these genes have been shown to contain phylogenetic information within rodents and between mammalian orders [21,26,30]; (iii) these genes are not
genetically linked to one another (their location is variable, on chromosomes 2, 4, 15, 14, 2, and 6 in Mus, chromosomes 3, 5, 2, 16, 3, and 4 in Rattus, and chromosomes
2, 6, 5, 10, 11, and 12 in Homo); and (iv) no interactions
among these proteins were previously reported.

Amplification of ADRA2B, IRBP, and vWF was performed
as described in Huchon et al [29]. Amplification of CB1
was performed in two steps. A first amplification was performed with primers CB1-D1: 5'-GGCTCAAATGACATTCAGTACGAA-3'
and
CB1-R1:
5'GAGTCCCCCATGCTGTTATCTAGAGGCTG-3', followed
by a re-amplification of the initial PCR product using
primers CB1-D2: 5'-CAGTACGAAGATATCAAAGGAGA-

CATGGC-3' and CB1-R2: 5'-GAGTCCCCCATGCTGTTATCTAGAGGCTG-3'. Amplification of RAG2 and GHR
was performed similarly. For RAG2, the first amplification
was performed with primers RAG2-D1 5'-CGCTGCACAGAGAAAGACTT-3' and RAG2-R1: 5'-AAGGATTTCTTGGCAGGAGT-3', followed by a re-amplification of the
initial PCR product using primers RAG2-D2: 5'-TAYAGYCGAGGGAAAAGYATGGG-3'
and
RAG2-R2:
5'GACAAGTGGATGAGTGTGCGTTC-3'. For GHR the first
amplification was performed with primers GHR-D1 5'TAGGAAGGAAAATTRGARGARGTNAA-3'and GHR-R1:
5'-AAGGCTANGGCATGATRTTRTT-3', followed by a reamplification of the initial PCR product using primers
GHR-D2: 5'-GGAAAATTRGAGGAGGTGAAYACNATHTT3' and GHR-R2: 5'-GATTTTGTTCAGTTGGTCRGTRCTNAC-3' or GHR-R1. Purification of the PCR products and
sequencing were performed according to Huchon et al.
[29]. Sequence accession numbers are available in Additional file 1.
Sequence alignment
DNA sequences were translated and the corresponding
protein sequences were aligned using both PROBCONS
[51] and MAFFT [52]. PROBCONS alignments were conducted with three consistency steps and 500 iterative
refinement repetitions. MAFFT alignments were conducted with the L-INS-i option. The positions that differed
between both alignments were removed using SOAP [53].
The DNA alignments were then computed based on the
protein alignments using the program PAL2NAL [54]. The
number of DNA positions included in each gene partition
after using SOAP is indicated in Table 4. The DNA and
protein sequence alignments are provided in Additional
file 3 and Additional file 4, respectively.
ML analyses of the concatenated dataset
Phylogenetic tree reconstructions were performed on the
concatenated nucleotide dataset using the ML criterion.
The program MODELTEST 3.07 [55] was used to deter-

mine the best probabilistic model of DNA sequence evolution using the Akaike Information Criterion. The best
model was found to be GTR+Γ+I. ML searches for the best
trees were performed using the program PAUP* [56]. The
parameters of the model and the ML tree were then determined by successive approximation [57]. The initial
parameter values were those estimated by MODELTEST
3.07, and those values were used for a first round of heuristic search starting with a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree and
using TBR branch-swapping. Parameters were then estimated on the resulting tree and used for another round of
heuristic search. The process was repeated until all parameter values were stable. Bootstrap percentages were estimated from 100 pseudo-replicates using the best
estimated parameters, a NJ starting tree, and TBR branchswapping.
Phylogenetic trees were also reconstructed based on protein sequences. The protein sequence alignment is provided in Additional file 4. The program PROTTEST 1.3
[58] was used to estimate the best model of protein
sequence evolution. The best model was found to be
JTT+Γ+I. Phylogenetic trees were then reconstructed with
the program PHYML [59] using the ML model identified
by PROTTEST.
ML analyses of the partitioned dataset
Three different partitioned ML-analyses were conducted
on the nucleotide dataset with RAxML [60]. The first analysis considered each gene as an independent partition (six
partitions). The second analysis considered each codon
position as an independent partition (three partitions).
The third analysis considered each codon position of each
gene as an independent partition (18 partitions). The
GTR+Γ+I model was applied to all partitions, individual
α-shape parameters, substitution rates, and base frequencies were estimated and optimized separately for each partition. Bootstrap support was estimated using 100
pseudo-replicates.
Bayesian analyses
Bayesian analyses were performed on the nucleotide dataset using the program MrBayes v3.1.2 [61]. Prior distributions for parameters in the Bayesian analyses were:
topology, uniform; branch lengths, exponential (λ = 10);
alpha parameter of the Γ distribution, uniform
(0.05,50.0); pinv, uniform (0,1); κ, beta (1.0,1.0); Rmatrix, Dirichlet (1,1,1,1,1,1); base frequencies, Dirichlet
(1,1,1,1). Each run included two independently started
chains, each beginning with a different, randomly chosen
tree. From each starting tree, four related MCMC chains
(one cold and three incrementally heated) were run. The
temperature parameter λ was set to produce chain-swap
frequencies in the range of 10–30%. Posterior distribution estimates were based on sampling the cold chain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/71

every 250 generations. Initial runs were allowed to stop at
107 cycles if the percent standard deviation among bifurcation split probabilities for the two separate chains was
less than 0.01. In those cases, the first 5 × 106 cycles were
discarded as burn-in. Additional longer runs were performed if needed, with the first 50% of samples discarded
as burn-in. The dataset was divided into 12 partitions, two
for each gene. For each gene, the first- and second-position sites were combined into a single partition, and the
third-position sites in a separate partition. Analyses were
conducted with each partition assigned either the
HKY85+Γ or the GTR+Γ model, with the exception of the
1st- plus 2nd-position site partition for CB1, which used
either HKY85+I or GTR+I, because of the extremely low
number of variable sites in that partition. The GTR models
were preferred by Bayes' Factors, while the HKY85 models
were favored by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
However, both models gave very similar results, as did a
separate set of analyses with the CB1 1st- plus 2nd-position
sites excluded.
Bayesian analyses under the CAT +Γ4 model were performed using the program Phylobayes 2.1c [34,62]. Both
for the DNA and protein datasets, two chains were run for
100,000 cycles and trees were sampled every 100 cycles
after the first 25,000 cycles. As recommended in Phylobayes, the maximum difference in bipartition frequencies between the two chains was below 0.1, indicating a
"good run" (for DNA, maxdiff = 0.051; for protein,
maxdiff = 0.044). The phylogenetic trees obtained under
the CAT +Γ4 model are available in Additional file 5.
Testing alternative hypotheses
The ML tree was compared to several constrained topologies using various likelihood-based tests as implemented
in the program CONSEL v0.1i [63]. Eleven alternative
topologies were considered. 1 – The best tree placing the
Ctenohystrica at the base of Rodentia. 2 – The best tree
placing the mouse-related clade at the base of Rodentia. 3
– The best tree placing Myodonta at the base of the
mouse-related clade. 4 – The best tree placing Anomaluromorpha at the base of the mouse-related clade. 5 – The
best alternative that does not support monophyly of
Chinchilloidea+Octodontoidea. 6 – The best alternative
that does not support monophyly of Cavioioidea+Erethizontoidea. 7 – The best tree placing Phiomorpha at the
base of the Hystricognathi. 8 – The best tree placing Caviomorpha at the base of the Hystricognathi. 9 – The best
alternative that does not support monophyly of the
mouse-related clade. 10 – The best alternative that does
not support monophyly of the squirrel-related clade. 11 –
The best alternative that does not support monophyly of
the Ctenohystrica. The best alternatives were built using
constrained ML heuristic searches. Each search was conducted starting with an NJ tree, using the TBR branch-

swapping option, and the parameters of the unconstrained ML tree. Site-wise log-likelihoods were computed
with PAUP* using the parameters of the best ML tree.

position. The program MODELTEST 3.07 was used to
infer the model of sequence evolution and phylogenetic
trees were reconstructed using PAUP* as described above.

Removal of fast-evolving positions
Following the approach of Rodriguez-Ezpeleta et al. [33],
fast evolving sites were determined according to their sitewise rates calculated with the program Rate4Site [64]
using the Tamura-Nei substitution model [65] with 16
discrete rate categories used to approximate the Gamma
distribution. Rates were computed for three topologies:
the ML tree topology obtained as describe above (i.e., the
topology with the squirrel-related clade at the base), and
the two alternative topologies (the mouse-related clade at
the base and the Ctenohystrica at the base). All other
nodes were identical between the topologies. Nucleotide
sites were classified according to their average rate over the
three topologies. Rates were normalized so that the average rate across all sites was 0. Rates ranged between –
0.698 to 3.989. The fastest-evolving sites were then progressively removed to create nine datasets: all sites; sites
with rates ≤ 3.5; sites with rates ≤ 3.0; sites with rates ≤ 2.5;
sites with rates ≤ 2.0; sites with rates ≤ 1.5; sites with rates
≤ 1.0; sites with rates ≤ 0.5; and sites with rates ≤ 0. Bootstrap values were computed with the program Treefinder
[66]. For each dataset, the ML tree and parameters were
estimated by Treefinder under the GTR+Γ+I model. These
ML parameters were then used to perform a bootstrap
analysis using 500 replicates.

Use of complex evolutionary models
It has been shown that using codon-based models can
improve phylogenetic inference from protein-coding
genes [67]. This method is computationally intensive,
thus precluding the computation of bootstrap values for a
dataset of 49 species. To this end, maximal log-likelihoods of the three topologies involving basal rodent relationships were compared using the program CONSEL
[63]. For this comparison, site-wise log-likelihoods of
each topology under two codon models were computed
using the program SELECTON version 2.3 [68]. The first
model, M8, allows for positive selection operating on the
protein [69]. The second model, M8a, does not allow for
positive selection [70]. In both codon analyses, four
Gamma-rate categories were used to account for amongsite rate variation.

Removing sites based on their evolutionary rate does not
allow differentiation between sites with few character
states (e.g. sites with only purines or only pyrimidines)
from sites with all possible character states (e.g. sites with
all four bases). However, if two positions evolve under the
same substitution rate, we can expect the one with more
character states to be less homoplasious. Consequently,
we used CI values as a measure of the level of homoplasy.
It is worth noting that CI and site specific rates are weekly
correlated (Additional file 6). For each of the three topologies described above, the CI of each site was computed
using PAUP* and sites were classified according to their
average CI values across the three topologies. Seven datasets were constructed by eliminating some sites based on
their CI values (retaining all sites; retaining sites with CI >
0.1; retaining sites with CI > 0.2; retaining sites with CI >
0.3; retaining sites with CI > 0.4; retaining sites with CI >
0.5; and retaining sites with CI > 0.6). Bootstrap values
were then computed as described above.
Character recoding
Since the third codon position generally evolves at the
highest rate, we performed two types of ML analyses that
were intended to reduce the impact of this high rate. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed either without third
codon position or using RY coding at the third codon

Heterotachy (covarion) is define as the variation of the evolutionary rate within a given site, and it was shown to have
an impact on phylogenetic inferences [e.g., [71]]. Consequently, the covarion model developed by Galtier [72],
extended to amino-acids [73] was used to compute the sitewise log-likelihoods of the three topologies involving basal
rodent relationships. Four Gamma-rate categories were
used to account for among-site rate variation. The C++ code
for computing site-wise log-likelihoods under the covarion
model is available from the authors upon request.
The support for each topology under the codon and covarion models was compared to the support under the JTT
model. The program Rate4Site was used to obtain the sitewise log-likelihood of the three topologies tested, and these
site-wise log-likelihoods were used as input to CONSEL.
