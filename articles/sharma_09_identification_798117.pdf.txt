Abstract
Background: Despite great advances in genomic technology observed in several crop species, the availability of
molecular tools such as microsatellite markers has been limited in tea (Camellia sinensis L.). The development of
microsatellite markers will have a major impact on genetic analysis, gene mapping and marker assisted breeding.
Unigene derived microsatellite (UGMS) markers identified from publicly available sequence database have the
advantage of assaying variation in the expressed component of the genome with unique identity and position.
Therefore, they can serve as efficient and cost effective alternative markers in such species.
Results: Considering the multiple advantages of UGMS markers, 1,223 unigenes were predicted from 2,181
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of tea (Camellia sinensis L.). A total of 109 (8.9%) unigenes containing 120 SSRs
were identified. SSR abundance was one in every 3.55 kb of EST sequences. The microsatellites mainly comprised
of di (50.8%), tri (30.8%), tetra (6.6%), penta (7.5%) and few hexa (4.1%) nucleotide repeats. Among the
dinucleotide repeats, (GA)n.(TC)n were most abundant (83.6%). Ninety six primer pairs could be designed form
83.5% of SSR containing unigenes. Of these, 61 (63.5%) primer pairs were experimentally validated and used to
investigate the genetic diversity among the 34 accessions of different Camellia spp. Fifty one primer pairs (83.6%)
were successfully cross transferred to the related species at various levels. Functional annotation of the unigenes
containing SSRs was done through gene ontology (GO) characterization. Thirty six (60%) of them revealed
significant sequence similarity with the known/putative proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. Polymorphism information
content (PIC) ranged from 0.018 to 0.972 with a mean value of 0.497. The average heterozygosity expected (HE)
and observed (Ho) obtained was 0.654 and 0.413 respectively, thereby suggesting highly heterogeneous nature of
tea. Further, test for IAM and SMM models for the UGMS loci showed excess heterozygosity and did not show
any bottleneck operating in the tea population.
Conclusion: UGMS markers identified and characterized in this study provided insight about the abundance and
distribution of SSR in the expressed genome of C. sinensis. The identification and validation of 61 new UGMS
markers will not only help in intra and inter specific genetic diversity assessment but also be enriching limited
microsatellite markers resource in tea. Further, the use of these markers would reduce the cost and facilitate the
gene mapping and marker-aided selection in tea. Since, 36 of these UGMS markers correspond to the Arabidopsis
protein sequence data with known functions will offer the opportunity to investigate the consequences of SSR
polymorphism on gene functions.

Background
The ubiquity of microsatellite or simple sequence repeats
(SSRs) in eukaryotic genomes and their usefulness as
genetic markers has been well established over the last
decade. Microsatellites are mainly characterized by high
frequency, co-dominance, multi-allelic nature, reproducibility, extensive genome coverage and ease of detection by
polymerase chain reaction with unique primer pairs that
flank the repeat motif [1]. As a result of these characteristics, microsatellites have become the most favoured
genetic markers for plant breeding and genetics applications such as, assessment of genetic diversity, constructing
framework genetic maps, mapping of useful genes,
marker aided selection and comparative mapping studies
[2,3].
In general, SSRs are identified from either genomic DNA
or cDNA sequences. The standard method for development of SSR markers involves the creation of small insert
genomic DNA libraries, followed by a subsequent DNA
hybridization selection by probing them either with radioactively labeled probes or trapping them with biotinylated SSR motifs, and clone sequencing [4,5]. These
processes are time consuming, and labour intensive. Furthermore, SSRs acquired by these methods are limited
with probed SSR motifs (most common are di or tri
types), and hence the advantages are partially offset. Availability and continuous enrichment of expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov in
most of the crop species can serve as an alternative strategy
for identification and development of microsatellite
markers. SSRs can be directly sourced from such databases, thereby reducing time and cost for microsatellite
development. However, non-availability of sufficient
sequence information (as generation of EST-SSR markers
is primarily limited to those species and their close relatives for which large number of ESTs are available) and
redundancy that yield multiple set of markers at the same
locus are among the major drawbacks of EST derived microsatellite markers. More recently unique gene sequences
(unigenes) have been developed via clustering of overlapping EST sequences, which overcomes the problem of
redundancy in EST database and detect variation in the
functional genome with unique identity and position [6].
Parida et al. [7] identified and characterized microsatellite
motifs in the unigenes available in five cereal crops (rice,
wheat, maize, sorghum, barley) and Arabidopsis. These
unigene derived microsatellite (UGMS) markers are
expected to possess high inter specific transferability as
they belong to relatively conserved regions of the genome.
Tea is the oldest, widely consumed and least expensive
natural beverage grown mostly in the tropical countries of
Asia (India, Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia), Africa (Kenya,
Uganda, Malawi) and to some extent Latin America

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/53

(Argentina). Three Camellia species namely C. sinensis L.
(small leaves), C. assamica (Masters; big leaf) and C. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx (Planchon ex Watt; intermediate leaf),
traditionally referred as China, Assam and Cambod varieties, respectively are the important source of foreign
exchange for almost all the tea producing countries in the
world, including India. The complex life cycle and out
breeding nature of tea poses several limitations for its
genetic improvement through conventional breeding. The
discrimination between true archetypal China, Assam and
Cambod varieties is difficult due to heterogeneous nature
of tea [8]. Furthermore, morphological characteristics are
unable to reflect the inherent genetic variation within the
crop, which actually shows high plasticity with respect to
biochemical and physiochemical descriptors [9-12].
Therefore, identification of highly reliable molecular tools
such as microsatellite or SSR markers is extremely important to reveal the unexplored genetic variation in tea.
Despite the obvious advantages of microsatellite markers
in terms of inferring allelic variation, estimating gene flow
and development of genetic linkage maps [1], only a few
microsatellite makers have been reported in tea [13-15].
Over the past few years, various EST projects and studies
[16-18] have generated publicly available EST sequence
data in tea. These ESTs were mostly derived from different
organs/tissues such as, young & mature leaves and tender
shoots under natural environmental conditions. Considering the multiple applications of such data in gene discovery and comparative genomics, publicly available EST
sequence data (as on May 21, 2006) in C. sinensis was
mined in the present study for SSR identification via clustering random ESTs into unigenes/contigs. These unigenes
were also searched for abundance, repeat motif types and
pattern of distribution of SSRs in the non-redundant (NR)
expressed genome of tea. Functional analysis of unigenes
containing SSRs was done through gene ontology (GO)
annotations with the Arabidopsis information resource
http://www.arabidopsis.org.
We report the development of UGMS primer pairs flanking these microsatellite motifs additional to those
reported by Zhao et al. [15]. The UGMS markers developed were also tested for cross species transferability to
different Camellia species. Locus orthology was monitored
by analyzing the amplification patterns and by sequencing selected amplicons. Polymorphisms detected within
the accessions of one species and between a set of Camellia
species was also analyzed to assess as to whether these
markers could be useful for diversity studies and also for
distinguishing the Camellia species.

Results
ESTs/Unigenes data set
A total 1,223 (893 singletons and 330 contigs) unigenes
were predicted from 2,181 publicly available EST database

in C. sinensis by clustering of 2 â 34 random EST
sequences. Non-redundant (NR) sequence data set represented ~425.67 kb expressed genome of tea (C. sinensis).
Abundance and distribution of SSRs
All 1,223 potential unigenes were searched for the presence of microsatellites. A total of 109 (8.9%) unigenes
containing 120 SSRs with motif length ranging from 2 to
6 bp were identified (Additional file 1). One sequence
contained three SSRs and three sequences contained two
SSRs each. Six SSRs were of compound types (SSR containing stretches of two or more different repeats). Of these,
four compound SSRs were uninterrupted, while remaining two were interrupted by the presence of â¤ 8 arbitrary
nucleotides. One SSR was detected for every 3.55 kb of the
EST sequences. Further analysis of SSR containing unigene
sequence data revealed that majority of them (94.1%)
were perfect repeat and/or class I (â¥20 nucleotides; nts
length). However, remaining 5.8% (comprising of 2.5%
di repeats and 0.83% each of tri repeats, tetra and penta
repeats) were found to be of class II types (â¥12 nts and
<20 nts length).

Data analysis of SSR motifs in unigenes revealed 61 di
repeats (50.8%), 37 tri repeats (30.8%), 8 tetra repeats
(6.67%), 9 penta repeats (7.5%) and 5 hexa repeats
(4.16%) (Table 1). Among the di-nucleotide repeats the
(TC)n.(GA)n motifs were most abundant (83.6%) followed by (CA)n.(TG)n and (TA)n. Among the mirosatellites containing tri-repeats, (CAT)n.(ATG)n and
(TTC)n.(GAA)n were the maximum (18.9%), which was
followed by (TGG)n.(CCA)n and (CTG)n.(CAG)n. Abundance of other tri repeat containing SSRs were more or less
in the similar range. Frequency of tetra, penta and hexa
repeat containing SSRs was the least.
UGMS primer designation
Of the 109 NR unigenes containing one or more SSRs, 91
(83.5%) were amenable to design flanking oligonucleotide primer pairs. Ninety six UGMS primer pairs (55
from singletons and 41 from clusters) flanking to different
repeat motifs could be designed. Primer pairs flanking di
repeats (54.2%) were the most abundant followed by tri
(30%), penta (8.3%), tetra (5.2%) and hexa (2.1%)
repeats containing microsatellites. Primers could not be
designed for the rest eighteen (16.5%) SSR containing
unigenes because of either insufficient flanking sequence
(occurrence of SSR near or/at either end of the unigene) or
inability to fulfill the criteria for primer design. Five
(4.6%) of the 109 unigenes were used to design more
than one primer pairs targeting NR SSR loci. Thus, a nonredundant set of UGMS primers could be designed for
7.4% of the total unigene sequences in our study.

Annotations and functional classification
Of the 60 unigenes that had successful primer pairs developed and validated, 36 (60%) matched to Arabidopsis
genes with high expectation value (Table 2). To get a better view of the annotated unigenes, we downloaded Gene
Ontology (GO) annotations [19] from the TAIR website
[20] to classify SSRs containing unigenes into functional
categories. Relative frequencies of GO hits for C. sinensis
unigenes were assigned to the functional categories. Biological process, cellular components and molecular function as defined for Arabidopsis proteome are presented in
Figure 1. In case of biological processes, the C. sinensis unigenes were assigned to thirteen categories. Majority were
assigned to the two categories namely "other metabolic
processes" (22.98%) and "other cellular processes"
(21.84%). However, other important categories were
"protein metabolism" (10.35%), "response to stress"
(6.9%), "cell organization and biogenesis" (5.74%), etc.
For the cellular components, the unigenes were assigned
in thirteen categories with majority of them representing
genes participating in "other intracellular components"
(18.23%), "other cytoplasmic components" (14.84%)
and "other membranes components" (13.8%). The
remaining were assigned to important cellular components of "chloroplast" (12.16%), "ribosomes" (4.97%),
"mitochondria" (3.88%), etc. When grouped according to
likely molecular functions, the unigenes were assigned to
fourteen categories and covered "protein binding"
(10.23%), "other binding domains" (14.77%), "structural molecular activity" (10.23%), "various catalytic protein groups" (hydrolase, 6.8%; kinase, 1.14%) etc. There
was considerable representation of unknown processes or
fractions irrespective of the GO categories such as
"unknown molecular functions" (26.14%), "unknown
biological processes" (9.77%) and "unknown cellular
components" (8.29%).

In general, the SSRs containing unigene sequences
detected in tea were homologous to proteins having distinct molecular functions such as, binding, catalytic, transport, enzyme regulators, and structural activities in
different biological processes, and cellular and sub-cellular organization.
Marker evaluation and polymorphism detection
Ninety six primer pairs designed in this study were used to
amplify DNA from a panel of 34 accessions of cultivated
tea and related species. Of these, 61 (63.5%) primer pairs
produced repeatable and reliable amplifications in at least
four accessions of tea, while 35 (36.5%) primer pairs
either completely failed or led to weak amplifications and
thus were excluded from further analysis. Marker evaluation details are given in Table 3. PCR products of the
expected size were obtained in all the cases except in one
UGMS primer (TUGMS83) that had amplified larger size

additional amplicons in some cases. Multi-locus amplifications were recorded in case of TUGMS27 and
TUGMS46. Over all, amplification success rate was the
maximum in case of TUGMS primer pairs containing tri
repeats (72%), followed by di-repeat (61.5%). The PCR
success rate of UGMS classes having tetra, penta and hexa
repeats were ranged from 50% to 60%. Seven polymorphic primer pairs namely TUGMS3, TUGMS7, TUGMS33,
TUGMS46, TUGMS52, TUGMS75, TUGMS85 gave amplification in all the tested genotypes irrespective of species
(Table 3) and hence can be utilized as universal markers
for molecular analysis in tea. However, these markers
need to be validated in a larger panel of Camellia species.
Sixty one primer pairs amplified 324 alleles of which 321
(99%) were found to be polymorphic. All the UGMS
markers identified in the present study remained highly
polymorphic (Figure 2). The number of alleles detected in
the present case ranged from 2 to 16 with an average of
5.3. The UGMS markers namely TUGMS52 and
TUGMS15 recorded a maximum of 16 and 15 alleles,
respectively. Total number of alleles detected among the
accessions belonging to three varietal types i.e. Assam,
Cambod and China were 213, 214 & 278, respectively. A

high level of polymorphism has been observed at the species level. No significant difference was detected in percentage polymorphism of China and Assam (~94% in
each case), however, due to hybrid nature of C. assamica
ssp. lasiocalyx, a slightly higher level of polymorphism
(98.4%) was recorded in Cambod. The HE and Ho ranged
from 0.140 to 0.909 (with an average of 0.654) and 0.029
to 0.853 (with an average of 0.413), respectively (Table
3). All the UGMS markers showed a significant departure
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) at P < 0.001
level. The polymorphism information content (PIC)
ranged from 0.018 to 0.972 with an average of 0.497.
There was significant difference in the average PIC values
was recorded in UGMS locus harboring different repeat
types. Average PIC values ranged from 0.183 (penta
repeats) to 0.725 (tetra repeats). However, an average of
0.578 and 0.390 PIC values were recorded in TUGMS
primers with di and tri repeats, respectively (Table 3). Of
the 34 UGMS primer pairs with PIC values â¥ 0.50, 5
(13.8%) namely TUGMS3, TUGMS52, TUGMS73,
TUGMS74, TUGMS78 recorded amplification in â¥30

tified, which may also be categorized as informative primers after their validation in a larger panel of tea accessions.
In mutation drift equilibrium, heterozygosity excess/deficiency under different mutation models (IAM & SMM)
generated by BOTTLENECK showed significant excess of
heterozygosity in both the models. All the tested loci
showed excess heterozygosity in sign test and found to be
significant in both standardized and Wilcoxen test (Table
4).
Cross-species transferability
To assess the conservation of C. sinensis UGMS loci across
the Camellia species, we tested the cross amplification of
61 primer pairs on five species representing ten accessions
each of C. assamica and C. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx (cultivated tea) and one accession each representing C. lutescens, C. irrawadiensis, C. japonica white flower and C.
japonica red flower (wild and/or ornamental species).
Except for the annealing temperature (Ta), identical PCR
conditions were used to assess the extent of transferability
to related species. All the 61 primers recorded transferability in C. assamica and C. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx showing
high degree of locus conservation in the cultivated species.
However, 51 UGMS primers gave reproducible amplifica-

tion at least in a single related species (C. lutescens; 63.4%,
C. irrawadiensis; 34.4%, C. japonica; red; 59% and white
flower; 57.4%) and recorded an overall 83.6% cross transferability rate. Marker wise amplification pattern of successful UGMS primers is presented in Table 5.
Furthermore, transferability rate was significantly higher
in TUGMS primers containing tri or hexa repeats (â¥ 95%)
followed by the primers with di and penta repeats (75%
in each case). Least transferability was recorded in primers
with tetra repeats. As a whole, 15 (~25%) UGMS primers
recorded cross-transferability in all the tested species.
Sequence comparison of SSR locus
To validate the conservation of SSRs across the varieties
and species, at least one amplicon from different genotypes/species and multiple amplicons from the same genotypes were sequenced. Multiple amplicons from single
genotype were selected to determine the orthology and
paralogy of the sequence. When a locus wise DNA
sequences data in each case was compared, it showed electromorphic size variation solely attributed either due to
expansion/contraction of the SSRs, or due to interruptions
in the SSR regions. This was most notable among different
alleles where the size differences resulted from either simple or complex variation in SSR motifs. Even at the multi-

ple amplicons from the diploid genotypes similar
situation was noticed. As illustrated in Figure 3, the size of
the multiple amplicons having (GA)n motif and consumed primer sites were 95, 89, 82 bp longer in case of
genotype UPASI-10 for marker TUGMS27. Similarly, for
the Kangra Jat genotype amplicon size 124, 138 and 151
bp were obtained for TUGMS46 that amplified TC
repeats. Similar situation was observed with identical
amplicon size, and repeat motifs for allelic amplicons
from different genotypes as in case of TUGMS3 and
TUGMS53, respectively. Further, in order to confirm DNA
polymorphism and cross-transferability at the sequence
level, selected amplicons from C. lutescens, C. irrawadiensis
and C. japonica (RF: red flower & WF; white flower) were
sequenced for three UGMS primers namely TUGMS3,
TUGMS-34 and 73. The presence of the target microsatellites were observed in all the cases (Figure 4).

Inter and intra specific genetic variations among the tea
accessions
In the present study, correlations observed between the
genetic similarity (GS) matrixes based on Jaccard's and
Nei and Li's coefficients methods was 0.991. The average
GS among the 34 accessions of Camellia species was 22%.
Within C. sinensis, GS ranged from 26% between Kangra
Jat and Sikkim-1 to 59% between Teesta Valley-1 and Sikkim-1. Within C. assamica GS was ranging from 15% to
71%, where as GS ranged from 26% to 46% in C. assamica
ssp. lasiocalyx. The average GS remained almost similar in
case of C. assamica (Assam; 28.6%) and C. assamica ssp.
lasiocalyx (Cambod; 28%), while slightly less among the
accessions of C. sinensis (China; 27%). We recorded 37%
GS between the two accessions of ornamental types C.
japonica with red and white flowers.

based on Nei and Li distance. Tree branched with bootstrap values greater than 60% are indicated. The scale bar represents
simple matching distance.

Cluster analysis
The phenetic analysis of the UGMS data by two methods
showed distinct groups and subgroups (Figure 5a &5b).
The cluster analysis with Jaccard's similarity matrix corresponded well with the Nei and Li's matrix. Though minor
changes were evident within the subclusters of the major
varietal types, the relative position of the major clusters
remained preserved. The neighbour joining (NJ) tree was
more precise in differentiating the closely related accessions with high bootstrap values (Figure 5b). Clustering of
thirty four accessions of genus Camellia into three major
groups was strongly supported by high bootstrap values
(â¥ 90%). However, accession of C. lutescens remained isolated as a single solitary genotype with 100% bootstrap
value and defined as outgroup. All the China accessions
were clustered together in group I. However, two accessions namely UPASI 6 (Assam) and C-6017 (Cambod)
were also clustered in this group. Majority of Assam and
Cambod tea accession clustered together in group II with

bootstrap values of 65%. All but one (TV-19), TV series
accessions representing either Assam or Cambod also
clustered together in group II. Interestingly, two accessions namely UPASI 13 and UPASI 9 known for excellent
spread and are the source of good quality tea, remained
together as intermediates between groups I and II. Accession 124/48/8, an extreme Cambod type with broad-elliptic leaves without distinct marginal veins with pink
pigmentation at the petiole base, along with TV-19 (Cambod) clustered as an intermediate group between ornamentals and cultivated tea accessions. As expected, all the
three species (C. irrawadiensis, C. lutescens, C. japonica with
white and red flower) clustered separately in the present
case.

Discussion
Abundance and distribution of SSRs and UGMS primer
development
The present study was designed to utilize the publicly
available tea ESTs for development of reliable UGMS
markers. We assembled ESTs into unigenes, consisting of
consensus sequences of contigs and the singleton
sequences for SSR analysis. The assembly generates longer
sequences, which gives a better chance of association of
sequences with the proteins. Generation of longer
sequences can be useful for SSR studies since it can give
longer SSR surrounding sequences for primer designing.
In addition, the use of NR sequences can give a better estimation of the sequence features in the genome.

In case of tea, we found that 8.9% unigenes contained NR
SSRs. This EST-SSR frequency was in the 2.65 â 10.62%
range obtained for 49 dicot species [21]. However, it was
higher than the 1.5 â 4.7% range reported for monocots
[22]. Frequency of EST-SSRs in various plant genomes is
significantly influenced by the repeat length and the criteria used to search the SSRs in database mining [23]. If the
repeat length is 20 bp, in general 5% of ESTs have
recorded the presence of microsatellites [6]. The present
study recorded a relatively higher abundance of SSRs as
compared to earlier reports in tea [15] and also in other
plant species such as grapes [24], sugarcane [25], cereals
[7,22,26] and coffee ESTs [23,27]. Cardle et al. [28] in a
comprehensive computational and experimental characterization of publicly available EST sequence database of
different plant genomes recorded a significant difference
in the type and abundance of SSRs. The average distribution of SSRs estimated to be ranging from 3.4 kb in rice to
7.4 kb in soybean, 8.1 kb in maize, 11.1 kb in tomato,
13.8 in Arabidopsis, 14.0 kb in popular and 20 kb in cotton. Furthermore, occurrence of high frequency of Class I
(94.1%) and or perfect repeats in the present case is possibly due to the criteria that had been implemented for
mining of SSRs. Experimental data originally reported for
human [29] and then confirmed in many other organisms
including rice [30,31] had suggested that longer perfect
repeats are more polymorphic. The rate of strand slippage
has been shown to increase with increasing length of
blocks of repeats. Therefore, longer perfect repeats are
highly variable. However, the lower rate of polymorphism
of repeat sequences containing interruptions may be due
to the fact that strand slippage of these sequences produces structures with non-complementary bases.
The frequency analysis of various nucleotide repeats in C.
sinensis ESTs revealed that di nucleotide SSRs were the
most abundant SSRs followed by tri-, tetra-, penta- and
hexa repeats. This is in agreement with the frequency
trend has been earlier reported in tea [15]. In general, microsatellites containing tri-repeats remained most com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/53

mon among the monocots and dicots [6]. However,
Kumpata and Mukhopadhyay [21] recorded the abundance of di-repeats in most of the dicots species investigated. High frequency of di-nucleotide repeat has also
been reported in case of eucalyptus [32] and citrus [33]
ESTs. High frequency of dinucleotide repeats as observed
in the present case could be because ~70% of the overall
sequences included in analysis correspond to 5' end of the
transcript [17], which included 5' UTRs. Hence, representation of di nucleotide repeats in this region would not
affect the reading frame and thus tolerated more as compared to amino acid coding regions. However, certain frequency of di nucleotide could be abundant in the coding
regions such (TC)n.(GA)n in the present case, which
might represent GAG, AGA, UCU and CUC codon in a
mRNA population and translate into the amino acids Arg,
Glu, Ala and Leu, respectively. Ala and Leu are present in
proteins at high frequencies of 8% and 10%, respectively
[34]. (TC)n.(GA)n motifs were also the most frequently
observed SSRs in different plant species including coffee,
cereals and forage crops [23,26,31,34] and also in other
perennial crops, such as eucalyptus [32], apple [35],
strawberry [36] and citrus [37,38].
The most abundant tri nucleotide repeats observed in
present study were (CAT)n.(ATG)n and (TTC)n.(GAA)n
making up 18.9% each of total tri-repeats mined, which is
the second most abundant motif in Arabidopsis [7]. Further, (CCG)n.(CGG)n repeats, which accounted for half
of the tri repeats in rice, were rare in dicots (Arabidopsis
and soybean) and moderately abundant in monocots
other than rice [39], were found to be ~8% of mined trinucleotide repeats in present case. Parida et al [7], while
analyzing the unigenes sequence data of five cereals and
Arabidopsis observed that monocot and dicots possess
common tri repeats. AGC/AGT/TCA/TCC/TCG/TCT
(16.6%) coding for serine was the most abundant motifs
in Arabidopsis, followed by glutamic acid (GAA/GAG,
12.3%) and leucine (CTA/CTC/CTG/CTT/CTC/TTA/TTG,
10.9%). Abundance of small/hydrophilic amino acid
repeat motifs like that of alanine and serine in the unigenes of cereals and Arabidopsis was perhaps because these
are tolerated in many proteins, while strong selection
pressure possibly eliminates codon repeats encoding
hydrophobic/other amino acids [40]. This observation
suggested that considerable sequence divergence, since
their early separation about 200 million year ago,
between monocot and dicot has led to differential amino
acid repeat motifs in the proteins, and that the selection
has played a significant role in greater retention of those
which are tolerated more.
The overall frequency of NR UGMS primer designation
was 7.4% of the unigene sequence data. This figure is significantly higher than that found in the case of grapes and

sugarcane [24,25], where the frequency of non-redundant
SSRs in the total population of the clones in the cDNA
library was 2.5% and 2.88%, respectively.
Functional characterization
We characterized a set of unigenes containing successful
UGMS markers by function. Since, the ESTs utilized here
were obtained mostly from leaf and tender shoot tissues
under natural environmental conditions hence, functional classification in relation to the organ or physiological conditions is not possible with the available data.
However, a considerable frequency (60%) of unigenes
containing UGMS markers was identified that correspond
to the Arabidopsis gene sequence data base. These markers
were present either in 5' UTR (52.8%) or in the ORFs
(47.2%). As observed in earlier studies, majority of the
transcripts detected through GO annotations represent
enzymes of general metabolism [32,35,36]. However,
transcripts related to biological process such as response
to abiotic and biotic stresses can be readily mapped using
the existing populations. This might reveal functional
identity of particular marker locus. Since, these markers
have recorded allelic variation across selected tea accessions, thereby working with these UGMS markers may
arguably provide a shortcut to candidate genes and gene
based functional markers. One of the approaches for their
functional validation could be the establishment of association between trait phenotypes and UGMS markers
based on these unigenes. In this context, UGMS primer
pairs designed in tea would be very important assets for
understanding functional diversity and also in markerassisted breeding in this important commercial crop.
Marker evaluation and polymorphism detection
Only 63.5% of the designed UGMS primer pairs proved to
be functional. Similar findings were made for sugarcane
[25], where 40% of all primer pairs failed to amplify the
products. Possible explanation for this could be that primers extend across a splice site, the presence of large intron
in the genomic sequence, or primers that were derived
from chimeric cDNA clones. In general, because of conserved nature, limited polymorphism has been detected
for EST-SSRs than the SSRs derived from genomic libraries
[30,41,42]. Contrarily, a high level of polymorphism was
detected in present case irrespective of the Camellia species. This is in agreement with some earlier studies that
reported high [43,44] to even higher level of polymorphism with EST-SSR markers than genomic SSRs markers
[6,45]. Furthermore, the ability to detect per primer a
higher number of alleles than Zhao et al. [15] might be
due to high abundance of di-repeats containing UGMS
primer pairs (62%). However, the average number of alleles observed in this study remained comparatively lower
than that for genomic microstellites (8.3 alleles and 7.8
alleles per primer, respectively) reported by Freeman et al.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/53

[13] and Hung et al. [14]. Detection of larger amplicons
than the expected in few cases was probably due to the
presence of introns which were excluded during processing of hnRNA into mRNA. Alternatively, multi-locus
amplification detected with limited cases, were probably
due to duplication and heterozygosity in tea, as was previously reported in tall fescue [44] and wheat [46]. The
mean PIC estimated for genomic SSRs in tea [13], is
higher than the estimated mean PIC for UGMS markers in
the present study. The mean heterozygosities expected
(HE; 0.654) and observed (Ho; 0.413) estimates were also
slightly less in the present study [15]. Further, test for IAM
(Infinite allele model) and SMM models (Stepwise mutation model) for the UGMS loci showed excess heterozygosity in sign test and found to be significant in
standardized and Wilcoxon test suggested that the studied
marker loci did not show any bottleneck operating in the
tea population and remain highly out breeding.
Cross species amplification and sequence comparison of
UGMS markers
UGMS markers identified in present study are highly
transferable with in species and, frequently among species
as reported in barley [26]. For instance, all the 61 UGMS
markers developed for C. sinensis are fully transferable to
C. assamica &C. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx, and at the various
levels to C. lutescens; C. irrawadiensis, C. japonica white
flower and C. japonica red flower. Similar pattern of cross
transferability has been recorded in case of genomic SSRs
in earlier studies in tea [13,14]. Interestingly, there were
15 (~25%) of the UGMS primer pairs which recorded
cross-transferability in all the tested species. This suggested possible representation of highly conserved genes
with some important biological/cellular/molecular functions. Further, conservation of repeat motif sequences at
the species level and even at the multiple amplicons from
the diploid genotypes suggests the wider utility of UGMS
markers. Conservation of multiple repeats in diploid genotypes suggests presence of paralogs due to duplication of
a particular locus within the genome.
UGMS markers for evaluation of inter and intra specific
genetic variations
The results obtained with 34 accessions tested from six tea
species indicate that UGMS markers could be utilized for
evaluation of genetic relationships within and at the species level. The genetic similarity matrix obtained from the
two methods (Jaccard's and Nei & Li's) was significantly
correlated confirm the utility of UGMS markers in tea. The
genetic relationship among the cultivated C. sinensis, C.
assamica and C. assamica ssp lasicalayx accessions reported
in this study (GS; 28%) is comparable with RAPD based
genetic relationship in 34 Keneyan accessions by Wachira
et al. [47]. However, overall an extensive genetic variation
was obtained at the intra and inter species level among the

34 accessions [48-52]. The difference in GS might be due
to the use of different markers which most likely assay variation in the different genomic regions. However, SSR variation within the genic regions should be very critical for
gene activity. Few of the UGMS markers that have shown
significant hits in the Arabidopsis proteome can occupy
certain positions in coding regions. Expansion and contraction of SSR repeats with known function in these
regions might help to establish the association with phenotypic variation as reported earlier in the case of rice [53]
and should detect "true genetic diversity" in crop species
[26,54,55].
Cluster analysis of 34 tea accessions representing C. sinensis and related species revealed genetic affinities (Figure 5a
&5b), which were broadly in agreement with known taxonomic classification of tea [56]. Traditionally, Cambod
is considered a sub group of Assam type or sometimes

referred to as a subspecies of Assamica known as lasiocalyx
[56], therefore, majority of C. assamica (Assam) and C.
assamica ssp. lasiocalyx (Cambod) tea accessions were clustered together in group II with high bootstrap values. Betjan 3/1, a fast growing, high quality tea accession, being
an extreme Assam type was also clustered in this group
[57]. Tea accessions namely TV-15 and TV-16 are moderately tolerant to tolerant to drought and hence clustered as
a distinct subgroup under the major group II. Possible
explanation of clustering TV-19 (Cambod; drought tolerant high yielder) and 124/53/8 (an extreme Cambod
type) as an intermediate group between ornamental and
cultivated accessions is due to their development from
progenies of open pollinated seeds. TV-19 developed,
introduced by T.C. Tunstall in the year 1918 was selected
from progenies 124/53/25 and 124/41/42 of St.124
developed through open pollinated seeds collected from
plants of 19/22 [58]. Further, C. irrawadiensis clustered

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:53

along with two accessions of C. japonica, with red and
white flowers in group III suggesting a possibility of introgressive hybridization between these two species. In general, limited introgressive hybridization had occurred in
wild/ornamental species because of small populations
and narrow geographical distributions. This might also be
the reason for clustering of C. lutescens as a single solitary
out-group in the present study. Conversely, self incompatibility and long term allogamy make the cultivated tea
accessions highly heterogeneous and consequently with
broad genetic variations [51].

Conclusion
Our study revealed the insight of abundance and distribution of microsatellite in the expressed component of the
tea genome. Sixty one UGMS markers developed and
experimentally validated for genetic diversity analysis in
different Camellia spp. will be enriching the limited existing microsatellite markers resource in tea. Most of the
UGMS primers were highly polymorphic and were able to
unambiguously differentiate the tea germplasm at the
inter and intra specific levels. The use of these markers
would reduce the cost and facilitate genetic diversity
assessment, gene mapping and marker-aided selection in
tea. Functional categorization of these UGMS markers corresponded to many genes with biological, cellular and
molecular functions, and hence offer an opportunity to
investigate the consequences of SSR polymorphism on
gene functions.

Methods
Plant materials
Screening of newly identified UGMS markers was performed on a test array of 34 accessions of Camellia species
(Table 6). This included 30 accessions of the main class of
cultivated tea belonging to three major traditional varietal
types namely C. sinensis (China type), C. assamica (Assam
type) and C. assamica ssp.lasiocalyx (Cambod or Indian
type). Three Camellia species comprising of C. lutescens, C.
irrawadiensis, C. japonica (red flower), C. japonica (white
flower), significantly exploited either in tea improvement
programme as wilds and/or as ornamentals used for the
examination of cross-species amplification of newly identified UGMS markers. The genomic DNA from the individual tea bush in each case was isolated from young
leaves using CTAB method as described by Doyle and
Doyle [59] with minor modifications.
EST data mining, unigenes prediction and SSR detection
A total of 2,181 FASTA formatted EST sequences in Camellia sinensis were retrieved on May 21, 2006 from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez) for subsequent data
mining. This dataset was scanned and assembled using
SeqMan DNA Star lasergene version 7.1 (DNASTAR Inc,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/53

Madison, WI) and predicted potential unigenes that contained contigs and singletons from all the EST sequences
with parameters (match size: 5, minimum match percentage: 80, match spacing: 150, gap penalty: 0.00, gap length
penalty: 0.70, maximum mismatch bases: 15). Further,
gaps in the aligned sequences due to limited dataset were
removed on the basis of probability function of nucleotide occurring at the particular position using Gene Runner version 3.05 nucleotide windows and stored as the
relational database. All the unigenes were subsequently
searched individually for the presence of SSRs with help of
Repeat masker http://www.repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/
WEBRepeatMasker and SSRs with a minimum length of â¥
18 bp (di & tri) and â¥ 15 bp (tetra, penta & hexa) were
masked. These parameters were chosen to identify SSRs
with high polymorphic rate. Uninterrupted type of microsatellites in the present case are continuous, however
interrupted one's are defined as presence of â¤8 arbitrary
nucleotides in between â¥2 SSR motifs.
Functional characterization
Initially an annotation of the SSR containing unigenes
was done using BLAST in the complete GenBank NR database, and the complete coding sequences from Arabidopsis
[60]. Further classification of these unigenes was done
using Gene Ontology (GO) system [19]. All the Arabidopsis hits with an high expectation values (Table 2) were submitted to the GO annotation search tool at TAIR website
[20,61], and relative gene counts assigned to the different
GO functional classes were displayed as pie chart using
Microsoft Excel.

Primer pairs from the SSR containing unigenes were
designed with Gene Runner 3.05 software with the following criteria; i) nucleotide length of 18 â 22 base pairs,
ii) a Tm value of 50Â°C to 60Â°C, iii) the 3' end base with a
G or C, preferably and iv) an amplified fragment size of
100 â 350 bp. The formation of secondary structure and
primer dimmers were critically monitored to get success of
the primers. The names of the primers were prefixed as
TUGMS (Tea unigene derived microsatellite) markers as
the source is from Camellia sinensis unigene database
(Additional file 1).
PCR amplification
PCR amplification of all the primers were performed in 10
Î¼l reaction volume consisting 1Ã PCR buffer (10 mM TrispH 9.0, 50 mM KCl, 0.01% Geletin, 1.5 mM MgCl2), 200
Î¼M of each dNTPs, 15 ng each of forward and reverse
primers, 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase (Bangalore Genei)
and 20 ng of template DNA. Forward primer was labeled
with Î³33P ATP (phosphorylation by T4 polynucleotide
kinase). The PCR protocol was consisted of one denaturation cycle at 94Â°C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of
94Â°C for 1 min, annealing at optimum temperature (Ta)

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:53

(Table 3) for 1 min, and extension at 72Â°C for 2 min. The
final extension cycle was carried out at 72Â°C for 7 min. All
the PCR reactions were carried in I-Cycler (Bio-Rad).
PCR fragments were separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels consisting of 7% polyacrylamide (AA: BIS =
19:1) and 7 M urea in 1Ã TBE buffer. The PCR reactions
were mixed with equal volume of loading buffer (98%
formamide containing 0.8 mM EDTA and 0.025% of each
bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol), denatured at
94Â°C for 5 min and snap cooled on ice. Samples were
loaded in preheated Sequi-Gen GT sequencing cells (Bio
Rad, Australia), which run at 60 W for 1.5 up to 2.0 hrs
depending upon the fragment sizes to be separated. After
run, the gel was blotted on the chromatographic paper
CP3M (PALL Life Sciences) and vacuum dried for two hrs
before subjecting it to autoradiography for 2â3 days at 70Â°C depending on the signal intensity. The size of the
fragments was estimated using 20 bp DNA size standard
(Cambrex Bioproduct, USA).
Sequencing of PCR product
PCR products were separated on polyacralamide gel.
Selected fragments were excised and dipped in 10 Î¼l
nuclease free water for 30 min. Another round of PCR was
made following the same protocol with extracted DNA as
template. The PCR products were separated on 2%
Seakem LE agarose (Cambrex bioproduct, USA) gel and
extracted using kit (Montage Millipore Corp, USA). DNA
concentration in each case was measured using NanoDrop 1000 (NanoDrop spectrophotometer, USA). The
PCR products were ligated to pGEM-T easy vector
(Promega, USA). Sequencing was performed using ABI
3730 xl DNA Analyzer in 20 Î¼l of sequencing reactions
consisted of 250 ng of template DNA, 4.0 pmol universal
sequencing primer, 8 Î¼l of ready reaction mix BigDye terminator (Applied Biosystem Version 3.1). The base calling
and post processing of the sequence data were done using
sequence analysis software (Applied Biosystem Version
5.2). The nucleotide sequences were aligned using DNASTAR software (MegAlign DNA Star lasergene version 7.1)
using Clustal W algorithm method.
Data analysis
The fragment size is reported for the most intensely amplified band for each UGMS locus or average stutter if the
intensity was same using 20 bp DNA size standard. Null
alleles were assigned to genotypes with confirmed no
amplification products under the standard conditions.
The polymorphism determined according to the presence
(1) or absence (0) and data was entered in a binary data
matrix as discrete variables. Jaccard's coefficient was calculated to develop a phylogenetic tree on the unweighted
pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). The
computer package NTSYS-pc Ver. 2.02e, Rohlf, [62] was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/53

used for cluster analysis and matrix correlation. Genetic
similarities (GS) based on Jaccards's coefficient were again
checked by Nei and Li's formula [63] as GSxy = 2Nxy (Nx +
Ny), where Nxy is number of bands shared in accessions X
and Y, Nx is the number of bands shared in accession X, Ny
is the number of fragments shared in accessions Y, were
calculated using TREECON software package [64]. The
robustness of neighbour joining tree was evaluated by
bootstrapping (1000 bootstrap replicate) using
TREECON. Popgene software package by Yeh et al. [65]
was used to calculate heterozygosity (observed &
expected). The polymorphism information content (PIC)
of each marker was calculated according to Anderson et al.
[66]:
n

PIC i = 1 â

âP

2
ij

j=1

Where Pij is the frequency of the jth pattern for marker i
and summation extends over n patterns.
The fit of each locus distribution to expected distribution
under two different mutation models, the IAM (infinite
allele model) and SMM (step mutation model) was tested
using the program BOTTLENECK [67]. Considering the
locus limitations in data analysis using BOTTLENECK,
particularly 40 UGMS loci having detected PIC â¥ 3.0 were
selected. Observed allele frequency and sample sizes were
input parameters. These analyses provide a test statistic,
the Wilcoxon sign-rank test, for the probability that an
observed allele distribution with a given heterozygosity
(gene diversity) was generated under each of the two
mutation models.
