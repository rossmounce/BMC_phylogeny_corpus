Abstract
This is an introductory review on how genes interact to produce biological functions.
Transcriptional interactions involve the binding of proteins to regulatory DNA. Specific binding
sites can be identified by genomic analysis, and these undergo a stochastic evolution process
governed by selection, mutations, and genetic drift. We focus on the links between the biophysical
function and the evolution of regulatory elements. In particular, we infer fitness landscapes of
binding sites from genomic data, leading to a quantitative evolutionary picture of regulation.

Introduction
Genomic functions often cannot be understood at the
level of single genes but require the study of gene networks. This systems biology credo is nearly commonplace
by now. Evidence comes from the comparative analysis of
entire genomes: Current estimates put, for example, the
number of human genes at around 22000, hardly more
than the 14000 of the fruit fly, and not even an order of
magnitude higher than the 6000 of baker's yeast. The
complexity and diversity of higher animals therefore cannot be explained in terms of their gene numbers. If, however, a biological function requires the concerted action of
several genes, and conversely, a gene takes part in several
functional contexts, an organism may be defined less by
its individual genes but by their interactions. The emerging picture of the genome as a strongly interacting system
with many degrees of freedom brings new challenges for
experiment and theory, many of which are of a statistical
nature. And indeed, this picture continues to make the
subject attractive to a growing number of statistical physicists.

Genes encode proteins, and proteins perform functions in
the cell. Hence, a gene takes part in a biological function
only if it is expressed, i.e., if the protein produced from it is
present in the cell. Genes interact by regulation: the protein
of one gene can influence the production of protein from
another gene. Gene regulation can take place during transcription, the process by which the cell reads the information contained in a gene and copies it to messenger RNA
(which is subsequently used to make a functional protein). This is the most fundamental level of interactions
between genes: the transcription of one gene may be
enhanced or reduced by the expression of other genes.
Transcriptional regulation is thus a good starting point for
theory. We should keep in mind, however, that it is not
the only mode of gene interactions. Especially in eukaryotes, additional regulation mechanims involving histones,
chromatin, micro-RNAs etc. become relevant, which are
just entering the stage of model building. An excellent
introduction to the biology of regulation can be found in
[1].

This article is a primer on theoretical aspects of gene interactions, and we limit ourselves to transcriptional regulation. Clearly, the subject has rather diverse aspects:
(1) Transcription is a biophysical process, which involves
the interaction of DNA and proteins. Its regulation takes
place through the binding of proteins to DNA at specific
loci in the vicinity of the gene to be regulated. Already at
this level, this process is rather complex and not yet fully
understood. What enables the protein to find one or a few
specific functional sites in a genome of up to billions of
base pairs, bind there with sufficient strength to influence
transcription, and leave again once its task is performed?
(2) Given that the protein can find its functional sites, can
we as well? If that is possible, we can predict the specific
gene interactions building regulatory networks from
sequence data. The analysis of regulatory DNA is a major
topic of research in bioinformatics, with the aim of identifying statistical characteristics of functional loci and of
building search algorithms.
(3) Regulation is also becoming an important part of evolutionary biology [2,3]. If regulatory networks are to explain
the differentiation of higher animals, there must be efficient modes of evolution for the interactions between
genes. At the level of regulary DNA, these modes remain
largely to be explored. It is clear, however, that the underlying evolutionary dynamics is the basis of a quantitative
understanding of regulatory networks.
All three aspects of regulation contribute to a unified theoretical picture. Key concepts such as the biophysical
binding energy, the bioinformatic scoring function, and
the evolutionary fitness turn out to be rather deeply
related. We will focus on these crosslinks between different fields, which are likely to become important for future
research. A challenge for an introductory presentation is
the diversity of relevant background material, only a
rather ecclectic account of which can be presented here.
Yet, I hope it transpires even from this short introduction
that present quantitative genomics is an area of science
shaped by a remarkable confluence of ideas from different
disciplines.

upstream of its protein-coding sequence and extends over
hundreds of base pairs in prokaryotes and over thousands
of base pairs in eukaryotes. The scenario of transcriptional
regulation is sketched in Fig. 1. A transcription factor
bound to a functional binding site regulates the downstream gene by recruiting or repelling RNA polymerase.
This protein-protein interaction catalyzes or suppresses
the process of transcription of the gene. All these binding
processes should not be understood as on or off; they happen with certain probabilities, which are determined by
the binding energies and the numbers of the molecules
involved.
Factor-DNA binding energies
The interaction of a transcription factor protein with DNA
is two-fold: There is a position-unspecific attraction with
energy Eu and a specific interaction, whose energy
depends on the particular locus where the factor binds.
The unspecific part is the electrostatic interaction between
the positively charged protein and the negatively charged
DNA backbone, while the specific part involves hydrogen
bonds between the binding domain of the protein and the
nucleotides of the binding locus. A locus is specified by its
starting position r and its length ᐍ (with relevant values ᐍ
of order 10). The specific binding energy E(r) depends on
ᐍ consecutive nucleotides a = (a1,..., aᐍ) counted downstream from the starting position, the sequence state or genotype of that locus. Switching between unspecific and
specific binding takes place via a conformation change of
the factor protein. As a result of these interactions, the factor protein can be in three thermodynamic states as
shown in fig. 2: unbound (i.e., freely diffusing), unspecifically bound (i.e., diffusing along the DNA backbone),
and specifically bound.

The biophysics of factor-DNA binding has been established in a series of seminal papers [4-7]. More recently,
the characteristics of specific binding have been measured
for some bacterial transcription factors [8-12]. These can
be summarized as follows:
(a) The single nucleotides of a binding locus a = (a1,..., aᐍ)
give approximately independent contributions to the
binding energy,

Biophysics of transcriptional regulation
The fundamental step in the regulatory interaction
between two genes is a binding process: the protein produced by the first gene acts as a transcription factor for the
second gene, i.e., it binds to a functional site on the DNA
close to the second gene and thereby enhances or suppresses its transcription. Binding sites are short, typically
segments of 10 to 15 base pairs in prokaryotes and even
shorter segments in eukaryotes. They are primarily located
in the cis-regulatory region of a gene, which lies just

E(a) =

∑ εi (ai ).

i =1

(b) At each position i, there is typically one preferred

sequence involve energy costs εi(a) - εi( ai ) ≈ 1 - 3 kBT per

nucleotide.
(d) There is an energy difference Eu - E* ~15 kBT between
unspecific and strongest specific binding. Experimental
data for the binding energies εi(a) are known only for a
few transcription factors.
Approximate values for these energies can also be inferred
from nucleotide frequencies in functional binding sites
[10]. A promising recent approach is to infer binding
energies from large-throughput expression data [13]. For
order-of-magnitude estimates, one often uses the socalled two-state approximation [7], which is homogeneous in the nucleotide positions and distinguishes only
between match and mismatch:

⎧ ε if ai ≠ ai
⎪
∗
ε i (a) − ε i (ai ) = ⎨
∗
⎪
⎩ 0 if ai = ai

(2)

with ε ≈ 2kBT . In this approximation, the binding energy
of a sequence a is simply related to the Hamming distance
d(a, a*), i.e., the number of nucleotide mismatches
between a and a*,

E(a) = E* + ε·d(a, a*).

(3)

Energy distribution in the genome
Fig. 3(a) shows the sequence of energy values E(r) found
in a segment of the E. coli genome for a specific transcription factor, the cAMP response protein (CRP) This "energy
landscape" looks quite random, i.e., consecutive energy
values are approximately uncorrelated. The distribution
Wdat(E) of energies over the entire noncoding part of the
E. coli genome is shown in fig. 3(b). We can compare this
with the distribution W0(E) obtained from a random
sequence with the same nucleotide frequencies (i.e., from
a scrambled genome). According to eq. (1), the binding
energy E is then a sum of independent random variables
εi, and its distribution becomes approximately Gaussian
by the law of large numbers. Fig. 3(b) shows that the
actual distribution Wdat(E) is indeed of the same form as
W0(E) for most energies. However, a closer look at the
low-energy tail of the distribution shows that there are significantly more strong binding sites than expected from a
random sequence [14-16]. So at least some of them are
there not by chance but for a reason.
Search kinetics
All three thermodynamic modes of a factor molecule –
free diffusion, unspecific binding, and specific binding –
are important for the search kinetics towards a functional
site [4-6]. The unspecific attraction causes the transcription factor to be bound to DNA with a finite probability,
i.e., a given molecule spends about equal amounts of time
on and off the DNA backbone. Hence, the search process
is a mixture of effectively one-dimensional diffusion

along the DNA backbone and three-dimensional diffusion in the surrounding medium. This proves more efficient than purely one- or three-dimensional diffusion. In
the 1D mode, the factor diffuses in a flat energy landscape
if it is in the conformation of unspecific binding, or in the
landscape E(r) if it is in the conformation of specific binding. In this way, it can sample the low-energy part of the
landscape E(r) while avoiding its barriers. The main obstacles on its way to a functional site are spurious binding
sites, which have a low energy E(r) by chance and act as
traps. We lack a completely satisfactory picture of the
search kinetics, which is an area of current research
[14,17]. However, this process proves to be remarkably
fast. Typical search times are less than a minute, i.e., substantially shorter than typical functional intervals in a cell
cycle of at least minutes. Therefore, the regulatory effect of
a site is related to its probability of binding a factor molecule at equilibrium, which can be evaluated by standard
thermodynamics.
Thermodynamics of factor binding
We start with the idealized but instructive problem of a
single factor protein interacting with a genome of length L
Ŭ 1, which contains a single functional site, while the rest
of the sequence is random. Since the protein is bound to
the DNA with a probability of about 1/2, we neglect the
unbound state for the subsequent probability estimates
and study only the bound protein, which is at equilibrium

between specific and unspecific binding. At each position
r, the likelihood of these two states is given by the Boltzmann factors exp [-E(r)/kBT] and exp [-Eu/kBT], respectively. Hence, the partition function for a single protein
has the form

Z=

L

∑ e− E(r )/ k T + Le− E

.

r =1

The functional site, which is assumed to be positioned at
r = rf, must have a low specific binding energy E = E(rf). We
now single out this position and write

Z = e − E / k BT +

≈ e − E / kBT + Z0 ,
where Z0 is the partition function of a completely random

where F0 = -kBT log Z0 is the free energy for a random

binding energy in a sigmoid way, with a threshold energy
E = F0 between strong and weak binding.
This strongly nonlinear dependence is known to physicists as a Fermi function.
It is easy to generalize the thermodynamic formalism to
more than one factor molecule. Ignoring the overlap
between close sites, each position r can be empty or be
occupied either by an unspecifically or by a specifically
bound factor. Using a chemical potential σ, the many-factor partition function can hence be written as
L

Z(σ ) = ∏ Z(σ , r ),

(7)

r =1

a single functional site of maximum binding strength E*
and is otherwise random. If a single factor molecule is to
affect regulation, its binding to the functional site must
not be overwhelmed by the remainder of the genome.
This leads to a criterion on the signal-to-noise ratio of regulatory interactions,
F0 t E*,

(11)

which in turn imposes a number of constraints on the
design of regulatory DNA:
(a) In a random genome, there must be at most a number
of order one minimum-energy binding sites. Estimating
the probability to find such a site at a given position as (1/
4)ᐍ, we obtain the condition

(8)

is a sum over the three thermodynamic states at position
r: no factor bound, one factor bound specifically or unspecifically. The chemical potential σ is determined by the
number of factor molecules, n, via the relation n = (d/dσ)
log Z(σ). For actual transcription factor numbers, which
are of order 1 - 104, this relation is well approximated by
[14]

(9)

The functional site is now occupied by a specifically
bound factor with probability

p(E) =

This gives a lower bound on the site length, ᐍ t log L/log
4. For a bacterial genome (L ~106), we obtain ᐍ t 10,
which gives the right length of functional binding sites.
However, this bound is not fulfilled in eukaryotes.
Indeed, eukaryotic genomes use a different design with
groups of adjacent binding sites.
(b) For each minimum-energy site, there are ᐍ suboptimal
sites of Hamming distance 1 from the minimum-energy
sequence. These must not suppress the binding to the
minimum-energy site, i.e.,
exp(-E*/kBT) t ᐍ exp [-(E* + ε)/kBT]

(13)

in the two-state approximation. This gives a lower bound
on the binding energy per nucleotide, ε/kBT t log ᐍ ≈ 2 - 3.

(10)

The binding probability – and hence the effects of the
functional site on the regulated gene – are thus determined by the binding energy, the number of factor molecules, and on the genomic background (via the free energy
F0). The dependence p(E) is a Fermi function with threshold energy E = F0 + kBT log n, which is shifted with respect
to the single-molecule case. Clearly, p is also a Fermi function of log n at fixed binding energy, with a threshold at
log n = (E - F0)/kBT . If there is more than one functional
site in the genome, the calculation remains unaffected as
long as their number is much smaller than n.
Sensitivity and genomic design of regulation
The regulatory machinery can be very efficient: in bacteria,
it has been shown that single factor molecules can have
regulatory effects. We can use eq. (6) to enquire how the
cell can reach this high level of sensitivity, following
mostly ref. [14]. We assume a minimal genome which has

(c) Finally, the unspecific binding in the entire genome
must not suppress the specific binding to a minimumenergy site, i.e.,
exp(-E*/kBT) t L exp(-Eu/kBT).

(14)

This produces a lower bound on the energy gap between
unspecific and optimal specific binding, (Eu - E*)/kBT t
log L ≈ 15.
Quite remarkably, these bounds are fulfilled as approximate equalities in bacteria. Hence, the machinery of transcriptional regulation operates just at the treshold of
single-molecule sensitivity, i.e, F0 ≈ E*.
Programmability and evolvability of regulatory networks
Of course, not every regulatory interaction is equally sensitive. To switch genes on or off, the cell uses the dependencies of the binding probability both on factor numbers

and on binding energies. During the cell cycle, the level of
n can vary over several orders of magnitude, say, between
a few and tens of thousands of molecules. At a given value
of n, the effects on the regulated genes differ since their
functional sites have different values of E. The binding
energies can change on evolutionary time scales by mutations of the site sequence, which leads to regulatory differences between individuals and, ultimately, between
species. Both parameters are thus necessary to encode
pathways in regulatory networks. This is most flexible if
minimum-energy sites are indeed sensitive to a single factor molecule as discussed above. Differential programmability as a network design principle [14] thus favors
complicated molecular structures with longer binding
sites and larger binding energies. However, this competes
with the evolvability of the system by a stochastic evolution
process [18]. We have seen that the single-molecule sensitivity is just marginally reached in bacteria. This indicates
that the actual machinery may result from a compromise
between programmability and evolvability: binding sites
are just complicated enough to work. It also indicates that
genomic structures can only be understood from their
evolution. This aspect will be developed further below,
after we have introduced sequence analysis aspects in the
next section.

Bioinformatics of regulatory DNA
Predicting regulatory interactions between genes is clearly
a key problem in bioinformatics, which is as important as
the analysis of individual genes and proteins. It is not surprising that this problem is very difficult since, as we have
discussed in the previous section, targeting regulatory
input in a large genome is a tremendous signal-to-noise
problem even for the cell itself. Its solution via the analysis of regulatory DNA requires finding statistical criteria to
distinguish between functional binding sites and background sequence. A general introduction to the relevant
sequence statistics can be found in ref. [19].
Markov model for background sequence
We begin by specifying a stochastic model for the nonfunctional segments of intergenic DNA. These are
assumed to be Markov sequences with uniform singlenucleotide frequencies p0(a) (a = A, C, G, T). Hence, the
probability of finding a given sequence has the factorized
form
k

P0 (a1 ,..., ak ) = ∏ p0 (ai ).

(15)

i =1

This assumption should not be taken too literally. The
term "nonfunctional" refers to binding of a particular
transcription factor. Intergenic DNA contains plenty of
non-random elements with other functions (e.g., binding
sites for other factors) or without known function (such as

repeat elements). The salient point is, however, that most
of intergenic DNA is well approximated by a Markov
sequence with respect to binding of a given transcription
factor. To make this more precise, we project the distribution P0(a) for segments of length ᐍ onto the binding
energy E as independent variable. Denoting the projected
distribution for simplicity with the same letter P0, we have

P0 (E) ≡ ∑ P0 (a)δ (E − E(a)).

(16)

a

This distribution is close to the actual genomic distribution Wdat(E) for most values of E, as we have seen in fig.
3. It is possible to improve the background model by
introducing small frequency couplings between neigboring letters [15,16].
Probabilistic model for functional sites
The sequences a = (a1,..., aᐍ) at functional sites of a given
transcription factor are assumed to be drawn from a different distribution Q(a). We write this distribution in the
form

Q(a) = P0(a) exp [S(a)].

(17)

The quantity S(a), which is called the relative log likelihood
score of the distributions P0 and Q, will turn out to have an
important evolutionary meaning as well.
The single-nucleotide distribution qi(a) at a given position
i within functional loci is obtained by summing the full
distribution Q over all other positions

qi (a) =

∑

Q(a).

a1 ,...,ai −1 ,ai +1 ,...,a

(18)

The set of these marginal distributions, qi(a) (i = 1,..., ᐍ; a
= A, C, G, T) is called the position weight matrix for binding
sites of a given factor [20]. If the score function is additive
in the nucleotide positions, S(a) = ∑ i =1 si (ai ) , the Q distribution has a factorized form, Q(a) = ∏ i =1 qi (ai ) with
qi(a) = p0(a) exp [si(a)].

(19)

This additivity assumption is made in most of the existing
literature since the position weight matrix (18) can be
inferred from a sample of known functional site
sequences, which in turn determines directly the single
nucleotide scores (19). This scoring is the basis for a
number of site prediction methods in single species and
by cross-species analysis; see, e.g., refs. [20-24].

Page 7 of 21

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8(Suppl 6):S7

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S6/S7

Here we treat functional sites as coherent statistical units
and do not make the assumption of additivity of the score
function [16]. As will be discussed in the next section,
functionality imposes correlations between the nucleotide frequencies within a functional site, preventing factorization of the Q distribution. Of course, it is not
possible to reconstruct the full distribution Q(a), which
lives on a 4ᐍ-dimensional sequence space, from a limited
sample of experimentally known functional sites. However, we can again project this distribution onto the binding energy as independent variable, Q(E) = ∑a Q(a)δ(E E(a)). Since all regulatory effects of a functional site
depend on its sequence a only via the binding energy, we
can also write the score as a function of the energy, S(a) =
S(E(a)) (this will become obvious in the next section).
Hence, the relationship (17) has the same form for the
projected distributions,
Q(E) = P0(E) exp [S(E)].

(20)

Bayesian model for genomic loci
Assuming that functional loci are distributed randomly
with a small probability λ, we now combine the models
for background sequence and for functional sites into a
model for the full distribution of sequences a in intergenic
DNA,

W(a) = (1 - λ) P0(a) + λ Q(a).

(21)

(At the moment, we are ignoring the possible overlap
between functional sites). In the language of statistics, this
is a probabilistic model with hidden variables. The output
of this model consists of pairs (m, a): First, the model variable m is randomly drawn, labelling a locus as nonfunctional (m = 0) with probability 1 - λ or as functional (m =
1) with probability λ. Then the sequence is drawn from
the corresponding distribution P0(a) or Q(a). However,
only the sequence counts a are available data. The "hidden" variable m can be inferred from the data in a probabilistic way using Bayes' formula, which expresses the
joint probability distribution of data and model in terms
of its conditional and its marginal distributions
prob(a, m) = prob(a|m) prob(m) = prob(m|a) prob(a)
(22)
with prob(a) = ∑mprob(a|m)prob(m). We can solve for
the conditional probability of the model for given data a,

prob(m | a) =

prob(a | m)prob(m)
.
∑ m prob(a | m)prob(m)

(23)

For the probability of functionality, ρf(a) = prob(m = 1|a),
this formula reads

ρf (a) =

λ Q(a)
=
W(a)

1
1− λ ⎤
⎡
1 + exp ⎢ −S(a) + log
λ ⎥
⎣
⎦

.

(24)
The dependence on S has again the form of a Fermi function. Its threshold value S = log [(1 - λ)/λ] separates
sequences that are more likely to be functional or more
likely to be background.
The full Bayesian model (21) can again be projected onto
the energy variable,
W(E) = (1 - λ)P0(E) + λ Q(E).

(25)

In this form, it can be tested against genomic data [16]. To
plot the distributions P0, Q, and W as functions of E, we
use eq. (1) with an energy matrix εi(a) = ε0 log [qi(a)/p0(a)]
estimated from the position weight matrix up to an overall constant ε0 [10]. For our example of the CRP transcription factor, the distribution Q(E) can be estimated from
the about 50 known binding sites in the E. coli genome.
Using this Q distribution and a probability of functionality λ ≈ 6 × 10-4, the full distribution W(E) produces an
excellent fit of the count histogram Wdat(E) over the entire
range of energies; see fig. 4(a). The log likelihood score
function S(E) = log [Q(E)/P0(E)] is shown in fig. 4(b),
shifted such that the curve has its zero at a point Es ≈ 13
beyond which binding becomes negligible.
The resulting probability of functionality ρf(E) as given by
eq. (24) is also shown in fig. 4(b). This indicates the
dilemma for the prediction of individual binding sites
based on sequence data from a single species. Many functional sites have energies in the "twilight" region between
the ensembles λQ and (1 - λ)P0, where ρf takes values
around 1/2. Hence, depending on the energy cutoff chosen, any prediction is torn between many false negatives
or many false positives.
Dynamic programming and sequence analysis
It is straightforward to generalize the Bayesian approach
to longer segments of intergenic DNA, which are covered
by an unknown number s of non-overlapping functional
sites as shown in fig. 5[22]. The hidden variables are now
the sequence of left initial positions rf ≡ (r1,..., rs) of the
functional sites (with the no-overlap constraint rν+1 ≥ rν +
ᐍ for ν = 1,..., s - 1). The full sequence distribution in a segment of length L has the form

WL (a1 ,..., aL ) = Z −1 ∑ λWL (a1 ,..., aL | rf ),

Analysis 5 regulatory sequences
Analysis of regulatory sequences. A configuration of s nonoverlapping binding sites is given by the sequence of left initial
positions rf = (r1,..., rs) (with rν+1 - rν ≥ ᐍ for ν = 1, 2,..., s - 1). It can be associated with a path m(r) which takes the values m = 1
at the nucleotide positions of binding sites and m = 0 elsewhere. Dynamic programming algorithms based on a Bayesian model
(27) of genomic sequences assign to each site configuration a probability of occurence ρ (r|a1,..., aL) for given sequence data
a1,..., aL; see eq. (29).

nized as the corresponding discrete path integral in imaginary time r, if we interpret rf as encoding a path m(r) that
takes the value m = 1 at the nucleotide positions rν,..., rν +
ᐍ - 1 (ν = 1,..., s) within functional loci and m = 0 otherwise (see fig. 5). Both concepts prove very useful also in
more general problems of sequence alignment.
In analogy to (24), the probability of a set rf of functional
loci for given sequence data is

ρ(rf | a1 ,..., aL ) =

WL (a1 ,..., aL | rf )
WL (a1 ,..., aL )

.

(29)

The most likely set r ∗ can be obtained by the following
f
"backward" algorithm: Given the sequence (W1,..., WL)
obtained from the "forward" recursion (28), we can
decide for every point r whether it is more likely to be a
background position or the endpoint of a functional
locus, ignoring all sequence information from positions >
r. This depends on whether the leading contribution to Wr
comes from the first or second term on the r.h.s. of (28)
and defines the local optimum model m*(r). The global
optimum set of functional loci respecting the no-overlap
constraint is then r ∗ = {r|b(r) = 1}, where b(r) is given by
f
the recursion b(r) = ᐍ if b(r + 1) ≤ 1 &m*(r) = 1 and b(r) =
max(b(r + 1) - 1, 0) otherwise, with the initial condition
b(L + 1) = 0.
The Bayesian model can easily be extended to sequences
containing several types of binding sites, which bind different transcription factors and are distinguished by their
Q distributions. Dynamic programming algorithms can
thus predict the likely coverage of a sequence with binding
sites of known type [22]. This is the first step in extending
the statistical analysis from single binding sites to entire
regions of regulatory DNA. Indeed, models of this kind
have been applied successfully to predict regulatory elements in eukaryotes, which typically consist of functional
groups of adjacent binding sites. In the algorithms currently used, however, the scoring in (27) is strictly additive for groups of non-overlapping binding sites: it does
not take into account dependencies between the sites
within one functional group or overlapping sites within
one sequence.

Evolution of regulatory DNA
In the statistical picture developed so far, background
sequences and functional sites are reduced to ensembles
P0 and Q. This picture is incomplete in two ways. On one
hand, it is quite disconnected from the biophysical

aspects discussed before: the specific function of binding
sites hardly enters the standard formalism of position
weight matrices. On the other hand, there is not yet any
notion of time and dynamics. Sequences change by various mutation processes, and the observed sequence
ensembles derive from this evolutionary dynamics. The
evolution of functional loci is fundamentally different
from that of background sequence: it is subject to natural
selection, that is, the fitness of an organism depends on its
genotype a at a functional locus via the effects on the regulated gene. At this point, the biophysics of binding enters
the evolution of functional sequences [25-27]. Moreover,
it becomes clear that the statistical framework has to be
extended from individual sequences to distributions of
genotypes in a population. In this section, we develop an
evolutionary picture of regulatory DNA, from which we
obtain expressions for the sequence ensembles P0, Q, and
the score function S. The next four paragraphs are a selfcontained introduction to the underlying concepts of
population genetics.
Deterministic population dynamics and fitness
We start by describing the evolution of a large population,
which contains individuals of different genotypes a. Each
genotype is assumed to produce a specific phenotype,
which may influence the reproductive success of the individuals carrying it. With respect to factor binding, the phenotype can be associated with the binding energy E(a),
since presumably all organismic effects of a locus depend
on its genotype only via the binding energy. However, the
discussion in the following paragraphs is more general.

We first assume that the subpopulations of a given genotype reproduce separately, i.e., there neither transitions
between genotypes through mutations nor (in a sexually
reproducing population) mixing through genomic recombination. Writing the dynamics of the subpopulations in
the form of simple growth laws,

d
Na (t ) = Fa (t )Na (t ),
dt

(30)

defines the (Malthusian) fitness Fa(t) of each genotype. For
notational simplicity, we now limit ourselves to the case
of just two genotypes a and b, where (30) can be written
as growth laws for the total population size N(t) = Na(t) +
Nb(t) and for the population fraction x(t) = Nb(t)/N (t) of
genotype b,

d
N(t ) = F (t )N(t ),
dt

x(t ) = ΔFab (t )x(t )[1 − x(t )],

with F (t) ≡ [1 - x(t)]Fa(t) + x(t)Fb(t) and ΔFab(t) ≡ Fb(t) -

where χa(t) are Gaussian random variables with

Fa(t). This decomposition is useful since the overall

χ a (t ) = 0 and

growth rate F (t) is often strongly time-dependent due to
external conditions (e.g., seasonality), while fitness differences, which reflect intrinsic properties of the phenotypes,
are more stable. Different genotypes coexisting in a population frequently produce the same or very similar phenotypes and thus have equal fitness (ΔFab = 0).
Assuming ΔFab to be constant over the time of observation, the solution of eq. (32) is the evolutionary trajectory

x(t ) =

x0 exp[ΔFab (t − t0 )]
1 − x0 (exp[ΔFab (t − t0 )] − 1)

(33)

with the initial condition x(t0) = x0, shown in fig. 6(a). For
ΔFab ≠ 0, the fixed points of this dynamics are the monomorphic population states x = 0, and x = 1, of which x = 1
is stable for ΔFab > 1 and x = 0 for ΔFab < 1. The approach
to the stationary state takes place on a characteristic time
scale τd = 1/ΔFab.
In the important case of neutral evolution (ΔFab = 0), the
evolutionary outcome remains indefinite. These results,
which can readily be generalized to more than two phenotypes, are a simple version of Fisher's fundamental theorem
of natural selection: any population with initially coexisting
phenotypes of different fitness will evolve towards a state
where only the fittest phenotype is present.
Fisher's theorem seems to prove the popularized Darwinian notion of the "survival of the fittest". However, it rests
on very restrictive assumptions that are never fulfilled in a
natural population. The deterministic growth law (32)
neglects mutations and recombinations, as well as the
reproductive fluctuations present in any population due
to its finite number of individuals. These other evolutionary forces have to be incorporated in our theoretical picture before we can even define fitness as a measurable
quantity and before the theory can address the important
case of neutral evolution.
Stochastic dynamics and genetic drift
Stochastic fluctuations of the reproduction process in a
large but finite population have been studied extensively
in population genetics, see [28,29]. They are called genetic
drift, an unfortunate name which may falsely suggest a
deterministic effect. To take these fluctuations into
account, we replace eq. (30) by a stochastic growth law,

d
Na (t ) = Fa (t )Na (t ) + χ a (t ),
dt

χ a (t )χ b (t ′) = Na (t )δ (t − t ′)δ a ,b .

(35)

This form of noise is simply due to the law of large numbers, and the continuum dynamics (34) emerges as an
effective large-N description for a plethora of discrete evolution models, which are defined at the level of individuals and have finite generation times. In the application to
real populations, N has to be interpreted as the so-called
effective population size, which can be inferred from
genome data and is in general smaller than the actual population size.
In the case of two genotypes, eq. (34) can again be projected onto the population fraction x,

d
x(t ) = ΔFab (t )x(t )[1 − x(t )] + χ x (t ),
dt

(36)

where χx(t) = (∂x/∂Na)χa(t) + (∂x/∂Nb)χb(t) are Gaussian
random variables with zero mean and

χ x (t )χ x (t ′) =

x(1 − x)
δ (t − t ′).
N

(37)

This dynamics produces stochastic evolutionary trajectories x(t) as shown in fig. 6(b). To capture their statistics,
we convert the Langevin equation (36) into a FokkerPlanck equation for the probability distribution of the
genotype composition [28,30],
∂

( x , t ) =
x(1 − x)( x , t ) − ΔFab (t ) x(1 − x)( x , t ).
∂t
2N ∂x 2

(38)
The mathematical subtlety of this equation lies in the xdependent diffusion "constant" x(1 - x)/2N, which reflects
the multiplicative nature of the reproduction process. As a
consequence, the two monomorphic population states x =
0 and x = 1 are also fixed points also of the stochastic
dynamics. Any evolutionary trajectory x(t) will eventually
lead to one of these states with probability 1; this is called
the fixation of the corresponding genotype in the population. In other words, the Fokker-Planck equation (38)
describes diffusion in the interval (0, 1) with absorbing
boundaries. There is a family of stationary states

 (x) = (1 - φ)δ(x) + φδ (1 - x),

The value of φ depends on the initial condition x0 and can
be computed by solving the backward diffusion equation

which for near-neutral evolution (NΔFab <<> 1) reduces to

(42)

The characteristic time τs of the stochastic dynamics interpolates between the diffusive scale N and the deterministic scale: τs ≈ min(N, τd). It determines the typical time of
the evolution process up to fixation, shown shaded in fig.
6(b).
Hence, the stochastic population dynamics depends no
longer only on the fitness difference of the genotypes as in
the deterministic case, but also on the initial state of the
population and the the population size. Yet, our evolutionary picture is still incomplete. Population states with
coexisting genotypes enter the dynamics as initial conditions, but since mutations are neglected, the model does
not explain how this coexistence is generated and maintained.
Mutation processes and evolutionary equilibria
At the level of an individual, mutations are rare stochastic
genotype changes a → b, which take place with rates μa→b,
often coupled to the reproduction process. (These rates
are all of the same order of magnitude, in estimates we
therefore omit the indices.) We include mutations into
the population dynamics (34) by their systematic effect
on the genotype subpopulations,

with a normalization constant Z that can be expressed in

Substitution dynamics
Here we are interested in the stochastic evolution (45) and

its equilibrium state (46) for Nμ <<> 1, which is the relevant dynamical regime for nuclear DNA in eukaryotes and
in most prokaryotes (but not in viral systems). In this
regime, the mutation term in (45) is small against the diffusion term except for values of x close to the boundaries
0 or 1. In this region, the continuum approximation of eq.
(45) is no longer valid, and (46) has to be replaced by a
stationary solution  d(Na) of the underlying discrete
evolution model, which gives the probability that the
population contains Na individuals of genotype a (with
Na = N - Nb = 0, 1,..., N). The discrete solution is easily
shown to have the singularity d (0)

( N μa → b )−1 Pd (1) .

This singularity is correctly captured if we use the approximation Pd ( Na )

(43)
while their stochastic effect (whose variance is of order
Nμ) is neglected since it is small against the reproductive
sampling noise χa(t). In the case of two different genotypes, this dynamics can again be projected onto the variable x,

From this solution, we read off the following characteristics of the evolutionary dynamics at equilibrium, which
are illustrated by the trajectory of fig. 6(c)[32]:
(a) For sufficiently small values of μ, the population
remains monomorphic for most of the time. Using the

shorthands Q(a) =  d(Na = 0) and Q(b) =  d(Na = N),
we have
Q(a) + Q(b) = 1 - O(μN log N).

(47)

The backward substitution rate ub→a is given by a formula
similar to (49) with ΔFba = -ΔFab. Forward and backward
substitution rate have the simple ratio

ua →b μa →b
=
exp(2N ΔFab )
ub→a μ b→a

(52)

(b) The ratio of probabilities for the two monomorphic
population states is given by the ratio of "forward" and
"backward" mutation rate, the fitness difference, and the
effective population size:

for N Ŭ 1. Comparing with (48), we obtain the consistency condition

Q(b) μa →b
=
exp(2N ΔFab ) + O(N μ ).
Q(a) μ b→a

ua →b Q(b)
=
.
ub→a Q(a)

(48)

(c) The monomorphic population states x = 0 and x = 1
are unstable due to mutations even at arbitrarily small values of μ, which cause occasional transitions of the entire
population from genotype a to b, and vice versa. These socalled substitutions are marked by dashed lines in fig. 6(c).
The substitution rate ua→b can be evaluated as the product
of creating a single mutant of genotype b in an initially
monomorphic a population, N μa →b , and its probability
of fixation, φ (x0 = 1/N, ΔFab, N). The time between initial
mutation and fixation (shown by grey shading in fig. 6(c))
is still of order τs and thus much shorter than the time
scale 1/μ, on which mutation effects become important.
Hence, the fixation probability φ is given to leading order
by (41), which has been derived for μ = 0. Together we
have [28,30]

ua →b = N μa →b

1 − exp(−2ΔFab )
.
1 − exp(−2N ΔFab )

(49)

Hence, the substitution rate ua→b is enhanced over μa→b
for ΔFab > 0 and suppressed for ΔFab < 0, as shown in Fig.
7. For weak selection (N|ΔFab| <<> 1), eq. (49) becomes
ua→b = μa→b (1 + NΔFab + ...).

(50)

This reproduces Kimura's famous original result: for neutral evolution, the substitution rate equals the mutation
rate in an individual, independently of the population
size. For this reason, the rates μa→b are referred to as neutral mutation rates. For strong selection (N|ΔFab| Ŭ 1 Ŭ
|ΔFab|), eq. (49) takes the asymptotic forms

⎧ 2N | ΔFab | exp(2N ΔFab ) (2N ΔFab
ua →b = μa →b ⎨
(2N ΔFab
⎩ 2N ΔFab

1),
1).
(51)

(53)

Hence, for sufficiently small mutation rates (μN log N <<>
1), a simple picture emerges: The evolution of a population can be described as a sequence of transitions between
monomorphic genotype states (substitutions). The substitution rate u is determined by the corresponding mutation
rate in an individual, the fitness difference between the
genotypes, and the effective population size.
Neutral dynamics in sequence space, sequence entropy
This evolutionary picture can be generalized to multiple
genotypes, for example, the 4ᐍ dimensional sequence
space of genomic loci a = (a1,..., aᐍ). Transitions between
different sequence states are point mutations a → b,
which change exactly one nucleotide. (We neglect here
insertion and deletion processes, which change the length
of the sequence). We first discuss neutral evolution, where
the substitution rate ua→b equals the mutation rate in an
individual, μa→b, for all elementary transitions a → b.
Bona fide neutral mutation rates can be inferred from
DNA sequence alignments of sufficiently close species,
recent insights have also come from studying repeat elements.

We assume the neutral dynamics has an equilibrium distribution P0(a) which obeys detailed balance, i.e., the relation

μa →b P0 (b)
=
μb→a P0 (a)

(54)

holds for each pair of sequence states linked by an elementary transition process a → b. This says that the probability current at equilibrium, μa→bP0(a) - μb→aP0(b),
vanishes for each elementary transition. Clearly, any distribution P0(a) satisfying the conditions (54) is stationary
under the dynamics with rates μa→b, but not every such
dynamics has a stationary distribution which satisfies
(54) (the simplest counterexample involving three states
and a circular probability current a → b → c at stationarity).

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8(Suppl 6):S7

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S6/S7

However, as will be verified below, detailed balance is a
good approximation for the genomic substitution dynamics at least in prokaryotes. (There are known violations at
CpG islands in eukaryotes [34]). In the simplest type of
models, every nucleotide a mutates independently of all
other positions with uniform rates μa→b (i.e., μa→b = μa→b
for any two sequences a = (..., a ,...) and b = (..., b, ...) differing by exactly one nucleotide). This produces a factorized equilibrium distribution P0(a) of the form (15).
We can project the equilibrium distribution onto a measurable quantity as independent variable. For binding site
sequences, a convenient choice is the binding energy E,
and the projected distribution P0(E) has the form (16).
Hence we can define the sequence entropy [35]
S0(E) = log P0(E),

(55)

which counts the log density of sequence states a at energy
E, weighed by the distribution P0(a).
Dynamics under selection, the score-fitness relation
The dynamics of substitutions can be studied in the same
way for evolution under selection, which is specified at
the level of genotypes by an arbitrary fitness function F(a)
[18,36]. This generalizes the results of [37] for a model
with selection acting independently at different nucle-

otide positions, i.e., F(a) = ∑ i =1 fi (ai ) . For each elementary transition a → b, the substitution rate ua→b is
determined by the neutral rate μa→b, the fitness difference
ΔFab, and the effective population size N according to
(49). Given the detailed balance (54) of neutral evolution
and the relation (52) between forward and backward
rates, it then follows immediately that the evolutionary
dynamics under selection also obeys detailed balance, as
given by (53) with an equilibrium distribution Q(a) of the
form (48). Thus we have [18,36]:
The equilibrium distribution Q(a) of fixed genotypes generated
by a substitution dynamics (49) with fitness function F(a) is
related to its neutral counterpart P0(a) by
Q(a) = P0(a) exp [2NF (a) + const.],

(56)

with the constant given by normalization.
We can project eq. (56) onto the fitness as independent
variable. Defining the distribution Q(F) ≡ ∑a Q(a)δ (F (a)
- F), similarly P0(F), and the sequence entropy S0(F) = log
P0(F), the projected identity takes the form
Q(F) = exp [2NF + S0(F) + const.]

(57)

For binding site sequences, we have a similar projection
on the binding energy, Q(E) = exp [2NF(E) + S0(E) +
const.], since all genotypes with the same "phenotype" E
have the same fitness, i.e., the same score S. The projected
identities express the equilibrium distribution under
selection in terms of fitness and sequence entropy, reflecting the balance between stochasticity (genetic drift) and
selection [18]. For strong selection, the exponent 2NF - S0
is dominated by the fitness term, and Q(F) takes appreciable values only at points of near-maximal fitness, i.e.,
where Fmax - F d 1/2N. For moderate selection, there is a
nontrivial balance between both terms, and for weak
selection, the Q distribution can be approximated by its
neutral counterpart P0 = exp(S0). Clearly, the roles of fitness and sequence entropy are formally analogous to
those of energy and entropy in statistical physics of thermodynamic systems, if 2N is identified with the inverse
temperature 1/kBT . Some consequences of this analogy
are discussed in ref. [38].
The dynamics of substitutions establishes a rather general
evolutionary grounding of genome statistics, if we identify
the equilibrium distributions P0(a) and Q(a) with the
genomic distributions discussed in the previous section,
as already anticipated by our notation. Comparing eqs.
(56) and (17) gives a relation between fitness and score
[16,18]:
The log-likelihood score S(a) = log [Q(a)/P0(a)] equals the fitness function multiplied by twice the effective population size up
to a constant,
S(a) = 2NF(a) + const..

(58)

This relation allows us to use sequence data of a given
genome to infer quantitative patterns of its evolution. We
now discuss specific consequences for the evolution of
regulatory DNA; an application to protein evolution can
be found in ref. [37].
Measuring selection for binding sites
We first give a precise definition of functionality for regulatory (and other) elements: A binding locus is functional
if the genotype at that locus is under selection (for binding
of the corresponding factor). Nonfunctional loci have
evolutionarily neutral genotypes. This definition asks
whether binding at a given locus makes a difference to the
organism or not. It is weaker than that of a functional
binding site, which is a functional locus with a sequence a
that is likely to actually bind the factor. A functional locus
can lose its binding sequence due to deleterious mutations, leading to suboptimal fitness of the organism. Conversely, a nonfunctional locus can have by chance a
sequence which does bind the factor: this is a spurious
binding site without consequences for the organism. To

since selection acts on the entire genotype a as a functional unit and not on its single nucleotides. For binding
sites, fitness effects follow from the expression level of the
regulated gene, which depends on the sequence a via the
binding probability of the corresponding transcription
factor. While the binding energy is often approximately
additive in the nucleotide positions as given by (1), the
binding probability (10) is a strongly nonlinear function
of the energy. This introduces correlations between nucleotide frequencies at any two positions within functional
loci, preventing factorization of the distribution Q(a).

Substitution rate in a population versus mutation rate in an
Substitution rate in a population versus mutation
rate in an individual. The ratio of these rates, ua→b/μa→b,
depends on the product NΔFab of effective population size
and fitness difference between the genotypes (in the relevant
regime N Ŭ 1, ΔFab <<> 1, NΔFab finite). The substitution
rate ua→b is equal to μab for neutral mutations (ΔFab = 0),
reduced for deleterious mutations (ΔFab < 0), and enhanced
for advantageous mutations (ΔFab > 0).

measure the selection on functional sites in silico, we apply
the identity (58) to the genomic distributions P0(a) and
Q(a). (Assuming equilibrium for most loci seems to be
justified for our example of CRP binding sites in E. coli
since we find very similar distributions in the distant bacterial species Salmonella typhimurium, and the factor protein itself is highly conserved between these species.) After
projection onto the energy, the fitness landscape 2NF(E)
for CRP binding sites is thus given by fig. 4(b)[16]. The fitness is constant in the no-binding region (E t Es ≈ 13)
since the evolution is always neutral in that region. This
constant is set to 0 in our normalization, i.e., F(E) measures the fitness gain of functional sites due to factor binding. Loci with strong binding are also under strong
selection, with effective fitness values 2NF of order 10.
Genetic drift counteracts selection, producing also loci
with weaker binding and reduced effective fitness. This fitness "landscape" is thus qualitatively of the form predicted from the underlying biophysics [18,25]. Of course,
it should be kept in mind that this landscape results from
averaging over a family of binding sites, which may have
a spectrum of individual selection coefficients and
selected binding strengths.
Nucleotide frequency correlations
A further consequence of (57) is the generic occurence of
nucleotide frequency correlations within functional loci
[18]. If the fitness function F(a) is not additive in the
nucleotide positions, nucleotide frequencies are correlated in selected genotypes even if they are independent
under neutral evolution. This happens quite generically

Stationary evolution of binding sites
Functional loci with a substantial level of selection (as
found for the CRP binding sites in E. coli) evolve in a way
quite different from background sequence. This is quantified in fig. 8(a), which shows pairs of binding energies
(E1, E2) for experimentally verified CRP binding sites in E.
coli and the corresponding sites regulating orthologous
genes in S. typhimurium [16,27]. The evolutionary distance
t between the two species and characteristics of the neutral
mutation process can be inferred from alignments of
background sequence. The "phenotypic" evolution of
CRP binding is quantified by the energy transition probabilities G0(E2|E1) under neutral evolution and Gf (E2|E1)
under stationary selection [16]. These are readily obtained
by simulating the substitution dynamics over a time interval t for given initial value E1, both with neutral rates μa→b
and with rates ua→b given by (49) and the fitness function
2NF(E) measured in E. coli. The resulting conditional
expectation values ΌG0(E2|E1)΍ and ΌGf (E2|E1)΍ for the binding energy in S. typhimurium are also shown in fig. 8(a).
The data conform to the selection model, showing a substantially stronger conservation of binding energy than
expected for neutral evolution [16,27,39].

We can now build a probabilistic model for cross-species
comparisons [16]. It is based on the joint distributions of
energy pairs
P0(E1, E2) = G0(E2|E1) P0(E1)

(59)

under neutral evolution and
Q(E1, E2) = Gf(E2|E1) Q(E1)

(60)

under stationary selection, which are determined by the
corresponding distributions in one species and the energy
transition probabilities. Detailed balance of the substitution dynamics implies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S6/S7

i.e., the joint distributions P0(E1, E2) and Q(E1, E2) must
be symmetric functions of their arguments. These distributions combine into a model for pairs of aligned loci,
which generalizes the single-species model (25) and takes
the form
W(E1, E2) = (1 - λ)P0(E1, E2) + λQ(E1, E2).

(62)

(This model can be extended further to include non-stationary selection.) The distribution W(E1, E2) with a fraction of functionality λ = 0.0018 is in excellent agreement
with the count distribution Wdat(E1, E2) obtained from E.
coli and S. typhimurium, as shown in fig. 8(b). The symmetry of Wdat is thus consistent with the underlying assumption of detailed balance. Analogous Bayesian models can
be defined for more than two species related by a phylogeny. This approach has been applied to binding site prediction in bacteria [16]; a related study of several species
of funghi has been reported in ref. [40].
Adaptive evolution of binding sites
What does this picture say about the adaptive evolution of
transcriptional regulation in response to a newly arising
selection pressure? The evolution from a genotype with
marginal binding (E(a) ≈ Es) to strong binding requires
only about three uphill point mutations in the fitness
landscape of fig. 4(b), i.e., there is an effective fitness gain
2NΔF ≈ 3 per mutation. Hence, according to (51), the rate
of uphill substitutions per locus is enhanced by a factor
2NΔF·d(a, a*) at least of order 10 over the neutral point
mutation rate per nucleotide. At the same time, the downhill rate is strongly suppressed. This shows that the adaptive formation of a binding site from background
sequence can indeed be a rapid mode of regulatory evolution, due to the substantial level of selection [18].

However, this mode is only efficient if adaptation can set
in immediately after the selection pressure is established.
In larger regulatory regions, the exact position of a binding site is often not important. We assume the initial
genome contains a set of L shadow sites, i.e., positions
r1,..., rL where a given sequence a would have the same
regulatory effect. If one of these shadow sites has already
a genotype with marginal binding, it acts as a "seed" for
the onset of adaptation [41]. On the other hand, if all
shadow sites of the initial genome have energy E > Es,
there is typically a substantial waiting time of neutral evolution before one of them reaches the threshold energy Es.
Assuming the initial genome to be entirely background
sequence, it will contain at least one such seed if

∫E < E

s

P0 ( E)dE t1 / L , which is a joint condition on L and

the site length ᐍ: the shadow regulatory region must be
long enough and binding sites must be short enough. The
example shows that the evolvability of regulation imposes
constraints on genome architecture [18]. Adaptive point
substitution may thus be a feasible mode for the formation of a single binding site, but will hardly explain the
groups of adjacent sites characteristic of eukaryotic promoters. These may originate from repeat duplication by
slippage, which has recently been shown to be an efficient
source of sequence innovation in intergenic regions of
Drosophila.

Towards a dynamical picture of the genome
The relationship S = 2NF + const. between score and fitness is a cornerstone of the theoretical picture developed
so far, which links its population genetic, bioinformatic
and biophysical arches. It relates a key evolutionary variable with the statistics of genomic frequency counts. The
physical binding energy is an appropriate phenotypic variable on which fitness and score depend, because molecular function is determined by binding interactions.
We have discussed this picture for transcription factor
binding sites, but it can be applied more generally to functional elements in genomes. It relates the statistics of these
elements in one genome with their evolutionary dynamics, which is observed in cross-species comparisons. This
dynamics is shaped by selection: The components of functional elements are coupled by a common fitness function; such fitness interactions are called epistasis. Hence,
functional correlations lead to evolutionary correlations. These
can be traced in the Q distribution over fixed genomes of
a functional element. A more detailed statistical analysis
using the statistics of polymorphisms within a population
is briefly sketched below.
Thus, the picture of the genome as a system with multiple
interactions has a fundamental dynamical significance.
This is important since it allows us to trace functional
modules from evolutionary patterns. We conclude the
article with a brief outlook on functional integration of
regulatory sequences at various and its dynamical implications.
Evolutionary interactions between sites
Regulatory function is often determined not by single
binding sites, but jointly by a group of sites in the same
regulatory region [42]. An important mechanism is binding cooperativity, i.e., the formation of a protein complex
between two (or more) factors bound to their corresponding DNA sites. The binding energy of this complex has the
form E = E1 + E2 + ΔE12, where E1 and E2 are the energies of
the factors bound individually and ΔE12 < 0 is the energy
gain due to the protein-protein interaction, which is of the

order of a few kBT . Cooperative binding has a number of
functional effects [1]:
(a) It increases the signal-to-noise ratio for the targeting of
regulatory input to a specific gene, which is important in
larger eukaryotic genomes, where single spurious binding
sites are abundant in background sequence.
(b) It sharpens the response of the binding probability to
variations in the factor concentrations around their
threshold value. This follows from the thermodynamics
of two factors, which is a straightforward generalization of
the case of a single factor discussed above.
(c) It implements logical connections between regulatory
input signals to a given gene. The simplest example is an
AND connection between two factors, where the regulated
gene is affected only if both factors are simultaneously
present. This happens if the binding energies and factor
concentrations are such that individual binding is weak
but joint binding is strong. Larger groups of binding sites
can encode a whole repertoire of more complicated logical functions [43].

Regulatory modules with several jointly acting binding
sites are frequently found in eukaryotes. The functional
coupling of sites in a module translates into interactions
between these sites in their sequence evolution. The
genomic functional element, i.e., the subset of the regulatory region on which selection acts, is the module as a
whole. Its fitness F(E1, E2, ΔE12,...) is a joint function of
the binding energies as the relevant phenotypic variables
[18,25]. The evolutionary dynamics under this selection
allows for a large number of compensatory changes, i.e.,
pairs of correlated substitutions changing two binding
energies such that the fitness remains constant. These lead
to nucleotide frequency correlations between different
sites. Such compensatory changes have indeed been
observed in experiments on Drosophila promoters [44].
Site-shadow interactions
In larger regulatory regions, there is a number of shadow
sites where a binding sequence a would have a similar regulatory effect as at the functional sites present. In that case,
the genomic functional element contains not only the
functional binding sites but also the shadow sites. Once a
functional site has disappeared due to deleterious muta-

tions, a shadow site can turn functional by adaptive evolution as described in the last section. The resulting
evolutionary dynamics leads to sequence turnover with
the actual binding sites present at different but functionally equivalent positions [36]. Substantial sequence turnover has been observed in a number of case studies [4449]. Also the number of actual sites is subject to evolutionary variation since the same regulatory effect, i.e., the
same fitness, can be distributed over fewer stronger or
more weaker sites. With increasing number L of shadow
positions, one expects that the number of actual sites
grows while individual sites get weaker [36].
Gene interactions
Evolutionary interactions are not limited to regulatory elements for the same gene. An example are gene duplications and the subsequent evolution of the daughter genes.
Selection acts jointly on this pair of genes [50], which
have initially identical functions, eventually leading to
either loss of one of them or to subfunctionalization, which
has been argued to be an important mode of genome evolution in eukaryotes [51,52]. This process can take place
by regulation, i.e., via a correlated distribution of the regulatory elements on the daughter genes. More generally,
the evolution of genes in a regulatory network is correlated if their functions are coupled either in series (i.e.,
one gene acts on the other) or in parallel (i.e., they are part
of alternative pathways for the same function). Although
some regulatory networks in model organisms – e.g. the
embryonic development in the sea urchin [53] – have
been studied in detail, we lack a coherent view of their
functional evolution to date.
Interactions and time-dependent selection
The functional integration of regulation at multiple levels
and the resulting fitness interactions (epistasis) imply that
the selection at one genomic site is influenced by changes
at other sites. A recent analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and substitutions in Drosophila provides
indeed evidence on a genome-wide scale that selection is
time-dependent: at individual loci, changes in the direction of selection occur at nearly the rate of neutral evolution [54,55]. At the same time, selection is sufficiently
strong so that the adaptive response can keep up with the
rate of selection changes. This rate is faster in non-coding
DNA, which points towards the role of regulation in the
adaptive differentiation between species. Genomic evolution emerges as a complex stochastic process, shaped
jointly be the driving force of time-dependent selection,
fitness interactions between sites, and the ongoing background of near-neutral changes. Much more remains to be
learned about the interplay of these evolutionary forces:
in a large and strongly coupled system, one external signal
can trigger an avalanche of subsequent compensatory

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S6/S7

responses. This dynamics seems now within reach of
genomic sequence analysis.
Evolutionary innovations
Under stationary selection, functional elements are more
conserved than background sequence, and the score-fitness relation quantifies the amount of conservation. But
evolution is, of course, not limited to conservation. On
one hand, there is typically a multitude of different genotypes yielding the same molecular function, and the evolutionary dynamics continuously plays with these
alternatives. On the other hand, organisms face long-term
changes of their environment, which lead to new selection
pressures and a response by adaptive evolution of new
functions. If regulation is to account for a large part of the
diversification in higher eukaryotes, loss or gain of regulatory function should be an important mode of molecular
evolution. Changes in regulatory DNA leading to new
functions of gene networks have been observed [56], and
it is possible to extend the statistical models described in
the previous section to include evolutionary gain or loss
of function of individual binding sites [16]. On a broader
scale, time-dependent selection and fitness couplings
appear act as a major driving forces of genomic change,
triggering avalanches of evolutionary innovation. Understanding this molecular basis of innovations is a major
challenge for theory and experiment in the coming years.
It will profoundly change our dynamical view of the
genome.
