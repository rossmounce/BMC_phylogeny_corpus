Abstract
Background: Triatoma infestans is the most relevant vector of Chagas disease in the southern cone of South
America. Since its genome has not yet been studied, sequencing of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) is one of the
most powerful tools for efficiently identifying large numbers of expressed genes in this insect vector.
Results: In this work, we generated 826 ESTs, resulting in an increase of 47% in the number of ESTs available for
T. infestans. These ESTs were assembled in 471 unique sequences, 151 of which represent 136 new genes for the
Reduviidae family.
Conclusions: Among the putative new genes for the Reduviidae family, we identified and described an interesting
subset of genes involved in development and reproduction, which constitute potential targets for insecticide
development.

Background
Chagas disease affects 8 million people, and ~28 million,
in 21 endemic countries of Latin America, are at risk of
infection [1]. The etiologic agent of Chagas disease is
the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is mainly transmitted through blood-sucking insect vectors of the Triatominae subfamily, being Triatoma infestans, Rhodnius
prolixus, and Triatoma dimidiata the most epidemiologically important vectors. T. infestans is currently the
main vector in the southern part of South America
including regions of northern Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and southern Peru. R. prolixus, on the other hand,
is distributed in northern South America (mainly in
Colombia and Venezuela) and has few foci in Central
America. T. dimidiata, is present in Central America
and Mexico, and also has limited foci in northern South
America [2-4].
Due to population migration from Latin America,
Chagas disease is becoming an important health issue in
North America, Europe and in the western Pacific
region [5]. Currently, there are >390,000 individuals
infected with T. cruzi in non-endemic regions and,
accordingly, serological monitoring of blood banks and

organ donors as well as additional controls to detect
vertical transmission in newborns must be implemented
to prevent the spread of the disease.
As there are currently no vaccines available against
T. cruzi and effective treatments are limited to chemotherapies that exhibit high toxicity, large efforts are
being made to implement prevention strategies, such as
domestic vector control and improvement of blood
bank surveillance [6]. Currently, the main method of
vector control is spraying houses with residual insecticides. However, the occurrence of T. infestans populations resistant to pyrethroid compounds in the north of
Argentina and Bolivia [7,8] poses the alternative of organophosphate insecticides. Unfortunately, these insecticides, although effective, are very toxic and less accepted
by the community due to their unpleasant odor [9].
Novel methods of control will undoubtedly require
detailed understanding of the molecular biology of
Chagas disease vectors. This will provide unique opportunities to develop new vector control tools such as the
use of transgenic vectors refractory to pathogens. The
identification of trait genes linked to transposable elements could drive those alleles into wild populations
and interrupt disease transmission in the long-term
[10,11]. Although in the short run, this strategy is not
feasible for Chagas disease control due to the need of an
intense laboratory and field research, it is, nevertheless,
an approach that deserves to be explored.

The availability of complete genome sequences of
medically important vectors will accelerate the identification of new target genes to advance in novel vector control strategies, such as the use of transgenic vectors [12],
and the control of pathogen transmission by targeting
genes responsible for host-seeking behaviors. In line with
this, several initiatives to sequence vectors of infectious
diseases have been launched and some have been finished
[13,14]. In 2005, the NIH-National Human Genome
Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Washington University Medical School Genome Sequencing Center decided
to sequence the genome of R. prolixus, as a model for
the Reduviidae family [15]. However, advancing in
T. infestans genomics is also of major importance, as this
is the main vector in many South American areas, particularly in Argentina.
As an alternative or complement of genome projects,
transcriptome studies performed by sequencing cDNA
libraries of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) or of open
reading frame ESTs (ORESTES), constitute a rapid, lowcost and effective way to obtain information of the transcriptionally active regions of any organism and to
discover novel genes [16-18].
Currently, transcriptome information available for the
Triatoma genus is very limited. In fact, only salivary
gland ESTs projects have been carried out for T. brasiliensis, T. infestans and T. dimidiata [19-21]. The study
of T. infestans sialome has provided a set of 1534 salivary gland cDNA sequences, 42% of which encode proteins of a putative secretory nature - most of which
(55%) have been described as lipocalins [20].
With the aim to gain further insights into T. infestans
transcriptome and to discover novel genes in this insect,
we started a small project to generate ESTs from this
vector. In the present work, we report the analysis of
826 ESTs and provide information of interest for the
development of new drugs to target the biological cycle
of the insect.

Results and discussion
ESTs overview

To generate T. infestans ESTs, a total of 1881 clones
were sequenced from different cDNA libraries obtained
from different tissues and developmental stages (for
details see Additional file 1: Table S1). The complete
dataset was analyzed as a unit, independently of the
library to which the sequences belonged.
After the cleaning steps, 826 sequences (i.e., 44% of all
the clones sequenced) were classified as high quality
ESTs (Table 1) and were uploaded into the GenBank
ESTs database with accession numbers from [GenBank:
HO762759 to GenBank:HO763584]. This dataset
increases the number of available T. infestans ESTs by
47%, from 1738 to 2564.

details.

To unify overlapping high quality ESTs, eliminate
redundancies and facilitate further studies, a de novo
assembly was performed. This step grouped the high
quality ESTs in 119 contigs and 352 singlets, summing
up to 471 assembled unique sequences (AUS), with an
average size of 358 bp, representing different putative
transcripts or different parts of the same transcript of
T. infestans (Table 1).
To know the percentage of new T. infestans ESTs provided by the AUS generated, BLASTN searches were performed against the EST database at NCBI. Only 10% (47)
of the AUS gave positive hits against T. infestans, indicating that the remaining 90% (424) AUS are novel ESTs
sequences for T. infestans (Additional file 2: Table S2).
BLASTX searches yielded 37% (176) of AUS with significant similarity to protein sequences (E-value < 1e-10)
(Table 1). InterProScan searches yielded 4% (20) of AUS
with similarity to a protein domain, 45% of which also
had a hit in the NR protein database. As a whole, homologies against protein databases summarized 39% (185)
of AUS with hits in at least one database (Table 1).
Additionally, Enzyme Commission (EC) codes were
assigned to 44 AUS, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms to
123 AUS (Table 1).
Comparative analysis to other taxa

The AUS with positive BLASTX results (n = 176, see
Table 1) were taxonomically classified according to the
top-hit (Figure 1). Only 10% (17) of these AUS were
most similar to predicted proteins from T. infestans and
3% (6) to predicted proteins from four members of the
family Reduviidae (R. prolixus, T. dimidiata, T. vitticeps
and T. brasiliensis; see Additional file 2: Table S2 for
details). These results can be partially explained by the
fact that at the time that this paper was written there
were no complete genomes available for any triatomine.
Actually, the phylogenetically closest sequenced genome

available belongs to the hemipteran Acyrthosiphum
pisum, which has been recently released in a draft
assembly status [22]. Not surprisingly, A. pisum is the
most represented organism in the “other hemiptera”
category with 20 top-hits. The most represented organism in the “other insects” category, and in the entire
dataset, is the coleopteran Tribolium castaneum, with
29 top-hits. This last result is in agreement with the
findings for the A. pisum genome, for which the organisms with the highest shared gene content were T. castaneum and Nassonia vitripennis, both with 53% [22].
However, it is expected that more closely related
orthologs will begin to appear as genome projects of
phylogenetically closer organisms are finished and annotation information becomes available, in particular from
the in-progress genome project of R. prolixus [23].
Today, this is reflected when using our AUS as queries
in BLASTN searches against the WGS database at
NCBI, where 56% (265) of the top-hits are from R. prolixus whole-shotgun genome sequences (Additional file
2: Table S2). Consequently, our study will contribute
with gene prediction and annotation in the aforementioned genome project.
Gene Ontology annotation

The GO project is a bioinformatics initiative aiming to
standardize the representation of gene and gene product
attributes across species [24]. GO provides three controlled vocabularies to describe a gene product in terms
of: the biological process (BP) in which it is involved, its
molecular function (MF), and the cellular component
(CC) where it acts. The assignation of GO terms to our
dataset with the default parameters resulted in the
annotation of 123 AUS. Among them, 95 were classified
according to BP, 110 to MF and 78 to CC, and 60 had

Page 3 of 7

at least one GO term of each vocabulary. The most frequently assigned terms in each vocabulary are presented
in Figure 2. For the BP category, the three most common terms were “translation” (23), “transport” (20) and
“cytoskeleton organization” (19) (Figure 2A). For the MF
category, the four most common terms were “protein
binding” (29), “metal ion binding” (27), “cation binding”
(21) and “nucleic acid binding” (20) (Figure 2B); and for
the CC category, the most common terms were “protein
complex” (19), “intracellular membrane-bounded organelle” (19) and “ribosome” (18) (Figure 2C). Interestingly, when we performed a similar analysis upon the T.
infestans ESTs already in the EST database, in the BP
vocabulary, the term “evasion or tolerance of host
defense response” was by far the most represented (data
not shown). This result is directly associated with the
fact that the T. infestans ESTs available up to now are
significantly enriched in sequences coding for salivary
lipocalins. Thus, we think that the heterogeneity of our
ESTs will enlarge and complement the data already
available, particularly with regard to genes involved in
diverse biological processes.
Description of genes of interest

In this work we identified 151 AUS that did not match
with protein sequences of T. infestans or other reduviids
and which represent 136 novel genes for the Reduviidae
family (Table 2 and Additional file 3: Table S3). A
detailed analysis of the putative genes identified is not
within the scope of this work and will certainly be carried out by researchers interested in the field. However,
a number of interesting matches with sequences from
non-reduviid organisms were observed in the category
“development and reproduction” (Additional file 3:
Table S3). Among them, we found several transcripts
encoding proteins related to the juvenile hormone (JH)
metabolism such as vitellogenin, hexamerins and JH
esterase. The JH is a sesquiterpene essential for development and reproduction in insects [25]. Interestingly, it
has been shown that a compound that interferes with
the metabolism of the JH induce biomorphological
alterations in three species of the Triatominae subfamily,
including T. infestans [26], suggesting that the JH could
be a new target to control the vector population.
ESTs belonging to Contig114 and Contig118, and the
singlets Tinf_aii_1_i4 and Tinf_am_4_a4, have significant matches to different parts of the vitellogenin protein (Additional file 3: Table S3). This hemolymph
lipoprotein, a predominant yolk protein precursor, is
synthesized mainly in adult female fat body, secreted
into the hemolymph and taken up by the growing
oocytes. This biological process called vitellogenesis
allows embryonic development outside the maternal
body and is regulated by the JH in most insects [27].

Although vitellogenin has been purified and described
biochemically for T. infestans [28,29], its gene sequence
has not been determined yet, therefore our data will
enable and facilitate obtaining the entire gene sequence.

synthesized by the fat body and secreted into the hemolymph where they reach extraordinary concentrations
prior to metamorphosis, a process in which they serve
as a source of amino acids. They also may function as
JH-binding proteins [30,31]. The biosynthetic processes
related to the production of the very high density lipoprotein (VHDL), a T. infestans hexamerin, have been
described by Rimoldi et al. (1997) [32]. In addition, hexamerins have also been described in R. prolixus [33] and
in Riptortus clavatus [34], both members of the panheteroptera hemipteran clade. However, the hemipteran
A. pisum apparently lacks these proteins [22].
Tinf_4its_8_B10 has significant homology to the JH
esterase (JHE) (Additional file 3: Table S3). This carboxylase enzyme, along with the JH epoxide hydrolase, is
responsible for JH degradation. It is synthesized mainly
by the fat body and released into the hemolymph where
its high levels are associated with low levels of circulating
JH [35]. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that
transgenic silkworms overexpressing JHE from embryonic stages undergo precocious larval-pupal metamorphosis [36]. Due to its key role in the regulation of JH titers
during insect development and reproduction, JHE has
been the target for the investigation of selective drugs
[37,38]. Therefore, this protein seems to be also a promising drug target to control Chagas disease vectors by
targeting the biological cycle of the insect.
We also found interesting transcripts representative of
proteins involved in development and reproduction but

Avila et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:39

without a direct relationship with JH. For example, the
encoded protein in Contig91 is similar to the lingerer
protein (Additional file 3: Table S3); the lingerer gene
(lig) from Drosophila has been shown to be involved in
the initiation and completion of copulation [39]. Males
carrying a hypomorphic mutation in lig cannot withdraw
their genitalia at the end of copulation. In addition, a
severe reduction of the lig dosage causes repeated mating
attempts without success, and complete loss of lig function causes lethality during early pupal stage [39].
Other interesting matched proteins in other insects
are the protein Dumpy (Contig72), which is essential for
proper wing formation in Drosophila [40], and a growth
factor (Contig50), which belongs to the family of imaginal disc growth factors (IDGFs). In Drosophila, these
polypeptide growth factors are expressed most strongly
in the embryonic yolk cells and in the fat body of the
embryo and larva, and cooperate with insulin to stimulate the proliferation, polarization and motility of imaginal disc cells [41].

samples were included as PCR positive controls. The
integrity of the total RNA was assessed by agarose electrophoresis together with the A260/A280 ratio.
Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using the MicroPoly(A)
Purist™ Kit (Ambion) or the PolyATtract® mRNA Isolation System IV (Promega), both according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA synthesis and library construction

Conclusions
In this work, we generated 826 ESTs from T. infestans,
which were assembled in 471 unique sequences, 151 of
which represent 136 new genes for the Reduviidae
family. These data, already available to researchers interested in the field, might provide new insights into the
biology of T. infestans, and potential targets for future
rational drug design to control T. infestans, an important vector of Chagas disease in South America.

Three different strategies were applied for cDNA library
construction: i) a conventional library was constructed
by using the SMART cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech),
following the manufacturer’s instructions; ii) a second
set of conventional libraries was constructed using the
PCR-Select™ cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech) as
unsubtracted libraries, which implies ligating the sample
with both adaptors at the same time, and not performing the hybridization steps; and iii) ORESTES libraries
were constructed as described by Dias-Neto et al.
(2000), with minor modifications [43]. Libraries ii) and
iii) were ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega).
All libraries were transformed into E. coli DH5-alpha
cells.
T. infestans specimens, tissue samples and cDNA
library construction strategies are summarized in Additional file 1.

Methods

Nucleotide Sequencing

T. infestans specimens, tissue samples and mRNA
isolation

Independent colonies were picked and transferred into
384- or 96-well culture plates containing: 80 μl of 2xTY
medium supplemented with 10% of HMFM anti-freezing
medium [44] and 0.1% of ampicillin (10 mg/ml) in each
well. Colonies were grown at 37°C overnight and stored
at -70°C until use. Each colony was assigned with a clone
number consisting of the name of the library, followed by
the culture plate number and well position.
An aliquot of 15 μl of each culture was transferred
into a 96-well PCR microplate, and incubated for 5 minutes at 100°C. A colony-PCR reaction was performed in
a new 96-well PCR microplate, using universal M13 forward and reverse primers, and 1 μl of the boiled culture.
PCR conditions were: 94°C 2 min - (94°C 30 sec - 55°C
30 sec - 72°C 40 sec) 30 cycles - 72°C 5 min. All PCR
reactions were carried out in a T-Professional thermocycler (Biometra).
The amplification products were visualized in a 1.5%
agarose gel with ethidium bromide. The reactions that
had only one band greater than 300 or 400 bp, depending on the library, were selected for clean-up and
sequencing. For clean-up, 3 - 5 μl of the PCR product

Fourth instar specimens were provided by the Center of
Vector Reference, Córdoba, Argentina, and by the
National Institute of Parasitology “Dr. Mario Fatala Chaben”, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Muscle tissue samples
from adult specimens were obtained from the Department
of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Córdoba, Argentina. Gut
tissue samples from adult specimens were provided by the
Department of Microbiology, Parasitology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Buenos
Aires, Argentina.
In all cases, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) and residual genomic DNA was removed by
DNase treatment using RNase-free DNase I (Ambion).
Both procedures were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The absence of residual DNA was tested by PCR, using
the following primers: CytB_Fwd 5’- GGACAAATATCATGAGGAGCAACAG and CytB_Rev 5’- ATTACTC
CTCCTAGCTTATTAGGAATTG, targeted to the

and 0.5 U of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Fermentas)
(30 min at 37°C and then 15 min at 85°C). Single-pass
sequencing was performed on each cleaned template in
an ABI 3130 sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using T7
or Sp6 primers, or the primer pDNR-LIB_Forward-53:

The raw traces obtained were base-called using the
Phred program [45] with quality cut-off set at 20. Lucy2
[46] was used to remove the vector and adaptor
sequences, as well as to trim low quality regions and
poly-A/T tails (>14 contiguous bases). Sequences of less
than 100 bp were excluded.
The BLASTN program was used to search for similar
sequences through the non-redundant (NR) nucleotide
database at National Centre for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) with an E-value < 1e-3. Sequences with significant
similarity to Triatoma virus sequences, rRNA or mtDNA
genes of any organism were removed. The remaining high
quality sequences were assembled with the Contig Assembly Program 3 (CAP3) [47] using the default parameters of
40 bp of overlap length and 80% of overlap identity.
Phred, Lucy2 and CAP3 steps were performed with the
web-based pipeline for ESTs, EST-piper [48].

Analysis and annotation of ESTs

The assembled unique sequences (AUS) were used as
queries in BLASTN searches against the NCBI Wholegenome shotgun reads (WGS) database with a E-value
< 1e-3, and against the EST database with an E-value
< 1e-3. Positive T. infestans matches in the EST database were considered to be the same sequence when the
E-value was lower than 10e-13. All BLASTN searches
were carried out with the blastcl3 program, which allows
blasting in batch.
To annotate each AUS, homology searches in protein
sequence and protein domain databases, EC numbers
assignation and GO term mapping were carried out
using the Blast2GO software [49] (Additional file 2:
Table S2). The BLAST step was carried out using
BLASTX with an E-value cutoff of < 1e-10, and a minimal high-scoring segment pair (HSP) alignment length of
20 amino acids. The BLAST description annotation function was based on the first 20 hits that fulfill the E-value
cutoff. InterProScan function (from the European Bioinformatics Institute [50]) was used to search in the following protein domain databases: HMM-Pfam, HMMSmart, HMM-Tigr, ProfileScan, PatternScan, Superfamily
and HMM-Panther. AUS were mapped to Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers [51] and to the three Gene Ontology (GO) vocabularies [52] (Biological Process (BP),
