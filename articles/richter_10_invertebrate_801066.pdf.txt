Abstract
Background: Invertebrate nervous systems are highly disparate between different taxa. This is reflected in the
terminology used to describe them, which is very rich and often confusing. Even very general terms such as ‘brain’,
‘nerve’, and ‘eye’ have been used in various ways in the different animal groups, but no consensus on the exact
meaning exists. This impedes our understanding of the architecture of the invertebrate nervous system in general
and of evolutionary transformations of nervous system characters between different taxa.
Results: We provide a glossary of invertebrate neuroanatomical terms with a precise and consistent terminology,
taxon-independent and free of homology assumptions. This terminology is intended to form a basis for new
morphological descriptions. A total of 47 terms are defined. Each entry consists of a definition, discouraged terms,
and a background/comment section.
Conclusions: The use of our revised neuroanatomical terminology in any new descriptions of the anatomy of
invertebrate nervous systems will improve the comparability of this organ system and its substructures between
the various taxa, and finally even lead to better and more robust homology hypotheses.

Introduction
The nervous system is a major organ system in almost all
metazoans, with sponges and placozoans the only exceptions. Its fascination comes from its complexity, particularly in vertebrates, and its enormous diversity in
invertebrates. The first detailed descriptions of invertebrate nervous systems were published over 150 years ago,
and the evolution of nervous systems of all kinds has
been the focus of evolutionary morphologists for many
decades. Particularly noteworthy in this regard are the
Swedish neuroanatomists N. Holmgren (1877-1954) and
B. Hanström (1891-1969). Their comparative research
across a broad range of invertebrate taxa contributed
immensely to our knowledge of nervous system architecture. Hanström was also the first scientist to reconstruct
phylogenetic relationships in detail on the exclusive basis
of neuroanatomical characters, a tradition which was

among others, using cladistic approaches. The more general combination of a detailed analysis of neuroanatomical characters followed by their interpretation in a
phylogenetic and evolutionary context was christened
‘neurophylogeny’ by the Canadian neurobiologist
Dorothy Paul [3,4], a term made popular by Harzsch
[5,6]. The renaissance of ‘neurophylogeny’ in the last two
decades has been fuelled by immunohistochemistry and
confocal-laser-scanning microscopy, techniques which
have revolutionized the study of nervous systems. In
combination, these techniques allow nervous system
structures to be documented much more intuitively than
was ever previously possible using serial sections and
TEM, and, equally importantly, in a much higher number
of species. In addition to the architecture of the nervous
system it has also become possible to study the expression of certain neurotransmitters, which in turn makes it
easier to identify specific structures (e.g., individual neurons). These new techniques have encouraged many
zoologists to re-investigate the nervous system of various

animal taxa and to explore it in taxa in which it had not
been studied previously. Many of these studies have provided detailed structural analyses in the framework of
what has been called ‘New animal phylogeny’ [7].
Decades of detailed descriptions combined with the
diversity of nervous systems, which range from the relatively simple neural architectures in groups such as cnidarians and platyhelminthes to the highly complex
nervous systems in insects and cephalopods, have, however, resulted in a wealth of neuroanatomical terms
which it is almost impossible to keep track of. The terminology covers all levels of the structural hierarchy. On
the highest level, the nervous system as a whole has, for
example, been described as either a ‘plexus’, an ‘orthogon’
or a ‘rope-ladder-like nervous system’ representing alternative types of organizations. On a lower level, specific
subunits of nervous systems, such as the ‘central body’
and the ‘protocerebral bridge’ in the arthropod brain,
have also been identified. On the cellular level, cell biologists have built up a detailed terminology of nerve and
receptor cells. However, many terms, even very general
ones such as ‘brain’, ‘nerve’, and ‘eye’, are used in varying
ways in the different animal groups, and no consensus on
their exact meaning exists. Not only are terms used differently in different taxa, varying research interests have
also brought forth their own terminology, with the most
significant differences being between the nomenclature
used by physiologists and functional morphologists on
the one hand and that preferred by comparative and evolutionary morphologists on the other. For most features
of the nervous system, knowledge about their function
and physiology extends right down to the molecular
level. Strictly speaking however, this only holds true for a
very limited number of organisms, primarily vertebrates
and hexapods and a few other taxa. As a result, morphologists often need to draw inferences about the function
of certain structures by analogy. If we intend to use a
morphological terminology which covers all the metazoans, it should, therefore, preferably be based on structure
and topology rather than function [8]. This ties in with
our main objective, which is to trace the evolution of the
morphology of the nervous system in invertebrates on
the basis of the evolutionary transformations implied by
their phylogenetic relationships.
Recently, a general debate has arisen over how a higher
degree of transparency, inter-subjectivity, reproducibility
and communicability can be obtained when it comes to
morphological data. Although it is generally agreed that a
more precise, standardized terminology will be necessary
in the future [9-13], varying proposals have been made
with regard to what it should be based on. It has been
suggested on the one hand that morphological descriptions should be independent of any homology assumptions [8,11], while on the other, primary homologies have

Page 2 of 49

explicitly been put forward as the basis for a “morphological terminology” [10]. In our view, in the comparative
framework of phylogenetic analyses, the two approaches
complement each other. We agree that morphological
descriptions and terminology should be free of any
assumptions regarding homology, and not be restricted
to certain taxa. However, if, as parts of organ systems,
structures are conceptualized as character states and
characters for the purposes of phylogenetic analysis, primary homology is necessarily implied (e.g., [8,14]).
Applying a specific term to a character state (or character) after a test of primary homology (e.g., [15-17])
implies that the state and the character are homologous.
We all need to be aware that after 150 years of
research into evolutionary morphology, every single
morphological description and term used is affected by
an evolutionary interpretation of the morphology and
structures in question. Often, terms do not even refer to
exact descriptions but imply some kind of generalization, revealing that typological thinking is still present in
our terminology. Morphological terminology is not a
pristine field, and it is important that we take this into
account in our dealings with it.
Fully aware of the problems of such an approach, we
herein provide a glossary which we suggest be used as a
guide through the field of neurophylogeny and taken as a
starting point in formulating definitions of characters and
character states in phylogenetic character matrices. For
each term, extensive background is provided, outlining the
history of the term and explaining how it has already
played a role in the discussion of nervous system evolution. In addition, we discourage certain other terms which
are either synonymous with the favoured term or whose
relationship to the favored term is unclear. We advocate
the use of precise and consistent terminology which is
taxon-independent and free of homology assumptions, but
the long tradition of descriptive nervous system morphology has not been ignored in the making of this glossary
and the general and established use of any single term has
thus been taken into consideration. Taxon-independence
does not cancel out the fact that the greater the detail in
which a term is defined, the more its application will be
restricted to certain taxa. Many general features are
defined on the basis of the seminal account by Bullock
and Horridge [18], but almost 50 years later it has often
been necessary to update the terminology used by those
authors. We hope that the use of our revised neuroanatomical terminology in any new descriptions of the anatomy
of invertebrate nervous systems will improve the comparability of this organ system and its substructures between
the various taxa, and finally even lead to better and more
robust homology hypotheses.
We restrict our glossary mainly to general neuroanatomical terms that are applicable to all or almost all

Richter et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:29
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/7/1/29

invertebrate taxa, but do include more specific terms in
several groups. We also include terms for sensory
organs, particularly light-sensitive organs. We have chosen those terms which, to our knowledge, have the
greatest impact on the discussion of the evolution of
nervous systems. It goes without saying that the restrictions we have imposed also reflect the expertise of the
authors of the present glossary. The format defined
herein will facilitate the addition of new entries in the
future.
Our suggestions for a glossary come at a time when
formalized ‘ontologies’ - defined and controlled
vocabularies which are computer interpretable - are
beginning to play a role (e.g., [19-24]). These will
undoubtedly be an important tool in all future morphological work [9,11,12], and our definitions try to
take this into account by following a specific formalized scheme and, in particular, by explicitly indicating
class-subclass and part-whole relationships. Neuroanatomical ontologies are already very popular in biomedicine (e.g., [25-30]), and although most ontology
projects in zoology have so far focused on single
model system species (e.g., Drosophila melanogaster,
Caenorhabditis elegans) or morphologically relatively
well-defined taxa (e.g., Hymenoptera, Amphibia),
the field is growing rapidly (see NCBO BioPortal:
http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ for projects which are
planned or underway). Developing anatomy ontologies
for the entire group of metazoans or at least all invertebrates will be a much greater challenge and a goal
that will occupy research groups all over the world
for many decades (for initial attempts see the
Common Anatomy Reference Ontology, CARO [31],
and UBERON, http://obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/
UBERON:Main_Page).
All the definitions in this glossary are organized
according to Aristotelian definitions (definitions per
genus et differentiam see, e.g., [11,12,20,32]). Each definition is composed of two parts: (i) The genus part specifies which general (parent) term this (child) term is a
more specific subtype of. This results in a hierarchy of
more and more inclusive terms which is based on classsubclass relationships (Figure 1; see also taxonomic
inclusion, [33]). This hierarchy is generally referred to as
a taxonomy (i.e., taxonomy in a broad sense). Within
taxonomies, the defining properties are inherited downstream (downward propagation) from a given class to all
its subclasses. Therefore, the genus part of a definition
functions like a shorthand and stands for the defining
properties of all the term’s parent terms. It specifies the
set of properties that each instance of the defined type
necessarily possesses, though possession of these properties is not, in itself, sufficient for the instantiation of
the type. (ii) The differentia part, on the other hand,

Page 3 of 49

specifies the set of properties that distinguish the type
to be defined from all the other sub-types of the parent
type. The combination of genus and differentia specifies
the set of properties that is sufficient for the instantiation of the defined type. As a consequence, the genus
and the differentia part of a given term’s definition
together provide the genus part of all of its direct subsidiary terms.
The definitions in this glossary are organized according to the following scheme, with the first sentence
representing the genus part and all subsequent sentences
the differentia part of the definition:
{#} Defined term

The defined term is a (type of) ➞its parent term. It is
part of a/the ➞other term. We use ‘part of the’ in the
sense of ‘part of every’ and ‘part of a’ in the sense of
‘part of some’. Further defining properties may follow.
Those neuroanatomical terms which are printed in
bold and with an arrow are ➞main entries; they were
given a specific definition and numbered from {1} to
{47}. Those neuroanatomical terms which are printed
without an arrow and in bold are side entries; they do
not have a specific definition but are likewise important
for neuroanatomical descriptions. Table 1 lists all main
entries and side entries with their positions in the text this will be a helpful tool when using this glossary.

Entries
{1} Apical organ

The apical organ is a ➞sensory organ. It is part of a
➞nervous system and comprises an apical ciliary tuft
and ➞receptor cells. It is located at the anterior pole of
larvae.
Discouraged terms: apical ganglion, apical rosette,
apical plate.
Background/comment: In most representatives of
Lophotrochozoa, the apical organ consists of a specific
number of flask-shaped receptor cells and displays serotonin-like immunoreactivity (SLI), and sometimes also
FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity (RFLI) (Figure 2).
Additional cell types such as the ones bearing the cilia that
contribute to the apical ciliary tuft are present. The larval
apical organ is a major sensory system which often is said
to be of importance in detecting settlement cues, though
this has never been proven experimentally. Arguments
against this notion are the fact that several taxa are known
to undergo metamorphosis without having an apical organ
(e.g., Echiura [34,35]) or to lose the apical organ prior to
the onset of metamorphosis (e.g., in Scaphopoda [36]).
Most spiralian larvae have about 4 flask-shaped receptor
cells displaying SLI. However, polyplacophoran larvae and
creeping-type entoproct larvae differ from the common
spiralian phenotype in that they have 8-10 flask-shaped

receptor cells and an additional set of peripheral cells, rendering their apical organs the most complex among spiralian larvae (Figure 2). This is considered an apomorphy of
a proposed monophyletic Tetraneuralia (➞tetraneurion)
comprising Entoprocta and Mollusca [37].
In some studies the term ‘apical ganglion’ has been
ascribed to the larval part of the anterior sensory organ
of spiralian larvae, which often coexists with the early
rudiment of the forming adult ➞brain. The two structures together, i.e., the larval and the adult components
of the anteriormost neural structures in late-stage spiralian larvae, are then sometimes referred to as the ‘apical
organ’ [38]. The use of these terms is misleading both

because the larval components usually only comprise a
loose assemblage of cells which do not form a distinct
➞ganglion and because the larval components might be
entirely absent, rendering the term ‘apical organ’ synonymous with brain in these species. Accordingly, the
term ‘apical ganglion’ should be eliminated and ‘apical
organ’ only be applied in accordance with the definition
provided above, i.e., to the anterior larval sensory organ
that bears flask-shaped receptor cells and gets lost during metamorphosis.
In most lophotrochozoans, the adult brain or so-called
cerebral commissure forms at the base of the flaskshaped cells of the apical organ prior to the resorption

of the latter. This is usually considered to be evidence of
the role of the larval apical organ in the induction of the
formation of the adult brain in Lophotrochozoa.
{2} Arcuate body

The arcuate body is an ➞unpaired midline neuropil. It
is part of a ➞syncerebrum and connected to second
order visual ➞neuropils and to postoral neuropils.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Strausfeld [39] introduced the
term arcuate body to denominate an unpaired midline
neuropil in the chelicerate brain that had formerly been
called ➞central body [40]. The neuroanatomical evidence that distinguishes the arcuate body from the central body is mainly provided by its connectivity: unlike
the arcuate body, the central body is only indirectly
related to sensory neuropils and has no direct projections to postoral neuropils [39,41]. Apart from chelicerates, an unpaired midline neuropil exhibiting a
similarly close relationship to the visual system has also
been described for the onychophoran species Euperipatoides rowelli [42].
{3} Brain

A brain is a cluster of ➞neurons. It is part of a ➞nervous system. It is the most prominent anterior condensation of neurons and may also include further types of
cells, including ➞glial cells and pigment cells.

Discouraged terms: cerebral ganglion, supraesophageal ganglion.
Background/comment: Adhering to the definition
provided above, the criterion of anteriority excludes the
use of the term brain in organisms, which do not possess an anterior-posterior body axis. The term is thus
not applicable either to the circumoral concentrations of
neurons observed in cnidarian polyps or around the
manubrium of medusae, or to the thickened ➞neuropil
around the mouth opening of echinoderms. Neither do
the neuronal condensations in the rhopalia of Cubozoa
[43] qualify as brains under this definition. In Phoronida, Brachiopoda and Enteropneusta, a brain is not present after metamorphosis [44]. The position of the brain
is usually dorsal of the intestinal system (often the esophagus or pharynx), regardless of whether the attaching
➞nerve cord is dorsal or ventral (e.g., Figure 3B). This
also applies to metazoans with a reduced intestinal system (e.g., Acanthocephala). In a few exceptional cases,
such as in the nematomorph Nectonema, the brain is
ventral of the intestinal system [45].
In some taxa, similar types of brain organization have
historically received specific designations (Figure 3). The
term cycloneuralian brain thus characterizes an organizational mode in which a neuropil of almost uniform
thickness surrounds the anterior part of the intestinal
system in a ring-like fashion (Figure 3G, H). This is
observed in Nematoda, Priapulida, Kinorhyncha and

Loricifera [46]. Representatives of Gastrotricha, however,
possess a commissural brain different from the cycloneuralian brain (Figure 3A; [47]). In some representatives of the Acoela [48,49], only a variable anterior
dorsal condensation of neurons is present (Figure 3E).
This high variation in the degree of anterior neural concentration suggests that a condensation event occurred
independently in the various acoel lineages and that the
“uracoel” only had a weakly concentrated nervous system and not a “commissural brain” sensu Raikova et al.
[48].
Some taxa possess a compound brain that is formed by
the morphological fusion of embryologically separate
ganglion-anlagen. In taxa with segmental body organization, at least some of the subunits constituting the compound brain may have originated in metamerically
arranged pairs of ➞ganglia, as is generally assumed to be
the case in arthropods. However, there is ongoing debate
about the number and nature of the subunits of the
arthropod ➞syncerebrum. Similarly, the possible segmental origin and subdivision of the annelid brain has also
long been a matter of dispute ([50], discussed in [51,52]).
In many annelids the brain develops from the larval episphere, whereas the paired ganglia of the trunk segments
have their origin in the hyposphere [53]. The adult brain is
linked the postoral segmental paired ganglia via circumesophageal ➞connectives (Figure 3C; [52]). In most annelids, the brain contains specific neuropil compartments
and a number of ➞tracts (e.g., [52,54-56]). Furthermore,
distinct commissural ganglia situated on the circumesophageal connectives may be present in certain taxa. Nevertheless, annelid development does not unambiguously
support the view that the preoral annelid brain is composed of a number of segmental pairs of ganglia. What
there may be is a certain degree of cephalization of the
first trunk segments (peristomium and following segments), which often bear sensory appendages instead of
regular parapodia (e.g., [57,58]. The ganglia of the corresponding segments are often more or less fused to form a
large suboesphageal ganglion. In certain taxa the anteriormost trunk ganglia are closely connected to the preoral
brain [54], resulting in a structure that could be considered a ‘perioral compound brain’ (see [53]). The cephalization of trunk segments renders the posterior boundary of
the annelid brain somewhat ambiguous (compare with the
situation of the tritocerebrum in arthropods, see
➞syncerebrum).
As in many annelids, the brain in certain Mollusca
develops from the larval episphere, whereas the more
posterior ganglia (pleural ganglia, pedal ganglia, etc.)
arise from ectoderm of the larval hyposphere [44]. The
sophisticated brain of Cephalopoda (Figure 3F) exhibits a
degree of neural concentration which is exceptional not
only among Mollusca but in invertebrates as a whole.

Page 7 of 49

This concentration resulted from the fusion of the individual sets of ganglia present in the last common gastropod-cephalopod ancestor. Although the cephalopod
brain circumscribes the esophagus, the number, nature
and relative position of its parts differ greatly from the
condition seen in arthropods. In some - but by no means
all - invertebrate brains, regions of neuronal somata and
➞neurites (➞neuropil) can be distinguished (see,
e.g., [59]). In spiralians, somata usually surround a central
neuropil. In most cycloneuralian brains, the somata are
anterior and posterior to the neuropil and in the commissural brain of gastrotrichs the somata are lateral to the
commissural neuropil [47]. In the deuterostome taxa
Pterobranchia and Tunicata we recommend using the
term ‘brain’ for the distinct anterior dorsal clusters of
neurons, despite the traditional use of ‘ganglion’ for these
structures (e.g., [60-63]. The brain architecture in Pterobranchia differs considerably from that in Tunicata. The
brain of pterobranchs consists of a basiepidermal concentration of axons (Figure 3D; [60,63]). It is not known for
certain how the neuronal somata in these brains are
arranged, but they seem to constitute a cell cortex that
surrounds a neuropil. In tunicates, the dorsal brain is surrounded by an extracellular matrix [61,62]. Peripheral
➞nerves originate from the brain, which displays a central neuropil and peripheral somata.
{4} Central body

The central body is an ➞unpaired midline neuropil. It
is a part of the ➞central complex. It is composed of
tangential and columnar ➞neurons. These neurons
form horizontal layers and provide a connection to the
➞lateral accessory lobes and the ➞protocerebral
bridge. Subpopulations of the columnar neurons cross
the midline of the ➞syncerebrum within the central
body or before entering the central body.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Detailed descriptions of the
neuroanatomy of the central body are available for various insects (for a synopsis of the relevant literature see
[64]). In this group, the central body consists of two
subunits (Figure 4A, B) termed the upper and lower
division [65] or, alternatively, the fan-shaped and ellipsoid body [66]. Both terminologies are in use today.
The central body in Crustacea also exhibits horizontal
layers but lacks a distinct separation into an upper and
lower division (Figure 4C). Single unpaired midline neuropils exhibiting central body-like architectural characters have also been described in Myriapoda, Chelicerata
and Onychophora [54]. Strausfeld [39,42,67] introduced
the term ➞arcuate body for these taxa. As yet, any
attempts to homologize these single unpaired midline
neuropils with individual components of the central
complex have failed due to the absence of the specific

complex.

plesiomorphic [73]. Several lines of evidence suggest that
the central complex acts as a higher navigational and locomotor control centre [74,75].

{5} Central complex

The central complex is a cluster of ➞neuropils. It is
part of a ➞syncerebrum. It consists of three interconnected subunits: the unpaired ➞central body, which is
situated in the middle of the neuropil assembly, the
unpaired ➞protocerebral bridge and the paired ➞lateral
accessory lobes.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Within the framework of the
central complex, the central body mediates between
the protocerebral bridge and the lateral accessory lobes
(Figure 4). All three subunits of the central complex are
linked to other parts of the protocerebrum. In those species studied in detail, connections between the central
complex and the postoral neuropils are established via the
lateral accessory lobes. Assemblies of neuropils in the
sense of the definition have only been described in Arthropoda to date. Williams [68] contributed significantly to
resolving the internal architecture and the connectivity
between the protocerebral bridge, central body and lateral
accessory lobes. A central complex has been identified in
all insect orders investigated so far (Figure 4A, B; [65]). In
Crustacea, a central complex adhering to the architectural
scheme found in Insecta has been described in representatives of Malacostraca (Figure 4C; [64,69]), Remipedia [70]
and Branchiopoda [71]. Although it is generally thought
that the components of the central complex are part of
the ground pattern of the Tetraconata [39,64,69-72], the
absence of at least some components of the central complex in certain crustaceans might well be interpreted as

{6} Commissure

A commissure is a ➞neurite bundle. It is part of a
➞nervous system. It is transversely oriented and the
majority of its ➞neurites are axons of interneurons.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Commissures typically extend
from left to right across the midline and connect longitudinal neurite bundles. In a ➞rope-ladder-like nervous system they medially adjoin the ➞ganglia of one
➞neuromere across the midline (Figure 5). They may
be embedded within the ➞neuropil when the hemiganglia are close together (see also ➞tract). In an ➞orthogon they may take on the shape of a closed ring and are
then called ring commissures.
{7} Compound eye

A compound eye is an ➞eye. It is part of a ➞nervous
system and consists of several to numerous almost
identical components, the ➞ommatidia. The sensory
input of the compound eye is processed by at least
two retinotopic ➞neuropils connected to the
➞syncerebrum.
Discouraged terms: facetted eye
Background/comment: Compound eyes are currently
known to occur as lateral cerebral eyes in euarthropods
such as Xiphosura within Chelicerata [76], Scutigeromorpha within Myriapoda [77], Branchiura [78], cirriped
and ascothoracid larvae [79,80], Ostracoda Myodocopa
[81], Branchiopoda [82,83] and Malacostraca (e.g., [84])

within Crustacea (summaries [85,86]), and most representatives of Hexapoda (e.g., [86]). Compound eyes
share a single basal matrix, and interommatidial pigment cells are present between the ommatidia (see
[79]). The stemmata in the larvae of holometabolous
insects are modified compound eyes (e.g., [87,88]. The
lateral ocelli in Pleurostigmophora are compound eyes
as defined herein (for a detailed description see [89,90]).
In certain Branchiopoda, the compound eyes are fused
to form a single compound eye [83].
Eyes consisting of several units that have also been
named compound eyes are also present on the tentacular crown in certain Annelida (many Sabellidae, some
Serpulidae, see [91-95] and on the mantle edge in arcacean Bivalvia (Pterimorpha, Arcidae, see [93]). In arcean
Bivalvia they act as alarm systems and are present in
high numbers (in Sabella, for instance, up to 240 eyes
are seen, each made up of 40-60 single unitscalled ocelii). The eyes (optic cushions) on the oral surface of
Asteroida (Echinodermata), close to the base of the
terminal tentacles, are also composed of a number of
simple ocelli - as many as 80-200 in certain species
[96,97]. We suggest avoiding the termini compound
eyes and ommatidia when referring to non-arthropod
eyes because the differences to those of arthropods overweigh the shared features.
{8} Connective

A connective is a ➞neurite bundle. It is part of a
➞nervous system. It is completely or almost free of
somata and interconnects ➞ganglia longitudinally.

Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: The majority of ➞neurites in
the connectives are axons of interneurons ([18]; but
compare ➞medullary cord).
{9} Eye

An eye is a ➞sensory organ. It is part of a ➞nervous
system and consists of at least one ➞photoreceptor
cell and one separate pigmented supportive cell. An
eye allows directional access of light to the photosensitive structures.
Discouraged terms: photoreceptor, ocellus
Background/comment: Not only does an eye allow
light intensity to be measured, it also makes it possible
to discriminate the direction of light. This is essential
for phototaxis, the movement towards or away from a
light source. In general, an eye consists of at least two
and often numerous cells of two types: photoreceptor
cells and pigmented supportive cells. The latter serve as
shading structures and are crucial for the directional
guidance of light to the photosensitive structures. Other
cell types acting as light guiding structures may also be
present. Some authors use the term eye only for those
photoreceptive organs which are capable of producing
an image. However, the evolution of photoreceptive
organs is a story of a stunning increase in complexity,
making it hard to find an objective border between
“true” eyes and “proto-eye” precursors.
Eyes of different kinds are found in almost every
eumetazoan taxon (Figure 6; see [94,95,98-108]). The
evolution of this diversity very likely started with only

one multifunctional cell type, a condition that is
observed in extant poriferan and cnidarian larvae, for
example, which employ multifunctional cells with rhabdomeric photosensitive structures, shading pigment
granules and locomotory cilia [109-112]. It is assumed
that a multifunctional cell type diversified via functional
segregation into sister cell types that were specialized in
sub-functions such as photoreception on the one hand
and shading of these photoreceptive structures on the
other [111]. This led to the minimal eye (adhering to
the definition given herein) being made up of only two
cells: one photoreceptor cell and one supportive cell
with shading pigment (Figure 7; [94,103,113]).

There are several types of structurally more complex
eyes. These range from simple types called pigmentcup eyes, ocelli and prototype eyes [105], which comprise only pigment cells and photoreceptor cells, to
highly sophisticated eyes that possess different kinds of
light-guiding structures such as adjustable lenses and
irises, as found in cephalopods and vertebrates, for
example. However, highly developed lens eyes are not
restricted to these “higher” taxa and may even occur in
cnidarians, where lens eyes are part of the rhopalia in
the medusae of Cubozoa [114]. A distinction is often
made between the following morphological types of
multicellular eyes (arranged in a hypothetical

evolutionary transformation series): eye pit, eye cup, pinhole eye, closed eye, lens eye (Figure 6; [101]). In closed
eyes and lens eyes a cornea may be developed. One specific eye type is the ➞compound eye of arthropods. In
multicellular eyes, photoreceptor cells usually form an
epithelium, either exclusively or together with the pigmented supportive cells (depending on whether or not
they carry shading pigment themselves). An epithelium
comprising photoreceptor cells is called a retina. An
everse (converse) eye is characterized by a retina in
which the light-sensitive parts of the photoreceptor cells
face the incoming light and are directed away from the
concave surface of the eyecup (Figure 8B; [103]). In an
inverse eye the light-sensitive parts of the photoreceptor cells face away from the incoming light or are directed towards the concave surface of the eyecup (Figure
8A; [103]). Due to functional constraints, a bicellular eye
(Figure 7) is always an inverse eye, whereas multicellular
eyes may be either of the two types, depending on the
mode of development (Figure 8; [94,95]). An iris adjusts
the opening of the eyecup according to the intensity of
light and is usually composed of pigment and muscle
cells. A lens permits the formation of an image on the
retina of the eye. However, the distinction between lens
and vitreous body ("Füllmasse”) is often not clear
because functional investigations are often lacking (Figure 8B). Behind the photoreceptor cells, certain eyes
may contain reflective cells characterized by membrane-

Page 11 of 49

bound crystalline platelets or reflective pigment granula
which reflect light towards the photoreceptor cells to
increase (the probability of) photon detection. Reflective
cells are usually an adaptation to poor photic conditions.
In larger eyes they are organized as an epithelium
(tapetum). Such cells occur sparsely but are widely distributed among metazoans [115,116]. The substances
most commonly reported to be the active component of
reflective cells are guanine and pteridine.
Eyes situated in or close to the ➞brain are commonly
called cerebral eyes [103], though several examples of
extracerebral eyes situated outside the brain and the
condensed portion of the nervous system exist. Wellknown examples are the eyes of the mantle edge in certain bivalves (Arcidae; see [93]), or polychaete tentacular
(Sabellidae), segmental (Opheliidae, Syllidae) or pygidial
eyes (Sabellidae) which occur in certain Annelida (see
[95] for examples). Other examples are the optic cushions in Asteroida (Echinodermata).
An ocellus is nothing other than a diminutive eye. It is
impossible to draw a clear distinction between an ocellus and an eye due to the impossibility of forming an
unambiguous definition (see above; Figure 7A; [95]). In
Arthropoda, the term ocellus is used for certain ➞median eyes and for various lateral eyes which are considered to be modified ➞ommatidia or stemmata (in
particular in Myriapoda and Insecta; see [88]). The origin of the lateral ocelli in Arachnida remains an open

question [88]. The eyes in Onychophora are also termed
lateral ocelli [117,118]. Eye-like structures without shading pigments are frequently called unpigmented ocelli,
although strictly speaking they are not eyes because they
are not capable of detecting the direction of light, just
the intensity. These structures are composed of photoreceptor cell(s) and supportive cell(s) without shading pigment granules.
Eyes occurring in planctonic larvae are called larval
eyes. They are formed early in embryonic development
and are found in the larvae of Hemichordata and Ascidiacea and in the larvae of lophotrochozoan taxa
(Figure 7A). These eyes are composed of a limited number of cells (rarely more than 2-3) and are thus often
called ocelli too. Their structure is comparatively wellknown (for Mollusca see, for example, [119,120], for
Platyhelminthes see, for example, [121] and for Polychaeta see, for example, [122,123]; molecular characterization is best studied in the polychaete Platynereis
dumerilii [113,122,124]. During development, adult eyes
are usually formed after the larval eyes are functional
[95,105,120,122]. Apart from their simple structure, larval eyes are characterized by their molecular fingerprint

Page 12 of 49

and can thus be distinguished with certainty from adult
eyes (Arendt et al., unpublished information). However,
a structural distinction between a persisting larval eye
and a newly developed miniaturized adult eye is not
always discernible [125,126].
{10} Ganglion

A ganglion is a cluster of ➞neurons. It is part of a
➞nervous system. It may include ➞glial cells. The
neurons are arranged in a specific constellation: neuronal somata are concentrated at the surface, thus forming a cell cortex, and ➞neurites are concentrated in
the centre of the ganglion to form the ➞neuropil.
A ganglion is a distinct unit but several ganglia may be
anterio-posteriorly joined by ➞connectives or transversally by ➞commissures.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: The somata form a cell cortex
that may be loosely or tightly packed and one or several
cell layers thick but that is usually clearly demarcated
(Figure 9). The cell cortex in Protostomia is dominated
by unipolar neurons. Generally, there are no
➞synapses in the cell cortex (but exceptions exist, e.g.,

Figure 9 Schematic presentation of two ganglia in the rope-ladder-like nervous system. Original: C.M. Heuer.

Richter et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:29
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/7/1/29

in Arthropoda). The primary neurite of each neuron is
directed inwards and, together with dendrites and a
large number of axons of local interneurons, forms the
neuropil of the ganglion, in which the synapses are
located [18]. The neuropil may be loosely textured without defined regions or may be separated into neuropil
partitions and include ➞tracts. A ganglion may give rise
to ➞nerves which connect it to peripheral targets. In a
➞rope-ladder-like nervous system, several ganglia may
be antero-posteriorly joined by connectives (Figure 9).
In the rope-ladder-like nervous system of many arthropods, bilaterally arranged pairs of ganglia transversely
linked by commissures are present (Figure 5, 9). If bilaterally paired ganglia are fused at the midline, the partitions of this fused, single ganglion are called
hemiganglia. It is important to stress that local swellings of a ➞medullary cord do not qualify as ganglia as
defined here. Neither does the so-called ‘caudal ganglion’ in Priapulida [127].
The protostome-centered definition offered above covers only a fraction of the anatomical structures that have
been termed ganglia in (non-vertebrate) deuterostomes.
These include the cerebral ganglia (or sensory ganglia)
and the visceral ganglia in tunicate larvae [61,128] and
the dorsal (or central or cerebral) ganglion in Pterobranchia [60,63] and adult Tunicata [61,62]. Contrary to our
definition, the term ‘ganglion’ as currently used in deuterostomes is not restricted to a particular arrangement
of neuropil and somata. Another difference is that in
deuterostome ganglia, multipolar neurons are frequently present in addition to unipolar neurons, e.g., in
the dorsal ganglion of salps [61,62]. We suggest using
the term ➞brain not only for the ‘dorsal ganglia’ of
adult Tunicata and Pterobranchia (Figure 3D), but also
for the larval ‘cerebral ganglion’ of tunicates. The ‘visceral ganglion’ of tunicate larvae is part of the neurulated
nervous system (see ➞neural tube), or more precisely,
of the structure that is traditionally called the central
nervous system in vertebrate morphology. As a result,
in analogy to vertebrate morphology, the term ‘visceral
nucleus’ or ‘motor nucleus’ is recommended.
Neuron concentrations in the nervous systems of
Echinodermata, both larval [129,130] and adult [131],
are also called ganglia. Because a central nervous system
has not been identified in echinoderms nor a clear anatomical definition of a central nervous system provided
for Protostomia, we should not apply the vertebratecentred definition to Echinodermata. Our own definition applies to the repetitive ganglia present in the arms
of ophiuroid brittle stars at least [132]. The apical concentrations of somata in the larval stages of Enteropneusta are called apical ganglia [133,134]. In line with
the definition suggested for ➞apical organ in the present work, we discourage the use of the term apical

Page 13 of 49

ganglion in these cases and suggest replacing it by apical organ.
In vertebrate anatomy a ganglion is any condensation
of neuronal somata outside of the central nervous system and is to be distinguished from concentrations of
neuronal somata within the central nervous system
[135]. The latter are generally referred to as nuclei
[136]. Though the term ganglion is, nevertheless, sometimes applied to concentrations of somata within the
central nervous system, as in the case of the habenular
ganglion or the basal ganglion [137,138], this use of the
term is discouraged.
{11} Ganglion mother cell

A ganglion mother cell is a ➞neuronal precursor. It is
part of a developing ➞nervous system. It is generated
by an asymmetrical division of a ➞neuroblast. It divides
once to produce ➞neurons and/or ➞glial cells.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: So far, ganglion mother cells
have only been described in hexapods [139,140] and
malacostracan crustaceans [141,142].
{12} Glial cell

A glial cell is a cell. It is part of the ➞nervous system.
A glial cell interacts closely with ➞neurons by providing nutrients, removing the waste products of neuronal
metabolism, electrically insulating the neurons and controlling the passage of substances from the blood to the
neurons. It also supports, via its cytoskeleton, the structural arrangement of the cellular components of the
nervous tissue.
Discouraged terms: neuroglia, supportive cell
Background/comment: It is important to stress that
glial cells are a heterogeneous class (Figure 10). Because
of their role in metabolism glial cells usually contain
stores of glycogen. The supportive glial cell is a type
present in most invertebrates. It gives rise to processes
and lamellae specialized in providing mechanical support. These processes often surround and ensheath single ➞neurites or ➞neurite bundles and - except in
arthropods - contain intermediate filaments (Figure 10C,
D). Within a neurite bundle, single axons may be separated from each other or form small units with a common glial sheath (Figure 10C, D, E). A sheath might
also surround the ➞brain and ➞ganglia (Figure 11).
The sheath is composed of an outer acellular layer, the
neurilemma, and a layer of glial cells which underlies
the fibrous material of the neurilemma and forms the
perilemma (synonym perineurium) [143]. Neurite bundles that are not associated with glial cells are also common in various taxa of invertebrates. Furthermore,
where there are intracerebral blood vessels, an additional
role of glial cells is to provide a tight and relatively

impermeable barrier (the blood-brain barrier) to prevent
the diffusion of substances from the blood to the neurons [144].
{13} Globuli cell

A globuli cell is a ➞neuron. It is part of a cluster of
other globuli cells. It possesses a minute amount of
cytoplasm and a nucleus containing condensed chromatin. The somata of globuli cells are densely packed and

easily discernable from other neighbouring neuronal
somata due to their small diameter.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Globuli cells have been
described in the ➞brain of Platyhelminthes [145],
Nemertini [54], Mollusca [18,146], Polychaeta (Figure
12; [147]), Onychophora [42,67] and Euarthropoda [54].
One ➞neuropil associated with globuli cell clusters is

[147]. In Insecta, the globuli cells which constitute the
mushroom bodies are frequently referred to as Kenyon
cells. The optic neuropils [149] and hemiellipsoid
bodies in Decapoda [150] are also associated with globuli cell clusters.
{14} Lateral accessory lobe

The lateral accessory lobe is a ➞neuropil. It is part of the
➞central complex (see Figure 4). A pair of lateral accessory lobes is located slightly posterior to the ➞central
body. Descending and ascending ➞neurons of the lateral
accessory lobes establish connections between the ➞central complex and the postoral neuropils.
Discouraged terms: ventral body, lateral lobe
Background/comment: Anatomical and physiological
evidence suggests that the lateral accessory lobes facilitate communication between the central complex and
the motor centres in the thoracic ➞ganglia. In addition,
they also appear to connect other brain centres with the
postoral neuropils [151]. Use of the abbreviatory term
lateral lobes is discouraged to avoid confusion with an
identical term that is used in a different context in molluscan neuroanatomy (Bivalvia: [152]; Gastropoda: [153];
Cephalopoda: [154]).
{15} Median eye

A median eye is an ➞eye. It is part of a ➞nervous system and connected to a paired or unpaired median
anterior ➞neuropil of the ➞syncerebrum by one or
several median eye nerve(s).

Discouraged terms: frontal ocellus, median ocellus
Background/comment: This term covers the various
kinds of ➞nauplius eye, the frontal ocelli in Hexapoda,
the two median ocelli in Arachnida and Xiphosura (in
the latter taxon, two additional median eyes might be
present; [155]), and the four median ocelli present in
Pycnogonida [156]. The term ocellus, however, is also
used for various lateral eyes which are considered to be
modified ➞ommatidia or stemmata (in particular in
Insecta; see [88]) and is discouraged herein. Median
eyes are absent in Myriapoda.
In his seminal review, Paulus [86] suggested four median eyes for the ground pattern of Euarthropoda, though
this has often been disputed. Mayer [118] suggested
three median eyes to be part of the ground pattern of
Tetraconata on the basis of the common presence of
three median eyes in Hexapoda, e.g., in Archaeognatha,
Zygentoma, and Pterygota (see [86]) and most crustaceans. Only representatives of the Phyllopoda possess a
four-partite (nauplius) eye which, however, might
represent the derived condition (Figure 13; [157,158]).
On the basis of his argument that the ‘lateral ocelli’
[117] in Onychophora are in fact homologous to median
eyes, Mayer [118] suggested the presence of two median
eyes to be part of the ground pattern of Arthopoda, a
conclusion which is also supported by the presence of
only one pair of median eye nerves in Xiphosura and
Pycnogonida. In Xiphusura, the median eye nerves,
which in the adult carry afferents from the median
ocelli and the median rudimentary photoreceptors,

terminate in the paired ‘ocellar ganglia’ (better: ocellar
neuropils) in the anterior medial part of the protocerebrum [155]. A paired optic neuropil is also present in
Pycnogonida [159]. In crustaceans, the nauplius eye centre is unpaired [160] but early anlagen appear paired
[161].
{16} Medullary cord

A medullary cord is a ➞nerve cord. It is part of a
➞nervous system and consists of a longitudinally
extending central ➞neuropil surrounded by a cell cortex consisting of neuronal somata distributed along its
entire length. It may contain ➞glial cells and ➞receptor cells. A medullary cord is not divided into ➞ganglia
and soma-free ➞connectives.
Discouraged terms: Markstrang
Background/comment: The presence of soma-free
connectives (Figure 9) distinguishes a nervous system
with ganglia from a nervous system with medullary

cords [18]. The Onychophora are a typical example of
Arthropoda with two medullary cords [162,163].
{17} Mushroom body

A mushroom body is a ➞neuropil. It is part of a
➞brain. Mushroom bodies are paired and have a lobed
shape. A mushroom body is composed of dendrites and
parallelly arranged axons made up of thousands of
intrinsic neurons (➞neuron) of the ➞globuli cell type.
Discouraged terms: corpora pedunculata
Background/comment: Dujardin [164] was the first
to describe mushroom bodies in Insecta, terming them
corps pédonculés due to their resemblance to the fruiting bodies of fungi. Flögel [165] later defined criteria for
identifying mushroom bodies across insect species; these
criteria form the basis of the definition given above. The
morphology of the cells which make up mushroom
bodies (the ‘globuli cells’, or Kenyon cells in Insecta)
was described in detail by Kenyon [166,167]. Kenyon

subdivided the insect mushroom bodies into a calyx
region - formed by dendritic branches of Kenyon cells, a
pedunculus (peduncle) - formed by the parallel axons,
and an arrangement of lobes. The first systematic surveys of the occurrence of mushroom bodies were conducted by Holmgren [40], and later by Hanström
[54,168], who identified mushroom body-like neuropils
in polychaetes (Figure 12), Insecta, Myriapoda, Onychophora and Chelicerata. In the latter two taxa, the neuropils of the two hemispheres are confluent across the
midline of the brain [42,67]. A cluster of lobular neuropils in the brain of Cephalocarida (Crustacea) was also
termed ‘mushroom bodies’ [169]. Although this cluster
is laterally connected to a group of small-diameter globuli cell somata, its neuroarchitecture clearly differs
from that in insects.
{18} Nauplius eye

A nauplius eye is an ➞eye. It is part of a ➞nervous
system. It consists of a cluster of three or four ➞median eyes that form a single structural unit but are separated from one another by pigment layers.
Discouraged terms: three-partite eye, four-partite eye
Background/comment: This kind of eye (see Figure
13) is restricted to Crustacea. It is the only eye in nauplius larvae and persists in many taxa to the adult stage
[170,171]. The exact anatomy differs between taxa [160].
In phyllopod branchiopods, the nauplius eye consists of
four median eyes (also called eye cups) (Figure 13); in
all other taxa, three eye cups are present. In addition to
an absorbing pigment layer, a tapetum layer is present
in Maxillopoda (e.g., [171-173]) and Phyllopoda [158],
though it is formed by anatomically different components in these two taxa. One significant difference in the
structure of the nauplius eye between taxa lies in the
orientation of the sensory cells, which are directed
towards the light (everse eyes) in Malacostraca but
towards the pigment layer (inverse eyes) in other Crustacea [160]. A nauplius eye is completely absent in Mystacocarida, Cephalocarida and Remipedia. It is also
absent in some Malacostraca. In addition to the nauplius
eye, other photosensoric frontal organs might be present. Elofsson [160] argues that all photosensoric frontal
organs should be called frontal eyes and regards the
nauplius eye as nothing other than a complex of three
or four frontal eyes which which evolved several times
independently as three-partite or four-partite eyes.
According to our definition, however, the frontal organs
(apart from those forming the nauplius eye) are not eyes
at all because they consist of sensory cells only without
supportive pigment cells being present. In this, they differ fundamentally from nauplius eyes, even in cases
where the nauplius eye cups become separated from
each other during development (e.g., in cirripeds, [174]).

Page 18 of 49

In certain Decapoda, the pair of dorsal frontal organs
forms a functional unit with the three-partite nauplius
eye. It has been suggested that the term nauplius eye
sensu lato could be extended to this unit, which is certainly an eye as we define it. The nauplius eye cups and,
if present, additional frontal organs send their axons to
a median brain centre in the anterior margin of the protocerebrum, the nauplius eye centre. Lacalli [175]
described this in detail in a copepod as being rectangular in shape and subdivided into three cartridges, each
receiving ➞nerves from one of the three eye cups. Both
the outer envelope and the internal subdivisions of the
nauplius eye centre arise as flattened processes from a
single pair of ➞glial cells.
{19} Nerve

A nerve is a ➞neurite bundle. It is part of a ➞nervous
system. It connects a condensed nervous structure with
a given region in the periphery, i.e., with ➞receptor
cells (mechanoreceptors, hygroreceptors, chemoreceptors, photoreceptors) or effectors (glands, fat body,
muscles) or both.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: The term nerve can only be
applied to metazoans, in which a condensed nervous
structure (e.g., ➞ganglion, ➞brain) can be distinguished
from more peripheral elements (in accordance with [18];
Figure 9). Typically, nerves are free of cell somata and are
composed of axons: either the axons from receptor cells
that are extended towards the centre (afferents) or the
axons of motoneurons that target the periphery (efferents; [18]; Figure 14). In the arthropod literature, a nerve
entering the central nervous system is sometimes called a
➞tract. The term nerve as defined here is much more
restricted than it is generally used in invertebrate neuroanatomical description and needs in particular to be distinguished from the more general term neurite bundle.
{20} Nerve cord

A nerve cord is a cluster of ➞neurons. It is the most
prominent longitudinally extending condensed part of a
➞nervous system.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: In animals with an anteroposterior axis, a single prominent longitudinal ➞neurite
bundle, or a pair thereof, is often positioned dorsally or
ventrally and extends longitudinally throughout the
body. Such bundles are traditionally termed nerve cords
and are important factors in concepts dividing Bilateria
into animals with a ventral nerve cord (gastroneuralians) and those with a dorsal nerve cord (notoneuralians). Our definition of the nerve cord also works in
relation to other longitudinal neurite bundles: only the
most prominent of these bundles is called the nerve

cord. A ventral nerve cord can be either paired or
unpaired, and can be a ➞medullary cord or contain
➞ganglia.
{21} Nervous system

A nervous system is a cluster of ➞neurons. It comprises all neurons of an organism and may include additional ➞glial cells. It may also include accessory cells,
which, for example, serve as supportive structures, stimulus guiding structures, or protective structures.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: The defining character of a
nervous system is the presence of cells recognizable as
neurons. A related term is nervous tissue. Several specialized macromolecules such as receptors or ion
pumps or components such as vesicle molecules or
enzymes involved in transmitter metabolism that are
present in neurons have been detected in sponges but a
morphologically discernable nervous system is not present (e.g., [176]; compare with ➞neuron). In many

Page 19 of 49

cases, a distinction is made between the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system
(PNS). The CNS, according to Bullock and Horridge
[18], is “... that part of the nervous system which forms
a distinct principal concentration of cords or ➞ganglia
....” According to this definition, the grade of condensation of ➞neurites into ➞neurite bundles is the distinguishing feature of a CNS. Additionally, the term CNS
implies a reference to the proximo-distal axis that
defines the centre and periphery of an organism. Both
definitions are problematic because strong neurite bundles can either occur intraepithelially (and therefore in
the periphery of the organism) or subepithelially. Moreover, less dense neurite bundles may occur in the central part of an organism. The range of the degree of
condensation, i.e., the diameter of a neurite bundle, is
continuous, which sometimes makes it impossible to
decide whether a neurite bundle should be considered
CNS or PNS. In chordates, the term central nervous system is commonly used for the ➞neural tube (Figure
3B). The distinction between a CNS and a PNS is
usually thought to be characteristic of bilaterian animals,
but the detection of condensed parts in the nervous system of cnidarians, especially medusae, poses additional
problems when the grade of condensation is the only
aspect taken into account. In this sense it is logical that
such structures in medusae should be termed/allocated
to the CNS (e.g., [43]). We suggest avoiding the terms
CNS and PNS and characterizing a neurite bundle by
(a) its size and (b) its location within the organism.
{22} Neural tube

A neural tube is a ➞nerve cord. It is part of a ➞nervous system. It has a tubular structure and contains a
central fluid-filled canal, the neural canal.
Discouraged terms: nerve tube
Background/comment: During development, the
neural tube originates via a morphogenetic process in
which a portion of the aboral epithelium becomes internalized (e.g., [137]). This process is called neurulation.
The internalized ectodermal tissue differentiates into
nervous tissue that forms the neural tube. The details
of the internalization process may differ [177-179], with
possible scenarios ranging from (i) the invagination of a
longitudinal area of epithelium (Figure 15A, D: Tunicata, Amphibia), (ii) a sinking in of a neural plate that is
overgrown by lateral extensions of the epidermis (Figure
15B, C: Cephalochordata, Enteropneusta), to (iii) the
ingrowth of a compact longitudinal strand of the dorsal
epidermis underneath the extracellular material (Teleostei). The result is always a neural tube that lies beneath
the epidermis and is therefore surrounded by an extracellular matrix (Figure 3B). The neural tube contains a
fluid-filled hollow central canal termed the neural canal

which is lined by ciliated cells. In a throwback to its
ontogenetic origin, the neural canal connects to the outside at the anterior end through the ‘neuropore’. In
Chordata, the neural canal contains a mucous strand,
‘Reissner’s fibre’, which originates from distinct anterior
infundibular cells. Furthermore, in addition to the anterior neuropore, the posterior end of the neural canal
connects via the ‘neurenteric canal’ (Canalis neurentericus) to the intestinal tract [180]. The centralized part of
the chordate nervous system can often be divided into
two parts. The anterior part, the ➞brain, is characterized by its larger transversal and dorsoventral diameter
and/or a dilation of the central neural canal
[138,181,182]. It is thus distinguished from the narrower
and more uniform posterior part, the spinal cord (Craniota) or neural cord (Tunicata, Cephalochordata). In
Ascidiacea, the subepidermal brain (often called the dorsal ganglion, see ➞ganglion) is completely surrounded

by an extracellular matrix and is derived in part from
the anterior part of the larval neural tube. The more
posterior part of the larval neural tube, including the
visceral nucleus (see ➞ganglion) is reported to become
phagocytized [183]. In Thaliacea, the brain (often called
dorsal ganglion, see ➞ganglion) is also solid in adults
but undergoes a stage where a neural tube with a hollow
fluid-filled cavity and cilia is present [62].
{23} Neurite

A neurite is a cell process. It is part of a ➞neuron.
Neurites are divided into primary neurites, axons, and
dendrites.
Discouraged terms: nerve fiber, Nervenfaser, axis
cylinder, nerve
Background/comment: Traditionally, the term
‘neurite’ has been used for “the main or longest process of a nerve cell” [18] or, mostly in vertebrates, as a

Richter et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:29
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/7/1/29

synonym to ‘axon’ [18,184]. In insects, the term ‘neurite’ is often used to denote the single main process of
unipolar neurons that connects the soma and the
integrative part consisting of dendrites and axons
[185]. Because of the ambiguity of the term and
because in many invertebrates it is difficult to distinguish axons and dendrites on the basis of histological
criteria and in the absence of electrophysiological data,
Bullock and Horridge [18] rightly suggested that the
term needs to be rejuvenated. We therefore suggest
that all cell processes of neurons collectively be
referred to ‘neurites’, a practice that has already been
adopted in some studies of invertebrate ➞nervous systems (e.g., [186,187]). The single main process emerging from the soma of unipolar neurons and
connecting them to dendrites and axons is then called
‘primary neurite’. Dendrites are those neurites of a
neuron that receive stimuli/input. They may house
postsynaptic components to allow them to receive axonal input from other neurons. Axons are those neurites
of a neuron which house presynaptic components and
which target the dendrites of other neurons or peripheral organs such as muscles, glands or fat bodies. We
are convinced that this rejuvenated, clear terminology
will encourage uniformity in the description of invertebrate nervous systems. It will also help solve conflicts
such as those surrounding the ➞plexus of cnidarian
nervous systems, the same elements of which have
been referred to as “nerve fibres” [18,186], “processes”
[188] and “neurites” [186,189,190].
{24} Neurite bundle

A neurite bundle is a cluster of ➞neurites. It is part of
the ➞nervous system. The neurites are arranged in parallel to form a bundle.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Neurites can occur as single
neurites or in neurite bundles. Neurite bundles are composed of a variable number of neurites. Traditionally, very
thick neurite bundles are often termed the ➞nerve cord.
{25} Neuroactive substance

A neuroactive substance is a molecule. It is part of the
➞nervous system. It is diffusible and influences the
physiological state of ➞neurons by interacting with a
competent receptor.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Neuroactive substances either
influence the electrophysiological state of a neuron
directly via synaptic interactions (neurotransmission) or
modify the response of neurons to external stimulation
(neuromodulation). Neuroactive substances are classified
according to their molecular structure [191,192]:

Page 21 of 49

i) amino acids and their derivatives, which are
known as biogenic amines (e.g., serotonin,
histamine)
ii) neuropeptides (e.g., FMRFamide, allatostatin,
tachykinin)
iii) gaseous molecules (e.g., nitric oxide, carbon
monoxide)
A large number of putative neuroactive substances
have been identified in the ➞nervous system of invertebrates (Annelida: [193]; Insecta: [191]; Cnidaria: [194];
Nematoda: [195]; Mollusca: [196,197]. In anatomical
studies, neuroactive substances are usually identified on
the basis of immunocytochemical investigations (e.g, see
Figure 3 and Figure 16), without support from physiological and pharmacological studies. Immunocytochemistry cannot be taken as proof of the presence and
physiological effect of a neuroactive substance, however.
This is especially true if antibodies target epitopes such
as RFamides which are shared by various members of a
family of neuroactive molecules. Accordingly, neurons
showing an immunopositive response to anti-FMRFamide should not be termed ‘FMRFamidergic’ but
‘FMRFamide-like immunoreactive’. The localization of
neuroactive substances that are present over a wide
taxonomic range has frequently been the subject of
comparative neuroanatomical studies (tachykinin: [64];
serotonin: [198]; FMRFamide: [199]; histamine: [200]).
{26} Neuroblast

A neuroblast is a ➞neuronal precursor. It is part of a
developing ➞nervous system. It is comparably large
and acts as a stem cell. It divides asymmetrically and
preferentially in one direction only, giving rise to smaller
cells, the ➞ganglion mother cells.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: The term neuroblast is often
applied to neuronal precursors in general. Here, a strict
definition restricted to large specialized stem cells is
preferred. To date, neuroblasts have been found in
representatives of Insecta and Malacostraca (Figure 17;
e.g., [139-141,201-208]). In malacostracan crustaceans
and insects it has been possible to identify and homologize individual neuroblasts with regard to their origin,
gene expression and the lineage which give rise to
➞pioneer neurons [139,140,142,209]. The situation in
non-malacostracan crustaceans is somewhat ambiguous.
Preliminary descriptions of the possible occurrence of
neuroblasts still await confirmation [210-212].
The neuroblasts of Insecta differentiate after immigration from the ventral ectoderm (Figure 17A; [204])
whereas those of Malacostraca remain in the embryonic
surface cell layer (Figure 17B; [141,213,214]. In addition

to the neuroblasts involved in the formation of the ventral ➞ganglia of the trunk, a corresponding cell type
has been detected in the ➞brain area of insects and
malacostracan crustaceans [215,216]. However, in contrast to the neuroblasts of the forming trunk ganglia,

brain neuroblasts do not bud their progeny into the
inner part of the embryo but tangentially to the surface.
In malacostracans, some neuroblasts have been
described as dividing equally after producing several
ganglion mother cells by unequal cleavage [217].

Figure 17 Schematic representation of segmental neuroblasts and their progeny in insects and malacostracan crustaceans in cross
section. A. In insects, the neuroblasts detach from the ventral embryonic ectodermal layer and migrate into the interior of the embryo in dorsal
direction. After this process they produce the ganglion mother cells which in turn divide to form ganglion cells (i.e., neurons or glia). B. In
malacostracan crustaceans, the neuroblasts remain in the ectoderm, but the production of ganglion mother cells and ganglion cells shows the
same pattern as in insects. Abbreviations: e = ectoderm; gac = ganglion cells; gmc = ganglion mother cells; nb = neuroblast. Modified from
[142], with permission of the Royal Society in London.

In other words, during equal divisions neuroblasts do
not act as neuroblasts in a proper sense, though neuroblastic activity is continued afterwards. Nothing comparable has yet been observed in insects.
{27} Neuromere

A neuromere is a cluster of ➞cells. It is part of a developing ➞nervous system. It consists of all the developing nervous tissue that is part of one of the several
anterior-posterior repetitive units of the nervous system.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: This term has its origin in
developmental biology (e.g., [218]) and is herein
restricted to embryos and larvae. In many arthropods,
the soma-free ➞connectives between the ➞ganglia
develop later on, whereas the embryonic segmental units
of the nervous system - the neuromeres (Figure 18) adjoin each other. In Arthropoda, molecular geneticists
prefer to define body segments e.g., on the basis of the

Page 23 of 49

expression of the segment polarity gene engrailed in
transverse stripes of the posterior portion of forming segments [207,219]. If no engrailed data are available, however, body segments are generally identified by
morphologists on the basis of their external morphology,
i.e., the anlagen of the limb rows or the trunk segments.
The term neuromere refers to segments identified in
both ways.
{28} Neuron

A neuron is a cell. It is part of the ➞nervous system
and consists of a soma that gives rise to ➞neurites,
which conduct electric excitation in a directed way. A
neuron communicates with other cells via ➞synapses.
Most neurons synthesize and secrete ➞neuroactive
substances.
Discouraged terms: nerve cell
Background/comment: It is hard to find exclusive
morphological or physiological criteria to define a

nervous tissue that is part of one anterior-posterior repetitive unit of the nervous system, e.g., as marked here, thorax segment 1. Larval stage 3

neuron because features such as excitability, cell processes and the secretion of substances are also shared by
other cell types such as gland cells and muscle cells.
What defines a neuron is a combination of these features [18,220]. One important function of neurons is the
directed conduction of excitation (reviews [221-223]).
Historic aspects of the physiological neuron concept
have recently been reviewed by Barbara [221]. The neuronal cell body is called the soma (synonym perikaryon). Neurons that only give off one neurite are called

Page 24 of 49

unipolar neurons (Figure 19A). This primary neurite
connects the soma to the dendrites and axons. Bipolar
neurons separately give rise to one axon and one primary dendrite (Figure 19B). In a pseudounipolar neuron, the primary neurite splits into an axon and a
dendrite shortly after it exits the soma (Figure 19C). In
multipolar neurons, one axon and/or many dendrites
branch directly off the soma (Figure 19D, E, F). Neurons
that target other neurons are called interneurons.
Intrinsic neurons are interneurons whose neurites are

confined to specific ➞neuropils. Extrinsic neurons are
interneurons that connect different neuropils. Neurons
that target muscles are called motoneurons. Neurons
are present in Ctenophora and Cnidaria (although it is
currently disputed whether or not neurons may have
evolved independently in these two taxa) and all other
Eumetazoa [220]. Some sponge cell types share some of
the molecular and physiological characteristics of neurons but do not entirely fulfil the criteria for neurons as
defined here (discussed in [223-226]). The evolutionary
emergence of neurons is a hotly debated topic (recent
reviews e.g., [220,223,227]), and Figure 20 features two
current hypotheses on this issue.
Neurons that can be individually recognized from animal to animal in one species or even in the animals of different species are called individually identifiable
neurons (Figure 5, 16; [228]). These may be serially
arranged (i.e., iterated along the anterior-posterior axis)
and resemble iterated “clones” (Figure 16). Many of the
recent studies on this topic rely on the foundations laid by
Kutsch and Breidbach [229]. These authors presented a
catalogue of features that can be used to examine the cellular characteristics of individually identifiable neurons in
order to explore whether they are homologous between
different arthropod taxa. The authors distinguish between
interspecific homology (comparison of neurons between
the animals of different species) and serial homology
(repetitive, equivalent neurons in the different segmental
➞ganglia of the animals of one species; Figure 16). Within
Protostomia, individually identifiable neurons have been
shown to be present in the ➞nervous system of Arthropoda [185,228,230], Annelida [52,56,231-234], Nemathelminthes/Cycloneuralia [235,236], Mollusca [237,238],
Platyhelminthes [239-241] and Gnathifera [242]. The presence of at least some individually identifiable neurons in
Deuterostomia such as Tunicata [243-247] and Cephalochordata [248] indicates that the potential to establish
individual identities may not only be present in the ground
pattern of Protostomia. Serially arranged individually identifiable neurons are not only found in typically segmented
Protostomia such as Annelida (including Echiurida) and
Arthropoda, but also in unsegmented organisms such as
representatives of Nematoda [236], Platyhelminthes
[239-241], Chaetognatha [144], Sipuncula [249,250] and
Priapulida [127] and in basal Mollusca [237,238].
{29} Neuronal precursor

A neuronal precursor is a cell. It is part of a developing
➞nervous system. It produces either further neuronal
precursors or ➞neurons or ➞glial cells.
Discouraged terms: neuronal progenitor
Background/comment: Most neuronal precursors
cannot be identified on the basis of morphological characteristics. The notable exception is the ➞neuroblast,

Page 25 of 49

which is relatively large and divides asymmetrically
(Figure 17). The term neuronal precursor as defined here
excludes cells that directly transform into neurons or glia
cells without further mitosis. This, for instance, is the
case for the immigrating cells of various chelicerate
embryos, which directly assume a neuronal appearance
once they become detached from the embryonic ectoderm [251]. According to their position in the embryo,
neuronal precursors can be designated more specifically,
e.g., ‘median precursor’ in the Drosophila embryonic
midline [252].
{30} Neuropil

A neuropil is a cluster of ➞neurites. It is part of a
➞nervous system and forms a network of dendrites
and axons where ➞synapses are present and in which
neuronal somata do not occur.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Because of the synaptic interactions which take place in it, a neuropil is the principal
region of integrative processing events [18]. The neuronal somata of the interneurons that extend their neurites into the neuropil are located outside the neuropil
and may surround it in a cell cortex (Figure 21). However, ➞glial cell somata, ➞tracts, blood vessels and tracheae may be embedded within a neuropil. A neuropil
can be further compartmentalized, e.g., by glial boundaries. The resulting partitions are also termed neuropils
and may have been given specific names such as ➞central body (Figure 4) or ➞olfactory glomeruli (see compartments within olfactory lobe in Figure 11, antennal
lobe in Figure 22).
{31} Olfactory glomerulus

An olfactory glomerulus is a ➞neuropil. It is part of a
➞nervous system. An olfactory glomerulus is a clearly
demarcated, dense neuropil in which olfactory receptor
➞neurons terminate and form the first ➞synapses of
the olfactory pathway.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Olfactory glomeruli occur in
many metazoan taxa. They provide a means for the spatial representation of chemosensory information
(reviewed by [253]). Olfactory glomeruli are usually
arranged in clusters (Figure 11, 22). Despite architectural similarities between different taxa, olfactory glomeruli are not necessarily located in comparable
positions in the ➞nervous system. The olfactory glomeruli of Tetraconata are located in the deutocerebrum, for example, while in Onychophora they are
situated in the protocerebrum and in Chelicerata they
occur in the ➞ganglion of whichever segment bears an
appendage equipped with odour receptors [42]. Olfactory glomeruli have been described in representatives of

Protoneurons evolve, conveying excitation from the exterior to the myocytes. (4) Neurosensory cells and neurons evolve, which make use of
action potentials. They are connected to one another and to the myocytes by chemically transmitting, polarized junctions. Electrical coupling
persists in many epithelia and muscles. B. Paracrine-to-electrochemical-dominance transition hypothesis (modified from [331,332]) (1) Paracrine
signaling in unicellular eukaryotes with signals of the first or second order. (2) Hypothetical intracorporeal paracrine signaling in early metazoans
with cascaded paracrine signals: first-order signals originate from externally stimulated epithelial cells; these signals stimulate mesenchymal cells,
which release second-order paracrine signals that might be the same substance (positive feedback) or another messenger (integration). (3) New
cell types evolve, with the trophic effects of paracrine messengers leading to prolonged multipolar cells. Eventually, action potentials are present
and secretion of messengers is compartmentalized within peripheral parts of the cells. (4) Polarized and compartmentalized cells evolve into
neurosensory cells and neurons, with further concentration of messenger secretion into peripheral synapse structures and AP traveling over long
distances (paracrine-to-electrochemical-dominance transition). Abbreviations: ap = action potential; ec = electrical coupling; 1st = primary

An ommatidium is an ➞eye. It is the smallest morphological and functional unit of the ➞compound eye and

Page 27 of 49

consists of a usually limited and often constant number
of rhabdomeric ➞photoreceptor cells, cornea-secreting epithelial cells, and interommatidial pigment
cells, and may additionally contain crystalline cone
cells.

taxa with compound eyes as defined herein. These
include the lateral eyes that are often not considered to
be compound eyes but to be derived from them found,
for example, in Collembola, Zygentoma (e.g., [88]) and
Lithobiomorpha (e.g., [90]). The exact components of an
ommatidium differ in Xiphosura, Scutigeromorpha and
Tetraconata (those representatives of the Tetraconata in
which ommatidia are present) (see Figure 23, 24). However, an ommatidium always consists of rhabdomeric
photoreceptor cells (retinula(r) cells), cornea-secreting
epithelial cells (e.g., corneageneous cells, see Figure 23)
and interommatidial pigment cells. In most mandibulate
taxa, crystalline cone-secreting cells are present. In Scutigeromorpha and Hexapoda, the cornea-secreting
epithelial cells also contain pigments and are therefore
called primary pigment cells. There are up to ten of
these cells in Scutigeromorpha and two in Hexapoda

(e.g., [77,86]). In most Crustacea, two corneageneous
cells which do not contain pigment granula produce the
cornea, which is a purely cuticular structure. In Branchiura and Cirripedia, two pigment-bearing cells are
present in the position of the corneageneous cells of
other crustaceans. The exact homology relationships
between these cells and corneageneous cells and/or primary pigment cells remain unclear because in Ostracoda, two corneageneous cells are present in addition to
the aforementioned pigment cells (see the discussion in
[85]). Interommatidial pigment cells are present in mandibulate and xiphosuran compound eyes. It has been
suggested that they are homologous within Mandibulata,
but their homology has been questioned between mandibulates and xiphosurans [77]. Additional types of pigment cell might be present (e.g., [258]). A central
component of ommatidia in mandibulates is the crystalline cone, which forms as an intracellular secretion product. Functionally, the crystalline cone is part of a
dioptric apparatus (together with the cornea) that is
used for light refraction or reflection. The crystalline
cone is made up of four cells in most hexapods, in scutigeromorphs and in many crustacean taxa. However,
cones made up of two, three or five cone cells are also
present in certain crustacean taxa (Figure 24; see

[84,85]). In Xiphosura, a crystalline cone is absent. The
retinula cells form a rhabdom which in most cases is
fused but which might also be open (e.g., [86]). The
rhabdom might be a one-layer structure (e.g., in Branchiura, Ostracoda, Anostraca), a two-layer structure
(e.g., in Scutigeromorpha) or a multiple-layer structure
(Malacostraca, Archaeognatha; see [77] for original
references), and is termed simple, bilayered or banded
rhabdom, accordingly. The number of retinula cells varies (up to 22 in certain beetles: [259]) but eight are
often found in hexapods and crustaceans and this number is considered to be a ground pattern character of
Tetraconata.
The subunits of the eyes of other invertebrates differ
from those of arthropods [91-93]. In sabellid polychates,
for instance, each subunit consists of a single ciliary
photoreceptor cell [93,260,261]. Lenses are formed
either by an additional cell or by the cuticle lying in a
follicle-shaped depression. The photoreceptor cells do
not contain shading pigment, which is located in the
pigment cells separating the individual subunits.

character of Bilateria. Many years later, Reisinger [263]
concluded that the orthogon can be regarded as an
ancestral character of the Spiralia. By stating that the nervous systems in Deuterostomia cannot be derived from
an orthogon, he implicitly called into question Hanström’s [54] hypothesis that the orthogon was a character
of the bilaterian ancestor. Orthogonal arrangements of
longitudinal neurite bundles connected by transverse
bundles are abundant among protostome taxa (see, e.g.,
[222] for a summary). They can differ, however, in several
aspects. The number of longitudinal and circular elements can differ considerably, and the thickness of the
longitudinal bundles can vary. The transverse neurite
bundles often only connect the longitudinal bundles ventrally. For the purposes of the definition it is appropriate
to impose a minimum requirement that all the longitudinal neurite bundles present are connected over the ventral midline by transverse elements which must be
serially arranged, but the minimum number of the latter
is never stated. As the minimum requirement for seriality
is two, two transverse bundles may be regarded as the
minimal complement of an orthogon.

{33} Orthogon

An orthogon is a cluster of ➞neurons. It is part of a
➞nervous system and consists of at least two pairs of
longitudinal ➞neurite bundles, which are connected at
regular intervals by transverse neurite bundles running
at right angles to them (i.e., orthogonally). The transverse bundles may form a closed circle (circular bundles
or ring commissures), or at least connect all the longitudinal bundles present. The thickness of the longitudinal neurite bundles can vary, usually with the ventral
one being thicker than the others. An orthogon is not
differentiated into ➞ganglia linked by ➞connectives.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: The term orthogon (Figure
25) was introduced by Reisinger [262] in relation to the
architecture of the ➞nervous system in the flatworm
Bothrioplana semperi (Bothrioplanida, Seriata, Platyhelminthes), which is composed of four pairs of longitudinal
neurite bundles and numerous circular neurite bundles
(ring commissures) in a serial arrangement. Reisinger
[262] noted: “In summary, we conclude that the nervous
system of Turbellaria and consequently that of all Platyhelminthes can be deduced from a simple, geometrical
ground pattern, a netlike, right-angled plexus, the orthogon.” (p. 146, translated from German). This concept was
soon popularized by Hanström [54], who argued that an
orthogon of this nature played a key role in nervous system evolution, in particular in the transition from a
➞plexus as present in diploblastic animals to the concentrated nervous system in Bilateria (Figure 18). Without using these words, Hanström thus proceeded on the
assumption that the orthogon was a ground pattern

{34} Photoreceptor cell

A photoreceptor cell is a ➞receptor cell. It is part of a
➞sensory organ. It contains photosensitive pigments.
The adequate stimulus is light.
Discouraged terms: photoreceptor, photosensitive cell
Background/comment: In the literature, the term
photoreceptor is not used unambiguously and may refer
to a number of different structures [103,222]. Photoreceptor cells exhibit great structural variability but as a
basic principle, the photopigment-bearing structures or
organelles are part of the apical plasma membrane
domain, the surface of which is typically found to be
enlarged in order to provide more space to accommodate
the photosensitive pigment (Figure 7, 8, 26B). According
to the type of photopigment-bearing structure, a general
distinction is made between ciliary and rhabdomeric
photoreceptor cells. A ciliary photoreceptor cell (Figure
26B) uses ciliary membranes to house the photosensitive
pigment. The photosensitive surface area may be optimised by cilia equipped with numerous branches (which
may be similar to microvilli in appearance; Figure 26B)
or by a high number of cilia per cell. It is well known that
ciliary photoreceptor cells occur in vertebrates, but they
are present in numerous invertebrates as well, though
not usually associated with pigment cells in this case
and thus frequently described as photoreceptor-like
structures. Experimental evidence of photoreception in
photoreceptor-like structures has only been presented for
Platynereis dumerilii [124] so far. In a rhabdomeric
photoreceptor cell (Figure 26A), the light sensitive parts
are represented by microvilli which are often highly

ordered and densely packed. A cilium, or vestiges thereof,
are often present and may project into the ocellar cavity
among the phalanx of sensory microvilli. The function of
such accessory cilium is unknown [95]. The light-sensitive molecules associated with the membranes of the cilia
and microvilli are rhodopsins formed by the carotinoid
retinal and the protein opsin. Opsins diversified into different types very early in metazoan evolution, leading to
opsin families. A number of different ciliary and rhabdomeric opsins are recognized today [104,106,107,
122,124,264,265]. Each forms a distinct family, which
indicates that ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor
cells differentiated very early in metazoan evolution. The
split most likely occurred at the base of Bilateria. In most
cases, photoreceptor cells are devoid of shading pigment,
which is housed in pigmented supportive cells. However, there are several examples of photoreceptor cells
containing shading pigment (see above ➞eyes).

Irrespective of receptor cell type, the photopigmentbearing structures typically project into an extracellular
space which is either formed by the receptor cells alone
or by ➞receptor cells, supportive cells and cornea
cells [94,95,106,107]. In typical invertebrate eyes, the
photoreceptor cells are part of an epithelium called the
retina and are attached to their neighbours by typical
junctional complexes: a zonula adhaerens followed by a
septate junction. Well-known are the photoreceptor
cells which occur in pigmented eyes, though extraocular photoreceptors, also known as unpigmented ocelli,
which are not situated within an eye, are also widely distributed among invertebrates. Usually, individuals of a
single species bear more than one type of photoreceptive structure which, as a rule, employ different types of
receptor cell. Extraocular photoreceptor units are
usually small and rarely comprise more than two cells: a
photoreceptor cell and an unpigmented supportive cell

(Figure 26A, B). due to the fact that Because they are
hard to find in larger animals, requiring electron microscopy and serial sectioning to detect them, our knowledge of these structures is patchy. Unpigmented eyes
may thus erroneously have been described as phaosomes
in the past (see below) and, as a consequence, data from
the literature must be treated with care.
A phaosome is a third type of photoreceptor cell that is
not associated with supportive cells. The photoreceptive
processes are housed in a seemingly intracellular vacuole,
the phaosome, which arises through the invagination and
closure of the apical cell membrane (Figure 26C, D). With
exception of clitellate annelids, where they are widely distributed and form the only photoreceptor cell present
[95,266], phaosomes only occur sporadically in metazoans.
They are usually extraocular and occur in various places,
though leeches and certain naidid oligochaetes possess
phaosomal eyes [266]. Both microvilli and cilia may be
present. The terms ‘phaosome’ and ‘extraocular photoreceptor’ have often been used interchangeably due to an
incorrect application of the definition or the unrecognized
presence of a supportive cell. Formerly regarded as a primitive type of photoreceptor cell [267,268], the evidence is
increasing that they may actually be highly derived structures which, at least in clitellate annelids, most likely
evolved from rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells ([95], Döring et al. unpublished observation). All phaosomous
photoreceptor cells may thus turn out to be a subtype of
one of the two receptor cells mentioned above.
{35} Pioneer neuron

A pioneer neuron is a ➞neuron. It is part of a developing ➞nervous system. It appears early in development,
often exists transiently, and is involved in setting up the
scaffold of the developing nervous system. The ➞neurites of the pioneer neurons serve as pathways for the
neurites of neurons, which develop later.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: The function of pioneer neurons has been described in Hexapoda [269-271]. They
occur in a specific pattern which finds a correspondence
in malacostracan crustaceans (Figure 27; [142,272-274]),
but not in Myriapoda [275]. Nothing is known in this
respect about other arthropods. If ➞neuroblasts are
present, pioneer neurons are formed by the first
➞ganglion mother cells budded off by a number of
neuroblasts (Figure 17).

Page 32 of 49

Discouraged terms: epithelial nervous system, diffuse
nervous system, nerve net
Background/comment: The entire ➞nervous system
of an animal may be organized as a plexus, as may a specific part thereof (Figure 28). A plexus may or may not
contain loosely distributed somata of interneurons and
motoneurons which may be uni-, bi- or multipolar
(Figure 19). It may or may not contain ➞receptor cells.
It may or may not exhibit ➞synapses between the receptor cells, motoneurons and interneurons. The plexus is
organised in a visibly different way than the ➞orthogon
(Figure 25). A plexus is often associated with an epithelium. The term epidermal plexus indicates that an
epithelial nervous system is located in the epidermis,
whereas gastrodermal plexus is associated with the gastrodermis. The spatial relationship between the plexus
and the epithelium can be qualified further (Figure 29):
In an intraepidermal plexus, the neurites are located
between the epidermal cells. A basiepidermal plexus is
a specific subtype of intraepidermal plexus in which the
neurites are located between the basal regions of epidermal cells and may have contact with the ECM/basal
lamina underlying the epidermis. A subepidermal
plexus is located below the ECM/basal lamina. The same
distinctions can be made for a gastrodermal plexus.
An intraepidermal plexus may function as a nerve
net. In an intraepidermal plexus, dispersed neurons are
connected either by synaptic contact or fusion in such a
way as to permit the diffuse conduction of excitation
[18]. The term nerve net thus implies a functionally
semiautonomous plexus that mediates responses (sensory-motor integration) and must therefore include
receptor cells, interneurons and motoneurons that communicate, e.g., via chemical synapses or electrical
synapses. The nervous system of Cnidaria and Ctenophora is typically organized as a plexus which functions
as a nerve net [18,190,220,276,277]. An intraepidermal
plexus is also a prominent feature of many basal deuterostomes [248,278,279]. It is present in Enteropneusta
and Tunicata, and in the basal chordate Branchiostoma,
among other taxa. An extensive intraepidermal plexus
also characterizes many Protostomia [276], including
Annelida [52,56]. Onychophora have recently been
shown to have a prominent subepidermal plexus of serotonin-like immunoreactive neurites or neurite bundles
[163] which is not obvious in Euarthropoda. Serotoninlike immunoreactive somata are not present in the onychophoran subepidermal plexus.

{36} Plexus

A plexus is a cluster of ➞neurons. It is part of a ➞nervous system and consists of ➞neurites or ➞neurite
bundles that are arranged in a planar reticular pattern.
The somata of the ➞neurons are considered to be part
of the plexus.

{37} Protocerebral bridge

The protocerebral bridge is a ➞neuropil. It is part of
the ➞central complex. Within the protocerebral bridge,
➞neurites of columnar ➞neurons form their first collaterals before entering the ➞central body. The somata

Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: The protocerebral bridge can
occur as an ➞unpaired midline neuropil (most
Insecta, Figure 4A, B) or be split at the midline of the

➞brain (e.g., in the malacostracan Spelaeogriphus lepidops, Figure 4C). Comparative anatomical studies and
behavioural observations on no-bridge Drosophila
mutants suggest that the protocerebral bridge plays a
vital role in coordinating heterolaterally independent leg
movements [64,74,280].

{38} Receptor cell

A receptor cell is a ➞neuron. It is part of the ➞nervous system. In a signal transduction chain, it is the
first neuron that converts an adequate stimulus into an
electric signal.
Discouraged terms: sensory neuron, sensory cell,
receptor
Background/comment: The term receptor is used in
different ways and may apply to a ➞sensory organ, a
receptor cell, the morphological structure of a cell that
receives stimulus, or the membrane-bound protein
responsible for the first step of signal transduction.
There are several types of receptor cell in metazoans.
Receptor cells are usually bipolar cells, the distal process of which is usually part of an epithelium, mostly
the epidermis. Irrespective the position of their somata,
their dendritic processes bear either cilia and/or microvilli which actually house the proteins responsible for
receiving the stimuli. Ciliary receptor cells are the most
common and are likely to be involved in almost every
kind of sensory perception. Bipolar receptor cells whose
somata are located within the epidermis have a short

dendritic process and are thus mostly bottle-shaped, giving rise to the name flask-shaped receptor cells (see,
for example, [113]). Another type of receptor cell is the
free nerve ending, which ramifies in the periphery and
terminates distally as a typical dendrite similar to those
of uni- or bipolar neurons ([18,222]; Figure 19A, B).
They may be connected to sensory epithelial cells (secondary sensory cells, non-neuronal sensory cells).
Although primarily known to occur in Vertebrata, in the
acousticolateralis system for instance, secondary cells
are thought to be present in cnidarians too and may
thus be phylogenetically old structures (see [222]).
Receptor cells may occur as unicellular elements, in
clusters or as sensory organs of varying degrees of complexity comprising receptor cells and various accessory
cells.
There is a great structural variety among the bipolar
receptor cells with regard to the size and position of
their distal processes, their somata and their axons. The
same applies to the number and structure of cilia and
microvilli, which may be uni- or multiciliated and their
axonemes often modified (e.g., [94]). In arthropods and

Figure 29 Terminology of the plexus depending on its relationship to an epithelium.

Richter et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:29
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/7/1/29

other ecdysozoans, the bipolar receptor cells are connected to specialized cuticular differentiations
[222,281-283]. The collar receptor cell is often
regarded as the most primitive receptor cell type. It
occurs in almost every aquatic invertebrate taxon and
might have evolved already in early eumetazoans (see
[222,284], but see [285]). Its structure somewhat resembles that of the choanocytes of sponges: it is characterized by a stiff cilium and a collar of eight to ten strong
microvilli, with eight regarded as the plesiomorphic
number [222].
With regard to function, a distinction can be made
between mechanoreception, chemoreception, photoreception, thermoreception, hygroreception, electroreception and magnetoreception. Within invertebrates,
arthropods are the best studied group and the function
of their receptor cells is often resolved, whereas in many
other invertebrate taxa direct experimental evidence is
still lacking. As a rule, receptor cells exhibit a distinct
morphology which is believed to be correlated to their
function. ➞Photoreceptor cells, for example, are characterized by a significantly larger apical membrane surface, the area which houses the light-sensitive
photopigments. This improves photon detection and
thus increases sensitivity. Because, in many invertebrates, experimental evidence for the function of a given
receptor cell is lacking, function is generally inferred
from the fine structure of the cell in question and of the
associated stimulus-guiding structures.
{39} Rope-ladder-like nervous system

A rope-ladder-like nervous system is a ➞nerve cord. It
is part of a ➞nervous system and consists of a series of
➞ganglia joined by ➞commissures and ➞connectives.
The ganglia are arranged in an anterior-posterior
sequence. The bilaterally arranged pairs of ganglia are
transversally joined by at least one commissure. Longitudinally, the ganglia are joined by exactly one connective per side. Segmental ➞nerves exit the rope-ladderlike nervous system.
Discouraged terms: ladder-like nervous system
Background/comment: The terms rope-ladder-like
nervous system and ladder-like nervous system have
been traditionally used to describe the ventral part of
the ➞nervous system in Arthropoda and Annelida (Figure 9, 18). There are several representatives of both
taxa, which do not have a rope-ladder-like nervous system according to the definition above, including Onychophora (these do not have ganglia; [162]) and various
annelids, in particular oligochaetes [52].
The rope-ladder-like nervous system is embedded into
the remaining nervous system and can be complemented by additional elements such as longitudinal ➞neurite bundles. In polychaets, a ventral median neurite

Page 35 of 49

bundle is often present, for example [52]. The polychaete Dinophilus gyrociliatus (Dinophilidae) has a ropeladder-like nervous system, which is connected to
further longitudinal and ring-like neurite bundles, which
are arranged orthogonally [286]. This phenomenon is
widespread in annelids [52]. Interestingly enough, additional median and lateral neurite bundles and ring-like
structures are present in the crustacean Derocheilocaris
remanei (Mystacocarida; [73]).
{40} Sensory organ

A sensory organ is a cluster of ➞cells. It is part of a
➞nervous system and consists of receptor cells, which
form a multicellular unit that may include accessory
cells, which serve as supportive structures, stimulusguiding structures or protective structures.
Discouraged terms: sense organ
Background/comment: Sensory organs are those
structures, which perceive sensory stimuli and transform
them into electric signals recognizable by the ➞nervous
system or directly by the effector cells. Simple systems
in which the receptor cells are directly connected to
cells equipped with motile cilia are present in many
invertebrate larvae, for instance [113]. Simple sensory
organs may consist of nothing more than a cluster of
receptor cells, but as a rule, a sensory organ comprises
accessory cells, which serve as supportive structures, stimulus-guiding structures or protective structures for the
receptor cells. The result are complex structures which
often only admit sensory stimuli from a certain direction, thus conveying information not just about the nature of a stimulus, but also about its intensity and
direction [18,222]. For the modes of stimulus that are
generally distinguished, see ➞receptor cell.
With the exception of Porifera and Placozoa, sensory
organs of varying degrees of complexity occur in almost
every higher metazoan group. The most ubiquitously
distributed sensory organs are probably ➞eyes, while
systems such as statocysts, auditory organs and olfactory
organs appear to be restricted to more limited groups of
taxa. Even Cnidaria may possess highly developed sensory organs, as illustrated by the rhopalia observed in
scyphozoan and cubozoan medusae. These intricate sensory organs reach the highest level of complexity in
cubomedusae [284], where they consist of an (endodermal!) statocyst, two lens eyes and two simple eye pits,
all of which receive stimuli from different directions
(e.g., [114]). These sensory structures are associated
with conspicuous epidermal neuronal condensations at
the base of the rhopalia (see ➞brain).
{41} Synapse

A synapse is a cell-to-cell junction. It is part of the ➞nervous system and consists of pre- and postsynaptic

Richter et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:29
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/7/1/29

components. It is situated between a ➞neuron and
another cell (e.g., neuron, muscle cell, gland cell) and
mediates the transduction of an electric signal between
them.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: This term is discussed at
length by Bullock and Horridge [18] and we adhere to
their rather broad definition. These authors also discuss
functional concepts of the synapse and the historical
aspects of these concepts. In electrical synapses, current from the presynaptic membrane is sufficient to
excite the postsynaptic membrane. In chemical
synapses, the postsynaptic membrane is only excited by
➞neuroactive substances packed in vesicles that translocate from the pre- to the postsynaptic side across the
synaptic cleft. Chemical synapses thus represent a
derived form of paracrine signaling [223]. Most chemical
synapses only permit uni-directional information transfer. Invertebrates display a greater complexity of postsynaptic organization than vertebrates in that the
presynaptic release site approximates multiple postsynaptic elements to form dyad, triad or tetrad sites
[185,287]. The evolutionary origin of synapses and the
gradual acquisition of the molecular tool kit to form
synapses are not well understood but are the topic of
ongoing research using comparative proteomics and
genomics (e.g., [176,288]; review by [223]). Because
synapses can be viewed as highly specialized paracrine
information transmission systems which may have
evolved gradually and continuously [223], there is an
inherent problem in deciding what constitutes a synapse
in some taxa. Sponges, for example, which lack neurons
and, therefore, clearly recognizable synapses, nevertheless possess a nearly complete set of post-synaptic protein homologs which indicate that a remarkable level of
protein complexity was present at the origin of Metazoa,
possibly predating nervous systems [176].

A syncerebrum is a ➞brain. It is part of a ➞nervous
system. It is formed by the fusion or close association
of several ➞neuromeres.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: Interpretation of the
arthropod syncerebrum is very theory-laden, biased by
concepts combining ideas on phylogenetic relationships and the nature and origin of segments and segmentation with embryological and functional
considerations (see [13]). As a result, numerous contradictory hypotheses about head and brain composition in arthropods have been put forward and
continue to be formed (see [289-291] for summaries
and discussion of older views, and [292-294] for
recent discussion).

Page 36 of 49

The syncerebrum of arthropods is understood as being
the result of cephalization, i.e., the structural and functional transformation of segmental (postoral) trunk
➞ganglia, which are more or less fused to the preoral
ancestral brain. However, the structural characterization
of the subunits constituting the arthropod brain is
somewhat problematic, since neither in the adult brain
nor during development are unambiguous boundaries or
specific characteristics which would make it possible to
identify such subunits recognizable. The expression patterns of segment polarity genes (e.g., engrailed, wingless)
have been proven to be helpful in this respect because
they more or less resolve the number and spatial
arrangement of the morphological units involved in
head and brain formation (although this still leaves
room for interpretation concerning the evolutionary origin and genealogical relationships of these structures).
The euarthropod syncerebrum is now widely assumed
to be tripartite, consisting of a protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and tritocerebum. During development, the
anlagen of these subunits are aligned along the anteroposterior body axis and exhibit, at least transiently, a
specific circumesophageal arrangement (Crustacea:
[71,295]; Hexapoda: [296-300]; Xiphosura: [301,302];
Pycnogonida: [159]). However, during development, the
arrangement of the subunits of the brain in relation to
the body axis can be altered, resulting, for instance, in a
postero-dorsal protocerebrum [1]. Moreover, rearrangements and fusion processes often mean that the circumesophageal sequence of the subunits of the brain is
concealed in the adult brain. Each of the serially
arranged brain subunits can in itself be compartmentalized to some degree. This is particularly true of the
protocerebum and deutocerebum, which are often subdivided into a number of structurally and developmentally definable subparts formed by clusters of ➞neurons
and distinct ➞neuropil regions (e.g., [1,66,303]). Some
prominent examples of these are ➞unpaired midline
neuropils (Figure 4), ➞mushroom bodies (Figure 12)
and ➞olfactory glomeruli (Figure 22).
The protocerebrum receives input from the lateral
➞compound eyes and the ➞median eyes, if present (Figure 13). It contributes ➞neurites at least to the preoral
➞commissure(s) of the brain. Traditionally, the protocerebrum (or part of it, see below) is viewed as the brain part
of the non-segmental acron, which means that it corresponds to the ancestral brain of the Bilateria. In contrast
to this, the deuto- and tritocerebrum are mostly considered to be derived from the ganglia proper of true segments. Some authors favour a subdivision of the
protocerebrum into the archicerebrum and the prosocerebrum, with the latter being part of the first true segment,
the ‘pre-antennal segment’. According to this view, only
the archicerebrum belongs to the asegmental acron [290].

Richter et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:29
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/7/1/29

However, the concept of the acron is based on the view
that annelids and arthropods together form the taxon
Articulata. In the light of the current evidence in favour of
the Ecdysozoa, the acron concept becomes meaningless.
Accordingly, some authors interpret the protocerebrum as
being derived from a true ganglion of the anteriormost
segment (for a review see [292]).
The deutocerebum in myriapods, crustaceans and
hexapods is associated with the (first) antennae. It was
traditionally assumed that the antennae and the corresponding deutocerebrum are reduced in Chelicerata (e.g.,
[18,289-291,293]). On the basis of the expression of segmentation genes, Hox genes and neurogenetic data, however, the new view is that Chelicerata indeed possess a
deutocerebrum, and that it is connected to the chelicerae
([159,301,304,305]; see [292]). While the traditional textbook view suggests that the commissure of the deutocerebum is preoral, recent investigations have revealed a
more complicated scenario in which the deutocerebrum
encompasses the esophagus with contralaterally projecting anterior and posterior neurons (e.g., [300,301]).
The tritocerebrum is associated with the second
antennae in Crustacea and the pedipalps in Chelicerata.
Myriapods and hexapods lack appendages in this region,
which is referred to as the intercalary segment in these
taxa. The tritocerebrum arises from postoral ganglion
anlagen, which in the majority of cases migrate anteriorly during development. However, in adults, they are
subject to varying degrees of cephalization across the
different euarthropod groups. While they are clearly
fused to the proto- and deutocerebrum in many hexapods, myriapods and crustaceans [18,54,294], they
remain separate in a postoral position in some chelicerates and some crustaceans [18,54,70,293,306-308]. This
highlights a certain ambiguity with regard to the posterior boundary of the euarthropod syncerebrum. However,
even when the tritocerebral ganglia are postoral and/or
structurally similar to trunk ganglia, they nevertheless
connect to a cephalized appendage such as an antenna
and might thus be considered part of the brain. As a
general characteristic, the tritocerebral commissure(s)
are always postoral, irrespective of the position of the
tritocerebral ganglia (e.g., [18,293,294]).
In addition to the syncerebrum, a cephalisation of a
number of segments is observed in a variety of euarthropod groups, indicated by feeding or sensory appendages
and a fusion of ganglia (subesophageal ganglion). This
phenomenon renders the posterior brain boundary even
more problematic.
The brain of onychophorans is also considered to be a
morphologically composite structure [42,309]. Recent
neuroanatomical and gene expression data on onychophorans suggest that although it exhibits some

Page 37 of 49

segmental characteristics [42,310], the central nervous
system is not formed by a chain of metameric ganglia as
in euarthropods [162,163]. Mayer and Harzsch [162,163]
consider this absence of ganglia as the plesiomorphic
state within Arthropoda. If this is true, the brain of
Onychophora is formed by the fusion of non-ganglionized metameric neuroanatomical units and is thus not
a compound brain in the strict sense. Moreover, it
would suggest that the cephalization of segmental units
evolutionarily preceded the formation of proper ganglia
in the lineage leading to euarthropods. This could
explain the apparent absence of proper ganglia in the
euarthropod syncerebrum. Nevertheless, the composite
nature of the onychophoran brain qualifies it as a syncerebrum comparable to that in euarthropods. The onychophoran protocerebrum connects to the “antennae”
and the lateral eyes, the deutocerebrum is associated
with the jaws, and the postoral tritocerebum is the brain
part innervating the cephalized appendage of the slime
papilla.
The brain of Tardigrada is sometimes interpreted as
being tripartite (see [311]). However, not only is the evidence for this view ambiguous, but recent analyses rather
suggest that the brain consists of just one part, forming a
unit that would thus correspond to the protocerebrum in
Onychophora and Euarthropoda (see [311]).
{43} Tetraneurion

A tetraneurion is a cluster of ➞neurons. It is part of a
➞nervous system and consists of two prominent pairs
of longitudinal ➞neurite bundles: one inner, ventral
pair and one more dorsally situated lateral pair. It may
include ➞ganglia.
Discouraged terms: tetraneural nervous system
Background/comment: In the literature, the occurrence of one pair of ventral (pedal) and one pair of lateral (visceral) longitudinal neurite bundles in an
animal’s nervous system is generally known as tetraneury (Figure 30). The term tetraneurion refers to the
actual structure (i.e., the two pairs of neurite bundles),
while the more commonly used tetraneury refers to
the general arrangement (i.e., the presence of two
pairs of neurite bundles). Although they are lacking in
basal mollusks, ganglia may be part of a tetraneurion,
as exemplified in gastropods or bivalves, for example.
A tetraneurion has traditionally been considered a
defining character of Mollusca. However, an identical
situation is found in the creeping-type larva, the proposed basal larval type of Entoprocta [312]. Accordingly, this neural architecture appears to be
phylogenetically informative and constitutes an apomorphy of a clade comprising Mollusca and Entoprocta, the Tetraneuralia [37].

{44} Tract

A tract is a ➞neurite bundle. It is part of a ➞brain or
of a ➞ganglion and connects different ➞neuropils
with each other.
Discouraged terms: none
Background/comment: This term is used for neurite
bundles within the brain as well as within the ventral
➞ganglia. An example from the crustacean brain is the
olfactory-globular tract which links the olfactory lobe in
the deutocerebrum with the hemiellipsoid body in the
protocerebrum and is composed of the axons of olfactory interneurons [149,313,314]. A tract may be composed of axonal profiles of similar diameter, or of wide
diameter, fast-conducting profiles of giant axons.
➞Synapses are usually not present in tracts, but exceptions are known [18].
{45} Trochal neurite

A trochal neurite is a ➞neurite. It is part of a ➞neuron
and underlies a ciliated trochus.
{46} Trochal neurite bundle

A trochal neurite bundle is a ➞neurite bundle. It is
part of a ➞nervous system and underlies a ciliated
trochus.

Discouraged terms: prototroch nerve ring, telotroch
nerve ring, prototroch nerve, telotroch nerve, trochus
nerve
Background/comment: A trochal neurite bundle or
a single ➞trochal neurite underlies and possibly
innervates the ciliated prototroch of most spiralian larvae (Figure 31). Trochal neurites are arranged concentrically to the prototroch, metatroch and telotroch of
trochophore larvae, and to homologous structures such
as the velum of certain gastropod and bivalve veliger
larvae. In addition, trochal neurites may also be associated with the ciliated lobes of the Müller’s larva of
polyclad platyhelminths, the pilidium larva of nemertines and the ciliated bands of enteropneust and echinoderm larvae [129,133,134,312,315-323]. Many
trochal neurites can be detected using antibodies
against serotonin. ➞Neurites underlying ciliary bands
have traditionally played an important role in comparative larval neuroanatomy because they have been
found in nearly all larval protostomes and deuterostomes. Many late-stage planktotrophic polychaete larvae have longitudinal neurites or neurite bundles
(often two) that underlie ventral ciliary bands. These
are termed neurotroch or gastrotroch neurites. Some
traditional hypotheses argue that the ventral ➞nerve

cords of protostomes originated from the fusion of
neurotroch neurites, which were thought to have been
present in the last common trochophore-like larva of
protostomes (e.g., [38]).
{47} Unpaired midline neuropil

An unpaired midline neuropil is a ➞neuropil. It is part
of a ➞brain and occurs as an individual neuropil, spanning the midsagittal plane of the brain.
Discouraged terms: none

Background/comment: The term unpaired midline
neuropil is recommended to denominate hitherto
unspecified midline neuropils in order to avoid premature homologization between these neuropils and specific unpaired midline neuropils such as the ➞central
body, the ➞protocerebral bridge (Figure 4) and the
➞arcuate body. Unspecified midline neuropils have
been described in polychaetes [147,254], among other
taxa.
