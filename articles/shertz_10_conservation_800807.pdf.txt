Conservation, duplication, and loss of the Tor
signaling pathway in the fungal kingdom

Abstract
Background: The nutrient-sensing Tor pathway governs cell growth and is conserved in nearly all eukaryotic
organisms from unicellular yeasts to multicellular organisms, including humans. Tor is the target of the
immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, which in complex with the prolyl isomerase FKBP12 inhibits Tor functions.
Rapamycin is a gold standard drug for organ transplant recipients that was approved by the FDA in 1999 and is
finding additional clinical indications as a chemotherapeutic and antiproliferative agent. Capitalizing on the
plethora of recently sequenced genomes we have conducted comparative genomic studies to annotate the Tor
pathway throughout the fungal kingdom and related unicellular opisthokonts, including Monosiga brevicollis,
Salpingoeca rosetta, and Capsaspora owczarzaki.
Results: Interestingly, the Tor signaling cascade is absent in three microsporidian species with available genome
sequences, the only known instance of a eukaryotic group lacking this conserved pathway. The microsporidia are
obligate intracellular pathogens with highly reduced genomes, and we hypothesize that they lost the Tor pathway
as they adapted and streamlined their genomes for intracellular growth in a nutrient-rich environment. Two TOR
paralogs are present in several fungal species as a result of either a whole genome duplication or independent
gene/segmental duplication events. One such event was identified in the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis, a chytrid responsible for worldwide global amphibian declines and extinctions.
Conclusions: The repeated independent duplications of the TOR gene in the fungal kingdom might reflect
selective pressure acting upon this kinase that populates two proteinaceous complexes with different cellular roles.
These comparative genomic analyses illustrate the evolutionary trajectory of a central nutrient-sensing cascade that
enables diverse eukaryotic organisms to respond to their natural environments.

Background
The nutrient-sensing target of rapamycin (Tor) pathway
is highly conserved among eukaryotes and governs several essential cellular processes including protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, autophagy, and cytoskeletal
organization [1-3]. In the fungal kingdom, the Tor pathway has been best studied in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [2-4], the fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe [5,6], and the human pathogen Candida albicans [5-8]. However, little is known
about Tor in basal fungal lineages, including the Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota.
In S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, two Tor paralogs form
distinct complexes known as Tor Complex 1 (TORC1)

and Tor Complex 2 (TORC2) [9-12], while in most
other species, including humans, a single Tor protein
can populate both complexes [11-14]. Interestingly, S.
cerevisiae Tor2 can complement the loss of Tor1, but
Tor1 cannot complement the loss of Tor2 [15,16]. Two
Tor paralogs have also been identified in a metazoan,
the silkworm Bombyx mori [17] and three Tor paralogs
were identified in the trypanosomatid parasites Leishmania major [18] and the related species Trypanosoma
brucei [19], the first reported Tor triumvirates.
The ScTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin and controls
protein synthesis, mRNA synthesis and degradation,
ribosome biogenesis, and autophagy. TORC2 is insensitive to rapamycin and is involved in the control of actin
polarization and cell wall integrity [9,16]. TORC1 consists of Tor1 or Tor2, Kog1 [20], Tco89, and Lst8 [21],
while TORC2 contains Tor2, Lst8, Avo1, Avo2, and

investigated in this study in S. cerevisiae (A) and S. pombe (B) are included in this figure. Functional homologs between the two species are

Avo3 [22] (Figure 1A). Recently, the EGO-GTPase complex and its orthologs were shown to convey amino acid
signals for TORC1 activation in yeast, insects, and mammals [23-26]. In S. cerevisiae, immediate effectors of
TORC1 include the PP2A-like phosphatase Sit4 [27] and
the AGC kinase Sch9 [28]. In S. pombe, Tor participates
in other cellular functions including nutrient signaling
[29], cell growth and differentiation [30], mitotic commitment [31], and sexual development [11] (Figure 1B).
The structure of the Tor proteins is remarkably conserved (Figure 2) and features several domains for protein-protein interactions including N-terminal HEAT
(Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, PP2A A subunit, Tor)
repeats [32], a FAT (FRAP, ATM, and TRRAP) domain
[33,34], and an FRB (FK506-Rapamycin Binding) [35]
domain. The kinase and the FATC (FAT domain at the

C-terminus) [32,36] domains are present in the C-terminal region.
The Tor inhibitor rapamycin blocks cell proliferation
and is currently used as an immunosuppressive drug for
organ and tissue transplant recipients and a chemotherapy agent against a variety of solid cancers [37-40].
Rapamycin binds to the prolyl isomerase FKBP12 to
form a protein-drug complex that then interacts with
the Tor FRB domain in a ternary complex [41,42]. S.
cerevisiae cells treated with rapamycin display phenotypes associated with nutrient depletion including G1
cell cycle arrest, cellular volume expansion, protein
synthesis inhibition, glycogen accumulation, and autophagy [35,43].
Genetic analysis in S. cerevisiae characterizing rapamycin-resistant mutants led to the identification of FKBP12

as the intracellular receptor for rapamycin and defined
Tor1 and Tor2 as the targets of the FKBP12-rapamycin
complex [4]. Subsequent studies resulted in the identification and characterization of the TOR1 and TOR2 gene
products [15,44] as well as the elucidation of the Tor
signaling cascade [8,45-47]. These pioneering studies
aided in the identification of the mammalian Tor ortholog and characterization of this highly conserved signaling cascade [8,48,49]. Remarkably, expression of the
human FKBP12 ortholog in yeast fpr1 (the gene that
encodes FKBP12) deletion mutants complements to
restore rapamycin sensitivity, and hybrid Tor proteins
consisting of the yeast N-terminal domain fused to the
mammalian Tor kinase domain are also functional in
yeast [50]. Thus, the Tor pathway has been functionally
and structurally conserved from yeasts to humans over
the billion years of evolution separating the two species
from their last common ancestor.
We now know that the fungal and metazoan kingdoms are both within the opisthokont lineage of eukaryotes and are thus more closely related to each other
than the vast majority of eukaryotic organisms [51,52].
Moreover, these two highly successful kingdoms shared
a last common ancestor as recently as one billion years
ago, much more recently than most eukaryotes. Recent
initiatives, particularly the UNICORN project, have

facilitated the sequencing of several opisthokonts related
to the last common ancestor of the metazoans and
fungi, providing an interesting window into the evolution of both fungi and animals [53-56]. Thus, studies on
the evolutionary trajectory of the fungal kingdom in
general, and of the Tor signaling cascade in particular,
promise to reveal insights about how orthologous pathways function in the more complex milieu of multicellular metazoan organisms.
In this study, we have capitalized upon the wealth of
available genomic information by annotating the Tor
pathway in several fungal organisms in which this pathway has not been described. Our study included selected
species in the major groups of the fungal kingdom with
genome sequences available: the basidiomycete Pleurotus
ostreatus; the Mucorales zygomycetes Mucor circinelloides, Rhizopus oryzae, and Phycomyces blakesleeanus;
the chytridiomycetes Spizellomyces punctatus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; the microsporidian species
Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and
Nosema ceranae; and the related non-fungal opisthokonts Capsaspora owczarzaki, Salpingoeca rosetta, and
Monosiga brevicollis. Whereas the Tor pathway is conserved throughout the eukaryotes, strikingly, microsporidian species with their highly reduced and compacted
genomes lack the entire Tor pathway. We have also

investigated gene and genome duplication events that
resulted in two Tor homologs in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe,
P. ostreatus, and B. dendrobatidis, and the loss of a second Tor homolog following a whole genome duplication
event in R. oryzae.

Results and Discussion
Conservation of the Tor signaling pathway molecular
components

The Tor pathway is well conserved among nearly all
eukaryotic species examined to date. Tor is essential for
life and is the target of the potent drug rapamycin in
fungi, humans, and other eukaryotic organisms
[2,12,19,41]. Tor originated early during the eukaryotic
radiation, as it is present in the basal eukaryotes Giardia
lamblia [57], L. major [18] and T. brucei [19], and also
in plants [58]. Here we focused on the Tor pathway in
the fungal kingdom and other representative unicellular
opisthokont species outside of the fungi. Several genes
encoding Tor complex components, upstream regulators, and downstream effectors were identified in all
major groups throughout the fungal kingdom (Figure 1,
Table 1). Because we used BLASTp reciprocal best hits
(RBH) to identify orthologs, in some cases the absence
of an ortholog in our results may represent only a

failure to detect it with this method. Further, functional
homologs that are not sufficiently similar enough in
sequence to be identified may be present. Overall, a
high degree of pathway conservation is observed in the
Tor signaling cascade throughout the fungal kingdom,
with the exception of microsporidia in which all Tor
pathway components are absent. In addition, several
pathway components are conserved in the related unicellular opisthokonts M. brevicollis, S. rosetta, and C.
owczarzaki (Table 2).
In S. cerevisiae, Tor1 and Tor2 interact with several
proteins to form TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1 contains
Tor1 or Tor2, Kog1, Tco89, and Lst8. Kog1 functions as
a substrate-recruiting subunit in mammalian TORC1
(mTORC1) [13,59-61]. A gene encoding a putative Kog1
homolog was identified in all species included in this
study, with the exception of the microsporidia and S.
rosetta (Tables 1 and 2). Mutation of TCO89 results in
hypersensitivity to rapamycin and affects cellular integrity in S. cerevisiae [21]. Tco89 is only found in S. cerevisiae and could have resulted from a specialization of
the pathway exclusive to Saccharomyces species (Table
1). However, while a BLASTp search did not identify
Tco89 homologs in other species, S. pombe has been
reported to contain a functional homolog [GenBank:

homologs may exist in other fungal species as well.
However, no homologs were identified when using
S. pombe Tco89 as a query sequence. Lst8 binds to the
Tor kinase domain in S. cerevisiae to stimulate catalytic
activity [9] and a putative Lst8 homolog is conserved in
most species analyzed except microsporidia and
S. rosetta (Tables 1 and 2).
Additional BLASTp searches identified a single Tor
homolog in the following species: Lachancea thermotolerans CBS6340 [GenBank:XP_002552336], Pichia pastoris GS115 [GenBank:XP_002491471], Pichia stipitis

oryzae RIB40 [GenBank: XP_001826216], and Aspergillus niger CBS513.88 [GenBank:XP_001397781]. These
ascomycetes were not included in further studies.
In yeast and mammals, TORC2 controls spatial
aspects of growth. TORC2 includes Tor2, Avo1, Avo2,
Avo3, and Bit61 [9,22]. Avo1 plays an essential role in
actin cytoskeleton polarization [22] and is conserved
throughout the organisms that were the focus of this
study (Table 1) except in S. rosetta and C. owczarzaki
(Table 2). However, due to high divergence of the
AVO1 sequence amongst the known homologs, it is possible that the S. rosetta and C. owczarzaki homologs
cannot be identified using the BLASTp algorithm. Avo2
is a nonessential substrate adaptor for TORC2 [22] and
potential homologs were identified in most species studied, with the exceptions of S. pombe, P. ostreatus, the
three microsporidian species (Table 1), and M. brevicollis (Table 2). In S. cerevisiae, Avo3 (also know as Tsc11)
controls cytoskeletal dynamics [9,22], and homologs are
conserved throughout the species examined (Tables 1
and 2). Bit61, a nonessential protein that associates with
TORC2 [21], was only identified in S. cerevisiae (Tables
1 and 2).
Upstream regulators of Tor include Tsc1 and Tsc2
(Tuberous Sclerosis 1 and 2) and the GTPase Rheb (Ras
homolog enhanced in brain). In S. pombe and other
eukaryotes, Tsc1 and Tsc2 form a GTPase-activating
complex that negatively regulates the action of Rheb to
activate TORC1 [26,62,63]. Tsc1 and Tsc2 putative
homologs were identified in most species in the study,
with the exception of S. cerevisiae (Table 1); however,
Tsc1 homologs were not identified in B. dendrobatidis,
S. rosetta, or C. owczarzaki (Tables 1 and 2). In mammals and insects, four Rag GTPases (RagA-D) bind raptor (Kog1) to mediate TORC1 signaling in response to
amino acids [24,26]. RagA and RagB are orthologs of
S. cerevisiae Gtr1 whereas RagC and RagD are orthologs
of S. cerevisiae Gtr2 [23]. Gtr1 and Gtr2 form a complex
along with Ego1 and Ego3 known as EGOC/GSE [25],
which is regulated by the GTP exchange factor Vam6
[23]. Interestingly we found presumptive Gtr1 and Gtr2
orthologs in species in this study with the exception of
microsporidia (Table 1), and Gtr1 was not identified in
M. brevicollis (Table 2). However, Ego1 and Ego3, which
anchor Gtr1 and Gtr2 to endosomal and vacuolar membranes, are unique to S. cerevisiae and were not identified in the other species (Table 1). This suggests that
the specific EGO complex architecture might be
restricted to Saccharomyces, though it is possible that
functional homologs may be present in other species.
In fungi, several downstream effectors are targets of
Tor signaling. The PP2A phosphatase Sit4 and its

Shertz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:510
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/510

regulatory subunit Tap42 regulate the expression of several TORC1-controlled genes and Gcn2-regulated translation [3,64,65]. A Sit4 homolog was identified in R.
oryzae (Table 1), though a homolog of the regulatory
subunit Tap42 was not (Table 1). In S. rosetta, a Sit4
homolog was not identified, though Tap42 was (Table
2). Both of these situations could indicate rewiring of
the pathway, or alternatively these findings could be a
result of insufficient similarity to detect with a RBH
search method. Sch9, a member of the AGC kinase
family and the functional homolog of the p70 S6 kinase,
is a direct substrate of S. cerevisiae TORC1 involved in
ribosome biogenesis [28,66]. Sch9 was not identified in
RBH BLASTp searches with S. cerevisiae Sch9 in M. circinelloides, P. blakesleeanus, the microsporidia (Table 1),
or S. rosetta (Table 2), but was identified in all other
species. Putative homologs of Ypk2 kinase, a regulator
of ceramide synthesis controlled by TORC2 signaling
[67], were only identified in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe,
(Table 1), M. brevicollis, S. rosetta, and C. owczarzaki
(Table 2). Notably, the failure to detect many homologs
in M. brevicollis, S. rosetta, and C. owczarzaki could be
due to their evolutionary distance from the other organisms in the study and their gene divergence.
Evolutionary conservation of Tor kinase protein structure

The Tor kinases are phosphatidylinositol kinase-related
kinases (PIKKs) [68] and aside from their known protein
kinase function also serve as evolutionary constrained
scaffolds with several protein-protein interaction
domains that mediate multi-protein complex formation
[69]. Tor protein architecture was annotated using
SMART [70,71] and we found that it has been maintained throughout the species of this study (Figure 2).
N-terminal HEAT repeats are present in varying numbers and serve as scaffolding structures for protein-protein interactions [32,72,73]. Similarly, the FAT/toxic
domain and the accompanying C-terminal FATC
domain also participate in protein scaffolding and are
present and conserved in all species subject to analysis.
Over-expression of the FAT domain has a dominant
negative effect on cell growth in yeast and this effect
can be suppressed by over-expression of phospholipase
C [33]. The kinase domain has similarities to both lipid
and protein kinases, but it is a bona fide protein kinase.
The FRB (FKBP12-rapamycin binding) domain is a
highly conserved 100 amino acid region of Tor with several residues that are known to be required for binding
the FKBP12-rapamycin drug complex [42].
In addition, the FRB domain contains several residues
necessary for both phosphatidic acid binding and rapamycin interaction [74,75]. In mammals, phosphatidic
acid binding to the FRB region may promote the assembly of mTOR complexes. It has been proposed that the

Page 6 of 14

potent effect of the Tor inhibitor rapamycin may be due
to direct competition for overlapping phosphatidic acid
binding sites within the FRB domain [76]. Mutation of
the conserved amino acid residues S1975, W2041, or
F2048 in the FRB domain confers rapamycin resistance
in S. cerevisiae [4,42,77]. Strikingly, the corresponding
amino acid residues are conserved in all species examined (Figure 3). In mTOR, phosphatidic acid binding is
disrupted by mutations of L2031, F2309, and Y2105
[75], corresponding to S. cerevisiae Tor2 L1971, F1979,
and Y2045, respectively, all of which are conserved in
the studied fungal species (Figure 3).
Duplication of Tor in the fungal kingdom

Approximately 100 million years ago, the S. cerevisiae
ancestor underwent a whole genome duplication
(WGD) event, and species that descend from this evolutionary event retained duplicated subsets of genes. S.
cerevisiae retained approximately 8% of duplicated genes
[78,79], while other fungi in this lineage have maintained varying numbers of gene duplicates, such as Candida glabrata in which a smaller number (~2%) of these
pairs are maintained [80]. Interestingly, several of these
species, including S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae,
S. kudriavzevii, S. bayanus, S. castellii, and C. glabrata
have retained two TOR paralogs, whereas species outside of the WGD clade, including Kluyveromyces lactis
and Ashbya gossypii, have only a single TOR gene.
The fates of duplicated gene paralogs can be explained
through the duplication, degeneration, and complementation (DDC) model of gene duplication [81]. In species
with a single Tor, this protein populates both TORC1
and TORC2, each of which has distinct functions. Following duplication, each paralog likely sub-functionalized to carry out some, but not all, of its previous
functions so that between the two paralogs, each process
is performed. In S. cerevisiae, for example, Tor1 exclusively functions within TORC1, while Tor2 preferentially
populates TORC2 but can also function in TORC1. S.
pombe has two Tor paralogs as a result of an independent segmental gene duplication event, and each paralog
has distinct roles not necessarily equivalent to those of
S. cerevisiae Tor1 and Tor2. SpTor1 is not essential,
whereas SpTor2 is essential for growth [11,29,82].
We hypothesize that similar models could apply in
species encoding two Tor homologs resulting from independent gene duplication events such as P. ostreatus and
B. dendrobatidis. Based on their level of identity with
S. cerevisiae Tor homologs, the B. dendrobatidis genes
BDEG_08293 and BDEG_05727 have been designated
TOR1 and TOR2, respectively. However, these gene
names are not necessarily based on functional similarity
with ScTor1 and ScTor2 but rather indicate only that
there are two TOR homologs in B. dendrobatidis.

Figure 3 The highly conserved FRB domain of Tor. Residues L1971, F1979 and Y2045 are involved in phosphatidic acid binding in mTOR
(open arrows). Mutation of S1975 confers rapamycin resistance in mammalian cells, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Residues W2041 and F2048 are required for interaction with rapamycin. All of these amino acid residues are conserved
in the species examined in this study. Abbreviations: Sc = Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sp = Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Po = Pleurotus ostreatus,
Mc = Mucor circinelloides, Ro = Rhizopus oryzae, Pb = Phycomyces blakesleeanus, Bd = Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Spu = Spizellomyces
punctatus.

A similar naming challenge is evident in S. pombe,
where the functions of SpTor1 and SpTor2 are not
equivalent with those of ScTor1 and ScTor2.
While several species, such as those in the Saccharomyces clade, have two Tor paralogs resulting from
ancient WGD events, other species have acquired a second paralog through independent segmental gene duplication events, including B. dendrobatidis and several
fission yeast species closely related to S. pombe (Figure
4). Segmental gene duplications have played a major
role in the evolution of species and can result in the
duplication of single genes or large blocks of genes [83].
In S. cerevisiae, the duplication blocks with TOR include
three paralogous gene pairs that have been retained
from the ancestral WGD event: PTK1/PTK2, TOR1/
TOR2, and MNN4/YJR061W [78] (Figure 5A). Further,
C. glabrata, an ascomycete closely related to S. cerevisiae that diverged following the WGD, has also maintained a second TOR paralog and synteny is apparent in
the region flanking the TOR1 and TOR2 genes, though
one must extend the analysis to >40 kb from the TOR
genes to detect it (See additional file 1: Supplemental
figure 1). However, because C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae
have retained different subsets of genes from the ancestral WGD, the duplicated genes surrounding TOR in

these species are not homologs of one another. Further,
C. glabrata has maintained fewer of the synteny blocks
found in S. cerevisiae, and the block containing the TOR
genes (Block 42) is not conserved in C. glabrata [80].
In contrast, genomic regions surrounding the Tor paralogs in S. pombe (Figure 5B) and B. dendrobatidis (Figure 5C) are not syntenically conserved. That is, the
duplicated genes are not flanked by other duplicated
gene pairs, and the two TOR paralogs likely resulted
from independent segmental gene duplication events.
Further, there are no indications of WGDs in these species. In the Schizosaccharomycotina, the TOR gene
duplication occurred prior to speciation as evidenced by
the fact that S. pombe, S. octosporus, S. japonicus, and S.
cryophilus have each retained a second Tor paralog; the
Tor orthologs across these four species are more closely
related to each other than to those from other species
(Figure 4). No syntenic conservation between the genomic regions containing TOR paralogs was detected in
any species of the Schizosaccharomyces group, supporting the occurrence of an independent segmental gene
duplication in their common ancestor (see additional
file 2: supplemental Figure 2).
The Taphrinomycotina is a monophyletic taxon of the
Ascomycota containing the Schizosaccharomycetes,

Figure 4 TOR gene duplication events. Several independent segmental gene duplications or whole genome duplication events have occurred
throughout the fungal kingdom resulting in multiple Tor homologs. A whole genome duplication occurred in the Saccharomyces budding yeast
lineage prior to the speciation of the sensu stricto, sensu lato, and related Saccharomycotina species. An independent gene duplication event
occurred in the Schizosaccharomyces lineage, resulting in 2 Tor homologs in four Schizosaccharomyces fission yeast species. Independent gene
duplication events also occurred in Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and the edible mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus. Numbers at nodes are
bootstrap percentages representing 500 replicates.

Taphrinomycetes, Neolectomycetes, and Pneumocystidomycetes. Genomes are only available for species
within the Schizosaccharomycetes (S. pombe, S. octosporus, S. japonicus, and S. cryophilus) and the Taphrinomycetes (Pneumocystis carinii). While the studied
Schizosaccharomyces spp. contain two Tor homologs, a
single homolog was identified in P. carinii with
tBLASTx using the highly conserved S. cerevisiae FRB
domain of Tor1 based on sequence data produced by
the Pneumocystis Genome Project (funded by the NIH
NIAID) that was obtained from http://pgp.cchmc.org at
the time of publication. Based on the phylogenetic placement of these two groups [84] and the available genomic information, we hypothesize that the segmental
TOR duplication is unique to the Schizosaccharomyces
spp. and occurred following their divergence from the
common ancestor of the Taphrinomycota, as P. carinii,
the other species within this taxon with available genome data, appears to contain a single Tor homolog.
Interestingly, the zygomycete R. oryzae underwent a
whole genome duplication event and despite retaining

12% of the resulting duplicated genes [85] compared to
8% retained genes in a separate WGD event in S. cerevisiae [78,79], two Tor paralogs have not been retained;
only a single Tor homolog was identified. Currently, the
Zygomycota is the only group studied without an identified species containing two Tor homologs; however,
there are not enough available genomes to make a definitive conclusion in this group. Other species with independent TOR duplications likely remain to be identified
in all of the major fungal lineages, and as more genome
sequences become available this will be addressed.
During this study, we identified three additional species that possibly have two TOR paralogs: M. brevicollis,
Thecamonas trahens, and Allomyces macrogynus, species
that are included in the Origins of Multicellularity Project [86]. While analysis is limited because of the state
of the M. brevicollis (choanoflagellate) genome, it
appears that an additional bonafide Tor protein is
encoded with the conserved Tor protein architecture.
Thecamonas trahens is a unicellular apusomonad that
also contains two TOR paralogs. Interestingly, A.

Figure 5 Synteny analysis of TOR paralogs. Synteny analysis supports the hypothesis that the Tor paralogs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (A)
resulted from a whole genome duplication event, while in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (B) and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (C) two Tor
paralogs result from independent segmental gene duplication events, and there is no syntenic conservation in the surrounding sequence. Red
lines indicate syntenic genes oriented in the same direction whereas blue lines indicate syntenic genes oriented in the opposite direction (i.e., +
strand and - strand).

macrogynus is a fungus that may contain a second paralog; however, it appears that the FRB domain overlaps
with the kinase domain. This may represent a case in
which TOR was duplicated but is in the process of losing one of the copies. These cases are a springboard for
future studies involving the duplication of TOR within
and beyond the fungal kingdom.
Loss of the Tor signaling pathway in microsporidia

While components of the Tor signaling cascade are conserved in eukaryotes from yeasts to humans, the microsporidia, a group of highly specialized obligate
intracellular pathogens completely lack all of the pathway components investigated in this study. E. cuniculi
has previously been noted to lack the Tor kinase [87],
and we found that all pathway components including
Tor were missing not only in E. cuniculi but also in its
microsporidian relatives E. bieneusi and N. ceranae
(Table 2). Microsporidian genomes are highly compacted and show a marked reduced gene content. The
genome of the human pathogen E. cuniculi has 1997
genes distributed throughout 11 chromosomes in a 2.9
Mb genome [88], less than half the number of protein-

coding genes found in Escherichia coli. For comparison,
the genome of the human pathogen E. bieneusi genome
is ~6 Mb with 3,804 genes [89] and the honeybee pathogen N. ceranae genome is ~7.9 Mb with 2,614 predicted
genes [90]. Genome reduction has been well studied in
intracellular bacteria: during the specialization process
from a free-living to intracellular lifestyle, massive gene
loss can occur [91-95]. We hypothesize that as a consequence of their specialization to an obligate intracellular
lifestyle, the need for nutrient sensing was relaxed and
these obligate intracellular microsporidia acquired nutrients from within the host cytoplasm. Thus, they no
longer required the Tor pathway, which is dedicated to
sensing changes in the nutrient composite of the environmental milieu. However, E. cuniculi has retained
some of the genes encoding signaling pathways involved
in nutrient sensing in other species, including homologs
of S. cerevisiae Ras1 and Ras2 (data not shown).
Interestingly, P. carinii is an obligate pathogen with a
reduced genome estimated to be ~8 Mb [96], which
unlike microsporidia is not obligately intracellular.
A single Tor homolog was identified [Pneumocystis
Genome Project:cap3_it1_grp346_contig490] using the

Shertz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:510
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/510

S. cerevisiae Tor1 FRB domain in tBLASTx, supporting
our hypothesis that the microsporidia have streamlined
their genomes as they adopted an obligate intracellular
life cycle. P. carinii likely requires Tor because it must
survive in a metabolically active form outside of host
cells, undergoing cell division in the extracellular milieu
of the infected host lung.
Many microsporidian genomes have undergone
extreme genome reduction and are among the eukaryotes with the smallest genomes. In addition to fewer
genes than other species (1997 in E. cuniculi compared
to 6607 in S. cerevisiae), E. cuniculi has shorter genes,
small intergenic distances, and very few introns [88,97].
This species (and to an even greater extent, E. bieneusi)
lacks several genes that are necessary for biosynthetic
pathways and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in free-living
organisms [88,89,98]. Remarkably, E. cuniculi must
acquire ATP from its host through a series of ATP
transporters anciently acquired from Rickettsia- or Chlamydia-like bacteria [99], and this is an example of how
E. cuniculi, and possibly other microsporidia, can hijack
mechanisms of other intracellular bacteria, fungi, or the
host to survive in and adapt to their highly specialized
intracellular lifestyle.

Conclusions
The Tor pathway is highly conserved with some exceptions among fungi, including several pathogens. Similarly, the molecular structural organization of the Tor
kinases has been remarkably conserved as well as the
presumed ability to bind the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. This feature, combined with the essential nature of
the rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 pathway for cell growth,
should enable the development of rapamycin-based strategies for antifungal therapies. Duplications of the Tor
protein occurred in most fungal groups examined,
resulting from either independent segmental gene duplication events or a WGD event. The maintenance of two
Tor homologs can be explained through the DDC
model of gene duplication, in which the paralogs subfunctionalize and together support all of the functions
of the pre-duplicated protein. In addition, species outside of the fungal kingdom with two or more TOR
homologs include the metazoan B. mori, the apusomonad protozoan T. trahens, the trypanosome protozoans
L. major and T. brucei, and possibly the choanoflagellate
M. brevicollis. This suggests that the Tor gene has been
independently duplicated multiple times since the last
common ancestor of the Opisthokonta and Excavata
lineages. The Tor pathway, as well as the Tor protein
itself, is highly conserved in eukaryotes, so the observation that three microsporidian species are missing the
entire pathway is striking. It would appear that the specialized obligate intracellular life cycle of microsporidia

Page 10 of 14

allows for the acquisition of nutrients from the host cell,
obviating a requirement for this central nutrient-sensing
pathway that is essential in all known cases of other
eukaryotes for axenic growth.

Methods
Identification of pathway component homologs

Tor homologs were identified using the highly conserved
100 amino acid FRB domain of S. cerevisiae Tor1 in
BLASTp reciprocal best-hit searches between the specific
species database and the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). All queries for other Tor pathway components were retrieved from SGD and homologs were
identified by BLASTp reciprocal best-hit searches, with
the exception of Tsc1 and Tsc2. Tsc1 and Tsc2 protein
query sequences were retrieved from the S. pombe GeneDB, and homologs were identified using BLASTp
searches between the S. pombe genome database and the
species database. Species identification numbers are listed
in Supplemental Table 1. Protein architecture of each
homolog was elucidated with Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) analysis [70,71].
Accession numbers are provided for putative Tor pathway components (see Additional file 3, supplemental

Phylogenetic analysis of Tor

The ProtTest program [100] was used to select an
appropriate model to construct the phylogenetic

Shertz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:510
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/510

relationship of the Tor proteins of the studied species.
For this study, the best model for phylogenetic construction of the Tor protein using maximum likelihood (ML)
was JTT+I+G+F [101]. The ML tree was generated
using PhyML with the JTT+I+G+F mode with 500 bootstrap replicates [102,103]. The Tor amino acid
sequences from all species were aligned with CLUSTAL
W [104].
Synteny analysis of TOR paralogs

Tor homologs in fungal species were identified with
BLAST [105] using TOR1 and TOR2 of S. cerevisiae as
query sequences. The TOR sequence and flanking
regions (up to 100 kb) were extracted from corresponding contigs or chromosomal sequences. To analyze the
synteny of TOR and flanking regions, we constructed a
database of one TOR and flanking region sequence and
used the other TOR homolog and flanking region
sequence to perform tBLASTx searches in the database
(BLOSUM62 matrix; E-value = 1e-3; gap cost: existence
11, extension 1; and low complexity regions filter). The
tBLASTx results were parsed and formatted using an inhouse Perl script (available upon request). The parsed
and formatted tBLASTx results were then imported into
Artemis software [106] for synteny analysis. We
employed a cutoff value of 100 bp to filter short nonsignificant matches between query and database
sequences.

Additional material
Additional file 1: supplemental Figure 1 - Syntenic conservation of
genomic area surrounding TOR1 and TOR2 in Candida glabrata. The
top bar represents C. glabrata chromosome F and the bottom bar
represents C. glabrata chromosome K. On chromosome F, the first five
genes correspond to CAGL0F00110g, CAGL0F00121g, CAGL0F00143g,
CAGL0F00154g, and CAGL0F00165g. Red lines indicate syntenic genes
oriented in the same direction whereas blue lines indicate syntenic
genes oriented in the opposite direction (i.e., + strand and - strand).
Because S. cerevisiae retained 8% of its duplicated genes and C. glabrata
retained only 2%, we had to use a larger window to detect syntenic
gene pairs. C. glabrata has retained the other S. cerevisiae homologs
(PTK1/PTK2 and MNN4/YJR061W) in the Tor block in duplicate, but they
are located in separate blocks on C. glabrata chromosome 8, unlinked to
TOR1 (chromosome 6) or TOR2 (chromosome 11).

conservation in Schizosaccharomyces species surrounding the TOR
genomic regions. Red lines indicate syntenic genes oriented in the
same direction whereas blue lines indicate syntenic genes oriented in
the opposite direction (i.e., + strand and - strand). No syntenic
conservation was observed in the separate species, further supporting
our hypothesis of an independent segmental gene duplication in the
Schizosaccharomyces common ancestor.
