Abstract
Background: The human genome harbors several largely preserved HERV-K(HML-2) elements. Although this
retroviral family comes closest of all known HERVs to producing replication competent virions, mutations acquired
during their chromosomal residence have rendered them incapable of expressing infectious particles. This also
holds true for the HERV-K113 element that has conserved open reading frames (ORFs) for all its proteins in
addition to a functional LTR promoter. Uncertainty concerning the localization and impact of post-insertional
mutations has greatly hampered the functional characterization of these ancient retroviruses and their proteins.
However, analogous to other betaretroviruses, it is known that HERV-K(HML-2) virions undergo a maturation
process during or shortly after release from the host cell. During this process, the subdomains of the Gag
polyproteins are released by proteolytic cleavage, although the nature of the mature HERV-K(HML-2) Gag proteins
and the exact position of the cleavage sites have until now remained unknown.
Results: By aligning the amino acid sequences encoded by the gag-pro-pol ORFs of HERV-K113 with the
corresponding segments from 10 other well-preserved human specific elements we identified non-synonymous
post-insertional mutations that have occurred in this region of the provirus. Reversion of these mutations and a
partial codon optimization facilitated the large-scale production of maturation-competent HERV-K113 virus-like
particles (VLPs). The Gag subdomains of purified mature VLPs were separated by reversed-phase high-pressure
liquid chromatography and initially characterized using specific antibodies. Cleavage sites were identified by mass
spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing and confirmed by mutagenesis. Our results indicate that the gag gene
product Pr74Gag of HERV-K(HML-2) is processed to yield p15-MA (matrix), SP1 (spacer peptide of 14 amino acids),
p15, p27-CA (capsid), p10-NC (nucleocapsid) and two C-terminally encoded glutamine- and proline-rich peptides,
QP1 and QP2, spanning 23 and 19 amino acids, respectively.
Conclusions: Expression of reconstituted sequences of original HERV elements is an important tool for studying
fundamental aspects of the biology of these ancient viruses. The analysis of HERV-K(HML-2) Gag processing and
the nature of the mature Gag proteins presented here will facilitate further studies of the discrete functions of
these proteins and of their potential impact on the human host.

Background
During the early and more recent evolution of our primate and hominid ancestors, a number of retroviruses
infected the germ line cells, thereby becoming vertically
transmitted genetic elements [1]. Today these so-called
Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) constitute
approximately 8% of our genome [2]. One likely reason
for this accumulation is the inability of the host cell to
reverse the retroviral integration process. Although long
neglected as junk DNA, evidence is now accumulating
that several elements, at least, are involved in certain
physiological and pathological processes [2-5]. HERVs
are known to regulate the expression of several genes
and two HERV envelope proteins (syncytins) are
involved in placental development [6,7]. The discovery
of endogenous retroviral particles in cancer cells, as well
as their similarity to exogenous cancer-inducing retroviruses, prompted intense interest in these ancient
viruses and their possible association with malignant
transformation [8-10]. Although during the course of
evolution many HERVs have accumulated a number of
post-insertional mutations (simply by copy errors made
by the host DNA polymerase) as well as extensive deletions, some have retained open reading frames (ORFs)
for viral proteins such as the group specific antigen
(Gag) [11,12]. However, none of these virtually complete
proviruses has been shown to be fully functional and
replication competent. The betaretrovirus HERV-K
(HML-2) family of endogenous human retroviruses is
the best preserved and most recently active, having first
entered the germ lines of human predecessors as exogenous retroviruses about 35 million years ago [13]. The
presence of several exclusively human proviral elements
indicates ongoing activity less than 5 million years ago,
after the split of the human and chimpanzee lineages
[14-16].
Recently, two synthetic consensus sequences based on
the alignment of a number of human-specific members
of the HERV-K(HML-2) family were constructed [17,18]
and shown to be able to produce infectious retroviruslike particles. Using a similar approach we have reconstituted the original envelope protein of one of the
youngest HERV-K(HML-2) elements, HERV-K113, and
demonstrated its restored functionality [19]. There is no
evidence that the HERV-K113 element suffered from
the action of the APOBEC family of proteins [20]. In
the present study we identified non-synonymous postintegrational mutations in the gag-pro-pol region of the
HERV-K113 sequence present in a BAC library clone
[14,15] and reconstituted the original ancient Gag precursor proteins. This reversion of the post-insertional
mutations made it possible to investigate the cleavage of
the HERV-K(HML-2) Gag precursor protein during
viral maturation.

The internal structural proteins of all retroviruses,
including ancient betaretroviruses, are synthesized as
large Gag polyproteins [21]. In addition, the position of
the reading frames in the proviral sequence of HERV-K
(HML-2) indicates that ribosomal frameshifting is necessary for the synthesis of the Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol
polyproteins as has been shown for the closely related
mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) [22]. The three
types of Gag polyproteins oligomerize and form roughly
spherical immature virions which bud from the cell
membrane, independent of envelope proteins [23]. During egress or shortly thereafter, the Gag, Gag-Pro and
Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins in the immature particle are
cleaved by the viral protease (PR). Cleavage leads to the
dramatic morphological changes known as maturation
and renders the virus infectious. During this process the
Gag protein itself is further cleaved by the protease to
yield the major mature proteins matrix (MA), capsid
(CA) and nucleocapsid (NC). The capsid protein is the
main structural element of the mature virus particle,
forming a core shell around the NC-RNA complex,
while MA remains bound to the viral lipid bilayer.
Depending on the genus of the virus, additional proteins
and peptides are also released. In the case of MMTV,
these are the polypeptides pp21, p8, p3 and n located
between MA and CA [24]. These proteins appear to
play a role in Gag folding, intracellular transport, assembly or maturation, although their precise functions are
still poorly understood [25].
Several HERV-K(HML-2) proviruses encode functional
PR proteins, an enzyme that has previously been
expressed and partially characterized [26-29]. Although
proteolytic Gag fragments have been described in teratocarcinoma cells expressing HERV-K and found to be
released from in vitro translated Gag proteins following
incubation with recombinant PR, the precise nature of
these protein domains and their cleavage sites remains
open [26,28,30].
In this report, we identify the processing sites in the
Pr74 Gag of this primordial betaretrovirus. Similar to
MMTV, the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) and
other closely related viruses, HERV-K(HML-2) also
encodes additional polypeptides between the MA and
CA subdomains. We identified a 14 amino acid long
spacer peptide, SP1, adjacent to the MA domain and a
subsequent 15 kDa protein (p15). Moreover, two short
glutamine- and proline-rich peptides are released from
the C-terminus of the polyprotein. Our results using
this archival virus further contribute to the understanding of retroviral Gag processing and maturation. The
exact identification of the Gag subdomains in this paper
is a prerequisite for their accurate molecular cloning or
the generation of deletion mutants. It facilitates the
characterization of post-translational modifications in

George et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:30

the subunits and will help future studies into their role
during assembly and other replication steps. In this
regard, the role of the two C-terminal QP-rich peptides
reported here will be of particular interest. The results
also allow the unequivocal localisation of functional
domains, e.g. L-domains, to individual Gag subunits.

Results
Reconstitution of the gag-pro-pol coding region of the
original HERV-K113 provirus and expression of a partially
codon optimized sequence

Expression levels of the Gag protein and virus-like particles of the native HERV-K113 sequence in transfected
cells are very low, making detection difficult [30-32].
This is mainly the result of mutations in the proviral
DNA acquired after insertion into the hostâs genome
[19,31] and the use of rare codons by the virus. To overcome this obstacle, we employed the same approach
previously described to reconstitute and express the original envelope protein of HERV-K113 [19] at high
levels. To identify post-insertional mutations in the
HERV-K113 gag-pro-pol region, we aligned the amino
acid sequences encoded by the ORFs with those of 10
well-preserved human specific HERV-K(HML-2) viruses
(Additional File 1A). If none or only one of the other
elements had the same amino acid at a certain position,
the underlying nucleotide difference was assumed to
have been introduced into HERV-K113 after insertion.
If two or more of the elements shared a difference with
HERV-K113 (even if different from the consensus
sequence), it was considered to be a shared polymorphism already present at the time of integration and was
therefore left unchanged. In total, 5 putative proteinrelevant post-insertional mutations were identified in
the Gag protein, 3 in the ORF of the PR and 8 in the
ORF of the polymerase (Additional File 1A).
To enhance the expression of the Gag, Gag-Pro and
Gag-Pro-Pol proteins, large sections of the viral DNA
encoding the three reconstituted proteins were codonoptimized for mammalian cells. Regions corresponding
to slippery sites and overlapping ORFs (Figure 1) were
kept in their native form to allow frame shifts for the
expression of the protease and polymerase. The synthetic sequence (oricoHERV-K113_GagProPol) was
cloned in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector to allow
CMV-promoter driven expression (Additional File 1B).
The prefix orico is derived from the abbreviation âoriâ
(reversion of post-insertional mutations into the original
amino acid sequence) and âcoâ for codon optimization.
Production of maturation-competent VLPs by expression
of reconstituted HERV-K113 Gag polyproteins

The ability of oricoHERV-K113_GagProPol to generate
VLPs was investigated by electron microscopy (EM).

Page 3 of 15

HEK 293T cells were transfected and incubated for two
days before harvesting cells and supernatants. Viral particles were purified from supernatants by ultracentrifugation and cells and virus pellets were then prepared for
thin section EM. Immature virions with an electron
dense ring structure (Figure 2A) as well as mature particles with an electron dense core (Figure 2B) were
observed at the cell surface, whereas virus pellets consisted exclusively of mature virions (Figure 2C). By coexpressing a reconstituted HERV-K113 envelope protein
[19]in trans it was possible to show by transmission
electron microscopy (Figure 2D) and scanning electron
microscopy (Figure 2E) that the protein can be incorporated into the VLPs. Moreover, the supernatant of cells
expressing the VLPs contain reverse transcriptase activity as measured using the Cavidi RT-Assay (data not
shown).
Identification and characterization of the major mature
HERV-K(HML-2) Gag proteins

We next analyzed proteins in the virus pellets by silver
nitrate stained sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In addition to the oricoHERV-K113_GagProPol, cells were also transfected
with a maturation defective mutant (oricoHERVK113_GagPro - Pol) carrying PR inactivating D204A,
T205A and G206A mutations in the active site of the
enzyme. A protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa, corresponding well to the expected
size of the HERV-K(HML-2) Gag precursor protein (74
kDa), was present in pellets of the PR mutant. Such a
band was absent or barely visible in pellets of reconstituted VLPs carrying an active PR (Figure 3A). Here,
bands of 36 kDa, 27 kDa, 15-18 kDa and 12 kDa, presumably processed Gag polypeptides, were exclusively
present in these pellets (Figure 3A, lane 1). Expression
of the reconstituted proteins encoded in the gag-pro-pol
region of HERV-K113 therefore leads to the production
and release of maturation competent VLPs.
A comparison of the HERV-K(HML-2) Gag sequence
with those of other betaretroviruses suggests that in
addition to the canonical matrix (MA), capsid (CA) and
nucleocapsid (NC) proteins, at least one further polypeptide of approximately 15 kDa (designated here as
p15) might be encoded between the MA and CA
domains. Such protein(s) are known to exist in the closely related MMTV and MPMV viral particles [24,33].
In an attempt to assign the mature Gag proteins
observed to the expected MA, p15, CA and NC processing products we generated a series of specific antisera
by immunizing rats with E. coli-expressed fragments of
the Pr74Gag protein. An antiserum raised against amino
acids 1-100 (aMA), expected to include the MA protein,
reacted with a 36 kDa and a 16 kDa protein (Figure 3B).

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the HERV-K113 provirus and structure of the oricoHERV-K113_GagProPol construct. To express
high levels of the original HERV-K113 Gag, Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol proteins, a partially codon-optimized sequence (gray areas) encoding the
reconstituted amino acid sequence of the virus was cloned downstream of the CMV promoter in the pcDNA3.1 vector. The 16 identified and
reverted post-insertional amino acid changes are listed next to the oricoHERV-K113_GagProPol structure. Their positions in the open reading
frames are indicated underneath. Numbers above refer to nucleotide positions of the codon-optimized regions starting with the first nucleotide
of gag.

A second antiserum (ap15), specific for amino acids
140-282, also recognized the 36 kDa protein and a triplet of bands in the 15-18 kDa region (Figure 3B). The
ratio of intensities between the triplet bands and the 36
kDa band varied to some extent, depending on the preparation. Since the 36 kDa protein was detected by the
aMA and the ap15 antisera, we assume that this protein represents a processing intermediate comprising the
approximately 16 kDa MA and the p15 protein. Finally,
a single band of 27 kDa was detected using an antiserum (aCA) specific for amino acids 283-526, presumably corresponding to the CA subdomain. All three
antisera reacted with the unprocessed Gag precursor
expressed by the inactive PR mutant (Figure 3B).
To further delineate the nature of the processed
HERV-K(HML-2) Gag domains, we separated the proteins from mature VLPs by HPLC on a reverse phase
column. Fractions of 500 Î¼l were collected and the
eluted proteins detected by UV absorption at 280 nm
(Figure 4A). Fractions containing the major protein
peaks were then analysed by Western blot using the

antisera described above (Figure 4B). The assumed 16
kDa MA protein, recognized by the rat aMA serum,
was present together with traces of the 36 kDa protein
in fraction 59 (Figure 4B, left panel). The proteins in
this fraction were also recognized by the HERMA4
monoclonal antibody [30] indicating that it binds to an
epitope within the MA domain (data not shown). The
ap15 antiserum also detected the 36 kDa protein, providing further evidence that this is a processing intermediate containing MA-p15. The smallest fragment of
the 15-18 kDa triplet recognized by the ap15 antiserum
was eluted in fraction 43 and the largest mainly in fraction 45 (Figure 4B, middle panel). These two protein
bands were usually the strongest of the triplet. The
commercially available monoclonal antibody HERM1841-5 (Austral Biologicals) reacted with the same proteins, indicating that its epitope is located in the p15
protein (data not shown). The presumed 27 kDa CA
protein was detected in fraction 56 (Figure 4B, right
panel). None of the antisera reacted with proteins in
fraction 34.

Determination of protease cleavage sites by N-terminal
sequencing of isolated HERV-K(HML-2) Gag proteins

The fractions containing diverse p15 fragments (fractions 43-46), the CA protein (fraction 55-58) and the
putative NC protein (fraction 34) were subjected to
SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and
stained with Ponceau S (Figure 5A). The major bands

Page 5 of 15

on the membrane corresponded with the molecular
mass of the proteins previously identified by specific
antisera. Fractions 43 to 46 gave two major bands
migrating with apparent molecular masses of 15 kDa
and approximately 18 kDa as well as an additional
weaker band between these two. The two major proteins
of this subdomain, the CA protein of fraction 56 and the
assumed NC protein of 12 kDa in fraction 34, were cut
out and N-terminally sequenced (Figure 5A). The Nterminal sequences obtained by Edman degradation confirmed the identity of the processed Gag subdomains
and identified the cleavage sites (Table 1). This also
allowed the calculation of the theoretical molecular
masses of the released proteins. Sequencing also
revealed that the N-termini of the two p15 variants differ by the 14 amino acid peptide âVAEPVMAQSTQNVDâ which we have designated âspacer
peptide 1â (SP1). To address the possibility that the p15
variants also vary at their C-termini, each was digested
with trypsin and the fragments analyzed by MALDITOF. In both samples, a peptide of 1210.3 Da was
detected, corresponding to the C-terminal trypsindigested fragment âKEGDTEAWQFâ (theoretical average
molecular weight 1210.3 Da) preceding the N-terminal
CA sequence (data not shown). The sequence of this Cterminal p15 peptide was further verified by MALDITOF MS/MS (data not shown). These experiments confirm that the two p15 variants share the same C-terminal sequence. The larger p15 protein with a calculated
molecular mass of 16.5 kDa (18 kDa on SDS-PAGE) is
therefore a cleavage intermediate from which a 14
amino acid peptide (SP1) of 1.5 kDa is released to generate the mature 15 kDa p15 protein (15-16 kDa on
SDS-PAGE).
Validation of the cleavage sites identified by N-terminal
sequencing

In retroviral cleavage sites, the P1 position (amino acid
preceding the scissile bond) is generally hydrophobic
and unbranched at the b-carbon [34]. This principle is
fulfilled in all cleavage sites identified here with the
exception of the SP1-p15 site. The Asp in P1 renders
this position rather unlikely to be a retroviral PR cleavage site [34]. To test whether an Asp in P1 inhibits
hydrolysis by the HERV-K(HML-2) PR, we substituted
the hydrophobic residues in the P1 positions of the p15CA and CA-NC cleavage sites for Asp. We also substituted Tyr for Ala at the P1 position of the cleavage site
used to release the mature MA protein. This resulted in
a dramatic reduction in the extent of cleavage at this
site with only a residual amount of mature 16 kDa MA
being observed (Figure 5B). The amount of an 18 kDa
protein, consistent with the MA-SP1 intermediate that
is usually barely visible in wild type VLPs, increased

(right panel) polypeptides of HERV-K113. The band marked with a star is an unspecific N-terminal degradation product of the Gag precursor that

accordingly. Introduction of an Asp at the P1 position of
the canonical type I cleavage site between p15 and CA
not only prevented cleavage at this site but also severely
impaired processing at other sites. This resulted in the
presence of far more MA-SP1-p15-CA precursor than
mature MA protein (Figure 5B). Interestingly, substitution of Gly for Asp at the P1 position of the CA-NC
scissile bond, a canonical type II cleavage site [34], only
partially inhibited processing, with a significant release
of the mature 27 kDa CA protein still occurring. This
indicates that an Asp at the P1 position of at least some
type II cleavage sites is possible, the hydrolysis however
seems to be inefficient and slow.
Further processing at the C-terminus of the Pr74Gag
precursor results in the release of two glutamine- and
proline-rich polypeptides

The apparent molecular mass of the presumed mature
NC protein on SDS-PAGE (12 kDa, see Figure 3A) was
lower than the calculated value (14.6 kDa) and a comparison of the Gag C-termini of HERV-K113, MMTV
and MPMV indicated that HERV-K(HML-2) might also
release a C-terminal Gag polypeptide (Figure 6A) similar
to the MPMV p4 subdomain [24]. Such a polypeptide
would be highly glutamine- and proline (QP)- rich. This
was supported by MALDI-TOF measurements of the
NC subdomain, which yielded a molecular mass of only
10 kDa (Figure 6B).

To identify further processing sites at the C-terminus
of the Gag-precursor, a tryptic digest of the NC subdomain (fraction 34 of the RP HPLC run) was subjected to
MALDI-TOF analysis. This identified a âGQPQAPQQTGAFâ peptide of 1228.58 Da that although being cleaved
by trypsin at the N-terminus could not have been
formed by trypsin cleavage at the C-terminus and therefore represented the C-terminus of the mature NC subdomain. Cleavage by the viral PR at this site not only
generates a NC of 10 kDa but also corresponds well to
the region in which NC-p4 cleavage in the MPMV Gag
protein occurs (Figure 6A). However, it was not possible
using SDS-PAGE or reverse phase-HPLC of VLPs to
identify the expected C-terminal QP-peptide of 4.6 kDa.
Subsequently an Asp was introduced at the P1 position of the C-terminal NC cleavage site (F624D mutation) to block or at least impair the release of the
expected C-terminal peptide. Because an NC-specific
antiserum was not available, the effect of this mutation
was initially investigated using SDS-PAGE. Unexpectedly, the mutation shifted a large fraction of the NC
protein only by about 2.5 kDa (Figure 6C) and not the
expected 5 kDa, which would have been consistent with
the remaining C-terminal sequence attached to the NC.
The mutant protein was therefore purified by RP-HPLC
and analyzed by MALDI-TOF, which indicated a molecular mass of 12.5 kDa (data not shown). A tryptic
digest generated the anticipated NC subunit fragments

but, as expected, did not contain the âGQPQAPQQTGADâ peptide. Instead, the same peptide with a 23
amino acid extension was detected (Figure 6D). The
F624D mutation therefore confirmed the C-terminal NC
processing site identified earlier and revealed a further
cleavage site in the C-terminal QP-rich sequence.
Therefore, a 23 amino acid-long QP-rich peptide 1
(QP1) and a 19 amino acid-long QP-rich peptide 2
(QP2) are released from the C-terminus of the Pr74Gag
protein. All processing sites, molecular masses and

subdomain sequences of the reconstituted HERV-K113
Gag precursor protein are depicted in Figure 7.

Discussion
The ability of some human endogenous retroviruses to
produce viral particles has been known for many years
[11,35], and such virions have been shown to be
expressed in a variety of tumour cells, including teratocarcinomas and melanomas. These proviruses generally
belong to the HERV-K(HML-2) family, which includes

Figure 6 Characterization of the processing at the Pr74Gag C-terminus. (A) Alignment of the amino acid sequences of oricoHERV-K113,
MPMV (AAC82573) and MMTV (AAC82557.1) starting from the N-terminus of the NC domains. The red arrow indicates the NC-p4 cleavage site in
MPMV [24]. Identical amino acids in different sequences are indicated in yellow. Black boxes span the RNA-binding zinc finger region. The
alignment was generated using BLOSUM 62 (Clone Manager) and was subsequently adjusted by hand. (B) MALDI-TOF analysis of the NC domain
of oricoHERV-K113. The first major peak represents doubly charged NC (z = 2) and the second major peak NC with a single charge. (C)
Confirmation of the C-terminal NC cleavage site by mutagenesis. HERV-K113 VLPs and F624D mutants were loaded on an 18% SDS-PAGE and
protein bands visualized by silver nitrate staining. (D) MALDI-TOF analysis of wt NC and the F624D mutant. The NC subdomains were purified by
RP-HPLC and trypsin digested before MALDI-TOF analysis. Peaks of the wt and of the F624D mutant are shown in the upper and lower spectra
respectively. The major peak of 1228.58 Da (framed) is unique for wt and the 3705.17 Da peak (framed) is unique for the F624D mutant. These
peaks match with the sequences âGQPQAPQQTGAFâ in the wt NC digest and âGQPQAPQQTGADPIQPFVPQGFQGQQPPLSQVFQGâ in the F624D
mutant. The peaks of approximately 1199 and 1303 Da visible in both spectra match with the expected trypsin fragments âQNITIQATTTGRâ and
âNGQPLSGNEQRâ from internal NC regions. Additional peaks could be assigned to trypsin generated NC peptides (not shown).

the most recently integrated human endogenous elements. All known HERV-K(HML-2) proviruses have
acquired multiple inactivating mutations or deletions
after integration into the host chromosomes, although
this does not rule out the possibility of infectious viruses
emerging by recombination or of functional proviruses
existing at a low prevalence within some human populations [17,36].
Despite accumulating evidence and growing interest in
the oncogenic and other pathogenic aspects of HERV-K
(HML-2)-encoded proteins, numerous fundamental
properties of these ancient retroviruses remain virtually
unknown. Studies of the virus and its proteins have

been complicated or even prevented by its many incapacitating deletions and mutations. Recently however, the
generation of two infectious HERV-K(HML-2) genomes
based on consensus sequences and the reconstruction of
the original HERV-K113 envelope gene have made it
possible to express functional viral proteins and particles
and hence study their properties [17-19]. Here, we used
a procedure already successfully employed to reconstitute the envelope protein of HERV-K113 [19] to ârepairâ
the gag-pro-pol region of the virus. This method
involves the identification and reversion of non-synonymous post-insertional mutations and allows discrimination between these positions and variations shared by a

minority of the fossil elements. It, therefore, yields a
protein sequence likely to be identical or very close to
that of the virus existing at the time of integration
approximately one million years ago [37]. To enhance
expression of the Gag precursor protein, we generated a
synthetic and partially codon-optimized sequence and
cloned it under the control of the CMV promoter.
Thin section electron microscopy revealed that cells
transfected transiently released a large number of retroviral particles. The presence of immature VLPs (with an
opaque ring surrounding a relatively electron-lucent
interior) and mature VLPs (with collapsed electron
dense cores) suggested the activity of a functional protease and the completion of a regular maturation process. In contrast to recently budded particles located
close to cells, pelleted supernatants only contained virions with spherical cores. This indicates that the vast
majority of particles undergo maturation after release
from the cell, but that it is somewhat delayed compared
with other retroviruses e.g. HIV. Whereas several processed viral proteins were detected in the pellets of cells
expressing the reconstituted and partially codon-optimized gag-pro-pol construct, only the 74 kDa Gag-precursor [32] was present in the supernatants of cells

expressing a protease defective mutant. Immunoblotting
with a combination of polyclonal sera raised against predicted domains of the HERV-K113 Gag protein and previously described monoclonal antibodies confirmed that
most of the major bands from viral pellets are Gag processing fragments and provided some preliminary information concerning their identity. The cleavage
fragments were further purified and separated by reverse
phase HPLC and, with the help of the specific sera and
antibodies, the fractions containing MA, CA and variant
forms of a p15 protein, presumed to reside between MA
and the CA domain, were identified. The identities of
the p15 variants and the CA and NC proteins were subsequently confirmed by N-terminal Edman sequencing
and mass spectrometry. N-terminal sequencing identified the exact locations of the cleavage sites releasing
these domains and the sites were subsequently confirmed by mutagenesis. Moreover, mass spectrometry of
the assumed NC subdomain provided strong evidence
for a further cleavage that eliminates a C-terminal glutamine- and proline-rich sequence of 42 amino acids (QPrich peptide) from the NC. A cleavage block introduced
at this position corroborated this and revealed a further
processing site that divides the 42 amino acid-long

George et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:30
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/30

sequence into the QP1 and QP2 peptides of 23 and 19
amino acids respectively. As no such intermediate was
detectable, cleavage at the NC-QP1 site seems to be
relatively rapid. All cleavage sites identified were found
to be highly conserved between HERV-K(HML-2) elements. Regarding the post-insertional mutations of the
HERV-K113 haplotype that was used for the reconstitution, only the A147V mutation is close enough to a cleavage site that it may considerably effect processing.
However, Ala and Val are both hydrophobic and not
branched; therefore, a significant impact on the cleavage
efficiency is rather unlikely [34]. Previously it has been
shown that the I516M mutation in this element blocks
particle formation and therefore replication [31].
The mechanism of site selection by retroviral PR
remains poorly understood. It is known that structural
requirements and approximately seven residues (positions P4 through P3â) of the substrate define a scissile
bond [34,38]. About 80% of all known PR cleavage sites
can be classified into one of two groups. Type 1 sites
have an aromatic residue in P1 and Pro at the P1â position while type 2 sites have a hydrophobic residue
(excluding Ile and Val) at P1 and prefer Val, Leu or Ala
at P1â [34,38,39]. Moreover, a type 1 site is always
located at the N-terminus of CA and a type 2 site is
usually present at the C-terminus of this domain. Our
results demonstrate that this is also true for the CA protein of HERV-K(HML-2). The CA domain of HERVK113, which forms the core of the mature virus, has a
calculated molecular mass of 27.7 kDa and a HERV-K
(HML-2) Gag cleavage product of comparable size has
been described previously [18,28].
The mature 10 kDa NC, adjacent to CA, contains
motifs for two zinc finger RNA binding domains (CysX2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys). It is interesting that the P1 and
P1â positions (Phe-624 and Pro-625) of the NC-QP1
scissile bond define it as type 1 and that both positions
match exactly with the site producing the N-terminus of
CA. Furthermore, type 1 cleavage sites are also present
at the NC-p6 junction in HIV-1/HIV-2 as well as at the
NC-p9 site of Equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV).
In contrast, the QP1-QP2 cleavage site is of type 2.
In addition to the QP-rich peptides, two major forms
(15 and 16.5 kDa) of an additional non-canonical protein that is encoded between the MA and CA subdomains were identified. These differ at the N-terminus by
a peptide of 14 amino acids. We infer that this is a
spacer peptide (SP1) present at analogous positions in
other retroviruses whose function it is to regulate the
maturation process [24,33,40]. The p16.5 protein is an
SP1-p15 processing intermediate and the p15 represents
the mature subdomain. This conclusion is in agreement
with results obtained by inhibiting MA-SP1 cleavage in
a P1 site mutant, which led to the accumulation of a

Page 11 of 15

slightly larger MA protein consistent with the size of
the MA-SP1 fragment. The mutated cleavage site
between the MA protein and the presumed spacer peptide SP1 fulfils the requirements for a type 2 site. The
mature MA protein of our prototypical HERV-K(HML2) has a calculated molecular mass of 15.3 kDa. This is
somewhat larger than the 11 kDa MA protein of the
closely related betaretroviruses MMTV and MPMV
(11.9 kDa) [41]. In contrast to the other Gag cleavage
sites identified here, the SP1-p15 site is neither of type 1
nor of type 2. The hydrophilic Asp residue in the P1
position of the scissile bond and the Tyr in P1â do not
conform to the sequence of a conventional PR cleavage
site. This raises the question of whether the retroviral
PR or a cellular peptidase is responsible for the activity
at this site. Such a peptidase could be a contaminant or
be part of the virion. Particle-bound cellular peptidases
engaged in Gag processing have been reported previously for at least murine leukaemia virus (MLV) and
Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) [42,43]. Although we cannot
exclude that a particle-associated or contaminating cellular peptidase is responsible for the cleavage or trimming at the atypical SP1-p15 site, we could demonstrate
by changing the Gly to Asp in the P1 position of the
CA-NC site (a type 2 site) that the HERV-K113 PR can
in principle tolerate a hydrophilic Asp residue at P1.
Although, compared to the wild type, cleavage of this
mutant was only partially reduced, an Asp at the P1
position of the p15-CA site (a type 1 site) almost completely abrogated hydrolysis. Therefore, an Asp at P1
does not preclude PR processing per se, but there are
other factors that determine cleavage effectiveness as
well. In a very recently publication the cleavage at this
site has also been documented investigating the Gag
processing of the HERV-K CON consensus virus [44].
Further studies are needed to precisely characterize the
processing at this site. The proteins between MA and
CA in beta-, gamma-, delta and alpharetroviruses are
often phosphorylated. The protein bands between the
p15 and p16.5 variants observed on SDS-PAGE might
therefore result from alternative phosphorylation, from
other post-translational modifications or from cryptic
cleavages within the SP1 sequence. The Gag subdomain
located between MA and CA of different retroviruses
differ in many aspects and have a wide range of functions [25,45-47]. In MPMV, RSV and MLV they encode
viral late domains and there is even a PTAP motive at
the C-terminus of the HERV-K(HML-2) p15 protein.
The presence of a substantial quantity of the 36 kDa
MA-SP1-p15 intermediate in our VLP preparations suggests that the cleavage at the p15-CA junction occurs at
a much higher rate than the liberation of mature MA
and p15 domains. The processing of the unconventional
SP1-p15 site particularly appears to proceed at a slow

George et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:30
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/30

rate. We hypothesize that to a very substantial degree,
SP1 and p15 remain uncleaved from the MA subdomain
after the mature core of a HERV-K(HML-2) particle has
already formed.

Conclusion
A prerequisite for the infectivity of retroviral particles is
a maturation process in which Gag precursor proteins
are cleaved at precise positions by the viral PR. In all
orthoretroviruses, proteolytic processing generates the
MA, CA, and NC proteins. Depending on the viral
genus and species several additional proteins and peptides are released. To characterize the Gag cleavage of
HERV-K(HML-2), we have recovered the original
sequence of the prototypical HERV-K113 element by
reversing post-insertional mutations acquired by the
provirus during chromosomal residency and have facilitated the expression and production of maturation-competent VLPs by partial codon optimization of the gagpro-pol region. The characterization of the liberated
mature Gag proteins and cleavage sites of HERV-K
(HML-2) will facilitate molecular cloning, allow a deeper
analysis of these proteins and should promote further
research into the maturation process of betaretroviruses.
Studies of retroviral evolution and phylogeny will also
benefit from a comparative analysis of the maturation
characteristics of this ancient virus and contemporary
retroviruses. Our results might also be of help in determining the underlying reasons for the structural and
functional handicaps of HERV-K(HML-2) particles
expressed in human tumours. Since HERV-K(HML-2)
expression is associated with a variety of cancers and
autoimmune diseases, a detailed knowledge of the fundamental viral characteristics may help us elucidate the
molecular and potentially pathogenic nature of this
association.
Materials and methods
Cell culture

HEK 293T cells were grown in complete Dulbeccoâs
modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 Î¼g/ml)
and L-glutamine (2 mM).

the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
(Stratagene).
Concentration of VLPs

4 Ã 10 6 HEK 293T cells were seeded into 100 mm
dishes and one day later transfected with 20 Î¼g plasmid
DNA using the calcium phosphate method. 48 hours
post-transfection the supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 3345 Ã g for 8 min and filtered through 0.45
Î¼m-pore-size membranes to remove cell debris. The
viral particles were then concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion at 175,000 Ã g for 3
h at 4Â°C. Viral pellets were resuspended in either 100 Î¼l
5 M urea containing 1% glacial acidic acid for high pressure liquid chromatography or in 0.05 M Hepes buffer,
pH 7.2 for Western blot analysis.
Electron microscopy

Two days post-transfection, cells were fixed with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M Hepes (pH 7.2) for 1 h at
room temperature before harvesting by scraping and
centrifugation (2000 Ã g). Cell pellets were post-fixed
with OsO4 (1% in ddH2O; Plano, Wetzlar, Germany),
block-stained with uranyl acetate (2% in ddH2O; Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany), dehydrated stepwise in graded
alcohol, immersed in propylenoxide and embedded in
Epon (Serva, Heidelberg) with polymerisation at 60Â°C
for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (60-80 nm) were cut using
an ultramicrotome (Ultracut S or UCT; Leica, Germany)
and stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
Transmission electron microscopy was performed with
an EM 902 (Zeiss) operated at 80 kV and the images
were digitised using a slow-scan charge-coupled-device
camera (Pro Scan; Scheuring, Germany).
For SEM, the transfected cells were immersed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (in 0.05 M Hepes buffer,
pH 7.2) and gently washed with distilled water prior to
postfixation (1% OsO4, 1 h). Samples were then rinsed
with distilled water, dehydrated with alcohol (30-96%),
critical point dried and sputter-coated with 7 nm goldpalladium (Polaron Sputter Coating Unit E 5100, GaLa
Instrumente, Bad Schwalbach). The samples were examined using a LEO 1530 scanning electron microscope
(Carl Zeiss SMT AG, Oberkochen) operated at 3 kV.

DNA synthesis, cloning and mutagenesis

Codon-optimization and production of synthetic HERVK(HML-2) sequences was conducted by the company
GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany) and has been described
previously [19]. The synthetic partially codon-optimized
gag-pro-pol sequence was cloned into the pcDNA3.1
vector using the Kpn I and Xho I restriction sites to
obtain the pcDNAoricoHERV-K_GagProPol construct.
Mutations to inactivate the PR and to substitute amino
acids adjacent to the cleavage site were performed using

Reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography

Protein separation was performed on an Agilent (Palo
Alto, CA) 1200 series binary HPLC fitted with a 4.6 Ã
150 mm 3.5 micron Zorbax 300SB-C8 reverse-phase
column (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The column was maintained at 40Â°C. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and solvent B of 0.08% trifluoroacetic
acid in acetonitrile. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate
of 0.5 ml/min from 8-58 min and 1 ml/min from 0-6

George et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:30

min and 60-62 min employing the following gradient:
solvent B, 0-6 min, 0%; 8 min, 15%; 49 min, 40%; 58
min, 95%; 58-60 min, 95%; 62 min, 0%. The eluate was
monitored at 280 nm and 0.5 ml fractions were
collected.
Sample preparation for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry

Following evaporation to dryness proteins of each HPLC
fraction were dissolved in 20 Î¼l of TA2 (2:1 (v/v) mixture of 100% acetonitrile and 0.3% TFA). 1 Î¼l of each
fraction was spotted onto a 384-spot polished steel target plate (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and
mixed with 1 Î¼l alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid
(HCCA) solution (6 mg/ml in TA2) and air dried.

to 5000 Da was performed in the reflectron mode. Spectra were obtained by averaging up to 3000 laser shots
acquired at a fixed laser power, which had been set to
the minimum laser power necessary for ionization of
selected samples before starting the analyses. The mass
spectra were visualized and processed using FlexAnalysis
software and sequence tag hints were obtained by analyzing tandem MS spectra employing the Biotools 3.0
software (Bruker Daltonics). For N-terminal sequencing
by Edman degradation, proteins were separated by
sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), blotted to a PVDF membrane
and stained with Ponceau S. Protein bands of the
expected size were cut out and sent for sequencing
(Proteome Factory, Berlin, Germany).

Parameters of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry

Mass spectra were collected by an Autoflex I mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). The instrument was controlled by Brukerâs FlexControl 3.0 data collection
software and was equipped with a UV-nitrogen laser (l =
337 nm). MS measurements were carried out in linear
mode using an acceleration voltage of 20.00, or 18.45 kV
(ion source 1 and 2), respectively. Lens voltage was 6.70
kV. Spectra were stored in mass range between 0.7-10
kDa and 2-20 kDa, depending on the expected size of the
peptides. External calibration was performed employing
protein calibration standard I and peptide calibration
standard II, respectively (Bruker Daltonics). To achieve a
high signal to noise ratio each spectrum represents the
integration of at least 600 individual laser shots. In order
to determine the exact positions of the N- and C-terminal ends of the processed Gag fragments the respective
proteins were digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides
were purified using ZipTip C18 tips (Millpore, Bedford,
MA, USA) and measured in the reflectron mode using an
acceleration voltage of 19.40, or 16.90 kV (ion source 1
and 2), respectively. Lens voltage was 8 kV. Spectra were
stored in the mass range between 0.7-4 kDa. Mass peaks
that did not correspond to tryptic peptides predicted by
theoretical in silico tryptic digests were further analysed
by MS/MS to generate sequence information.
De novo protein sequencing

Sequencing by MALDI-TOF MS was carried out under
the control of FlexControl software (Bruker Daltonics)
using an Ultraflex II MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a near infrared
solid state smartbeamâ¢ laser Nd:YAG laser (l = 1064
nm) which operated at 100 Hz. Fractions containing target peptides were identified by recording spectra in linear positive mode with external calibration using a
standard mixture of peptides. In order to assign a mass
window for fragmentation and peptide sequencing in
the âLIFTâ MS/MS mode, an exploratory scan from 2000

Immunization

Alignments of several Gag proteins of betaretroviruses
closely related to HERV-K113 provided clues to the
putative Gag subdomains (data not shown). Accordingly,
three fragments with sequences corresponding to the
putative MA subdomain (amino acids 1-100), the putative p15 subdomain (140-282) and the putative CA subdomain (283-526) were generated. Each fragment was
inserted into the pET16b vector (Novagen, Gibbstown,
USA), expressed in BL21 E. coli and affinity purified on
a Ni-NTA column. Proteins were eluted in 8 M urea
and dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
100 Î¼g of recombinant Gag-protein fragments were
then used for immunization of Wistar rats and sera collected throughout the period of four immunizations.
These animal experiments were performed according to
institutional and state guidelines.
SDS gel, silver nitrate staining and Western blot analysis

Virus particles were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer
(Bio-Rad), briefly boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The
proteins were then visualized by silver nitrate staining
using the Bio-Rad Silver Stain Kit or blotted using the
semidry transfer method to a PVDF membrane (Roth).
After transfer, blots were blocked in blocking buffer (PBS,
5% skim milk powder, 0.1% Tween) and incubated with
the appropriate primary antibodies. Visualization of the
proteins was achieved using secondary antibodies coupled
to horseradish peroxidise, enhanced chemiluminescence
reagents and autoradiographic film.
