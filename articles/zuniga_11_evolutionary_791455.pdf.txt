Evolutionary history of the OmpR/IIIA family of
signal transduction two component systems in
Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae

Abstract
Background: Two component systems (TCS) are signal transduction pathways which typically consist of a sensor
histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR). In this study, we have analyzed the evolution of TCS of the
OmpR/IIIA family in Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae, two families belonging to the group of lactic acid
bacteria (LAB). LAB colonize nutrient-rich environments such as foodstuffs, plant materials and the gastrointestinal
tract of animals thus driving the study of this group of both basic and applied interest.
Results: The genomes of 19 strains belonging to 16 different species have been analyzed. The number of TCS
encoded by the strains considered in this study varied between 4 in Lactobacillus helveticus and 17 in Lactobacillus
casei. The OmpR/IIIA family was the most prevalent in Lactobacillaceae accounting for 71% of the TCS present in
this group. The phylogenetic analysis shows that no new TCS of this family has recently evolved in these
Lactobacillaceae by either lineage-specific gene expansion or domain shuffling. Furthermore, no clear evidence of
non-orthologous replacements of either RR or HK partners has been obtained, thus indicating that coevolution of
cognate RR and HKs has been prevalent in Lactobacillaceae.
Conclusions: The results obtained suggest that vertical inheritance of TCS present in the last common ancestor
and lineage-specific gene losses appear as the main evolutionary forces involved in their evolution in
Lactobacillaceae, although some HGT events cannot be ruled out. This would agree with the genomic analyses of
Lactobacillales which show that gene losses have been a major trend in the evolution of this group.

Background
Two component systems (TCS) are widespread signal
transduction pathways mainly found in bacteria where
they play a major role in adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Nevertheless, they can also be
found in some eukaryotes and archaea. Numerous studies have shown the involvement of TCS in a broad
range of adaptive processes such as sporulation, nitrogen
regulation, phosphate regulation, cell envelope stress
response, pathogenicity, motility, etc. [1]. TCS typically
consist of a sensor histidine kinase (HK), usually membrane-bound, and a cytoplasmic response regulator
(RR). HKs and RRs are modular proteins containing

homologous and heterologous domains [2,3]. The
homologous domains, kinase domain and H-box in HKs
and receptor domain in RR, are involved in the phosphotransfer reaction whereas the heterologous domains,
sensor (HKs) and effector (RR) domains, are involved in
the reception of a specific stimulus and the corresponding response, respectively.
In the most basic scheme, upon detection of a stimulus, the HK autophosphorylates in a conserved His residue at the H-box and subsequently transfers the
phosphate group to a conserved aspartyl residue at the
receptor domain of the RR. Phosphorylation of the RR
modulates its activity and in most cases it functions as a
transcriptional regulator [1]. In addition, more complex
phosphotransfer relays also exist which involve multiple
phosphotransfer reactions among domains that can be
found on separate polypeptides or as part of multidomain proteins [4-6]. Furthermore, some HKs also

contain PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domains [7], possibly
involved in sensing redox potential, HAMP domains
(Histidine kinases, Adenylyl cyclases, Methyl binding
proteins, Phosphatases) which have been proposed to
transmit the stimulus from the sensor domain to the
H-box and kinase domains [8] or a second type of
His-domain termed HPt which functions as an intermediate phosphate receiver and donor in complex phosphorelays [1]. In some cases, TCS also include auxiliary
proteins that regulate the activities of the HK or that
influence the stability of RR phosphorylation [9].
TCS are found in varying numbers in bacteria
although, generally, bacteria with larger genomes encode
more TCS [10,11]. In addition, free-living bacteria
usually harbour more TCS than pathogenic bacteria [4],
suggesting a correlation between metabolic versatility
and number of TCS [10]. Data from complete genome
sequencing projects have shown that TCS-specific
domains rank among the most common protein
domains found in bacteria. This has led to the development of specialised databases such as MiST [12] or
P2CS [13] and to the proposal of a number of classification schemes. Some researchers have based TCS classifications on phylogenetic reconstructions of conserved
domains [4,14-16]. A second approach has made use of
the domain composition of TCS proteins [17,18]. Notwithstanding, the results of most classifications agree to
a considerable extent and have shown that the majority
of TCS proteins belong to a limited number of families
which share common ancestry and domain structure
[19]. Furthermore, TCS are usually encoded by adjacent
genes (although orphan genes can also be found) and
are arranged in the same order and orientation [4].
The evolutionary history of TCS has also been the
subject of a number of studies [19]. Koretke et al. [4]
studied the TCS proteins encoded in 18 genomes (12
bacteria, 4 archaea and 2 eukaryotes). From their phylogenetic analyses they concluded that TCS systems originated in bacteria and were acquired by archaea and
eukaryotes by multiple horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
events. They also concluded that coevolution of cognate
HKs and RRs has been prevalent, although some examples of recruitment were also detected, mostly in hybrid
HKs. Furthermore, coevolution is also prevalent at the
domain level, so that domain shuffling or swapping have
been relatively rare events [4,20]. A subsequent study
focused on HKs present in 207 genomes modified to
some extent this view [21]. The analysis of this dataset
revealed that many bacteria carry a large repertoire of
recently evolved HKs as a result of lineage-specific gene
expansion (LSE) or HGT and species-specific preference
for either of these two modes of acquisition of new
TCS. For example, genomes with large numbers of HKs
relative to their genome size tended to accumulate HKs

by LSE. In addition, whereas TCS acquired by HGT
tended to be organized in operons, those arising from
LSE were much more likely to show as “orphans” separated from their cognate RRs [21]. The origin of TCS
also correlated with the frequency of subsequent gene
rearrangements. For instance, whereas 47.4% of HGTacquired HKs conserved the same domain composition,
only 29.1% of LSE-acquired HKs retained the same
domain structure as their closest paralogs [21].
Other studies have focused on TCS systems present in
particular bacterial groups [18,22-25]. These studies
have not shown great discrepancies with the conclusions
from general studies although they have provided a
more detailed picture of the corresponding evolutionary
scenarios. For example, the study of TCS systems in
Pseudomonas has shown a significant contribution of
gene recruitment in the evolution of the NarL-group of
TCS whereas coevolution was prevalent in the OmpRgroup [24]. In summary, the results obtained so far indicate that all TCS share a common ancestor from which
major families have evolved by duplication and divergence. This process has continued during bacterial evolution with the acquisition of new sensor or effector
capabilities via domain shuffling [19].
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) constitute a group of obligate fermentative microorganisms that produce lactic
acid as the main product of sugar degradation. This
characteristic has been exploited to produce a variety of
fermented products since the acidification and enzymatic processes associated to their growth prevent the
proliferation of detrimental organisms and pathogens
and confer the characteristic flavor and texture of these
products. Furthermore, some strains, especially lactobacilli that colonize the gastrointestinal tract of humans
and animals, are considered as probiotics [26,27]. LAB
have been isolated from a wide range of sources including a variety of foodstuffs, beverages, plants and the gastrointestinal tract of animals. Taxonomically, LAB are
classified within the order Lactobacillales which encompasses the families Aerococcaceae, Carnobacteriaceae,
Enterococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Leuconostocaceae and
Streptococcaceae. However, phylogenetic analyses do not
support the distinction between Leuconostocaceae and
Lactobacillaceae [28]. For this reason, throughout this
study the term Lactobacillaceae will be used to refer to
species currently classified within the families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. The genome sequences
of a number of Lactobacillaceae species from different
ecological niches are currently available thus enabling
comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses. An
important conclusion from these studies is that lineagespecific gene loss has been extensive in the evolution of
Lactobacillales [29]. However, no study on the evolution
of TCS in this bacterial group has been carried out yet.

A number of physiological studies have dealt with the
functional role of TCS in LAB. These studies have
shown the involvement of some TCS in quorum sensing
and production of bacteriocins [30-33], the stress
response in some species of this group [34-36] and
malic acid metabolism in Lactobacillus casei [37]. These
results suggest that TCS may have played a role in the
adaptation of LAB to the different ecological niches that
they occupy. Therefore, the phylogenetic analysis of
TCS present in LAB may provide insight into the evolutionary processes involved in the adaptation of LAB to
the different habitats they colonize and into the functional role of as yet uncharacterized TCS. The aim of
this work is thus to explore the evolution of TCS in
Lactobacillaceae. To this end we have focused in the
OmpR/IIIA family since they are the most widely distributed in this bacterial group. The prototypic Escherichia coli OmpR EnvZ system was originally identified as
regulating the expression of the porin-encoding genes
ompF and ompC in response to medium osmolarity
[38]. Later studies have shown the involvement of members of this family in varied physiological processes. To
put some examples, OmpR/IIIA TCSs are involved in
nitrogen metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor [39] or
phosphate metabolism in E. coli [40]and Bacillus subtilis
[41]. Furthermore, some orthologous systems control
different processes in different bacteria, such as the
YycFG TCS which has been involved in cell division,

cell wall biosynthesis or virulence factor expression,
among other functions [42].

Results and discussion
Number, distribution and classification of TCS present in
Lactobacillaceae

The number of TCS-encoding genes harbored by the
strains considered in this study varied between 8, in Lactobacillus helveticus DPC 4571, and 33 in Lactobacillus casei
BL23 and L. casei ATCC 334 (Table 1). Taking the Bacteria domain as a whole, a correlation between genome
size and the number of encoded TCS was observed [17].
The genomes of the Lactobacillaceae strains considered
here have very similar genome sizes with an average of
about 2 Mb, except L. casei and Lactobacillus plantarum
(Table 1). Hence, this correlation cannot be observed
although the strains with the largest genomes encode the
highest numbers of TCS genes (Figure 1A). Additionally,
no correlation was observed between the main habitat of
the strains and the number of TCS genes in their genomes
(Figure 1B). Several authors have observed that species
with complex lifestyles, colonizing varied environments or
possessing numerous alternative metabolic pathways tend
to encode larger complements of signal-transducing
proteins [10,21]. The lack of differences between Lactobacillaceae isolated from distinct environments likely reflects
the low metabolic diversity within this group and their
similar lifestyles and it also suggests that they do not have

No hybrid HKs were encoded by any strain included

accounted for a very small fraction of the total (10

The TCS present in Lactobacillaceae were classified
according to the schemes of Fabret et al. [15] for HKs and
Galperin [17] for RRs. The classification of HKs is based
on the comparison of the amino-acid sequence of the
region around the phosphorylatable histidine [15]. This
analysis divided the HKs present in B. subtilis into five
classes (I, II, IIIA, IIIB and IV). The classification of RRs is
based primarily on their domain architectures and structures of the constituent domains [17]. Most HKs and RRs
could be accommodated within these classification
schemes. The only exceptions corresponded to a group of
HKs associated to LytR RRs, which correspond to the
HPK10 family of the classification of Grebe and Stock [14],
and a group of RRs homologous to the E. coli CitB not
included in Galperin’s classification [17]. A strong correlation in the association of families of HKs and RR was
observed in Lactobacillaceae, for example, IIIA HKs are
invariably associated to OmpR RRs. This correlation has
been previously pointed out as a common feature of TCS
[4,14,15] and led to Grebe and Stock to propose that many
HKs and their cognate RRs have evolved as integral units
[14], a view in agreement with the coevolution model [4].
A summary of the types of TCS found in each strain
is shown in Table 2 and detailed lists of TCS identified
in each strain are provided in the additional file 1. By
far, the OmpR/IIIA family was the most prevalent in
Lactobacillaceae, accounting for 71% of the TCS present
in this group (Table 2). Furthermore, this is the only
family present in all the strains included in this study.

For these reasons, we focused our attention in this
family for subsequent analyses.
Identification and analysis of clusters of orthologs in the
OmpR/IIIA family of TCS

Preliminary identification of clusters of orthologs of RR
and HK sequences was performed by creating an orthology table of the 19 genomes used in this study using
the clustering algorithm implemented in MBGD [43]
and manually checking the clusters of orthologs
thus obtained for each previously identified TCS gene.
The clusters were named according to the following criteria: when a putative ortholog with characterized function was identified, the cluster was named after this
ortholog; if no functionally characterized ortholog was
found, the group was named after the locus tag of a
representative sequence of the cluster. The clusters of
orthologs are listed in Table 3.
A phylogenetic reconstruction was performed in order
to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the clusters identified in MBGD. Lactobacillaceae sequences
and selected outgroup sequences (see Methods) were
aligned with Muscle and the alignments subsequently
refined with Gblocks. The resulting datasets consisted in
147 sequences with 96 conserved positions for the HK
alignment and 149 sequences and 158 conserved positions for the RR alignment (additional file 3).
ProtTest was used to determine the best fit model of
amino acid substitution. Model LG [44] with a discrete

gamma distribution to account for heterogeneity in evolutionary rates among sites, an estimation of the proportion of invariant sites and the empirical frequencies of
amino acids (LG+G+I+F) was identified as the best fit
model for both datasets. The phylogenetic information
content of the datasets was then evaluated by using likelihood mapping. Briefly, this analysis enables to estimate
the suitability for phylogenetic reconstruction of a data
set from the proportion of unresolved quartets in a
maximum likelihood analysis. The analysis was carried
out using TreePuzzle with the WAG [45] model of substitution (the second best model selected by ProtTest)
since the LG model is not implemented in this program.
On the basis of ProtTest results, the datasets were analysed with a discrete gamma distribution and the
empirical amino acids frequencies (WAG+G+F). The
likelihood mapping showed that both datasets contained
relatively low phylogenetic information, with only 68.2%
and 77.7% fully resolved quartets in HKs and RRs,
respectively (Fig. S1 in additional file 3).
The phylogenetic reconstructions were performed with
PhyML using the LG+G+I+F model (Figure 2 and Fig. S2
in additional file 3). In accordance with the results of the
likelihood mapping, very few nodes had bootstrap support values higher than 75%. Most clusters of orthologs
identified in MBGD could be distinguished in the RR
tree, although some of them were not supported (clusters
950, Bce, Cia and Ycl2), and in other groups some outgroup sequences did not cluster with their corresponding
Lactobacillaceae counterparts (clusters 1209, Kin and
Ycl1; see Figure 2 and Fig. S2 in additional file 2).
Furthermore, the orphan RRs Lreu_1569 and LAF_1230
encoded by Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus fermentum, respectively, constituted a separate cluster (Figure 2 and Fig. S2 in additional file 2). However, these
genes were located next to a gene cluster encoding a
putative phosphate uptake system homologous to those
located next to Pho TCS (Fig. S3 in additional file 2).
The HK tree was less resolved, as expected from the
likelihood mapping result, and in many cases outgroup
sequences did not cluster with their corresponding Lactobacillaceae counterparts. Furthermore, some clusters
were not observed in the HK phylogenetic reconstruction. HKs belonging to clusters Pho and 872 constituted
one cluster (although with low support in their basal
nodes; Figure 2). HKs belonging to clusters Ycl1 and
Ycl2 were identified by MBGD as belonging to the same
cluster of orthologs and the phylogenetic analysis also
suggested a relationship between these two clusters.
However, the phylogenetic reconstruction and MBGD
clustering indicated that Ycl1 and Ycl2 RRs constituted
separate clusters of orthologs.
In order to determine whether the above mentioned
incongruent cases were due to the low resolution of the

Page 6 of 15

trees or they indicated wrong assignments of clusters of
orthologs, detailed analyses of Ycl1 and Ycl2 HKs, Pho
and 872 RRs and HKs, and Eta and Kin RRs and HKs
were carried out.
HK sequences belonging to groups Ycl1 and Ycl2 were
aligned, resulting in a dataset of 233 sites after trimming
the initial alignment with Gblocks (additional file 3).
The best fit model for this dataset was LG+G+I+F. The
likelihood mapping (using again WAG+G+F) showed an
increase in phylogenetic signal compared to the complete HK dataset (89% resolved quartets; Fig. S4 in additional file 2). The phylogenetic analysis of Ycl1 and Ycl2
HKs showed that Ycl1 and Ycl2 formed separate clusters
with strong support that included their corresponding
outgroup sequences (Figure 3) with the exception of the
putative Ycl1 sequences of Clostridium botulinum and
Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. This result confirms
that they constitute two different clusters of orthologs.
Pho and 872 RRs and HKs were aligned and trimmed,
resulting in 193 and 239 site datasets, respectively (additional file 3). ProtTest analysis also selected LG+G+I+F as
the best fit model for both datasets. Likelihood mapping
analysis also showed an increase in phylogenetic signal in
the HK dataset (85.5% resolved quartets; Fig. S4 in additional file 2) but the phylogenetic signal in the RR dataset
was slightly lower than in the complete OmpR dataset
(73.3% resolved quartets for Pho and 872 vs. 77.7% for the
OmpR dataset; Fig. S4 in additional file 2). The phylogenetic reconstruction of Pho and 872 HKs (Figure 4) separated both groups, thus confirming that they constitute
separate clusters of orthologs. The phylogenetic reconstruction of Pho RR also showed the separation between
Pho and 872 clusters. Furthermore, the orphan genes
Lreu_1569 and LAF_1230 appeared in a long branch
within the other Pho sequences (Figure 4). Although the
basal nodes were not supported in the maximum likelihood reconstruction, the position of these two sequences
in the phylogenetic tree and the analysis of their genomic
context (Fig. S3 in additional file 2) strongly suggest that
they belong to the Pho cluster of orthologs.
Eta and Kin sequences were also identified as separate
clusters of orthologs; however, the phylogenetic reconstructions of RR and HKs suggested that they might
constitute a cluster of orthologs. In order to ascertain
this point a detailed analysis of these groups was also
carried out. The trimmed alignments of the corresponding HK and RR sequences consisted of 262 and 203
conserved sites, respectively (additional file 3). ProtTest
selected LG+G+I+F for the HK dataset and LG+G for
the RR dataset. The likelihood mapping analysis (using
WAG+G+F) showed an increase in phylogenetic signal
for both datasets (85% and 89.1% resolved quartets for
HK and RRs, respectively; Fig. S4 in additional file 2).
The ML reconstruction showed that Eta and Kin

sequences were clearly separated with strong support,
thus demonstrating that they constitute separate clusters
of orthologs (Figure 5).
In summary, the phylogenetic reconstructions of
OmpR RRs and IIIA HKs showed the clustering of the
Lactobacillaceae orthologous sequences with their corresponding outgroup sequences thus indicating that the
TCS systems present in Lactobacillaceae have not
resulted from duplications (lineage-specific gene expansion) after the differentiation of this taxonomical group.
This result suggests that these systems either were present in the last common ancestor of the group or that
they were acquired by HGT during the evolution of this
group.
Distribution of clusters of orthologs in the reference tree

In order to gain insight on the origin of the OmprR/IIIA
TCS present in Lactobacillaceae, we compared their distribution with a concatenated reference species tree
(Figure 6). The reference tree was derived from a
139204 sites dataset obtained from the Gblocks-trimmed

concatenated alignments of 141 genes (see Methods).
The tree was obtained by maximum likelihood using the
(GTR+G+I+F) nucleotide substitution model [46]
selected with jModelTest. The topology of the tree was
essentially the same as that obtained by Claesson et al.
[28] and the four groups identified by these authors
were also identified in this phylogenetic reconstruction
(Figure 6).
Clusters of orthologs with only one Lactobacillaceae
sequence were not considered, as this analysis cannot
provide clues about their origin. The widespread distribution of clusters Cro, Eta (only absent in Oenococcus
oeni), and Yyc strongly suggests that they were present
in the last common ancestor of Lactobacillaceae. Similarly, the distribution of Pho can be explained by lineage-specific gene losses in the last common ancestor of
group A and in O. oeni. Alternative scenarios would
require three independent HGT events in the last common ancestor of group B, the last common ancestor of
group C, and the last common ancestor of Leuconostoc
mesenteroides and Leuconostoc citreum or two HGT
events in the last common ancestors of group C and
groups B and D and a subsequent lineage-specific gene
loss in O. oeni. The distribution of the Ycl1 cluster also
points to its presence in the last common ancestor of
Lactobacillaceae, with a subsequent lineage-specific
gene loss in group D. The origin of other clusters is
more controversial: the distribution of Kin sequences
could be explained by five HGT events or seven lineagespecific gene losses; the distribution of Cia by three
HGT events or six lineage-specific gene losses; the distribution of Bce by four HGT events or five lineagespecific gene losses, and, the distribution of Bil by one
HGT or two lineage-specific gene losses. Although
future analyses with more sequences may shed light on
the phylogenetic history of these clusters, it is worth
mentioning that if they had resulted from HGT events
these must have occurred long ago, because clearly
orthologous genes are shared by distantly related strains
within the Lactobacillaceae.
Phylogenetic analyses of Cro, Eta and Yyc clusters of
orthologs

As we have just seen, most TCS of the OmpR/IIIA
family have a limited distribution in Lactobacillaceae
(Table 3) making it difficult to obtain reliable information about their evolutionary history. Only two systems,
Cro and Yyc are present in all the strains used in this
study. In addition, Eta TCS is also present in all the
strains except O. oeni. Hence, we selected these three
systems to further analyze two points. Firstly, we were
interested on the relative roles of coevolution and gene
recruitment in the evolution of the OmpR/IIIA family in
Lactobacillaceae. Secondly, we wanted to determine

whether vertical inheritance could explain the phylogenetic relationships of the OmpR/IIIA TCS.
For this purpose, the nucleotide sequences of the
genes encoding the RR and HK of the Cro, Eta and Yyc
clusters were aligned resulting in datasets of 684 and
1011 (RR and HK, respectively) sites for Cro, 678 and
1041 for Eta, and, 693 and 1752 for Yyc. The GTR+G+I
+F was identified as the best substitution model by jModelTest. Likelihood mapping showed limited phylogenetic signal, especially in the RR datasets (70.4%, 76.5%
and 72.9% resolved quartets for Cro, Eta and Yyc RR
datasets, respectively; 83%, 79.9% and 83.3% for the HK
datasets; Fig. S5 in additional file 3). The phylogenetic
reconstructions of HKs and RRs (Figure 7) showed, in
accordance with the likelihood mapping results, that
only a few nodes of the phylogenetic tree had support
values higher than 75%. Comparisons between both
trees and the reference tree were evaluated with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH; see Methods) to determine
whether the likelihood of the data associated to each
tree was significantly different at an alpha level of 0.05
(a value above the threshold indicating a non-significant
difference).

The analysis of Cro sequences showed that the HK
dataset rejected the topologies of the reference and the
RR tree (p = 0.047 and p = 0.026, respectively) whereas
the RR dataset did not reject any of the two other topologies (p = 0.317 and p = 0.18 for the reference tree and
the HK tree, respectively). This discrepancy could be
partly due to the low resolution of the trees. Therefore,
a concatenated alignment of the HK and RR datasets
was built in order to increase the phylogenetic signal.
The likelihood mapping of the concatenated alignment
(Fig. S5 in additional file 2) showed an increase in the
phylogenetic signal of the dataset (86.9% resolved quartets) compared to the HK and RR cognate datasets. The
phylogenetic reconstruction obtained with the concatenated dataset was similar to that obtained with the HK
dataset (although the positions of Lactobacillus brevis,
Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Pediococcus pentosaceus changed; see Figure 7). The ShimodairaHasegawa test of the concatenated dataset showed that
this dataset did not reject the reference, HK or RR
topologies (p = 0.089, p = 0.663 and p = 0.297, respectively). Considering that the concatenated alignment
included the phylogenetic signal of the HK and RR

datasets and that both topologies were not rejected by
the SH test, we concluded that both genes share the
same evolutionary history in Lactobacillaceae and, given
that the reference topology was not rejected either, that
vertical inheritance can explain the evolution of this
TCS within this group.
The analyses of the Eta datasets showed that the HK
dataset rejected the RR topology but not the reference
topology (p = 0.041 and p = 0.386, respectively). On the
contrary the RR dataset rejected both the reference
topology and the HK (p = 0.014 and p = 0.008). A more
detailed examination of the two topologies revealed that
group A in the reference tree (Figure 6) was also found
in the HK and RR trees for the Eta datasets, where it
was recovered with 100% bootstrap support (Figure 7).
However, the relationships among the other three
groups changed quite dramatically. Group D still
appeared in the two trees, but it was no longer a sister
group to group B for the HK sequences and it clustered
within them. This makes group B to be paraphyletic for
HK. Furthermore, group C sequences did not group in
the HK tree and appeared at the base of a B/D clade. A
similar case occurred for the RR tree, in which group B
was paraphyletic due to the inclusion of group C
sequences. Since the RR dataset rejected both the HK
and the reference topologies, it can be hypothesized that
some evolutionary events, apart from vertical inheritance, occurred during the evolutionary history of this
cluster. However, the possibility that these sequences do
not hold enough phylogenetic signal for deriving their
true relationships cannot be ruled out and in order to
derive reliable conclusions more sequences will be
necessary.
For Yyc sequences, the comparison of the HK dataset
with the RR and the reference tree showed that whereas
the topology of the RR tree was rejected (p = 0.000) the
topology of the reference tree was not significantly different (p = 0.466). On the other hand, the RR dataset
did not reject the HK topology (p = 0.064) nor that of
the reference tree (p = 0.111). Taking into account the
low resolution of the RR tree the results of these tests
indicate that there are no significant differences between
the topologies obtained with the two datasets and that
these topologies are not significantly different to that
obtained with the reference tree. We conclude therefore
that both genes share the same evolutionary history and
that vertical inheritance explains the phylogenetic relationships between the different sequences.
In summary, the analyses of the evolutionary history
of these three TCS in this bacterial group do not provide evidence against a parallel evolution of the two
genes, with no signs of gene recruitment and a vertical
signal explaining their evolution. Therefore, and taking
into account the results obtained from the analysis of

Page 12 of 15

the distribution of these systems, our results indicate
that Cro and Yyc systems (and possibly also Eta) were
present in the last common ancestor of Lactobacillaceae
and have been conserved during the evolution of this
group.

Conclusions
The phylogenetic analysis of the OmpR/IIIA systems in
Lactobacillaceae shows that no new TCS of this family has
recently evolved in this group by either lineage-specific
gene expansion or domain shuffling. Furthermore, no
clear evidence for non-orthologous replacements of either
RR or HK partners has been obtained. Therefore, our
results strongly suggest that coevolution of cognate RR
and HKs has been prevalent in Lactobacillaceae. Furthermore, no evidence of recent HGT events has been found
for the systems present in more than one species of the
group. The detailed analysis of three systems present in
most strains used in this study indicates that vertical
inheritance has been prevalent in the evolution of these
systems. However, a different picture might emerge from
the analysis of the other 6 TCS included in this work.
Their non-universal distribution in the group of Lactobacillaceae species considered can be explained by differential gains and/or losses, which at present cannot be
resolved. For this purpose, more complete genome
sequences of Lactobacillaceae strains and species are
necessary.
The picture that emerges from the study of the
OmpR/IIIA TCS is that evolution of Lactobacillaceae
from their last common ancestor and the adaptation
process to the habitats that they currently occupy did
not require the development of new TCS from systems
previously present. Instead, vertical inheritance of TCS
present in the last common ancestor and lineage-specific
gene losses appear as the main evolutionary forces
involved. Although HGT cannot be ruled out, it is
worth mentioning that no evidence of recent HGT
events have been obtained. This view would agree with
the genomic analyses of Lactobacillales [29,47] which
show that gene losses have been a major trend in the
evolution of this group.
Methods
Sequences, alignments and phylogenetic information
analysis

TCS-encoding genes corresponding to 19 completely
sequence genomes of Lactobacillaceae/Leuconostocaceae
(Table 1) were identified by using the tools provided by
the Microbial Genome Database for Comparative Analysis (MBGD; http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/) [43]. Briefly, an
orthology table of all genes present in the 19 genomes
was obtained using the clustering algorithm implemented in MBGD. The orthology table was queried for

Zúñiga et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/34

response regulators and histidine kinases in order to
retrieve the corresponding genes. The genes were confirmed as RRs or HKs by checking the presence of typical conserved domains. Due to the low similarity at the
nucleotide level observed in both datasets, amino acid
sequences were used for subsequent analyses. In order
to obtain additional sequences that might have been
bypassed in the first search, similarity searches were performed with BLASTP [48] with the genomic BLAST service provided by the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/
genom_table.cgi) against the 19 genomes using a representative sequence of each cluster of orthologs previously identified. In order to obtain putative outgroup
sequences for each cluster of orthologs identified, a
representative sequence of each cluster was used to
query the non-redundant protein sequence database at
the NCBI using BLASTP. Sequences not belonging to
Lactobacillaceae that scored the lowest E-values were
selected and checked to belong to the same orthology
group than the corresponding query sequence in
MBGD. At least two sequences were used as putative
outgroup sequences for each cluster of orthologs.
Detailed information on the sequences used in these
analyses is provided in additional file 1. Multiple alignments were obtained with Muscle [49]. Gaps and positions of doubtful homology were removed using
Gblocks [50]. The final multiple alignments used for the
analyses are available in additional file 3.
Phylogenetic reconstruction

In order to obtain accurate phylogenies, the best fit model
of amino acid substitution was selected using ProtTest
[51]. The AIC, which allows for a comparison of likelihoods from non-nested models, was adopted to select the
best models [52]. The phylogenetic signal contained in the
different data sets was assessed by likelihood mapping [53]
using Tree-Puzzle 5.2 [54]. The models selected by ProtTest were implemented in PhyML [55] to obtain maximum likelihood trees for the different alignments.
Bootstrap support values were obtained from 1,000 pseudorandom replicates. Congruence among topologies for
TCS genes and/or the reference species tree (see below)
was evaluated using Shimodaira-Hasegawa’s test [56]
implemented in TreePuzzle 5.2 [54] and, when necessary,
represented graphically using TreeMap [57].
Construction of a reference tree

The 141 core proteins identified by Claesson et al. [28]
were used to obtain a reference phylogenetic tree for the
19 strains considered in the analysis. The nucleotide
sequences were retrieved from MBGD. The sequences
were translated into amino acids, aligned with ClustalW
and the corresponding nucleotide sequences realigned on

Page 13 of 15

the basis of the amino acid alignment using MEGA 4 [58].
Gaps and positions of doubtful homology were removed
using Gblocks [50] with default parameters. The resulting
multiple alignments were concatenated using the tool
available in the Phylemon suite [59]. The best fit model of
nucleotide substitution was selected using jModelTest ver.
0.1.1 [60] with the AIC criterion. The phylogenetic reconstruction by maximum likelihood was obtained with
PhyML using the previously selected evolutionary model.
