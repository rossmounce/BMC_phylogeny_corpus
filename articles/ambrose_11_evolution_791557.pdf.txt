Evolution of the nuclear ribosomal DNA
intergenic spacer in four species of the
Daphnia pulex complex
Cheryl D Ambrose, Teresa J Crease*

Abstract
Background: Concerted evolution refers to the pattern in which copies of multigene families show high
intraspecific sequence homogeneity but high interspecific sequence diversity. Sequence homogeneity of these
copies depends on relative rates of mutation and recombination, including gene conversion and unequal crossing
over, between misaligned copies. The internally repetitive intergenic spacer (IGS) is located between the genes for
the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs. To identify patterns of recombination and/or homogenization within IGS repeat
arrays, and to identify regions of the IGS that are under functional constraint, we analyzed 13 complete IGS
sequences from 10 individuals representing four species in the Daphnia pulex complex.
Results: Gene conversion and unequal crossing over between misaligned IGS repeats generates variation in copy
number between arrays, as has been observed in previous studies. Moreover, terminal repeats are rarely involved in
these events. Despite the occurrence of recombination, orthologous repeats in different species are more similar to
one another than are paralogous repeats within species that diverged less than 4 million years ago. Patterns
consistent with concerted evolution of these repeats were observed between species that diverged 8-10 million
years ago. Sequence homogeneity varies along the IGS; the most homogeneous regions are downstream of the
28S rRNA gene and in the region containing the core promoter. The inadvertent inclusion of interspecific hybrids
in our analysis uncovered evidence of both inter- and intrachromosomal recombination in the nonrepetitive
regions of the IGS.
Conclusions: Our analysis of variation in ribosomal IGS from Daphnia shows that levels of homogeneity within and
between species result from the interaction between rates of recombination and selective constraint.
Consequently, different regions of the IGS are on substantially different evolutionary trajectories.

Background
We expect duplicated gene copies to accumulate mutations independently of one another, which results in
greater sequence diversity among paralogs than among
orthologs. However, in some multigene families (MGF),
including ribosomal DNA (rDNA), tandemly arrayed
paralogs are more similar to each other than they are to
orthologs in closely related species. This pattern is
referred to as concerted evolution [1], and Arnheim [2]
invoked gene conversion and unequal crossing over
between misaligned members of the gene family to
explain it. Thus, the degree of sequence homogeneity

within a MGF will depend on the relative rate of mutation and recombination between misaligned copies on
homologous and nonhomologous chromosomes.
The ubiquity and high degree of interspecific sequence
conservation of the genes encoding ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) makes them a valuable system for studying
MGF evolution. Tandem copies of these coding
sequences alternate with the less-conserved intergenic
spacer (IGS) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) to
form a complete ribosomal DNA (rDNA) unit. In many
species, the IGS is internally repetitive, and contains one
or more arrays of repeats with elements that may be
involved in transcription regulation (Drosophila [3],
Xenopus [4], Arabidopsis [5], rat [6], mouse [7],
Acanthamoeba [8]). Furthermore, these elements are

involved in chromosomal pairing in Drosophila [9]. The
iterative nature of rDNA, the homogeneity of its copies
and the regulatory functions played by the IGS suggest
that recombination in the form of gene conversion and
unequal crossover is frequent, and may be the result of
DNA repair mechanisms influenced by protein/DNA
interactions within it [10,11].
In a study of IGS repeat array variation in three populations of Daphnia pulex, Crease [12] reported greater
similarity between orthologous copies of IGS repeats
than between paralogous copies in the same repeat
array. Hayworth [13] described similar results in a study
of IGS variation in six species of Arabidopsis, although
patterns typical of concerted evolution emerged as
divergence times between species increased. In a previous study, we [14] reported few differences in IGS
array organization and repeat sequences between
the closely related species, Daphnia pulicaria and North
American Daphnia pulex (D. pulexNA), but we
observed clear differences between Daphnia parvula
and Daphnia obtusa, which are in a different species
complex than D. pulex or D. pulicaria and diverged
from them on the order of 50-90 million years ago [15].
However, we also observed differences between an IGS
array in European D. pulex (D. pulexE) and an array
from D. pulicaria and D. pulexNA, all three of which
are members of the D. pulex species complex.
In this study, we focus on evolutionary changes across
the IGS, including the repeat arrays, by analyzing complete IGS sequences from representatives of four species
in the D. pulex complex: D. pulexE, D. pulexNA, D.
pulicaria, and D. tenebrosa (Table 1). Daphnia pulexNA
is the dominant Daphnia species in ephemeral ponds
that lack fish across North America while D. pulicaria

has approximately the same geographic distribution but
has invaded permanent lakes that contain fish. Daphnia
tenebrosa is an Arctic endemic that lives in permanent
ponds and lakes [16], and D. pulexE inhabits ponds in
the temperate regions of Europe [17]. The divergence
time between D. tenebrosa and D. pulexNA or D. pulicaria (~4-5 million years) is about half the divergence
time between D. pulexE and the latter two species
(~8-10 million years, [17]). Our objectives are to 1)
identify patterns of recombination and/or homogenisation within rDNA repeat arrays, 2) estimate the divergence time at which repeats become more similar
within species than between, and 3) identify regions of
the IGS that may be experiencing functional constraint.

Results
IGS sequence variation

We sequenced 13 complete IGS including one from
each of three D. pulexNA (DpxNA1, DpxNA2,
DpxNA3), three D. pulicaria (Dpc1, Dpc2, Dpc3) and
one D. tenebrosa (Dten) individual. We sequenced two
complete IGS from each of three D. pulexE individuals
(DpxE1a, DpxE1b, DpxE2a, DpxE2b, DpxE3a and
DpxE3b). Each individual was sampled from a different
population (Table 1). We partitioned each IGS sequence
into three regions: N1, the nonrepetitive segment
located immediately downstream of the 28S rRNA coding region; R, the repetitive midsection; and N2, the
nonrepetitive segment located downstream of the repeat
arrays and 5’ to the 18S rRNA coding region (Figure 1).
The tandem arrays in the R-region were further dissected into repeat types A, B, and C.
Length variation among the IGS sequences is as high
as 20% and can be attributed to the presence of indels

in the nonrepetitive regions (N1 and N2), and variable
numbers of the three repeat types (A, B, and C) in the
repetitive region, which begins between nt 659
(DpxNA3) and nt 797 (Dpc1), downstream of the 28S
rRNA coding region (Figure 2, Additional file 1: Structure of complete IGS sequences). The three DpxNA IGS
sequences have a 107 nt deletion beginning at nt 493 in
the multiple alignment that is not present in any of the
other species, and is not limited to these three populations (Crease TJ, unpublished data). Region N2 ranges
from 2492 nt (DpxE1b) to 2843 nt (DpxE3a) in length.
Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees based on the complete
condensed (see methods) IGS, and the N1 and N2
regions (Figures 3, 4 and 5 ) show that the sequences
from DpxE3 do form the sister group to the remaining
sequences, as expected from phylogenies of the D. pulex
complex based on mtDNA [17]. However, the DpxE1a/b
and DpxE2a/b sequences do not cluster with them in
any of these trees. In addition, Dten is not the sister
group to a DpxNA+Dpc cluster, as expected based on
the mtDNA phylogeny [17]. Indeed, the only consistent
features of the three trees is the sister group relationship
of the DpxE3a/b sequences to all the others, and the
occurrence of two groups consisting of [Dpc1+DpxE2a/b]
and [Dten+DpxE1a/b].
Mean sequence divergence (p-distance) in the complete condensed IGS and nonrepetitive regions is slightly
higher between species than within them, with the highest values occurring in the N1 region (Table 2). Mean
values of intra- and interspecific sequence divergence in
the N1 and N2 regions are similar to those obtained for
the complete IGS. The AMOVA results show that over
half of the variation in complete IGS and N1 sequences
occurs among species, but all the variation in N2
sequences occurs within species, although this value is
not significant (Table 3). This result is consistent with
the fact that N2 sequences show less clustering by species (Figure 5) than do the full IGS or N1 sequences
(Figure 3, 4). For example, intraspecific sequence divergence is always lowest in DpxNA (Table 2), but all three
sequences from this species do not cluster together in
the NJ tree based on N2 sequences (Figure 5).

In the repetitive region of the IGS, one to five copies
of the A repeat, ranging from 184 to 222 nt in length,
are interleaved with B repeats (Additional file 1, Figure
2). All sequence variation among A repeats is within
individuals (Table 3). With the exception of two A
repeats from DpxE3b and an anomalous Dpc2 A repeat,
there is a tendency for repeats to cluster according to
their position in the array (Figure 6). Mean sequence
divergence between A repeats within clusters based
on the NJ tree is 0.04 while that between sequences
from different clusters is substantially higher at 0.125
(Table 4).
The number of B repeats per IGS ranges from two to
six (Figure 2, Additional file 1). As with A repeats, all of
the sequence variation is found within individuals
(Table 3). Mean sequence divergence between sequences
within the clusters based on the NJ tree (Figure 7) is
0.027 while that between sequences from different clusters is 0.168 (Table 4).
C repeats occur as two tandem copies in all but the
two DpxE3 IGS sequences, which each contain a single
C repeat (Figure 2). All sequence variation among C
repeats is within individuals (Table 3) and repeats cluster by position (Figure 8). The single C repeat in
DpxE3a groups with repeats in the second position,
while the single C repeat in DpxE3b groups with those
in the first position (Figure 8). Mean divergence between
sequences within the clusters based on the NJ tree is
0.013 while that between sequences from different clusters is 0.057 (Table 4).
Recombination

Although analysis of the complete condensed IGS using
GARD partitioned it into five hypothetical nonrecombinant sections, the server’s execution time limit per job
was reached before the analysis was completed. Further
analysis of N1 identified five hypothetical nonrecombinant sections, and although four such sections were
identified in N2 (Table 5), the server once again timed
out before the analysis of the alignment was complete.
In the complete IGS, the first putative recombination
breakpoint falls immediately upstream of the repeat

array and the second is located within the A repeat consensus sequence, just upstream from the spacer promoter [18,19]. The position of the last two breakpoints
coincides with two of the three breakpoints identified in
the separate analysis of the N2 region. The third IGS
breakpoint is about 150 nt downstream of the core promoter, and the fourth IGS breakpoint is located in the
vicinity of a (GT)n microsatellite, a few hundred nt
upstream of the 18S rRNA coding region.
Mean inter- and intraspecific p-distances differ substantially among the regions identified by the GARD
analysis (Table 5). The regions with the least variation
are located just downstream of the 28S rRNA coding
region (N1-1 and N1-2) while the regions with the highest variation are just downstream of that (N1-3) and in
the A repeat consensus (IGS-2) (Table 5, Figure 9).

Analysis of complete IGS sequences using GENECONV identified 12 significant putative gene conversion
tracts between ancestors of two sequences in the alignment. All 12 fragments are located within the N2
region, and range in length between 106 and 1620 nt
(Additional file 2: Gene conversion analysis of complete
IGS sequences). Three of these conversion tracts,
including the longest one, are between IGS sequences
from the same individual (DpxE1a × DpxE1b and
DpxE3a × DpxE3b). Three other tracts are between
sequences from different individuals of the same species
(DpxE1b × DpxE2a; DpxE1b × DpxE2b; DpxE1a ×
DpxE3a). The six remaining exchanges involve interspecific gene conversion events; four tracts involve Dpc2:
two with Dten and one each with DpxE1b and DpxE1a.
Two tracts involve DpxE2b; one with Dten and one
with DpxNA3 (Additional file 2). A separate analysis of
the N1 region identified only two gene conversion
tracts, both of which cover the same region, between
DpxE3a and each of two DpxNA individuals (Additional
file 3: Gene conversion analysis of the IGS N1 region.).
In a similar analysis of N2 (Additional file 4: Gene conversion analysis of the IGS N2 region), four of the seven
gene conversion tracts are interspecific, involving Dten
with Dpc2 (2 tracts), DpxE3a and DpxE2b.
There is little statistical support for putative recombination breakpoints within the aligned consensus repeat
sequences using the GARD algorithm. However, the
GENECONV algorithm identified seven putative gene
conversion tracts in the A repeat alignment and nine in
the B repeat alignment (Additional files 5: Gene conversion analysis of the IGS A repeat region, Additional file
6: Gene conversion analysis of the IGS B repeat region).
All putative gene conversion tracts in the B repeat alignment were between the fourth copy of the B repeat
from DpxE3b and the second or third copies of B
repeats from all other species. Two putative gene

Discussion
Hybridization

We found inconsistencies between the topology of NJ
trees based on IGS sequences and the species phylogenies

based on mtDNA sequences. The most plausible explanation for these differences is the introduction of allospecific
nuclear DNA through hybridization between D. pulexE
and both D. tenebrosa and D. pulicaria. The NJ tree of
complete IGS sequences reveals that only the two DpxE3
sequences form a separate branch as predicted by the
divergent mtDNA sequence of this individual. The
IGS sequences of the other two D. pulexE individuals
cluster with those from D. pulicaria or D. tenebrosa.

While hybridization between D. pulexE and D. pulicaria
or D. tenebrosa has not been documented in the literature,
the divergence among their mitochondrial 12S rDNA
sequences falls well below the 14% threshold for species
which are known to hybridize [[15] and references within].
Colbourne and Hebert [15] note that the lack of evidence
for hybridization between species with low levels of 12S
rDNA sequence divergence involves taxa with allopatric
distributions, which is generally thought to be the case
for D. pulexE relative to the other species. However,
D. pulexNA and D. pulicaria have been found in Europe
[16,20] so opportunities for hybridization do exist.

The phylogenetic relationship among the four Daphnia
species in this study, based on mtDNA sequences, is
most closely reflected in the relationship among N1
sequences. We observed tight clustering of the three N1
sequences from D. pulexNA, while the N1 sequences of
the three D. pulicaria individuals form a looser grouping.
However, evidence for introgression is seen in four of the
six DpxE N1 sequences. N1 sequences from DpxE1 cluster with the Dten N1 sequence, and N1 sequences from
DpxE2 cluster with the Dpc N1 sequences.
The tree topologies of A and B repeats, which are interleaved with one another, are similar. Aside from the
repeat sequences from DpxE3, major clusters are formed
by orthologous rather than paralogous repeats for both A
and B types. The occurrence of this structure in all but
the most divergent species suggests that it has persisted
for several million years, despite the occurrence of
recombination between repeats (discussed below, [12]).
Unfortunately, because all but one of the IGS arrays from
D. pulexE appears to have been impacted by hybridization, it is not entirely clear if this position-specific pattern
also occurs in this species. However, two observations
suggest that it may. First, the only A repeats from different DpxE IGS sequences (DpxE3a-A1 and DpxE3b-A1)
that cluster with one another in the NJ tree (Figure 6) are
both in the same (first) position. Second, branch lengths
between the A repeats in the DpxE3a array are more
similar to branch lengths between array positions than
within them in the other species (Figure 6).
All but the last of the six B repeats in the DpxE3a
array cluster with one another, which is consistent with
the pattern observed for A repeats. However, orthologous clustering of terminal F repeats was observed in
the IGS of Drosophila melanogaster and Dr. orena [14].
Others have also reported the apparent escape from
homogenization experienced by terminal repeats relative
to interior paralogs [21-23].
With the exception of the three D. pulexE individuals,
for which two complete IGS were sequenced, our data
are limited to a single IGS sequence for each individual,
and three IGS sequences per species in D. pulexNA and
D. pulicaria. This, in combination with the introgression
mentioned above, limits the confidence with which we
are able to estimate the divergence time necessary for
IGS sequences to appear more similar within than
between species. However, divergence times between the
species in this study, based on the mitochondrial genes
[17], suggest that the threshold for detecting patterns
consistent with concerted evolution for the complete
IGS must be greater than 4 million years.
Recombination in the IGS

We expect the hierarchically iterative nature of rDNA to
facilitate recombination and homogenization at this

locus. Indeed, our GARD and GENECONV analyses
confirm that recombination occurs at multiple locations
across the Daphnia IGS, including the repeats although
these analyses do not identify recombination hotspots.
The GARD algorithm identifies nonrecombinant segments rather than precise recombination break points
and adopts the convention that breakpoints coincide
with variable sites because breakpoints can only be
resolved to the nearest variable site [24]. In fact, actual
breakpoints may be located at invariant sites [25].
Although it is possible that some of the intraindividual
recombination that we observed is due to template
switching during PCR amplification, we used a long
extension time and a total of 30 cycles. Thus, it seems
unlikely that recombination during the PCR reaction is
a substantial source of the variation we observed.
Indeed, recombination among IGS repeats has been
observed in sequences from D. pulex obtained by cloning directly from genomic DNA [12]. However, the frequency with which such artefacts occur could also be
tested empirically by combining cloned divergent IGS
sequences and amplifying them under our PCR
conditions.
The copy number of A repeats, which contain a putative enhancer motif [18], ranges between one (Dpc1)
and five (DpxNA2). Crease [12] reported that 18 of 21
arrays from seven D. pulexNA individuals contained

four repeats, while the remaining three contained either
five or six. This length variation is strong evidence that
unequal crossing over is occurring between misaligned
IGS repeats. Despite this, A and B repeats cluster by
position in the array rather than species. This pattern
was also observed by Luchetti et al. [26] in the IGS
arrays of Triops cancriformis, which contain three copies
of a ~200 nt repeat. In a previous study, we [14] found
that the homogeneity of tandem and interleaved repeats
increases as their number increases in arthropod IGS
sequences. Thus, the rate of recombination in short
arrays may be too low to fully homogenize the repeats.
We also observed that duplication and deletion events
rarely involve terminal repeats, which is consistent with
the results of earlier work in plants. For example, Markos and Baldwin [27] found that interior repeats evolve
in concert in Lessingia spp. (Compositae, Astereae), and
Baldwin and Markos [28] found that sequence similarity
of flanking repeats is higher between orthologs than
paralogs in Calycadenia (Asteraceae).
Previous studies have suggested that intrachromosomal exchange (between sister chromatids) is more frequent than interchromosomal exchange (between
homologues) in rDNA. For example, Crease [12] showed
that intrachromosomal recombination is most likely
responsible for patterns of sequence diversity within the
IGS repeat arrays of D. pulexNA. Similarly, Schlötterer

and Tautz [29] suggested that intrachromosomal
exchange mechanisms are the most parsimonious explanation for the homogenization process in the ITS of
Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast, our results suggest
that many of the putative gene conversion tracts in the
nonrepetitive regions of the IGS occurred between,
rather than within, species (i.e. between homologous
chromosomes in hybrids). This is consistent with the
results of Polanco et al. [30] who showed that homogenization of the Drosophila IGS is the result of interchromosomal recombination. Our results do not exclude the
possibility that intrachromosomal exchange occurs at an
equal or even higher frequency than interchromosomal
exchange. However, they do suggest that recombination
within the IGS occurs during a phase in the cell cycle
when homologous chromosomes are in close proximity,
either following S phase during meiosis or when actively
transcribed rRNA genes come together to form the
nucleolus. Recombination can also occur between rDNA
arrays on nonhomologous chromosomes, but D. pulex
has only a single rDNA array per haploid genome (D.
Tsuchiya, unpublished data). The number of rDNA
arrays has not been determined for the other species,
but they have similar genome sizes [31] and the same
number of chromosomes (n = 12) as D. pulex [32].
Taken together, the above studies corroborate Polanco
et al.’s [33] assertion that different regions within the
rDNA unit follow different evolutionary trajectories.
Conserved regions within the IGS

The exceptionally low sequence diversity in the first ~350
nt of N1 suggests that it undergoes homogenization along
with the 28S rRNA gene. Liao [34] also reported that the
homogenization of flanking regions in bacterial rRNA
genes was the result of hitchhiking, or co-conversion with
genic sequences. Moreover, the mean sequence divergence
and the topology of NJ trees differs between N1 and N2,
and from the repetitive region that connects them. This
may be due to differences in the strength of natural selection acting on regulatory regions within the IGS, as well as
the frequency with which recombination occurs between
paralogous repeat copies whose sequences predispose
them to frequent breakage and repair.
Because concerted evolution reduces mean intraspecific p-distance among the members of a MGF despite
interspecific divergence, we would expect the ratio of
mean intra- and interspecific p-distance (p-distance
ratio) to be less than one and decrease with divergence
time. On the other hand, if natural selection is constraining sequence divergence, then mean intra- and
interspecific p-distance should be low and similar, especially among closely related taxa such as those included
in this study. In this case, the p-distance ratio would
remain close to one regardless of divergence time.

Page 11 of 14

Although hybridization has blurred the species boundaries between individuals in this study, a comparison of
mean p-distances within and between species does suggest that some of regions of the IGS may be under functional constraint. For example, the most conserved of
the four N2 segments delimited by GARD breakpoints
(N2-3), with a p-distance ratio of 1.0, is located between
the putative core promoter and the breakpoint at nt
3900 in the full IGS, which may be the location of an
rRNA processing site [35-37]. In contrast, the region
that appears to be under the least functional constraint
(N2-4, Table 5) is just downstream of this region and
upstream of the 18S rRNA coding region, which is
highly conserved both within and between species. This
increase in both mean intra- and interspecific p-distance
is also evident when mean p-distance is calculated after
dividing the IGS into sequential 500 nt sections (data
not shown).
As previously noted, the lowest overall sequence diversity occurs at the 3’ end of the 28S rRNA coding region
(N1-1 and N1-2). In contrast, the highest sequence
diversity occurs just downstream of this region, in the
middle section of N1 (N1-3), which includes a GA n
dinucleotide repeat. The p-distance ratio is relatively
low in this region (0.76, Table 5), but the lowest ratio
(0.5) occurs in region N1-5, which is separated from
N1-3 by the only region in the IGS (N1-4) where mean
intraspecific divergence actually exceeds mean interspecific divergence (ratio = 1.27). The explanation for this
pattern is unclear, but it should be noted that all of the
regions in N1 are relatively short (151 - 181 nt). Further
examination of this pattern will require analysis of species that diverged from a common ancestor at least 4
million years ago, and between which hybridization does
not occur.
The region of the IGS with the highest mean intraspecific sequence divergence is the repeat region, although
the p-distance ratio is also high at 0.94 (Table 5). This
high level of diversity is primarily driven by differences
between repeats in different positions in the array
(Figure 3 and Figure 4). As suggested above, one explanation for this is low rates of recombination. However,
it has also been suggested that this pattern may be
maintained by natural selection despite the occurrence
of recombination [12]. Indeed, the A repeats contain an
~27-nt putative TATA motif, which is highly conserved
among all A repeats in this and the previous study [12].
This motif is also be found in the IGS repeats of other
arthropods [14] and those containing the motif were
found to be significantly more homogeneous than those
without it in these taxa. These results suggest that selection is able to maintain homogeneity or diversity among
functionally important repeat types regardless of the
level of recombination among them [12].

Conclusions
The occurrence of length variation in the IGS repeat
array suggests that unequal crossing over occurs in this
region, which is consistent with previous work. However, we also found evidence of interchromosomal gene
conversion in the nonrepetitive regions of the IGS.
Levels of sequence homogeneity vary across the IGS,
due to the interaction between rates of recombination
and selective constraint. The pattern of position-specific
variation in Daphnia IGS repeat arrays likely predates
speciation in the D. pulex species complex, and has persisted for millions of years. Although this pattern may
be a function of low rates of recombination in short
repeat arrays, the occurrence of a highly conserved
TATA motif in the A repeats suggests that natural
selection may also play a role in the maintenance of this
pattern. The unintentional inclusion of hybrids in this
study provided insight into evolutionary patterns within
the IGS, but analysis of D. pulexE individuals that are
not hybrids, as well as other sister species pairs in the
genus Daphnia, is required to more precisely estimate
the divergence time at which paralogous IGS repeats
show evidence of concerted evolution.
Methods
Cloning and sequencing the IGS

Complete copies of the IGS were amplified from genomic
DNA of Daphnia individuals using the Expand Long
Template PCR System (Roche Diagnostics) and primers
complimentary to highly conserved regions at the 3’ end
of the 28S rRNA gene (5’ GTTTAGACCGTCGTGAGACAGGTTAG) and the 5’ end of the 18S rRNA gene (5’
TCAGGCTCCCTCTCCGG). The PCR conditions were
as follows: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 10 cycles of 92°C
for 30s, 60°C for 30s, and 68°C for 8 minutes. The next
20 cycles were 92°C for 30s, 60°C for 30s, and 68°C for 8
min plus 2s/cycle, ending with a final extension at 68°C
for 7 minutes. Depending on the species, the major fragment generated in these amplifications ranged between
~4000 and 5500 nt, in agreement with earlier characterizations of the D. pulex IGS [12].
The PCR fragments were gel purified and cloned using
the TOPO XL PCR cloning Kit (Invitrogen) according
to manufacturer’s recommendations. After screening
plasmid clones for inserts of the expected size using gel
electrophoresis, the presence of the 5’ 18S and 3’ 28S
rRNA gene termini were confirmed by sequencing plasmid DNA with the M13 Forward and Reverse primers
and the ABI Prism TaqFS dye terminator kit (Applied
Biosystems). Sequences were resolved on an ABI 377
automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The Erasea-base system (Promega) was used to generate nested
deletion subclones from a single plasmid clone from

Page 12 of 14

each individual. Overlapping deletion subclones were
sequenced and a contig sequence of each insert from
each individual was created in Sequencher (Gene
Codes). Additional clones from each species, and
regions that were not well covered by deletion subclones
were sequenced by primer-walking.
IGS sequence analysis

We located the 5’ end of the 18S rRNA gene and the
3’ end of the 28S rRNA gene in each IGS sequence by
consensus alignment with the homologous sequence
from D. pulex [GenBank:AF014011] and D. longicephala [GenBank:AF346516] [38]. Repetitive regions in
individual IGS sequences were located visually in Dotmatcher [39] using a window size of 25 and a threshold of 40. We estimated IGS repeat boundaries by
performing 25 local self-alignments using the default
settings in the local similarity program, SIM [40,41].
Finally, we refined putative IGS repeat boundaries by
visual inspection of the aligned IGS repeat sequences
in Multiple Sequence Alignment Program (MAP) [42]
with default settings.
To facilitate alignments between individuals with different numbers and/or organization of A, B and C
repeats, we aligned all copies of each repeat type for
each IGS sequence and created a consensus repeat
sequence. We then condensed the repeat array in each
full IGS sequence by replacing it with one copy of the
consensus for each repeat type and aligned the condensed IGS sequences using ClustalW [43]. The resulting alignment was adjusted by eye.
To incorporate a conservative estimate of the effects
of indels on sequence divergence, we replaced the first
position in each gap with a nucleotide that was unique
to that position. We used the nucleotide p-distance
algorithm in MEGA v3.1 [44] to calculate pairwise
sequence divergence between entire condensed IGS
sequences, the nonrepetitive regions (N1 and N2) and
the repeat sequences. We used pairwise deletion of
indels and assumed homogeneous patterns of nucleotide
substitution among lineages and uniform mutation rates
among sites for these analyses. MEGA was also used to
construct Neighbor-joining dendrograms from the
nucleotide p-distance matrices.
Statistical analyses

We performed an Analysis of Molecular Variance
(AMOVA) using Arlequin 3.0, [45] to partition the
genetic variance in condensed IGS sequences within and
between species. In addition, variation in each repeat
type was partitioned within and between species. Levels
of significance were based on 1023 random permutation
replicates.

Ambrose and Crease BMC Genetics 2011, 12:13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/13

We used the program Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection (GARD) [46] to look for evidence of
recombination within each condensed IGS. In addition,
we analyzed sequence alignments of the nonrepetitive
N1 and N2 regions separately because the entire condensed IGS sequences caused the program to “time out”
before all breakpoints had been identified. Goodness of
fit was assessed by small sample Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) derived from a maximum likelihood
model fit to each segment. Nucleotide substitution bias
models were defined for each alignment using the
model selection tool in GARD (general discrete rate variation with four rate classes, and the GARD detection
method, which looks for multiple rather than a single
breakpoint).
We also used the GENECONV v1.81 computer program [47] to find statistical evidence of putative gene
conversion events between the ancestors of two
sequences in an alignment. GENECONV identifies global inner fragments that contain evidence of a possible
gene conversion event between ancestors of two
sequences in the alignment. It also identifies outer fragments, which contain evidence of putative gene conversion events that may have originated from outside of the
alignment, or from within the alignment, but with evidence of the source destroyed by later mutation or gene
conversion [48].
