Abstract
Background: Insect odorant binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) play an
important role in chemical communication of insects. Gene discovery of these proteins is a timeconsuming task. In recent years, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of many insect species have
accumulated, thus providing a useful resource for gene discovery.
Results: We have developed a computational pipeline to identify OBP and CSP genes from insect
ESTs. In total, 752,841 insect ESTs were examined from 54 species covering eight Orders of
Insecta. From these ESTs, 142 OBPs and 177 CSPs were identified, of which 117 OBPs and 129
CSPs are new. The complete open reading frames (ORFs) of 88 OBPs and 123 CSPs were obtained
by electronic elongation. We randomly chose 26 OBPs from eight species of insects, and 21 CSPs
from four species for RT-PCR validation. Twenty two OBPs and 16 CSPs were confirmed by RTPCR, proving the efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. Together with all family members
obtained from the NCBI (OBPs) or the UniProtKB (CSPs), 850 OBPs and 237 CSPs were analyzed
for their structural characteristics and evolutionary relationship.
Conclusions: A large number of new OBPs and CSPs were found, providing the basis for deeper
understanding of these proteins. In addition, the conserved motif and evolutionary analysis provide
some new insights into the evolution of insect OBPs and CSPs. Motif pattern fine-tune the functions
of OBPs and CSPs, leading to the minor difference in binding sex pheromone or plant volatiles in
different insect Orders.

Background
Insects are highly successful terrestrial animals that have
complicated communication systems. Insect odorant
binding proteins (OBPs) play an important role in insect

chemical communication. Until recently, it was believed
that pheromones and other odors entering the aqueous
lumen of chemosensilla, were transported by OBPs to
transmembrane odorant receptors (ORs) [1,2] and finally

degraded by odorant degradation enzymes (ODEs) [3-7].
Recently, however, an active role of OBPs has been
reported, where a conformational change of the OBP triggered by the presence of the ligand in its binding pocket
that activated the membrane-bound receptor [8]. Insect
OBPs, particularly in Lepidoptera, can be classified into
two subfamilies, pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs)
and general odorant binding proteins (GOBPs)[9]. OBPs
are small and water soluble proteins 120 to 150 amino
acids long. A typical feature of OBPs is the presence of six
positional conserved cysteines. These six cysteines form
three disulfide bridges, which play important roles in
maintaining the protein tertiary structure. Another essential criterion is an acceptable similarity in protein
sequence (e-value of BLAST analysis) with other family
members. Insect chemosensory proteins (CSPs) represent
another gene family suggested to have similar properties
in binding and transporting pheromones and other ligands. Insect CSPs are smaller than OBPs with about 100120 amino acids, and bear no sequence similarity with
OBPs. CSPs have only four conserved cysteines linked by
disulfide bridges between neighboring residues [10] and
are better conserved than OBPs across species [11].
Numerous efforts have been made to obtain the
sequences of insect OBPs [9,12-20] and CSPs [14,21-28]
by direct cloning, which normally involves designing
degenerate primers based on conserved protein
sequences, amplifying the fragment and obtaining the full
length sequences by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends
(RACE). Thanks to the accomplishments of genome
sequencing projects of several insect species, large scale
new gene discovery is possible using bioinformatics. By
searching available genome sequences, Hekmat-Scafe et
al. found 51 OBP genes in Drosophila melanogaster and a
new subfamily of OBPs [29]; Maleszka et al. showed that
Apis mellifera has only 21 OBP genes[14]; Zhou et al. identified 66 putative OBPs in Aedes aegypti and 11 additional
sequences in Anopheles gambiae by developing a specific
algorithm [30]. By comparative genomic analysis of the
OBP families in 12 Drosophila genomes, Vieira et al. identified 595 OBP genes and found that purifying selection
governs the evolution of the OBP family [31]. In 2006,
Zhou et al. did a comprehensive searching for CSP genes
from insect genomes and ESTs and identified 74 putative
CSP genes from 22 insect species[32]. Gong et al. performed a genome-wide analysis based on the conserved
cysteine residues and similarity to CSPs in other insects,
finding 20 candidate CSPs in the silkworm [33]. However,
genome searching for new genes is limited to a few insect
species, as genome sequences are not available for most
insects. Fortunately, an increasing number of insect
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are deposited in the dbEST
database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Insect ESTs are a valuable resource that
has not been fully exploited for mining new OBP or CSP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/632

genes. Pugalenthi et al. developed a new algorithm using
Regularized Least Squares Classifier (RLSC) to predict
OBPs with a high accuracy of 97.7%. This approach could
be used to identify novel OBPs that have low similarities
with known ones [34]. Recently, Zhou et al. used MotifSearch algorithm to screen putative OBPs in the silkworm
and found 13 OBP-like genes, which is much fewer than
that in fruit flies and mosquitoes[35].
Here, we develop a computational pipeline to identify
OBP and CSP genes from insect ESTs of 54 species across
eight Orders including Blattaria, Coleoptera, Diptera,
Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera and
Phthiraptera. In total, 117 new OBPs and 129 new CSPs
were found, of which 38 genes from eight species were
experimentally validated by RT-PCR. In addition, the conserved cysteines patterns, motif patterns and phylogenetic
relationship of known OBPs and CSPs were analyzed.

Results
Identification of new OBPs and CSPs genes from insect
ESTs
We collected 752,841 insect ESTs from the dbEST [36] and
constructed a local database for further analysis. The ESTs
are from 54 insect species that cover eight Orders of
Insecta. We searched for OBPs and CSPs with a computational pipeline as detailed in Figure 1. In total, 2,380 ESTs
were found to satisfy the strict criteria, and produce 142
OBPs from 38 species and 177 CSPs from 37 species. Of
these genes, more than 80% OBPs (117) and 70% CSPs
(129) have not been reported before (Table 1, Additional

File 1). We performed electronic elongation to get the
sequences as long as possible and obtained the intact
ORFs of 88 OBPs and 123 CSPs. The nucleotide and protein sequences of predicted OBPs are listed in Additional
File 2 and 3, and those of predicted CSPs in Additional
File 4 and 5.
In some insects, more than 10 OBPs or CSPs were identified. For example, 29 new OBPs were predicted in Diabrotica virgifera and 10 in Nasonia giraulti. Fifteen CSPs
were predicted in Solenopsis invicta, of which 14 are not
reported before, and 10 new CSPs genes were found in
Gryllus bimaculatus. However, fewer than five OBPs or
CSPs were identified in most species. We plotted the
number of identified OBPs or CSPs against the total
number of ESTs in each species and could not find any
clear relationship (data not shown).
Conserved cysteines pattern
The presence of conserved cysteines is a typical feature of
OBPs and CSPs. We therefore analyzed the cysteines patterns (C-patterns) of OBPs and CSPs in different Orders
(Table 2). Generally, there were no major differences
between different Orders, except for the presence of a subclass of OBPs, C-plus OBPs, in Diptera containing eight
conserved cysteines. In the typical C-pattern, there were
three amino acids between the second and third cysteines
in all OBPs, while eight residues were present between the
fifth and sixth cysteines in most insect OBPs. The numbers
of amino acids between the other three neighboring
cysteines were rather variable. In order to evaluate the variability in the distances between each pair of neighboring
cysteines, we calculated the coefficients of variation (Table
3). In most insects, the distance between the fourth and
the fifth cysteines was the most variable. However, in
Hymenoptera, the distance between the first and the sec-

ond cysteines was the most variable with a coefficient of
variation of 11.66. The highest variations were found in
the OBPs of Diptera. By contrast, C-patterns of CSPs were
much more conserved.
Motif-pattern analysis
The conserved motifs are important elements of functional domains. We used the MEME server to discover
conserved motifs in OBPs and CSPs[37]. The full-length
sequences of OBP and CSPs either collected from the database or newly predicted in this work were used for motif
analysis. Parameters used in this and all other motif predictions of this study were: minimum width = 6, maximum = 10, maximum number of motif to find = 8. As a
result, eight motifs were found for both CSPs and OBPs.
Only five motifs were present in more than 50% of OBPs,
while all eight motifs were present in more than 50% of
CSPs (Figure 2).

Since a high number of OBP genes have been reported in
species of Lepidoptera, we carried out a motif-pattern
analysis of GOBPs and PBPs to compare the differences
between these two subfamilies. The GOBPs and PBPs were
combined into one set of sequences and then submitted
to MEME server. Although both GOBPs and PBPs have the
same eight motifs, the motif-patterns were quite different
(Figure 3). The seventh motif was located at the C-terminus of all 41 tested PBPs, but appeared at the N-terminus
of 12 out of 20 GOBPs. Only six GOBPs shared the same
motif-pattern with PBPs. Interestingly, one GOBP lacked
the fifth motif and one had two copies of the seventh
motif.
When the GOBP sequences of both lepidopteran and dipteran were combined into a set of sequences for motif
analysis, we also found that the motif patterns were differ-

The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated as Standard deviation divided by Means. In Diptera, the data for OBPs were calculated from OBPs
of only 6-C pattern. The accession numbers of OBPs and CSPs used in this analysis were listed in Additional File 6.

ent between lepidopteran and dipteran GOBPs (Figure 4).
Of the eight motifs in the Lepidoptera, only the second
and seventh were found in most dipteran GOBPs. The
first, third and eighth motifs appeared in only one dipteran GOBP. Interestingly, the motif patterns of PBPs were
also different between the Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera.
Similarly, motif patterns of lepidopteran and dipteran
PBPs were analyzed by combining the PBP sequences of
both lepidopteran and dipteran into a set of sequences.
The order of the eight motifs in the Lepidoptera was 7-32-4-5-8-6-1 whereas it was 3-7-4-2-5-1-8-6 in the
Hymenoptera (Figure 5). Furthermore, one PBP lacked
one motif and two PBPs lacked five motifs in the
Hymenoptera. These differences may imply functional
differences of OBPs in different Orders. It should be
noticed that the motifs found by MEME server are not
comparable when different sets of sequences were used
for analysis. Thus, it is not suitable to compare the motifs
in different figures (figure 2, 3, 4, 5) since we used different input sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis of OBPs and CSPs
The neighbor-joining trees were inferred by MEGA4.0
using the p-distance amino acid model after 1000 bootstrap replicates [38]. In the evolutionary tree for GOBPs
and PBPs, these two subfamilies were mainly clustered by
Orders, indicating that most genes appeared after diversification of different Orders (Figure 6). This is consistent
with the existence of an Order-specific motif-pattern as
described above, suggesting that most GOBP and PBP
genes have evolved recently. However, the situation is different for CSPs. Although lepidopteran CSPs were mainly
clustered as an independent group, some of their CSPs are
in the same clade with other Orders, suggesting that some

CSPs are ancient, whereas others appeared after the diversification of Orders (Figure 7).
Experimental validation of identified OBPs and CSPs
Most predicted OBPs or CSPs of full length were assembled from several ESTs. To validate the reliability of the
computational pipeline, we randomly chose 26 OBPs
from eight species and 22 CSPs from four species for RTPCR validation. To cover a sequence that was as long as
possible, the primers were designed at both ends of the
transcripts assembled by the CAP3 software. As a result,
22 OBPs and 16 CSPs were successfully amplified by RTPCR. The PCR results were confirmed by sequencing (Figure 8). Most validated OBPs and CSPs contains intact
ORFs.

Discussion
With only a few insect genomes sequenced, expressed
sequence tags (EST) are a good resource for new gene discovery and expression profile analysis. As the cost of
sequencing rapidly deceases, an abundance of insect ESTs
has become available particularly in recent years, providing an opportunity to discover new OBPs and related
genes at large-scale level. In this study, more than 100 new
OBPs and CSPs were found from insect ESTs, suggesting
that this approach is effective.
Although more than 10 OBP or CSP genes were found in
some insects, less than five OBPs were identified in most
species. Generally, there is no correlation between the
number of identified genes and that of ESTs. Though
some OBPs and CSPs are ubiquitous or expressed in nonsensory organs, both these two classes of proteins are
believed to be abundant in the antennae and other chem-

osensory organs. Therefore, a high number of ESTs are not
enough for finding many OBPs or CSPs if the ESTs were
not from the chemosensory organs.
In agreement with previous reports[11], C-pattern and
motif pattern analysis indicate that OBPs are more divergent than CSPs and suggests that OBP genes are still evolving. Zhou et al. used motif "C1 X6-8 C2 X16-21 C3 X2 C4
X3" to search CSP genes and successfully found 74 new
genes[32]. In our work, the CSP motifs analyzed by Order
are consistent with Zhou's results. Zhou et al. also ana-

lyzed the insect OBPs and obtained two motifs, "C1 X1539 C2 X3 C3 X21-38 C4 X7-15 C5 X8 C6"for general OBP
and "C1 X8-41 C2 X3 C3 X39-47 C4 X17-29 C4a X9 C5
X8 C6 X9-11 C6a" for Plus-C OBP[35]. Generally, the
motifs analyzed by Order including new OBP genes found
in our work are similar with Zhou's report. This proves the
C-patterns of both OBP and CSP genes are highly conserved.
As most known PBP and GOBP genes have been identified in the Lepidoptera, we conducted a MEME motif anal-

Motif analysis of Lepidoptera PBPs and GOBPs
Motif analysis of Lepidoptera PBPs and GOBPs. The GOBPs and PBPs were combined into one set of sequences and
then submitted to MEME server. Parameters used for motif discovery were: minimum width = 6, maximum = 10, maximum
number of motif to find = 8. In the lower part of the figure, the numbers in the two columns on the left of the figure are the
numbers of PBPs corresponding to the MEME motif patterns on the right. The numbers in the boxes correspond to the numbered motifs in the upper part of the figure. The small number means high conservation. The numbers on the bottom indicate
approximate locations of each motif on the protein sequence, starting from the N terminal. The accession numbers of PBPs
and GOBPs used in this analysis were listed in Additional File 6.

ysis to compare the difference between these two
subfamilies of OBP genes. Interestingly, all PBPs have an
identical MEME motif pattern as 6-1-2-8-3-4-5-7, though
they are more divergent than GOBPs at the proteinsequence level. GOBPs show four different motif patterns,
with the most common one being 7-6-1-2-8-3-4-5. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first report of motif difference between GOBP and PBP subfamilies. This difference in the motif pattern might imply a functional
difference between PBPs and GOBPs. Meanwhile, it also
provides a hint that GOBP genes might have broad func-

tions. Generally, PBPs bind and transport sex pheromones, while GOBPs are involved in sensing plant volatiles.
Recent report by Zhou et al. proves that BmorGOBP2 in B.
mori can also bind sex pheromone component (bombykol) [35]. Although sex pheromones in moths are species-specific, their chemical structures are similar,
consisting of a hydrocarbon chain that contains an oxygenated functional group (ester, alcohol, aldehyde or
epoxides) [39]. Thus, it is reasonable that PBPs from different insects have an identical motif. By contrast, GOBPs
can bind both plant volatiles and sex pheromone, which

Motifs analysis of Lepidoptera and Diptera GOBPs
Motifs analysis of Lepidoptera and Diptera GOBPs. The GOBP sequences of both lepidopteran and dipteran were combined into a set of sequences for motif analysis. Parameters used for motif discovery were: minimum width = 6, maximum = 10,
maximum number of motif to find = 8. In the lower part of the figure, the numbers in parenthesis indicate the total number of
GOBPs investigated, of which the number of proteins possessing the motif is listed on the top of each motif with boxed
number. The numbers in the boxes correspond to the numbered motifs in the upper part of the figure, where the smallest

display a broad diversity in chemical structures. We
argued that this is the reason why GOBPs have divergent
motif patterns.
In addition, we found that the C-patterns are similar,
whereas the motif patterns are different among diverse
Orders. We reasoned that C-pattern is the key structure
of OBPs and CSPs, which should be highly conserved.
But motif pattern fine-tune the functions of OBPs and
CSPs, leading to the minor difference in binding sex
pheromone or plant volatiles in different insect
Orders.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our results indicate that the computational
pipeline we used in this study is efficient and reliable in
identifying new OBP and CSP genes with insect EST
resources. The large number of the newly found OBPs and

CSPs in our study provides the basis for functional studies
of these proteins. In addition, analysis of protein
sequences showed that there is generally no major difference in C-patterns of OBPs or CSPs between different
insect Orders, whereas conserved motif patterns are quite
different between insect Orders and between the GOBPs
and PBPs in Lepidoptera. Together with the evolutionary
analysis, the results provide some new insights into the
differentiation and evolution of insect OBPs and CSPs.

Professor Zhi-Kuan Jiang (Nanjing Institute of Military
Medical Sciences). The red fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) was
collected in Guangdong province with assistance of Professor Wen-Qing Zhang (Sun Yat-Sen University). The
two-spotted cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) was collected in
Tianjin City, China.
Data collection
Insect ESTs were downloaded from the dbEST [36] of
NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/ in March
2008. Sequences of known insect OBPs were obtained by

searching the GenBank with the keywords "odorant-binding protein AND insecta NOT chemosensory protein NOT
(Haemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein OR
JHBP)". In total, 837 OBP sequences were downloaded,
which covered all reported insect OBPs except for those
from Drosophila species. At present, the genome sequences
of 12 Drosophila species are available, of which hundreds
of OBPs were identified. Because OBP genes share high
similarities between different Drosophila species, only
OBPs from Drosophila melanogaster were considered for
analysis. Finally, 795 OBP sequences remained for further
analysis after removing identical sequences. The non-

named as PBP or GOBP were used in this analysis. The
accession numbers of GOBPs and PBPs used in this analysis
were listed in Additional File 6. The bootstrap values were
given in Additional File 8-A.

redundant protein sequences (nr) were downloaded from
the FTP server of NCBI. In total, 290 CSP sequences were
retrieved from the UniProtKB [40,41].
Computational pipeline for gene discovery
The computational pipeline is shown in Figure 1. The
sequences of known OBPs and CSPs were used to search a
local database of insect ESTs using the program TBLASTN
[42] (version 2.2.17) by an e-value of 10.0. To get more
information, the Blast hits were used as the queries to
search the local EST database using the BLASTN [42] program (e-value = 1.0e-20). The ESTs meeting the criteria
were collected. After removal of the identical sequences by
perl scripts, the remaining sequences were assembled with
CAP3 software (version date: 08/29/02) [43]. Then, the
assembled sequences were used as queries to search
against non-redundant protein sequences (nr) with the
BLASTX program (default parameter) [42]. We kept those
sequences whose blast hits of BLASTX are PBP_GOBP [44]
or OS-D [10,12,45] family as putative OBP or CSP genes.

analysis were listed in Additional File 6. The bootstrap values
were given in Additional File 8-B.

The deduced protein sequences were further confirmed by
searching the Pfam database with the default parameter
(e-value = 1.0) [46].
Accession numbers of all OBP or CSP sequences used for
C-Patten analysis, motif analysis and phylogenetic analysis are listed in the Additional File 6.
C-Patten analysis
The protein sequences of OBPs and CSPs were aligned
using ClustalX [47] (version 1.83) with default gap-penalty parameters to locate six or four conserved cysteines,
and only those sequences with six (for OBP) or four (for
CSP) conserved cysteines were used for C-pattern analysis.
The number of amino acids between cysteines was
counted separately.
Motif analysis
According to the average length of known genes, the predicted ORFs with more than 120 amino acids (aa) for
OBPs and 100 aa for CSPs were regarded as intact ORFs.
All OBP and CSP sequences with intact ORF were used for

motif discovery and pattern analysis. Parameters used for
motif discovery were: minimum width = 6, maximum =
10, maximum number of motif to find = 8. Motif analysis
was conducted by using MEME [48] (version 3.5.7) online
server http://meme.sdsc.edu. The motifs identified in
more than half of the input sequences with a p-value <
0.0001 were counted and viewed by WebLogo [49].
Phylogenetic analysis
To improve the reliability, only those sequences covered
the region of six cysteines (for OBP) or four cysteines (for
CSP) were used in phylogenetic analysis. In total, 114
OBP and 224 CSP sequences were used. The protein
sequences were aligned by ClustalX (version 1.83) with
default gap-penalty parameters. The evolutionary trees
were constructed based on consensus sequence by the
MEGA4.0 [38] program with neighbor-joining [50] phylogeny using the p-distances model. An un-rooted tree was
generated with 1000 bootstrap replications.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
The whole bodies of cotton aphids, peach aphids and pea
aphids were used for RNA extraction, whereas only the
heads with antennae of brown plant hoppers and red fire
ants were collected. For the American cockroach, Asiatic
migratory locust and two-spotted cricket, the antennae

were dissected and used for RNA extraction. The collected
tissues were fast-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 70°C until further use. Total RNA was extracted by
homogenizing antennae or other tissues in Trizol™ reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or E.Z.N.A.® Total
RNA Kit II (Omega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA template was synthesized with
Oligo(dT)18 primer as anchor primers, using M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at
37°C for 50 min. The reactions were stopped by heating
at 70°C for 15 min. Alternatively, we used AMV reverse
transcriptase (Takara) at 42°C for 60 min, and stopped
the reactions by cooling on ice for 5 min.
RT-PCR
Gene specific primers across ORF of predicted OBP and
CSP genes were designed using "Primer Premier 5.0" for
RT-PCR validation. The sequences of these primers are
listed in Additional File 7. PCR experiments were carried
out in a PTC-200 (Bio-Rad, Waltham, MA, USA), and
Touchdown PCR reactions were performed under the following conditions: 94°C for 3 min; 20 cycles at 94°C for
50 sec, 65°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 50 sec, with a
decrease of the annealing temperature of 0.5°C per cycle.
This was followed by 15 cycles at 94°C for 50 sec, 55°C
for 1 min, and 72°C for 50 sec, and final incubation for

10 min at 72°C. The reactions were performed in 25 μl
with 200-600 ng of single-stranded cDNA, 2.0 mM MgCl2,
0.5 mM dNTP, 0.4 μM for each primer and 1.25 U Taq
polymerase or EX-Taq polymerase (Takara). PCR products
were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% w/v agarose gel
in TAE buffer (40 mmol/L Tris-acetate, 2 mmol/L
Na2EDTA·H2O) and the resulting bands were visualized
with ethidium bromide. DNA purification was performed
using the AxyPrep™ PCR Cleanup Kit (Axygen). Purified
products were sub-cloned into a T/A plasmid using the
pGEM-T easy vector system (Promega) following manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid DNA was used to
transform into competent DH5a or Top10 cells. Positive
clones were checked by restriction enzyme cleavage sites
and PCR. Plasmid extraction was performed by E.Z.N.A.™
Plasmid Mini kit (Omega). The PCR products were
sequenced by Bioasia (Shanghai, China).
