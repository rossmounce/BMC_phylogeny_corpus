Abstract
Background: Although the overlap of transcriptional units occurs frequently in eukaryotic
genomes, its evolutionary and biological significance remains largely unclear. Here we report a
comparative analysis of overlaps between genes coding for well-annotated proteins in five
metazoan genomes (human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly and worm).
Results: For all analyzed species the observed number of overlapping genes is always lower than
expected assuming functional neutrality, suggesting that gene overlap is negatively selected. The
comparison to the random distribution also shows that retained overlaps do not exhibit random
features: antiparallel overlaps are significantly enriched, while overlaps lying on the same strand and
those involving coding sequences are highly underrepresented. We confirm that overlap is mostly
species-specific and provide evidence that it frequently originates through the acquisition of
terminal, non-coding exons. Finally, we show that overlapping genes tend to be significantly coexpressed in a breast cancer cDNA library obtained by 454 deep sequencing, and that different
overlap types display different patterns of reciprocal expression.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that overlap between protein-coding genes is selected against in
Metazoa. However, when retained it may be used as a species-specific mechanism for the reciprocal
regulation of neighboring genes. The tendency of overlaps to involve non-coding regions of the
genes leads to the speculation that the advantages achieved by an overlapping arrangement may be
optimized by evolving regulatory non-coding transcripts.

Background
The occurrence of overlapping genes in higher eukaryotes
has long been considered a rare event [1,2], but the completion of genome sequencing efforts and whole-transcriptome analyses have instead revealed that mammalian
genomes harbor a high number of overlapping transcriptional units [3-8]. The majority of detected overlaps
occurs between genes transcribed from opposite strands
of the same genomic locus and often involves non-coding
RNAs [6,9-14]. These antisense transcripts participate in a
number of cellular processes, such as genomic imprinting,
X chromosome inactivation, alternative splicing, gene
silencing and methylation, RNA editing and translation
[15-20]. Comparatively, very little is known about overlapping genes lying on the same DNA strand, apart from
a few cases reported in the literature [21-24]. Overlap is
estimated to involve around 10% of protein-coding genes
[13,25], raising to 20%–60% when non-coding RNAs are
included [6,8-10,12,14,26,27]. Despite their abundance,
the origin and evolution of overlapping genes in eukaryotes remain unclear, and different comparative studies have
often led to discordant results [6,12-14,25]. The inclusion
of non-coding RNAs and poorly annotated transcripts in
these analyses, together with protein-coding genes, may
have contributed to the conflicting results, as protein-coding genes and functional non-coding RNAs evolve differently [28]. In order to investigate the evolution of gene
overlap in Metazoa we decided to use a dataset restricted
to well-annotated protein-coding genes. We retrieved
overlapping protein-coding genes in 5 representative species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio, Drosophila
melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans), and compared
the observed cases with a random distribution expected in
case of functional neutrality. We identified features and
conservation of protein-coding overlapping genes, and
inferred possible mechanisms responsible for overlap formation. Finally, to evaluate the possible relationship
between overlap and gene expression, we analyzed the
expression of our set of overlapping genes in a human

breast cancer cDNA library derived by 454 deep sequencing.

Results and Discussion
Non-random retention of protein-coding overlapping
genes in Metazoa
The sequences of known protein-coding genes for five
fully sequenced metazoan genomes (H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. rerio, D. melanogaster, C. elegans) were retrieved
from several sources (RefSeq v.10, UCSC mm7 assembly,
WormBase WS140, Flybase r4.2, Riken Fantom 3.0). From
each dataset, we filtered splice variants and removed noncoding transcripts, pseudogenes and purely computational gene predictions, and mapped each cDNA on the
corresponding genome to extract the Overlapping Gene
Clusters (OGCs). OGCs were detected when there was
partial or total overlap between the genomic coordinates
of two or more genes. Gene boundaries were defined as
the start and the end of the longest transcript (the complete list and features of OGCs are provided in Additional
files 1 and 2). Our selection criteria allowed the detection
of OGCs laying both on the same (parallel) and on opposite (antiparallel) DNA strand (Figure 1). Although we
started from restrictive datasets, our estimates of overlapping protein-coding genes (Table 1) were consistent with
previous analyses in human, mouse and Drosophila
[13,27,29-31]. According to our results, overlap involves
4–8% of protein-coding genes, with the exception of Drosophila, where the percentage of OGCs is higher (26.2%,
Table 1).

We compared the observed data on overlapping genes to
a null model that simulates the distribution of expected
events in case of neutrality. For each species, we reassigned random positions to the individual genes within
each chromosome and counted the resulting number of
overlaps.

Unique Genes refer to the actual number of sequences used in the analysis, after filtering for splice variants. For each species, the counts of
overlapping genes (OGs), overlapping gene pairs (OG pairs), and overlapping gene clusters (OGCs) coming from both real data and random
simulations are shown. In the latter case the average number over ten simulations is reported together with the standard deviation (SD).

Figure 1
Classes of overlapping genes
Classes of overlapping genes. OGC classification was
based on the overlap extent (complete or partial) and on the
reciprocal direction of transcription of the involved genes
(same or opposite strand). Convergent overlaps involve the
3' termini of both genes, while divergent overlaps involve the
5' ends (UTR and/or CDS). Complete overlap occurs when
the entire sequence of one gene is contained within another
gene. In nested OGCs one gene lies completely within an
intron of the other, while embedded genes can share more
than one intron or exon.

In all species the overall number of observed OGCs was
significantly lower than randomly expected (Table 1), suggesting selection against the retention of overlap as a general mechanism of gene arrangement. There are at least
two reasons possibly explaining the counter selection of
gene overlap in Metazoa. First, each mutation occurring
within the overlapping regions would affect two or more
sequences at the same time, and would likely reduce the
ability of the involved genes to become optimally adapted
[32]. Second, overlap can result in transcriptional [33,34]
or translational [35] interference between overlapping
reading frames. Both these reasons help to explain why
OGCs formed by several genes, as well as those involving
coding sequences, are particularly selected against (see
below).
Although overlap of protein-coding genes is generally
counterselected, some classes of overlap are preferentially
retained. Comparison to random expectation showed that
observed OGCs display a non-random distribution in
terms of their abundance, reciprocal orientation, and
overlap pattern (Table 1 and Figure 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/174

While the number of random OGCs varied according to
the different gene density of the analyzed species (Table 1
and Additional file 2), this tendency was not maintained
in the observed data. Observed OGCs in human and
mouse were around 4–5 times less than expected, while
they were ~2 times less in fly and ~12 times less in worm.
In agreement with our observation, a remarkable abundance of antisense transcripts in fly and a paucity in worm
have been recently reported [12,14]. The different rates of
overlapping genes in fly and worm could be due to species-specific features. The higher proportion of overlapping genes in fly might be partly explained by the high
gene density and the extended UTR length (Additional
File 1). The low number of OGCs in worm may be instead
a consequence of the presence of operons, which involve
at least 15% of C. elegans genes [36]. Each operon contains
from two to eight genes which are cotranscribed from the
same strand as a polycistronic RNA and trans-spliced [36].
It is conceivable that such feature might place a constraint
on the plasticity of the worm genome, disfavoring the
retention of specific overlap types, such as antiparallel and
partial arrangements. Similar genomic constraint has
been recently proposed to explain the paucity of duplicated genes in operons [37].
In all genomes except zebrafish, OGCs formed by two
genes occurred at a frequency significantly higher than
expected (Figure 2A). In addition, OGCs in human,
mouse, and fly were mostly formed by antiparallel convergent pairs which overlapped only partially, while in
zebrafish and more markedly in worm nested overlaps
were preferred (Figures 2B and 2C). However, the results
in zebrafish should be taken carefully, since they are probably affected by the poor coverage of the corresponding
gene set. Likewise, the annotation of 5' and 3' untranslated regions appears particularly incomplete in worm
(Additional file 1), which may contribute to an underestimation of some overlap classes (i. e. partial overlap, CDS/
UTR and UTR/UTR overlaps, Figure 2). In all species overlaps between genes lying on the same strand and those
sharing coding regions are strongly selected against (Figures 2C and 2D). Overlap between UTRs is preferentially
retained in all organisms, while the overlap between coding regions and introns is common in zebrafish, drosophila and worm (Figure 2D). The non-random features
of observed OGCs suggest that different overlap types are
under different selective pressures. The retention of specific overlapping classes might be allowed when it provides selective advantages: in the case of genes on
opposite strands the advantage could be represented by
antisense regulation. Human, mouse and fly are significantly enriched in overlapping pairs potentially able to
form antisense, which include all antiparallel overlaps
sharing exons (H. sapiens 55%, p < 0.001; M. musculus
58%, p < 0.001; D. melanogaster 53%, p < 0.001, chi-

Comparative analysis of OGCs in Metazoa
Comparative analysis of OGCs in Metazoa. For all species, the bar corresponding to each analyzed feature of the
observed overlapping gene sets is followed by the bar corresponding to the random expectation. Since the simulations were
repeated ten times, the corresponding standard deviation is associated to the random bars. A. OGC composition. OGCs were
analyzed on the basis of the number of genes composing each cluster. The OGCs with more than 4 components are 5 in
human, 11 in mouse, 5 in zebra fish, 48 in fly and 7 in worm. B. Type of overlap. Occurrence of partial and complete overlaps
in both 2-component and multicomponent OGCs. C. Gene reciprocal arrangement. Distribution of OGCs according to the
overlap type (refer to Figure 1). D. Features of the overlapping regions. The plot reports the number of overlaps involving coding sequence for one (CDS/UTR or CDS/intron overlaps) or both genes and the number of overlap involving only noncoding
sequence (UTR/UTR and UTR/intron).

squared test). This result suggests that, at least in these species, positive selection might act to preserve antisense regulation. It cannot be excluded, however, that part of the
positive effect could be a consequence of the negative
selection towards parallel and CDS/CDS overlaps.
Poor evolutionary conservation of OGCs in Metazoa
We next evaluated the conservation of OGCs across metazoan evolution by verifying both the presence of orthologous genes and the overlap conservation. For each pair of
analyzed species, we assigned pairwise orthology for all
sequence entries, extracted the orthologs involved in
OGCs, and verified whether the overlapping arrangement
was conserved (Figure 3A). Most overlapping genes in one
species had their corresponding orthologs in the others
(Figure 3B), but very few overlaps were maintained (Figure 3C). In total, ~40% of human OGCs were also present
in mouse -a higher percentage than previous estimates
(6.6–17%) [6,13,33,38], but lower than the rate of orthologous genes between the two species (75.6%).

Among OGCs conserved between human and mouse, the
antiparallel arrangement was represented the most
(~88%), highlighting again the tendency to maintain possible sense-antisense regulation. Interestingly, convergent
and nested antiparallel arrangements were significantly
enriched in the conserved set (chi-square = 22.47, p =
2.14e-6 and chi-square = 23.55, p = 1.2e-6, respectively),
when compared to divergent overlaps (Table 2). This
result supports previous observations that 3'-3' (convergent) overlapping pairs are significantly more conserved
than 5'5' (divergent) ones, and indicates a prevalent role
for 3'UTRs in antisense regulation [14,39].
Parallel OGCs did not show any significant enrichment in
the conserved set (Table 2). Since same-strand overlaps
are strongly selected against (Table 1), we investigated
whether the ones that are conserved are more likely to be
functional. Indeed, we found that several parallel OGCs
conserved between human and mouse might be functionally related on the basis of the available literature data
(Additional data file 3).
Although the vast majority of overlap is not conserved
over long evolutionary distances, we found evidence of
few ancient overlaps. Overall, three OGCs were conserved
between Ecdysozoa (nematodes and arthropods) and
Deuterostomia (vertebrates). Interestingly, the only OGC
that is conserved from C. elegans to human was lost in
arthropods, while two different OGCs are conserved from
D. melanogaster to human. All of these OGCs are formed
of two genes with a nested antiparallel arrangement. One
of the two clusters conserved in D. melanogaster (Cluster
77, Additional File 2) involves the synapsin (Syn) and an
inhibitor of metalloproteinase (Timp) genes. According to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/174

the model proposed for the evolution of the Syn-Timp
cluster [40], the locus containing the ancestral nested
genes has undergone gene duplications and losses in vertebrates, followed by function partitioning among the
resulting paralogs. A comparable succession of events is
compatible also with the evolution of the only OGC conserved between vertebrates and worm (Cluster 371, Additional File 2). In this case, the ancestral OGC locus seems
to have undergone duplication after the split between Protostomia and Deuterostomia, followed by function partitioning among the resulting paralogs (Additional file 4).
The poor evolutionary conservation of gene overlap in
Metazoa suggests that its occurrence is species-specific.
Such species-specificity was not due to a recent origin of
the overlapping genes, as previously suggested [2,13,32].
We found that most overlapping genes in one species had
orthologs in the other species, although they did not overlap (Figures 3B and 3C). In addition, 30.2% of human
overlapping genes and 25.8% of mouse overlapping genes
remained physically adjacent in the compared genome,
although the superimposition was lost (see below).
There are examples of functional processes whose poor
conservation during evolution is part of their functional
role, alternative splicing being the most striking one [41].
Although approximately two-thirds of human genes are
alternatively spliced [42], only 10–20% of them conserve
the spliced exons in the orthologous genes in mouse [43].
Hence we can propose a species-specific usage of gene
overlap similarly to what seems to happen for alternative
splicing [41].
Gene structure modifications associated with overlap
formation
In order to infer possible mechanisms for overlap formation, we compared the gene structure (gene length and
exon number) of conserved and non-conserved overlapping genes in human and mouse. In particular, we analyzed the gene structure of human and mouse overlapping
genes whose orthologs lie adjacent (i. e. without any gene
between them) but do not overlap in the other genome.
We found that 226 human overlapping gene pairs (corresponding to 30.2% of the total) and 171 mouse overlapping gene pairs (25.8% of the total) had orthologs that do
not overlap but remain adjacent in the genome of the
other species (Table 3). The 226 human overlapping gene
pairs were significantly longer (z' = 2.53, p = 5.7e-3, MannWhitney U-test [44], Table 3) and had more exons (z' =
2.72, p = 3.3e-3) than the mouse orthologs, when compared to the set of conserved overlapping genes (Table 3).
Similarly, the 171 human orthologs of mouse overlapping gene pairs were shorter (z' = 2.95, p = 1.6e-3) and
were formed with fewer exons (z' = 2.28, p = 1.1e-2) than
the conserved overlapping pairs. In addition, non-con-

served overlapping gene pairs tended to significantly overlap in their UTRs for both human (chi-square = 23.4, p =

cancer transcriptome obtained by massive pyrosequencing [46]. To be able to detect the expression of transcripts
normally expressed at low levels, we used a normalized
cDNA library (see Methods). For this reason, our analysis
is mostly qualitative and aims to detect the reciprocal
expression of genes involved in overlap. Although global
gene expression can result quantitatively altered by the
tumorous condition, a significant modification in the pattern of reciprocal expression between overlapping genes is
unlikely. We defined three patterns of reciprocal expression: co-expression, when both genes were represented in
the library; discordant expression, for OG pairs in which
expression is observed for only one gene in the pair; and
no expression, for OGs whose expression was not
detected. Figure 4 shows the frequencies of these three
expression patterns in the breast cancer library, by grouping the OG pairs according to the type of overlap.

The structural analysis of orthologs of human and mouse
overlapping genes that remain adjacent but lack the superimposition shows that the overlap formation is frequently
associated with an increase in gene size and exon number.
We therefore suggest that the overlap between adjacent
genes may originate by species-specific acquisition of
additional, non-coding exons. In agreement with our
results, most of the loci analyzed by the ENCODE consortium were found to possess distal 5' non-coding exons
which map into neighboring genes and tend to be tissueor cell-line-specific [45].
Expression patterns of overlapping gene pairs
In order to evaluate whether the presence of overlap is a
mechanism for regulation of gene expression, we used the
human OGC dataset to cross-examine a human breast

The observed rate of co-expression in the whole dataset
was 27.6%, while the percentage of discordant expressed
OGs was 42.5%. Taking into account the overall coverage

of known genes in our cDNA library, the co-expression
rate is four times higher than expected by the random
probability of having any two genes expressed at the same
time in the library (7.3%). Therefore, OGs showed a significant tendency to be co-expressed (upper cumulative
distribution function, p = 6.7e-102). It should be noted
that we obtained significant co-expression even though
we removed all sequences mapping to more than one
gene in the same cluster (see Methods). Such filtering step
likely led to an underestimation of the level of co-expression of overlapping genes, but it did not influence the
final result. By contrast, the percentage of discordantly
expressed genes is not significantly different from random
expectation (upper cumulative distribution function, p =
0.043). Previous studies reported higher co-expression
rates, ranging from 35.1% to 44.9% [10,47], with the differences likely due to experimental design (i. e. differences
in the starting dataset) and in the number of analyzed tissues.
Considering the different overlapping arrangements, we
also observed that co-expression was significantly higher
for both convergent (chi-square = 4.69, p= 3.03e-2) and
divergent OGs (chi-square = 4.28, p= 3.85e-2), when
compared to the frequency of the complete overlaps. On
the opposite, we observed no statistically significant differences among overlapping arrangements when considering discordantly expressed OGs. Taken together, these
results further support the hypothesis that gene overlap
might be used to co-ordinate expression of adjacent genes.

Conclusion
Our work shows for the first time that overlap between
protein coding genes, although widespread, is counterselected during Metazoan evolution. We also show that
overlap retention does not occur randomly, since it preferentially involves gene pairs lying on opposite DNA
strands and sharing non-coding regions. The features of
retained OGCs suggest a likely role for overlap in the
reciprocal regulation of neighboring genes. The evidence
that OGs are significantly co-expressed in the breast cancer transcriptome further supports this hypothesis. In
addition, the poor conservation of overlap during evolution, and the fact that formation/loss of the overlapping
arrangement is related to changes in gene structure,
mostly occurring within non-coding regions, points to
this as a species-specific mechanism. As non-coding
regions generally have fewer constraints on their primary
sequence, the tendency to confine the overlap to non-coding regions may achieve co-regulation without forcing two
functional protein-coding genes to co-evolve. We might
speculate that this tendency would ultimately result in the
evolution of overlapping non-coding transcripts optimized for the regulation of their protein-coding partner.

RIKEN database (Fantom 3.0) and the UCSC collection of
mouse cDNAs (Mm7 assembly), while for fly and worm
we used Flybase (FlyBase r4.2) and Wormbase (WormBase WS140), respectively [50-53].
The genomic position of each sequence was mapped on
the corresponding genome by using BLAT [54] (human
Build 35; mouse Build 34; zebra fish Zv4; fly Release 4;
worm WS120). The pairs of genes whose genomic coordinates partially or totally overlap were extracted and
grouped in OGCs. Filters were adopted to avoid (a) splice
variants of the same gene, and (b) artifacts due to the position mapping. We considered each pair of cDNAs sharing
three or more exons as splice variants of the same gene if
more than 20% of the exon number overlapped. In the
case of cDNAs with two or less exons, we considered them
as splice variants if at least one residue overlapped at the
exon level. For each group of predicted splice variants,
only the longest gene was taken as gene representative.
Artifacts such as the inclusion of the mRNA poly-A in the
gene mapping were avoided by excluding all the 3' exons
composed of more than 70% of one single nucleotide.
Statistical null model for the overlap formation
For all five species analyzed, the gene positions of the
unique gene sets were randomly reassigned within the
corresponding chromosomes with no constraints in the
type of overlaps, the reciprocal arrangement, and the
number of genes per cluster. The analysis was repeated for
10 rounds and the resulting number of overlapping genes,
overlapping gene pairs, and overlapping gene clusters
were counted at each round. The average number was considered for comparison with the observed dataset. Features of the OGCs, such as the reciprocal arrangement, the
component distribution and the type of overlapping
region were also analyzed.

The fraction of overlaps that results in sense/antisense
complementarity at the mRNA level were calculated by
extracting all overlap that occur on opposite strands and
involve exons of both genes. The statistical significance of
the difference between the observed and the random set
was assessed by applying a chi-squared test (degree of freedom = 1) to the resulting 2 × 2 contingency matrix [44].
Benchmark
To test the specificity of the data produced, we performed
a manual analysis of the D. rerio dataset (108 OGCs). No
obvious false positive due to the methodology could be
found. The sensitivity of our method was assessed by
benchmarking the derived set against an extensive collection of overlapping genes previously reported. We
included 8 independent large-scale screenings of human
antisense transcripts/nested genes [9,13,27,29,30,55-57]
and about 100 experimental studies on specific overlap-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/174

ping gene pairs (Additional files 5 and 6). OGCs reported
in the literature with no match in our dataset were
checked manually. The main reasons for the lack of coverage were due to the selection criteria (i. e. we deliberately
excluded pseudogenes or non-coding RNAs which were
instead included in some large-scale screenings). Only 5
cases were found to be false negatives, giving an estimate
specificity of 99%.
Orthology assignment
The orthology relationships between the overlapping
genes in the five analyzed species were assessed by using a
two-step procedure (Figure 3A). First, for all pairs of species we carried out all-against-all tBLASTx [58] between
the corresponding cDNA sets. The best reciprocal hits
between two species were assigned as orthologous genes.
Secondly, we derived orthologous overlapping genes by
extracting all overlapping genes conserved between each
pair of species.
Gene structure analysis
We compared the gene structure of the conserved OGCs
between human and mouse with human and mouse overlapping genes whose orthologs do not overlap but are
adjacent in the genome of the other species. The first set
(conserved overlapping genes between human and
mouse; the first column in Table 3) was composed of 282
pairs of overlapping genes, while the second (overlapping
in human but adjacent in mouse chromosomes; the second column in Table 3), and the third (overlapping in
mouse but adjacent in human chromosomes; the third
column in Table 3) were composed of 226 and 171 gene
pairs, respectively. For each gene, we measured the gene
length, defined as the genomic coordinates on the corresponding chromosome, and the exon numbers, as derived
from the BLAT output. Using the Mann-Whitney U-test
[44] we compared gene length difference between the first
and the second sets, and between the first and the third
sets to assess the statistical significance of the difference in
gene structure.

We also analyzed the feature of the region (UTR or coding) involved in the overlap for all OGCs in the 3 sets, by
counting the number of detectable overlaps after removing the UTRs. In this case, the statistical significance of the
difference between the first and the second sets and the
first and the third set were assessed by applying a chisquared test (degree of freedom = 1) to the resulting 2 × 2
contingency matrix [44].
Analysis of OGC expression in breast cancer
cDNA was obtained from polyadenylated breast cancer
RNA (purity 85–90%). cDNA was normalized after
reverse transcription to obtain a balanced mix of low and
high abundance mRNA, as previously described [59]. 2.1

micrograms of normalized, double-strand cDNA were
then converted to a single strand library using the 454
protocol [46]. Two independent cDNA libraries were generated with an average length per sequence read of 100
and 200 nt, respectively. A total of 198,658 non-redundant sequence reads, according to NCBI non-redundant
database, were sequenced from each breast cancer cDNA
library. The entire library was mapped against the 249,953
sequences of the human "all_mrna" transcript dataset
from the UCSC human genome. A total of 37,774 reads
corresponding to a specific cDNA and its related isoforms
was identified (requiring blat perfect matches, 95% of the
read covered by alignment). The reads were then aligned
to the human RefSeq cDNA dataset from UCSC (25,922
sequences) requiring perfect coverage. 9,082 distinct
matches were finally obtained, which were used for the
subsequent calculations.
Reads-to-gene assignment was performed by blasting the
nucleotide sequences of all OGs to the library. Only reads
showing 100% identity with a transcript were used in the
analyses. To ensure the 454 sequences were unambiguously matched to the assigned transcript, we removed
reads mapped to more than one locus. Since the 454
sequencing process does not involve in-vivo cloning and
the cDNA is subjected to nebulization, in the deriving
library it is not possible to assign the strand when the two
transcripts overlap. Thus, we removed all sequence reads
mapping to more than one gene within the same cluster.
In total, 36 out of 3701 reads were removed, corresponding to an estimated loss of 0.9%, which likely did not create a significant bias.
The statistical significance for the enrichment of coexpression in overlapping gene pairs was evaluated by an
upper cumulative distribution function.
