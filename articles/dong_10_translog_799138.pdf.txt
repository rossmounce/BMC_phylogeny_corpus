Abstract
Background: Increasing amount of data from comparative genomics, and newly developed
technologies producing accurate gene expression data facilitate the study of the expression
divergence of homologous genes. Previous studies have individually highlighted factors that
contribute to the expression divergence of duplicate genes, e.g. promoter changes, exon structure
heterogeneity, asymmetric histone modifications and genomic neighborhood conservation.
However, there is a lack of a tool to integrate multiple factors and visualize their variety among
homologous genes in a straightforward way.
Results: We introduce Translog (a web-based tool for Transcriptome comparison of
homologous genes) that assists in the comparison of homologous genes by displaying the loci in
three different views: promoter view for studying the sharing/turnover of transcription initiations,
exon structure for displaying the exon-intron structure changes, and genomic neighborhood to
show the macro-synteny conservation in a larger scale. CAGE data for transcription initiation are
mapped for each transcript and can be used to study transcription turnover and expression
changes. Alignment anchors between homologous loci can be used to define the precise
homologous transcripts. We demonstrate how these views can be used to visualize the changes of
homologous genes during evolution, particularly after the 2R and 3R whole genome duplication.
Conclusion: We have developed a web-based tool for assisting in the transcriptome comparison
of homologous genes, facilitating the study of expression divergence.

Background
One of the challenges in the post-genomic era is to
understand the mechanisms which drive the divergence
of gene expression, and how this causes phenotypic

changes, ultimately leading to the evolution of new
species [1-6]. This is important both at the level of
orthologs (genes separated by a speciation even) and
paralogs (genes separated by a duplication event). For

example, PAX6, the most studied Pax gene, is a “master
control” gene for the development of eyes and sensory
organs, and other homologous structures, usually derived
from ectodermal tissues [7]. Its protein function is highly
conserved across bilaterian species: mouse PAX6 can
trigger eye development in D. melanogaster [8]. However,
genomic organization of genes sharing the ancestry with
the human PAX6 and its immediate neighborhood varies
considerably among species, with differences in the
number and distribution of exons, cis-regulatory elements
and transcription start sites. For paralogous genes, derived
from gene duplication or whole genome duplication, it
has been shown that duplicate genes increase expression
divergence and enable tissue or developmental specialization to evolve, as shown in mammals [9], fish [10],
worm[10], yeast[11], and plants[12]. By comparing the
transcription patterns of duplicate genes, we can often
trace the factors that influence the expression pattern
changes in evolution.
At the genomic level, previous studies have focused on
examining the relationship between the divergence of
gene expression and type of the promoter[13], exon
structure[14], TSS turnover[14], genomic neighborhood
[15], cis-regulatory inputs [16], histone modifications
[17], and recently, the DNA-encoded nucleosome
organization of promoters , possibly further complicated
by external environmental factors are involved [18].
The increasing volume of available transcriptome data
such as CAGE[19] and RNA-seq [20] for different
developmental stages and tissues for different species
can be harnessed to understand the mechanisms of
spatiotemporal expression changes of genes that share a
(not so ancient) common ancestor. The investigation
should start with the integrated analysis of the available
data. A suitable tool for this type of analysis should
enable the comparison of homologous genes on
different scales, from the position and activity of their
proximal promoters to the corresponding information
on their long-range regulatory inputs. Similar tools, like
the comparative genome viewer in DBTSS[21], also
contribute to compare the promoter and transcripts for
homolog genes, but they don’t use high-throughput
sequencing like CAGE and their visualization methods
are not so enhanced. In this paper, we describe Translog
(the tool for Transcriptome comparison of homologs)
[22], a web-based application providing 1) a promoter
view where a region containing all proximal promoters
of a gene’s transcript(s) is aligned to its homolog and
cross-mapped between the two loci using alignment
anchors, 2) a gene structure view where a gene’s exonintron structure is compared to that of its homolog,
alongside its transcriptional features, and 3) a genomic
neighborhood view which displays the neighbors of a gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/S1/S59

in a large flanking region, and show their conservation in
the homologous loci. CAGE data is displayed along with
the genomic features to indicate the expression of
transcripts. We demonstrate how Translog can be used
to discover and visualize homologous relationships,
expression pattern changes after duplication or speciation, and to explore the divergences of promoter usage,
gene structure and genomic neighborhood between two
homologs. We anticipate that Translog will be useful in
looking for the factors of impacting expression divergence between two homologous genes, and finally
contribute to understanding the mechanism of evolution
of gene expression.

Methods
Gen(om)e annotations
To define the promoter region and gene structure, we use
the gene name and genomic locations of all Ensembl
genes and transcripts from Ensembl v52 [23]. Currently,
these include three genomes (human, mouse and
zebrafish): 25233 genes in D. rerio (assembly version
7), 37436 in H. sapiens (assembly NCBI Build 36.1), and
31805 in M. musculus (assembly NCBI Build 37). We use
these three species because i) there is CAGE data
available for them, and ii) comparison of human:
human, zebrafish:zebrafish paralogs can reveal the
expression changes along with 1R/2R, 3R whole genome
duplication, respectively. The orthologs (human:mouse,
human:zebrafish, human:tetraodon) and paralogs
(human:human) were downloaded from Ensembl Compara v52 [23], using BioMart[24]. For zebrafish:zebrafish
paralogs, instead of taking all paralogs from Ensembl, we
are primarily interested in those duplicates arisen in the
event of fish-specific WGD. For the latter, we used
human:zebrafish orthologs as a bridge (approximating
ancestral genome before WGD) to extract those zebrafish
gene pairs which have the same human ortholog genes.
RefSeq genes were downloaded from refGene table in
UCSC Table Browser (on 2009-08-01) for each genome.
Defining TSS using CAGE tag clusters
In order to define CAGE TSSes and clusters, we used all
publicly available CAGE tags (from http://fantom.gsc.
riken.jp/4/download/, [25]) for human (hg18) and
mouse (mm9). We used only uniquely mapping tags
and clustered CAGE tags into tag clusters (TCs) if the
member tags map to the same chromosome strand and
overlap by at least 1 bp. For each TC we defined a
representative location (as that supported by the highest
number of tags). Afterwards, we grouped TCs into Sharp
or Broad promoters using previous classification algorithm [26]. TCs are mapped to Ensembl genes on the
[-500 bp, +500 bp] region around Ensembl TSS. If
multiple TCs map to a given region, the one with the

Page 2 of 7

BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11(Suppl 1):S59

highest number of tags per million (tpm) is selected as
representative TC for the gene.
Alignments of homologous loci
To align two homologous loci, we used UCSC chain and
net alignment data [27], which is a whole genome
alignment by blastz [28]. Any alignment block in the
UCSC chain database is taken as an anchor to link two
loci. If a region in the reference species aligns to only one
locus in the target species, we denoted it as a 1-to-1
anchor; otherwise, we extracted the overlapping parts of
M (two or more) anchors and defined as 1-to-M anchor.
For those having many (M > 2) aligned loci (e.g. genes
by tandem duplication or from a large protein family),
we only took the two highest scoring ones and display
them as 1-to-2 anchors. The 1-to-2 mammal:zebrafish
orthologs originating from teleost whole-genome duplication are expected to have 1-to-2 anchors. To distinguish the anchors from different scenarios, we marked
them in different colors (by default, 1-to-1 anchors in
gray, and 1-to-2 in blue: see Figure 1).

For human:human homolog comparison, we used the
UCSC selfChain alignment to generate the anchors for
paralogous loci. If no selfChain anchors are found, a link
to Ensembl clustalW alignment is given. For zebrafish:
zebrafish, we used human:zebrafish 1-to-2 chain alignment as a bridge to get zebrafish:zebrafish alignment due
to the absence of zebrafish selfChain data at present. This
method cannot detect the region only conserved
between two zebrafish loci, but not conserved in
human, for example those fast evolving regions specific
in human lineage [29]; on the other hand, it can provide
insight into the probable ancestral state of the locus[6].

Results and discussion
Identification of homologous genes
We extracted an initial homolog set from Ensembl
Compara [30,31]. Out of 21416 human protein-coding

alignment anchors.

genes, 79% and 51% have orthologs in mouse and
zebrafish respectively. There are 29721 human:human
paralog pair combinations altogether. To investigate how
many of them are duplicates from 1R/2R WGD we
grouped the paralogs by their last common ancestor. As
shown in Figure S1, the largest category, which includes
~8400 human duplicates, falls in the time span before
the split between bony fish (e.g. zebrafish) and
tetrapods, and after the split between lancelets and
jawless fish. This corresponds well with the proposed 1R/
2R WGD timing (see Figure S1 in Additional file 1).
Out of all human:zebrafish 1-to-2 orthologous genes, we
wanted to determine how many date from teleostspecific WGD (3R WGD in Figure S1 in Additional file
1). To exclude the cases which have arisen by zebrafishspecific tandem duplications, ideally we should infer it
from phylogenetic tree. A recent study [32], which
identified gene duplicates retained from the last,
teleost-specific WGD, found 615 human:zebrafish orthologs from the teleost WGD with high or medium
confidence; most (94%) of them are included in the 1to-2 orthologs we have defined here.
To study the expression divergence and differential
promoter use of orthologous genes, we mapped CAGE
tag clusters (TCs) to the human and mouse Ensembl
genes. Most of the CAGE tags have a corresponding
tissue in mouse and human in which they were detected.
Only 7 out of 55 of those tissues in mouse do not have
corresponding human tissue, whereas all the human
tissues have corresponding mouse tissues (see Table S1
in Additional file 1). If multiple TCs map to one gene,
the TC with the highest expression is chosen as
representative TC. ~90% of the 1-to-1 orthologous
gene pairs (13895 pairs in total) have at least one TC
associated with them in both species.

Comparing transcriptional initiation in homologous
genes using Translog
Users can compare homologous genes and their CAGE
data in three different views (Promoter, Gene structure,
and Genomic neighborhood, see Figure 2A) through the
links in the top-left corner of the Translog start page (see
Figure 2B). The ‘Promoter’ view shows a region covering
all transcription start sites (from both Ensembl transcripts and RefSeq genes) and extends 500 bp upstream
and downstream (Figure 2B). The ‘Gene structure’ view
shows the exon-intron structures of the pair of homologs
(Figure 2C). The ‘Genomic neighborhood’ view shows
the conservation of the query gene and its neighborhoods using the anchor of gene homology (Figure 2D).
Translog currently supports comparison of human:
human, human:mouse, human:zebrafish and zebrafish:

zebrafish (not for zebrafish CAGE data right now). We
aim to expand this list in the future to provide other
perspectives or enable the study of other instances of
whole-genome duplications, after the suitable genome
assemblies and expression data become available. The
first on the list are the new Zv8 zebrafish genome
alignment data (whose annotation is still incomplete at
present) and the upcoming zebrafish CAGE data,
followed by the lamprey genome for studying the 2R
whole genome duplication directly.
Basic usage
For any supported query identifier (Ensembl gene ID,
HGNC gene symbol or gene synonyms), the browser
shows CAGE data and corresponding genomic features
relevant to the input query. In the right corner of each
page there are links to the external resources (e.g.
Synorth [33], Ancora [34], UCSC Browser [27], Ensembl
[30] and Vista[35]) for each displayed region.
Promoter view
We define a (proximal) promoter region as a 1000 bp
region centering on the TSS of a transcript. A genomic
region spanned by the union of all promoter regions for
the query gene is displayed in the reference genome,
same for the target genome. Alignment anchors (if any)
are also displayed linking the two loci, which can assist
the user in mapping the homology of transcription start
sites. This is particularly useful if a gene has several
transcripts with different TSSes. For example, in
Figure 2B, the human gene MEIS1 has 6 transcription
isoforms with four different TSSes while its mouse
ortholog Meis1 has 3 transcripts with two different
TSSes. Most of the TSSes are covered by CAGE tag cluster,
with different peak heights (corresponding to tissueweighted expression level).

After we align the transcripts of the two genes by the
alignment anchors (the gray bar between the red frame
and green frame in Figure 2B), we can inspect the sharing
and turnover of TSSes between the homologous transcripts. For example, the leftmost transcripts (the black
dotted frame ① in Figure 2B) of the two Meis1 genes
apparently share a CAGE cluster, indicating a shared
ancestry of this particular promoter. On the other hand,
the transcript with strongest expression (② in Figure 2B)
in human MEIS1 does not have a CAGE cluster in the
same position in its orthologous transcript in mouse.
Looking at the difference in peak heights of each CAGE
cluster, we can spot cases in which the most highly
expressed transcript in one gene is not always the most
expressed one in its ortholog. Compared to the methods
used by previous studies (e.g. [14]), Translog can be used
to define pairs of homologous transcripts more precisely.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/S1/S59

Gene structure view
In this view, we define a transcript region as a region
containing a transcript and a 500 bp flanking region
both upstream and downstream of it. Analogously to the
Promoter view, a region spanning the union of all
transcripts for the query gene will be displayed for both
loci, along with the anchors connecting them. By linking
two homologous genes with alignment anchors, this
view can be used to distinguish the structural heterogeneity of the coding region and pinpoint major
differences in intron-exon structure and splice form
usage between related genes. Figure 2C shows human
PAX6 locus along with its two zebrafish not all human
PAX6 exons are conserved in zebrafish; the 4th exon of
ENST00000379123 is not conserved at all, while its
second exon is only conserved in zebrafish pax6a.

After assigning the CAGE cluster to its transcript, the user
can also investigate the relationship of expression
changes and exon structure heterogeneity between
homologous genes. Park et al.[14] classified each pair
of duplicate genes into one of two structural categories:
completely similar and incompletely similar. The latter
were further classified in one of the three non-overlapping groups: 5’ similar, 3’ similar, and neither 5’ nor
3’ similar, with different extent of expression correlation.
Using the ‘Gene structure’ view in Translog, the study of
these kinds of correlations can be enhanced by quantifying the exon structure similarity only for those transcript
pairs with shared TSS, instead of classifying them into a
limited number of categories.

Genomic neighborhood view
This view displays the gene contents and CAGE data in a
wider region around the query gene (see Methods). For
human:zebrafish, we used the synteny blocks from[36].
For comparisons whose split events are too close (e.g.
human:mouse ortholog from ~80 Myr ago) or too far (e.
g. human:human paralogs from 1R/2R WGD ~550 Myr
ago), we used a 2 Mb region centering on the query gene
and its homologs. This view can be used to detect the
synteny blocks dating from ancient segmental or whole
genome duplications. For example, three genes in the
human SP3 gene locus (RAPGEF4, CDCA7 and
AC018470.2 [synonym of SP9]) also have paralogs next
to SP4 (RAPGEF5, CDCA7L and SP8, respectively; see
Figure 2D), with conserved gene order and orientation.
This indicates that SP3 and its paralogous gene SP4 are
not a consequence of the SP gene family expansion, but
rather from duplications of whole loci, most likely whole
genome duplications. Moreover, we found that the
neighborhood synteny for SP3 is also conserved in
another paralogous locus in which the arrangement of
ZAK, SP3 and SP9 is mirrored by their paralogs ZPK, SP1

and SP7, respectively (Figure S2 in Additional file 1).
This suggests that SP3 and SP1 neighborhoods arose
from another duplication event, distinct of that that
separated the ancestral neighborhoods of SP3 and SP4.
But which duplication event occurred first? A previous
study [37] found that SP1 and SP3 are more closely
related to each other, and that their common ancestor
was split from the ancestral form of SP4 by an earlier
duplications. However, according to the picture (Figure
S2 in Additional file 1) that we get from the synteny
data, a more parsimonious explanation is that the gene
content of SP1 and SP4 neighborhoods are from the
result of a complementary gene loss after a recent
duplication, while SP3 locus is an out-group to them.

Conclusion
Translog is designed for studying the gene expression
divergence of homologous genes across vertebrate
genomes or paralogous loci within a genome. Based on
the homology and CAGE expression data available for
human, mouse and zebrafish, it provides a genome
browser for visualizing and assessing the difference
between homologous genes, on three different levels:
promoter usage, gene structure changes, and genomic
neighborhood conservation. One of the novel features of
Translog is the possibility to display the comparison of
two genomic loci in one browser by using alignment
anchors. CAGE data is used to identify the true
transcription start sites, measure the expression strength,
and define the turnover or shift of promoter usage
between homologous features. We anticipate that
Translog will be highly useful for examining the factors
that influence expression divergence between homologous genes.
