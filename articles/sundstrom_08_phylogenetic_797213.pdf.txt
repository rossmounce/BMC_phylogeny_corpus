Abstract
Background: Ever since the theory about two rounds of genome duplication (2R) in the
vertebrate lineage was proposed, the Hox gene clusters have served as the prime example of
quadruplicate paralogy in mammalian genomes. In teleost fishes, the observation of additional Hox
clusters absent in other vertebrate lineages suggested a third tetraploidization (3R). Because the
Hox clusters occupy a quite limited part of each chromosome, and are special in having positiondependent regulation within the multi-gene cluster, studies of syntenic gene families are needed to
determine the extent of the duplicated chromosome segments. We have analyzed in detail 14 gene
families that are syntenic with the Hox clusters to see if their phylogenies are compatible with the
Hox duplications and the 2R/3R scenario. Our starting point was the gene family for the NPY family
of peptides located near the Hox clusters in the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes, the zebrafish Danio
rerio, and human.
Results: Seven of the gene families have members on at least three of the human Hox
chromosomes and two families are present on all four. Using both neighbor-joining and quartetpuzzling maximum likelihood methods we found that 13 families have a phylogeny that supports
duplications coinciding with the Hox cluster duplications. One additional family also has a topology
consistent with 2R but due to lack of urochordate or cephalocordate sequences the time window
when these duplications could have occurred is wider. All but two gene families also show teleostspecific duplicates.
Conclusion: Based on this analysis we conclude that the Hox cluster duplications involved a large
number of adjacent gene families, supporting expansion of these families in the 2R, as well as in the
teleost 3R tetraploidization. The gene duplicates presumably provided raw material in early
vertebrate evolution for neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.

Background
The presence of several paralogous gene regions, forming
so-called paralogons [1] with gene family members on
two to four chromosomes in mammals, has been taken as
evidence for two rounds of whole genome duplication

"2R", deduced to have taken place in the ancestor of vertebrates [1-11]. The Hox gene clusters (located on human
chromosomes 2, 7, 12 and 17) have been used as the
prime example of quadruplicate paralogy in vertebrate
genomes, reviewed by Hoegg and Meyer [12], as comPage 1 of 14

pared to the single Hox cluster in the cephalochordate lineage [13]. Until recently the number of Hox clusters in
cartilaginous fishes has been unclear. The sequencing of
the elephant shark genome (Callorhinchus milii) established that four Hox-clusters were already present in the
ancestor of jawed vertebrates [14]. The Hox clusters are
also known to be special in many ways, particularly in the
way they are transcriptionally regulated [15]. Tunicate
species like Ciona intestinalis and Oikopleura dioika, which
have broken Hox clusters [16-18], are considered to be
exceptions from the linear organization of vertebrate and
cephalochordate Hox clusters, because the linear cluster
of Hox genes was present in the last common ancestor of
all bilaterians and possibly before the origin of Cnidarians
[15,19].
In ray-finned fishes, an additional tetraploidization (3R)
has been inferred based on the occurrence additional Hox
clusters not present in other vertebrate lineages [12,2022]. This has been confirmed using whole genome data
from fully sequenced teleosts [23-27]. The study of Hox
genes as well as other gene families in several species of
actinopterygians has further indicated that the duplication event took place early in the evolution of actinopterygians [22,28]. It has also been proposed that the high
number of duplicate genes created in 3R was in part
involved in the radiation of teleost fishes [28-30]. The
great number of species within the Euteleostei as compared to more basal actinopterygians supports the idea
that genome duplication and speciation are linked
[24,28] even though there seem to be a large time span
between the duplication event and the actual radiation of
euteleosts [31,32]. Several teleost lineages, for example
Cyprinidae, Salmonidae, and Catostomidae [33-36] are
known polyploids of relatively recent origin. The relation
between polyploidy and speciation is not yet fully clear
but it is worth noting that several species-rich fish clades
are polyploids [37]. Both the existence of tetraploids and
evidence of independent gene duplications indicate that
fish genomes are in some sense more "plastic" than
genomes in other vertebrates [29].
After duplication, the genes can undergo nonfunctionalization, subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. It
has been calculated that a duplicated gene in general has
an average half-life of approximately 4 million years
before it will be silenced [38]. But there are also examples
of genes that have recently become pseudogenes even if
the duplication took place a long time ago. Some of those
examples are the Hoxb7 gene in Takifugu rubripes [39] and
many of the olfactory genes in hominids [40]. Another
example is the neuropeptide Y receptor Y6 that arose very
early in vertebrate evolution and later has been mutated to
become a pseudogene seemingly independently in many
mammalian lineages [41]. The rate of retention of genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/254

after duplication has been investigated in several lineages.
The obtained values vary considerably depending on species and time since tetraploidization, for example 8–16%
in yeast [42-44], 15–24% for teleosts after 3R [25,45,46],
30% in Arabidopsis after its last tetraploidization [47] and
about 50% after the salmonid tetraploidization [30]. It
also seems like there is (at least in Arabidopsis) a connection between "survival" after the first and any subsequent
genome duplications. Genes that have been preserved
after the first tetraploidization are more likely to be
retained after subsequent tetraploidization [48]. However, several factors obscure analyses of old duplication
events, such as the frequent loss of genes after duplication,
gene conversion and unequal evolutionary rates of paralogs. Because of this the use of the topology of phylogenetic trees as the only criterion for inferring block
duplications is not sufficient and the symmetrical (A, B),
(C, D) topology expected by two duplication events is
rarely seen [9,49]. We believe that a combination of phylogenetic and map-based approaches using several species
is much more useful to resolve the evolutionary history of
gene families as has been pointed out earlier [50,51].
Although there is evidence for at least one tetraploidization in early vertebrate evolution the concept of two basal
vertebrate tetraploidizations has been difficult to establish
until recent studies that used both phylogenetic and positional information [11] or only the latter [10] from several
sequenced vertebrate genomes. The recent publication of
the amphioxus genome confirmed quadruplication of
gene regions in gnathostomes [52].
Because each Hox cluster is located in a rather limited part
of its chromosome, studies of more gene families are
needed to fully understand the evolutionary history of the
Hox-bearing chromosomes. In this work we have performed phylogenetic analyses of gene families located
near the Hox clusters in several vertebrates in order to see
if there are additional gene families with an evolutionary
history similar to that of the Hox clusters. Our starting
point in this work was the position of the genes coding for
neuropeptide Y (NPY) family peptides in the pufferfish
Takifugu rubripes and the zebrafish Danio rerio compared
to the positions in the human genome.

Results
In total, 14 protein families predicted by the Ensembl
database were studied in detail (see Fig. 1A–D and Additional files 1 and 2). Some of these families were further
divided into subfamilies based on positions of invertebrate sequences in the initial phylogenetic analysis. Species included in the initial analysis were chosen in order
to achieve relative dating of the duplications, thus avoiding analyses of duplication events that occurred before the
emergence of chordates (see methods).

gene families analyzed in this study (A: IGFBP, B: NFE, C: AOC and D: G6PC). All trees constructed with the NJ method as
implemented in Clustal W 1.81 with 1000 bootstrap replicates (values shown for each node). For IGFBP, sequences without
the domains PF00219 (Insulin-like growth factor binding protein) and PF00086 (Thyroglobulin type-1 repeat) were removed
from the alignment. Note that the tree contains two subfamilies relevant for this paralogon. Hsa is human (Homo sapiens),
Mmu: Mouse (Mus musculus), Dre: zebrafish (Danio rerio), Tru: fugu (Takifugu rubripes), Tni: tetraodon (Tetraodon nigroviridis), Cin: (Ciona intestinalis), Brf (Branchiostoma floridae) and Dme: (Drosophila melanogaster). For complete phylogenetic
analysis of all 14 families see Additional files 1 and 2.

Three families in addition to the 14 analyzed families fulfilled the selection criteria (see methods) but had to be
excluded for technical reasons, namely because repeated
domains made the sequences difficult to align, thereby
precluding reliable phylogenetic analyses. These families
were ASB (ankyrin-repeat proteins with a SOCS box),
HDAC (histone deacetylase) and MGAT (mannoside
acetylglucosaminyltransferase).
For some of the fish sequences no clear human orthologs
are found in the phylogenetic trees (one such example is
the NR1D tree where the fish genes are clustered together

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/254

without any tetrapod sequence). However, when chromosome position information is taken into account it
becomes apparent that there is conserved synteny
between fish and human chromosomes indicated by
striped boxes in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5. For a majority of the phylogenetic trees the topologies in the NJ and ML analysis
are in agreement (see Additional files 1 and 2).
Gene families represented on four human Hox
chromosomes

part of a loosely defined superfamily [53]. The IGFBP fam-

families not analyzed with phylogenetic methods in this study (NPY and Hox). Striped boxes indicate genes for which phylogeny is inconclusive but where the positional information is in agreement with the proposed paralogon. Boxes denoted "*" for
Takifugu rubripes Hox clusters indicates that the Hox cluster is scattered on multiple scaffolds, due to incomplete assembly of
the genome. Note that two separate parts of Tetraodon nigroviridis chromosome 2 displays conserved synteny with human
chromosome 2 and 17.

ily studied here is comprised by the six members with
high-affinity binding to insulin and is represented on all
four of the human HOX-bearing chromosomes. On both
Hsa 2 and 7 they appear as gene pairs resulting from a
duplication before the separation of the branch leading to
the mammals and the branch leading to the teleosts (see
discussion). Both of these pairs display retained 3R copies
in at least one fish species for each gene (Fig. 1A). One
Takifugu rubripes gene, called Tru.sc149.a in Fig. 1A,
appears in an unexpected position in the tree. However,
this sequence has a deviating segment compared to all
other IGFBP sequences, probably due to difficulties with
exon-intron prediction in the database. In our quartet
puzzling maximum likelihood analysis (Additional file
2), this gene product clusters with the Tetraodon nigroviridis sequence Tni.2, favoring orthology in agreement
with the chromosomal position (Fig. 2). This family has

recently been studied by others [54] giving a similar topology but with a different interpretation of the evolutionary
history of this gene family (see discussion).
NFE2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2) family members are
involved in gene transcription and due to the presence of
four genes located in the vicinity of all four Hox clusters,
this family has previously been suggested to have had a
similar evolutionary history as the Hox clusters [55,56].
Our results are compatible with such a scenario but the
topology in our tree is somewhat difficult to interpret (Fig.
1B), especially regarding identification of fish orthologs.
This is probably due to problems with obtaining a reliable
alignment for this family because the paralogs only have
a short conserved domain in otherwise divergent
sequences. Nevertheless, all genes display conserved synteny and have evolved in a time frame consistent with 2R.

Gene families represented on three human Hox
chromosomes
DLX genes form gene pairs on three of the chromosomes
(2, 7 and 17) in the Hox paralogon. Three of these human
genes (one on each chromosome) cluster in the phylogenetic trees with genes that were duplicated in fishes (Additional files, figures 1B and 2B). The Dlx family is a widely
studied family with important functions in vertebrate
development [57]. Our results confirm an early local
duplication followed by chromosome duplication for this
family as previously suggested [58-61].

IGF2BP, IGF-2-mRNA binding proteins, also called IMPs,
are part of an mRNA localization and transport system.
The family has members on three of the human chromosomes analyzed in the study. It has previously been suggested that the family originated by duplications before
the vertebrate radiation [62,63]. Our phylogenetic analy-

ses support an origin in 2R and also an expansion in the
zebrafish in 3R (Additional files, figures 1E and 2E).
SLC4A is a family that is part of the solute carrier superfamily and catalyzes transmembrane bicarbonate transport in the anion exchanger (AE) subfamily [64]. Others
have recently analyzed a larger part of this superfamily
resulting in a similar tree topology [54]. The family has
members on Hsa 2, 7 and 17 and as in many of the other
gene families, only one case where both copies resulting
from 3R have been retained (Additional files, figures 1K
and 2K).
SMARCD, SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actindependent regulators of chromatin (SMARC) is a family
involved in chromatin remodeling complexes [65]. We
have studied one subfamily with three human members
(located on chromosomes 7, 12 and 17). It seems like a
lineage-specific duplication has occurred in Ciona, but the

studied one subfamily with the human members located
on chromosomes 2, 7 and 17 (Fig. 6). In one case 3R is
clearly visible in the tree (Additional files, figures 1I and
2I).
RAR, Retinoic acid receptors, a gene family belonging to
the nuclear receptor superfamily (see below).
Gene families represented on two human hox
chromosomes
Nuclear receptors
The gene families belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, RAR, THR and NR1D, have been studied previously [68,69] with similar results as obtained in this
study. The NR1D and THR families have members on Hsa
3 and 17, and the RAR family also includes a member on
Hsa 12. Some duplicates from 3R are also retained (Additional files, figures 1H, J and 1M and 2H, J and 2M) and
these display conserved synteny with their mammalian
orthologs (Fig. 2, 4 and 5). It should be noted that the
timing for the duplications is uncertain in the NR1D family with one Branchiostoma floridae sequence clustering
together with orthologs of the vertebrate NR1D1
sequences, however with low bootstrap support (see
Additional files, figures. 1H and 2H).

AOC, (amine oxidase) gene family (Fig. 1C) belongs to
the copper-binding amino oxidase superfamily. The
human members in this study include one on chromosome 7 and two on chromosome 17. The chromosomal
locations are as expected by block duplication in early vertebrate evolution (Fig. 1C and Additional files, figures 1A
and 2A).

rest of the family has expanded in a time window in agreement with 2R (Additional files, figures 1L and 2L).

G6PC (glucose-6-phospatase beta) (Fig. 1D) is an enzyme
involved in both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis and
has two members on Hsa 17 and one on Hsa 2 [70]. Due
to lack of sequences from Ciona and Branchiostoma floridae, the time window when the expansion of this family
took place is wide. The duplication on Hsa 17 is present
also in the fishes, indicating origin before the divergence
of sarcopterygians and actinopterygians. In addition, the
teleost fishes have a local duplication of one of these
orthologs resulting in three members of this family
located on the same chromosome (Fig. 2). For one of
these genes it seems like the zebrafish has retained both of
the copies formed in 3R (Fig. 1D and Additional files, figures 1C and 2C). Furthermore, the Dre3 gene has undergone a recent duplication in the zebrafish (Fig. 1D),
although this could also be a result of an assembly error
in the database.

OSBPL, Oxysterol-binding proteins are a large family
involved in diverse cellular processes with an oxysterol
binding domain as common feature [66,67] and we have

MPP, is a subfamily of the membrane-associated guanylase kinase homologs superfamily, an old family involved

7 and 17, the tree displays a topology consistent with 3R
(Additional files, figures 1F and 2F).
UPP, uridine phosphorylate is a small family that catalyzes the reversible phosphorylitic cleavage of uridine,
deoxyuridine and thymidine [72]. It consists of only two
human members that seem to have evolved in the same
time frame as the proposed 2R events (Additional files,
figures 1N and 2N).

Discussion
Extending our previous observation that the two NPYfamily genes NPY and PYY are located near the Hox clusters [73], we recently reported that these syntenies exist
also in the pufferfishes Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon
nigroviridis, the medaka Oryzias latipes, the stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus and the zebrafish Danio rerio [74]. Thus,
these syntenies are likely to have existed in the common
ancestor of tetrapods (and other sarcopterygians) and
actinopterygians. These chromosome regions have undergone further duplications in the teleost fish tetraploidization, 3R, resulting in duplicates of both the Hox clusters
and the NPY and PYY genes. Several other gene families
have been suggested to have been duplicated together
with the Hox clusters [7-9,54]. To our knowledge the evolutionary histories of only a few families have been investigated in the Hox paralogon using both sequence
phylogenies and synteny comparisons, for example the
DLX family [58,59], the nuclear receptor family [68] and
the voltage-gated sodium channels [75,76]. In the present

study, we have investigated in detail several additional
gene families that are represented on multiple chromosomes in the Hox paralogon. With the NPY-family genes
as starting points in Takifugu rubripes, Danio rerio and
human, we identified 14 gene families that are present on
two, three, or all four of the human Hox chromosomes.
We have studied the phylogenies of these gene families
initially with the neighbor-joining method and subsequently with quartet puzzling maximum likelihood, and
report here that 13 of the 14 families have members that
seem to have been duplicated in the early stages of vertebrate evolution (see table 1). The remaining family,
G6PC, also has a topology consistent with 2R but due to
lack of urochordate or cephalochordate sequences the
time window is wider when these expansions could have
occurred. The inclusion of human chromosome 3 as part
of this paralogon has been suggested earlier [7,75]. However, it is not clear if paralogs on Hsa3 were ancestrally
linked to genes on Hsa2 (see figure 4 and [7]) or Hsa 7
[76] before the duplication events. The current analysis is
not able to resolve this ambiguity.
Two gene families that have members on all four of the
human Hox chromosomes were identified, namely IGFBP
and NFE2. The NFE2 family sequences are difficult to
align as explained in results and thus the phylogenetic
analysis must be interpreted with caution, suffice to conclude that the tree topology (Fig. 1B) is consistent with a
quadruplication in early vertebrate evolution. From our
analysis it is not possible to deduce if the IGFBP family

had one or two members at the time of divergence of the
common ancestor of actinopterygians and sarcopterygians from the tunicate lineage (Fig. 1A). The local duplication event could have occurred in early vertebrate
evolution, whereupon the gene pair was duplicated as a
unit, most likely concomitantly with Hox (i.e. in 2R). Two
of the IGFBP duplicates seem to have been lost before the
divergence of actinopterygians and sarcopterygians. This
scenario is one plausible explanation of the present situation in the human genome with IGFBP gene pairs on Hsa
2 and 7 and single genes on Hsa 12 and 17 (see Fig. 6).
The most parsimonious explanation for the observed
topology is that loss of genes took place between 1R and
2R. Abbasi et al. [54] interpreted this tree differently, stating that the most parsimonious explanation is two
genome duplications followed by two local duplications
on chromosome 2 and 7 respectively. In our opinion it is
not possible to interpret the tree topology this way. If the
local duplications occurred after the whole genome duplications one would expect a different topology, with the
locally duplicated genes on Hsa7 clustering together and
the ones on Hsa2 clustering together. This is not the case
(see Fig. 1A). Their alternative hypothesis includes three
whole genome duplications and two losses. In order for
this scenario to be compatible with the topology and
localization two translocations must have occurred. This
involves two additional steps and it also suggests that
three whole genome duplications have occurred, but this
is not observed for any of the other families in their study.

Six gene families were found to be represented on three of
the human Hox chromosomes, i.e., DLX, IGF2BP, SLC4A,
SMARCD, OSBPL and RAR. Note that the DLX family
underwent a local duplication before the chromosome
duplications, in analogy with the IGFBP family described
above, as shown by the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1C and
the chromosome maps in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This family has
previously been difficult to resolve using sequence analyses in mammals, but thanks to the many fish sequences it
can be established that DLX1, 4 and 6 form one series of
paralogs and that DLX 2, 3 and 5 form another [58].
Representation on two of the mammalian Hox chromosomes was found for six gene families, namely two of the
three nuclear receptor families THR and NR1D, as well as
AOC, G6PC, MPP, and UPP. The AOC family (Fig. 1C),
for instance, is represented on Hsa7 and Hsa17 with
orthologs located in the corresponding regions in the
mouse genome. A local duplication has occurred in mammals, resulting in AOC2 and AOC3 on Hsa17, with loss of
AOC2 in mouse. There is also a third member located on
chromosome 17 – a pseudogene that was not present in
version 43 of the Ensembl database [77]. A series of duplications has occurred in the mouse genome resulting in
four copies on Mmu6 [78]. In contrast, no additional
duplications have occurred among the fish species, not
even in 3R.

The G6PC family (Fig. 1D) is also represented on two
chromosomes in human (Figs. 2 and 4). The local duplication observed on Hsa17 is present also in the three teleosts studied, showing that it happened before the
sarcopterygian-actinopterygian split (Fig. 2). Interestingly,
the three teleosts have an additional local duplication of
one of these genes, not present in the mammals. In this
case, zebrafish seems to have retained a 3R duplicate of
one of these genes (Dre12a) which has a copy on Dre3.
These gene families show that local duplications occur frequently and thereby complicate delineation of gene family histories that involve both local and chromosome
duplications. To distinguish between locally duplicated
genes and gene duplicates resulting from large-scale
events such as 2R, the use of several species is crucial. It
has recently been suggested that gene families located on
the Hox-bearing chromosomes were not duplicated
together with Hox based on the observed differences in
the topologies [54]. Instead the gene families were proposed to have duplicated in several independent smallscale events and later translocated to the same chromosomes [54]. This suggests independent translocation
events before the divergence of actinopterygians and sarcopterygians. In the light of the results from large-scale
studies describing duplicated regions in the genomes of
extant vertebrates and the reconstruction of ancestral
chromosomes [10,11] it seems unlikely that the observed
pattern arose by many independent duplications followed
by translocations to the same chromosomes. Furthermore, the strict demand for (A, B)(C, D)-topologies as the
only criteria to support 2R is to restrictive due to complications such as unequal evolutionary rates, gene conversion and loss of genes after duplication. Thus, trees not
showing the perfect (A, B)(C, D)-topology are still compatible with large-scale duplication events if the relative
dating of these events agrees with positional information
from several species.
It was expected that several of the gene families would display fewer than four members in mammals, and likewise
fewer than eight members in the teleosts (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5).
As has been described on numerous previous occasions,
gene losses are common after duplications why at least
one member is often missing. Striking examples of gene
loss are seen in the Hox clusters, where the ancestral set of
14 genes should have resulted in 56 genes after the block
quadruplication. However, one of the ancestral Hox genes
(Hox14) has lost all four paralogs in mammals after the
duplications [79-81], and several other Hox genes have
lost 1–3 of the duplicates, resulting in the present number
of 39 Hox genes in mammalian genomes. Furthermore,
both the pufferfishes and zebrafish seem to have lost a
whole Hox cluster, albeit different ones in these two lineages [12]. As shown in Fig. 6, information from families

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/254

with only two members still gives important information
when they are interpreted together to define regions that
have been duplicated. If loss of genes from duplicated
chromosomal segments occurs independently, positional
information from families with two members taken
together still gives valuable information.
In some of the gene families the teleost-specific duplicates
are only represented in one species (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5). This
made it difficult to distinguish lineage-specific duplications from 3R duplications followed by loss of the duplicate in some lineages. We believe the poor representation
of 3R duplicates in our trees is partly a reflection of the
strict criteria we used when editing the alignments of
sequences from incomplete or poorly annotated genome
databases. Because sequences lacking the analyzed
domains were excluded, our dataset probably underestimates the real number of family members in the included
fish species. Some of the genes lacking domains could be
on their way to become pseudogenes, but there could also
be problems in the prediction of coding regions in the fish
genomes, for example due to short introns in Tetraodon
nigroviridis [25]. Even though we started our analysis in
the fish genomes and therefore should not be biased
towards any of the human chromosomes, one of them
stands out as more poorly represented than the other
three with regard to the number of gene families, namely
human chromosome 12. Uneven retention of gene duplicates on different chromosomes resulting from a quadruplication has been observed previously for the paralogon
comprised by the human chromosomes 4, 5, 8 and 10
[82] as well as for chromosomes 1, 6, 9 and 19 [83]. This
could be the result of more extensive rearrangements on
some chromosomes, causing loss of genes for instance by
affecting gene regulatory elements.
In studies of gene duplications the dating of the duplication events is of course an important factor. This can be
done using molecular clocks [84], ideally calibrated
against known speciation events. Dating of duplication
events can also be obtained by using information from
several species, thereby making it possible to relatively
date the origin of genes in relation to speciation events.
The 2R tetraploidizations have been proposed to have
occurred after the split of urochordates and vertebrates
but before the origin of gnathostomes [9]. We used
sequences from the tunicates Ciona intestinalis or Ciona
savignyi or the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae as
outgroup to see if the duplications we investigated took
place in the vertebrate lineage, as the question we wanted
to address was whether the syntenic gene families
expanded in the same time window. So far it has not been
possible to determine unambiguously whether both of
the 2R tetraploidizations took place before the origin of
cyclostomes, or if the second tetraploidization occurred

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:254

on the gnathostome branch after it had separated from
the cyclostomes mainly due to lack of sequence information.
Many types of genetic events complicate efforts to reconstruct the evolutionary history of individual gene families,
not only frequent duplications and losses, but also differences in the rate of change between members in a gene
family or in the same gene over time. Another source of
difficulties that we have experienced, as mentioned above,
is uncertainties in protein alignments due to duplication
of domains in some family members. Because sequencebased phylogenetic analyses and chromosome positions
(syntenies) constitute two quite different types of information, they can be combined to deduce evolutionary
schemes in a more reliable way. The combined use of synteny and phylogenetic information makes it possible to
delineate old and new duplications, identify translocations of genes and also allows investigation of gene families with only two members. Mechanisms like crossingover and gene conversion may still obscure relationships,
but at least the latter is expected to decrease with time as
the family members accumulate differences that reduce
the likelihood of such events. Particularly gene families
with very short sequences, and/or highly conserved or rapidly diverging sequences, can be resolved by considering
chromosomal position, as has been shown for the insulin/relaxin family of peptides [85], the NPY family of peptides as mentioned above [74], and some of the NPYfamily receptors [86] as well as for example the NFE2 family in this study. All of these families were found to have
expanded in the early vertebrate tetraploidizations.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our study shows that the previously wellstudied Hox cluster was certainly not the only gene family
in this chromosomal segment that was quadrupled in
early vertebrate evolution: the duplicated regions extend
quite far in both directions from the Hox clusters and
involve a larger number of gene families that are totally
unrelated to the Hox-gene sequences. Many genes have
been lost in these families after the quadruplication, like
in the Hox clusters, thereby obscuring the duplication
events. Nevertheless, the overall pattern of genes in the
regions flanking the four Hox clusters clearly shows that
the quadruplication encompasses a major chromosomal
segment, probably a complete ancestral chromosome.

Methods
Identification of chromosomal regions
The selection of the 14 gene families used in this study
was based on the location of family members close to the
genes coding for NPY family peptides in fugu, Takifugu
rubripes and zebrafish, Danio rerio. The gene families
included have genes located on at least two of the human

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/254

chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 12 and 17. Chromosome 3 is a nonHox-bearing chromosome but earlier studies have suggested that it is a part of the Hox-paralogon [7,8,75]. The
two gene families IGFBP and SLC4A were included
because they were already known to have copies on several of the chromosomes in the paralogon and were
located near the human NPY-family genes.
Database searches
The protein family predictions in Ensembl database version 43 http://www.ensembl.org/ where used together
with relevant literature and BLAST [87] to identify additional sequences not included in the Ensembl protein
families. All amino acid sequences representing the longest transcripts of every member of the 14 gene families in
Tetraodon nigroviridis, Takifugu rubripes, Danio rerio, Mus
musculus and Homo sapiens were obtained in order to
obtain information of the repertoires in the common
ancestor of actinopterygians and sarcopterygians using
the Ensembl database version 43. This allows for the identification of shared and lineage specific in teleosts and
tetrapods, respectively. For a full set of Ensembl IDs see
Additional file 3.
Alignments and phylogenetic analyses
Protein domains in each sequence were identified by
searches
against
the
Pfam
database
http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/ and aligned using the
Windows version of Clustal × 1.81 [88,89]. Sequences
lacking described domains, or incomplete domains, were
removed from the alignment (for description of which criteria that were used for each family see figure legends in
supplementary file 1 and 2). Alignments were thereafter
manually inspected and edited to remove poorly aligned
sequences. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the
neighbor-joining (NJ) method with standard settings
(Gonnet weight matrix, gap opening penalty 10.0 and gap
extension penalty 0.20) as implemented in the windows
version of Clustal W 1.81 [88] with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap values below 50% were considered nonsupportive. Sequences from Drosophila melanogaster and
Ciona intestinalis (or Ciona savignyi or Branchiostoma floridae) were used as outgroups in the phylogenetic analyses
in order to relatively date duplications. Quartet puzzling
maximum-likelihood trees were constructed using TreePuzzle 5.2 [90] (for Tree-puzzle settings in each analysis,
see supplementary file 2).
Chromosomal maps
Based on the phylogenetic analyses, positional information from gene family members duplicated after the split
of urochordates and the rest of the chordates and before
the split of sarcopterygians and actinopterygians was used
to draw chromosomal maps. This allowed for identifica-
