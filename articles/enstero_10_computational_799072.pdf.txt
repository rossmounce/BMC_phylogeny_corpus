Abstract
Background: Several bioinformatic approaches have previously been used to find novel sites of ADAR mediated
A-to-I RNA editing in human. These studies have discovered thousands of genes that are hyper-edited in their
non-coding intronic regions, especially in alu retrotransposable elements, but very few substrates that are siteselectively edited in coding regions. Known RNA edited substrates suggest, however, that site selective A-to-I
editing is particularly important for normal brain development in mammals.
Results: We have compiled a screen that enables the identification of new sites of site-selective editing, primarily
in coding sequences. To avoid hyper-edited repeat regions, we applied our screen to the alu-free mouse genome.
Focusing on the mouse also facilitated better experimental verification. To identify candidate sites of RNA editing,
we first performed an explorative screen based on RNA structure and genomic sequence conservation. We further
evaluated the results of the explorative screen by determining which transcripts were enriched for A-G mismatches
between the genomic template and the expressed sequence since the editing product, inosine (I), is read as
guanosine (G) by the translational machinery. For expressed sequences, we only considered coding regions to
focus entirely on re-coding events. Lastly, we refined the results from the explorative screen using a novel scoring
scheme based on characteristics for known A-to-I edited sites. The extent of editing in the final candidate genes
was verified using total RNA from mouse brain and 454 sequencing.
Conclusions: Using this method, we identified and confirmed efficient editing at one site in the Gabra3 gene.
Editing was also verified at several other novel sites within candidates predicted to be edited. Five of these sites
are situated in genes coding for the neuron-specific RNA binding proteins HuB and HuD.

Background
The eukaryote cellular machinery has been shown to contain several alternative processing mechanisms acting on
RNA. On the pre-mRNA level, alternative splicing is a
well-known mechanism altering transcripts. This type of
alternative processing is particularly important in the nervous system, where it helps determine the properties of
many types of neurons [1]. Although RNA editing has
received less attention, it is known to fine-tune messenger
RNA composition by changing single nucleotides (nt). The
most common enzymes to perform editing in mammals

are the ADAR (adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA)
proteins. The ADAR enzymes ADAR1 and ADAR2 convert adenosines to inosines (A-to-I) within double stranded
RNA by a hydrolytic deamination (reviewed in [2]). Since
inosine is interpreted as guanosine (G) by the splicing and
translational machineries, ADAR editing effectively results
in an A-to-G change that may alter the amino acid
sequence encoded by the substrate. There are two types of
A-to-I edited sites, (i) hyper-edited sites that are abundant
in non-coding and untranslated regions of long, almost
completely double stranded, stem loop structures [3,4] and
(ii) selectively edited sites that consist of imperfect stem
loop structures, often formed by an exon and a trailing
intron sequence. To date, site selective editing has mainly
been found in genes involved in neurotransmission.

The known substrates for site selective editing typically have a functional significance due to non-synonymous alteration of a codon that alters the amino acid
sequence. Both RNA strands of a substrate stem often
show high conservation of sequence as well as structure
in species from human to chicken [5-7]. Imperfections
in the form of bulges and internal mismatches are
important structural features for site selective editing
[8]. Even though only a handful of substrates have been
identified, editing has proven to be important for the
function of the developing brain in both invertebrates
[9] and vertebrates [10-12].
The method we developed encompasses an initial
explorative screen followed by a refinement of potential
candidate sites using a novel scoring system. Our
explorative screen for selectively edited sites consists of
two components, the initial identification of candidate
sites using RNA structure prediction and the subsequent
evaluation of these sites using evolutionary sequence
conservation. For the first, we developed the program
StemPrediction to predict edited double stranded RNA
stems within genomic transcripts that contain sequence
pairs with approximate reverse complementarity. For
the second, to specifically extract duplexes found in evolutionarily conserved regions, a novel conservation measure was developed and applied that employs multiple
alignments of 17 vertebrate genomes [13]. In the refinement phase, we first used alignments of genomic data
and an expressed sequence database [14] to target candidate sequences enriched for A-G mismatches between
genomic and transcribed sequences. In addition, candidates were evaluated using a novel 6-bit scoring scheme
based on characteristics for known A-to-I edited sites.
Similar ideas have been used previously to construct
computational screens with the same purpose [3,15-17].
The hallmarks of these prior screens have been the A-G
discrepancy and the clustering of adjacent discrepancies.
Less used components involve conservation (usually
mouse/human) and prediction of target RNA foldback
structures. These studies have mainly led to the discovery of thousands of hyper-edited substrates where the
editing events arise from inverted repetitive elements
such as alu sequences. To avoid the detection of extensively edited long stem loop structures created by alu
inverted repeats, we focused on the mouse genome that
is devoid of these repetitive elements.
Our aim is to find single sites of selective editing that
have the potential to re-code the open reading frame
(ORF). To do this we use only coding sequences from
well annotated mouse genes in order to focus on
sequences destined for protein synthesis. Unique to our
screen is also the scoring scheme based on features of
known sites of selective editing. The result of applying
our extended screen to the mouse genome gives a

substantial number of novel putative substrates of
which 45 have been experimentally tested. Of these, 38
derive from our combined explorative screen and
refinement and an additional 7 candidates from the
explorative screen alone. That is, in the latter 7 we
looked for editing events within 7 highly conserved
stem regions without requiring an A-G mismatch when
comparing to the transcript database. Among the 38
candidates found in the combined screen and refinement, we identified the Gabra3 transcript. This gene
that codes for the a3 subunit of the GABAA receptor
has recently been found by us to be edited at one site,
giving rise to an isoleucine to methionine change in
the protein sequence. From sites identified using the
explorative screen alone, we confirmed editing in several candidates, particularly in the neuron-specific RNA
binding Hu-proteins. Our results imply that our
method can be used to accurately identify novel substrates for site selective editing.

Results
Prediction of RNA stem structures within mouse genes

Previous work in our laboratory have included the use
of Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) to
experimentally detect novel sites of A-to-I editing [18].
In this study, we use a novel bioinformatic method to
search the sequences from these 11,827 well annotated
mouse genes for new sites of editing in their open reading frames. An advantage of using the mouse genome
instead of the human genome is the avoidance of Alu
repeat elements known to be highly edited but so far
without a well defined function. The mouse genome
contains inverted repeats within transcribed regions
having the potential of being double stranded RNA
structures targeted for editing. Indeed, repeats are also
edited in mouse with one documented example of editing in a SINE element of the CTN-RNA [19]. However,
editing in the mouse repeats are much more infrequent,
possibly due to the higher divergence of the different
repetitive elements [20]. We first extracted the genome
sequences corresponding to the genes on the above
mentioned microarray from the mouse genome assembly release 8 (Mm8) [21]. BLASTZ [22] was then used
to identify those transcribed sequences containing
nearly exact reverse complementary pairs of subsequences, reasoning that these are likely to form RNA
duplexes (Figure 1). Our BLASTZ search was restricted
to mouse genomic regions that: (i) correspond to one of
the 11,827 mouse genes; and (ii) are alignable with at
least 10 other species in the multiple sequence alignments (MSA) consisting of the mouse genome aligned
to 16 other vertebrates. The total number of sequence
pairs extracted with BLASTZ was 53,729,218, an average of about 5,000 per gene.

Identification of stems as potential substrates
for ADAR enzymes

Both sequence and structure are often phylogenetically
well conserved at sites of selective editing. We used our
novel program StemPrediction (see Methods) to filter
the large sequence collection extracted above with
BLASTZ for pairs of sequences exhibiting characteristics
of known ADAR substrates (Figure 1). A key parameter
was the MAX_ENERGY cut-off corresponding to minimum free energy for the stems. We avoided a strict cutoff, since the free energy for known ADAR substrates
are often moderately low (Figure 2). On the other hand,
an overly liberal cut-off would inevitably result in a vast
amount of noise sequence pairs. Based on these considerations, MAX_ENERGY = -15 kcal/mol was chosen.
When inspecting the results, we found it unlikely that a
looser cut-off would yield any additional interesting

predictions. The energy values for the retrieved stems
ranged between the extremes -15 and -1,382. The
empirical distribution is shown in Figure 3. The total
number of retrieved stems was 2,919,511. Of those,
1,307,598 candidate stems with a maximum length of
5,000 nt were selected for further analyses.
Identifying conserved stem structures

Using the multiple alignment of the mouse genome with
several other genomes, we scored each candidate stem
according to its level of conservation. Based on previously confirmed editing sites, we expected ADAR substrates to be highly conserved in terms of structure, at
least in areas close to the edited site. Typically, it is the
nucleotides in the helical regions of the ADAR substrates whose identity is conserved whereas nucleotides
in non-helical regions are not, although their non-helical
state is maintained. This is evident in a previous

different duplexes: perfect duplexes, known ADAR duplexes, random duplexes, and a random set from our candidate duplexes. We conclude
that the trend is clear in the assumption that we would benefit from not being too strict in assigning parameters to StemPrediction.

Number of sites, gene overlapping sites (annotated gene that include any of the sites), areas (An area with conservation score c is a set of contiguous sites, with
at least one site scoring c or higher, surrounded by 50 consecutive sites all having a score below c), gene overlapping areas (annotated gene overlapping any

phylogenetic analysis that reveals an unusual sequence
conservation within exonic and intronic sequences
involved in RNA editing [5]. This turns out to also be
true for editing substrates that consists of exon
sequence entirely [23]. We therefore required a high
conservation score on both stem arms of the putative
substrates. In order to exclude regions of low conservation we defined the overall conservation score of a stem
to be the score of its lowest scoring stem arm but the
highest scored site on that arm (Table 1).
Using the mouse vs. 16 vertebrates multiple sequence
alignment (MSA), we scored each site/nucleotide
within the predicted stems according to its level of
conservation (see Methods). This MSA attempted to
align regions from the mouse genome to as many of
the other 16 genomes as possible. Each mouse site
included in an alignment containing at least 10 out of
the 17 species was given a positive conservation score
while all other positions were given a conservation
score of zero. The conservation score for these 10aligned consists of two terms, a parsimony term and
the tree term, both computed relative to a window of k
nucleotides upstream and k nucleotides downstream of
s. We found k = 10 to be suitable, i.e., the conservation
score for s depends on the sites in a window of width
21 surrounding s.
The number of sites in the mouse genome that was
given a positive conservation score was 58,192,830,
approximately 2% of the mouse genome, and the values
ranged from just above zero to 110 (Table 2). An area
with conservation score c is a set of contiguous sites,
with at least one site scoring c or higher, surrounded by
50 consecutive sites all having a score below c.
The idea behind using the parsimony term and the tree
term is that the former should capture absolute conservation, i.e., its value will be high for sites in which very few
mutations have occurred, while the latter should capture
conservation in the mouse and human part of the tree
which relates the aligned species (Figure 4). That is, a site
in which several substitutions have occurred in some

small subtree distant from mouse, but where no substitutions has occurred elsewhere, will have a high tree term
value. As an example we used the alignment of a genomic
sequence of the AMPA glutamate receptor, subunit B at
the known R/G editing site (GluR-B R/G) (Figure 5). A
boxed window (in green) of the first 21 nucleotides contains five substitutions altogether. All these have
occurred in one species, resulting in a high tree term for
this window. Further, a section of mouse chromosome 3
overlapping the positions for the editing substrates GluRB Q/R and R/G, respectively, was plotted against the conservation score (Figure 6). From this graph we can conclude that the genome positions for these two substrates
score higher than all other chromosomal positions.
Identifying sites of editing

To identify specific sites of selective A-to-I editing within
the candidates selected by structure and phylogenetic
conservation, a screen was made that discriminate
between an A in genomic sequence and a G at the same
position in EST data for an individual. This is typically

an indication of an A-to-I editing site in the mRNA
sequence. The genomic sequences used in the alignment
were matched to the cDNA sequence, also called genomic
mRNA below. However, the sequences in the databases
correspond to many individuals, so an A-G mismatch
may be caused by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).
Therefore, we used the mouse SNP database to remove
known SNPs of genomic origin from our A-to-G targets.

Page 6 of 15

However, it has previously been shown that over one
hundred SNPs in human are most likely due to A-to-I
editing [24,25]. Therefore, A-to-G SNPs verified by the
sequencing of ESTs were not excluded from the screen.
We used two databases, mouse EST [14] and mouse SNP
[26], to extract the A-G mismatches. A total of 142,136
A-G mismatches were identified and of those 32,948
were rejected due to concurrent hits with a genomic origin in the SNP database. Thus, 109,188 high quality A-G
mismatches were detected. The number of genes containing a certain number of A-G mismatches ranged
between the extremes 0 and 420 according to the distribution in Figure 7. In 10,841 genes at least one A-G mismatch was detected.
For those regions assigned positive conservation
scores, we evaluated our collection of candidate stems
for A-G mismatch enrichment. We partitioned the
spectrum of conservation scores into sections < 50, 5060, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90 and ≥ 90. If conservation score
and A-G mismatches both indeed are ADAR substrate
characteristics, A-G mismatches will be enriched
among candidate stems with high conservation scores.
We evaluated this using a null hypothesis according to
which an A-G mismatch is independent of A-to-I editing. Since we view: i) editing as the only possible
explanation for dependence between A-G mismatch
and conservation and ii) in order to get a computable
p-value, we extend the null hypothesis to include independence between A-G mismatch and conservation.
Absolute numbers and relative frequencies of A-G mismatches for various conservation scores are shown in
Table 1. The frequency of A-G mismatch among stems
with conservation score < 50 and 80-90 are 0.116 and
0.267, respectively (Table 2). The probability of having
such a high discrepancy assuming that an A-G mismatch is a random phenomenon with the same

distribution in both ranges of conservation score is <
10 -85 , this p-value was calculated with Hoeffding’s
bound [27]. We conclude that there is a correlation
between editing and a high conservation score. In both
ranges, some of the A-G mismatches could be attributed to random phenomena independent of editing, and
we assume that the fraction of randomly occurring
A-G mismatches is the same in both ranges. This fraction can be no larger than 0.116, indicating that the
fraction of edited stems in the 80-90 range is at least
0.145, corresponding to 514 stems.
Site ranking based on known substrates
for site selective editing

To narrow down the number of candidates further, we
utilized a site ranking scheme as a filter. We first
imposed a minimum conservation score for a candidate
to be evaluated by the site ranking scheme. Using the
conservation scores for the predicted stems of known
edited sites as a guide (Table 3), We set this cut-off conservation score to ≥ 75. Of the 53,729,218 sequences
with complementary subsequences identified by
BLASTZ, we found 2,524 stems with conservation
scores above this cut-off. To further reduce the number
of potential sites, we applied a site scoring criteria based
on common features among known ADAR substrates.

The known substrates are too few to apply a machine
learning approach or to allow a good understanding of
the relative importance of these criteria. So, our
approach is purely heuristic. We used a bit-scoring
scheme in which a candidate stem could have a maximum score of 6 (Table 4). The first two bits were used
to credit conservation even further. To promote the
conservation we decided to use the conservation score ≥
80 and ≥ 90. The reason for this was that the 2 top
scored known substrates regarding conservation (GluRB: R/G 96 and Q/R 85) also are edited close to 100%.
Assuming the editing frequency to be a quality marker
for the conservation trait, we decided to add 2 bits in
total for highly conserved stems, referred to as cons_80
and cons_90 in Table 4. The third bit specifically scores
whether an A to G mutation is observed in the transcript data. This bit is called the A-G mutation. A stem
has an A-G mutation if (i) it has an A-G mismatch
when comparing genomic and transcribed sequences;
and (ii) mouse and a closely related species have an A
at the A-G mismatch site in the alignment, while species
distant to the mouse have a permanent G at that position as shown for the GluR-B R/G site where Tetraodon
has a genomic G at the R/G site (Figure 5). The fourth
bit was used to reward distinct A-G mismatches in both

the probability of having an A-G mismatch in only one

whether the A-G substitution would result in a change
in the protein sequence, we downloaded all available
mRNA and protein sequences from the Entrez gene site
[28]. If amino acid changes appeared in the consensus
protein sequence due to A-to-G changes it was scored
as annotated_aa_change.
It has previously been shown that there is a sequence
bias in the vicinity of an edited adenosine [29]. Hence,
we used algorithms for calculating information content
[30] to sort out if and how to score a nearest neighbor
distribution of an edited site (see Methods). The information content in this case is related to whether there
is a pattern of nucleotide disposition that differs from
the expected with respect to the background distribution. This means that if there is a background distribution of equal amounts of the four different nucleotides
and we also find a distribution of equal amounts of
nucleotides at a position, we can gain no information at
that position, i.e., 0 bits. The calculations are based on
known selectively edited sites in mammals where the literature reports more than 40% editing. Consequently 24
sequences were used to calculate the information pattern ± 200 nt around an edited position. Expectedly, we
find the highest degree of information just adjacent to
the targeted adenosine. The upstream and downstream
neighbor had 0.43 and 0.50 bits respectively. The downstream preference of a guanosine (0.27 bit) and the
higher total information content motivated us to score
downstream guanosines of a candidate editing site,
(ds_G). We compiled a list of 38 selected candidates
having a site score of ≥ 3 (Table 5). In this list, Gabra3,
appeared with a score of 4. Using other methods this
substrate has subsequently been shown by us to be
highly edited at one site (I/M) in mouse brain [7].

sequencing technology

To validate editing in the 38 candidates, we used the
amplicon 454 sequencing technology. The advantage of

Page 9 of 15

using this technique is that even low levels of editing
can be detected with high accuracy. The collection of
454 sequences retrieved for each of the 38 candidate
genes were aligned to the mouse genome. The number
of sequences aligning to a candidate gene, and thus the
number of alignment rows, ranged from 46 to 1,267.
The 454 output contains a phred score for each position
indicating the risk of erroneous sequencing for the position in question. That is, even though one can give a
general estimate for 454 sequencing errors, the phred
score provides a much better estimate for any given specific position. In most cases the phred score was
reported to be between 20 and 30 corresponding to 1%
and 0.1% risk respectively. Furthermore, all alignments
showing any sign of poor quality were discarded. A total
of 175 positions were found where a genomic A was
replaced by a G in at least one of the sequences. The
Gabra3 transcript was found to be edited 93% of the
time in these analyses (Table 6). Another gene found to
be edited was Elavl2 (also known as mHuB). The alignments corresponding to this site contained 625
sequences out of which 15 (2.4%) showed an A-G replacement at one site (Table 6). This editing event causes
an amino acid change from aspargine to aspartic acid
(N/D). Also another site confirmed to be edited within
this transcript causes an isoleucine to valine (I/V)
change in 1.4% of the transcripts. The mHuB protein is
a neuron-specific RNA binding protein with 3 RNA
recognition motifs (RRMs). Both of the edited sites are
situated in RRM3. In addition, another 8 sites where the
editing frequency was higher than 0.6% were found, 6 of
these leading to amino acid changes (Table 6). Among
these was Elavl4 (also known as HuD), another neuron
specific RNA binding protein.

Discussion
We have described an explorative screen for selectively
A-to-I edited sites, based on two components, RNA
stem structure and conservation of the corresponding
sequence. For the stem structure, we use a free energy
threshold and characteristics of known ADAR substrates
while the conservation score is used to rank stems.
Unlike previous attempt to detect sites of editing we
have focused on modifications within encoded sequence
[3,15-17]. However, in a recent genome wide screen a
fundamentally different approach to detect novel sites of
selective editing was used where repetitive elements
where filtered [31]. In line with our results Li et al.
stress the finding of widespread editing at low levels
(< 2%) and few edited sites that give rise to a change of
the translational code.
An assay was designed for our explorative screen that
tests whether highly conserved stems are enriched for
positions with an A-G mismatch between the genomic

Top edited genes with sites having editing p-value < 0.0001 (combined phred
score for the probability of erroneous sequencing). Coverage indicates the
total number of sequences, #G is edited sequences and #A the number of
non-edited sequences, giving the frequency of editing (Freq. of G) and the
implied amino acid change (aa change).

and the transcribed sequence. The result of the evaluation is that A-G mismatches are significantly enriched
in highly ranked stems. Comparing stems in the 80-90
conservation score range with those in the < 50 range
yields an estimate of 514 edited stems in the former.
Given that true editing events are located in highly conserved stems we consider the frequency of A-G mismatches in the < 50 range to be the background we see
in the other conservation ranges. Consequently a fraction of 0.116 could always be expected to be noise associated with each of the other ranges. Therefore 514 (908
- 0.116 × 3397) stems in the range 80-90 are believed to
be stems wherein true editing occurs. The same type of
comparison between each of the three intervals 70-80,
60-70, and 50-60 and the interval < 50 yields an estimate of 18,074 edited stems in the combined conservation score range 50-80. These values are surprisingly
high given the number of currently known ADAR substrates. However, it is noticeable that the conservation
score range ≥ 90 contains relatively few stems with an
A-G mismatch. We find two possible explanations for
this: (i) several of the known ADAR substrates are in
this range but have been excluded in order to not bias
the calculations with bona-fide substrates, (ii) the editing
efficiency is lower than 50% and not registered as an A
to G change in the database and (iii) known functional
edited sites often have a G in fish and amphibians that

are more distantly related to mammals and this prevents
a very high conservation score. Thus, a conservation
score of a true editing event is often impaired by the
fact that species far from human/mouse often have a
template DNA G at the editing site, which lowers the
conservation score.
We refined our screen by including several additional
components of which A-G mismatch between genomic
and transcribed sequences is one. Our refinement was
applied to mouse orthologs of the known human ADAR
substrates. As seen in Table 3, of the known selectively
edited sites, 4 are contained in a stem structure that:
(i) has an A-G mismatch in mouse as well as human,
(ii) has a free energy below the threshold and (iii) has a
conservation score above 75. By restricting ourselves to
structures with conservation score above 75, we lose
some of the known ADAR substrates but the majority
satisfy this requirement. From the final list, it is worth
noting that the R/G and Q/R sites of GluR-B, and the
I/V site of Kcna1 are among the absolute top ranking
candidates (Table 7). This is a strong indication that our
screen in total has an intrinsic capacity to detect ADAR
targets. Further, we found one novel substrate for site
selective editing to be highly scored. The Gabra3 transcript coding for the a3 subunit of the GABAA receptor
got a score of 4. This transcript was verified to be edited
to 93% using amplicon 454 sequencing on RNA
extracted from the mouse brain (Table 6 and [32]. The
site of editing in Gabra3 gives rise to an amino acid
codon change from isoleucine to methionine (I/M)
within exon 9 [23]. Thus, the high score in the present
computational screen indicates that it is possible to
detect novel sites of selective editing using this method.
Noteworthy is that in previous attempts to find substrates for editing, the Gabra3 transcript was not
detected. The unique feature of our screen compared to
others is that we limit our analysis to encoded sequence
in combination with RNA secondary structure conservation and hallmarks for efficient site selective editing.
Out of the final list, 45 candidates were investigated
further. By using the 454 sequencing method the
sequence of several hundred to a thousand single transcripts can be analyzed and thereby the accuracy in editing efficiency determination is extremely high.
Altogether, we found editing in 175 positions where the

A-G discrepancy could not be explained by either
sequencing or alignment errors. The top 11 sites
(including Gabra3) are listed in Table 6. Noteworthy is
that five of these come from our explorative screen
alone. That is, we detect signs of true editing without
the A-G mismatch requirement and exclusively due to
extreme conservation traits of our predicted stems.
Out of those, three sites are located in the ORF of
neuronal Hu proteins B and D (also known as Elavl,
embryonic lethal abnormal vision (Drosophila)-like).
The Hu family members HuB and HuD (Elavl 2 and 4)
play important roles in neuronal differentiation and
proliferation [33]. They consist of three RNA binding
domains (RRMs) and have been shown to be involved
in RNA processing events that regulate expression of
NF1 (Neurofibromatosis type 1) [34], Ikaros [35] and
CGRP (Calcitonin gene-related peptide) [36] in neuronal cells. Also, plasticity in SNP composition in these
genes have been implied in Parkinson disease [37].
Interestingly, in HuD the T/A editing site (indicating
the amino acid change) is situated in RRM 2, and in
HuB both the I/V and the N/D editing sites are in
RRM 3. Even though only low levels of editing were
detected in HuB and HuD, one should keep in mind
that samples from total brain was used. It is therefore
possible that editing in these genes is higher in certain
regions of the brain and that it is of importance to
achieve a tissue specific regulation of alternative splicing. Moreover, since these are neural specific genes,
increased levels of editing in non-neuronal tissues
might be a way to down regulate these proteins.
Although further analyses are required, our list of substrates with a low level of editing gives a hint of cell
specific gene regulation by RNA editing, With one
recent exception [31], this type of low level editing has
previously not been possible to detect using other
methods.

Conclusions
Using our explorative screen in combination with 454
sequencing, it is possible to find novel sites of editing
within coding sequence at levels that have previously
not been possible. Our findings also point to a risk in
basing an entire screen for A-to-I edited sites on A-G
discrepancies between genomic and cDNA sequences
annotated in the database, since many of the candidates
here found to be edited came from the explorative
screen alone.
Methods
BLASTZ and StemPrediction

We used NCBI gene ID:s to download a complete set of
genbank files for the 11,827 unique genes represented on
the Affymetrix 430A microarray. Genes that could not be
unambiguously mapped to a Genbank entry were discarded. We used BLAT [38] to align the head and tail
sequences (100 nt of the 5’ and 3’-end of a gene, respectively) to the corresponding chromosome. All sequences
that could not be completely and uniquely aligned to
their corresponding chromosome (NCBI build 36) were
also discarded. BLAT was used with default parameters
with the exception of MIN_IDENTITY. MIN_IDENTITY
= 100 was chosen since we wanted to eliminate incomplete alignments. To determine potential stem loop forming structures, first BLASTZ [22] was used to align each
sequence to the reverse complement of itself, using parameter settings as shown in Table 8. We constructed a
custom weight matrix for these alignments that reflects
the contribution of each base pairing to the stability of
the structure including the non-standard G-U pairing
(G-T in DNA sequence) (Table 9). Resulting alignments
were further filtered using our StemPrediction software.
StemPrediction first determines the lowest energy confirmation of a stem loop structure formed by the BLASTZ
aligned sequences using RNAfold [39]. Parameter

settings, see Table 8, allow potential stem loops to be
further filtered based on characteristics of the predicted
structure such as the RNAfold determined minimum free
energy, the length of the stem, and the number of paired
and unpaired nucleotides (bulges) in the stem. Stems
from disjoint structures can be joined to create larger
structures if stems sequences are within a specified distance of each other. These characteristics of stem loop
structures have been previously shown to be important
in RNA editing [40-42].
A-G mismatch idenitification

The most recent set of 11,827 well annotated gene
sequences, including UTR’s, and exon coordinate annotations for all transcript isoforms, were downloaded [43].
The coordinates gave a complete set of genomic coding
sequences. We used two databases as of February 2007, a
mouse EST database [14] and an SNP database, build 126
[26]. The genomic mRNA sequences were aligned to the
EST database using BLASTN [44] in order to deduce A-G
mismatches between the template DNA and the expressed
sequences. To reduce the risk of promoting an A-G mismatch originating from sequencing errors and/or low
quality alignments, we discarded alignments shorter than
100 nt and alignments containing ≥ 20 mismatches. We
further used the SNP database to remove A-G mismatches
likely to have a polymorphic genomic origin.
Mouse genome sequence conservation labeling

The Mm8 version of the mouse assembly was used.
Each genomic site included in cross-species alignments
that contained at least 10 of the 17 species was scored
according to:
cons.score window = pars.term window + tree.term window .

The parsimony term for column s is calculated as the
negative logarithm of the p-value for the parsimony score
in the window centered at s. The details of how the pvalue is computed are found in [13] where this algorithm
is entitled parsimony-based method for MCS detection.
The calculation is done with respect to the structure of
the species tree (Figure 4), the tree’s edge lengths, and a
substitution rate matrix (we follow [13] and use the HKY
neutral substitution rate matrix [45]). When calculating
the tree term we consider all columns in the window
simultaneously and we observe where in the tree nucleotides deviating from the consensus are found:

m

tree.score window =

⎧ # rooted subtrees ⎫
⎬⋅
⎭
m′=1

∑ ⎨ with m′ leaves
⎩

21

∏
i =1

n = total #leaves
m = # leaves in subtree with mutations
di = number of mutations in column i
k = total number of columns
This value will be large if all deviating nucleotides are
isolated to some small subtree (c.f. the GluR-B example
shown in Figure 5 where in the boxed window all deviations are found in Tetraodon). In this case the parsimony term will be lowered by the five columns having a
substitution but the tree term will be rather high since
they are all in the same one-species subtree.
Site scoring scheme

A scoring scheme containing bits cons_80, cons_90, AG_mutation, A-G_both, annotated_aa_change and ds_G
were used. The values of bits cons_80, and cons_90 was
retrieved directly from the mouse genome conservation
labeling output. The A-G_mutation, and A-G_both was
similarly retrieved directly from the A-G mismatches
output correlated with the mouse genome conservation
labeling and StemPrediction respectively. In scoring
annotated_AA_change, we aligned amino acid sequences
for a gene with the translated genomic mRNA using
DIALIGN [46]. The amino acid sequences were
retrieved from NCBI Entrez gene [28], either protein
sequences from the Entrez protein or translated
sequences from Entrez nucleotide. If a position annotated as an A-G mismatch also showed a corresponding
amino acid discrepancy, this site was scored (bit annotated_aa_change). To compile sequence biases around an
edited site (i.e. bit ds_G) we calculated the information
content ± 200 nt from a selected set of 24 edited adenosines from the known substrates.
T

H(l) = −

∑ f (n, l) ⋅ log ( f (n, l))
2

n= A

Where H(l) is the uncertainty (entropy) [47] at position l, n is the 4 nt to be summed over, and f(n, l) is the
frequency of nucleotide n at l. The total information at
position l is: I(l) = 2 - H(l). From the information calculation we decided to bit score a downstream G.
454 amplicon sequencing

RNA was isolated from mouse brains using TRIzol (Invitrogen). For the first-strand cDNA synthesis random primers was used. PCR was carried out with primers specific
for known edited regions. Fused to the primers were adaptor oligonucleotides specific for the following sequencing

Ensterö et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:6

procedure. Superscript III RT (Invitrogen) was used in all
reverse transcription reaction, and FastStart High Fidelity
PCR System (Roche) was used in all PCR reactions. To
exclude that the samples were contaminated with genomic
DNA, reactions in absense of RT enzyme were also carried
out. Amplified PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose
gel and the bands were cut out and gel purified. All amplified PCR products were pooled. In the 454 procedure, the
PCR products were immobilised on DNA capture beads.
The bead DNA was emulsified in a water-in-oil mix that
contains reagents for amplification. Hence, one bead corresponds to one fragment or transcript. The amplified fragments were loaded onto a PicoTiterPlate™- one bead/well =
one read. The plate was then subjected to sequencing
reagents using the pyro-sequencing technique (Roche).
In Table 6 we collect the top candidates where the risk
of erroneous sequencing is less than 0.0001. This probability is calculated using the phred scores. A phred score
of 25 indicates the probability of a sequencing error is
10-2.5. Since we manually discarded A-G discrepancies
due to poor alignments, we assume that the probability
of falsely assigning an A-G mismatch as a true editing
event to be solely dependent on the phred score (sequencing error). In 40 out of 175 cases, the p-value was found
to be < 0.0001. In addition to Gabra3, the 10 sites showing highest editing frequency are listed in Table 6.
