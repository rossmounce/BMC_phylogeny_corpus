Evolutionary dynamics of U12-type spliceosomal
introns
Chiao-Feng Lin1,2, Stephen M Mount3,4, Artur Jarmołowski5, Wojciech Makałowski1*

Abstract
Background: Many multicellular eukaryotes have two types of spliceosomes for the removal of introns from
messenger RNA precursors. The major (U2) spliceosome processes the vast majority of introns, referred to as U2type introns, while the minor (U12) spliceosome removes a small fraction (less than 0.5%) of introns, referred to as
U12-type introns. U12-type introns have distinct sequence elements and usually occur together in genes with U2type introns. A phylogenetic distribution of U12-type introns shows that the minor splicing pathway appeared very
early in eukaryotic evolution and has been lost repeatedly.
Results: We have investigated the evolution of U12-type introns among eighteen metazoan genomes by analyzing
orthologous U12-type intron clusters. Examination of gain, loss, and type switching shows that intron type is
remarkably conserved among vertebrates. Among 180 intron clusters, only eight show intron loss in any vertebrate
species and only five show conversion between the U12 and the U2-type. Although there are only nineteen U12type introns in Drosophila melanogaster, we found one case of U2 to U12-type conversion, apparently mediated by
the activation of cryptic U12 splice sites early in the dipteran lineage. Overall, loss of U12-type introns is more
common than conversion to U2-type and the U12 to U2 conversion occurs more frequently among introns of the
GT-AG subtype than among introns of the AT-AC subtype. We also found support for natural U12-type introns with
non-canonical terminal dinucleotides (CT-AC, GG-AG, and GA-AG) that have not been previously reported.
Conclusions: Although complete loss of the U12-type spliceosome has occurred repeatedly, U12 introns are
extremely stable in some taxa, including eutheria. Loss of U12 introns or the genes containing them is more
common than conversion to the U2-type. The degeneracy of U12-type terminal dinucleotides among natural U12type introns is higher than previously thought.

Background
In most eukaryotic protein-coding genes, the sequences
found in mature messenger RNAs (exons) are discontinuous, and are separated by intervening sequences
known as introns. The removal of introns, in a process
known as pre-mRNA splicing, is performed by the spliceosome, which consists of the U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6
snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins), and more
than 200 non-snRNP proteins [1-3].
The terminal dinucleotides GT and AG at the 5’ and
3’ end of introns, respectively, are nearly universal [4-6].
However, compilation of introns with non-consensus
splice sites [7,8] led to the discovery of a minute class of
introns. These introns contained an extended and nearly
invariant 5’ splice site (ATATCCTT at +1 to +8

positions starting from the 5’ junction), a more pronounced Branch Point Site (BPS, TCCTTAAC), and an
AC acceptor site. Possible base-pairing between the 5’
splice site and U11 snRNA, and between the BPS and
U12 snRNA, prompted Hall and Padgett [8] to propose
that the low-abundance U11 and U12 snRNAs are
involved in the splicing of this new class of introns. Biochemical analysis of the splicing of one such intron
[9,10] led to the discovery of a distinct spliceosome containing U11, U12, U5 and two new snRNAs (U4atac and
U6atac). Later, a set of novel proteins specific to the
minor class of snRNPs, but generally homologous to
proteins in the major class of snRNPs, was described
[11].
Introns in the minor class were originally called ATAC introns for their unusual terminal dinucleotides.
However, Dietrich et al. [12] demonstrated that an AT-

AC intron with double mutations at the first and last
nucleotides, which turned the termini to GT-AG, could
be properly removed by a minor-type spliceosome. On
the other hand, the splicing of intron 21 of the human
SCN4A gene, which has AT-AC termini, requires a
major-type spliceosome [12]. Since terminal dinucleotides do not necessarily indicate the splicing pathway
that an intron undergoes, Dietrich et al. [12] coined the
terms “U12-dependent” and “U2-dependent” to denote
the introns and spliceosome involved in the minor and
major splicing pathway, respectively. This nomenclature
has been widely accepted and frequently a shorter version, “U12-type” and “U2-type”, has been used.
In the first study that investigated the evolution of
U12-type introns, Burge et al. [13] proposed that U12type introns can be “converted” into U2-type introns.
They described eight sets of U12-type introns having
U2-type orthologs (introns occurring at an orthologous
codon position and the same intron phase) as the outcome of U12-U2 conversion. Given that U12-type splicing signals are more conserved, they noted that
conversion from a U12- to U2-type is more likely than
conversion from a U2- to a U12-type. They also found
orthologous U12-type introns that differ in subtype
(GT-AG vs. AT-AC terminal dinucleotides), and
referred to the change as a “subtype switch.” Subtype
switches provide a possible evolutionary mechanism for
type switches, since as little as one additional mutation
(C to G at +5 position of the 5’ splice site) can convert
a GT-AG U12-type intron into a GT-AG U2-type. This
also suggests that a subtype switch from AT-AC to GTAG can serve as an intermediate stage for a type conversion from U12 to U2.
The wide spread of the U12-type spliceosome in
eukaryotes and its independent loss in distantly related
species was recently studied by computational scanning
for spliceosomal snRNA genes in 149 eukaryotic genomes [14]. The presence of U12-type introns and
snRNAs in both plants and animals suggests that the
U12-type splicing pathway existed in the common
ancestor, and has been lost in some genomes, e.g. C. elegans and yeast. The question whether these two seemingly parallel splicing machineries descended from the
same ancestor is intriguing but remains unsolved. Burge
et al. [13] proposed the fission-fusion hypothesis; two
splicing pathways diverged from one in the course of
speciation (fission) and later merged (fusion) in one
organism. They reasoned that the similar secondary
structure and interaction between the two sets of spliceosomal snRNAs are unlikely to be the result of convergent evolution. However, Lynch and Richardson
argued that the two splicing systems originated from
two group II self-splicing introns, and that the proteins
involved in splicing shaped the similarity between

Page 2 of 11

functionally analogous snRNAs [15]. In this model,
homologous proteins in the two spliceosomes can be
explained by the duplication and specialization of genes
for proteins that were originally shared. Recently, Basu
at al. analyzed protosplice sites in the human and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes and concluded that U2-type
introns predate the U12-type [16]. This finding supports
Lynch and Richardson’s model, suggesting that U2-type
introns first populated genomes to a certain intron density and the successive invasion of the ancestral genome
by U12-type introns was restricted in scale because of
limited space available for the insertion of new genes.
Since the publication of Burge and colleagues’ evolutionary study of U12-type introns, many complete genomes have become available. U12-type introns have
been computationally identified and characterized in
several genomes, including Homo sapiens [17] and Arabidopsis thaliana [18]. Here we present an investigation
to evaluate the relative contribution of various mechanisms, such as intron gain and loss and U12-U2 conversion, to the evolution of U12-type introns. Two
databases provide access to U12-type introns that have
been identified in multiple genomes: SpliceRack [19]
and U12DB [20]. More U12-type introns, particularly
those with AT-AC termini, were reported in U12DB
because the database incorporated introns predicted by
mapping EST data in addition to genomewide annotation. Furthermore, U12DB has a broader range of genomes (twenty eukaryotes), and incorporates orthology
information (based on Ensembl and Inparanoid databases) among introns by organizing U12-type introns
and their orthologous introns into intron clusters. Such
a dataset is ideal for studying the evolution of U12-type
introns. We retrieved the whole U12DB database and
carried out manual inspection to assess the frequency of
type switching, U12 intron loss and gain in sets of genomes. These are: 1) eutheria (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis familiaris), 2) vertebrates
(with addition of Monodelphis domestica, Gallus gallus,
Fugu rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Danio rerio), 3)
chordates (with addition of Ciona intestinalis), 4) Homo
sapiens vs. Drosophila melanogaster), and 5) Homo
sapiens vs. Arabidopsis thaliana.
Our results reveal that U12-type introns are remarkably conserved among vertebrates. On the other hand,
there has been a massive loss of U12-type introns in
multiple invertebrate lineages, suggesting that the rate
of U12-type intron loss varies significantly among taxa.
Interestingly, one of only nineteen U12-type introns that
were detected in the D. melanogaster genome appeared
to be the first known case of U2 to U12-type conversion. In general, loss of U12-type introns is more common than their conversion to U2-type and U12 to U2
conversion occurs more frequently among U12 introns

of the GT-AG subtype. We also found support for natural U12-type introns with non-canonical terminal dinucleotides (CT-AC, GG-AG, and GA-AG) that have not
been previously reported.

Results and Discussion
To study the evolution of U12-type introns, we investigated conservation and changes of the intron state
among U12-type introns and their orthologs in twenty
sequenced eukaryotic genomes: Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis familiaris, Bos taurus, Monodelphis
domestica, Gallus gallus, Xenopus laevis, Fugu rubripes,
Tetraodon nigroviridis, Danio rerio, Ciona intestinalis,
Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana.
We utilized orthologous U12-type intron clusters and
related data available in the U12DB [20]. Members of an
orthologous intron cluster are introns in orthologous
genes that are flanked by alignable exonic sequences.
The status of each intron in each species was designated
in the U12DB as U12, U2, ambiguous, or lost. Changes
in intron state between orthologous introns were noted
and manually curated.
Pairwise comparisons to the human genome (prior to
the detailed investigation described below) as a reference
provide an overview of the entire dataset (see Table 1).
Humans were used as the reference species because the
greatest number of U12-type introns has been identified
in the human genome. In Table 1, the first column
shows the number of U12-type introns that were
included in the analysis from each genome. Not surprisingly, both the number of intron pairs compared and
the number of U12-type introns conserved between the
human and the compared genomes decrease with the
phylogenetic distance. Consequently, U12-type introns
are conserved in at least 90% of the cases between the
human and non-human vertebrate genomes and in
about 20% of the comparisons in invertebrates. The
absence of an orthologous intron is much more frequent
than U12 to U2 intron transition. This initial summary
also shows that the number of U12-type introns identified in each genome varies in a manner that is best
explained by the quality of genome assembly and the
abundance of mRNA and EST data. For instance, the
number of U12-type introns detected in the human genome is unmatched by that of other primates or mammals. The number of compared and conserved intron
pairs in the human-mouse comparison is higher than in
the human-chimp or human-macaque comparisons, an
observation that is best accounted for by the fact that
the mouse genome is better studied than the chimpanzee or macaque genomes. Finally, the number of intron
clusters is clearly undercounted in the case of the two

most phylogenetically distant genomes: Drosophila (see
below) and Arabidopsis [21].
In addition to possible inaccuracy in genome assembly
or annotation, the way U12DB was constructed also
poses the following limitations for the present study. 1)
The number of reported U12-type introns for non-reference genomes may be underestimated, since these genomes have not been fully searched. 2) Identification of
the orthologous intron relies on correct assignment of
orthologous genes since only sequences of the members
of the same ortholog group were searched for flanking
exonic sequences. Errors in orthologous gene identification can lead to overestimate of gain and loss of introns.
This is particularly a challenge for genomes that have
less than ideal genome assembly (such as Ciona), or
phylogenetically distant species (such as Arabidopsis). 3)
Ancient paralogs resulting from gene duplication before
speciation are not distinguished from recent paralogs.
We addressed some of these issues by 1) comparing
genomes at various levels, starting with more closely
related species and gradually adding more distantly
related lineages; 2) inferring evolutionary events (intron
gain, loss, and type switching) from intron clusters where
all orthologous genes of compared species are present; 3)
manually curating when necessary and manageable. This
includes identifying homologous genes by BLAST search
(tblastn), tree construction of homologous protein
sequences, inspection of pairwise protein sequence alignments, and annotation of intron splice sites.
Although a U12 intron that was not present in any of
the four reference genomes could be missed (and therefore not listed in any of the full set of 20 genomes), we
note that the human genome, which is a U12DB reference, is also the most complete. It is unlikely that the
human genome has lost more than one or two introns
present in other vertebrates, because the rate of intron
loss in vertebrates is low overall (see below). Furthermore, we note that almost all of the U12 introns that
have been retained in fruit flies are also retained in
humans and the others are missing from all chordates
(see below). Thus, we feel that use of the human genome as a reference allows an accurate description of all
U12 introns in vertebrates, with only a few exceptions.
The one possibility we cannot rule out is high rates of
U12 intron gain in some non-human vertebrate clade,
but we consider this unlikely because we have observed
only a single case of U12 intron gain in any species. The
situation in insects is quite different. Although the Drosophila melanogaster genome is exceptionally complete
and well-annotated, it has undergone extensive loss of
U12 introns relative to other insects (see below). A thorough analysis of U12 intron evolution in insects using
different methods is in progress, but not as part of the
present study (Janis et al., manuscript in preparation).

Results shown were automatically inferred based on information in the U12db [18]. For some species manual adjustment resulted in a different final count of
U12 introns.

Evolution of U12-type introns in eukaryotic taxa
Four eutherian genomes comparison: only one intron loss

We analyzed four eutherian genomes that are of relatively good quality to gain insight into the evolution of
U12-type introns through closely related species and to
reduce the effect of poor data quality. According to the
initial automated results, there are 442 intron clusters
where the human, mouse, rat, and dog orthologous
genes are all present and at least one of member intron
has a “U12” status (Additional file 1, Table S1). In 407
of these 442 clusters, introns of all four species have a
“U12” state. Of the remaining thirty-five clusters, seventeen have a “U12” and an “absent”, seventeen have a
“U12” and an “ambiguous”, and a single cluster (Syt16)
contains one “U12”, one “U2”, and two “ambiguous”
introns. After manual inspection of the seventeen intron
clusters having putative U12-type intron losses ("U12”
to “absent”), only one case appears to be a true intron
loss by deletion, in the gene encoding the mouse elongation factor 1 (Elof1). The other “absent” cases
(twenty-four introns in seventeen clusters) are artefacts.
Interestingly, in fourteen cases non-orthologs were compared. In the other three cases, non-cognate transcripts
were compared, or genes that are present were not
annotated, or were partially annotated, in the comparison genome. Thus, a case-by-case analysis reveals only
two cases in which a U12 intron changes state, one loss

(the second intron of the Elof gene in mouse) and one
switch to the U2 type (the second intron of the rat
Syt16 gene).
Eight vertebrate genomes comparison: eight losses and five
type conversions in fish

We then added Monodelphis domestica, Gallus gallus,
Danio rerio, Fugu rubripens, and Tetraodon nigroviridis
to the four eutherians to compare U12-type introns
within vertebrates. In this analysis, the two puffer fish
(Fugu rubripens and Tetraodon nigroviridis) were represented as a puffer lineage. As more species were added
to the analysis, the number of shared genes decreased.
There are 180 orthologous intron clusters where orthologous genes for all vertebrates are available and there is
at least one “U12” intron present in a cluster. This is
considerably less than the 442 clusters in the eutherian
analysis. U12-type introns are conserved in all eight
lineages for 156 of the 180 intron cases. This number
(156) reflects an increase from 144 after manual inspection. As in the eutherian comparison, several apparent
cases of change were found to be due to ambiguous
orthology or incompleteness in the genome assemblies
and/or gene annotation. Furthermore, 11 of the remaining 24 cases are ambiguous, and may also represent U12
introns without change. We were able to confirm intron
losses in eight clusters and U12-U2 changes in five
cases. Intron state compositions of these 180 intron

clusters are listed in Additional file 1, Tables S2 and S3
and depicted in Figure 1B.
Comparison of the human and Ciona intestinalis
reveals only 77 gene clusters available for analysis. The
Ciona intron states in these seventy-seven clusters are
twenty-five “U12”, one “ambiguous”, seventeen “U2”,
and thirty-four “absent”. This low conservation is likely
to be exaggerated by an under-detection of tunicate
U12-type introns. As mentioned earlier, the relatively
poor quality of the draft genome assembly [22] and less
abundant EST and/or cDNA data prevent some genes
from being annotated and U12-introns from being
detected. This statement is supported by the fact that
198 pairs could be compared between human and fruitfly genomes and only 154 between human and Ciona
genomes. Nonetheless, the low number of genes compared and the high proportion of absent cases agree
with the findings that the Ciona genome has undergone
excessive loss of ancestral genes [23] and introns [24]
that were present in the common ancestor of vertebrates
and Ciona.
Comparison between Homo sapiens and Drosophila
melanogaster

As shown in Table 1, sixteen fruitfly U12-type introns
are catalogued in the U12DB. We manually examined
two that have been reported earlier [25] but are missing
in the U12DB and those whose hosting gene is not clustered with human genes in ensemble ortholog prediction. The protein alignment between the fruitfly

sequence and the human sequence with the highest
BLASTP score was used to compare intron position.
Table 2 lists the adjusted status of the nineteen D. melanogaster U12-type introns. We were able to identify
orthologous U12-type introns in the human genome for
sixteen of the nineteen introns. The remaining three
cases are an intron loss in early vertebrates (SF3A1; see
Additional File 1, example 1), a case of replacement of
an intron-containing gene by an intron-less gene via retroposition (CCDC16; see Additional file 1, example 2)
and a single U2 to U12 ("twintron”) conversion
(CG3294/URP) (Additional file 1, example 3). In summary, for the 198 human genes with U12-type introns
and detectable fruitfly orthologs, in the latter genome
160 introns were missing, a U2 intron in orthologous
position was noted in eighteen cases, there were four
ambiguous cases, and in sixteen cases U12 introns were
maintained.
Fifteen orthologous mammalian introns have the same
terminal dinucleotides as their fruitfly orthologs, the
only exception is the one with GC-AG in Drosophila
(which is GT-AG in mammals). Fish orthologs have an
additional subtype switch from AT-AC to GT-AG in
the Syntaxin-6 gene. We also examined orthologs of D.
melanogaster U12-type introns in twelve drosophila and
one mosquito genome whenever data was available.
Interestingly, we found a case of two independent
switches from a U12-type to a U2 intron in the
ZDHHC8 gene. This intron is of the U12-type in

Depending on the terminal dinucleotides, or termini, U12-type introns are divided into two major subtypes. Of the nineteen fruit fly U12-type introns, ten are GTAG subtype, including one GC-AG and eight AT-AC. Sixteen have U12-type ortholog in humans. These sixteen human orthologous U12-type introns are of the
same subtype as their fruitfly ortholog. The absence of the U12-type intron in the human SF3A1 gene is likely an intron deletion after insects diverged. The
CCDC16 gene is intronless in mammals and fish but not in chickens and frogs. Thus, the absence of the U12-type intron in the human CCDC16 gene is
presumably due to a retroposition of the gene that occurred in early mammals. The third intron of the fruit fly CG3294 (URP) gene has two pairs of splice sites
that form two alternative spliced introns, one of the U12-type and one of the U2-type. The pair of U12-type splice sites is absent in non-diptera species.

vertebrates and most dipterian species, but of the U2type in D. ananassae and Anopheles gambiae.
Comparison between Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis
thaliana

Even though more than 200 U12-type introns were
identified in A. thaliana, only two of them are reported
by U12DB to have orthologous U12 introns in humans.
These two introns are in genes encoding exosome component 5 (EXOSC5) and BRCA1/BRCA2-containing
complex, subunit 3 (BRCC3). Most Arabidopsis U12
introns are in genes that are reported to lack human
orthologs. Twenty-five A. thaliana U12-type introns are
in genes with human orthologs but no orthologous
intron, and another twenty-eight have orthologous genes
(but not introns) in non-human animals. If these numbers are correct, the number of A. thaliana U12-containing genes that have human orthologous genes is
underrepresented compared to the number of A. thaliana genes that have human orthologous genes (p-value
7e-17 by the hypergeometric distribution test, based on
clustering data from InParanoid, a database of Eukaryotic Orthologs [26]). However, a recent analysis by Basu
et al. [21] reported twenty U12-type introns shared
between humans and Arabidopsis. This is therefore

likely to be a more extreme case of what was observed
for Drosophila, i.e. the U12DB fails to track orthologs
over greater evolutionary distances.
Summary of comparisons within various clades

The above analyses on various subsets of genomes were
based on relatively conservative datasets; intron clusters
were not considered for those genes where orthologous
gene information is missing for any of the species compared. In summary, introns are classified as U12-type in
all four eutheria for 423 (95.7%) of the 442 clusters
(unique intron positions) where four eutherian orthologous genes are present. Seventeen clusters contain
ambiguous introns, indicating potential conversion, but
as many as 440 of the 442 clusters may be U12-type in
all genomes considered. There is only one unambiguous
case of U12 intron deletion (Elof1 in the mouse genome) and one potential U12-U2 transition (synaptotagmin XIV in rats). Among the eight vertebrates, in 156
(86.7%) of the 180 clusters, U12-type introns are conserved in all eight lineages. There are intron losses in
eight clusters and U12-U2 conversion in five clusters.
Eleven clusters contain ambiguous introns. No gain of a
U12-intron was observed. These results indicate that
U12-type introns have been tremendously stable in

Lin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/47

vertebrates during the last 550 million years after the
divergence of Ciona. There were only a few losses or
U12-U2 conversions. Conservation between Ciona and
vertebrates is certainly underestimated mainly due to
the relatively poor quality of the Ciona genome draft,
which leads to under detection of U12-type introns and
difficulties in ortholog prediction. The conservation of
U12-type introns between humans and fruitflies is very
low (7.5% of 200 introns) since there are only nineteen
U12-type introns in D. melanogaster. Fifteen of these
have orthologs in humans; one is specific to diptera, and
two are lost in humans (mammals).
Massive loss of U12-type introns in invertebrates

Depending on availability of data and phylogenetic distance between examined genomes, the number of analyzed intron clusters varied from 77 to 442, which
account for at most two thirds of the near 700 metazoan
U12-intron clusters (unique intron positions) in the
U12DB. Since only fourty-seven intron clusters contain
non-chordate U12-type introns, obviously, the modernday U12-type introns identified in extant animals are
mostly limited to vertebrates. To learn how these orthologous vertebrate U12-type introns (those that are present in the human and at least one non-primate
genomes) relate to other lineages, we investigated their
conservation pattern from a broader and more inclusive
perspective.
We were able to find invertebrate orthologous genes
for 267 vertebrate genes that contain a U12 intron. In
194 cases the orthologous intron was missing from the
invertebrate gene. Although the data does not provide
direct evidence whether these are intron gains in vertebrates or losses in non-chordates, the following observations suggest that U12-type intron loss is more frequent
than U12-type intron gain. First, our four eutherian and
eight vertebrate analyses did not uncover a single case
of U12-type intron insertion. Second, as mentioned
above, the minor-type splicing system independently
went extinct in some organisms via intron deletion and/
or conversion to U2-type, indicating that the loss rate of
U12-type introns is greater than gain rate and that the
entire system has been lost repeatedly [14]. Third, by
studying thirty gene loci from the marine annelid (Platynereis dumerilii), C. elegans, insects, ciona, and humans,
Raible et al. [24] reported that genes in Urbilateria, the
common ancestor of worms, insects, tunicates, and
humans, are “vertebrate-type” i.e. intron-rich and that
the disparity in intron abundance between invertebrates
and vertebrates is mainly due to an intron loss in invertebrates. Fourth, with apparent lower intron abundance
and density than other higher eukaryotes, the D. melanogaster genome appears to have undergone extensive
intron loss [24,27-29]. A study using a maximum likelihood approach infers that the ratio of intron loss rate

Page 7 of 11

over gain rate (for all introns) is 1.25/0.01 = ~125 in D.
melanogaster, 1.04/0.02 = ~50 in C. elegans, 0.77/0.04 =
~20 in Ciona, and 0.35/0.21 = ~2 in humans [29].
These ratios are likely to be greater for U12-type
introns, assuming the same intron gain mechanism for
both types of introns. The loss rate of U2-type introns
in various species agrees with the prediction from a
population genetics perspective. Lynch and Richardson
[15] argued that harbouring introns imposes deleterious
effects because errors in splicing can lead to a failure in
producing functional proteins. The larger the effective
population size of a species, the more effectively selection will remove introns. This explains the intron-rich
vertebrates and intron-poor invertebrates and microbes.
The loss rate may be even higher for U12-type introns
because hosting U12-type introns can be more deleterious than hosting U2-type introns. The primary argument for this is that the requirement for an extended
recognition motif makes U12-type introns more susceptible to mutations. Other factors that have been proposed to have a negative impact include the slower
processing of U12-type introns [30] and higher splicing
error rates [17,31]. Therefore, selection against U12-type
introns may be greater than selection against U2-type
introns. The disparity in the number of U12- and U2type introns may be greater in species with large populations than ones with small populations. Thus, U12type introns have been steadily lost in nematodes and
insects, species with historically large population sizes,
but maintained among vertebrates, which have historically smaller population sizes.
Nearly half of vertebrate genes with U12-type introns are
vertebrate-specific

Of the 549 clusters with a U12-type intron present in
humans and at least one non-primate vertebrate, invertebrate orthologous genes are absent in 254 of them.
Thus, not only are the majority of U12-type introns
found in metazoans present in vertebrates but also the
genes that harbour them are often vertebrate-specific.
While some of the 254 cases of vertebrate-specific genes
might be due to extensive gene losses in invertebrates
[23,32], others may have resulted from the large scale
segmental duplication or whole genome duplication
(WGD) event(s) that have been proposed to take place
in early vertebrate evolution [33,34]. The two gene
families that encode the alpha subunit of voltage-gated
sodium and calcium channels, SCN and CACN1,
respectively, illustrate this.
Mammals have eleven sodium and ten calcium channel alpha subunit genes while fruitflies have two and
three, respectively [35-37]. Most mammalian SCN and
CACN1 genes have two U12-type introns [12,38,39],
however fruitflies preserved only one U12-type intron in
one of the calcium channel gene. Human and mouse

Lin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/47

SCN genes are located in four chromosomal regions
that, interestingly, also harbour HOX genes. This suggests that the large-scale segmental duplications and
subsequent tandem gene duplications led to the expansion of SCN genes in mammals [37].
Metazoan U12-type introns are more often lost than
converted to U2-type introns

A unique aspect of the evolution of U12-type introns is
the conversion from a U12- to a U2-type which was
first proposed by Burge et al. [13]. Both intron deletion
and U12 to U2 conversion reduce the abundance of
U12-type introns in a genome. Thus, an interesting
question is how these two mechanisms contribute to the
loss, or even the extinction, of U12-type introns in
invertebrates. Assuming that intron type conversion is
unidirectional and U12 intron gain is negligible [13],
invertebrate U2-type introns orthologous to vertebrate
U12-type introns represent U12 to U2 conversions.
When we look at orthologous positions of human U12
introns in different species some trends are apparent.
The ratios of absence vs. U2-type introns in these positions are 2:1, 9:1, and 5:1 for tunicates, fruitflies, and
nematodes, respectively (see Table 1). This suggests that
deletion contributes more than U12-U2 conversion to
the evolution of U12-type introns in metazoa, although
the numbers of cases observed do not directly reflect
the rates of the two processes, e.g. some U12-turnedU2-type introns might have been lost and are not
counted. This might be because a U12 to U2 conversion
requires multiple fortuitous mutations or circumstances.
It has been shown that nucleotide substitutions at positions +4 to +7 of a U12-type 5’ splice site, particularly a
C to G change at +5, can activate cryptic splice sites in
the vicinity, leading to splicing through U2-type pathway, or leave the intron not removed [12,40]. Such
mutations are more likely to result in non-functional
proteins, and in turn, the mutant alleles are quickly
removed from the population. Moreover, if the initial
mutation does not disrupt the reading frame, the intron
is likely to become an ambiguous intron that is processed inefficiently by either spliceosome. Subsequent
mutations would typically be required to improve the
splice site of the U12-turned U2-type introns. Hence,
the transition from a U12-type to a U2-type requires
multiple changes and intermediates are likely to be
mutant alleles whose frequency will drift in the population. On the other hand, intron deletion is less likely to
disrupt the reading frame of the mature mRNAs, and
thus has a less negative effect than nucleotide mutations
in splice sites. In turn, alleles with a deleted intron are
more likely to be retained and fixed more quickly.
Gene retrotransposition and consequent loss of introns

We have observed several cases of U12 intron loss that
can be attributed to retrotransposition. In vertebrates,

Page 8 of 11

where U12-type introns are extremely conserved, gene
retroposition appears to be responsible for three out of
the eight losses of U12-type introns (the affected genes
are intronless). Interestingly, CCDC16, the vertebrate
ortholog of the D. melanogaster U12-containing gene
CG11839, has undergone three independent retropositions followed by a loss of intron-containing alleles, one
in early mammals and two in distinct fish lineages. Only
thirteen of the 160 D. melanogaster orthologs of the vertebrate U12-containing genes are intronless. However,
retrotransposition followed by intron gain is more likely
at such a long phylogenetic distance, so we cannot rule
out a larger role of retrotransposition in U12 intron
removal.
U12-U2 conversion occurs more frequently in GT-AG than
AT-AC subtype

Of the nearly one thousand U12-type intron clusters in
the U12DB, eighty-seven clusters have both U12- and
U2-type introns in orthologous position. These eightyseven non-redundant U12-type introns can be presumed
to have undergone type-conversion at least once during
the course of evolution. Eight of them also have both of
the U12 subtypes. Of the remaining seventy-nine clusters, seventy-four are of the GT-AG subtype and five
are of the AT-AC. The ratio of GT-AG to AT-AC subtypes in various genomes catalogued in the U12DB
ranges between 3:1 and 1:1. Comparing this ratio to the
total number of clusters of each subtype, 565:204 (GTAG:AT-AC), indicates that the underrepresentation of
the AT-AC subtype among clusters with conversions is
statistically significant (P-value 0.000015 from a Fisher
Exact test). Moreover, all eighty-seven U2-type introns
involved in conversion have GT-AG termini. This suggests that GT-AG U12-type introns are much more
likely to be converted to a U2-type. There are thirty-six
clusters with U12-introns with both subtypes indicating
subtype switching. Thus, it seems likely that AT-AC
intron conversion to the U2-type is preceded by a subtype switching from AT-AC to GT-AG, as previously
proposed by Burge et al. [13].
A rare pathway from AT-AC U12 to AT-AC U2-type

Although most type conversions from an AT-AC U12type are likely to involve prior subtype switching, we
think that the existing AT-AC U2-type introns are the
outcome of a much more rare U12 to U2 conversion
pathway. These AT-AC U2-type introns in the sodium
channel genes all have a G at position +5, a feature that
has been shown to be important for recognition of the
5’ splice site by the U2-spliceosome [12]. A possible scenario is that a C to G mutation at position +5 turns an
AT-AC U12-type intron into a suboptimal U2-type.
Subsequent mutations, particularly to an A at position
+4 or a T at position +6, would improve the recognition
of this site by the U2 spliceosome. The resulting AT-AC

Lin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/47

U2-type intron may then be “trapped” because, unlike in
the U12-type splicing, the U2-type splicing allows less
flexibility in the non-Watson-Crick interaction between
the first and last nucleotides. Subtype switching would
require simultaneous mutations at the intron termini,
while conversion to the AT-AC U12 type would require
multiple simultaneous mutations within the 5’ splice site
itself. These difficulties may explain the persistence of
suboptimal AT-AC U2-type introns.
Non-canonical U12-type introns

Given that the 5’ end dinucleotides of U12-type introns
seem to be under less constraint than are U2-type introns,
we investigated non-canonical 5’ dinucleotides present in
U12-type introns. In the U12DB, nineteen U12-type
introns do not have canonical donor sites (GT, GC, or
AT). Manual examination revealed that six are annotation
errors (four have AT-AC termini and two have GT-AG).
Six of the remaining thirteen are unambiguous U12 noncanonical 5’ dinucleotides. There are two CT-ACs in the
mouse and rat genes encoding trafficking protein particle
complex 9 (Trappc9, Nibp), three GG-AG introns in the
macaque and cow SLC12A4 genes and the rat SLC25A30
gene, and one GA-AG in the zebrafish actr10 gene. In all
of these cases, orthologous introns in other vertebrates
have either AT-AC or GT-AG consensus dinucleotide termini. Naturally occurring U12-type introns with these
three sets of termini (CT-AC, GG-AG, GA-AG) have
never been reported before. In a mutational study of terminal dinucleotide in U12-type introns, all sixteen possible
combinations of first and last nucleotides were tested in
the context of NU-AN [41]. Indeed the combination CUAC yields correct splicing products, albeit with a lower efficiency than the wide type. Claiming that the U at the second and the A at the one next to the last position of an
intron (NU-AN; denoted as +2 at the 5’ end and the -2 at
the 3’ end, respectively) are highly conserved according to
database search and mutant analyses; the authors also
tested the functionality of twelve combinations (excluding
G2) of nucleotides at these two positions in the context of
AN-NC. The results suggested that the nucleotides at +2
and -2 do not interact in the same way as those at +1 and
-1. Therefore, no experimental splicing data appear to challenge the functionality of GG-AG and GA-AG termini.
The discovery of these non-canonical U12-type
introns has two important implications. Firstly, this finding shows that the variation in the 5’ termini is greater
than previously thought and confirms the results of that
mutational study [41]. Secondly, it underscores the difficulty faced if noncanonical introns are to be recognized
in genome-scale analyses.

Conclusions
We investigated conservation and changes of the intron
state among orthologous U12-type introns identified in

Page 9 of 11

eighteen metazoan genomes. From our study it is clear
that intron loss contributes much more than conversion
of U12- to U2-type introns to the evolution of U12-type
introns. Conversion occurred more frequently in the
GT-AG subtype of U12 introns than in the “classic”
AT-AC subtype. Intron subtype switch has been widely
regarded as a unidirectional process [23,21]. However,
this picture has to be revised in the light of our discovery of the new dipterian U12-type intron in the dURP
gene. Interestingly, this intron appears to be a twintron
with ancestral U2-type splicing signals still active. With
the presence of these splice sites, the U12-type cis-elements arose from activation of cryptic splice site that
can be dated to early diptera. We also discovered six
non-canonical U12-type introns with three sets of terminal dinucleotide that have never been reported before
(CT-TC, GG-AG, and GA-AG). This indicates that
U12-type 5’ termini are more degenerate than previously
thought. At most, one case of U12-type intron gain was
found.
The presence of orthologous U12-type introns among
vertebrates has been highly conserved in the past 550
million years. The conservation is especially marked
among eutheria. Of the 442 unique intron positions,
only one unambiguous loss in mice and one U12 to U2
conversion in rats were observed. The non-chordates
investigated have considerably fewer U12-type introns
than vertebrates. Interestingly, the lineage with the fewest U12 introns, diptera, is the only one that acquired a
new U12-type intron. Although there is no orthologous
intron from outgroups in most of the nearly 200 cases
of intron loss several facts support intron loss view.
Nearly half of vertebrate U12-containing genes are
absent in non-chordates. This is likely a combination of
gene losses in the non-chordates and neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization of genes arising from largescale segmental duplication or whole genome duplication that occurred in early vertebrates, as is exemplified
by the multiple-U12-containing genes that encode the
ion channel alpha subunit. Thus, while our summary
clearly shows that all changes occur only slowly, it
appears that the loss of U12 introns greatly outstrips
the gain of U12 introns. We find only a single clear-cut
case of U12 intron gain. We note the recent exciting
discovery of high rates of intron gain in the crustacean
Daphnia [42]. It will be interesting to learn whether
U12 introns are also being gained in that species.
Finally, recent availability of more than twenty insect
genomes creates an ideal platform for studying the evolutionary dynamics of U12-type introns. Presently, we
are taking advantage of this system to investigate in
detail what steps are necessary to switch from one
intron type to another and what functional consequences it may have.

Methods
Data

We downloaded the MySQL version of the entire
U12DB version 1.0 published by Alioto [43]ftp://genome.imim.es/pub/software/u12/u12db_v1_0.sql.gz.
U12DB, a database with a web interface, provides information for U12-type intron identified in twenty
sequenced eukaryotic genomes and clusters of U12-type
introns and orthologous introns. In U12DB, orthology
between two introns was determined by sequence similarity of their flanking exonic sequences. Each orthologous U12-type intron cluster represents a unique intron
position with respect to the protein sequence that is
derived from the hosting genes. At least one of the
member introns is of the U12-type. Therefore, a set of
orthologous genes can share more than one U12-type
intron cluster.
Statuses of the introns in a cluster were encoded with
“1” - U12-type, “2"-ambiguous, which is denoted as
“U12/U2” in the U12DB, “3” - U2-type, and “4” - intron
absent. Intron states of all intron clusters were converted into a matrix of intron status versus species. Each
orthologous intron cluster is represented in the matrix
as one line of intron states for all species analyzed. If
gene orthology information is lacking for a certain species, the state of this species is coded by a “5” - missing
data. On the other hand, if multiple genes from one species are present in one cluster, intron states of the same
species were ranked in the order of U12-type, ambiguous, U2-type introns, and intron absent. The top ranking was retained to represent the species. Patterns of
intron states were used to infer conservation of the
U12-type intron among taxa at varying phylogenetic distances. We conducted manual inspections extensively to
correct potentially false cases of intron absence and
missing orthologs in the U12DB. We relied on a variety
of sources for validation of automated results when
necessary. These sources included Entrez Gene [44], evidence viewer, and Blink from NCBI, Ensembl [45], the
UCSC Genome Browser [46], and the UniProt Knowledgebase [47].
