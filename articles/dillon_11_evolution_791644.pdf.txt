The evolution of reproductive isolation in a
simultaneous hermaphrodite, the freshwater
snail Physa
Robert T Dillon Jr1*, Amy R Wethington2 and Charles Lydeard3,4

Abstract
Background: The cosmopolitan freshwater snail Physa acuta has recently found widespread use as a model
organism for the study of mating systems and reproductive allocation. Mitochondrial DNA phylogenies suggest
that Physa carolinae, recently described from the American southeast, is a sister species of P. acuta. The divergence
of the acuta/carolinae ancestor from the more widespread P. pomilia appears to be somewhat older, and the split
between a hypothetical acuta/carolinae/pomilia ancestor and P. gyrina appears older still.
Results: Here we report the results of no-choice mating experiments yielding no evidence of hybridization
between gyrina and any of four other populations (pomilia, carolinae, Philadelphia acuta, or Charleston acuta), nor
between pomilia and carolinae. Crosses between pomilia and both acuta populations yielded sterile F1 progeny
with reduced viability, while crosses between carolinae and both acuta populations yielded sterile F1 hybrids of
normal viability. A set of mate-choice tests also revealed significant sexual isolation between gyrina and all four of
our other Physa populations, between pomilia and carolinae, and between pomilia and Charleston acuta, but not
between pomilia and the acuta population from Philadelphia, nor between carolinae and either acuta population.
These observations are consistent with the origin of hybrid sterility prior to hybrid inviability, and a hypothesis that
speciation between pomilia and acuta may have been reinforced by selection for prezygotic reproductive isolation
in sympatry.
Conclusions: We propose a two-factor model for the evolution of postzygotic reproductive incompatibility in this
set of five Physa populations consistent with the Dobzhansky-Muller model of speciation, and a second two-factor
model for the evolution of sexual incompatibility. Under these models, species trees may be said to correspond
with gene trees in American populations of the freshwater snail, Physa.

Background
Although the evolution of reproductive isolation has been
a focus of intense interest since the birth of the Modern
Synthesis, its quantification is often not a trivial exercise.
Among animal taxa, most research effort has focused on
Drosophila [1,2], birds [3,4], amphibians [5,6], and fish
[7,8]. In gastropod mollusks, the mechanisms of reproductive isolation have been elucidated only in the marine
prosobranch snail Littorina [9,10], opisthobranch sea
slugs [11], certain terrestrial (stylommatophoran) pulmonates [12,13], and in the freshwater (basommatophoran)
pulmonates that will be the focus of the present work.

The barriers to reproduction that may evolve between a
pair of populations have customarily been divided into
prezygotic and postzygotic components, both of which are
typically inherited in a complex and polygenic fashion.
Coyne [14] reported that the shortened copulations
observed between Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana,
for example, are controlled by genes on all three major
chromosomes, the two autosomes more important than
the X chromosome. With regard to postzygotic reproductive isolation, experiments with F2 backcrosses among
Drosophila species have consistently demonstrated that
hybrid sterility is attributable to genes on every arm of
every chromosome [15]. Presgraves [16] estimated
approximately 191 hybrid-lethal incompatibilities between
D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Thirteen loci in seven

linkage groups were implicated in the origin of postzygotic
isolation speciation among lake whitefish by Rogers and
Bernatchez [17].
A positive correlation has often been documented
between degree of reproductive isolation and overall
genetic divergence [18-20]. This relationship was first
demonstrated in the D. willistoni species complex of
South America by Ayala et al. [21] using variation at allozyme-encoding loci, and has since been confirmed in
Drosophila generally [1,2], Lepidoptera [22], fish [23],
amphibians [6,24], and birds [3]. Most of these studies
have focused on postzygotic reproductive isolation,
which tends to evolve more slowly than prezygotic isolation [25]. Although a lag is generally noted between the
accumulation of genetic differences and the onset of
reproductive barriers in these studies [26], the temporal
relationship between genetic divergence and reproductive
isolation seems sufficiently predictable to prompt theoretical exploration of a “speciation clock” [18,27].
Since the advent of modern molecular methods for phylogenetic reconstruction, increased attention has turned
toward the detailed correspondence between gene trees
and the reproductive relationships among the populations
from which marker genes have been sampled. As might be
expected from the complex and polygenic nature of reproductive barriers, however, their correlation with any single
gene or small number of genes arbitrarily selected to
reconstruct a population phylogeny under the neutral
model may be poor [28]. In both the D. melanogaster and
D. willistoni species groups, for example, genes sampled
from narrowly restricted but reproductively isolated species nest within the branches of gene trees constructed
from their more widely-dispersed progenitors, rendering
the ancestor species paraphyletic [25,29-31]. In the group
of D. pseudoobscura, none of 16 genes sampled from
10-20 individuals unambiguously returned the known
reproductive relationships among three populations, relative to an outgroup [32]. Such discrepancies have led
some systematists to endorse “phylogenetic” species concepts based not on reproductive isolation, but rather on
the evolutionary history of marker genes [33].
The purpose of the work we present here is to examine
the origin of reproductive isolation in a simultaneous
hermaphrodite from a phylogenetic perspective. We
focus on freshwater pulmonate snails of the genus Physa,
which by virtue of their reproductive plasticity, ease of
culture, and availability of genetic markers have become
important models for the study of mating systems generally [34-36]. The best-known species is Physa acuta,
apparently a North American native introduced to Europe in the early nineteenth century and subsequently
spread to six continents [37]. In cultured populations,
male fertility develops around 6 weeks post-hatch, and
female fertility is added around week 7, with the onset of

Page 2 of 11

self-fertilization around week 9, if no partner is supplied
[38-41]. However, the reductions in parental fecundity
and F1 viability engendered by self-fertilization seem to
select strongly for outcrossing [39,42-46].
North America is also home to approximately ten lesser-known species in the family Physidae, differing from
P. acuta by reproductive anatomy, habitat, and minor
aspects of shell morphology [47]. Swamps and ditches in
the southeastern United States are inhabited by Physa
carolinae, bearing a darker and more slender shell than
P. acuta, and river margins are inhabited by Physa
pomilia, reaching adulthood at a smaller size [48]. Both
P. carolinae and P. pomilia have two-part penial
sheaths, with a larger muscular portion and a smaller
glandular portion, while the penial sheath of P. acuta is
not subdivided. Further north, more stable freshwater
environments are inhabited by Physa gyrina, distinguished by a two-part penial sheath with approximately
equal glandular and muscular portions [49,50].
In recent years substantial research effort has been
directed toward quantifying the reproductive isolation
among North American physid populations. The experimental tools available are directly analogous to the “matechoice” and “no-choice” tests that have become established
by common practice with dioecious animals displaying
obligate sexual reproduction [33], slightly modified in their
interpretation for hermaphrodites.
Physa mate-choice tests have been modelled closely on
the experimental design used with Drosophila in population cages for many years [1,2,51]. Such methods have
been applied to examine specific relationships in the
freshwater pulmonate snail Biomphalaria [52,53] and in
land snails [54,55], as well as in the dioecious prosobranch snail Littorina [56,57]. Although Physa are simultaneously hermaphroditic, copulation is unidirectional,
with prospective partners typically vying to assume the
male role. The complex behaviors documented in pairs
of mating physids [58,59] have been attributed both to
sexual conflict (the rejection of males by females [60])
and to gender conflict (between hermaphroditic animals
vying to mate as male [61]). Thus while the reproductive
relationships among pairs of physid populations can be
quantified using standard mate-choice statistics, each
datum is not a “choice” in any sense, but rather the outcome of a contest. Any consistent approach to scoring
that outcome yielding a single observation per individual
might be employed.
The use of no-choice tests to evaluate reproductive isolation was also pioneered with fruit flies [15] and such
techniques have been used to explore specific relationships in the freshwater pulmonate snail Bulinus [62,63]
and in the marine prosobranch Lacuna [64]. But the
interpretation of such experiments is again somewhat
ambiguous in hermaphrodites such as Physa, since any

individual snail always has a “choice” to outcross with the
single partner provided or to self-fertilize. Thus in addition to comparing the fertility and fecundity of outcrossed pairs to their corresponding incross controls, the
hybridity of first-generation progeny must be confirmed
using genetic markers, and any offspring of self-fertilization subtracted.
Here we report an expansion of our previous work to
include both mate-choice and no-choice tests among all
pairs of P. acuta, P. carolinae, P. pomilia and P. gyrina.
We add a second population of P. acuta to test for discrepancies due to paraphyly, such as have been the concern of the proponents of phylogenetic species concepts.
The results of these 10 possible pairwise comparisons
are then cast into a phylogenic framework (a “species
tree”) using the mtDNA sequence data of Wethington
and Lydeard [47] and Wethington et al. [48]. By this
approach we are able to infer the relative rates of evolution for hybrid sterility, hybrid inviability, and sexual
incompatibility.

Results
Sexual isolation

As has previously been documented [45,58,59], our
approach of rearing snails to adulthood in isolation
before initiating mate-choice tests seemed to yield many
animals eager to copulate in the male role, while rejective in the female role. We typically observed a high frequency of mating activity over the six hours of each
trial, each snail often involved in multiple copulations.
Across the ten pairwise comparisons of our five populations, the minimum number of initial copulations as
male observed was 38, and the median 47, of 60 possible
(Table 1).
Values of the IPSI statistic testing for sexual isolation
between all pairs of populations are given below the
diagonal of Table 1. No sexual isolation was demonstrated in pairings among Physa carolinae and Physa
acuta (either Charleston or Philadelphia), all copulations
involving those three comparisons appearing indiscriminate. Our experiments did generally detect significant

sexual isolation between populations of the acuta/carolinae group and both Physa pomilia and P. gyrina. The
exception was the acuta-p × pomilia comparison, where
14 of the 22 initial copulations of Philadelphia acuta as
males were with pomilia as females, and 10 of the 28
initial copulations of pomilia as males were with acuta
as females, yielding an IPSI statistic near zero.
Hybridization

Example results from one of our no-choice experiments
and its corresponding pair of controls are shown in
Figure 1. Parental survivorship was excellent in this set
of 30 pairs, as was generally observed through the duration of all experiments and controls reported here, only
one pair of parents failing to survive the 16 weeks of
observation. In this case the pomilia controls initiated
reproduction at an earlier week (and at a smaller size)
than either the acuta-p controls or the acuta-p × pomilia outcross experiment, the three-pair threshold being
reached at week 5 for pomilia, but week 7 for acuta-p
and acuta-p × pomilia. Then through the ten subsequent weeks, Figure 1 demonstrates that parental
fecundity was greatest in the pomilia control, lowest in
the acuta-p control, and intermediate in the outcross
experiment, with the survivorship of the F1 hatchlings
roughly comparable in all three cases. Oviposition was
ultimately observed in 9 outcross pairs, 7 control acutap pairs, and all 10 control pomilia pairs.
Age of first parental reproduction, parental fecundity,
and the yield of viable F1 hatchlings in all no choice
experiments across all three years of experimentation are
compared with their corresponding controls in Table 2.
Note that statistics shown in the lower half of each table
section should be compared to the corresponding controls leftward of the dot, and statistics in the upper half
of each section to corresponding controls right of the
dot. We were unable to confirm any outcross progeny
among the F1 recovered from five no-choice experiments
- the four involving Physa gyrina and the one pairing
P. carolinae with P. pomilia. Allozyme electrophoretic
analysis of the first generation progeny recovered from
these sets of outcross pairs revealed all reproduction to
have been the result of self-fertilization by the non-gyrina
parent in the acuta-p × gyrina and carolinae × gyrina
experiments, as was previously reported in the acuta-c ×
gyrina experiment by Dillon et al. [65]. Only the carolinae parent reproduced in the carolinae × pomilia experiment. Both parents self-fertilized to produce the first
generation offspring recovered from the pomilia × gyrina
experiment.
Two sets of no-choice mating experiments yielded F1
progeny that proved to result from mixtures of outcrossing and self-fertilization - the crosses of Physa
pomilia with Physa acuta from both Philadelphia and

experiment as 25% self-acuta, 25% self-pomilia and 50%
outcrossed. Polymorphisms at the LAP, Isdh, Est6 and
Pgm loci permitted us to classify 68 F1 progeny recovered from the acuta-p × pomilia experiment (newly
reported here) as 25% self-acuta, 56% self-pomilia, and
19% outcrossed.
Our second generation observations further suggested
that the subsets of hybrid progeny recovered from both
of the acuta × pomilia outcross experiments may have
been sterile. Only four of the nine F1 × F1 pairs from
the acuta-c × pomilia experiment yielded any viable second generation progeny after 21 weeks of observation,
all four of which were subsequently revealed by allozyme analysis to have involved selfed F1 animals [66].
Six of the nine F1 × F1 pairs tested from the acuta-p ×
pomilia experiment ultimately yielded viable progeny in
the second generation, the slightly higher proportion
attributable to the lower proportion of hybrids among
the F1.
Allozyme analysis confirmed that the three remaining
no-choice experiments (involving acuta-c, acuta-p, and
carolinae) yielded entirely hybrid F1 progeny, with viabilities intermediate between their two corresponding incross
controls (Table 2, lower). All nine of the F1 × F1 crosses
from the acuta-c × acuta-p experiment yielded viable F2
progeny, with no apparent delay in reproduction [37].
Although oviposition was noted in six of the nine F1 × F1
pairs from the acuta-p × carolinae experiment, however,
only one pair yielded viable second generation progeny
over 21 weeks of observation. And none of the nine F1 ×
F1 pairs tested from the acuta-c × carolinae experiment
yielded any viable F2 offspring over 12 weeks of observation, although again, oviposition was observed in 8 pairs
[67]. It would appear that acuta x carolinae hybrids are
almost entirely sterile.

for postzygotic reproductive isolation. Along with parental
survivorship (right axis, solid circles) we report the number of

Charleston (marked “M” in Table 2). Parents in the
acuta-p × pomilia experiment exhibited a significant
delay in reproduction (Figure 1), although no such phenomenon was detected in the acuta-c × pomilia experiment (Table 2 upper). Nor was any significant reduction
apparent in mean parental fecundity (Table 2 middle) or
the combined survivorship of the (heterogeneous) F1
progeny (Table 2 lower) from either outcross experiment. Nevertheless, a fixed difference at the LAP locus
allowed Dillon et al. [66] to unambiguously classify 36
F1 progeny analyzed from the acuta-c × pomilia

Molecular phylogeny

The strict consensus tree from our phylogenetic analysis
of mtDNA sequence divergence is shown in Figure 2a,
branch lengths scaled by neighbor-joining. Of the 979
characters on which this tree was based, 224 were variable
and parsimony-informative, and 68 were variable but
uninformative. This simplified tree agrees well with the
more comprehensive phylogenies published by Wethington and Lydeard [47] and Wethington et al. [48], Physa
acuta and P. carolinae being depicted as sister taxa,
with P. pomilia their most immediate joint ancestor, and
P. gyrina more distant, given Aplexa as an outgroup.

Discussion
Although it is not conceptually difficult to model the
process of biological speciation as a phylogenetic tree,
graphically the exercise may pose substantial challenges.
This is because the data are relational. Reproductive

isolation is not a character that can be attributed to a
population, but rather can only be measured among
pairs of populations.
At both the finest level and at the most coarse, however, the observations we report here on reproductive
isolation among our five Physa populations match the
consensus gene tree returned by our phylogenetic analysis unambiguously. Mitochondrial genes sequenced from
individuals sampled from our two P. acuta populations
were the most similar molecularly, and those two populations displayed no reproductive isolation detectable by
our methods. And our P. gyrina population was the
most reproductively isolated of the five populations we
examined, and contained the two individuals whose
mtDNA sequence was the most divergent in our molecular phylogeny. No viable hybrids were produced when
gyrina was paired with any other population; individual
P. gyrina strongly preferred to copulate among themselves if offered a choice.
A simple model for the evolution of F1 infertility among
the four populations from which any bona fide hybrids
were recovered is offered in Figure 2c. This process can be
cast directly on the gene tree (Figure 2a) by assuming a
single compatibility locus, with some unique allele for
incompatibility evolving on two separate occasions.
At intermediate levels of population divergence, however, the correspondence between our gene tree and the
evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms is less
clear. For while the cross of carolinae to acuta (either

Charleston or Philadelphia) yielded 100% hybrids in
high frequencies, and the cross of pomilia to acuta
(either population) yielded hybrids in reduced frequencies (mixed with selfed progeny), no viable carolinae ×
pomilia hybrids were recovered. No rearrangement of
the phylogeny implied by our gene tree can account for
such observations using a single factor. Similarly, our
mate-choice data do not cast easily onto the gene tree
phylogeny at intermediate levels of divergence. For
although we detected significant sexual isolation
between the acuta/carolinae group and both pomilia
and gyrina in almost all combinations, populations of
P. acuta from Philadelphia and P. pomilia seemed to
copulate freely.
In Figure 2b we offer a two-locus model that might
account for our observations on hybridization among our
five populations of Physa. We postulate a “complete” locus
J and a “partial” locus K, at which unique compatibility
alleles 1, 2, 3, ... may segregate. Locus J is epistatic over
locus K in our model, such that hybrids homozygous at
the J locus are always completely viable, regardless of genotype at locus K, but J heterozygotes may show either partial viability (homozygous K) or complete inviability
(heterozygous K). Thus from a J1K1 ancestor, gyrina might
be modelled as fixed for J2K2, pomilia might be J3K1, carolinae might be J1K3, and both acuta populations retain the
ancestral J 1 K 1 genotype. Interaction between a pair of
genes in this fashion would be consistent with the classic
Dobzhansky-Muller model of speciation [33]. We

emphasize that we have no data directly bearing on the
genetics of reproductive isolation in Physa, however, and
that other models might be offered to fit our observations
on hybrid viability equally well.
Nor can any single-factor model account for our
observations on prezygotic reproductive isolation among
our five populations of Physa. But again, a two-locus
model such as that offered in Figure 2d would account
for our observations, consistent with the gene tree. Here
we postulate two complementary loci J and K, with
unique compatibility alleles 1, 2, 3,..., a match at one
locus being sufficient for sexual compatibility. Then
from a J1K1 ancestor, under our model gyrina might be
J 2 K 2 , pomilia might be J 3 K 1 , carolinae might be J 1 K 3 ,
acuta-c might be J 1 K 4 , and acuta-p might retain the
ancestral genotype J1K1.
Our observations are consistent with at least one generalization that has emerged from comparative studies of
speciation in many other groups of organisms - that
hybrid sterility evolves faster than hybrid inviability [33].
While hybrids between acuta and carolinae were entirely
viable, and hybrids between acuta and pomilia partially
so, the measured levels of fertility in all these hybrid
classes were effectively nil. Regarding the relative rates of
evolution for hybrid inviability and sexual incompatibility, our results seem to favor a slightly earlier appearance
of the latter. Although neither form of reproductive isolation appeared effective at the branch between carolinae
and the Charleston/Philadelphia acuta ancestor, our
observations at the branch between pomilia and the joint
acuta/carolinae ancestor suggest that evolution at one
(hypothetical) locus for sexual compatibility may have
occurred only quite recently.
Taken together, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that speciation between P. acuta and P. pomilia may
have been reinforced by natural selection for prezygotic
isolating mechanisms [68,69]. Although P. acuta ranges
throughout North America, P. pomilia seems more common and widespread in the American southeast. In the
Charleston area populations of both species are not
uncommonly sympatric, especially in the backwaters or
margins of slow-moving rivers. We are not aware of any

populations of P. pomilia in the vicinity of Philadelphia,
however. Given the significant delay in reproduction we
documented in the acuta-p/pomilia outcross experiment
(Figure 1, Table 2 upper), the high frequency of selfed progeny among their F1 (Table 2 lower), and the apparent
sterility suffered by their hybrids, one might expect selection for prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms in
sympatry, such as those returned from our mate-choice
experiments between pomilia and Charleston acuta
(Table 1). But the evolution of prezygotic isolation would
seem less likely between pomilia and allopatric Philadelphia acuta, where no such selection may have taken place.
Although tabulated as “choices,” the primary data we
recorded from our mate-choice tests were each the outcome of a contest [61]. The 41 copulations we observed
in the acuta-c × pomilia test included just 11 heterogametic pairings, equally split by gender - 5 with Charleston acuta serving as the female and 6 with pomilia the
female [66]. The 50 copulations we observed in the
acuta-p × pomilia test included 24 heterogametic pairings, also evenly split by gender. Thus our data contain
no overt evidence of differing selection regimes in the
P. acuta populations of Philadelphia and Charleston.
And it must be emphasized that a variety of explanations other than reinforcement have been offered to
account for differing degrees of prezygotic reproduction
among species in sympatry and allopatry [33].

Conclusions
Our observations on the evolution of reproductive isolation in our five populations of Physa can be modelled
with five genes - two loci for sexual compatibility, two
loci for hybridization, and one locus for F1 fertility. The
trees depicting evolution at these five loci (Figures 2d, b,
and 2c) are consistent with the gene tree shown in
Figure 2a.
We note, however, that some confusion has arisen in
recent years over the term, “species tree. “Although the
concept has an old history, “species tree” was brought
into modern prominence by Maddison [70] to distinguish
a phylogeny based on genes (a “gene tree”) from the true
evolutionary history of a set of populations, which he
called a “species tree. “Although the example postulated
by Maddison ("when reproductive communities are split
by speciation”) implied reproductive isolation, the processes he highlighted that might lead to discord (“lineage
sorting or deep coalescence”) would apply to any set of
populations regardless of their reproductive relationships.
Thus many subsequent workers (e.g. [71,72]) have used
the term “species tree” as a synonym for “population
tree.”
But biological species are typically composed of more
than one population, and the complex reproductive relationships among a set of populations will have their own

Page 7 of 11

evolutionary history, independent of (although probably
correlated with) both the true historical relationships of
the population tree and whatever molecular markers
systematic biologists might find convenient to construct
gene trees. We would suggest that the term “species
tree” be reserved for figures conveying the evolution
of reproductive isolation, such as those shown on
Figures 2b, c and 2d, and that the term “population
tree” be applied by workers such as Maddison. And
then under the narrower definition adopted here, gene
trees correspond to species trees in the freshwater snail,
Physa.

Methods
Study populations

The five populations from which our samples were drawn
were all apparently large and open, certainly numbering in
the millions of individuals. The population of Physa acuta
here abbreviated “acuta-c” originated from the pond at
Charles Towne Landing State Park, Charleston, SC
(32.8062°N; 79.9862°W). This is the standard population
from which many of our laboratory lines have originated
for previous studies of Physa reproductive biology
[37-39,61,67,73]. The population of P. acuta abbreviated
“acuta-p” was originally sampled from the Schuylkill River
in Philadelphia, PA (39.9951°N; 75.1923°W). This is the
type locality of Physa heterostropha, synonymized under
P. acuta by Dillon et al. [37]. Our sample of Physa carolinae originated from the spring at Huger Landing in Berkeley Co, SC (33.1305°N; 79.8111°W). This is the type
locality for the species [48]. We collected our population
of Physa pomilia from the Combahee River at Yemassee,
SC (32.7060°N; 80.8281°W). This is the type locality of
Physa hendersoni, synonymized under P. pomilia by Dillon
et al. [66]. Our population of Physa gyrina originated from
Hot Springs, VA (38.0012°N; 79.8330°W). This is the type
locality of Physa aurea, subsequently synonymized under
P. gyrina [65,74,75].
Culture

Our standard culture vessel was a transparent polyethylene 10 oz. drinking cup, filled with approximately 210 mL
of aerated, filtered pond water, and covered with a 95 ×
15 mm polystyrene Petri-dish lid. The food was O.S.I.
Spirulina Aquarium Flake Food (Ocean Star International,
Hayward, CA), finely ground. All experiments were conducted at room temperature, approximately 23°C, in a
12:12 diurnal cycle. We initially isolated 10 wild-collected
snails from each study population in separate cups, collected egg masses with weekly feeding and water change,
and reared the offspring to 2-mm shell length, well in
advance of maturity. These unrelated sets of wildconceived but laboratory-born sibships were designated
carolinae1 through carolinae10, pomilia1 through

Dillon et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:144
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/144

pomilia10, gyrina1 through gyrina10, and so forth. From
these five sets of ten sibships we drew isolates for matechoice tests and pairs of parents for no-choice hybridization studies.
Mate-choice tests

For mate-choice tests, large samples of juvenile snails from
all populations were isolated in individual cups and reared
to maturity over the course of 8 to 10 weeks, with weekly
feeding and water change. Then for each of the 4+3+2+1
= 10 pairwise comparisons (carolinae × pomilia, carolinae
× gyrina, pomilia × gyrina, and so forth) we performed 3
mating trials, each trial involving 10 adults from two
populations. The 20 snails selected for each trial were all
approximately equal in shell size, to minimize size-dependent gender effects [76,77]. Each was blotted dry and
marked with a small dab of fingernail polish according to
its population of origin. Then all 20 individuals were
simultaneously introduced into a 2-L glass beaker (filled
with 1,400 mL of filtered, aerated pond water) and placed
on a glass table to facilitate observation.
We monitored mating activity for 6 hours. When a snail
first successfully copulated as male (defined as the complete insertion of its penis into the gonopore of a partner),
it was removed from the beaker, its shell marked with a
dot of white correction fluid, and returned. Each individual
snail was often involved in many matings over the 6 hours
of observation, in both the male and the female role, but
only its first successful copulation as a male was recorded.
Note that this design yields a slight bias toward heterogametic pairings, not 1:1 but rather 9:10.
Each of the three trials for all ten pairwise comparisons
involved 20 fresh, unmated snails. Fisher exact tests (with
Bonferroni correction) returned no evidence of significant heterogeneity across the three trials for each comparison. Thus we pooled our results across trials to yield
mate-choice observations on 30 snails from each population combined with 30 snails from each of the other four
populations. The Rolán-Alvarez and Caballero [78] Index
of Pair Sexual Isolation (IPSI) was calculated from each
of the ten 2 × 2 frequency tables that resulted using
JMating 1.0.8 [79], and tested with t-statistics, using
sequential Bonferroni correction. Of the many statistics
commonly employed to measure sexual isolation, only
the IPSI demonstrates negligible bias from differing mating propensity at lower sample sizes [80]. Given the prediction that speciation will yield positive-assortative
mating, one-tailed tests were appropriate.
No-choice tests

No-choice experiments were set up with ten unrelated
juveniles (at size 2 mm) paired between all populations,
for example carolinae1 × pomilia1, carolinae2 × pomilia2, ..., carolinae10 × pomilia10. Two corresponding

Page 8 of 11

sets of controls were initiated using ten pairs of juveniles from unrelated sibships within each population, for
example carolinae1 × carolinae2, carolinae2 × carolinae3, ..., carolinae10 × carolinae1 and pomilia1 × pomilia2, pomilia2 × pomilia3, ..., pomilia10 × pomilia1. Each
of these 30 pairs of snails (designated the parental generation) received a water change and fresh food every
7 days, at which time the sides of the cup were
inspected for egg masses. If egg masses were present, we
counted all embryos as a measure of fecundity and
transferred the parents to a fresh cup. Eggs were monitored until hatching (generally about 2 weeks) and all
viable, crawling F1 juveniles were counted. Observation
was terminated upon the death of either parent in a
pair. The total period of observation varied for each set
of ten pairs, as detailed below.
Evidence of speciation will be demonstrated ifthe central tendency of age at first reproduction in any set of 10
experimental pairs is significantly delayed behind the
slower of its two sets of 10 corresponding control pairs.
This (one-tailed) hypothesis was tested between each pair
of populations by calculating a combined (20 pair) median and comparing counts above and below that median
using a Fisher’s exact test, with Bonferroni correction.
For an independent analysis of fecundity and F1 viability,
week 1 was established separately for each set of 10 pairs
as the first week in which eggs were laid by 3 or more
pairs of parents. Embryos and viable hatchlings were subsequently counted for 10 weeks. We then averaged the
embryo production of each pair of parents across its lifetime, ignoring any leading (pre-maturity) zeros and any
postmortem zeros, while tallying as “0” any failure to
reproduce by viable, mature pairs. We used Kruskal-Wallis
nonparametric ANOVAs to test the one-tailed hypothesis
that the central tendency in the weekly mean fecundity of
each set of 10 experimental pairs might be depressed
below its two corresponding sets of 10 control pairs, with
Bonferroni correction.
Similarly, we averaged the counts of F1 hatchlings within
pairs across weeks, ignoring zeros not corresponding to
embryo production, and divided each pair mean by its
mean embryo production to obtain pair mean F1 viability.
We used a second set of Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric
ANOVAs to test the one-tailed hypothesis that the central
tendency in the weekly mean F1 viability posted by each
set of 10 experimental pairs might be depressed below its
2 corresponding sets of 10 control pairs, with Bonferroni
correction.
To assess the fertility of putative hybrid offspring, F1
hatchlings (both experimental and control) were reared
from each of 3 separate unrelated pairs to a size of 2 mm.
These were crossed in time series: 1 early pair from eggs
laid around week one, 1 middle pair produced around
week five, and 1 late pair produced around week ten, to

Dillon et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:144
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/144

yield 9 F1 pairs. So (for example) if the putative hybrid
progeny were reared from pairs carolinae1 × pomilia1,
carolinae2 × pomilia2, and carolinae3 × pomilia3, they
were crossed as CP1 × CP2 early, CP2 × CP3 early, CP3
× CP1 early, CP1 × CP2 middle, CP2 × CP3 middle, ...,
CP3 × CP1 late. Nine crosses were likewise constituted
for controls (carolinae and pomilia in this example), and
the total of 3 × 9 = 27 crosses of F1 snails reared to
adulthood for each experiment, with weekly feeding and
water change. We recorded the dates at which embryos
and viable F2 hatchlings were produced by each of the 27
pairs of F1 snails, for all 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 pairwise comparisons between populations.
Allozyme analysis

A larger sample of F1 progeny from the 3 experimental
pairs (for example, carolinae1 × pomilia1, carolinae2 ×
pomilia2, and carolinae3 × pomilia3, following as above)
were reared to 4-mm to 5-mm shell length, at which time
they were frozen in 100 μL of tissue buffer for analysis by
allozyme electrophoresis to confirm hybridity. We have
identified 12 enzyme-encoding loci at which allozyme variation is interpretable as the product of codominant alleles
segregating in Mendelian fashion [81]. These are aconitase
(Acon), esterases (three loci: Est1, Est3, Est6), glucose
phosphate isomerase (Gpi), isocitrate dehydrogenase (two
loci: Isdh1 and Isdh2), leucine aminopeptidase (Lap), mannose phosphate isomerase (Mpi), phosphoglucomutase
(2 loci: Pgm1 and Pgm2), and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6pgd). We used horizontal starch gel electrophoresis in an aminopropylmorpholine pH 6 buffer
system to resolve allozyme variation at the Gpi, Isdh, and
6pgd loci; a Tris-Citrate pH 6 buffer system for Acon,
Mpi, and Pgm; and a TEB8 system for 6pgd, Lap, and Est.
Details regarding our electrophoretic methods, including a
description of our equipment and recipes for stains and
buffers, have been previously published [82,83].
Overall analysis

The data on reproductive isolation analyzed here were
gathered in three sets, fresh controls being required with
each set. The first set of experiments, no-choice tests of
hybridization between P. acuta from Philadelphia (acutap) and Charleston (acuta-c), were completed in 2001 and
published (together with data on four other P. acuta
populations) by Dillon et al. [37]. The fecundity and F1
viability data reported in that work are here trimmed
back to a 10-week basis for comparison, medians and
ranges being substituted for means and variances. The
second set of experiments, both mate-choice tests and
no-choice experiments involving acuta-c, gyrina, carolinae, and pomilia, were conducted in 2002. Our acuta-c ×
gyrina results were published by Dillon et al. [65], our

Page 9 of 11

acuta-c × pomilia results (confirming the specific status
of P. pomilia) were published by Dillon et al. [66], and
our acuta-c × carolinae and acuta-c × pomilia results
(confirming the specific status of P. carolinae) were published by Dillon [67]. Our 2002 gyrina × carolinae and
gyrina × pomilia results have not heretofore seen publication. The third set of experiments, both mate-choice
and no-choice tests among populations acuta-p, gyrina,
carolinae, and pomilia, were conducted in 2003 and have
been entirely unpublished until the present.
We have also published several large scale or comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analyses of the Physidae
in recent years [47,48,74]. The simplified gene tree
extracted for the present work was based on a concatenation of a 633 base pair segment of the mitochondrial
cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene and a 346 base pair
segment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene (loops
removed). Sequences were available for two individuals
from each of our five populations, which we analyzed by
standard heuristic search with optimality criterion set to
parsimony, rooting with the outgroup physid Aplexa
elongata (PAUP* version 4.0b10 [84]). The strict consensus tree recovered was evaluated with a jackknife
procedure (10,000 reps with 50% deletion each rep), and
its branch lengths scaled using a neighbor-joining
analysis.
The topology of the gene tree recovered was used as a
starting point for models reconstructing the evolution of
reproductive isolation in our sample of five Physa populations. We assumed reproductive compatibility at the
base of the tree, and hypothesized a minimum number
of independent origins for reproductive barriers on the
branches.
