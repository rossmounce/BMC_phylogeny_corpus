Abstract
Background: The presence of gaps in an alignment of nucleotide or protein sequences is often an
inconvenience for bioinformatical studies. In phylogenetic and other analyses, for instance, gapped
columns are often discarded entirely from the alignment.
Results: MaxAlign is a program that optimizes the alignment prior to such analyses. Specifically, it
maximizes the number of nucleotide (or amino acid) symbols that are present in gap-free columns
– the alignment area – by selecting the optimal subset of sequences to exclude from the alignment.
MaxAlign can be used prior to phylogenetic and bioinformatical analyses as well as in other
situations where this form of alignment improvement is useful. In this work we test MaxAlign's
performance in these tasks and compare the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates including and
excluding gapped columns from the analysis, with and without processing with MaxAlign. In this
paper we also introduce a new simple measure of tree similarity, Normalized Symmetric Similarity
(NSS) that we consider useful for comparing tree topologies.
Conclusion: We demonstrate how MaxAlign is helpful in detecting misaligned or defective
sequences without requiring manual inspection. We also show that it is not advisable to exclude
gapped columns from phylogenetic analyses unless MaxAlign is used first. Finally, we find that the
sequences removed by MaxAlign from an alignment tend to be those that would otherwise be
associated with low phylogenetic accuracy, and that the presence of gaps in any given sequence
does not seem to disturb the phylogenetic estimates of other sequences.

Background
A multiple alignment of nucleotide or protein sequences
often forms the basis for phylogenetic analysis. In a perfect alignment, gaps correspond to insertion or deletion
events, and as such should contain phylogenetic information on a par with substitutions. While some work has
been done to make use of this type of data [1-3] there are

still many unsolved issues. Additionally, gaps can also
stem from misalignment, as well as from sequencing or
data-management problems, in which case they obviously
provide no useful information. Consequently, several bioinformatical and phylogenetic analyses are often based on
alignments where gapped columns (i.e., columns containing at least one gap) have been discarded. For instance,

removal of gapped columns is an option in the frequently
used programs Paup [4], Paml [5] and Crann [6]. However, as the number of sequences in an alignment grows,
the probability of having a gap in any given site also
grows, and with it the risk of removing that site from the
analysis. An alternative approach, that is sometimes used
when applying maximum likelihood and other modelbased methods, is to treat the gaps as unknown nucleotides (or amino acids) and sum over all the possible
combinations, but this is not consensual and can become
prohibitively costly for larger data sets. For some bioinformatical analyses, moreover, this alternative is not possible.

sequences. The simulated data were constructed so it
resembled the Pfam-data in terms of sequence divergence,
and in the number and length of gaps (see below). Specifically, we analyzed the following aspects of MaxAlign
behaviour: (1) performance of the heuristic version of the
MaxAlign algorithm (optimality and computation time),
(2) Improvement of alignment area by MaxAlign, (3)
Ability of MaxAlign to remove "contaminating" (nonhomologous) sequences from an alignment, (4) Impact
of MaxAlign on phylogenetic accuracy (meaning how
closely the reconstructed tree resembles the true tree), and
(5) Impact of MaxAlign on the computation time of subsequent maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis.

One way around this problem is to remove particularly
gap-rich sequences, thereby ending up with a dataset containing more ungapped columns. This solution is of
course not meaningful if the main goal of the analysis is
to infer the topology of the phylogenetic tree connecting
all the included taxa and one has a sufficiently long
sequence. However, there are many other scenarios where
the approach can be useful. For instance, it is often the
case in molecular evolutionary analysis today that the
focus is not on the phylogeny but on the analysis of the
sequences themselves, and on properties of each position,
such as the rate of evolution or the action of natural selection. In such cases keeping the sites in the analysis
becomes important. The use of an automated, rapid alignment clean-up method is also clearly relevant in the case
of large-scale or batch-type analyses, where phylogenies
are produced from many potentially large data sets, or in
the case of bioinformatical analyses not tolerant to the
presence of gaps.

Performance of MaxAlign heuristic algorithm
MaxAlign can use one of two different algorithms: a heuristic algorithm (which is faster, but which is not guaranteed to find the best solution), and an optimal algorithm
(which is an adaptation of branch-and-bound; see Methods). We tested both algorithms on the full Pfam dataset.
The average runtime for the heuristic was 0.6 seconds per
alignment (user time) demonstrating that use of MaxAlign is not a bottleneck for data analysis. Among the 5242
alignments, the heuristic algorithm found the optimal
solution in 78% of the alignments. In only 4% of the
alignments, the heuristic algorithm did not find the optimal solution. The remaining alignments either could not
be improved from the start (4%), or the branch and
bound algorithm could not reach a solution in 2 hours
(15% of the alignments). Thus, the heuristic algorithm
found the best solution in 95% of the cases in which a
solution was found. Moreover, analysis of the solutions in
the few cases where the heuristic was not optimal showed
that the alignment area of the heuristic solution was, on
average, 99.0% of the optimal solution (median: 99.6%).
On the whole, we therefore recommend using the heuristic algorithm of MaxAlign.

Results and discussion
Overview
The goal of this tool is to maximize the alignment area,
defined as the number of characters that are present in gap
free columns. Alignment area is thus equal to the number
of sequences included in the alignment times the number
of columns that have no gaps. This maximization of the
alignment area is done by selectively removing sequences
from the alignment. Finding the right sequences to
remove, however, is not a straightforward problem (see
Methods for details on the MaxAlign algorithm).

To scrutinize the performance of MaxAlign, we have analyzed very large sets of protein alignments from two different sources: (1) alignments extracted from the Pfam
database[7], and (2) synthetic alignments created by simulating evolution on a set of three different trees using the
program simprot [8]. The Pfam data were chosen to be
representative of typical, fairly diverged biological alignments, and consisted of all the 5242 alignments from
Pfam-A, release 21.0, that had between 30 and 500

Improving the alignment area
The alignment area of the Pfam alignments was quite variable, with a majority (52.2%) having no gap free columns (and consequently an alignment area of 0). The
average number of gap free columns in the unprocessed
alignments was only 19.4, and the average alignment area
1494 (see table 1). The optimization of alignment area
performed by MaxAlign resulted in a 10-fold increase to
an average alignment area of 16000, corresponding to an
8-fold mean increase of 143.2 gap free columns per alignment, at the average cost of only 19% of the sequences in
the alignment. In a small minority (4%) of the 5242 cases
it was not possible to improve the alignment area by
removing sequences, and MaxAlign therefore had no
effect. Thus, the majority of Pfam alignments were unusable for analyses requiring the elimination of gapped col-

umns and became usable datasets by processing with
MaxAlign.
Removing non-homologous sequences
It is not rare that data sets are contaminated with nonhomologous sequences. These will typically result in the
generation of many gaps when the sequences are aligned.
To investigate how well MaxAlign performs in removal of
such contaminating sequences we therefore constructed a
set of noisy datasets: for each of the 5242 original Pfam
alignments we added random, non-homologous
sequences (taken from other Pfam data sets) such that the
final content of noise was approximately 10%. These datasets were then re-aligned using the program mafft with
default parameters[9]. We then ran MaxAlign (heuristic
algorithm) on the resulting alignments and analyzed the
performance in terms of removal of contaminating
sequences. We found that, taken over all 5242 alignments,
MaxAlign performed very well, removing on average 87%
of the non-homologous sequences per alignment
(median removal success: 96%). In 46% of all cases, MaxAlign was able to remove all non-homologous sequences
from the alignment.
Impact on phylogenetic analysis
Accuracy
It is an unsolved issue in phylogenetic analysis how to
best deal with gaps. We touched upon this topic by investigating how MaxAlign and removal of gapped columns
interfere with phylogenetic tree inference. To do so, we
first simulated 1000 alignments along each of 3 trees of
different shapes. From each of these synthetic alignments,
we then constructed three derived data sets by (a) removing gapped columns, (b) applying MaxAlign, and (c)
applying MaxAlign and removing gapped columns. For
each of the resulting 12,000 synthetic alignments (3,000
original plus 9,000 derived ones), we then performed
maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis using the program phyml. The accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction
was then analyzed by calculating the normalized symmetric tree similarity (see Methods) between the true tree
(used to simulate the alignments) on one hand, and the
four trees estimated by phylogenetic analysis on the other.
These tree similarities were computed based on the subset
of taxa shared by the original and maxaligned datasets.

For the trees inferred from the original (simulated) alignment and from the original alignment excluding gaps, we
also computed the similarity to the true tree based on the
full set of taxa. The outcome of this comparison can be
found both in figure 1 and table 2.
When measuring phylogenetic accuracy on the subset of
taxa that remain after MaxAlign processing, it can be seen
that the highest phylogenetic accuracy was achieved by
using all the sequences available without discarding
gapped columns (figure 1, all rows but 2nd and last). However, it can also be seen that applying MaxAlign decreases
the accuracy only very slightly (figure 1, compare "Original" and "MaxAlign"). Moreover, if one decides to discard
columns with gaps, then using MaxAlign is clearly the best
option (figure 1, compare "Removed Gaps" with "MaxAlign Removed Gaps").
If the accuracy of trees (based on non-MaxAligned data) is
measured on the full set of taxa, then a different trend is
apparent: especially in trees 1 and 2, it can be seen that
processing the alignment with MaxAlign increases the
accuracy of the phylogeny (figure 1, accuracy on full set of
taxa is shown in bottom two rows; compare "Original
Whole Tree" to "MaxAlign"). The reason for this phenomenon is that MaxAlign predominantly removes sequences
with many gaps. These will necessarily also be the ones
having the fewest amino acids, and therefore the ones
associated with the highest phylogenetic uncertainty. It is
important to note that in phylogenetic analyses that measure support for each branch, such as Bayesian analysis or
Bootstrap, the position of these taxa would show up with
low support values. It should also be noted that the presence of gaps in some sequences does not seem to disturb
phylogenetic inference on the remaining sequences (figure 1, compare "Original" to "Original Whole Tree"). It
should be noted that we have not investigated the additional impact of alignment error on this, since we directly
use the simulated (and therefore perfect) alignments
themselves.
Computation time
One reason for discarding gapped columns is that summing over all possible missing values is a time consuming
step in a maximum likelihood calculation. We have evaluated how much time is saved by using MaxAlign with
and without discarding columns with gaps. The results are
presented in table 3.

It can be seen that either using MaxAlign or removing columns with gaps nearly halves the computer time needed
to find the phylogenetic tree. Removing columns with
gaps does so by preventing the summation over unknown
characters as well as reducing the number of sites to be
included in the analysis. MaxAlign diminishes the

Accuracy in phylogenetic inference
Accuracy in phylogenetic inference. Comparison of phylogenetic accuracy obtained with different data sets. Accuracy is
measured as tree similarity between the true tree (used for simulating the data set) and the reconstructed tree. Each line
shows the distribution of the accuracy results from 1000 different data sets, in the form of a box plot. The box has lines at the
lower quartile, median and upper quartile. The whiskers extend from each quartile to the most extreme values within 1.5
times the interquartile range. Outliers falling outside this range are marked with dots. The datasets are in the same order (from
top to bottom) as in table 2: The top two rows show the original dataset without and with removal of gapped columns, respectively. The third and fourth rows show the equivalent MaxAlign datasets. The trees in the top four rows are being evaluated on
the subset of sequences shared by all data sets ("Subset"), while the lower two rows show the results for original datasets
when evaluated on the full set of sequences ("All").

number of summations required and also reduces the size
of the dataset, by including fewer sequences.
The computer time required for these phylogenetic analyses was particularly short, as we used a very fast program
(phyml), and the alignments contained few sequences. In
situations using more time-consuming analyses and software, as well as larger alignments, these relative differences in computing time will have an increased impact.

Conclusion
In the present work, we have shown how MaxAlign is
helpful in "cleaning up" big alignments, and demonstrated how it may be used in connection with phyloge-

netic analysis. In the analysis presented above, we found
that the use of MaxAlign more than halved the running
time of the analysis even when gapped columns were not
excluded. When gapped columns were discarded from the
alignment, the output was of much higher quality if MaxAlign was first used to pre-process the data, as the number
of columns included in the analysis increased immensely.
We have also shown that in the conditions tested, the
accuracy of the phylogenetic estimate of the tree topology
increases if one includes the gapped columns. The
sequences removed by MaxAlign were predominantly
those associated with the highest degree of uncertainty
regarding their placement in the final trees.

Runtimes of the phylogenetic analysis. All times measured in minutes. Both application of MaxAlign and removal of gapped columns resulted in
strongly decreased runtimes.

The use of MaxAlign prior to bioinformatical and phylogenetic analyses optimizes the number of nucleotides or
amino acids present in ungapped alignment columns (the
"alignment area"), thereby increasing the amount of useful data and/or the speed of the analysis. Moreover, MaxAlign is also very helpful in detecting misaligned or
defective sequences without requiring manual inspection.
Given its very short running times and ease of use, it can
without difficulty be used as a step in both automated and
manual phylogenetic and bioinformatical analyses.

Methods
MaxAlign
MaxAlign maximizes the alignment area of an alignment
by removing selected sequences. It has two algorithms to
do so: one heuristic and one branch-and-bound. Both are
based on the concept of gap pattern. In the example align-

ment shown in figure 2, one can see that the first three columns have the same gap pattern, namely the presence of
gaps in the first two lines (corresponding to sequences A
and B). All columns sharing that gap pattern would yield
ungapped columns if sequences A and B were removed.
For every gap pattern there is therefore a set of sequences
requiring removal to produce ungapped columns. The
heuristic algorithm works by first determining the
sequence set for each gap pattern and then iteratively
removing the set of sequences that most increases the
alignment area per sequence removed, until it reaches the
solution with the highest absolute alignment area (shown
in figure 2b). The heuristic algorithm is always used in
MaxAlign. The branch-and-bound algorithm, which is
guaranteed to find the best possible solution at the
expense of a longer running time, can optionally be used
to check if the heuristic algorithm has found the optimal
solution.
MaxAlign has several additional features. For example, it
is possible to select a subset of sequences that should be
kept in the final alignment, even if their removal would
yield an improvement of the alignment area. This is done
by simply adding a plus sign ("+") in front of the sequence
name in the fasta file. In this way, the user can preserve
key sequences in his/her analysis. Also, users interested in
codon-based analyses can run MaxAlign on protein
sequences and obtain their output alignments both in
protein and nucleotide format (as long as they also provide the corresponding nucleotide sequences).

alignment (a), only the three middle columns would be
included in a subsequent analysis (alignment area = 3 rows ×
7 columns = 21). The first three columns have the same gap
pattern. After MaxAlign processing (b) (resulting in removal
of sequences A and B) only the last two columns would be
excluded by having gaps (alignment area = 5 rows × 6 columns = 30).

The server is freely accessible at [10] where a stand-alone
Perl version can also be downloaded free of charge [see
Additional file 1]. The input to MaxAlign is an alignment
in fasta format (two in the case of codon-based analyses).
The main output is an alignment (in fasta format) consisting of the set of sequences that maximizes the alignment
area. The program also lists the sequences that were
included and excluded from the original alignment, and
furthermore provides a report on the resulting improvement.

Description of the simulated alignments used for testing the accuracy of phylogenetic inference with MaxAlign and removal of gapped columns, as
well as the Pfam estimates used to tune the simulation parameters.

Improving Alignment area
To test the relevance of MaxAlign in real biological problems, the Pfam-A Release 21.0 of full alignments [7] was
used. All the 5242 alignments comprising between 30 to
500 sequences were submitted to MaxAlign. The mean
number of sequences in this set of alignments was 140
(median:90). The alignment area and number of
ungapped columns was recorded, before and after MaxAlign. In this analysis, as in all of the following unless otherwise stated, the heuristic algorithm was used.
Removal of non-homologous sequences
To test the ability of MaxAlign in removing non-homologous sequences from an alignment, we added noise
sequences to each of the 5242 above-mentioned Pfam
alignments in a ratio of 1:10. Thus, the alignments ended
up containing between 33 to 550 sequences. These alignments were submitted to MaxAlign and the fraction of
noise sequences removed was recorded. For each alignment, non-homologous sequences were chosen randomly
from the rest of Pfam.
Impact on phylogenetic analysis
Accuracy
To test the impact of MaxAlign in phylogenetic analyses, a
set of benchmarking phylogenetic analyses was set up. To
be certain of the true tree topology, we simulated alignments along known trees, using simprot [8]. To ensure
these alignments were similar to biological alignments,
we estimated several parameters from the Pfam alignments having between 30 and 100 sequences (a total of
2416). Specifically, we estimated the mean length of
sequences (with and without gaps), the distributions of
both length and number of the indels, and the gamma
shape parameter on the distribution of evolutionary rates
among sites (by performing a pre-phylogenetic analysis
on each of these alignments). Parameters in simprot were
then tuned in order to obtain similar distributions and
statistics on the simulated alignments. Specifically simulations were performed using the following parameter set-

tings: -r 180 -g 0.01 -b 4 -c 0.2 -t 2 -x 1.8. For each tree,
1000 alignments were simulated (data on the simulated
alignments is shown in table 4).
The 3 trees chosen to generate the simulated alignments
had very different kinds of topology, and were downloaded from the TreeFam database[11]. Tree 1 was
TF101002, a 32-taxa tree of Cyclin A, with evolution
occurring mostly near the tips; Tree 2 was TF101523, a 33taxa tree of the Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3,
subunit 6 interacting protein, with evolution occurring
throughout the tree; Tree 3 was TF105969, a 46-taxa tree
of the tumour rejection antigen gp96, with evolution
occurring mostly at the base of the tree (see figure 3).
Each simulated alignment gave rise to 4 derived datasets:
the alignment after processing with MaxAlign, but keeping the gapped columns, the alignment after processing
with MaxAlign and removal of gapped columns, the original alignment with the gapped columns removed and the
original alignment without any processing.
These datasets were then used as the basis for reconstructing the tree topology. This was done by using phyml [12]
with the WAG substitution model and having the evolutionary rate among sites modelled by a gamma distribution discretized into 4 categories, with the shape
parameter being estimated from the data. The tree topologies found were then compared among the different
datasets, using Normalized Symmetric Tree Similarity (see
below). As MaxAlign removes sequences from the alignment, the resulting trees have a smaller set of leaves. We
therefore compared the correct tree against the four tree
topologies resulting from the phylogenetic analyses using
only the subset of taxa that remained after MaxAlign
processing. For the two trees based on data that had not
been processed by MaxAlign, we furthermore compared
to the true tree using the full set of taxa. Statistical significance of differences between similarities was assessed
using a double-sided t-test at 5%.

Computation time
All Pfam alignments having between 30–100 sequences (a
total of 2416) were included in this analysis, which consisted of measuring the average duration of phylogenetic
analyses, in a way very similar to the one described above,
apart from using real alignments instead of simulated
alignments (same dataset generation, same phylogenetic
analysis). We did not analyze computation time on the
original datasets (those not processed by MaxAlign) with
removal of gapped columns, as the majority of these
alignments had zero columns available for the analysis.
Comparing the two MaxAlign algorithms
To compare the performance of the two algorithms available in MaxAlign, we applied them to the full set of 5242
Pfam alignments described above and evaluated the solutions in terms of time spent and changes in alignment
area.
Normalized Symmetric Tree Similarity
The degree ofdissimilarity between two phylogenetic trees
can be quantified using a number of different measures of
tree distance. The most widely used measures are probably the symmetric distance[13], the quartets distance [14],
and the branch score distance [15]. The two former measures focus on tree topology, while the latter also uses
branch length information. Here, we propose a simple
measure of (topological) tree similarity that is based on

the symmetric distance of Robinson and Foulds, and that
can be used to compare tree similarities measured on different sets of taxa.
Any branch in a phylogenetic tree can be thought of as
defining a bipartition where the leaves are divided into
those present on one side of the branch and those present
on the other side of the branch. The symmetric distance of
Robinson and Foulds is simply the number of bipartitions
(branches) in tree 1 that are not present in tree 2 plus the
number of bipartitions in tree 2 that are not present in tree
1. This is an intuitively understandable measure of treedissimilarity that is fairly rapid to compute.
We now propose a normalized version of this distance
measure: simply divide the symmetric distance between
two trees by the total number of bipartitions present in
the two trees. (The total number of bipartitions in the two
trees is used for normalization since it is the maximum
possible symmetric distance). This "Normalized Symmetric Distance" is zero when trees are identical and 1.0 when
they have absolutely no bipartitions in common. From
the Normalized Symmetric Distance (NSD), the corresponding "Normalized Symmetric Similarity" (NSS) can
be computed simply as NSS = 1.0 – NSD. This similarity
measure is 1.0 for identical trees and zero for trees without
any common bipartitions.
