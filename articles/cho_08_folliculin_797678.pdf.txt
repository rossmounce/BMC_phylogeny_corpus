Abstract
Background: Rare loss-of-function folliculin (FLCN) mutations are the genetic cause of Birt-HoggDubé syndrome, a monogenic disorder characterized by spontaneous pneumothorax,
fibrofolliculomas, and kidney tumors. Loss-of-function folliculin mutations have also been described
in pedigrees with familial spontaneous pneumothorax. Because the majority of patients with
folliculin mutations have radiographic evidence of pulmonary cysts, folliculin has been hypothesized
to contribute to the development of emphysema.
To determine whether folliculin sequence variants are risk factors for severe COPD, we genotyped
seven previously reported Birt-Hogg-Dubé or familial spontaneous pneumothorax associated
folliculin mutations in 152 severe COPD probands participating in the Boston Early-Onset COPD
Study. We performed bidirectional resequencing of all 14 folliculin exons in a subset of 41 probands
and subsequently genotyped four identified variants in an independent sample of345 COPD
subjects from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (cases) and 420 male smokers with normal
lung function from the Normative Aging Study (controls).
Results: None of the seven previously reported Birt-Hogg-Dubé or familial spontaneous
pneumothorax mutations were observed in the 152 severe, early-onset COPD probands. Exon
resequencing identified 31 variants, including two non-synonymous polymorphisms and two
common non-coding polymorphisms. No significant association was observed for any of these four
variants with presence of COPD or emphysema-related phenotypes.
Conclusion: Genetic variation in folliculin does not appear to be a major risk factor for severe
COPD. These data suggest that familial spontaneous pneumothorax and COPD have distinct
genetic causes, despite some overlap in radiographic characteristics.

Background
Rare mutations in the folliculin gene (FLCN) have been
implicated in two genetic syndromes with shared pulmo-

nary manifestations of spontaneous pneumothorax and
lung cyst formation: Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD,
MIM 135150) and familial spontaneous pneumothorax

(FSP, MIM 173600)[1]. BHD is a rare autosomal dominant monogenic disorder characterized by follicular
hamartomas, renal tumors, and spontaneous pneumothorax, with an age-adjusted odds ratio of pneumothorax of
50 compared to unaffected family members[2]. FSP –
defined as idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax clustering in families in the absence of other pulmonary or systemic disease (including BHD) – is estimated to account
for up to 11.5% of all cases of spontaneous pneumothorax; autosomal dominant and X-linked patterns of inheritance have been described [3,4]. Rare, loss-of-function
mutations in the folliculin gene have been found in both
BHD and FSP without other BHD manifestations, suggesting a shared molecular etiology; the latter cases may also
represent undetected cases of BHD[5]. In total, more than
30 folliculin truncating frameshift, nonsense, or splice site
mutations have been found[6-18].
BHD- and FSP-associated folliculin mutations confer distinct clinical and histopathologic pulmonary manifestations, including recurrent, idiopathic pneumothoraces
(typically at a young age of onset)[3,2,7,19] and numerous parenchymal lung cysts in atypical locations (extraapical locations as compared to predominantly apical
locations observed in idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax)[8,7,20,12]. Familial clustering of recurrent pneumothorax is common in both conditions (and defines
FSP), and several radiographic surveys of asymptomatic
related family members carrying folliculin mutations
have confirmed a high frequency of lung cysts. For example, in one extended family with FSP, all 13 folliculin
mutation carriers had cysts on chest CT, though only 5
had a history of pneumothorax[8]. Similarly, in 198 BHD
subjects who underwent chest CT, 177 (89%) had one or
more lung cysts, though the prevalence of pneumothorax
was only 24%[19].
While these cystic changes are radiographically distinct
from common forms of emphysema, increasing severity
of folliculin-associated cystic changes are correlated with
cigarette smoking[21]. In addition, emphysema has been

reported in lung resection specimens from non-smokers
with folliculin mutations and FSP[7]. Some have speculated that folliculin – perhaps by regulating processes of
lung growth, or altering inflammation or matrix degradation and remodelling – may also be involved in the pathogenesis of generalized, more common forms of
COPD[8,7]. We sought to test this hypothesis by characterizing the spectrum of folliculin variation in a cohort of
patients with severe, early-onset COPD (nearly all with
emphysema[22]) and by testing several common folliculin variants for association with lung function and emphysema in an independent case-control study.

Results
Baseline characteristics for the cohorts are presented in
Table 1. There was a notable female predominance in the
Boston Early-Onset COPD Study cohort, as previously
reported[23]. The EOCOPD patients had lower lung function than the NETT subjects, despite being substantially
younger and reporting fewer pack-years of smoking history. Predictably, NETT subjects had significantly more
pack-years of smoking and had lower lung function (p <
0.0001) than NAS subjects.
We first assessed whether folliculin mutations known to
cause either BHD or FSP were observed among 152
EOCOPD probands. We genotyped 7 previously reported
folliculin mutations, of which 2 have been observed only
in FSP patients, 4 have been observed only in patients
with BHD-associated pneumothorax or BHD-associated
lung cysts, and 1 has been reported in both conditions
(Table 2). None of these mutations were observed in any
of the severe, early-onset COPD probands, suggesting that
these rare variants confer distinct clinical phenotypes of
BHD or FSH but do not commonly cause severe, earlyonset COPD.
Although these highly penetrant mutations appear to confer distinct phenotypes of BHD and FSP but not severe
COPD, it is possible that other folliculin variants could
contribute to the development of EOCOPD through more

subtle impact on folliculin function. To test this hypothesis, we resequenced the coding and surrounding genomic
regions (13 kb total coverage) of the folliculin locus in 41
EOCOPD probands (82 chromosomes) to identify potential COPD-related variation. 31 folliculin variants were
identified (Figure 1 and Table 3). Several relevant observations emerged from this effort. First, of the 31 identified
variants (see Table 3) none corresponded to known BHD
or FSP mutations[6-18]. Second, all 31 variants identified
in the EOCOPD probands were single base-pair changes –
no insertions or deletions were observed – in contrast to
the spectrum of genetic variation reported in BHD and
FSP which includes insertions and deletions. Third, in
contrast to the deleterious effects of the variants described
in BHD and FSP, none of the variants observed in the
EOCOPD probands would be expected to have significant
functional impact. Only two non-synonymous variants
were seen: a C to T transition at c.1333 (rs41419545) in
folliculin isoform 1 [GenBank:NM_144997] resulting in a
substitution of alanine for threonine at codon 445
(p.Ala445Thr – observed once); and another C to T transition at c.871+36 (rs3744124), resulting in a substitution
of glycine to arginine at codon 303 in folliculin isoform 2
([GenBank:NM_144606]; p.Gly303Arg – observed four
times). Neither of these variants were predicted to have
significant functional impact based on PolyPhen analysis[24]. Moreover, although the coding regions of the folliculin gene are highly conserved across vertebrate species
(average PhastCons score for coding exons of 0.91), both
of these coding variants were situated in regions with poor

local conservation – neither rs41419545 nor rs3744124
was conserved across 17 vertebral species (base-pair
PhastCons scores of 0 for both, see Figure 2). Of the
remaining 29 non-coding variants, 6 mapped to transcript
– including 2 synonymous variants and 4 mapping to the
5' untranslated region (UTR) – 23 mapped to intronic
sequence, and 1 was situated upstream of the gene. Aside
from the two synonymous variants (which by definition
do not alter protein structure), all of the identified variants, including those in the 5'UTR, mapped to regions of
low conservation (PhastCons score ~0 for all).
Our resequencing results suggest that COPD is not caused
by rare, severely deleterious folliculin variants. However,
several more common variants were identified that
mapped to the folliculin transcript, raising the possibility
that folliculin variants with more subtle functional impact
may contribute to COPD pathogenesis. To assess this possibility, we genotyped four variants that mapped to the
folliculin transcript – the two nonsynonymous variants
(rs3744124 and rs41419545) and two common 5' UTR
variants (rs1708629 and rs1736209) – in 345 NETT subjects and 420 NAS controls and tested for evidence of
genetic association with the presence or absence of
COPD. We also performed population-based association
analysis of quantitative emphysema phenotypes within
NETT COPD cases. All variants were in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium in the NAS controls. In keeping with the
sequence analysis above, none of these four variants was
associated with COPD susceptibility or emphysema phe-

and healthy smoking controls (Table 4). In addition, there
was no association for any of the variants with four measures of emphysema severity and distribution in the NETT
cases: radiologist-determined upper lobe emphysema predominance, radiologist-determined overall emphysema
severity, quantitative difference between apical and basilar emphysema (% of lung < 950 HU) and total percentage of affected lung < -950 HU (data not shown).
Additional association testing under recessive and dominant models did not change these results.

Discussion
The function of the folliculin gene is unknown. Evidence
to date suggests its function as a tumor suppressor[25-28]
possibly through the mTOR pathway[29,30]. While these
studies help elucidate the pathways by which folliculin

mutations lead to tumorigenesis, the role of folliculin in
the lung is much less clear. However, high prevalence of
atypical lung cyst formation among carriers of rare folliculin mutations (89%–100%), together with evidence of
folliculin expression in lung macrophages, lung fibroblasts, and type I pneumocytes [26], has led to speculation
that folliculin plays an important role in establishing or
maintaining extracellular matrix and pulmonary parenchymal integrity. It has been hypothesized that folliculin
may contribute to the development of emphysema and
COPD in the general population[7,8]. We sought to
address this question by characterizing the spectrum of
folliculin sequence variation in a cohort of patients with
severe early-onset COPD and in a case-control study of
cases with severe emphysema and control smokers with
normal spirometry. Using a variety of approaches including rare-variant screening, variation discovery, and genetic
association testing of common variation, we found no evi-

ciation was found between four common folliculin variants with either COPD susceptibility or emphysema
distribution or severity.
Despite our comprehensive evaluation, we must emphasize the difficulty in making definitive statements regarding lack of association in genetic association studies,
particularly in the context of rare sequence variants. Traditionally designed association analyses may be unable to
detect association for rare variants that confer modest
genetic effects due to inadequate statistical power [31,32].
In addition, rare variants may be limited to a specific ethnic group[33]; our subjects were nearly all Caucasian.
While we recognize that our sample size is relatively modest, it is comparable in size to the aforementioned BHD
cohorts [19]. By sampling 82 chromosomes, our detection
rate for a variant of 5% frequency was > 99%[34]. Moreover, given the very high penetrance of lung cyst formation
among folliculin mutation carriers, our cohort was of sufficient size to detect mutation carriers if mutations of similar effect were commonly associated with COPD. In
addition, for a common variant (allele frequency of 30%)
we had > 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.4. We
also note that our cohort of severe, early-onset COPD
(EOCOPD) probands represents an extreme form of the
COPD spectrum and is thus more likely to be enriched for
functional rare genetic variation that influences lung
structure and function [35-37]. Absence of functional folliculin mutations in this cohort suggests that similar variation is not likely present in less severe forms of COPD.
Another important challenge in studies of rare genetic variation is the extent of genetic coverage. While we recognize that we did not screen for all known BHD mutations,
our survey was comprehensive in that our genotyping coverage included those mutations that explain the bulk of
BHD and FSP cases[9,5]. With regard to our survey of
common genetic variation, though we only genotyped
four variants, we note that it is unlikely that we failed to
capture occult structural variation given the paucity of
coding variation identified during our resequencing
efforts. The folliculin locus demonstrates very strong phylogenetic conservation across mammalian species, which
suggests that the folliculin locus could be under purifying
selection, reducing the population prevalence of deleterious mutations in general, particularly common variation.
Thus, while we cannot exclude the possibility that
untested variants of very modest effect may influence
COPD susceptibility, our results exclude the folliculin
locus as a major determinant of severe COPD in the general population.
Though much of the attention in the study of complex
traits like COPD has focused on the contribution of common sequence variation, there is increasing realization

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/120

that rare sequence variants may also explain a substantial
proportion of the genetic risk, particularly in subjects with
extreme phenotypic manifestations[36]. In addition to
the well-documented role of alpha-1 antitrypsin as a rare
genetic risk factor for COPD, we have recently described a
rare functional mutation in the terminal exon of the elastin gene that segregates with disease status in a family of
severe early-onset COPD and was observed in 1.25% of
subjects participating in the NETT Genetics Ancillary
Study as compared to 0.55% in the NAS cohort[37].
Though these early studies support an important contribution of rare variants to the genetic architecture of
COPD, more comprehensive surveys of large numbers of
genes will be required to clarify their role. With the advent
of a new generation of high-throughput sequencing platforms, such analyses will soon be feasible and will ultimately provide new insights into the pathogenesis of
COPD.

Conclusion
Folliculin has been hypothesized to play a role in emphysema, and rare folliculin mutations have been associated
with cyst formation and spontaneous pneumothorax.
However, genetic variation in folliculin does not appear to
be a major risk factor for severe COPD. These data suggest
that familial spontaneous pneumothorax and COPD have
distinct genetic causes, despite some overlap in radiographic characteristics.

Methods
Details of subject recruitment and phenotyping in the
Boston Early-Onset COPD Study (EOCOPD), the
National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), and the
Normative Aging Study (NAS) have been reported previously [38-41]. Probands in the Boston Early-Onset COPD
Study had physician-diagnosed COPD, FEV1 < 40% predicted[42], age < 53 years, and no severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. NETT participants had physiciandiagnosed COPD, FEV1 ≤ 45% predicted[42], evidence of
hyperinflation on pulmonary function testing, and bilateral emphysema on CT scan. None of the NETT subjects
included in our study had severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. NAS controls were healthy men recruited through
the Veterans Administration (VA) of Greater Boston[40]
with at least 10 pack years of cigarette smoking, without
airflow obstruction (FEV1 > 80% predicted[43] and FEV1/
FVC > 90% predicted[42]). The NETT and NAS participants were all Caucasian; two of the Boston Early-Onset
COPD Study probands included in this study were African-American.
Participants in the Boston Early-Onset COPD Study and
the NETT Genetics Ancillary study gave written informed
consent. Anonymized data were used for the NAS participants, as approved by the Partners Healthcare Human

Research Committee and the IRB of the VA Hospitals. The
appropriate institutional review boards approved all studies.
Seven BHD- or FSP-related folliculin mutations – including three reported in FSP, and the two most common
mutations in BHD – were genotyped in 152 Boston EarlyOnset COPD Study probands (Table 2). Bidirectional
resequencing of the folliculin gene was performed in 41
EOCOPD probands. Selected variants were genotyped in
345 NETT subjects and 420 NAS controls. Additional
details of genotyping and sequencing methods are available Additional file 1. Evolutionary conservation was
assessed at single nucleotides and with 20 bp of surrounding sequence using the 17-way phastCons score[44] available through the UCSC genome browser (http://
genome.ucsc.edu; March 2006 assembly).
Statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Baseline characteristics in NETT versus
NAS and NETT versus EOCOPD subjects were compared
using Fisher's exact or Wilcoxon test, as appropriate.
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed in control subjects using an exact test. Genotype frequencies were compared using Fisher's exact test. In the NETT cohort, four CT
emphysema phenotypes were analyzed. Two were based
on radiologist assessments: 1) upper lobe emphysema
predominance and 2) overall emphysema severity on a
scale of 0 to 24. Two were quantitative scores using a cutoff of -950 Hounsfield Units: 1) the difference between
apical and basilar emphysema and 2) the total percentage
of affected lung. The upper lobe and apical/basilar phenotypes were chosen based on the extra-apical predominance of folliculin associated lung cysts. The quantitative
densitometric phenotypes were added due to reported
interobserver variability in CT phenotypes[22]. All four
phenotypes were analyzed under an additive genetic
model in univariate analysis and in a multivariate analysis
adjusting for age, sex, post-bronchodilator FEV1 % predicted, and pack-years of cigarette smoking. Power calculations for discovery of novel exonic variants were
performed using the exact binomial in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), for 82 independent chromosomes. Power
calculations for genotyping in NETT and NAS were performed using Quanto[45], under a log-additive model.
