Abstract
Background: The phylogenetic position of the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii ) is particularly relevant to study the
evolution of genes and gene regulation in vertebrates. Here we examine the evolution of Dlx homeobox gene
regulation during vertebrate embryonic development with a particular focus on the forebrain. We first identified the
elephant shark sequence orthologous to the URE2 cis -regulatory element of the mouse Dlx1/Dlx2 locus (herein named
CmURE2). We then conducted a comparative study of the sequence and enhancer activity of CmURE2 with that of
orthologous regulatory sequences from zebrafish and mouse.
Results: The CmURE2 sequence shows a high percentage of identity with its mouse and zebrafish counterparts but is
overall more similar to mouse URE2 (MmURE2) than to zebrafish URE2 (DrURE2). In transgenic zebrafish and mouse
embryos, CmURE2 displayed enhancer activity in the forebrain that overlapped with that of DrURE2 and MmURE2.
However, we detected notable differences in the activity of the three sequences in the diencephalon. Outside of the
forebrain, CmURE2 shows enhancer activity in areas such as the pharyngeal arches and dorsal root ganglia where its'
counterparts are also active.
Conclusions: Our transgenic assays show that part of the URE2 enhancer activity is conserved throughout jawed
vertebrates but also that new characteristics have evolved in the different groups. Our study demonstrates that the
elephant shark is a useful outgroup to study the evolution of regulatory mechanisms in vertebrates and to address how
changes in the sequence of cis -regulatory elements translate into changes in their regulatory activity.
Background
Changes in gene expression patterns, via changes in cis regulatory elements, or in the trans -acting factors binding to these elements, has contributed to the development of novel morphological structures during evolution
[1]. The high degree of conservation in the coding region
of genes necessary to establish the animal body plan has
been extensively documented. The growing wealth of
metazoan genome sequence data has also provided evidence for the conservation of sequences outside the coding regions of genes, the Conserved Non-coding
Elements (CNEs) that tend to be located close to developmental genes [2,3]. However, whether the conservation of

CNE sequence is necessary for any conservation of CNE
regulatory activity remains debateable. Recent studies
have identified regulatory sequences with very little
sequence conservation that have the ability to activate
transcription in highly similar tissues [4-7]. Furthermore,
highly conserved regulatory sequences can drive transcription in highly divergent patterns [8-10]. Therefore, it
remains challenging to predict regulatory activity based
solely upon sequence similarity, or vice versa. Currently, a
great effort has been made in systematically characterizing the CNEs in the mouse genome allowing for comparison with other model and non-model organisms [11].
Dlx homeobox genes of vertebrates are involved in the
development of the forebrain, visceral arches, sensory
organs, and limbs [12]. They are organized as three convergently transcribed bigene clusters, present in most

jawed vertebrates: Dlx1/Dlx2 , Dlx3/Dlx4 and Dlx5/Dlx6
[13]. The three bigene clusters most likely originate from
the duplications of an ancestral bigene cluster occurring
as whole genome duplication events throughout vertebrate evolution [14]. A similar bigene arrangement of Dlx
genes has been reported in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis
[15], suggesting that the ancestral bigene existed prior to
vertebrate radiation. The bigene organization of Dlx
genes appears to be important for the concerted expression of the two genes within each cluster as cis -regulatory elements (CREs) have been identified in the
relatively short (~3-15 kb) intergenic regions separating
the two genes of each cluster [16,17].
Of the six Dlx genes found in tetrapod vertebrates, the
Dlx1/Dlx2 and Dlx5/Dlx6 clusters are involved in forebrain development. We have previously reported three
CREs from the intergenic regions of these two bigene
clusters in mouse: I12b from the Dlx1/Dlx2 locus and
I56i and I56ii from the Dlx5/Dlx6 locus [16,17]. However,
CREs regulating Dlx expression can also be found outside
the intergenic region and we reported one such CRE
named Upstream regulatory element 2 (URE2), located
approximately 12 kb upstream of the mouse Dlx1 gene
[18]. We have previously shown some degree of conservation in the function of some Dlx CREs between mouse
and zebrafish but it is not clear when these CREs and
their associated regulatory mechanisms originated during vertebrate evolution [16,17].
As a cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii ) occupies an interesting phylogenetic
position as the sister group to bony fishes and tetrapods.
Its relatively small genome of 910 Mbp and the availability of a low coverage genome (~1.4 ×) make this species a
useful cartilaginous fish model to examine conservation
of CREs [19]. Large scale comparison of the conserved
non-coding regions between the elephant shark and the
human and/or zebrafish genomes has revealed that more
CNEs are shared between human and elephant shark
than between human and zebrafish [19,20]. These data
are consistent with the observation of greater conservation in gene synteny between human and elephant shark
genomes than between human and zebrafish genomes
[19]. This may seem counterintuitive given that mammals
share a more recent common ancestor with teleost fishes
than with cartilaginous fishes. However, this situation
likely results from the 'fish-specific' whole genome duplication event that occurred before the teleost radiation
and led to loss or modification of CNEs and a high level
of genome re-organization in this group [19,21]. Detailed
analysis of the conservation of CNEs associated with the
Hox clusters in the elephant shark, human, and fugu
yielded various hypotheses on the possible correlation
between the level of sequence conservation of vertebrate
CNEs and their functional variation [21].

Here, we report the identification of an elephant shark
sequence orthologous to the conserved regulatory element URE2 associated with Dlx1 and Dlx2 genes.
Sequence comparisons show a high level of conservation
within gnathostomes, with higher similarity between elephant shark and mouse URE2 than between elephant
shark and zebrafish URE2. We show that the enhancer
activity of the elephant shark URE2 (CmURE2) in transgenic mouse and zebrafish is highly similar to that of its
orthologous mouse and zebrafish counterparts in transgenic assays. In addition, CmURE2 shows more similarity
in sequence and function to the orthologous mouse
sequence than to the zebrafish sequence, in agreement
with the hypothesis of additional genome and gene regulation remodelling due to the subsequent teleost specific
genome duplication.

Results
Sequence and synteny conservation near the Dlx1/Dlx2
bigene cluster

The Dlx genes of most tetrapod vertebrates described
thus far are organized as three Dlx bigene clusters. As a
result of the whole genome duplication event occurring
in ancestral teleost fish, several other dlx genes have been
identified in zebrafish; (i) an additional dlx1a/dlx2a bigene cluster located on chromosome 9, and (ii) a dlx2 related gene, dlx2b , located on chromosome 1, which is
not physically linked to a dlx1 -like gene [22,23]. Conserved synteny between the dlx -containing regions of
zebrafish chromosomes 1 and 9 supports the hypothesis
that dlx1a/dlx2a and dlx2b arose from the duplication of
a large chromosomal region, followed by the loss of the
dlx1 -like gene from the b cluster. Furthermore, the synteny is also conserved with a region of mouse chromosome 2 that contains the nearby genes ITGA6 , Metapl1
and Hat1 (Figure 1). The presence of CREs within these
genomic regions may contribute to the conservation of
these synteny blocks [24-26]. In the mouse, the MmURE2
CRE, previously reported to be involved in Dlx1/Dlx2
regulation and located 12 kb upstream of Dlx1 , falls
within the sixth intron of the Metapl1 gene [18]. This
conserved sequence is able to drive reporter expression in
the mouse forebrain [11,18,27]. In zebrafish, DrURE2 is
located in a similar position upstream of the dlx1a gene
but the unique metapl1 ortholog is found in synteny with
dlx2b on chromosome 1. No URE2-like sequence can be
identified on zebrafish chromosome 1 (see synteny
description at [28]) which rules out the possibility of a
URE2 enhancer--like sequence acting on the metapl1
gene and suggests that the remaining dlx2b gene is not
under the regulation of a URE2 sequence, except if the
sequence has been highly remodelled after the duplication while still retaining its function. This, as well as the
loss of other regulatory elements associated with the

Figure 1 The Dlx1/Dlx2 bigene cluster in vertebrate evolution. Vertebrate phylogeny indicates the hypothesized position of the three genome
duplication events (2R, 3R). The chromosomal neighbourhood of Dlx1/Dlx2 in mouse and zebrafish presents the relative position of flanking genes
and of URE2. In the mouse, URE2 falls within intron 6 of the Metapl1 gene. Synteny information is not yet available for the elephant shark although the
presence of the Dlx1 and Dlx2 genes on the same BAC clone as URE2 has been confirmed. Drawings are not to scale.

dlx1a-dlx2a bigene cluster [17], may account for the
reduced domains of expression in comparison to dlx2a
[29,30].
To investigate the corresponding genomic region in a
cartilaginous fish species, we searched the elephant shark
genome for Dlx - and URE2-like sequences. We found
independent reads including putative CmDlx1, CmDlx2,
CmMetapl1, CmURE2 as well as CmI12a, a second Dlx1/
Dlx2 regulatory element. After screening a BAC library
for the putative CmDlx1 sequence, we isolated a BAC
clone from which we could also PCR-amplify CmDlx2,
the two putative enhancer sequences, CmURE2 and
CmI12a, and exons 9 and 10 of the CmMetapl1 gene (Figure 1).
We produced an alignment of the elephant shark,
mouse, and zebrafish URE2 sequences (1017 bp, Figure
2), approximately half of which could be aligned with no
ambiguity (517 bp). The CmURE2 sequence closely
resembles its mouse and zebrafish counterparts (Figure
2) with 85% identity between MmURE2 and CmURE2,
75% identity between MmURE2 and DrURE2, and 73%
identity between DrURE2 and CmURE2. We then aligned
the orthologous URE2 sequences extracted from the
Ensembl Genome Browser (release 56, [31]) for three
other tetrapod species (a frog, Xenopus tropicalis ; a lizard, Anolis carolinensis ; a bird, Gallus gallus ) and three
other teleost species (the medaka, Oryzias latipes ; and
two pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis ) (Additional File 1). Again, the elephant shark
URE2 sequence was significantly (t-test; p < 0.05) more

similar to tetrapod sequences (mean: 82.5%) than to
teleost sequences (mean: 71.5%). When testing for relative substitution rates with the elephant shark as an outgroup, the null hypothesis of equivalent substitution rates
could be confidently rejected (p = 0) when comparing
zebrafish and mouse URE2 sequences or medaka and
Xenopus URE2. In both cases a higher substitution rates
was obtained in teleosts compared to tetrapods. These
results strongly suggest that the elephant shark sequence
is more similar to tetrapod sequences than to teleost
sequences, most probably due to higher mutation rates in
the latter clade.
The elephant shark URE2 sequence acts as a forebrain
regulatory element in transgenic zebrafish and mice

To determine if the CmURE2 sequence can act as a regulatory element and to compare its activity with its
zebrafish and mouse counterparts, we prepared a series
of reporter constructs in which the URE2 sequences are
placed upstream of a cassette containing a β-globin minimal promoter and either the GFP or lacZ reporter gene.
The resulting constructs were tested in both transgenic
(Tg) zebrafish and mice.
In zebrafish, the Tg-DrURE2 drove GFP expression in
the telencephalon and diencephalon starting at approximately 24 hpf (Figure 3A). This expression was observed
in two independent lines of transgenic zebrafish and persisted until 96 hpf (Figure 3B-F), a time where GFP
expression was also noted weakly in the pharyngeal
arches (Figure 3E, F). Similarly, the CmURE2 sequence

targeted GFP expression to the forebrain of zebrafish
embryos and larvae from 24 hpf until at least 96 hpf (Figure 3G-3K), with pharyngeal arch expression of the
reporter transgene observed at the later time points in
two independent transgenic lines (Figure 3K, L). Overall,
the examination of live embryos indicated that the spatial
distribution of the GFP protein was generally similar for
both constructs suggesting similar activities for the elephant shark and zebrafish sequences in the brain and visceral arches (Table 1). One site of Tg-CmURE2 activity
that is not observed with Tg-DrURE2, and is not consistent with endogenous dlx1a or dlx2a expression, is the
somites at 2 dpf (Figure 3H, black arrowhead) continuing
until at least 4 dpf (Figure 3L).
We then examined the activity of the URE2 elements in
the forebrain in greater detail and compared this with the
endogenous expression of the zebrafish dlx1a/2a genes.
The endogenous dlx expression domains correspond to
the subpallium of the telencephalon and to specific
regions of the diencephalon (preoptic area, prethalamus,
and hypothalamus) (Figure 4A-C) [30]. Comparative in

situ hybridization analysis of the GFP transcripts identifies highly comparable expression with endogenous dlx2a
(Figure 4A, B) and GFP in Tg-DrURE2 embryos (Figure
4D, E). However differences in transgene expression
could be pointed in the Tg-CmURE2 line with no apparent detection of GFP expression in the prethalamus, as
well as very restricted expression in the hypothalamus
(Figure 4H, I). Anti-GFP immunohistochemistry on sections of transgenic embryos confirmed that the prethalamus expression was completely absent from Tg-CmURE2
embryos, while expression in the pre-optic area is comparable between Tg-CmURE2 and Tg-DrURE2 (Figure 4F,
J). More posterior in the hypothalamus, the transgene
was expressed only in a restricted lateral domain in the
Tg-CmURE2 transgenic line, while the GFP expression
domain was larger in the Tg-DrURE2 line (Figure 4G, K).
Immuno-localization of the GFP in these two lines also
allowed us to detect GFP in the muscles associated to the
visceral arches, as well as muscles in the tail (data not
shown), consistent with the fluorescence patterns
described in Figure 3. Examination of primary transgenic

zebrafish obtained with a similar construct containing the
mouse MmURE2 sequence indicates that it behaves similarly to its elephant shark and zebrafish counterparts with
expression in the telencephalic and diencephalic domains
(Additional File 2). Notably, the transgene could also be
detected in visceral arches at 5 dpf, in a pattern similar to
that observed for Tg-DrURE2 and Tg-CmURE2 (Additional File 2C).

Similar constructs using LacZ as the reporter gene were

Summary of reporter gene expression patterns under regulation by the zebrafish, elephant shark or mouse URE2 sequences (respectively TgDrURE2, Tg-CmURE2, Tg-MmURE2) in zebrafish embryos staged from 1 to 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) in case of stable transgenic lines, 2 to 4
dpf in case of primary transgenic expression (Tg-MmURE2) and in mouse embryos aged E11.5 (one stable transgenic line for Tg-MmURE2,
primary transgenic expression for Tg-DrURE2 and Tg-CmURE2).

the forebrain, the mouse and elephant shark URE2
sequences showed more similarities in their activities
compared to zebrafish URE2: both CmURE2 and
MmURE2 could target expression to the dorsal root ganglia in primary transgenic embryos (CmURE2-lacZ, n =
1/5; Additional File 3) or in two independent transgenic
lines (MmURE2-lacZ, Figure 5A and 19). The DrURE2lacZ transgene was not expressed in the dorsal root ganglia (n = 0/4). The mouse URE2 element was the only one
able to target expression to the branchial arches and to
the apical ectodermal ridge of limb buds.

Discussion
Locus and sequence conservation among jawed
vertebrates

In this study we identify a conserved regulatory region
associated with Dlx genes in the elephant shark. Conserved synteny could not be precisely determined
because the elephant shark genome is not assembled.
However, the sequence identified as CmURE2 is located
on the BAC clone containing the elephant shark Dlx1 ,
Dlx2 and Metapl1 genes, similar to what is observed in all
other jawed vertebrates for which genomic data are available (Ensembl Release 56, [31]). The putative conservation of the bigene cluster organisation between bony
vertebrates and cartilaginous fish is consistent with the
hypothesis that an ancestral chordate bigene cluster has
been duplicated twice before the radiation of jawed vertebrates [32,33]. The identification of a URE2 sequence in
vicinity of the elephant shark Dlx1 and Dlx2 genes also
indicates this locus was linked to these genes in the
ancestor of all jawed vertebrates. A search for sequences

orthologous to this URE2 enhancer in species outside of
jawed vertebrates did not yield any significant hit with the
BLASTn tool from the NCBI sequence browser [34] or
the BLAT tool in the UCSC genome browser [35] on the
lamprey (Petromyzon marinus ), tunicate (Ciona intestinalis ) or lancelet (Branchiostoma floridae ) genomes,
even though Dlx genes have been identified in these
organisms and bigene Dlx tandems are present in lamprey and tunicate [15,33,36]. The high level of URE2
sequence conservation observed in jawed vertebrates
suggests that it has evolved under high evolutionary constraints and that its enhancer activity likely emerged in
the jawed vertebrate ancestor, after divergence of the
cyclostomes, i.e., more than 400 Myrs ago. Interestingly,
this reflects the trend observed for a number of other vertebrate CNEs [5].
Enhancer activity, conservation, and variation

The most prominent expression domain of a transgene
under the regulation of MmURE2 or DrURE2 has been
shown to be the forebrain, more precisely in the ventral
telencephalon and diencephalon, in agreement with the
pattern of endogenous expression of Dlx1 and Dlx2 genes
[17]. Both zebrafish transgenic lines obtained with
DrURE2 and CmURE2 driving expression of GFP produced comparable expression patterns, suggesting the
regulatory activity of these orthologous sequences in
developing forebrain and visceral arches is likely to be
conserved. This overall conservation of the enhancer
activity, along with a high level of identity between the
two sequences, implicates conservation of transcription
binding sites allowing the CmURE2 to retain activity in

mRNA (D, E) and GFP proteins (F) is not observed in Tg-CmURE2 (H-J). Expression of GFP in the hypothalamus (black arrowhead) was restricted to

sections presented in F-G and J-K are localized on the scheme in panel C. Blue domains in the scheme are the forebrain expression domains described
for dlx genes: the telencephalic domain being the subpallium (sp, black arrow); the diencephalic domains being the preoptic area (po), prethalamus
(pt, white arrowhead) and hypothalamus (hy, black arrowhead). Scale bars: A, B, D, E, H, I, 250 μm; F, G, J, K, 50 μm.

the developing zebrafish and mouse brain. The results
obtained with the DrURE2 transgenic zebrafish lines
show that the activity of this enhancer recapitulates part
of the dlx1a/dlx2a endogenous expression pattern in the
forebrain. Similarly MmURE2 transgenic mouse lines
recapitulate endogenous Dlx1/Dlx2 expression in this
domain [18]. Thus, the conservation of URE2 regulatory
sequences correlates with conservation of their activity.
However, differences could be identified in the diencephalic expression domains (prethalamus and hypothalamus) between the two transgenic lines. These
discrepancies suggest that while the overall activity is
conserved, the URE2 enhancer also shows some degree of
modularity across the vertebrate phylogeny. Accordingly,
the differences between CmURE2 and DrURE2
sequences could account for the differential expression
pattern in the prethalamus and hypothalamus between
different vertebrate species, whereas these sequence differences do not modify the enhancer activity in the telencephalon. In turn, these results suggest that these two
Dlx gene expression domains (telencephalon and dien-

cephalon), even though both regulated by a unique functional URE2 enhancer, are perhaps the result of two
distinct genetic pathways.
The DrURE2 and CmURE2 sequences also drive
expression in the developing telencephalon and diencephalon of transgenic mice, a pattern comparable to the
endogenous MmURE2 enhancer. Again, this highlights
the conservation of the regulatory cascade leading to Dlx
gene expression in the developing forebrain of mice. In
this species, the function of URE2 in the forebrain seems
to be completely conserved despite variation in the
sequences, which highly contrasts with our results from
transgenic assays in zebrafish where expression in the
diencephalon seems to be sensitive to sequence variations. Our results suggest that a distinct genetic pathway
is specifically involved in teleost diencephalon development that would not be shared with mouse. This new
pathway could have emerged after the additional genome
duplication event occurring before teleosts radiation,
which seeded many paralogous developmental genes that
have the potential to be co-opted (or recruited) as new

independent upstream signals interacting with the
zebrafish URE2 enhancer. However, we cannot rule out
the possibility that subtle changes in zebrafish transcription factor binding specificity may account for the apparent divergence of the CmURE2 enhancer function in the
zebrafish forebrain, compared to the mouse forebrain.
The URE2 sequences studied here are also able to drive
expression in the developing branchial arches. More specifically, the MmURE2 can drive expression in the hyoid
arch mesenchyme in transgenic mice, while DrURE2 and
CmURE2 did not produce any branchial signal in our primary transgenic embryos. DrURE2 and CmURE2, and
possibly MmURE2, were able to drive GFP expression in
muscles of the growing mandible and of the posteriormost visceral arches in transgenic zebrafish. The GFP fluorescence pattern obtained in zebrafish visceral arches
(mandible and branchial arches shows expression in the
muscles associated with the arches, rather than expres-

sion in the chondrogenic mesenchyme, where the dlx
genes are known to be transcribed [37]. This expression
pattern is unlikely to be an insertion artefact because it
could be observed in two independent insertions for both
DrURE2 and CmURE2 transgenic lines. GFP expression
in arches muscles could be the result of endogenous
URE2 activity that was not reported in previous studies
on dlx gene expression patterns [37]. Alternatively, detection of GFP in these muscle cells could be the result of
GFP stability in cell lineages derived from cells where dlx
genes are endogenously transcribed.
Lineage-specific modifications may account for the differences observed in the branchial arches between mouse
and zebrafish, such as the mammal-specific loss or
teleost-specific gain of upstream signal targeting in the
visceral arch mesenchyme. These hypotheses could be
tested by biochemical and molecular techniques comparing the ability of different activators from the different

MacDonald et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:157

lineages to enhance expression in response to these signals on the orthologous CREs. In this respect, it will be
interesting to characterize the various transcription factors that interact with the MmURE2 sequence and contribute to expression in the brain or visceral arches. In
mouse assays, the Tg-MmURE2 and Tg-CmURE2
sequences were able to consistently drive expression not
only in the developing brain, but also in the dorsal root
ganglia. None of the Tg-DrURE2 primary embryos (n =
0/4) had expression in these structures, suggesting that
MmURE2 and CmURE2 share some enhancer activity
that has been lost by DrURE2 consistent with absence of
dlx1a/dlx2a expression in dorsal root ganglia.
URE2 evolution in vertebrates

As no expression data is available from the elephant
shark, we cannot correlate the CmURE2 enhancer activity to the endogenous Dlx1 and Dlx2 expression patterns.
It is therefore difficult to propose an overview of the evolution of the URE2 enhancer in vertebrates. However, our
results show that the genomic organisation of the Dlx1/
Dlx2 bigene cluster with a URE2 sequence in the vicinity
is conserved amongst all jawed vertebrates. The three
URE2 sequences coming either from a cartilaginous fish
(the elephant shark), a teleost fish (the zebrafish), or a tetrapod (the mouse) are able to drive expression in the forebrain with apparent complete robustness. These results
highlight the strong selective constraint that may have
acted against the modification of the regulatory
sequences and the trans -activating protein domains,
which interact with these enhancers, during jawed vertebrate evolution. However our results also show that
URE2 enhancer activity in visceral arches and diencephalon is only partially conserved and has accumulated evolutionary modifications leading to variations from one
organism to another. In particular, the lack of regulatory
activity of CmURE2 and DrURE2 in the visceral arches of
the mouse could be the result of lineage-specific
sequence modification in transcription factor binding
sites during tetrapod evolution, possibly leading to modifications of the regulatory cascade involving the URE2Dlx1 -Dlx2 module in the branchial arches.

Conclusions
As a chondrychtyan, the elephant shark provides a useful
model to carry out comparative studies with jawed vertebrates to evaluate the relative contributions of changes in
coding sequences and in CREs, These changes may have
lead to morphological innovations, such as the tripartite
brain and branchial arches of jawed vertebrates. The use
of the elephant shark had been limited to comparative
DNA sequence analysis [21]. Here, we have shown that
CREs from the elephant shark can be successfully tested
in teleost and tetrapod experimental models. Whereas

transgenes with elephant shark CREs cannot yet be tested
endogenously, as transgenesis in this species has yet to be
developed, it may be possible to obtain gene expression
data in elephant shark for comparative purposes. Such
expression studies would further increase the usefulness
of the elephant shark in evolutionary developmental biology as an outgroup of bony vertebrates (zebrafish and
mouse) showing not only a conserved genome structure
but also, as highlighted here, conserved gene regulatory
mechanisms.

Methods
Sequence identification and manipulation

The sequence of the previously identified regulatory
sequence URE2 from the mouse was blasted against the
1.4 × coverage survey-sequencing data of the elephant
shark genome [38]. One significant hit allowed us to identify the homologous sequence to the mouse URE2
(MmURE2) in the elephant shark genome (CmURE2). A
BAC from the elephant shark genome library
(IMCB_Eshark BAC library) was isolated by 3-step PCR
screening of the pooled BAC DNA using primers for the
elephant shark Dlx1 gene (CTCCTCTCCCTTTCAGCAGCAG and ATTACCTGTGTCTGTGTGAGTCC).
This BAC was used as a template for PCR with primers
designed for Dlx2 gene (GAGAAATGCCGACAGATCAGCTC and CCACCATAGGCTGATGTTGTATG)
and the CmURE2 enhancer (AAAGCTCCAGAATTCTTATTCA and GTCTGCTGGTTTATGGTAAAG) and
the Metapl gene (exons 9/10: GCTCGAACTGGGCTGATCTA and TGGACAGCAATTTCCAATGA: exon 7:
AATGGACTGCAAGTTTGCCC and GCAGCCCTTATCCAGTAGAA) that were hypothesized to be in a
region of conserved synteny with the URE2 sequence in
other vertebrate genomes (Figure 1).
Orthologous URE2 sequences were retrieved from the
Ensembl genome browser (release 56) by blast with the
zebrafish URE2 sequence (DrURE2) against the genome
of seven other species: mouse, Mus musculus ; chicken,
Gallus gallus ; anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis ; xenopus,
Xenopus tropicalis ; medaka, Oryzias latipes ; fugu Takifugu rubripes ; Tetraodon Tetraodon nigroviridis. The
sequences were first aligned with ClustalW implemented
in BioEdit and the alignment was then refined by eye
(total 1097 nucleotidic sites, see Suppl. Figure 1) [39]. In a
zebrafish/mouse/elephant shark sequences comparison,
we defined by eye the unambiguously aligned regions
within the alignment of the three sequences (see Figure 2,
final 578 bp). Percentages of identity were calculated and
conserved regions were identified by BioEdit software
(minimum segment length, 10 bp; gaps limited to 2 by
segment and only 2 consecutive gaps allowed). In the
comparisons of all nine species, only positions with gaps
were excluded (final 705 bp) before the percentages of

MacDonald et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:157
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/157

identity were calculated between two sequences or before
relative substitution rate tests were evaluated with the
MEGA software [40].
Transgene constructs

For transgenic zebrafish, the URE2 element was inserted
into the multiple cloning site of a vector that contained a
β-globin minimal promoter-GFP cassette. The URE2
sequence is located immediately upstream of the βglobin-GFP fragment and the resulting URE2-β-globinGFP DNA fragment is flanked at both ends by Tol2
recombinase recognition sequences [41]. For transgenic
mice, the URE2 element was inserted into the multiple
cloning site of the p1230 construct [42] Microinjection of
transgene constructs into fertilized mouse eggs and production of transgenic mice were carried out as previously
described [16]. For the production of transgenic
zebrafish, approximately 125 ng of a tol2 transposase
mRNA synthesized in vitro with 50 ng/ml of DNA construct was co-injected along with the transgene constructs into fertilized zebrafish embryos at the one-cell
stage. At least two independent lines of transgenic
zebrafish were produced, unless otherwise indicated.
Animals

Zebrafish were raised at 28°C under a 14:10 hour lightdark cycle as previously described [43]. All animal manipulations were preformed according to guidelines from the
Canadian Council for Animal Care.
In situ hybridization

Zebrafish for RNA in situ hybridizations and fluorescence imaging were treated with 0.0015% 1-phenyl 2thiourea (PTU) to inhibit melanogenesis. Whole mount
in situ hybridizations were carried out following previously described protocol with digoxygenin-labelled
cRNA probes synthesized on previously described templates dlx2a [29] and gfp [44]. Coloration was achieved
with Nitro-Blue Tetrazolium Chloride (NBT) and 5Bromo-4-Chloro-3'Indolyphosphate P-Toluidine Salt
(BCIP) solution [45].
Microscopy and Immunohistochemistry

Whole mount images were taken on a Nikon NBZ 1500
dissecting microscope with a Nikon DXM 1200 C digital
camera. Immunohistochemistry was carried out as previously described [17], on cryosections at a thickness of 10
μm. Primary antibody: Rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, Invitrogen, A-11122). Secondary antibodies: Goat anti-rabbit
Alexa Fluor488 (1:300, Invitrogen, A11008). Signals were
visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E3600 stereomicroscope for
fluorescent stains.
