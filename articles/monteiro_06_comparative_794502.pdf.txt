Abstract
Background: Butterfly and moth eyespots can share a similar appearance, involving multiple concentric
rings of colored scales, but usually occuring in non-homologous positions on the wing. Within the
butterflies, on the other hand, spots that share the same homologous position may not share the
concentric ring structure; and, in butterfly species that have eyespots with concentric rings, ectopic
eyespots with a similar ring structure can be induced by means of a simple epidermal wound. The extent
to which all these eyespots, natural or induced, share similar genes and developmental mechanisms is
investigated here by means of protein in-situ localizations in selected butterfly and moth species. In
addition to looking at some of the transcription factors previously identified as being involved in eyespot
formation, we also tested the involvement of candidate genes from the Wingless and TGF-β signaling
pathways as putative morphogens for eyespot development.
Results: Saturniid moth and nymphalid butterfly eyespots with concentric rings of color express at least
two transcription factors, Distal-less and Engrailed, in the center of the future pattern. Nymphalid eyespots
centers also express the ligand Wingless and an activated signal transducer, a phosphorylated Smad
protein, but neither these proteins nor the previous two proteins are found in pierid spot centers, which
consist of a single patch of color. Both butterfly wing patterns, however, express a third transcription
factor, Spalt, a portion of whose expression domain maps to the black scales on the adult wing. Wounding
a nymphalid wing, on the other hand, leads to upregulation of Distal-less, engrailed and spalt in subsets of
cells around the wounding site, mimicking concentric eyespot development.
Conclusion: Wingless and TGF-β ligands are both candidate morphogens involved in nymphalid butterfly
eyespot formation. These eyespots, as well as saturniid moth eyespots with concentric circles, share two
genes that are associated with the differentiation of the signaling cells in nymphalid eyespots. This
commonality suggests that they may be produced via the same developmental mechanism despite their
non-homologous location. By contrast, pierid butterfly spots of a single color share some of the same
genes but appear to be produced by a different mechanism. Eyespots with concentric rings may have coopted a wound healing genetic network during their evolution.

Background

morphogen [7-9], or where different concentric rings of
cells act as new sources of morphogens through a cell
relay system [10] have also been proposed for the border
eyespots.

The wings of butterflies and moths display a wealth of
color patterns that provide excellent material for investigating the evolution of pattern formation in a simple,
two-dimensional system. Pattern elements consisting of
one or more concentric rings of colored scales, the eyespots, can occur at different positions in the wing in different lineages and also display different morphologies and,
thus, make intriguing subjects for investigating questions
of homology [1]. When eyespots appear in moth lineages
they are usually found as a single element in each wing
surface, straddling a cross vein in the center of the wing.
These are called the discal-cell eyespots [2]. In members of
the superfamilies Bombycoidea, Drepanoidea and
Geometrodeia, which are closely related to the butterfly
superfamily Papilionoidea, eyespots also appear along the
border of the wing, in the space between two veins [3].
These border eyespots, common in several butterfly families, are part of one of the three anterior-posterior bands
of pattern symmetry, the "distal symmetry system", as
described for the Nymphalid Groundplan (NGP)[2].
Whereas many eyespots in moths and butterflies display a
central pupil and several rings of concentric colors, some
"eyespots" consist of patches of a single color. The extent
to which discal-cell eyespots are homologous to border
eyespots and to which single colored spots are homologous to eyespots with concentric rings remain largely
unknown and is here the focus of our investigation.

The sink model, in particular, is derived from the observation that eyespot mimics, containing rings of differently
colored scales but no central white pupil, can differentiate
on the wing following pupal epidermal wounding [7-9].
The wound was thus interpreted as a "sink" for a widely
distributed morphogen. The effects of wounding in altering butterfly wing scale coloration have been investigated
in different moth and butterfly species [7-9,11-14]. In all
cases, there is a specific time period during pupal development when wounding of the wing epidermis will alter the
fate of the color scales in an area surrounding the wound
site. In most cases, the altered patch of cells is circular in
shape and centered on the puncture site. In addition,
punctures performed in different areas of the wing can
result in ectopic eyespots of different sizes or different
colors [9,11,12,15,16]. In Bicyclus anynana (Lepidoptera,
Nymphalidae), ectopic eyespots consisting of a ring of
gold scales, sometimes containing a black central disc,
appear on the adult wing following pupal wing wounding
[7]. The genes involved in the differentiation of these
ectopic coloration patterns have not been investigated
and, thus, it is unclear whether natural eyespots and
ectopic eyespots are using the same genetic circuitry.

Ideally, tests of homology should include not only comparisons at the level of the phenotype but also of the genes
and developmental processes underlying that phenotype
[4,5]. This type of homology is usually referred to as
"process homology" [5]. The idea is that similar morphologies at non-homologous positions may be the result of
homologous genes and developmental mechanisms that
have been co-opted to novel locations, or alternatively,
the result of disparate developmental processes that have
converged on a similar morphology. In this study homology between structures will be examined at each of these
levels. Below we briefly review what is known about eyespot development and introduce the candidate genes that
will be used in our comparative study.

A series of genes have been associated with nymphalid
eyespot development. In the larval stage, Distal-less (Dll),
Notch (N), engrailed (en), hedgehog (hh), cubitus interruptus
(ci), patched (patch), spalt (sal) (Craig Brunetti, personal
communication) appear to be involved in the differentiation of the central signaling cells [17-19]. Later, in the
early pupal stage, three of these early transcription factors
are expressed again in a subset of epidermal cells, the
scale-building cells, and appear to map to the adult eyespot color rings: Dll and Sal mapping to the black scales,
and En to the gold ring of scales [20,21]. The identity of
the signal that is produced in the focal cells that triggers
the expression of these transcription factors is not yet
known.

Research on eyespot developmental mechanisms has
mostly focused on the border eyespots of nymphalid butterflies. Two and a half decades ago, Nijhout proposed
that a group of signaling cells, the focus, organizes the differentiation of butterfly eyespot patterns by producing a
long range diffusible morphogen that is interpreted in a
threshold-like fashion by the surrounding epidermal cells
[6]. When the focus is transplanted to a different location
of the wing, an eyespot pattern differentiates in the surrounding host tissue [6,7]. Other subsequent models,
where the focus acts as a "sink" for a broadly distributed

Here we investigate whether the Wingless (Wg) and Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways
are involved in differentiating the border eyespots, as the
ligands in these pathways are known morphogens in
other systems (reviewed in [22]). Using immunohistolocalization, we target the Wg ligand, and a phosphorylated
form of a signal transducer from the TGF-β pathway,
pSmad, as well as three of the previously described transcription factors Dll, En and Sal. We look at these proteins
throughout the late larval and early pupal stages of the
butterfly B. anynana. We also follow the expression of

these proteins around wound sites in the pupal wing to
determine the extent to which ectopic eyespots share
developmental pathways with normal eyespots. Finally,
we compare gene expression patterns in the discal-cell
eyespots of the moth species Antheraea polyphemus and
Saturnia pavonia (both Lepidoptera, Saturniidae) and in
the uniformly-colored, non-pupilated, spots of the cabbage white butterfly Pieris rapae, from a more basal butterfly family (Lepidoptera, Pieridae), to determine to what
extent they are sharing similar developmental pathways.

Results
wg and pSmad are both expressed in B. anynana border
eyespots during the early pupal wing stage
Stainings for Wg and pSmad, performed during the late
fifth larval instar, showed expression along the wing margin but no expression in the focal cells (Fig. 1A &2A).
Stainings performed in the early pupal wing, however,
show that Wg (Fig. 1C) and pSmad (Fig. 2C) are both
present in the eyespot field. At later pupal stages, when the
ring of en-expressing scale-building cells is visible around
the eyespot focus (Fig. 1F &2F), Wg and pSmad are no
longer visible in the eyespot field (Fig. 1E &2E).

The timing of wg expression varied slightly from individual to individual with expression first visualized in the
eyespot centers at 10.5 h after pupation (earlier wing dissections were difficult to perform) and present until 16 h
after pupation (Fig. 3). During this period there were
dynamic patterns of wg expression. In particular, the high
levels of expression seen in the focus early after pupation
in both fore and hindwings (see Fig. 1C for forewing
expression) decreased relative to levels of background
staining in the hindwing (Fig. 1E,G), slightly later in
development. These lower levels of Wg were not observed
in the forewing, however. After 22 h post pupation, there
was no longer any obvious pattern of wg expression in
both fore and hindwings (Fig. 3).
pSmad expression varied slightly from individual to individual with expression first visualized in the eyespot centers at 9 h after pupation and present until 18 to 21.5 h
after pupation, depending on the individual (Fig. 2C &3).
From 22 h onwards, pSmad was no longer detected in the
eyespot centers (Fig. 2E). At 9 h after pupation, pSmad
was also expressed in small cell clusters spread throughout
the wing epidermis, possibly indicating centers of epidermal wing growth (Fig 2C).Dll, en and sal were all
expressed in the eyespot centers during the late 5th larval
instar (Figs. 3, 4A, Dll staining not shown), but only
began to be expressed in the surrounding scale-building
cells later after pupation (at 12 h to 20 h), possibly
responding directly to levels of one or both of the putative
morphogens proposed here.

black spots of pigmentation (Fig. 5C–E, Fig. 4A). This was
concluded after more than 50 forewings were analyzed,
sampling from the last larval, crawler, and pre-pupal
stages. Note, however, that En is present along two intervenous stripes in the wing sectors that later carry the black
spots. In the pupal wings of these butterflies there was also
no visible cluster of cells expressing pSmad or wg in the
future spot centers shortly after pupation. Although we
performed pupal stainings with the collection of antibodies targeting the proteins mentioned above, Sal was the
only protein investigated that mapped to the adult spots
(5F-I), whereas Dll was expressed in the intervenous
stripes (Fig. 5J). Sal was visible in scale-building cells from
as early as 13.5 h after pupation till 27 h after pupation
(subsequent developmental times were not investigated).
Sal was also present in scale-building cells along the black
tip region of the wing during the same time periods investigated (Fig. 5K).

the eyespot center (arrowhead) at 18 h after pupation,
whereas en expression (F) extends to a ring pattern of scalebuilding cells surrounding the focus (200×).

Only sal and pSmad are expressed in the region of P.

pSmad and wg were expressed along the wing margin of P.
rapae (Fig. 5A,B) but unlike B. anynana, P. rapae larval
wings do not appear to have a differentiated cluster of
cells expressing Dll, en, and sal at the center of the future

Gene expression after pupal wing wounding
Wounding the pupal wing led to the production of gold
scales or ectopic eyespots around the site of damage in the
adult wing of B. anynana (Fig. 6A,B). Wounding also led
to the up-regulation of Dll, en, and sal in a subset of epidermal cells, the scale-building cells, several hours (at
least 12.5 h) after wounding (Fig. 6C–E; Fig. 7). From the
cell-specific pattern of expression we interpret these
results as real patterns of up-regulation of these genes in
these cells. In all of the trials we observed either the
expression of en alone in the scale-building cells, or both
Dll+en or sal+en gene combinations expressed simultaneously in the same cells. This indicates that cells that are
going to produce a single pigment later in development
may have an earlier co-expression of more than one of the
"color" transcription factors before putative interactions
between them exclude one of the transcription factors
from the same cell [21]. These specific combinations of
transcription factors are not found in naturally occurring
eyespots of B. anynana but are found in other butterfly
species [21].

In many wings, however, there were no patterns of target
gene expression in association with scale-building cells.
These wings were normally operated and observed before
12 h had elapsed from the time of the operation. Instead
there appeared to be a cluster of non-differentiated cells,
at the site of wound closure that were visibly targeted by
antibodies (Fig. 6F–H). This type of expression, however,
was non-specific because control stainings (only using
mouse secondary antibodies) showed the same pattern
(Fig. 6K,L). Attempts to detect whether cells surrounding
the wound site were producing pSmad and/or Wg, were
fraught with the same problem probably due to some
stickiness of the damaged tissue (Fig. 6I,J), indicating that
our immunohistolocalization method is not optimized to

tissue.
Dll and en are expressed in discal-cell eyespots
Anti-En, and anti-Dll and-En co-stainings performed in
two saturniid moths, A. polyphemus and S. pavonia, respectively, showed that Dll is expressed along the margin (Fig.
8A) and that both Dll and En are present in the center of
the future discal eyespots during the late larval stage, just
before pupation, but 2–3 days after the larva starts spinning its cocoon (Fig. 8). The focal expression of these
genes seems to appear before any cross-vein is visible at
this position (see insets on Fig. 8A–C).

ligand Dpp are known to activate Dll and sal, respectively,
in a concentration dependent fashion [23-25]. For
instance, during wing and leg development in Drosophila,
Dll is responding directly to levels of Wg produced along
the wing margin [23] and to levels of both Wg and Dpp

Discussion

The candidate morphogens wingless and TGF-β ligands
One of the central aims of these experiments was to identify additional proteins for comparative work including
putative morphogens involved in focal signaling and eyespot differentiation, as originally proposed by Nijhout
[6]. Given that we knew the identity of transcription factors that are possibly responding directly to morphogen
levels produced in the focus [20,21], we asked whether
up-stream regulators of these transcription factors were
known in other systems. In Drosophila, Wg and the TGF-β

information to surrounding cells as to their proximity to
the cells releasing the signal (.reviewed in [28]). Also,
these interactions have been shown to be the result of a
morphogen gradient system and not a cell-cell relay system.
Until functional data is collected for Wg and TGF-β family
members, these ligands remain excellent candidates for
association with focal signaling and eyespot differentiation due to their temporal and spatial localization. The
presence of Wg and pSmad along the wing margin and
their absence from the eyespot foci during the larval stage
is in agreement with previous reports for the expression of
wg and decapentaplegic (dpp), a ligand from the TGF-β family, in the nymphalid butterfly Precis coenia using in situ
hybridizations [18]. Both Wg and pSmad, however, were
present in the B. anynana eyespot centers from the early
pupa until around 16–22 h after pupation, a critical developmental period when pupil transplants and ablation
experiments were originally shown to affect the eyespot
phenotype [7]. The genes were then down-regulated after
this point. In our stainings we observed that both pSmad
and Wg appear to be restricted to the area of the focus.
Because biologically active levels of these proteins may be
below the limits of antibody detection, these stainings
should perhaps be viewed as indicating where protein
concentrations are highest.

produced in the imaginal leg disc [26]. sal, on the other
hand, responds directly to levels of Dpp during anteriorposterior axial patterning in the Drosophila wing [27].
These ligands are known to form concentration gradients
around the producing cells and to provide positional

Gene expression at wound sites
The expression of Dll, en, and sal was only observed in
scale-building cells around the wound site from 12 h
onwards after the wounding operation. These patterns of
gene expression mimic the temporal and spatial patterns
of genes expressed around the natural eyespot centers
where Dll, En and Sal only appear in scale-building cells
at least 12 h after pupation (Fig. 3). This temporal delay
between signaling from the focus (or putatively from a
wound) and expression of the genes in scale-building cells
could represent the time that it takes morphogen levels to
build up before response genes can be activated and proteins detected. It remains to be determined whether Dll,
en, and sal could have been up-regulated by any of the two
putative morphogens proposed above, produced at a
wound site. Other studies have linked Dpp and Wg to the
regeneration of damaged tissue in vertebrates [29-31] but
our antibody stainings do not provide conclusive evidence for Wg and pSmad being up-regulated around
wound sites immediately after damage because dying or
non-differentiated cells at these sites appear to bind nonspecifically to antibodies. The expression of Dll, sal and en
in the sub-set of scale-building cells following wounding
is likely to represent a derived feature of butterflies with
eyespots rather than a functional aspect of wound repair
per se. This proposition, however, can only be addressed
by comparative work in wound repair in other parts of the

More than one diamond in the same line represent observations in different individuals that pupated at the same time and were fixed at different

determine whether TGF-β or Wg mRNAs are indeed produced at the wound sites.
Since both Wg and TGF-β have known roles in wound
healing in other systems, their involvement in eyespot
development within the Lepidoptera leads us to speculate
that perhaps eyespot evolution resulted from the genetic

co-option of genes from a wound repair genetic circuitry
in specific regions of the wing, followed or proceeded by
co-option of pigmentation pathways to the end of that circuit. It has been proposed before that eyespots represent
"flat legs" on a wing [18], having resulted from the cooption of the leg developmental program involving the
Dll gene [32]. Our results suggest an alternative to this scenario where eyespots, as well as legs and other appendages, are derived from a putatively more ancestral circuit

involved in tissue repair [33]. Appendages would have coopted and modified the wound repair program in order to
grow tissue outward, whereas butterflies used it to colorpattern the wing.
Eyespot development across species
From our comparative analyses of moth and butterfly eyespots, it appears that border eyespots of nymphalid butterflies and discal-cell eyespots of Saturnid moths share at
least two genes that are associated with the differentiation
of the group of central signaling cells, Dll and en, and may,
therefore, share similar developmental mechanisms. Due
to the small colony of animals reared we did not collect
sufficient additional data to test for the expression of the
remaining genes and were unsuccessful at collecting data
for the pupal stage. Future gene expression studies as well
as experiments involving discal-cell focal grafts or damage
experiments should shed additional light on the underlying developmental mechanisms for these eyespots.

Expression of Dll and En in two saturniid species in
the late larval wings, two to three days after the start
of cocoon spinning. (A) Left and right forewings of Saturnia
pavonia, showing Dll expressed in the margin (red) and also
in future discal-eyespot centers (arrows and insets), together
with En (green insets), two days after the beginning of
cocoon spinning. The black marking next to the Dll- and Enexpressing cells of the left wing appears to be a piece of
debris, whereas the darker spots overlying these same cells
on the right wing appear to be small pieces of trachea. (B)
Hindwing of Saturnia pavonia showing an enlarged focus
expressing Dll and En at the future discal-eyespot center.
Note the absence of a cross vein at this stage. The area
showing double staining in the bottom right sector of the
wing represents a fold of the wing margin over part of the
wing. (C) Hindwing of Antheraea polyphemus three days after
beginning of cocoon spinning showing En present in a line
marking the elongated central axis of the future discal-cell
eyespot. In the pupal stages of both saturniids a cross vein
will appear between M2 and M3, presumably at the position
where En and Dll are expressed (see [42] for venation notation). All panels at 50× and insets at 100×.

In contrast to the border and discal-cell eyespots, the uniformly colored non-pupilated spots of P. rapae seem to be
produced through a different developmental mechanism
that does not involve signaling from the center. The spots
in P. rapae do not appear to have a group of differentiated
cells at their center, i.e., the spots do not express any of the
focal markers (Dll, En and Sal) in the larval wing stage,
and they do not have pSmad or wg expression at their
centers during the early pupal stage. These spots, however,
share the expression of the transcription factor, Sal, which
is associated in both B. anynana and P. rapae with the area
of black scales in the adult wing. In addition, in the late
larval wings of both species, pSmad is first visible along
the wing margin (Fig. 5A). The known activation of sal at
particular threshold levels of pSmad in Drosophila [27] is
suggestive that these two patterns may be causal, i.e., a
putative gradient of a TGF-β protein could be established
at the wing margin in late larval wing development, leading to the putative activation of a band of sal expressing
cells at some distance from the margin in the early pupa.
The restriction of Sal in the Pieris wing to only two spots
along a putative continuous anterior-posterior gradient of
TGB-β signaling may be a result of one of three proposed
mechanisms. First, a series of transcription factors homologous to those patterning the Drosophila wing along the
anterior-posterior axis and positioning the veins [17,34]
may be subdividing the butterfly wing into a series of
genetic domains [35]. These genes could allow for certain
areas of the wing to express sal while repressing it in other
areas. Second, the expression of en in the two intervenous
regions that will later carry the spots could be involved in
restricting sal expression to those sectors of the wing,
either by activating it directly, or by repressing a general sal
repressor distributed more broadly across the wing, and

allowing sal to be expressed in those areas. Thirdly, if sal
has a modular cis-regulatory region where each module is
responsible for the gene's expression in a different anterior-posterior section of the wing, pSmad, in combination
with other regional regulators (for instance the transcription factors involved in vein positioning) may be simultaneously needed to activate one or more sal cis-regulatory
modules along a continuous stripe on the wing.
Homology of eyespot systems
Despite previous morphological examinations having
proposed that the elaborate border eyespots found in
many nymphalids are not homologous to the simple
spots found in other butterfly lineages such as in the
pierids [2,36], an in-depth examination of the underlying
developmental basis of these patterns had not been
attempted. Our data suggest that the two pattern elements
have evolved independently by deploying separate developmental mechanisms, but happen to utilize some of the
same genes, e.g. sal, and perhaps two of the same pre-existing and thus, homologous, gene circuits, e.g. pSmad being
upstream of sal activation, and sal being upstream of black
scale differentiation. These two circuits may also be ancestral to the butterfly-moth lineage split but our current lack
of data for the expression of these genes in the saturniids
does not allow us to examine this proposition. In any
event, because the mechanism of how sal is eventually
activated in the pupal stage in Pieris and Bicyclus scalebuilding cells is proposed to be different for each system
(Fig. 9B,C): either due to a threshold response to a gradient of a TGF-β ligand diffusing from a central group of signaling cells, or from a gradient expressed along the entire
wing, that turns on sal in selective quadrants along the
anterior-posterior axis, the two spots should not be considered homologous at the level of developmental mechanisms.

In the case of the saturniid and nymphalid eyespots with
concentric rings it appears that both these patterns have a
differentiated focus that expresses similar transcription
factors (e.g., En and Dll), that could lead to a similar focus
signaling mechanism, but whether the systems have independently evolved in their non-homologous positions by
the co-option of an ancestral focus gene circuit into a
novel position (as represented in Fig. 9E), or retained similar mechanisms throughout Lepidoptera evolution that
merely shifted in location is still unclear. Only a broad
sampling across several more butterfly and moth lineages,
including those that appear to have both a discal-cell eyespot and border eyespots, will be able to shed light on this
issue. In any event, and with the current data, we propose
that these two spots are "process homologous" at the levels of genes and developmental mechanism.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/6/52

Our mapping of the co-option of a Dll and en gene circuit
and the appearance of discal-cell eyespots at the base of
the tree (Fig. 9E), rather than within the saturniid lineage,
is not the most parsimonious reconstruction for the data
analyzed here. We chose this location for two reasons.
First, many other moth lineages, as well as pierids (e.g.
Colias sp.), display these discal-cell eyespots, making their
appearance at the base of the tree more parsimonious.
Second, it was previously shown that Dll is also expressed
at a discal-cell location in a nymphalid butterfly [37].
Denser species sampling, however, is also needed to conclusively resolve this issue.
The genetic circuitry involved in nymphalid eyespot production, with its putative signaling ligands (Wg and TGFβs) and several response genes (Dll, en and sal) may, at
least in part, have been co-opted from the wound repair
genetic circuitry, as the two developmental processes
share many temporal and genetic similarities. Future work
on wound healing across a broader range of species
should help verify this hypothesis.

Conclusion
We propose that both Wingless and TGF-β are involved in
signaling from the future eyespot centers in nymphalid
butterflies and directly or indirectly activating the expression of response genes such as Dll, sal, and en in concentric rings of cells surrounding the focal cells. We also
propose that saturniid moth and nymphalid butterfly eyespots are sharing a similar developmental mechanism
despite their non-homologous position on the wing,
whereas pierid and nymphalid border spots appear to be
produced through non-homologous developmental processes, despite sharing a homologous position and some of
the same genes and putative gene circuits. The genetic
basis for the development of all eyespots with concentric
circles may have been co-opted from a wound healing
genetic mechanism.

Methods
B. anynana were reared at 27°C and 80% humidity in a
12:12 light:dark cycle. P. rapae were reared at 25°C in a
chamber with no humidity control with a 16:8 light:dark
cycle. S. pavonia were reared in sleeve cages outdoors, and
A. polyphemus were reared at room temperature indoors
(20°C). Pupation times for P. rapae and B. anynana were
scored by means of time-lapse photography with a Kodak
290 digital camera, inside the 27°C and 80% humidity
environmental chamber. The time-lapse was set to take
pictures every 30 minutes with a time stamp on each
photo. We dissected roughly 200 pairs of pupal wings and
100 larval wings from B. anynana, 60 pairs of pupal forewings and 50 larval forewings from Pieris, 12 larval wings
from S. pavonia and 80 larval wings from A. polyphemus.
Larval and pupal wings were fixed and stained following

Model for nymphalid eyespot and pierid spot development, and evolutionary hypothesis of spot/eyespot evolution. (A) During the late larval stage, Dll and Notch are expressed in several intervenous stripes (purple) midway between the
wing veins in both B. anynana and P. rapae butterflies, but only a sub-set of wing cells express these and several other genes in
enlarged foci at the end of those stripes, including sal (dark green; forewing represented here where only two foci differentiate). PSmad (red) is also present along the wing margin; B) In the early stages of pupal development, pSmad (red) is expressed
in the future eyespot centers of B. anynana, but not in the spot centers of P. rapae. A gradient of this protein, however, may be
present along the proximal-distal axis of the wing, being established from the marginal expression of TGF-β ligands in the late
larval wings. This gradient could display a similar range of concentrations along bands spanning the anterior-posterior axis of
the wing (red dashed lines); C) Later in pupal development while in B. anynana sal (light green) responds to pSmad levels generated from focal signaling, in P. rapae, sal is responding to particular pSmad levels expressed along the anterior-posterior axis
(see text for further explanation of spot pattern). (D) The expression of sal determines where black scales will develop on the
adult wing in both species. (E). Phylogenetic tree depicting a member from each lepidopteran family studied. The appearance of
novel (non-homologous) features are depicted on the tree. These features can represent a novel phenotype, a novel gene
expression pattern, or a novel gene circuit (see text for description). Note that additional information was used to map the
origin of the discal-cell eyespots at the base of the tree, rather than in the branch representing the saturniid lineage, which
would have been more parsimonious (see text).

the protocol in reference [21]. We used a double-staining
procedure for most wings with a mouse anti-En (4F11, 1:5
dilution [38]) for all preparations combined with either
rabbit anti-Dll (1:200 dilution [39]), rabbit anti-Phosphorylated-SMAD1 (Ps1 [40]) named here pSmad at
1:150 dilution), rabbit anti-Sal (1:500 dilution [41]) and
goat anti-Wg (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology
#SC-6280). The pSmad antibody specifically recognizes
the phosphorylated form of the Smad protein and has
been successfully used in vertebrates and in Drosophila.,
thus serving as an indicator of TGF-β activity on the butterfly wing. The Wg polyclonal antibody was developed
against a conserved epitope in the region between amino
acids 25–75 of the Human Wnt-1 protein (Swiss-Prot
#P04628, GenBank #X03072). The epitope is proprietary
and therefore only a range of amino acids was provided
for where the epitope is located. In this 50 a.a. region there
is 35.3% identity among amino acids when compared to
Bombyx mori, the closest species with a fully sequenced wg
gene. Within the same region there is a smaller group of
12 amino acids (#64–75) that have 75% identity with the
Bombyx sequence. We used Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse
with either Alexa Fluor 594 anti-goat or Texas-Red antirabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes catalogue
numbers A-11001, A-11058 and T-2767). Wings were
mounted on glass slides in Slow Fade medium (Molecular
Probes catalogue #S-7461), covered with a glass coverslip,
sealed with clear nail polish, and stored at -20°C until
observation under FITC and Texas Red filters on a Leica
DMIRE II microscope at 50X, 100X and 200X magnifications.
In order to induce a wound and healing response we
pierced individual pupal wings at one or two of three different sites with a fine tungsten needle (World Precision
Instruments, catalogue #501317). Operations were performed between 5 h and 20 h after pupation (AP), covering the time period where most ectopic eyespots are
produced, between 12 h and 18 h AP [9]. Pupae were
punctured under a dissection microscope and the puncture depth ranged between 2 and 3 millimeters. Wings
were dissected at a variable period after the operation and
stained according to the protocols above.

Images shown represent the best specimens for each treatment but similar patterns were observed in at least 3 other
specimens of each species, and often many more. Control
stainings were also performed for all the developmental
stages of Pieris and Bicyclus using combinations of secondary antibodies only. These stainings, apart from the ones
mentioned explicitly in the text in the context of the
wound healing experiments, yielded very dark preparations with no particular patterns of fluorescence.
