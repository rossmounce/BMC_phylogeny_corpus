Abstract
Background: Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) has an increasing rate in Turkey. The reason remains largely
unknown. A better understanding of the demographic and microbial characteristics of EPTB in the Turkish
population would extend the knowledgebase of EPTB and allow us to develop better strategies to control
tuberculosis (TB).
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated clinical and laboratory data of 397 bacteriologically-confirmed TB cases
diagnosed during an eight year-period using by chi-square analysis and multivariate logistic regression model.
Results: Of the 397 study patients, 103 (25.9%) had EPTB and 294 (74.1%) had pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The
most commonly seen two types of EPTB were genitourinary TB (27.2%) and meningeal TB (19.4%). TB in bone/joints,
pleural cavity, lymph nodes, skin, and peritoneal cavity occurred at a frequency ranging from 9.7% to 10.7%. The age
distribution was significantly different (P < 0.01) between PTB and EPTB, with patients older than 45 years tending to
have an increased risk of EPTB. Furthermore, the distribution of different types of EPTB differed significantly among
age groups (P = 0.03). Meningeal and bone and/or joint TB were more commonly observed among the male
patients, while lymphatic, genitourinary, and peritoneal TB cases were more frequently seen among females. Unique
strain infection was statistically significantly associated with EPTB (OR: 2.82, 95% CI [1.59, 5.00]).
Conclusions: EPTB accounted for a significant proportion of TB cases in Malatya, Turkey between 2001 and 2007.
The current study has provided an insight into the dynamics of EPTB in Malatya, Turkey. However, the risk factors
for having EPTB in Malatya, Turkey remain to be assessed in future studies using population-based or randomly
selected sample.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading infectious
diseases causing significant morbidity and mortality
worldwide. One third of the world’s population is
latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis [1], of
which about 10% may develop active disease at anytime
[2]. Although the infection of M. tuberculosis usually
results in pulmonary TB, other organs and tissues can
also be affected, resulting in extrapulmonary or disseminated TB [3-5].
Extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) is a significant health problem, as is pulmonary TB (PTB), in both developing

and developed countries [4,6]. For example, in India,
while 15-20 percent of the immunocompetent adult TB
cases were EPTB, the rate of EPTB was increased to
more than 50% among the HIV co-infected patients [7].
In the Netherlands, the frequency of EPTB was found to
be 15% among the eastern and central Europeans, 58.9%
among the Somali, 36.6% among people of other African
origins, and 44% among the Asians [8]. The reported
proportions of EPTB among all TB cases in other developed countries ranged from 12% to 28.5% [4,9-12].
Turkey is a developing country with a population of
more than 70 million and about 20,000 notified new TB
cases annually. The proportion of EPTB among all TB
cases in Turkey had increased from 19.6% in 1996 to
32.5% in 2007 [13]. However, the reason for such an
increase remains largely unknown. A directly observed

therapy short-course strategy was started as a pilot study
in 2003 and it was implemented throughout the country
in 2008. BCG vaccination has been routinely applied to
all children. TB control is mainly done by dispensaries
around the country, sanatorium hospitals, and university
hospitals. In TB dispensaries, the diagnosis of TB is
usually based on a combination of medical history, physical examination, chest-X ray, and microscopic examination of clinical specimens for the presence of tubercle
bacilli. People suspected to have TB will then be refered
to the university or sanatorium hospitals, where mycobacterial culture can be performed for confirmation of
the diagnosis. A limited number of medical centers are
able to perform accurate and rapid culture and susceptibility testing. All TB patients are treated free-off charge.
Malatya is the third biggest city in the eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. The TB incidence rate (28.5/
100.000) in Malatya has been higher than the average of
the country and the EPTB rate which is higher than the
average of the country has increased steadily in recent
years, from 33.3% in 2005 to 42.2% in 2007 [13]. The
present study was conducted to gain insight into the
demographic and microbial characteristics of EPTB
cases in Malatya, Turkey, thereby to extend the knowledgebase of EPTB based on which better TB control
strategies can be developed.

(described above) and sometimes concurrently present
pulmonary TB symptoms, and the medical history supporting TB diagnosis described above. For confirmation
of TB diagnosis, appropriate clinical specimens for each
form of TB, such as sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine,
biopsy materials were examined by microscopy, mycobacterial culture, TB-PCR test and sometimes histopathologic testing. Mycobacterial culture was only done
at Turgut Ozal Medical Center, the university hospital.
Each year, 200-270 new TB cases are notified in the
entire Maltya province, of which 80-90 were mycobaterial culture-positive. The study sample included all the
culture-positive cases confirmed at Turgut Ozal Medical
Center during the study period, representing approximately 58% of the culture-positive TB cases in Malatya
during the study period. The demographic (age and
sex), clinical (type of TB diagnosis), and laboratory data
(pathologic, microscopic, culture and molecular analysis
of M. tuberculosis isolates) of the patients were retrieved
from the existing molecular epidemiological study database established previously by Durmaz et al [14].
No patient identifier was included in the database
used for the study. The study protocol was approved by
the University of Michigan’s Institutional Review Board
and the Inonu University Ethical Committee.
M. tuberculosis isolates

Methods
Patient population

The study sample included 397 TB patients whose TB
diagnosis were confirmed by mycobacterial culture performed at Turgut Ozal Medical Center, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey, during the time period from
January, 1st 2001 to December 31st, 2007. Turgut Ozal
Medical Center is one of the five medical institutions
located in the city of Malatya and it provides medical
serives to the 850,000 population residing in Malatya,
Turkey. The other four of the five medical institutions
include two TB dispensaries and two governmental hospitals. The initial diagnosis of TB was made in any of
the five medical institutions. An individual was suspected to have active pulmonary TB (PTB) if the individual had pulmonary TB symptoms (productive,
prolonged cough of three or more weeks, chest pain, the
production of sputum, and hemoptysis) and systemic
symptoms (low grade remittent fever, chills, night
sweats, appetite loss, weight loss, easy fatiguability).
Information about prior TB exposure, infection or
disease, past TB treatment was obtained as additional
supporting evidence. A PPD tuberlin skin test and chest
X-ray were done for TB suspects at local TB dispensaries. The initial diagnosis of EPTB cases was generally
considered when a patient complained of organ-specific
symptoms, besides having the systemic symptoms

One M. tuberculosis isolate from each patient was
included in this study. The identification of M. tuberculosis isolates was done by conventional methods, including the nitrate reduction test, the niacin accumulation
test, the BACTEC p-nitro-a-acetylamino-b-hydroxypropiophenone test (Becton Dickinson), and growth characteristics [15]. Susceptibility testing to isoniazid (0.1 μg/
ml), rifampin (2 μg/ml), streptomycin (2 μg/ml), and
ethambutol (2.5 μg/ml) was performed by the modified
1% proportion method in the BACTEC 460 radiometric
system or the MGIT 9600 system (Becton Dickinson,
Sparks, Maryland, USA). The isolates that are resistant
to at least isoniazid and rifampin were defined as multidrug resistant (MDR) [16].
Genotyping of the study isolates

The IS6110 restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism
(RFLP) was performed using standard methods [17].
The banding patterns of the isolates were compared by
using Bionumerics (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem,
Belgium). Standard spoligotyping was performed with
the Dra and Drb primers [18]. Spoligotype of each strain
was compared to the international spoligotyping database of the Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe, and major
phylogenetic clades were discribed according to signatures provided in SpolDB4 [19]. Clusters were determined if any two or more isolates having identical

We compared the distributions of demographic (age and
sex) and microbial characteristics (drug susceptibility,
IS6110 copy number range, genotyping-based clustering,
and the major spoligotypes) between PTB and EPTB
groups by chi-square analysis. We defined EPTB versus
PTB, based on the affected anatomic sites from which
we isolated M. tuberculosis. EPTB group included cases
whose isolates were obtained from any organs and tissues, except for lung parenchyma. Intrathoracic lymphatic TB without a concurrent diagnosis of PTB was
defined as EPTB [12]. The PTB group contained the
cases having positive sputum cultures. P value ≤ 0.05
was regarded as statistically significant. Multivariate
logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for having EPTB. All of the statistical
analyses were done using SAS, version 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

pleural, meningeal and bone/joint TB appeared to be
more commonly observed among the male patients while
lymphatic, genitourinary, and peritoneal TB cases were
predominant among females (Figure 1). Furthermore, the
distributions of the different types of EPTB differed significantly among different age groups (Figure 2). In the
youngest age group (< 1-15 years), meningeal TB was the
most frequently seen type of EPTB, accounting for more
than half of the EPTB cases in that age group. In contrast, in the 16-30 year-age group, the most commonly
seen type was genitourinary, whereas for the remaining
three age groups (31-45, 46-45, and ≥ 61 years), the most
commonly seen types were skin, lymphatic and bone/
joint, and peritoneal, respectively (Figure 2). Because of
the age-specific distribution of the specific types of
EPTB, the age composition differed among different
types of EPTB (P = 0.03). For example, while lymphatic
and bone/joint TB were predominated by people in the
age group 46 - 60 year old, meningeal TB contained
mainly patients younger than 15 years, peritoneal TB was
predominated by patients in the 31-45 years and
≥ 61 year age groups; genitourinary and pleural in the
16-30 years age group, skin in the 31-45 years age group.

Microbial characteristics and risk factors of EPTB

Characteristics of the study patients

IS6110 RFLP typing showed that one fourth of the study
isolates (99/397) were low-copy number isolates having
less than 5 copies of IS6110. IS6110 copy numbers varied from 2 to 15 and 65% of the isolates had 7-12
copies. The distributions of the high copy and low copy
isolates were not statistically significantly different
between PTB and EPTB groups (Table 1). A combination of the results of both IS6110 RFLP analysis and
spoligo secondary typing identified 112 (38.10%) of the
294 PTB isolates and 20 (19.42%) of the 103 EPTB isolates as clustered. Unique strains were overrepresented
among EPTB cases while clustered strains were overrepresented among the PTB cases (P < 0.01).
Spoligotyping defined a total of nine spoligo superfamilies that include 344 (86.6%) of the 397 study isolates.
Fifty three (13.4%) of the spoligotype were not matched
in the any spoligotypes in the SpolDB4 database.
Ill-defined T (46.3%, 184/397), Latin American and
Mediterranean (LAM, 19.4%, 77/397), and Haarlem
(H, 14.1%, 56/397) were the most commonly seen
superfamilies found in our study sample. Four isolates
(1.0%) were determined to be Beijing family strains.
There was no statistically significant difference in the
distribution of spoligo superfamilies between PTB and
EPTB (Table 1). However, it is worth to mention that of
the four Beijing strains, one was from a pulmonary case,
while three were EPTB isolates.
Eighteen (4.5%) of the 397 isolates were multi-drug
resistant (MDR), 96 (24.2%) were non-MDR resistant

IS6110 fingerprinting patterns comprising more than 5
bands (high copy) or having identical IS6110 fingerprinting patterns comprising 5 or less bands (low-copy) and
identical spoligotyping patterns.
Statistical analyses

Of the 397 patients, 238 (59.9%) were males, 159
(40.1%) were females. The male to female ratio was 1.5.
The majority of the patients (83%) were born in Malatya, the remaining 17% were from neighboring cities of
Malatya. The median age of the study patient was 32
years (ranging from less than 1 year to 89 years).
Frequency distribution of different types of EPTB

One hundred and three (25.9%) were defined as having
EPTB and the remaining 294 (74.1%) as having pulmonary TB, based on the sites from which the isolates were
obtained. Of the 103 EPTB, the most commonly seen
type was genitourinary TB (28 cases; 27.2%), followed by
meningeal TB (20 cases; 19.4%), bone and/or joint TB
(11 cases; 10.7%), pleural TB (11 cases; 10.7%), lymphatic TB (10 cases; 9.7%), skin TB (10 cases; 9.7%), peritoneal TB (10 cases; 9.7%), pericardial TB (2 cases; 1.9%),
and miliary TB (1 case; 0.9%).
Demographic characteristics of EPTB cases

Among the 103 EPTB cases, women and men each
accounted for half of the cases (Table 1). The male to
female ratio for PTB (1.64) was higher than that for
EPTB (1.14). The median age for PTB was 30 years
(ranging from 2 to 89), while the median age for EPTB
was 33 years (ranging from < 1 to 80). Although the
overall distributions of the different types of EPTB was
not statistically significant between females and males,

drugs tested. Drug resistance was not significantly different between PTB and EPTB (Table 1).
After adjustment for potential confounders in a multivariate logistic regression model, infection of unique
strain remained strongly associated with EPTB (Table 2).

Discussion
To gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of
EPTB in Turkey, we analyzed demographic, clinical and
microbial characteristics of 397 TB patients diagnosed in
Malatya, Turkey between January 1st, 2001 and December
31st, 2007. About one fourth of the study subjects had
EPTB. Different types of EPTB occurred at a varied frequency, with genitourinary and meningeal TB being the
most commonly seen types. Age distribution was significantly different (P < 0.01) between PTB and EPTB, people
aged 46 and above appeared to have an increased risk for
having EPTB. Furthermore, the distribution of different
forms of EPTB differed significantly among age groups (P
= 0.03), resulting in significantly different age compositions for different specific types of EPTB. M. tuberculosis
isolates obtained from EPTB cases were significantly more

likely to have unique DNA fingerprinting patterns. Different from previous studies of EPTB, in our study, being
female was not found to be a risk factor for EPTB.
Furthermore, although it was not statistically significant,
meningeal and bone and/or joint TB were more commonly observed among the male patients than among the
female patients. In contrast, lymphatic, genitourinary, and
peritoneal TB cases were predominant among females.
The previous reported proportion of EPTB among all
TB cases in different countries varied between 12% and
25.8% [5,9,11,20]. Previous studies conducted in different regions of Turkey showed that the rates of EPTB
cases among all TB cases ranged from 3.2% to 53.8%
[21-25]. EPTB was found in 25.9% of our study population. Furthermore, the distribution of different forms of
EPTB has varied among studies conducted in different
populations, including different regions of Turkey. In
our study population, genitourinary and meningeal TB
was commonly seen EPTB types including 27.2% and
19.4% of the EPTB cases, respectively. In contrast, in
several earlier studies conducted in other regions of
Turkey, the most frequently seen forms of EPTB were
pleural TB [21,22], lymphatic TB [23], and central

nerves system TB [26], respectively. A previous study
performed on 85 culture-proven EPTB cases in Arkansas showed that bone and/or joint tuberculosis was the
most common type of extrapulmonary tuberculosis
(27.1%) followed by cervical lymphatic tuberculosis
(17.7%) [4]. Another study conducted on 480 EPTB
cases (of which 76% were culture positive) in San Francisco showed that lymphatic TB was the most frequent
form (45.1%) followed by bone and joint TB (15.6%) and
pleural TB (14.3%) [11]. Our study included only culture- confirmed EPTB cases because Turgut Ozal Medical Center mainly accepted patients whose diagnosis
require more complicated procedure for TB diagnosis.
In contrast, in the Turkish studies mentioned above, the
EPTB cases were mainly diagnosed based on clinical
and radiological findings. Methodological differences,
such as the difference in the inclusion criteria mentioned above, can be one of the possible reasons for the
reported variations in the distribution of different forms
of EPTB across different studies. However, it was worth
to note that in all the EPTB studies conducted in Turkey so far, TB meningitis was found to be one of the
most frequently observed type of EPTB.
In previous studies, being female, non-Hispanic black,
and HIV infected were found to be the independent risk
factors for EPTB [4,11,27,28]. In our study population,

HIV screening is not routinely done, therefore we did
not have the information regarding the HIV infection
status of patients. However, according to the reports of
the Turkish Ministry of Health, there were only three
confirmed HIV/AIDS cases in Malatya at the end of
2007 [29]. Thus, it is unlikely that the high frequency of
EPTB in Malatya was driven by high HIV infection rate
in the population. The increasing EPTB up to 42% in
2007 in Malatya [13] may depend on an increasing
awareness of EPTB and increasing laboratory facilities in
recent years. Additionally as it was indicated previously
[4]; the high incidence high dynamics of extrapulmonary
tuberculosis may be specific to our study population.
Different from several earlier studies of EPTB
[4,11,12], our study did not find that female sex was statistically associated with EPTB. The failure to detect an
association between female sex and EPTB in our study
could be partly due to the low statistical power associated with the small sample size of the study. In addition, we were unable to identify cases that might have
had concurrent pulmonary and extrapulmonary involvement due to lack of information about additional disease
sites. This limitation may have also contributed to the
failure to identify some previously risk factors of EPTB
in our study. Nevertheless, our observation of the differential distribution of a given type of EPTB between men

and women suggest the possibility that gender differentials in EPTB exist in the population of Maltya, Turkey.
We found that age distribution was significantly different (P < 0.01) between PTB and EPTB. More than 52% of
the PTB patients were in the 16-45 years-age group, while
the age distribution among the EPTB cases was bimodal.
This observation, together with our observation that the
clustering rate was significantly higher among the pulmonary cases than among EPTB (38.1% vs. 19.4% respectively,
P < 0.01), suggests that most of PTB cases in this population might be largely related to ongoing TB transmission,
given that the associated age group (16-45 years) is known
as a high risk group for TB transmission [2]. Different
from our study, a previous study conducted in Antananarivo (Madagascar) found no significant differences in the
clustering rates between PTB and EPTB groups [30] while
another study conducted in San Francisco, the United
States showed that young age was an independent risk factor for nonrespiratory TB and only pleural TB among the
EPTB was associated with the highest clustering rate [11].

As found in our previous studies using pulmonary isolates [15,31], in the present study, the ill-defined T
clade, LAM, and Haarlem were the most commonly
found clades among both PTB and EPTB cases. A previous population-based study conducted in Arkansas, U.
S.A. found that Beijing family strain infection is statistically significantly associated with EPTB [32]. While the
number of the Beijing strains in the current study is too
small to be assessed for statistical significance, the
majority (3/4, 75%) of Beijing strains identified in our
study were related to EPTB is intriguing.

Conclusions
EPTB accounted for a significant proportion of TB
cases in Malatya, Turkey between 2001 and 2007. The
current study has provided an insight into the
dynamics of EPTB in Malatya, Turkey. However, the
risk factors for having EPTB remain to be assessed in
future studies using population-based or randomly
selected sample.
