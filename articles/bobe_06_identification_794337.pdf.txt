Abstract
Background: The hormonal control of oocyte maturation and ovulation as well as the molecular
mechanisms of nuclear maturation have been thoroughly studied in fish. In contrast, the other molecular
events occurring in the ovary during post-vitellogenesis have received far less attention.
Methods: Nylon microarrays displaying 9152 rainbow trout cDNAs were hybridized using RNA samples
originating from ovarian tissue collected during late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte
maturation. Differentially expressed genes were identified using a statistical analysis. A supervised
clustering analysis was performed using only differentially expressed genes in order to identify gene
clusters exhibiting similar expression profiles. In addition, specific genes were selected and their
preovulatory ovarian expression was analyzed using real-time PCR.
Results: From the statistical analysis, 310 differentially expressed genes were identified. Among those
genes, 90 were up-regulated at the time of oocyte maturation while 220 exhibited an opposite pattern.
After clustering analysis, 90 clones belonging to 3 gene clusters exhibiting the most remarkable expression
patterns were kept for further analysis. Using real-time PCR analysis, we observed a strong up-regulation
of ion and water transport genes such as aquaporin 4 (aqp4) and pendrin (slc26). In addition, a dramatic
up-regulation of vasotocin (avt) gene was observed. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2
(ace2), coagulation factor V (cf5), adam 22, and the chemokine cxcl14 genes exhibited a sharp upregulation at the time of oocyte maturation. Finally, ovarian aromatase (cyp19a1) exhibited a dramatic
down-regulation over the post-vitellogenic period while a down-regulation of Cytidine monophosphateN-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (cmah) was observed at the time of oocyte maturation.
Conclusion: We showed the over or under expression of more that 300 genes, most of them being
previously unstudied or unknown in the fish preovulatory ovary. Our data confirmed the down-regulation
of estrogen synthesis genes during the preovulatory period. In addition, the strong up-regulation of aqp4
and slc26 genes prior to ovulation suggests their participation in the oocyte hydration process occurring
at that time. Furthermore, among the most up-regulated clones, several genes such as cxcl14, ace2,
adam22, cf5 have pro-inflammatory, vasodilatory, proteolytics and coagulatory functions. The identity and
expression patterns of those genes support the theory comparing ovulation to an inflammatory-like
reaction.

Background
In fish, as in other lower vertebrates, the post-vitellogenic
period is very important for the completion of the oogenetic process. During this step, the follicle-enclosed postvitellogenic oocyte undergoes several key events such as
the final acquisition of the ability to resume meiosis in
response to the maturation-inducing steroid (MIS), the
resumption of the meiotic process and, finally, its release
from the surrounding follicular layers. In addition, the
whole follicle (oocyte and surrounding follicular cells)
undergoes a progressive differentiation ultimately leading
to the release of a metaphase 2 oocyte. The key hormonal
and molecular events involved in the control of meiosis
resumption have been thoroughly studied and many
studies have been dedicated to the action of gonadotropins, the regulation of steroidogenenic events and the
action of the MIS (see [1-6] for review). However, the
associated follicular or extra-follicular events involved in
concomitant processes such as oocyte-follicular cells cross
talk and ovulationmechanisms have received far less
attention. Nevertheless, several researchgroups have studied the periovulatory ovarian physiology using classical
biochemical or histological tools and, later, molecular
approaches. Thus, several studies have dealt with ovarian
proteases in their participation in the ovulatory process
[7-9]. Differential display PCR and suppressive subtractive
hybridization (SSH) approaches have also been developed in order to identify new differentially regulated
genes in the fish periovulatory ovary [10-13]. In addition,
numerous candidate gene studies have also been performed in the fish periovulatory ovary. Apart from genes
related to hormonal controls, these studies were mostly
dedicated to some specific gene families such as TGF beta
family [14,15] or connexins [16,17]. Finally, fewer studies
have simultaneously analyzed the expression profiles of
several genes belonging to different families [18,19].
However, in contrast to other biological processes, such as
immune response [20], the post-vitellogenic period has
never benefited from genome-wide transcriptomic studies
that could provide a global view of the molecular events
occurring in the post-vitellogenic ovary undergoing
oocyte maturation. In this context, the present study
aimed at performing a transcriptomic analysis of the postvitellogenic rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout ovary. In
order to do so, 9152-gene rainbow trout cDNA microarrays were hybridized using RNA samples originating from
rainbow trout ovarian tissue collected during late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. A statistical analysis was performed in order to identify all the
genes exhibiting a differential expression over this period.
In addition, a supervised clustering analysis was performed using only the differentially expressed genes in
order to identify groups (or clusters) of genes exhibiting
similar expression profiles. Furthermore, as a first step in
a long-term transcriptomic analysis of the rainbow trout

http://www.rbej.com/content/4/1/39

post-vitellogenic ovary, we deliberately chose to focus on
3 gene clusters exhibiting the most remarkable expression
patterns. Finally, specific genes were selected in each cluster based on the novelty of their putative identity and/or
function. For each gene, a real-time PCR analysis of their
ovarian expression profiles was performed using additional ovarian RNA samples.

Methods
Animal and tissue collection
Investigations were conducted according to the guiding
principles for the use and care of laboratory animals and
in compliance with French and European regulations on
animal welfare. Two year old female rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were obtained during their first reproductive season from our experimental fish farm (Sizun,
France) and held under natural photoperiod in a re-circulated water system in INRA experimental facilities
(Rennes, France). The water temperature was kept constant at 12°C. Ovaries were sampled from individual
females during late vitellogenesis (N = 6), post-vitellogenesis (N = 6) and during oocyte maturation (N = 6). Oocyte
developmental stage was assessed under binocular microscope according to previously described criteria [21,22].
Late vitellogenic samples were collected at the end of the
vitellogenic process, approximately 3–4 weeks before
expected ovulation. At this stage, germinal vesicle is not
visible and no polarized cytoplasm area can be observed.
Post-vitellogenic samples were collected 2–3 weeks later
but before any noticeable morphological changes in yolk
structure due to the process of meiosis resumption. At this
stage, oocytes can display a subperipheral or peripheral
germinal vesicle. When germinal vesicle is not visible, a
dark mass of polarized cytoplasm can be observed.
Oocyte maturation samples were collected after meiosis
resumption. Those samples were thus collected after yolk
clarification and around the time of germinal vesicle
breakdown (GVBD). For tissue collection, trout were
deeply anesthetized in 2-phenoxyethanol, killed by a
blow on the head and bled by gill arch section. Ovaries
were then dissected out of the body cavity under sterile
conditions. Ovarian aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription
Ovarian tissue was homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) at a ratio of 100 mg per ml
of reagent and total RNA was extracted according to manufacturer's instruction. Due to yolk abundance in rainbow
trout full-grown oocytes, total RNA was subsequently repurified using a Nucleospin RNA 2 kit (Macherey Nagel,
Germany) to obtain genomic grade RNA quality.

cDNA microarrays
Nylon micro-arrays (7.6 × 2.6 cm) were obtained from
INRA-GADIE (Jouy-en-Josas, France) [23]. A set of 9152
distinct rainbow trout cDNA clones originating from a
pooled-tissues library [24] were spotted in duplicates after
PCR amplification. PCR products were spotted onto
Hybond N+ membranes as described by Nguyen et al.
[25]. This rainbow trout generic array was deposited in
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (Platform#
GPL 3650) [26].
Hybridization
RNA samples originating from 13 ovarian samples (late
vitellogenesis, N = 3; post-vitellogenesis, N = 4 and oocyte
maturation N = 6) were used for microarray hybridization
according to the following procedure. Hybridizations
were carried out as described by Bertucci et al. [27], with
minor modifications, at INRA AGENAE genomic facility
(Rennes). A first hybridization was performed using a
33P-labelled oligonucleotide (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG which is present at the extremity of each PCR product) to monitor the amount of cDNA in each spot. After
stripping (3 hours 68°c, 0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS), arrays were
prehybridized for 1 h at 65°C in hybridization solution
(5× Denhardt's, 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS). Complex probes were
prepared from 3 μg of RNA of each sample by simultaneous reverse transcription and labeling for 1 hour at 42°C
in the presence of 50 μCi [alpha-33P] dCTP, 5 μM dCTP,
0.8 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 200 units M-MLV
SuperScript RNase H-reverse transcriptase (GIBCO BRL)
in 30 μL final volume. RNA was degraded by treatment at
68°C for 30 min with 1 μl 10% SDS, 1 μl 0.5 M EDTA and
3 μl 3 M NaOH, and then equilibrated at room temperature for 15 min. Neutralization was done by adding 10 μl
1 M Tris-HCl plus 3 μl 2N HCl. Arrays were incubated
with the corresponding denatured labeled cDNAs for 18 h
at 65°C in hybridization solution. After 3 washes (1 hours
68°C, 0.1× SSC 0.2% SDS), arrays were exposed 65 hours
to phosphor-imaging plates before scanning using a FUJI
BAS 5000. Signal intensities were quantified using
ArrayGauge software (FujifilmMedical Systems, Stanford,
CT) and deposited in GEO database (Series# GSE 4871).
Microarray signal processing
Low oligonucleotide signals (lower than three times the
background level) were excluded from the analysis. After
this filtering step, signal processing was performed using
the vector oligonucleotide data to correct each spot signal
by the actual amount of DNA present in each spot. After
correction, signal was normalized by dividing each gene
expression value by the median value of the array.
Microarray data analysis
A statistical analysis was performed in order to identify
differentially expressed genes between late vitellogenic,

http://www.rbej.com/content/4/1/39

post-vitellogenic and maturing groups using SAM software[28]. Three 2-by-2 statistical analyses were performed
in order to compare each group with the two other ones.
In addition, a comparison was performed between samples taken prior to meiosis resumption (from late and
post-vitellogenic females, N = 7) and during oocyte maturation (N = 6). For each comparison, the lowest false discovery rate (FDR) was used to identify differentially
abundant genes. All genes identified in at least one of the
above comparisons were kept for clustering analysis in
order to characterize the expression profiles of statistically
relevant genes. For supervised clustering analysis [29],
data was log transformed, median-centered and an average linkage clustering was performed using CLUSTER software [29]. Clusters were visualized using TREEVIEW
software [29].
Data mining
Rainbow trout sequences originating from INRA Agenae
[24] and USDA [30] EST sequencing programs were used
to generate publicly available contigs [31]. The 8th version (Om.8, released January 2006) was used for BlastX
[32] comparison against the Swiss-Prot database (January
2006) [33]. The score of each alignment was retrieved
after performing a BlastX comparison. In addition, for
each EST spotted onto the membrane, the accession
number of the corresponding rainbow trout cluster (Unigene Trout, January 2006), if any, was retrieved from the
UniGene database [34].
Real-time PCR analysis
Real-time PCR was performed using all RNA (N = 18)
samples including those used for microarray analysis. Several over and under expressed clones belonging to three
selected remarkable clusters, were selected according to
their putative identity and/or function for analysis.
Reverse transcription and real time PCR were performed
as previously described [19]. Briefly, 3 μg of total RNA
were reverse transcribed using 200 units of Moloney
murine Leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase
(Promega, Madison, WI) and 0.5 μg random hexamers
(Promega) per μg of total RNA according to manufacturer's instruction. RNA and dNTPs were denatured for 6
min at 70°C, then chilled on ice for 5 min before the
reverse transcription master mix was added. Reverse transcription was performed at 37°C for 1 hour and 15 min
followed by a 15 min incubation step at 70°C. Control
reactions were run without MMLV reverse transcriptase
and used as negative controls in the real-time PCR study.
Real-time PCR experiments were conducted using an
I-Cycler IQ (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Reverse transcription
products were diluted to 1/25, and 5 μl were used for each
real-time PCR reaction. Triplicates were run for each RT
product. Real-time PCR was performed using a real-time
PCR kit provided with a SYBR Green fluorophore (Euro-

gentec, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using 600 nM of each primer. After a 2 min
incubation step at 50°C and a 10 min incubation step at
95°C, the amplification was performed using the following cycle: 95°C, 20 sec; 60°C, 1 min, 40 times. For all
primer pairs, the relative abundance of target cDNA
within sample set was calculated from a serially diluted
ovarian cDNA pool using the I-Cycler IQ software. This
dilution curve was used to ensure that PCR efficiency was
within an 80–100% range and that amplification was linear within sample set. After amplification, a fusion curve
was obtained using the following protocol: 10 sec holding
followed by a 0.5°C increase, repeated 80 times and starting at 55°C. The level of 18S RNA in each sample was
measured and used for target genes abundance normalization within sample set. In addition to the genes identified
from the transcriptomic analysis, a widely used standard
gene, elongation factor 1 alpha (ef1α), was monitored
using the same sample set to validate the normalization
procedure. GenBank accession number and primer
sequences are shown in table 1. Statistical analyses were
performed using Statistica 7.0 software (Statsoft, Tulsa,
OK). Differences between ovarian developments stages
were analyzed using non parametric U tests.

Results
Statistical analysis and supervised clustering
After signal processing, 8263 clones out of 9152 were kept
for further analysis. From the statistical analysis, 310
clones were found to exhibit a differential abundance
between at least 2 of the studied ovarian stages (late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation). For
all SAM analyses performed, the false discovery rate (FDR)
was always lower than 0.7%. Among the 310 identified
clones, 90 were up-regulated during oocyte maturation
while 220 exhibited an opposite pattern. A clustering
analysis was performed using only expression data of the
310 identified clones in order to characterize the expression profiles of those genes. The clustering analysis clearly
separated the over from the under expressed genes (Figure
1). The number of each clone (1–310) in the clustering
analysis (Figure 1) was kept in subsequent tables 1, 2, 3, 4
and in the text. Within down-regulated genes, a cluster of
32 genes (cluster 1, Figure 1) was characterized by high
expression levels during late vitellogenesis, low levels during oocyte maturation and intermediate or variable levels
during post-vitellogenesis (Figure 1). Within up-regulated
clones, a cluster of 44 genes (cluster 2, Figure 1) was characterized by a strong over expression at the time of meiosis resumption while a cluster of 14 genes (cluster 3,
Figure 1) exhibited a very low expression during late and
post-vitellogenesis and an up-regulation before meiosis
resumption (Figure 1).

Identity of differentially expressed cDNAs
The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) genome has not
been sequenced and the number of characterized rainbow
trout proteins and mRNAs is limited. The identity of studied transcripts was therefore based on the most significant
hit obtained after performing a BlastX search against the
SwissProt database. For the clones belonging to cluster 1–
3, the results of this blast search is presented in tables 2, 3,
4. For each clone, the identity of the best hit in SwissProt
and the score value of the BlastX comparison are given.
However, this similarity search was performed using all
EST sequences available in public databases and not using
fully characterized cDNAs displaying the full coding
sequence of the transcript. For some of the clones spotted
on the trout array, the corresponding mRNA was previously characterized and made available in public databases. The identity of those clones is therefore
unambiguous. In contrast, for some other clones, the best
hit in SwissProt only gives significant, but incomplete,
information. This is especially true for protein family
members for which only a phylogenetic analysis will
allow a more relevant identification of the gene. However,
the name of the best hit was used in the text for clarity reasons.
Cluster 1
This large cluster of 32 clones (# 189–220) was characterized by a clear under expression at the time of oocyte maturation. Among those 32 clones, 29 belonged to a
UniGene cluster and 30 had a significant hit in Swiss-Prot
(Table 2). Two clones (# 196 and 198) corresponded to
rainbow trout ovarian P450 aromatase (cyp19a1) and
therefore belonged to the same UniGene cluster (Omy.
241). Similarly, clones # 199 and 200 belonged to UniGene cluster Omy.4204 and exhibited sequence similarity
with bovine vitamin K-dependent protein S precursor. In
addition, one clone (# 202) corresponding to rainbow
trout cyp1a3 (EC 1.14.14.1), was identified while another
clone (# 194) was most similar to rat CYP2J3. Finally, this
cluster also included clones exhibiting sequence similarity
with zebrafish cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (cmah) (# 212), salmon

NADPH – cytochrome P450 reductase (# 192) and Glutathione S-transferase (# 214). Within cluster 1, cyp19a1
(clones # 196 and 198), vitamin K-dependent protein S
precursor (clones # 199 and 200) and cmah (clone # 212)
genes were kept for real-time PCR analysis.
Cluster 2
This very large cluster of 44 clones (# 222–265) was characterized by a sharp over expression at the time of meiosis
resumption. Among the 44 clones present in this cluster,
30 belonged to a UniGene cluster (Table 3). In addition,
39 clones exhibited a significant hit in SwissProt while 5
clones had no significant sequence similarities with
known genes (Table 3). Within this cluster, several genes
exhibited inflammation or ovulation-related functions.
Thus some of the clones exhibited sequence similarities
with human chemokine cxcl14 (clone # 250), clawed frog
adam22 (clone # 258) and coagulation factor V (cf5)
(clone # 235). In addition, one clone (# 245) exhibited
strong sequence similarity with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 precursor (ace2). Two clones (# 238 and
239) exhibited strong sequence similarity with salmon
(Oncorhynchus keta) vasotocin-neurophysin (avt) and isotocin-neurophysin respectively. Finally, cluster 3 also contained clones exhibiting sequence similarity with, human
Forkhead box protein O3A and human pendrin, also
know as solute carrier family 26 member 4 (slc26) (clone
# 236). Within cluster 2, cxcl14, adam22, slc26, avt, ace2
and cf5 genes were kept for real-time PCR analysis.
Cluster 3
This small cluster of 14 clones (# 296–309) was characterized by an over expression occurring earlier than for the
genes belonging to cluster 3. Among those 14 clones, 12
belonged to a UniGene cluster and 11 had a significant hit
in SwissProt (Table 4). Two clones (# 305 and 306) were
most similar to rat and human aquaporin 4 (aqp4) respectively. These 2 clones belonged to the same UniGene cluster (Omy.23866). In addition, one clone (# 296) was
most similar to mouse serine protease 23 (sp23). Within
cluster 3, aqp4 and sp23 genes were kept for real-time PCR
analysis.

Real-time PCR analysis
For all the genes selected for the real-time PCR analysis, a
similar up or down regulation was observed between
microarray and real-time PCR experiments.
Under expressed genes during oocyte maturation
We observed a dramatic under expression of aromatase
(cyp19a1, clones # 196 and 198) in the ovary during the
preovulatory period (Figure 2). The mRNA abundance of
cyp19a gene during oocyte maturation was more than 200
times lower than during late vitellogenesis. In addition,
successive decreases of cyp19a gene expression levels were
observed during post-vitellogenesis and during oocyte
maturation (Figure 2). The mRNA abundance of vitamin
K-dependent protein S precursor gene (clones # 199 and
200) was lower during oocyte maturation than during late
or post-vitellogenesis. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between late and post-vitellogenesis
(Figure 2). A similar expression profile was observed for
Cytidine
monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic
acid
hydroxylase (cmah) gene (Figure 2).
Over expressed genes during oocyte maturation
We observed a strong over expression of aquaporin 4
(aqp4) gene during post-vitellogenesis and at the time of
oocyte maturation (Figure 3). The mRNA abundance of
aqp4 gene exhibited a 6-fold increase during post-vitellogenesis and a further 12-fold increase during oocyte maturation. In addition, the mRNA abundance of pendrin
(slc26) gene exhibited a 1500-fold increase during oocyte

maturation while no significant differences were observed
between late and post-vitellogenesis. Similarly, vasotocin
(avt) mRNA abundance exhibited a 500-fold increase at
the time of oocyte maturation (Figure 3). Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ace2) gene expression levels exhibited a 215-fold increase between late vitellogenesis and
oocyte maturation (Figure 3). A similar profile was
observed for the chemokine cxcl14 gene. The mRNA
abundance of this gene exhibited a 35-fold increase
between late vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation (Figure
3). The mRNA abundance of coagulation factor V (cf5)
gene exhibited a 177-fold increase between late or postvitellogenesis and oocyte maturation while adam22
mRNA abundance exhibited a 6-fold increase between
late or post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation (Figure
3). Finally, the mRNA abundance serine protease 23
(sp23) gene monitored during oocyte maturation was
higher than in the late vitellogenic ovary. However, this
difference was not significantly different (p = 0.078).
Control gene
The mRNA abundance of elongation factor 1 alpha
(ef1α), a translation regulatory protein commonly used as
a stable reference, did not exhibit any significant difference over the preovulatory period (Figure 3).

decades. However, the use of nylon cDNA microarrays is
not very common in comparison to glass slide microarray
technology. Nevertheless, this technology has successfully
been used for several years [27,35]. In the present study
we used similar cDNA manufacturing and hybridization
protocols. While most of the 9152 clones used to generate
the microarray putatively correspond to distinct genes, a
small proportion of genes are represented by 2 distinct
clones (e.g clones belonging to the same UniGene cluster). In our data, it is noteworthy that those clones are usually found in the same gene clusters (e.g clones #196 and
198, #199 and 200, #305 and 306). Since the position of
clones in the clustering analysis is based on the correlation between their profiles, this indicates that they display
very similar expression profiles. In addition, for all genes
selected for real-time PCR analysis, the over or under
expression observed was always consistent with microarray data. Furthermore, the expression of ef1α, a widely
used reference gene, was stable over the preovulatory
period. Together, these observations suggest that our overall microarray analysis is extremely robust and reliable.
Identities of identified genes and putative involvement in
preovulatory ovarian functions
In the present study, we identified 310 genes exhibiting a
differential expression during the preovulatory period.
Among them, 220 were down-regulated during oocyte
maturation while 90 exhibited an opposite pattern. However, because we decided, as a first step, to focus our anal-

ysis on the genes exhibiting the most differential
regulation in the periovulatory period, we only present
the identity of the 90 genes belonging to 3 specific clusters
exhibiting the most remarkable patterns. Among those 90
transcripts we have chosen to discuss the most informative or novel genes based on their identities and/or putative involvement in the rainbow trout preovulatory
ovarian functions.
Estrogen synthesis
Among the 32 clones belonging to cluster 1, two clones
correspond to rainbow trout ovarian aromatase
(cyp19a1). The real-time PCR study confirmed that
cyp19a1 was dramatically under expressed during the preovulatory period. This observation is in total agreement
with existing data on aromatase expression during this
period [19,36]. In addition, a clone putatively encoding
for a NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4)
was also located in cluster 1. The aromatase enzyme complex is formed from 2 principal protein components.
CYP19a1 contains the catalytic domain that binds C19
steroid substrates in the proximity of the heme prosthetic
group critical in the activation of molecular oxygen and
subsequent substrate hydroxylation. The other essential
component is the redox partner flavoprotein, NADPH
cytochrome P450 reductase. Interestingly, present data
show that both transcripts exhibited an under expression
during the rainbow trout preovulatory period, although it
should be confirmed that the identified clone is coding for

the oxydoreductase protein involved in the aromatase
complex.
Other cytochrome P450 genes
Two other cytochrome P450 genes, exhibiting similar
expression profiles were found in the same cluster. One
clone (# 194) was most similar to rat cytochrome P450
2J3 while the other one (# 202) putatively corresponded
to rainbow trout cytochrome P450 1A3 (cyp1a3). Cytochrome P450 1A proteins are ubiquitous proteins that
have been associated with the detoxification of several
organic compounds such as PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl), PAH (polyaromatic hydrocarbons), and dioxin [37].
In fish, these compounds are able to induce cyp1a gene
expression in a variety of tissues. In the rainbow trout
immature ovary, a constitutive expression of CYP1A protein was previously reported [38]. Together, previous and
present observations suggest that a CYP1A-related detoxification activity in the rainbow trout ovary. From the
under expression of cyp1a3 gene observed in the ovary
immediately prior to ovulation we could speculate that a
decrease of the detoxification activity of the ovary is
required before the beginning of the ovulation process. In
addition, it was previously shown in rat C6 glioma cells
that epoxygenases could inhibit prostaglandin E2 production [39]. Interestingly, C6 cells express epoxygenase

mRNAs, CYP1A1, CYP2B1 and CYP2J3, which convert
arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids; those epoxyeicosatrienoic acid being able to inhibit the activity of
cyclooxygenase [39]. The role of prostaglandins in the
ovulatory process has been thoroughly studied (see [40]
for review). Thus, in rainbow trout, prostaglandin F2α
was able to induce in vitro ovulation [21,41]. Therefore,
the observed down-regulation of cyp1a1 and cyp2j3 genes
in the ovary prior to ovulation is therefore totally consistent with available data on the participation of prostaglandins in the ovulatory process.
Ion/water transport genes
In the present transcriptomic analysis, two aquaporin 4
(aqp4) clones were found in cluster 3. Real-time PCR data
confirmed that rainbow trout aqp4 gene exhibited a strong
over expression in the preovulatory ovary. In mammals,
AQP4 is also known as mercurial insensitive water channel (MIWC). It was previously shown that water permeability was strongly increased in African clawed frog
oocytes expressing MIWC [42]. In marine fish, a strong
oocyte hydration occurs during oocyte maturation
[43,44]. In addition, it was recently shown that this oocyte
hydration involves an aquaporin1-like protein in seabream [45]. In freshwater species, data on oocyte hydration is more controversial. However, a limited but

significant hydration was also observed in several freshwater species including rainbow trout [46]. Our data suggest that, similarly to marine species, the oocyte hydration
occurring during oocyte maturation could also be
aquaporin-mediated in freshwater species such as rainbow trout. In addition to aqp4 gene, we also observed a
dramatic over expression of slc26 gene at the time of meiosis resumption. Solute carrier family 26 member 4
(slc26) is also known as sodium-independent chloride/
iodide transporters or pendrin. The over expression of
slc26 gene at the time of oocyte maturation is dramatic, as
demonstrated by real-time PCR. Together, the strong upregulation of aqp4 and slc26 genes at the time of meiosis
resumption stresses the importance of water and ion
transports in the rainbow trout preovulatory ovarian functions. In marine species, the major oocyte hydration
occurring before ovulation is probably important for
adjusting egg buoyancy. In contrast, in freshwater species
laying demersal eggs such as rainbow trout, it has been
hypothesized that the limited (25%) oocyte hydration
occuring before ovulation could be necessary for the completion of the ovulation process [46]. Thus, the increase of
oocyte volume could facilitate the rupture of the follicular
walls and subsequently, the release of the oocyte from its
follicular layers.
The neurophysial hormones arginine vasotocin (AVT)
and isotocin (IT) are the fish counterparts of argininevasopressin and oxytocin respectively. Vasotocin precursor and isotocin precursor cDNAs were previously cloned
in several fish species including chum salmon [47,48]. In
fish, AVT is involved in several physiological processes
including water conservation and excretion of electrolytes
[49]. However, existing data in fish correspond to the
local effect, in various tissues, of circulating AVT [49]. Surprisingly, we observed that AVT precursor (avt) mRNA is
expressed in the rainbow trout preovulatory ovary. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no evidence of non-neural
expression of avt mRNA in fish. In addition, it is noteworthy that we also observed a similar over expression of isotocin mRNA precursor in the ovary at the time of oocyte
maturation. Further investigations are needed to elucidate
the role of AVT and IT in the trout preovulatory ovarian
functions.
Inflammation- or ovulation-related genes
Ovulation is a complex process resulting in the release of
the oocyte from surrounding follicular layers. Since the
early eighties, the similarities between ovulatory and
inflammatory processes have been thoroughly discussed
[50-52] and it is now well accepted that mammalian ovulation is an inflammatory-like reaction. In fish, despite
numerous studies on the hormonal control of spawning,
the ovulatory process has been far less documented.

http://www.rbej.com/content/4/1/39

In mammals, ovulation is accompanied by broad-spectrum proteolysis and the implication of several classes of
proteases is well documented (see [53] for review). In salmonid fish, several proteases have been identified in the
periovulatory ovary [54]. In mammals, there is evidence
that mature ovarian follicles contain proteolytic enzymes,
including serine proteases. Indeed, serine proteases have
been implicated in both ovulatory and inflammatory
reactions (see [50] for review). In the present study, serine
protease 23 (sp23) gene appears progressively up-regulated during the preovulatory period. To our knowledge,
sp23 gene expression was never reported in the periovulatory ovary of any vertebrate species. However, we could
speculate that this protease participates in the rainbow
trout ovulatory process. Interestingly, our data showed
that adam22 metalloprotease-disintegrin gene was sharply
up-regulated at the time of oocyte maturation. The metalloprotease-disintegrin protein family (also known as
ADAMs: A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinases) is
thought to function in cell-cell interactions and in the
proteolysis of luminal or extracellular protein domains. In
mammals, several ADAMs family members are involved
in the ovulatory process. In brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), metalloprotease activity increases in the ovary prior to
ovulation [8,9]. Together, these observations also suggest
that adam22 also participates in the rainbow trout ovulatory process.
Mammalian CXC chemokines, named after a conserved
pattern of conserved cysteine residues, have been initially
identified as potent mediators of neutrophil chemotaxis
[55,56] and are also involved in chemotaxis of monocytes
and lymphocytes. They have also been implicated in angiogenesis and, later, in a large variety of functions[57,58].
In mammals, 16 CXC have been described. In Fish, however, several CXC have been identified but only CXCL12
and CXCL14 exhibit unambiguous orthologues [59]. In
the present study, we showed that cxcl14 gene expression
strongly increases during the preovulatory period. In catfish, RT-PCR data showed that cxcl14 gene was expressed
in a wide variety of tissues, including the ovary [60]. In
carp, quantitative PCR data showed that cxcl14 was predominantly expressed in the brain [61]. Despite its good
conservation throughout vertebrate evolution [59], the
number of studies addressing the in vivo role(s) of
CXCL14 is limited. As a consequence, a lot of information
is still unavailable in fish. In a murine model used to
study Crohn's disease, cxcl14 expression is induced during
inflammation [62]. Together, these observations suggest
that cxcl14 gene expression induction contributes to the
inflammatory-like events occurring in the rainbow trout
at the time of ovulation. To date the participation of this
gene in preovulatory ovarian functions was unsuspected.

In mammals, coagulation factor V participates in the coagulation process. In zebrafish, a coagulation factor V (cf5)
cDNA was previously characterized [63]. According to
these authors, several lines of evidences including biochemical and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the modern coagulation pathways found in mammals could also
be functional in fish. Furthermore, it was previously
shown that cultured rabbit macrophages were able to generate factor V procoagulant activity [64]. In the present
study, we observed a dramatic increase of cf5 gene expression in the ovary during oocyte maturation. However, no
significant difference was observed between late and postvitellogenesis. From these observations we could speculate that, immediately prior to ovulation, the trout ovary
secretes coagulation factors in order to prevent bleeding
from ruptured ovarian follicles at the time of ovulation.
Interestingly, the transcriptomic analysis showed that a
transcript exhibiting sequence similarity with clotting factor C (Clone # 251, Table 3) was also over expressed
immediately prior to ovulation.

(see [50] for review). Therefore, it can be hypothesized
that the observed increase of ace2 gene expression in the
trout preovulatory participates in the vascular dynamics
changes that are putatively occurring during the ovulatory
process.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves Angiotensin I (Ang I) to form Angiotensin II (Ang II). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently
described ACE homolog [65]. Both ACE and ACE2 are
zinc-dependent peptidases of the M2-metalloprotease
family. Within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2
competes with ACE because it is capable of hydrolyzing
Ang I into the nonapeptide Ang(1–9) [65]. In humans,
ace2 gene expression was predominantly detected by
Northern blot analysis in kidney, heart and testis [65,66].
In addition, a moderate expression was also observed in
several other tissues including the ovary [66]. Using semiquantitative RT PCR, a wide distribution was observed in
rat tissues [67]. In mammals, previous observations suggested that the renin-angiotensin system was functional in
the ovary. In cattle, a greater expression of Ang II was
observed in large follicles. In addition, several lines of evidence supported the idea of Ang II in blocking the inhibitory effect of theca cells on meiosis resumption of bovine
oocytes [68]. In brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) salmon
Ang I and human Ang II were both able to increase the
level of in vitro spontaneous ovulation [69]. In the present
transcriptomic study, we observed a dramatic increase of
ace2 gene expression during the preovulatory period. This
observation was confirmed by real-time PCR data.
Together, these observations suggest that the dramatic upregulation of ace2 gene immediately prior to ovulation is
important for the ovulatory process. In mammals, little is
know about the role of ACE2 in the ovary. However, it is
known in mammals that ACE2 can function as an Ang II
degrading enzyme, forming the vasodilatator peptide
Ang(1–7) [70,71]. Interestingly, a local vasodilatation is a
key characteristics of the inflammatory response that is
also observed during the mammalian ovulatory process

Conclusion

Genes involved in the synthesis of egg components
Cytidine
monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic
acid
hydroxylase (CMAH) is the key enzyme for the synthesis
of N-glycolylneuraminic acid. In salmonid eggs, cortical
alveoli contain polysialoglycoproteins (PSGP). In rainbow trout, it was previously shown that those PSGP contain N-glycolylneuraminic acid residues [72]. In the
present study we observed a significant decrease of cmah
gene expression at the time of oocyte maturation. While
the presence of cmah gene expression in the ovary is totally
consistent with the presence of N-glycolylneuraminic acid
in rainbow trout cortical alveoli content, it seems however
difficult to speculate on the dynamics of PSGP accumulation in the oocytes.

Our observations further confirmed that a progressive
shut down of estrogen synthesis genes expression occurs
in the ovary prior to meiosis resumption. In addition to
already well studied genes such as aromatase, the present
work shows that other genes exhibit a similar down-regulation, thus suggesting their participation in the preovulatory decrease of circulating estrogen levels.
In addition, we observed a strong up-regulation of ion/
water transport genes in the preovulatory ovary. The identity of those genes is consistent with the recent identification of aquaporin mediated mechanisms in the fish
oocyte hydration process and further supports the recent
description of a limited but significant oocyte hydration
occurring in the rainbow trout preovulatory ovary.
Finally, in addition to oocyte hydration-related genes, we
also observed a strong over expression of several genes
such proinflammatory factors, coagulation/clotting factors, vasodilatation factors and proteases in the ovary
immediately prior to ovulation. Together, these observations suggest that, similarly to the theory developed in
mammals, fish ovulation could also be compared ton an
inflammatory-like reaction. In addition, the identification
of those genes will allow specific studies leading to a better understanding of the ovulatory process in fish.
In the future, a global analysis of differentially regulated
genes, based on their ontologies, is needed to satisfyingly
describe preovulatory ovarian mechanisms. In addition, a
cellular localization of gene expression will contribute in
the understanding of their respective roles in the preovulaory ovarian physiology. Nevertheless, the present study

clearly demonstrates that distinct (i.e. steroidogenic, proteolytic, proinflammatory) but concomitant events occur
in the preovulatory ovary. Together, all those events concur to achieve the same goal which is the release, at the
time of ovulation, of a fully competent oocyte, ready to be
fertilized.
