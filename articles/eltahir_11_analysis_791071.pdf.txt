Analysis of chicken anemia virus genome:
evidence of intersubtype recombination
Yassir M Eltahir1,3, Kun Qian1, Wenjie Jin1 and Aijian Qin1,2*

Abstract
Background: Chicken anemia virus (CAV) is the causative agent of chicken infectious anemia. CAV putative
intergenotypic recombinants have been reported previously. This fact is based on the previous classification of CAV
sequences into three genotypes. However, it is unknown whether intersubtype recombination occurs between the
recently reported four CAV genotypes and five subtypes of genome sequences.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis, together with a variety of computational recombination detection algorithms, was
used to investigate CAV approximately full genomes. Statistically significant evidence of intersubtype recombination
was detected in the parent-like and two putative CAV recombinant sequences. This event was shown to occur
between CAV subgroup A1 and A2 sequences in the phylogenetic trees.
Conclusions: We revealed that intersubtype recombination in CAV genome sequences played a role in generating
genetic diversity within the natural population of CAV.

Background
Chicken anemia virus (CAV) was first reported in 1979 in
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens [1]. CAV belongs to
the Circoviridae and is a non-enveloped, icosahedral virus
with a negative-sense, single-stranded circular DNA. The
viral genome consists of 2.3 kb, with three partially overlapping open reading frames. CAV infection is an economically important clinical and subclinical disease in broiler
chickens, with a worldwide distribution [2].
CAV isolates show extremely limited genetic variability
worldwide [3]. All isolates of CAV are suspected to belong
to a single serotype [4]. Little is known about CAV genome recombination analysis. CAV putative intergenotype
recombinants have been reported to occurs in the virus
gene VP1 and results in a new virus genotype [5].
Recently, after adding more CAV approximately full
genome sequences to GenBank, CAV sequences arising
from different parts of world have been categorized into
four genotype groups (A-D) and five subtypes (A1, A2,
A3, D1 and D2) [6]. Therefore, the necessity of exploring
these CAV genotypes for evidence of recombination as
an important tool for genetic variability has been raised,

to establish if any would help in understanding the evolutionary process in the CAV genome.
Here, we report evidence of intersubtype recombination
based on sequence analysis of the entire coding regions
(VP1, VP2 and VP3) of CAV genomes.

Methods
Samples

DNA extraction, PCR screening, amplification of CAV
genome, cloning and sequencing were carried out as previously described, briefly, primers VP1F: 5’AGCCGACCCCGAACCGCAAGAA’3 and VP1R: 5’ TCA GGG
CTG CGT CCC CCA GTA CA’3 were used to amplify
the VP1 region and primers VP2F: 5’ GCG CAC ATA
CCG GTC GGC AGT’3 and VP2R: 5’ GGG GTT CGG
CAG CCT CAC ACT AT’3 were used to amplify the VP2
region [6] for 10 spleen samples collected between April
2010 and December 2010 at Yangzhou University Veterinary Hospital during necropsy. Samples originated from different commercial chicken farms in Anhui (n = 3) and
Jiangsu (n = 7) provinces. For each samples, DNA extraction and PCR was run at least twice. Animal experiments
were conducted in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Chinese Council on Animal Care. All experiments complied with institutional animal care guidelines

and were approved by University of Yangzhou Animal
Care Committee (protocol number 06R015).
Sequence analysis

To look for recombination in CAV sequences, we used 55
published full genomes sequences that are currently available in GenBank, together with 10 sequences characterized
in the present study. Multiple alignments of either CAV
full or subgenomic regions were performed and analyzed
using ClustalW [7]. Unrooted phylogenetic trees were
constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method, and
visualized and edited using MEGA 3.1 software [8]. The
evolutionary distances were estimated using the Kimura
two-parameter method. Bootstrap analyses were performed with 1,000 repeat samples of the data sets. To
reduce redundancy, isolates with previous reports of intergenotypic recombination [5] were excluded from analysis.
Identification of recombination

Recombination breakpoint events in the multiple alignments were detected with the Recombination Detection
Program 3 (RDP3), using the automated suite of algorithms implemented in the RDP3 with default settings.
These included RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, MaxChi,
Chimaera, SiScan, Phyl- Pro, LARD, and 3Seq [9,10]. For
the RDP algorithm, the reference sequence parameter
(internal and external reference) was used as recommended by the manual. The multiple-aligned sequences
were cut into sections at the positions where the putative
recombination breakpoints were identified, and phylogenetic analyses were carried out by MEGA 3.1 software [8].
Confirmation of recombination break points was further
carried out by bootscanning using SimPlot [11].

Results
Sequences accession numbers

CAV genome sequences characterized in this study were
submitted to GenBank with accession numbers [GenBank:
FR 850021, GenBank: FR 850022, GenBank: FR 850023,
GenBank: FR 850024, GenBank: FR 850025, GenBank: FR
850026, GenBank: FR 850027, GenBank: FR 850028, GenBank: FR 850029, GenBank: FR 850030].
Phylogenetic tree reconstructions

When an NJ phylogenetic tree was reconstructed, we
found that the high number of sequences included maintained the four genotype groups (A-D) and five subgroups
(A1, A2, A3, D1 and D2) topology that was present in
previously published trees (Figure 1) [6]. When the RDP,
GENECONV, Boot Scan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan, PhylPro, LARD, and 3Seq algorithms were used to detect
recombination in CAV whole genome sequences, only one
significant recombination event was detected. For this
event, seven out of nine algorithms detected significant

recombination at the same location in the CAV genome
with p values ranging from[6.215 × 10-07 to 4.544 × 10-2 ]
(Table 1). The location of two significant break points was
in the VP1 coding region (nt positions 768 and 1286) of
AN-China 13, which was considered as the daughter or
recombinant, with the major parent being the HQ872045
and the minor parent being JS-China 72.
Confirmation of recombination event

The region identified as containing the recombination
breakpoint was confirmed by comparing the phylogenetic
tree topologies of the entire CAV coding region without
the recombinant region. The tree topology was essentially
the same as for the whole genome. For the recombinant
region, changes in tree topology and decreases in distance
that separates the daughter (AN-China 13) and minor parent (JS-China 72) sequences were observed. AN-China 13
was located in subtype A2 in the tree constructed with the
non-recombinant region (Figure 2), and was found within
subtype A1 when the tree was developed with the recombinant region (Figure 3). Furthermore, when the recombinant minor parent and major parent sequences were
further analyzed, recombination was supplemented and
supported by identifying the two points of crossover by
Boot Scan and Distance plot (Figure 4, 5). In addition,
high similarity (99.3%) between AN-China 13 and JSChina 72 was observed.

Discussion
Recombination is one of the evolutionary processes that
shape the architecture of viral genomes. Ignoring the
occurrence of recombination may influence the analysis of
genetic data and the conclusions derived from it. Recombination analysis of CAV genomes is very limited. CAV
intergenotype recombination break points in the VP1
region have been reported in only a single study using 35
CAV full genomes sequences [5]. However, to date, there
is no evidence of inter- or intrasubtype recombination
between CAV genomes, to the best of our knowledge.
Therefore, the present study investigated CAV whole

genome sequences to explore the effect of recombination
in the genetic variation of CAV sequences.
Here, we report the first evidence of intersubtype
recombination events in CAV genome sequences amplified from two different areas (Anhui and Jiangsu provinces) in China. Intersubtype mosaic viruses are the
results of co-infection events in geographic regions where
multiple subtypes circulate [12,13]. Similarly, co-infection

with CAV that has been documented by sequencing electropherogram double peaks and cloning has also been
reported [14]. Moreover, intersubtype recombination in
other virus subtypes has also been reported [15,16].
Natural recombination in the VP1 of the CAV genome,
with a resultant new genotype, has suggested speeding up
of CAV evolution [5]. However, it should be noted that
these findings were based on a limited number of CAV

sequences and the previous categorization of CAV
sequences into three genotypes. In contrast, despite adding more sequences here, we confirmed that CAV genomes can be categorized into their recent four genotype
groups (A-D) and five subtypes (A1, A2, A3, D1 and D2)
[6].
The recombination breakpoints detected in CAV subgroup A1 and A2 sequences in the present study were also
found in the VP1 protein. This resulted in the sequence
from subgroup A2 being located within subgroup A1. It is
known that most nucleotide variation in the CAV genome
is observed in VP1, in addition to the fact that virulence of
CAV is also determined by VP1 [17,18]. The cumulative
evidence of recombination breakpoints in the VP1 of the
CAV genome may be indicative of favorable selection for
recombination in this variable region. Sequence variations
at specific sites between HIV-1 isolates have been reported
to introduce unique recombination hotspots and increase
recombination frequencies in the C3/V4 env region [19].
However, whether there is correlation between the highest
genetic variability in CAV genomes observed in the VP1
and recombination still needs to be investigated.

Conclusions
Using bioinformatics analysis, we were able to detect only
a single incidence of CAV intersubtype recombination
that contributed to CAV genetic variation. More detailed
analysis for further CAV intragenotypic recombination is
still required.
