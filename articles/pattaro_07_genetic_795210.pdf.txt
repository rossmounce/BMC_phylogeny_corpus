Abstract
Background: There is increasing evidence of the important role that small, isolated populations
could play in finding genes involved in the etiology of diseases. For historical and political reasons,
South Tyrol, the northern most Italian region, includes several villages of small dimensions which
remained isolated over the centuries.
Methods: The MICROS study is a population-based survey on three small, isolated villages,
characterized by: old settlement; small number of founders; high endogamy rates; slow/null
population expansion. During the stage-1 (2002/03) genealogical data, screening questionnaires,
clinical measurements, blood and urine samples, and DNA were collected for 1175 adult
volunteers. Stage-2, concerning trait diagnoses, linkage analysis and association studies, is ongoing.
The selection of the traits is being driven by expert clinicians. Preliminary, descriptive statistics
were obtained. Power simulations for finding linkage on a quantitative trait locus (QTL) were
undertaken.
Results: Starting from participants, genealogies were reconstructed for 50,037 subjects, going
back to the early 1600s. Within the last five generations, subjects were clustered in one pedigree

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/29

of 7049 subjects plus 178 smaller pedigrees (3 to 85 subjects each). A significant probability of
familial clustering was assessed for many traits, especially among the cardiovascular, neurological
and respiratory traits. Simulations showed that the MICROS pedigree has a substantial power to
detect a LOD score ≥ 3 when the QTL specific heritability is ≥ 20%.
Conclusion: The MICROS study is an extensive, ongoing, two-stage survey aimed at
characterizing the genetic epidemiology of Mendelian and complex diseases. Our approach,
involving different scientific disciplines, is an advantageous strategy to define and to study
population isolates. The isolation of the Alpine populations, together with the extensive data
collected so far, make the MICROS study a powerful resource for the study of diseases in many
fields of medicine. Recent successes and simulation studies give us confidence that our pedigrees
can be valuable both in finding new candidates loci and to confirm existing candidate genes.

Background
The importance of isolated populations for revealing the
genetic etiology of common diseases has been frequently
highlighted in recent years: the homogeneity of the shared
environmental factors and the limited number of recombination events in the DNA make isolates a valuable tool
for linkage and association studies [1-5]. Caution was suggested when the isolated population is very large, as in the
case of Sardinia and Finland, because the distribution of
linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the chromosomes can
be similar to that of the general population [6,7]. Nevertheless, when small isolates are concerned, there is
increasing evidence of their valuable contribution for
finding genes [3,8]. After the difficulties in identifying loci
for complex diseases in outbred populations, research on
small isolated populations could be a promising way for
discovering genotype-phenotype association [9].
Perhaps surprisingly, population isolates are not as rare as
it might be expected, and several isolates can be found
even within nations of the "old Europe" [10-14], where
several population admixture events have taken place over
the centuries. Indeed, allele and haplotype distributions
across Europe are very differentiated, especially where the
Italian peninsula is concerned [15]. Despite their position
in the middle of Europe, the Alps seem to be an interesting
area for studying genetic isolates [16-18].
Bolzano is the northern-most province of Italy. This province is known as South Tyrol because it is the Southern
part of the Tyrol region, split between Italy and Austria.
The geographical structure, historical, and political events
of this region resulted in the isolation of the population,
with scattered villages often located at the ends of remote
valleys. Two recent studies, one on the Y-chromosome
and mtDNA and autosomal Alu markers [19], the other
on the extent of LD on Xq13 [20], were designed to assess
the homogeneity of the genetic background of isolated
groups in South Tyrol. Beyond the ethnic and linguistic
differences, in some cases (the Ladin valleys), authors
found genetic heterogeneity even between valleys of the

same ethnic group, as confirmed by phylogenetic analysis.
The expression "microisolate" was used to distinguish
small subpopulations in remote, high valleys that have
conserved an even higher degree of isolation than the cultural and linguistic South Tyrolean isolate, in which they
are included [21].
As a part of a larger, ongoing genetic healthcare research
program on the South Tyrolean population (the GenNova
project), in 2002–2003, an extensive survey (the MICROS
study) was carried out on the populations of Stelvio, Vallelunga and Martello, three villages of the Val Venosta.
Among them, Stelvio was already classified as a genetic
microisolate [20]. The objective of the survey was to
screen the population for the presence of several traits by
collecting questionnaire-based information, pedigree
structure, clinical measurements and blood samples for
analyses. The study was intended as the first step of a comprehensive approach for the assessment of the genetics of
diseases affecting the South Tyrolean population.
The present article is intended to introduce the MICROS
study to the scientific community. We report some preliminary results, and future perspectives are discussed.

Methods
Selection of the microisolates
The villages of Stelvio, Vallelunga and Martello were
selected for their geographical and historical isolation and
for the presence of highly collaborative local general practitioners (GPs). At the time of the survey, the adult population (aged 18+ year old) numbered 1043 people in
Stelvio, 693 in Martell, and 339 in Vallelunga [22]. The
geographical location of the villages is presented in Figure
1.

The three villages were selected for study on the basis of
four criteria for isolation: i) evidence of an old settlement;
ii) a small number of founders; iii) high endogamy rates;
iv) slow or null population expansion and negligible
immigration. Of course, for verifying these criteria,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/29

documents identify a very restrict number of family
names accounting for the entire population; some of
them are still in use today [26].

another prerequisite was the availability and accessibility
of historical documentation.
Historical and demographic data on the evolution of the
Val Venosta verify that these regions satisfy the criteria for
isolation. Numerous archeological findings testify to a
broader human presence in the Alpine zone of South
Tyrol during the Mesolithic (10,000 years ago) [23]. In
1991 the mummy of a hunter, the so called "Iceman", was
discovered on a glacier of the Val Venosta: it was dated to
3300 BC [24]. Documented history of the area began with
the Roman conquest in 15 BC. The Latin invaders mixed
themselves up with the local tribes, the Raetians, an
Alpine population thatstood under influence of Etruscan
culture. After the breakup of the Roman Empire in 476
AD, tribes from Northern Europe moved to Italy ("barbaric invasions"); among them, Langobards, Bajuwars,
and Alamanni settled in South Tyrol. A period of intense
germanization took place during the high middle ages
(1000–1300 AD), peaking with the annexation of the
county of Tyrol to the Austrian Empire in 1363 [25].
During this period the permanent settlement of the Val
Venosta villages occurred, although there is evidence that
the remote valleys were known and used for hunting and
gathering already by the Raetians. The village of Stelvio
represents a partial exception, as there is evidence of settlement and mining activity as early as the Bronze Age
(2200-900 B.C.). Nevertheless, even in Stelvio the main
expansion took place within the process of enlargement of
the cropland, favored by the various landlords. Medieval

Major population bottleneck events recorded were the
plague epidemics in Europe during the 14th and 16th century [27,28]. The introduction of church records (Martello
and Vallelunga in 1636; Stelvio in 1642) testifies to the
presence of new settlers in the 17th century. Some of these
were farmers from the surroundings, but in Stelvio and
Martello they were mostly mine workers from nearby
Switzerland and northern Tyrol. This was the last wave of
immigration to these villages before a period of prolonged
emigration, caused by the severe poverty, started in the
19th century. People followed different migration patterns
and moved to the nearby towns and cities, to other European countries, and to the United States [29]. From the
first decade of the 1800s the population was stable or
slightly decreasing [30,31]. The high fertility rate of nearly
six children per woman counterbalanced the emigration
from the valleys. A temporary increase in the population
size was observed only for Stelvio, due to the development of tourism in the villages of Solda and Trafoi at the
end of the 19th century, before a steep decline in population began. The last big emigration occurred during the
period under fascist rule that followed South Tyrol's
annexation to Italy in 1919 [32]. The presence of Italian
speakers in the villages has always been very limited: after
the last census (2001) it was 0.70% of the total population in Martello, 2.33% in the municipality of Curon
(which includes Vallelunga) and 2.26% in Stelvio [31].
Analysis of the marriage behavior during the past centuries reveals a strong tendency to endogamy together with
a significant percentage of consanguineous unions. However, it should be noted that the vast majority of consanguineous marriages occurred between distant relatives,
and that an avoidance of close relatives' marriage has been
observed [33]. The marriage behavior did change only
with the improvement of the transportation facilities after
World War II. Nevertheless, most of the exogamous marriage partners are from the Val Venosta even today (i.e.: no
admixture with Italian speaking populations).
Isolation still plays a role in these communities. Mining is
no longer an industry in South Tyrol, and these villages
have no economic inducements for immigration. Tourism
is the leading resource and agriculture is declining. Population is stable or slightly decreasing [22], and very limited
admixture seems to be occurred.
The study of the history of Val Venosta population across
the centuries suggested that the Val Venosta area could be
classified as a secondary isolate, that is an isolate that, after
being detached from a larger population, "derived from a

BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8:29

relatively small population sample, which then slowly expands,
with very little recruitment from outside the group" [34].
Within this region, we are studying in detail three isolated
units, named microisolates.
MICROS-stage 1. Subject enrollment, study setting and
data collection
Inhabitants of the target villages were invited, by public
advertisement (posters, newspapers, flyers), to attend a
meeting with the community mayor, the local GPs, and
the scientists leading MICROS. The meeting was designed
to give the population a clear understanding of the motivations and importance of MICROS, and to outline how
the study would be performed, including the risks and
possible benefits to research participants and the community. It was stressed in the meeting that participation was
to be on a purely voluntary basis. During the event, the
field team (a trained group comprising an expert physician, a nurse, and one to three graduating medical students) was introduced to the population. A call center was
established for scheduling appointments. During the
appointment, the study was explained by a physician, and
a detailed information sheet and a form for the written
informed consent were provided to each prospective participant. The information sheet gave details regarding the
aims and nature of the study, specimen handling and storage. In particular, the information clearly stated the rights
of the participants to rigorous privacy measures (non-disclosure clause of personal identifiable data, access by the
participant to his/her personal data, right to change or
update the personal information provided) and the
study's opt-out clause, guaranteeing that every participant
may withdraw at any time from the study, for any reason
and without consequences. To implement this right, the
project has in place several information strategies to keep
the communities updated about the development of the
research. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano. Every six
months the Committee is informed of any changes or
developments.

A standardized, interviewer-administered questionnaire
was submitted to the participants. The questionnaire was
structured as follows: i) reconstruction of family history
(pedigree); ii) questions about cardiology, angiology,
neurology, psychiatry, ophthalmology, endocrinology,
respirology, dermatology, allergy, internal medicine,
hematology, oncology, gynecology (for women participants), and injuries due to accidents; iii) life-style exposures (such as smoking habits, alcohol consumption). The
typical question occurring in any field of part ii of the
questionnaire was a closed question, allowing a yes/no/
don't know response. If the interviewing physician had
knowledge of whether the subject was affected, this could
be indicated, regardless the subject's answer. Subjects were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/29

asked the year or age of onset of their condition, they were
asked to add a free text description of symptoms (to allow
for identification of specific diseases or syndromes) and
they were questioned to determine if any relative had the
same trait.
Subjects underwent anthropometric measurements (such
as height, weight and waist measurements), respiratory
and ultrasound-based bone densitometry tests, dioptric
measurement of eyeglasses, ECG, and blood pressure
measurements. A urine sample was collected from each
participant, and blood samples were taken for DNA and
serum extraction, and for routine, biochemical analyses,
including blood count/differential blood count, Quick,
aPTT, ferritine, TSH, T4, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, electrolytes (K, Na, Ca), GPT, GOT, GGT, glucose,
and creatinine. A serum sample for each participant was
prepared and stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis.
Genomic DNA was isolated from 20 ml of EDTA-treated
blood, according to standard procedures [35]. DNA of all
1175 study participants was included in a genome-wide
scan performed by deCODE genetics, Iceland, using 1000
microsatellite markers (STRs) evenly spaced across the
genome at 4 cM intervals. deCODE's genome scan marker
sets are based on the Applied Biosystems HD-5 Linkage
Mapping Set and on in-house designed and validated
markers originally selected from the Marshfield genetic
map. Map order and position were determined from the
deCODE Icelandic genetic map [36].
Genealogical information was reconstructed by means of
church records (baptisms, marriages, death records, and
family books) reaching back to the early 17th century and
completed with municipality lists starting in 1924. We
started by reconstructing single families, that in a second
step were linked together to form genealogical trees of the
whole villages. Genealogical data were managed using
Cyrillic© 2.1 (CyrillicSoftware 2000, Wallingford, UK).
MICROS-stage 2. Specialist examination and genetic
analysis
Subjects are selected on the basis of a reported trait of
interest, then they are asked for further examination. As
far as possible, the information is extended to the pedigree
of the targeted subjects, after all the ethical aspects are
taken into account. In case of agreement, targeted patients
and relatives are diagnosed by an expert specialist. After
collecting the diagnoses, the genetics of the disease is
under study, starting with linkage analysis and subsequent association studies.
Database structure and privacy issues
Data are entered in an enterprise-level database on a webbase front end providing a wide range of tools for entering

Page 4 of 15

BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8:29

and querying subject information. The database design
was implemented in accordance with the Italian privacy
law. Personal identifying data are physically separated
from the other data and secured by anonymising methods. A unique code is given to each questionnaire and to
the specimens, which are stored in a secure room. A rolebased access policy guards access to the database. This system ensures that all information on individuals – genealogical, medical and genetic – is anonymised, identifiable
only by authorized persons, who are assigned different
levels of access rights to the database according to their
role in the research. Transaction logs are maintained to
record access to sensitive data. Servers are backed up
weekly on tapes and stored off-site in a fire-proof safe.
Furthermore, a java-api for the visual analysis of our complex data was implemented. It provides all the necessary
functionality for the interactive exploration and analysis
of our extended genealogies [37].
Statistical analysis
For the purposes of this study, birthplace was defined as
the village in which the subject's mother was living at the
time of the subject's birth. Educational level was classified
as "no school attended", "primary school" (from 6 to 10
year old), "middle school" (11–14), "vocational school"
(usually 15–17), "secondary school" (15–19), and university. Subjects were asked for their occupations in the life:
a maximum of four jobs could be reported, together with
the respective working periods. For the smoking habits
measure, subjects were defined as "never smokers" (never
smoked or smoked for less than 1 year), "past smokers"
(stopped smoking more than 1 year before the date of the
interview) and "current smokers". Alcohol consumption frequency was classified as rarely (never or seldom), often (1
to 4 times per week), daily.

Prevalence and 95% exact confidence intervals (95%CIs)
were estimated for the main binary traits. For each trait,
the probability of familial clustering (PFC) was assessed
through the estimation of a chi-square statistic, which
compares the observed with the expected distribution of
affected siblings [38,39]. To this aim, we used the GAP
software package under R 2.3.1 [40]: due to the high
dimensionality of the tables, the enumeration of all possible scenarios was not possible, thus simulated p-values
were estimated via Monte Carlo permutations (10 million
runs).
Inter-village homogeneity of subject's characteristics and
study traits was assessed through chi-square test or F-test,
depending on the variable being qualitative or quantitative. Homogeneity of quantitative traits between sex and
age classes (18–30, 30–50, 50–70, 70+) was determined
using the Kruskal-Wallis test.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/29

Thanks to the collection of extended genealogical trees for
the three villages from church and municipal records, and
from information on a small number of marriages
between two of the three villages, we were able to build a
pedigree including participants from all three villages. The
accuracy of the pedigree structures was verified by checking available genotype data for Mendelian inconsistencies
using Pedstats 0.6.8 [41].
The power of variance component linkage analysis to
detect a QTL was assessed via simulation using the SOLAR
software package [42]. A biallelic locus was assumed, with
minor allele frequency ranging from 0.01 to 0.50; narrow
heritability (h2) was assumed taking values from 0.10 to
0.60; QTL-specific heritability ranged from 0.05 to h2,
with 0.05 increments. Since the average inter-marker distance was 4 cM, we assumed the marker be located at 0, 1
or 2 cM, respectively, from the QTL. Simulations were replicated on pedigrees from each single village separately
and on the whole pedigree after splitting it with the Greffa
software [43]. A LOD-score cutoff of 2 was taken as indication of suggestive linkage, a LOD-score of 3 was taken as
a cutoff threshold for significant linkage [44].

Results
Data were collected from September 2002 to December
2003. A total of 1175 volunteers were enrolled in the
study, 509 from Stelvio (percentage of the total population: 48%), 351 from Martello (51%) and 315 from Vallelunga (93%). We obtained screening questionnaire,
clinical measurements and genotypic data from each participant.
Complete genealogy was reconstructed for 50,037 individuals, starting from the participants and going back to
the 1600s (15 generations). When, for analysis issues, we
limited the extension of the pedigree to five generations,
10,630 individuals were included, grouped into 178 pedigrees. One thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two singletons were discarded because it was impossible to
include them in any pedigree. One of the 178 pedigrees
accounted for 7049 subjects; in the remaining 177 pedigrees, the median number of subjects per pedigree was 8
(range: 3–85). Overall, mean inbreeding coefficient was
0.000565 (standard deviation, sd = 0.004441) and mean
kinship coefficient was 0.001777 (sd = 0.014439). When
considering village-specific pedigrees, for Vallelunga, Martello, and Stelvio, the mean inbreeding coefficient was
0.000432 (sd = 0.002213), 0.000172 (sd = 0.001367) and
0.000112 (sd = 0.003625), respectively, and the mean
kinship coefficient was 0.002228 (sd = 0.014822),
0.002317 (sd = 0.015773), and 0.000806 (sd =
0.012370), respectively.

Participant's characteristics
The birthplace of participants, their parents and grandparents was recorded: 85% of subjects from Martello, 77%
from Vallelunga and 59% from Stelvio were born from a
mother who was living in the same village where they
were residing at the time of the interview. When extending
the area to the Val Venosta, we observed that the percentage of people born in the valley was 89% (Stelvio) to 99%
(Vallelunga). A similar pattern was observed for the parent's and grandparent's generations (Figure 2).

Occupation
Overall, 19.4% were employed in tourism, with noticeable differences between villages (24.9% in Stelvio, 15.0%
in Vallelunga). In Vallelunga, the leading sector was agriculture (18.8%). Many people (in particular women)
worked at home as housewives. The second most common category of occupation (13.9%) was manual trades,
typical of small villages: bricklayers, carpenters, electricians, etc. Ninety-five percent of participants held the
same occupation throughout life.

Distribution of subject's characteristics is reported in
Table 1. Subjects ranged in age 18–88 years (mean = 46.0,
sd = 16.3), 56.5% were female. The sex/age distribution
was homogeneous between the three villages.

Smoking habits
We observed a differential distribution of smoking habits
between the two sexes (p < 0.001). Percentage of never
smokers was lower for younger males than for older
males, but higher for younger females than older females.
Overall the smoking prevalence decreased with decreasing
age. Smoking habits were homogeneous across villages (p
= 0.1635).

Overall, 52.1% of participants went to school until they
were 13 years old, 17.4% completed secondary school
and 3.9% had a higher degree. The educational level was
non homogeneous between villages (p = 0.0003). On
average, males had a higher level of education than
females (p-value < 0.001) and education was related to
age (p-value < 0.001): secondary school or university were
attended by 3% of the 70+ year old participants, and by
49% of the 18–30 year old participants.

Qualitative traits
Distribution of qualitative traits, by village, is reported in
Table 2.
Symptoms for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
Elevated blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, and angina
pectoris were the most common disorders; all the three
with a non-homogeneous distribution across villages.
Prevalence of these symptoms steeply increased with age.
The percentage of women reporting symptoms was higher
than males, but this difference varied with age. Cardiac
disease was reported by 2.5% (95%CI: 1.7–3.6%) of subjects, with 1.2% (95%CI: 0.6–2.0%) having had a myocardial infarction. Interestingly, 36 subjects reported heart
defects, such as heart failure and coronary heart disease
(3.2%, 95%CI: 2.3–4.4%). The last three symptoms were
homogeneously distributed across villages. For all the
CVD symptoms, Martello had the highest prevalence. For
sex-age specific distribution of the main CVD symptoms
[see additional file 1].
Neurological traits
The most frequent neurological symptoms were vertigo
and migraine. Migraine prevalence was higher in Martello

and Vallelunga than in Stelvio (p = 0.0244). Symptoms
compatible with carpal tunnel syndrome were reported by
14.8% (95%CI: 12.7–17.1%), with Vallelunga having
much higher prevalence than the other two villages (p =
0.0017). Prevalence of restless leg's syndrome (RLS) was
12.8% (95%CI: 10.9–14.8%). Three percent (95%CI:
2.0–4.0%) had vascular problems in the carotid arteries,
1.7% had a stroke (95%CI: 1.0–2.6%) and 2.0% (95%CI:
1.3–3.0%) suffered from epilepsy.
Symptoms related to the respiratory system, allergy and dermatology
Any episode of asthma in life was reported by 4.2%
(95%CI: 3.1–5.5%) of subjects; 5.2% (95%CI: 4.0–6.6%)
reported to have had chronic bronchitis and 8.3%
(95%CI: 6.8–10.0%) reported hay fever. At younger ages
asthma prevalence was higher in women than in men,
with the percentage increasing with age until more males
than females were affected by asthma after the age of 70.
A similar pattern of increasing prevalence with age was
observed for chronic bronchitis, but with females always
having a higher prevalence than males. An almost parallel
decreasing trend was observed for hay fever [see additional file 1]. Hypersensitivity to any insect was quite
common (12.7%, 95%CI: 10.9–14.7%). Four percent

(95%CI: 2.9–5.1%) reported eczema and 3.2% (95%CI:
2.3–4.4%) psoriasis. Eczema prevalence was lower in
Martello than in other villages (p = 0.0403).
Other symptoms
Diabetes prevalence was 3.6% (95%CI: 2.6–4.9%). Goitre
was present in 6.4% (5.1–7.9%) and gout or hyperuricemia in 3.5% (95%CI: 2.5–4.7%) of the sample. Eleven
percent (95%CI: 9.0–12.6%) reported gallbladder disease, 9.3% (95%CI: 7.7–11.1%) had ulcer and 6.3%
(95%CI:5.0–7.9%) had liver disease. Between village heterogeneity of liver disease was observed (p = 0.0102). Kidney disease was reported by 13.6% (95%CI: 11.7–15.7%)
and anemia by 6.5% (95%CI: 5.1–8.0%).
Probability of familial clustering
The hypothesis of random distribution of a trait across the
pedigree was rejected for all the traits related to CVD: the
p-values ranged from < 0.000001 for elevated blood pressure to 0.0295 for cardiac arrhythmias. When assessing
the likelihood of familial clustering within village, certain
heterogeneity was observed. Elevated blood pressure clustered in families in each of the three villages, but cardiac
arrhythmias was significantly clustered in families only in
Martello, and myocardial infarction as well. Familial clusters of myocardial infarction and heart defects were
observed in Stelvio and Vallelunga, but not in Martello.
Clusters of angina pectoris were assessed in Stelvio.
Among the neurological traits, vascular problems at the
level of carotid arteries had the strongest evidence of
familial clustering (p < 0.000001). Other traits clustering
in families were stroke, apoplexy, migraine, Alzheimer's
disease, CTS-like symptoms, and RLS. Similar to the case
of CVDs, some inter-village differences were observed.
While some symptoms were clustering in families in all of
the three villages (CTS, RLS, and migraine), in other cases
this evidence was related to one single village (e.g.:
stroke). Asthma, chronic bronchitis, and diabetes showed
evidence of familial clustering in Stelvio and Martello.
Ulcer and liver disease were clustering in families in Martello and Vallelunga. No evidence of familial clustering
was observed for kidney and gallbladder diseases. More
results are reported in Table 3.
Quantitative traits
Body Mass Index (BMI) differed between sexes and
increased with age (minimum median = 21 in 18–30 year

old women, maximum median = 28 in 70+ year old
women). Waist circumference was related to age, with
young males having bigger waist circumference than
young females. Among the other determinants for CVD,
diastolic and systolic blood pressure increased with age
(younger males had higher blood pressure than young
females, p < 0.00001). Cholesterol increased with age; in
the elderly, females had slightly higher values than males.
Mean High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) was 53 mg/dl (sd
= 13) in males, 64 mg/dl (sd = 14) in females. Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) increased with age: mean = 104
mg/dl (sd = 32) in 18–30 year old subjects, mean = 136
(sd = 31) in 70+ year old subjects. Triglycerides were heterogeneous between groups (sex and age, p-value <
0.000001), with median within 75–120 mg/dl. For distribution of CVD traits by age and sex [see additional file 2].
Within the CVD/kidney related traits, median blood
sodium level was 138–139 mEq/l and median potassium
level was in 4.2–4.3 mEq/l. Higher calcium levels were
observed in younger subjects and in males. Hemoglobin
was higher in males than in females. Mean creatinine was
0.98 mg/dl (sd = 0.15) in males and 0.79 mg/dl (sd =
0.15) in females. Regarding the intermediate phenotypes
for renal function, the distribution of albuminuria was
similar across sex-age groups (median within 6–7 mg/l,
quartile range: 5–15), with a peak in 70+ year old males,
who had the highest values (median = 11 mg/l, quartile
range: 8–23). Creatinuria was lower for the elderly and for
females: maximum median was 188 mg/dl in 18–30 year
old males; minimum median was 74 mg/dl in 70+ year
old females.
Fasting glucose was sex-age related, with median within
77–87 mg/dl; among 50+ year old subjects the variability
increased as well as hyperglycemia cases. Liver transaminases (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, GOT; glutamate pyruvate transaminase, GPT) and gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) had similar patterns: before the age
of 70, they were higher in males than in females, after
which levels converged to similar values [see additional
file 3].
Among anemia related traits, ferritin was higher for males
than females: in males the median ranged in 109–142 ng/
ml, with no age trend; in females the values increased
from a median of 22 in 18–30 year old subjects to 76 in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/29

the 70+ year old participants (the variability increasing as
well). Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration
(MCHC) decreased slightly with age (mean = 35 g/dl, sd
= 0.8). Red cell distribution width (RDW) was constant
until 50 year of age (median 12.3–12.4%), then increased
(median ≥ 12.90% after 70 years). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was homogeneous between groups (mean =
88 fl, sd = 5).
Immune system indicators exhibited little heterogeneity.
Neutrophils were homogeneous between sexes, with
small variations and no age trend (median = 48.0–54.2%,
with a peak in the 50–70 age class). Lymphocytes were
decreasing with age (women: median from 39.5 to 34.1%;
men: 38.1 to 31.7%), with females having higher values
than males. Heterogeneity (p = 0.00156) but no age trend

was observed for monocytes, with males having always
higher values than females (p < 0.00001). Median percentage of eosinophils was within 2.3–3.1, with significant sex-age heterogeneity. Basophils had median of 0.7%
(interquartile range: 0.5–1.0).
Statistically significant, between-village heterogeneity was
observed for all the studied traits but waist circumference,
GOT, and several hematological parameters (WBC, HGB,
MCV, RDW, PLT, MPV, PCT, and PDW).
Power of the pedigree for detecting linkage
We ran power simulation for the pooled pedigree (the
three villages together), for each one of the three villages
separately, and for the total pedigree after pedigree splitting.

When considering the pooled data, the power for localizing a QTL was substantial (Figure 3). When the narrow
heritability was above 30%, for a QTL-specific heritability
of around 18%, the probability to find a suggestive LODscore (that is, LOD ≥ 2) was 80%. The pedigree had 80%
of power to find a LOD-score ≥ 3, the threshold for detecting linkage, for QTLs with 22% of specific heritability.
By pooling all the samples together, we were making the
assumption that people from the three microisolates
share the same variants with the same frequencies and,
consequently, the same effects. In the case that the three
microisolates are genetically differentiated, this assumption could be unrealistic. In addition, running a linkage
analysis on pedigrees with size 7049 could be unfeasible
for computational power limitations. For these reasons
we ran more simulations for each microisolate separately.
We obtained the best results when analyzing the Vallelunga pedigree, probably because the collection of the
93% of the total inhabitants allowed a better pedigree
reconstruction. In Figure 4 we report the power curve for
the Vallelunga pedigree when h2 = 0.60. Red and blue
lines indicate the probability to find a LOD-score ≥ 3 and
≥ 2, respectively. Power curves for markers placed 0 (continuous line) and 2 (shaped line) cM apart from the QTL
are plotted. The grey area within the curves indicates the
differential power at different marker-QTL distances. As
long as the average microsatellite spacing is 4 cM, it is
worth noting that placing the marker at 2 cM from the
QTL corresponds to the worst scenario, while 0 cM corresponds to the best one. Depending on location, we
observed 80% probability to find a LOD-score ≥ 3 for
QTLs with specific heritability from 0.31 (0 cM) to 0.35 (2
cM). When the QTL specific heritability is 25 (0 cM) to 28
(2 cM), the Vallelunga pedigree has 80% power to find a
suggestive linkage signal (LOD-score ≥ 2).

Discussion
MICROS is an extensive, population-based survey on
three German-speaking microisolates of South Tyrol, with
the goal of genetic characterization of the most relevant
traits for this population. In this paper we described the
first stage of the survey, the study design and the data collection. As described in the methods section, a second
stage is necessary to study the traits in a greater detail and,
possibly, to recruit subjects that did not participate in the
first phase, so that families could be completed. The second assessment phase requires contacting the GPs and the
targeted families, in order to narrowly define specific phenotypes. To narrow the phenotype definition, subjects are
then re-examined by specialists for the medical fields of
interest.
Among the strengths of the MICROS study, the interdisciplinary scientific team is one of the most important. The
interconnection between historians and biologists-geneticists was the first step toward the targeting of the microisolates.
Moreover,
geneticists,
ethicists
and
epidemiologists had a key role in the design of the survey.
The correct data processing is being guaranteed by the bioinformatics core. At the same time, research is ongoing on
all of these fields.
After demonstrating the historical isolation of South Tyrol
across the centuries, we concluded that this isolation still

When simulating power for QTLs with different minor
allele frequencies (MAF), we did not observe any particular relationship between MAF and power.
Finally, we considered the option to analyze the pooled
dataset after splitting the big pedigrees into smaller ones.
Under the constraints of pedigree size ≥ 3 and kinship
coefficient ≥ 0.0000125, we obtained the entire sample be
split into 78 pedigrees, with 4 to 397 subjects each (mean
= 29, median = 13). The average mean kinship coefficient
was 0.13 (min = 0.02, max = 0.25). This approach had the
advantage to consider all the three villages together while
enormously reducing the computational time. Unfortunately, despite these major advantages, the estimated
power was lower than considering the Vallelunga microisolate alone, for all the described scenarios.

We have listed a number of traits, classifying qualitative
symptoms by those categories which will be the most relevant for the involved clinicians. Interestingly, many common traits showed a significant probability of familial
clustering. On the one hand, we observed some traits clustering in families within all three villages (e.g.: elevated
blood pressure and some neurological traits); on the other
hand, familial clusters were observed only in one or two
villages as, for example, the case of angina pectoris,
migraine, asthma, and liver disease. Familial clustering
can be driven by allelic homogeneity or common life
style. The combination of these two factors must be carefully evaluated for each single trait under study and simplyfing assumption on the allelic distribution cannot be
done.

plays an important role in the microisolates; the analysis
of demographical records highlighted that the population
is very stable and the absolute number of inhabitants
almost the same across the years [22]. We demonstrated
that participants were used to live in the same place where
they were born (Figure 2). Between 90 and 100% of the
subjects were born within the Val Venosta, making this
aggregate like a closed community. This custom was confirmed also for the parental and grandparental generations. The preference for the birthplace had, in our
population, higher rates than in other very isolated populations such as those living in Sardinia [45]. The high percentage of endogamy and of consanguineous unions
observed in these villages [33] could be a consequence of
this temporal closeness. The temporal stability was also
reflected in the occupational status of the participants:
95% never changed jobs within their lifetime. People
moved very rarely from home and then only for short
periods. In fact, the number of people with an university
degree was negligible, perhaps also because the closest
university was over 100 km far away.
All these features lead us to consider the possibility of
upper Val Venosta itself as a secondary isolate [34] with

Until now, we have not performed further investigations
on the qualitative traits obtained through the screening
questionnaire, because these traits are intended to serve as
indicators of the possible presence of specific phenotypes,
which will be investigated in the second stage of the study.
At that stage, clinical diagnoses will be performed, and
pedigrees will be reconstructed starting from affected subjects. This was the case for RLS which was assessed in a
greater detail with clinical diagnosis by a movement disorder specialist and successive linkage analysis [21]. A
genome-wide linkage scan was carried out, which led to
the discovery of a novel locus on chromosome 2q [16],
thus suggesting the potential in our pedigree for detecting
qualitative trait loci.
Regarding the power to detect QTLs, the MICROS study
has a potentially high power when pooling data from the
three villages. Unfortunately, this potentially big power is
bounded by the limited computational power of linkage
analysis softwares. Nevertheless, the power resulting from
the Vallelunga pedigree of finding LOD-scores ≥ 2 is
encouraging and suggests that the villages of Martello and
Stelvio could be considered as replication samples for
common variants. The results also suggest that some
efforts should be spent in second phase studies for phenotyping and genotyping new individuals, related to the current participants, especially from Martello and Stelvio.
Currently, this strategy is being pursued.
The collected sample will also serve for association studies, while controlling for disease specific determinant and
effect confounders. We expect that the assessment of phenotype-genotype association could be favoured by the
high extent of linkage disequilibriumobserved in the villages [20]. Methods taking into account the non inde-

pendence of observations are now available, such as
family based association methods [46] and general linear
and non linear mixed effect models. So, especially for
quantitative traits, genowide association scans would be a
valid tool to detect causal alleles.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/29

uals may share a small number of disease alleles. Recent
successes and simulation studies give us confidence that
our pedigrees can be valuable both in finding new candidates loci and to confirm existing candidate genes.

Competing interests
In the case of Vallelunga, where the sample was 93% of all
the inhabitants, data will allow researchers to assess the
global health of population living in the village, with
interesting issues for public health. The observed heterogeneity in the distribution of several qualitative and quantitative traits suggests that, for both linkage and
association studies, covariates such as age, sex and environmental factors should be taken into account. Adjustment or stratification may be required, depending on the
specific situation.
Within the neurological diseases, further assessment on
the RLS is ongoing. In addition, as one out of five participants was affected by migraine, a new research branch on
this disease is to be started. At the moment, a questionnaire for the assessment of migraine is under validation.
In case of positive response, it will be used to assess
migraine in the study subjects. Subjects reporting
migraine have been targeted together with relatives which
did not participate in the first phase. Following this, a
comprehensive study of the genetic epidemiology of this
disease and genome-wide linkage analyses will be undertaken.

Additional material
Genome-wide scans will allow detailed investigation of
nephrological diseases, and of gall bladder disease, in particular gall stone formation. Chronic kidney disease
(CKD) will be studied by means of a quantitative trait, the
glomerular filtration rate (GFR), obtained from serum
and urine creatinine measurements. Epidemiology of
CKD will be explored particularly in the isolated village of
Vallelunga, where we have a sample which is representative of the population. Moreover, linkage analysis will be
performed together with an association study with environmental and genetic factors.

Conclusion
Our approach, involving different scientific disciplines,
seems an advantageous strategy to define and study small
population isolates. Priming of the population and support by the local GPs is a prerequisite to ensure a high participation rate. The isolation of the Alpine populations
that we included in our study together with the extensive
data collection make the MICROS study a powerful
resource for the study of diseases in many fields of medicine. It is a promising strategy to ascertain extended pedigrees ensuring a homogeneous environment. Linkage
disequilibrium and historical data from the South Tyrol
region, and the small isolated villages suggest that individ-
