Abstract
Background: Lysosomal b-D-mannosidase is a glycosyl hydrolase that breaks down the glycosidic bonds at the
non-reducing end of N-linked glycoproteins. Hence, it is a crucial enzyme in polysaccharide degradation pathway.
Mutations in the MANBA gene that codes for lysosomal b-mannosidase, result in improper coding and
malfunctioning of protein, leading to b-mannosidosis. Studying the location of mutations on the enzyme structure
is a rational approach in order to understand the functional consequences of these mutations. Accordingly, the
pathology and clinical manifestations of the disease could be correlated to the genotypic modifications.
Results: The wild-type and inherited mutations of b-mannosidase were studied across four different species,
human, cow, goat and mouse employing a previously demonstrated comprehensive homology modeling and
mutational mapping technique, which reveals a correlation between the variation of genotype and the severity of
phenotype in b-mannosidosis. X-ray crystallographic structure of b-mannosidase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron
was used as template for 3D structural modeling of the wild-type enzymes containing all the associated ligands.
These wild-type models subsequently served as templates for building mutational structures. Truncations account
for approximately 70% of the mutational cases. In general, the proximity of mutations to the active site determines
the severity of phenotypic expressions. Mapping mutations to the MANBA gene sequence has identified five
mutational hot-spots.
Conclusion: Although restrained by a limited dataset, our comprehensive study suggests a genotype-phenotype
correlation in b-mannosidosis. A predictive approach for detecting likely b-mannosidosis is also demonstrated
where we have extrapolated observed mutations from one species to homologous positions in other organisms
based on the proximity of the mutations to the enzyme active site and their co-location from different organisms.
Apart from aiding the detection of mutational hotspots in the gene, where novel mutations could be diseaseimplicated, this approach also provides a way to predict new disease mutations. Higher expression of the
exoglycosidase chitobiase is said to play a vital role in determining disease phenotypes in human and mouse. A
bigger dataset of inherited mutations as well as a parallel study of b-mannosidase and chitobiase activities in
prospective patients would be interesting to better understand the underlying reasons for b-mannosidosis.

Background
b-D-mannosidase is a lysosomal exoglycosidase that
belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family. By hydrolyzing
the single b-linked mannose residue at the non-reducing
end of all N-linked glycoproteins, it serves as the last
catalyst in the glycanic moieties degradation pathway of
glycoconjugates [1]. Genetic information of b-D-mannosidase is stored in a gene called MANBA, which is
located on different positions in different species [2]. In
human, MANBA is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q22-q25) [2]. Mutations in MANBA result in
b-mannosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder where the
activity of b-mannosidase is reduced or completely
demolished [3].
b-mannosidosis is a rare autosomal recessive disease
that was first diagnosed in Nubia goat [4], and later in
human [3,5] and domestic cow [6]. It is characterized by
excessive accumulation of (di)-saccharides or (tri)-saccharides in lysosomes [7], and the phenotypic expressions vary across the three species. In ruminants, all the
mutations are homozygous and enzyme defects result in
severe neonatal conditions, which are usually lethal
without intensive care [8]. The affected animals suffer
from inability to rise, tension tremors, facial dysmorphism, slight domed calvaria and prognathism, marrow
palpebral fissures and carpal contractures [4,6]. In
human, b-mannosidosis can either be homozygous or
heterozygous, and the clinical conditions are reasonably
milder. The ages of onset vary from infantile to 24 years
old. Some typical phenotypes include (but are not limited to) hearing loss, mental retardation, angiokeratomas
and facial dysmorphism [3,9]. Although only 21 cases
from 17 families are reported to date, the number of
incidents can be much higher, as a carrier with mild or
non-typical symptoms would never be diagnosed.
Despite several attempts to study the genotypes and
phenotypes of b-mannosidosis, no correlation between
them has been established [7,10].
Studying the effects of mutations on the protein structure provides a better understanding of the clinical manifestations of the disease by enhancing the knowledge of
the finer aspects of its pathology. Despite the fact that
no 3D structure has been solved for mammalian b-mannosidase, such an approach has been proved adequate
by Khan and Ranganathan[11] to demonstrate the
pathological role of mutations. Therefore, we have
employed structural bioinformatics to examine how
changes at the genetic level affect the phenotypic
expression in b-mannosidosis.
Mutational information was obtained from OMIA
(Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals) [12], OMIM
(Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) [13] and published literature. Among a total of 14 disease-associated

Page 2 of 13

mutations reported in human, majority (7) are nonsense
mutations [7], with only one case of insertion [14] and
two cases of deletions [9,15] being identified to date.
The nonsense, insertion and deletion mutations cause
truncations at the protein level. Four missense mutations leading to substitutions at the protein level have
also been identified in human. In cow and goat, only 1
mutation was identified for each species, both of which
were nonsense mutations [8,16]. The nonsense mutation
in goat however, is similar to the one reported in
human, both of which cause truncation of the protein
chain at the same residue (W466). Though springbok
was listed in OMIA for b-mannosidosis, it was excluded
from this study due to lack of evidence on whether aor b-mannosidase deficiencies were responsible for the
observed phenotypes [17]. On the other hand, wild-type
b-mannosidase from mouse was included in this project
despite not being listed on OMIA, since a gene-knockout model of mouse was recently used for b-mannosidosis study in human [18].
An X-ray structure of b-mannosidase from Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron (Protein Data Bank [19] – PDB ID:
2JE8) [20] was selected as the template for 3D model
building, since no mammalian structure of the enzyme
is currently available. The structure of b-mannosidase
from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has been solved at a
good resolution of 1.70 Å and R-free of 0.188 [20].
Being so distant from mammalian enzymes in the phylogenic tree, bacterial b-mannosidase only shares an average of 35% sequence identity with the mammalian
enzymes (obtained by performing a NCBI BLASTp [21]
search across the PDB). However, the overall 3D structure of a protein, especially that of enzymes, is known
to be highly conserved across species [22] with a
requirement of only 25% sequence identity for homology
model building [23], thereby suggesting that homology
modeling can be utilized as an adequate tool for this
study. Moreover, all the active site residues of b-mannosidase are conserved among all the species involved in
this study. This suggests functional similarities to the
enzymes in the different species studied here.
In this paper, we have extended our previously
reported structural bioinformatics analysis method [11]
to study b-mannosidosis across four species: cow, goat,
human and mouse, in order to understand the effect of
mutations on b-mannosidase structure and function.
Within the scope of this study, splicing events are eliminated. b-mannosidosis is inherited in a homozygous
recessive manner in ruminants. However, it can be the
result of a single mutation or multiple mutations on different chromosomes in human. Thus, the peripheral
effects are greatly diverged making it extremely important to conduct an in-depth investigation to understand

Huynh et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12(Suppl 3):S22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/S3/S22

the genotype-phenotype correlation for this disease. This
disease can be comparatively well studied as it occurs in
different species. This provides us with an evolutionary
basis for the conserved regions of the protein sequence,
as well as active site conservation, where mutations
could result in disastrous consequences. Our comprehensive analysis establishes a genotype-phenotype correlation for b-mannosidosis, contrary to the reports by
Riise et al., [7] and Gort et al., [10]. We report five
potential mutational hot-spots within the MANBA gene
sequence where novel mutations could be disease-implicated. Based on the proximity of the mutations within
these hot-spots to the protein active site, the severity of
the pathological effects or the disease phenotypes: mild,
moderate or severe (deduced from known mutations
and disease phenotypes), could also be determined.

Materials and methods
The principle underlying homology modeling is that
protein structure is better preserved during evolution
than their sequence [23]. Therefore, homology modeling
has been previously applied by our group to derive a
strong genotype-phenotype correlation in a-mannosidosis [11]. Motivated by our success with a-mannosidosis
and based on the observation that the active sites of bmannosidase are conserved from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to mammals, homology modeling has once again
been employed as a powerful and reliable method for
building 3D structural models of the enzyme for the
four species (cow, goat, human and mouse). b-mannosidase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron[20] has been
used as a template for all the mammalian wild-type
(WT) models. Unlike a-mannosidase that undergoes
cleavage into five distinct chains [11], b-mannosidase is
immune to such proteolysis and assembles into a single
chain functional protein.
b-mannosidase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron[20]
has two identical chains, chain A and B. Chain B had the
most number of residues (841) compared to chain A
(837) and the maximum number of associated ligands
(nine) [20] amongst the two chains. Therefore, only
chain B was used for modeling along with the associated
ligands. In order to build high-quality homology models,
it is crucial to obtain correct alignments between the
amino acid sequence of the template structure and that
of the target sequences. Three-dimensional models of the
mature wild-type b-mannosidase were constructed for
each of the 4 species: cow, goat, human and mouse.
These WT models were subsequently utilized as templates to build the respective mutated models. Although
the structural model for the mouse WT sequence was
built, no mutational models were built for mouse due to
the lack of data on mouse mutations causing b-mannosidosis. Therefore, mutational analyses for mouse could

not be performed. However, based on the mapping of
mutations, mutational co-location from other organisms
(cow, goat and human) and their propinquity to the
active site of the enzyme, we have predicted mouse mutations that could cause harmful phenotypes. The overall
methodology utilized in this investigation is similar to the
one previously reported by Khan and Ranganathan [11].
Data collection

Complete WT lysosomal b-mannosidase protein
sequences were obtained from the UniProt database
[24], one each for bovine (Accession No: Q29444), goat
(Accession No: Q95327), human (Accession No:
O00462) and mouse (Accession No: Q8K2I4). The template sequence was retrieved from the X-ray crystal
structure of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron b-mannosidase (PDB ID: 2JE8) [20] using MODELLER [25].
Preliminary assessment

ClustalX [26] was used with default BLOSUM scoring
matrices for the alignment of the full-length WT protein
sequences of the four species to the extrapolated
sequence of the template PDB structure [20]. Prior to
alignment, signal peptides (about 19 N-terminal amino
acids in mouse and 17 in the other species as annotated
by UniProt) were excised from the WT protein
sequences, owing to their absence in the mature template protein structure. In view of a few residues missing
from the template PDB structure and in order to conserve chain boundaries along with structurally and functionally important residues, manual edition of gaps in
the alignment was carried out with careful scrutiny.
3D structural modeling

Previously, we have reported the superiority of MODELLER over other homology modeling softwares given the
complexities involved in 3D protein structure modeling,
especially the inclusion of ligands [11]. Therefore, MODELLER version 7V7 was employed to construct all the
homology models used in this study. The models are built
upon optimal satisfaction of dihedral angle restraints and
spatial constraints that are derived from the alignment of
the target sequence and the template structure [27]. These
dihedral angle restraints and spatial constraints along with
the CHARMM-22 [28] force field enforce proper stereochemistry. For each of the WT and mutated models, five
structural models were generated. After performing
stereo-chemical quality assessment and structural refinement, three models with the best objective functions, out
of the five, were chosen and one model with the lowest
current energy amongst these three was subsequently
selected for structural analysis. These high-quality WT
structures were subsequently used as templates for constructing all the mutational models. For truncation

mutations that are caused as a result of a frame-shift in the
MANBA gene sequence, WT mRNA sequences were
retrieved from the NCBI Gene [29] database and the
nucleotide insertion causing the respective frame-shift was
manually carried out. Following this, the mutated mRNA
sequences were translated into protein sequences, using
the DNAProtein Translate tool [30]. Subsequently, the
frame with methionine as the first residue was selected for
molecular modeling.
Unlike a-mannosidase where two additional disulfide
bridges were built by Khan and Ranganathan [11] for
mutational analyses, there is no annotated evidence of
disulfide bonds in UniProt for all WT b-mannosidase
sequences. Hence, we have not included any disulfide
bridges in our models. However, nine ligands existed in
the template structure. Thus, to dissect the effect of the
observed mutations on the binding of the ligands, we
have rebuilt all the ligands in our b-mannosidase models
(Figure 1) for the four species by extrapolating their
structural coordinates and positional information from
the template structure. UniProt also does not provide
any information about putative pro-peptide regions for
b-mannosidase from all the four species. Thus, we have

not incorporated any pro-peptides in our structural
models. A number of water molecules were present in
the template structure, most of which were surface
water molecules of crystallization[20]. However, none of
the internal water molecules were within 4Å distance
from either the ligands or the active site residues. Moreover, none of them were reported to be functionally critical [20]. Hence, this analysis does not include any
water molecules.
Both structural visualization and Root Mean Square
Deviation (RMSD) calculation was done using PyMol
[31]. The Protein Structure Validation Suite, which
incorporates major structural assessment tools such as
PROCHECK [32], Verify3D [33] and PDB Validation
[34], was used to check the bond-length, bond-angle,
residue geometry, stereo-chemical quality and perform
volumetric analysis to evaluate the overall quality of
each structural model.

being selected from a pool of randomized potential
starting conformations. The structural quality assessment of the final models was performed using the Protein Structure Validation Suite, as described above.
Detailed results of the quality verifications performed on
the four WT models are provided in Table 1. RMSD
calculation performed by PyMOL returned scores
between 0.28 Å and 0.29 Å for all WT models, suggesting excellent quality of the WT structural models. With
Z-scores of -1.28 to -1.61 from Verify3D, all four WT
models of b-mannosidase were considered to be structurally sound, since an average Z-score of -1.44 is usually
obtained for high resolution PDB structures [33].
PROCHECK predicted that all the WT models had
95.6% - 99.2% of their residues within the conformationally allowed regions, while 85% is the minimum benchmark for high-quality X-ray crystallography structures.
Moreover, the PDB Validation software, also used by
PDB for 3D structural quality assessment, assigned an
average value of 0.02 Å and 3.325° for the bond lengths
and bond angles, respectively, within each of the WT
models. Hence, all computationally generated models in
this investigation are considered to be of good quality
and suitable for this structural analysis. High degree of
conservation amongst the functionally important
domains from the template sequence and the target
sequences, together with thorough preliminary assessment have resulted in good quality homology models.
Structural mapping of mutations

In order to understand the structural location of the
mutations and study the impact of mutations on the
enzyme’s structure in different species, a mutational
map was constructed. Based on multiple sequence alignment and profile alignment of WT human, cow, goat
and mouse sequences with that of the template, all the
available mutations were mapped to the structural models of b-mannosidase in the context of the active site of
the enzyme. Prior to mutational mapping, initial

mapping of the secondary structure on the aligned
sequences was carried out according to information provided by PDB database on Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron
b-mannosidase. (Additional File 1 - Figure S1). Subsequently, positions of the mutations and their relative
locations were mapped onto the secondary structures of
WT enzymes.
Mammalian b-mannosidase is a multi-domain protein
with (a/b) TIM barrel being the home of its catalytic
nucleophiles, E457 and E554 [20]. All the amino acid residues that take part in the enzymatic activity of b-mannosidase are well conserved from bacteria to human
(Additional File 1 - Figure S1). Figure 2 shows the components of b-mannosidase active site in human. The W190,
D191 and W192 motif belongs to an extended loop of the
first beta-sheet that projects towards the catalytic center.
Together with W390 and W657, both of which are also
located within loops adjacent to E457, the W190, D191
and W192 residues provide a firm grip to hold substrates
into the correct positions for catalysis [20]. All these highly
conserved amino acids give the active site of b-mannosidase a deep pocket like appearance [20]. From mutational
mapping (Additional File 1 - Figure S1) it is notable that
most mutations causing harmful or lethal phenotypes
occur in close proximity to the active site, thereby affecting the enzyme functionality. Mutations distant from the
active and binding sites cause minimal damage to the protein structure and activity, consequently resulting in mild
phenotypes. However, a few mutations that are distant
from the active site cause severe phenotypes due to their
adverse effects on the enzyme structure and function (discussed later).
Most truncations cause severe phenotypes

Out of a total of 15 b-mannosidosis causing mutations
identified up to date (Additional File 2 – Table S1) in
three species: human, cow and goat, only two have been
reported in ruminants. Both these mutations in ruminants are single base substitutions that introduced stop
codons leading to truncations at the protein level

nucleophiles (E457 and E554) are coloured red. The binding site residues are in magenta.

(Figure 3). In Nubian goat, the active site of the enzyme
was completely compromised by the W466X truncation
(Figure 3), leading to lethal mannosidosis with neonatal
onset [35,36]. In domestic cows, although the W858X
truncation occurred on the N-terminal b-sheet resulting
in almost the entire protein being intact (Figure 3; only
22 residues were missing), the animals still suffered
deadly symptoms [8]. This highlights the significance of
the role played by the last domain of b-mannosidase in
enzyme stabilization, as suggested by Leipprandt et al.
[8]. It is also notable that the enzyme chitobiase, the
only exoglycosidase in the bi-directional catabolic pathway for N-acetyllactosaminic glycoproteins apart from
b-mannosidase, is highly expressed and said to substitute for b-mannosidase activity in its absence or malfunctioning in human and rodents but not in ruminants
[37]. This suggests that mutations that have an effect on
the structure and function of b-mannosidase are likely
to cause lethal phenotypes in those animals. However,
human and mouse may be more tolerant for such mutations owing to the prominent presence of the enzyme
chitobiase.
In human, truncations make up approximately 70% of
b-mannosidosis cases (9 out of 13 mutations). Most of
these truncations caused the protein sequence to

terminate well before the catalytic nucleophiles of the
enzyme active site. As a result, they would completely
demolish the enzyme activity. In fact, patients with
Y126X [7], W192X [14], W231X [38], V321X [39] and
Y485X [9] truncations showed typical severe phenotypes
such as mental retardation, hearing loss and some
degrees of angiokeratomas, with the age of onset ranging from infantile to 18 months [15,40]. Figure 3 provides an overview of the correlation between genotypic
variations and phenotypic expressions amongst truncations obtained by mapping the extent of truncated protein in each case, caused by nonsense, insertion and
deletion mutations within the MANBA gene sequence,
to the human b-mannosidase protein chain. Generally,
truncations before the b-mannosidase active site would
result in improper functioning or non-functional protein, which subsequently leads to severe phenotypic
expression. On the other hand truncations that lead to
only a small segment of the protein chain being
removed, are usually viable both in their genotypic and
phenotypic expressions.
In some cases of b-mannosidosis however, the
observed phenotypes were different from the theoretical
consequences of the related mutations. One of the reasons for this conflict is the pattern of inheritance of the

disease-associated mutations. Belidu et al. [9] reported a
case, where the patient was heterozygous for both E83X
and Q426X (Figure 3) mutations on different chromosomes. Yet, the patient only suffered moderate phenotypes, regardless of the total malfunctioning of the
truncated proteins. Comparably, a Spanish woman was
reported with mild mannosidosis, as she was a compound heterozygote for W466X truncation [10]. The
K616X truncation results in a protein without W657,
one of the active site residues, from the peptide
sequence, but the individual only showed mild symptoms from the age of 12 as he was a heterozygote for
the described mutation [10]. These variations in the
genotypic and phenotypic expressions of the disease
could also be attributed to the higher expression of the
enzyme chitobiase in human as described earlier.
Similarly, V720X truncation resulted in almost an
intact enzyme with full active site. Regardless, the mutation was reported to be responsible for severe clinical
expression in the patient [41]. This is due to the fact
that this truncation results in a protein without the

entire last domain and half of the penultimate domain.
Therefore, it causes improper domain organization leading to the destabilization of the enzyme fold and assembly. Hence, this truncation affects the enzyme
functionality causing a severe phenotype. This observation sheds light on the potentially crucial role played by
the last domain of b-mannosidase in enzyme stabilization in human as previously suggested for bovine bmannosidase [8].
Substitutions affecting enzyme structure and function cause
harmful phenotypes

Only 4 substitutions have been reported to date to be
associated with b-mannosidosis. All the substitutions
reported occur in human. The proximity of each mutation to the active site and properties of the amino acids
involved, both contribute to the severity of the phenotype. The relative positions of these mutations with
respect to the active site are visualized in Figure 4. In
R182W substitution, replacement of the basic arginine
by a neutral and aromatic tryptophan causes disruption
of the dipole-dipole interaction between the side chain

of R182 and the backbone of M416, as shown in Figure
5a. As a result, the TIM barrel structure that houses the
enzyme active site is slightly destabilized and the
enzyme activity is reduced [10]. However, since this
mutation occurs away from the active site and the
patient was a compound heterozygote for the same, the
individual was reported with mild angiokeratoma corporis diffusum and no neurological involvement [10].
On the other hand, the G392E (Figure 5b) substitution
changes the neutral glycine residue to an anionic glutamic acid [10] which forms an anion-quadrupole interaction with the electropositive ring edge of W190 (Figure
5). Consequently, the W190, D191 and W192 motif is
dislocated from its optimal binding position. Hence, the
enzyme activity is significantly reduced and the individual suffered from moderate symptoms [42]. In another
case, replacement of a serine by a proline (S505P) causes
disruption of the hydrogen bond between S505 and
N455 (Figure 5c) which is located next to the catalytic
nucleophile (E457) in the protein sequence (Figure 5c),
thereby, disturbing the active site. In addition, introduction of a proline also causes distortion to the protein
backbone. As a result, severe phenotypic expressions are
observed in the affected patient [7].
In 2009, Sabourdy et al.[43] raised attention to another
case, where the patient was diagnosed to be homozygous

for an arginine to histidine substitution (R641H). The
replacement of a positively charged arginine residue to
that of a slightly positive histidine could rupture the
potential salt bridge between R641 and D709 (Figure 5d)
that exists in the human WT structure. This salt bridge
could well be contributing towards the overall stability of
the b-mannosidase protein fold. Hence, R641H substitution destabilizes the fold owing to the smaller and lesser
charged histidine side-chain which cannot reach out to
D709 to form a salt bridge (Figure 5d). Thus, this substitution affects the structure of the enzyme, thereby, significantly reducing enzyme activity resulting in a moderate
phenotype. Also, R641 is conserved in most mammals
(Figure 6), suggesting an important role of the residue in
stabilizing the protein structure.
Analysis of our structural models laid the foundation
for the correlation between the observed phenotype of
each substitution mutation to their position and functional consequence. From Table 2 it is evident that
mutations close to active site (severely disturbing the
protein structure) and those that act to destabilize the
fold directly affect the enzyme function leading to moderate or severe phenotypes. Where as, a mutation
(R182W) away from the active site causes minimal
damage to the enzyme structure and function leading to
a mild or viable genotype and phenotype.

Prediction of potentially harmful mutations

Lysosomal b-D-mannosidase is an important component
in the catabolic pathway for N-acetyllactosaminic glycoproteins [44]. Therefore, the protein structure is evolutionarily conserved across the species. Amino acid
residues critical for enzyme stability and activity are well
preserved, with only minor changes to suit different
metabolic specificities in different species. Figure 2
shows the highly conserved residues or the components
that form the enzyme active site. Therefore, any direct
mutations or that associated with these residues could
lead to serious consequences. Sedel et al.[14] have
shown that insertion of 10 nucleotides at the 562-572
loci in the MANBA sequence, which encode the vital
residue W192 (part of the W190, D191 and W192
motif), significantly demolishes the enzyme activity leading to a severe phenotype in the affected patient [14].
Moreover, mutations of the catalytic nucleophiles E457
and E554, located at the center of the active site, would
completely demolish enzyme activity and hence could
cause fatal phenotypes. Hence, we have extrapolated
observed mutations from one species and mapped them

to homologous positions in other organisms (Figure 6).
Based on the proximity of these mutations to the
enzyme active site and their co-location from different
organisms, we have detected functional hot-spots for
mutations likely to be involved in β-mannosidosis across
the four species (Figure 6).
Besides the functional hot-spots, mutational mapping
also reveals high-risk segments on the b-mannosidase
protein sequence. Figure 6 clearly shows that all the
mutational residues, are highly conserved, with a small
exception of E83 in human and mouse being replaced
by K83 in ruminants and Q426 in human being replaced
by K426 in mouse, E426 in domestic cow and P426 in
goat. Our analysis reveals that Y126, W192, W231,
V321, G392, Q426, Y485, S505, R641 and V720 are
prime locations for b-mannosidosis mutations in
human. Therefore, mutation of these residues could
result in harmful disease phenotypes in mouse and
ruminants. Truncation at W466 has reportedly resulted
in a mild phenotype in human but causes a severe phenotypic effect in goat. Given the high level of conservation of this residue across the four species and keeping

using ClustalX [26], shows a high level of sequence similarity, with conserved (*), conservatively substituted (:) and semi-conservatively

in mind the high and low levels of expression of the
enzyme chitobiase amongst the species (as discussed
earlier), if this mutation is identified in mouse and cow,
it is likely to cause a mild and severe phenotype,
respectively.
Similarly, truncation at W858 leads to a lethal phenotype in domestic cow. Hence, due to the crucial role
played by the last domain of b-mannosidase in enzyme
stabilization in cow [8] and the severe phenotype caused
by the V720X truncation in human, W858X truncation
could possibly cause severe b-mannosidosis in human,
mouse and goat. Although R182 and K616 have only
caused mild phenotypic expression in human and have
not yet been detected in goat, cow and mouse, high
level of sequential and positional similarity of these

residues in all species suggests that they could be potential mutational hot-spots in goat, cow and mouse.
Together with the active site amino acids, these diseaseimplicated residues form a set of hot-spots for b-mannosidosis prediction, which are useful for early detection
of the disease.
Mutational hot-spots in the MANBA gene

All inherited mutations known to cause b-mannosidosis
were mapped onto the MANBA gene sequence based on
their nucleotide position as listed in Additonal File 2 –
Table S1. Although b-mannosidase mutations appear scattered when mapped onto the MANBA gene sequence,
Figure 7 clearly shows mutational clusters in five distinct
segments that vary in length, along the gene sequence.

Figure 7 Mapping inherited mutations in b-mannosidosis to the MANBA gene sequence. Missense and nonsense mutations are shown
above the gene sequence, with the specific amino acid change indicated, while insertions and deletions are shown below the gene sequence,
numbered in terms of the bases affected. The dark blue areas on the MANBA gene sequence represent sequence-derived mutational hot-spots.

These clusters were identified by grouping mutations with
relatively close nucleotide positions. The boundaries of
these clusters were based on the nucleotide positions of
the first and the last mutations in that particular group.
These segments are hot-spots on the MANBA gene
sequence that could most likely undergo harmful modifications due to high frequency of clinically observed mutations in these regions. These hot-spots range from
nucleotide number 334-375, 544-693, 960-1175, 13631541 and 1848-2574, with nucleotide lengths varying from
42 to 727. The proximity of each hotspot segment to the
active site is another factor that determines the probability
of a harmful mutation occurring in that specific locus.
Hot-spots 960-1175, 1363-1541 and 1848-2574 have
the largest number of nucleotides (216, 179 and 727,
respectively) amongst the five and are associated with
the highest number of mutations causing b-mannosidosis. Therefore, it is inferred that the amino-acid residues
encoded by the nucleotides within these hot-spots are
prone to mutations. Hot-spots 544-693, 960-1175, 13631541 and 1848-2574, together code for all the active site
residues. Hence, these segments could potentially harbour harmful mutations. Also, hot-spots 1363-1541 and
1848-2574 contain the genetic information that codes
for the two catalytic nucleophiles (E457 and E554) of
the enzyme. Hence, any inherited mutation identified
within these two hot-spots could potentially cause more
severe phenotypes than those identified elsewhere in the
MANBA gene sequence.

Conclusion
Although b-mannosidosis has been reported since
1980s, the underlying genotypic features have not been
well studied. Clinically, typical symptoms considered
associated with the disease are mental retardation, hearing loss, angiokeratomas, recurrent infection, skeletal
and facial dysmorphism. However, the severity of phenotypic expression varies. While the disease is fatal in
ruminants, it has varied phenotypes in human. This has
been suggested to be a result of the high level of expression of another exoglycosidase enzyme called chitobiase
in the human lysosomes [18,37]. Chitobiase acts on the
reducing-end GlcNAc and removes it from the protein/
carbohydrate component of N-linked glycoproteins [45].
In theory, chitobiase might be up-regulated in the
absence of b-mannosidase to act as a replacement
enzyme. However, a combined study of b-mannosidase
and chitobiase would be interesting to help better
understand b-mannosidosis and its degree of phenotypic
expression.
Our comprehensive study has revealed a genotype–
phenotype correlation in b-mannosidosis. Since the
components of b-mannosidase active site span across
the length of the protein chain, homozygous truncations
are very likely to result in a dysfunctional enzyme leading to severe phenotypes. The effects of substitutions
are also related to their proximity to the enzyme active
site. In particular, the closer the mutations are to the
active site, the more severe the phenotypes would be.

Huynh et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12(Suppl 3):S22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/S3/S22

The pattern of inheritance for the mutations is also an
importance factor that affects the clinical expression of
the disease. Unlike b-mannosidosis, where mutations are
homozygous with distinct expression, b-mannosidosis
can be either heterozygous or homozygous, which significantly reduces the chances of identification in
patients with mild mutations. This poses a major restriction in studying b-mannosidosis. Therefore, a total of 15
mutations reported in three decades (Additional File 2 –
Table S1) provide a reasonable dataset for analysis.
Our analysis reveals that the mutations are scattered
over the entire length of the MANBA gene, presenting
us with five distinct mutational hot-spots. The identification of these regions has not only provided us the
basis for predicting the severity of a particular mutation,
it has also helped us in forecasting the residues that
could most likely undergo mutations based on their
location on the gene. Moreover, much like many other
lysosomal disorders, a high amount of mutational heterogeneity is observed in b-mannosidosis. This property
of b-mannosidosis makes it comparable to other lysosomal disorders. We have also demonstrated a predictive
approach for detecting likely b-mannosidosis by extrapolating observed mutations from one species to homologous positions in other organisms based on the
proximity of the mutations to the enzyme active site,
mutational co-location from different organisms
(human, cow and goat) and orthologous positions in the
profile alignment (Additional File 1 – Figure S1) of the
WT b-mannosidase sequences from four species
(human, cow, goat and mouse).
From our investigation, we infer that b-mannosidosis
could be dealt through gene therapy rather than drug/
inhibitor design since lysosomal b-mannosidase is a cardinal enzyme and all mutations observed affect it’s functionality. By highlighting the effect of disease-implicated
mutations on enzyme/protein structure, this study provides a basis for understanding the molecular determinants responsible for phenotypic variations. This study
could be extended to other inherited diseases with
potential applications in developing therapies to combat
them. Should a larger set of b-mannosidosis associated
mutations become available in the future, it would be
very interesting to apply this structural analysis procedure to authenticate our genotype-phenotype correlation. While this study provides essential knowledge of
the effect of mutations on b-mannosidase structure and
function by analyzing its static structures, such studies
will no doubt benefit from either experimental or computational analysis of the enzyme structural dynamics in
order to gain an in-depth understanding of the underlying causes of b-mannosidosis. Furthermore, there will
also be the possibility that while mutations may be
detected, they may not result in any diseased phenotype

because upon combinations, mutations may compensate
for the deleterious effects of each other.
