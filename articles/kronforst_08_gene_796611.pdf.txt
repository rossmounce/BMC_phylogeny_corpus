Abstract
Background: Hybridization, or the interbreeding of two species, is now recognized as an
important process in the evolution of many organisms. However, the extent to which hybridization
results in the transfer of genetic material across the species boundary (introgression) remains
unknown in many systems, as does the length of time after initial divergence that the species
boundary remains porous to such gene flow.
Results: Here I use genome-wide genotypic and DNA sequence data to show that there is
introgression and admixture between the melpomene/cydno and silvaniform clades of the butterfly
genus Heliconius, groups that separated from one another as many as 30 million generations ago.
Estimates of historical migration based on 523 DNA sequences from 14 genes suggest
unidirectional gene flow from the melpomene/cydno clade into the silvaniform clade. Furthermore,
genetic clustering based on 520 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) identified
multiple individuals of mixed ancestry showing that introgression is on-going.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that genomes can remain porous to gene flow very long
after initial divergence. This, in turn, greatly expands the evolutionary potential afforded by
introgression. Phenotypic and species diversity in a wide variety of organisms, including Heliconius,
have likely arisen from introgressive hybridization. Evidence for continuous gene flow over millions
of years points to introgression as a potentially important source of genetic variation to fuel the
evolution of novel forms.

Background
Hybridization has long been recognized as an important
mechanism of diversification in plants [1,2], and the
exchange of genetic material via horizontal gene transfer
has played a significant role in the evolution of many
prokaryotic genomes [3]. In animals however, hybridization has historically been viewed as rare and evolutionarily inconsequential [4]. Despite this bias in opinion, we
now know that hybridization is relatively wide-spread
among animal species [5], and in some instances, it has
likely had important evolutionary ramifications, such as

in the origin of new species [6-10]. Surveys of hybridization in animals show that it occurs predominantly
between closely-related sister species [5], and well-characterized examples of interspecific gene flow generally
involve species that diverged very recently [10-13]. These
observations are consistent with theory and data which
show that genetic incompatibilities that result in hybrid
sterility and inviability accumulate as species diverge [14].
Hybrid sterility and inviability, in turn, reduce or eliminate the opportunity for gene exchange. Despite these
general trends, there are occasional examples of hybridiPage 1 of 8

zation between distantly-related non-sister species in various animal groups [15-20]. Do these cases result in the
long-term sharing of genetic material or are they simply
evolutionary dead-ends?

ethilla, and two are believed to be hybrids between H. melpomene and H. hecale [27]. Recent genetic data demonstrated that one of these suspected H. melpomene/H. ethilla
hybrids was indeed an F1 hybrid [25].

To address this question I focused on the Neotropical butterfly genus Heliconius, a group well known for its diversity
of mimetic wing patterns and for extensive hybridization
[21]. As in other organisms, most hybridization in Heliconius occurs between closely-related species and subspecies
[21]. Among these groups hybridization is known to
result in gene flow [22-24]. However, members of two
ecologically and morphologically distinct Heliconius subgroups, the melpomene/cydno clade and the silvaniform
clade (Figure 1), also occasionally hybridize with one
another [21,25]. In captivity, first-generation and backcross hybrids have resulted from multiple crosses between
the two clades [21,26], and there are at least eleven suspected hybrids that have been collected in the field
[21,25,27]. Based on phenotype and collection location,
four of these field-caught specimens are believed to be
hybrids between H. melpomene and H. numata, five are
believed to be hybrids between H. melpomene and H.

While the existence of rare hybrids between the melpomene/cydno and silvaniform clades provides a potential
avenue for gene flow between them, it is unknown
whether introgression occurs over these large phylogenetic distances. To determine whether these distantly
related groups continue to exchange genes, I used two
complementary population genetic datasets to measure
the extent of historical gene flow and contemporary
admixture between sympatric populations of the two
clades.

The age of the split between the melpomene/cydno and silvaniform clades was estimated assuming an evolutionary rate of
1.15% per lineage per million years [32].

Results and Discussion
Historical migration inferred from DNA sequence data
In order to examine rates of gene flow between the two
clades, I sequenced multiple haplotypes for one mitochondrial and 13 nuclear genes from three species in the
melpomene/cydno clade (H. cydno, H. pachinus, H. melpomene) and one species in the silvaniform clade (H.
hecale). I then used these data and the coalescent-based
approach implemented in IM [28] to estimate the population migration rate (2Nm) between H. hecale and each of
the three melpomene/cydno clade species. All three pairwise
analyses revealed non-zero peaks for the marginal posterior probability distributions corresponding to the rate of
historical migration from the melpomene/cydno clade into
H. hecale (Figure 2a–c). Furthermore, for the comparisons
involving H. pachinus and H. melpomene, the 90% highest
posterior density interval for this function did not include
zero, allowing rejection of the no gene flow hypothesis.
These results, which are suggestive of unidirectional gene
flow from the melpomene/cydno clade into the silvaniform
clade, are consistent with the observation that of the two
suspected backcross hybrids that have been collected in
the field, both are believed to have resulted from backcrossing in the direction of the silvaniform clade parent
(H. melpomene × H. ethilla backcrossed to H. ethilla)
[25,27].

It is important to note that the evolutionary history of the
DNA sequences studied here violates one of the underlying assumptions of the Isolation with Migration model.
The IM model assumes that the two populations being
examined are sister-taxa, each being more closely related
to the other than either is to any other population. That is
clearly not the situation with these inter-clade comparisons. However, if the sampled species provide an unbiased approximation of the genetic divergence between the
two groups under study (the silvaniform and melpomene/
cydno clades in this case), then it seems reasonable to
model the system under the Isolation with Migration

framework. The fact that analyses based on independent
data (AFLPs, see below) are consistent with the IM results
lends support to both the approach and the results.
Gene flow has a variable influence across the genome
A prediction of speciation models that permit gene flow
during the process of divergence is that the influence of
introgression should vary throughout the genome [29].
For instance, regions of the genome linked to loci that are
under divergent selection between species should be prevented from crossing the species boundary even while
other portions of the genome remain interchangeable. To
test this prediction, I performed a second series of IM
analyses, this time estimating separate population migration rates for each locus. Consistent with the prediction,
the shapes of the migration rate posterior probability distributions varied substantially across loci. Most genes had
probability distributions that peaked at or near zero indicating little or no historical gene flow (Figure 3). However, two loci, cubitus interruptus (ci) and white (w), had
probability distributions consistent with gene flow from

the melpomene/cydno clade into H. hecale (Figure 2d–f).
While the migration rate probability distributions for ci
and w were not well-defined, their shapes suggest that
some amount of historical migration fit the data better
than no migration.
Gene genealogies for these two loci revealed the extent of
shared genetic variation between the two clades. For the
other 12 loci, H. hecale haplotypes formed a well-supported clade that was distinct from melpomene/cydno clade
haplotypes [24], but for both ci and w, H. hecale haplotypes were distributed across the tree (Figure 4). In addition, one identical ci haplotype was shared between H.
melpomene and H. hecale. This haplotype was 281 bp long,
139 bp of which consisted of an otherwise highly variable
intron. The sharing of an identical haplotype between
these two clades is difficult to explain without recent gene
flow. Previous work has found evidence of gene flow at ci
among species within the melpomene/cydno clade [23,24]
but interestingly, the locus with the clearest signature of
gene flow between closely-related Heliconius species, Man-

of introgression over the larger phylogenetic distances
examined here.
Contemporary admixture
While the analyses of the DNA sequence data are consistent with a low but detectable level of gene flow between
the two clades, these results do not reveal its timing. Perhaps gene flow persisted for some time after the initial
divergence of the two clades but has since ceased. Alternatively, current hybridization could continue to provide a
bridge between the gene pools. To test for evidence of contemporary gene flow, I genotyped 56 H. cydno, 44 H.
pachinus, 27 H. melpomene and 44 H. hecale individuals at
520 polymorphic AFLP loci. Using these data and the
Bayesian clustering method implemented in STRUCTURE
2.2 [30,31], I performed genetic clustering assuming four
populations and allowing individuals to be of mixed
ancestry. This analysis correctly delineated the four species

and identified two H. cydno individuals and two H. hecale
individuals with ancestry from the opposite clade (Figure
5). For each of these individuals, the 95% posterior probability interval for the genome proportion derived from
the population of origin did not include one, and for
three of the four individuals, the interval for the introgressed genome proportion did not include zero (Table
1). To further assess the statistical confidence for these
suspected instances of admixture, I performed a second
clustering analysis, this time estimating the posterior
probability that each individual had pure ancestry after
first indicating the population of origin for each individual and setting the prior probability of pure ancestry to
0.95. All four of the individuals identified in the first analysis had low probabilities of pure ancestry and high probabilities of mixed ancestry with the other clade (Table 1),
supporting the hypothesis of contemporary admixture.
Interestingly, the four individuals with recently-mixed
ancestry based on the AFLP data were not included in the

and tree topology for these two loci is indicative of interspecific gene flow. Nodes with posterior probabilities > 0.60 are
labeled.

DNA sequence analyses so the signatures of gene flow in
the two datasets are independent of one another.
Gene flow has persisted for millions of years after
speciation
Together, these population genetic data are consistent
with a history of divergence with gene flow between the
melpomene/cydno and silvaniform clades. Average pairwise
mtDNA divergence between these two groups is 5.7% (SE
= 0.5%). Using the estimate of 1.1 – 1.2% divergence per
lineage per million years [32], this equates to approximately 2.5 million years of divergence. With a minimal
Heliconius generation time of one month, this represents

as many as 30 million generations of evolution along each
lineage since the speciation event that precipitated cladogenesis.

Conclusion
These data suggest that the process of divergence that ultimately results in reproductively isolated species can be
prolonged. The fact that genomes can remain open to
gene flow very long after the speciation process is initiated
greatly expands the evolutionary novelty that can be generated from introgression. Some portion of the phenotypic and species diversity in Heliconius has very likely
arisen from introgressive hybridization [6,26]. The results

presented here suggest that the melpomene/cydno and silvaniform clades of Heliconius have experienced continuous
gene flow over millions of years. Thus, introgression has
had the potential to provide a ready source of genetic variation to fuel this expansive adaptive radiation. For many
organisms, even rare hybridization with distantly related
species may allow for the continued exchange of genetic
material which may serve as a long-term source of variation for adaptive change.

Methods
Samples
I collected 56 H. cydno, 44 H. pachinus, 27 H. melpomene,
and 44 H. hecale individuals from various locations
throughout Costa Rica. None of the sampled individuals
exhibited phenotypic evidence of introgression from the
opposite clade. All specimens were collected as adults in
the summer of 2000 and 2002. Tissue was preserved in
95% ethanol and DNA was extracted with a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) or using a phenol/chloroform extraction
protocol.

DNA sequencing and analysis
I sequenced multiple haplotypes for one mitochondrial
locus and 13 nuclear loci from the four species using
primers and methods described previously [24,33]. The
loci were apterous (ap), cubitus interruptus (ci), cytochrome
oxidase I &II (CO, mtDNA), Distal-less (Dll), elongation factor 1α (ef1α), engrailed (en), invected (unv), Mannose phosphate isomerase (Mpi), patched (ptc), scalloped (sd), scarlet
(st), Triose phosphate isomerase (Tpi), white (w), and wingless
(wg). I also sequenced portions of the genes cinnabar [24]
and decapentaplegic [34] but these loci were excluded from
the analyses because only one H. hecale sequence was
obtained for each. All sequences have been deposited in
GenBank under accession numbers AY744577–
AY745254–AY745278,
AY745315–
AY744672,
AY745356–AY745490,
DQ448305–
AY745335,
DQ448516 and EF041105–EF041122. For analysis, the
datasets for CO,ef1α,Mpi, and Tpi were supplemented
with published sequences from GenBank [24].

I used the comparative DNA sequence data and the Isolation with Migration model implemented in IM [28] to
infer historical rates of between-species gene flow. IM cannot handle alignment gaps or evidence of recombination
in DNA sequence data. Therefore, I removed gaps and
searched for evidence of recombination using the fourgamete test in DnaSP 3.5 [35]. For those loci that exhibited evidence of recombination, the sequence alignment
was divided into portions that showed no evidence of
recombination and only one portion was included in the
analysis. In an effort to preserve as much genealogical
information as possible, the portion with the most polymorphisms was chosen. The size of these non-recombining portions ranged from 60 bp for st in the H. cydno/H.
hecale comparison to 1111 bp for wg in the H. melpomene/
H. hecale comparison.
For each comparison between H. hecale and one of the
three melpomene/cydno clade species, I ran IM in two different ways. First, I used the data for all loci to estimate a single pair of bidirectional population migration rates
(Figure 2a–c). Then, using the same dataset, I allowed
each locus to have a separate pair of population migration
rates (Figure 3). For each analysis, IM was run with 10
Metropolis-coupled chains for 300,000 burn-in steps followed by 2 × 107steps of data collection. Following other
implementations of IM [28], I used the HKY model for the
mitochondrial locus and the infinite-sites model for the
nuclear loci.
Phylogeny estimation
I used published DNA sequences from six genes [36] and
MrBayes [37] to estimate a phylogeny of the silvaniform
and melpomene/cydno clades of Heliconius. Four Metropolis-coupled Markov chains were run for 250,000 burn-in
generations followed by 1.75 × 106 generations of data
collection. The age of the melpomene/cydno and silvaniform split was estimated based on 1606 base pairs of
mtDNA from ref. 36, assuming an evolutionary rate of
1.15% per lineage per million years [32]. Gene genealogies for ci and w were also estimated using MrBayes, based
on the GTR+I+Γ model of molecular evolution.

minor allele frequency ≥ 0.05 were used in further analyses.
I used the AFLP data and the Bayesian-based genetic clustering program STRUCTURE 2.2 [30,31] to define populations and estimate admixture among them. The data were
analyzed in two ways. First, I performed naïve admixture
clustering assuming four populations. As part of this analysis, I estimated the 95% posterior probability interval
around each individual admixture proportion. Second, I
performed an additional round of admixture clustering
after first indicating the population of origin for each individual and setting the prior probability of pure ancestry to
0.95. As part of this analysis, I estimated the posterior
probability that each individual was misclassified or had
an ancestor from each of the other species within the last
three generations. For both analyses, STRUCTURE was
run for 10,000 burn-in generations followed by 106 generations of data collection.

AFLP genotyping and analysis
Using the ABI Plant Mapping Kit (PE Applied Biosystems), I genotyped each individual with four selective
AFLP primer combinations; EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAT, EcoRIACT/MseI-CTG, EcoRI-ACA/MseI-CAT, and EcoRI-ACA/
MseI-CTG. AFLP fragments were separated using an ABI
3100 automated genotyper and then scored using ABI
GENEMAPPER software version 3.7. In total, each individual was typed for the presence or absence of a fragment
at 925 AFLP loci. In an effort to focus on the most informative and reliable markers, only the 520 AFLPs that had a
