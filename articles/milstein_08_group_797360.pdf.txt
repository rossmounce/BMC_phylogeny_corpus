Abstract
Background: Group I introns are found in the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA)
of some species of the genus Porphyra (Bangiales, Rhodophyta). Size polymorphisms in group I introns has
been interpreted as the result of the degeneration of homing endonuclease genes (HEG) inserted in
peripheral loops of intron paired elements. In this study, intron size polymorphisms were characterized
for different Porphyra spiralis var. amplifolia (PSA) populations on the Southern Brazilian coast, and were
used to infer genetic relationships and genetic structure of these PSA populations, in addition to cox2-3 and
rbcL-S regions. Introns of different sizes were tested qualitatively for in vitro self-splicing.
Results: Five intron size polymorphisms within 17 haplotypes were obtained from 80 individuals
representing eight localities along the distribution of PSA in the Eastern coast of South America. In order
to infer genetic structure and genetic relationships of PSA, these polymorphisms and haplotypes were used
as markers for pairwise Fst analyses, Mantel's test and median joining network. The five cox2-3 haplotypes
and the unique rbcL-S haplotype were used as markers for summary statistics, neutrality tests Tajima's D
and Fu's Fs and for median joining network analyses. An event of demographic expansion from a population
with low effective number, followed by a pattern of isolation by distance was obtained for PSA populations
with the three analyses. In vitro experiments have shown that introns of different lengths were able to selfsplice from pre-RNA transcripts.
Conclusion: The findings indicated that degenerated HEGs are reminiscent of the presence of a fulllength and functional HEG, once fixed for PSA populations. The cline of HEG degeneration determined the
pattern of isolation by distance. Analyses with the other markers indicated an event of demographic
expansion from a population with low effective number. The different degrees of degeneration of the HEG
do not refrain intron self-splicing. To our knowledge, this was the first study to address intraspecific
evolutionary history of a nuclear group I intron; to use nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA for
population level analyses of Porphyra; and intron size polymorphism as a marker for population genetics.

Background
Group I introns belong to a family of RNAs with catalytic
activities. These ribozymes are mobile elements inserted
within coding sequences of nuclear rDNA, chloroplast
and mitochondrial genomes of some eukaryotes; and less
frequently within coding sequences of eubacteria, phages
and viruses. Group I introns catalyze their own excision
(self-splicing) from pre-mRNA when mature RNA is being
processed. The exact site of intron excision and the perfect
reestablishment of the interrupted message are defined by
specific interactions between intron and exons, determined by a conserved secondary structure. Group I
introns fold on a structure, forming 10 conserved paired
elements (P1-P10) with a conserved catalytic core
[reviewed in [1]].
Size polymorphisms in group I introns have been
described [2-5] and are occasionally generated by the
insertion of a mobile element such as homing endonuclease genes (HEG) in peripheral loops of intron paired elements P1, P2, P6, P8 and P9 [4,6]. Homing endonuclease
genes encode for site specific homing endonucleases
(HEs), which in genetic crosses between an HEG containing intron allele and an intronless allele, recognize the
intron insertion site and catalyze a double strand break.
The intronless allele is then repaired using the HEG containing intron allele as a template. This mechanism of
intron mobility is known as homing [6]. Homing endonucleases are classified in five different families according
to conserved protein motifs and functional and structural
properties: LAGLIDADG; GIY-YIG; H-N-H; His-Cys box
[6-8]; and the recently described PD-(D/E)-XK motif [9].
His-Cys box motifs are identified in HE exclusively associated to nuclear group I introns [10]. Homing endonucleases were described for fungi, protists, bacteria and
viruses, but with unknown function for the hosts [6].
Descriptions of group I introns in Rhodophyta are limited
to a few genera [11-13], although it is commonly reported
for the genera Porphyra and Bangia (Bangiales, Rhodophyta) [13-15]. A survey for group I introns presence in
the order (Bangiales) described by Müller et al. [5], indicated that this order is a particularly rich in these introns.
The use of introns as molecular markers at the intra-specific level is very limited [2,16,17]. Usually in Rhodophyta, analyses at the intra-specific level are addressed
with molecular markers such as the nuclear rDNA internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2 [18,19]; the plastidial
spacer between the ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) and the small subunit
(rbcS) genes (rbcL-S) [20,21], and the mitochondrial
spacer between the cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 and
subunit 3 genes (cox2-3) [19,21-23].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/308

In a previous work, Oliveira and Ragan [2] characterized
introns of different sizes inserted in the nuclear small subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA) close to the 3' end (intron
S1506) of three Porphyra spiralis var. amplifolia (PSA) individuals collected at different sites on the Southern Brazilian coast. Open reading frames (ORFs) with His-Cys Box
motifs were described inserted in the P1 paired element,
confined within the conserved pair U*G, located in the
SSU rDNA exon and in the intron respectively in the complementary strand. This region is known as P1-extension
[4]. These findings prompted us to: 1) characterize introns
size polymorphisms at different PSA populations on the
Eastern coast of South America; 2) Infer genetic relationships and population structure of PSA populations using
introns in addition to rbcL-S and cox2-3 regions as genetic
markers; and 3) Verify if the different polymorphisms in
peripheral loop of intron P1 paired element affected qualitatively introns excision, through an in vitro self-splicing
assay.

Methods
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
Population samples of Porphyra spiralis var. amplifolia were
collected at eight different sites in the Southern Brazilian
shore (Table 1, Figure 1). A minimum of 10 individuals
were obtained from each site. Gametophyte blades were
identified based on morphological description [24], and
did not present any meaningful morphological variation
among and within populations. Samples were screened
for epiphytes using a stereomicroscope, and stored individually in silica gel. Each individual was ground in liquid
nitrogen and total genomic DNA was extracted using the
"DNeasy Plant Mini Kit" (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA),
according to manufacturer's specifications. Voucher specimens are deposited at University of São Paulo herbarium
(SPF, Table 1).

Total DNA was extracted from 10 individuals for each of
the eight geographic locations. Primers 1400F and 18S3'
were used to amplify part of the 3' end of the first SSU
rDNA exon + intron + the 5' end of the second SSU rDNA
exon; as a positive control for intron presence in the multiple SSU rDNA copies [25] primers 1400F and iR2 were
used to amplify HEG-containing ORF, including the
flanking 213 bp of the SSU rDNA 5'exon and 175 bp of
the intron. Primers COX 2F and COX 3R were used to
amplify the 3' end of cox2 gene + spacer + 5' end of cox3
gene; and primers F993 and RBCS3'R were used to
amplify the 3' end of rbcL gene + spacer + 5' end of rbcS
gene.
PCR amplification conditions for a total volume of 50 μL
were: 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP,
0.2 μM each primer, 20 ng of genomic DNA and 1.25 U of
Taq DNA polymerase (Promega Corporation, Madison,

WI). All PCR reactions were performed in a MiniCycler
thermocycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) and cycles
varied according to the region to be amplified: Introns –
94°C for 4 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 1
min, 72°C for 2 min, and a final extension step at 72°C
for 7 min. cox2-3 region – 94°C for 4 min, 5 cycles of

42°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min and 30 sec, and a final
extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Primers used for
amplification and sequencing are listed in Table 2. Negative controls for PCR reactions, that included all reagents
except DNA template, were performed. At least three independent PCR reactions were pooled together before
sequencing [26].
PCR products were purified using the MicroSpin™ S-300
HR Columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway,
NJ), and were directly sequenced on an ABI PRISM™ 310
Genetic Analyser or 3100 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the sequencing kit "
BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction"
(Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's specifications. Sequences were manually assembled and aligned
with BioEdit version 5.0.6 [27]. Ambiguous nucleotides
within the same individual sequence position were
checked against the sequencing chromatograms, to confirm validity of the nucleotide.
Analyses of population structure
Software DNAsp [28] were used to calculate summary statistics (H), neutrality tests Tajima's D [29] and Fu's Fs [30].
For median joining (MJ) network analyses, sequences previously aligned with Fluxus' DNA Alignment 1.121 software [31] were input in the program NETWORK 4.1 [31].

All parameters implemented in NETWORK were set to
default: Characters weights (10 for all characters), transversions/transitions ratios (1:1) and the distance calculation method (connection cost). Parameter epsilon, a
weighted genetic distance measure, was set to 0. Population genetics analyses for intron + HEG were carried out
using Arlequin [32]. The dataset was input as sequence
length polymorphism (based on PCR results) with ten
individuals per population. Introns were grouped in four
categories according to their size: 1- 616 bp; 2- from 791
to 792 bp; 3- 909 bp; 4- from 1054 to 1058 bp. This dataset was analyzed for F-statistics implementation. This software was also used for Mantel's test of isolation by
distance. PSA-B, PSA-D and PSA-R individuals were
excluded from these analyses (data available for only one
individual per population).
Intron nomenclature adopted in this work (i.e. S1506)
was modified from Johansen and Haugen [33] and the
insertion location of the introns is given according to the
reference position in Escherichia coli SSU rDNA.
Cloning and in vitro transcription
Primers 1400F and 18S3' were used for the amplification
of the nuclear SSU rDNA intron, including the flanking
213 bp of the SSU rDNA 5'exon and 27 bp of the SSU
rDNA 3'exon. Amplicons of one individual of PSA-G,
PSA-L, PSA-T and PSA-V populations were cloned according to manufacturer's specifications in pGEM®-T vectors
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI), and were replicated in E. coli DH10B. Plasmids were recovered and purified with Wizard® plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification
System (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol.
Inserts were PCR amplified with primers T7 and 18S3' for
an in vitro transcription assay (Table 2), and purified with
the kit Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean up System

(Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol. Negative controls for PCR reactions were performed.
Transcription reactions (50 μL) were performed with 1 μg
of purified PCR products and T7 RNA polymerase
enzyme, in T7 RiboMAX™ Express large scale RNA production system kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's
protocol. Transcription reactions were incubated at 45°C
for 45 min, then were digested with RQ1 RNase-free
DNase (Promega) and RNA transcripts were extracted
with phenol (pH 4.7): chlorophorm: isoamyl alcohol
(125:24:1).
Intron in vitro self-splicing assays
The extracted RNAs were tested for intron qualitative in
vitro self-splicing by the following assay: an aliquot of
each transcription reaction was incubated at 45°C for 45
min, in the presence of the self-splicing buffer as described
in Sogin and Edman [34]: 100 mM (NH4)2 SO4, 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 60 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM GTP. The
RNA was extracted with phenol: chlorophorm: isoamyl
alcohol (25:24:1). To verify if introns self-spliced from
RNA, 2 μL of RNA were denatured at 70°C for 10 min in
18 μL of formamide denaturing buffer (according to manufacturer's protocol) and were visualized in an ethidium
bromide stained 2% agarose gel [35].

Reverse transcription reactions followed by PCR (50 μL)
were carried out with 1X AccessQuick™ Master Mix buffer
(Promega), approximately 10 ng RNA, 0.2 μM of each
primer (1400F and 18S3') and 5 units AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega). For cDNA synthesis, the reactions
were incubated at 45°C for 45 min followed by PCR cycle:
95°C for 2 min; 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec and 60°C for
30 sec; with a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min
according to manufacturer's protocol. All PCR reactions
included negative controls and were performed in a MiniCycler thermocycler (MJ Research).
PCR products were purified from agarose gels using Wizard® SV Gel and PCR clean up system kit (Promega) and
were re-amplified with primers 1400F and 18S3' as
described above. The PCR cycle used was as described for
RT-PCR. PCR products were purified with Wizard® SV Gel
and PCR clean up system kit (Promega) and were directly
sequenced as described above.

Results
Characterization of introns size polymorphisms at
different PSA populations
Group I S1506 introns from 80 Porphyra spiralis var. amplifolia (PSA) collected at eight different sites in the Southern
Brazilian shore were PCR amplified. Visualization in 0.7%
agarose gel unveiled four introns size polymorphism
among different PSA populations. The smallest introns

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/308

were amplified from PSA-V population (616 bp) and the
largest introns were amplified from PSA-A, PSA-I, PSA-L
and PSA-T populations (1054-8 bp; Table 3). Intron size
polymorphisms within a population were detected only
for PSA-S and PSA-T collections. Presence of two introns
of different sizes occurring in the same sample was
observed for one individual from PSA-S (792 bp + 909
bp) and for one individual from PSA-T (792 bp + 1055
bp). Based on these PCR results, introns from 10 individuals of PSA-S, PSA-T and PSA-V were sequenced, and for
the remaining populations, introns from two individuals
per population were sequenced. Sequencing data from
individuals PSA-B, PSA-D and PSA-R [2] were obtained
from the GenBank. In total, 44 introns sequences were
analyzed [GenBank accession numbers from FJ147627 to
FJ147667].
Introns size polymorphisms are due to insertions from 42
to 482 bp in intron P1 paired element. Variability among
the 44 PSA sequences (introns and P1-extension) yielded
17 different haplotypes (see additional file 1), with haplotype diversity (H) of 0.895. P1-extension is the most variable region presenting nucleotide substitutions and
indels. When P1-extension was excluded from this comparison, only six different haplotypes were obtained with
H = 0.175, and the substitutions observed were limited to
intron unpaired terminal loops (data not shown). The
neutrality tests results for introns without the P1-extension were all negative and significant (Tajima's D = -1.99,

p < 0.05; Fu's F = -3.63, p < 0.02), suggesting a rapid population expansion.
Complementary strands of P1-extensions of the 17 haplotypes were translated in silico to amino acid sequences
according to Haugen et al. [4]. Open reading frames from
eight to 150 amino acids, were generated (Table 3, Figure
2) and were blasted against other available proteins in
GenBank with BLASTP [36]. Start codons for HEG were
found in all ORFs, however when compared to others
HEs, premature stop codons or stop codon deletions were
observed. His-Cys box motifs, zinc binding sites and
active sites were characterized on intron-coding complementary strands for six PSA individuals from three different populations (Haplotypes H2, H4 and H5, Table 3,
Figure 2). For the remaining introns, His-Cys box motifs,
zinc binding sites and active sites were only verified when
frame-shifts corrections were manually inserted in silico,
or were absent. These results indicate that P1-extension of
the 17 haplotypes are degenerated HEG.
Cox2-3 and rbcL-S analyses
Cox2-3 region was PCR amplified and sequenced for five
individuals of each population analyzed in this work
[GenBank accession numbers from FJ147587 to
FJ147626]. The amplified region has a total length of 457
bp for all individuals, being the cox2-3 spacer 167 bp long.
Variability among the 40 PSA cox2-3 region sequences
analyzed, yielded five different haplotypes (Table 4). Haplotypes differed from each other by one or two base-pairs
(0.2% to 0.7%), with H = 0.426. Similar to the results
obtained for the intron analyses, the Tajima's D values for
cox2-3 were negative (-1.42), but only marginally significant (0.05 < p < 0.10).

RbcL-S region was PCR amplified and sequenced for five
individuals of populations PSA-S, PSA-T and PSA-V, and
for two individuals of the remaining populations. The
region amplified is 570 bp long for all individuals, being
the rbcL-S spacer 77 bp long. A single haplotype was
obtained for all 25 analyzed individuals, with no divergence within and among populations [GenBank accession
numbers from FJ147668 to FJ147694].
Genetic relationships and population structure of PSA
populations
To determine the genetic relationships among the studied
PSA populations, three median joining networks were
constructed. The first one included intron + HEG
sequences (Figure 3A), the second was performed with
intron without HEG sequence data (Figure 3B), and the
third was constructed with cox2-3 region sequences (Figure 3C).

The network generated for intron + HEG sequences shows
three main clusters connected by median vectors, which
represent missing intermediates, that is extant haplotype
that was not sampled or an extinct ancestral haplotype
[37]. The first cluster comprises introns with 1054-8 bp
represented by haplotypes H1 to H5 and introns with 909
bp represented by haplotypes H6 and H7. The most common haplotype in this cluster is H5, which occurs in three
geographically distant populations (PSA-L, PSA-I, PSA-T).
Haplotypes H2, H4 and H5 present the intact His-Cys box
motif whereas haplotypes H1 and H3 present His-Cys box
only when frame shifts are inserted. Haplotypes H6 and
H7 present extensive deletions in the HEG, but still have
part of the His-Cys box motif. The second cluster comprises exclusively 791-2 bp introns without His-Cys box

To confirm whether the exons were ligated, a RT-PCR reaction was performed with primers 1400F and 18S3' using
the RNA previously incubated in the conditions described
above. The bands were excised from the gel and re-amplified with primers 1400F and 18S3' which anchors in the

motif, represented by haplotypes H8 to H13. The most
common haplotype in this cluster is H10, which is found
in populations PSA-G, PSA- S and PSA-T. The third cluster
comprises the smaller introns (616 bp and 744 bp) represented by haplotypes H14 to H17. The most common
haplotype in this cluster is H17, which is from population
PSA-V. The intron + HEG network shows a pattern of isolation by distance for PSA populations.
The results for pairwise Fst analyses of frequency of allele
size polymorphisms are presented in Table 5. It was possible to note three distinct patterns of significant Fst values, according to population geographic distribution.
Populations PSA-A,PSA-I and PSA-L presented significant
Fst values when compared to populations PSA-C, PSA-G,
PSA-S and PSA-T, and all of them presented significant Fst
values when compared to population PSA-V. Mantel's test
results found significant correlation between Fst values
and geographic distance (p = 0.028) corroborating the
hypothesis of isolation by distance suggested by intron +
HEG network.
The minimum spanning tree generated for intron without
HEG (Figure 3B) and cox2-3 region sequences (Figure 3C)
exhibit a star-like topology. For intron without HEG, the
most frequent central haplotype occurred in 9 out of 11
collection sites (39 of the 44 individuals; 89%). For cox23 region sequences, the majority of the individuals (7 of
the 8 populations accounting for 30 out of 40 individuals
analyzed; 75%) possess the most frequent central haplotype. According to both networks topologies, a recent
population expansion was detected for these markers.
Self splicing assays
Introns and exons flanking regions of one individual from
populations PSA-V (616 bp), PSA-G (792 bp), PSA-T (909
bp) and PSA-L (1055 bp) were cloned for in vitro transcription. Pre-RNA of the four individuals were incubated
at 45°C for 45 min to verify the self-splicing reaction. The
self-splicing reaction was observed, however just a part of

Characterization of introns size polymorphisms at
different PSA populations
Group I introns are well documented in the literature
occurring in the red algal genera Bangia and Porphyra
(Order Bangiales) [5,13-15]. Some of these group I
introns present ORFs of different sizes inserted in their P1
and P2 paired elements [3-5]. Size variation in these ORFs
represents different stages of the HEG cycle (full length,
degenerated or absent). Goddard and Burt [38] postulated
that the HE coded by an intron recognizes the intron
insertion site in an intronless population, invade it by lateral transfer and then it is vertically transmitted to the offspring. After being fixed with high frequencies in a
population, the HEG degenerates to a non-functional
state, and then the intron and the HEG tend to be lost. In
this way, the intron recognition site is reestablished
becoming available to be invaded again by an active HEGcontaining intron from the same species or from a closely
related species, thus restarting the homing cycle.

In a previous work, Oliveira and Ragan [2] characterized
three size polymorphisms for group I introns from three
PSA individuals. In this work, two more sizes were characterized, in a total of five different sizes distributed in 11
PSA populations along the Brazilian coast. According to
the cycle proposed by Goddard and Burt [38], HEGs can
be found in three different character states: functional
(full length), nonfunctional (degenerated) and absent
(both HEG and intron). In PSA populations analyzed in
this work, we could only detect the nonfunctional state
represented by HEG degeneration, indicating that full
length HEG containing intron was once fixed for these
populations. The different states of the intron + HEG are
not always found within natural populations, probably as
a result of insufficient sampling [1].
Müller et al. [5] evaluated if the cycle proposed by Goddard and Burt [38], applied to group I introns present in
the order Bangiales. Presence of introns containing degenerated HEGs, presence of introns without HEG and
absence of introns, all these states scattered along individ-

[39], likewise Porphyra fucicola and P. umbilicalis HEG
sequences [5]. As these sequences were not tested for

pseudogenes, as suggested by Müller et al. [5].
Cox2-3 and rbcL-S regions analyses
Cox2-3 and rbcL-S regions were sequenced in addition to
the SSU rDNA introns, to infer genealogical relationships
of PSA populations. Divergence among cox2-3 haplotypes
of the 40 PSA individuals sequenced ranged from 0.2% to
0.7%. These values are in accordance to the divergence
found among cox2-3 haplotypes from Grateloupia doryphora (0.3% to 0.6%) from North Atlantic and North Pacific
[19]. However, they differ significantly when compared to
the divergence among cox2-3 region from Batrachospermum helminthosum individuals from North America, 0.3%
to 6.5% [22] and from Acanthophora spicifera individuals
from the Hawaiian Islands, where a single haplotype was
observed [40].

RbcL-S region has been employed in Rhodophyta as a
marker at the inter-specific, intra-specific and intra-population levels [21,23,41-43], with levels of divergence of:
13% to18% for Gracilaria species [41] and 12.5% to
13.4% for individuals of the Gymnogongrus complex [42].
However, a unique haplotype from all the sampled range
(ca. 800 km) was determined for the rbcL-S sequences
from 25 PSA individuals.
Population structure and genetic relationships of PSA
populations
Genetic relationships of the 17 haplotypes (introns +
HEG) obtained from PSA populations were accessed
through network analyses. The network exhibit three
main clusters suggesting a pattern of isolation by distance
for the populations analyzed. The same grouping pattern
was obtained for Fst analysis. Mantel's test corroborated
the hypothesis indicated by the two previous analyses.
Therefore, isolation by distance appears to be the basic
process accounting for structure in PSA populations, manifested in a cline of HEG degeneration. Populations sam-

pled at the southernmost end of the distribution present
the entire His-Cys box motif, while the population sampled at the northernmost end of the distribution, considering the start codon proposed by Haugen et al. [4], has
only eight amino acids of the HE. Distributed between
these two extremes, are the intermediate-sized alleles.
The neutrality tests results for the intron without HEG
indicated a fast population growth from an ancestor population with small effective number. At the same time,
cox2-3 region results were marginally significant for the
neutrality tests and rbcL-S region results showed no nucleotide variability. The low variability in these markers, also
observed in the networks, is consistent with a demographic event of expansion from a population with low
effective number affecting all loci. These results are not
compatible to the HEG length polymorphism. The intron
+ HEG marker showed remarkable variation in length in
the same individuals that presented few variations for the
other markers. Therefore, in the same window of time,
much more variation was accumulated in HEG than in
sequence variation in the other three markers, which are
probably under different selection constraints. Considering the recent population expansion for PSA along the
Brazilian coast, degeneration of HEG was a very fast process. First, if we assume that a functional HEG have a cost
to the host cell, then natural selection will increase the frequency of nonfunctional elements; and second, if we
assume that the HEG was already fixed for PSA populations (there is no availability of insertion site), then the
frequency of nonfunctional elements will increase due to
low selection to keep a functional HEG [38].
Based on these assumptions, two different scenarios can
be proposed to explain intron +HEG evolution in PSA
populations: In the first scenario, the horizontal transfer
of intron + HEG occurred in an ancestral individual, prior
to the colonization of PSA populations in the Brazilian
coast. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the same
bottleneck event that was detected by the three markers
(intron without HEG, cox2-3 and rbcL-S regions) probably

had as a consequence the fixation in the population of the
full length HEG (functional). If the largest introns are considered as the ancestral state, then the oldest populations
are located in the southernmost end of the distribution,
and as long as individuals migrate to the north, their
HEGs tend to degenerate. This scenario is consistent with
the proposed hypothesis for intron insertion and evolution in the order Bangiales based on phylogenetics analysis of SSU rDNA and respective group I introns – Intron
horizontal transfer to an ancestor of the order Bangiales,
followed by vertical inheritance and evolution within the
order as proposed by Muller et al [5].
In the second scenario, the ancestral PSA individual lack
intron + HEG. It is possible to suggest that the horizontal
transfer of intron + HEG in PSA SSU rDNA occurred after
the event of demographic expansion. In this case, the
intron with the most degenerated HEG – with more deletions accumulated – is present in the oldest population.
This state was found in the northernmost population, suggesting a horizontal transfer event to have occurred in an
individual from the PSA-V population. After the horizontal transfer event, the functional HEG invaded the other
PSA populations by gene flow, being the largest HEG
present in the more recently invaded populations, at the
southernmost end of distribution. Within the context of
intron evolution in the order Bangiales, this scenario is
possible assuming the hypothesis that more than one
intron insertion events has occurred during the divergence
of the order [5].
This is the first report addressing intron evolution focusing on only one species. Understanding the mechanisms
beyond intron + HEG evolution has been a challenge,
despite all the knowledge obtained for these elements.
Self splicing assays
As self-splicing catalytic properties of group I introns are
highly dependent on intron three-dimensional structure
[44], we verified whether the occurrence of insertions in
P1 paired element alters intron catalytic activities, checking if introns sizes variants self-splice in vitro. One way to
check for intron excision is the confirmation of exons ligation [45].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/308

ity due to the presence of a HEG, they both would
probably be eliminated from the gene they were inserted,
since there is a strong selection against non-functional
rDNA genes.

Conclusion
Commercial exploitation, mariculture and introduction
of invasive species have been a major problem in the
assignment of Porphyra geographic origins. Phenotypic
plasticity along with a simple morphology is also an
obstacle in Porphyra identification. Furthermore, scientific
researches are more focused on taxonomy and phylogeny
of the group than in population surveys. Population structure of Porphyra spiralis var. amplifolia could be assigned by
HEG degeneration, although not by cox2-3 and rbcL-S
regions. Therefore, intron size polymorphism is a suitable
population marker for this species, and it can be rapidly
detected using PCR assay.
The intron size polymorphism found in the PSA populations, corroborate the HEG cycle proposed by Goddard &
Burt [38], indicating that the degenerated HEGs are reminiscent of the presence of a full-length and functional
HEG, once fixed for PSA populations. The cline of HEG
degeneration detected for PSA populations along the
Southern Brazilian coast, determined the pattern of isolation by distance. Analyses with the other markers indicated a demographic event of expansion for PSA, from a
population with low effective number. The maintenance
of the HEG apparently does not refrain the ability of the
intron to self-splice even when the different degrees of
degeneration of these elements are present.

The four intron size variants analyzed in this work selfspliced in vitro. Therefore, the occurrence of different size
polymorphisms in intron P1 paired element do not
refrain intron self-splicing mechanism, although there is a
hypothesis that the presence of HEG may diminish selfsplicing efficiency [1]. The loops are strategic localities for
HEG insertion. HEG have been considered invasive
mobile elements that remain neutral to the host when
inserted into introns, becoming invisible to negative selection [6]. If group I introns lose their self-splicing capabil-
