Discovery of permuted and recently split transfer
RNAs in Archaea
Patricia P Chan, Aaron E Cozen and Todd M Lowe*

Abstract
Background: As in eukaryotes, precursor transfer RNAs in Archaea often contain introns that are removed in tRNA
maturation. Two unrelated archaeal species display unique pre-tRNA processing complexity in the form of split
tRNA genes, in which two to three segments of tRNAs are transcribed from different loci, then trans-spliced to
form a mature tRNA. Another rare type of pre-tRNA, found only in eukaryotic algae, is permuted, where the 3’ half
is encoded upstream of the 5’ half, and must be processed to be functional.
Results: Using an improved version of the gene-finding program tRNAscan-SE, comparative analyses and
experimental verifications, we have now identified four novel trans-spliced tRNA genes, each in a different species
of the Desulfurococcales branch of the Archaea: tRNAAsp(GUC) in Aeropyrum pernix and Thermosphaera aggregans,
and tRNALys(CUU) in Staphylothermus hellenicus and Staphylothermus marinus. Each of these includes features
surprisingly similar to previously studied split tRNAs, yet comparative genomic context analysis and phylogenetic
distribution suggest several independent, relatively recent splitting events. Additionally, we identified the first
examples of permuted tRNA genes in Archaea: tRNAiMet(CAU) and tRNATyr(GUA) in Thermofilum pendens, which
appear to be permuted in the same arrangement seen previously in red alga.
Conclusions: Our findings illustrate that split tRNAs are sporadically spread across a major branch of the Archaea,
and that permuted tRNAs are a new shared characteristic between archaeal and eukaryotic species. The split tRNA
discoveries also provide new clues to their evolutionary history, supporting hypotheses for recent acquisition via
viral or other mobile elements.

Background
Transfer RNA (tRNA) genes play an essential role in protein translation in all living cells. Among the various
stages of maturation that are required to generate functional tRNAs, intron removal is a key processing event
occurring in precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) in eukaryotes
and Archaea. While the majority of these introns are
found one nucleotide downstream of the anticodon,
some archaeal species have introns scattered among seemingly random, ‘noncanonical’ positions in tRNA genes.
These noncanonical introns preserve a general bulgehelix-bulge (BHB) secondary structure that is similar to
canonical introns [1], and are found almost exclusively in
members of the phylum Crenarchaeota, with most species containing only a small number of noncanonical
introns. The hyperthermophile Pyrobaculum aerophilum
* Correspondence: lowe@soe.ucsc.edu

is an exceptional case, containing a total of 21 noncanonical introns in 46 tRNAs, more than four times as many
as in any other species [1]. With the availability of four
recently sequenced Pyrobaculum genomes (Pyrobaculum
arsenaticum, Pyrobaculum calidifontis, Pyrobaculum
islandicum, and Thermoproteus neutrophilus, to be
reclassified as a Pyrobaculum species), it was found that
P. calidifontis harbors a superlative total of over 70 tRNA
introns, the vast majority being noncanonical [2,3].
A separate but potentially related class of tRNAs
requiring unusual processing was first found in
Nanoarchaeum equitans, an obligate archaeal hyperthermophilic symbiont with an extremely small genome. It
contains six trans-spliced split tRNAs, encoded by genes
that are broken into halves and distantly separated in
the genome [4,5]. These trans-spliced tRNAs are similar
to pre-tRNAs containing canonical or noncanonical
introns in that they form a BHB secondary structure at
the exon-splicing junction, which is likely processed by

a common endonuclease [6]. Although this finding was
considered an exceptional process in an unusual organism, the discovery of trans-spliced tRNAs in the
free-living thermophilic crenarchaeon Caldivirga maquilingensis hints at a broader relevance [7,8]. Unfortunately, the large evolutionary distance between N.
equitans and C. maquilingensis, and the lack of similarity in characteristics between their split tRNAs limit
estimates of their age and the genome dynamics that
might be involved.
Atypical tRNAs are not limited to archaeal species.
Permuted tRNAs with a 3’ half positioned upstream of
the 5’ half, creating a BHB-like motif when paired at
their termini, were identified in the genomes of several
unicellular algae, including the red alga Cyanidioschyzon
merolae [9,10]. Various hypotheses have been proposed
to explain the existence of these introns and fragmented
tRNA genes, including a possible archaeal origin
[8,11-14]. However, the mechanism of their acquisition
and biological significance is still not known.
With the increasing number of sequenced archaeal
genomes, there are opportunities to uncover new cases
of exceptional tRNA encoding, which could provide
important clues to understanding the evolutionary origins and mechanistic details shared among trans-spliced,
permuted, and atypical intron-containing tRNAs. Here
we report two key discoveries with new evolutionary
implications. First, we describe four novel trans-spliced
tRNAs, distributed among half (4 out of 8) of the species with decoded genomes in the Desulfurococcales
branch of the Crenarchaeota. Unlike the trans-spliced
tRNAs previously observed in N. equitans and C.
maquilingensis [4,8], the genomic proximity of the
newly discovered tRNA gene fragments suggests relatively recent introduction into these genomes. Second,
we describe strong evidence for the first examples of
permuted tRNAs in Archaea, which have striking resemblance to permuted tRNAs recently found in eukaryotic
algal genomes. Our findings demonstrate that these special tRNA features are not as rare as once perceived,
increasing their biological relevance as well as providing
valuable additional data points for future efforts to
determine their origins and required co-factors.

Results
Split tRNAAsp(GUC) in Aeropyrum and Thermosphaera
consist of adjacent halves

Our initial investigation focused on tRNAs with properties that place them at the extremes of archaeal tRNA
characteristics. tRNA introns identified in sequenced
archaeal genomes have sizes ranging from 11 to 129
nucleotides with a median of 15 nucleotides [2]. Besides
introns of tRNATrp(GUC) that encode an embedded C/D
box small RNA (sRNA) [15-17], only one tRNA gene,

Page 2 of 11

tRNAAsp(GUC) of Aeropyrum pernix, contains an intron
exceeding 100 nucleotides (Table S1 in Additional file
1). Using an archaeal-specific version of snoscan [18],
and manual alignment to other predicted C/D box
sRNAs in A. pernix and other archaeal species, we failed
to find any trace of a C/D box sRNA that might explain
the long tRNA intron. Promoter analyses revealed a
strong signal in the middle of the tRNAAsp(GUC) intron,
including both the transcription factor B response element and TATA box, encoded on the same strand as
the tRNA gene. This high-confidence promoter prediction scores better than 88% of all predicted transcripts
in the genome (Figure S1 in Additional file 1), better
than 63% of the predicted promoters for annotated
tRNA genes in A. pernix, and is highly similar to the
promoter upstream of the 5’ end of the tRNAAsp(GUC)
gene (Table S2 in Additional file 1). The promoter’s placement predicts a transcription start site 20 to 25
nucleotides upstream of the 3’ end of the intron, consistent with production of a leader sequence of length and
high G/C content that is similar to leaders found in the
3’ halves of trans-spliced tRNA genes [5,8]
With the aid of an improved version of tRNAscan-SE
[19,20], we found that tRNAAsp(GUC) can be modeled as
a combination of two separate transcripts joined
between position 37 and 38, the canonical intron position (Figure 1a, Table 1). Similar to other split tRNAs, a
canonical BHB (helix-bulge-helix-bulge-helix - hBHBh’)
secondary structure at the exon-splicing junction is
observed, followed by a 14-bp G/C-rich stem. RT-PCR
with transcript-specific primers and sequencing of PCRderived clones verify expression of the mature tRNA
and the two tRNA halves (Figure 2a). To further confirm that the two halves are separate transcripts, we
conducted northern analysis with specific probes antisense to the two halves and the full-length 199-nucleotide precursor tRNA. Results show that the two pretRNA halves are present at their expected sizes, as is the
predicted mature tRNA (Figure 2b). Interestingly, an
amplified RT-PCR product corresponding to the size of
a 199-nucleotide pre-tRNAAsp(GUC) was observed, but its
absence in the northern analysis suggests this is a very
low abundance read-through transcript that may be
spliced, but does not contribute significantly to the
mature tRNA abundance. Thus, this tRNA may be a
true evolutionary intermediate between the intronspliced and trans-spliced forms.
tRNA Asp(GUC) in A. pernix is the first example of a
trans-spliced tRNA encoded by separate, but directly
adjacent transcripts. Upon re-examination of all tRNAs
in Archaea for a similar pattern, we found that the
tRNAAsp(GUC) ortholog in Thermosphaera aggregans, a
crenarchaeon in the same phylogenetic order Desulfurococcales, also appears to be split with the two halves

permuted tRNAs in C. merolae [9] are listed for comparison. The 5’ start value represents the coordinates of the 5’ start site of the mature tRNA. Pre, pre-tRNA;

joined at the canonical intron position (Figure 1a, Table
1). Similar to the arrangement in A. pernix, the 5’ half
of the T. aggregans split tRNA is located adjacent to the
3’ half. Unlike A. pernix, the two halves are encoded on
opposite strands in a convergently transcribed orientation (Figure 3).
To get an evolutionary perspective on the lineage of
this tRNA gene, we examined the syntenic region in
Desulfurococcus kamchatkensis, the closest sequenced
relative to T. aggregans. In both of these species, a
sequence of three genes is present: eIF-2A, Nop10p,
then tRNAAsp(GUC) (Figure 3). However, the end of the
syntenic region occurs in the middle of the tRNA Asp
(GUC)
, where apparently the ancestral, uninterrupted
form of tRNAAsp(GUC) observed in D. kamchatkensis has
been split and inverted in T. aggregans, by an unknown
series of genome re-arrangement events. Examination of
the tRNAAsp(GUC) genomic regions for syntenic blocks
in the eight sequenced Desulfurococcales species
showed that every species had genome rearrangements
downstream of tRNA Asp(GUC) , relative to every other
species, and three had rearrangements upstream as well.
The split tRNAAsp(GUC), along with many other tRNAs
[21,22], appear to be common positions for genome
recombination and/or viral integration. Although A. pernix and T. aggregans are both Desulfurococcales, they

are separated by four other species that are more closely
related, but lack the split tRNAAsp(GUC). Given that none
of the other six Desulfurococcales species have a split
tRNAAsp(GUC) , the most parsimonious explanation for
these observations is that a tRNA-splitting event happened relatively recently in two independent instances
among the Desulfurococcales (Figure 4). The agent
causing the splitting event could be specific for these
tRNA sequences, as there are only four nucleotide
changes between the A. pernix and T. aggregans tRNA
sequences. Notably, there are many more changes in
length and sequence identity (20 nucleotide differences)
in the complementary region required to join the split
halves, thus disfavoring the possibility of recent lateral
transfer of a precursor split tRNA gene. As such, these
are likely to be the first compelling examples of ‘late’
acquisition of split tRNA genes based on proximal
tRNA halves. Late acquisition has also been suggested
recently based on comparative analyses of non-canonical
tRNA introns [23].

tRNAAsp(GUC) using radiolabeled DNA probe that spans the mature
tRNAAsp(GUC) and the region between the two fragments. The
mature tRNA, 5’ half transcript and the 3’ half transcript are as
marked. No expression was found corresponding to the 199nucleotide transcript originally predicted as pre-tRNAAsp(GUC) with a
121-nucleotide intron. Bands at approximately 90 nucleotides and
125 nucleotides are expected due to cross-hybridization of highly
similar tRNA sequences in other tRNA transcripts. M1 and M2
represent the 10-bp and 100-bp RNA ladders, respectively.

a missing tRNALys(CUU) gene and an extra, low-scoring
tRNA Leu(CAA) prediction (26.23 bits versus all other
archaeal tRNAs score >30.0 bits). This suggested a
potential tRNA isotype mis-assignment. Indeed, closer
examination of the low-scoring tRNALeu(CAA) revealed

an almost exact match to tRNALys(UUU) from position
30 to the 3’ terminus, with no similarity upstream of
position 30. The single difference between these two
sequences is a U to C change, aligned to anticodon position 34 in tRNALys(UUU), consistent with the fragment
being the 3’ end of the missing tRNALys(CUU). Additional
sequence similarity searches identified a candidate 5’
half fragment of the tRNA Lys(CUU) encoded 4,500
nucleotides away (Table 1; Figure S2a in Additional file
1), ruling out the possibility of an extremely long polycistronic intron. Strong promoters matching the promoter consensus (better than 40% of other identified tRNA
promoters) were found at the expected distance
upstream of both candidate loci.
Intriguingly, the two halves of the candidate split
tRNA Lys(CUU) in S. marinus join between position 30
and 31, precisely the same position as in the split
tRNALys(CUU) of distantly related N. equitans (Table 1)
[5]. A canonical BHB (hBHBh’) secondary structure at
the exon-splicing junction is also observed, just as in N.
equitans tRNALys(CUU), followed by a perfect 13-nucleotide trans-pairing between the regions downstream of
the 5’ half and the upstream of the 3’ half (Figure 1b).
Fortuitously, the genome of another species in the
genus Staphylothermus, S. hellenicus, was recently
sequenced, enabling identification of the orthologous
split tRNALys(CUU), closely resembling the counterpart in
S. marinus (Figure 1b, Table 1). While the sequences of
3’ halves in the two species are identical, there is one
nucleotide difference near the end of the 5’ tRNA half.
The difference conserves a base pair in the trans-paired
region, changing the predicted G-U pairing in S. marinus to a G-C pair in S. hellenicus (Figure 1b), further
suggesting selective pressure to maintain a perfect 13nucleotide trans interaction.
These two closely related Staphylothermus species give
the first case in which the issue of genome stability and
split tRNAs may be examined. The neighboring genes
located upstream of the 5’ half (Smar_1316-Smar_1321,
Shell_1133-Shell_1128), in between the 5’ and 3’ halves
(Smar_1322 - Smar_1326, Shell_1127 - Shell_1123), and
downstream of the 3’ half (Smar_1327 - Smar_1332,
Shell_1122 - Shell_1116) retain complete synteny
between species, showing a lack of recombination or
integration events in this region (Figure S2 in Additional
file 1). However, tRNA genes are known to be positions
of genome rearrangement due to processes including
transposon and viral integration [21,24-26]. For context,
we examined genome rearrangement events adjacent to
the other 45 ortholog pairs of tRNAs, and found that 20
of them (44%) had a break in synteny either upstream,
downstream, or on both sides of the tRNAs. Thus, the
split tRNALys(CUU) arrangement since the divergence of
S. marinus and S. hellenicus has been preserved with no

has a typical linear tRNAAsp(GUC) which represents the likely ancestor of the split tRNAAsp(GUC) genes in A. pernix and T. aggregans. The 5’ and 3’
halves of pre-tRNAAsp(GUC) are located adjacent to each other in A. pernix and T. aggregans. The two halves in A. pernix are transcribed on the

local recombination, and is consistent with hypotheses
proposing enhanced genome stability from split tRNAs.
Permuted tRNAs in Thermofilum pendens have the same
structure as in red alga

We computationally screened for other atypical tRNA
transcripts by aligning tRNAs and their upstream promoter regions to identify unusual spacing between candidate promoters and predicted tRNA genes. When
applied to the thermophilic crenarchaeon Thermofilum
pendens, we found that the promoters of 44 mature
tRNA genes, out of a total of 46 in the genome, are
located in the upstream region between 30 and 49
nucleotides relative to the 5’ end of the mature tRNAs
(Figure S3 in Additional file 1), explained by natural variation in the lengths of 5’ leaders of pre-tRNAs. The
promoters of two outliers, tRNA iMet(CAU) and tRNATyr
(GUA)
, were found at positions -72 and -65, respectively,
implying 5’ leaders at least 16 nucleotides longer than
all others. Similar to the initial prediction of the split
tRNA in S. marinus, tRNAiMet(CAU) and tRNATyr(GUA) in
T. pendens scored relatively low (26.23 and 32.76 bits,
respectively, compared to >60 bits for other tRNA genes
in this genome). Secondary structure analysis showed
that these tRNA predictions fail to form requisite tRNA
cloverleaf secondary structure at the T-Ψ-C loop and
the acceptor stem.
Results from an improved version of tRNAscan-SE
[19,20] showed that the original predictions of tRNAiMet
(CAU)
and tRNA Tyr(GUA) in T. pendens are only the 5’
halves of these tRNA genes. For each tRNA, a precisely
matching 3’ half was found between the 5’ half and its

predicted promoter on the same strand, suggesting that
the two fragments belong to the same transcript, using a
single promoter (Figure S3 in Additional file 1). Primary
and secondary structure analyses strongly support that
these are circularly permuted tRNAs with a BHB motif
at the exon-splicing junction, located between positions
59 and 60. Unexpectedly, the split position is precisely
the same as the T-Ψ-C loop-permuted tRNAs identified
in the distantly related eukaryotic alga C. merolae (Figure 1c) [9]. The intervening sequences between the 3’
and 5’ halves of tRNAiMet(CAU) and tRNATyr(GUA) in T.
pendens are 7 nucleotides and 1 nucleotide long, respectively, in comparison to intervening sequences in known
algal permuted tRNAs ranging from 5 nucleotides to 85
nucleotides. Both of the genes also include a canonical
intron, indicating that permuted tRNA structure and
normal intron splicing are not exclusive processes.
Unlike the permuted tRNAs in eukaryotes, these two
archaeal tRNAs have genomically encoded 3’-terminal
CCA sequences, and the tRNA sequences are quite different from those found in red alga, ruling out a recent
inter-domain transfer between algal and archaeal species. However, the sequences and proteins flanking these
tRNAs share strongest similarity to species outside of
the Thermoproteales, suggesting these may have been
part of laterally transferred regions acquired after the
divergence from other sequenced Thermoproteales.
Both tRNAiMet(CAU) and tRNATyr(GUA) are single-copy
genes in T. pendens with essential decoding functions
that cannot be supplanted by other tRNAs, indicating
that processing of permuted genes is an essential activity
in this species.

Figure 4 Phylogenetic distribution of trans-spliced and permuted tRNAs in Archaea. Trans-spliced tRNAs were identified in A. pernix, T.
aggregans, S. marinus, and S. marinus in this study, in N. equitans by Randau and colleagues [4,5], and in C. maquilingensis by Fujishima and
colleagues [8] (highlighted in gray). Permuted tRNAs were found in T. pendens in this study (yellow), and are most similar to the permuted tRNAs
found in Cyanidioschyzon merolae, a eukaryotic algal species that is not included in the tree but would be a distant outgroup to the archaea
shown here. The phylogenetic tree was generated based on the concatenation of 23S and 16S ribosomal RNAs. Sequences were aligned using
ClustalW [48]. Alignments were manually adjusted using Jalview [49] to remove introns. The maximum likelihood tree was computed using
PhyML [50] with general time-reversible model of sequence evolution. Numbers at nodes represent non-parametric bootstrap values computed
by PhyML [50] with 1,000 replications of the original dataset.

Discussion
RNA trans-splicing, a processing event that joins two
separate transcripts, was first discovered in the messenger
RNAs of trypanosomes [27], Caenorhabditis elegans [28],
and more recently in human endometrial stromal cells
[29]. With the surprising discovery of trans-spliced tRNAs
encoded in the minimal genome of N. equitans [4], and
the most recent identification in a single unrelated crenarchaeal species [8], the broader significance and phylogenetic scope of these intriguing RNAs has remained
uncertain. Our discovery of four novel trans-spliced
tRNAs and two novel permuted tRNA genes greatly
expands the total number of rearranged tRNAs in the
Archaea to 18, in seven different species [4,8]. All archaeal
trans-spliced tRNAs have been found either in the crenarchaeal orders Desulfurococcales or Thermoproteales
(Figure 4), or in N. equitans, an endosymbiont of a Desulfurococcales species [30]. A re-examination of tRNA predictions in all sequenced genomes in the Crenarchaeota
did not show any additional trans-spliced or permuted
tRNAs, although we expect many more examples as the
pace of new genome sequencing accelerates [31].
Whether there are ecological or genetic characters
that distinguish organisms with split or permuted tRNA
genes from organisms that lack such tRNA variants is
an open and interesting question. Among the seven species now identified as harboring split tRNAs, the most
conspicuous ecological trait is that all are hyperthermophiles. Soon after the discovery of split tRNAs in N.
equitans and permuted tRNAs in C. merolae, Randau
and Söll suggested that split tRNA genes, like tRNA
introns, present a strategy for preventing the integration
of viral genomes or other mobile elements into otherwise conserved tRNA genes [11,32]. This is particularly
relevant for tRNAs in hyperthermophiles, which must
preserve a high number of strong G-C hydrogen bonds
in stems in order to maintain stable secondary structure.
In combination with the many other tRNA sequence
identity elements needed for proper modification, aminoacylation, and decoding function, this further limits
sequence diversity, making thermophile tRNAs more
similar to each other than in non-thermophiles. For
example, there are just seven nucleotide changes in the
mature tRNALys(CUU) between the phylogenetically distant Nanoarchaeum and Staphylothermus split tRNA
orthologs (Figure 1). However, it is worth noting that
many euryarchaeal hyperthermophiles (for example, Pyrococcus spp.) with similar constraints on tRNA G/C
content do not exhibit unusual tRNA variants. Thus, the
genomic or ecological factors that distinguish crenarchaeal species with many unusual tRNAs bear further
investigation.
One important distinguishing feature among the
major clades of Archaea involves differences in the

Page 8 of 11

makeup of their tRNA splicing endonuclease complexes
[33-35]. In the korarchaea and almost all of the
sequenced euryarchaea, the endonuclease is constituted
by just one protein, as either a homodimer (a 2 ) or
homotetramer (a4 ) [35]. In contrast, the crenarchaea,
thaumarchaea, and N. equitans contain two proteins
that form a heterotetramer endonuclease (a 2 b 2 )
[6,36-38]. Recent studies have shown that the splicing
endonuclease that removes introns from pre-tRNAs in
N. equitans and C. maquilingensis also processes split
tRNAs [6,8]. Our discovery of new split tRNAs only in
the crenarchaea strengthens a correlation between split
tRNAs and the heterotetrameric form of tRNA
endonuclease.
Pre-tRNAs across the archaeal phyla (Crenarchaeota,
Thaumarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, Korarchaeota and
three thermophilic euryarchaeal methanogens) contain
introns located at canonical as well as noncanonical
positions [1-3,39]. The majority of pre-tRNAs have zero
or one intron, although some include two or even three
introns [2,3]. Most of these multi-intronic pre-tRNAs
have been identified in Pyrobaculum and Thermofilum,
contributing to the highest tRNA intron counts
observed in Archaea in these genera. However, none of
the five sequenced Pyrobaculum species have any transspliced or permuted tRNAs. C. maquilingensis and N.
equitans have the most split tRNAs (six), yet each has a
relatively small numbers of tRNA introns. We concur
with prior suggestions that the evolutionary selective
pressures to maintain intronic or split tRNAs may be
similar [11]; however, the specific genetic component or
environmental vector(s) necessary for acquisition or
maintenance of split versus intronic tRNAs are potentially quite different. Discovery of split or permuted
tRNAs in five new species allows more focused searches
for requisite proteins, protein variants, or genomic properties that correspond to the species that support these
types of pre-tRNA variants. For example, it is now reasonably clear that small genome size, an important feature of N. equitans where split tRNAs were discovered
[4], is not strongly correlated with split tRNAs: C.
maquilingensis and the four Desulfurococcales identified
with split tRNAs in this study do not have exceptionally
small genomes among the crenarchaea.
The relative age of tRNA introns and split tRNAs has
been a matter of open debate as well. Di Giulio [40,41]
proposed that split tRNAs such as those in N. equitans
are the ancestral forms of the single-locus tRNA genes
observed in most genomes. Sugahara et al. [3] have suggested that the conserved intron sequences observed in
Pyrobaculum support a late, rather than early origin for
tRNA introns. In this study, instances of split tRNAAsp
(GUC)
from species in different genera, and instances of
split tRNALys(CUU) from species within the same genus

Chan et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R38
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/4/R38

suggest multiple, relatively recent splitting or lateral
transfer events within the Desulfurococcales. These are
fundamentally different from prior examples of split
tRNAs in several respects: the split halves are adjacent
or relatively close in the genome, there is just one split
tRNA per genome, and an orthologous split tRNA exists
to help gauge the age and stability of flanking sequences.
Careful examination of the exon-splicing junctions
reveals that tRNALys(CUU) in S. marinus and S. hellenicus
are ancestrally related and occur in a syntenic region of
their genomes that has been stable since their divergence. Examination of the disparate exon-splicing junctions between tRNA Asp(GUC) in A. pernix and T.
aggregans suggests two different local genome rearrangement events, created by a viral or mobile element that
targets precisely the same position in the same tRNA.
Viral genes that have integrated within tRNA genes
have been identified in the euryarchaeal species Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1 and Methanococcus voltae
A3 [21]. Integrated elements that overlap tRNA genes
have also been found in Sulfolobus and A. pernix
[22,26]. We observed six partial tRNA fragments in A.
pernix and one in T. aggregans (Table S3 in Additional
file 1), potentially due to other recent viral integrations
or rearrangements at tRNA loci.

Conclusions
The trans-spliced and permuted tRNAs identified in this
study indicate that rearrangement of tRNA genes is relatively common in at least one major branch of the thermophilic crenarchaea. Interactions between pre-tRNA
splicing, 5’ and 3’ trimming of pre-tRNAs, tRNA modification, and tRNA editing have not been thoroughly
investigated, but these present multiple related processes
that may modulate the ability to support split or permuted tRNAs. The discovery of the six uniquely rearranged tRNAs in the Archaea presents new
opportunities to study their evolution via their genomic
context and basic sequence attributes. Based on these
new examples, improved methods for detection, and
increasing availability of sequenced genomes, we anticipate numerous additional split or permuted tRNAs will
be identified for future study. The recent genomic
events leading to formation of the split tRNAs described
here illustrate an active, contemporary process in tRNA
evolution.

tRNA gene prediction

Trans-spliced and permuted tRNAs were predicted
using an improved version of tRNAscan-SE (manuscript
in preparation) [19,20]. Archaeal tRNA-specific and
BHB motif covariance models were created for similarity
searching using Infernal 1.0 [42] after pre-filtering possible candidates with tRNAscan [43] and an A/B box
motif detection algorithm [44]. A default cut-off score
was set to 20 bits.
Promoter identification

To generate a training set for promoter identification,
potential operons were predicted genome-wide with
the requirement of a minimum intergenic separation
of at least 100 nucleotides (on the same strand). A
16-mer motif search of the 90 nucleotides upstream
of known genes (not annotated as putative or
hypothetical genes) using MEME [45] was conducted
to identify the consensus promoter, including the
transcription factor B response element (one to three
adenosines) plus the TATA box. A position-specific
scoring matrix was generated from the alignments of
the MEME results after manual inspection. Each
organism’s position-specific scoring matrix was used
to scan the 150-bp upstream region of all non-coding
and protein-coding genes to identify potential promoter regions. Ten virtual genomes for each target genome were generated using a fifth-order Markov chain
to retain the base frequency of the target genome, and
scanned to identify the score distribution of false positives. The promoter candidates identified were filtered
according to expected position [46] and a threshold
P-value equivalent to that of the lowest-scoring
known gene.
Culture conditions for Aeropyrum pernix

A. pernix K1 was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany). A. pernix cultures were grown
in TY medium (0.4% tryptone, 0.2% yeast extract, pH 7)
supplemented with 3.86 mM sodium thiosulfate [47].
These cultures were incubated aerobically at 90°C and
collected at mid- to late-log phase. Cell pellets were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80°C.
Total RNA preparation

Materials and methods
Genomic data

Complete genomic sequences of A. pernix, S. hellenicus,
S. marinus, T. pendens, and T. aggregans were obtained
from NCBI RefSeq (accession numbers [NC_000854],
[NC_014205], [NC_009033], [NC_008698], and
[NC_014160]).

Total RNA was extracted from the frozen cell pellets
using a Polytron tissue homogenizer and TRI
Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). RNA
samples were treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA) to remove any residual DNA, reextracted with TRI Reagent, and normalized to 1.5
μg/μl.

Chan et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R38
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/4/R38

Genomic DNA preparation

Cell pellets were incubated overnight in SNET lysis buffer (400 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 20 mM Tris-Cl, 5 mM
EDTA) with 400 μg/ml proteinase K at 55°C. Genomic
DNA was then extracted from cell lysate using phenol:
chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. DNA samples were treated
with RNaseA to remove any residual RNA and reextracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol.
RT-PCR and sequencing

Total RNA from A. pernix was denatured at 100°C for 5
minutes and cooled on ice for 5 minutes. First strand
cDNAs were synthesized from denatured total RNA
using gene-specific reverse primers and Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at
65°C for 30 minutes according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. These cDNA templates were PCR-amplified
using forward and reverse primers spanning the mature
tRNAs, the 5’ tRNA halves, and the 3’ tRNA halves. PCR
parameters for 30 cycle amplification were as follows:
denaturing at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 68°C for
30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds, using
AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). Negative controls for the reactions were
conducted under the same conditions concurrently, but
without the addition of reverse transcriptase at the first
strand cDNA synthesis step. PCR products were cloned
with the pCR-2.1-TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid
DNA was extracted using Zyppy plasmid miniprep kit
(Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). DNA samples were
sequenced at the University of California Berkeley DNA
Sequencing Facility. Primers used for RT-PCR are as follows: forward primer for mature tRNAAsp(GUC) in A. pernix and its 5’ half, 5’-CGCGGTAGTATAGCCTGGA-3’;
forward primer for 3’ half of tRNAAsp(GUC) in A. pernix,
5’-CGGGCCTGCGGAGAG-3’; reverse primer for
mature tRNA Asp(GUC) in A. pernix and its 3’ half, 5’GCGGCCGGGATTTGAAC-3’; reverse primer for 5’ half
of tRNAAsp(GUC) in A. pernix, 5’-GCGGGGCCCTTGACAG-3’.
Northern blot analysis

Five micrograms of total RNA extracted from A. pernix
cell cultures was denatured for 3 minutes at 90°C in an
equal volume of 95% formamide gel loading buffer
(Ambion), resolved on an 8% polyacryamide-urea gel by
electrophoresis, and blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) by overnight electro-transfer. A 239-nucleotide sequence including the A.
pernix tRNAAsp(GUC) and the region between the two
fragments was amplified by PCR using A. pernix genomic DNA and gene-specific primers Sn-Ape-tRNA-Asp
(5’-CCCAGTGGTAAGATATGTGAACC-3’) and AsnApe-tRNA-Asp (5’-GGCCGCGAGGATTATTG-3’). The

Page 10 of 11

resulting PCR product served as the template for generating single-stranded, [a-32P]-ATP-labeled DNA probes
by linear PCR using Asn-Ape-tRNA-Asp. Hybridizations
were carried out at 42°C in UltraHyb buffer (Ambion).
Hybridization patterns were determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
