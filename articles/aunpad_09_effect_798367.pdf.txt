Abstract
Background: Malaria remains one of the most important tropical diseases of human with 1–2
million deaths annually especially caused by P. falciparum. During malarial life cycle, they exposed to
many environmentally stresses including wide temperature fluctuation and pharmacological active
molecules. These trigger malarial evolutionarily adaptive responses. The effect of febrile
temperature on malarial growth, development and drug susceptibility by mimicking patient in
treatment failure before and after drug uptake was examined.
Methods: Sensitivities of P. falciparum to antimalarial drug (chloroquine, mefloquine, quinine and
artesunate) were investigated based on the incorporation of [3H] hypoxanthine into parasite
nucleic acids or radioisotopic technique. The number of parasites was examined under microscope
following Giemsa staining and the parasite development at the end of each phase was counted and
comparison of parasite number was made. The proteome was separated, blotted and hybridized
with anti-Hsp70s primary antibody. The hybridized proteins were separately digested with trypsin
and identified by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint.
Results: The results show that febrile temperature is capable of markedly inhibiting the growth of
field isolate P. falciparum but not to K1 and 3D7 standard strains. K1 and 3D7 grown under heat
shock developed greater and the reinfection rate was increased up to 2-folds when compared to
that of non-heat shock group. The IC50 value of K1 toward chloroquine, mefloquine and quinine
under heat shock was higher than that of K1 under non-heat shock which is opposite to that of
3D7. Heat shock caused death in field isolated parasite. It was also found that the febrile
temperature coped with chloroquine uptake had no effect to the development, drug sensitivity and
the parasite number of K1 strain. In the opposite way, heat shock and chloroquine shows
extremely effect toward 3D7 and field isolate PF91 as shown by higher number of dead parasites
compared to that of control group. After culture under high temperature with artesunate, the total
parasite number of all strains including K1, 3D7 and PF91 was extremely decreased and the parasite
was not found at the end. Additionally, the expression of pfHsp70s was found in all strains and

conditions as shown in 120 kDa hybridized band. However, the proteome extracted from K1
grown under heat shock with chloroquine, anti-pfHsp70 interacted with additional three bands
identified by MALDI-TOF as elongation factor-1a (83 kDa), pfHsp86 (60 kDa) and phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (43 kDa).
Conclusion: In conclusion, febrile temperature was capable of markedly inhibiting the growth of
field isolate P. falciparum while the development, reinfection rate and drug (chloroquine, mefloquine
and quinine) resistant level of standard strain K1 was enhanced. However, the febrile temperature
coped with chloroquine had no effect to the development, drug sensitivity and the parasite number
of K1 strain. In the opposite way, heat shock and chloroquine showed extremely effect toward 3D7
and field isolate PF91 as shown by some died parasites. Heat shock protein 70 (pfHSP70) of strain
K1 under heat shock with chloroquine might involved in many pathways in order to sustain the
parasite.

Background
Malaria remains one of the most important diseases of
man with over half the world's population at risk of
infection and 1–2 million deaths annually. There are
four different species of human malaria parasites
namely, Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malaria, and
P. ovale. P. falciparum is the most dangerous malaria
species as it often leads to the death and can be fatal
within few hours of the first symptom [1]. The human
malarial parasite P. falciparum interacted with wide
temperature variation during its life cycle, ranging from
25°C or 26°C in the mosquito vector and 37°C in
humans, to 40–41°C during febrile episodes in the
patient [2]. It was found that the parasite number was
decrease and parasite growth was inhibited by febrile
temperature when cultured parasite in varying temperature ranging from 37 to 40°C [3]. The febrile temperatures could also synchronize parasite and inhibit the
parasite growth, although the ring stage resisted to the
high temperature [4]. However, the influence of such
repeated exposures to high temperatures on parasite
growth, development and drug susceptibility have not
been studied systemically.
Heat shock protein (HSP) is mediator for cytoprotection
and growth promotion [5] not only in the normal
condition but also in the continuation of life under
stress. The genes encoding three Hsp70 and one Hsp90
of the P. falciparum have been cloned [6]. The biological
roles of these proteins in malaria are not fully understood but it is possible that they help the parasite
through various stresses both in and out of the host [6].
The overexpression of PfHsp70 encoding gene producing
higher amounts of PfHsp70 proteins are probably
protect the parasite and survive in vivo during malaria
fever [7,8]. Together with drug, the effect of febrile
temperature toward parasite not only to the development, drug sensitivity but also to the heat shock protein
expression is very interesting to study. These data might

succor us to understand the complexity of this kind of
life and overwhelm this powerful parasite.

Methods
Culture system for parasite maintenance
Plasmodium falcifarum strains 3D7 (CQ-sensitive clone),
K1 (CQ-resistance clone) and 1 field isolate (PF91)
collected from endemic areas of Thailand were used.
They were kindly provided by Department Parasitology,
Pramungkutkalo Medical College, Thailand and Malaria
Research Unit, Department Pathobiology, Mahidol University, Thailand. All isolates were continuously cultured
using the standard methods [9,10] with modifications.
All of the test standard drug solutions were filtered
through a 0.2 μm acrylic filter sterile (Gelman Sciences
Inc, UK) prior to use. Complete culture medium was
prepared by adding 20 ml of pooled human serum, to
each 200 ml aliquot of stock RPMI1640 medium
containing L-glutamine without sodium bicarbonate
(Gibco URL, UK).
In vitro drug sensitivity assay
Sensitivities of P. falciparum standard strain and one field
isolate to chloroquine (CQ), artesunate (ARS), mefloquine (MQ) and quinine (QN) were investigated based
on the incorporation of [3H]hypoxanthine into parasite
nucleic acids or radioisotopic technique [11]. The level
of radioactivity uptake was used as index of parasite
growth.
Effect of febrile temperature on malarial drug sensitivity
In order to investigate the effect of temperature on drug
sensitivity of malarial parasites, the 5% parasite with
highly synchronous ring stage P. falciparum (synchronized 2–4 h post-invasion) was grown under the
temperature of 37°C (non-heat shock, non-HS) and
40°C (heat shock, HS). At the end, total parasite culture
was collected and used for in vitro drug sensitivity assay.

Effect of febrile temperature on malarial growth and
development
The culture of 5% highly synchronous ring stage parasite,
P. falciparum, (synchronized 2–4 h post-invasion) was
subjected to a temperature shift pattern at 40°C (phase
A) for 2 h followed by incubation at 37°C (phase B) for
an additional 18 h. Then the culture was shifted to 40°C
(phase C) for 4 h before turning down to 37°C (phase
D) for 24 h (figure 1). The experiments performed at 37°
C of all phases were used as non-HS control. The number
of parasites was examined under microscope following
Giemsa staining. The parasite development at the end of
each phase A, B, C and D was counted and comparison
of parasite number was made in order to examine the
effect of temperature on overall asexual development.

Effect of febrile temperature and drug stress on malarial
growth and development
The culture of highly synchronous ring stage parasites
(synchronized 2–4 h post-invasion) was grown under
temperature shift patterns (figure 1) coped with each
antimalarial drug, i.e., chloroquine and artesunate (at
concentrations of 40 and 1 nM, respectively). The
experiments performed at 37°C of all phases were used
as non-HS control. The number of parasite, parasite
development by the end of each phase was examined.
The total parasite culture was collected and used for in
vitro drug sensitivity assay as described above.

saponin (Sigma Aldrich, USA) with 50 μl of protease
inhibitor (PMSF) was added and further incubated at
37°C for 10 min. After that, the pellet was washed three
times with cool PBS buffer and sonicated at 25 Amp, on/
off 3 sec for 5 times after the addition of cool 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.4 (Merck, UK) and 30 μl of protease
inhibitor. The supernatant containing total proteins was
then collected after centrifugation at 4°C (12,000 × g)
for 30 min and 50 μl of protease inhibitor was added.
The proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a western blot membrane (Hybond-Cextra,
Amersham, USA). The membrane was incubated with
anti-Hsp70s primary antibody for 1 h and incubated
with secondary antibody for 30 min. The membrane was
incubated with the detection reagent (4-chloro-1napthol, methanol and H2O2) until the colour was
developed. The proteins on SDS-PAGE gel with the same
location with the hybridized bands were separately
digested with trypsin and identified by MALDI-TOF
peptide mass fingerprint. The data was searched through
PMF database search. The proteins identifications were
done by Bioservice Unit (BSU), NSTDA Building, Thailand.
Data Analysis
Distribution of the data (number of parasite counts)
obtained from all experiments during all phases will be
assessed by Komogolov Sminov test. Comparison of the
difference in number of parasite counts between two groups
(HS and non-HS) will be performed using paired t-test or
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, where appropriate. Statistical
significance level will be set at a = 0.05 for all tests.

Results
In vitro drug sensitivity assay
The level of chloroquine (CQ), quinine (QN), mefloquine (MQ) and artesunate (ARS) susceptibility was
determined as resistant or sensitive by using the criteria
of Pickard and colleague [12]. The IC50 value of standard
strain K1 used in this study against CQ, ARS, MQ and
QN was 100.511, 314.982, 10.940 and 0.424 nM,
respectively whereas the IC50 value of strain 3D7 against
CQ, ARS, MQ and QN was 11.332, 47.117, 18.208 and
0.434 nM, respectively. The field isolate PF91 showed
the IC50 against CQ, ARS, MQ and QN at 63.585,
37.886, 8.124 and 1.254 nM, respectively. There was no
evidence indicating ARS resistant therefore ARS susceptibility was not classified.
Effect of febrile temperature on malarial drug sensitivity
The strain K1, 3D7 and PF91 were tested for their
susceptibilities to CQ, ARS, MQ and QN when grown
under temperature stress or heat shock (HS) at 40°C for
2 h. The results showed that the IC50 value of K1 strain

different whereas the IC50 value of strain 3D7 grown
under HS was lower than that of non-HS (Table 1). The
effect of temperature on drug sensitivity (IC50) after heat
(2 h) followed by incubation at 37°C for an additional
18 h (new ring infection, NRF) showed the same result
to that of without NRF.
Effect of febrile temperature on malarial growth and
development
The laboratory strain K1 and 3D7 used in this study
contained only young intraerythrocytic parasites (ring)
as shown in figure 2A. The results showed that at phase
0, the parasites were at the same stage even in the HS
group after incubation at 40°C for 2 h. The parasite
number of K1 and 3D7 strains was not decreased. At
phase 0, the number of K1 and 3D7 parasite in both HS
and non-HS group after incubation at 40°C strains was 5
× 105 parasite infected red blood cell (PIRBC)/1 μl pack
red blood cell (PRBC) (figure 2).

When the temperature was down from 40°C to 37°C for
18 h (phase B), K1 strain grown under HS and non-HS
could maintain the total number of parasites at 5 × 105
PIRBC/1 μl PRBC (p = 0.423 at 95% CI). The total number
of parasites of 3D7 under HS was decreased from 5 × 105
PIRBC/1 μl PRBC (non-HS) to 4.9 × 105 PIRBC/1 μl PRBC
(HS). In addition, the morphology of K1 under HS and
non-HS at phase B was the same whereas some parasites
of strain 3D7 under HS died (figure 2 and 3).
At phase C, the HS group was exposed to 40°C for 4 h
after medium changing at the end of phase B. During

At the end of phase C, the parasite was cultured at 37°C
for 24 h (phase D) and the reinfection rate and
development were determined (Table 2). The parasite
grown under HS of both strains developed to trophozoite while the parasite grown under non-HS group did
not develop to tropozoite (figure 3).
Effect of febrile temperature and drug stress on malarial
growth and development
This experiment mimics the condition where malarial
parasite grown in patient's body with treatment failure
combined with fever. The strain K1 was co-cultured with
40 nM CQ and grown under non-HS and HS. The results
showed that the total number of parasite was not different
at phase 0, A and B while at phase C, the number of
trophozoite under non-HS with CQ was higher than that
of K1 under HS with CQ. During phase D, the number of

schizonts was similar in all conditions whereas the
number of ring stage under non-HS with CQ was higher
than that of under HS with CQ. Only K1 strain under HS
developed further to trophozoite (figure 5). The morphology of parasite in all conditions was almost the same.
Some of K1 schizonts under HS with CQ at phase C
showed some hyposegmented (figure 6). The number of
trophozoite stage at phase C of K1 under non-HS and HS
without CQ was higher than that of K1 under non-HS and
HS with CQ. Whereas the number of schizonts stage in K1
under non-HS and HS with CQ was higher than that of K1
under non-HS and HS without CQ.
The strain 3D7 was co-cultured with 40 nM CQ and
grown non-HS and HS. The results showed that at phase

The results showed that pfHSP70 antibody could bind
only to the protein with the molecular mass of 120 kDa
in all conditions except in K1 grown under HS with CQ
condition. There were four hybridized bands with the
molecular mass of 120 kDa, 83 kDa, 60 kDa and 40 kDa,
respectively from the total protein of strain K1 grown
under HS with CQ (figure 9).

As identified by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint
(Bioservice Service Unit, NSTDA) and searched through
the database, the band with molecular mass of 120 kDa
in all gels was identified as Plasmodium heat shock
protein (score 110) and pfHSP 70 (score 87). Three

the molecular mass of 83 kDa, 60 kDa and 40 kDa were
identified as elongation factor 1-a of P. falciparum (score

Malaria is still one of the most important tropical
diseases in human. In order to understand its complexity
and combat against this kind of life, the parasite
development, drug sensitivity and protein alteration of
parasite under stress such as drug or febrile temperature
is challenging. As indicated by in vitro drug sensitivity
assay, the standard strain K1 used in this study was
found to be chloroquine resistant but sensitive to
quinine, mefloquine and artesunate whereas the strain
3D7 was classified as sensitive to chloroquine, quinine,
mefloquine and artesunate. It is not surprising to find
that one field isolate PF91 presented a moderate resistant
to chloroquine because there was evidence showing that
the parasite resists to chloroquine in Thailand [13].
There was no evidence indicating ARS resistant. In order
to study the effect of stresses toward parasite, the culture
of 5% parasite with highly synchronous ring stage P.
falciparum was exposed to drug at IC50 concentrations
but all of the parasites died. Therefore, chloroquine and
artesunate concentration used in all experiments was 40
and 1 nM, respectively.
The human malarial parasite P. falciparum interacted
with wide temperature variation during its life cycle,
ranging from 25°C or 26°C in the mosquito vector and
37°C in humans, to 41°C during febrile episodes in the
patient [2]. This study has examined the influence of two
repeated febrile episodes on parasites growth by exposing them to elevated temperature twice, at ring and
trophozoite stage (phase A and C) with two recovery
phases (phase B and D). It was found that high
temperature did not inhibit parasite growth in all stages
of standard K1 strain and high temperature has no effect
to any stage of K1 in this study. In 1989, Kwiatkowski
found that ring stage parasite can resist to high
temperature up to 41°C while this temperature can
effect to trophozoite stage and developing schizonts
were particularly vulnerable [4]. This was represented
similarly to the work of Long and his colleagues in 2001
showing that the development of the parasites stopped
at late trophozoite and schizonts stage within the first
growth cycle at temperature above 40°C [3]. The
schizonts appeared pyknotic and hyposegmented and
the parasites failed to develop into new cycle. Moreover
they found that the effects of hyperthermic conditions
parasites growth on wild isolates were similar to those of

laboratory-adaptive strain [3]. These are not in agreement with our data and it may be due to the difference in
the length of time when the parasites were exposed to
high temperature. The parasite cultures were exposed to
a long period of high temperature up to 24 h in their
experiments while the parasites was exposed twice to the
short time of elevated temperature mimicking febrile
episode (phase A at 40°C for 2 h and phase C at 40°C
for 4 h) in our experiment. The adherence of red blood
cells infected with ring stage was also increased
considerably by brief heating and fever-induced cytoadherence was associated with enhanced expression of
PfEMP-1 on the ring infected red blood cell surface [14].
Moreover, Pavithra and colleagues found that a prior
heat shock had a stimulatory effect on parasite development during the subsequent exposure to heat shock.
These observations imply that appearance of repeated
febrile episodes in malaria patients can hasten intraerythrocytic development of the parasite [5]. These are in
agreement with our results. When the parasites were
exposed to Phase A at 40°C for 2 h following Pavithra
and colleagues in order to promote prior heat shock
effect [5], the laboratory-adaptive strains, K1 and 3D7,
under HS developed efficiently to trophozoite and
schizonts stage at phase C (pK1 = 0.032, p3D7 = 0.042
at 95% CI) and the reinfection rate of K1 under HS and
3D7 under HS (pK1 = 0.04, p3D7 = 0.05 at 95% CI) was
also promoted. The previous research found that the
effect of hyperthermic conditions on wild isolated
parasites growth were similar to those of laboratoryadaptive strain [3]. Our data shows that the survival rate
of field isolate PF91 was reduced (p = 0.05 at 95% CI).
The effect of temperature on morphology of field
isolated parasites was found similarly to that of Oakley
and his colleagues [15]. The temperature promoted the
presence of pyknotic form or "crisis form" which is the
appearance of parasites undergoing death [15]. The
appearance of crisis form was significantly evident
following 4 h of culture at 41°C [15] whereas the crisis
from of field isolate PF91 was found after heating for 2 h
following by incubation at 37°C. These results are not
found in K1 standard strain but trifling appeared in 3D7.
The effect of temperature on drug susceptibility of
parasites was tested to the parasites exposed to heat at
ring stage for 2 h followed by drug sensitivity tests
immediately. The result indicated that IC50 value to
chloroquine, mefloquine and artesunate of strain K1
under HS was higher than that of K1 under non-HS
significantly (p = 0.04 at 95% CI). The IC50 value of K1
under non-HS with quinine was higher than of K1 under
HS. The effect of temperature on K1 drug susceptibility
was similar to that of 3D7 only toward artesunate. It was
found that IC50 value to artesunate of 3D7 under heat
shock was higher than that of 3D7 under non- HS

condition (p = 0.04 at 95% CI). The IC50 value to
chloroquine, quinine and mefloquine) of 3D7 under
non-HS was higher than that of 3D7 under HS (p = 0.04
at 95% CI). The IC50 value of field isolate under HS
could not be calculated because heat shock causing death
in parasites.
The IC50 value of K1 under HS was higher than that of
K1 under non-HS whereas the IC50 of 3D7 under nonHS was higher than that of 3D7 under HS This might be
explained by the effect of high temperature toward drug
transporter reported by Cecilia and her colleagues in
1997 [16]. The chloroquine uptake by P. falciparum
infected erythrocyte is temperature-dependent and saturable and the existence of a specific parasite-encoded
protein that facilitates chloroquine uptake. For strain
with chloroquine resistant, the temperature does not
effect to chloroquine uptake whereas in sensitive strain,
temperature effects to chloroquine uptake. The increasing in temperature increases chloroquine uptake [16].
Although, there was no report in the effect of high
temperature toward mefloquine, quinine and artesunate,
high temperature might have some effects to drug
transport or drug mechanism by direct or indirect way
as shown in our study. When the parasites were heated at
40°C for 2 h and cultured back at 37°C until new ring
infected (NRF), the IC50 value of strain K1 and 3D7 was
similar to that of heating at ring stage for 2 h followed by
drug susceptibility testing immediately. The IC50 of field
isolate PF91 under HS and non-HS was not significantly
different (p = 0.5 at 95% CI). Therefore, high temperature shows some effects only toward the drug susceptibility of standard or laboratory strain K1 or 3D7 but not
to field isolate.
In order to observe the effect of temperature and drug by
mimicking the situation of treatment failure in malaria
patients coped with fever, it was found that high
temperature had no effect to the development of parasite
with chloroquine resistant (K1 strain). When K1 strain
was cultured with 40 nM drug under heat at ring stage
for 2 h (phase A), parasite developed to phase B similarly
to the other groups grown under HS or non-HS with or
without drug when compared by the total number of
parasite between these groups. These might be due to the
concentration of chloroquine used which is lower than
IC50 of K1 strain therefore the drug can not harm the
parasite. Additionally, K1 is chloroquine resistant strain
and it might have some proposed mechanisms such as
increasing in vacuolar pH, enhancing in drug efflux,
reducing in drug binding, losing in chloroquine transporter and changing in glutathione-S-dehydrogenese
(GSH) protein. After culture parasites at phase B
(37°C) for 18 h followed by heating again at 40°C for
4 h, the resistant strain was tolerant to high temperature

by comparing the total parasite number between these
groups. However, almost parasites developed to schizont
and trophozoite. After culture parasites at phase D, the
data indicated that temperature did not effect to the
reinfection rate of the parasite as compared by the
number of parasite at phase D.
The total parasite number of strain 3D7 between non-HS
and non-HS with chloroquine after phase B was
significantly different (p = 0.05 at 95%CI). This data
illustrates the effect of drug toward 3D7 development.
The total number of parasite between 3D7 under HS and
under HS with chloroquine was also significantly
different (p = 0.05 at 95%CI). This might be due to the
increase in chloroquine uptake [16]. Moreover, the total
number of parasite between non-HS with chloroquine
and HS with chloroquine was significantly different (p =
0.05 at 95%CI) indicating that temperature might also
increase chloroquine drug uptake of the parasite [16].
The total number of parasite at phase C and D between
these groups are significantly different. Therefore, high
temperature increases drug uptake and also coped with
second heat shock might induce higher drug uptake in
the parasite [16].
The field isolate is moderate resistant to chloroquine and
also the temperature has extremely effect toward parasite
development. This might explain the reason why almost
parasite after phase A can not develop to phase B.
Moreover, this might be due to the drug concentration
which is close to IC50 value coping with another factor
that is high temperature. These might promote more
drug uptake into the parasite and more parasites died
showing the direct effect of temperature.
When culture under high temperature with artesunate,
the total parasite number of all strains including K1, 3D7
and PF91 was extremely decreased at phase B and the
parasite was not found at phase C and D. The decrease in
the number of parasite in phase B, K1 (p = 0.01 at 95%
CI), 3D7 (p = 0.005 at 95% CI), field isolate PF91 (p =
0.01 at 95% CI) might be from the effect of artesunate
coped with temperature. This might indicate that all
parasites died at phase C or the sensitivity of this method
is not enough to detect. There was no parasite reinfection
during phase D. This might be from two reasons, first is
the level of the parasite after phase C was too low to
detect by the conventional method and the second is
parasite died since phase B.
It was found that anti-pfHSP70 binds to the proteins
extracted from all conditions. Not surprisingly, two
chaperones, HSP70 and 90 orthologs, which have been
implicated in the heat shock response across the
phylogenetic spectrum of life [15] meaning that

http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/8/1/19

pfHsp70s are stress response that will be expressed
when the parasite exposed to the stress such as high
temperature or drug. The proteome extracted from K1
grown under heat shock with chloroquine, anti-pfHsp70
interacted with four bands whereas anti-pfHsp70 interacted with only one band in another strain under
different conditions. After protein analysis by MALDITOF peptide mass fingerprint, the 120 kDa band from all
conditions is identified as heat shock protein 70 or
pfHSP70s. Higher molecular weight might be caused by
the complex formation of heat shock protein as
molecular chaperone. The pfHsp70 are chaperone complex consisting of pfHsp 90, PfPP5, tubulin and an
additional protein that is unidentified. The complex was
similar to that of higher eukaryotes both in term of size
as well as composition [5]. Normally, pfHsp 70 have six
homolog which are pfHsp70-1 with molecular mass of
74 kDa [6],pfHsp70-2 with molecular mass of 78 kDa
[7], pfHsp70-x with molecular mass of 76 kDa [17],
pfHsp70-3 with molecular mass of 73 kDa [6], pfHsp70-z
with molecular mass of 100 kDa and pfHsp70-y with
molecular mass of 108 kDa [17]. The 83 kDa hybridized
band was identified as elongation factor 1-a (EF-1a).
From the previous research studied in rat brain, it was
found that heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) correlated with
Hsp70, Hsp 27 and Hsp 90 was found after heating at
41°C. HSF-1 probably binds to Hsp70 and then EF-1a
binds to this complex to undergo phosphorylation [18].
The parasite might release EF-1a with direct availability
for complex formation with HSF-1 and heat shock
receptor (HSR) in the nuclease. Temperature and drug
stress possibly changes the capacity of EF-1a to form a
complex with other components of the initiation
complex. These are major possibilities that will be
explored in the future. The 60 kDa hybridized band
was identified as pfHsp 86. pfHsp 86 is the one of HSP 90
homolog which is normally binding with Hsp70 to form
a functional complex [19]. The 40 kDa hybridized band
was identified as phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl
group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the amino
group of the tetrahydrobenzylisoquinoline alkaloid
coclaurine [20,21]. This is a unique N-methyltransferase
in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. The
previous studies did not present any correlation between
heat shock protein and this enzyme so far. The reason
why pfHsp70 could bind to this protein will be explored
in the future.

Conclusion
Malaria remains one of the most important tropical
diseases of man with 1–2 million deaths annually which
mainly caused by P. falciparum [1]. In order to understand the complexity of this kind of life, the parasite

development, drug sensitivity and protein alteration of
parasite under stresses such as drug or febrile temperature is challenging. This will lead to the way to combat
this powerful parasite. The standard strain K1 used in
this study was found to be chloroquine resistant but
sensitive to quinine, mefloquine and artesunate whereas
the strain 3D7 was classified as chloroquine, quinine,
mefloquine and artesunate sensitive. The field isolate
PF91 presented a moderate resistant to chloroquine. The
drug chloroquine and artesunate concentration used in
all experiments was 40 and 1 nM, respectively.
The human malarial parasite P. falciparum interacted
with drug stress and also with wide temperature
variation during its life cycle. The standard strains, K1
and 3D7, under heat shock (HS) developed efficiently to
trophozoite and schizonts stage at phase C and the
reinfection rate of K1 under HS and 3D7 under HS was
also promoted. The appearance of crisis form of field
isolate PF91 was found after heating for 2 h following by
incubation at 37°C. These were not found in K1
standard strain but trifling appeared in 3D7 strain.
High temperature had effect to malarial drug sensitivity
in K1 strain different from that of 3D7 strain. The IC50
value of K1 toward chloroquine, quinine and mefloquine under HS was higher than that of K1 under nonheat shock (non-HS) whereas the IC50 of 3D7 toward to
chloroquine, quinine and mefloquine under non-HS
was higher than that of 3D7 under HS. The effect of
temperature on K1 drug susceptibility was similar to that
of 3D7 only toward artesunate. The febrile temperature
caused death in field isolate therefore the IC50 value of
under HS could not be calculated. This might be
explained by the effect of high temperature toward
drug transporter that the chloroquine uptake by P.
falciparum infected erythrocyte is temperature-dependent
and saturable and the existence of a specific parasiteencoded protein that facilitates chloroquine uptake.
Although, there was no report in the effect of temperature toward mefloquine, quinine and artesunate, high
temperature might have some effects to drug transport or
drug mechanism by direct or indirect way as shown in
our study. Moreover, high temperature after new ring
infection shows some effects only toward standard or
laboratory strain K1 or 3D7 but not to field isolate.
In order to observe the effect of temperature and drug by
mimicking the situation of treatment failure in malaria
patients coped with fever and drug uptake, it was found
that high temperature and chloroquine had no effect to
the development of parasite with chloroquine resistant
(K1 strain). However, high temperature and chloroquine
had effect toward 3D7 and isolate PF91 development.
After culture under high temperature with artesunate, the

http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/8/1/19

total parasite number of all strains was extremely
decreased at phase B and the parasite was not found at
phase C and D. No parasite was found at phase C in
group with high temperature and artesunate. This might
indicate that all parasites died at phase C.
High temperature coped with chloroquine promotes the
expression of heat shock protein 70. The proteome
extracted from K1 grown under heat shock with
chloroquine, anti-pfHsp70 interacted with four bands
whereas anti-pfHsp70 interacted with only one band in
another strain under different condition. After protein
analysis by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint, the
120 kDa band from all gels is identified as heat shock
protein 70 or pfHSP70s. Higher molecular weight may
be caused by the complex formation of heat shock
protein as molecular chaperone. The 83 kDa, 60 kDa and
40 kDa hybridized band was identified as elongation
factor 1a, pfHsp 86 and phosphoethanolamine Nmethyltransferase, respectively.
