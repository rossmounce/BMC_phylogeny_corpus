Abstract
Background: Affecting the core functional microbiome, peculiar high level taxonomic unbalances of the human
intestinal microbiota have been recently associated with specific diseases, such as obesity, inflammatory bowel
diseases, and intestinal inflammation.
Results: In order to specifically monitor microbiota unbalances that impact human physiology, here we develop and
validate an original DNA-microarray (HTF-Microbi.Array) for the high taxonomic level fingerprint of the human
intestinal microbiota. Based on the Ligase Detection Reaction-Universal Array (LDR-UA) approach, the HTFMicrobi.Array enables specific detection and approximate relative quantification of 16S rRNAs from 30 phylogenetically
related groups of the human intestinal microbiota. The HTF-Microbi.Array was used in a pilot study of the faecal
microbiota of eight young adults. Cluster analysis revealed the good reproducibility of the high level taxonomic
microbiota fingerprint obtained for each of the subject.
Conclusion: The HTF-Microbi.Array is a fast and sensitive tool for the high taxonomic level fingerprint of the human
intestinal microbiota in terms of presence/absence of the principal groups. Moreover, analysis of the relative
fluorescence intensity for each probe pair of our LDR-UA platform can provide estimation of the relative abundance of
the microbial target groups within each samples. Focusing the phylogenetic resolution at division, order and cluster
levels, the HTF-Microbi.Array is blind with respect to the inter-individual variability at the species level.
Background
Human beings have been recently reconsidered as superorganisms in co-evolution with an immense microbial
community living in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), the
human intestinal microbiota [1,2]. Providing important
metabolic functions that we have not evolved by our own
[3], the intestinal microbiota has a fundamental role for
the human health and well being [4,5]. Several of our
physiological features, such as nutrient processing, maturation of the immune system, pathogen resistance, and
development of the intestinal architecture, strictly
depend on the mutualistic symbiotic relationship with
the intestinal microbiota [6]. On the basis of its global
impact on human physiology, the intestinal microbiota

has been considered an essential organ of the human
body [7].
The composition of the adult intestinal microbiota has
been determined in three large scale 16S rRNA sequences
surveys [7-11]. The phylogenetic analysis of a total of
45,000 bacterial 16S rRNA data from 139 adults revealed
that, at the phylum level, only a small fraction of the
known bacterial diversity is represented in our GIT. The
vast majority of bacteria in the human intestinal microbiota (>99%) belongs to six bacterial phyla: Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The two dominant divisions are
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, which represent together
up to 90% of the total microbiota, with a relative abundance of 65% and 25%, respectively. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria are the
subdominants phyla with a relative abundance up to 5, 8,

2 and 1%, respectively. On the contrary, at lower taxonomic levels, we assist to a real explosion of the bacterial
diversity in the human GIT. At least 1,800 genera [≥ 90%
of sequence identity (ID)] and 16,000 phylotypes at the
species level (≥ 97% ID) have been identified until now,
predicting even a greater diversity at the species level [8].
Since 70% of these phylotypes are subject-specific, and no
phylotype is present at more than 0.5% abundance in all
subjects [12], the intestinal microbiota of each individual
has been shown to consist in a subject specific complement of hundreds of genera and thousands of species.
However, the large degree of functional redundancy
between species and genera allowed identifying a core
microbiome at the gene level which is shared between all
individuals [12]. Coding for genes involved in important
metabolic functions, this core functional microbiome is
fundamental to support the mutualistic symbiotic relationship with the human host.
Recently, 16S rRNA sequences studies have been carried out with the attempt to describe disease-associated
unbalances of the human intestinal microbiota. Even
though species variability was associated with inter-individual variability, phylum-level changes of the intestinal
microbiota were associated with specific diseases. In particular, obesity was characterized by a higher proportion
of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with respect to Bacteroidetes and an overall reduced bacterial diversity [12,13].
Differently, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were
characterized by a marked reduction of bacterial diversity
in the Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa belonging to Firmicutes, a decline in Bacteroidetes biodiversity, and a correspondent increase in Proteobacteria and Bacillus
[14,15]. Analogously, intestinal inflammation has been
generally related with a marked increase in Enterobacteriaceae and a correspondent decrease in members of the
resident colonic bacteria [16,17]. In the light of these
findings, it has been recently hypothesized that these
high level taxonomic unbalances of the human intestinal
microbiota can cause deviations from the core functional
microbiome with a final impact on the host physiological
state [12,18,19].
Since more than 75% of the phylotypes detected in the
human GIT does not correspond to cultured species [20],
phylogenetic DNA-microarrays have been recognized as
a valuable tool for a high-throughput, quantitative and
systematic analysis of the human intestinal microbiota
[21]. Recently, three different small ribosomal subunit
RNA (SSU rRNA) based high-density phylogenetic
microarrays for studying the human microbiota have
been developed [22-24]. Targeting thousands bacterial
phylo-types, these DNA-microarrays have been successfully applied in studies for the deep phylogenetic characterization of the human intestinal microbiota.

In order to specifically monitor the microbiota unbalances that impact on human physiology independently of
the inter-individual variability, here we developed an
original DNA-microarray for the high taxonomic level
fingerprint of the human intestinal microbiota, called
HTF-Microbi.Array (High Taxonomic Fingerprint
Microbiota Array). The relatively low number of targets
allowed implementing the Ligase Detection Reaction
(LDR) technology [25,26] for the development of the
HTF-Microbi.Array. This enzymatic in vitro reaction,
based on the discriminative properties of the DNA ligation enzyme, requires the design of a pair of two adjacent
oligonucleotides specific for each target sequence: a
probe specific for the variation (called "Discriminating
Probe", or DS) which carries a 5'-fluorescent label, and a
second probe, named "Common Probe" (or CP), starting
one base 3'-downstream of the DS that carries a 5'-phosphate group and a unique sequence named cZipCode at
its 3'-end. The oligonucleotide probe pairs and a thermostable DNA ligase are used in a LDR reaction with previously PCR-amplified DNA fragments. This reaction is
cycled to increase product yield. The LDR products,
obtained only in presence of a perfectly matching template by action of the DNA ligase, are addressed to a precise location onto a Universal Array (UA), where a set of
artificial sequences, called Zip-codes are arranged. These
products carry both the fluorescent label and a unique
cZipCode sequence and can be detected by laser scanning and identified according to their location within the
array. The LDR approach is a highly specific and sensitive
assay for detecting single nucleotide variations; thus, differences of a single base along the 16S rRNA gene can be
employed to distinguish among different microbial lineages. The HTF-Microbi.Array was successfully tested in
a pilot study for the characterization of the faecal microbiota of eight healthy young adults.

Results
Target selection and probe design

The rational selection of the HTF-Microbi.Array targets
was carried out using a phylogenetic approach. To this
aim we implemented the 16S rRNA database of the ARB
Project (release February, 2005) with the 16S rRNA gene
database of the RDP available at the time and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Based on the tree nodes, 30
phylogenetical groups of the human intestinal microbiota
were rationally selected as the target group for the HTFMicrobi.Array (Additional file 1). In Fig. 1 we report the
phylogenetic tree of the 16S rRNA sequences of the HTFMicrobi.Array positive set. The selected groups belonged
to different phylogenetic levels (species, genus, family,
cluster, or group of species indicated by the warding "et
rel."). The entire list of the array targets is represented in
Table 1. For part of the division Firmicutes, the target

together. The phylogenetic tree was obtained by using the neighbour-joining algorithm for the sequence alignment in ARB software.

selection was carried out based on the classification proposed by Collins et al. [27]. Clostridium cluster I and II,
Clostridium cluster IX, Clostridium cluster XI, and
Clostridium cluster XIVa were selected. For the Clostridium cluster IV, four subgroups of species were defined:
Ruminococcus albus et rel., Ruminococcus bromii et rel.,
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii et rel., and Oscillospira
guillermondii et rel. Within the Firmicutes division, the
family Lactobacillaceae, and the groups Bacillus clausii et
rel., Bacillus subtilis et rel., Bacillus cereus et rel., Enterococcus faecalis et rel., and Enterococcus faecium et rel.
were also selected. Other selected groups were the Bacteroides/Prevotella cluster (division Bacteroidates), the
family Bifidobacteriaceae (division Actinobacteria), the
family Enterobacteriaceae and the genus Campylobacter
(division Proteobacteria). For clusters or families, relevant species, genera or subgroups of species were
selected to design "sub-probes". The genus Veillonella
was selected for Clostridium cluster IX, the species
Eubacterium rectale for Clostridium cluster XIVa,
Clostridium difficile for Clostridium cluster XI, and
Clostridium perfringens for Clostridium cluster I and II.
The group Bifidobacterium longum et rel. was chosen for
the family Bifidobacteriaceae, and the genera Yersinia
and Proteus for the Enterobacteriaceae. Based on an original phylogenetic design, the entire probe set of the HTFMicrobi.Array cover up to 95% of the bacterial groups
belonging to the human intestinal microbiota [28].
Specificity and coverage of each candidate probe was
assessed by using the tool Probe Match of the RDP database. The probe pairs selected for the HTFMicrobi.Array were required to perfectly match the
sequences of the positive set and to possess at least a mismatch at the 3' end of the discriminating probe respect to
the entire negative set. The designed probes pairs had an
average melting temperature (Tm) of 67.8 ± 0.9°C (n = 60)
and an average length of 35.6 ± 4.9 nucleotides. Sixteen
out of the 30 probe pairs were characterized by having no
degenerated bases, whereas only one probe pair (i.e. the

one for Clostridium cluster I and II) had 4 and 3 ambiguous bases on DS and CP, respectively (Additional file 2).
Validation of the HTF-Microbi.Array
LDR probe pair specificity

The specificity of the designed LDR probe pairs was
tested by using 16S rRNA PCR amplicons from 28 microorganisms members of the human intestinal microbiota.
Amplicons were prepared by amplification of genomic
DNA extracted from DSMZ cultures or genomic DNA
from ATCC collection. Proving the specificity of the
HTF-Microbi.Array all the 16S rRNA amplicons were
properly recognized in separate LDR hybridization reactions with the entire probe set of the array. Two replicated
independent LDR-UA experiments were performed with
an optimal reproducibility (Additional file 3). For each of
the 16S rRNA template only group-specific spots, and
spots corresponding to the hybridization controls
showed positive signals (P < 0.01) (Table 2). As a negative
control, we performed two independent PCR-LDR-UA
experiments using double distilled water, instead of
genomic DNA, as sample. As expected, no positive signal
was detected. The ratio between the signal intensities of
the specific probes and the blank intensity (SNRs) averaged 206.9 ± 185.7, whereas the ratio between all the
other probes and the blank intensity (SNRns) averaged 2.1
± 1.4. Therefore, the ratio between specific and non-specific probes resulted more than 100 fold on average.
Evaluation of the LDR sensitivity and relative abundance
detection level

In order to define the detection limits of the HTFMicrobi.Array, LDR-UA experiments were carried out
with different concentrations of an artificial mix of 16S
rRNA amplicons from 6 members of the human intestinal
microbiota. The 16S rRNA amplicons from Bacillus
cereus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium adolescentis,
Ruminococcus albus, Prevotella, Y. enterocolitica were all
specifically recognized in a range of concentrations from
0.7 to 75 fmol (P < 0.01), demonstrating the high sensitivity and specificity of the array (Fig. 2). Subsequently, in

Table reporting the results of the tests to assess probe specificity: 28 bacterial DNA targets were chosen to validate the probe pairs. For each
DNA analyzed we report: probe pair showing significant signals, SNRs, SNRns (see main text for acronym definitions). The p-values of specific
probes are reported for each duplicate experiment. Where needed (i.e. more than one probe pair was present), data are the average of the
positive signals (for both SNRs and p-values)

order to evaluate the relative abundance detection level of
the HTF-Microbi.Array, LDR-UA experiments were performed on hybridization mixes containing low quantities
of Escherichia coli PCR products and increasing amounts
of human genomic DNA. This is a fundamental issue in
the case of single species present in the gut microbiota at
very low fractional abundance (< 0.1%) [21]. According to

our data, 1 fmol of E. coli amplicon was sufficient (p <
0.005) to be detected in all the tested conditions (from up
to 6.3 μg of human gDNA) (Additional file 4). Considering the PCR product as a ~1700 bp amplicon, 1 fmol corresponds to 1.2 ng and, thus, the sensitivity limit results
0.02%.

six members of the human intestinal microbiota: B. cereus, L. casei, B. adolescentis, R. albus, Prevotella, Y. enterocolitica. Amplicons were tested in a concentration ranging from 0.7 to 75 fmol. Blue stars over the fluorescence bars indicate the probes that gave a positive response with a P < 0.01. Red
dots indicate that one or two replicates out of four for each ZipCode were excluded because of having an IF < 2.5 times the average of the spots.

Characterization of the faecal microbiota of eight healthy
young adults

The HTF-Microbi.Array was applied in a pilot study for
the characterization of the faecal microbiota of eight
young adults. For all subjects faecal DNA was extracted,
total bacterial 16S rRNA amplified, and two separate
LDR-UA experiments were carried out (Additional file 5).
For each sample a profile of presence-absence probes
response was obtained. The cluster analysis of the phylogenetic fingerprints showed that, with the exception of
subject n. 2, samples from the same subject clustered
together. The reproducibility of the experiments was
evaluated by considering the percentage of the probes
giving the same response in both the technical replicates
of each sample. With the exclusion of subject n. 2, an
average reproducibility of 96% was obtained for all the
subject under study, demonstrating a good reproducibility of the microbiota fingerprints obtained using the

HTF-Microbi.Array (Fig. 3). As expected, the major
mutualistic symbionts of the human intestinal microbiota, such as Bacteroidetes and the members of the
Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa, were represented in the
faecal microbiota of all the subjects. With the exception
of B. clausii et rel., minor mutualistic symbionts such as
Actinobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, B. subtilis et rel., Fusobacterium, and Cyanobacteria were detected only in different sub-fractions of the subjects. In particular, subjects
n. 17, 15, 4, and 1 were characterized by the presence of
Fusobacterium. Subjects n. 4, 15 and 17 possessed B. subtilis et rel., while subjects n. 4, 1, 9, 16 and 5 harboured
Cyanobacteria in their faecal microbiota. On the other
hand, only a fraction of the subjects, clustering on the left
side of the map, presented opportunistic pathogens in
their faecal microbiota. Subjects n. 17, 15 and 4 presented
both Proteus and E. faecalis et rel., while in subject n. 15
members of the Clostridium cluster I and II and Yersinia

Figure 3 Phylogenetic fingerprints. Cluster analysis of the phylogenetic fingerprint of 16 faecal samples from 8 young adults. Response of each of
the HTF-Microbi.Array probes for what concerns presence/absence of the target group is showed: positive response in red (P < 0.01), negative responses in blue (P > 0.01). Gary lines below the samples indicate adjacent replicated LDR of the same sample.

et rel. were also detected. For each subject the relative fluorescence intensity (IF) contribution of each HTFMicrobi.Array probes, in terms of percentage of the total
IF, was also calculated (Fig. 4). The mean of IF data from
both the LDR-UA experiments were considered. Even if
all subjects were characterized by a specific individual
profile, a common trend can be found by comparing the
comprehensive relative IF contribution of probes targeting major mutualistic symbionts (Bacteroides/Prevotella,
Clostridium clusters IV, IX, and XIVa), minor mutualistic
symbionts (Bifidobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, B.
clausii et rel., B. subtilis et rel., Fusobacterium, and
Cyanobacteria), and opportunistic pathogens (Clostridium clusters I and II, IX, E. faecalis et rel., E. faecium et
rel., B. cereus et rel., Enterobacteriaceae, Yersinia, Proteus,
Campylobacter). In particular, for all subjects the highest
relative IF contributions were obtained for major mutualistic symbionts. The contribution of Bacteroides/Prevotella ranged between 8-37%, whereas the contribution
of Clostridium clusters IV, IX, and XIVa ranged between
17-34%, 3-15%, and 5-29%, respectively. Differently,
minor mutualistic symbionts were characterized by lower

values of relative IF contributions. Bifidobacteriaceae
contributed for the 0.5-3.1%, Lactobacillaceae for the 1.59.4%, B. clausii et rel. for the 4-13%, B. subtilis et rel. for
the 0.6-2.5%, Fusobacterium for the 1.2-4.4%, and
Cyanobacterium for 0.6-4.5%. As expected, opportunistic
pathogens showed together the lowest relative IF contribution in all the subjects under study (from 5 to 10%).

Discussion
In these last years, 16S rRNA microarrays emerged as a
sensitive and efficient way to screen complex bacterial
communities. Here we describe and validate the HTFMicrobi.Array, a new phylogenetic DNA microarray
designed for the high taxonomic level fingerprint of the
human intestinal microbial community. The HTFMicrobi.Array is based on the LDR-UA approach, which
is a fast and sensitive tool for the characterization of complex microbial communities with high sensitivity and
specificity [25,26]. The use of this molecular technique
allows overcoming the major limitations of DNA
microarrays whose discriminative power is based on
hybridization. In fact, a) optimization of the hybridiza-

Figure 4 IF relative contribution. For each sample the entire HTF-Microbi.Array probe set was considered and their relative IF contribution was calculated as percentage of the total IF. Sub-probes were excluded and for each subject data from two separate LDR-universal array experiments were
taken onto consideration. The averaged IF from both the LDR-Universal Array experiments was considered. The principal intestinal groups of major
mutualistic symbionts are indicated: Bacteroides/Prevotella (B/P) blue, Clostridium cluster IV (Cl.IV) green, Clostridium cluster IX (Cl.IX) brown, Clostridium
cluster XIVa (Cl.XIVa) dark brown. Lactobacillus, B. clausii, B. subtilis, Fusobacterium and Cyanobacteria are grouped as minor mutualistic symbionts (minor) indicated in yellow. Proteus, Yersinia and E. faecalis are grouped as opportunistic pathogens (opp) in red.

tion conditions for each probe set is not required; b)
problems due to the secondary structures of the target
DNA are minimized, c) steric hindrances of differentially
sized nucleic acid hybrids formed on the array after the
hybridization are decreased [29]. The final probe set of
the HTF-Microbi.Array allows a high taxonomic level
fingerprint of the human intestinal microbiota, with a
good coverage of the major and minor components, as
well as some of the most important pathogens and opportunistic bacteria [30]. The LDR probes were designed by
choosing DS oligonucleotides whose 3'end allowed the
perfect discrimination of the target species from the nontarget ones on the basis of our 16S rRNA sequence database. Definition of accurate and specific negative sets of
gut microbiota sequences by ORMA tool [31] allowed the
selection of maximally discriminative probe pairs. Probe
specificity was confirmed on the entire known 16S rRNA
gene sequences environment by the RDP Probe Match
tool. This requirement is fundamental, since the primer
set used for the PCR amplification was the "universal" 16S
rRNA primer set designed by Edwards and co-workers
[32].

The HTF-Microbi.Array recognized without ambiguity the 16S rRNA amplicons obtained from 28 members
of the intestinal microbiota belonging to Bacteroides/Prevotella, Clostridium clusters IV, IX, XIVa, XI, I and II,
Bifidobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Bacillus, Enterococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Campylobacter, demonstrating the specificity of all the probe pairs. The sensitivity of
the HTF-Microbi.Array was evaluated by using different
concentrations of an artificial mix of 16S rRNA amplicons obtained from 6 microorganisms members of the
human intestinal microbiota. To compensate the eventual
drop in the signal due to a very low target concentrations,
lower than 0.7 fmol (i.e. a percentage lower than 1.5% of
the commonly used quantity of 50 fmol), a slightly
relaxed criteria for significance of the t-test to α = 0.05
was chosen. All PCR products were specifically recognized in a concentration range from 75 to 0.7 fmol, showing high array sensitivity. The efficiency of the HTFMicrobi.Array in the detection of a particular target in a
complex DNA environment was also determined.
According to our data, the array is able to detect a specific
DNA target down to 0.02% of the total 16S rRNA, which

Candela et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/116

is comparable to the values obtained by Rajilic-Stojanovic
et al. [23] and Palmer et al. [21]. Thus the HTFMicrobi.Array shows the potentiality to sense low abundant species of the gastrointestinal microbiota, enabling
the detection of the 16S rRNA of a peculiar target group
present at a fractional abundance <0.1% in an artificial
mixture.
The HTF-Microbi.Array was used in a pilot study to
characterize the faecal microbiota of eight young adults.
Faecal microbiota was chosen as DNA source since sample collection is not invasive, samples contain large
amount of microbes, and, most important, it is representative of interpersonal differences in distal gut microbial
ecology [33]. In order to have a good representation of
the less abundant species of the intestinal microbial community, LDR reactions were performed starting from 50
fmol of PCR product. Cluster analysis of the presenceabsence probes profiles enabled the identification of a
reproducible high taxonomic level microbiota fingerprint
for each subject. As expected, the intestinal microbial
community of the voluntaries in the study resembled the
typical fingerprint of healthy adults [28]. According to
our data, the faecal microbiota of the enrolled subjects
was dominated by major mutualistic symbionts. In fact,
members of Bacteroidetes, Clostridium clusters IV, IX
and XIVa were all represented in 100% of the subjects. On
the other hand, minor mutualistic symbionts, such as
Lactobacillaceae, B. subtilis et re., Fusobacterium and
Cyanobacteria, were detected in 55, 37, 50, and 63% of
the subjects, respectively. Opportunistic pathogens, such
as E. faecalis et rel., members of the Clostridium cluster I
and II and Enterobacteriaceae, were represented only in
43, 25 and 12% of the subjects, respectively. Most importantly, enteropathogens such as, C. difficile, C. perfringens, E. faecium et rel., B. cereus et rel., and
Campylobacter were never detected. A discrepancy
between our data and the literature is the relatively low
prevalence of the health promoting Bifidobacteriaceae in
our samples (only 13% of samples). However, the low
prevalence of bifidobacteria is a typical bias for several
phylogenetic DNA microarrays [22,23]. Probably this is
due to the intrinsic low efficiency of amplification of the
bifidobacterial genome with universal primer sets for the
16S rRNA gene [8]. Surprisingly, a high prevalence was
obtained for the minor mutualistic symbiont B. clausii et
rel., 100% of samples, and the opportunistic pathogen
Proteus, 50% of samples. For each subject the relative IF
contributions of the probes were calculated, obtaining an
approximate evaluation of the relative abundance of the
principal microbial groups of the faecal microbiota. In
general agreement with previous metagenomic studies
[7-11] and SSU rRNA phylogenetic microarray investigations [22,23], mutualistic symbionts such as Bacteroidetes, Clostridium clusters IV, IX and XIVa largely

Page 12 of 16

dominated the faecal microbiota, contributing for the 65
to 80% of total microbiota, depending on the subject. Differently, with an overall contribution ranging from 10 to
30%, minor mutualistic symbionts such as B. clausii et
rel., Bifidobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, B. subtilis et
rel., Fusobacterium, and Cyanobacteria were largely subdominant. Opportunistic pathogens represented only a
small fraction of the intestinal microbiota. Even if subjects under study show a common trend when the ratio
between the relative IF of major, minor and opportunistic
components were considered, differences in the relative
IF contribution of single probes were detectable and subject specific profiles were identified. For instance, subject
n. 1 showed a higher relative fluorescence for probes targeting major mutualistic symbionts and a lower relative
fluorescence for minor mutualistic symbionts and opportunistic pathogens than subjects n. 4 and 15. On the other
hand subjects n. 15 and 17 were characterized by a lower
ratio Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes with respect to all the
other subjects. It is tempting to hypothesize that differences in relative IF contribution within samples could
represent an approximation of differences in relative
abundances of the targeted groups in the faecal microbiota. However, caution must be taken when microarray
based methods for the relative quantification of bacterial
groups in complex microbial communities are used. In
fact, biases are introduced at several levels of the experimental procedure: DNA extraction and purification, PCR
amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, and interspecies
variation of the rRNA gene copy number [21].

Conclusion
The HTF-Microbi.Array has been revealed a fast and sensitive tool for the high taxonomic level fingerprint of the
human intestinal microbiota in terms of presence/
absence of the principal groups. Since the flexibility of the
universal array platform allow the addition of new probe
pairs without a further optimization of the hybridization
conditions [25,26], the HTF-Microbi.Array can be easy
implemented with the addition of new probe pairs targeting emerging microbial groups of the human intestinal
microbiota, such as, for instance, the mucin degrading
bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila [34]. The evaluation
of the relative abundance of the target groups on the
bases of the relative IF probes response still has some hindrances. However, considered all the possible biases (i.e.
DNA extraction/purification, PCR, copy number variations, etc.) typical of the microarray technology, analysis
of IFs from our LDR-UA platform can be useful in the
estimation of the relative abundance of the targets groups
within each sample. Focusing the phylogenetic resolution
at division, order and cluster levels, the HTFMicrobi.Array results blind with respect to the inter-individual variability at the species level. Its potential to char-

acterize the high order taxonomic unbalances of the
human intestinal microbiota associated with specific diseases will be assessed in further studies.

Probe design

Eight healthy Italian individuals of 30 years old were
enrolled for the study. None of the subjects had dietary
restrictions except for antibiotics, probiotics and functional foods for at least 4 weeks prior to sampling. None
of the selected subjects had a history of gastrointestinal
disorders at the time of sampling. The study protocol was
approved by the Ethical committee of Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, Italy) and an informed consent
was obtained from each enrolled subject. Faeces were
collected for each subject and stored at -20°C.

Multiple alignment step of the selected sequences was
performed in ClustalW [38]. Since the taxonomic classification of the 30 groups selected for the probe design varied from species to phylum level, careful grouping of the
sequences was performed for the multiple alignment
step: (a) for higher level probes, only family/phylum consensus sequences were used as a negative set for probe
design; (b) for genus/species level probes, only sequences
belonging to other families/phyla were selected. All the
LDR probe pairs were designed using ORMA [31]. Both
DS and CP were required to be between 25 and 60 bases
pair, with a Tm of 68 ± 1°C, and with maximum 4 degenerated bases. In-silico check versus a publicly available
database (i.e.: RDP) was then performed for assessing
probe pair specificity.

Bacterial strains and culture conditions

DNA extraction

The bifidobacterial strains used in this study were Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC15703, B. bifidum
DSM20456, B. breve DSM20091, B. longum ATCC15707.
The Lactobacillus strains were Lactobacillus plantarum
DSM21074, L. casei DSM20011, L. ramnosus DSM20021,
L. salivarius SV2 (strain from our collection), L. delbrueckii DSM 20314, L. gasseri DSM20243, L. reuteri
DSM20016, L. pentosus DSM20134, L. acidophilus
DSM20079. All bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus strains
were grown on De Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) broth
with cysteine (0.5 g/l) at 37°C under an anaerobic atmosphere (Anaerocult, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
Escherichia coli ATCC11105 was cultivated at 37°C aerobically on TY-broth. Salmonella cholerasuis typhimurium
and Yersinia enterocolitica-type, kindly provided by A.
Essig, Dept. of Medical Microbiology, University of Ulm,
Germany, were cultivated aerobically at 30°C on BHIbroth.

Total DNA was extracted from 109 bacterial cells by using
the DNeasy Tissue Kit 50 (Quiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany) following the manufacturer instructions. Bacterial
DNA was also extracted from lyophilized bacterial cells
of the following DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) collection strains: Clostridium leptum DSM73, Ruminococcus
albus DSM20455, Eubacterium siraeum DSM15700, C.
viride
DSM6836,
Megasphera
micrinuciformis
DSM17226, Bacillus clausii DSM2515, B. subtilis
DSM704, B. cereus DSM21, and Proteus mirabilis
DSM4479. Lyophilized bacterial cells were suspended in
1 ml of lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,
50 mM EDTA, 4% SDS) and DNA extraction was carried
out by employing the same procedure used for the extraction of genomic DNA from faecal samples, according to
the following procedure. Total DNA from faecal material
was extracted using QIAamp DNA Stool Min Kit (Qiagen) with a modified protocol. 250 mg of faeces were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Four 3 mm glass beads and
0.5 g of 0.1 mm zirconia beads were added, and the samples were treated in FastPrep (MP Biomedical, Irvine,
CA, USA) at 5.5 ms for 3 min. Samples were heated at
95°C for 15 minutes, then centrifuged for 5 min at full
speed to pellet stool particles. Supernatants were collected and 260 μl of 10 M ammonium acetate were added,
followed by incubation in ice for 5 min and centrifugation
at full speed for 10 min. One volume of isopropanol was
added to each supernatant and incubated in ice for 30
min. The precipitated nucleic acids were collected by
centrifugation for 15 min at full speed and washed with
70% ethanol. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of TE
buffer and treated with 2 μl of DNase-free RNase (10 mg/
ml) at 37°C for 15 min. Protein removal by Proteinase K
treatment and DNA purification with QIAamp Mini Spin
columns were performed following the kit protocol. 200
μl of TE buffer were used for DNA elution. Final DNA

Methods
Recruitment

Target selection and consensus extraction

A database of 16S rRNA sequences was created by integration of the 16S rRNA database of the ARB Project
(release February, 2005) (http://www.arb-home.de; [35])
with the database of the Ribosomal Database Project
(RDP; release September, 2007) (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/
; [36,37]). A phylogenetic tree was obtained in the ARB
software, by using the neighbour-joining algorithm for
the sequence alignment. The tree was used for the rational selection of phylogenetically related groups of bacteria belonging to the human intestinal microbiota which
correspond to nodes of the phylogenetic tree (Additional
file 1). Group specific consensus sequences were
extracted, with a cut-off of 75% for base calling. Nucleotides which occurred at lower frequencies were replaced
by the appropriate IUPAC ambiguity code.

concentration was determined by using NanoDrop ND1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The
bacterial DNA from the following 11 ATCC strains was
directly obtained from the ATCC: Bacteroides fragilis
ATCC25285, B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148, Prevotella
melaninogenica ATCC25845, Veilonella parvula
ATCC10790, C. difficile ATCCBAA1382, C. acetobutilicum ATCC824, C. perfringens ATCC13124, Enterococcus
faecalis ATCC700802, E. faecium ATCC51559, Campylobacter jejuni ATCC33292, R. productus 23340.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

All the oligonucleotide primers and probe pairs were synthesized by Thermo Electron (Ulm, Germany). PCR
amplifications were performed with Biometra Thermal
Cycler II and Biometra Thermal Cycler T Gradient
(Biometra, Germany). PCR products were purified by
using a Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up System purification kit (Promega Italia, Milan, Italy), according to the
manufacturer's instructions, eluted in 20 μl of sterile
water, and quantified with the DNA 7500 LabChip Assay
kit and BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA, USA). 16S rRNA was amplified using universal
forward primer 16S27F (5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3') and reverse primer r1492 (5'-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3'), following the protocol described in
Castiglioni et al. [25] except for using 50 ng of starting
DNA and 0.5 U of DNAzyme DNA polymerase II
(Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland).
LDR/Universal Array approach

Phenylen-diisothiocyanate (PDITC) activated chitosan
glass slides were used as surfaces for the preparation of
universal arrays [39], comprising a total of 49 Zip-codes.
Hybridization controls (cZip 66 oligonucleotide, complementary to zip 66, 5'-Cy3-GTTACCGCTGGTGCTGCCGCCGGTA-3') were used to locate the submatrixes
during the scanning. The entire experimental procedure
for both the chemical treatment and the spotting is
described in detail in Consolandi et al. [40]. An overview
of the Universal Array layout and ZipCodes is provided as
Additional file 6. Ligase Detection Reaction and hybridization of the products on the universal arrays were performed according to the protocol described in Castiglioni
et al. [25], except for the probe annealing temperature, set
at 60°C.
The LDRs were carried out in a final volume of 20 μl
with different quantities of purified PCR products: a) all
LDRs for specificity tests were performed on 50 fmol of
initial PCR product, for having no issues related to target;
b) sensitivity tests were performed with decreasing PCR
product concentration from 75 to 0.7 fmol; c) relative
abundance tests were performed on 1 fmol E. coli PCR
amplicon, mixed with human genomic DNA extracted

Page 14 of 16

from whole blood, at decreasing concentrations, from 4%,
down to 0.02%; d) LDR experiments on the eight faecal
samples were performed on 50 fmol of PCR product.
Data analysis

All arrays were scanned with ScanArray 5000 scanner
(Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA), at 10 μm
resolution. In the experiments, the fluorescent images
were obtained with different acquisition parameters on
both laser power and photo-multiplier gain, in order to
avoid saturation. IF were quantitated by ScanArray
Express 3.0 software, using the "Adaptive circle" option,
letting diameters vary from 60 to 300 μm. No normalization procedures on the IFs have been performed. To
assess whether a probe pair was significantly above the
background (i.e. was "present" or not), we performed a
one-sided t-test (α = 0.01). The criteria was relaxed to α =
0.05 for sensitivity tests. The null distribution was set as
the population of "Blank" spots (e.g. with no oligonucleotide spotted, n = 6). Two times the standard deviation of
pixel intensities of the same spots was added to obtain a
conservative estimate. For each zip-code, we considered
the population of the IFs of all the replicates (n = 4) and
tested it for being significantly above the null-distribution
(H0: μtest = μnull; H1: μtest>μnull). In case one replicate in the
test population was below 2.5 times the distribution
mean, this was considered an outlier and was discarded
from the analyses. We calculated the ratio between the
signal intensities of the specific probes on the blank
intensity (SNRs) and the ratio between all the other
probes and the blank intensity (SNRns).
Clustering

Hierarchical clustering of HTF-Microbi.Array profiles
was carried out using the statistical software R http://
www.r-project.org. The Euclidean distance among sample profiles was calculated and Ward's method was used
for agglomeration.

the Universal Array platform. Each array has 8 identical subarrays (A), which
can be addressed independently. Each subarray is made by 208 spots, with
quadruplicates of each ZipCode (B); hybridization and ligation controls and
Blanks are repeated 8, 6 and 6 times, respectively; the figure highlights in
gray the ZipCodes actually associated to probe pairs used in the HTFMicrobi.Array. Sequences (5' - 3' oriented) and numbers of the ZipCodes are
reported in (C).
