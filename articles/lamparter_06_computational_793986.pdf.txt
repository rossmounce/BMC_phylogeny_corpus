Abstract
Background: Phytochromes are photoreceptors, discovered in plants, that control a wide variety
of developmental processes. They have also been found in bacteria and fungi, but for many species
their biological role remains obscure. This work concentrates on the phytochrome system of
Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a non-photosynthetic soil bacterium with two phytochromes. To
identify proteins that might share common functions with phytochromes, a co-distribution analysis
was performed on the basis of protein sequences from 138 bacteria.
Results: A database of protein sequences from 138 bacteria was generated. Each sequence was
BLASTed against the entire database. The homolog distribution of each query protein was then
compared with the homolog distribution of every other protein (target protein) of the same
species, and the target proteins were sorted according to their probability of co-distribution under
random conditions. As query proteins, phytochromes from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Deinococcus radiodurans and Synechocystis PCC 6803 were chosen along with several
phytochrome-related proteins from A. tumefaciens. The Synechocystis photosynthesis protein D1
was selected as a control. In the D1 analyses, the ratio between photosynthesis-related proteins
and those not related to photosynthesis among the top 150 in the co-distribution tables was > 3:1,
showing that the method is appropriate for finding partner proteins with common functions. The
co-distribution of phytochromes with other histidine kinases was remarkably high, although most
co-distributed histidine kinases were not direct BLAST homologs of the query protein. This finding
implies that phytochromes and other histidine kinases share common functions as parts of signalling
networks. All phytochromes tested, with one exception, also revealed a remarkably high codistribution with glutamate synthase and methionine synthase. This result implies a general role of
bacterial phytochromes in ammonium assimilation and amino acid metabolism.
Conclusion: It was possible to identify several proteins that might share common functions with
bacterial phytochromes by the co-distribution approach. This computational approach might also
be helpful in other cases.

Background
Many photoreceptors such as rhodopsins, phytochromes,
cryptochromes and phototropins have been discovered in

eukaryotic organisms by a combination of biochemical
and physiological assays [1], whereas prokaryotic versions
of these proteins have often been identified during

genome projects. Phytochromes, which are photoreceptors with a bilin chromophore, control a broad range of
developmental processes in plants [2]. The discovery of
plant phytochrome in the late 1950s was the starting
point for biochemical, molecular and physiological characterisations. Since the late 1990s, phytochromes have
also been found in many bacteria and fungi [3-8], in most
cases after the phytochrome gene has been identified during genome sequencing [9]. Prototypical bacterial phytochromes are light-regulated histidine kinases, which transphosphorylate cognate response regulator proteins [4]. In
cyanobacteria, a number of light effects such as phototaxis
[10], control of the circadian clock [11], chromatic adaptation [12] and adaptation to blue light conditions [13],
are controlled by proteins that contain domains with
rather weak homology to the so-called GAF-domain of
phytochrome. The biological function of prototypical
phytochrome is known for only a few bacteria. The cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 is important for adaptation
to strong light conditions [14] and is involved in regulating several genes, including gifA, which encodes a regulator of glutamine synthase [15]. However, the signal
transduction link between Cph1 and the observed light
effects is still obscure and the biological role of the prototypical phytochromes in other cyanobacteria is unknown.
The most obvious effects controlled by bacterial phytochromes have been found for Bradyrhizobium spp., a photosynthetic plant symbiont, and the purple bacterium
Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In both species, the synthesis
of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid pigments is under
phytochrome control [16,17].

expressed in A. tumefaciens cells, as revealed by UV/vis
spectroscopy [29].
The computational approach presented here is aimed at
identifying proteins that might share common features
with bacterial phytochromes. The analysis is based on the
distribution of protein homologs among bacteria according to the following concept: if proteins share common
functions in one organism, they might have evolved
together, with similar mutation rates, and their homologs
should be abundant in similar subsets of species.

Results
The principle of the investigation is outlined in Figure 1.
In this example, six species were used for an imaginary
global homology analysis. Each species has between eight
and ten proteins, which are abbreviated by a letter for the
species and a digit. Protein A1 of species A is the query
protein of the imaginary co-distribution analysis. This
protein has homologs in four other species and one
homolog, A2, in species A itself. In Table 1, which gives
the result of the co-distribution analysis, the proteins of
species A are sorted according to the co-distribution probability p, which is calculated as described in the Methods
section. Proteins that have homologs in a similar subset as
the query protein A1 are listed at the top. Protein A6 has
the best co-distribution match, with a probability of co-

Many non-photosynthetic bacteria, including the gamma
ray resistant Deinococcus radiodurans, the soil bacterium
Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa also contain phytochromes [5,6,18]. For D.
radiodurans, it has been reported that the phytochrome
BphP controls the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis
[5], but as in Synechocystis, the signal transduction link
between input and output is unknown. The biological
role of phytochromes in other non-photosynthetic bacteria is unknown.
The present work concentrates on the phytochrome system of A. tumefaciens. This bacterium is known for its ability to induce plant tumours by gene transformation, a
mechanism that is widely used for plant transformation
[19]. The genome of this bacterium was sequenced by two
groups in 2001 [20,21], the sequencing data revealed two
phytochrome genes. Since their discovery, both A. tumefaciens phytochromes have been analysed biochemically
as recombinant proteins. These studies provided deeper
insight into general phytochrome functions and phytochrome diversity [6,22-28]. Both phytochromes are

direct homolog of A1; this is indicated by "1" in column
e. The header of Table 1 contains further comments.
The co-distribution analyses in this study are based on
protein sequences from 138 bacteria, listed in Additional
file 21. The tabulated results of two global BLAST [30]
searches with E-values of 0.000001 and 10 were stored in
files that were used to compare the homolog distribution
of protein couples. Two different BLAST analyses were
undertaken in order to determine the dependence of the
results on the E-value. The number of homologs usually
differs according to the chosen E-value and lies within a
reasonable range for the query proteins (see e.g. Table 2).
Each query protein was probed against all the other proteins of the same species to produce sorted co-distribution
tables, as outlined in the example of Figure 1 and Table 1
(see Additional files 1 to 20).
The photosynthetic protein D1 from the cyanobacterium
Synechocystis PCC 6803 was chosen as a control query protein to see whether the co-distribution approach identifies
related proteins (see Additional files 17 and 18). In addition, five phytochromes from four different species were
selected as query proteins: Agp1 (= BphP1) (see Additional files 1 and 2) and Agp2 (= BphP2) (see Additional
files 3 and 4) from A. tumefaciens, BphP from P. aeruginosa
(see Additional files 13 and 14), BphP from D. radiodurans

chocystis (see Additional files 15 and 16). The agp1 gene of
A. tumefaciens is arranged in a gene cluster as depicted in
Fig. 2. A response regulator protein termed AgR and a histidine kinase termed ExsG are encoded in the same
operon. It has been shown that AgR is phosphorylated by
Agp1 in a light-dependent manner [23]. ExsG is homologous to the histidine kinase module of Agp2. A response
regulator termed ExsF is encoded in the other DNA strand
next to the exsG gene. In prokaryotes, such an arrangement points to possible common functions among the
encoded proteins. Since the principal goal of this study
was to gain information about the phytochrome system of
A. tumefaciens, AgR (see Additional files 5 and 7), ExsF (see
Additional files 7 and 8) and ExsG (see Additional files 9
and 10) were also selected as query proteins. The response
regulator of Synechocystis phytochrome, Rcp1, which is
phosphorylated by Cph1 [4], was also included (see Additional files 19 and 20).
For each query protein, the results of both global BLAST
analyses were taken as sources for the co-distribution
analyses. Thus, 20 co-distribution lists were generated.
The target proteins in these lists were sorted as outlined in
Table 1. All co-distribution lists are presented as additional files on the BMC web server.
The BLAST analysis with an E-value of 0.000001 revealed
D1 homologs in 6 species. These species are identical to
the 6 cyanobacteria that were selected for global analysis.

Figure 2
A. tumefaciens gene arrangement around agp1
A. tumefaciens gene arrangement around agp1. Gene names are listed below and names of the encoded proteins listed
above the diagram. The apg1, agR and exsG open reading frames belong to the same operon, the exsF open reading frame
points to the opposite direction.

In Synechocystis, there are 142 proteins with exactly the
same distribution. Among these are 37 other proteins
with photosynthesis-related functions, such as phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, ferredoxin and photosystem subunit proteins. A green background marks the
corresponding field in the co-distribution table (see Additional file 17). Twenty-four of the 142 proteins have been
annotated as "hypothetical" and 70 as "unknown protein". Eleven proteins that are clearly not related to photosynthesis, such as ribosomal proteins or tRNA synthetase,
also have the same distribution as D1. A yellow background marks these fields in the co-distribution table.
When the D1 co-distribution analysis was based on a
BLAST E-value of 10 (see Additional file 18), D1
homologs were found in 16 species. Among these are the
six cyanobacteria and one other photosynthetic bacterium, R. palustris. The other 9 species are non-photosynthetic. Owing to the higher number of species with D1
homologs, the co-distribution results are more differentiated. For comparison with the previous survey, the top
149 proteins were inspected in more detail. Since the proteins placed between positions 141 and 149 have the
same distribution, it was not possible to use exactly the
same number of proteins as in the previous case. Among
the top 149 proteins there are 42 photosynthesis-related
proteins, 10 proteins with functions not related to photosynthesis, 17 "hypothetical proteins", 77 "unknown proteins", and 3 proteins for which the function could not
clearly be assigned to photosynthesis. The number of
photosynthesis-related proteins is comparable with the
first analysis, but the selection is slightly different. For
example, a ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase subunit
and a carbon dioxide concentrating protein subunit are
among the top 149 in the second analysis, whereas the
same proteins are placed at positions 184 and 378, respectively, in the first analysis.

The D1 analysis showed that proteins with related functions can be identified by the present approach, since
among the top ca. 150 proteins there are three to four
times more photosynthesis-related proteins than proteins
with other known functions. It seems likely that among
the hypothetical and unknown proteins listed at the top
of the co-distribution tables, there are many other proteins with functions related to photosynthesis.
In cases where the phytochromes or phytochrome-related
proteins mentioned above were chosen as query (see
Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4 and 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), the
proteins placed within the top 100 in each co-distribution
list were compared with all proteins from the same species. Text-based searches were performed to count the
number of proteins belonging to particular groups of proteins such as histidine kinases, response regulators and
transcription factors. These results are summarized in
Table 2. It is remarkable that in all cases the frequency of
histidine kinases (or "two-component sensors") among
the top 100 co-distributed proteins is much higher than
among all proteins of the species. For example, Agp1 has
18% to 20% co-distributed "two-component sensors" (=
histidine kinases) among the top 100, whereas only
1.08% of all A. tumefaciens proteins belong to this group.
Since bacterial phytochromes are also histidine kinases,
the co-distribution with other histidine kinases might
simply be based on direct homology, as between A1 and
A2 in the example of Fig. 1. However, most co-distributed
histidine kinases are not direct BLAST homologs, as indicated in column "e" of the co-distribution tables. The
results for the co-distribution of (two-component-)
response regulators, which are substrates of histidine
kinases, are qualitatively comparable with those for the
histidine kinases. There are, however, two exceptions: in
the Agp2 and Rcp1 analyses, which were based on the low
E-value BLAST search, the frequency of response regula-

tors among the top 100 in the lists was comparable with
that in the entire protein population.
In the case of the A. tumefaciens query proteins, the possibility was tested that proteins designated "transcriptional
regulators" are enriched within the top 100 in the lists. For
all five query proteins (see Additional files 1 to 10), the
frequency of co-distributed transcriptional regulators
increases when the BLAST analysis E-value is changed
from low to high. The latter but not the former values are
above average.
The five A. tumefaciens query proteins were also tested for
co-distribution among each other. Table 3 gives the positions in the co-distribution tables for each possible combination. This table shows that AgR and Agp1 match quite
well: in three out of four combinations, the target protein
was among the first 100 in the co-distribution list. Similarly, there is also a rather good match between Cph1 and
Rcp1 of Synechocystis (Table 4). The putative response regulator of D. radiodurans BphP (gi number: 15807719)
appears at positions 5 and 433 in the BphP co-distribution tables. For the combinations ExsG/Agp2, ExsF/Agp2
and ExsF/ExsG, the target protein is placed among the first
100 in the co-distribution lists, indicating a rather high codistribution. Agp2 and ExsG are direct BLAST homologs,
as indicated in column "e" of the result tables. The similarity between these two proteins has been noted previously [23]. As mentioned above, the exsF and exsG genes
are located close together (Fig. 2). This arrangement suggests that ExsF is a substrate of ExsG, which in turn could
explain the good match between these proteins.
Besides phytochromes, A. tumefaciens contains another
putative photoreceptor, a flavoprotein that belongs of the
cryptochrome/photolyase group. Cryptochromes and
photolyases are homologous proteins that serve as photoreceptors and catalyze light-dependent DNA repair
mechanisms, respectively. In A. tumefaciens, the protein
annotated as DNA photolyase (gi: 17935123) has also
been classified as cryptochrome [31], but functional
details are as yet unclear. In plants, the signal transduction
pathways of cryptochromes and phytochromes are inter-

twined [32]. For the plant Arabidopsis thaliana it has been
reported that a cryptochrome interacts directly with a phytochrome [33]. For these reasons, the co-distribution of
phytochromes and cryptochromes/photolyases was of
particular interest. In A. tumefaciens, there is a good match
between Agp1 as query and the DNA photolyase (cryptochrome) as target; the latter is placed at positions 156 and
17 in the co-distribution tables (see Additional files 1 and
2). There is no significant co-distribution between Agp2
and cryptochrome/photolyase (see Additional files 3 and
4). In Synechocystis and P. aeruginosa, the co-distribution
between phytochromes and cryptochromes/photolyases
is rather poor (see Additional files 13, 14, 15 and 16), and
in D. radiodurans, cryptochromes/photolyases seem to be
absent (see Additional files 11 and 12).
The Agp1 lists were inspected for further candidates that
might share common functions with this phytochrome.
One striking observation was that either two or three
glutamate synthase large subunits are among the first 10
proteins in the co-distribution tables (see Additional files
1 and 2). There are three large and one small subunits of
this enzyme in A. tumefaciens. With Agp2 as query, none
of the glutamate synthase subunits appeared among the
first proteins in the co-distribution table (see Additional
file 2). However, in the case of D. radiodurans, Synechocystis and P. aeruginosa phytochromes, cross-correlation with glutamate synthase subunits is also obvious (see
Additional files 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16). In both Synechocystis Cph1 tables, two ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthases are found among the top 60; in the D.
radiodurans tables, the large subunit of glutamate synthase
is placed among the top 50; and in the P. aeruginosa tables,
the large subunit is found at positions 74 and 123.
Another enzyme of amino acid metabolism, methionine
synthase, is also located at the top of the Agp1 lists,
namely at positions 3 and 87 (see Additional files 1 and
2). Again, there is no significant co-distribution between
Agp2 and this protein (see Additional files 3 and 4), but
with the other phytochromes (see Additional files 11 to
16) the co-distribution is in the range of glutamate synthase (Table 5).

Discussion
For a given target protein, the co-distribution table shows
which proteins have similar or equal BLAST-homolog distributions among a set of species. These tables can be used
to test for the co-distribution of protein couples with
known functions or to find protein partners with a yet
unknown mutuality, given that the relationship has led to
co-evolution of these proteins. When the photosynthetic
protein D1 was chosen as query protein, many other
photosynthesis-related proteins appeared among the first
ca. 150 proteins of the co-distribution tables. The ratio
between these proteins and those that are not related to
photosynthesis is > 3:1. This result implies that the
chances of finding protein couples with related functions
by the method presented here are rather high.
Two classes of proteins are known to act together with
bacterial phytochromes: response regulators, which are
trans-phosphorylated by the phytochrome histidine
kinase subunit, and heme oxygenases, the enzymes that
catalyse the last or the second last step in phytochrome
chromophore biosynthesis. Depending on the species,
genes for either protein may be found next to the phytochrome genes [34]. Heme oxygenases appear in rather low
positions in all the phytochrome co-distribution tables. A
co-evolutionary relationship between these proteins is
thus not supported by the present study. Phylogenetic
analyses imply that cyanobacterial heme oxygenases are
of different origin from proteobacterial homologs,
whereas bacterial phytochromes seem to share one common origin [35,36]. This might explain the rather large
distance between the two proteins in the co-distribution
analysis. The co-distribution between Agp1 (Table 3)/
Cph1 (Table 4) and their cognate response regulators is in

220/59

general rather good. In the phytochrome co-distribution
tables, other response regulators are found higher in the
list. An unambiguous identification of the cognate
response regulator by the present approach is thus not
expected. However, this approach could reduce the
number of proteins to be analysed for those species where
the response regulator is yet to be identified. In P. aeruginosa, the cognate phytochrome response regulator cannot
be deduced from the gene arrangement. According to the
list of P. aeruginosa proteins, there are 56 response regulators in this species; an initial biochemical screen could
focus on those placed at the tops of the co-distribution
lists.
The rather high frequency of histidine kinases and
response regulators among those proteins listed at the
tops of the phytochrome co-distribution tables suggests
that bacterial phytochromes and other histidine kinases
act together in a complex intracellular network. The common model of two-component signalling predicts that
histidine kinases act as homodimers and that they specifically transfer phosphate to one cognate response regulator [37]. However, more complex interactions might exist
in the natural host. (i) Two different histidine kinase
monomers could form heterodimers. For the plant A. thaliana it has been shown that four of the five phytochromes
can form heterodimers, most likely by their histidinekinase-like subunits [38]. (ii) Different response regulators might function as substrates of the histidine kinase.
(iii) The downstream signalling pathways of different
input histidine kinases could merge. For signal transduction in which bacterial phytochromes are involved, none
of these possibilities has yet been tested.

In addition to proteins with regulatory functions, the
enzyme glutamate synthase is of particular interest. In A.
tumefaciens, there are three large and one small glutamate
synthase subunits. Depending on the E-value of the global
BLAST analysis, either two or three of these proteins were
among the top 10 in the co-distribution tables. With the
exception of Agp2, all other phytochromes in the present
study have co-distributed glutamate synthases. At least
one glutamate synthase (subunit) is placed among the top
100 in the co-distribution lists. In the cyanobacterium
Synechocystis, the ferredoxin-dependent enzyme matches
better with the phytochrome Cph1 query protein than the
NADH-dependent enzyme. In plants, where phytochrome action has been analysed over decades, there are
also ferredoxin-dependent and NADH-dependent glutamate synthases. The ferredoxin-dependent enzyme is
located in the plastid, where it acts together with
glutamine synthase to incorporate ammonium (NH4+)
into glutamine and glutamate. Ammonium is formed
from nitrite (NO2-) by nitrite reductase, which like glutamate synthase is directly coupled to the photosynthetic
electron cascade in the chloroplast via ferredoxin. The
expression of all three enzymes and the cytosolic nitrate
reductase, which catalyses the conversion of nitrate into
nitrite, is light-regulated by phytochrome [39-43].

for the synthesis of δ aminolevulinic acid, which is the key
molecule in porphyrin synthesis. In α proteobacteria
(including A. tumefaciens), yeast and mammals, δ aminolevulinic acid is formed from glycine and succinate
[45]. In this case, their porphyrins obtain only the amino
group of glutamate, which is transferred to serine, the substrate of glycine synthesis [46]. Owing to their extended πelectron systems, porphyrins absorb visible light, predominantly in the longer wavelength regions. The biological
functions of many porphyrins, for example chlorophylls
in photosynthetic organisms, are directly related to light
absorption; other porphyrins such as heme are involved
in electron transport or redox reactions. Light absorbed by
free porphyrins, leading to photosensitization, can have
damaging effects by generating reactive oxygen species.
Thus, the synthesis of porphyrins by light-exposed cells
must be tightly regulated. Not only photosynthetic organisms but also other organisms that are exposed to sunlight
might benefit from light regulation of porphyrin synthesis. The histidine kinase activity of bacterial phytochromes
depends on light and the presence of the bilin chromophore. Therefore, phytochromes may also be regarded as
sensors for the end product of porphyrin biosynthesis. It
therefore seems plausible that phytochromes might have
evolved as regulators of porphyrin synthesis.

In cyanobacteria, enzymes of ammonium assimilation
seem to be regulated by ammonium, but not by light [44].
Light control of gene transcription was analysed by RNA
profiling in wild type and Cph1 and Cph2 mutants of Synechocystis [15]. In these studies, no influence of Cph1 on
the abundance of glutamate synthase mRNA was found
(T. Börner and T. Hübschmann, personal communication). However, the expression of GifA, a regulatory protein of glutamine synthase, which acts in cooperation
with glutamate synthase in the "GOGAT cycle", seems be
under the control of Cph1 and Cph2, as deduced from
expression profiling results on the double mutant [15]. It
could therefore be that the GOGAT cycle is indirectly
under the control of phytochromes in Synechocystis.

A possible connection between phytochrome and methionine synthase is less evident. A literature survey gave no
indication of phytochrome-mediated regulation of
methionine synthase expression. If glutamate synthase
catalyses an early step in the amino acid metabolism network, methionine synthase catalyses a late step [46,47].
Methionine, like glutamate, serves as substrate for other
enzymatic reactions besides protein synthesis: the activated form, S-adenosylmethionine, is used for methylation reactions including DNA [48] and protein
methylation, and for the synthesis of the gaseous hormone ethylene in land plants [49]. Methionine synthase
is also important for regenerating methionine from S-adenosyl-homocysteine, the breakdown product of the methylation reaction. It could be that DNA methylation
protects DNA from UV damage [50] and that the turnover
of methionine is therefore higher in the light than in the
dark. In this way, phytochrome could have come into
play.

The present data imply that bacterial phytochromes might
contribute to the regulation of glutamate synthase in
other prokaryotic species as well. The fact that phytochrome homologs and glutamate synthase homologs are
found in similar sub-sets of species points to a common
and ancient link between these two groups of proteins.
How can these proteins be connected? Glutamate is a key
molecule of nitrogen metabolism. Glutamate and
glutamine are the first amino acids in which ammonium
is fixed into organic matter. Glutamate serves as nitrogen
source and in most species also as a carbon source for porphyrins. In the "tRNA pathway", realized in the majority
of bacteria and plants, glutamate-tRNA is used as substrate

Although such scenarios on co-evolution are speculative,
the present co-distribution data might help to gain a better understanding of phytochrome function in bacteria.
The co-distribution lists contain other proteins besides
those discussed in this article that might share common
functions with phytochromes. In combination with
genome, proteome and mutant studies, the method presented here can give clues to the evolution of signal transduction, metabolism and other cellular functions. In the

present approach, only one digit was used to express protein homology (homologous or not homologous). This
decision was based on the E-values of the BLAST analyses.
Co-distribution analyses based on graded information
about protein homology might give even more precise
results. In addition, information about the length and
position of homologous sequences could be included.
BLAST is a heuristic algorithm, designed for fast database
searches. If the number of protein sequences is not too
great, accurate methods for sequence comparison can also
be chosen [51]. The time required for the global BLAST
analyses was approximately 2 weeks on a standard desktop computer with 2 GByte RAM. With faster machines, is
seems realistic to test each possible combination of two
protein sequences in a database containing 400000
sequences by non-heuristic alignment algorithms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/141

teins, and for each query protein a list of hits with the gi
number, TaxID and bitscore value of each hit. The bitscore
information was not used during subsequent analyses but
might help for later refinements.
For co-distribution analyses, the name and gi number of
the query protein (most often a phytochrome) and its hitlist were stored in a separate file, which was used as input
for comparison with all other proteins of the same species.
For these comparisons, a PERL script was written. This
script lists the gi numbers of the target proteins, the
number of species in which homologs were found and the
number of hit species that were identical with the query
protein. Column "e" of the list indicates whether the target protein is a "direct homolog" of the query protein.
Another PERL script was used that adds the annotated
protein name of each protein according to its gi number.

Conclusion
The co-distribution analysis has allowed a deeper insight
to be gained into possible evolutionary relationships.
Controls with D1 as query protein show that the method
identifies other proteins with related functions. The
present studies have allowed the possible relationships
between bacterial phytochromes and other specific proteins, such as response regulators and histidine kinases, to
be tested. With glutamate synthase, a protein was identified that might be evolutionarily linked to Agrobacterium
phytochrome Agp1 and phytochromes of other species.
The method presented thus helps to guide the design of
molecular studies.

Methods
Annotated 389373 protein sequences from 138 bacteria
with sequenced genomes were downloaded from the
FASTA databases given under the NCBI web site [52]. A
list of all species and their NCBI tax-id is given in Additional file 21. The header of each protein sequence has
several fields in which the gi number, the protein function
and the species name are given. Using the Linux "sed" program, these headers were modified so that the species
TaxID [53] was included in each header. These modified
FASTA files were concatenated and converted in one
BLAST database using the formatdb program (see [54] for
documentation of BLAST). Then two global BLAST analyses were performed on the local computer; the protein
sequences from each modified FASTA file were used as
inputs. In the first global BLAST analysis, the E-value was
set to 0.000001; in the second analysis the default E-value
10 was used. The tabulated output data of the global analyses (using the BLAST-m 8 parameter) were stored in files
that were named according to the input files. In this way,
the results of the global BLAST analyses could be used for
species-wide comparisons. In the next step, superfluous
information was deleted using a PERL script. The stripped
files contain the gi number and TaxID of the query pro-

where k is the number of species in which homologs of
the query protein were found, l is the number of species
with homologs of the target protein, m is the number of
hit species with homologs to either protein, and n is the
total number of species (= 138). If a random sample from
a population of n members is taken l times without
replacement, the probability that m samples belong to a
sub-set that has k members is p.
Finally, the results were sorted according to this probability. The parameter abbreviations k, l, m, n and p are also
used in the co-distribution tables, which are given as additional information. Since the query protein is also
addressed as target protein and has the lowest p value, it
always appears at the top of the list – unless there are other
proteins that are found in exactly the same species; in this
case the query protein is placed manually at the top of the
list.
