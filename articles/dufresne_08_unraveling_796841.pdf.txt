<p>Local niche occupancy of marine
Synechococcus genome comparison <it>Synechococcus</it> lineages is facilitated by lateral gene transfers. Genomic islands act as repositories for these transferred genes.</p>

Abstract
Background: The picocyanobacterial genus Synechococcus occurs over wide oceanic expanses, having colonized most
available niches in the photic zone. Large scale distribution patterns of the different Synechococcus clades (based on 16S
rRNA gene markers) suggest the occurrence of two major lifestyles ('opportunists'/'specialists'), corresponding to two
distinct broad habitats ('coastal'/'open ocean'). Yet, the genetic basis of niche partitioning is still poorly understood in this
ecologically important group.
Results: Here, we compare the genomes of 11 marine Synechococcus isolates, representing 10 distinct lineages.
Phylogenies inferred from the core genome allowed us to refine the taxonomic relationships between clades by revealing
a clear dichotomy within the main subcluster, reminiscent of the two aforementioned lifestyles. Genome size is strongly
correlated with the cumulative lengths of hypervariable regions (or 'islands'). One of these, encompassing most genes
encoding the light-harvesting phycobilisome rod complexes, is involved in adaptation to changes in light quality and has
clearly been transferred between members of different Synechococcus lineages. Furthermore, we observed that two
strains (RS9917 and WH5701) that have similar pigmentation and physiology have an unusually high number of genes in
common, given their phylogenetic distance.
Conclusion: We propose that while members of a given marine Synechococcus lineage may have the same broad
geographical distribution, local niche occupancy is facilitated by lateral gene transfers, a process in which genomic islands
play a key role as a repository for transferred genes. Our work also highlights the need for developing picocyanobacterial
systematics based on genome-derived parameters combined with ecological and physiological data.

Background

Unicellular picocyanobacteria of the genera Synechococcus
and Prochlorococcus contribute significantly to global oceanic chlorophyll biomass and primary production and play an
important role in biogeochemical cycles [1-3]. Despite their
close phylogenetic relatedness, these two groups differ markedly in their light-harvesting apparatus and nutrient physiology and, thus, ecological performance [4]. Synechococcus is
ubiquitous, since cells of this genus are found in estuarine,
coastal or offshore waters over a large range of latitudes [5,6],
whereas Prochlorococcus is confined to warm (45°N-40°S)
and mostly nutrient-poor oceanic areas [7-9]. Genetically distinct clades displaying different vertical depth distributions
occur in the latter genus, explaining its wider vertical distribution in oceanic waters relative to Synechococcus [10].
These high light- (HL) and low light- (LL) adapted clades
have been further subdivided into at least six ecotypes exhibiting distinct light and/or temperature optima as well as distributions in the field [11]. In Synechococcus, at least 10 [12],
and as many as 16 [13-15], clades have been defined based on
different phylogenetic markers and physiological characteristics [16]. For several of these clades, distinct broad spatial and
seasonal distribution patterns have been described, mainly
over horizontal scales [17-19]. Some clades are confined to
high latitude, temperate waters (for example, clades I and
IV), while others preferentially thrive at lower latitudes in
warm, permanently stratified oceanic waters (for example,
clades II and III [19-21]).
Examination of the relationships between ecology, gene content and genome structure in the Prochlorococcus genus has
revealed evidence for drastic genome reduction in several
Prochlorococcus clades [22,23], a process clearly started
prior to the differentiation of HL and LL clades [24]. This
sequential loss of genes, including some involved in nutrient
uptake or photosynthesis, appears to have affected HL and LL
clades differently, since HL isolates share 95 clade-specific
genes and LL isolates 48 [23]. Pair-wise comparison of two
closely related Prochlorococcus isolates (MED4 and
MIT9312) revealed that gene losses are partially compensated
by gains from lateral gene transfer (LGT) events [25]. Many of
these horizontally acquired genes were found to be located in
highly variable genomic regions or 'islands'. More generally,
it seems that much of the genomic diversity between Prochlorococcus isolates occurs in 'the leaves of the tree', that is,
between the most closely related strains, and that gene
islands are important in maintaining this diversity as reservoirs for laterally transferred genes [23].
Less is known about the extent and causes of genome diversity in marine Synechococcus. Strain WH8102 was also
shown to possess genomic regions comparable to 'pathogenicity islands' and containing many glycosyltransferases
[26]. A pair-wise comparison between this oligotrophic strain
and a coastal isolate (CC9311) showed that LGT may have an
important role in niche differentiation in this group, for

example, by allowing acquisition of novel metal utilization
capacity [27].
With the aim of further understanding the evolutionary processes driving genome divergence and niche adaptation in
marine Synechococcus, we obtained sequences of nine additional genomes. By comparing them alongside three representative Prochlorococcus genomes, we calculated the
relative sizes of the core and accessory genomes, estimated
the importance and relative contribution of vertical inheritance and LGT for the core and accessory gene complements
and examined the distributions of accessory genes with
regard to genomic islands. In so doing, we identified a major
influence of these islands in genome flexibility and found evidence that at least one of them plays a major role in colonization of new light niches. Moreover, by exploring the
picocyanobacterial species concept, through study of the relationships between ribotype and genome diversity, we significantly advance our understanding of the phylogeny and
evolution of this major group of marine photosynthetic
prokaryotes.

Results and discussion
General features of the Synechococcus genomes
The 11 Synechococcus strains analyzed here include isolates
from the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Pacific and
Atlantic Oceans (Table 1). This set of strains covers nine of the
ten clades defined by Fuller and co-workers [12] in marine
sub-cluster 5.1, and also includes one sub-cluster 5.2 representative, the euryhaline, phycocyanin-rich strain WH5701.
Though some of these genomes are incomplete, the estimated
genome coverage is above 99.8% and, therefore, only a few
genes are potentially missing, making global genome comparisons legitimate. Genomes range in size from 2.22 to
approximately 2.86 Mbp and GC contents vary from 52.5% to
66.0%. This relatively small range of variation in genome
characteristics is strikingly different from that observed in the
Prochlorococcus genus, in which genome size varies between
1.64 and 2.68 Mbp, whilst GC content varies between 30.8%
and 50.7% [23]. This observation suggests that, in sharp
contrast to what has occurred in Prochlorococcus [22,24], no
extensive genome streamlining, concomitant with a drop in
GC content, has occurred during the evolution of Synechococcus.

Core genome
As a framework for comparative analyses and annotation, we
constructed clusters of protein-coding genes for the 14
genomes analyzed in this study. From a set of 35,946 proteincoding genes, 7,826 distinct groups of homologous proteins
were identified. The estimated core genome of marine Synechococcus is composed of 1,572 gene families (Figure 1a)
which represent from as low as 52% of the total genome of
WH5701 to as high as 67% in CC9902 (Figure 1b). Most families (93.4%) of the core genome contain only one gene from

each strain, indicating a low level of paralogy. When adding
three Prochlorococcus strains in the comparative analysis,
the core genome is reduced to 1,228 gene families (Figure 1a).
This number can be compared with the cyanobacterial core
genome (that is, including both freshwater and marine cyanobacteria), which comprises 892 families of orthologs [28]. As
expected, the streamlined P. marinus MED4 and SS120
genomes have the highest percentage of core genes (Figure
1b).
Only 70 gene families of the marine Synechococcus core
genome are not present in any of the three Prochlorococcus
genomes, including 23 linked to photosynthesis (Additional
data file 1). Among these, there are nine gene families encoding allophycocyanin and phycocyanin components, which are
shared with freshwater cyanobacteria [29]. Indeed, Prochlorococcus have lost all phycobilisome genes except those
encoding phycoerythrin, with LL ecotypes having kept many
of the latter genes and HL ecotypes only a few [30,31]. The
RubisCo gene region includes three genes involved in low
affinity carbon transport (ndhD4, ndhF4 and chpX

homologs) that are missing in Prochlorococcus, confirming
earlier results on a limited set of picocyanobacterial genomes
[32]. Also notable in this Synechococcus-specific set are ftrC
and ftrV, two genes encoding subunits of ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme involved in a redox system
between thioredoxin and ferredoxin [33]. All Synechococcus
also have one gene coding for a thioredoxin and another for a
[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin that have no orthologs in Prochlorococcus and it is tempting to speculate that their products might
specifically be involved in the interaction with ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase. This system could ensure the
regulation by light of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation
enzymes, a capacity that could have been lost (or evolved into
a less iron-dependent form) in Prochlorococcus.

Accessory genome and gene islands
The accessory genome of marine Synechococcus comprises a
fairly constant number (748 ± 85) of genes shared by 2-10
genomes (Additional data file 2). Among the most notable
genes are isiA and isiB (encoding the photosystem I-associated antenna protein CP43' and the soluble electron transport

protein flavodoxin, respectively), which are systematically
found associated in an iron-stress inducible operon in freshwater cyanobacteria but which in marine Synechococcus are
found separated and present in only four strains (BL107,
CC9311, CC9605 and CC9902). The absence of these genes in
the oligotrophic strain WH8102 is particularly surprising,
given their potential importance in the adaptation to low iron
environments [34,35]. Interestingly, the four aforementioned
Synechococcus strains also have a specific ferredoxin gene
(among four to five gene copies in total) and it is possible,

therefore, that this form is functionally interchangeable with
flavodoxin, when cells are shifted from an iron-replete to an
iron-limited environment [36].
The number of unique genes - that is, genes specific to one
genome - is much more variable (91-845; Figure 1a). The latter number is strongly correlated with genome size (Figure
1c), except for the streamlined genomes of P. marinus MED4
and SS120 and the two most distantly related Synechococcus
genomes, RCC307 and WH5701 (see phylogenetic analyses

below), which all have an apparent excess of unique genes relative to their size. A large proportion (51-80%) of these
unique genes are localized in 'islands' (Figure 1d), as predicted chiefly via deviation in tetranucleotide frequency.
These islands (illustrated in Figures 2a and 3 and Additional
data files 3 and 4) represent a very variable part of the total
genome sequence (10.6-31.2%; Figure 1e). In addition, the
average size of intergenic regions is higher here than in the
rest of the genome (for example, >105 bp within islands and
approximately 50 bp outside islands in WH7803). This,
added to the high variability of island size, results in a strong

correlation between the cumulative length of islands and the
size of Synechococcus genomes (r2 = 0.90; Figure 1f).
Island size and position are very variable among genomes
(Additional data file 3), except for the closely related strains
BL107 and CC9902 (Figure 2a), which show a high degree of
co-linearity (Figure 2b). Even so, related islands can be identified in different genomes by the fact they are surrounded by
homologous genes or gene regions (an example of such
related islands is provided in Additional data file 4). Some
islands are present in a large subset of strains and are likely

ancient while others are present in only one or very few
genomes, suggesting that they have been more recently
acquired. We cannot exclude, however, that some of the
islands present in few genomes could have been present in
ancestral Synechococcus genomes but lost during subsequent
speciation associated with colonization of new niches.

Gene composition of islands is also highly variable among
Synechococcus genomes. A high percentage (37-79%) of
island genes are shared by several genomes (though this is
most often a small subset of the 11 genomes), suggesting that
many genes acquired by LGT are maintained over time periods long enough to be disseminated within the host clade and

eventually to more recently diverged Synechococcus lineages.
The high variability of gene composition in these genomic
regions is further demonstrated by comparing Synechococcus
genomes with the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition
database [37]. Environmental sequences from oceanic areas
showed highest similarity to the WH8102 and CC9605
genomes whereas sequences from a hypersaline lagoon were
most similar to RS9917. For all three genomes, there was generally a low recruitment of environmental sequences to island
regions (Figure 3), giving us strong confidence in the reliability of our island predictions. This low recruitment raises
questions about the origin of genes present in islands. Indeed,
it may suggest that these genes are rare in the environment
(that is, not belonging to any abundant groups of organisms)
and, hence, that such islands are hypervariable. However, it is
also possible that the source organisms may have been missed
by the sampling strategy used to acquire the GOS data, either
because they were too large (for example, bacteria retained on
the 0.8 μm pre-filter) or too small (for example, phages passing through the 0.2 μm collecting filter). More metagenomic
data, acquired using different sampling strategies, are clearly
needed to resolve this important issue.
Altogether, our data suggest that, like for Prochlorococcus
[23], genomic islands have a key role in the variability of Synechococcus genome sizes (and, therefore, their diversity), acting as a repository for novel genes. Those genes providing a
sufficient selective advantage can be kept long term while others are more or less rapidly eliminated, depending on their
effect on cell fitness. However, the underlying mechanism
leading to preferential insertion of laterally transferred genes
into these regions still needs to be elucidated.

Function of island genes
Most island genes (60-78%) cannot be assigned to functional
categories based on homology. Among island genes with
known function (Additional data file 5), the predominant category comprises members of the glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolase gene families, potentially involved in outer
membrane or cell wall biogenesis. As suggested previously
[26,27], they may have a key role in grazer and phage avoidance. Other major categories include genes encoding enzymes
involved in carbohydrate modification, ABC transport, mobility of DNA (for example, phage integrases and transposases)
or transcriptional regulators (Additional data file 5). Also,
putative genes of unusually large size (ranging from 5,01684,534 bp), so-called 'giant open reading frames'; highlighted
in blue in Figure 3 and Additional data files 3 and 5), frequently exhibit a significant deviation in tetranucleotide frequency and, according to recruitment plots against GOS data,
appear to be very unevenly represented in the Synechococcus
genomes (Figure 3). Only one of these giant proteins has been
characterized so far in marine Synechococcus, the SwmB protein, which in WH8102 is required for a unique form of swimming motility [38].

Volume 9, Issue 5, Article R90

Dufresne et al. R90.7

In a recent study, we described a region that gathers most
genes encoding phycobilisome rod components (Figure 4 in
[29]). Here, we show that in all Synechococcus genomes
except the phycoerythrin II-lacking strains WH5701, RS9917
and WH7805, this region, ranging from 9-28.5 kb, depending
on strain, displays a significant deviation in tetranucleotide
frequency (region highlighted in orange in Figures 2 and 3
and Additional data file 5) and, therefore, it has the properties
of an island. This finding is consistent with the fact that phylogenetic trees inferred from genes contained in this region
(encoding phycocyanin or phycoerythrin proteins) are incongruent with trees made with concatenated alignments of
ribosomal proteins [29] or core proteins (Figure 4a). Thus, we
hypothesize that this region, which is crucial in defining light
absorption capacity and, therefore, the optimal light niche of
Synechococcus genotypes, has been laterally transferred
between Synechococcus lineages after the major diversification event that has occurred in this group (see below). In this
context, it has been suggested that cyanomyoviruses infecting
marine Synechococcus strains (like S-PM2) may encapsidate
randomly selected host DNA fragments having a similar size
to the phage genome, that is, 194 kb, and transduce them to
another Synechococcus strain [39].

Phylogenomics of marine picocyanobacteria
The availability of numerous complete genomes of marine
picocyanobacteria allowed us to refine the phylogenetic relationships between members of this group. An unrooted distance tree using 1,129 concatenated alignments of core
proteins is shown in Figure 4a. The same topology is found for
parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML) trees as well as for
the consensus tree obtained from individual ML trees of core
proteins (not shown). This tree shares many characteristics
with the 16S rRNA gene tree (Figure 4b), but allows a better
resolution of some internal branches. In particular, one can
clearly distinguish two main sub-groups within sub-cluster
5.1, one including WH8102, CC9605, CC9902 and BL107
(sub-group A) and the second one including WH7803,
WH7805, CC9311, RS9916 and RS9917 (sub-group B),
whereas the positions of the latter two strains are uncertain in
the 16S rRNA tree. Another important observation emerging
from the core protein tree is that RCC307 appears to be
located outside sub-cluster 5.1 (with a high bootstrap support), whereas its position is again not well supported in the
16S rRNA gene phylogeny (Figure 4b). Instead, this strain is
likely part of a new sub-cluster, which could be called subcluster 5.3 (sensu [40]), although more genomes from the
former clade X [12] are needed to fully support this assignment. The core protein neighbor joining (NJ) tree rooted with
the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
(Additional data file 6) suggests that the ancestor of sub-cluster 5.3 diverged before the split between sub-cluster 5.2 and
the group gathering sub-cluster 5.1 and all Prochlorococcus.
Members of sub-cluster 5.1 appear to have quickly differentiated into a number of different clades, as indicated by the
short branch lengths at the base of this sub-cluster, and this

Phylogenetic relationships of marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus

event has seemingly occurred almost concomitantly with the
appearance of the Prochlorococcus lineage. This confirms the
hypothesis of a rapid diversification of marine picocyanobacteria suggested by Urbach and colleagues [41], based on low
bootstrap confidence in the branching of these lineages in 16S
rRNA gene trees. This diversification is likely related to the
colonization of new marine environments and may partially
explain the dominance of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus sub-cluster 5.1 over the apparently less diversified subclusters 5.2 and 5.3. The differentiation of CC9902 and BL107
(two members of clade IV) on the one hand, and of WH7803
and WH7805 on the other hand, appears to be much more
recent.
Although Figure 4a represents well the evolutionary history
of the majority of the core genome (that is, the organism phylogeny), some core genes do not follow this phylogeny, suggesting that they could have been subject to LGT. Using a
phylogenetic approach based on the analysis of bipartition
spectra [42,43], we identified 122 protein families, including
11 involved in photosynthesis (such as the photosystem I
minor subunits PsaL and PsaI, the large subunit of the
RubisCo RbcL, several proteins of the Calvin cycle, and so
on), that strongly conflict (with bootstrap values higher than
99%) with the bipartitions of the consensus tree (Figure 5 and
Additional data file 7). For these protein families, the distorted topology can be explained by at least one transfer of an
ortholog from a different lineage followed by the displacement of the original gene by the orthologous copy, which
therefore formed a 'xenolog'. Thus, at least 9.3% of the core
genes appear to have been laterally transferred between the

different Synechococcus lineages or between Synechococcus
and Prochlorococcus lineages. An example of such lateral
gene transfer, the ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase
(an enzyme of the GS/GOGAT pathway that is involved in
ammonium assimilation), is illustrated in Additional data file
8. This tree suggests that at least two LGTs between clades V
and III and between clades IX and II have occurred (Table 1).

Phyletic patterns
In order to analyze the relationships between phylogeny
based on protein sequences and genome composition further,
we constructed a phylogenetic network based on shared gene
content (Figure 6a). The relationships between strains in this
network are very similar to those observed in the core protein
tree (Figure 4a), with the notable exception of the position of
RS9917, which clearly groups together with WH5701, indicating that these strains have an unexpected number of genes in
common, given their phylogenetic distance. Indeed, WH5701
and RS9917 specifically share almost as many protein families as do the two clade IV strains CC9902 and BL107 and
even more than the closely related strains WH7803 and
WH7805 (Figure 6b). All other pairs of strains made with
either WH5701 or RS9917 have far fewer families in common.
Though WH5701 and RS9917 are both euryhaline,
examination of the set of 61 protein families specific to both
strains (Additional data file 2, lines 403-463) shows that most
of them have no known function or general predicted function
only, and further characterization (for example by gene
knockout) is therefore needed to confirm the potential role of
these genes in conferring this specificity. The genes shared by
these two strains are notably conserved, however, with a

higher bootstrap values. Percentage values indicate the proportion of gene families that support each consensus bipartition. Only nine consensus
bipartitions were found with the Condense software. These bipartitions, represented by orange stars and numbered from 1 to 9, do not conflict with one
another and can be combined in a single consensus tree that has the same topology as the tree of core proteins (Figure 4a) except for the position of
Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313. Some consensus bipartitions are supported by a low percentage of gene families. This is likely an effect of the rapid divergence
between marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus leading to very small internal branches in phylogenetic trees. (b) Modified Lento plot for bipartitions

gene family can conflict with several bipartitions.

higher level of sequence similarity than with any homolog
found in another bacterial lineage. Furthermore, a number of
these genes are gathered into islands or smaller clusters,
ranging in size from 2-17 genes ('islets'), and with the same
gene order in both strains. This suggests that these genes have
been transferred between members of sub-cluster 5.2 and
clade VIII (5.1B). Finally, these two strains also share a common pigmentation, and this can be attributed to their similar
phycobilisome gene complement [29], including two specific
phycocyanin rod linkers, CpcC and CpcD (Additional data file
2).

Towards a better systematics of marine
picocyanobacteria
The availability of numerous complete genome sequences of
marine picocyanobacteria provides an opportunity to compare ribotype diversity with protein-coding gene diversity

and test the applicability of the bacterial species concept for
this set of strains. Although 16S rRNA gene identity is greater
than 95.5% across the Synechococcus group, the average
nucleotide identity (ANI) of genes shared between every pair
of genomes is significantly lower than the threshold value of
approximately 94%, which, according to Konstantinidis and
Tiedje [44], is equivalent to the currently accepted species
threshold of 70% DNA-DNA hybridization [45]. Indeed,
when considering the picocyanobacterial core proteins, the
ANI value ranges from 65.7% between CC9902 (or BL107,
clade IV) and RCC307 (clade X) up to only 91.3% between
strains BL107 and CC9902 (both clade IV), though the latter
strains have identical 16S rRNA gene sequences (Figure 7).
ANI values are even lower when considering the larger set of
Synechococcus core proteins (data not shown). We detected a
clear limit (ANI approximately 80-84%) that differentiates
Synechococcus isolates belonging to the same clade

(CC9902/BL107) or to closely related clades (WH7803/
WH7805) from members of more divergent clades. In
contrast, there is no such clear limit for 16S rRNA gene
sequence identity but rather a continuum of values ranging
from 95.5-100%. Thus, ANI appears to be a better estimator
than 16S rRNA gene identity for assigning strains to a given
clade. Nevertheless, one may question whether or not Synechococcus 'clades' are equivalent to 'species' or 'ecotypes'
sensu Cohan and Perry [46], that is, groups of microorganisms that are genetically and ecologically similar to one
another. BL107 and CC9902, though isolated from very different areas (the California current and the Western Mediterranean Sea, respectively), share the same pigmentation (and
both chromatically adapt) and, therefore, likely occupy the
same niche, at least with regard to light. In contrast, WH7803
and WH7805 have a different pigmentation (pigment types 2
and 3a, respectively) [29] and, therefore, appear to be genet-

ically adapted to occupy distinct niches. Thus, the first two
strains could be members of the same 'species'/'ecotype',
whereas the second pair would not, despite the fact that they
are 99.6% identical at the 16S rRNA gene sequence level. It
must be noted that several clades defined by Fuller and coworkers [18] contain strains that are 100% identical at the 16S
rRNA gene sequence level but belong to a different pigment
type, so cannot be considered the same 'species'/ecotypes
(also see [47]). As a corollary, many currently defined Synechococcus 'clades' [12-15] might represent some intermediate
level between 'species' and 'genus'. If, as we propose, CC9902
and BL107 are members of the same 'species', then the
threshold for delineating 'species' in the marine Synechococcus complex would lie somewhere between 87 and 91% ANI,
that is, lower than for Proteobacteria [44]. This percentage
should, however, be refined in future as more Synechococcus

strains belonging to the same clade and/or species are
sequenced.
It is important to note that neither ANI nor 16S rRNA gene
sequence identity make it possible to completely resolve the
Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus genera from one
another. As a result of their biased GC content and accelerated evolution [22,24,48], Prochlorococcus strains with
streamlined genomes (SS120 and MED4) fall well apart from
Synechococcus spp., with ANI values generally below 65%
(Figure 7). However, Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 (and
likely other members of this clade such as MIT9303 [23])
cannot be distinguished from Synechococcus spp. based on
this criterion, since most ANI values between MIT9313 and
each of the Synechococcus strains range from 64.7-69.7, that
is, values not significantly different from those obtained
between pairs of Synechococcus strains (range 65.7-77.9,
excluding the two aforementioned pairs). Nevertheless, it
seems taxonomically valid to consider these two genera separately, since representatives of the genus Prochlorococcus
display a number of unique traits, such as the presence of an
intrinsic light-harvesting antenna binding divinyl derivatives
of chlorophylls a and b [8,49,50]. Moreover, even though
there are few Prochlorococcus-specific genes [23], members
of this genus lack 70 protein families common to all the Synechococcus strains under study (Additional data file 1).

Ecological implications
The distribution and relative abundance of sub-cluster 5.1
clades in the natural environment suggests the existence of
two major lifestyle strategies for marine Synechococcus:
'open ocean/specialists' that dominate in warm-oligotrophic
or temperate/polar-mesotrophic waters; and 'coastal/opportunists' that can be found either in coastal areas or across a
broad range of ecosystems in relatively low numbers, but
occasionally reaching higher numbers in the vicinity of
upwelling areas or following environmental perturbations
[21]. The newly proposed sub-groups A and B within subcluster 5.1 may reflect this dichotomy and correspond to ecologically coherent groups. Separation between these two lifestyles, reminiscent of the distinction between HL and LL
Prochlorococcus clades [10], could have occurred early in the
evolutionary history of marine Synechococcus. The partition
of these two 'eco-groups' is further supported by the number
of genes encoding two-component system histidine kinases
and response regulators. Synechococcus clades II, III, IV (≡
sub-group A), which are prevalent in open-ocean waters,
exhibit characteristically low numbers of regulatory systems
(Figure 8). In contrast, the regulatory capacity of the subgroup B (clades I, V, VI, VIII IX) and sub-cluster 5.2, which
have to cope with much more variable environments, is
higher. Future sequencing of environmental genomes should
allow confirmation and refinement of the molecular basis of
this partitioning.

Conclusion

Comparative genomics on a large set of Synechococcus isolates allowed us to precisely define the core genome and
enlightened us to the considerable flexibility of the accessory
genome in this group, which is due in large part to a highly
variable number of unique genes, preferentially located in
islands. The large genomic and physiological diversity occurring between and within current Synechococcus 'clades' [1215] suggests the use of smaller, ecologically distinct fundamental units (that is, 'species' or 'ecotypes') for evaluating
taxonomic diversity within this group. Since the
identification of populations of marine Synechococcus
adapted to different ecological niches is now relatively well
advanced [12,18,19,21,22,51], the incorporation of such ecological data, together with robust DNA sequence clusters
resulting from genome comparisons of cultured strains and of
environmental isolates, will undoubtedly make it possible to
establish an ecologically meaningful systematics for marine
picocyanobacteria.
Even though the distribution of Synechococcus clades within
broad habitats (that is, over large spatial or temporal scales)
can be defined using core gene markers, for example, the 16S
rRNA gene [19,21] or rpoC1 gene [17], adaptation to narrow
ecological niches (that is, at local scales) is most likely made
possible by the flexibility and/or diversity of the accessory
genome. The most obvious illustration of this is the absence
of congruence between cell pigmentation and phylogeny that
can be related to lateral transfer between Synechococcus lineages of the gene region encoding phycobilisome rod components. Thus, horizontal transfer of novel genes (or homologs
of existing genes) within genomic islands appears to be a key
mechanism for acquiring novel phenotypes and ecological
functions. The apparently high turnover of many of these laterally transferred genes increases the probability that they
may be useful for cells to adapt to local environmental
conditions.

Materials and methods
Sequencing, assembly and genome annotation
Whole genome sequencing was performed, starting from
DNA of axenic strains or strains with low bacterial
contamination, either by the Genoscope for Synechococcus
spp. WH7803 and RCC307, by the J Craig Venter Institute for
WH7805, BL107, RS9916, RS9917 and WH5701, or by the
Joint Genome Institute for CC9902 and CC9605, according to
the standard protocols used by these different sequencing
centers [23,48]. The genome sequences reported in this paper
have been deposited in the GenBank database.

Delineation of protein families
Protein families were delineated using all-against-all BLASTp
comparison [52] and the TRIBEMCL clustering algorithm
[53] with an e-value threshold of 10-12. Open reading frames
encoding proteins smaller than 100 amino acids were

compared against the whole protein set using a less stringent
threshold (10-5) and those with significant hits were added to
protein families. A number of missing genes were added to
the data set by searching intergenic regions with TBLASTN
[52] against the whole proteome of the 14 genomes and then
against the NCBI non-redundant protein database. An inhouse database system (Cyanorak), accessible to all annotators through a web front-end, was set up to manually refine
the annotation of protein families. A read-only version of this
database is publicly accessible [54].

Determination of islands
In a previous study [25], islands were identified by breaks in
synteny in closely related Prochlorococcus. However, this
approach was not applicable for the strains analyzed here,
due to the simultaneous comparison of multiple genomes and
a high background of numerous genomic rearrangements
that interrupt synteny. Instead, we used methods modified

from Hsiao and co-workers [55] and Rusch and co-workers
[56] that were less dependent on genome comparisons.
Briefly, gene islands of ≥ 6 genes were suggested by deviation
in tetranucleotide frequency greater than 1 standard deviation in the 1st principal component as compared to the
genome average. The borders of individual islands were
determined with the aid of: proximity of mobility genes (that
is, insertion sequence elements or phage integrases) or tRNA
genes; and/or the occurrence of blocks of core genes. Finally,
a few contiguous blocks of unique and accessory genes that
did not display significant deviation in tetranucleotide frequency were manually added to the predicted set of islands
for several genomes.

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic reconstructions were based on manually aligned
full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences using previous alignments [12]. Where possible, 16S rRNA gene sequences were

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R90

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/5/R90

Genome Biology 2008,

obtained from complete or draft genome sequences, otherwise they were assembled from whole genome shotgun
(WGS) sequence reads using Phred, Phrap and Consed [57].
For the 16S rRNA gene phylogenies, the confidence of branch
points was determined by three separate analyses (NJ, ML
and maximum parsimony), with multifurcations indicating
branch points that were collapsed until supported in a majority of analyses.
Core protein families containing only one gene copy per
genome (1,129 families) were used to make a refined analysis
of the phylogeny of marine picocyanobacteria. Amino acid
sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [58] with default
parameters. After exclusion of ambiguously aligned regions
with Gblocks [59], individual alignments were concatenated
in one super-alignment of 307,757 amino acid sites. ML pairwise distances between sequences of the super-alignment
were computed with TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 [60] using the JTT
model of amino acid substitution and a gamma distribution
parameter alpha of 0.34 (estimated from data set). A leastsquare tree was constructed from the distance matrix using
the Fitch program of the Phylip package [61]. Parsimony and
ML trees were constructed with Protpars [61] and TREEPUZZLE, respectively. Bootstrap analyses were performed by
sampling 1% of the sites of the original super-alignment to
produce 100 alignments of 3,007 positions with the SeqBoot
program [61]. Distance, parsimony and ML trees were also
constructed for individual alignments of protein families. For
ML trees, we used the PhyML program [62] using the JTT
model and an alpha parameter estimated from the data set. A
majority rule consensus tree was constructed from these
individual trees with the Consense program [61]. Gene content phylogeny was built with the phyletic distribution of
sequences in orthologous clusters, using genes shared
between 2-13 genomes, with the ML estimator of Huson and
Steel [63] and bootstrapping of 100 replicates as implemented in SplitsTree 4.8.
Analysis of bipartition spectra was used to detect transfer and
replacement of orthologous genes in lineages of marine Synechococcus and in Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313. A bipartition corresponds to the splitting of a phylogenetic tree in two
parts linked by a single internal branch. ML trees (100 replicates) were built using the PhyML program [62] for 1,317
families of 12 protein-coding genes (that is, excluding P.
marinus MED4 and SS120). A consensus tree was built with
the Consense program from the 1,317 ML trees. Bipartitions
supported with 70% or higher bootstrap values were
extracted from the set of phylogenetic trees. The method of
detection of horizontally transferred genes is based on the
identification of protein families showing one or more bipartitions that conflict significantly with plurality bipartitions of
the consensus tree.

Average nucleotide identity between orthologous
genes
Pairwise ANI was calculated across the entire genome, as
described by Konstantinidis and Tiedje [44], resulting in a
majority of values clustered in a narrow band between 70%
and 73%. An additional, unrestrained estimate of ANI was
calculated across the conserved core component of each
genome, with gene families containing paralogs ignored and
the minimum blast percentage identity threshold (60%)
removed, to provide an alternative estimate of the sequence
divergence of this more restricted set of conserved
orthologues.

Abbreviations

ANI, average nucleotide identity; GOS, Global Ocean Sampling; HL, high light; LGT, lateral gene transfer; LL, low light;
ML, maximum likelihood; NJ, neighbor joining; WGS, whole
genome shotgun.

Authors' contributions

AD, MO, DJS and FP conceived the study. They also wrote the
paper together with LG, NT, BPP, AFP and WRH. MO, SM
and BPP grew cultures and provided the DNA used to
sequence the nine unpublished Synechococcus strains
described in this study. PW, CD, JJ and SF worked on the
sequencing and/or assembly of, altogether, seven strains, and
DJS, FP and BPP coordinated their manual genome annotation. AD performed the clustering of orthologous proteins
and set-up a web site for annotating these clusters. AD, MO,
DJS, LG, SM, BPP, ITP, NT, AFP, WRH and FP contributed to
manual annotation of these protein families. AD and MO did
most of the bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
