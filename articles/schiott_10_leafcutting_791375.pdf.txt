Leaf-cutting ant fungi produce cell wall
degrading pectinase complexes reminiscent
of phytopathogenic fungi

Abstract
Background: Leaf-cutting (attine) ants use their own fecal material to manure fungus gardens, which consist of
leaf material overgrown by hyphal threads of the basidiomycete fungus Leucocoprinus gongylophorus that lives in
symbiosis with the ants. Previous studies have suggested that the fecal droplets contain proteins that are produced
by the fungal symbiont to pass unharmed through the digestive system of the ants, so they can enhance new
fungus garden growth.
Results: We tested this hypothesis by using proteomics methods to determine the gene sequences of fecal
proteins in Acromyrmex echinatior leaf-cutting ants. Seven (21%) of the 33 identified proteins were pectinolytic
enzymes that originated from the fungal symbiont and which were still active in the fecal droplets produced by
the ants. We show that these enzymes are found in the fecal material only when the ants had access to fungus
garden food, and we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis to show that the expression of six of
these enzyme genes was substantially upregulated in the fungal gongylidia. These unique structures serve as food
for the ants and are produced only by the evolutionarily advanced garden symbionts of higher attine ants, but not
by the fungi reared by the basal lineages of this ant clade.
Conclusions: Pectinolytic enzymes produced in the gongylidia of the fungal symbiont are ingested but not
digested by Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants so that they end up in the fecal fluid and become mixed with new
garden substrate. Substantial quantities of pectinolytic enzymes are typically found in pathogenic fungi that attack
live plant tissue, where they are known to breach the cell walls to allow the fungal mycelium access to the cell
contents. As the leaf-cutting ant symbionts are derived from fungal clades that decompose dead plant material,
our results suggest that their pectinolytic enzymes represent secondarily evolved adaptations that are convergent
to those normally found in phytopathogens.

Background
The fascinating natural history of obligate mutualistic
symbioses, in which two completely different organisms
live in a close and fully interdependent relationship, are
increasingly unraveled by studies of extant adaptations
and phylogenetic history [1-3]. Such intimate relationships have the potential to become very complex
because their coevolution may produce specialized
structures that provide indirect fitness via the symbiotic
partner [4,5]. This may constrain a detailed

understanding of the key molecular processes that maintain the symbiosis, so that identifying the gene
sequences involved in these processes is of paramount
importance. New high-throughput methods offer the
opportunity to obtain a more comprehensive molecular
understanding of so-called “nonmodel” organisms
involved in obligate symbioses. Illustrative examples are
the recent genome sequencing projects on Laccaria and
black truffle fungi, which have led to significant new
insights into the respective roles of these fungi in ectomycorrhizal symbioses [6,7].

as fungal gardens in underground nest chambers. The
ants provide the fungus with a growth substrate consisting of freshly cut leaf fragments. After new leaf fragments are brought into the nest, the ants chew them
into smaller pieces and apply droplets of fecal fluid to
the leaf pulp before depositing this mixed substrate in
the fungus garden and inoculating it with small tufts of
mycelium from older parts of the garden [8]. Previous
work has shown that the fecal fluid of a wide range of
attine species contains various digestive enzymes such
as proteases, amylases and chitinases [9-12]. The fecal
fluid of Atta colombica tonsipes has also been shown to
contain enzymes to degrade pectin, xylan, carboxymethylcellulose and several disaccharides as well as synthetic p-nitrophenyl glycosides [13]. It has been
suggested that the three fecal fluid proteases of Atta texana and Atta colombica tonsipes originate from the fungal symbiont, as proteases with similar biochemical
properties could be isolated from the garden mycelium
[14]. A more recent study used isoelectric focusing to
show that cellulases, pectinases and laccases present in
the fecal droplets of Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants had
properties similar to those of fungus-produced enzymes,
which likewise suggested a fungal origin of these
enzymes [15]. However, it is rarely made explicit that
the implications of this notion are rather spectacular, as
this would imply that these fecal proteins are not
affected by the digestive system of the ants and that
they must have important functions for the symbiosis to
compensate for the ants not under selection to digest
these proteins.
The primary food source of leaf-cutting ants consists
of the swollen hyphal tips, called gongylidia, that their
fungus gardens produce in clusters (staphylae). These
structures are not known from any other fungi and are
believed to be produced exclusively for the benefit of
the ants. If the fecal droplet proteins would indeed be
directly derived from the fungus ingested by the ants,
we should expect the gongylidia to be the primary
source of these proteins. Here we use state-of-the-art
molecular techniques (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectrometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), gene cloning, and quantitative enzyme
assays) to test the validity of the idea that fungal proteins are excreted in ant fecal droplets to be recycled for
active service in the decomposition of new leaf
fragments.
Our study focuses on pectinolytic enzymes, as previous studies have shown that these enzymes are present
in the ant fecal droplets and because pectinolytic
enzymes are known to play a key role in the infection
process of live plants by necrotrophic fungal pathogens

[16-18]. The fungi that are cultivated by leaf-cutting
ants of the genera Acromyrmex and Atta belong to a
clade of universal decomposers (Basidiomycotina: Agaricaceae: Leucocoprinae), but secondarily, and exceptionally, have evolved the ability to decompose live plant
material that is offered to them as substrate by the
farming ants [19]. The ant-fungus mutualism is thus
facing similar selection pressures as necrotrophic fungi,
that is, to breach the cell walls of living plant tissues to
gain access to the nutritious interior of these cells. We
therefore tested the hypothesis that gongylidia consumption and fecal droplet deposition might have evolved to
concentrate and transport fungal pectinolytic enzymes
to the upper part of fungus gardens to enhance the
degradation of live plant cell walls immediately after
they are processed by the ants.
We confirm that a large number of distinct proteins
survive gut passage, that many of them are pectinolytic
enzymes, that they are active in fecal droplets only when
the ants are allowed to feed on symbiont mycelium and
that the genes encoding these proteins are overexpressed in the gongylidia.

Results
SDS-PAGE of fecal droplet proteins resulted in a specific pattern of protein bands (Figure 1b) that was highly
reproducible. To identify the proteins, 24 bands were
extracted from the gel and subjected to tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS). This resulted in 90 different
peptide sequences determined from the MS/MS spectra.
In a first approach to identifying the proteins from
which these peptides originated, we designed degenerate
primers matching the amino acid sequences of the peptides and used them in PCR reactions using cDNA from
the fungal symbiont as template. By this method, we
were able to identify 14 fecal droplet proteins. In a second approach, the sequences were used in a Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search of a newly generated database (M. Schiøtt et al., unpublished work)
containing approximately 700 Mb of genome sequence
data of the fungal symbiont obtained by 454 sequencing
[20], which led to the identification of an additional 19
fecal droplet proteins. In both cases, rapid amplification
of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR was subsequently used to
obtain the full-length sequences of the genes encoding
these proteins. Among the 33 gene sequences identified
by these methods, 7 were found to share a high degree
of similarity with enzymes involved in the degradation
of pectin (Table 1). The molecular mass of the proteins
calculated from the corresponding cDNA sequences
were in all cases similar to the molecular mass predicted
from SDS-PAGE, indicating that the proteins in the
fecal material are full-length proteins and not just short
degradation products.

To reveal whether the obtained pectinolytic enzymes
were in fact active in the fecal droplets of the ants,
activity assays of five of the six identified types of
enzymes were performed on single fecal droplets of nine
ants taken from each of three different colonies. The
same activity measurements were performed on fecal
material from a similar number of ants that were kept
for more than 2 weeks on sugar water and bramble
leaves, but without the fungal symbiont to confirm the
fungal origin of the enzyme activities. Without exception, the enzyme assays showed pronounced activity in
fecal material from ants kept with their fungal symbiont,
whereas fecal material from ants deprived of their symbiont showed almost no activity (Figure 2). The low
activities apparently still present in some of the assays
on fecal droplets from the starved ants were most likely
artefacts because any colored substances in the fecal
material will absorb light during the spectrophotometric

assays and will consequently produce a weak false-positive signal. Alternatively, some enzyme activity may
remain in the fecal fluid of the ants even after 2 weeks
of separation from the fungal symbiont. Enzyme assays
of heat-denatured fecal droplets hardly showed any
activity, confirming the appropriateness of our activity
measurements (data not shown). Activity measurements
for the sixth pectinase, rhamnogalacuronan acetylesterase, were not been performed as no suitable assay could
be found.
To test whether the expression level of the identified
pectinolytic enzymes is upregulated in the gongylidia,
the main food of the ants, RNA was extracted both
from gongylidia and from gongylidia-free mycelium
taken from fungus gardens of four different colonies.
After reverse transcription of the mRNA into cDNA,
the expression levels of the genes were measured by
qPCR using three different reference genes to normalize

the data. Six of the seven genes showed significant upregulation in the gongylidia (Figure 3), while one gene
(pectate lyase) was equally expressed in the two types of
tissue. The latter gene had a relatively high cycle threshold (Ct ) value in the qPCR (and also a high PCR efficiency value), suggesting that it was only weakly
expressed. Peptide sequence tags for the pectate lyase
genes were found only in the weak bands 7 and 8
(Figure 1b), confirming that this enzyme does not play
an important functional role in the fecal droplets.

Discussion
Our tandem mass spectrometry analyses identified seven
pectinolytic enzymes in the fecal material of Acromyrmex echinatior leaf-cutting ants. Activity assays showed
that these enzymes were still active after passage
through the ant gut, and our feeding and gene cloning
experiments showed that these enzymes must be derived
from the ingested fungal tissue (Figure 1a). This is consistent with findings that pectinolytic enzymes are very
rarely produced by animals [21,22]. The number of proteins that we were able to visualize on the SDS-PAGE
gels remained limited (Figure 1b), suggesting that many
other proteins in the fungal food are being degraded in
the ant guts. This is as expected because proteins are

valuable nutrients with high nitrogen content, a resource
that is clearly limiting for the overall performance of the
symbiosis [23,24]. The fact that we were able to document the earlier inference [14,15] that some proteins,
including pectinolytic enzymes, are not digested in the
ant gut indicates that selection for decomposition efficiency has affected the exosymbiosis between ant and
fungi at a deep molecular level. We expect that other
bands on our SDS-PAGE gels represent proteins with
important functions in the symbiosis, and work to unravel these functions is ongoing.
The production, circulation and function of pectinolytic
enzymes in the symbiosis

Gongylidia, the swollen hyphal tips produced by the
fungal symbionts of the higher attine ants (including the
leaf-cutting ants), are generally considered to be
the almost exclusive food source of the ants and their
broods [8,25-27]. They are found nowhere else other
than in these fungal symbionts and thus represent an
evolutionarily derived trait that has been inferred to be
adaptive for symbiosis [27]. However, the details of this
adaptive function have remained poorly understood. For
example, it has previously been suggested that only the
larvae of leaf-cutting ants rely exclusively on a fungal

diet [28], whereas later research has shown that adult
workers also ingest significant amounts of fungus garden
material [29], a notion that is corroborated by our present study. Here we have shown that the gongylidia not
only serve as nutrition for the ants but also produce
enzymes needed for the degradation of the plant substrate in much higher quantities than in undifferentiated

mycelium. Our results thus imply that we have likely
discovered an important adaptive function of the gongylidia, as we showed earlier that pectin degradation in
newly grown sections of leaf-cutting ant gardens proceeds at a very high rate and with the primary function
of providing access to the fresh cell contents of the leaf
tissue [23]. The farming ants clearly prioritize highly

digestible nutrients such as proteins and starch relative
to the bulk of cell wall material, which tends to be discarded on the dump piles that leaf-cutting ants maintain
[23,25] (Møller I, De Fine Licht HH, Harholt J, Willats
WGT, Boomsma JJ: The dynamics of plant cell-wall
polysaccharide decomposition in leaf-cutting ant fungus
gardens, unpublished work). These studies also indicate
that the degradation of pectin itself is unlikely to contribute much to the available resources of a leaf-cutting
ant nest relative to the proteins and starch from the
interior of the plant cells.
Pectinolytic enzymes are known to be important for the
virulence of both bacterial and fungal phytopathogens
[17]. A recent study comparing the gene inventories of
phytopathogenic versus free-living filamentous ascomycetes found that pectinolytic enzyme genes were more
common in pathogenic fungi [18]. When the pathogenic
fungus Fusarium oxysporum is grown on a plant cell
wall substrate, pectinolytic enzymes are the first
enzymes to be secreted, followed by other carbohydrate
active enzymes [30]. Gene disruption studies have

shown that the virulence of fungal phytopathogens may
decrease significantly when a pectinolytic enzyme gene
is mutated [31], although in most cases more than one
gene has to be mutated to affect virulence, owing to
redundancy between multiple isoforms of these genes in
the fungal genomes [32]. Also, Erwinia chrysanthemi
bacteria produce a wide range of pectinolytic enzymes
upon infection of plant tissue, and inactivation of at
least some of these genes makes infection by these bacteria ineffective.
Plant pathogenic microorganisms typically produce
many different pectinolytic enzymes targeting both the
pectin side chains and the backbones of the molecules,
as both are apparently needed to breach the cell wall to
gain access to the cell content [16,17]. In our study, we
found one pectinolytic enzyme targeted toward the
backbone of the smooth region that was upregulated in
the gongylidia (polygalacturonase), whereas another
(pectate lyase) was found without being upregulated
(Figure 3). Otherwise, we found a pectinesterase that
removes methyl groups of the smooth region of pectin

Schiøtt et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:156
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/156

molecules and several enzymes targeted toward the
hairy regions, including an arabinogalactan endo-1,4-bgalactosidase and an arabinofuranosidase that, respectively, remove galactose and arabinose from the side
chains. In addition, we found two very similar rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterases, which remove acetyl
groups from the rhamnose moieties of the hairy region.
However, no degradation enzymes targeted toward the
backbone of the pectin hairy regions were found. We
have previously found enzymatic activity toward rhamnogalacturonan in the fecal droplet material (unpublished work Schiøtt M), but apparently the abundance of
that protein was not high enough to be detected by the
methods used in the present paper.
Selection pressure, evolutionary pathways and
convergence

When new leaf material is brought into the ant nest, it
is added to the top of the fungus garden, and tufts of
mycelium are subsequently placed on it [8]. This
means that the leaf-to-mycelium ratio in the top of
gardens is very high, so that production of digestive
enzymes by these small mycelial tufts is likely to be a
limiting step in the degradation process. Application of
high concentrations of these enzymes via the fecal
fluid of the ants thus increases the turnover rate of
garden substrate, which may provide some compensation for the relatively low nitrogen to carbon ratio of
the leaf material. This may be why this intricate pathway of having pectinolytic enzymes brought in from
mature parts of the garden via the digestive system of
the ants could evolve by favoring mutations that
allowed these enzymes to accumulate in the hindgut
rather than being degraded.
Plant tissues usually contain chemical compounds that
have evolved to protect against attack from herbivores
and fungal or bacterial pathogens [33]. Being of saprotrophic origin, the free-living ancestors of the attine ant
fungal symbionts may not have possessed mechanisms
to cope with such defenses expressed in live plant tissues. The chewing behavior of ant workers turning leaf
fragments into pulp before mycelium is inoculated may
therefore make decomposition highly effective when it
is combined with the application of large amounts of
pectinolytic enzymes that open up and kill the plant
cells so that the production of any secondary defensive
compounds is terminated. This would imply that it is
the combined effort of the unholy alliance [34] between
ants and fungus that allowed the efficient utilization of
fresh leaves as a novel resource, something neither of
the symbiotic partners would have been able to do on
its own.
The fungi that are cultivated by Latin American leafcutting ants of the genera Acromyrmex and Atta are

Page 8 of 12

highly peculiar, because they belong to a universally
dead substrate decomposition clade (Agaricales: Agaricaceae: Leucocoprinae), but have secondarily evolved the
ability to degrade live plant material when it is offered
to them as substrate by the ant farmers [19]. Recent studies have shown that the fungus reared by the leaf-cutting ants throughout their range may be a single
genetically variable species (Leucocoprinus gongylophorus) that replaced older symbionts in a single selective sweep only a few million years ago [35]. Future
studies should address the extent to which pectinolytic
enzymes are upregulated in the gongylidia of the less
derived fungal symbionts of Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex, genera of higher attine ants that also rear symbionts with gongylidia, but with a much lower
proportion of fresh leaf material in their diet [36]. In
addition, it would be highly interesting to unravel the
degree of convergence at the molecular level between
the pectinolytic enzymes of leaf-cutting ant garden symbionts and fungi that are free-living parasites of fresh
leaves.

Conclusions
We have shown that pectinolytic enzyme genes are
overproduced in the gongylidia of leaf-cutting ant
fungal symbionts. After ingestion of the gongylidia,
the enzymes pass through the ant gut and end up in
the fecal fluid, where a significant fraction of these
enzymes remain functional. Droplets of this fecal
fluid are mixed with the new leaf material that the
ants fragment to become fungus garden substrate,
and we infer that it is particularly in this time
window that the pectinolytic enzymes enhance the
efficiency of the symbiosis. This jointly produced
adaptive response to overcome cell wall defenses of
fresh plant substrate resembles the enzymatic
mechanisms that phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria
realize by themselves when facing similar challenges
of decomposing fresh plant material. This suggests
either that these traits have evolved convergently in
the different fungal lineages or that the ancestors of
the leaf-cutting ant symbionts were somehow preadapted to a necrotrophic lifestyle. We believe that
the former explanation is most likely, but explicit
studies on nondomesticated leucocoprinous fungi are
needed to confirm this contention.
Methods
Biological material and a summary of pectin cell biology

Colonies of Acromyrmex echinatior (numbers Ae263,
Ae280, Ae282, Ae322, Ae332, Ae335 and Ae349) were
collected in Gamboa, Panama, in 2004-2007 and maintained in the laboratory under standard conditions of
about 25°C and about 70% relative humidity [37], where

Schiøtt et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:156
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/156

they were supplied with a diet of bramble leaves, rice
and pieces of apple. In experiments using ants that were
deprived of their fungal symbiont, the ants were instead
fed a diet of bramble leaves and 20% sugar water. Fecal
droplets were collected by squeezing large worker ants
with forceps on the head and abdomen until they deposited a drop of fecal material. A quantity of 0.5 μL of
water was added to the droplet before it was collected
with a micropipette.
Pectins are polysaccharides composed of smooth
regions of (1,4)-linked a-D-galacturonic acid (GalpA)
interspersed with hairy regions where (1,2)-linked a-Lrhamnose alternates with GalpA [38,39]. About half
of the rhamnose residues are branched with mainly Larabinosyl- and/or D-galactosyl-containing side chains,
although several other types of sugars may also be
used [40]. Breakdown of the backbone of the smooth
regions is accomplished by endo- and exopolygalacturonases, as well as by pectin and pectate lyases, whereas
breakdown of the backbone of the hairy regions is
mediated by rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase, rhamnogalacturonan galacturonohydrolase, a-rhamnosidase
and rhamnogalacturonan lyase [41]. A wide variety
of enzymes related to release of L-arabinose and Dgalactose are also used to break down the side chains
of the hairy regions [41]. Finally, the activity of these
pectinolytic enzymes depends on the degree of methylation and acetylation of the pectin, so that the
removal of methyl and acetyl groups by methyl and
acetyl esterases is also a prerequisite for efficient pectin degradation. This general knowledge of pectin biochemistry allowed us to make some inferences with
regard to the functions of the pectinolytic enzymes
that we were able to identify.
SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry

Fifty fecal droplets from workers of colony Ae263 were
collected and put immediately into 2× SDS-PAGE
loading buffer (100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mM
dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue, 20%
glycerol) and loaded onto a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel
[42]. The gel was run for 1 hour at 60 mA, followed
by 1 hour at 75 mA with cooling, and stained for
3 hours with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (0.25%
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, 0.44% ethanol, 9.2%
acetic acid) and destained in 5% ethanol and 7.5%
acetic acid overnight.
Sample preparation methods for MS were modified
from Shevchenko et al. [43]. In brief, bands of interest
were manually excised from the gel and washed with
deionized water followed by two washes with 100% acetonitrile for 15 and 2 minutes, respectively. The gel plugs
were dehydrated in a vacuum centrifuge and rehydrated

Page 9 of 12

with a solution of 2% trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) in 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 at 4°C. After 20 minutes,
the excess of trypsin solution was removed and 30 μL of
50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 were added to allow digestion to
proceed at 37°C overnight, after which samples were
stored at -20°C until use. Peptide desalting was performed on custom-made reverse-phase microcolumns
prepared with R2 resin (Perseptive Biosystems Inc.,
Framingham, MA, USA) as described elsewhere [44].
Peptide solutions obtained from digestions of each separate spot were loaded onto a microcolumn, followed by
washing with 10 μL of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).
Bound peptides were eluted with 0.8 μL of matrix solution (5 μg/μL a-cyano-4-hydrocynnamic acid in 70%
acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA) directly onto the matrixassisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) target
plate. Peptide mass spectra were acquired in positive
reflector mode on a 4800 Plus MALDI-TOF/TOF™ Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using
20 kV of acceleration voltage. Each spectrum was
obtained with a total of 800 laser shots and was externally calibrated using peptides derived by tryptic digestion of b-lactoglobulin.
Tandem mass spectra were acquired using the same
instrument in MS/MS-positive mode. From the raw data
output, peak lists were generated using Data Explorer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). MS and
MS/MS peak lists were combined into search files and
used to search the National Center for Biotechnology
Information protein sequence database using the Mascot
search engine (Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK). Since
sequence information was not available in the database
from either the ant or the fungus, the searches did not
result in identification of any protein. As a consequence,
manual de novo sequencing was performed on the basis
of the presence of b and y peptide fragment ions in MS/
MS spectra [45]. To facilitate de novo sequencing, the
remaining sample was derived by adding 7 μL of 10 μg/
μL 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate dissolved in 50 mM
NaHCO3, pH 8.6. The reaction was allowed to proceed
for 30 minutes at 50°C and terminated using 1 μL of 1%
TFA. The mixture was then loaded on a desalting
column (as described above), eluted on the target and
analyzed using 4800 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in MS/MS mode.
Derived peptides (showing a mass difference of 215 Da
compared to the original MS spectra) were sequenced
using the same instrument in MS/MS-positive mode.
The obtained MS/MS spectra from underivatized and
derivatized samples were analyzed manually supported
by the AminoCalc program (Protana A/S, Odense, Denmark) to find the distance between fragment ions and to
obtain amino acid sequences [46].

RNA isolation

RNA was isolated from the fungal symbiont using an
RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with
modifications of the protocol. Fungus garden material
was ground in liquid nitrogen and 100 mg were added
to 700 μL of the RLC lysis buffer (with addition of
b-mercaptoethanol) included in the RNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was extracted
twice with an equal amount of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), pH 8, followed by one extraction
with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The final extract
was further purified using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit
following the enclosed protocol from the step where the
extract is loaded on a QIAshredder column. An on-column DNase I treatment step was included as described
in the protocol.
PCR and gene cloning

Sequencing of full length gene products was performed using a RACE strategy. 3"- and 5"-RACE
libraries were made from approximately 1 μg of the
purified RNA with the SMART RACE cDNA kit
(Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), and gene
sequences were PCR amplified from these libraries
using specific primers designed from the fungal genome sequence along with the primers enclosed in the
SMART RACE cDNA kit (for primer sequences, see
Additional file 1, Table S1). The following PCR
scheme was used to amplify the genes: one cycle of
95°C for 5 minutes, 10 cycles of 94°C for 20 seconds,
72°C for 30 seconds (with a decrease in temperature
of 0.5°C in every cycle) and 72°C for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 20 seconds, 67°C for
30 seconds and 72°C for 2 minutes, and ending with
one cycle of 72°C for 7 minutes. Five of the pectinolytic genes were initially cloned by degenerate PCR
using the cDNA libraries described above as the template. In these instances, the PCR scheme used was as
follows: one cycle of 95°C for 5 minutes, 35 cycles of
94°C for 20 seconds, 50°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for
2 minutes, and ending with one cycle of 72°C for 7
minutes. All PCR products were cloned in pCR4TOPO before sequencing using the TOPO TA cloning
method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Gene
sequences were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers HQ174763-HQ174771. For primer
sequences, see Addtional file 1, Table S1.
Quantitative real-time PCR

Pure mycelium and staphylae (clusters of gongylidia)
used for real-time PCR were collected with forceps from
small pieces of fungus garden (colonies Ae263, Ae280,
Ae322, Ae335) using a stereomicroscope and put
directly into liquid nitrogen before further processing to

Page 10 of 12

extract RNA (see RNA isolation section above). Gene
expression levels of the pectinolytic enzymes in gongylidia and gongylidia-free mycelium were determined using
qPCR. Either 200 ng or 1,000 ng of total RNA from
pure mycelium or staphylae (clusters of gongylidia) were
reverse-transcribed to cDNA with Superscript III reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer and
subsequently diluted 40 times with water. cDNA
(0.5 μL) was used in a 20-μL qPCR reaction with 10 μL
of 2× SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu,
Japan) and 0.4 μl of each primer (10 μM). The qPCR was
run on a Mx3000P QPCR system (Agilent, Santa Clara,
CA, USA) with PCR conditions consisting of one cycle of
95°C for 2 minutes, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds,
55°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds. A melt
curve was included after each run. The primers used in
the qPCR procedure were all positioned in the 3” end of
genes and amplified a DNA fragment of about 250 bps.
At least one of the primers in a pair was spanning an
intron to prevent amplification of genomic DNA (for primer sequences see Additional file 1, Table S1). qPCR
reactions were run in triplicate, and the mean Ct value
was used in the subsequent analyses. The transcript levels
were normalized using three different reference genes:
Elongation factor 1-a (GenBank HQ191273), ubiquitin
(GenBank HQ174771) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GenBank HQ174770). The efficiency of
the qPCR reactions was measured using a dilution series
of templates at four different concentrations. The relative
gene expression levels between mycelium and gongylidia
were determined using the software program REST (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) [47], which uses a pairwise fixed
reallocation randomization test for assessing the significance of the obtained values.
Enzyme assays

Enzyme activities were measured in fecal droplets
harvested from colonies Ae280, Ae332 and Ae349.
Arabinofuranosidase activity was determined by
incubating one fecal droplet in 100 μL of 1 mM 4nitrophenyl a-L-arabinofuranoside (Sigma N3641)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 50 mM
sodium acetate, pH 5, for 60 minutes at 30°C. A
quantity of 100 μL of 0.5 M Na2CO3 were added, and
the absorbance was read in a Versamax Plus plate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at
405 nm. The absorbance measurements were converted to enzyme units using a standard curve made
with 4-nitrophenol (Sigma 241326). One unit was
defined as the amount of enzyme able to release
1 nM nitrophenol per minute.
Endogalactanase activity was determined by incubating
one fecal droplet in 50 μL of 1% Azo-galactan (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd., Bray, Ireland) and

Schiøtt et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:156
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/156

50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, for 60 minutes at 30°C. A
quantity of 125 μL of 96% ethanol was added, and the
mixture was incubated for 10 minutes before being centrifugated at 1,000 g for 10 minutes. A quantity of 150
μL was transferred to a microtiter plate, and the absorbance was read in a plate reader at 590 nm (Versamax
Plus). The absorbance measurements were converted to
enzyme units using the standard curve provided by the
manufacturer. One unit was defined as the amount of
enzyme able to release 1 nM galactose equivalents per
minute.
Pectate lyase activity was determined by incubating
one fecal droplet in 50 μL of 0.5% citrus pectin
(Sigma P9135), 50 mM TrisÂ·HCl buffer, pH 7, 1 mM
CaCl 2 for 30 minutes at 30°C. The absorbance at
230 nm was read before and after incubation. One
unit was defined as the amount of enzyme able to
increase the absorbance by one unit per hour in a
1-cm path length.
Polygalacturonase activity was determined by incubating one fecal droplet in 100 μL of 0.5% polygalacturonic
acid (Sigma P3889), 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, for
10 minutes at 30°C. A quantity of 50 μL of DNS solution (0.4 M NaOH, 0.04 M 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, 1 M
potassium sodium tartrate) was added, and the mixture
was heated at 99.9°C for 5 minutes in a PCR machine
[48]. A quantity of 50 μL of the mixture was added to
150 μL of water, and the absorbance at 540 nm was
read in a plate reader (Versamax Plus). The absorbance
measurements were converted to units using a standard
curve made with glucose. One unit was defined as the
amount of enzyme able to release 1 μg of glucose
equivalents per minute.
Pectinesterase activity was determined using a titrimetric method [49]. One fecal droplet was added to
250 μL of 1% citrus pectin (Sigma P9135), 100 mM
NaCl, pH 6.1, and pH was maintained at 6.1 over a 5minute period by addition of 5 mM NaOH. The amount
of NaOH used corresponds to the amount of protons
released by the activity of pectinesterase, and one unit
of enzyme activity was consequently expressed as the
nanomolar NaOH added per minute.
