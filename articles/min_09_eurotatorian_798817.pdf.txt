Abstract
Background: The Syndermata (Rotifera+Acanthocephala) is one of the best model systems for
studying the evolutionary origins and persistence of different life styles because it contains a series
of lineage-specific life histories: Monogononta (cyclic parthenogenetic and free-living), Bdelloidea
(entirely parthenogenetic and mostly benthic dweller), Seisonidea (exclusively bisexual and epizoic
or ectoparasitic), and Acanthocephala (sexual and obligatory endoparasitic). Providing phylogenetic
resolution to the question of Eurotatoria (Monogononta and Bdelloidea) monophyly versus
paraphyly is a key factor for better understanding the evolution of different life styles, yet this
matter is not clearly resolved. In this study, we revisited this issue based on comparative analysis
of complete mitochondrial genome information for major groups of the Syndermata.
Results: We determined the first complete mitochondrial genome sequences (15,319 bp) of a
bdelloid rotifer, Rotaria rotatoria. In order to examine the validity of Eurotatoria (Monogononta and
Bdelloidea) monophyly/paraphyly, we performed phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences for
eleven protein-coding genes sampled from a wide variety of bilaterian representatives. The
resulting mitochondrial genome trees, inferred using different algorithms, consistently failed to
recover Monogononta and Bdelloidea as monophyletic, but instead identified them as a
paraphyletic assemblage. Bdelloidea (as represented by R. rotatoria) shares most common ancestry
with Acanthocephala (as represented by L. thecatus) rather than with monogonont B. plicatilis, the
other representative of Eurotatoria.
Conclusion: Comparisons of inferred amino acid sequence and gene arrangement patterns with
those of other metazoan mtDNAs (including those of acanthocephalan L. thecatus and monogonont
B. plicatilis) support the hypothesis that Bdelloidea shares most common ancestry with
Acanthocephala rather than with Monogononta. From this finding, we suggest that the obligatory
asexuality of bdelloideans may have secondarily derived from some other preexisting condition in
earlier lineage of rotifers. Providing a more complete assessment of phylogenetic relationships and
inferring patterns of evolution of different types of life styles among Syndermata awaits
comparisons requiring mitochondrial genome sequencing of Seisonidea.

Background
The Rotifera (also called Rotatoria) is a group of aquatic
micrometazoans, mostly less than a millimeter in size. It
includes more than 2,000 described species that usually
occur in freshwater and marine environments throughout
the world, but some species are found in wet terrestrial
habitats, such as moist soil, or mosses and lichens living
on fallen trees and rocks [1-3]. This group is usually distinguished from other metazoans by presence of the
corona ("wheel organ" = the crown of cilia) located in the
cephalic region, which is used for locomotion and food
gathering. Due to their great abundance and high reproductive potential, rotifers have been considered to play a
significant role in the food webs of certain freshwater
environments through their involvement in energy
cycling and nutrient transfer [4-6]. Most authorities accept
that the Rotifera consists of three classes, each having a
unique reproductive strategy [2,7,8]: Bdelloidea (exclusively parthenogenetic), Monogononta (cyclic parthenogenetic with facultative sexual reproduction), and
Seisonidea (exclusively bisexual). Of these, the class Bdelloidea is very unique in that its species (several hundred)
are exclusively female. This is the largest metazoan asexual
group where no sexual reproduction has ever been
reported and represents an ancient origin of asexuality
with great evolutionary success in the diversification of
the species [9,10]. The class Monogononta, representing
the largest group of rotifers, comprises more than 1,500
species. They are mostly found in freshwater, brackish and
marine waters and are characterized by a unique life cycle,
cyclical parthenogenesis, that alternates between two
reproductive modes, i.e. amictic and mictic phases of
reproduction according to the absence/presence of males,
respectively [2,5]. The class Seisonidea consists of three
epizoic species (belong to two genera, Seison and Paraseison [11]) on marine crustaceans (Nebalia species) and all
of these are known to reproduce by amphimixis [12].
There is little doubt about the close relationship between
Rotifera and Acanthocephala, the clade known as Syndermata because they share the feature of the syncytial epidermis [13,14]. This affinity has received broad support
from many earlier studies utilizing different sources of
phylogenetic information: morphology [15-17], SSU
rDNA sequences [18-20], combined analysis of molecular
and morphological characters [21,22], and combined
analysis of SSU and LSU ribosomal DNA sequences [23].
In contrast to syndermatan monophyly, internal phylogeny within the clade (among Bdelloidea, Monogononta,
Seisonidea, and Acanthocephala) has been the subject of
relatively vigorous contention [24-27]. Most controversies
are related to Eurotatorian monophyly versus paraphyly,
although there are differences regarding the phylogenetic
position of Seisonidea within the clade. The monophyly/
non-monophyly of eurotatorians (Monogononta and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/533

Bdelloidea) relative to Acanthocephala has received much
attention because this issue plays a key role in understanding the evolution and ecological diversity found among
major groups of Syndermata. Lorenzen [15] first recognized the lemnisci (paired projections of the neck epidermis into the body cavity) and proboscis (an invaginable
anterior part of the body) as synapomorphic characters
for unifying the Bdelloidea and Acanthocephala (inferred
the latter as being the highly specialized sister group to the
former; see [24] for different view), and this relationship
has also been recovered in many subsequent molecular
analyses (SSU+LSU+mtDNA cox1 [26]; SSU [19];
SSU+mtDNA 16S [20]; SSU+LSU+histone H3+mtDNA
cox1[28]). Based on morphological and molecular perspectives, Garey et al. [19] recognized Acanthocephala as
a subtaxon of Rotifera and united these two groups under
the superclass 'Lemniscea' (Lemniscea hypothesis-eurotatorian paraphyly). However, eurotatorian monophyly
(Monogononta+Bdelloidea) and sister-group relationship
of Seisonidea and Acanthocephala have also been suggested from some earlier studies based on morphological
evidence (ultrastructural similarity [14,29]; cladistic analysis of morphological dataset [7,30,31]) or from molecular analysis (the partial sequence of nuclear heat-shock
protein hsp82 [8]; SSU rDNA [32]; combined analysis of
hsp82+SSU data [33]). Furthermore, employing different
methods for phylogenetic analysis resulted in inconsistent
tree topologies when SSU data were analyzed [34].
Although the most recently published work from ESTbased phylogenomic analysis supported Eurotatoria paraphyly [27], but the phylogenetic issue regarding the Eurotatoria monophyly/paraphyly still awaits other types of
data for corroboration.
With a very few exceptions, metazoan mitochondrial
genomes are circular DNA molecules (mostly less than 16
kb in size) that encode 37 genes: 13 protein-coding genes
(atp8 is missing in many nematode and flatworm species
so far reported), two ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes [35,36]. Due to its universality and remarkably stable feature in genome content across various
metazoan phyla, comparisons of the mitochondrial
genome information (e.g., nucleotide sequence, amino
acid sequence and gene order rearrangement) have often
proven useful for reconstructing the deep node phylogeny
and for assessing the phylogenetic relationships among
closely related species [36-39]. In recent years, there has
been an unprecedented increase in mitochondrial
genomic surveys in relation to phylogenetic comparisons
of a variety of animal groups. Mitochondrial genome
information has now become available for more than a
thousand animal species (See NCBI metazoan mitochondrial genome resources). However, the distribution of
completely
characterized
mitochondrial
genome
sequences has been strongly biased across the metazoan

taxa: the subphylum Vertebrata and the phylum Arthropoda account for more than 80% of the metazoan mitochondrial genome data determined so far, whereas there
are still a considerable number of metazoan phyla for
which there is limited mitochondrial genome information, and some phyla have never been investigated
[40,41]. Complete mitochondrial genome sequencing
from poorly investigated groups is needed to supplement
a gap in our current understanding of mitochondrial DNA
evolution in the metazoa.
Mitochondrial genome information from the Syndermata
was reported, for the first time, from the acanthocephalan
species Leptorhynchoides thecatus [42] and recently thereafter from the monogonont rotifer Brachionus plicatilis [43].
Despite belonging to the same clade (Syndermata), the
mitochondrial genomes reported for these two organisms
did not share many characteristics in their organization
such as chromosome structure, gene order, codon usage
and the secondary structure of tRNA molecules. For example, the mitochondrial genome of B. plicatilis, a representative of the Monogononta, is encoded in two separate
mitochondrial chromosomes, each having different gene
content and copy number. In contrast, as in most metazonas, all genes of L. thecatus mtDNA are encoded in a single
type of circular mitochondrial DNA molecule. The lack of
common features in the mitochondrial genomes between
these species necessitates additional characterization of
mitochondrial genomes from the other major groups of
the syndermata. Information from Bdelloidea is expected
to supplement our understanding of syndermatan mitochondrial genome evolution and provide utility as a
molecular marker in resolving internal phylogeny among
the major groups of the Syndermata. To this end, we characterized the first complete mitochondrial genome
sequence of the bdelloid species Rotaria rotatoria, and
compared its mitochondrial genome information with
other syndermatan species in order to investigate phylogenetic issues regarding the monophyly or paraphyly of
Eurotatoria.

Results and Discussion
General features of the R. rotatoria mitochondrial
genome
The mitochondrial genome of R. rotatoria is 15,319 bp in
length (GenBank accession no. GQ304898) and contains
12 protein-coding genes (lacking atp8), two rRNA genes,
and as is occasionally found in some other metazoans, all
but one (trnC) of the typical 22 tRNAs genes. All genes are
encoded in the same direction in a single circular mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 1), unlike that of the monogonont
rotifer B. plicatilis, in which mitochondrial genes are
encoded in two separated circular chromosomes [43]. The
genome organization including the gene order, length of
overlapping regions between the genes and length of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/533

intergenic spacer regions is shown in Table 1. The nucleotide composition of the entire R. rotatoria mtDNA
sequence is 29.5% A, 43.7% T, 17.4% G, and 9.5% C
(Table 2). The overall A+T content (73.1%) approximates
more or less that of the acanthocephalan L. thecatus
(71.5% in A+T content), but is significantly higher than
those found in the monogonont rotifer B. plicatilis (A+T
contents of 63.9% and 62.9% for mtDNA-I and mtDNAII, respectively). The average of A+T composition of protein-coding genes (73.7%) is very similar to that of the
entire sequence, but there is noticeable compositional difference across the codon positions: the average A+T content of the third position (80.9%) is noticeably higher
than those of the first (67.8%) and second codon (72.4%)
positions, indicating that there is a strong bias toward T
(47.2%) and A (33.7%) in third codon position.
Protein-coding genes
Twelve protein-coding genes were identified using NCBI
ORF Finder and by comparing their sequence with those
of homologous genes reported from the acanthocephalan
L. thecatus [42] and monogonont B. plicatilis [43]. Even
after an exhaustive search using BLAST, we failed to discover any atp8-like protein sequence. The lack of atp8 in
the mtDNA genome is not very rare, and quite common
in most nematode and platyhelminth species reported so
far (cf. Trichinella spiralis, a nematode species where the
atp8 exists [44]).

In many metazoan mtDNAs, the codon usage is strongly
biased, especially in the third position of synonymous
codons within amino acid families [35,45-47]. In the protein-coding genes of R. rotatoria mtDNA, the higher A+T
content is related to amino acid composition with higher
abundance of A+T-rich codons. Amino acids encoded by
T-rich and A-rich codons (more than two Ts and As in a
triplet, respectively) account for 47.3% and 22.2% of the
total amino acid composition, respectively, totaling
69.5% of the entire protein sequences (Table 3). Another
factor that causes nucleotide bias is differential preference
of thymine (T) or adenine (A) in the third position of
codons. The average relative nucleotide frequency in the
third position is 47.2% (T), 33.7% (A), 13.7% (G), and
5.4% (C), respectively. Indeed, both in twofold- and fourfold-degenerate codon families, the T-ending codons are
greatly favored in most synonymous codons, whereas Cending codons are evidently avoided. The relative frequency of TTT (9.5%) coding phenylalanine is much
higher than that of its degenerate codon TTC (1.5%).
Another notable example of biased codon usage is that the
codon ATT (8.0%) is much more frequently used than
ATC (0.7%) in the isoleucine family. The propensity of a
preference for T, with an apparent bias against C may
reflect mutational bias at the third codon position as postulated in other metazoans [48]. Of 12 protein-coding

respectively (Table 1). The majority of genes end with
complete termination codon TAA (cox1, nad1, cob, nad4L,

some mismatches or incomplete configuration of the
DHU and/or TΨC arms (Additional file 1). In spite of the
exhaustive tRNA search, we were not able to identify any
candidates for trnC with high confidence. Out of 21
tRNAs found, only 10 (trnA, trnL1, trnM, trnF, trnP, trnS1,
trnS2, trnT, trnY, and trnV) display a typical cloverleaf-like
structure equipped with DHU and TΨC arms. Many other
tRNAs appear to lack a TΨC arm (6 tRNAs; trnD, trnQ,
trnE, trnG, trnH, and trnK) or a DHU arm (4 tRNAs; trnN,
trnI, trnL2, and trnW), or both (1 tRNAs; trnR). The rarity
of having a typical cloverleaf-like secondary structure was
also found in the acanthocephalan species Leptorhynchoides thecatus [42] where almost none of the inferred
tRNAs displayed a typical stem-and-loop configuration in
the DHU and TΨC arms. This differs from most other

Figure representation of the mitochondrial genome of

Circular1
Circular representation of the mitochondrial
genome of Rotaria rotatoria. All genes are encoded in the
same direction and 21 tRNA genes are denoted by the oneletter abbreviation and two leucine and two serine tRNA
genes are labeled, according to their anticodon sequence, as
L1 (trnL-uag), L2 (trnL-uaa), S1 (trnS-ucu), and S2 (trnS-uga),
respectively. The intergenic non-coding regions with notable
size (>200 bp) are denoted as NCR1-NCR5, respectively.

of 5 ntp with an anticodon) and a TΨC arm (a stem of 24 ntp with a 2-7 nt loop).
Based on sequence comparison with L. thecatus and B. plicatilis, two ribosomal RNA genes were identified: The rrnL
(529 bp) is located between trnY and trnL1 as found in L.
thecatus, but its size is remarkably smaller than any other
metazoan large ribosomal subunit molecule (mostly
larger than 1 kb) including those of other syndermatans
reported thus far (e.g., 925 bp and 1,107 bp in L. thecatus
and B. plicatilis, respectively). The rrnS (521 bp) is located
between trnM and cox2.
Non-coding regions
A total of 19 intergenic non-coding sequences, ranging
from 1 to 806 bp in size (3,092 bp in total accounting for
20.2% of entire genome length), were detected. Of these,
five intergenic non-coding regions (NCR) are prominent
by their significant lengths (≥ 200 bp), ranging from 236
bp to 806 bp (535 bp-NCR1 [between nad3 and trnT], 806
bp-NCR2 [between trnT and trnP], 760 bp-NCR3
[between trnR and trnS2], 316 bp-NCR4 [between trnS2
and trnV], and 236 bp-NCR5 [between trnV and trnS1,
respectively). Despite an exhaustive search using the NCBI
ORF Finder, we were not able to find ORF-like candidates
of significant length from these spacer regions. The relatively larger genome size of the R. rotatoria mtDNA is
attributed to the abundance of conspicuously long, unassigned spacer regions, compared to that of acanthocephalan L. thecatus (13,888 bp [42]). The region located
between trnR and trnS2 (NCR3) contains 24 tandemly
repeated units of a 18-nt sequences (5'-NRRWYBTYRNGHRRYYYY-3'), each having potential to be folded into a
stem-loop structure (a stem of 5-6 ntp with a 6-8 nt loop).
Such repeats, known as variable numbers of tandem
repeats (VNTRs), have been reported from a variety of animal mtDNAs and they have been utilized as molecular

Mitochondrial molecular phylogeny
Phylogenetic position of Platyzoa within Lophotrochozoa
The Platyzoa refers to an assemblage of some acoelomate
and pseudocoelomate animal taxa including Platyhelminthes, Rotifera, Acanthocephala, Gastrotricha, and
Gnathostomulida [51]. Phylogenetic affinity of these
groups with other lophotrochozoans has not yet been
confirmed. Results of recent molecular analyses depicted
Platyzoa as a sister to Trochozoa (morphology+SSU dataset [21]), or as a derived subclade of Lophotrochozoa
(LSU+SSU dataset [23]. This disagreement still awaits
unambiguous resolution. In this study, we performed
phylogenetic analyses for the amino acid dataset of major
representatives of Bilateria with two cnidarian sequences
(Aurelia aurita and Acropora tenuis) as outgroups. Resulting
trees from both ML and BI methods showed that the protostomes and deuterostomes were divided into two separate clades with very high support (Fig. 2). Within the
protostome clade, monophyly of Ecdysozoa and monophyly of Lophotrochozoa were also found, but the dichotomy between these two groups was collapsed when the
nematode sequences (Caenorhabditis elegans, Trichinella
spiralis) were included in the analysis. In all cases, nematode sequences were nested within the Lophotrochozoan
clade rather than grouped with ecdysozoan members
(Additional file 2), and their position varied considerably
according to different phylogenetic methods. Their unusual position appears to be artificial and due to the longbranch attraction (LBA) problem as documented in many
previous papers [52-54]. Therefore, in order to reduce this
factor in the tree reconstruction, we excluded nematode

sequences from subsequent analyses. After the exclusion
of nematodes, the concatenated amino acid sequence
dataset consisting of 1,556 homologous positions was
used for the subsequent analyses. Note that monophyly of
Lophotrochozoa and monophyly of Ecdysozoa were
recovered after removal of nematode sequences from the
analyses, and support values for clades were noticeably
improved in all analyses (see table description of Additional file 3 for the phylogenetic position of Chaetognatha within the metozoa). The monophyletic grouping
of ecdysozoan members received 100% BP (bootstrap
percentage) in ML, and 1.00 BPP (Bayesian posterior
probability). The Lophotrochozoan clade was also well
supported with 1.00 BPP in BI, but received a very weak
bootstrap support value of 56% in ML analysis (Fig. 2).
Although the Lophotrochozoan clade is not strongly supported, the current amino acid sequence data support the
Ecdysozoa/Lophotrochozoa split. It is particularly noteworthy that both phylogenetic methods (BI and ML)
recovered Platyhelminthes, Rotifera, and Acanthocephala
(all platyzoan members included in this study) as monophyletic lineages in the Lophotrochozoan clade and nodal
support for Platyzoa was very strong (100% in both BI
and ML analysis). This result is in agreement with an earlier analysis based on a combined dataset of LSU and SSU
sequences that recognized the Platyzoa as a derived
monophyletic assemblage within the Lophotrochozoa
[23]. As yet, the availability of complete mitochondrial
genome information is limited to Platyhelminthes, Acanthocephala, and Rotifera, and further evidence from Gnathostomulida and Gastrotricha is required to confirm the
monophyly of Platyzoa and its derived position within
the Lophotrochozon clade (sensu [51]).

Phylogenetic implications for Syndermata: Eurotatoria paraphyly
Phylogenetic relationships among Syndermata, in particular with regard to Eurotatoria monophyly/paraphyly are
still vigorously debated. The answer to this question is
prerequisite for correct understanding of the evolution of
different types of life styles found among major groups of
Syndermata [27]. In this study, we revisited this issue
based on phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequence
for eleven protein-coding genes (except atp6 and atp8) of
the complete mitochondrial genome. The resulting trees
both from Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses
recovered syndermatan members (Monogononta, Bdelloidea, and Acanthocephala) as a monophyletic group,
which is in turn grouped with Platyhelminthes (Fig. 2).
The phylogenetic affinity of the Syndermata with Platyhelminthes in this study is concordant with some earlier
publications asserting their sister-relationship [23,55]. It
is particularly significant to note that both BI and ML
methods placed Bdelloidea and Acanthocephala as sister
taxa and this relationship was very strongly supported by
1.00 BPP in BI analysis, but received relatively weaker support (65% BP) in ML analysis. Moreover, none of the phylogenetic methods recovered the two eurotatorian species,
Rotaria rotatoria (Bdelloidea) and Brachionus plicatilis
(Monogononta) as monophyletic, but instead always
depicted them as a paraphyletic assemblage. Bdelloidea
represented by R. rotatoria appears to share most recent
common ancestry with Acanthocephala rather than with
the monogonont B. plicatilis. The sister-group position of
the Monogononta to the Bdelloidea+Acanthocephala,
received strong support from BI (0.99 BPP) and moderate
support from ML (70% BP), respectively. This result indicates a firm support for the 'Eurotatorian paraphyly'
hypothesis. In all cases of the analysis, monophyly of
Bdelloidea + Acanthocephala relative to Monogononta is
always very robust. In order to assess whether our data
rejects the alternative hypothesis (Eurotatoria monophyly), we performed statistical comparison of the likelihood scores for the best ML tree without constraint versus
the best tree with the topological constraint of Eurotatoria
monophyly using theTreefinder program. The result of
topology test failed to detect a significant difference
between these two competing hypotheses under various
criteria (ELW, SH and AU; Table 4). Although Eurotatoria
monophyly was not significantly worse interpretation of
these data by tree topology comparison test, the optimal

phylogenetic trees from different methods unanimously
depicted B. plicatilis (Monogononta) sister to two other
syndermatans (bdelloidean R. rotatoria and acanthocephalan L. thecatus), regardless of different options
applied in the data analysis (including or excluding
inferred gaps in the analysis). In addition, this relation
(Eurotatoria paraphyly) is further corroborated by sharing
greater similarity in gene arrangement between R. rotatoria
and L. thecatus (next section).
A close relationship between Bdelloidea and Acanthocephala is also evident when gene arrangement patterns of R. rotatoria mtDNA are compared with other
metazoan animal groups. Gene arrangement of R. rotatoria mtDNA is very different from those found in other
metazoans, but shows the highest similarity to the acanthocephalan L. thecatus. The gene order comparison
between R. rotatoria and L. thecatus identified the gene
order of trnN-nad2-cox1-trnG, trnY-rrnL-trnL1-nad6, and
nad4L-nad4-trnH-nad5 shared between the representatives
of the Bdelloidea and Acanthocephala, respectively (Fig.
3). The gene order of nad4L-nad4-trnH-nad5 can also be
found across many various metazoan mtDNAs, such as
Bryozoa [56], Brachiura (Arthropoda [57]), Gastropoda
(Mollusca [58]), Vertebrata (Teleostei [59] and Amphibia
[60]), and Priapulida [54]. However, this conserved gene
order is not shared by the B. plicatilis mtDNA and we suggest it is due to the idiosyncratic features of B. plicatilis
mtDNA in which 36 genes are encoded separately into
bipartite mitochondrial genomes [43]. In contrast, note
that the gene order similarity found between R. rotatoria
and L. thecatus (trnN-nad2-cox1-trnG and trnY-rrnL-trnL1nad6) is very unique among the metazoans and this
shared gene rearrangement lends another line of strong
support for their common ancestry. The phylogenetic conclusion of Eurotatoria paraphyly suggested from the
present study is also consistent with the most recent EST
based phylogenomic analysis [27].
In general, the evolutionary potential for adaptive radiation and its subsequent diversification of extant biota are
often associated with preferential adoption of different
life styles during evolutionary history. In most cases, a
robust phylogeny is a prerequisite to correctly understand
the evolution of life styles among the groups. The Syndermata (Rotifera+Acanthocephala) is one of the best model
systems for studying the evolutionary origin and persistence of different life styles because it shows a variety of
lineage-specific reproduction modes. Of these, Bdelloidea
is particularly among the most unique in that it contains
exclusively several hundred species and all individuals are
females, the largest metazoan group with no sexual reproduction that has ever been documented [9]. This group is
also considered to represent an ancient origin of asexuality with a great evolutionary success in their diversifica-

tion of asexual species [9,10]. There are some additional
cytological [61] and molecular evidence [62] suggesting
that the evolution and maintenance of asexuality in Bdelloidea is of relatively ancient origin, dating back to more
than tens of millions of years ago. Inferring the history of
the obligatory asexual class Bdelloidea within the syndermatan phylogenetic framework is a central topic in evolutionary biology of asexuality because these organisms
have long been regarded as perfect candidates to test the
advantage of sexual reproduction [63]. The phylogenetic
conclusion obtained from this comparative mitochondrial genome study provides essential clues in extrapolating the directionality of long-term asexual evolution of
bdelloidean lineage. The sister group position of
Monogononta to the Bdelloidea/Acanthocephala clade
suggests that the obligatory asexuality of bdelloideans
may have been derived secondarily from some other preexisting condition in earlier lineage of rotifers. However,
because no mitochondrial genome information is available from Seisonidea, we are not able to postulate what is
the most likely ancestral condition that gave rise to bdelloidean asexuality. There are only a few complete mitochondrial DNA sequences available from the Syndermata:
B. plicatilis (Monogononta [43]), R. rotatoria (Bdelloidea;
this study) and L. thecatus (Acanthocephala [42]). More
information, especially from Seisonidea needs to be
obtained to confirm the phylogenetic position of Seisonidea within Syndermata. This further phylolgenetic information would be a very substantial ingredient for
precisely estimating the origin of asexuality in Bdelloidea

and at the same time, contribute to a better understanding
of mitochondrial genome evolution within the syndermatan phylogenetic framework.

Conclusion
In this study, we revisited phylogenetic relationships of
Eurotatoria (monophyly versus paraphyly) based on comparative analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome
information for major groups of the Syndermata. For this
purpose, we determined the first complete mitochondrial
genome sequence (15,319 bp) of a bdelloid rotifer,
Rotaria rotatoria. Comparisons of inferred amino acid
sequence and gene arrangement pattern with those of
other syndermatan mtDNAs (from the acanthocephalan
L. thecatus and monogonont B. plicatilis) supports the
hypothesis that the Bdelloidea shares a most recent common ancestor with Acanthocephala, and not with
Monogononta. From this finding, we suggest that the
obligatory asexuality of bdelloideans may have secondarily derived from some preexisting condition in earlier lineages of rotifers. Definitively, testing this question of
phylogenetic relationships and evolution of different
types of life style among the major members of Syndermata awaits further investigation of mitochondrial
genome sequencing from Seisonidea.

Methods
Sampling and molecular techniques
Rotifers were collected from a small pond at Inha University campus in South Korea (37°26'58.08"N,

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:533

126°39'20.09"E) and washed several times with distilled
water. Total genomic DNA was extracted from pooled
worms using a QIAamp tissue kit (QIAGEN Inc.) and used
as a template for PCR amplification. Four small fragments
of Rotaria rotatoria mtDNA (ranging in size from ~296 to
712 bp) were initially PCR-amplified using corresponding
primer sets for each of four gene regions (cox1 [LCO1490/
HCO2198], lrRNA [16SA/16SB], cob [Cytb-Uni5-2/CytbUni3-2], and cox2 [CO2-Uni5/CO2-Uni3]; see Table 5).
PCR reactions were conducted in a total volume of 50 μl
reaction mixture containing 0.13 μg/μl of genomic DNA,
10× PCR buffer, 10 mM dNTP mixture, 10 pmole each
primer, 25 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 units Taq polymerase
(Roche Co.) using the following cycling conditions: 1
cycle (92°C for 2 min), 35 cycles (92°C for 1 min, 45°C
to 55°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min 30 sec), and 1 cycle
(72°C for 10 min). The nucleotide sequence determined
from these four fragments was then used to design R. rotatoria mtDNA-specific primers for long PCR amplification
(see also Table 5 for details of the primer information).
Four overlapping fragments (ranging in size from 1,559
bp to 5,481 bp) covering the entire mitochondrial
genome of R. rotatoria were amplified using the Expand
Long Template PCR System (Roche, USA) under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 2 min at 94°C (initial denaturation), 35 cycles of denaturation-primer annealingelongation (10s at 95°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 10 min at
68°C), and 1 cycle of the final extension (10 min at
68°C). A negative control (no template) was included for
every PCR run to detect any potential contamination of
the PCR products. The amplified PCR products were isolated on a 1.0% agarose gel containing crystal violet,
excised and extracted according to the TOPO XL gel-purifying protocol (Invitrogen Co.). Purified DNAs were
cloned into E. coli competent cells using TOPO XL PCR
Cloning kit, as recommended by manufacturer. Sequenc-

ing reactions of the target fragments were performed in
both directions by 'primer walking' using a Big Dye Terminator Cycle-Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), and
overlapping fragments were assembled to complete the
sequence of the entire genome.
Gene Annotation
Twelve protein-coding genes and two ribosomal RNA
genes of R. rotatoria were identified by sequence comparison with the mtDNA sequences of the acanthocephalan L.
thecatus and monogonont rotifer B. plicatilis and by using
the NCBI ORF (open reading frame) Finder. We
attempted to find tRNAs using tRNAscan-SE 1.21, but no
tRNA-like structure was detected from this search. Therefore, tRNA genes were identified by searching for anticodon consensus motif sequences (TxxxR; xxx = anticodon)
and by recognizing potential secondary structures by eye.
In this process, we were aided by a web-based automatic
annotation program for organellar genomes (DOGMA
[64]).
Phylogenetic analysis
Eleven mitochondrial protein-coding genes (except atp6
and atp8, which are highly variable in their lengths among
the groups) from 35 species (6 ecdysozoans, 22 lophotrochozoans, 5 deuterostomes, and two cnidarian outgroups) representing major clades of the Bilateria,
including those of R. rotatoria mtDNA, were used in phylogenetic analysis (see Additional file 3 for details of taxon
sampling). A multiple alignment of the amino acid
sequences for each protein-coding gene was performed
using ClustalX [65] with default options. Implementation
of ClustalX for multiple sequence alignment does not
always guarantee an unambiguous result due to the length
and sequence variation among the species. This becomes
more problematic when taxon sampling includes a wide

range of animal taxa that evolve at very different rates. To
improve reliability, we selected conserved blocks from
aligned amino acid sequences for each of protein-coding
genes using the Gblocks program [66] and a concatenated
dataset was then prepared for the subsequent phylogenetic analyses. To reconstruct mitochondrial gene phylogeny, maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference
(BI) were conducted for the concatenated amino acid
sequence dataset. For ML analysis, the best-fit model of
our amino acid sequence datasets was estimated using the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) using ProtTest version 2.0 [67]. Maximum likelihood analysis was performed in Treefinder October version [68] using the MtArt
matrix [69], which was selected as the best-fit model of
amino acid substitution from ProtTest. Nodal support of
the resulting ML trees was estimated by nonparametric
bootstrap analysis with 500 random replications using
Treefinder. We compared the likelihood scores of the
competing hypotheses (the best tree versus alternative
hypothesis) using various criteria (Expected-Likelihood
Weight, ELW [70]; Shimodaira-Hasegawa [71]; Approximately Unbiased, AU [72] tests) implemented in Treefinder. The current version of the MrBayes program does
not include the MtArt model of protein sequence, and
thus we used the MtRev model with the likelihood parameter setting to "ngammacat = 4", "rates = invgamma" as an
alternative best-fit model for Bayesian analysis. The analysis was run for 106 generations, sampled every 100 generations with four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
chains using MrBayes 3.1.2 [73]. Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) values were estimated after the initial 200
saved trees (the first 2 × 105 generations) were discarded
as burn-in. We also conducted maximum parsimony

Phylogenetic tree inferred from Bayesian analysis for metazoan mitochondrial amino acid sequences before the exclusion of nematode species from the analysis. Numbers above/below branches are Bayesian
posterior probability (BPP) and local rearrangement-expected likelihood
weight (LR-ELW) edge support estimated from Bayesian and maximum
likelihood analyses, respectively (BPP/LR-ELW). The branches that are
supported with values of 50% or not consistent between Bayesian and
maximum likelihood methods in their positions are represented by "-".

Additional file 3
Taxa/species used for phylogenetic analysis in this study. The Chaetognatha was traditionally considered a member of deuterostomes, but recent
molecular analysis using SSU rDNA sequence suggested that they are not
deuterostomes [77,78]. Although phylogenetic position of Chaetognatha
with other metazoan phyla still remained enigmatic, recent molecular
phylogenetic surveys including comparative analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome often suggest its affinity to protostomes (for more
details, see [21,79-81]). Therefore, we tentatively included two chaetognath species (Spadella cephaloptera and Paraspadella gotoi) in the
Protostome clade for phylogenetic analysis.
