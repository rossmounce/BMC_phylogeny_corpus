Abstract
Background: Salt stress hinders the growth of plants and reduces crop production worldwide. However, different
plant species might possess different adaptive mechanisms to mitigate salt stress. We conducted a detailed
pathway analysis of transcriptional dynamics in the roots of Medicago truncatula seedlings under salt stress and
selected a transcription factor gene, MtCBF4, for experimental validation.
Results: A microarray experiment was conducted using root samples collected 6, 24, and 48 h after application of
180 mM NaCl. Analysis of 11 statistically significant expression profiles revealed different behaviors between primary
and secondary metabolism pathways in response to external stress. Secondary metabolism that helps to maintain
osmotic balance was induced. One of the highly induced transcription factor genes was successfully cloned, and
was named MtCBF4. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MtCBF4, which belongs to the AP2-EREBP transcription
factor family, is a novel member of the CBF transcription factor in M. truncatula. MtCBF4 is shown to be a nuclearlocalized protein. Expression of MtCBF4 in M. truncatula was induced by most of the abiotic stresses, including salt,
drought, cold, and abscisic acid, suggesting crosstalk between these abiotic stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing MtCBF4 enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stress, and activated expression of downstream genes
that contain DRE elements. Over-expression of MtCBF4 in M. truncatula also enhanced salt tolerance and induced
expression level of corresponding downstream genes.
Conclusion: Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis revealed complex mechanisms exist in plants in response to
salt stress. The novel transcription factor gene MtCBF4 identified here played an important role in response to
abiotic stresses, indicating that it might be a good candidate gene for genetic improvement to produce stresstolerant plants.

Background
Salt stress has a major effect on food production and
quality worldwide by limiting the growth, development,
and yield of crops [1]. More than one-fifth of the
world’s arable land is now under the threat of salt stress.
As the global population increases, water resource management is deteriorating and environmental pollution is
worsening; salinization of land is becoming more

extreme and has begun to hinder development of agricultural economics.
Salt stress can damage plants by several mechanisms,
including water deficit, ion toxicity, nutrient imbalance,
and oxidative stress [2]. Plants respond and adapt to salt
stress through a series of biochemical and physiological
changes, involving expression and coordination of many
genes [3,4]. Gene expression in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in response to salt and other abiotic
stresses has been studied extensively [5,6]. However,
conclusions derived from research conducted on Arabidopsis may not be applicable to other species, so
research on species-specific responses to a particular

abiotic stress is needed. Fabaceae is the third-largest
family of flowering plants in the world, and contains
many important crops that provide humans and animals
with proteins [7]. Legumes are also important sources of
edible oil and industrial fuel. Medicago truncatula is
used as a model legume plant because of features such
as a relatively small genome, self-pollination, a short life
cycle, and the ability to form root nodules in association
with rhizobia [8,9].
High-throughput expression profiling, such as microarray technology, has been used widely to study abioticstress-responsive mechanisms in plants. Transcriptional
profiling of chickpea using a cDNA microarray revealed
that 109, 210, and 386 genes were differentially regulated
after drought, cold, and high-salinity treatment, respectively [10]. The iron-stress response of two near-isogenic
soybean (Glycine max) lines was monitored using the
Affymetrix GeneChip Soybean Genome Array, which
indicated a transcription factor mutation appears to
cause iron use inefficiency in soybeans [11]. Many genes
of transgenic Arabidopsis over-expressing pea ABR17
(abscisic acid-responsive protein) exhibited different
expression patterns under salt stress compared to the
wild type, based on a 70-mer oligonucleotide probe
microarray, indicating that ABR17 plays a role in mediating stress tolerance [12]. Another salt-stress response
study of the root apex of M. truncatula using the Mt16K
+ microarray identified 84 transcription factors exhibiting
significant expression changes; some of these transcription factors belong to the AP2/EREBP and MYB transcription factor family [13]. Based on microarray analysis,
genes involved in abiotic stress responses have been identified and categorized into two types according to the
protein they code for [14]. The first type of genes
expressed functional proteins, such as water-channel protein and membrane transporter protein; the second type
was involved in signal transduction and expression regulatory processes, such as transcription factors and kinases
[4]. Transcription factors could bind to the cis-elements
of many target genes and regulate their expression, so
these are good candidates for transgenic research to
improve salt resistance among crops [5,15].
The AP2/EREBP family, which comprises a large group
of transcription factors, plays functionally important
roles in plant growth and development, especially in
hormonal regulation and response to biotic and abiotic
stress [16]. In Arabidopsis, 145 AP2/EREBP transcription
factors were classified into five subfamilies, including
DREB/CBF (dehydration-responsive element-binding
protein/C-repeat binding factor), ERF (ethylene-responsive transcription factor), AP2 (APETALA 2), RAV
(related to ABI3/VP1), and one specific gene, AL079349,
based on similarities in their DNA-binding domain (AP2/
ERF domain) [17]. The Arabidopsis genome contains six

Page 2 of 19

DREB1/CBF and eight DREB2 genes [18]. DREB1A/
CBF3, DREB1B/CBF1, and DREB1C/CBF2 appear to be
rapidly and transiently induced by cold; they are major
transcription factors required for the expression of coldinducible genes [19]. DREB2A and DREB2B genes are
induced by dehydration and high salinity but not by cold
stress, and they play very important roles in the osmotic
stress response [19,20]. Expression of DREB1D/CBF4 is
up-regulated by abscisic acid (ABA), drought, salt, and
cold stress [18,21,22]. AtDREB1E/DDF2 (DWARF AND
DELAYED FLOWERING 2) and AtDREB1F/DDF1,
encoding another two AP2 transcription factors of the
DREB1/CBF subfamily, are induced by high-salinity
stress [23]. Over-expression of the AtDREB1F/DDF1
gene causes dwarfism and higher tolerance to salt stress,
mainly by reducing levels of bioactive gibberellins (GA)
in transgenic Arabidopsis [24]. Transgenic plants overexpressing AtDREB1E/DDF2 share a similar phenotype
[24]. DREB2C, another member of the DREB2 transcription factor family, is induced by salt and cold, and transgenic plants over-expressing DREB2C become ABA
hypersensitive [25]. The signal-transduction pathways in
response to abiotic stress are complex, and the exact
mechanisms require further study.
Recent research has isolated many DREB transcription
factors from soybean, an important Fabaceae member,
including GmDREBa, GmDREBb, GmDREBc, GmDREB1,
GmDREB2, and GmDREB3. Expression of GmDREBa
and GmDREBb is induced by salt, drought, and cold
stress in the leaves of seedlings. By contrast, transcription
levels of GmDREBc are apparently induced in roots by
salt, drought, and ABA treatments, but are not significantly affected in leaves [26]. These results indicate that
these three genes function differently in response to abiotic stresses in soybean. GmDREB2 is induced by cold,
salt, drought stress, and ABA treatment, conferring tolerance to drought and high-salinity stress in transgenic
plants [27]. In contrast, GmDREB3 is induced by cold
stress only, and transgenic Arabidopsis are more tolerant
to freezing, salt, and drought stress [28].
MtCBF1, MtCBF2, MtDREB1C/CBF3, and MtDREB2A
have been identified in M. truncatula. The expression
levels of MtCBF2 and MtCBF3 increased during treatment
at 8°C and 6°C [29]. Over-expression of MtCBF3/DREB1C
suppressed shoot growth and enhanced the freezing tolerance of transgenic M. truncatula [30]. This finding indicates that MtCBF2 and MtCBF3/DREB1C may play
a critical role in inducing the COLD-ACCLIMATIONSPECIFIC (CAS) gene, which in turn increases freezing
tolerance. In contrast, transcription levels of MtDREB2A
are significantly up-regulated in roots by salt and drought
stress treatments. Transgenic M. truncatulaMtDREB2a (a
constitutively active form of MtDREB2A) plants exhibit
significantly dwarfed seedlings [28], but the stress

tolerance of transgenic lines requires further study. Moreover, the relationships among the MtDREB/CBFs genes
are still unknown.
Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation of
roots as well as transient transfection by vacuum infiltration of intact leaves is widely used in function analysis in legumes [31-33]. The transient transformation
methods are faster and easier compared with the stable
transformation technique.
In previous research, we constructed an expression
database for M. truncatula under salt stress [34]. In this
study, we implemented a more detailed pathway analysis
of transcriptomics dynamics. In addition, we identified a
novel transcription factor gene, MtCBF4, which was
induced by salt, drought, cold, and abscisic acid. Overexpression of MtCBF4 in transgenic Arabidopsis and M.
truncatula improved tolerance to abiotic stress and activated expression of downstream genes containing DRE
elements, indicating that MtCBF4 might be a good candidate gene for improving the stress tolerance of transgenic plants.

Results
Root length measurement, selection of time-points and
salt concentration

We evaluated the root growth status of M. truncatula
by measuring root lengths under different salt stress

Page 3 of 19

intensities at different time-points. Measurements were
recorded at 12:00 pm every day for 1 week. Raw data
for root length, calculated average length, growth rate
and standard error values are presented in Additional
file 1. The percentage increase in root length per day
under different salt concentrations was calculated as a
measure of growth rate (Figure 1). Roots treated with
distilled water were used as the control (CK sample).
The difference between a root growth rate and the value
one day prior was tested using Student’s t-test.
The growth rate of roots subjected to 180 mM NaCl
stress was significantly different (p-value ≤ 0.05) after
one day of treatment in contrast to other salt concentrations. Subsequently, roots treated with 60 mM and 120
mM NaCl also showed significantly different growth
rates (Additional file 1, t-test based on NaCl concentration table). According to the t-test results, NaCl concentrations could be divided into three groups: 60~110 mM
120~160 mM, and 180~200 mM, corresponding to low,
intermediate and high levels of salt stress, respectively.
In order to induce a higher frequency of expression
changes and maintain seedling activity simultaneously,
as some seedlings under a high level of salt stress ceased
growth from the third day of stress treatment, we chose
180 mM NaCl and selected days 1 and 2 as time-points
to investigate the effects of a high level of salt stress on
M. truncatula seedlings. In addition, 6 h post-treatment

percentage increase in root length over the seven-day treatment period. The raw data is available in Additional file 1.

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:109

was added as a time-point to examine the early stages of
the stress response. The I50 value is defined as the concentration of NaCl that reduces the rate of root growth
by 50% relative to a control; this value was used to measure the salt tolerance level. The I50 of Arabidopsis is
about 100 mM NaCl [35]. Our salt concentration gradient tests revealed that the I50 of M. truncatula Jemalong
A17 was also about 100 mM based on root lengths measured after one day of salt stress (Additional file 1, I50
estimation table), which indicated the salt sensitivity of
M. truncatula.
Quantitative real-time PCR validation of microarray
experiments

Microarray experiment design and related protocols
were described in our previous work [34]. To validate
the microarray results, five probe sets were selected to
confirm expression differences with quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR): a MYB transcription factor
(Mtr.15010.1.S1_S_at), a 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase family
protein (Mtr.40379.1.S1_at), a delta l-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (Mtr.42902.1.S1_s_at), an AP2EREBP transcription factor (Mtr.38878.1.S1_at), and a
dehydrin-like protein (Mtr.8651.1.S1_at). Selection of
these probe sets was based on their statistically significant up-regulated expression and abundant annotations.
2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase is reported to be involved in
plant defense [36], and l-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase plays a role in the drought stress response [37].
Several dehydrin-like proteins show diverse accumulation in many plants in response to cold and heat stress
[38]. Many members of the transcription factor family
AP2-EREBP and MYB are reported to be involved in
abiotic stress responses [39-41]. The qRT-PCR method
is much more sensitive than microarray analysis for
detecting transcript expression and can be used as a
confirmatory tool for microarray results [42,43].
Although the quantitative values differed considerably,
the same trend was observed in the qRT-PCR and
microarray analyses (Additional file 2). The primers
used are listed in Additional file 3 (Table S1), and
MtActin [33] was used as a control.
Gene expression profiles and pathway enrichment
analysis

We analyzed expression data for 50,900 M. truncatula
probe sets at the three time-points using STEM software
[44] to cluster the expression patterns. A total of 11 significant expression profiles were generated based on a
p-value of 0.05. Based on the expression patterns, profiles were classified into two categories (Figure 2): those
with an up-regulated pattern, including profile b, d, e, f
and k, assigned with 1,189, 1,265, 775, 650, and 323
probe sets, respectively (Figure 2a); and those with a

pathways (a to k) are categorized into two groups: (a) up-regulated
profiles (b) down-regulated profiles. Numbers of probe sets assigned

software).

down-regulated pattern, including profile a, c, g, h, i,
and j assigned with 1,773, 1,149, 650, 541, 371, and 396
probe sets, respectively (Figure 2b). Probe sets belonging
to each profile were subjected to an enrichment analysis
at the pathway level using the PathExpress tool [45,46],
and significant pathway distributions for each profile
were shown (Table 1). Probe sets related to primary
metabolism (such as glycolysis, carbon fixation, starch,
and sucrose metabolism) were mainly repressed in
response to salt stress. Of all the probe sets that might
be involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway,
half of the probe sets had been up-regulated. The flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was suppressed, as more than
half of the probe sets involved in this pathway were
down-regulated. However, the six probe sets involved
in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway were all upregulated: two isoflavone 7-O-methyltransferases
(Mtr.37751.1.S1_at and Mtr.16873.1.S1_s_at) in profile
b; an isoflavone 7-O-methyltransferase (Mtr.49862.1.
S1_at) and an isoflavone 3’-hydroxylase (Mtr.12632.1.
S1_at) in profile d; and two isoflavone reductases
(Mtr.30508.1.S1_at and Mtr.410.1.S1_s_at) in profile e.
We utilized the GeneBins tool [47] for additional
pathway analyses, because probe sets of M. truncatula
were more annotated by GeneBins than PathExpress.
We selected probe sets that were up- or down-regulated
by more than two-fold at each time-point versus values
at 0 h for GeneBins analysis and to assess their distribution on the STEM-generated profiles. Additional file 4
summarizes these probe sets and their corresponding
profiles, along with the GeneBins functional annotation.
Those probe sets were also functionally categorized
using the GeneBins second-level ontology. Almost all
probe sets belonging to profiles a, c, g, h, i, and j were
classified as down-regulated, and almost all probe sets
belonging to profiles b, d, e, f, and k were up-regulated.
Unclassified (i.e., not annotated by GeneBins ontology)
probe sets were not subjected to the analysis described

Pathway enrichment analysis was done by PathExpress tool. Only statistic significant (p-value < = 0.05) pathways left. Profiles numbered from a to k were listed
in Figure 2. The “No. of Enzymes” column means how many enzymes of each pathway are in the array, the “No. of Enzymes submitted” column means how
many enzymes belong to each profile.

below. Profile a displayed a continuing downward trend.
Most probe sets in this profile were classified into the
main metabolism category, and the number of probe
sets increased with longer exposure to salt. This result
might be caused by the inhibition of plant growth by
salt stress, which causes water potential, osmotic, and
nutritional imbalances [48]. Other subcategories of profile a contained a considerable proportion of probe sets
including genes for translation, folding and sorting,
degradation, and signal transduction. The translation
process was repressed as probe sets assigned to this
category were more down-regulated; this indicated that
growth activity in seedlings was constrained by external
stress at the translational level. The up-regulated profiles
b, d, e, f, and k not only contained a considerable proportion of probe sets involved in primary metabolism
processes (carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism), but also in secondary metabolism and information
processes. The pathways metabolism of cofactors and
vitamins, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biodegradation of xenobiotics all showed considerably more
probe sets that were up-regulated than down-regulated.
This indicates that the plants have a positive response
mechanism against external harmful stress.
A novel member of CBF transcription factor in M.
truncatula

We used probe consensus sequences of the array for a
BLASTX search against the M. truncatula transcription
factor (TF) peptide sequences database, and found 2138
probes that matched (i.e., showed sequence homology)
the 1022 TFs obtained from PlantTFDB [49], excluding
the probe sets of M. sativa and Sinorhizobium meliloti.
The 2138 TFs were isolated for further cluster analysis
using the MeV tool [50] based on their gene expression
regulation and signal transduction role [15]. In the reclustered results by expression profiles of the 2138 TFs

(Additional file 5), eight TFs in one of the profiles that
exhibited an up-regulating trend were selected for further
analysis (Figure 3 and Additional file 5, indicated by star).
Of the eight TFs, the probe set Mtr.38878.1.S1_at
belonged to the AP2/EREBP transcription factor family
and shares the most similarities with the CRT/DRE binging factor (CBF) as indicated by a BLAST search against
the NCBI nr database. Seven other transcription factors
belonged to the MYB, NAC, C3H, and C2H2 families.
With the exception of the C3H family, members of these
families are reportedly capable of abiotic stress responses
[51-53]. As CBF TFs are reported to participate in many
abiotic stress responses, Mtr.38878.1.S1_at was further
chosen for function validation. We named this novel
member of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor gene
MtCBF4, because previous studies have identified and
analyzed MtCBF1, MtCBF2, and MtCBF3 [29]. MtCBF4
contained an open reading frame of 618-bp, encoding a
protein of 205 amino acids, with a predicted molecular
mass of 23.1 kD and a pI of 5.1. The 618-bp sequence
was submitted to GenBank (accession no. HQ110079.1).
To date, four CBF genes of Medicago have been isolated
(including MtCBF4), and two of these (MtCBF2 and
MtCBF3) have been proven to play roles in the response
to cold stress [29]. However, the relationships among
them are still unknown.
To examine the phylogenetic relationship of the DREB/
CBF family, we compared the amino acid sequence of
MtCBF4 with 22 DREB/CBF family members from Arabidopsis, Glycine max, and Medicago truncatula (Additional file 6). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that
DREB/CBF proteins were grouped by species, and all
the CBFs were clustered together according to DREB
type. DREB1-type CBFs were clustered together.
MtCBF4 was most similar to GmCBF2 and GmCBF1,
and in turn to MtCBF3 and MtCBF2. MtCBF4 showed
higher similarity to AtDREB1/CBFs than to AtDREB2,

known CBF homologs, located downstream of the
DSAWR) [54,55] as well as the C-terminal LWSY motif
[56] were also conserved in the MtCBF4 protein. The
MtCBF4 protein contains DSAWK instead of DSAWR.
As mentioned above, the amino acid sequence of the
MtCBF4 protein shared 57% similarity with the Arabidopsis CBF4 protein (AtDREB1D/CBF4), indicating
MtCBF4 is a homolog of AtDREB1D/CBF4.
We also checked the promoter sequence (1000 bp
upstream from the translation start site) of MtCBF4
using the PLACE Signal Scan Search Program [57]. The
promoter sequence contained many putative stressresponsive cis-elements such as ABRE (the core
sequence of ABRE), and recognition sites for MYB,
MYC and WRKY transcription factors (Additional file
7). These cis-elements (ABRE, MYBRS and MYCRS)
and the corresponding transcription factors (AREB/ARF,
MYB and MYC transcription factors) play important
roles in the ABA signaling pathway and abiotic stress
responses [15,58]. WRKY transcription factors are suggested to be involved in response and adaptation to
abiotic and/or biotic stresses [59,60].

therefore it was classified as a DREB1-type CBF. The
amino acid sequence of MtCBF4 shared 57% (E-value =
1e -46 ) sequence identity against AtCBF4, which was
higher than the identities between MtCBF4 and AtCBF1
(53%, E-value = 2e-42), AtCBF2 (53%, E-value = 1e-43)
and AtCBF3 (53%, E-value = 6e-47), respectively.
We also compared the amino acid sequence of
MtCBF4 with several DREB-1 related proteins. As
shown in Figure 4, MtCBF4 protein had a conserved
AP2 DNA-binding domain similar to other CBF proteins. The CBF signature sequences (PKK/RPAGRxKFxETRHP and DSAWR, located immediately before and
after the AP2 domain, respectively; A(A/V)xxA(A/V)

To determine its subcellular localization, MtCBF4 was
fused in frame to the 5’ terminus of the green fluorescent
protein (GFP) reporter gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus dual 35S promoter (CaMV 35S), as
well as a tobacco etch virus (TEV) enhancer. The recombinant constructs of the MtCBF4-GFP fusion gene and
GFP alone were introduced into onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells via a gene gun (Bio-Rad, California, USA).
The MtCBF4-GFP fusion protein accumulated mainly in
the nucleus, whereas GFP alone was present throughout
the whole cell (Figure 5a-d). Thus, MtCBF4 was a
nuclear-localized protein, which was consistent with its
predicted function as a transcription factor.
The transactivation ability of MtCBF4 was analyzed
using a yeast assay system. The GAL4 DNA-binding
domain-MtCBF4 recombinant plasmid was transformed
into yeast cells and assayed for its ability to activate
transcription of the dual report genes His3 and LacZ
both controlled by the GAL4 upstream activation
sequence. Yeast cells with the fusion plasmids harboring
MtCBF4 grew on SD medium lacking histidine, and
were stained blue in X-Gal solution (Figure 5e). These
results indicated that MtCBF4 showed transactivation
capability.
Expression pattern of MtCBF4 under different abiotic
stresses

We conducted a qRT-PCR to examine the expression
pattern of MtCBF4 under different stress conditions. At

half of the sequences; residues highlighted in gray share similar chemical properties. Amino acid positions and consensus sequences are shown
at the top of each panel. The conserved AP2 DNA-binding domain is indicated as the underlined segment. Stars and triangles indicate the CBF
signature sequences; squares indicate the LWSY domain; circles indicate the conserved motif among CBF homologs.

1 h after ABA treatment, the transcript level of MtCBF4
had increased almost six-fold; thereafter, it decreased to
the pretreatment level after 24 h (Figure 6a). Under
drought stress, the transcription level of MtCBF4 began
to increase within 1 h and continued to increase after 3 h
(Figure 6b). With regard to salt stress, the transcription
level of MtCBF4 began to increase at 6 h and continued
to increase after 48 h (Figure 6c). Treatment with cold
stress yielded very interesting results; the transcription
level of MtCBF4 rose sharply within 1 h after treatment
compared to that of the non-treated control, then fell
sharply but remained above the pretreatment level at 6 h,
and then rose again to a much higher level at 24 h (Figure 6d). Taken together, these results reveal that MtCBF4
was induced by ABA, drought, salt, and cold stimulation,
indicating that it might play an important role in
response to abiotic stresses and ABA treatment.

Over-expression of MtCBF4 improved drought and highsalinity tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis

The notable induction of MtCBF4 expression by multiple stresses indicated this gene might be involved in
stress resistance. Expression of MtCBF4 in transgenic
Arabidopsis was detected by RT-PCR (Figure 7a). We
randomly selected two independent T3 MtCBF4 overexpressing lines (L17 and L24) for drought and salinity
resistance testing. Over-expression of MtCBF4 in both
lines did not cause significant growth retardation compared with the wild type as indicated by inflorescence
height and seed yield per plant (Additional file 8).
Three-week-old seedlings were used for drought tolerance assays. After 16 days without water, all pots were
watered simultaneously and plant recovery and survival
rate were recorded. T 3 transgenic Arabidopsis plants
over-expressing MtCBF4 showed enhanced drought

tolerance, as wild-type plants had wilted compared to
transgenic lines L17 and L24 after drought treatment
(Figure 7b). Overall, 17.71% (34/192) of wild-type plants
survived, whereas the survival rates of the 35S:MtCBF4
L17 and L24 transgenic plants were 55.68% (103/185; Pvalue = 0.02, t test) and 30.73% (55/179; P-value =
0.324, t test), respectively (Figure 7c).
We tested the effect of NaCl on germination of
MtCBF4-over-expressing seeds. Seed germination of the
wild-type and transgenic plants did not differ under
normal conditions. However, in the presence of 220
mM NaCl seed germination differed significantly:
46.83% (92/229) of the wild-type seeds germinated,
whereas the germination rates of the 35S:MtCBF4 L17
and L24 transgenic lines were 79.66% (156/203, **p <
0.01, t test) and 62.86% (138/218, *p < 0.05, t test),
respectively (Figure 7d).
To determine the effect of MtCBF4 over-expression
on post-germination salt tolerance, 3 d after germination
transgenic and wild-type seedlings were carefully transferred to new plates containing different concentrations
of NaCl. At a NaCl concentration of 50 to 150 mM,
seedlings of both transgenic lines displayed better root
growth than the wild type. However, at 175 mM NaCl
root growth was seriously inhibited and no significant
difference was detected (Figure 7e, f). The I 50 of the

MtCBF4 transgenic plants was 150 mM NaCl, which
exceeded that of wild-type Arabidopsis (about 100 mM
NaCl). The results indicated over-expression of MtCBF4
in Arabidopsis increased salt tolerance during both germination and early seedling growth.
Since over-expression of MtCBF4 enhanced drought
and salt stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis, we
examined the changes in expression of abiotic stress
-responsive genes in these plants. Six genes (COR15A,
COR15B, KIN1, RD17, RD29A, and RD29B) that contain
DRE elements in their promoter regions and have been
identified as downstream genes of AtDREBs in Arabidopsis [61-63] were chosen for study. Total RNAs isolated from three-week-old wild-type, L17, and L24
seedlings were used for qRT-PCR analysis. Expression
levels of all six genes were enhanced in MtCBF4 transgenic plants under normal growth conditions (Figure 8).
These results indicated MtCBF4 up-regulated expression
of downstream genes related to drought and salt stress
responses.
Over-expression of MtCBF4 enhances salt tolerance and
induces two putative target genes in transient transgenic

To investigate the putative role of MtCBF4 in response
to salt stress, we prepared transgenic composite

The transgenic plants were identified by RFP detection
(Figure 9a). Three weeks after inoculation, the seedlings
were transferred to a new plate with salt-containing
medium (100 mM NaCl in Fahraeus medium), and the

conditions, there was no significant difference in growth

between over-expressing and control plants. However, a
significant increase (Student’s t-test, P-value = 0.007) in
primary roots growth in the MtCBF4-overexpressing
lines compared with the control plants was detected on
the salt-containing medium (Figure 9b, c). Another two

software. (f) Root lengths of the means of three replicated experiments. Error bars indicate SD (n = 18). Bars = 0.5 cm.

Further evidence was obtained by transient transfection
of the leaves by vacuum infiltration [32]. MtCAS15 and
MtCAS31 (GenBank accession nos. EU139869.1 and
EU139871.1) belong to the CBF regulon [65], so we

detected the expression level of these two targets in d35S:
MtCBF4 transgenic M. truncatula. Under normal conditions, the induction rates of the two genes were about
two-fold and three-fold, respectively, in d35S:MtCBF4
transgenic plants compared with the control plants
(empty vector transformed plants). However, under salt
treatment, the expression level of MtCAS31 increased
25-fold in control plants, whereas in d35S:MtCBF4 transgenic plants the expression level increased 40-fold.
Expression of MtCAS15 did not differ significantly
between the d35S:MtCBF4 transgenic and control plants
under salt treatment (Figure 9d, e). Primers used are
listed in Additional file 3 (Table S1 and Table S3). Overall, the results indicated that over-expression of MtCBF4
enhanced tolerance to salt stress and up-regulated the
expression of downstream genes in M. truncatula.

Pathway analysis of transcriptomic response to salt stress
in M. truncatula

Plants produce many secondary metabolites that not only
counteract environmental stress, but also aid growth and
development [66]. It is possible that an increased rate of
anthocyanin biosynthesis improves a plant’s ability to
guard against oxidative damage and protects it from such
injury. Anthocyanin reportedly functions in the cell
membrane as an antioxidant to prevent lipid peroxidation under conditions of stress [67,68]. Isoflavonoid

rhizogenes-transformed M. truncatula roots was observed with fluorescence microscopy 2 weeks after inoculation. In empty vector as well as

treatment, the leaves were treated with 100 mM NaCl for 6 h (Salt), and ddH2O treatment was used as a control (CK). Histograms show relative
quantification of the transgene and the putative targets (MtCAS15 and MtCAS31). Data represent means and SE of three replications.

reductase is a key enzyme in the isoflavonoid phytoalexin
biosynthesis pathway and was first studied in Medicago
sativa [69]. Over-expression of an isoflavone reductaselike gene in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) reportedly confers resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress
[70], which often occurs after ion stress caused by salt
stress. Isoflavonoids are required for a wide range of
essential physiological processes and are valuable secondary phenylpropanoid metabolites found mainly in
legumes. Over-expression of isoflavone 7-O-methyltransferase reportedly increases disease resistance in M. sativa
and is regarded as the entry point of the isoflavone pathway [71]. The isoflavone 3’-hydroxylase belongs to the
cytochrome P450 81E family in M. truncatula and

possesses many biotic defense responses [72]. The hydroxylation process depends on cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, which are critical to the isoflavone pathway [73],
and the probe set Mtr.12632.1.S1_at, appears to be most
similar to CYP81D8 (AT4G37370.1) in Arabidopsis. A
recent study revealed that a flavonoid-deficient root of
M. truncatula lost nodulation capacity, while an isoflavone-deficient root remained unaffected [74], indicating
that the flavone and isoflavone pathways not only function differently during the nodulation process, but also
during the response to salt stress. The mechanisms of the
isoflavone biosynthesis pathway have been studied using
M. truncatula as a model system, which demonstrated
that it has tissue- and stress-specific expression patterns

[75]; our findings confirmed its capability to respond to
salt stress.
The active metabolism of cofactors and vitamins may
help to establish the translation process; the biosynthesis
of the secondary metabolites discussed above might help
to re-establish the osmotic balance and reduce the
threat of ROS, and the biodegradation of xenobiotics
might help remove injurants generated or introduced by
salt stress. Plants might require these response mechanisms against abiotic stress to survive. The response of
plants to salt stress is very complex; this may be illustrated by the considerably higher number of probe sets
up-regulated in signal transduction and ligand-receptor
interaction pathways. Probe sets involved in protein
folding, sorting, and degradation include heat shock proteins. It is worth noting that the probe sets related to
cell growth and death processes showed greater up-regulation. Many studies have shown that abiotic stresses,
such as salt stress, induce programmed cell death and
also result in morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in plants [76,77].
A novel CBF member from M. truncatula

The DREB subfamily pathway plays an important role in
the stress-responsive regulatory network in plants [17].
Currently, many homologous DREB genes have been
identified in a variety of plants, such as Arabidopsis,
rice, soybean, barley (Hordeum vulgare), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum),
tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and maize (Zea mays),
and over-expression of these genes increased the tolerance to abiotic stresses [17-21,24,56,78-83]. Three
MtCBFs (MtCBF1, MtCBF2, and MtCBF3) have been
isolated, which were thought to play an important role
in response to cold stress [29]. MtCBF1 was slightly
induced by salt stress in our microarray data, while
MtCBF2 and MtCBF3 showed no significant changes by
checking their corresponding homologous probe sets.
The novel CBF subfamily member MtCBF4, which
encodes a homolog of CBF proteins in M. truncatula,
showed the highest change in induced expression under
salt stress, and was isolated in this study.
Tissue specificity analysis with the Medicago truncatula Gene Expression Atlas [84] indicated that MtCBF4
showed a relatively higher expression level in the stem,
root (especially the root tip) and seed coat than in other
tissues. MtCBF1 showed higher expression in the root
and leaf, MtCBF2 was expressed more highly in the
shoot and stem, and expression of MtCBF3 was higher
in the nodule and root. Expression of MtCBF4 in the
root and root tip indicated its involvement in the salt
stress response, as the root is the first plant organ to
perceive external stress in soil.

Page 13 of 19

Phylogenetic analysis revealed MtCBF4 belonged to the
DREB1-type class and was most similar to GmCBF2 and
GmCBF1. However, the study of GmCBF2 and GmCBF1
is very limited. The amino acid sequence of the MtCBF4
protein also shares relatively high similarity (57%) with
Arabidopsis AtDREB1D/CBF4 protein. MtCBF4 protein
had a conserved AP2 DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal LWSY motif, as well as the CBF signature sequences
(PKK/RPAGRxKFxETRHP, DSAWR, and A(A/V)xxA(A/
V)xxF). However, the MtCBF4 protein contained DSAWK
instead of DSAWR. These features are found in another
CBF homolog, namely tobacco ACRE111B (GenBank
accession no. AAG43549.1), which also contains DSAWK
instead of DSAWR, indicating that the DSAWK might be
a functional equivalent of DSAWR. MtCBF4 is a nuclearlocalized protein and also possesses transactivation ability
as expected.
Some transcription factors could be induced by a single
stress, whereas others might be induced by multiple stresses. AtCBF4 was up-regulated by drought stress and ABA
[21]. A previous study revealed that it was up-regulated by
salt stress [18]. Moreover, transcription of AtCBF4 was
induced under both chilling and cold stress, as indicated
by the more sensitive qRT-PCR method [22]. Thus,
AtCBF4 is induced under ABA, drought, cold, and salt stimulation. As another example, the transcription level of
GmDREB2 was induced by cold, salt, and drought stress,
as well as ABA treatment in soybeans [27]. MtCBF4,
which exhibited a similar expression pattern, was also
induced by ABA, drought, salt, and cold stimulation in
our research. MtCBF4 might play an important role in
response to abiotic stress in M. truncatula. Enriched presence of different stress-responsive cis-acting elements in
the promoter of MtCBF4 explains why MtCBF4 was
induced by multiple stresses and ABA treatment.
MtCBF4 improved abiotic stress tolerance by activating
downstream genes containing DRE elements

Researchers have shown that over-expression of DREB
transcription factor genes improves stress tolerance
[17,19,21,27,30,85,86]. Over-expression of MtCBF4
cDNA in transgenic Arabidopsis plants also activated
some stress-inducible genes such as COR15A, COR15B,
KIN1, RD17, RD29A, and RD29B under normal growing
conditions. Among the downstream genes, COR15A,
COR15B, KIN1, RD29A and RD17, which have A/
GCCGACNT as the DRE core motif in their promoter
regions, are AtDREB1 target genes [61,62] and showed a
higher transcript level in MtCBF4 transgenic plants. By
contrast, RD29B, which has ACCGACNA/G/C as the
DRE core motif in its promoter region, belongs to the
AtDREB2A specific regulon [63], and showed a comparatively lower expression level in the transgenic plants.

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/109

As no probe sets were found significantly homologous
to these downstream stress-inducible genes in Arabidopsis, we selected two other putative downstream genes of
MtCBF4, namely MtCAS15 and MtCAS31, which also
contain DRE elements in their promoter region, to
check their expression changes in transgenic M. truncatula. Expression inducement of MtCAS15 and MtCAS31
was also detected in transgenic M. truncatula overexpressing MtCBF4. In our microarray data, expression
of MtCAS31 was also up-regulated, but no homologous
probe sets exist for MtCAS15. The results were consistent with the transactivation analysis in the yeast system.
Collectively, these two analyses indicated MtCBF4 functions as a transcriptional activator.

Conclusion
We used high-throughput microarray technology to monitor the expression dynamics in roots of Medicago truncatula seedlings in response to salt stress. Bioinformatic
analysis of the expression data indicated that primary
metabolism, including glycolysis, carbon fixation, starch,
and sucrose metabolism, were affected most by external
salt stress, whereas secondary metabolism pathways,
which could help to reduce ROS threat and maintain
osmotic balance, such as the anthocyanin and isoflavone
pathways were induced, indicating an active response and
defense mechanism protects the plant against external
abiotic stress. In addition, we selected a transcription factor gene, MtCBF4, for function validation. Phylogenetic
and multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed
MtCBF4 is a novel member of the CBF transcriptional factor family in M. truncatula. The role in the abiotic stress
response of MtCBF4 and the activation ability of downstream genes related to the stress response in transgenic
Arabidopsis and M. truncatula over-expressing MtCBF4
indicated MtCBF4 is involved in stress tolerance, and is a
good candidate gene for genetic improvement to produce
stress-tolerant transgenic plants.
Methods
Plant material and treatments

Seeds of Medicago truncatula cv. Jemalong line A17
were obtained from the Biological Resource Centre for
the model species Medicago truncatula (INRA BRCMTR, http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/BRC-MTR/
accueil.php). Seeds were first soaked in concentrated
sulfuric acid for about 25 min, then rinsed seven times
with distilled H2O, incubated at 4°C for 2 d, and germinated on moistened filter papers. When the roots had
grown to about 2 cm long, seeds were transplanted to a
soil/vermiculite (1:1, v/v) mix and grown in a greenhouse maintained at 22°C under long-days (16 h light, 8
h dark) with 50% humidity. The plants were used for

Page 14 of 19

microarray experiments and expression pattern analyses
of MtCBF4 under different stress assays.
Four weeks after germination, seedlings underwent
several treatments. Treatment with ABA was performed
by spraying 200 μM ABA solution containing 0.05%
Tween 20 (v/v) on leaves for 1 h, 6 h and 24 h. For
drought treatment, the seedlings were transferred to dry
Whatman 3 MM paper in a sterile Petri dish for 1 h, 2
h and 3 h. For salt treatment, 180 mM NaCl for 6 h, 24
h and 48 h. For cold treatment, the seedlings were incubated at 4°C for 1 h, 6 h and 24 h. After treatment, the
seedlings were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen
immediately, and stored at -80°C for further analysis.
Root length measurements under different NaCl
concentrations

Young seedlings of M. truncatula were grown under different salt stress conditions (0, 60, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120,
140, 160, 180, or 200 mM NaCl) in darkness. Ten seedlings were treated with each NaCl concentration. Root
lengths were measured at 12:00 on each day at 0, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 d after stress treatment was initiated.
The percentage increase in root length per day was calculated as a measure of growth rate. The root lengths of
seedlings treated with different NaCl levels were compared using Student’s t-test.
Microarray experiment, validation, and bioinformatic
analysis

The design of the microarray experiment and data analysis was identical to that described in our previous
work [34]. Original results of our micorarry experiments
had also been deposited in NCBI GEO database [87]
with accession number GSE13921 http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE13921. The same
RNA from root samples was used for qRT-PCR analysis
to confirm the microarray data.
Expression profiles were clustered using STEM software. Probe sets that were up- or down-regulated by
more than two-fold at each time-point (compared to that
at 0 h for each profile) were applied to function and pathway classification analysis using the GeneBins and
PathExpress tools, respectively, using default parameters.
For phylogenetic analyses ClustalW version 1.83 [88]
was used to generate the multiple alignment and MEGA
version 4.1 [89] for phylogenetic reconstruction. Bootstrap support percentages were calculated from 1000
replications.
Arabidopsis transgenic lines and treatments

MtCBF4 cDNA was amplified using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) from mRNA extracted from fourweek-old M. truncatula A17 plants treated with

200 mM NaCl for 6 h. The cDNA was cloned into the
pMD18-T simple vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) using
the primers 5’-TAC CAT GGA CAT GTT TAC TAT
GAA TCA ATT-3’ (Nco I site underlined) and 5’-ATA
CTA GTT TAA AAT GAG TAA CTC CAC A-3’ (Spe
I site underlined). An NcoI-SpeI fragment containing
MtCBF4 cDNA was inserted into pCAMBIA1302 containing the 35S CaMV promoter and a hygromycin
(kanamycin) resistance marker. The plasmid was introduced into Agrobacterium EHA105 using heat shock.
The pCAMBIA1302 vector containing 35S:MtCBF4
was transformed into Arabidopsis plants using the
floral dip method [90]. Genomic PCR, RT-PCR, and
hygromycin spray/paint (80 mg ml-1) all confirmed the
successful transfer of 35S:MtCBF4.
To evaluate drought stress, one-week-old seedlings
were transferred to pots (10 cm diameter) filled with a
soil/vermiculite (1:1, v/v) mix for another 2 weeks, in a
greenhouse under conditions of continuous illumination
of approximately 100 μmol m-2 s-1, 50% relative humidity, a temperature of 22°C, and long days (16 h light, 8 h
dark), with regular watering every 4 d before water was
withheld. After 16 d without water, all pots were
watered simultaneously and plant recovery and survival
rate were measured after 4 d.
To determine the sensitivity of seed germination to
NaCl, seeds from wild-type and transgenic plants were
placed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar plates [91]
or MS agar plates saturated with 220 mM NaCl. The
seeds were incubated at 4°C for 72 h before transfer to
a growth chamber with constant light (approximately
100 μmol m -2 s-1 ) at 22°C for germination. After 7 d,
seed germination was recorded. Seeds were considered
to have germinated when radicles were 1 mm long.
To assess salt tolerance, three-day old seedlings were
carefully transferred to MS medium containing different
concentrations of NaCl (0, 50, 100, 125, 150, or 175 mM)
for 7 d. Seedling root lengths were analyzed with Image
software http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html. The drought
and salt tolerance experiments were repeated three times.
qRT-PCR analysis

Total RNA was extracted from plants harvested at the
specified time-points with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
USA) and treated with RNase-free DNaseI (Progema).
Total RNA (2 μg) was used for reverse transcription
with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and the
cDNA samples were diluted by four-fold. For qRT-PCR,
triplicate quantitative assays were performed on each
cDNA dilution with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) and
a CFX Manager sequence detection system according to
the following protocol: denaturation at 95°C with 30 s
for initiation, denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, 40 cycles of
amplification, annealing and extension at 51°C/57.6°C

Page 15 of 19

for 30 s, and collection of fluorescence data at 51°C by
reading the plates. Specificity of the amplification was
checked using a melting curve performed from 65-95°C,
as well as sequencing of the amplicon. Three independent replicates were performed per experiment, and the
means and corresponding standard errors were
calculated.
For MtCBF4 expression pattern analysis as well as
transient expression assays in M. truncatula, the annealing and extension temperature is 51°C; MtActin gene
was used in parallel to perform the reaction and to control constitutive expression.
For detection of the transcript levels of target genes,
the annealing and extension temperature was 57.6°C.
AtACTIN2 and Atb-TUBULIN were used in parallel to
perform the reaction and to control constitutive expression. All relevant primer sequences used in this work
are listed in Additional file 3.
Localization of MtCBF4-GFP fusion proteins

The entire coding sequence of MtCBF4 was amplified
with two primers: 5’-CTC GAG GAT GTT TAC TAT
GAA TCA ATT TTC-3’ (XhoI site underlined) and 5’GGT ACC CAA ATG AGT AAC TCC ACA ATG
AAA CT-3’ (KpnI site underlined). The PCR product
was subcloned into the pE3025-GFP vector to generate
pE3025-MtCBF4-GFP containing an MtCBF4-GFP
fusion construct under the control of the CaMV dual
35S promoter, as well as a TEV enhancer. The construct
was confirmed by sequencing and used for transient
transformation of onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells
via a gene gun (Bio-Rad, California, USA). GFP fluorescence was observed under a confocal microscope
(Nikon). The pE3025-GFP empty vector was used as a
control.
In this study, the pE3025-GFP vector was derived
from the pSATS-RFP-NI vector. Using XmaI and XbaI
restriction enzymes, we replaced the red fluorescent
protein (RFP) gene with the GFP gene, which was
cloned from pCAMBIA1302 with the primers 5’-ATC
CCG GGA TGG TAG ATC TGA CTA GT-3’ (XmaI
site underlined) and 5’-ATTCT AGA TTA GTG GCT
AGC T’TT GTA TAG-3’ (XbaI site underlined). This
created a new vector named pE3025-GFP.
Transactivation analysis in yeast

The entire coding sequence of MtCBF4 was amplified
using two primers: 5’-GAA TTC ATG TTT ACT ATG
AAT CAA TTT TC-3’ (EcoRI site underlined) and 5’CTG CAG TTA AAA TGA GTA ACT CCA CAA TG3’ (PstI site underlined). The PCR product was subcloned into the DNA-binding domain vector pBD
GAL4, a yeast expression vector with the promoter and
terminator of the ADH1 gene, to construct GAL4 DNA-

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:109

BD-MtCBF4 fusion plasmids pBD-MtCBF4. The recombinant plasmid was then transferred into a yeast strain
YRG-2 carrying the reporter genes His3 and LacZ. The
yeast strain cannot grow on the SD plates without histidine, which cannot induce LacZ (b-galactosidase) activity. The transformed yeast culture was dropped onto SD
plates without tryptophan or without both tryptophan
and histidine. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 3 d
and applied to a b-Gal assay to examine the transactivation ability of MtCBF4.
Transient expression assays and preparation of A.
rhizogenes-transformed roots

Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed M. truncatula
roots were prepared as described previously [64].
Three weeks after inoculation of seedling roots without apices with A. rhizogenes strain Arqua1, the seedlings were transferred to a new plate with Fahraeus
medium containing 100 mM NaCl. At the moment of
transfer, the position of the root apex was labeled and
root length was measured 1 week after transfer. Three
biological experiments were performed, and at least
100 independent transgenic roots per construct and
per condition were analyzed. For over-expression of
MtCBF4, an Nco I-Spe I fragment containing MtCBF4
cDNA was inserted into the pRNAi vector containing
the d35S promoter and an OCS 3’, and amplified with
the same primers used to construct pCAMBIA1302MtCBF4. The resulting inverted construct was
inserted Kpn I-Pac I into the pRedRoot binary vector
[64]. The transgenic lines were determined by detecting RFP.
For transient expression assays in M. truncatula, A.
rhizogenes strain Arqua1 carrying the same constructs
was used for vacuum infiltration of four-week-old M.
truncatula A17 plants as described previously [32].
After transfection, plants were grown in a growth chamber at 24°C under long days (16 h light, 8 h dark) for 48
h. For salt treatment, the leaves were treated with 100
mM NaCl for 6 h, and ddH2O treatment was used as a
control. Leaves were then collected for total RNA
extraction to perform qRT-PCR analysis. Expression of
MtCAS15, MtCAS31 and MtCBF4 was normalized using
MtActin.
