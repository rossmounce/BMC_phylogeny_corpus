Abstract
Background: Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) play important roles in many biological functions.
Protein domains, which are defined as independently folding structural blocks of proteins, physically
interact with each other to perform these biological functions. Therefore, the identification of
Domain-Domain Interactions (DDIs) is of great biological interests because it is generally accepted
that PPIs are mediated by DDIs. As a result, much effort has been put on the prediction of domain
pair interactions based on computational methods. Many DDI prediction tools using PPIs network
and domain evolution information have been reported. However, tools that combine the primary
sequences, domain annotations, and structural annotations of proteins have not been evaluated
before.
Results: In this study, we report a novel approach called Gram-bAsed Interaction Analysis (GAIA).
GAIA extracts peptide segments that are composed of fixed length of continuous amino acids,
called n-grams (where n is the number of amino acids), from the annotated domain and DDI data
set in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) and identifies a list of n-grams that may contribute
to DDIs and PPIs based on the frequencies of their appearance. GAIA also reports the coordinate
position of gram pairs on each interacting domain pair. We demonstrate that our approach
improves on other DDI prediction approaches when tested against a gold-standard data set and
achieves a true positive rate of 82% and a false positive rate of 21%. We also identify a list of 4gram pairs that are significantly over-represented in the DDI data set and may mediate PPIs.
Conclusion: GAIA represents a novel and reliable way to predict DDIs that mediate PPIs. Our
results, which show the localizations of interacting grams/hotspots, provide testable hypotheses for
experimental validation. Complemented with other prediction methods, this study will allow us to
elucidate the interactome of cells.

Background
Biological functions of cells are determined by strict regulations of molecular interactions of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nuclear acids both temporally and spatially.
Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) play important roles
in all biological functions from enzyme catalysis, signal
transduction, as well as many structural functions. Owing
to advances in large-scale techniques such as the yeast
two-hybrid system and affinity purification followed by
mass spectrometry, interactomes of several model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1-6], Drosophila melanogaster [7,8] and Caenorhabditis elegans [9] have recently
been extensively studied. While such large-scale interaction data sets provide tremendous opportunities for data
exploration although there are limitations: 1) the experimental techniques for detecting PPIs are time-consuming,
costly and labour intensive; 2) the quality of certain datasets is uneven; and 3) technical limitations such as the
requirement to tag proteins of interest still exist. It has
been widely accepted that some proteins interact with
each other through interactions between their domains,
which are defined as independently structural and/or
functional blocks of proteins. For example, some cytoskeletal proteins interact with actin because of the interaction
between their gelsolin repeat domains [10]. It has also
been reported that sets of conserved residues within the
WW domains can bind to proline-rich peptides [11].
Therefore, the identification of DDIs can potentially shred
light on the mechanism underlying PPIs. Unfortunately,
identifying neither DDIs nor PPIs through experimental
approaches is trivial. As a complementary alternative,
computational approaches that identify DDIs have been
studied intensively for years yielding some interesting
results.
The currently available computational DDI prediction
approaches can be categorized as follows: 1) Associationbased approaches where each DDI is scored by the association of the number of interacting domain pairs between
interacting protein pairs and non-interacting protein
pairs. These methods, however, only compute each DDI
locally without considering the information of other
DDIs between protein pairs [12-14]. Deng et al. proposed
an optimized approach, maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE), which globally calculates the probabilities of interaction between two domains using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [15]. 2) Pattern-based
approaches where the domain interaction pattern of each
interacting protein pair is utilized to predict DDIs by
applying machine learning approaches such as clustering
algorithm [16] or random forest algorithm [17]. 3) The
Co-evolution-based approach where a pair of domains is
regarded as interacting with each other if they share very
similar phylogenetic trees [18]. However, one of the caveats for these DDI prediction approaches is that the infor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S1/S60

mation regarding the sequences and structures of these
domains is neglected and as a result they suffer from low
sensitivities and specificities.
It is known that segments of n contiguous amino acids (or
n-grams) correlate to specific secondary structure elements [19,20]. Therefore, n-gram-based methods are
widely exploited to predict the secondary structure or subcellular localization of proteins and to classify protein
families using machine learning techniques [21-23]. The
finding that n-grams are closely related to the secondary
structure of protein domains prompts us to wonder
whether n-grams can interact with each other. In fact, several studies have reported the interaction between ngrams. For example, molecular interaction exists between
Smurf1 WW2 domain and PPXY motifs of Smad1[24].
Src-homology 3 domain (SH3) binds to a PXXP peptide
[25]. Therefore, we hypothesize that some over-represented gram-gram interactions mediate DDIs and thus
PPIs. In this study, we introduced a novel DDI prediction
approach based on the primary sequence of proteins, by
extracting n-gram frequencies from the annotated domain
and DDI data set in yeast. This approach adopted substantial expansion from a related study reported previously
[26].
Our approach, called GAIA, improves on other prediction
approaches. When tested against a gold-standard data set,
GAIA achieves a true positive rate (sensitivity) of 82%
with a false positive rate (1 – specificity) of 21% and performs more accurately when the length of the gram is set
to 4 amino acids. Using GAIA, we generated a list of 4gram pairs that are significantly over-represented in the
DDI data set. We postulate that these pairs mediate the
DDIs in yeast. Overall, we demonstrate that GAIA, a grambased method, provides a novel and reliable way to predict DDIs that may mediate PPIs in yeast. Our results,
which show the localization of interacting grams/
hotspots, provide testable hypotheses for experimental
validation. Complemented with other prediction methods, this study facilitates us to elucidate the entire interactome of cells.

Results and discussion
Performance of the GAIA algorithm
To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we tested
the GAIA algorithm against both gold-standard positive
and negative PPI data sets by setting the length of n-gram
to 4 and the threshold of DDI's hits to 8.3. For the positive
data set, 82% (886 out of 1080) of interacting domain
pairs were successfully predicted and 18% of interacting
domain pairs were detected to not interact with each
other. For the negative data set, 21% (161 out of 767) of
non-interacting domain pairs were incorrectly detected to
interact with each other. These results indicate that our

algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of
79%. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was
plotted by measuring the sensitivity and specificity of
GAIA tested against two gold-standard data sets at different cut-off values of DDI's hits (Fig. 1). The area under the
curve (AUC) for the 4-gram is 0.79, which suggests that
GAIA has a decent predictive performance.
Next, we tested whether our predicted DDIs could be utilized to predict PPIs. When there is at least one of our predicted DDIs existing between a pair of proteins, this pair
of proteins is predicted as interacting with each other. For
the positive data set, it was observed that 76% (452 out of
595) of interacting protein pairs were successfully predicted. For the negative data set, 25% (149 out of 595) of
non-interacting protein pairs were incorrectly detected to
interact with each other, reaching a sensitivity of 76% and
a specificity of 75% when the threshold of DDI's hits is set
to 8.3. These results demonstrate GAIA superiority to even
in vivo experimental PPI identification approaches [1-6,8]
as pointed out by several recent publications [26-28].
However, it should be noted that PPIs are predicted in
GAIA under the assumption that interactions of given proteins are mediated by pairs of domains. Therefore, GAIA is
not able to predict those PPIs mediated by amino acid segments outside of known interacting domains.
In order to investigate whether some gram pairs act as
sequence signatures or markers of PPIs, we assigned a
probability score to each gram pair (see method section)

for 4-grams and 0.52 for 5-grams, respectively.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S1/S60

and compared the performance of GAIA with probability
scores to that without probability scores. By using
weighed gram pairs with probability scores, GAIA
improved the sensitivity of DDI prediction from 68% to
82% and specificity from 66% to 79%. This improvement
reflects the importance of highlighting gram-pairs that are
over-represented in pairs of interacting domains but not
in pairs of non-interacting domains, suggesting that these
gram-pairs can act as sequence signatures.
Parameters of the GAIA algorithm
The GAIA algorithm is solely based on protein sequence
so no further information such as protein function or protein evolution information is needed. Only two parameters are needed to tune GAIA: (i) the length of gram (Lg).
Different gram lengths (3-grams, 4-grams, and 5-grams)
have been tested. From observations of the ROC plots
(Fig. 1), we found that with gram length of 3 or less, the
DDI hits are not specific to the input DDI data set, therefore, yielding low true positive and high false positive
rates. Conversely, with gram length of 5 or more, the DDI
hits are too specific/low to differentiate between the positive and negative data sets. Therefore, we concluded that
4-gram yielded the best accuracy; and (ii) the threshold of
the number of DDI hits (Nhit). Choosing a proper threshold value optimizes the sensitivity at the expense of the
specificity. For example, setting a lower threshold results
in an increased sensitivity, at the expense of a decreased
specificity. Similarly, a higher threshold results in a
decreased sensitivity with an increase in specificity. Based
on the ROC plots, it was found that GAIA achieves a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 79% when the threshold
is set to 8.3 (Fig. 1).
Case studies on predicted DDIs
Our predictions were directly validated for some PPIs
using documented three-dimensional structures available
in the literature. For example, RPB1 (YDL140C,
NP_010141.1) and PRB2 (YOR224C, NP_014867.1), two
subunits of RNA polymerase II, are known to interact with
each other [29]. Based on the iPfam annotation, these two
proteins have three DDIs: PF04983 vs. PF03870; PF05000
vs. PF03870; PF04922 vs. PF03870. GAIA successfully
predicted the interaction between this pair of proteins.
Interestingly, we also found a 4-gram pair (KLTL:EAAS)
which may contribute to the PPI. The first 4-gram, KLTL,
is located in the region of residues 533 – 536 which corresponds to PF04983 (RNA polymerase Rpb1) on RPB1.
EAAS is located in the region of residues 27 – 30, which
corresponds to PF03870 (RNA polymerase Rpb8) on
RPB8 (Figure 2).

chrome bc1 complex) involved in cell respiration as a part
of the mitochondrial inner membrane electron transport
chain [30] was also examined. The interaction between
COR1 and QCR2 has been validated by experimental
approaches [1,5,29] and also by the GAIA algorithm.
From the GAIA results, two gram pairs may contribute to
this interaction. The first pair (GVSN:GGLF) is located in
the region of residues 68 – 71 which corresponds to
PF00675 (Peptidase family M16) on COR1 and the region
of residues 282–285 which corresponds to PF05193
(Peptidase M16 inactive domain) on QCR2. The second
pair (LHST:VRDQ) is located in the region of residues 164
– 167 which also corresponds to PF00675 on COR1 and

the region of residues 289 – 292 which corresponds to
PF05193 on QCR2 (Figure 3).
Detecting new DDI-mediated PPIs and unknown domains
The GAIA tool performs well on previously reported PPIs
mediated by DDIs in the gold-standard data set at a true
positive rate of 82%. We therefore sought to apply the
GAIA tool to identity novel PPIs and to determine the
domains through which these interactions are mediated.
Recently, Smy2p (YBR172C, NP_009731.2), a yeast gene
encoding a protein of unknown function, was found to

in the coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicle formation
from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [31]. The interaction between Smy2p and Sec23p was also predicted by
GAIA. This successful prediction not only proves the ability of GAIA to detect novel PPIs but also suggests that the
interaction might be mediated by DDIs. According to the
domain annotations from the Pfam database [32], there is
one annotated domain (PF02213: GYF) in Smy2p and 5
annotated domains (PF04810: zf-Sec23_Sec24; PF04811:
Sec23_trunk;
PF08033:
Sec23_BS;
PF04815:
Sec23_helical; PF00626: Gelsolin) in Sec23p. Currently,
there is no report of the DDIs between Smy2p and Sec23p
in the literature. However, upon close examination of the
prediction results from GAIA, we found two gram-pairs
that may contribute to this PPI. The first pair has 18.7 DDI
hits and is located at residues 410 – 413 of Sec23p, which
corresponds to PF08033 and residues 68 – 71 of Smy2p.
The second pair has 15.3 DDI hits and is located at residues 409 – 412 of Sec23p which corresponds to PF08033
and residues 499 – 502 of Smy2p. These results suggest
that the Beta sandwich domain on Sec23p might well be
involved in the PPI between Sec23p and Sym2p. Furthermore, we also found that another pair of 4-grams located

at residues 616 – 619 in the Beta sandwich domain of
Sec24p interacts with another 4-gram located at residue
713 – 716 of Sym2p, further supporting the important
role for the Beta sandwich domain in the interaction
between Sec23p/Sec24p and Sym2p. However, no known
domain annotations have been associated with the location of the 4-grams on Smy2p, suggesting that potential
domains of functional interest on Smy2p need to be further validated experimentally.
In addition to identifying new PPIs mediated by DDI, we
also tested our GAIA tool on some protein pairs to infer
new interacting domains from the predicted PPIs. Bud5
(YCR038C, NP_009967.2) and Bud8 (YLR353W,
NP_013457.1) are two proteins involved in bud-site
selection of diploid cells in yeast [33]. Krappmann et. al
utilized the systematic structure-function analyses to identify that Bud5p physically interacts with Bud8p, and also
interacts with Bud9p (YGR041W) which is involved in the
delivery of the proteins to the cell poles [34]. They also
found that the region of residues 74 – 216 on Bud8p and
the region of residues 91 – 218 on Bud9p are interacting
domains required to bind Bud5. Interestingly, GAIA also

Page 5 of 10

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 1):S60

predicted a 4-gram pair that might mediate this interaction. This gram pair has 12.4 DDI hits and is located at residues 183 – 186 of Bud8p, which corresponds within the
newly discovered 74 – 216 region mentioned above. This
data supports our hypothesis that GAIA can be used to
detect novel interacting domains from public domainrelated data sets.

Comparison between different approaches
DDI prediction algorithms similar to GAIA such as association method (AM) [14], maximum likelihood estimation approach (MLE) [15] and relative co-evolution of
domain pairs approach (RCDP) [18] have recently been
reported. It is difficult to compare the prediction accuracy
of each approach directly because different testing datasets were utilized in each study. It is reported that AM

Characterizing over-represented gram pairs
In our study, we have demonstrated that gram pairs are
indeed valid elements in determining DDIs. In order to
shed light on how these gram pairs actually interact with
each other, we sought to identify and characterize the
gram pairs over-represented in DDIs in the yeast proteome. We generated a list (Table 1) of over-represented
gram pairs from the DDI data we used by quantifying
their occurrences in both DDI data set and randomized
negative data sets. The randomized negative data sets contain the same number of domain pairs as the iPfam DDI
data set but these domain pairs do not exist in the iPfam
DDI data set. As shown in Table 1, we found that most
over-represented gram pairs are identical to each other.
This finding suggests that some types of domains tend to
interact with themselves. Such self-interactions could
occur between SNARE transmembrane domains that promote the hemifusion-to-fusion transition [35]. Analyzing
the DDI pair in iPfam, we found that such self-interactions between domains constitute approximately half
(51%) of iPfam DDIs. It is therefore not surprising that
these identical gram pairs occur so frequently in the DDI
pairs. We also noticed that a majority of these interacting
gram pairs consist of two consecutive hydrophilic (K, E or
N) amino acids flanked by two hydrophobic amino acids
(L, I or V), or two consecutive hydrophobic amino acids
flanked by two hydrophilic amino acids. We reason that
this kind of distribution of hydrophobicity may place the
two amino acids in the middle in an environment where
their hydrophobicity is reinforced by the surrounding
amino acids of opposite hydrophobicity. Such reinforcement of hydrophobicity may increase the opportunity of
this gram interacting with another gram with similar
hydrophobicity reinforcement. This characteristic, however, does not exist in all of the over-represented gram
pairs in our list, suggesting that other mechanisms also
contribute to the interaction between gram pairs.

subset of interacting proteins. MLE achieved a sensitivity
of 77.6% and a positive prediction value (PPV) of 42.5%
when tested against a combined data set identified by
yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. RCDP reported a sensitivity of 63.95% against a positive data set containing interacting proteins with DDIs derived from Protein Data Bank
(PDB) crystal structures [18] and a specificity of 55.19%
against a data set of randomly generated protein pairs. In
order to eliminate the possibility that our gold standard
data set is biased towards GAIA, therefore, we tested GAIA
against the same testing data set (a combined data of two
Y2H data sets derived from Uetz et al. [6] and Ito et al. [4])
used in each approach. GAIA achieved a PPV of 69% at the
sensitivity is of 78% whereas AM and MLE achieved PPV
of 42.5% and 24%, respectively, at the sensitivity of 78%
[15], indicating that GAIA outperforms both AM and
MLE. To account for the consideration that the improved
performance is due to the better quality of input data, we
also trained AM and MLE on 6304 PPIs containing identical number of DDIs as our GAIA training data set. We
found that AM achieved a sensitivity of 51% with a specificity of 79% and MLE achieved a sensitivity of 57% with a
specificity of 79% when tested against our gold-standard
data set, proving that protein sequence information combined with structural information derived from iPfam is a
better indicator to predict DDIs. In addition, GAIA also

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 1):S60

achieved a better sensitivity of 83% if the specificity was
set to 55% in comparison to RCDP using the same testing
data set as RCDP, illustrating that GAIA also performs better than RCDP. In summary, GAIA has the following
advantages compared to other aforementioned
approaches: 1) We have shown that GAIA can achieve better sensitivity and specificity in detecting DDIs; 2) GAIA is
solely based on domain sequences and DDIs derived from
PDB, rather than just PPI information, since prediction
performance may be affected by poor PPI data set quality.
We strongly believe that gram pairs such as those used in
GAIA play a "signature" role in mediating the binding of
a domain pair or protein pair. 3) By using protein
sequences, GAIA precisely specifies the localization of
interacting
grams/hotspots.

Conclusion
GAIA is a novel tool for identifying DDIs that mediate
PPIs. GAIA takes the public DDI data set and the domain
sequence data set as inputs and predicts the interaction
between a query protein pair if the DDI hit frequencies of
the gram pairs across the query proteins are above the preset threshold (8.3 DDIs). Tested against a "gold-standard"
data set, GAIA achieves 82% true positive rate at the
expense of 21% false positive rate. GAIA was used to identify a list of 4-gram pairs that is significantly over-represented in the DDI data set that may mediate PPIs. GAIA
allows us to predict currently unknown interacting
domains and to identify potential interacting gram pairs/
hotspots between proteins. This study complements previous prediction approaches and also improves upon similar prediction modeling systems. The resultant
predictions provide testable hypotheses for experimental
validation. In the meantime, GAIA is limited by its highly
intensive computational time (10 mins/per pair), which is
currently being addressed by making changes to GAIA so
that it can run in a distributed environment. While GAIA
has good prediction capacity, increasing the size of the
DDI data set would assist identification of a more complete set of gram pairs within the DDI data sets. This could
ultimately lead us to a more complete identification of
PPIs mediated by DDIs.

Methods
The aim of this work is to predict DDIs based on the frequency of each possible gram-pair from a pair of query
proteins. The frequencies of aforementioned gram-pairs
are calculated from the annotated DDI data set and random data sets. In addition to predicting DDIs, GAIA also
generates a list of gram pairs and their protein primary
structure coordinates that contribute to the interaction
between pairs of domains on query proteins. Details of
how the GAIA algorithm works are provided in the following section, along with information about the data set

collection, performance evaluation, and development
environment.
The GAIA algorithm
Step A. For each 4-gram Gi, in query protein A, we generated a list of iPfam annotated domains dlistG[i] that contain this gram and the number of hits of this gram in each
domain;

Step B. For each 4-gram Gj appearing in query protein B,
we also generated a list of Pfam annotated domains
dlistG[j] that contain this gram and the number of hits of
this gram in each domain;
Step C. For each gram-pair (Gi, Gj) between the query proteins A and B, we calculated the frequency of hits freq[i][j]
for this gram-pair represented in interacting domaindomain pairs previously established in Pfam [36]. Then,
the final frequency of hits score[i][j] for this gram-pair was
weighted by weightScore[i][j] to determine if the number
of its occurrences in the interacting domain pairs is statistically significant. The hit scores and weight scores are calculated by the following formulas:
hitscore[i][j] = No. of hits *weightScore[i][j]

(1)

weightScore[i][j] = P(real|random)(Gram[i][j])

(2)

Here, P(real|random) [i] [j] is the probability of the number of
occurrences of Gram[i][j] in the interacting domain pairs
is expected at random. Comparable control domain pairs
were randomly generated by pairing domains from the
DDI data set.
Step D. For each gram-pair generated from Step C, if the
hit frequency was over the preset threshold c and this
gram-pair was located in a domain region, then this grampair and their corresponding domain pair was predicted
to interact with each other. A profile containing the
number of hits and the positions of the gram-pairs in the
input query protein pair was simultaneously generated.
This profile is important because it provides information
on the amino acid hotspots that are potentially contributing to the physical interaction between the pair of query
proteins (Fig. 4).
Data set collection
We compiled 3,020 DDIs in yeast and their corresponding
amino acid sequences from Pfam [32], a database containing protein domains and domain families, and iPfam
[36], a database of DDIs derived from their RCSB Protein
Data Bank (PDB) crystal structures [37]. For the purpose
of evaluating prediction performance, we also used a
"gold-standard" dataset that contained 595 PPIs compiled
from a PPI dataset identified by the homologous protein

interaction verification (HPIV) method [38]. It is reported
that the HPIV positive dataset has better quality when
used as the training data set for predicting PPIs [38]. All
interacting protein pairs in our positive gold-standard
dataset were expected to match three following criteria: 1)
each pair is in the HPIV positive dataset; 2) each protein
contains more than one domain; 3) each pair contains at
least one iPfam domain-domain interaction. We also generated another "gold-standard" negative dataset containing 595 non-interacting protein pairs from the HPIV
negative dataset. Compared to other simple approaches
[39,40], HPIV applied a more sophisticated way to identify non-interacting protein pairs by multiple evidences
such as functional, localization, expression and homology-based data [38].

Evaluation of the GAIA algorithm
The performance of the scoring method was measured by
the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and
the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The area under the curve
was calculated by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. ROC curve
provides us an indicator of the sensitivity and how it is
affected by the specificity. The area under the curve highlights discrimination (i.e., the ability of correctly classifying those interacting and non-interacting proteins). The
ROC curve was generated by calculating the true positive
rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1-specificity)
at the different thresholds on scores derived from PPIs
and DDIs in the network, and combined scores from both
kinds of interactions against the "gold-standard" data set.
If the number of hits of any domain pair in a protein pair
was above the threshold and it was in the DDIs of positive
portion of the "gold-standard" data set, then it was

regarded as a true positive. Alternatively, if it was not in
the positive portion of the "gold-standard" dataset, then it
was a false positive. If the number of hits of a domain pair
in a protein pair was below the threshold and it was in the
negative portion of the "gold-standard" data set, then it
was regarded as a true negative. Alternatively, if it was not
in the negative portion of the "gold-standard" data set,
then it was a false negative.
