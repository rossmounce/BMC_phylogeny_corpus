Abstract
Background: Despite their involvement in the regulation of gene expression and their importance
as genomic markers for promoter prediction, no objective standard exists for defining CpG islands
(CGIs), since all current approaches rely on a large parameter space formed by the thresholds of
length, CpG fraction and G+C content.
Results: Given the higher frequency of CpG dinucleotides at CGIs, as compared to bulk DNA, the
distance distributions between neighboring CpGs should differ for bulk and island CpGs. A new
algorithm (CpGcluster) is presented, based on the physical distance between neighboring CpGs on
the chromosome and able to predict directly clusters of CpGs, while not depending on the
subjective criteria mentioned above. By assigning a p-value to each of these clusters, the most
statistically significant ones can be predicted as CGIs. CpGcluster was benchmarked against five
other CGI finders by using a test sequence set assembled from an experimental CGI library.
CpGcluster reached the highest overall accuracy values, while showing the lowest rate of falsepositive predictions. Since a minimum-length threshold is not required, CpGcluster can find short
but fully functional CGIs usually missed by other algorithms. The CGIs predicted by CpGcluster
present the lowest degree of overlap with Alu retrotransposons and, simultaneously, the highest
overlap with vertebrate Phylogenetic Conserved Elements (PhastCons). CpGcluster's CGIs
overlapping with the Transcription Start Site (TSS) show the highest statistical significance, as
compared to the islands in other genome locations, thus qualifying CpGcluster as a valuable tool in
discriminating functional CGIs from the remaining islands in the bulk genome.
Conclusion: CpGcluster uses only integer arithmetic, thus being a fast and computationally efficient
algorithm able to predict statistically significant clusters of CpG dinucleotides. Another outstanding
feature is that all predicted CGIs start and end with a CpG dinucleotide, which should be
appropriate for a genomic feature whose functionality is based precisely on CpG dinucleotides. The
only search parameter in CpGcluster is the distance between two consecutive CpGs, in contrast to
previous algorithms. Therefore, none of the main statistical properties of CpG islands (neither
G+C content, CpG fraction nor length threshold) are needed as search parameters, which may
lead to the high specificity and low overlap with spurious Alu elements observed for CpGcluster
predictions.

Background
Given the inherent mutability of methylated cytosine, the
human genome has only a fraction (≈ 20%) of the CpG
dinucleotides expected on the basis of its G+C content
[1,2]. However, the resulting scarcity of CpGs is not uniform throughout the chromosome: there are many DNA
tracts (CpG islands or CGIs), totaling 1% of the genome,
where CpGs are abundant [3-6]. The lack of methylation
at CGIs, together with their elevated G+C content relative
to the genome average, results in a frequency of CpG
dinucleotides that is about 10-fold higher than in bulk
DNA [5,6]. About 60% of all genes have a CGI, normally
unmethylated, in their promoter region [2,6,7]. However,
in some physiological or pathological situations promoter-associated CGIs can be methylated, then provoking
a change in the expression of the associated gene [8-11].
The maintenance of a particular genomic pattern of methylated CpGs provides an epigenetic means for differential
regulation of gene expression [2,7,12].
Approximately 80% of all CpGs are methylated in human
and mouse genomes, which makes the hypomethylated
and GC-rich CGIs an outstanding genomic property.
Given their putative function in gene regulation and their
importance as genomic markers in promoter prediction,
over recent years there has been a considerable effort to
predict CGIs in silico. Current algorithms (newcpgreport
[13]; cpg [14]; CpGProD [15]; CpGIS [16,17]; CpGIE [18];
CpGED [19]) rely on the ad hoc thresholds of length, CpG
O/E ratio and G+C content early defined by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer [20]. These three thresholds lead to a
parameter space which is relatively large and difficult to
explore completely. Consequently, in many publications,
these parameters have been fine-tuned in different ways for example, to filter out spurious Alu elements or restricting the prediction to putative promoter CGIs. However, in
every fine-tuning, "valid" CGIs also become filtered out,
as a consequence of using the same parameters for both
prediction and filtering; this suggests the use of different
parameters in both steps, as proposed below in the CpG-

cluster algorithm. Another shortcoming, shared by the
algorithms using the conventional moving-window
approach (newcpgreport, CpGProdD, CpGIS and CpGIE),
but not by the cpg script (which uses compositional segmentation) or CpGED (which uses a sliding double window), is that the island boundaries cannot be accurately
defined to single base-pair resolution. As is well known
(see, for example [21]), the methods using a moving window add another level of subjectivity in choosing both the
length of the window and the step size. Taking this problem into account, the algorithm CpGcluster is able to predict the island boundaries to a single base-pair resolution
by definition.
Bulk CpGs are thought to be in a dynamic equilibrium
between the decay of methylated CpGs and the generation
of new ones due to point mutations [2]. This is a random
process and therefore the CpG distance distributions
should be strikingly different for bulk and island CpGs,
which motivated our approach. In particular, the distances between consecutive bulk CpGs, as the result of a
random process, should follow the geometric distribution, while the distance distribution for in-island CpGs
must contain information on the high local clustering.
Taking advantage of this high local clustering of CpG
dinucleotides at CGIs, CpGcluster directly predicts clusters
of CpGs on the chromosome. Predicted clusters with high
enough statistical significance can then be identified as
CGIs (see Methods).

Results
Benchmarking CpGcluster
The accuracy of CpGcluster was evaluated by comparing it
to five commonly used CGI finder programs (Table 1). To
benchmark the programs, a set of test sequences containing experimentally determined CGIs in a random background was assembled, as described in the Methods
section. As in the gene-finding field [22], the accuracy of a
prediction was measured by comparing the predicted
island value (island or non-island) with the true island

value for each nucleotide along the test sequence, then
deriving estimates for Sensitivity (Sn, the proportion of
island nucleotides that have been correctly predicted as
islands), Specificity (Sp, the proportion of predicted
island nucleotides that are actually islands; this measure is
also known as Positive Predictive Value, or PPV) and the
Correlation Coefficient (CC, a single scalar value that
summarizes Sn and Sp as a measure of global accuracy).
The averaged values over ten test sequences, each with 400
experimental islands randomly distributed over a randomized sequence, are shown in Table 1. When the threshold distance was set to the median of the observed
distribution, CpGcluster showed moderate values for Sn,
while reaching the highest ones for both CC and Sp. The
high specificity achieved by our algorithm indicates that it
has the lowest rate of false-positive predictions (i.e. only
2.4% of the predicted nucleotides turned out actually not
to be part of a CGI).
For these results, the median distance between neighbor
CpGs and a p-value cutoff of 10-5 were used to run CpGcluster. As shown in the last row of Table 1, the raising of the
distance threshold to the 75th percentile, thereby obtaining longer islands, increased sensitivity by more than 20%
while only minimally improving overall accuracy. However, this led to a smaller fraction of CGI overlapping with
PhastCons (shown below). On the other hand, lowering
the p-value threshold beyond 10-5 slightly increased Sp but
also clearly decreased Sn, thus lowering overall global
accuracy (not shown). Consequently, the median distance
was used as the only parameter for the island prediction
and the 10-5 cutoff for the filtering in all subsequent analyses.
Finally, we examined another accuracy indicator, the Hit
percentage, which gives the proportion of experimental

CGIs which have been at least partially overlapped by the
predicted islands. Table 1 shows that CpGcluster "hits" a
higher number of islands than any other algorithm. This
highest partial overlap (at least the core region of the CGI
is predicted), together with the highest specificity mentioned above, might indicate an advantage of CpGcluster
over the other tested algorithms.
Statistical analysis of predicted islands in human and
mouse genomes
Basic statistics of the CGIs predicted by CpGcluster in the
human (hg17) and mouse (mm7) genome assemblies are
shown in Table 2. For comparison, this Table also
includes an analysis of the islands predicted by CpGProD.
The number of CGIs predicted by CpGcluster in both
genomes is higher, and their average length shorter than
those predicted by CpGProD or the ones previously
reported in the literature (see, for example, [6]). Some of
the short CGIs predicted by CpGcluster might be spurious,
but some others may play a true functional role (see
below). The spurious fraction may be due, for example, to
the presence of arginine-rich exons, which are then rich in
CGN codons, and therefore are prone to erroneous identification as CGIs. Comparing our prediction to annotated
exon boundaries, we estimated this fraction to be relatively low (only about 3.4% of the predicted CGIs in the
human genome correspond actually with exons).

The hypothesis that some short CGIs could be truly functional is based on the fact that many known functional
CGIs are shorter than commonly assumed -the extreme
example being Xenopus CGIs, which are known to be
shorter and have a lower G+C content than the CGIs
found in mammals [23]. However, short and functional
CGIs exist also in the human genome. One example concerns the CGI of the human tissue-specific SERPINB5

gene. The promoter of this gene is associated with a GCrich region that, while fulfilling the conventional %G+C
and CpG fraction defining criteria for CGIs, is significantly
shorter than the average [24] and consequently goes
unnoticed in most annotations [2]. To our knowledge,
CpGcluster is the only algorithm capable of catching the
core of this fully functional CGI [see Additional file 1]. A
second example refers to MAGE genes, which are found as
antigens in a wide variety of tumors, and become methylated during normal mammalian development. They have
a CpG-rich region 300–650 bp long at their 5' end that,
although shorter than average CGIs, remains nonmethylated in sperm but methylated in somatic tissues, where
the genes are not expressed. Therefore, these genes represent clear examples of tissue-specific genes that use DNA
methylation as a primary mechanism for their regulation
[25]. The ability to detect the CpG-rich regions enabling
this type of regulation is an important measure of quality
for any CGI finder and was tested on ten MAGE genes having known TSS (Table 3). Our algorithm detected CGIs in
eight of the ten MAGE genes analyzed, while the number
of islands reported by the other programs in this gene set
was significantly lower.
The minimum length of a functional CGI is a difficult
question, but insights can be derived from recent
advances in mapping functional promoters. The shortest
island in our prediction which overlaps with a TSS from
DBTSS is 33 bp in length. When functional promoters are
determined through ChIP-on-chip technology [26], that
length goes down to 13 bp. Finally, when promoters are
determined by using the cap analysis of gene expression
(CAGE) approach [27] the minimum island length is just
11 bp long, thus approaching the minimum lengths
observed in both DerLab and CpGcluster databases. Thus,
it seems that even very short islands may be functional.
Also, it bears mentioning that short islands (<200 bp) predicted by CpGcluster which overlap with a TSS also show a
very high degree of overlap (37%) with conserved elements (see below), thus suggesting probable biological
relevance.

Further insight into the possible role of short CGIs is suggested by the recent finding of CpG "islets", genomic
regions that are not conventionally classified as CpG
islands because of their short length (<200 bp), but have
a GC content and observed-to-expected CpG ratio that is
characteristic of a CpG island. CpG islets may be nonmethylated, corresponding to sites of active transcription
and/or boundaries that separate major centromeric chromatin sub-domains [28].
All in all, these data support the possibility that genomic
tracts with GC content and CpG Obs/Exp ratios typical of
CGIs, but below the detection threshold of conventional
CGI finders, may have a functional role in the genome.
CpGcluster represents a new tool that may help to
uncover such regions.
Minimal overlap between CGIs predicted by CpGcluster
and Alu retrotransposons
A major source of uncertainty in CGI prediction is the
interference of Alu retrotransposons. These elements,
abundant in primate genomes, have often been falsely
identified as CGIs by conventional CGI finders. To cope
with this problem, some authors [15,16,18] have proposed a simple increment in the value of some of the
thresholds used. The drawback of such a strategy is that
some CGIs associated with genes would also be excluded
under these more stringent criteria. Even so, the fraction
of Alu overlap shown by the islands predicted by most
programs is still rather large, while CpGcluster's CGIs demonstrate the least amount of overlap with Alu elements
(Table 3). We wish to stress especially that CpGcluster does
not need any minimum-length criterion to exclude a
higher proportion of Alu elements than any of the previously existing algorithms tested.

tion. Therefore, if the predicted CGIs truly play a
functional role, they should show a high degree of overlap
with vertebrate PhastCons [29]. Taking advantage of the
'most conserved' track (based on the best-in-genome pairwise alignments between human and other seven vertebrate genomes) at UCSC Genome Browser [30], we
computed the percentage of overlap between PhastCons
and the CGIs predicted by the different finders. As seen in
Table 3, the islands predicted by CpGcluster show the highest degree of overlap with PhastCons, thus indicating that
our algorithm predicts a higher proportion of evolutionarily conserved, functionally relevant CGIs than does any
other tested algorithm.
Promoter and CpG island co-location
For a further quality assessment for the islands predicted
by CpGcluster, we assigned them to five classes according
to their co-location with annotated genes from the RefSeq
database [31]. The classification proposed by Ioshikhes
and Zhang [32] was improved by using exon boundaries
(instead of absolute positions) to define the different
classes. Accordingly, we divided CGIs into five classes
defined as follows: L1, the island overlaps with the TSS;
L2, the island does not overlap with the TSS but is located
somewhere between 2 kb upstream of the TSS and the end
of the first exon; L3, the island is located somewhere
between the end of the first exon and the start of the last
exon; L4, the island is located between the start of the last
exon and 2 kb downstream of the Transcription End Site
(TES); NG, the island is outside the gene environment.

Most of the islands predicted by CpGcluster are located
outside of the gene environment (Table 4). Only 56750
(or 28.7%) in humans and 40348 (or 34.9%) in mice are
within or around the genes. Note, however, that the curate
samples of RefSeq genes used in elaborating this table represent less than half of the existing genes in both species.
When we analyzed the entire RefSeq database without any
filtering, these percentages rose to 53.4% and 47.2%,
respectively. When Genscan gene predictions, another
well-known gene-finder track available at the UCSC
Genome Browser, were considered, the percentages rose
to 83.4% and 82.2%, respectively. These results indicate
that a substantial fraction of the CGIs predicted by CpGcluster may overlap the putative, non yet confirmed genes
predicted by this popular gene-finder.
Table 4 also shows that both in humans and in mice CpGcluster predicts drastically different islands as a function of
genomic location: promoter CGIs (L1) are longer and
have lower p-values than do the rest of the classes. Another
important observation is that both in humans and mice,
promoter CGIs are much richer in vertebrate PhastCons
elements than are non-genic islands (NG).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/446

In addition, two surprising observations were made in the
mouse genome: 1) promoter islands have smaller CpG
densities and CpG fractions than non-genic islands have;
and 2) L4 islands, located mainly in the 3' untranslated
regions (3' UTRs), show a high proportion of PhastCons
overlap. It is well known that when mouse and human
orthologous genes are compared, the mouse line shows a
net loss of CpG islands [6]. This probably indicates a
higher "pressure" on CGIs in mice, which may account for
these findings.
For a comparison, we also analyzed the co-location of
genes with the CGIs predicted by CpGProD (Table 5). As
shown in Table 2, the statistical properties of the CGIs predicted by this finder are quite similar for mouse and
human. However, as shown in Tables 2 and 4, CpGcluster
predicts islands with striking differences between human
and mouse, especially when looking at the co-location
with genes. For example, mouse CGIs overlapping with
TSS have lower CpG densities and Obs/Exp ratios than
non-genic islands. We interpret these as being the true statistical properties of those islands (overlapping with a
TSS), as CpGcluster does not predetermine these values in
the detection process.

Discussion
"Stretches of DNA with a high G+C content, and a frequency
of CpG dinucleotides close to the expected value, appear as CpG
clusters within the CpG-depleted bulk DNA, and are now generally known as CpG islands". This original description of
CpG islands by Gardiner and Frommer in 1987 [20] formulates the basic idea underlying the present work: CpG
dinucleotides appear clustered within the CpG-depleted
bulk DNA and these clusters should be able to be associated with CpG islands. In the same work [20], the above
authors also proposed a criterion for CpG islands based
on thresholds which later became the basic principle of
practically all existing CpG island finders. They justify
these criteria by assuming that CpG-rich regions over 200 bp
in length are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, which
points out another important property of CpG islands
implemented in this work: the statistical significance.
Some years before, McClelland and Ivarie [3] had introduced a Chi-square test to assign a statistical significance
to CpG islands. Therefore, our approach is probably more
related to the original perception of CpG islands as statistically significant CpG clusters within CpG-depleted
regions.
Both our distance approach (which directly predicts CpG
clusters) and the threshold approach are derived from the
same original idea stating that the CpGs form clusters in
the genome. However, the main disadvantage of any
threshold approach is that generally valid CpG islands
may become discarded as well, an effect that is aggravated

as the dimension of the parameter space grows. In our distance approach, we reduced the parameter space notably,
furthermore linking the distance parameter to intrinsic
statistical properties of the sequence. The chosen median
distance between two CpGs in a given chromosome separates fairly well the CpG clustering from the inter-cluster
distances (see Fig. 1) and therefore affords certain objectivity to the choice of this parameter. Note furthermore
that the median distance is correlated to the G+C content
of the chromosome sequence. The higher the G+C content
of the chromosome, the higher the probability that a CpG
appears and consequently the lower will be the median
distance. In this way, the median distance adjusts itself to
the global conditions dictated by the given input

sequence. This can hardly be achieved using the conventional large-dimension threshold parameter space and
therefore, in previous work, the same threshold values
were used indiscriminately for all the chromosomes.
The first consequence of the difference between the distance and threshold approaches is that, on average, CpGcluster islands are shorter. However, they show higher
mean G+C content, CpG density, and CpG fractions than
do any of the other five tested algorithms (Table 2). The
lower values shown by these threshold-based algorithms
may be an inherited consequence of the general approach
shared by most of them. To some extent, the chosen
thresholds predetermine the statistical properties of the

islands, since these usually become enlarged as long as the
thresholds are not violated. This threshold-dependent
enlargement in the search process may also lead to the
observed over-prediction of CpG islands and high Alu
overlap shown by most threshold-based algorithms. On
the contrary, CpGcluster overcomes this drawback since
statistical properties of the CGIs, such as G+C content or
CpG fraction are not used as search parameters. Note furthermore that the p-value is a crucial filter parameter to
sort out spurious Alu elements. Young Alus have p-values
around 10-7 (with slight variations among chromosomes); therefore, the high substitution rates on the Alu
CpG sites produce a fast loss of statistical significance,
which explains the low overlap with spurious Alu elements shown by the islands predicted by CpGcluster.
Finally, we wish to discuss briefly the lack of any length
filter in CpGcluster which allows the prediction of
extremely short islands and which, at first glance, could be
interpreted as a disadvantage. It should be noted that in
all of the previous algorithms the length is not used for
prediction purposes, and is considered only in the final
filtering process. In fact, the original idea of the length
threshold was to guarantee that the predicted islands are
not just a mere product of chance alone. Instead, we

change the length filter by a statistically stricter criterion:
the p-value. In this way, all predicted CGIs are statistically
significant CpG clusters. We are aware that the putative
functional CGIs are on average very long (as for example
the L1 class in Table 4). However, it is important to stress
the conceptual difference between the detection of CpG
clusters and the subsequent filtering for a particular subset
(e.g. promoter overlapping CGIs). These two steps should
be clearly distinguished.

Conclusion
The distance-based CGI-finder algorithm described here
presents three outstanding features: i) all the predicted
CGIs start and end with a CpG dinucleotide; ii) all the
computations needed use integer arithmetic, thus leading
to a fast and computationally efficient CGI finder, and iii)
a p-value is associated with each of the predicted islands.
When compared to other CGI finders,CpGcluster is able to
predict CGIs with the highest global accuracy and specificity, thus indicating a low rate of false-positive predictions. Short but fully functional CGIs are also predicted by
CpGcluster. Furthermore, the degree of overlap of predicted CGIs with Alu retrotransposons is minimal, while
the overlap with vertebrate PhastCons is maximal. The
promoter CGIs predicted by CpGcluster also show the

highest statistical significance, thus qualifying CpGcluster
as a valuable tool to distinguish functional CGIs from the
remaining islands in the bulk genome.

Methods
The algorithm CpGcluster presented in this work consists
of two main steps: i) a distance-based algorithm searches
for clusters of CpGs in the chromosome sequence. ii) a pvalue is associated with each of these clusters, then predicting as CGIs only those clusters with large enough statistical significance (i.e. for which their p-values are below the
selected threshold). These two steps are explained in
detail in the next subsections.

CpG cluster-searching algorithm
The cluster-searching method is based on the statistical
properties of the physical distances between neighboring
CpG dinucleotides on the DNA sequence. In principle, if
CpGs are distributed totally at random along the chromosome sequence, the distances between neighboring CpG
dinucleotides should follow the geometric distribution:

P(d) = (1 - p)d-1 p

[1]

where P(d) represents the probability of finding a distance
d between neighboring CpGs and p corresponds to the
probability of CpGs in the sequence, calculated as the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/446

ratio between CpGs and the total number of dinucleotides
in the DNA sequence.
The working hypothesis behind the cluster-searching
algorithm is that the abundant CpGs in CGIs may be separated by shorter distances (thereby forming clusters)
than the distances between bulk CpGs, which in principle
should follow the geometric distribution [Eq. 1].
To test our working hypothesis, in Figure 1 we represent
the normalized probability distribution of distances
between neighboring CpGs corresponding to human
chromosome 1 (Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5 show the normalized probabilities of distances for all the human chromosomes). The median/mean values of CpG distances for
all chromosomes are shown in Table 6. Figure 1 shows
that short distances are over-represented when compared
to the geometric distribution, while intermediate distances are less abundant than the theoretical random

expectations. Large distances are also over-represented
when compared to the geometric distribution. For a clear
display of these features, in Figure 2 we represent the same
as in Figure 1, but using logarithmic axis: distances below
40 bp (the median) and above 300 bp are over-represented, while the intermediate values are under-represented. Both facts clearly indicate strong clustering: the
abundant short distances separate intra-cluster CpGs
while the large distances (also more abundant than randomly expected) separate the clusters themselves.
Therefore, the DNA sequence was scanned looking for the
presence of such CpG clusters. The algorithm performs
the following steps:
1. The DNA chromosome sequence is scanned for CpG
dinucleotides, then recording the positions occupied by
the 'C': x1, x2 ... xN, N being the total number of CpGs in
the sequence. The sequence was usually scanned in the 5'

→ 3' direction. Trivially, the reverse scan (3' → 5') produces the same results.
2. As a convention, the physical distance separating two
neighboring CpGs is defined as:
di = xi+1 - xi - 1,

[2]

so that the minimal distance between two neighboring
CpGs (i.e. CGCG) is equal to 1.
3. In the course of the scan, the first distance below a given
threshold (dt) identifies the first CpG cluster. The threshold dt can be conveniently derived from the distribution of
distances between neighboring CpGs in the chromosome
sequence. The median distance (Figs. 1, 2) often gives the
best results because the median distance of the observed
distribution is approximately at the transition point of the
over-represented (intra-cluster) small distances and the
under-represented intermediate ones. This is not an exclusive property of chromosome 1, as it is shared by all the
chromosomes (see Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5), thus indicating that the median distance can be chosen in general
as a good threshold (dt).

cess or failure) and gives the probability of having a certain number of failures when the number of successes was
fixed in advance, taking into account that the experiment
must always end with a success. By translating these
requirements to a genomic context, the successes were
equated with CpG dinucleotides and the failures with
non-CpGs (all other 15 possible dinucleotides). One prerequisite is that all trials be independent, which is not
automatically fulfilled when dealing with overlapping
dinucleotides (note that a CpG dinucleotide will always
be followed by a non-CpG [GN] dinucleotide). Therefore,
these "forced" non-CpGs need to be considered when calculating the success probabilities. Thus, the probability
for a cluster with a number (N) of CpGs is given by
⎛ n f − (N + 1) − 1 ⎞ N −1
n
PN ,p (n f ) = ⎜
⋅ (1 − p) f
⎜ (N − 1) − 1 ⎟ ⋅ p
⎟
⎝
⎠

[ 3]

This formula takes into account that all our clusters start
with a CpG, and therefore the number of successes is N-1
(instead of N, the number of CpGs in the cluster). The
number of independent non-CpGs (nf) in a cluster (failures) can be calculated as:

4. We then try to extend this first cluster downstream (→
3') by adding the next CpG while the distances are below
dt. When a distance exceeding dt is found, the cluster is
completed, and the search for a new one continues downstream.

nf = L - 2 · N

5. Steps 3 and 4 are iterated until all the CpG clusters in
the sequence are identified.

p=

Note that this algorithm acquires two important and distinctive features by construction. First, all predicted CGIs
start and end with a CpG dinucleotide, which seems
appropriate. Secondly, the algorithm uses only integer
arithmetic, thus being computationally efficient. No other
CGI searching algorithm shares these two important
properties.

Ns being the number of CpG dinucleotides in the
sequence and nis the number of independent dinucleotides (i.e. including the CpGs but excluding the forced
non-CpGs). The theoretical probabilities determined by
this analytical method agree well with those found by
numerical simulation, as shown in Additional file 6.
Given its lower computational cost, the theoretical
approach was implemented in our software.

Assigning p-values to CpG-clusters
Once all the CpG clusters are found in the sequence following the algorithm described above, the next step is to
associate a p-value with each one – i.e. the probability of
such a cluster appearing by chance in a random sequence.
Such a probability can be estimated either numerically by
a randomization test on the DNA sequence or by means
of a theoretical probability function (both cases shown in
Additional file 6). For the latter case, the negative binomial distribution (also known as Pascal or Pólya distribution) can be conveniently tailored to the requirements of
CpG clusters. In general, this distribution can be applied
to experiments with dichotomous outcomes (either suc-

probability p (probability of finding a CpG) is calculated

[ 5]

The negative binomial is a two-tailed distribution (Additional file 6). The left tail indicates a high local CpG clustering (accumulation of CpGs) while the right tail is
comprised of CpG-depleted regions. Therefore, the probability that an observed local CpG frequency is significantly higher than those expected under random
conditions (CpG clustering) is given by the cumulative
density function of the CpG cluster at point nf, which can
therefore be taken as its p-value:

The use of this latter expression allows us to discriminate
between the clusters found in the first step of the algorithm: those clusters with a p-value below a given threshold (usually 10-5, see Section "Benchmarking CpGcluster")
are predicted as CGIs, while the rest of the clusters are discarded.

Assembling test sequences containing CpG islands
To evaluate the accuracy of CpGcluster and compare it to
other programs, we assembled a set of test sequences on
the basis of an experimental CGI library [33]. This physical library was constructed using a two-step cloning strategy involving the isolation of GC-rich chromosomal
fragments based on their lack of methylation in vivo, followed by an enrichment of fragments that could be methylated in vitro. The following steps were taken to assemble
the test sequences:

(1) The full list of DerLab CGIs [33] was retrieved. These
experimental CGIs can be quite short and the minimum
length is actually 8. Out of the 6235 CGIs, 1612 (or 26 %)
were shorter than 200 bp. The experimental islands were
then divided into two groups: those that overlapped with
the TSS and those that did not. The TSS coordinates were
taken from the DBTSS database [34]. These two groups
differed significantly in their mean length, CpG density,
and CpG fraction, with all values being higher for the TSS
group. In assembling the test sequences, we exclusively
used the TSS group, which had a greater average length.

(2) In addition, non-island sequences – the sequences
located between the CGIs of chromosome 22, as specified
by the UCSC annotation [30] – were extracted.
(3) To further ensure a random background for the CGIs
in our test sequences, all non-island segments were randomly shuffled using an algorithm that preserves dinucleotide frequencies [35]. As non-island segments could
contain some non-annotated CGIs, this step ensures the
randomness of the non-island segments, at the same time
conserving nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions.
This setup is the less biased, as none of the finders is
expected to predict CGIs on randomized sequences.

(4) The shuffled non-island segments were then alternatively combined with 400 island segments overlapping
with TSS, chosen at random from the DerLab sample, thus
assembling a test sequence of approximately 18 Mb in
length.
(5) Using the assembling process described in step (4), we
generated a set of 10 test sequences containing experimental CGIs alternating with shuffled non-island segments.
