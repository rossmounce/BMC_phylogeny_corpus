Abstract
Background: Sulphur compounds like cysteine, methionine and S-adenosylmethionine are
essential for the viability of most cells. Thus many organisms have developed a complex regulatory
circuit that governs the expression of enzymes involved in sulphur assimilation and metabolism. In
the filamentous fungus Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) little is known about the
participants in this circuit.
Results: Analyses of proteins binding to the cellulase activating element (CAE) within the
promotor of the cellobiohydrolase cbh2 gene led to the identification of a putative E3 ubiquitin
ligase protein named LIMPET (LIM1), which is an orthologue of the sulphur regulators SCON-2 of
Neurospora crassa and Met30p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription of lim1 is specifically upregulated upon sulphur limitation and responds to cellulase inducing conditions. In addition, light
dependent stimulation/shut down of cellulase gene transcription by methionine in the presence of
sulphate was observed. Further, lim1 transcriptionally reacts to a switch from constant darkness to
constant light and is subject to regulation by the light regulatory protein ENVOY. Thus lim1, despite
its function in sulphur metabolite repression, responds both to light as well as sulphur- and carbon
source. Upon growth on cellulose, the uptake of sulphate is dependent on the light status and
essential for growth in light. Unlike other fungi, growth of H. jecorina is not inhibited by selenate
under low sulphur conditions, suggesting altered regulation of sulphur metabolism. Phylogenetic
analysis of the five sulphate permeases found in the genome of H. jecorina revealed that the
predominantly mycelial sulphate permease is lacking, thus supporting this hypothesis.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that the significance of the sulphate/methionine-related signal with
respect to cellulase gene expression is dependent on the light status and reaches beyond detection
of sulphur availability.

Background
Gene transcription in filamentous fungi is influenced by a
variety of external stimuli. Adaptation to nutrient conditions is one of them. Many sulphur compounds, especially cysteine, methionine and S-adenosylmethionine are
essential for the viability of most cells [1]. Thus, many
organisms have developed a complex regulatory circuit
that governs the expression of enzymes involved in sulphur assimilation and metabolism. Appropriate mechanisms have been discussed in the filamentous fungi
Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa as well as the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (reviewed by [1]). Neurospora crassa CYS3 [2] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Met4
[3] were described as positive-acting regulators of an
entire set of genes involved in sulphur metabolism.
SCONB in Aspergillus nidulans [4,5], SCON2 in Neurospora
crassa [6,7] and Met30 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [8] on
the other hand were identified as negative regulators. In
recent years, the regulatory machinery of sulphur metabolism has been shown to be embedded in a more complex
network, which also involves response to heavy metals [9]
and is influenced by the supply of carbon and nitrogen in
plants [10]. The SCF-ubiquitin-ligase complex SCF(Met30)
participates in cadmium-induced regulation of the transcription factor Met4 [11] and thereby initiates a system
wide cellular response. This SCF-ubiquitin ligase complex
is also presumed to contribute to the detoxification of cadmium by increasing the glutathion levels needed for complexing this toxic heavy metal [12,13]. A similar
mechanism is likely to be at work for detoxification of
arsenate [14] and selenate [15].
The filamentous fungus Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) is to date the most important industrial
producer of cellulases [16-18]. Nevertheless, the genome
of this fungus comprises a lower number of genes encoding these degradative enzymes than found in other filamentous fungi [19]. The importance of cellulases as
indispensable reagents in industries like the pulp and
paper industry, detergent industry or clothing industry
gives rise to attempts for elucidating the mechanisms
lying behind cellulose signalling to cellulase gene expression in H. jecorina. Remarkable effort had thus been put
into elucidation of the mechanisms involved in regulation of cellulase gene expression. Besides cellulose, also
lactose and sophorose promote cellulase gene expression,
while glycerol does neither promote nor prevent it. Formation of cellulases is regulated at the transcriptional
level, and the expression of the different cellulase genes
has been reported to be coordinate [20]. However, little is
known still about how the cellulose signal from outside
the cell is transduced to initiate production of the appropriate hydrolytic enzymes. The first signal transduction
protein to be identified in the respective signalling pathway was the light regulatory protein ENVOY [21], which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/174

also lead to the finding that cellulase gene expression is
modulated by light. Subsequent analyses revealed that
this protein influences several regulatory pathways in H.
jecorina and that its function is not limited to light
response [22].
Studies on the promotors of the cellulase genes provide a
thorough basis to climb up the signal transduction cascade starting from the target: Using cell-free extracts from
sophorose-induced and non-induced mycelia as well as
various fragments of the promotor sequence of the H. jecorina cellobiohydrolase cbh2, the nucleotide sequence 5'ATTGGGTAATA-3' was found to bind different protein
complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
under the respective conditions [23]. The mentioned
sequence was named cbh2-activating element CAE. The
presence of an intact copy of this motif was shown to be
required for protein binding and wild-type levels of cbh2
transcript [23]. While the HAP2/3/5 complex of H. jecorina was found to bind to the CCAAT-box of the cellulase
activating element CAE within the cbh2 promoter [24] the
factor(s) binding to the second part of the motif therein,
which shows an even stronger regulatory effect (50%
decrease in transcription efficiency upon mutation to 5'
ATTGGGTTTTA 3') than the CCAAT-box, have not been
described.
The transcriptional regulation of cellulase gene expression
has been subject to extensive research [20,25], and among
the regulatory factors of this process, ACE2 [26], and
XYR1 [27,28] have been shown to bind to sequence
motifs related yet not similar to CAE in the promotors of
cbh1 (ACE2; 5' GGCTAATAA 3') or xyn1 (XYR1; 5'
GGCTAA 3'). Despite the fact that their binding to CAE
within the cbh2 promotor has not been proven yet, they
are likely to contact this motif due to their involvement in
regulation of cbh2 expression.
Our study was aimed at a more detailed understanding of
cellulase gene regulation at the promotor level. Application of the Yeast One Hybrid System should identify the
regulatory factor(s) binding to CAE. Surprisingly, we
found a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, the homologues of
which are involved in regulation of sulphur metabolism,
to bind to this regulatory sequence. This result led to the
hypothesis that sulphur signaling/metabolism and regulation could be interconnected processes. In order to test
this hypothesis we used different cultivation conditions
appropriate to delineate the involvement of this E3 ubiquitin ligase in both processes and more importantly the
role of the sulphur source with respect to cellulose utilization in H. jecorina in general. We show that the respective
gene not only responds to cellulase inducing conditions
and to light, but also – as expected – to a decrease in sulphur availability. Since methionine seems to have a spe-

cific function in regulation of cellulase gene expression
under defined sulphur conditions, we tested its effect
under conditions commonly used to analyse this process.
Indeed, the strong light-dependent effect of increased
methionine levels seen under defined sulphur conditions
also occurs under these conditions i. e. in the presence of
sulphate and peptone. Moreover, we detected a role of sulphate in cellulose utilization, but not glucose utilization
in light. Subsequent screening of the H. jecorina genome
for the presence of sulphate permeases revealed the lack of
a homologue to the N. crassa predominantly mycelial sulphate permease CYS-14.

Methods
Microbial strains and culture conditions
H. jecorina (T. reesei) strain QM9414 (ATCC 26921),
which is a second generation high cellulase producing
mutant strain of wild-type QM6a and is commonly used
for studies on this fungus representing wild-type conditions as well as the recombinant strain env1PAS-, which is
lacking the PAS domain of the light regulatory protein
ENVOY [21] were used throughout this study. H. jecorina
was grown in submerged culture at 28°C in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) in 200 ml of
Mandels Andreotti minimal medium [29]. 1% (w/v) of
the carbon sources indicated with the respective experiments was used. 108 conidia/l (final concentration) were
used as inoculum. The replacement technique described
by Sternberg and Mandels [30] was applied for inducing
cellulase formation in mycelia by 1.5 mM sophorose
(final concentration), as described previously [23,31].

The medium for cultivation under sulphur limitation conditions contained the respective chlorides instead of the
sulphates used in conventional Mandels Andreotti
medium and was prepared as follows: The modified trace
element solution contained 0.243 g/l FeCl3·6H2O (0.90
mM), 0.050 g/l MnCl2·2H2O (0.31 mM), 0.033 g/l ZnCl2
(0.24 mM) and 0.100 g/l CoCl2·6H2O (0.42 mM) and
the pH was adjusted to 2.0 with hydrochloric acid. The
mineral salt solution contained 2.27 g/l NH4Cl (42 mM),
4.00 g/l KH2PO4 (29 mM), 0.50 g/l MgCl2·6H2O (2 mM),
0.80 g/l CaCl2·2H2O (5 mM) and 0.6 g/l urea (10 mM).
A 0.1 M phosphate buffer was prepared using a solution
with 35.6 g/l Na2HPO4·2H2O (0.2 M) and 0.2 M citric
acid was added to adjust a pH of 5.0 (all chemicals by
Merck, Germany). The culture medium was prepared
combining 500 ml mineral salt solution, 480 ml phosphate buffer and 20 ml trace element solution.
As sulphur source, the following three concentrations of
L-methionine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) were used:
0.05 mM, 0.25 mM and 5 mM corresponding to limiting,
low and high sulphur concentration, respectively [5].

Yeast strain YM4271 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–
101, lys2–801, leu2–3, 112, trp1–903, tyr1–501, gal4Δ512, gal80-Δ538, ade5::hisG [32,33] was used as host
strain for the One Hybrid System.
E. coli JM109 [34] was used for the propagation of vector
molecules and DNA manipulations; E. coli ER1647
(Novagen, Madison, WI) was used for plating, titering and
screening of the λ Blue Star gene library; and E. coli strain
BM25.8 (Novagen), which is lysogenic for λ phages, was
used for automatic subcloning. The latter two strains were
grown at 37°C on LB medium supplemented with 0.2%
(w/v) maltose and 10 mM MgSO4 for propagation of λphages. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was
used for the expression of GST fusion proteins according
to the recommendations of the manufacturers.
Nucleic acid isolation and blotting
H. jecorina DNA was isolated as described previously [31].
Yeast and E. coli DNA was isolated as described by Sambrook et al[35]. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium/phenol procedure [36]. Northern blotting was
performed as described previously [31,35]. For transcript
analysis of lim1 the insert of pOHS125 was excised and
used for hybridization. Probes for analysis of transcription of env1, cbh1, cbh2 and 18S rRNA were prepared by
PCR. Densitometric scanning was done using the BIORAD (Hercules, USA) GS-800 calibrated densitometer and
the BIO-RAD Quantity One software for different exposures of the respective film.
Construction of Reporter Plasmids and Yeast strains for
One-hybrid screening
Complementary oligonucleotides with three copies of the
mutated CAE motif (oneH(F) 5' AATTCTCTTTAAAGGGT
AATATACAGCCATCTTTAAAGGGTAATATACAGCCATCT
TTAAAGGGTAATATACAGCCAT 3') containing the functional (GG)GTAATA-sequence and a non-functional
CCAAT box [23] corresponding to positions – 253 to –
220 of the cbh2 promoter were cloned into plasmids
pHISi and pLacZi. For the construction of a negative control plasmid also the (GG)GTAATA sequence was mutated
to (GG)GTTTTA in the oligonucleotide to abolish binding
of the respective proteins [23]. The resulting plasmids
were designated pHISi-CAE and pLacZi-CAE or pHISimCAE, respectively.

A reporter strain HIS-LACZ-CAE for the transformation of
the cDNA library was constructed by integration of pHISiCAE and pLacZi-CAE into yeast strain YM4271. The negative control strain HIS-mCAE was obtained by integration
of pHISi-mCAE into yeast strain YM4271. Plasmids and
yeast strain YM4271 were included in the Matchmaker
One Hybrid system kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, USA).

Construction of an Activation Domain tagged cDNALibrary from H. jecorina by Directional cloning
For preparation of cDNA, mycelia of the wild-type strain
QM9414, grown under cellulase inducing conditions
(sophorose) were used. mRNA was isolated from total
RNA using the PolyATtract mRNA Isolation Kit (Promega,
Madison, USA), and a cDNA library was constructed using
the HybriZAP™ Two-Hybrid cDNA Gigapack® Cloning Kit
(Stratagene Ltd., Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturers instructions. After packaging by the Gigapack III
Gold packaging extract (Stratagene Ltd, Cambridge, UK)
and excision, the cDNA library containing 106 independent clones within the vector pAD-GAL4-2.1 in frame to
the GAL4 activation domain was used in the One Hybrid
System.
Yeast One hybrid Screening of a H. jecorina cDNA Library
The yeast reporter strain HISLACZ-CAE was transformed
using the lithium acetate/ssDNA/PEG method [37]. The
resulting 3 × 105 yeast transformants were plated on his-/
leu- selective media containing 50 mM 3-aminotriazole
(3-AT). The concentration of 50 mM 3-AT was previously
determined to be sufficient to suppress leaky expression of
the marker gene. Positive transformants were additionally
tested for β-galactosidase activity by a filter lift assay
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Matchmaker One-Hybrid system Kit, CLONTECH). Plasmids
from putative positive clones were isolated after homogenization with glass beads, amplified in E. coli JM109 [38],
and retransformed into yeast strain HISLACZ-CAE and
tested for growth in the presence of 50 mM 3-AT. This step
was followed by transformation of plasmids conferring
histidine prototrophy into the negative control strain HISmCAE. The rationale was that the mutation abolishes protein binding in the yeast cell, and positive transformants
should therefore be unable to grow on selective media.
Cloning of chromosomal DNA of H. jecorina
To isolate the corresponding genomic clones, the cDNA
fragment obtained from the experiment was used as probe
to screen a genomic λ Blue Star (Novagen, Madison, Wis.)
library of H. jecorina QM9414. Positive clones were
excised from the phages by automatic subcloning following the instructions of the manufacturer. The sequence
was crosschecked with the Trichoderma reesei Genome
database v2.0 [39].
3' RACE
First strand synthesis was performed using the Reverse
Transcription System (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol at 42°C for 1 hour with
primer RACE-N (5' GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT(AGC) 3'). The
reaction mixture was cleaned up using the QIAquick PCR
Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN). PCR and Nested PCR were per-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/174

formed according to standard protocols using a gene specific primer and primer RACE-N22 (5' GCGTAATACGACT
CACTAT AGG 3').
Determination of biomass formation from cellulose grown
cultures
After 96 hours of growth on microcrystalline cellulose
either in light or in darkness, mycelia were harvested by
centrifugation and 5 ml 0.1 N NaOH were added to the
pellet. The sample was sonicated for 3 minutes and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. Following centrifugation, protein content of the supernatant representing
biomass content of the sample was determined using the
BIO-RAD Protein assay (BIO-RAD, Hercules, US). Samples were analyzed in triplicates from independent cultivations.
Purification of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins
The cDNA-insert encoding aa457 – aa636 of LIM1 as isolated with the One Hybrid system was cloned into vector
pGEX4T-1 (Stratagene). E. coli BL21 (Stratagene) was
transformed with the expression construct. Expression
and purification by glutathione sepharose 4B (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) affinity chromatography was essentially performed as described previously
[40]. Fusion proteins were eluted using 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 10 mM glutathione and 2 mM dithiothreitol. All
protein preparations were stored at -80°C in the presence
of 20% (w/v) glycerol.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as
described by Stangl et al[41]. The oligonucleotides were
end-labelled with (α-32P)-dCTP, using Sequenase version
2.0 (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). After purification by
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis binding was achieved by incubating 5 μg of protein with 5 ng
of labelled fragment at room temperature for 10 min.
GST-elution buffer (see above) containing 20% glycerol
and lacking protein was used as negative control (sample
referred to as free probe).
Phylogenetic analyses
Amino acid sequences were aligned with Clustal X 1.81
[42] and then visually adjusted. Phylogenetic analyses
were performed in MEGA 2.1 using the Minimum Evolution (ME) approach. Reliability of nodes was estimated by
ME bootstrap percentages (BPME) [43] obtained after 500
pseudo-replications.

Results
Identification of a protein that binds to CAE by the Yeast
One Hybrid System
We applied the yeast one hybrid system to identify proteins binding to CAE [23], as this approach allows to

screen for DNA-protein interaction in vivo and thus
bypasses common drawbacks of in vitro experiments such
as altered binding characteristics caused by the experimental conditions or problems with the renaturation of
the proteins in vitro [44-46].
We used a sequence comprising a CCAAT to CCTTT –
mutated CAE motif in order to prevent isolation of HAPcomplex proteins, which bind to this motif [24] as bait
(Figure 1A). Application of the One Hybrid System and
subsequent screening for β-galactosidase activity led to
the isolation of several clones representing proteins putatively binding to the (GG)GTAATA motif. The respective,
positive plasmids were tested by retransformation into
both the reporter strain HIS-LACZ-CAE to confirm DNA
binding and also the negative control strain HIS-mCAE, in
which the binding sequence bait (GG)GTAATA had been
replaced by (GG)GTTTTA (Figure 1A). The latter mutation
has previously been shown to abolish binding of proteins
from cell free extracts of H. jecorina to CAE in vitro and
result in lack of cbh2-gene expression in vivo [23]. In this
control experiment, positive clones showed specific interaction to the wild-type bait (i. e. growth on selective
medium) and no interaction with the mutated bait (i.e.
no growth on selective medium). Plasmid pOHS125A
enabled growth upon transformation into the reporter
strain on selective medium comparable to the transformation control, but not if transformed into the strain comprising the mutated CAE motif (Figure 1B). Hence
binding of the protein encoded on pOHS125A to CAE
was confirmed and the lack of growth upon transformation into the negative control strain showed that this
interaction was specific and was not due to unspecific
binding to the promotor outside the region of interest.
pOHS125A, which contains a 1.057-bp cDNA insert
encoding a putative WD-repeat domain protein, which –
as expected – was in frame with the GAL4 activation
domain of the vector, was chosen for further investigation.
The protein encoded on pOHS125 also binds to CAE in
vitro
Since the protein encoded on pOHS125 was cloned by its
ability to bind to the CAE motif in vivo in the One Hybrid
Assay, we wanted to confirm this result in vitro by Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. To this end, the cDNA-insert
from pOHS125 (encoding aa457 – aa636, which was functional in yeast) was cloned in frame into pGEX4T-1,
expressed in E. coli as GST-fusion protein, purified and
used in gel retardation assays. The EMSA analysis indicated that the fusion protein actually binds to the target
sequence on the oligonucleotide oneH-CAE, albeit the
interaction was very weak (Figure 1C).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/174

LIMPET encodes a WD-Repeat/F-box protein
The 1.057-bp insert of pOHS125 was used to obtain a
genomic clone and the 3' end as contained in pOHS125
was verified by 3'RACE. The predicted gene corresponds
to the predicted protein tre77795 [39] and contains an
open reading frame of 2004 bp interrupted by a 90 bp
intron and encoding a 636 aa protein with a deduced
molecular mass of 71.1 kDa. Despite its isolation on the
basis of its ability to specifically bind to CAE, it lacks any
of the known DNA-binding protein domains. A similar
phenomenon was also reported earlier upon isolation of
an SCF-component by the One Hybrid System [47]. Psort
II analysis of the protein [48] revealed four nuclear localization sequences at amino acids 57, 186,196 and 239
and also predicted it as being localized to the nucleus
according to Reinhardt's method for Cytoplasmatic/
Nuclear discrimination [49]. A cAMP and cGMP dependent phosphorylation site at amino acid position 186 was
found. No N-terminal signal sequence was detected. The
C-terminal part of the protein contains 7 WD repeats (Figure 2) and the N-terminal part contains an F-box, a conserved motif first described by Kumar and Paietta [6]. Bai
et al. [50] recognized that the F-box is a widespread motif
required for protein-protein-interaction. A database
search revealed that the encoded protein shows significant
amino acid homology to several other WD-repeat/F-box
containing proteins, highest identity and similarity
among characterized proteins being obtained with SCON2 of Neurospora crassa [51] (GenBank accession number
Q01277; 58% and 71%, resp.), SconB of Aspergillus nidulans [5], (GenBank accession number Q00659; 57% and
72%, resp.) and S. cerevisiae Met30p (GenBank accession
number NP_012218; 40% and 56%, resp.), all of them
involved in the regulation of sulphur metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis of the 50 best hits in PSI-BLAST [52]
revealed that it occurs at a basal position in a subclade
containing other Sordariomycete proteins including
SCON-2, which is part of a major, strongly supported
clade also containing A. nidulans SconB (data not shown).
The hierarchy of this tree is consistent with the present
knowledge about evolution in the ascomycetes and therefore likely comprises the orthologues of SconB/SCON-2.
Consequently, this protein is the H. jecorina orthologue of
these two proteins. Analysis of the promotor revealed 4
GATA-type binding sites, whereas putative CYS-3 binding
sites, which would be indicative of a control loop as
present in N. crassa [6] are lacking. As the function of WDdomain/F-box proteins is in the attachment to other proteins, and to acknowledge its proposed function in cellulose signal transduction which has hot been reported
from its closest orthologues, we have chosen to call this
protein LIMPET (encoded by lim1).

LIMPET responds to cellulase-inducing conditions
The isolation of LIMPET as a (potentially regulatory) protein binding to the cellulase activating element CAE suggests a function in induction and/or regulation of
cellulase gene expression. Therefore we analyzed whether
lim1 would transcriptionally react to a shift to inducing
conditions. Again we chose conditions shown to strongly
induce cellulase gene expression in earlier studies [23,31]
and at the same time would reveal a short term response
to inducing conditions. Strain QM9414 was grown on
Mandels-Andreotti minimal medium with 1% (w/v) glyc-

erol as sole carbon source for 24 hours in darkness and
afterwards transferred to medium lacking the carbon
source but supplemented with 1.5 mM (0.05%) sophorose, which has a strong cellulase inducing effect [30].
Under these conditions sophorose cannot be regarded as

lim1 is regulated in dependence of sulphur availability
Because of the in silico identification of LIMPET as a regulator of sulphur metabolism, regulation of lim1 was tested
for its regulation under different levels of sulphur source
availability. In order to ensure comparability to earlier
studies we chose conditions similar to those used to investigate transcription of the respective orthologues in Neurospora crassa (SCON-2) or Aspergillus nidulans (SconB)
[5,6]. Therefore H. jecorina QM9414 was cultivated on sulphate free Mandels Andreotti minimal medium in the
presence of glycerol as sole carbon source supplemented
with methionine as the only sulphur source at high (5
mM), low (0.25 mM) or limiting (0.05 mM) concentration. The data shown in Figure 3 indeed confirm that, as
its counterparts in Neurospora and Aspergillus, lim1 is transcribed only on limiting concentrations of methionine in
the medium, thus supporting the hypothesis that LIMPET
is an orthologue of these two sulphur regulators.

carbon source due to the extremely low amount, but only
as an inducing agent for cellulase expression. Therefore
the same medium without sophorose was used as control.
In the presence of sophorose, transcript abundance after
the shift to inducing conditions decreases as cellulase gene
transcription increases (Figure 4). This effect was not due
to the transfer to the new medium, because with the
medium lacking sophorose neither the transcript abundance of lim1 decreases nor transcription of cbh2 is
induced. Thus lim1 transcriptionally reacts to the presence
of the strong inducer sophorose i. e. cellulase inducing
conditions in the opposite way as cellulase genes. These
data are also consistent with the hypothesis that LIMPET
could act as a negative regulator of cellulase formation.
Sulphate is important for normal growth of H. jecorina in
light on cellulose
The experiments described above suggest a function in
both sulphur metabolism and cellulase gene expression.
The latter has recently been shown to be influenced by
light [21]. Consequently we analyzed whether growth of
H. jecorina on cellulose would be influenced by the availability of the sulphur source and whether the light status
would be important for this effect. In order to provide
defined conditions with respect to sulphur availability the
medium was altered according to [5]. The H. jecorina
QM9414 was grown for 96 hours on sulphate free Man-

dels Andreotti medium with 1% (w/v) microcrystalline
cellulose as carbon source and methionine as the only sulphur source in high (5 mM), low (0.25 mM) or limiting
(0.05 mM) concentration in light and darkness. We
observed a reduction of biomass formation in light of 80
to 95% as compared to growth in constant darkness was
observed (Figure 5). Although significant changes in biomass formation due to different amounts of methionine
in the medium were observed, the concentration of supplemented methionine as sulphur source could not compensate the growth defect in light and also had no major
effect on growth in darkness. Under commonly used conditions, i.e. the conventional Mandels Andreotti medium
(which contains approximately 12 mM sulphate) corresponding to high sulphate concentration, H. jecorina only
shows a decrease in biomass formation in liquid culture
in light compared to growth in darkness of roughly 20%
[21] after 96 hours of growth with microcrystalline cellulose as carbon source. Since the major difference of the
two media used is their content of inorganic sulphate,
which is lacking completely and replaced by different concentrations of the organic sulphur source methionine in
one case, a role of inorganic sulphate as signal in processes
related to light response seems possible. Nevertheless, an
influence of the decreased amino acid availability in the
sulphate free medium because of the lack of peptone as

compared to the conventional Mandels Andreotti
medium cannot be excluded, but does not explain the
huge difference in growth between darkness and light
under otherwise equal conditions.
Sulphate uptake is regulated by light in H. jecorina
The finding that light-dependent biomass formation of H.
jecorina on cellulose is clearly altered upon growth in
medium lacking sulphate led to the hypothesis that
uptake of inorganic sulphur is important for growth on
cellulosic substrates in light. This hypothesis was tested in
the following. Sensitivity versus toxic sulphur analogons
such as selenate and chromate has been reported under
conditions of low organic sulphur in wild-type strains of
Aspergillus nidulans as well as Neurospora crassa [5,51]. This
phenomenon is due to derepression of the sulphate
uptake, when the organic sulphur source becomes limiting [53]. Because of the chemical analogy of selenate to
sulphate, both are taken up into the cell by the same permeases [53,54] and also metabolism of selenate follows
the same route as for sulphate [55]. The toxicity of
selenate is consequently due to toxic by-products generated during reduction of selenate, which cause oxidative
damage of DNA and addition of sulphate alleviates the
toxicity of selenate [54,56]. Hence growth defects upon
cultivation in the presence of selenate are indicative of
selenate uptake into the cell. Considering the co-transport
of sulphate and selenate such a growth defect also represents initiated sulphate uptake under the respective conditions.

Using plate experiments the presence of light-dependent
regulation of sulphate uptake should be verified. Therefore plates containing sulphate free Mandels Andreotti
medium with 1% (w/v) of (soluble) carboxymethylcellulose, 0.05 mM of methionine and either 1 mM of
Na2SeO4 or 2 mM of Na2SO4 were inoculated with agar
plugs taken from fully sporulated plates of strain
QM9414. Afterwards they were exposed to light or kept in
constant darkness under otherwise equal conditions at
28°C for four days.
In the presence of 0.05 mM (limiting) methionine
Na2SeO4 was supposed to inhibit the growth of the fungus
due to sulphur metabolite derepression [5]. In fact H. jecorina was not inhibited as severely as expected in growth by
the presence of selenate and limiting concentrations of
methionine. The observed colony diameter after four days
of incubation of strain QM9414 was only slightly
decreased on selenate compared to sulphate in constant
darkness (2.7 ± 0.1 cm on selenate or 3.0 ± 0.1 cm on sulphate) i. e. by 10%, but was clearly reduced in light (2.5 ±
0.3 cm on selenate or 3.8 ± 0.2 cm on sulphate) i. e. by
35%. No such substantial light-dependent difference in
selenate sensitivity was observed when the same experi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/174

ment was done using glucose as carbon source under otherwise equal conditions (5.2 ± 0.4 cm on selenate or 6.2 ±
0.1 cm on sulphate in darkness (16%) and 4.9 ± 0.3 cm
on selenate or 5.5 ± 0.4 cm on sulphate in light (12%)).
Interestingly, increased concentrations of selenate caused
only a minor decrease in growth up to 3 mM and no further decrease even with 10 mM selenate (data not shown),
which completely inhibits growth of Aspergillus and Neurospora. The conclusion that sulphate uptake is increased
during growth on carboxymethylcellulose in light (and
therefore inhibited by the presence of selenate) is in perfect agreement with the data of biomass formation on
microcrystalline cellulose as described above.
H. jecorina lacks a homologue of the predominantly
mycelial sulphate permease
After the finding of an obviously altered regulation of sulphate uptake in H. jecorina as compared to Neurospora or
Aspergillus we wondered whether this alteration could be
due to a different machinery available for regulation of
sulphate metabolism in this fungus. Therefore we
screened the Trichoderma reesei genome database v2.0 [39]
for genes with similarity to the four sulphate permeases
detected within the N. crassa genome [57]. Phylogenetic
analysis of the five proteins (tre21550, tre38951,
tre35211, tre45927 and tre75475) we identified, revealed
that only three of them clustered with the sulphate permeases present in N. crassa (Figure 6, Table 1). N. crassa
CYS-14 [53,58], the predominantly mycelial sulphate permease, seems to have no orthologue in H. jecorina. Only
an orthologue of the second characterized, predominantly
conidial sulphate permease, CYS-13 [53] is also present in
H. jecorina (tre38951). This sulphate permease shares
49% amino acid identity to the N. crassa hypothetical protein NCU03235.1 (XP_965335) which was denominated
CYS-13 [57]. Since deletion of CYS-13 and CYS-14 leads
to the inability to use sulphate for growth in other organisms [53], the remaining sulphate permeases are likely to
have specialized functions and are not primarily involved
in sulphate uptake under the conditions studied so far.
Analysis of transcription of H. jecorina cys13 did not indicate expression of this sulphate permease under any conditions tested, including growth on glucose, glycerol or
lactose (data not shown). Thus we conclude that cys13
does not compensate for the lack of cys14 and that uptake
of sulphate in this fungus is altered as compared to Neurospora or Aspergillus.
Expression of lim1 and cellulase genes is dependent on the
availability of the sulphur source
The data described above suggests that availability as well
as quality of the sulphur source are important for regulation of cellulase gene transcription and that the newly
identified regulator protein LIMPET is involved in this
process. If this would prove correct, then cellulase gene

transcription should be influenced by the sulphur source
in the medium and a correlation to lim1 transcription
should occur. Since we detected a general influence of the
sulphur source on growth on cellulose, we analyzed transcription of the main cellulase cbh1. Also the promotor of
cbh1 comprises a motif similar to the binding sequence
analyzed in this study at -783 relative to the ATG. As cellulases are coregulated in H. jecorina [20,59,60], transcription of cbh1 can be considered representative for cellulase
transcription. Transcript abundance of both lim1 and cbh1
was analyzed upon growth in sulphate free medium supplemented with 0.05 (limiting), 0.25 (low) or 5 mM
(high) of methionine in constant light or constant darkness. With methionine as the sole sulphur source, lim1
was transcribed in the presence of low or limiting (0.05
and 0.25 mM) concentrations and in darkness only. The
transcription of cbh1 was regulated contrarily to lim1
being maximal at 5 mM methionine in darkness thus indicating a stimulation by methionine (Figure 7A). In light
no lim1 transcript was detectable, and cellulase transcript

RNA were loaded per lane, a hybridization with 18S rRNA is
given as a loading control.

abundance in the presence of 0.25 mM methionine was
clearly elevated as compared to darkness, which is in concordance with earlier data [21]. However, no cellulase
transcript was detected under sulphur limiting conditions
in light. In the presence of 5 mM methionine growth in
light was severely reduced, which did not allow for a reliable result for this condition.
Due to the obvious indirect correlation of transcription of
lim1 and cbh1 in darkness, we were interested whether this
correlation would also appear under commonly used conditions i. e. in conventional Mandels Andreotti medium,
which contains 10 g/l peptone (Merck, #1.07213; corresponding to 0.25 mM methionine) and approx. 12 mM
sulphate. Upon growth on conventional Mandels Andreotti medium, lim1 was detected not only in darkness, but
also during growth in light. The complementary regulation of lim1 and cbh1 as seen under controlled sulphur
conditions and upon sophorose-induction was not obvious in conventional Mandels Andreotti medium (Figure
7B). Since no inorganic sulphate is available in the sulphate free Mandels Andreotti minimal medium, it seems
likely that lim1 responds to the kind of sulphur source
available or even specifically to the presence of methionine if sulphate is lacking both by an altered transcript
level in general as well as by an altered response to light.
lim1 shows a transcriptional response to light and is
regulated by ENVOY
A light-dependent regulation of lim1 as indicated above
would corroborate the obviously light dependent regulatory processes connected to sulphur metabolism. Therefore we were interested if transcription of lim1 would
respond to illumination and if the light-regulatory protein
ENVOY would be involved in the respective regulation.
Upon growth on glucose lim1 showed enhanced transcription after a switch from constant darkness to constant
light after 45 minutes on glucose. In the strain env1PASlacking the PAS-domain of the light regulatory protein
ENVOY [21], transcription of lim1 is strongly increased in
darkness and decreases upon illumination (Figure 8).
Therefore lim1 is at least under some conditions subject to
regulation by ENVOY. These data are indicative of regulation of lim1 by light, but also indicate that lim1 falls into
the category of genes repressed by ENVOY in the dark
[22]. The env1 transcript itself is responsive to limiting
methionine levels, since it is more abundant in the presence of 0.25 mM methionine as with only 0.05 mM
methionine (Figure 7A).
Cellulase gene transcription is influenced contrarily in light
and darkness by methionine
Since the increased cellulase transcription upon addition
of 5 mM methionine in darkness (Figure 7A) could be
exploited to enhance efficiency of industrial fermenta-

tions, we wanted to test whether this enhancing effect of
methionine would also occur under conditions commonly used with H. jecorina. The fungus was therefore
grown on Mandels Andreotti minimal medium with 1%
(w/v) microcrystalline cellulose as carbon source and
0.1% peptone in light and darkness with or without 5 mM
methionine. In darkness we observed a threefold increase
in transcript abundance of cbh1 after 72 hours when
methionine was added. In the presence of light, however,
transcription of the major cellulase cbh1 was completely
shut down under the same conditions (Figure 9),
although in this case the severe growth inhibition as seen
without sulphate was not observed. Therefore H. jecorina
most probably utilized the carbon content of peptone for
growth, which however does not induce cellulase gene
expression (M. Schmoll, unpublished). In accordance
with its function as sulphur metabolite repressor, lim1
responded both in light and darkness to increased
methionine levels with a shutdown of transcription. Thus
lim1 specifically reacts to methionine levels in the

LIMPET – the output of its regulatory function depends
on the light status.

Discussion
Sulphur uptake and metabolism are crucial processes for
all organisms because of the manifold roles of the two sulphur containing amino acids cysteine and methionine not
only in protein biosynthesis but also in redox potential
homeostasis and methylation processes. Organisms have
therefore developed sophisticated regulatory mechanisms
to ensure controlled sulphur availability. As for fungi, the
best analyzed machineries for this purpose are those of N.
crassa, A. nidulans and particularly S. cerevisiae. In H. jecorina sulphur metabolism has not been studied so far.
The analysis of the influence of the sulphur source on regulation of cellulase gene expression was initiated by the
unexpected finding, that LIMPET binds to a cis-regulatory
motif of the cbh2 promotor. LIMPET is the first WDrepeat/F-box protein to be identified and characterized in
H. jecorina. Concluding from the functions of its orthologues in other fungi, LIMPET could be a regulatory protein that activates transcription by phosphorylation-

dependent degradation of a factor inhibiting expression
of cbh2. Such a function would be in agreement with data
from Zeilinger et al., [23], who showed that the complexes
formed on CAE (the cbh2 activating element) are smaller
under inducing conditions (sophorose), albeit the respective kinase and this probably repressing factor remain to
be identified. Given the fact that E3 ubiquitin ligases
themselves are frequently targets of degradation in an
SCF-dependent manner [61,62], LIMPET could also itself
represent this repressor. While deletion of the lim1-orthologues scon2 (Neurospora crassa) or sconb (Aspergillus nidulans) was successful, we were not able to obtain viable
lim1-deletion mutants, what may be due to the obviously
altered sulphur regulatory pathway. Interestingly, the S.
cerevisiae orthologue of lim1, met30 is also an essential
gene [8]. Nevertheless, we can therefore not be sure,
whether LIMPET is indeed the transducer of the sulphur
signal to the cbh2-promotor and thus a direct regulator of
cellulase gene expression, although a connection between
sulphur- and carbon-signaling became clearly obvious.
A hypothesis how LIMPET could impact cellulase gene
expression can be deduced from the studies on regulation
of sulphur metabolism in N. crassa: The regulatory cycle of
SCON-2 and CYS-3 has been analyzed in detail in N.
crassa and involves both regulation of transcription and
activation of the respective proteins. During sulphur limitation, SCON-2 is present in high amounts, most probably in an inactive state. If the nutritional situation changes
and an abundant sulphur source is encountered, this pool
of SCON-2 can be rapidly activated and prevent the function of CYS-3, and thus shut down the sulphur circuit.
This finally results in the termination of sulphur uptake.
On the other hand expression of the scon-2 gene, the promotor of which contains several CYS-3 binding sites, is
dependent on functional CYS-3 [6,63]. Thus, SCON-2
inhibits cys3 transcription in a negative feedback loop [7].
CYS-3 activates the uptake of sulphate and several other
mechanisms involved in sulphur metabolism [7]. Our
data show that lim1 is not transcribed in light under conditions lacking an inorganic sulphur source. A function of
LIMPET putatively analogous to SCON2 would thus lead
to stimulated uptake of sulphate in light, which is not
available under the condition tested, obviously resulting
in considerably decreased growth. Also the decreasing
effect of selenate upon growth on carboxymethylcellulose
in light is in agreement with these data. Hence we conclude that sulphate is important for normal growth in
light on cellulose and that methionine, being commonly
considered an organic sulphur source, cannot compensate
for this requirement. However, we want to note that
despite the presence of a CYS-3 homologue, no binding
sites similar to those identified in N. crassa were detected
in the promotor of lim1. Hence a negative feedback loop
may not be operative in H. jecorina.

Although the finding of LIMPET as a close homologue of
N. crassa SCON-2 or A. nidulans SCONB, respectively, suggests similarities in the sulphur regulatory systems of
Hypocrea, Neurospora and Aspergillus, the mechanism of
sulphate uptake in Hypocrea jecorina QM9414 appears to
be altered: First, phylogenetic analysis of its predicted sulphate permeases indicates, that the predominantly mycelial sulphate permease (the CYS-14 orthologue) is
missing. Transcription of the remaining, predominantly
conidial sulphate permease (the CYS-13 orthologue)
could not be detected under any conditions tested (M.
Schmoll, data not shown). In this respect it is particularly
interesting, that lack of the two sulphate permeases CYS13 and CYS-14 leads to the inability to use sulphate as sulphur source and to selenate resistence [53] in N. crassa,
although 4 sulphate permease genes have been detected
in this fungus [57]. For both N. crassa and A. nidulans
[5,51] sensitivity versus toxic sulphur analogues in presence of low concentrations (0.25 mM) of methionine was
described, which is not found for H. jecorina. In S. cerevisiae, regulation of the synthesis of both sulphate permeases is under the control of exogenous methionine or
S-adenosylmethionine. Their synthesis is coordinated
with the synthesis of the other methionine biosynthetic
enzymes [64], what would imply continued uptake of
selenate and thus lethality under low-methionine conditions. Judging from this data, the H. jecorina sulphur
assimilation system appears to exhibit high affinity versus
methionine, enabling the fungus to survive even in the
presence of very low concentrations of it. Since this fungus
can also utilize sulphate as sole sulphur source, it is likely
that H. jecorina is – obviously unlike A. nidulans or N.
crassa – able to differentiate between these sulphur
sources (which is also reflected by the transcription pattern of lim1 on media with or without sulphate) and terminate one uptake mechanism in favour of the other if
required. In case of the presence of selenate such a flexible
mechanism could prevent the fatal effect of this sulphate
analogon, although therefore a specific detection of the
toxin would be required. Alternatively an as yet unidentifed detoxification mechanism, which would explain this
effect could be at work. In this respect it is interesting, that
for several yeast species growing on decaying fruits comparable mechanisms have been detected and suggested to
have evolved due to the considerable amounts of selenate
present in certain plants. In order to avoid the harmful
consequences of sulphate and thus selenate uptake they
can preferentially utilize organic sulphur, in many cases
obtained by attacking other yeasts [65,66]. Data on the
role of the S. cerevisiae homologue of LIMPET, Met30p
clearly show a role of the sulphur regulatory machinery in
heavy metal response through regulation of the transcription factor Met4p [11]. The main target of this circuit in
this case is glutathione synthesis, which is needed to complex and subsequently detoxify the heavy metal. A mech-

anism as described above would be in concordance with
the symbiotic interaction of Trichoderma spp. with plants
[67], their natural substrate being decaying plant material
and their efficient biocontrol activity [68]. The fact that
both the presence of selenate/sulphate or methionine,
respectively, has different consequences in light and darkness further indicates that these environmental cues must
have a more significant relevance than just signalling the
availability of sulphur. In accordance with this hypothesis
we found that H. jecorina adjusts cellulase gene transcription in dependence of the sulphur source available and
the light status. Considering the mechanisms discussed
above the connecting environmental cues might be the
presence of plant material (cellulose) and possibly the
encounter of a competitor, which is more likely on the
surface of the substrate (light).
Consequently, an involvement of LIMPET in modulation
of cellulase gene expression in response to a varying sup-

ply of sulphur seems to be beneficial for H. jecorina. Interestingly, the respective signal leads to opposite effects in
light and darkness in the presence of sulphate. Therefore
we hypothesize that the significance of the presence of
methionine reaches beyond merely an indication of the
sulphur source. Since the addition of methionine did not
stimulate growth on cellulose in light in the absence of
sulphate, we assume that its effect is also not simply
related to the provision of a potentially growth-limiting
amino acid. The response to methionine may be – at least
in part – connected to the intracellular cAMP-levels which
has been shown to stimulate cellulase formation in H.
jecorina [69] and Cryphonectria parasitica [70]. While the
enhanced transcription of cbh1 upon addition of methionine in darkness is well in concordance with this hypothesis, the abolished cbh1 transcription under the same
conditions in light rather indicates a more sophisticated
regulation. A recent study by Xue and coworkers [71] provides intriguing hints which might shed a new light on the

interacting signal transduction pathways studied in this
work. They show that the G-protein coupled receptor
GPR4 of Cryptococcus neoformans, which has an orthologue
in H. jecorina (tre72004), interacts with the G-protein α
subunit GPA1, the orthologue of H. jecorina GNA3 and
that methionine induces cAMP accumulation in this fungus. This study on the one hand shows that this G-protein
coupled receptor does not respond to glucose as expected
from its structural similarity to the S. cerevisiae glucose
sensor GPR1, but instead seems to sense methionine –
this amino acid being the only clearly confirmed ligand of
GPR4. On the other hand, its interacting G-protein α subunit GPA1 is involved in glucose sensing. Also, methionine was found to induce cAMP accumulation in C.
neoformans.

Conclusion
Out data revealed that cellulase gene expression is influenced by both quality and quantity of the sulphur source
available and that the regulation of sulphur metabolism
and -uptake in H. jecorina is different compared to other
fungi. Thereby, the methionine signal seems not only to
be representative for the presence of a sulphur source, but
also has a light dependent significance for cellulase transcription. We hypothesize that H. jecorina GNA3, which
we found to be involved in regulation of cellulase gene
expression (manuscript submitted), could establish the
connection between the putative methionine receptor and
the target (Figure 10). Light dependent regulation of lim1
transcription in the presence of high amounts of inorganic
sulphate and low methionine concentrations suggests
that lim1 also responds to the kind of sulphur source
available and might affect its targets accordingly. For
SCON2 [51] and SCONB [5], although grown on glucose
and without controlled light conditions, essentially similar transcriptional behaviour as observed with lim1 in
darkness in the absence of sulphate, was reported. Therefore the function of lim1 is unlikely to be shifted from regulation of sulphate to regulation of carbon metabolism
but lies rather in the connection of these pathways. Such
a system would resemble a nutrient coincidence detection
system as suggested by Xue and coworkers [71], which
additionally integrates the light status into the regulation
of transmission of the signal to its target.
