Abstract
Background: Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) is a pathogen of marine-farmed
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar); a disease first diagnosed in Norway in 1984. For over 25 years ISAV
has caused major disease outbreaks in the Northern hemisphere, and remains an emerging fish
pathogen because of the asymptomatic infections in marine wild fish and the potential for
emergence of new epidemic strains. ISAV belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, together with
influenza viruses but is sufficiently different to be assigned to its own genus, Isavirus. The Isavirus
genome consists of eight single-stranded RNA species, and the virions have two surface
glycoproteins; fusion (F) protein encoded on segment 5 and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein
encoded on segment 6. However, comparision between different ISAV isolates is complicated
because there is presently no universally accepted nomenclature system for designation of genetic
relatedness between ISAV isolates. The first outbreak of ISA in marine-farmed Atlantic salmon in
the Southern hemisphere occurred in Chile starting in June 2007. In order to describe the
molecular characteristics of the virus so as to understand its origins, how ISAV isolates are
maintained and spread, and their virulence characteristics, we conducted a study where the viral
sequences were directly amplified, cloned and sequenced from tissue samples collected from
several ISA-affected fish on the different fish farms with confirmed or suspected ISA outbreaks in
Chile. This paper describes the genetic characterization of a large number of ISAV strains
associated with extensive outbreaks in Chile starting in June 2007, and their phylogenetic

relationships with selected European and North American isolates that are representative of the
genetic diversity of ISAV.
Results: RT-PCR for ISAV F and HE glycoprotein genes was performed directly on tissue samples
collected from ISA-affected fish on different farms among 14 fish companies in Chile during the ISA
outbreaks that started in June 2007. The genes of the F and HE glycoproteins were cloned and
sequenced for 51 and 78 new isolates, respectively. An extensive comparative analysis of ISAV F
and HE sequence data, including reference isolates sampled from Norway, Faroe Islands, Scotland,
USA, and Canada was performed. Based on phylogenetic analysis of concatenated ISAV F and HE
genes of 103 individual isolates, the isolates from the ISA outbreaks in Chile grouped in their own
cluster of 7 distinct strains within Genotype I (European genotype) of ISAV, with the closest
relatedness to Norwegian ISAVs isolated in 1997. The phylogenetic software program,
BACKTRACK, estimated the Chile isolates diverged from Norway isolates about 1996 and,
therefore, had been present in Chile for some time before the recent outbreaks. Analysis of the
deduced F protein sequence showed 43 of 51 Chile isolates with an 11-amino acid insert between
265N and 266Q, with 100% sequence identity with Genotype I ISAV RNA segment 2. Twenty four
different HE-HPRs, including HPR0, were detected, with HPR7b making up 79.7%. This is
considered a manifestation of ISAV quasispecies HE protein sequence diversity.
Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest that the ISA outbreaks were caused by virus
that was already present in Chile that mutated to new strains. This is the first comprehensive
report tracing ISAV from Europe to South America.

Background
Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) is a pathogen of
marine-farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar); a disease
first diagnosed in Norway in 1984 [1]. For over 25 years
ISAV has caused major disease outbreaks in the Northern
hemisphere, and remains an emerging fish pathogen
because of the asymptomatic infections in marine wild
fish and the potential for emergence of new epidemic
strains. ISAV belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae,
together with influenza viruses [2]. However, the virus is
sufficiently different from influenza viruses to be assigned
to its own genus, Isavirus. Sequence analysis of several
ISAV isolates on the eight genomic segments consistently
reveals two genotypes that are designated with respect to
their geographic origin, European and North American;
the two show 15–19% difference in their amino acid
sequences of the fusion (F) and the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoproteins [3]. Since we now have ISAV isolates of both genotypes from Europe, North America, and
South America, it has been proposed to drop the geographical designation of the genotypes and instead designate the European genotype as Genotype I and the North
American genotype as Genotype II [4]. A sub-classification
of the European (Genotype I) isolates into three clades
(EU-G1, EU-G2, and EU-G3) has been proposed based on
the 5' 1 kb of segment 6 sequences [5]. Additionally,
results from phylogenetic analyses performed separately
for each gene segment showed different phylogenetic relationships, with several European isolates diverging in virulence clustered together in several segments with high
bootstrap support [6]. ISAV isolates can be further differ-

entiated on the basis of insertion/deletions in a highly
polymorphic region (HPR) spanning residues 337V to
M372 in the stem of the HE protein, adjacent to the transmembrane region: 26 different European and 2 North
American HPR groups have been identified so far [7,8].
On the other hand, the HPR is vaguely defined, the HPR
groups and numbering vary between publications or
research labs; for example, Gagné and Ritchie [9] have
suggested that the HPR should start from residue 320V/L
since some isolates have deletions 5' of 337V. Moreover,
use of HPR groups in epidemiological investigations was
recently rejected because they vary significantly and are
not suited as an indicator of relatedness between virus isolates [10]. Nonetheless, for both Genotypes I and II isolates, the HPR is an important virulence marker as a direct
molecular relationship can be demonstrated between the
HE protein stem length, ISAV cytopathogenicity in cell
culture, and ability to cause clinical disease in Atlantic
salmon [3,11]. The non-cultivable, non-pathogenic
viruses detectable only by RT-PCR have the full-length HE
protein (designated HPR0 or HPR00 for Genotype I found
in Europe or North America, respectively) [7]. Because
there is presently no universally accepted nomenclature
system for designation of genetic relatedness between
ISAV isolates, further investigations of different ISAV isolates from different geographical areas are necessary to
facilitate comparison of ISAV isolates.
The first outbreak of ISA in marine-farmed Atlantic
salmon in the Southern hemisphere occurred in Chile
starting in June 2007 and has been reported [4]. In order

to describe the molecular characteristics of the virus so as
to understand its origins, how ISAV isolates are maintained and spread, and their virulence characteristics, we
conducted a study where the viral sequences were directly
amplified, cloned and sequenced from tissue samples collected from several ISA-affected fish on the different fish
farms with confirmed or suspected ISA outbreaks in Chile.
This paper describes the genetic characterization of a large
number of ISAV strains associated with extensive outbreaks in Chile starting in June 2007, and their phylogenetic relationships with selected European and North
American isolates that are representative of the genetic
diversity of ISAV.

Results and discussion
RT-PCR, gene sequencing and analysis
As of November 2008, 159 accumulated total of salmon
farms in Chile had been registered as positive for ISA by
Sernapesca [12], of which 113 were in X Region, 44 in XI
Region, and 2 in XII Region (Figures 1 and 2; [13]). From
June 2007 to November 2008, a total of 242 tissue samples were collected from several ISA-affected fish on different fish farms with confirmed or suspected ISA outbreaks.
In order to thoroughly describe the molecular characteristics of the viruses so as to understand their origins and virulence characteristics, we directly amplified viral
sequences from the tissue samples by RT-PCR. It was considered that such a strategy would allow detection of the

widest range of viral mutants associated with the ISA outbreaks. In the present study, the PCR products of the ISAV
F and HE glycoprotein genes were cloned and sequenced
or in some cases partial sequences were obtained by
directly sequencing the PCR products without molecular
cloning. All tissue samples received in viral transport
medium were positive by RT-PCR for segments 5 and 6,
and products containing full-length open reading frames
(ORFs) were processed for cloning and sequencing. In
contrast, some of the tissue samples received in RNAlater®
did not yield RT-PCR products for either RNA segment 5
or 6 full-length ORFs. In most of these cases, RT-PCR targeting the segment 6 HPR yielded a product, which was
cloned and/or sequenced. We present here the sequence
analysis of the ISAV envelope protein genes, F and HE,
from several fish farms belonging to 14 different fish companies affected by the ISA outbreaks in Chile for 51 and 78
new isolates, respectively [see Additional file 1].
Phylogenetic analysis of combined ISAV F and HE
glycoprotein genes is a better approximation of genetic
relatedness between ISAV isolates
Phylogenetic analysis for segment 5 (F gene) of the new
Chile ISAVs and other existing segment 5 sequences of reference isolates sampled from Norway, Faroe Islands, Scotland, USA, and Canada, 108 segment 5 sequences in total
[see Additional file 1], was done. All ISAVs grouped into
the two established genotypes, Genotype I (European)
and Genotype II (North American), with the new Chile
ISAVs isolated from the ISA outbreaks grouping within
Genotype I [see Additional file 2]. To examine Genotype I
more thoroughly, all ISAVs belonging to Genotype II were

removed, and a tree was generated for Genotype I ISAVs
only. This tree, which is shown in Figure 3, confirmed that
the new Chile ISAVs are unique, grouping in their own
cluster with considerable bootstrapping value (93.4%).
These ISAVs are most closely related phylogenetically to
the Norwegian ISAVs isolated in 1997 (ST28/97, ST25/97,
ST27/97, and 97/09/615 (also referred to as ISAV8)) and
2005 (SK-05/144 and MR102/05). Bootstrap values indicate a more distant relationship to HPR0 viruses detected
in Norway in 2004 (SF83/04) and 2006 (SK 779/06) [6].
A phylogenetic tree was generated with 156 segment 6
sequences [see Additional file 3]. Similarly to the segment
5 phylogenetic trees, all ISAVs examined also unequivocally grouped into the two established genotypes, Genotype I (European) and Genotype II (North American) on
the segment 6 phylogenetic tree, with the new Chile ISAVs
forming a unique cluster within Genotype I. Figure 4
shows the segment 6 tree for Genotype I ISAVs only,
which clearly supports the two European genogroups,
European-in-North America, and Real European with two
clades inside the Real European genogroup, EU-G1 exclusive and EU-G2 with EU-G3, and all the new Chile ISAVs
isolated from the outbreaks are in EU-G3. Thus whereas
the boundaries between EU-G1, EU-G2 and EU-G3 were
not clear in segment 5 (Figure 3; [see Additional file 2]),
in segment 6, it is the boundary between the second EUG2 and EU-G3 that are not clear (Figure 4; [see Additional
file 3]), although the three clades EU-G1, EU-G2, and EUG3 [5,8] are clearly recognizable within Genotype I (European Genotype). However, in the present trees (Figures 3
and 4) the European-in-North American ISAVs cluster
separately from all EU-G2, showing them as a distinct
genogroup within Genotype I.
It is apparent that the phylogenetic trees for ISAV segments 5 and 6 (Figures 3 and 4; [see Additional files 1 and
2]) are different, and it is not known which tree reflects
the evolutionary history of the ISAV species. Since the
complete genomic information of all the isolates is not
available, it can be reasonably expected that a phylogenetic tree generated based on the combination of segments 5 and 6 will provide a better approximation of
genetic relatedness between virus isolates than the tree
based on either segment 5 or 6 alone, not withstanding
the possibility that these genes evolve independently. The
present study produced a new sequence by concatenating
the segment 5 sequence and the segment 6 sequence for
each isolate with the rationalization that these new
sequences would approximate the real phylogenetic relationship more closely. Figure 5 shows the phylogenetic
tree for 106 of the ISAV isolates for which both segments
5 and 6 sequences were analyzed [see Additional file 1],
and Figure 6 shows the detailed tree for the Genotype I
portion of this tree. High bootstrapping values (more
than 65%) are marked in Figures 5 and 6. For easy identi-

fication of the phylogenetic trees, some branches have
been marked with letters or numbers. To our knowledge,
this kind of concatenation and tree generation has not
been done before. It is proposed that this tree, which
incorporates an arbitrary numbering system of two
unique first-order clades each (clades 1 and 2) in Genotypes I and II, be the basis for the nomenclature and genotyping for ISAV, and a proposed uniform nomenclature
for ISAV species is illustrated in Figure 7.
The evolution of Genotype II segments 5 and 6 genes, in
contrast to Genotype I, is extremely limited, and the 8 reference ISAV isolates analyzed can only be grouped into
two genogroups: Genogroup 1 consisting of isolate 980280-2, and Genogroup 2 containing the remaining ISAV
isolates, but no higher-order clades beyond this grouping
(Figure 5).
The phylogenetic tree for the 98 Genotype I ISAVs (Figure
6) clearly supports the classifications of the individual
segments 5 and 6, but also provides a better approximation of genetic relatedness between virus isolates than
either segment 5 or 6 alone (Figures 3 and 4; [see Additional files 1 and 2]). All isolates of Genotype I (Figure 5)
can be classified into two genogroups: Genogroup 1
(European-in-North America) is branch (1) and Genogroup 2 (Real-European) is branch (18) (Figure 6). Members of Genogroup 1 in Genotype I correspond to EU-G2
of Nylund et al. [5] together with those of branches (14)
and (20). Within Genogroup 2 of Genotype I are two second-order clades, branch (17) corresponding to Clade 2.1
(Norway I) and branch (19) corresponding to Clade 2.2
(Norway II). The bootstrapping support value for (19) is
pretty high, but not for (17), although considering Figures
3 and 4, this classification is reliable. Inside branch (17)
there are five groups or branches that could be the candidates for the first level clades under Clade 2.1 (branches
(5), (6), (9), (13) and (14) corresponding to clades 2.1.1,
2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, and 2.1.5), although some of them, for
example branch (5), have bootstrapping value below
65%. However, the three branches under (5), which are
very close, have high bootstrapping values: the support for
(2) which is clade 2.1.1.1 is 99.4%; the support for (3)
which is clade 2.1.1.2 is 96.6%; and the support for (4)
which is clade 2.1.1.3 is 90.5%. Clade 2.1.4 has two second level clades: branches (11) and (12) corresponding to
clades 2.1.4.1 and 2.1.4.2. Members of clades 2.1.1, 2.1.3,
and 2.1.4 correspond to EU-G3 whereas members of clade
2.1.2 are a mixture of EU-G1 and EU-G2 of Nylund et al.
[5].
Clade 2.2 (Norway II), i.e., branch (19) (Figure 6), has
two branches, (20) and (23), corresponding to first level
clades 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, respectively. Inside branch (20),
branches (21) and (22) can be named clades 2.2.1.1 and

2.2.1.2, respectively. Inside branch (23), branch (25) is
the only stable clade and can be named 2.2.2.1, which
separates into two additional third-order clades (2.2.2.1.1
[Norway] which is branch (24), and 2.2.2.1.2 [Chile]
which is branch (26). Thus all the ISAVs from the disease
outbreaks in Chile are unique, grouping in their own cluster, clade 2.2.2.1.2, and are most closely related phylogenetically to the Norwegian ISAVs isolated in 1997 (ST28/
97, ST25/97, ST27/97, and 97/09/615 (also referred to as
ISAV8)) which make up clade 2.2.2.1.1.
More detailed analysis of the new Chile ISAV isolates
identifies 7 distinct strains
Clade 2.2.2.1.2 consists of the ISAVs from the ISA outbreaks in Chile (48 isolates in total). To further explore
the evolutionary relationships among these Chile isolates
and find the possible stable clades inside this group, a fine
phylogenetic analysis for these isolates was done. For this,
the multiple alignment of the combined segments 5 and
6 sequences of the Chile isolates (48 isolates, maximal
length 2,380 bp) were manually scanned; those columns
that have single random mutations (mutations occuring

in only one column and only in one sequence) or are
identical for all isolates, and that have gaps due to length
difference of sequences were deleted. Only those columns
that have systematic mutations (mutations occuring in
the same way in more than one sequence), that have continuous mutations (mutations occuring in continuous
columns), and that have gaps due to evolutionary indel
events were kept. These columns were called informative
columns. A phylogenetic tree was then generated based on
the informative columns of the combined segments 5 and
6 sequences of the new Chile isolates. Isolate ST25/97 was
included in the tree as the outgroup. This tree is reported
in Figure 8. Because the marginal gaps were manually
removed, we could involve gaps in the bootstrapping
process; the bootstrapping values that are higher than
35% are listed. Based on Figure 7, we can group all the
Chile isolates into 7 different ISAV strains as also depicted
in Figure 8 and Table 1.
The main characteristics and clinical history of the 7 different Chile ISAV strains are summarized [see Additional
file 4]. The seven isolates belonging to Chile Strain 1 have
no insert in segment 5, and belonged to multiple HPR
groups on segment 6. Only three of the seven isolates were
from confirmed ISA outbreaks. The other four Chile 1 isolates were from fish not diagnosed with ISA disease; one
isolate was from Atlantic salmon parr, one isolate was
from broodstock fish without any symptoms, and two isolates were from adult fish diagnosed with amoeba gill disease (Neoparamoeba perurans) [14]. It is possible that the
amoeba disease was a concurrent infection with ISA. In
contrast, Chile strains 2–7 were all from confirmed or suspected ISA outbreaks and all isolates had the 11-aa insert
in segment 5 and their segment 6 sequences belonged to
HPR 7b and/or HPR 7f except for Chile strain 7 which also
had a mixed infection with HPR 2.
Estimation of branching times of ISAV isolates shows new
Chile ISAV strains diverged from Norway ISAV isolates
around 1996
To establish the timing of the evolutionary process among
ISAV isolates, we used the BACKTRACK program [3] to
estimate the divergence time for some specific inner nodes
of the phylogenetic trees shown in Figures 5 and 6. The
mutation rates for ISAV segments 5 and 6 were previously
determined as 0.67 × 10-3 nucleotides per site per year and
1.13 × 10-3 nucleotides per site per year, respectively [3].
Because Figures 5 and 6 were generated based on the combined segments 5 and 6 sequences for each isolate, the
average mutation rate of 0.90 × 10-3 nucleotides per site
per year was taken as the mutation rate of the combined
segments 5 and 6 sequences. The output of the BACKTRACK program is reflected in Figures 5 and 6 as the estimated divergence years shown in brackets. Thus within

2.2 (Norway II) diverged around 1987 with the interval of
estimation of plus or minus 10 years. This event was probably associated with the first diagnosis of ISA in Norway
in 1984. Within Clade 2.2 of Genogroup 2 in Genotype I,
clade 2.2.2.1.2 [Chile] diverged from clade 2.2.2.1.1 [Norway] around 1996 with the interval of estimation of plus
or minus 2 years. This timeline suggests that the ISA outbreaks in Chile were caused by virus that was already
present in Chile that mutated to new strains. It has been
suggested that the virus was introduced to Chile through
fish egg imports from Norway in the past 10 years [15].
The analysis in the present study, which included 48 Chile
ISAVs isolated between 2007 and 2008 gives a more specific introduction time of around 1996 (Figure 6). The
long length of the branch under (26) in Figure 6 suggests
that the introduced virus took a long time to evolve into
the strains that caused the ISA outbreaks starting in June
2007. This would indicate that probably introduction
occurred on a very small scale into one specific location
following which a few years later the virus was disseminated into the Chilean Atlantic salmon industry. Most
likely the introduction involved ISAV isolates of Chile
Strain 1 (Clade 2.2.2.1.2.1, Figure 6, and Table 1 [see
Additional file 4] or similar virus strain, and the wide dissemination in the industry occurred around 2005, two
years before the first outbreak of ISA, which involved
Chile Strain 7 (Clade 2.2.2.1.2.7), was recognized in
marine-farmed Atlantic salmon in Chile [4].

11-amino acid insert in F protein unique to new Chile ISAV
strains
Analysis of 51 virus isolates for which we had full-length
ORF of the F gene showed 43 isolates with an 11-amino
acid (aa) insert between 265N and 266Q, a mutation site
previously postulated to be a marker for reduced virulence
next to the putative proteolytic cleavage site 267RA/G268 in
the F protein [see Additional file 5]. The 11-aa insert has
100% sequence identity with RNA segment 2 of Genotype
I, which encodes the PB1 polymerase. The mutations 265N
→ 265Y and 266L/Q/H → P266 next to the putative proteolytic cleavage site 267RA/G268 of the F protein are characteristic of ISAV of reduced pathogenicity [3]. Most recently,
the F gene of HPR0, a non-pathogenic virus, was reported
to have 265NQ266 at this site, and it was proposed that the
mutation 266Q → L266 was a prerequisite for virulence, and
that ISAV lacking this mutation required a sequence insertion near the cleavage site in order to gain virulence [6].
However, in the present study, all eight Chile isolates
without the 11-aa insert [see Additional file 5] including
the seven isolates in [see Additional file 4] identified to
belong to Chile Strain 1 had the peptide 265NL266 but only
three isolates (26936, 2006B13364, and 31592), were not
associated with confirmed ISA outbreaks. Before the Chile
ISA outbreaks, there had been only 8 ISAV isolates with
indels in RNA segment 5 [6,16]. All these isolates are
found in Norway; seven of them were recovered between
1999 and 2002 [16] and one was recovered in 2006 [6].

Seven of these isolates had inserts from different parts of
RNA segment 5 while in one isolate, the insert was shown
to come from RNA segment 3, which encodes the ISAV
nucleoprotein. As shown in [see Additional file 6], RNA
segment 5 has an indel evolutional change involving 33
bp and can be classified into four cases: two major groups
and two special cases. The bigger group includes most of
the Chile isolates (43 isolates); the smaller group includes
6 Norway isolates (H2143/89, MR71/02, MR61/01,
MR62/01, SF70/02, and SF57/00). The two special cases
are Norway isolates MR60/01 and MR46/99. The significant point is that the indel sequences in the four cases are
all different. The obvious difference among them indicates that this indel event should be an insertion instead
of a deletion. We can therefore reasonably speculate that
the original Chile ISAV sequences did not have this 33 bp
sequence (11-amino acid sequence). Chile Strain 1 isolates [see Additional file 4] do not have this portion either.
Later, insertion events occurred, likely by non-homologous recombination between the F and PB1 genes of the
same virus resulting in Chile Strains 2 to 7. Based on the
long branch under (5) in Figure 8, we may speculate that
a small amount of Chile Strain 1 ISAV was introduced to
a specific location inside Chile; it took a relatively long
time (around two years) for a recombination event (insertion event) to happen, and then quickly disseminated to
different locations and evolved to different strains. Insertions also occurred in Norway isolates, but the Norway
insertion events were independent of the Chile insertion.
At least three different Norway insertions occurred. Such
mutations are well known in avian influenza virus (AIV),
in case of recombination events involving a sequence
insertion in the HA gene of AIV near the cleavage site of
the protein associated with increased cleavage rate and
leading to emergence of new virulent strains [17-20]. The
presence of Chile Strain 1 ISAV was probably not detected
for some time prior to the initial disease outbreak of June
2007 [4], which involved Chile Strain 7 [see Additional
file 4].
Multiple HPR groups in ISA outbreak is manifestation of
ISAV quasispecies
Analysis of the deduced HE protein full-length sequence
and HPR sequence revealed a total of 24 different HE-HPR
groups, including HPR0, with HPR 7b making up 79.7%
of the virus isolates analyzed in samples from different
fish farms (Table 2; [see Additional file 7]. Other diagnostic labs in Chile found up to 9 different HE-HPR groups in
the same outbreak (ISA workshop in Chile, Puerto Varas,
November 19–20, 2007), including two recent separate
detections of HPR0 virus, one of them at a site in an estuary in XII region. When all these HPR groups are considered together, there are at least 28 distinct HE-HPR
variants associated with the ISA outbreaks in Chile to date.
However, we do not consider this evidence of multiple co-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/88

circulating lineages of ISAV as the diverse 5' 1 kb HE
sequences of the respective HPR groups appeared sequentially related to one another and with tight grouping by
phylogenetic analysis, and were associated with only 7
distinct ISAV strains based on segments 5 and 6 phylogenetic analyses (Figure 8). The appearance of multiple HEHPR groups in such a short time in tissues from the same
or different fish originating from the same or different fish
farms is considered to be a manifestation of ISAV quasispecies HE protein sequence diversity, and for the first time
we can clearly show that the ISAV HPR groups exist as quasispecies populations ([see Additional file 7] although
this will require confirmation by analysis of multiple
clones derived from one clinical sample. Quasispecies
viral populations are connected with a high potential for
rapid evolution [21,22]. This high mutation rate of RNA
viral replication is also suggested to be responsible for the
non-homologous recombination between the ISAV F and
PB1 genes in ISAV strains associated with the ISA outbreaks in Chile.
Demonstration of the ISAV quasispecies HE protein
sequence diversity in the present study was only possible
by sequencing of RT-PCR products obtained directly from
fish tissue. Such a strategy avoided the inadvertent strong
selection that occurs during virus isolation/culture procedures using different fish cell lines, as well as the potential
contamination with ISAV strains used in the laboratory,
when viruses isolated in cell cultures are sequenced. Moreover, attempts to isolate virus from some natural ISA outbreaks and from some ISAV RT-PCR-positive fish are not
always successful [23-28], and the virus isolates most
probably do not reflect the spectrum of wild viruses and,
therefore some local strains might have escaped surveillance if only cultivated virus isolates had been sequenced.
HPR 7b was the most commonly detected HE-HPR group
in tissue samples from different fish farms, accounting for
79.7% of the virus isolates analyzed. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that HPR 7b wild-type virus is the main
cause of this outbreak [4].
It is remarkable that within a year of the Chile ISA outbreaks it was possible to detect HPR0 virus on three different occasions. ISAV HPR0 viruses are non-cultivable, are
considered non-pathogenic [29,30], and are examples of
frag-viruses [31] since they are known only through
genomic sequence fragments. ISAV HPR0 viruses were
first detected in wild Atlantic salmon in Scotland in 2002,
four years after the ISA outbreak in UK [29], and in farmed
Atlantic salmon in New Brunswick in 2004, eight years
after the first ISA outbreak in Canada [30]. The rapid
detection of HPR0 virus in association with the ISA outbreaks in Chile is most likely due to use of RT-PCR directly
from fish tissue samples, with primers targeting ISAV RNA
segments 6 and 8, and sequencing of the PCR products as

the principal method of ISA laboratory diagnosis. In contrast, in both UK and Canada, ISAV RT-PCR was mostly
used to confirm virus isolates from diseased fish and in
most cases RT-PCR targeted ISAV RNA segment 8 only
[23,32], which does not differentiate between HPR
groups.

Conclusion
In conclusion, 51 ISAV F and 78 HE sequences were
directly amplified from tissue samples collected from several ISA-affected fish from June 2007 to November 2008
during the ISA outbreaks in Chile, and used to determine
their phylogenetic relationships with selected European
and North American isolates that are representative of the
genetic diversity of ISAV. The phylogenetic tree based on
combined sequences of segments 5 and 6 sequences for
each isolate provided better understanding of the evolutionary relationship among ISAVs, showing that the new
Chile isolates grouped in their own cluster of 7 distinct
strains within Genotype I of ISAV. The phylogenetic software program, BACKTRACK, estimated the Chile isolates
diverged from Norway isolates around 1996, and following a recombination event (insertion event) in the F gene
around 2005, were quickly disseminated throughout the
Atlantic salmon industry prior to the index case in June
2007. This is the first comprehensive report tracing ISAV
from Europe to South America.

Methods
History of tissue samples collected from farmed Atlantic
salmon in Chile
Moribund fish were submitted for laboratory analysis to
the Biovac S.A. laboratory in Puerto Montt, Chile, where a
full necropsy was conducted and tissue samples were collected for histological evaluation, virus isolation, and
immunohistochemistry and molecular biology analysis.
Figure 1 represents a map of the accumulated ISA outbreaks in Chile from June 2007 to November 2008. Original fish samples consisting of organ pools comprising
liver, spleen, gill, heart and head kidney were received at
the Atlantic Veterinary College (AVC), University of
Prince Edward Island (UPEI), Canada, either in RNALater®
(Ambion Inc., Foster City CA) or in viral transport
medium consisting of Hank's MEM with 10% FBS and 1%
Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Invitrogen). Six additional samples of organ pools collected in 2008 in RNALater®
(Ambion Inc.) were received from two other private
sources in Puerto Montt, Chile. In total, samples were
obtained from 14 fish companies operating in Chile.

Tube RT-PCR System kit (Qiagen) in a PTC-200 DNA
Engine Peltier thermal cycler (MJ Research, Inc.) using oligonucleotide primers and cycling conditions as previously
described [3,33]. In some cases RT-PCR targeting the RNA
segment 6 HPR was performed. The HPR primers consisted of ISAV HPR Fwd 5'-GCC CAG ACA TTG ACT GGA
GTA G-3', and ISAV HPR Rev 5'-AGA CAG GTT CGA TGG
TGG AA-3'. The RT-PCR amplification conditions were 1
cycle at 50°C for 30 min, one cycle at 95°C for 15 min, 40
cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 60 s and 72°C for 90 s
and 1 cycle at 72°C for 10 min before soaking at 4°C. The
PCR products were cloned into either the pCRII vector
using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) or the pDrive
Cloning Vector using the QIAGEN PCR cloning kit (Qiagen) in preparation for nucleotide sequencing, although
in some cases the RT-PCR products were sequenced
directly without cloning. Plasmid DNA for sequencing
was prepared as described before [34], and DNA sequencing was performed as previously described [3]. Sequences
are available through GenBank and their accession numbers are listed in [see Additional file 1].
Phylogenetic analyses
A large set of ISAV isolates sequenced on either one or
both RNA segments 5 and 6 was used. In order to guarantee the quality of the analyses, the existing sequences were
obtained directly from GenBank [35], making sure they
were unique, correct and current [see Additional file 1].
For each RNA segment, all the isolates were used in a multiple alignment by using CLUSTAL X2 with the default settings [36]. The same reference isolates were then used for
phylogenetic analysis. For RNA segment 6, only the first
1,008 nucleotides were used; thus the HPR containing
gaps and the remaining 3' end sequences were excluded
from the analysis [7]. Phylogenetic trees were generated.
Bootstrapping values (1000 replicates) were calculated.
Branches with bootstrapping values ≥ 70% were considered significant, corresponding to a confidence interval ≥
95% [37]. For visualization and printing of the trees, the
NJPLOT program, Version 2.1 (Written by M. Gouy) was
used.
Divergence time estimation in a rooted phylogenetic tree
The computer program, BACKTRACK [3], which reads a
phylogenetic tree with evolutionary distances and years of
isolation for all the sequences and then generates a time
interval for each inner node, was used to determine the
timing of the evolutionary process among ISAV isolates.

Competing interests
RNA isolation, RT-PCR and gene sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from 375 μl volumes of tissue
homogenates or cell culture lysates using TRIZOL LS Reagent (Invitrogen) prior to RT-PCR amplification. The RTPCR amplification was performed with the Qiagen One
