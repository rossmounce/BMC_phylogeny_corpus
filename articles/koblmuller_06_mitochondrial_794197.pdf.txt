Abstract
Background: Squeaker catfishes (Pisces, Mochokidae, Synodontis) are widely distributed
throughout Africa and inhabit a biogeographic range similar to that of the exceptionally diverse
cichlid fishes, including the three East African Great Lakes and their surrounding rivers. Since
squeaker catfishes also prefer the same types of habitats as many of the cichlid species, we
hypothesized that the East African Synodontis species provide an excellent model group for
comparative evolutionary and phylogeographic analyses.
Results: Our analyses reveal the existence of six major lineages of Synodontis in East Africa that
diversified about 20 MYA from a Central and/or West African ancestor. The six lineages show a
clear geographic patterning. Two lineages are endemic to Lake Tanganyika (plus one non-endemic
representative), and these are the only two Synodontis lineages that diversified further into a small
array of species. One of these species is the cuckoo catfish (S. multipunctatus), a unique brood
parasite of mouthbrooding haplochromine cichlids, which seems to have evolved in parallel with
the radiation of its cichlid host lineage, the Tropheini. We also detect an accelerated rate of
molecular evolution in S. multipunctatus, which might be the consequence of co-evolutionary
dynamics.
Conclusion: We conclude that the ancestral lineage of today's East African squeaker catfish fauna
has colonized the area before the Great Lakes have formed. This ancestor diversified rapidly into
at least six lineages that inhabit lakes and rivers in East Africa. Lake Tanganyika is the only lake
harboring a small species flock of squeaker catfishes.

Background
The Great Lakes in the East African Rift Valley (Fig. 1a) are
home to an exceptionally diverse ichthyofauna [1-4]. The
most famous elements of the lakes' faunas are the cichlid

fishes that have formed species flocks of an unparalleled
species-richness and degree of eco-morphological and
behavioral complexity [1,5,6]. It has been estimated that
almost 1,800 cichlid species inhabit Lakes Tanganyika,

The family Cichlidae is, however, just one of several families of freshwater fishes that inhabit the East African Great
Lakes [1,15]. In Lake Tanganyika, the oldest lake in East
Africa, more than 100 non-cichlid fish species in at least
twenty families are recognized, about half of the species
being endemic [1,16,17] (Table 1). Interestingly, all Tanganyikan fish families are known to also occur in the
Congo River basin that is definitely older and holds a
much larger number of fish families than any of the East
African water-bodies [15,18]. An initially West African to
Central African origin has therefore been proposed for the
East African representatives of many of these families [18].
So far, such a scenario has only been confirmed with phylogenetic analyses for the Cichlidae [9,12,19-22], and
Clupeidae (Wilson & Meyer, unpublished), while the
Clariidae seem to have colonized Africa from the Arabian
plate [23]. Eleven non-cichlid families with about 50 species have been described for Lake Malawi. Only one of
these families is not represented in lakes Tanganyika and
Victoria: A single anguillid species, the African mottled eel
(Anguilla bengalensis labiata), migrates to the area of Lake
Malawi via the Zambezi and Shire River. In Lake Victoria,
representatives of thirteen non-cichlid fish families are
known, two of which were introduced only recently. All
other families are also found in Lake Tanganyika (Table
1). Aside of the Cichlidae, nine other families are known
to live in all three Great Lakes: Bagridae, Characidae, Clariidae, Cyprinidae, Cyprinodontidae, Mastacembalidae,
Mochokidae, Mormyridae, and Protopteridae.

Malawi and Victoria [7,8] and that these lake endemic
species are likely to have evolved in the last few millions
or as recently as the last thousands of years only [9-12]. It
is, thus, not surprising that the cichlid species flocks from
the East African Great Lakes have received considerable
attention as model systems for the study of adaptive radiation and explosive speciation [6,13,14].

We were interested in the phylogeny and phylogeography
of one genus of the catfish family Mochokidae, the
squeaker catfishes (Synodontis), in East Africa. With about
190 species assigned to ten genera, the siluriform family
Mochokidae is endemic to the African continent where
these fishes inhabit freshwaters from small creeks to large
streams and from small ponds to large lakes. The genus
Synodontis Cuvier, 1816 (including the monotypic genera
Brachysynodontis and Hemisynodontis) comprises about
120 species, and is the most species-rich and widespread
genus of the Mochokidae. Synodontis species are found
throughout Africa, except in the southernmost parts and
the Maghreb, although most species occur in Central and
West Africa [24]. They are called "squeakers" (also by
many local tribes), because of the noise they produce
when taken out of the water. Some larger Synodontis species are important food resources. Other species are traded
as ornamental fish due to their coloration and because of
the interesting behavior of some of the species. The
upside-down catfishes (S. contractus, S. nigriventris), for
example, show an inverse swimming posture (Fig. 1b).
Even more bizarre is probably the brood parasitic cuckoo
catfish from Lake Tanganyika (S. multipunctatus) that
cedes its eggs among those of spawning mouthbrooding
cichlids; the female cichlid inadvertently takes up the cat-

fish-eggs into her buccal cavity, together with her own
eggs, where the young catfishes nourish on the cichlid larvae (Fig. 1c) [25].
Our interest in the East African Synodontis was founded on
several reasons: Firstly, the Mochokidae are abundant in
all three East African Great Lakes and are, as a consequence, an ideal system for comparative phylogenetic and
phylogeographic analyses with the existing data on cichlid
fishes. Secondly, of the nine non-cichlid families common to the three East African Great Lakes, the Mochokidae show the closest overlap in habitat in comparison to
cichlids, in that they occur primarily in the littoral and
sub-littoral zone [1,16]. Thirdly, among the two East African mochokid genera, Synodontis is more species rich as
compared to Chiloglanis, particularly in Lake Tanganyika,
where seven species of Synodontis have been described.
Finally, most Synodontis species can be considered as euryphagous, which enables them to cope with seasonal
changes in food abundance and habitat change [26,27].
Their feeding regime broadens their food niche and gives
them a better ability to colonize different habitats as compared to more specialized fish species such as many lakeadapted cichlids. Thus, their colonization routes in East
Africa should be good indicators of fish-accessible waterways in that region over evolutionary time spans.
In order to obtain a better understanding of the evolution,
diversity and phylogeography of East African squeaker cat-

fish, we aimed to reconstruct the phylogeny of East African Synodontis with special emphasis on the sequence and
timing of colonization events of the East African Great
Lakes Tanganyika, Malawi and Victoria, and the evolution
of "cuckooing" behavior in Lake Tanganyika. Therefore,
we sequenced a portion of about 900 bp of the mitochondrial genome of 21 species of the genus Synodontis and the
outgroup taxa Microsynodontis batesii and Chiloglanis sp. We
included all but one described, plus one, until now, undescribed, species from Lake Tanganyika, the single
described Lake Malawi Synodontis, one of the two species
occurring in Lake Victoria, two species from East and
South African river systems, as well as eleven representatives of Central and West African species (Table 2).

Results
For this study, we analyzed 407 bp of the mitochondrial
control region of 94 specimens and 426 bp of the NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 6 gene (ND6) of 52 specimens
(including the outgroup taxa). The likelihood mapping
analysis yielded a fraction of 89.4% fully resolved quartets
for the total combined data set (Fig. 2a), and 88.7% fully
resolved quartets for the subset including the East African
taxa only (Fig. 2b), indicating a fairly strong phylogenetic
signal in both data sets. Within the genus Synodontis, pairwise distances (uncorrected p-distances) ranged up to
33.3% (S. shoutedeni versus S. multipunctatus) in the control region and up to 11.5 % (S. granulosus versus S. robertsi) in the ND6 gene segment. The largest uncorrected p-

distances within the East African clade were 23.7% in the
control region and 5.9% in ND6 (in both cases involving
the species pair S. njassae and S. multipunctatus). The two
gene segments analyzed, thus, corroborate the observation that in the mitochondrial genome the non-coding
control region generally evolves about two to five times
faster than protein coding genes [28].
In our phylogenetic analyses, the internal branches interrelating major Central and West African lineages were
short and, hence, the tree topologies remained somewhat
unresolved and the branching topology varied depending
on the tree-building algorithm used. This seems to suggest
that several Central and West African lineages originated

almost contemporaneously in the course of a major
cladogenetic event. However, a much more thorough
sampling and the analysis of a more slowly evolving gene
segment (e.g., RAG1 [29]) would be necessary to shed
light on this part of the evolutionary history of Synodontis
in Africa. Our analyses consistently revealed that the Central and West African members of the genus Synodontis are
ancestral to the East African representatives. The monophyly of the East African clade is clearly seen in the composite consensus tree (Fig. 3) based upon six most
parsimonious trees [tree length, 49,875 steps; consistency
index (CI) excluding uninformative characters, 0.47;

phylogeny. The monophyly of the East African representatives was further confirmed by the individual analysis of
the mitochondrial gene segments, the control region and
the ND6 gene (trees not shown).
The phylogenetic analyses of the East African Synodontis
species revealed a similar outcome compared to that of
the ancestral Central and West African lineages, with relatively short branches interrelating the main lineages (and
low bootstrap support and posterior probabilities for
these branches), indicating an almost contemporaneous
origin of the main East African Synodontis lineages. Six distinct mitochondrial lineages can be distinguished within
the East African clade of Synodontis. The species S.
nigromaculatus, S. zambezensis, S. njassae and S. victoriae
constitute separate clades, while the remaining Lake Tanganyika species can be divided into two distinct genetic
lineages. The first Tanganyikan clade contains S. granulosus and the cuckoo catfish (S. multipunctatus); the second
Tanganyikan clade includes S. dhonti, S. petricola, S. polli
and S. sp. nov. In the maximum parsimony (MP) and NJ
tree of the reduced dataset, the two clades of Lake Tanganyika Synodontis were resolved as a monophyletic group,
albeit with low bootstrap support. In ML and BI, on the
other hand, the two Tanganyikan clades were not resolved
as sister groups, and S. victoriae was placed as sister group
to the clade comprising S. dhonti, S. petricola, S. polli and
S. sp. nov. – with similarly low support values. The fourcluster-likelihood-mapping (Fig. 5) favors a topology

with a monophyletic origin of Lake Tanganyika Synodontis, and S. victoriae being more closely related to S.
nigromaculatus, S. zambezensis and S. njassae. A Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [30] based on the tree topologies
obtained from the reduced data set revealed that there are
no significant differences between the topologies
obtained by the different algorithms (P < 0.05).
Within the second Tanganyikan clade the branching order
among the four species S. dhonti, S. petricola, S. polli, S. sp.
nov. differed with respect to the tree-building algorithm
used. Together with the low bootstrap values and posterior probabilities this again points to an event of rapid
cladogenesis [31]. In the other Tanganyikan clade, we
observed relatively long branches (see Fig. 4), and also the
uncorrected pairwise distances indicated a faster evolutionary rate in the cuckoo catfish (see above). For example, the maximum uncorrected pairwise distance in the
control region in S. multipunctatus was 6.5%, whereas in S.
njassae a maximum uncorrected pairwise distance of only
1.5% was found. Relative rate tests with RRTree indeed
recovered a significantly higher (P < 0.01) substitution
rate for S. multipunctatus compared to all other East African species. This was found for both gene segments.
In order to tentatively date the major cladogenetic events
in Synodontis in East Africa, we used r8s [32] and applied
different calibration points for our analyses. In our first
round of analysis, in which we applied all available dates,
we obtained an age of 12.24 million years (MY) for the

calibration points using the maximum estimated age for the lacustrine habitat in lakes Malawi (1 MY [49]) and Tanganyika (6 MY [46–
48]), as well as the minimum age of the East African clade of Synodontis as suggested by the oldest known Synodontis fossil in that
region (>20 MY [45]). In the first analysis, all three calibrations were applied (1/6/20 calibration); in the second cycle, we used the Lake

(min.: 0.97; max.: 2.37) for the MRCA of the cuckoo catfish (S. multipunctatus) (see Table 3). When applying two

change substantially when only the fossil calibration was

should, however, be interpreted with caution since these
dates lie outside the range of our calibration points, and
since we might not have represented the entire diversity of
Synodontis in Central, South and West Africa.

Discussion
Mitochondrial phylogeny of the East African Synodontis
species
Although the genus Synodontis is the most species-rich and
widespread genus of the Mochokidae accounting for
about a quarter of all African siluriform species, there is no
molecular phylogeny available for this group. Earlier
attempts based on a small number of sequences of the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene revealed a sister-group
relationship between an East African clade (represented
by S. zambezensis, S. nigromaculatus, S. njassae, and S. petricola) and some South-African representatives [33]. However, no Central and/or West African taxa have been
included in this analysis that would allow placing the
investigated species into a larger phylogenetic and phylogeographic context.

We were interested in the phylogeny and phylogeography
of the East African Synodontis species and, therefore, combined the mtDNA sequences of East African representatives with those of eleven Central and/or West African
species. Our analyses of the combined dataset as well as

the separate analyses of each mitochondrial locus, consistently revealed the monophyly of the East African clade
and its derived position compared to the Central and/or
West African taxa (Figs. 3, 4). While the phylogenetic relationships between most of the more ancestral Central
and/or West African representatives could not be resolved,
which is most likely due to the large genetic distances
among these taxa, we could identify a sister-group relationship between a clade comprised by S. velifer and S.
eupterus and S. ocellifer plus the East African clade (Figs. 3,
4).
Within the East African clade, we could clearly identify six
distinct lineages: S. zambezensis; S. nigromaculatus; S. victoriae (Lake Victoria); S. njassae (Lake Malawi); S. granulosus
and S. multipunctatus (Lake Tanganyika I); S. dhonti, S.
polli, S. petricola, S. sp. nov. (Lake Tanganyika II). However,
it was not possible to resolve the phylogenetic relationships between these lineages, as indicated by the short
branches interconnecting them, the lacking statistical support for these branches, and the fact that different tree
building algorithms led to different phylogenetic hypotheses with regard to the relative position of these lineages.
Such a lack of phylogenetic signal in ancestral branches is
frequently observed in cases of relatively rapid lineage
splitting events [12,22,29,31,34-36], e.g., as consequence
of the synchronized fragmentation of a founder population into allopatric units [31]. We, thus, suggest a scenario
for the evolution of Synodontis in East Africa, in which one
ancestral (colonizing) species was split into at least six
sub-lineages within a relatively short period of time, and
that – at least in some cases – these sub-lineages diversified further, albeit in isolation from each other. In this
context, it is interesting to note that hybrids can artificially
be produced between two of the lineages, the riverine taxa
S. zambezensis and S. nigromaculatus [33,37]. It is, however, unlikely that hybridization distorted our phylogenetic signal, as most of the lineages exclude each other

result of the relatively rapid lineage splitting at the beginning of the formation of Lake Tanganyika. It also seems
possible that some hybridization took place in the early
phases of species formation (see e.g., [38]), which could
be tested with nuclear DNA sequences. However, it is
unlikely that the observed lack of resolution in some
branches interrelating main lineages (or taxa) is due to the
markers used, since, overall, we observe a sufficiently
strong phylogenetic signal in the dataset (Fig. 2), and
since the control region is the fastest evolving section of
the mitochondrial genome.

geographically so that no natural hybridization was and is
possible. The specimens of the only two species that partially overlap in range (S. zambezensis and S. nigromaculatus) showed reciprocal monophyly and appeared as
distinct evolutionary units with an average sequence
divergence of ca. 12% in the control region and ca. 4.5%
in ND6.
Lake Tanganyika is the only East African lake that harbors
a small assemblage of endemic Synodontis species [16,17].
Our phylogenetic analyses indicate the existence of two
separate lineages of Synodontis in Lake Tanganyika (see
Fig. 3) (note that also the non-endemic S. nigromaculatus
is found in that lake). The first lineage comprises the relatively large Tanganyikan representative S. granulosus and
the cuckoo catfish (S. multipunctatus), a brood parasite of
mouth-brooding cichlids [25] (Fig. 1c). The second Tanganyikan clade includes the species S. dhonti, S. polli, S.
petricola, and a yet undescribed species. There are some
indications, e.g., the four-cluster likelihood mapping
analysis (Fig. 5), for a monophyly of the two Lake Tanganyikan clades, although statistical support in the individual
bootstrap analysis and in the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test is
lacking. While in both Tanganyikan clades the monophyly of the taxa was supported with high bootstrap values and Bayesian posterior probabilities, the phylogenetic
relationships between the four lineages of the second Tanganyikan clade could not be resolved with high confidence (Fig. 3). We interpret these short branches as the

Phylo-chronology of Synodontis in East Africa
The reconstruction of divergence times from molecular
data or phylogenies is not without potential pitfalls (see
e.g., [39,40]). Yet, such time estimates are useful for providing an approximate framework that puts diversification events into a temporal framework. Our phylochronological reconstruction of the major cladogenetic
events in the East African clade of Synodontis (Table 3) is
based on three independent calibration points, which
were used in different combinations. Because these calibration points are derived from estimates, it is important
to note that our approximations should be interpreted
cautiously. For example, we used a minimum age of 20
MY for the MRCA of the East African clade, based on the
oldest known fossils in that area [41-45]. These Early
Miocene fossils are, however, not particularly well dated
(although 20 MY seems like a good approximation [43]),
they have not been assigned to extant species, and the possibility always remains that still older fossils exist. However, together with the internal calibration pointes – the
ages of lake basins – the estimated scenario for the evolution and phylogeography of Synodontis in East Africa is
congruent with geological and paleolimnological events.

With regard to the entire East African clade of Synodontis,
the oldest known fossils from the Early Miocene are relatively close to the estimated age of the MRCA of that clade.
In our bootstrap replicates, the age of the MRCA of the
East African clade was estimated between 20 (the constrained minimum age in the analyses) and 22.53 MY. For
the MRCA of the first Tanganyikan clade, with S. granulosus and S. multipunctatus, we obtained an age of 11.24–
14.81. This is older than the age of the onset of a truly
lacustrine deepwater habitat in Lake Tanganyika [46-48],
suggesting that the split between these two taxa took place
before the ecosystem of a deep tropical lake has formed
(e.g., in the riverine environment of the Congo and/or
Proto-Malagarazi River) or, possibly more likely, a colonization in the initial period of lake formation when extensive swampy areas with shallow basins are likely to have
existed in the area of present Lake Tanganyika. Thus,
although both S. granulosus and, particularly, the cuckoo
catfish (S. multipunctatus) are highly specialized lake spe-

cies, their ancestors were riverine fish that seem to have
independently achieved their lacustrine lifestyle. In contrast, the second Tanganyikan clade appears to have
undergone its primary radiation at a later stage, most
likely in a lacustrine (or semi-lacustrine) environment (ca.
5–8 MYA; although the maximum values from individual
bootstrap replicates indicate that even older estimates are
possible). The only independent estimation for the MRCA
of S. njassae from Lake Malawi revealed an age of 1.34–
2.18 MY. We find that the cuckoo catfish (S. multipunctatus) has diverged after about 2 MYA (0.97–2.58 MYA).
Interestingly, this would be immediately after the host lineage of the cuckoo catfish, the mouthbrooding haplochromine cichlids, has initiated its radiation in Lake
Tanganyika, according to a recent calibration [9].
Our strategy of carrying out the analysis in three cycles
also aimed to test the validity of some calibration points,
such as the age of the MRCA within Lake Malawi and the
second clade in Lake Tanganyika. While our analyses
revealed highly consistent results for the MRCA of the first
Tanganyikan clade and that of S. multipunctatus (Table 3),
the estimates for the MRCA of S. njassae (Lake Malawi)
and that of the second Tanganyikan clade are slightly
older than expected based on the presumed formation of
the truly lacustrine habitat in both lakes [46-49]. This
could, of course, be due to analytical limitations in estimating divergence times based on molecular phylogenies.
Alternatively, it may indicate the actual coalescence age of
the riverine MRCA of both lineages. However, it could
also mean that the lake basins are somewhat older or that
the divergence of Synodontis in the basins of lakes Malawi
and Tanganyika began before the establishment of the
present lacustrine habitat with its characteristic deepwater conditions, e.g., in more shallow pools in the transition phase between a swampy habitat of a proto-lake
and a real lake.
Phylogeography of Synodontis in East Africa
Based on our phylogenetic and phylo-chronological analysis of Synodontis in East Africa, we can outline the following overall phylogeographic scenario: It seems that after
an initial colonization of East Africa through a potentially
widespread Central and/or West African representative
(probably about 20 MYA), at least six lineages of Synodontis evolved that are each confined to particular geographic
regions. The rapid spread of East African Synodontis can be
explained by a colonization of the area via the ancient
Congo-Malagarazi River connection, and incidents of
drainage catchments towards the Nile systems (in the
North) and between the Upper Congo and Zambezi
drainage (in the South) (see ref. [50] and citations
therein). For example, the two riverine species S. nigromaculatus and S. zambezensis are widely distributed in Southern and Eastern Africa (but are phylogenetically distinct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/49

from the South African clade [33]). The black-spotted
squeaker catfish (S. nigromaculatus) is found in the
Cunene River, the Okavango River, the upper reaches of
the Congo River, the upper Zambezi basin, the Limpopo
as well as in Lake Tanganyika, demonstrating the existence
of fish accessible water-ways through-out eastern and
southern Africa until recently (see e.g., [9,35]). The plain
squeaker (S. zambezensis) is found in the Zambezi and
Limpopo system, as well as in Lake Rukwa. The maximum-likelihood analysis (Fig. 4) suggested a sister-group
relationship between the easternmost species, S. zambezensis, and S. njassae from Lake Malawi, and between S.
nigromaculatus and the first Tanganyikan clade. Both
hypotheses would, phylogeographically, make sense.
However, a more detailed sampling and, particularly,
much longer sequences would be necessary to confirm
this hypothesis.
With our sampling strategy and phylogenetic analyses we
are able to present a robust hypothesis for the evolution
of Synodontis in East Africa (see above). However, we are
not able to address questions related to the phylogeography of single species as has been undertaken for the clariid
Clarias gariepinus [51]. It would, for example, be interesting to compare the phylogeography of S. nigromaculatus to
one branch of haplochromine cichlids that have a comparable distribution range [9,35,50]. Similarly, a detailed
phylogeographic scenario for S. victoriae and S. zambezensis could be used to test the existence of past fish-accessible connections between large East African lakes (see e.g.,
[9,10,18]). A much more thorough sampling of selected
species and phylogeographic hypotheses for single species
would be necessary in order to resolve these open questions.
Comparative phylogeography between East African
cichlids and squeaker catfishes
One of our goals for this study was to compare the phylogeny and phylogeography of the East African squeaker
catfishes to the cichlid fishes, for which an impressive
amount of data exists (see e.g., [9-12,35,52,53]). Our
analyses reveal that, first of all, the initial diversification of
Synodontis in East Africa is much older compared to the
radiation of the extant cichlid species flocks in that area.
(Note that there are representatives of more ancient cichlid lineages in East Africa; some of these have colonized
East Africa secondarily [12,21].) In fact, the main lineages
of Synodontis are likely to have existed before the oldest
lake, Lake Tanganyika, has formed. A Central to West African origin is, however, likely for both groups, and it seems
plausible that the ancestors of both the East African cichlid radiations and the East African Synodontis clade colonized the area at about the same time – with the Congo
River system playing a zoogeographic key-role for the
spread of both groups.

A main difference between the East African cichlids and
Synodontis is also the evolutionary role that Lake Tanganyika has played. Lake Tanganyika is not only a reservoir
for the most ancestral cichlid lineages in East Africa, but it
has been identified as the cradle from which the most species-rich and widespread group of East African cichlids,
the haplochromines, has evolved (see e.g., [9,12,54]).
This "out of Tanganyika scenario" [9] implies that the species flocks of lakes Malawi and Victoria are derived from
the older Tanganyikan radiation [9,12,54]. In Synodontis,
we do not find evidence that a formerly endemic Tanganyikan lineage left the lake secondarily to colonize rivers
and, subsequently, other lakes. Instead, Lakes Malawi and
Victoria were seeded independently by ancestral lineages
of Synodontis. Consequently, different and – in most cases
– more ancient connections between water-systems were
used by Synodontis to colonize East Africa.

resentatives of S. multipunctatus, as shown by longer
branches in the phylogenies, larger genetic distances, and
relative rate tests. A faster rate of DNA sequence evolution
in brood parasites has been described in African finches,
and it has been argued that this might be the consequence
of a dynamic co-evolutionary history [55]. Iterative coevolutionary processes between hosts and parasites might
account for the observed significantly faster evolutionary
rate in S. multipunctatus. Alternatively, there might be
selective pressure to equalize the evolutionary rate in hostparasite systems. This could possibly explain why the
mutation rate in the non-coding control region in S. multipunctatus approaches that observed in haplochromine
cichlids [56] (6.5%; MRCA: 2 MYA), while the remaining
representatives of the East African clade of Synodontis
show considerably lower evolutionary rates (e.g., S. njassae: 1.5%; MRCA: 1–1.5 MYA).

There are, however, also similarities in the distribution of
cichlids and squeaker catfishes. The range of the blackspotted squeaker catfish (S. nigromaculatus), for example,
is similar to that of one lineage of haplochromine cichlids, the Congolese-South African clade (according to ref.
[9]), and S. zambezensis overlaps with Pseudocrenilabrus
[9,50]. A much more detailed sampling would be necessary to test for a putative congruence of time-scale and
routes of colonization between these riverine cichlids and
squeaker catfishes. Similarly, the occurrence of S. victoriae
in lakes Kivu and Victoria seems to support the close relatedness of the fish faunas of both lakes [10]. A detailed
phylogeographic scenario for S. victoriae would thus be of
interest to further test for the commonality of geological
and palaeolimnological events affecting several lineages
of fishes.

Conclusion

The evolution of brood parasitism in the cuckoo catfish (S.
multipunctatus)
The most fascinating behavioral adaptation in Synodontis
is certainly the evolution of brood parasitism in S. multipunctatus from Lake Tanganyika [25] (Fig. 1c). In the
course of our sampling we found larvae of S. multipunctatus in the mouth of Simochromis babaulti and S. diagramma
females (with up to three catfishes per female).

Our analyses resulted in two interesting findings regarding the evolution of cuckoo behavior in S. multipunctatus.
First, our phylo-chronological analyses consistently
revealed an age of about 2 MY for the MRCA of S. multipunctatus. This coincides with the MRCA of the mouthbrooding haplochromines of Lake Tanganyika [9], to
which the current host-species of S. multipunctatus belong.
It thus seems that brood parasitism evolved in S. multipunctatus at an early stage of the radiation of the Tropheini
in Lake Tanganyika. Secondly, we find an accelerated rate
of molecular evolution in both gene segments in the rep-

Our phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of East
African Synodontis species suggest the existence of at least
six main lineages of Synodontis in East Africa that began to
diversify about 20 MYA from a Central and/or West African ancestor. The six lineages show a clear-cut geographic
pattern, and only the distributions of two riverine species,
S. nigromaculatus and S. zambezensis, overlap. Representatives of three lineages are found in the oldest lake in the
area, Lake Tanganyika, and two of these lineages are
endemic and have undergone further diversification
within the lake. The initial diversification of Synodontis in
East Africa appears to be much older than that of the cichlid species flocks, yet, some taxa show similar geographic
patterns compared to haplochromine cichlids, with which
they often share the same habitat (in rivers and lakes). The
endemic brood-parasitic cuckoo catfish (S. multipunctatus)
from Lake Tanganyika seems to have diversified in parallel
with its host species of the mouthbrooding modern haplochromines (the Tropheini). The significantly faster evolutionary rate in S. multipunctatus might be a consequence
of co-evolutionary dynamics. Although Synodontis has colonized East Africa before the formation of the Great Lakes,
which are home to the exceptionally diverse cichlid species flocks, and although the squeaker catfishes inhabit
the same habitats as many of the cichlids, only a few species have evolved in one of the lakes. This, once more,
illustrates the unparalleled, and still enigmatic, propensity of cichlid fishes to undergo explosive speciation.

Methods
Specimen information and DNA methods
This study is based upon a total of 91 individuals of 21
described and one so far undescribed species of Synodontis, mainly from Lakes Tanganyika, Malawi and Victoria,
and several African river systems. As outgroup taxa we
used one individual of Chiloglanis sp. and two individuals

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:49

of Microsynodontis batesii [57,58]. Most of the specimens
were sampled during several field expeditions from 1992
to 2004, while some additional samples were obtained
from the aquarium trade (Table 2). Voucher specimens
are available from the authors. Of all specimens, fin clips
were taken and preserved in 96% ethanol.
We analyzed a 407 bp segment of the most variable part
of the mitochondrial control region (D-loop) of 94 specimens (including the outgroup taxa) and 426 bp of the
more slowly evolving NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6
gene (ND6) of 52 specimens (including the outgroup
taxa). We chose the mitochondrial control region to be
able to directly compare our present results to the East
African cichlid species flocks, for which the control region
is the most common mitochondrial DNA marker
[9,10,12,35,50,59,60]. The ND6 gene was chosen because
it has previously been used in clariid catfishes [51]. We
decided not to use the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene,
because previous analyses indicated a reduced phylogenetic signal in that gene with respect to the East African
Synodontis species [33].
For DNA extraction we applied a proteinase K digestion
followed by protein precipitation with ammonium acetate. As primers for amplification and sequencing of the
most variable part of the mitochondrial control region we
used L-Pro-F [61] and TDK-D [62]. For ND6 we used the
primers ND5G and ND6L [63]. The PCR reactions were
prepared for a total volume of 17 μl containing 0.085 μl
of Taq DNA polymerase (BioThermTM), 1.7 μl of each
primer (10 μM), 1.7 μl 10x dNTP mix, 1.7 μl 10x buffer,
7.62 μl high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
water, and 2.5 μl of the extracted DNA. Amplification was
performed on a GeneAmp 9700 PCR system (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: an initial denaturation phase at 94°C for 3 min followed 45 cycles with
denaturation at 94° for 30 sec, primer annealing at 50°C
for 30 sec, and extension at 72°C for 1 min 30 sec, with a
final extension phase at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR-products were purified with ExoSAP-IT (Exonuclease I and
Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase in buffer; Amersham Biosciences) prior to being added as template for chain termination sequencing following the protocol described in ref.
[64]. DNA fragments were purified with SephadexTM G-50
(Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's
instruction and subsequently visualized on an ABI 3100
capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems). All sequences
are available from GenBank under the accession numbers
listed in Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignment of the DNA sequences was performed using
Clustal X [65] and improved by eye for the control region.
Since all species were resolved as respectively mono-

phyletic clades in a preliminary NJ tree (tree not shown)
using all available sequences of the mitochondrial control
region (calculated in PAUP* 4.0b10; [66]), we chose 52
taxa (including outgroup taxa) for amplification of the
ND6 fragment. Several individuals had long insertions (>
100 bp) in the control region that were excluded for phylogenetic analyses. The combined dataset of control
region and ND6, including 46 taxa, was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the investigated Synodontis species. We applied neighbor-joining
(NJ), maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses in parallel, using the computer program PAUP*. Phylogenetic relationships were also
reconstructed by Bayesian inference (BI) using MrBayes
3.1 [67].
To assess the degree of saturation of transition (ti) and
transversion (tv) mutations at each codon position of the
ND6 gene, we plotted the number of mutations against
the percentage of sequence divergence of all pairwise comparisons (not shown). Based on the estimated ti/tv ratio
inferred from these pairwise comparisons we derived a
proper weighting scheme for a weighted MP analysis. Due
to the estimated ti/tv ratio of 6.81 for third codon positions of two-and threefold degenerate amino acids, 2.63
for third codon positions of fourfold degenerate amino
acids, 2.00 for second codon positions, and 1.75 for first
codon positions we applied the following weighting
scheme (tv/ti): 70:10 for third codon positions of twoand threefold degenerate amino acids, 26:10 for third
codon positions of fourfold degenerate amino acids,
70:35 for second codon positions, and 70:28 at first
codon positions. C/T substitutions at the first codon position of leucine were treated as a fifth base and were downweighted to the same weight as transitions at the third
codon positions. To achieve a proper weighting scheme
for the control region, we first performed a sliding window analysis to define regions exhibiting different degrees
of variation (<10%, low variable; 10–20%, high variable;
>20%, hyper variable) [68]. Despite considerable saturation, transition mutations contain substantial information necessary to resolve the relationships of evolutionary
young splits, without obscuring the deep splits when they
are down-weighted according to their frequency in relation to transversion mutations [22]. We thus evaluated
the degree of saturation of ti and tv for each partition of
the control region separately, and based upon the estimated ti/tv ratios of 1.40, 2.43 and 2.28 for the low, high
and hyper variable regions we obtained following weighting schemes (tv/ti): low variable, 70:56; high and hyper
variable, 70:28. To evaluate an appropriate substitution
model for the ML analysis, we calculated hierarchical likelihood ratio test statistics using the program Modeltest
3.06 [69]. The model recovered was K81uf+I+Γ [70] with
nucleotide frequencies A, 0.3581, C, 0.2676, G, 0.1368, T,

and
R-matrix
A↔C=G↔T+1;
A↔T+C↔G=1.2463;
and
A↔G=C↔T=7.7875. For obtaining MP and ML topologies we applied heuristic search procedures with random
addition of taxa and TBR branch swapping (1,000 replicates for MP; 100 replicates for ML). As standard measures
of confidence we applied bootstrapping (1,000 pseudoreplicates for NJ and MP, 100 for ML). For the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships by Bayesian inference
analyses our data were partitioned by gene and codon
position (only in ND6). Rate heterogeneity was set
according to a gamma distribution with six rate categories
(GTR model) for each data partition. Posterior probabilities were obtained from a 2,000,000-generation Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (four
chains; chain temperature, 0.2; trees sampled every 100
generations), with parameters estimated from each data
partition. A 50% majority-rule consensus tree was constructed after a burn-in of 1%, which is when likelihood
values reached stationarity.
To obtain a potentially better insight into the phylogenetic relationships among the East African member of the
genus Synodontis we repeated the NJ, MP, ML and BI analyses with a reduced dataset including the species S. dhonti,
S. granulosus, S. multipunctatus, S. nigromaculatus, S. njassae, S. petricola, S. polli, S. sp. nov., S. victoriae and S. zambezensis, using S. eupterus, S. velifer and S. ocellatus as
outgroup taxa, based on the first round of phylogenetic
analyses. Proper weighting schemes for MP analysis were
derived from estimated ti/tv-ratios as described above.
Since no tv were observed for third codon positions of
two-and threefold degenerate amino acids, we applied the
same weighting scheme as in the overall data set for these
codon positions. Based on the estimated ti/tv ratio of 2.49
for third codon positions of fourfold degenerate amino
acids, 2.28 for second codon positions, and 1.19 for first
codon positions we applied following weighting scheme
(tv/ti): 25:10 for third codon positions of fourfold degenerate amino acids, 70:31 for second codon positions, and
70:59 at first codon positions. C/T substitutions at the first
codon position of leucine were again treated as a fifth base
and down-weighted to the same weight as transitions at
the third codon positions. For the control region we
obtained ti/tv ratios of 2.28, 3.20 and 2.18 for low, high
and hyper variable regions resulting in a weighting (tv/ti)
of 70:31, 70:22 and 70:32, respectively. For NJ, ML and BI,
the best fit substitution model, recovered by the hierarchical likelihood ratio tests implemented in Modeltest 3.06
[69], was HKY+I+Γ [71] with base frequencies A, 0.3565;
C, 0.2814; G, 0.1308; T, 0.2313; ti/tv, 4.7844; I, 0.3046;
and α, 0.5463. A four-cluster likelihood mapping analysis
[72] using the program TREE-PUZZLE 5.1 [73] was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/49

applied to test the hypothesis of the monophyly of the
two endemic Tanganyikan clades.
To determine differences in substitution rates between
East African representatives of the genus Synodontis and to
test whether the cuckoo catfish (S. multipunctatus) indeed
shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution as indicated by its long branch, we conducted a relative rate test
as implemented in RRTree [74]. We therefore tested S.
multipunctatus against the remaining East African taxa,
applying the K2P substitution model [75].
We used r8s [32] to tentatively date the major cladogenetic events in Synodontis in East Africa. We used the maximum likelihood trees and applied the local molecular
clock method with an optimization via the truncated newton method [76]. The analyses were performed in three
cycles with different calibration points, and 30 bootstrap
replicates for each cycle (the files for this bootstrapping
approach were generated with Mesquite [77]; the maximum likelihood trees were generated with PAUP* [66] as
described above). In the first cycle, we used all three available calibration points: (i) the maximum age of about one
million years for the lacustrine radiation of the Lake
Malawi species S. njassae, based on the age of the truly
lacustrine habitat [49] (see also refs. [9,56]); (ii) the maximum age of about six million years for the lacustrine
radiation of the second Tanganyikan clade including S.
dhonti, S. petricola, S. polli and S. sp. nov., based on the age
of the truly lacustrine habitat in Lake Tanganyika [46-48]
(see also refs. [9,22,64]) (Note that we did not use the first
Tanganyikan clade because of the apparently deviating
evolutionary rate in that clade and the possibility that S.
granulosus might represent a separate lineage that existed
before the formation of the lacustrine habitat in the Lake
Tanganyika basin); and (iii) the minimum age of about 20
million years for the most recent common ancestor
(MRCA) of the East African clade of Synodontis, based on
the oldest Synodontis fossils in that area [41-45]. We note
that these East African Synodontis fossils from the Early
Miocene have not been assigned to extant species (see e.g.,
ref. [45]), which is difficult due to the diversity of the family and the fact that the criteria used for the identification
of extant species are not applicable to the fossil specimens
[78]. However, because these Synodontis fossils resemble
extant East African species, and because of the rich fossil
record since the Miocene, it is highly likely that these specimens belong to the East African clade. The second and
third cycle of analyses aimed to corroborate internal calibrations. We, therefore, ran an analysis with a single calibration point at 20 million years for the minimum age of
the East African clade, and an analysis, in which we constrained the maximum age for S. njassae to one million
year and the minimum age for the East African clade to 20
million years.
