Abstract
Background: The Ashbya Genome Database (AGD) 3.0 is an innovative cross-species genome
and transcriptome browser based on release 40 of the Ensembl developer environment.
Description: AGD 3.0 provides information on 4726 protein-encoding loci and 293 non-coding
RNA genes present in the genome of the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii. A synteny viewer
depicts the chromosomal location and orientation of orthologous genes in the budding yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genome-wide expression profiling data obtained with high-density
oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChips) are available for nearly all currently annotated proteincoding loci in A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae.
Conclusion: AGD 3.0 hence provides yeast- and genome biologists with comprehensive report
pages including reliable DNA annotation, Gene Ontology terms associated with S. cerevisiae
orthologues and RNA expression data as well as numerous links to external sources of
information. The database is accessible at http://agd.vital-it.ch/.

Background
Approximately 90% of the genes present in the genomes
of the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii and the budding
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were found to be orthologous and syntenic [1]. This degree of similarity was
remarkable since both species display distinct morphologies as well as growth and differentiation properties. In
the case of Ashbya, for example, there is no evidence for
sexual reproduction although its genome contains the relevant complement of genes involved in yeast meiosis and
spore development [2]. Budding and fission yeasts are key
model organisms for high-throughput studies aiming at

elucidating gene function by deletion analysis [3,4],
expression profiling of conserved processes such as the
mitotic cell cycle [5-7] and meiotic development [8-10]
and by analysing protein localization [11] or protein-protein interaction patterns [12,13]. The data obtained in
these species are believed to be useful for analysing networks and predicting gene function in yeasts and related
organisms in the emerging field of systems biology [14].
Similar functional genomics and expression profiling
experiments are currently being carried out using A. gossypii but there is currently no comprehensive source of
information that provides cross-species coverage of highPage 1 of 7

throughput annotation, functional analysis and expression profiling data.
Technological progress in the field of DNA sequencing led
to the production of a huge amount of information and
spawned the development of appropriate bioinformatics
tools for DNA data interpretation and analysis. The
Ensembl project provides a comprehensive annotation
database covering 19 species. Moreover, it enables software engineers to build standalone applications within
the freely available Ensembl development environment
[15]. The urgent need for a global and coherent approach
to genome annotation has lead to the formation of the
Gene Ontology (GO) consortium. GO develops a controlled and structured vocabulary (Ontology) for describing
the process a gene product is involved in as well as its
molecular function and sub-cellular localization [16].
This effort has yielded annotation information very useful
for the categorization of genes across species and has
proven particularly pertinent for microarray data interpretation ([17] and references therein).
This paper reports the release of Ashbya Genome Database 3.0, an innovative cross-species genome and transcriptome browser based on the Ensembl environment.
The DNA annotation and high-density oligonucleotide
microarray RNA expression data available via AGD are
regularly updated to continue providing an excellent
source of online information for yeast and genome biologists.

Construction and content
AGD 3.0 was developed using the Ensembl Application
Programming Interface (API) and base web code release
40 [18-20]. Further details on the AGD developer environment have been published previously [21].
AGD 3.0 provides highly reliable and in many cases manually verified DNA annotation data on 4726 protein-coding genes present in the genome of A. gossypii.
GeneOntology annotation data associated with orthologues from S. cerevisiae are displayed in the A. gossypii
gene report page. Whole-genome expression profiling
data are displayed for 4451 annotated genes represented
in the database and present on proprietary GeneChips
used to study gene expression during A. gossypii spore germination (R. Rischatsch, P. Demougin, A. Gattiker, M.
Primig and P. Philippsen, unpublished). A number of
similar GeneChip-based transcriptome studies that cover
mitotic growth [5] and meiotic development [10,22,23]
in budding yeast have also been incorporated. This facilitates cross-species interpretation of transcriptional patterns and relative expression levels. Critically, the
expression signals were obtained with the same robust
microarray platform and experiments that are based on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/9

the same array architecture (e.g. Saccharomyces S98 and
Ashbya SYNG001 GeneChips) and are therefore directly
comparable even between species [24-26].
To analyze homology at the DNA and protein levels we
used BLASTZ [27] and BLAT [28] as implemented in the
Compara system [15]. Syntenic regions were computed by
merging homology regions (identified by BLASTZ) that
were in the same orientation and not more than 5000 bp
apart in both organisms. Among the set of merged
regions, only those covering at least 10000 bp were
retained to ensure that syntenic regions contained a
meaningful number of loci. Furthermore, complementary
data from the Orthologous Matrix project (using a conservative approach to the identification of orthologs) were
included to provide independent phylogenetic information on 287 species [29,30].

Utility and discussion
The database can be searched by using a systematic or
standard locus name (including aliases) from A. gossypii or
S. cerevisiae via the welcome page. A wildcard option is
provided (e.g. "CDC*"). Genes can also be searched
through cross-references to GenBank/EMBL Protein identification numbers, UniProt accession numbers and Gene
Ontology identifiers (e.g. "GO:0005737"). Finally, it is
possible to retrieve genes or genome regions by DNA
sequence coordinates.
The home page presents the A. gossypii genome as well as
links to navigate to the S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and N. crassa
genomes. The user can click on the karyotype or input
sequence coordinates to display a specific chromosome.
The MapView shows a summary display of the chromosome features. Clicking on a portion of the chromosome
brings up the ContigView that shows features at three different scales. In the DetailedView section, pop-up menus
can be used to display different features: genes, homologous regions from other fungal species mapped by
BLASTZ and, notably, the positions of the target
sequences covered by oligonucleotide probes on Ashbya
and yeast GeneChips. Selecting the "View alongside..."
option in the navigation menu brings up the MultiContigView, which displays homologous and syntenic (similarly oriented) genes from two species. The information in
the gene pages has been substantially extended since the
previous release [21]. Cross-references to Gene Ontology
(GO, based on data supplied by SGD in S. cerevisiae
homologs), GenBank/EMBL and UniProtKB have been
added. Clicking on a GO term allows browsing all entries
sharing a given annotation. Furthermore, links to facilitate information retrieval from external sources have been
added. This includes the display of recently published articles from the Google Scholar service, and the display of

The conservation of gene order across genomes can be visualized at two scales. The SyntenyView page is available
from the chromosome page and displays locations of
large-scale syntenic regions on the chromosomes of two
selected species (Figure 1, panel a). The MultiContigView
page can be accessed from the synteny view or from the
Orthologue Prediction section of a gene page and displays
the genomic maps of two organisms at a high resolution.
In that view, homologous genes are linked by blue lines
(panel b).
The gene report page contains a new section that displays
putative orthologs of genes present in the Ashbya genome.
Information from the Compara pipeline [15] and the
Orthologous Matrix (OMA) [29,30] is summarized. While
both methods start with an all-against-all Smith-Waterman protein similarity search the results are not identical
because different algorithms are used. Compara data indicate best reciprocal BLASTP hits among the four loaded
fungal genomes, indicating putative orthologs even with
relatively low similarity. OMA data contains 287 complete genomes from all kingdoms and attempts to detect
truly orthologous relationships.

sequence data and/or feature annotation within a certain
sequence range. Results of the microarray study using proprietary Ashbya GeneChips will be published elsewhere
and the raw expression signal values will be made available via ArrayExpress, a certified public repository at the
European Bioinformatics Institute [35].
Upcoming releases of AGD will contain information
about gene function from large-scale deletion studies in A.
gossypii and predicted protein-protein interaction data on
the basis of high-throughput studies in S. cerevisiae
[12,13]. Finally, high-density oligonucleotide microarray
expression data from the species represented in AGD will
continuously be integrated as they become available.

Conclusion
AGD 3.0 is a useful and innovative database for researchers in the yeast and genome evolution fields. The gene
annotation data is steadily verified and improved and it is
now complemented with high-density oligonucleotide
microarray expression data. This approach marks out
AGD 3.0 as the first database that enables users to view a
comprehensive report page including information on
gene DNA annotation and RNA expression across conserved fungal species.

Availability and requirements
A section of the report page covers microarray expression
data annotated using our Microarray Information Management and Annotation System (MIMAS) [33]. Users can
view information on the array type, experimental details
and a detailed sample history that is available in a popup
menu via clickable sample names. Normalized microarray
expression signals are displayed in the context of the DNA
annotation (Figure 2, panel a) in a bar diagram as linear
or log2-transformed values and the percentile of genes
transcribed at the given level is indicated. Currently,
expression levels are available from samples of germinating Ashbya somatic spores incubated in rich medium for
five, seven and nine hours (panel b). The array data volume is expected to increase in size rapidly as results from
ongoing research will constantly be added. By clicking on
the appropriate links in the "orthologs prediction" section
of the report page users can access comparable data available for mitotically growing and sporulating budding
yeast (panel c). It should be noted that the expression signals obtained with microarrays in different species indicate relative but not absolute mRNA levels.
The sequence and annotation information is kept synchronized between AGD and the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ
collaboration [34]. The data are accessible in any of the
databases under accession numbers AE016814 through
AE016821. The 'Export data' link in AGD also allows creating custom files in a range of formats containing
