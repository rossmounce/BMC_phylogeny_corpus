information

Conclusion: Our model suggests that the identified motifs of the ar-C enhancer function as binary
switches that are responsible for specific activity between midline tissues, and that these motifs are
adjusted during functional diversification of paralogs. The unraveled motif changes can also account
for the complex interpretation of activator and repressor input signals within a single enhancer.

interactions

Results: We demonstrate that the sonic hedgehog a (shha) paralogs sonic hedgehog b (tiggy winkle
hedgehog; shhb) genes of fishes have a modified ar-C enhancer, which specifies a diverged function
at the embryonic midline. We have identified several conserved motifs that are indicative of
putative transcription factor binding sites by local alignment of ar-C enhancers of numerous
vertebrate sequences. To trace the evolutionary changes among paralog enhancers, phylogenomic
reconstruction was carried out and lineage-specific motif changes were identified. The relation
between motif composition and observed developmental differences was evaluated through
transgenic functional analyses. Altering and exchanging motifs between paralog enhancers resulted
in reversal of enhancer specificity in the floor plate and notochord. A model reconstructing
enhancer divergence during vertebrate evolution was developed.

Background: Cis-regulatory modules of developmental genes are targets of evolutionary changes
that underlie the morphologic diversity of animals. Little is known about the 'grammar' of
interactions between transcription factors and cis-regulatory modules and therefore about the
molecular mechanisms that underlie changes in these modules, particularly after gene and genome
duplications. We investigated the ar-C midline enhancer of sonic hedgehog (shh) orthologs and
paralogs from distantly related vertebrate lineages, from fish to human, including the basal
vertebrate Latimeria menadoensis.

Background

Phylogenetic footprinting can predict conserved cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) of genes that span over a number of
transcription factor binding sites. However, divergence in
sequence and function of CRMs over large evolutionary distances may hinder the utility of phylogenetic footprinting
methodology [1-5]. Therefore, it is paramount also to investigate functionally the molecular mechanisms that underlie the
function and divergence of CRMs. A vexing problem in elucidating the evolution of CRMs is that only a relatively small
number of enhancers and other CRMs have thus far been
characterized in sufficient detail to allow development of
more general rules about their conserved structures and evolutionarily permitted modifications.
It is widely accepted that gene duplication is a major source
for the evolution of novel gene function, resulting ultimately
in increased organismal complexity and speciation [6-9]. It
has been speculated that the mechanism by which duplicated
genes are retained involves evolution of new expression times
or sites through changes in their regulatory control elements
[10-14]. An elaborate alternative model, called duplicationdegeneration-complementation (DDC), has been proposed
by Force and coworkers [15] to explain the retention of duplicated paralogs that occurs during evolution. Their model is
based on the (often) multifunctional nature of genes, which is
reflected by the multitude of regulatory elements specific to a
particular expression domain. Mutations in subsets of regulatory elements in either one of the duplicated paralogs may
result in postduplication spatial and temporal partitioning of
expression patterns (subfunctionalization) between them. As
a result, both paralogs can fulfil only a subset of complementary functions of the ancestral gene, and will thus be retained
by selection and not be lost secondarily (for review [16]).
The diversity of possible mechanisms of subfunctionalization
at the level of regulatory elements, however, is still poorly
understood because of the lack of thorough comparative
molecular evolutionary studies on cis-acting elements [2],
supported by experimental verification of their function.
Despite numerous presumed examples of subfunctionalization of gene expression patterns between paralogs, only two,
very recent reports have included the necessary experimental
verification of the hypothesis of subfunctionalization due to
changes in CRMs [17,18]. Several studies, however, have
implicated specific mutations in enhancers of parologous
gene copies to be the likely source of subfunctionalization in
duplicated hox2b, hoxb3a, and hoxb4a enhancers in fish [1921].
Here, we report on an investigation into the molecular mechanisms of paralog divergence at the CRM level through the
study of the duplicated shh genes in various lineages of 'fish',
including Latimeria menadoensis. Teleost fish are well suited
for analysis of cis-regulatory evolution in vertebrates [22,23].
Several teleost genomes have been sequenced, including

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R106

those of the green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), fugu (Takifugu rubripes), zebrafish (Danio rerio),
medaka (Oryzias latipes), and stickleback (Gasterosteus
aculeatus). Adding them to the many available mammalian
and anamniote vertebrate genomes covers a time span of 450
million years of evolution at different levels of genic and
genomic divergence. More importantly, gene regulatory elements isolated from fish are suitable for functionality testing
by transgenic analysis in well established model species such
as zebrafish. Aside from conventional transgenic lines [24],
CRMs can also be efficiently assayed directly in microinjected
transient transgenic fish by analysis of mosaic expression
through reporter activity [25-29]. Conserved sequences
between mammals and Japanese pufferfish were first suggested to allow for predictions regarding the location of regulatory sequence [30-33]. This approach, combined with
transgenic functional analysis, has allowed large-scale
enhancer screening technologies to be applied in zebrafish
[34-36].
The evolutionary history of the hedgehog gene family is well
understood [37], and its biologic role has been extensively
studied [38,39]. Comparative studies on the evolution of the
vertebrate hedgehog gene family [37,40] showed that two
rounds of duplication led to the evolution of three copies from
a single ancestral hedgehog gene: sonic hedgehog (shh),
indian hedgehog (ihh), and desert hedgehog (dhh). Several
lines of evidence indicate that a complete genome duplication
occurred early in the evolution of actinopterygian (rayfinned) fishes [41-46], leading to a large number of duplicated
copies of nonallelic genes being found in different groups of
teleosts [47-50]. Thus duplication of shh in the fish lineages
resulted in two parlogous genes, namely shha and shhb
[37,40], as well as duplication of ihh [51] and probably dhh
genes as well.
The genes shha and shhb are both expressed in the midline of
the zebrafish embryo [52]. There are, however, distinct differences between midline expression of the two paralogous
genes, which may have important implications for their cooperative function. Although shha is expressed in the floor plate
and the notochord, shhb is present only in the floor plate. Etheridge and coworkers [53] have shown that shha is expressed
in notochord precursors and shhb is exclusively expressed in
the overlying floor plate cells during gastrulation. Later, shha
is expressed both in the notochord and floor plate, whereas
shhb remains restricted to the floor plate [52]. The protein
activity of shhb is very similar to that of shha [54]. It is likely
that the concerted actions of shha and shhb are regulated
quantitatively by their partially overlapping and tightly controlled level of expression. Thus far, the function only of shha
has been studied in genetic mutants [55]. Nevertheless, morpholino knock-down and gene expression analyses identified
several functions of the shhb gene. The shhb gene was shown
to cooperate with shha in the midline to specify branchiomotor neurons, in somite patterning, but it is also required in the

throughout vertebrate evolution (Figure 1). The CRMs identified previously are conserved among shh(a) genes (orange
peaks), and the degree of their conservation is in accordance
with the evolutionary distance between the species compared.
In contrast, the zebrafish shhb gene exhibits no obvious conservation with the shha ar-A, ar-B, ar-C, and ar-D CRMs.
Apart from Shuffle Lagan, Valis [36] has also failed to detect
conserved putative CRMs of shhb (data not shown). Taken
together, these findings indicate that although orthologous
regulatory elements may exist between shhb and shha, they
are much less conserved at the DNA sequence level than are
shha elements, as detected by the applied alignment
programs.

interactions

To characterize individual regulatory elements better, we
focused on a single enhancer element ar-C, which is conserved between fish and mouse (SFPE2) and which has been
analyzed in considerable detail in both species [26,63,66]. To
this end, first we addressed whether the ar-C enhancer or its
mouse ortholog SFPE2 is detectable across shh(a) loci in various vertebrate species from different lineages that diverged
before and after the gene duplication event leading to the evolution of shh paralogs in zebrafish. Because the zebrafish shha
ar-C enhancer is located in the second intron of shha and
exhibits high sequence similarity to human and mouse counterparts, candidate ar-C containing intronic fragments of several vertebrate species were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) with degenerate oligonucleotide primers. We
cloned and sequenced the relevant genomic DNA fragments
from several fish species that experienced the genome duplication, such as the cyprinid tench (Tinca tinca), fugu, and
medaka [45]. In addition to actinopterygian fishes, several
species of sarcopterygians such as chick, mouse, and the early
sarcopterygian lineage Latimeria menadoensis were used in
the analysis. All sarcopterygians diverged from the common
ancestor with actinopterygians before the fish-specific
genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage. A sequence
comparison of intron 2 sequences from the available vertebrate model systems revealed a high degree of sequence similarity in all species specifically in the region that spans the
ar-C enhancer in zebrafish and the SFPE2 enhancers of
mouse (Figure 2a). This analysis also indicated that the
orthologous Latimeria genomic region also contains a highly
conserved stretch of sequence in the ar-C region, which is
consistent with the hypothesis that ar-C is an ancestral
enhancer of shh genes.

reports

Here, we show that a functional ar-C homolog exists in the
shha paralog shhb. Shhb ar-C is diverged in function and
became predominantly floor plate specific, similar to what
has been found in the mouse ar-C homolog SFPE2. By phylogenetic reconstruction, we were able to predict the motifs that
are required for the tissue-specific activity of the paralog
enhancers, and we identified the putative transcription factor
binding sites that were the likely targets of evolutionary
changes underlying the functional divergence of the two ar-C
enhancers of the shh paralogs. By engineering and exchanging mutations in both of the enhancers of shha and shhb, followed by transgenic analysis of the mutated enhancers, we
were able to recapitulate the predicted evolutionary events
and thus provide evidence for the likely mechanism of
enhancer evolution after gene duplication.

comment

The genomic locus of the zebrafish sonic hedgehog a gene is
well characterized, and a substantial amount of data on the
functionality of its cis-acting elements exist [26,61,62].
Enhancers that drive expression in the ventral neural tube
and notochord of the developing embryo reside in the two
introns and upstream sequences of both zebrafish and mouse
shh(a) genes [26,63]. Comparison of genomic sequences
between zebrafish and mammals in an effort to identify functional regulatory elements has verified the enhancers
detected initially by transgenic analysis [23,64,65]. The conserved zebrafish enhancer ar-C directs mainly notochord and
weak floor plate expression in zebrafish embryos [26,62].
This zebrafish enhancer also functions in the midline of
mouse embryos [26], suggesting that the cis-regulatory
mechanisms involved in regulating shh(a) expression are at
least in part conserved between zebrafish and mouse. However, the mouse enhancer, SFPE2 (sonic floor plate enhancer
2), which exhibits sequence similarity with ar-C of zebrafish,
is floor plate specific [63,66] and exhibits notochord activity
only in a multimerized and truncated form [66]. This difference in enhancer activity emphasizes the importance of
addressing the mechanisms of divergence in enhancer function between distantly related vertebrates. Given the observations on the ar-C enhancer in fish and mouse, we postulated
that this enhancer might have been a target of enhancer
divergence between shha and shhb paralogs in zebrafish during evolution.

upstream sequence from the transcriptional start site with
activity similar to the -563shha promoter described by Chang
and coworkers [67], linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP)
reporter. Transient mosaic expression of GFP was measured
as read-out of reporter construct activity by counting fluorescence-positive cells in the notochord and floor plate, where
the ar-C enhancer is active, in the trunk of 1-day-old embryo
(Table 1). This approach was a reliable substitute for the generation of stable transgenic lines, as reflected by the identical
results obtained with transient analysis and stable transgenic
lines made for a subset of the constructs used in this study
(Additional data file 1).
As described previously, the zebrafish ar-C enhancer is primarily active in the notochord and only weakly in the floor
plate (Figure 2c). Intron 2 sequences of tench, chick, and Latimeria shh genes gave strong enhancer activity in the notochord (Figure 2d-f). However, the mouse intron 2 (with the
SFPE2 enhancer) was found to be inactive in zebrafish (data
not shown), suggesting that SFPE2 had functionally diverged
during mammalian/mouse evolution either at the cis-regulatory or the trans-regulatory level. All together, these data

indicate a high degree of functional conservation between arC sequences among vertebrates.

Identification of a putative ar-C enhancer from shhb
genes
The evolutionary functional divergence of paralogous ar-C
enhancers was tested through the isolation of the shhb intron
2 from zebrafish. Because a genome duplication event has
taken place early in actinopterygian evolution, it was predicted that the ostariophysian and cyprinid zebrafish as well
as all acanthopterygian fish model species whose genomes are
known (medaka, stickleback, green spotted pufferfish, and
fugu) may contain a shhb homolog. Analysis of the available
genome sequences of these four species of teleost fish indicated that none of them carries a discernible shhb homolog,
suggesting that these lineages (which evolved some 290 million years after cyprinids [68]) may have secondarily lost this
shh paralog. Synteny is observed between the medaka
genomic region surrounding shh on chromosome 20 and a
region on chromosome 17; however, chromosome 17 lacks
shhb (Additional data file 2). This finding further supports
the hypothesis that a shhb gene was originally present after
duplication but has been lost secondarily during evolution.

information

To test whether the conserved sequence in the intron 2 of
shhb genes is indeed a putative enhancer element, we tested
several shhb fragments representing approximately 10 kb of
the locus in transgenic reporter assays. The shhb proximal
promoter and 2.7 kb of upstream sequences can activate GFP
expression in the notochord (Figure 3b) but only very weakly
in the floor plate, similarly to previously reported data [69].
Because shhb is only expressed in the floor plate and never in
the notochord, this GFP expression of the reporter is an

interactions

ar-C would be predicted to be located. This suggests that
intron 2 of shhb genes of cyprinids may contain a functional
enhancer, which has diverged significantly from the shha arC. Furthermore, the apparent sequence divergence suggests
that the function of the shhb enhancer may also have
diverged.

refereed research

However, we were able to detect and isolate shhb and its
intron 2 from another cyprinid species, tench, by PCR using
degenerate oligonucleotides that were designed in conserved
exon sequences. Importantly, the isolation of more than one
shhb intron 2 sequences from cyprinids allowed for phylogenetic footprinting of shhb genes and a search for a putative
ar-C homolog. We have compared the shha and shhb intron 2
sequences between zebrafish and tench (Figure 3a). The shha
orthologs between zebrafish and tench exhibit a high degree
of sequence similarity, which is strongest in the region in
which ar-C resides. In contrast, comparison of intron 2 from
shhb and shha paralogs of either species revealed no conspicuous conservation. The apparent lack of sequence similarity,
however, does not necessarily rule out the possibility that a
highly diverged ar-C homolog enhancer may still reside in
shhb intron 2. A sequence comparison between zebrafish and
tench shhb intron 2 reveals a striking sequence similarity in
the 3' region close to exon 3, where a positionally conserved

ectopic activity and reflects the lack of a notochord repressing
functional element, probably located elsewhere in the unexplored sequences around the shhb locus. The weak expression
in the floor plate suggests that other CRMs are required for
floor plate activation. In shha a floor plate enhancer resides in
intron 1 [26]. To check whether a similar enhancer exists in
shhb, intron 1 of shhb was attached to the promoter construct.
It was found that it did not enhance the promoter's activity,
indicating no obvious enhancer function in this transgenic
context (Figure 3c). Interestingly, the addition of shhb intron
2 does result in enhancement of expression in the floor plate
(Figure 3d). This finding indicates that intron 2 of shhb contains a floor plate enhancer.
The 2.7 kb upstream and proximal promoter sequence of
shhb may have influenced the autonomous function of an
enhancer in intron 2. To address the activator functions of the
identified shha and shhb enhancers without influence of
potential upstream regulatory elements, a series of injection
experiments was carried out in which the enhancer activities
were analyzed with a minimal promoter containing only 0.8
kb of the shha promoter (Figure 3e-j). Moreover, activity of
intron 2 sequences from shha and shhb genes from both
zebrafish and tench were systematically compared. Shha
intron 2 fragments of both species consistently resulted in
comparable notochord activity (Figure 3f and Additional data
file 1 [parts B and C]), wheres the shhb intron 2 fragment from

both species exhibited distinct enhancement of expression in
the floor plate and reduction in GFP activity in the notochord
(Figure 3g,h). The presence of a highly conserved region
within the intron 2 of zebrafish and tench shhb genes strongly
suggests that the floor plate enhancer activity is the property
of this conserved sequence. To test this prediction a set of
deletion analysis experiments was carried out. Zebrafish shhb
intron 2 was cleaved into a 1,026 base pair (bp) fragment of
nonconserved and a 380 bp conserved sequence. As shown in
Figure 3i,j, the floor plate specific enhancer effect is retained
by the conserved fragment but not by the non-conserved
sequence, verifying the prediction of the location of the floor
plate enhancer. Taken together, a diverged, floor plate active
ar-C enhancer has been discovered in the shhb intron 2,
which is consistent with the floor plate specific expression of
shhb in zebrafish.

Prediction of functionally relevant motifs by
phylogenetic reconstruction
Transcription factor binding sites may be more conserved
than the surrounding sequences [70]. We have hypothesized
that sequence similarity between fish and human ar-C
sequences may indicate conserved motifs, which may reflect
conserved transcription factor binding sites [66]. We postulated that putative transcription factor binding sites and
changes in them may be detectable by identification of motifs
using local alignment of ar-C from large numbers of pre-

A pattern of conserved motifs is detected in the form of homology blocks extending to 20 to 30 bp. These conserved motifs
exhibit distinct distribution characteristics, which reflect
phylogenic as well as paralogy and orthology relationships
between shh genes. C1 and C3 are homology blocks, which are
present in all shh sequences, including shhb paralogs, in all

species analyzed. In contrast, C2 and C4 are homology blocks
that are present only in shh(a) genes but absent in shhb genes.
Because C2 and C4 are present in pre-duplicated enhancers of
sarcopterygians, the lack of C2 and C4 in shhb enhancers is
probably due to a secondary loss of these elements after the
fish-specific gene duplication. The two sets of putative binding sites (C1/C3 and C2/C4, respectively) may thus be targets
for transcription factors that regulate the differential
enhancer activities of shh(a) (predominantly notochord
expression) and shhb (predominant floor plate expression).
In conclusion, we identified a set of putative targets of mutations that may contribute to the divergence of ar-C enhancer
functions after gene duplication.

Sequence comparison identifies phylogeny-specific, paralogy-specific, and orthology-specific conserved motifs in ar-C sequences
Figure 4
Sequence comparison identifies phylogeny-specific, paralogy-specific, and orthology-specific conserved motifs in ar-C sequences. Multiple alignment of ar-C
homolog sequences of shh(a) and shhb genes of different vertebrate species was carried out. The phylogenetic tree on the left side represents the
evolutionary relationship of the vertebrates. Species in blue correspond to ar-C of shh(a) genes, and those in red to ar-C of shhb genes. Dark blue boxes
depict the conserved motifs, present in both shh(a) and shhb ar-C genes. Light-blue boxes mark motifs present only in shhb genes.

Functional analysis of conserved motifs reveals the
evolutionary changes that likely contributed to the
enhancer divergence of shh paralogs
To test the functional significance of the two sets of homology
blocks, we conducted a systematic mutation analysis of the C1
to C4 conserved homology blocks in both shha and shhb
genes. Furthermore, we carried out exchange of homology
blocks between shha and shhb ar-C enhancers to test whether
evolutionary changes after gene duplication can be modeled
in a transgenic zebrafish system.
As shown in Figure 5b-f, mutations inserted into homology
blocks (C1 to C4) result in dramatic changes in shha ar-C
enhancer activity. Replacement of C1 with random sequence
results in total loss of ar-C enhancer function, indicating that
this binding site is critical for shha ar-C activity (Figure 5b).
By contrast, loss of C3 results in no observable effect, suggesting that this conserved block is either not required for
enhancer function or only necessary for functions that are not

detectable in our transgenic system (Figure 5d). Importantly,
removal of C2 or C4 (the blocks that are only present in shha
genes) results in strong expression of GFP in the floor plate
(Figure 5c,e). In the case of C4 removal, a reduced reporter
expression in the notochord has also been observed (Figure
5e). The obtained expression pattern strongly resembles the
activity of the wild type shhb ar-C enhancer (compare panels
e and g of Figure 5). Thus, removal of shha-specific motifs
from the shha ar-C mimics shhb ar-C enhancers. Moreover,
this result is consistent with a model in which the C2 and C4
elements are targets for repressors of floor plate expression in
the shha ar-C enhancer.
The multiple alignment of ar-C homolog sequences revealed
a noticeable modification in the C4 element of acanthopterygian fishes, which do not have a shh paralog (fpr example,
medaka and fugu; see Figure 4 and Additional data file 3 for
alternative alignment results). The divergence in the C4 motif
of acanthopterygians may reflect a functional change in the

Discussion

information

It has long been suggested [72,73] that a major driving force
in evolution of animal shape results from divergence of cisregulatory elements of genes. Recent years have provided evidence in support of this hypothesis [11-13,74-76]. However,
the mechanisms of regulatory evolution are still poorly

We next asked whether shhb ar-C is active in the floor plate
because it contains the general midline activator site C1 and
lacks the floor plate repressor elements C2 and C4 that are
present in the shha ar-C enhancer. To this end, we first tested
whether the C1 and C3 of shhb are required for the function of
the shhb enhancer. Similar to the results obtained with shha,
C1 was found to be critical for the activity of shhb ar-C (compare panels b and h of Figure 5), whereas loss of C3 had no
effect, thus mimicking the findings in shha (Figire 5i). We
then introduced C2 or C4 into the shhb enhancer in order to
test the functional significance of the lack of C2 and C4 motifs
in shhb. When a shh-derived C2 was introduced into shhb arC, no effect was observed (Figure 5j), but introduction of the

C4 putative floor plate repressor motif from shha did result in
a dramatic shift in shhb enhancer activity (Figure 5k). The
effect was a repression of floor plate expression while
notochord activity was retained, thus resembling the wildtype or C2 mutant shha ar-C enhancer (Figure 5a,c). In a control experiment, random DNA sequence was introduced at
similar positions into the shhb ar-C enhancer. However, this
manipulation had no effect on the activity of shhb ar-C (data
not shown), indicating that the changes observed with the C4
insertion are due to the specific sequence of C4. These results
together strongly suggest that the function of C4 is to repress
floor plate activation by the shha ar-C enhancer. Together,
these findings are consistent with a model in which loss of the
C4 motif in the evolution of the shhb ar-C has contributed to
its floor plate specific activity.

ar-C enhancer in these species, potentially leading to the
relaxation of the floor plate repression observed in ar-C of
shha genes. To test whether the modification of the C4 motif
of acathopterygians may reflect the loss or modification of C4
repressor function, we have replaced the C4 of zebrafish shha
with that of medaka shh. The resulting hybrid construct activated strong expression in the floor plate (Figure 5f), suggesting that the medaka C4 motif is unable to rescue the
repressing activity of zebrafish shha C4 in zebrafish embryos.

understood [1,5,77,78]. In this report, we have systematically
analyzed the evolutionary history of a single enhancer of
orthologous and paralogous shh genes during vertebrate phylogeny. By constructing multiple alignments, we were able to
predict which motifs within the ar-C enhancer represent regulatory input. Through specific mutations and exchanges of
motifs, we mimicked probable evolutionary events in transgenic analysis and identified the lineage-specific modifications that lead to discernible changes in tissue-specific
enhancer activity in embryo development.

Identification and functional verification of a diverged
ar-C enhancer
Using phylogenetic footprinting of intron 2 of shhb genes we
have identified a conserved ar-C homolog enhancer in two
species of cyprinids. The results of our transgenic analysis
indicate that the ar-C sequences in intron 2, together with the
promoter activity of shhb [69], contribute to this gene's
activity in the floor plate. Although shh(a) enhancers retained
significant sequence similarity with their orthologs, the whole
of the shhb gene and its ar-C enhancer is grossly changed
from that of shha paralogs. This paralog-specific change happened despite the fact that shhb had equal time and chance to
diverge as did shha after duplication from an ancestral sonic
hedgehog gene. This result is in accordance with observations
indicating selective pressure on the CRMs of paralogs in
invertebrates [79] as well as in vertebrates [19,20,80,81]. Our
results, together with the reports cited above, provide experimental support to the notion that differential divergence of
noncoding conserved elements of paralogs may be a general
phenomenon in vertebrates [35].

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R106

represent functional binding sites for developmental regulatory transcription factors.
The ar-C enhancer is composed of motifs with different regulatory capacities (Figure 6a). Motifs exist that are crucial for
the overall activity of the enhancer (C1), whereas other
repressor motifs refine enhancer activity (C2 and C4). This
indicates that the overall activity output of an enhancer in
midline tissues is subject to both activator and repressor
functions acting in concert. These results are in accordance
with the previously proposed grammar of developmentally
regulated gene expression [11,82-87]. Importantly, the order
and combination of motifs of ar-C are conserved. This is a
very different result from that proposed for the stripe 2
enhancers of drosophilids, in which the functional conservation of CRMs was a result of stabilizing selection of reshuffled
transcription factor binding site composition [1,77]. The
evolutionary pressure to keep the order and composition of
binding sites within enhancers may be limited to transcription factor and developmental regulatory genes [88,89]. The
high conservation level, however, may be a consequence of
selective pressure acting on a secondary function of enhancer
sequences [90].
Previously, individual binding sites were identified through
comparative approaches in vertebrates (for instance, see
[66,91,92]). These examples, together with our systematic
analysis of conserved motifs in the ar-C enhancers, demonstrate that functionally relevant motifs detected by sequence
alignment may aid in identifying as yet unknown and uncharacterized functional transcription factor binding sites.

Identification of putative transcription factor binding
sites by local alignment of multiple species

Phylogenetic reconstruction of enhancer divergence at
the level of conserved motifs

Use of a local sequence alignment approach of representative
species of major vertebrate lineages allowed us to predict
functionally relevant motifs within the ar-C enhancers. Our
findings are most consistent with a model in which these
motifs are individual or multimeric transcription factor binding sites. Mutation and transgenic analysis verified the functional relevance of these motifs in driving expression in the
midline, and therefore the most parsimonious explanation
for the conservation of these sequence elements is that they

The use of large numbers of species spanning long evolutionary distances allowed us to generate a phylogenetic reconstruction of enhancer divergence before and after gene
duplication (Figure 6b). By generating artificial enhancers
with mutations that mimic the predicted lineage-specific
changes in motif composition of shhb and shha enhancers, we
were able to reconstruct the probable evolutionary events
leading to divergence of the ar-C enhancer function. For
example, insertion of the floor plate repressor C4 element

The mechanism of functional divergence of ar-C enhancers of duplicated shh genes in zebrafish. (a) Model for motif structure and interaction in ar-C
enhancers involved in the regulation of midline expression of shha and shhb in zebrafish. Schemes on the top and bottom represent the structure of the arC enhancer of shha (blue) and shhb (red) with the position of the conserved motifs indicated in colored boxes, as in Figures 4 and 5. In the middle,
schematic cross-sections of the neural tube with the floor plate (fp) and the notochord (nt) are shown (ventral to the left). Dark green indicates strong
enhancer activity. Arrows indicate activator and blunt arrows indicate repression function by individual motifs. (b) Evolution of ar-C enhancers of
vertebrates. Phylogenetic relationship of the genes and the motif composition of the respective ar-C enhancers are shown. Shha gene enhancers are shown
in blue and shhb gene enhancers in red. On the left, a predicted pre-duplicated ancestral shha ar-C enhancer is shown. Below, the predicted activity of the
ancestral shha gene is depicted in blue in a schematic cross-section of an embryonic midline. On the right, schematic cross sections of midlines in green
indicate ar-C (SFPE2 [sonic floor plate enhancer 2]) enhancer activities; shades of green indicate strength of enhancer activity in the respective midline
tissues. In blue the expression activity of the respective shha/shhb genes are shown.

into shhb resulted in enhancer activity reminiscent of shha
ar-C, in which the C4 site had been identified. These findings
indicate that the very changes that resulted in the divergence
of the enhancer function have been identified.
An open question remains, however; why should the ar-C
enhancer of shha be repressed in the floor plate while the
shha gene is well known to be active in this tissue? The level
of the Hedgehog morphogen signal emanating from the
embryonic midline is critical for correct patterning of the ventral neural tube [93]. Animals with only one gene encoding
the Sonic hedgehog protein (sarcopterygians and fishes without shhb) achieve this by controlled activation of shh in the
notochord and floor plate as a result of a combination of several synergistic enhancers [62,63]. In zebrafish and other
ostaryophisian species (for instance, tench and Mexican cavefish) a second copy of shh paralog (shhb) also contributes to
Shh production in the floor plate. At least in zebrafish, controlled levels of the floor plate expressed shhb are required,
together with the notochord and floor plate derived shha, for
normal patterning of branchiomotor neurons and the somites
[56-58]. The combined activity of two shh genes emerging
from the floor plate and notochord may thus result in one of
the paralog floor plate enhancers being subjected to selection
pressure. For example, to counter the overproduction of
Hedgehog levels, the reduction in transcription can occur by
blocking the activity of one of the synergistically active
enhancers (in this case ar-C). It is important to note, however, that the shh(a) ar-C enhancers are not exclusively
expressed in the notochord, and retained a weaker but still
noticeable capacity to activate expression in the floor plate.
Thus, the output of Shh levels in zebrafish appears to be a
subject of quantitative regulation of paralog enhancer activities. Alternatively, it is feasible that there are time points
when the two paralog genes are not overlapping in expression
and the complementing specificities of shhb and shha ar-C
enhancers reflect the non-overlapping production of Hedgehog proteins in the two midline tissues [53].

Subfunctionalization by fission or binary switch in
midline specificity of enhancers during evolution
Recent reports have provided experimental verification of
subfunctionalization of Hox gene enhancers [17,18]. Our
report adds to those findings by contributing evidence for the
diversity of subfunctionalization mechanisms that may act on
paralog enhancers during evolution. Here, we propose that
the presence or absence of the C4 site functions as a binary
switch to modulate ar-C enhancer activity specific to one of
two midline tissues after gene duplication. By selective
removal of repressor and activator binding sites, subfunctionalization of the ar-C enhancer to floor plate or notochord can
thus occur (Figure 6b). This model is reminiscent of those
proposed for subfunctionalization of CRMs [15].
The subfunctionalization model would argue for the existence
of a preduplication (sarcopterygian) ar-C enhancer that is

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R106

equally active in both floor plate and notochord. Interestingly, the mouse ar-C homolog SFPE2 enhancer is mainly
active in the floor plate of the mouse [63] and can activate
notochord expression in a multimerized form [66] (Figure
6b). However, in fish all shh ar-C enhancers from sarcopterygian lineages exhibit notochord-specific enhancer activity.
The differences between zebrafish and mouse may be
explained both by subfunctionalization mechanisms as well
as by trans-acting factor changes. In support of trans changes
the mouse SFPE2 enhancer exhibited no activity in the fish.
In the converse experiment, the mainly notochord-specific
zebrafish shha ar-C exhibited both floor pate and notochord
activity in mouse [26]. Thus, the subfunctionalization of
duplicated ar-C shh enhancers is a composite result of selective loss of several motifs, including negative regulatory elements in one enhancer (shhb) paralleled by modifications
either on the cis or on the trans level to restrict activity of the
less diverged sister paralog enhancer (shha). The prediction
from this model is that fish species without shhb gene (acantopterygii) may have floor plate active ar-C enhancer. Interestingly, the floor plate repressor elements (C2/C4) of shha
ar-C of acanthopterygians (for example, medaka and fugu)
are present but diverged from all other shh(a) homologs
(Figure 4), and they may thus represent the evolutionary
changes that lead to retention of shh ar-C floor plate activity
in these fish lineages. Our experiments with the medaka shh
C4 element replacing that of zebrafish shha provide further
support to the model outlined above. The hybrid zebrafish
shha ar-C construct with the modified medaka C4 motif cannot rescue the loss of the zebrafish shha C4 element and does
not function as a repressor site in zebrafish. These findings
are in line with a predicted compensatory relaxation of
repressor function of shh ar-C in medaka.
The combination of both negative and positive regulatory
sites within a single enhancer indicates the integration of activating and repressing signals to modulate the resulting transcriptional activity. This could be achieved through multiple
trans-acting factors that interact with a series of binding sites
within the ar-C enhancer. Determining which transcription
factors bind to the C1 to C4 blocks remains a challenge for
future research. Predictions can be made based on known
transcription factor recognition sequences. For instance, C1
contains a foxA2 binding sequence, which is consistent with
the previously suggested role of this factor in regulating shh
gene expression in the midline of mouse [66,94], frog [95],
and fish [67]. Interestingly, C4 carries a sequence identical to
the homeobox binding site that has been described to be
present in the mouse SFPE2 enhancer [66]. This binding site
is required for floor plate activity in the mouse. The identity
of the mouse binding factor and whether the same transcription factor acts (probably by repressing floor plate activity) in
the ar-C enhancer in zebrafish are unknown. The relevance of
specific transcription factors from large protein families in
binding to the ar-C binding sites remains a challenging question. It is important to note, however, that the functionally

In conclusion, the observed changes in the duplicated shh arC enhancers provided novel insights into the functional components of enhancer divergence in an important developmental regulator gene. In particular, our findings demonstrate
that phylogenetic reconstruction using large number of vertebrate species can identify a series of lineage specific motifs
that were the probable targets of evolutionary change and
represent individual regulatory input acting in concert on a
developmentally regulated gene enhancer. These findings
reinforce the importance of the phylogenomic and functional
analysis of duplicated cis-regulatory elements in deciphering
the cis-regulatory code of developmental gene regulation.

The 0.8shha:gfp plasmid was constructed by cutting out the

the respective intron 2 fragments from pCRII-TOPO:t-shhaI2 and pCRII-TOPO:t-shhb-I2, and subcloning them in
0.8shha:gfp using NotI/KpnI restriction sites. The
0.8shha:gfp:l-shh-I2 was constructed by reamplifying the
intron 2 part from the correct PCR fragment isolated from the
BAC clone and cloning it into 0.8shha:gfp (NotI/KpnI). The
0.8shha:gfp:c-shh-I2 and 0.8shha:gfp:m-shh-I2 palsmids
were made by direct cloning of the respective intron 2 fragments, amplified from genomic DNA, into 0.8shha:gfp
(NotI/KpnI). The 0.8shha:gfp:z-shhb-non-cons and
0.8shha:gfp:z-shhb-arC were made by cloning the PCRamplified nonconserved 5' part of z-shhb I2 (1032 bp) and the
380 bp 3' part containing the conserved region (ar-C) into
0.8shha:gfp (NotI/KpnI). All plasmids (0.8shha:gfp:z-shhaarCΔC1, 0.8shha:gfp:z-shha-arCΔC2, 0.8shha:gfp:z-shhaarCΔC3; 0.8shha:gfp:z-shha-arCΔC4, 0.8shha:gfp:z-shhaarC+C4m, 0.8shha:gfp:z-shhb-arCΔC1, and 0.8shha:gfp:zshhb-arCΔC3) containing z-shha-ar-C or z-shhb ar-C carrying mutations in one of the conserved motifs (C1 to C4) were

relevant sequences in SFPE2 that are responsible for floor

with ar-C sequences that are functionally relevant in
zebrafish, and this divergence may explain, at least in part,
the different results obtained with mouse and fish enhancers.

based approach. The same method was used to introduce the
C2 and C4 from z-shha ar-C or random sequence into z-shhb
ar-C (0.8shha:gfp:z-shhb-arC+C2, 0.8shha:gfp:z-shhbarC+C4,
0.8shha:gfp:z-shhb-arC+C2rnd,
and
0.8shha:gfp:z-shhb-arC+C4rnd). The PCR products were
cloned into 0.8shha:gfp (NotI/KpnI) and verified by
sequencing.
The zebrafish shha ar-C [26] and shhb ar-C sequences can be
found in GenBank under the following accession numbers:
AL929206 (gi|34221785|, emb|AL929206.6|, region: 111,511
to 111,717 bp) for the shha ar-C and BX510360 (gi|46518135|,
emb|BX510360.8|, region: 88,241 to 88,620 bp) for the shhb
ar-C. The GenBank accession numbers for tench shha and
shhb and Latimeria shh intron 2 sequences are as follows:
EF593170, EF593171, and EF593172. For more detailed information about the sequences, which have been mutated and
introduced in shha and shhb ar-Cs, see Table 2. The plasmid
2.7shhb:gfp was constructed by replacing the 2.4shha promoter fragment (SalI/XhoI) from 2.4shha:gfp with the PCRamplified 2.7 kb shhb promoter fragment (upstream from the
translation start site). The plasmid 2.7shhb:gfp:z-shhb-I1
and 2.7shhb:gfp:z-shhb-I2 were made by subcloning the
shhb I1 and I2 from 2.4shha:gfp:shhb-I1 and
2.4shha:gfp:shhb-I2 (Müller and coworkers, unpublished
data) into 2.7shhb:gfp (NotI/KpnI). For sequence information on the oligonucleotides that were used, see Table 3. More
detailed information about the plasmid constructions is available upon request.

Microinjection and expression analysis
All microinjection experiments were performed with injection solution containing circular plasmid at a concentration of
10 to 15 ng/μl, supplemented with 0.1% phenol red. The solu-

tion was injected trough the chorion into the cytoplasm of
zygotes. The GFP expression was analyzed on 24-hour-old
embryos using Leica MZ FLIII fluorescent stereomicroscope
(Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). The level of
expression was quantified by counting the number of GFPpositive cells in notochord and floor plate, as well as the
number of ectopic GFP-positive cells in tissues where shh(a)
and shhb are normally not expressed.

Sequence alignments and analysis
Pair-wise sequence aliments were performed using one of the
global alignment algorithms, namely AVID [97] in the case of
intronic sequences (Figures 2a and 3a) and Shuffle-Lagan
[98] in case of the whole hh loci (Figure 1), and visualized
using Vista [99,100].
The multiple alignment of the intronic sequences was made
using two algorithms, namely CHAOS/DIALIGN [71] or
MUSCLE [101,102], and visualized using BioEdit (sequence
alignment editor written by Tom Hall, Ibis Therapeutics,
Carlsbad, CA, USA).
