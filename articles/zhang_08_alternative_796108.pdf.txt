Abstract
Background: GFG/NUDT is a nudix hydrolase originally identified as the product of the fibroblast
growth factor-2 antisense (FGF-AS) gene. While the FGF-AS RNA has been implicated as an
antisense regulator of FGF-2 expression, the expression and function of the encoded GFG protein
is largely unknown. Alternative splicing of the primary FGF-AS mRNA transcript predicts multiple
GFG isoforms in many species including rat. In the present study we focused on elucidating the
expression and subcellular distribution of alternatively spliced rat GFG isoforms.
Results: RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry revealed tissue-specific GFG mRNA isoform
expression and subcellular distribution of GFG immunoreactivity in cytoplasm and nuclei of a wide
range of normal rat tissues. FGF-2 and GFG immunoreactivity were co-localized in some, but not
all, tissues examined. Computational analysis identified a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS)
in the N-terminus of three previously described rGFG isoforms. Confocal laser scanning
microscopy and subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that all rGFG isoforms bearing the MTS
were specifically targeted to mitochondria whereas isoforms and deletion mutants lacking the MTS
were localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Mutation and deletion analysis confirmed that the
predicted MTS was necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial compartmentalization.
Conclusion: Previous findings strongly support a role for the FGF antisense RNA as a regulator
of FGF2 expression. The present study demonstrates that the antisense RNA itself is translated,
and that protein isoforms resulting form alternative RNA splicing are sorted to different subcellular
compartments. FGF-2 and its antisense protein are co-expressed in many tissues and in some cases
in the same cells. The strong conservation of sequence and genomic organization across animal
species suggests important functional significance to the physical association of these transcript
pairs.

Background
The FGF-2 gene is post-transcriptionally regulated by an
endogenous complementary (antisense) mRNA transcribed from the GFG/NUDT6 gene on the opposite DNA
strand (Fig. 1). The FGF antisense (FGF-AS) transcript was
first identified in Xenopus laevis [1] and has since been
identified in a variety of other vertebrate species including
chicken [2], rat [3] and human [4,5]. The highly conserved organization and sequence of the FGF-2 and GFG
genes across many vertebrate species suggest that this
structural relationship has an important function. The
sense and antisense RNAs form stable dsRNA complexes
in vivo and it is believed that antisense RNA plays a role in
the regulation of FGF-2 mRNA stability [1] and translation [6]. The inverse association between FGF-2 and FGFAS mRNA levels in a variety of tissues during development
supports the notion of a regulatory function of the antisense RNA [2,4,7,8]. We recently reported that overexpression of FGF-AS reduced cellular FGF-2 content and
delayed S-phase progression in a rat glioma cell line [9].
In addition to its role as a regulatory RNA, the FGF-AS
transcript encodes GFG, an evolutionarily conserved
nudix motif protein of unknown function [10]. GFG
belongs to the Nudix hydrolase (NUDT) superfamily,
characterized by a consensus signature sequence
GX5EX7REUXEEXGU (the Nudix box), where X may be
any amino acid and U represents one of the bulky hydrophobic amino acids, usually Ile, Leu or Val [11,12]. The
major substrates of these hydrolase enzymes are nucleoside diphosphates linked to some other moiety X, hence
the acronym Nudix [11]. The founding member of this
family, the prokaryotic MutT protein, is responsible for
removing 8-oxo-dGTP from the nucleotide pool, thus preventing transversion mutations caused by mis-incorporation of 8-oxo-guanine residues into DNA [13]. The
InterPro database [14] currently contains 2226 nudix
motif proteins from over 360 species ranging from viruses
to man. Nudix hydrolases can be grouped into distinct
subfamilies according to their specificities for substrates,
including intact and oxidatively damaged (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates, dinucleoside polyphosphates, nucleotide sugars, NADH, ADP-ribose, dinucleotide
coenzymes, and mRNA (reviewed in [11,15]).
In humans, alternative splicing of the FGF-AS mRNA gives
rise to 3 isoforms of GFG, the largest of which contains a
mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). We recently
demonstrated that the MTS is necessary and sufficient for
mitochondrial targeting of hGFGa, whereas hGFGb and
hGFGc are localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus [16]. In
rat the FGF-AS mRNA is also alternatively spliced, resulting in at least 3 transcripts [6], but the subcellular distribution of their protein products is unclear. Our initial
immunohistochemical characterization using antibodies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/10

against the nudix domain, and C-terminal peptide of rat
GFG, indicated a predominantly nuclear localization in
liver. However, Western blotting of liver subcellular fractions identified GFG immunoreactivity in both the
nuclear and mitochondrial fractions [17]. In contrast,
localization was exclusively cytoplasmic in transiently
and stably transfected rat pituitary-derived GH4 mammosomatotroph cells [18] but both cytoplasmic and nuclear
in a rat lymphoma cell line [19]. The diverse subcellular
localization of GFG could reflect either differential subcellular trafficking of the alternatively spliced isoforms, or
interaction with lineage-dependent cell-specific factors.
Determining the subcellular localization of GFG isoforms
may provide insight into their function in the cell.
We focused here on elucidating the expression and subcellular distribution of the previously identified rat GFG isoforms [6]. Using computational analysis, we identified a
putative mitochondrial targeting signal peptide (MTS) at
the N-termini of GFG proteins in a variety of animal species including rat. Confocal laser scanning microscopy of
cells transiently or stably transfected with individual GFGGFP fusion constructs and deletion mutants revealed that
recombinant rat GFG isoforms are targeted to mitochondria by means of the N-terminal MTS, while GFG proteins
lacking the MTS are distributed in cytoplasm and nucleus.
This pattern of distribution is consistent with the tissue
specific expression of GFG in a variety of tissues.

Results
Computational analysis of GFG mRNAs and their protein
products
The rat FGF2/GFG gene locus maps to 2q25 and covers
more than 34 kb. The full-length rat FGF-2 mRNA contains 3 exons and encodes at least 4 FGF-2 isoforms
derived by alternative translation initiation. The overlapping GFG mRNA contains five exons and encodes a 35
kDa nudix-motif protein [3]. Two alternative splicing variants, GFGΔ2 (supporting clone, AAF07934) lacking exon
2 and GFGΔ2/3 (AAF07935) lacking exons 2 and 3
encode, respectively, rGFGΔ2, a 28 kDa nudix-motif protein, and rGFGΔ2/3, a 12 kDa protein lacking a nudix
motif [6]. Antisera against the COOH-terminal or the
Nudix domain detect the full length (35 kDa) and GFGΔ2
(28 kDa) isoforms in homogenates of rat C6 glioma cells
and in normal rat liver [3,6]. The predicted GFGΔ2/3 isoform does not contain the epitopes recognized by either
of these antisera as the splice event introduces shift in the
open reading frame, upstream of the MutT domain [6]. In
addition to the GFG isoforms shown here, the Celera rat
genome assembly database also predicts 2 N-terminally
truncated GFG isoforms consisting of the C-terminal 160
amino acids (protein id = EDM01308.1) and C-terminal
147 amino acids (protein id = EDM01307.1) relative to
the full length 35 kDa protein [20,21].

which we have previously shown to be localized to cytoplasm and nuclei [16].

GFG contains a Mitochondrial Targeting Signal Peptide
The sequence of GFG is evolutionarily conserved from
insects to humans particularly in the region of the nudix
box domain (Fig 2). Although the sequences are more
divergent at the N-terminus, comparison of twelve GFG
homologues from a variety of animal species identified a
potential mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) sequence
at the N-terminus in all species examined (Fig. 3a and
Table 1). In contrast, GFG homologues from plants did
not contain an identifiable N-terminal MTS (Table 1).
Except for the MTS and the conserved nudix signature
sequence, no other functional motifs or subcellular localization signal sequences were identified in any GFG
homologues (not shown). TargetP and iPSORT identified
an N-terminal signal peptide or subcellular compartment
targeting presequence. In human only the hGFGa isoform
contains an MTS sequence [16]. In contrast, in the rat
exon 1 is common to all three previously characterized
FGF-AS splice variants, and all three rat GFG isoforms contain a putative MTS (Fig 3a). However, the Celera rat
genome assembly database also predicts an N-terminally
truncated rGFG lacking the MTS sequence (Fig 3a,
raGFGc). This predicted isoform shares more than 80%
amino acid identity with human GFGb (NP_932158),

Although the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the full
length rGFG differs from that of hGFGa, it is structurally
similar, with a high content of positively charged residues,
(21% in the MTS vs. 12% on average) as well as hydrophobic and hydroxylated amino-acid residues. Furthermore, the N-terminus contains a potential mitochondrial
processing peptidase cleavage site between residues 28
and 29 (Fig. 3a). Secondary structure prediction with
ANTHEPROT shows that amino acids 3–17 of rGFG (and
residues of 7–18 of the hGFGa) can potentially form an
amphiphilic α-helix (Fig. 3B). These features are common
to several well-characterized mitochondrial translocation
signals [22,23]. Unlike in human, the N-terminal
sequence of rat and mouse GFG also contains a monobasic prohormone cleavage site at arginine 26 (probability
0.99; NeuroPred [24]). Cleavage at this site eliminates the
MTS, raising the possibility that alternative postranslational processing may also play a role in determining the
subcellular distribution of rat GFG.

panels. As shown in Fig. 4, GFG mRNA transcripts were
detected in all tissues examined, although tissue-specific
differences in isoform expression were observed. Only
liver, kidney and skeletal muscle expressed all three FGFAS isoforms at readily detectable levels. In contrast, in
lung all transcripts of FGF-AS mRNA were at the limit of

Subcellular distribution of rat GFG
Although computational analysis predicts an N-terminal
MTS in rat GFG, our previous results identified rat GFG
immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of transiently or stably
transfected rat pituitary GH4 cells [18] and in the nucleus
of rat C6 glioma cells [10,17]. To confirm the predicted Nterminal MTS experimentally, and to clarify these conflicting results, we examined the subcellular distribution of rat
GFG using rGFG-GFP fusion constructs. The rat FGF-AS
cDNA containing the complete open reading frame of
GFG was fused in-frame to the 5'-end of green fluorescent
protein (GFP) gene and inserted in a mammalian expression vector (Fig. 6A). The resulting plasmid DNA was first
transiently transfected in the glioma C6 cells and its subcellular distribution pattern in live cells was monitored
with confocal laser scanning microscopy 12–16 hours
post transfection.

detection. The full-length transcript was abundantly
expressed in liver, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle, but
not in heart or brain, which exclusively expressed the
alternatively spliced transcripts. FGF-2 was detected in all
tissues examined except liver. There was no obvious association between the level of FGF-2 and FGF-AS mRNA
abundance in the tissues examined.
Immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody
against the common C-terminus of GFG revealed that
subcellular distribution of immunoreactivity was also tissue-specific (Table 2 and Fig. 5). GFG was strongly
detected in both the cytoplasm and nuclei in many tissues, including liver, pancreas, kidney, testis, adrenal
medulla, and in both small and large bowel. FGF-2 and
GFG were co-localized in some, but not all tissues. In liver
(Fig. 5, upper four panels), FGF-2 staining (Fig 5a, b) was
strongly and exclusively cytoplasmic whereas GFG immunoreactivity (Fig. 5e, f) was detected weakly in cytoplasm
and strongly in nucleus. In contrast, FGF-2 and GFG were
co-localized in the nuclei of kidney glomerular endothelial cells and peritubular capillaries (Fig. 5c,dvs. 5g,h).
Consistent with our previous observations in human tissues, GFG was strongly expressed in the gastrointenstinal
tract (Table 2). These observations suggest that subcellular
localization of GFG is tissue-specific, and possibly isoform-dependent.

The green fluorescence of the fusion protein was exclusively detected in mitochondrial-like structures (data not
shown and Fig. 6E, panel rGFG), while the green fluorescence of free GFP was evenly distributed in cytoplasm and
nucleus (Fig. 6E, panel GFP). The mitochondrial localization of the rGFG-GFP fusion protein was further confirmed by dual monitoring of the red fluorescence of
MitoTracker (which specifically stains mitochondria in
live cells) and the green fluorescence of GFP. The yellow
color in the merged images confirms that rGFG-GFP colocalizes with the MitoTracker dye in mitochondria.
Expression of rGFG in stably transfected cells (Fig. 6D)
gave the same results, indicating that the transfection
method employed does not affect the subcellular distribution of GFG.
To confirm the integrity of the fusion protein and its subcellular targeting, a fractionation assay was conducted for
immunodetection of the fusion protein in isolated mitochondrial (Fig. 6B) and nuclear (Fig. 6C) fractions. Immunodetection of HSP60 was used as a marker of
mitochondrial enrichment (Fig. 6B, C; lower panels). No
GFP immunoreactivity was detected in the wild type C6
cell, indicating the specificity of the GFP antibody (Fig.
6B, C; lanes 1 and 2). A ~60 kDa protein, the expected size
of the GFG-GFP fusion protein, was predominantly identified in the mitochondrial fraction of transfected cells
(Fig. 6B, lane 6), although a fainter band was also detected
in cytoplasmic + nuclear (C/N) fraction (lane 5). The
mitochondrial isolation kit used in this study yields
highly purified mitochondria, but it does not remove all
mitochondria from the remaining cytosolic + nuclear fraction, and it is likely that the immunoreactive band in the
C/N fraction is of mitochondrial origin. This interpretation is supported by the confocal immunofluorescence
data, which shows exclusive localization of GFG-GFP to
the mitochondria. A 27 kDa protein, the expected size of

free GFP, was exclusively detected in the C/N fraction (Fig.
6B, lane 3), but not in the mitochondrial fraction (lane 4)
of the cells expressing GFP alone, confirming that mitochondrial targeting is GFG-specific. Subcellular fractionation into nuclear vs. cytoplasmic + mitochondrial (C/M)
fractions gave similar results (Fig. 6C). rGFG-GFP was
detected chiefly in the C/M fractions (Fig. 6C, lane 5).
Although a small amount of GFG was detected in the
nuclear fraction following subcellular fractionation (Fig
6C, lane 6) immunofluorescence was exclusively detected
in mitochondria in intact cells (Fig 6D, E). High molecular weight bands detected for both the GFG-GFP and
ΔN28GFG-GFP constructs are consistent with the molecular mass of possible GFG-GFP dimers (Fig 6Barrowheads)
whereas free GFP (28 kDa) was detected only in its monomeric form. Dimerization of GFG would be consistent

with the physiologically active form of many other nudix
motif proteins [15,25,26], and we have recently demonstrated that human GFG exists in dimeric form in vivo
[16].
The N-terminal MTS is necessary and sufficient for
mitochondrial localization
In order to confirm the role of the putative N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting sequence, a GFG-GFP expression
construct containing only the N-terminal 76 amino acids
of rGFG was designed (N76; Fig. 6A). This construct was
sufficient to target GFP to mitochondria in both stable
and transient transfectants (Fig. 6C, D, panel N76), demonstrating that the C-terminal 228 residue region of rGFG
is not required for mitochondrial targeting. In the Western
blots, the ~32 kDa band detected in the mitochondrial

of the MTS by mitochondrial signal peptidase (Fig. 6B, C).
The distribution of N76 fusion product in the cytoplasmic
vs. mitochondrial fraction was increased slightly compared to the full length GFG-GFP construct (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 5 vs. 7). This may be due to decreased stability
and consequent degradation of the deletion mutant protein during the protein isolation procedures. The confocal
images confirm exclusive mitochondrial localization of
the N76 deletion mutant in intact cells. A construct lacking the amino-terminal 28 amino acids of GFG (ΔN28)
was detected predominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus
(Fig 6D, E). The integrity of the deletion mutant was confirmed with the Western blot assay (Fig. 6B, lane 9 and 10;
Fig. 6C, lane 9 and 10). Some immunoreactive ΔN28 was
detected in the mitochondrial fraction in western blots
(Fig. 6B, lane 10) possibly reflecting a weak association of
the fusion protein with the mitochondria. This is supported by the observation of the coincidence of the green
fluorescence of the fusion protein with the red florescence
of the MitoTracker in some transfected cells (Fig. 6E).

Subcellular localization of alternative rat GFG isoforms
In addition to the full-length rGFG, we have previously
cloned and sequenced alternatively spliced transcripts
encoding 28 kDa (rGFGΔ2) and ~12 kDa (rGFGΔ2/3) isoforms of rGFG [6]. The 28 kDa and 12 kDa rGFG isoforms
contain the same MTS at their N-termini. GFG-GFP fusion
constructs of these two splice variants were generated (Fig.
7A) and their subcellular trafficking was determined in
transiently transfected C6 cells. Both rGFGΔ2 and
rGFGΔ2/3 were exclusively targeted to mitochondria, as
were the deletion mutants GFGΔ2/C56 (lacking the C-terminal 56 residues), rGFGΔNudix (lacking the nudix
domain) and rGFGN145 (lacking C-terminal 168 aa). In
contrast, three N-terminal deletion mutants rGFGC168,
rGFGC146 and rGFGC102, were localized in the nuclei
and cytoplasm, but not in mitochondria, indicating that
the N-terminal MTS is the only functional mitochondrial
targeting signal in rat GFG. The deletion mutants
rGFGC168 and rGFGC146 are structurally similar to
rGFG isoforms predicted from the Celera rat genome
assembly database, consisting of the C-terminal 160
amino acids (protein id = EDM01308.1) and C-terminal
147 amino acids (protein id = EDM01307.1). The latter
isoform has 82% identity with the human GFG isoform b
(GenBank accession number NP_932158), which we
have previously shown to be nuclear and cytoplasmic in
localization [16].

Discussion
In the present study we analyzed the expression and subcellular distribution of rGFG, the protein product of the
rat FGF-AS gene. Our present analysis shows that FGF-AS
mRNA expression is ubiquitous, although individual
splice variants were differentially expressed in a tissue-spe-

cific manner. Full-length rGFG was expressed in a limited
set of tissues, and was not detectable in brain, lung, or
heart. rGFGΔ2 and rGFG Δ2/3 were more broadly
expressed, and detectable in varing levels in all tissues
examined. FGF-2 and FGF-AS mRNAs were co-expressed,
and immunoreactivity of their protein products were colocalized in some but not all tissues examined. There was
no obvious association between the levels of expression of
the sense and antisense mRNAs or proteins in these tissues.
Unlike the human GFG isoforms, all three of the previously characterized rGFG isoforms contained mitochondrial targetting signal sequences, and were shown to be
exclusively targetted to mitochondria. The divergent Nterminal amino acid sequences of rat and human GFG
indicate that the physicochemical properties of the MTS,
rather than the specific amino acid sequence, determines
mitochondrial targeting [27]. The primary structures of
the human and rat GFG targeting sequences predict
amphiphilic helices consisting largely of hydrophobic residues. Following mitochondrial import, the MTS is generally cleaved by mitochondrial processing peptidases [28],
and the sizes of GFG:GFP fusion mutants observed in Fig.
6 are consistent with MTS cleavage. These results also indicate that the GFP fusion did not affect the structural conformation of the MTS [29].
We previously reported that human hGFG isoforms b and
c, which lack the N-terminal MTS, are localized in the
nucleus and cytoplasm, consistent with the detection of
GFG immunoreactivity in these compartments in various
primary human tissues [16,19]. Our present results indicate that rGFG, and the Δ2 and Δ2/3 isoforms are exclusively
targeted
into
mitochondria.
However,
immunohistochemistry and sub-cellular fractionation
studies identified cytoplasmic and nuclear GFG immunoreactivity in rat tissues and cell lines [6,17,18]. This suggests that additional rat GFG isoform(s), corresponding to
hGFGb and/or hGFGc, remain to be identified. Indeed,
the Celera rat genome assembly predicts a GFG isoform
(rGFGc) with > 80% amino acid identity to human GFGb,
and lacking the N-terminal MTS sequence. In the present
study we confirmed that a deletion mutant of rGFG
(rGFGC146), corresponding to the predicted sequence of
rGFGc, is indeed localized in cytoplasm and nuclei of
transiently transfected cells (Fig. 7), consistent with the
behaviour of the corresponding human homolog,
hGFGb. Expression of rGFGc may account for previous
reports of nuclear GFG immunoreactivity in some tissues.
Alternatively, tissue-specific posttranslational modification of rGFG may result in removal or inactivation of the
MTS [30]. The N-termini of rat and mouse GFG (but not
those of other species) contain a consensus monobasic
prohomone cleavage site (Fig. 3a). This raises the possibil-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/10

ity that, in some tissues, post-translational processing by
prohormone convertases may remove the MTS, resulting
in cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of rGFG. Prohormone convertase cleavage has previously been reported to
mediate subcellular sorting of VGF [31].
The physiological substrate of GFG has not yet been identified. Although a plant homolog of GFG has recently
been reported to have activity against ADP-ribose and
NADPH [32], preliminary enzymatic analysis of GFG has
failed to identify any typical nudix-like pyrophosphatase
activity against a variety of substrates nor any MutT-complementation activity with rat or human GFG isoforms
[16]. In contrast, expression and translation of FGF-2 and
GFG are tightly linked [9,19], and dysregulation of their
expression is associated with poor clinical prognosis in
esophageal adenocarcinoma [16,33]. We have recently
demonstrated that overexpression of GFG suppresses
FGF-2 and inhibits cell proliferation in rat and human
tumor cell lines [9,16]. Furthermore, the inhibition of cell
cycle progression is reversible by addition of exogenous
FGF-2 indicating that the phenotypic effects of GFG are
directly attributable to its effects on FGF-2 expression
[16]. This interpretation is supported by our demonstration that a GFG deletion mutant lacking the enzymatic
nudix domain is as effective as the full length protein in
suppressing cell cycle progression [9].

Conclusion
In summary, FGF antisense gene encodes a highly conserved nudix motif protein present in all multicellular
organisms. Alternative splicing of the primary transcript
in animals (but not plants) results in multiple isoforms of
the protein differentially targeted to mitochondria, cytoplasm and nucleus. However, biochemical and functional
assays suggest that the primary function of FGF-AS is as a
regulatory RNA controlling FGF-2 expression. The high
level of FGF-AS sequence conservation in animal
sequences suggests that this gene has been conserved to
maintain its unique role in the regulation of FGF-2 expression.

Methods
Plasmid Construction
Standard molecular cloning techniques were used as
described elsewhere [34]. To construct rat rGFG:GFP
fusions for expression in mammalian cells, the cDNA of
the open reading frames coding for rat GFG isoforms
rGFG, rGFGΔ2 and rGFGΔ2/3 were amplified by PCR
using plasmid DNA templates prGFGfl, prGFGspl1 and
prGFGspl2 [3,6] and Pfu DNA polymerase. The resulting
PCR-amplified DNA fragments were precipitated,
digested with KpnI and BamHI, then purified and ligated
into the corresponding restriction sites of pEGFP-N1,
resulting in the plasmid constructs prGFG, prGFGΔ2 and

prGFGΔ2/3. For prGFGΔNudix, the plasmid DNA of
prGFG was digested with AflIII and the gel-purified larger
fragment was religated resulting in a in-frame deletion of
the Nudix domain of rGFG as described before [17]. Nterminal and C-terminal deletion mutants of rat GFG:GFP
were amplified by PCR using template plasmid prGFG,
Pfu DNA polymerase, and appropriate primer pairs. The
PCR-products were precipitated, digested with KpnI and
BamHI and inserted into pEGFP-N1, resulting in the plasmids prGFGN41, prGFGN76, prGFGN145, prGFGΔN28,
prGFGC168, prGFGC146 and prGFGC102.

RNA expression analysis
Expression in rat tissues was evaluated using Rat Multiple
Tissue cDNA panel I (Clontech, Mountain View, CA).
Expression of FGF2, as well as the full length (fl) GFG,
GFGΔ2, and GFGΔ2/3 isoforms of GFG was analyzed separately, with Rat β-actin as an internal control.

Immunohistochemistry
A modified immunoperoxidase technique was used to
study the cellular distribution of FGF-2 and GFG proteins
in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded rat tissue sections
(Imgenex Histoarray, BIO/CAN Scientific, Mississauga,
ON). Rabbit polyclonal anti-FGF-2 (Ab-2) was from
Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA. The GFG
antiserum, raised against the highly conserved carboxyl
terminus of rGFG, was used at a final concentration of 20
μg/ml as previously described [19]. Controls, including
known positive and negative staining tissues, and samples
in which the primary antibody was omitted, were run in
parallel with the test sections. FGF-2 and GFG immunoreactivity was evaluated noting subcellular distribution
(nuclear or cytoplasmic) using a scoring system previously described [19,35,36]. Intensity of staining was
graded as negative, -; a trace, (+); positive, +; or strongly
positive, ++.

Primer sequences were as follows: FGF2 forward: 5'-GAGGAGTTGTGTCCATCAAG-3' and FGF2 reverse: 5'GGCCTTCTGTCCAGGCCCCG-3' with a Ta of 60 C, and
yielding a 230 bp fragment: GFG-fl forward: 5'-GCTCTTGCAGGCCGCCATTCAG-3'and GFG-fl reverse: 5'AAATACGGCACCTGCAACCCCTA-3' with a Ta of 57 C,
and yielding a 226 bp fragment; GFG-Δ2 forward: 5'TCTTGCAGGGTGCCGTATTT-3' and GFG-Δ2 reverse: 5'CGGCTGCAGGCGGCAGATCA-3' with a Ta of 57 C, and
yielding a 260 bp fragment; GFG-Δ2/3 forward: 5'TTGCAGGTTGAAAAACATGT-3' and GFG-Δ2/3 reverse:
5'-CGGCTGCAGGCGGCAGATCA-3' with a Ta of 53 C,
and yielding a 202 bp fragment; and β-actin forward: 5'TGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGAGGGG-3' and β-actin reverse:
5'-ATCGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCA-3', with a Ta of 57 C,
and yielded a 244 bp fragment.

Computational analyses
GFG homolog search with the known rat GFG cDNA
sequences [3-5] was performed using the NCBI BLAST
server [37]. Multiple protein sequence alignments and
phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary relationships of
GFG homologs were conducted with Clustal W, a general
multiple sequence alignment program [38]. SMART
[39,40], a "Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool",
was used to look for functional domain and signaling
peptides. Nuclear localization signals were analyzed with
PredictNLS server [41]. N-terminal signal peptide predications were performed with iPSORT WWW Service [42],
LOCtree [43], MITOPROT [44], and TargetP Server v1.01
[45,46] which are freely available online. Prohormone
cleavage site prediction was performed using Neuropred
[24], available on-line [47].

PCR amplification was carried out with an initial denaturation at 95 C, and 39 cycles of 95 C for 1 min, the productspecific Ta for 1 min, and 72 C for 1 min, and final elongation at 72 C for 10 min. Reactions were carried out in a
10 μL reaction volume, and used 1× Reaction Buffer, 0.4
mM dNTPs, 2.0 mM MgCl2 (Fermentas, Burlington, ON)
for all except GFG-fl, FGF2, and β-actin, which contained
1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 μM each primer (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON), and 1.0 Unit of Taq DNA Polymerase (Fermentas, Burlington, ON), and 1.2 ng cDNA.

Culture, transfection and treatment of mammalian cells
C6 glioma cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and penicillin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. To establish stable
cell lines, transfection of plasmid DNAs was performed
according to the manufacturer's instruction using Lipofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen). Transformants were
selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The potential positive colonies were examined with
epifluorescence microscopy for detection of GFP positive
colonies. The colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders (Scienceware) by trypsinizing single colonies and
amplified for immunodetection and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). Transient transfections were conducted using transfection reagents FuGENE 6 (Roche
Applied Science) or GeneJuice™ (Novagen).

PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel
stained with ethidium bromide.
All products were sequenced (Robarts Research Institute,
London, ON) to verify that the amplified fragments were
derived from the correct target sequence.

Protein extraction and subcellular fractionation
For subcellular fractionation assays, wild type (WT) C6
cells or cells stably transfected with the GFP-GFG constructs were harvested and subjected to isolation of mitochondrial vs. non-mitochondrial (cytoplasm + nuclei)
fractions using Mitochondria Isolation Kit according to
the manufacture's introduction of isolation of mitochondria using reagent-based method or nuclear vs. nonnuclear (cytoplasm + mitochondria) fractions using NEPER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) following the manufacture's introduction. The Halt™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail was added into the mitochondrial or nuclear
extraction buffers before starting. The isolated mitochondrial pellets were dissolved in 1 × SDS-PAGE loading
buffer[48] and boiled for 5 minutes. The protein concentration of all protein extracts were measured using
Coomassie Plus™ – The Better Bradford Assay Reagent
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and then the extracts
were stored at -80°C until use.

Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), incubated for 30 minutes, and
then replaced with normal medium without MitoTracker.
The subcellular localization of the GFG:GFP fusions in the
live cells was monitored with a ZEISS LSM 510 META laser
scanning confocal microscope (LSCM, Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). Fluorescent image stacks were taken from a cell
and analyzed using the software supplied (3D for LSM,
Carl Zeiss AG).
For analysis of the subcellular localization of the
GFG:GFP fusion proteins transiently expressed in C6 cells
were seeded in chambered cover-slips containing DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated overnight,
then transfected with the plasmid DNAs using FuGENE 6
transfection reagent. Six hours after transfection, the
medium was replaced with the normal growth medium
DMEM and cultured overnight. Mitochondrion staining
and LSCM analysis was similar to that described for mitochondrion staining of stably transfected cells.

Authors' contributions
Protein immunoblotting
Protein extracts and subcellular fractions were subjected
to SDS-PAGE using a NuPAGE® Electrophoresis System
and 4–12% NuPAGE® Novex Bis-Tris-Gels (Invitrogen).
Immunodetection of GFG:GFP fusion proteins was performed using a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody
(A.V. Monoclonal Antibody of BD Living Colors™ Antibodies, BD Biosciences). The HSP60 antibody was a goat
affinity-purified and pre-absorbed polyclonal antibody
raised against a peptide mapping at the amino terminus of
HSP 60 of human origin (identical to the corresponding
mouse sequence, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The
rabbit polyclonal anti-GFG antibody raised against a peptide of the C-terminal rat GFG was described previously
[3]. The secondary antibodies were a blotting grade affinity purified goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad laboratories), a bovine antigoat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a donkey anti-rabbit IgGFab' conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham,
plc). A nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) was used for immunoblotting.
Immunoblots were visualized by ECL using a SuperSignal® West Dura extended duration substrate kit (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL).
Fluorescence Microscopy
Stably transfected C6 cells were seeded in a four-well collagen I-coated Lab-Tek® II Chambered Coverglass (Nalge
Nunc International) containing DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and incubated overnight at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For mitochondrial
staining, the medium was changed to DMEM containing
100 nM MitoFluor Red 589 (MitoTracker, Molecular
