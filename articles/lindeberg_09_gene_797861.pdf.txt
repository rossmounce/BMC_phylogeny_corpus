Abstract
Genome-informed identification and characterization of Type III effector repertoires in various
bacterial strains and species is revealing important insights into the critical roles that these proteins
play in the pathogenic strategies of diverse bacteria. However, non-systematic discipline-specific
approaches to their annotation impede analysis of the accumulating wealth of data and inhibit easy
communication of findings among researchers working on different experimental systems. The
development of Gene Ontology (GO) terms to capture biological processes occurring during the
interaction between organisms creates a common language that facilitates cross-genome analyses.
The application of these terms to annotate type III effector genes in different bacterial species – the
plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and animal pathogenic strains of Escherichia
coli – illustrates how GO can effectively describe fundamental similarities and differences among
different gene products deployed as part of diverse pathogenic strategies. In depth descriptions of
the GO annotations for P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 effector AvrPtoB and the E. coli effector Tir
are described, with special emphasis given to GO capability for capturing information about
interacting proteins and taxa. GO-highlighted similarities in biological process and molecular
function for effectors from additional pathosystems are also discussed.

Background
Bacterial pathogens subvert defenses and generate favorable niches in diverse eukaryotes through an array of extracellular factors. Most of these factors are proteins
transported out of the bacterial cell by one of several secretion pathways, numerically distinguished as type I
through type VI. Proteins secreted by the type III secretion

system (T3SS) are critical to pathogens of diverse hosts;
the best studied of these bacteria include enteric pathogens of animals, E. coli, Salmonella, and Yersinia, and plant
pathogens in the genera Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, and
Ralstonia [1,2]. Related secretion systems are utilized during beneficial types of symbiosis, with the best studied

being the T3SS in the nitrogen-fixing legume symbionts,
Rhizobium [3,4].
The ever-growing number of complete genome sequences
has prompted intensive genome-informed investigations
of Type III effector repertoires in various bacterial strains
and species. However, a long history of non-systematic,
discipline-specific approaches to the annotation of Type
III effectors (and virulence genes in general) has created a
significant impediment to rapid analysis of this wealth of
new data. Effector gene names typically vary, with two or
more three-letter gene names often used for effectors from
the same species (e.g., sip and sop in Salmonella or avr and
hop in P. syringae) and annotation of product names being
similarly idiosyncratic. Attempts have been made to systematize three letter gene name assignments for select
groups of organisms [5,6], but even with a rigorously
applied nomenclature, only limited information can be
captured in this way. Furthermore, the high rates of horizontal transfer observed for effector genes [5], coupled
with an accelerated rate of evolution for some [7,8], can
confound recognition of related effectors through standard analysis of homology. As a result, researchers interested in broad comparisons of gene products and
pathosystems must invest significant amounts of time
piecing together their own summary from the primary literature.

The Gene Ontology – a universal language for
capturing effector characteristics
The Gene Ontology (GO) was originally developed by
researchers working on eukaryotic model systems as a
controlled vocabulary for describing processes common
to diverse organisms [9]. The three ontologies that make
up GO are designed to capture information on the cellular
location, molecular functions, and biological processes
that characterize individual gene products. GO terms are
organized into a tree-like hierarchy where more general,
high level terms are the parents of more specific child
terms. Gene products can be annotated to as many terms
as are applicable, with the level of specificity dependent
on the extent of characterization. Evidence codes attached
to individual annotations document the nature of supporting evidence and identifiers for the associated publications provide direct links to the source of the data.
The Plant-associated Microbe Gene Ontology (PAMGO)
project http://pamgo.vbi.vt.edu/ was initiated for the purpose of creating GO terms that specifically capture cellular
locations and biological processes relevant to interactions
between organisms. Of the more than 700 new GO terms
created as part of this project; most are found under the
"interspecies interaction between organisms" parent in
the Biological Process Ontology. Term development has
been accompanied by focused efforts on the part of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S4

PAMGO members to comprehensively annotate effectors
in selected bacterial pathogens – specifically, the plant
pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pto
DC3000) and numerous enterics including the plant
pathogen Dickeya dadantii and animal pathogenic strains
of E. coli.
Pto DC3000 and E. coli 0157:H7 represent useful case
studies for initiation of a global effector annotation
project. Both pathogens require a wide range of T3SSdependent effectors to establish infection within their
respective hosts. Furthermore, as pathogens of hosts in
both the plant and animal kingdoms, they illustrate the
utility of GO's multi-level structure for conceptualizing
shared and divergent aspects of their pathogenic strategies.

Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000
Pto DC3000 is a pathogen of tomato and Arabidopsis, was
the first P. syringae strain sequenced to completion, and is
a model for the study of bacterial-plant interactions [10].
T3SS effector proteins, identified on the basis of their regulation by the HrpL alternative sigma factor and their passage out of the bacterial cell via the T3SS, have long been
known to play a critical role in pathogenicity and hostrange determination of P. syringae pathovars. Indeed, cataloguing their complete repertoire represented one of the
chief motivations for sequencing the Pto DC3000
genome. More than 50 effector families, defined by phylogenetic grouping [11], have been identified among the P.
syringae pathovars, with over 36 families found in Pto
DC3000. The majority of these were identified using a
combination of BLAST analysis of predicted genes against
previously identified effectors and iterative pattern-based
searches using the conserved HrpL binding site and N-terminal sequence patterns associated with T3SS targeting
[11].
Since their initial identification as substrates of the T3SS,
research on the Pto DC3000 effectors has yielded new
insights into their molecular functions, cellular destinations within the host, and the biological processes in
which they participate. To date, over 300 Gene Ontology
annotations have been generated for 36 effector genes as
part of the PAMGO project, with the vast majority of
annotations concerning processes that occur during the
interaction between microbes and their host organisms.
An example of the range of processes in which the effectors engage is illustrated by the Pto DC3000 effector protein AvrPtoB (HopAB2) (see the table in Figure 1). Like
many other effectors, AvrPtoB is annotated to terms in all
three ontologies. Within the Biological Process Ontology,
terms range from the more general such as "GO:0009405
pathogenesis" and "GO:0044412 growth or development
of symbiont within the host", applicable to a wide range

of virulence factors in diverse pathogens, to more specific
terms such as "GO:0052049 interaction with host via protein secreted by type III secretion system" that specifically
identifies the Type III effectors.
AvrPtoB and other P. syringae effectors play significant
roles in modulating the host defense response
(GO:0052031), and as part of PAMGO term development, an extensive tree of child terms was created to capture the variety of processes contributing to this
phenomenon. Though many of these terms are, at least
for the present, used only for bacteria-plant interactions,
it is critical to the utility of GO that terms be defined using
language that is meaningful across many pathosystems.
The phrase "hypersensitive response" serves as a useful
example. While this term is commonly used among plant
pathologists to refer to rapid defense-associated plant cell
death at the site of infection, to researchers in animal systems it can have very different allergy-related or behavioral connotations. Therefore, newly developed PAMGO
terms avoid using "hypersensitive response" in the term
name and instead use term names such as "GO:0034053
modulation by symbiont of host defense-related programmed cell death" to annotate such bacterial effector
activity. At the same time, the previously existing GO term
"GO:0009626 hypersensitive response" was modified at
the request of PAMGO collaborators to "plant-type hypersensitive response," thus clearly matching the new term
name with the existing GO definition, which specified
plant cells. It is important to note that an investigator
searching GO terms for "hypersensitive response" would
be pointed to both terms named above by means of the
synonym field attached to each GO term. Finally, these
two terms illustrate the difference between terms appropriate for annotating genes in the microbe, or symbiont
(GO:0034053) versus those in the plant (GO:0009626)
that are involved in the process described.
AvrPtoB is annotated to several child terms of
"GO:0052031 modulation by symbiont of host defense
response" including: "GO:0034054 negative regulation
by symbiont of host defense-related programmed cell
death [PCD]", "GO:0034055 positive regulation by symbiont of host defense-related programmed cell death",
"GO:0033660 negative regulation by symbiont of host

response",
"GO:0075132 negative regulation by symbiont of host
protein kinase-mediated signal transduction", and
"GO:0052034 negative regulation by symbiont of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-induced host innate
immunity". At first glance, these annotations may appear
contradictory – after all, how can the same gene product
be annotated to both "GO:0034055 positive regulation by
symbiont of host defense-related PCD" and
"GO:0034054 negative regulation by symbiont of host

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S4

defense-related PCD"? In this case, the answer lies in the
secondary or dual taxon field incorporated into the GO
database as part of the PAMGO project. This field functions to indicate the identities of the organisms between
which the interaction is occurring. Thus, closer examination reveals that "GO:0034055 positive regulation by
symbiont of host defense-related PCD" applies to AvrPtoB
in the Pto DC3000 interaction with S. lycopersicum
(tomato) while "GO:0034054 negative regulation by
symbiont of host defense-related PCD" is used to annotate the interaction between Pto DC3000 and Nicotiana
benthamiana (tobacco). In fact, annotation to
"GO:0034054 negative regulation by symbiont of host
defense-related PCD" is shown in triplicate to reflect interactions of Pto DC3000 in three separate hosts – Nicotiana
benthamiana, Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi, and Arabidopsis
thaliana. Where additional clarification of strains and genotypes of interacting organisms is required, users can refer
to the associated publications found in the reference field
of the GO annotation.
In addition to annotations in the Biological Process ontology, annotations to the Cellular Component and Molecular Function ontologies are also shown. As one of the
most thoroughly characterized of the Pto DC3000 effectors, AvrPtoB has several Molecular Function annotations
that provide insight on the specific enzymatic and binding
capabilities by which AvrPtoB accomplishes the processes
described above. Molecular Function annotations
include: "GO:0019901 protein kinase binding",
"GO:0004842 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity", and
"GO:0031624 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme binding".
Just as documenting the taxa of interacting organisms is
critical to the usefulness of biological process terms, so
documentation of interacting proteins significantly
enhances the value of Molecular Function terms. For
example, the interacting proteins for "GO:0019901 protein kinase binding" are Q40234 (Pto) and Q40126
(Fen), and for "GO:0005515 protein binding", Q9LLD3
(PtoC). Most of the evidence codes used for AvrPtoB indicate experimental evidence for the assigned annotations,
including IDA (inferred from direct assay), IMP (inferred
from mutant phenotype), and IPI (inferred from physical
interaction). In contrast, the evidence code ISS (inferred
from sequence or structural similarity) indicates that the
annotation is based on similarity of the given gene product to an experimentally characterized homolog. Annotations made on the basis of sequence or structural
similarity require that the ID of the protein from which
the annotation is inferred be included in the with/from
column. Unlike AvrPtoB, for which the ISS code is used
only once to capture its structural similarity to known E3
ubiquitin ligases (UniProt: P62877, Q8VZ40), GO annotations for effectors in some other P. syringae strains rely
more extensively on sequence similarity. In such cases

where experimental evidence is lacking, sequence similarity to Pto DC3000 effectors can be used to guide GO
annotation of those effectors. (Some important considerations relevant to propagating GO annotations based on
sequence similarity are described in the following section.) When sequence similarity is absent, GO annotations can provide clues to candidate functions or
biological processes in newly identified gene products
based on annotations previously made for other experimentally characterized gene products. For example, once
a newly described gene product is found to be secreted
and thus annotated to "GO:0052049 interaction with
host via protein secreted by type III secretion system",
other processes associated with this annotation in other
experimentally characterized effectors become candidates
for testing. These might include "GO:0044412 growth or
development of symbiont within host", "GO:0034055
positive regulation by symbiont of host defense-related
PCD", or "GO:0052034 negative regulation by symbiont
of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-induced host
innate immunity".

Escherichia coli
Like P. syringae, many strains of E. coli rely on effectors to
establish a pathogenic relationship with their host and are
the focus of intense interest owing to their ability to cause
serious disease in humans. Numerous genomes have
recently been sequenced from pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. coli strains, and no one strain serves as a general
model for the diverse pathogenic strategies found within
this species. Consequently, PAMGO consortium members
working on the Enterobacteriaceae, in contrast to those
working on P. syringae, have focused on automated propagation of annotations from a handful of experimentally
characterized effectors to homologs in numerous complete and draft genomes of E. coli and other enteric bacteria.
E. coli O157:H7 provides a representative example of the
current state of experimentally-based annotation of
enteric effectors and also reveals the limitations of transitive or similarity-based propagation of annotations. A
total of 39 type III effectors have been identified in E. coli
0157:H7 strain Sakai through a combination of bioinformatics, "secretome" analysis, and translocation assays
with Cya fusions [5]. However, the absence of a convenient model host system for E. coli O157:H7 has impeded
in vivo characterization of host interaction phenotypes on
the level conducted in P. syringae, with the result that
annotation of E. coli O157:H7 effectors has relied more
extensively on inferences made from sequence similarity.
Among the O157:H7 effectors studied in greater depth is
the Translocated Intimin Receptor protein (Tir), which
plays a key role in bacterial attachment to host cells [12-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S4

15]. Given that attachment has proven a tractable process
for studying in cell culture models, it is possible to assign
GO annotations to Tir with a specificity comparable to
that of AvrPtoB. Tir is secreted into host cells via the LEE
(locus of enterocyte effacement) T3SS and then trafficked
to the host cell plasma membrane (GO:0020002), where
it binds the (also LEE-encoded) intimin protein on the
bacterial cell surface. This binding activity is captured by
the combination of Molecular Function ontology terms
"GO:0051635 bacterial cell surface binding" and
"GO:0005515 protein binding" using the IPI evidence
code and "with" qualifier to specify the interacting partner
as intimin. The role of Tir in bacterial attachment is
reflected by the Biological Process term "GO:0044406
adhesion to host", with subsequent effects of Tir on the
cascade of host signaling, described by "GO:0052027
modulation by symbiont of defense-related host MAP
kinase-mediated signal transduction pathway" and major
host cytoskeletal remodeling captured by "GO:0052039
modification by symbiont of host cytoskeleton" easily
accommodated by child terms of "GO:0051701 interaction with host". The term "GO:0052057 modification by
symbiont of host morphology or physiology via protein
secreted by type III secretion system" links Tir to other
T3SS effectors, while "GO:0009405 pathogenesis" indicates its role in disease.
The Tir effector also highlights some of the challenges
inherent to cross-genome term assignments. Given that
transitive annotation based on sequence and structural
similarity forms the basis of most annotations in the GO
database, discussion of the limitations of such annotations is warranted. Specifically, similar gene products
involved in the interaction between organisms can have
very different properties depending on both their source
organism and the host with which they are interacting. For
example, Tir has been shown to have different molecular
functions depending on whether it is produced by enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) O157:H7 or enteropathogenic
(EPEC) strains of E. coli. In EPEC, but not EHEC, tyrosine
phosphorylation of Tir by the bacterium plays a key role
in initiating the host cell signaling cascades and the
cytoskeletal rearrangements involved with formation of a
pedestal-like structure immediately under the adherent
bacterial cell [13,14]. It is therefore imperative that the
annotations assigned to EPEC-derived Tir not be propagated to Tir from EHEC strains. GO provides the option of
using the qualifier "NOT" together with an annotation
such as "GO:0019901 protein kinase binding" to indicate
that the E. coli O157:H7 Tir protein is not phosphorylated. However, many GO annotation repositories,
including the UW ASAP database of enterobacterial
genomes [16]), do not display this qualifier by default,
with the result that the "NOT" qualifier is used infrequently. A more in depth discussion of the "NOT" quali-

fier and differences in its use among databases is described
by Yon Rhee et al (2008) [17].
In other cases, the properties of effectors and other host
interaction factors are simply uncharacterized in particular strains or during interactions with particular hosts. In
databases where the host taxon is not readily displayed for
annotations to terms in the "interaction between organisms" tree or where the host is specified but with an ISS
evidence code, users should consider the possibility that
the annotation may not be accurate for all source strains
and hosts. When involved in generating annotations
based on sequence or structural similarity, users should
consider avoiding propagation of those most likely to vary
based on source and host. Within the ASAP database,
annotations likely to be host-dependent are not routinely
propagated with the automated annotation systems used
to annotate rapidly accumulating sequence data from
"next-generation" sequencing technologies, and transitive
annotation of effectors is limited to the general term
"GO:0052049 interaction with host via protein secreted
by type III secretion system".

Effector repertoire comparison
Although the approaches used in effector characterization
and annotation differ between P. syringae and E. coli, comparison of the assigned terms illustrates how GO can be
used to conceptualize the fundamental similarities and
differences that exist among different gene products and
pathogenic strategies. As previously mentioned, terms
such as "GO:0009405 pathogenesis", "GO:0044412
growth or development of symbiont within host", and
"GO:0052049 interaction with host via protein secreted
by type III secretion system" are broadly applicable to a
wide array of effectors in diverse pathosystems. In contrast, other terms are highly specific to effectors from particular pathosystems, revealing fundamental differences
in the processes by which Type III effectors influence the
bacterial-host interaction. For example, critical stages of
adhesion to the host (GO:0044406), are mediated by
Type III effectors in E. coli and other animal-associated
pathogens [18]. In contrast, host adhesion in P. syringae is
accomplished by fimbriae and exopolysaccharides
[19,20] genes which can be further distinguished in the
GO with the terms "GO:0043683 type IV pilus biogenesis" and "GO:0045226 extracellular polysaccharide biosynthetic
process",
respectively.
Conversely,
"GO:0001907 killing by symbiont of host cells", whether
by the natural progression of necrotic disease or by induction of defense-related programmed cell death (captured
with the more specific term GO:0052044), is a hallmark
of P. syringae effector action [21] that is mediated by toxins independent of the T3SS in E. coli and other animal
pathogens. Examples include cholera toxin deployed by
Vibrio cholera and pertussis toxin of Bordetella pertussis, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S4

secretion properties of which are described with the terms
"GO:0052051 interaction with host via protein secreted
by type II secretion system" and "GO:0052050 interaction
with host via substance secreted by type IV secretion system", respectively. These examples illustrate the value of
annotating to multiple terms, where appropriate, so as to
maximally capture both shared and divergent properties
exhibited by different virulence factors.
Beyond these broad similarities and differences, shared
processes and activities at surprisingly specific levels can
also be found. For example, selected Pto DC3000 and E.
coli 0157:H7 effectors modulate host innate immunity
(expressed with GO:0052167 and its child terms), with
some specifically demonstrated to negatively regulate host
innate immunity induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (captured with GO:0052034).
A further illustration of GO-highlighted similarities is
shown for a select group of effectors from multiple pathosystems in the table in Figure 2. In both plant and animal
systems, complex signaling pathways mediate the
response to detected pathogens, with elements of the
intervening signaling pathways representing the most
common targets for effector-mediated suppression of the
immune response. This property is reflected by annotation of AvrPtoB as well as effectors AvrPto, HopAO1, and
HopAI1 (P. syringae); IpaH9.8, OspF (Shigella); SspH1
(Salmonella); and YopP/J (Yersinia) to the term
"GO:0052027 modulation by symbiont of host signal
transduction pathway". For some effectors from both
plant and animal pathosystems, the nature of this process
has been more intensively characterized, supporting
annotation to more specific child terms such as
"GO:0052078 negative regulation by symbiont of
defense-related host MAP kinase-mediated signal transduction pathway" and "GO:0052034 negative regulation
by symbiont of pathogen-associated molecular patterninduced host innate immunity". In other cases, the effectors in question await in depth evaluation.
Additional information as to how effectors accomplish
modulation of host signaling is captured with terms in the
Molecular Function Ontology, and once again common
strategies are evident among effectors in diverse systems.
For AvrPtoB, IpaH9.8, and SspH1, interference with signaling pathways is mediated by ubiquitination of host
kinases, activities captured with the molecular function
terms "GO:0019901 protein kinase binding" and
"GO:0004842 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity" [22-24].
AvrPtoB ubiquitinates host kinases involved in resistancegene mediated host immunity [24], while SspH1 ubiquitinates PKN1 [22,25], a host kinase integral to innate
immune response signaling pathways. The ability of

Putting Gene Ontology to work for you

genes annotated to particular terms. The value of the Gene
Ontology project is directly proportional to the number
and quality of the annotations being contributed, and
though intensive efforts have been directed toward annotation of virulence-related gene products in Pto DC3000
and E. coli, ongoing annotation of these and effectors
deployed by a wider range of plant and animal pathogens
would greatly enhance the insights that could be gained.
Among the steps being taken to facilitate ongoing annotation are proposals that journals request suggested GO
terms from manuscript authors akin to requests for keywords. Guidelines are also being developed to aid
researchers in identification of appropriate terms for specific protein families. For example, a tutorial on GO term
assignment for plant pathogenic effectors is presently
available through the Pseudomonas-Plant Interaction
website http://www.pseudomonas-syringae.org.

The Pto DC3000 and E. coli annotations have been deposited in the GO database where searches can be conducted
for GO terms or particular gene products. At that site and
through linked resources, users can search for gene products annotated to multiple, user-selected GO terms of
interest or analyze microarray data for enrichment of

For users of GO annotation, it is important to remember
that annotations exist within a diffuse network of databases that include the primary, organism-specific databases where annotations are chiefly generated, the GO
database itself, and additional sites to which annotation

Other effectors alter immune signaling pathways using
alternative enzymatic activities. These include inactivation
of MAP kinase signaling by "GO:0034598 phosphothreonine lyase activity", documented for both OspF [26] and
HopAI1 [27], and targeting of MAP kinases by acetyltransferase-activity (GO:0016407) observed for YopP/J [28].
AvrPtoB, in addition to its ubiquitination-dependent suppression of resistance gene-mediated host immunity, suppresses innate immunity through E3-ligase independent
targeting of kinase signaling [29]. The specific molecular
functions by which this suppression is accomplished have
yet to be characterized.

data are downloaded. Significant inconsistencies can and
do occur among databases resulting from differences in
annotation format, as previously discussed with regard to
the "NOT" qualifier, as well as from differences in the frequency of data exchange among databases. In some
instances, the differences among databases simply reflect
the length of time it takes for changes instituted by the GO
Consortium to propagate through the many databases
using GO. For example, the dual taxon field pioneered by
PAMGO has only recently been added to TIGR-CMR, the
database through which P. syringae annotations are forwarded to GO. For these reasons, users are encouraged to
identify the sources and version numbers of the annotations they are using and include this information in publications making use of these data.

GO annotation represents a vitally important tool for
organizing the wealth of biological data that has accompanied the emergence of genomics and high-throughput
expression analysis. Through development of terms capturing the interaction between organisms, the PAMGO
consortium has added the important domain of interorganismal interactions to the range of processes encompassed by GO, applicable to research on both pathogenic
interactions and beneficial symbioses. Creation of the secondary taxon field has additionally provided a means of
capturing nuances of interaction observed upon interaction with different hosts. As exemplified by ongoing
annotation of effectors in P. syringae and E. coli, application of these terms to gene products deployed by different
organisms interacting with diverse hosts represents a powerful tool for identification of fundamental parallels
underlying outwardly dissimilar interactions.
