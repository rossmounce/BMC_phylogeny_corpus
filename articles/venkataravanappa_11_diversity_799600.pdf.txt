Abstract
Background: Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus; family Malvaceae) is grown in temperate as well as subtropical regions
of the world, both for human consumption as a vegetable and for industrial uses. Okra yields are affected by the
diseases caused by phyopathogenic viruses. India is the largest producer of okra and in this region a major biotic
constraint to production are viruses of the genus Begomovirus. Begomoviruses affecting okra across the Old World
are associated with specific, symptom modulating satellites (beta satellites). We describe a comprehensive analysis
of the diversity of beta satellites associated with okra in India.
Results: The full-length sequences of 36 beta satellites, isolated from okra exhibiting typical begomovirus
symptoms (leaf curl and yellow vein), were determined. The sequences segregated in to four groups. Two
groups correspond to the beta satellites Okra leaf curl beta satellite (OLCuB) and Bhendi yellow vein beta
satellite (BYVB) that have previously been identified in okra from the sub-continent. One sequence was distinct
from all other, previously isolated beta satellites and represents a new species for which we propose the name
Bhendi yellow vein India beta satellite (BYVIB). This new beta satellite was nevertheless closely related to BYVB
and OLCuB. Most surprising was the identification of Croton yellow vein mosaic beta satellite (CroYVMB) in okra;
a beta satellite not previously identified in a malvaceous plant species. The okra beta satellites were shown to
have distinct geographic host ranges with BYVB occurring across India whereas OLCuB was only identified in
northwestern India. Okra infections with CroYVMB were only identified across the northern and eastern central
regions of India. A more detailed analysis of the sequences showed that OLCuB, BYVB and BYVIB share highest
identity with respect bC1 gene. bC1 is the only gene encoded by beta satellites, the product of which is the
major pathogenicity determinant of begomovirus-beta satellite complexes and is involved in overcoming host
defenses based on RNAi.
Conclusion: The diversity of beta satellites in okra across the sub-continent is higher than previously realized
and is higher than for any other malvaceous plant species so far analyzed. The beta satellites identified in okra
show geographic segregation, which has implications for the development and introduction of resistant okra
varieties. However, the finding that the bC1 gene of the major okra beta satellites (OLCuB, BYVB and BYVIB)
share high sequence identity and provides a possible avenue to achieve a broad spectrum resistance.

Background
Geminiviruses are small plant-infecting, arthropodborne viruses with single-stranded (ss)DNA genomes
that are encapsidated in twinned (geminate) quasi-isometric particles. These viruses are found in tropical to
warm temperate geographical zones and infect a wide
range of plants including crops, ornamental plants and
weeds [1]. The family Geminiviridae is divided into four
genera (Mastrevirus, Curtovirus, Topocuvirus and Begomovirus), based on genome structure, type of insect vector and host range. Virus species belonging to the
largest genus, Begomovirus, are transmitted exclusively
by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci Genn. and cause economically significant losses of many cultivated dicotyledonous plants.
Begomoviruses native to the New World have genomes that consist of two ssDNA components, known as
DNA A and DNA B, each 2.6-2.8 kb in size. The DNA
A component encodes all virus factors required for control of gene expression, genome replication and insect
transmission between hosts. The DNA B encodes two
protein involved in intra- and intercellular movement in
host plant tissues [2]. Although a small number of
bipartite begomoviruses occur in the Old World, the
majority are monopartite, having genomes consisting of
only a homolog of the DNA A components of the bipartite viruses. Recently it has become evident that,
although there are a few truly monopartite begomoviruses (such as Tomato yellow leaf curl virus [3], which
has become globally widespread [4]), the majority are
monopartite and associate with additional ssDNA molecules [5].
The beta satellites (previously known as DNA b) are
large group of highly diverse ssDNA satellites that are
approximately half (~1350 nt) the size of their helper
begomoviruses and associate with monopartite begomoviruses [5,6]. Despite their lack of sequence conservation, the beta satellites have a highly conserved structure
consisting of a single gene (known as bC1), a region of
sequence rich in adenine (A-rich) and a sequence of
approx. 150 nt highly conserved between all beta satellites (known as the satellite conserved region [SCR]) [7].
Betasatellites require their helper begomoviruses for
replication and movement in host plants, as well as for
transmission between plants. The relationship between
particular begomoviruses and their beta satellites ranges
from entirely dependent (the virus has an absolute
requirement for the beta satellite to systemically infect a
plant host) to facultative (where, in the field, some isolates of a virus species associate with beta satellites and
others do not) [8]. All functions thus far attributed to
beta satellites are mediated by the product of the bC1
gene. The bC1 protein is a pathogenicity (symptom)

Page 2 of 13

determinant [9,10], may mediate virus movement in
plants [11], binds DNA in a sequence non-specific manner [12], is a suppressor of RNA silencing (a host
defense mechanism targeted against foreign nucleic
acids and triggered by double stranded RNA) [12,13],
forms homo-multimeric complexes in planta [14], interferes with host gene expression [15] and has been
shown to interact with a variety of host factors [16,17].
Many begomovirus-beta satellite complexes associate
with an additional small ssDNA molecule. Collectively
known as alphasatellites (previously called DNA 1) these
molecules are satellite-like [5,18]. In common with beta
satellites, they are approx. half the size of the genomes
of their helper begomoviruses (~1380 nt) and require
the helper virus for movement in and transmission
between hosts. However, by virtue of encoding a rollingcircle replication-initiator protein (Rep), alphasatellites
are capable of autonomous replication in host cells. The
benefits to the begomovirus-beta satellite complex of
the presence of an alphasatellite remain unclear. In
some cases the presence of an alphasatellite has been
shown to reduce viral DNA levels leading to the suggestion that alphasatellites may down-regulate virus/satellite
replication in hosts, thus ensuring the survival of the
plant and consequently increasing the likelihood of
onward transmission of the complex [19,20]. However,
recently the Rep proteins encoded by some alphasatellites have been shown to have suppressor of RNA silencing activity, suggesting that alphasatellites are involved
in overcoming host defenses [21].
We have determined the diversity and phylogeographic distribution of beta satellites associated with
okra in India. The results show two species of beta
satellite to predominate in okra. An additional beta
satellite species, not previously identified in okra, as well
as a species not previously characterized were identified.
The significance of these results are discussed.

Results
Betasatellites are associated with leaf curl and yellow
vein disease symptoms of okra in India

A total of 36 leaf samples from okra plants showing yellow vein and/or leaf curl symptoms typical of begomoviruses (Figure 1) were collected from widely separated
locations across India between 2005 and 2007 (Table 1,
Figure 2). Total nucleic acids were extracted from all
symptomatic leaf samples, as well as from non-symptomatic okra samples (two samples from each location).
PCR-mediated amplification from nucleic acid extracts
of all 36 symptomatic samples with primer pair beta01/
beta02 yielded an approx. 1.3 kb product from all samples. In contrast, amplifications from non-symptomatic
plants were uniformly negative (results not shown). This

Figure 1 Symptoms exhibited by okra plants from which betasatellites were obtained. Yellow vein (panels a and b) and leaf curl enation
(panels c and d) exhibited by okra plants. Note for the leaf curl enation phenotype the swollen veins (panel c) and small enations (tumors) on
the secondary veins (panel d). Although okra plants with the yellow vein phenotype sometimes showed some leaf curling, this was not
associated with the production of enations.

result showed a beta satellite to be consistently associated with yellow vein and leaf curl symptoms of okra.
The approx. 1.3 kb amplification products from all 36
samples were cloned. For each amplification at least one
clone containing a presumed full-length (~1.3 kb) beta
satellite insert was selected and sequenced in its entirety.
The complete nucleotide sequences of 36 beta satellite
clones obtained were submitted to the sequence databases under the accession numbers listed in Table 1.
The sequences determined are between 1344 and 1403
nt in length, which is typical of beta satellites [6,7].
Further, in order to rule out mixed infections to some
extent, in few isolates (including CroYVMB) multiple
clones were sequenced. We failed to get the additional
beta satellites in these samples.
The 36 cloned beta satellites have an organization
similar to previously characterized beta satellites. They
contain a highly conserved sequence of 136-142 nts
known as the satellite conserved region. This encompasses, at its 3â end, a predicted hairpin structure

containing the sequence TAATATTAC (known as the
nonanucleotide sequence) within the loop. For geminiviruses this marks the origin of virion-strand, rolling-circle DNA replication which is nicked by virus-encoded
Rep to initiate replication [22]. All 36 sequences contain
an A-rich sequence of between 164 and 214 nts, with
~60% adenine. Betasatellites encode a single gene
(known as bC1), in the complementary-sense strand,
which is conserved in position. The bC1 genes in the 36
sequences have a coding capacity of between 118 and
157 amino acids.
Four beta satellite species are associated with okra in
India

Comparisons of the 36 sequences showed them to fall
into four groups. The sequences of isolates OY168 and
OYBHU are distinct. They share only 39.4% nucleotide
sequence identity and show only 61.8-80.2% and 39.643.5% identity, respectively, to the remaining 34
sequences. Group 3 consists of three isolates (OY177,

Only for a few isolates could the okra cultivar be determined

EL41 and EL38) which share between 93.9 and 100%
identity but only 41.1-68.3% to isolates OY168 and
OYBHU, and between 71.2 and 80.6% nucleotide
sequence identity to the remaining isolates. The fourth
group consists of 31 isolates which have between 76.3
and 99.1% identity. Based on the species demarcation
threshold (78%) proposed for beta satellites [6], this
indicates that the beta satellites identified in okra in this
study represent four distinct species.
A comparison of the sequences of group 4 isolates to
betasatellite sequences available in the databases showed
them to have the highest levels of nucleotide sequence
identity (82-96.4%) to isolates of Bhendi yellow vein
betasatellite (BYVB; of which there are six isolates available in the databases) and lower levels of identity (69.777.9%) to Okra leaf curl betasatellite (OLCuB; of which
there is only a single isolate in the databases; OLCuB[PK:Goj:97], acc. no. AJ316029 [7]), the two betasatellite
species previously shown to be associated with begomoviruses infecting okra in southern Asia [6]. To all other
betasatellites the sequence identity of the group 4 isolates was less than 56.3%. This shows the group 4
sequences to represent isolates of the betasatellite species BYVB. Comparisons involving group 3 sequences
showed moderately high levels of identity (87.6-88.7%)

to OLCuB and lower levels of sequence identity (77.880.7%) to BYVB. To all other betasatellites the sequence
identity was less than 53.3%, indicating that group 3
sequences are isolates of OLCuB.
Isolate OYBHU showed the highest levels of nucleotide sequence identity (between 84.1 and 92.1%) to isolates of Croton yellow vein mosaic betasatellite
(CroYVMB; nine sequences available in the databases)
but less than 58.5% to all other betasatellite sequences
available in the databases, identifying this as an isolate
of the species CroYVMB. This is a surprise since, unlike
BYVB and OLCuB, CroYVMB has not previously been
shown to infect okra, or any other species in the Malvaceae; rather it has been isolated from the ubiquitous
weed Croton bonplandianus (family Euphorbiaceae) and
some other weeds [23].
In contrast to all the other betasatellites characterized
here, the sequence of isolate OY168 showed only low
levels of nucleotide sequence identity to betasatellites
available in the databases, with the highest (78%) to
BYVB-[IN:Mut:00](AJ308425). Based on the proposed
species demarcation threshold of 78% identity for betasatellites [6] this indicates that OY168 represents a new
species, for which we propose the name Bhendi yellow
vein India betasatellite (BYVIB).

the nucleotide identity data, it segregates with the
BYVBs. The phylogenetic tree here confirms the earlier
inclusion of BYVB and OLCuB in the malvaceous betasatellite group and shows that the newly identified

sequences. The additional betasatellites are Ageratum yellow vein betasatellite (AYVB), Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB; of which
there are two variants, the âMultanâ and âBurewalaâ variants [24]), Cotton leaf curl Gezira betasatellite (CLCuGB), Malvastrum yellow vein

Malvaceous (Mal) and non-malvaceous (Non-mal) betasatellites, as defined by Briddon et al. [7], are indicated in the right-hand side.

species similarly falls in this group. In contrast,
CroYVMB is a non-malvaceous betasatellite and would
thus not be expected to infect the malvaceous species
okra. The phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3) additionally
contained sequences of CLCuGB and CLCuMB (of
which there are two recognized strains, the âMultanâ
and âBurewalaâ strains [24]); the only other betasatellites
adapted to a species in the family Malvaceae (cotton)
for which a significant number of sequences are available. What stands-out here is that the BYVB isolates
show overall much higher branch lengths than the
CLCuGB and CLCuMB isolates, suggesting that the
diversity of BYVB is higher than that of CLCuGB and
CLCuMB.
Analysis of the bC1 sequences of betasatellites associated
with okra

An alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of
the bC1 genes of the betasatellites characterized here
and all BYVB, OLCuB and CroYVMB sequences available in the databases is shown in Figure 4. This shows
the majority of the betasatellites under consideration
to encode bC1 genes with a coding capacity predicted
at 118 amino acids (for the newly characterized betasatellites see Table 1). A small number of the BYVB and
OLCuB isolates have extended N-terminal leaders,
meaning that they could encode bC1 proteins of a larger size. However, the majority of the betasatellites
with extended N-terminal sequences nevertheless
encompass the methionine start codon (indicated as A

Page 8 of 13

in Figure 4) which would allow for the translation of a
bC1 protein of 118 amino acids. Only for two betasatellites, Ageratum yellow vein betasatellite (AYVB) and
Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB), have
the transcripts spanning the bC1 gene been mapped
[9,25]. These transcripts initiate immediately upstream
of the methionine equivalent to that marked as A in
Figure 4 and would encode a predicted 118 amino acid
product. Three isolates of BYVB have bC1 genes with
sizes predicted at less than 118 amino acids; BYVB[PK:Bah:97](AJ316030) and GQ245761 lack the
methionine marked A and instead appear possibly to
initiate at a highly conserved downstream methionine
(marked B in Figure 4) whereas OY175 has a truncation in the C-terminal end of the bC1 gene due to
frame shift resulting from the insertion of an A at
position 201.
The alignment (Figure 4) shows the sequences of the
bC1 proteins of CroYVMB to be distinct from those of
both BYVB and OLCuB. However, the bC1 proteins of
BYVB and OLCuB appear very similar and also very
similar to that of the newly identified BYVIB (OY168).
Table 2 shows the variation in bC1 amino acid
sequences within and between the betasatellite species.
This shows the variation in BYVIB and OLCuB bC1
sequences to fall within the range of variation for
BYVB suggesting that these species share highest
sequence identity with respect to bC1 gene, even
though variation is observed in other part of the
genome.

Phylogeographic analysis of okra betasatellites from
southern Asia

A map of India with the origins of all betasatellites isolated from okra is shown in Figure 2. This shows BYVB
to occur across Indian subcontinent. In contrast,
OLCuB appears to be limited to northern India and
eastern Pakistan. CroYVMB also has only been identified in the north but appears to have a geographical
host range running from Pakistan through the northern
states (Uttar Pradesh) to the northeastern coastal states
of West Bengal and Orrisa, with OYBUH (from Orrisa)
being the most southerly isolate identified thus far.
The phylogenetic tree of betasatellite (Figure 3) shows
very low bootstrap scores for the BYVB isolates, even
though the values are very high for the distinction
(nodes) between BYVB and the other betasatellite
sequences. This indicates that there is insufficient information present in the sequences to give a statistically
significant placement of the BYVB isolates relative to
each other within the tree (in most cases). This likely is
due to extensive insertions/deletions of sequence
between isolates (results not shown). Conducting the
phylogenetic analysis with the âexclude positions with
gapsâ and âcorrect for multiple substitutionsâ options
did not significantly alter the topography of the resulting
tree, or improve the low bootstrap values, but did significantly reduce branch lengths, particularly for BYVB isolates (results not shown). The analysis thus does not
allow us to determine whether there are phylogeographic differences for the distribution of BYVB isolates.
Analysis for recombination

The results of a comprehensive analysis, using the
Recombination detection program (RDP; [26]) and
based upon an alignment of all betasatellite sequences
obtained here with selected other betasatellites from the
databases, is summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1.
The major interspecific recombination events are summarized in Figure 5. The analysis showed the majority
of BYVB sequences to show little evidence of

recombination. Only for one isolate (OY121) was there
evidence for possible recombination with an unrelated
betasatellite, CLCuMB. The isolate shown to represent a
new species of betasatellite, OY168, showed little evidence of recombination, consisting for the most part of
sequence derived from BYVB and some sequence of
indeterminate parentage. In contrast, all three OLCuB
isolates showed very similar recombination patterns,
with BYVB as the major parent, some sequence apparently unique to OLCuB isolates and a common fragment possibly derived from CroYVMB. This is
consistent with the common geographic distribution of
BYVB, OLCuB and CroYVMB. This suggests that
OLCuB is a recombinant derivative of BYVB and
CroYVMB.
The CroYVMB isolate (OYBHU) consists for the most
part of sequence unique to CroYVMB with some
sequence of unknown origin. It is interesting to note
that three CroYMV isolates originating from the far east
of the country (GQ183865, GQ183866 and EU557375)
are distinct from all other CroYVMV isolates in having
much of their sequence apparently derived from a
Tobacco leaf curl betasatellite (TbLCB). In contrast to
the other CroYVMB isolates, which were isolated from
croton, papaya, radish and jatropha, these three isolates
came from the legume Crotalaria juncea, often used as
a green manure and fodder crop. This may suggest the
C. juncea is selecting for a distinct recombinant
CroYVMB.

Discussion
The study presented here has greatly extended our
knowledge of the diversity of betasatellites associated
with begomovirus disease of okra across Indian subcontinent. Prior to this study only a single OLCuB and six
BYVB isolates had been characterized. Our analysis
shows BYVB to be the major betasatellite associated
with okra and that this occurs across the whole of
southern Asia. OLCuB appears to have a more limited
geographic distribution across northern Pakistan and
northern India.
The malvaceous plants in the New World are affected
by bipartite begomoviruses [27-29] betasatellites not
apparently occurring in the New World [7]. In the Old
World begomoviruses infecting okra are invariably associated with betasatellites and are, for the few which have
been characterized, monopartiteâlacking the DNA B
component. Across Africa okra and other malveaceous
hosts are affected by is affected by leaf curl disease,
which is associated with begomoviruses and a single
betasatellite, Cotton leaf curl Gezira betasatellite
(CLCuGB) [30-32]. Although first identified in cotton
[33], CLCuGB is also widespread in hollyhock, Sida spp.
and tomato [7,34,35]. This situation in Africa,

Figure 5 Analysis of recombination for betasatellites isolated from okra. The bars represent the sequences of betasatellites with the likely
origins of sequences shown in color, as indicated in the box on the right. Only interspecific recombinations, that is recombination between
distinct betasatellites (as defined by Briddon et al. [6]), are shown. The betasatellite acronyms given are Bhendi yellow vein betasatellite (BYVB),
Croton yellow vein mosaic betasatellite (CroYVMB), Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB), Okra leaf curl betasatellite (OLCuB) and
Tobacco leaf curl betasatellite (TbLCB). Sequence of indeterminate origin is indicated as âunknownâ. The box below at the bottom of the
diagram indicates the approximate position of the bC1 gene, the A-rich region and the satellite conserved region (SCR), features that are
common to all betasatellites.

apparently a single betasatellite affecting okra, contrasts
markedly with the different betasatellites affecting situation we have shown in India. Okra, as we have shown is
affected by distinct betasatellites. There is at this time
some debate as to the geographic origins of okra, with
the majority favoring a southern Asian origin over a
North African origin [36]. The evidence presented here,
a greater diversity of betasatellites of okra in India than
in Africa suggesting a longer association of these on the
sub-continent, might add weight to this argument. This
is in agreement with the conclusions of Nawaz-ul-Rehman and Fauquet [37] who showed the center of diversity, and thus likely the center of origin, of
begomoviruses and betasatellites to reside in Southeast
Asia.
The presence of CroYVMB has been shown in different host plants belonging to non- malvaceous plants
such as, Croton bonplandianus (EF597245), Croton sp.
(AM410551), Crotalaria juncea (GQ183865, GQ183866,
EU557375), radish (FJ593630), Jatropha gossypifolia
(EU604296) and papaya (HM143903, HM143908),
which are supported by different helper begomoviruses
[23,38]. However, the identification of CroYVMB in
okra is something of a conundrum. CroYVMB is not a

âmalvaceous betasatelliteâ and has not previously been
identified in any malvaceous plant species. The possible
explanation for this may just be phenomenon known as
pathogen âreassortmentâ due to insect transmission by
B. tabaci, vector of a pathogen from another host plant
that is maintained in trans by a helper begomovirus.
Betasatellites, on the whole, fall into two distinct
groups, those isolated from species of the family Malvaceae and those isolated from non-malvaceous species
[5,7]. Although the malvaceous betasatellites are frequently identified in non-malvaceous plants, the converse has not been reported so frequently. This has been
taken to indicate that the requirements for infection of
species in the family Malvaceae differ from those for
non-malvaceous species.
With three (possibly four) distinct betasatellites associated with disease in okra, this raises the question as to
whether they induce distinct symptoms? Based on the
data in Table 1, there is no clear correlation between
symptom type (leaf curl/enation or yellow vein) and a
particular betasatellite species. The leaf curl/enation and
yellow vein phenotypes are associated with infections of
both OLCuB and BYVB. Of course, since only single
clones were characterized from each sample (multiple

Venkataravanappa et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:555
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/555

clones were characterized in only few isolates (data not
shown)), it is possible that the major betasatellite (of a
mixed infection) was not characterized, leading to
deceptive results. However, for CLCuMB it has been
shown that bC1 can phenocopy all symptoms of the disease (CLCuD) when introduced into a plant using a
Potato virus X vector [39], showing that the major
symptom determinant, at least for the CLCuD begomovirus-betasatellite, not the virus. It would thus be somewhat surprising to find three distinct betasatellite
species that share a high level of sequence identity with
respect to bC1 gene could induce distinct symptoms.
The possible reasons for this may be attributed to helper
viruses, other betasatellites in mixed infections, or okra
varieties. Again, only experimental inoculation with
defined clones will provide a definitive answer to this
question.
The finding that the leaf curl/enation phenotype for
infections of okra is restricted to Pakistan and northern
Indian is puzzling. The possible reason reasons for this
may be again, the helper virus, other betasatellites in
mixed infections, okra varieties or that some other factor, such as for example co-infection with another (as
yet unidentified) virus or satellite (-like) components
determine the symptom differences. Recently two studies have shown that alphasatellites, the third partner in
many begomovirus-betasatellite infections, can have a
significant effect on symptoms [21,40], although this did
not lead to a change in symptom phenotype, merely an
amelioration in symptom severity. It is also interesting
to note that the geographical occurrence of the leaf
curl/enation phenotype in okra overlaps the range of
CLCuD and one of the viruses (Cotton leaf curl Multan
virus), as well as the betasatellite know to cause CLCuD
(CLCuMB), has recently been implicated in okra leaf
curl disease for the first time reported from China [41].
The identification of a relatively high level of diversity
of betasatellites in okra has implications for the development of resistance, by both conventional breeding and
non-conventional (transgenic) approaches. Any resistant
varieties produced will need to be able to counter begomoviruses supporting all possible betasatellites to have
any chance of being durable. The finding that three of
the betasatellites identified in okra, OLCuB, BYVB and
BYVIB, have a bC1 gene with high sequence identity
provides a possible means of achieving a broad spectrum resistance in okra to begomovirus-betasatellite diseases. Targeting the shared bC1 gene (by for example
RNAi -mediated down regulation of transcript levels) or
the product of the bC1 gene (using, for example, peptide aptamers [42,43]) might yield a resistance active
against three of the four betasatellites identified hereâ
"one stone killing three birdsâ.

Our efforts are now centered on analyzing the diversity of begomoviruses that occur in okra in India. Only
a single virus, BYVV, has thus far been identified in
okra in association with BYVB [44]. The results indicated association of multiple betasatellites which are
supported by multiple distinct helper begomoviruses.
We have identified at least three distinct begomoviruses
associated with okra in India (unpublished).

Materials and methods
Collection of okra samples

Live okra plants, exhibiting virus-like symptoms, were
collected from across India during 2005 and 2007. The
geographical origin, okra cultivar (where known) and
symptoms exhibited by the plants are summarized in
Table 1. The plants were maintained in an insect-free
glasshouse at 28Â°C with supplementary lighting to yield
a 16 h photoperiod.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, cloning and
sequencing

Total Nucleic acid was extracted from field-collected
okra leaf samples using the CTAB method as modified
by Lodhi et al. [45]. Full-length betasatellites were amplified by PCR using universal primers (b01/b02; [46]).
These primers were designed to allow the amplification
of the entire betasatellite and have been shown previously
to produce products which are, in many cases, infectious
to plants [7,47]. The amplified product was cloned into
the pTZ57R vector (Fermentas) according to manufacturerâs instruction. Transformation was performed using
DH5a Escherichia coli cells. Nucleotide sequences of
plasmid DNA from clones were determined by automated sequencing at Anshul Biotechnologies DNA
Sequencing core laboratory (Hyderabad, India).
Sequence analysis

Nucleic acid sequences were analyzed using the Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, NCBI) to search
for similar sequences in the database. Multiple alignments were performed using Clustal X [48], percentage
of sequence identities were obtained using bioedit (version 7.0.9) and the neighbor joining phylogenetic tree
was generated using MEGA5 with 1000 bootstrap replications [49] and pairwise evolutionary distances were
calculated with a maximum composite likelihood
nucleotide substitution model. Analysis for recombination used the Discreet recombination events were
detected using the RDP [26], GENECONV [50], MAXCHI [51], CHIMAERA [52], SISCAN [53], and 3SEQ
[54] methods implemented in the program RDP3 (version 3.44; available from http://darwin.uvigo.es/rdp/rdp.
html) [26]. Default RDP3 settings with a 0.05 P-value
