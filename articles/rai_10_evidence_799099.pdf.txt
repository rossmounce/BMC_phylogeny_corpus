Abstract
Background: We have previously reported a HIV-1 subtype A infection in a community of injection drug users
(IDUs) in Karachi, Pakistan. We now show that this infection among the IDUs may have originated from a single
source.
Methods: Phylogenetic analysis was performed of partial gag sequences, generated using PCR, from 26 HIVpositive IDU samples.
Results: Our results showed formation of a tight monophyletic group with an intra-sequence identity of < 98%
indicating a “founder effect”. Our data indicate that the HIV-1 epidemic in this community of IDUs may have been
transmitted by an HIV positive overseas contract worker who admitted to having contact with commercial sex
workers during stay abroad.
Conclusion: Specific measures need to implemented to control transmission of HIV infection in Pakistan through
infected migrant workers.

Background
The first evidence of Human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection in Pakistan was reported in 1987 among
patients receiving tainted blood or blood products [1].
Having been relatively safe from any indigenous HIV
cases for around two decades, this conservative Southeast Asian nation is finally registering isolated HIV outbreaks all over the country.
In 2004, in the remote desert town of Larkana, Pakistan experienced its first HIV outbreak [2]. The implicated populace was a community of Injection Drug
Users (IDU), who documented an HIV prevalence
approaching an outstanding 27%. Earlier, HIV prevalence in IDUs was reported by the National AIDS Control Program as bordering around 0.4% in December,
2003. After the Larkana episode, outbreaks were also
recorded in other major cities of Pakistan [3]. The changing trend denotes that the country is transitioning
from a low prevalence to a concentrated epidemic stage.

Apart from IDUs, other high-risk populations including truck drivers [4], commercial sex workers, including
Hijras [5] have also been identified in the Pakistani context. Even though very little serological data are available, various knowledge, attitude and practice studies
[3,6-9] have demonstrated an increasingly vulnerable
position for a devastatingly spread of HIV in these highrisk groups.
Earlier, we have reported an HIV subtype A concentrated epidemic in a community of IDUs in Karachi,
Pakistan’s largest city [10]. The study presented here is
an extension of that previous study on the same community of IDUs. In the previous study we showed that
HIV-1 subtype A was the only subtype of HIV prevalent
among this community. From the data we gathered,
there were indications that this community of IDUs was
infected by HIV positive overseas commercial workers
(OCW) deported to Pakistan during early nineties [11].
We now present evidence that the subtype A infection
in question was a single-source infection, most likely
brought into the IDU community by an OCW.

Methods
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the
Ethical Review Committee, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. HIV-1 positive patients were selected from
a community of IDUs in Karachi, the Southern Port
City of Pakistan. After obtaining informed consent, 3
mL of blood was collected from 26 men (mean age, 24
years) previously diagnosed positive for HIV based on
sero-testing.
DNA was extracted from the blood samples using
methods previously described [10]. PCR amplification
was carried out for HIV gag gene using two sets of primers in a nested strategy. The primers used in nested
PCR were GOPF (5’ CTCTCGACGCAGGACTCG
GCTTGC-3’, nt 683-706, HXB2) and GOPR (5’CCAATTCCCCCTATCATTTTTGG-3’, nt 2382-2404)
for the first round of amplification and primers GIPF
(5’-GAGGCTAGAAGGAGAGAGATGGG-3’, nt 772794) and GIPR (5’-TTATTGTGACGAGGGGTCGT
TGCC-3’, nt 2269-2292) for the second round of PCR.
The reaction mixture of 25 μl for both first and second
round PCR contained 1× PCR buffer (5× Green GoTaq®
Flexi Buffer, pH 8.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 400 μM dNTPs and
0.3 U of Taq Polymerase. The first round of PCR was
performed with 0.48 pmol of primers GOPF and GOPR.
Thermocycle was: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min,
annealing at 58°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 1
min, with a final extension of at 72°C for 15 min.
1 μl of the first-round PCR product along with 0.48
pmol of the primers GIPF and GIPR was used for the
second-round PCR. Thermocycle was: denaturation at
95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at
95°C for 1 min, annealing at 60°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension of at 72°C
for 15 min. The amplified products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel, stained by ethidium bromide
and visualized under ultraviolet light.
Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis

Nested PCR products of gag gene were partially
sequenced from Macrogen Inc, Korea, using primer
GSP1 (5’-CCATCAATGAGGAAGCTGC-3’, nt 14001418, HXB2). The nucleotide sequence spanning the
p24 and p7 region of gag gene surrounded by the primers H1Gag1584 (5’-AAAGATGGATAATCCTGGG-3’)
and g17 (5’-TCCACATTTCCAACAGCCCTTTTT-3’)
[12], which has been considered for accurate subtyping
in previous studies was analyzed. Analysis of the resulting sequences was carried out using Bioinformatic tools
described previously [13]. Briefly, the sequences (comprising 460-470 bp) were compared with the sequences
from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. This was
accomplished by using the HIV BLAST Search http://

www.hiv.lanl.gov/. The samples were assigned subtypes
based on the closest homology found with the subtypes
in the Los Alamos database.
Using the same sequence, alignments were obtained
by the Clustal X program (1.83) [14]. After alignment,
gaps were stripped and minor manual adjustments were
made using MacClade [15]. From these alignments, phylogenetic relationships were determined by constructing
phylogenetic trees using neighbor-joining method with
the help of PAUP* software [16]. Pairwise genetic distances were calculated with Kimura’s two parameter
method [17].

Results and Discussion
Sequence alignment and comparison of the partial HIV1 gag gene from all twenty six IDUs revealed highly congruent topologies. Based on the phylogenetic analysis,
the HIV-1 strains from Pakistan clustered closely with
HIV-1 subtype A sequences from Senegal and Uganda.
The HIV-1 subtype A strains from Pakistan were similar
to those circulating in Africa, as opposed to those in
neighboring India. Moreover, the HIV-1 strains from
Pakistan formed a monophyletic group validating our
initial hypothesis of a possible ‘founder effect’ among
the HIV strains from IDU in Karachi.
An identity matrix constructed by BioEdit software
revealed more than 98% similarity among the 26
sequences analyzed, further confirming the ‘founder
effect’ (Additional file 1). In an independent experiment,
randomly selected 15 samples were analyzed in a similar
way, this time using sequences from HIV nef gene.
Once again, a phylogenetic tree was obtained showing
high degree of monophylogeny among the studied samples (Additional file 2).
The HIV epidemic is still in its formative stages in
Pakistan [18]. The work presented here is the first
report that analyses the molecular demographics of HIV
spread in this conservative South-East nation. We have
demonstrated that the strains circulating amongst this
select community of IDUs in Karachi are most likely a
consequence of a single-source infection. This finding
may well be applicable to other IDU communities in
Pakistan that are recording an explosive increase in HIV
infection.
In a previous report on the same community of IDUs
we indicated to the possible origin of this particular
endemic being the overseas commercial workers who
had lived in the Middle East over extended period during which they admitted to having had sexual contact
with commercial sex workers[10]. We now report deeper analysis of data from the same samples. Close phylogenetic clustering and strong identity among these HIV
sequences indicates a “founder effect” of HIV in this

was constructed by aligning the 26 sequences with HIV reference sequences from Los Alamos database. PAUP* was used to create the tree and
distance matrices were generated by using Kimura two-parameter model. The sequence O.CM.91.MVP5180 was used as out group. Closed
squares mark the nodes representing bootstrap values ≥ 60. The arrow on the right points to the study subject (HIV-GAG35) with a history of
contact with commercial sex workers during an extended stay abroad.

community of IDUs, supporting the hypothesis that this
entire group of 26 IDUs may have been infected with
HIV from a single source. The HIV infection most likely
got transmitted to the entire group through exchange of
contaminated needles. The study subject HIV-GAG35
has previously reported to having had contact with commercial sex workers during a prolong stay in Sharja,
Middle East [10]. During the early nineties, the subject
in question was deported, after being tested positive for
HIV in Sharja, to Pakistan; thereafter he developed a
habit for injecting drugs. The rest of the IDUs were
diagnosed positive for HIV in the year 2000 and later.
Based on the fact that HIV positive HIV-GAG35
sequence clustered closely with the rest of the IDU samples (Figure 1), we speculate that this patient could be a
possible source of infection in this community. That the
origin of this particular infection resides in the Middle
East is an attractive theory that may be corroborated
further through collection and analysis of HIV positive
samples from the countries in that region.
During the early nineties, an influx of HIV positive
Pakistani deportees from the Middle East constituted a
major threat to the transmission of infection in the
country [11]. The Pakistani government did respond,
albeit inadequately, to this looming disaster. Although
commendable efforts were made to devise effective measures to control HIV transmission in the country, a
structured program to screen and educate Pakistani
migrant workers regarding sexually transmitted infections is still awaited. We have indicated before [18], and
emphasize again, that with constant human traffic across
borders from Middle East, Afghanistan, and India, and
the prevalence of HIV in Pakistan on the rise, clear-cut
policies on HIV prevention across borders is urgently
warranted.

Conclusions
The HIV/AIDS epidemic is following along the same
atypical lines it has followed in the rest of Asia. Beginning from infection in the high-risk populace, the virus
soon traverses the barrier to the general population.
Pakistan is already experiencing multiple HIV outbreaks
in the IDU community in geographically diverse regions.
It would not be long before a steep rise in infection
occurs, not unlike its HIV-havocked neighbor, India
[19]. HIV-1 is circulating mostly within close-knit communities in Pakistan, such as the IDUs. It is therefore
an early opportunity for implementing targeted HIV
prevention programs in these vulnerable communities
before the infection becomes an issue for the general
populace.
