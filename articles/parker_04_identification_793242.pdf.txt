Abstract
Background: The human 6–16 and ISG12 genes are transcriptionally upregulated in a variety of
cell types in response to type I interferon (IFN). The predicted products of these genes are small
(12.9 and 11.5 kDa respectively), hydrophobic proteins that share 36% overall amino acid identity.
Gene disruption and over-expression studies have so far failed to reveal any biochemical or cellular
roles for these proteins.
Results: We have used in silico analyses to identify a novel family of genes (the ISG12 gene family)
related to both the human 6–16 and ISG12 genes. Each ISG12 family member codes for a small
hydrophobic protein containing a conserved ~80 amino-acid motif (the ISG12 motif). So far we
have detected 46 family members in 25 organisms, ranging from unicellular eukaryotes to humans.
Humans have four ISG12 genes: the 6–16 gene at chromosome 1p35 and three genes (ISG12(a),
ISG12(b) and ISG12(c)) clustered at chromosome 14q32. Mice have three family members (ISG12(a),
ISG12(b1) and ISG12(b2)) clustered at chromosome 12F1 (syntenic with human chromosome
14q32). There does not appear to be a murine 6–16 gene. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses,
genomic organisation and intron-alignments we suggest that this family has arisen through divergent
inter- and intra-chromosomal gene duplication events. The transcripts from human and mouse
genes are detectable, all but two (human ISG12(b) and ISG12(c)) being upregulated in response to
type I IFN in the cell lines tested.
Conclusions: Members of the eukaryotic ISG12 gene family encode a small hydrophobic protein
with at least one copy of a newly defined motif of ~80 amino-acids (the ISG12 motif). In higher
eukaryotes, many of the genes have acquired a responsiveness to type I IFN during evolution
suggesting that a role in resisting cellular or environmental stress may be a unifying property of all
family members. Analysis of gene-function in higher eukaryotes is complicated by the possibility of
functional redundancy between family-members. Genetic studies in organisms (e.g. Dictyostelium
discoideum) with just one family member so far identified may be particularly helpful in this respect.

Background
Interferons (IFNs) are a family of secreted cytokines [1,2]
that exert their biological activities by binding to specific
cell membrane receptors to trigger a well characterised

intracellular signalling pathway [3,4] culminating in the
transcriptional induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs).
It is through the ISGs that IFNs generate diverse cellular
and physiological states involving antiviral, apoptotic,

antiproliferative, antitumor and immunomodulatory
activities [4]. Oligonucleotide arrays have been used to
show that there are several hundred ISGs [5]. ISGs can be
responsive to type I (α/β) IFNs, type II IFNs (γ) or both.
The DNA motifs close to or within the ISGs that mediate
these responses are the 14 nt IFN Stimulated Response
Elements (ISREs) and the 9 nt GAS elements for type I and
type II IFNs, respectively. Most ISGs code for proteins
whose biochemical and cellular roles are either well
understood (e.g the genes for RNA-dependent protein
kinase PKR [6,7], 2'-5' Oligoadenylate Synthetase [8,9]
and the genes of the MHC [10,11]), or partially understood (e.g. the p202 genes [12], p56 [13], and the 1–8
family [14]). There remains some prominent ISGs, however, including 6–16 [15] and ISG12 [16] for which there
are no known biochemical or cellular functions.
IFN is used in the treatment of several human diseases
including Hepatitis C [17,18] and multiple sclerosis [19].
Unfortunately, IFN treatment can have unwanted side
effects [20] the mechanisms of which remain unclear. It
has, therefore, long been recognised that to thoroughly
understand IFN function and to minimise the side effects
of IFN therapies, a more complete understanding of the
ISGs is required.
The type I IFN stimulated human 6–16 and ISG12 (herein
renamed as ISG12(a)) are ISGs that encode small hydrophobic proteins (Mr 12.9 kDa and 11.5 kDa, respectively). The predicted proteins share 36% overall aminoacid identity and 49% identity over an ~80 amino acid
length. Both genes are regulated by type I IFNs in a
number of cell lines [21-23]. Human 6–16, in particular,
is characterised by its high inducibility in response to IFN.
In HeLa cells 6–16 mRNA can constitute as much as 0.1%
of the total mRNA after IFN stimulation [22]. It is therefore likely that these genes play an important role in the
IFN response.
Despite gene disruption [24] and over-expression [25]
studies, cellular and/or biochemical roles for the 6–16
and ISG12 gene products have not been identified. One
way to address this problem is to identify related genes
whose characteristics may provide clues to function.
Here we present in silico data identifying a novel family of
genes (the ISG12 gene family) related to human 6–16 and
ISG12. Each family member codes for a small, hydrophobic protein that contains a conserved, 80 amino-acid
motif. So far, 46 members of this family have been determined in 25 organisms ranging from higher mammals to
single celled amoeba. While none of the genes has a
known function, identification of this family indicates a
number of systems in which gene function can be
investigated.

Results and discussion
Identification and characterisation of ESTs related to
human 6–16 and ISG12
We have used the human 6–16 (accession number:
BN000257) and ISG12 (accession number: BN000225)
sequences to conduct an online BLAST search, at the protein level, of EMBL and Genbank databanks and so
uncover ~1,500 separate nucleotide sequences (EST,
genomic, mRNA etc). Alignment of these sequences
allowed subdivision into 46 different transcripts (named
according to phylogenetic analysis, below) originating
from 25 different species (summarised, Table 1). Clustal
W [26] was used to align the ~1,500 nucleotide sequences
and generate a consensus sequences for each of the 46 different transcripts. These consensus sequences were then
submitted to EMBL as third party annotations (accession
numbers shown in Table 1). Putative protein coding
sequences were determined using the first ATG rule [27].
Performing a BLAST search with any of these 46 putative
proteins uncovers nearly the same set of ~1,500 genes
described above. This suggests that there is a highly conserved region shared by these sequences.
Identification of a conserved ISG12 protein motif
An alignment of the 46 putative amino-acid sequences
listed in Table 1 was used to identify an ~80 amino-acid
ISG12 motif (Figure 1) shared by all. This alignment has
been submitted to Pfam (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Soft
ware/Pfam/, Version 10, accession number: PF06140)
and represents a newly identified gene family, the ISG12
gene family. Using the ISG12 motif for BLAST searches did
not uncover any further family members. All family members encode a single motif except for one of the mouse
genes, ISG12(b), which encodes two.

Analyses of predicted protein sequences with programme
suites such as PredictProtein http://www.embl-heidel
berg.de/predictprotein/predictprotein.html or EMBOSS
http://www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/Registered/Webapp/embossw2h/ did not give many clues as to signalling, structure or
function. The proteins identified are hydrophobic (Table
1, Figure 2) raising the possibility that they may be membrane-associated proteins. Transmembrane prediction
programmes (TMHMM [28], HMMTOP [29] and SMART
[30]) gave varied and therefore inconclusive results (data
not shown), although immunocytochemical analysis
appears to locate ISG12(a) to the nuclear membrane [25].
Regions outside the motif do not share good sequence
identity, but are similar in that they are often short, hydrophobic and contain a high percentage of residues with
small side groups (A, B, C, D, G, N, P, S, T and V).

www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk to show the hydrophobicity of predicted protein sequences for mouse ISG12(a), human ISG12(a) and
human 6–16. ISG12 motifs are highlighted in yellow.

Phylogenetic analysis
In order to determine whether the 46 genes identified
form particular subgroups, phylogenetic analysis was performed in higher mammals.

The mammalian sequences from Figure 1 were used to
compose a parsimonious tree using Dictyostelium discoideum as a distant relative for the out-grouping of the tree
(Figure 3). Four tentative clades were identified in this
way: 6–16, ISG12a, ISG12b and ISG12c. Bootstrapping
shows that, where the 6–16 genes have stable branches,
the remaining genes cannot be as stringently divided in
this way. Only genes in closely related species seem to give
stable branching points (i.e. mouse and rat ISG12a and
ISG12b's) suggesting that the ISG12 gene-products are less
uniformly divergent than the 6–16 gene products.
Gene organisation
To clarify the grouping of family members, BLAST was
used to identify ISG12 genomic sequences. Aligning
mRNA and genomic DNA sequence revealed intron/exon
structure and, for organisms with sufficiently complete
genome sequences (human, mouse, rat), chromosomal
locations of ISG12 family members could be identified.
The results for human and mouse genes are summarised
in Figure 4. The human, mouse and rat (not shown)
ISG12 genes cluster at syntenic loci (14q32, 12F1 and
6q32, respectively). By identifying conserved genes immediately flanking these clusters (ATP-dependent RNA Helicase DDX24 (Dead-Box Protein 24) and Heat-Like
Repeat-containing protein isoform 1), the mouse and
human loci could be correctly aligned, simplifying
comparison of ISG12 gene organisation between the two
species. The relative positions and opposing orientations
of hISG12(a) and hISG12(b) are matched in the mouse
locus by mISG12(a) and mISG12(b1)/mISG12(b2). This,

plus the conserved intron/exon arrangement in
hISG12(b), mISG12(b1) and the two halves of
mISG12(b2), suggests that hISG12(a) and mISG12(a) are
orthologues, and that the mISG12(b1) and mISG12(b2)
genes arose from an ancestral murine orthologue of
hISG12(b) by two gene duplications and one gene fusion.
This leaves only hISG12(c) whose orientation is consistent
with it having arisen by duplication of hISG12(a). Thus
the phylogenetic relationship of the ISG12 genes, reflected
in their assigned suffixes (a, b, b1 etc), is supported by the
analysis of gene structure.
Where intron/exon structure is available, intron position
was marked on an alignment (as in Figure 1) of predicted
protein sequences (Figure 5). Intron site conservation at
the N and C termini of the motif is much more pronounced than elsewhere. This is consistent with the possibility that the motif represents a structural domain that is
evolutionarily conserved while being placed in different
sequence contexts by exon shuffling. Stuctural analyses
will be required to test this possibility.
We can postulate, then, that the ISG12 family arose from
an ancestral gene that underwent an initial gene
duplication event to form ISG12(a) and ISG12(b). This
event probably happened between the emergence of
amoeba and divergence of fish, judging by the identification of only one ISG12 in simple eukaryotes, such as Dictyostelium, and multiple ISG12's in mammals, fish and
birds. The 6–16 clade appears to have arisen by interchromosomal duplication just before the divergence of the
ungulates and primates. The ISG12(b2) and ISG12(c)
genes probably arose relatively recently (phylogenetic evidence suggests that cow b2 and mouse b2 are probably
not orthologues (Figure 3)) as these have not been found
in other organisms. That the ISG12 motif has been found

in organisms that do not host the IFN signalling pathway
indicates that the IFN responsiveness seen in human 6–16
and ISG12(a) arose later in evolution. There may be a
basic function shared by all family members that has been
co-opted in higher organisms to become part of the IFN
response.

IFN responsiveness of ISG12 transcripts
The finding that the ISG12 motif occurs in simple eukaryotes suggests that not all ISG12 genes in higher organisms
have necessarily been incorporated into the IFN response.

(ISREs;

Semi-quantitative, RT-PCR analysis was used to determine
whether the human and mouse ISG12 genes were responsive to type I IFN (Figure 6). This confirmed that, as previously shown [21,22], human 6–16 and ISG12(a) are
highly IFN-responsive in the human fibrosarcoma
HT1080 cell line. As might be expected from the positioning of ISRE's so close to exon 1 (Figure 4), mouse
ISG12(a) is also IFN-responsive, though much less
strongly (Figure 6) than human ISG12(a). Mouse
ISG12(b1) and (b2) are IFN-responsive in the fibroblast
cell line L-929, but human ISG12(b) and (c) were not
induced in HT1080 cells despite the proximity of putative
ISRE sequences. Figure 6 does show that all the genes
tested are transcribed in the cell lines tested and does not
preclude IFN-stimulation in other cell lines of those genes
so far not found to be inducible.

Conclusions
Using EMBL and Genbank searches, we have been able to
compile a family of 46 genes related to the human 6–16
and human ISG12(a) genes. Aligning all 46 genes reveals

an ~80 amino-acid motif (the ISG12 motif) that is shared
between genes in species as diverse as amoeba and
humans. The 46 genes identified code for highly hydrophobic, potentially membrane-embedded proteins and
fall into four main groups; 6–16, ISG12(a), ISG12(b) and
ISG12(c). These four distinct gene groups seem to have
been derived through gene duplication and divergent evolution, with all genes, other than 6–16, remaining clustered in syntenic loci.
The existence of a member of the ISG12 gene family in
Dictyostelium discoideum, which does not possess the IFN
system, combined with evidence that some family members in higher eukaryotes are not IFN-responsive (at least
in some cell types), suggests that IFN stimulation plays an
ancillary role in ISG12 gene function, and is not a defining
characteristic. Further work is required to identify any unifying biochemical or cellular function for the ISG12 family. One such function may be as part of a response to
cellular or environmental stress. This would certainly
encompass those family members that have become part

Methods
Database searches and sequence alignments
The Genbank and EMBL databases were screened using
the online BLAST [31,32] server at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST
and
http://
menu.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast
(authorization
required) respectively. Searches were performed at both
the nucleotide (blastn) and amino acid (blastp) levels.

Sequences were aligned using Clustal W [26] in the MAGI
(Multiple Alignment General Interface) suit at http://
menu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/menu-bin/MAGI/magi (authorization required) and then manipulated for presentation
using Boxshade at http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/
BOX_form.html.
Putative proteins for mouse ISG12(a), human ISG12(a)
and human 6–16 were used for basic in silico protein structure analysis using the programmes HMMTOP [29],
SMART [30] and TMHMM [28] to give prediction of transmembrane helices and hydrophobicity plots.

Figure 6
Expression of human and mouse ISG12 genes in cell lines
Expression of human and mouse ISG12 genes in cell
lines. Transcripts for the indicated human and mouse ISG12
genes were detected by RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from the
human HT1080 cells (a) or mouse L-929 cells (b) treated
with (left hand panels) or without (right hand panels) type I
IFN for 24 h. The indicated serial five-fold dilutions of
reverse transcripts were analysed by PCR. Most PCR assays
included, as an internal control, primers for beta-actin (βAc). Diagnostic products for each transcript are arrowed. M
= size markers.

of the IFN system, which is itself a response cellular insults
such as viral infection and oxidative stress, while allowing
for the possibility that other family members contribute
to combating cellular stress independently of the IFN system. In organisms that have multiple family members,
functional redundancy may complicate genetic analyses
of ISG12 gene function, and multiple gene-knockouts or
knockdowns may be required to reveal a clear phenotype.
Members of the ISG12 gene family were not found in
common laboratory model organisms such as fruit flies or
nematode worms, despite searching complete genomes
with the motif. However, studies of simpler organisms,
such as the slime mould D. discoideum, with only one
ISG12 gene, may provide a useful alternative approach.

Phylogenetic analysis
Putative amino acid sequences of genes found above were
aligned using Clustal W as above. Phylogenetic analyses
of the alignment were conducted using Protpar on the
Phylip package [33] through the PIE (Phylogeny Interface
Environment) suit at http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Regis
tered/Webapp/pie/. A maximum parsimony tree with
branch confidence values based on 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed. The putative protein coding
sequence for D. discoideum was used as an out-grouping
species. The tree was then annotated with bootstrap confidence levels (* = > 60 %, ** = > 85 %).
Cell lines
The human cell lines HT1080 (ATCC#CCL-121) and
HEK293 (ATCC#CCL-1573) and mouse cell lines L-929
(ATCC#CCL-1) were cultured as monolayers in 1 × Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (GIBCO) supplemented
with heat inactivated FCS (10 % (v/v), Globepharm), Lglutamine (2 mM, GIBCO), non-essential amino acids
(0.4 mM, GIBCO), sodium pyruvate (1 mM, GIBCO) and
antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin (100 Uml-1 and 100
µgml-1 respectively, GIBCO). The cells were grown to
~40% confluency and then induced using type I IFN (AD
hybrid IFN, 200 IUml-1, 24 hours).
RT-PCR of ISG12 transcripts
RNA was prepared from cultured cells as described [23]
and used (2 µg) with oligo(dt)18 primer to synthesis firststrand cDNA (Promega).

PCR reactions (25 µl) were set up with dNTPs (0.25 mM,
Pharmacia), experiment primers (100 ng each, Genosys),

control primers (as described, 18s QuantumRNA,
Ambion), 1 × reaction buffer (Qiagen), Taq polymerase
(1.25 U, Qiagen) and template (1 µl of 25 µl cDNA-synthesis reaction). The following oligonucleotides were used
as
primers;
