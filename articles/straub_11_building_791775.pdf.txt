Abstract
Background: Milkweeds (Asclepias L.) have been extensively investigated in diverse areas of evolutionary biology
and ecology; however, there are few genetic resources available to facilitate and compliment these studies. This
study explored how low coverage genome sequencing of the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.) could be
useful in characterizing the genome of a plant without prior genomic information and for development of
genomic resources as a step toward further developing A. syriaca as a model in ecology and evolution.
Results: A 0.5× genome of A. syriaca was produced using Illumina sequencing. A virtually complete chloroplast
genome of 158,598 bp was assembled, revealing few repeats and loss of three genes: accD, clpP, and ycf1. A nearly
complete rDNA cistron (18S-5.8S-26S; 7,541 bp) and 5S rDNA (120 bp) sequence were obtained. Assessment of
polymorphism revealed that the rDNA cistron and 5S rDNA had 0.3% and 26.7% polymorphic sites, respectively. A
partial mitochondrial genome sequence (130,764 bp), with identical gene content to tobacco, was also assembled.
An initial characterization of repeat content indicated that Ty1/copia-like retroelements are the most common
repeat type in the milkweed genome. At least one A. syriaca microread hit 88% of Catharanthus roseus
(Apocynaceae) unigenes (median coverage of 0.29×) and 66% of single copy orthologs (COSII) in asterids (median
coverage of 0.14×). From this partial characterization of the A. syriaca genome, markers for population genetics
(microsatellites) and phylogenetics (low-copy nuclear genes) studies were developed.
Conclusions: The results highlight the promise of next generation sequencing for development of genomic
resources for any organism. Low coverage genome sequencing allows characterization of the high copy fraction of
the genome and exploration of the low copy fraction of the genome, which facilitate the development of
molecular tools for further study of a target species and its relatives. This study represents a first step in the
development of a community resource for further study of plant-insect co-evolution, anti-herbivore defense, floral
developmental genetics, reproductive biology, chemical evolution, population genetics, and comparative genomics
using milkweeds, and A. syriaca in particular, as ecological and evolutionary models.

Background
The advent of next generation sequencing technology
has presented the opportunity to obtain genome-scale
data for any organism [1-3]. Detailed information about
the characteristics of the genome of a non-model organism, especially the high-copy fraction, can be obtained
even with very low overall coverage of a genome [4-6].

Repeat types can be characterized to assess the presence
and prevalence of retrotransposons, DNA transposons,
and other simple and low-complexity repeats [e.g.,
[4,7,8]]. Nearly complete sequences of organellar genomes are also readily obtained [e.g., [4,9-14]]. If genomic
resources are available for a close relative, a portion of
the gene space of the nuclear genome might also be surveyed [12]. In contrast to the above studies, next generation sequencing in non-model organisms has thus far
primarily been used for characterization of transcriptomes [3] and as a tool for marker development in

population and conservation genetics [e.g., [15,16]], phylogenetics [10,17], and other areas of evolutionary biology [e.g., [18]].
As the most intensively studied member of a genus
that has been investigated extensively in diverse areas of
evolutionary biology and ecology [e.g., [19-24]], the
common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L., Apocynaceae)
is an attractive non-model target for the development of
genomic resources. Interest in the genus has been
focused on complex and specialized floral structures,
particularly as they relate to insect pollination [21], and
on the remarkable chemical ecology exemplified by cardenolide-sequestering specialist herbivores, such as the
monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), that utilize Asclepias defense compounds to defend themselves against
their own predators [25]. In the context of floral biology
and plant-insect coevolution, Asclepias has the potential
to add substantially to existing ecological and evolutionary model systems (e.g., Arabidopsis, Mimulus, Aquilegia), although genomic resources for Asclepias are
currently far more limiting than for these model systems. Genomic resources have been developed for only
two other species in the same order (Gentianales) as
Asclepias: coffee (Coffea; http://www.coffeegenome.org)
and Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus: Apocynaceae), for which there are expressed sequence tag
(EST) collections [26-28].
The aims of this study were to demonstrate how a
small amount of Illumina short read sequence data
could be useful for whole genome characterization of a
plant species with no prior genomic information and to
develop genomic resources for milkweeds. To these
ends, the genome of Asclepias syriaca was characterized
using 0.5× sequence coverage obtained from a single
lane of 40 bp Illumina reads. Reference-guided assembly
was used to assemble and characterize the high copy
fraction of the A. syriaca genome, including the complete chloroplast and partial mitochondrial genomes and
a nearly complete nuclear ribosomal DNA cistron and
5S rDNA sequence. De novo assemblies were used to
characterize the repeat structure of the genome and to
develop nuclear markers consisting of low-copy nuclear
loci for phylogenetics and microsatellite loci for population genetics. This study highlights the extent to which
a non-model plant genome can be characterized with
low coverage genome sequencing and represents the
first step in developing the resources needed to develop
Asclepias as a new genetic model system in ecological
and evolutionary studies [29].

Methods
Genome size estimation

Leaves were collected from five A. syriaca individuals
from an experimental agricultural population in western

Page 2 of 22

Illinois and frozen at -20°C. Samples of approximately
3×3 mm green leaf tissue were chopped in 150 μl Partec
CysStain UV Precise P Nuclei extraction buffer (made
1.0% w/v PVP-40; Partec North America, Inc., Swedesboro, NJ, USA) on ice in the presence of (~8×8 mm) B73 maize (1C = 2.725 pg) leaf tissue as internal reference. Upon filtering and addition of 600 μl CysStain UV
Precise P Staining Buffer, samples were run on a Partec
PA flow cytometer until at least 1000 counts were
recorded for both the sample and reference peaks. The
estimated DNA content values for the five individuals
were averaged and the genome size calculated using a
standard conversion factor [30].
Illumina library preparation and sequencing

Leaf tissue was sampled from a single individual from a
natural population of A. syriaca in Ogle County, Illinois
[Fishbein 4885 (OKLA)]. Total genomic DNA was
extracted using the Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification
kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following homogenization of 100 mg of silica-dried tissue flash-frozen in
liquid N2 and ground with mortar and pestle. A BioRuptor Sonicator (Diagenode Inc., Denville, NJ, USA) was
used to shear 2.5 μg of the extracted DNA using 15 one
min cycles (30 sec on/30 sec off, setting ‘high’, 4°C).
Subsequent library preparation followed the standard
multi-step Illumina protocol [31]. Ligated, size-selected
fragments (~280 - 320 bp) were amplified through 18
cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and standard Illumina primers.
Resulting product concentrations were determined using
a Nanodrop 1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Wilmington,
DE, USA).
Enriched, cleaned product was diluted to 5 pM and
submitted for sequencing on an Illumina GAII sequencer at the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB) at Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR,
USA). Denaturation, cluster generation, and subsequent
sequencing followed the manufacturer’s recommendations. Sequencing was completed over 40 cycles on a
single lane of the Illumina GAII. Image analysis, basecalling and error estimation were performed using the
Illumina GA Pipeline version 1.5. Images were collected
from 120 tiles, averaging over 107,000 clusters/tile, and
resulted in over 420 Mbp of sequence data after quality
filtering.
Reference-guided assembly

Reference-guided assembly of microreads was facilitated
using a pipeline of five open source scripts called “alignreads.” The pipeline incorporates: YASRA [32], a short
read assembler; NUCMER, an aligner from the MUMmer 3.0 suite [33,34]; delta-filter, a utility program from

Straub et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/211

the MUMmer 3.0 suite that removes excessive/erroneous alignments; “sumqual,” a python script created to
integrate the NUCMER alignment information with the
YASRA assembly information; and “qualtofa,” another
python script that reformats and filters the output of
sumqual based on user inputs. A consensus sequence of
the aligned contigs is produced, which can be masked
based on base call proportion and coverage depth; single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be masked similarly using separate user specifications. Scripts are available for download at http://milkweedgenome.org. Read
depth was determined by calculating median base
sequencing depth from the alignreads output.
Chloroplast Genome

The reference-guided assembly of the chloroplast genome was completed in alignreads using the chloroplast
genome sequence of oleander (Nerium oleander: Apocynaceae; M. Moore and D. Soltis, unpublished data; see
[17] for coding sequences) with only one copy of the
inverted repeat included as the reference and no masking. A second alignment of the YASRA contigs was
completed using Mulan [35], and the resulting consensus sequence was compared to the alignreads output
and tested as an alternate reference input for alignreads.
All of the consensus sequences were aligned to each
other and the oleander reference using MAFFT 6.240
[36]. A preliminary annotation of the A. syriaca chloroplast genome was completed using DOGMA [37]. The
annotations of protein coding regions, ribosomal DNA
(rDNA), and sequences corresponding to transfer RNAs
(tRNAs) were improved by fixing annotation and assembly mistakes (e.g., no start or stop codon, internal stop
codons, frameshifts, endpoints of tRNA sequences)
through examination of the actual assembly of the short
reads at that location in Tablet vers. 1.10.09.20 [38]
and/or comparisons to ortholog sequences from other
asterids obtained from NCBI GenBank (e.g., Nerium,
Coffea, Solanum). Various versions of the chloroplast
genome sequence were used as a reference in alignreads
to further refine the sequence based on new assemblies.
Discrepancies between the assembly consensus
sequences in introns and intergenic spacers were
explored at the microread-level in Tablet to identify the
correct sequence. An Asclepias tuberosa sequence [GenBank:GQ248251.1] served as a reference in alignreads to
correctly assemble the trnH - psbA region.
In order to produce the highest quality A. syriaca
chloroplast genome sequence and annotation, the consensus sequences were also aligned to chloroplast genome sequences for other individuals of A. syriaca
produced in alignreads and Velvet 1.0.12 [39] based on
either 80 bp single end or paired end Illumina
sequences (S. Straub and A. Liston, unpublished data).
Discrepancies between the consensus sequences from

Page 3 of 22

these assemblies and the original consensus sequences
were resolved as either intraspecific variation, assembly
or alignment errors in the 40 bp read data set, or unresolved assembly errors. Informatically unresolved errors
(e.g., AT-rich repeats) were corrected by obtaining Sanger sequences spanning those regions. Gene sequences
that were expected to be divergent from the reference
(e.g., ycf1) and putative pseudogenes were also checked
by Sanger sequencing. PCR reactions contained ~10-20
ng template DNA and had a final concentration of 1×
Phusion® Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Finnzymes) and 0.2 μM of primer. PCR cycling conditions
were 98°C for 30 s followed by 25 cycles of 98°C for 10
s, primer set specific annealing temperature for 30 s, 72°
C for 30 s, and a final extension of 72°C for 5 min. See
Table 1 for primer sequences and annealing temperatures. Cycling extension times were increased to 60 s
and final extension times to 10 min for accD and clpP.
Cycling extension times were increased to 90 s and final
extension times to 10 min for ycf1-ndhF and rps15-ycf1.
The success of PCR reactions was confirmed using agarose gel electrophoresis. The chloroplast and mitochondrial paralogs of accD were co-amplified, bands excised
from a 1.2% agarose gel, and purified using a QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Due to low yield, the
mitochondrial product was re-amplified using 1 μl of
extract as PCR template prior to sequencing. For additional chloroplast accD sequencing, the mitochondrial
product was virtually eliminated from the PCR pool by
raising the annealing temperature to 61°C. Sequences
were produced using standard dye termination techniques by High-Throughput Sequencing Solutions at the
University of Washington http://www.htseq.org or the
Oregon State University CGRB. The quality of the finished A. syriaca chloroplast genome sequence was
assessed by using it as the reference sequence in alignreads to re-assemble the 40 bp reads and any discrepancies were explored and corrected.
The final annotation of the A. syriaca chloroplast genome was accomplished using BioEdit 7.0.5.3 [40] and
visualized using GenomeVx [41]. The repeat content of
the chloroplast genome was determined using the NCBI
BLAST tool blast2seq. Only repeat motifs of greater
than 30 bp and 85% sequence identity were characterized. Sequence identities were calculated in BioEdit on
sequence alignments produced in MAFFT with the
gapped positions removed. Ka/Ks values for pseudogenes were calculated using the Bergen Center for Computational Science Ka/Ks calculation tool http://services.
cbu.uib.no/tools/kaks.
Mitochondrial Genome

The mitochondrial genome of A. syriaca was assembled
using the alignreads pipeline and the 430,597 bp mitochondrial genome sequence of Nicotiana tabacum

For each region, additional primers appearing after the two original PCR primers are internal sequencing primers.

[GenBank:BA000042.1] [42] as a reference. Mitofy [43]
was used to characterize the complement of protein
coding, rRNA, and tRNA genes in the resulting contigs.
The annotation of the mitochondrial genome of N.
tabacum was updated using Mitofy before comparison
of the gene content of the two genomes. BLAT [44]
under default parameters was used to estimate the percentage of each A. syriaca mitochondrial gene
assembled by calculating the proportion of the total
length of the N. tabacum mitochondrial genes with hits
in the A. syriaca contigs. The presence or absence of
the cox1 group I intron in Asclepias was determined by
using the Hoya sikkimensis (Apocynaceae) cox1
sequence [GenBank:AJ247588.1] as a BLAT reference.

Ribosomal DNA

The nuclear rDNA cistron, including 18S, 5.8S, and 26S,
was assembled in alignreads using a 669 bp partial
sequence from A. syriaca [GenBank:AM396892] spanning the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) as the reference. Following the initial assembly, the assembly was
repeated using the reverse complement of the reference
sequence as the new reference to correct for an inconsistency in YASRA that caused the assembly result to be
strand specific. A consensus sequence of the contigs
obtained through the first two analyses was then used as
the reference for a final assembly. A 5S rDNA sequence
for A. syriaca was assembled using a 330 bp sequence
including the 5S locus from Solanum iopetalum

Straub et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/211

[GenBank:AJ226045] as a reference in both the forward
and reverse directions.
To assess intragenomic polymorphism, the complete
genomic read pool was filtered for reads matching the
consensus sequences of the assembled rDNA loci using
BLAT and custom scripts [45]. Reads were discarded if
their average Phred score was less than 20, and the
remaining reads filtered so that any base in a read with
a Phred score less than 20 was converted to ‘N’ using
the FASTX-Toolkit [46]. Modified reads were assembled
against the reference sequence using BWA [47], and at
each position the number of reads differing from the
consensus was tallied and a proportion calculated (script
available from KW). In order to estimate the error introduced by the sequencing method, the same procedure
was applied to the PhiX174 control lane of the sequencing run.
Positions with 2% or more of reads differing from the
consensus were considered to represent true polymorphism. This cutoff is comparable to error rates previously found using a similar quality-filtering scheme
[48], but may be somewhat conservative as it is much
higher than the error seen in the PhiX lane. See additional file 1: Polymorphism detected among Illumina
reads for the PhiX sequencing control. All positions of
the PhiX genome exhibited <0.7% differing reads except
position 3132, which had >17% of reads differing from
the consensus. While the reason for this anomaly is
uncertain, the overall average error rate in the PhiX lane
is <0.05%.
De novo assembly

Data Quality Control Perl scripts were used to remove
microreads containing N’s and those reads corresponding to Illumina adapter sequences from the chastity-filtered short read pool to create a cleaned read pool [45].
The remaining reads were trimmed of bases of low
quality or unscorable quality (quality score “B” in Illumina fastq files) and all bases subsequent to these bases
to produce a cleaned and trimmed read pool [45].
De novo assembly of the cleaned read pool was performed using VelvetOptimiser 2.1.7 [49] and Velvet
1.0.12 with the minimum contig length set to 100 bp.
Hash lengths between 19 and 31 were screened to find
the optimal hash length for maximizing the total bases
included in contigs. The expected coverage and the optimum coverage cutoff were estimated by VelvetOptimiser
to be 2 and 0.3777216 respectively. This analysis was
repeated for the cleaned and trimmed read pool. Use of
the cleaned read pool resulted in more total bases in
contigs; therefore this pool was used for all downstream
de novo analyses. In order to further characterize the A.
syriaca nuclear genome, BLAT was used to remove
reads corresponding to nuclear rDNA and the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes using the sequences

generated through reference guided assembly. The de
novo assembly was repeated to produce the set of contigs used for the non-rDNA repetitive element categorization and microsatellite marker development. The
organellar genome and rDNA BLAT analyses were also
used to estimate the percentage of overall reads corresponding to the high copy fraction of the genome.
Repetitive Element Characterization Non-ribosomal
nuclear repetitive elements were characterized by submitting the de novo contigs to the MAKER [50] web
annotation service http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/
mwas.html and categorizing the RepeatMasker [51] output from the MAKER run. The percentage of unique
read hits to these contigs was determined using BLAT,
with minimum sequence identity set to 70%, to find hits
to the contigs of putative DNA transposon or retrotransposon origin. The overall percentage of reads corresponding to known repetitive elements was calculated
using BLAT (minimum sequence identity = 70%) to
determine the number of reads that hit the Viridiplantae
repeat sequences downloaded from the Repbase Update
release 15.07 database [52].
Microsatellite Marker Development De novo contigs of
at least 150 bp, to allow for sufficient flanking sequence
for primer design, were scanned for microsatellites using
BatchPrimer3 [53]. Primers were designed flanking perfect di- and trinucleotide repeats of four or more repeat
units and perfect tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide
repeats of three or more repeat units such that the PCR
amplicon sizes ranged between 100 and 450 bp and primers met the default criteria for SSRs primers (Table 2;
also see additional file 2: Primer sets designed using
BatchPrimer3 for 184 nuclear microsatellite loci in
Asclepias syriaca not tested for amplification success).
Contigs containing at least one microsatellite locus for
which primers could be designed were submitted to the
PLAN web service [54], with the ‘DNA to DNA: blastn
against NCBI NT 20081206 database, top 10 hits with e
< = 0.1 cut-off’ option selected, in order to check if any
chloroplast or mitochondrial sequences had not been
eliminated from the read pool used to generate the de
novo contigs. To produce the best set of primers for
candidate nuclear microsatellite locus development,
those primer sets originating from contigs with a chloroplast or mitochondrial BLAST [55] hit with an E-value
of 1e-5 or lower were removed from the candidate pool.
Primers were tested for amplification success for the
25 top candidate loci, which were selected for having
the highest number of repeat units among all candidates. PCR amplification was conducted on genomic
DNA of the same A. syriaca accession used for genome
sequencing in 50 μl reactions. Each reaction consisted of
1 μl DNA extract template, 1.25 U GoTaq® Flexi DNA
Polymerase and 1× Green Flexi Reaction Buffer

(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM
dNTPs, and 0.8 mM amplification primers. PCR was
carried out in a C1000™ thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) under the following conditions: initial
denaturing at 95°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 95°C for 30
sec-variable annealing temperature for 30 sec-72°C for 1
min, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
See Table 2 for annealing temperatures. Amplicons of
the predicted size were confirmed using agarose gel
electrophoresis.
Nuclear genome characterization and development of
low copy nuclear markers

In order to provide an initial characterization of nuclear
gene content and coverage, all 19,899 available ESTs for
Catharanthus roseus were downloaded from GenBank
on 29 November 2010. See additional file 3: List of GI
numbers for 19,899 Catharanthus roseus ESTs downloaded from GenBank and assembled into unigenes. The
sequences were subjected to simple cleaning in SeqClean (Dana Farber Cancer Institute; available at http://
sourceforge.net/projects/seqclean). Cleaned and trimmed
sequences were assembled into unigenes using iAssembler v1.2 (available at http://bioinfo.bti.cornell.edu/tool/
iAssembler). Unigenes with BLAT hits corresponding to
the rDNA or chloroplast or mitochondrial genomes of
A. syriaca were excluded from this set. Simple repeats,
low complexity sequences, and long terminal repeats
were masked in the remaining unigenes using the
RepeatMasker web service [[51]; available at http://www.
repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/WEBRepeatMasker]. BLAT
with a tile size of 7 and minimum sequence identity of
80% was used to find read hits to the remaining putatively nuclear masked unigenes. The number of unique
microread hits per unigene was used to calculate the
hits per kb of sequence based on the length of gene.
Coverage for these genes was then estimated using the
formula [(hits per kb of sequence × length of the microread)/1000]. Coverage is overestimated when reads overlap. JMP 9.0.0 (SAS Institute, Inc.) was used to calculate
coverage distributions. A Monte Carlo resampler implemented in PopTools [56] was used to calculate 95%
bootstrap confidence intervals (1,000 iterations) for
median hits per kb and coverage values.
With low genome coverage, few if any single-copy
nuclear genes were expected to have been assembled in
de novo contigs. In order to extract useful information
for nuclear marker development from the unassembled,
uncleaned pool of reads and further explore the A. syriaca gene space, BLAT with a tile size of 7 and minimum sequence identity of 80% was used to find reads
that hit alignments for 1,086 single-copy orthologs from
other asterids [e.g., tomato (Solanum lycopersicum),
potato (Solanum tuberosum), pepper (Capsicum

Page 7 of 22

annuum), coffee (Coffea canephora)] and Arabidopsis
thaliana [COS II markers; [57]]. The average length of
sequences included in each alignment was used as the
gene length in subsequent calculations, which were
completed as described above for the Catharanthus unigene set.
The COSII pool of candidate genes was most appropriate for the development of markers intended for phylogenetics because single-copy genes are preferred in
order to avoid ortholog/paralog conflation. MAFFT
6.240 was used to align the Asclepias microreads with
the COSII alignments using the localpair option and
1,000 cycles of iterative refinement. Primers were
designed in exons flanking the putative locations of one
or more introns based on the location of introns in A.
thaliana indicated by the Sol Genomics Network’s
intron finder application http://solgenomics.net/tools/
intron_detection/find_introns.pl for genes with 0.5× or
greater coverage (Table 3). If possible, primers were
designed with GC clamps and were chosen from sections of the read identical to or highly similar to the coffee sequence without mismatches near the 3’ end of the
primer sequence.
The primers designed using the A. syriaca microreads
were tested for amplification success and their utility in
phylogenetic studies of Asclepias and across Apocynaceae. Vouchers for all DNA samples used are listed in
Table 4. DNA was extracted as described above for A.
syriaca. PCR amplification was conducted in 50 μl reactions on genomic DNA of the same A. syriaca accession
used for genome sequencing, 16 accessions of 13 other
species of American Asclepias, including four accessions
of two morphotypes of A. pringlei, one species of Gomphocarpus belonging to the sister clade to American
Asclepias, and one sample each of successive sister
groups to the clade including Asclepias and Gomphocarpus (Calotropis and Pergularia). Each reaction consisted
of 1 μl template DNA extract, 1.25 U GoTaq® Flexi DNA
Polymerase and 1× Green Flexi Reaction Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 200 μM
dNTPs, and 0.8 mM amplification primers. PCR was carried out in a C1000™ thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules,
CA, USA) under the following conditions: initial denaturing at 94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec-variable annealing temperature for 30 sec-72°C for 1 min,
followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. See Table
3 for primer sequences and annealing temperatures.
For the Apocynaceae-wide analyses, species from four
tribes (Marsdenieae, Baisseeae, Apocyneae, Alyxieae) at
increasing phylogenetic distance from Asclepias [58]
were selected for primer testing. Pairs of species from
three tribes were used: Telosma cordata and Marsdenia
glabra (Marsdenieae), Baissea multiflora and Oncinotis
tenuiloba (Baisseeae), Epigynum auritum and E.

Multiple primer sets were designed for loci where multiple read hits allowed potential amplification of different introns. Primer set names correspond to the
orthologs of these genes in Arabidopsis. Listed annealing temperatures were used in amplifications of Asclepias samples. An annealing temperature of 55°C was
used for all loci for amplifications of other Apocynaceae samples.

cochinchinense (Apocyneae); Oncinotis glabrata was substituted for O. tenuiloba for six of the primer pairs. In
addition, the even more distantly related Alyxia oblongata and, for six of the primer pairs, Al. grandis (Alyxieae) were tested. DNA was extracted using a modified
DNeasy method [58]. PCR reactions were performed in
30 μl reaction volume with Apex™ Taq DNA Polymerase Master Mix (Genesee Scientific) diluted to 1× with
final concentrations of 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM forward and reverse primers (Table 3). One μl of unquantified DNA extract was added to each reaction. PCR was
performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient

thermocycler with an initial melting step of 94°C for 3
min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1
min, 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension of 72°C for 7
min. PCR products were examined for amplification
success and product sizes estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis for both the Asclepias-specific and familywide surveys.

nuclear genome size of approximately 820 Mbp. Estimated 2C genome sizes in Apocynaceae range from 0.74
pg in Voacanga grandifolia to 5.00 pg in tetraploid Ceropegia woodii [59], and correspond to haploid nuclear
genome sizes of approximately 360 - 2,445 Mbp.
Among the ca. 3,000 species of Asclepiadoideae [60],
which include C. woodii, other 2C values for diploids
are all greater than 4.30 pg [59]. The genome of Asclepias is on the small side for the family based on current
knowledge, but a comparison is difficult to make due to
the limited sampling of genome size diversity in
Apocynaceae.
Illumina sequencing and quality filtering

Of the 10,512,738 reads obtained, a total of 9,651,427
short reads passed the first step of quality filtering yielding 386 Mbp of sequence. The raw reads were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive
(SRP005621). Trimming reads of nucleotides with a “B”
quality score and subsequent bases resulted in retention
of 99.06% of the quality-filtered data. Reads yielding no
data due to all unscorable bases accounted for 0.20% of
this read pool. Of the reads obtained, approximately
11.8%, 3.4%, and 1.8% originated from the chloroplast
genome, mitochondrial genome, and rDNA repeat
arrays respectively. Based on the estimated genome
sizes, approximately 0.5× coverage, on average, of the
whole A. syriaca genome (including organellar genomes)
and 0.4× coverage of the nuclear genome were obtained
from one lane of Illumina reads.
Characterization of the organellar genomes of Asclepias
syriaca
The Chloroplast Genome

The chloroplast genome of A. syriaca is 158,598 bp
[GenBank:JF433943], excluding two small, unresolved
regions that were not able to be assembled or Sanger
sequenced due to polynucleotide stretches (rps8-rpl14
intergenic spacer and ψycf1), and has an inverted repeat
(IR) of 25,401 bp (Figure 1). The initial assembly produced using the alignreads pipeline and the oleander
reference contained 51 contigs with a median read
depth of 246× and N50 of 4,683 bp. The longest contig
was 14,884 bp. The final assembly using the finished A.
syriaca sequence as a reference contained 22 contigs,
had an N50 of 9,030 bp, and longest contig of 28,186
bp. The use of chloroplast contigs from 80 bp reads
from other A. syriaca individuals (S. Straub and A. Liston, unpublished data) in combination with Sanger
sequencing of select regions in the 0.5× genome individual and these other individuals, resulted in the addition
of 6,622 bp and deletion of 1,402 bp of sequence. That
large insertions and deletions were found relative to the
original assembly was expected due to the limited power

Page 10 of 22

of reference guided assembly algorithms to reconstruct
these differences. Only 38 bp of sequence from the original reference guided assembly were determined to be
incorrect, producing substitution errors in the genome
sequence. The sum total of these changes resulted in
the alteration of approximately 5% of the total sequence
length, indicating that 95% of the chloroplast genome of
A. syriaca was assembled at 0.5× average genome coverage with reads of only 40 bp and an oleander reference
with 85% sequence identity (considering only one copy
of the inverted repeat). Although the original assembly
was very good overall, comparison of the final assembly
with the finished reference sequence highlighted the
limitations of using 40 bp vs. 80 bp reads for sequence
assembly. Even with a correct reference sequence, some
regions were still not assembled properly (e.g., accD,
ycf1) and some assembly mistakes from the original
assembly were recreated (e.g., an erroneous 5 bp deletion in the middle of rbcL causing a frameshift).
In terms of overall size and IR size, A. syriaca has a
typical asterid chloroplast genome [61]. The gene content of the A. syriaca chloroplast genome is similar to
those of oleander and coffee (Coffea arabica) [62],
with 110 unique genes (76 protein coding, 30 tRNA, 4
rRNA). Seventeen of these are fully duplicated in the
IR for a total of 127 putatively functional genes. The
most notable difference between the milkweed genome
and the oleander and coffee chloroplast genomes is
that clpP, accD, and ycf1 are likely pseudogenes in
Asclepias. Another difference in the Asclepias genome
relative to the other two genomes is shifting of the
boundary of the IR in A. syriaca such that the truncated version of rps19 observed in oleander and coffee
is not present in IRa of milkweed. Assessment of smaller repeats showed that the A. syriaca chloroplast genome contains few repeats (Table 5). In comparison, the
coffee chloroplast genome has nearly three times as
many repeats of 30 or more basepairs with 90% or
greater sequence identity [62].
The A. syriaca ψclpP has several features that indicate
that it is likely a pseudogene. The nucleotide and protein sequences are divergent from those of oleander
(81.3% exon nucleotide and 67.0% protein sequence
identity) and coffee (80.8% exon nucleotide and 67.5%
protein sequence identity). In comparison, oleander and
coffee have 97.2% exon nucleotide and 98.9% protein
sequence identity. There is also a 28 bp insertion near
the end of exon 3 of A. syriaca (validated by Sanger
sequencing) that causes a frame shift and the introduction of a stop codon. Sequence comparisons showed
that clpP in oleander and coffee are likely under negative selection (Ka/Ks = 0.07 and 0.03 respectively); however, the Ka/Ks for Asclepias is 1.15 indicating that this
locus is likely evolving neutrally. While the clpP introns

Repeats of at least 30 bp and at least 85% sequence identity to each copy are

have been lost multiple times in angiosperms [e.g.,
[63-65,67,68]], the coding region has been lost much
less often. Other examples of loss of the coding region
are only known from Scaevola (Goodeniaceae), Passiflora (Passifloraceae), Trachelium (Campanulaceae), Geranium and Monsonia (Geraniaceae) [67-69].
The accD gene of A. syriaca is also likely a pseudogene. This gene is 2,584 bp in A. syriaca compared to
1,497 bp in oleander. There is a repeat-rich (Table 5),
approximately 1 kb insertion in the middle of the gene.
Although the insertion does not interrupt the reading
frame, the remainder of the sequence that is alignable
with oleander is highly divergent. This gene can be
highly variable, even within a genus [66], but due to the
extent of sequence divergence, and lengths of the insertion and repeat motifs, this gene is likely non-functional
in Asclepias. However, in pepper, a smaller, repeat-containing insertion of 144 bp in accD does not cause a frameshift nor prevent transcription of the gene [70].
There are numerous other examples of loss of
accD from the plastome among angiosperms [e.g.,
[64,65,67-69,71]].
The assembly of ψaccD proved especially challenging
for Asclepias due to sequence divergence and the large
insertion relative to the oleander reference. De novo
assembly of 80 bp reads from another A. syriaca individual and Sanger sequencing confirmed the correct
sequence. Further inspection indicated that the assembly
errors in this region arose due to the presence of an
accD pseudogene in the mitochondrial genome of A.
syriaca, also confirmed by Sanger sequencing, which
was more similar in sequence and length to the oleander
chloroplast accD. A similar problem involving accD and
a mitochondrial genome sequence was encountered in
the assembly of the pepper plastome [70]. Problems of
this sort are likely to arise for assembly of chloroplast
genomes, especially with short reads, for regions of the
genome that have been duplicated in the mitochondrial
or nuclear genomes [72].
A third possible pseudogene in the A. syriaca chloroplast genome is ψycf1. This gene contains one of the
two polynucleotide repeats of unresolved length in the

genome and has a highly divergent sequence compared
to oleander and coffee. The sequence of this gene was
also checked and improved using de novo contigs and
Sanger sequencing to eliminate the possibility of assembly errors as a cause of sequence divergence. Although
ycf1 is one of the most quickly evolving chloroplast
genes in seed plants [e.g., [66,73,74]], the full length
copy of ycf1 in Asclepias is so divergent that it may be
non-functional. The sequence identity between ycf1 in
oleander and coffee is 87.5%, whereas the sequence
identities between each of those species and Asclepias
are only 79.4% and 72.2% respectively. In addition to
decreased sequence identity, there were 62 and 61 indels
inferred from alignments of the Asclepias ycf1 sequence
with the oleander and coffee sequences respectively,
whereas there were only 16 indels inferred from an
alignment of oleander and coffee. Among angiosperms
ycf1 has also been lost multiple times [e.g.,
[65,67-69,71]].
All three of the putative pseudogenes detected in the
A. syriaca plastome, ψclpP, ψaccD, and ψycf1 have functions that are known to be essential for plant development and survival [75-77]. Additional studies to evaluate
the functionality of these putative pseudogenes will be
needed to confirm their designation as such, in combination with further analysis of the nuclear genome to
locate functional copies of these indispensible genes or
determine which other nuclear genes might encode a
functional replacement as in, for example, the case of
accD in grasses [e.g., [78,79]].
The Mitochondrial Genome

A total of 130,764 bp of the A. syriaca mitochondrial
genome was assembled in 115 contigs with a median
read depth of 32× and N50 of 1,666 bp. See additional
file 4: Asclepias syriaca mitochondrial genome contigs
(also accessible at http://milkweedgenome.org). The
longest contig was 6,948 bp. The extent to which the
portion of the genome assembled for A. syriaca represents the whole mitochondrial genome is unknown due
to the extensive variation observed for genome size,
gene content, and organization among angiosperms
[43,80,81]. Divergence from the organization of the
Nicotiana reference likely prevented a more complete
and contiguous assembly. Complete (rrn5) or nearly
complete (rrn26, rrn18) ribosomal DNA sequences were
identified among the contigs. Twenty-eight putative
tRNA sequences representing 25 different tRNAs were
also identified. Absence of a complete complement of
tRNAs was not unexpected because the number of
tRNAs in plant mitochondrial genomes is variable due
to the replacement of native mitochondrial tRNAs with
versions of chloroplast origin or import of nuclear
encoded tRNAs of chloroplast or nuclear origin [80,81].
For example, among the tRNAs in the A. syriaca

Straub et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/211

mitochondrial genome, both a mitochondrial version
and a chloroplast version of trnE-TTC were detected.
The protein coding gene content observed for A. syriaca was compared to that of the mitochondrial genome
of Nicotiana tabacum because it is the only other asterid
with a sequenced mitochondrial genome. The assembled
part of the genome contained the same 37 protein coding
genes of known function as the N. tabacum mitochondrial genome with an average coverage of 94.8%. Putative
pseudogenes of rps2, rps7, and rps14 were identified in
the A. syriaca mitochondrial genome contigs. Both the
mitochondrial genome of N. tabacum and A. syriaca
appear to lack functional copies of these three genes, in
addition to lacking rpl6, rps8, and rps11, the genes lost in
all angiosperms, but present in Marchantia [42]. Evidence of ψrps14 is present in tobacco, but there is no
remaining evidence of the other two genes. Due to the
pseudogenization or absence of these genes in the N.
tabacum reference used for the A. syriaca assembly, a
more complete characterization of the mitochondrial
genome based on additional data will be required to
determine if these genes are truly non-functional in A.
syriaca or if their absence is an assembly artifact.
Extensive horizontal gene transfer has been hypothesized for the group I intron present in the cox1 gene of
angiosperm mitochondrial genomes, with six horizontal
transfer events hypothesized in Apocynaceae alone [82].
Alternatively, it has been argued that the distribution of
the cox1 intron in plants more likely involved a single
horizontal transfer followed by intron loss in many
lineages [83]. All but one of the Apocynaceae genera
sampled have contained the cox1 intron [82,83], and it
was also found to be present in the assembled cox1
gene of A. syriaca. This result adds to the evidence supporting the intron loss hypothesis over horizontal gene
transfer in Apocynaceae.
Characterization of the nuclear genome of Asclepias
syriaca

The Velvet de novo assembly using a hash length of 21
resulted in 1,399,320 bp of sequence in 6,997 contigs,
79% of which were 200 bp or less. See additional file 5:
Asclepias syriaca nuclear genome de novo assembly contigs (also accessible at http://milkweedgenome.org). The
longest contig was 5,027 bp and the N50 for the assembly was 196.
Repetitive Element Characterization

A total of 564 repetitive elements were detected in the
A. syriaca de novo contigs (Figure 2). The majority of
these repeats were Ty1/copia-like and Ty3/gypsy-like
LTR retrotransposons (Figure 2), which are abundant in
plants and common across eukaryotes [84-86]. Only the
most highly represented repeats in the genome would
have high enough coverage at 0.4× total nuclear genome

coverage to be assembled, so it is not surprising that the
majority of the repeats were Ty1/copia-like and Ty3/
gypsy-like retrotransposons. In plant species where retrotransposons have been characterized, it appears to be
lineage specific whether Ty1/copia-like or Ty3/gypsy-like
retroelements are more abundant in the genome, likely
because retrotransposons can proliferate or be lost from
genomes over relatively short evolutionary time scales
[85,87]. Among other asterids, Ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons are more prevalent in the sunflower (Helianthus
annuus), tomato, and potato genomes, while in carrot
(Daucus carota), as in A. syriaca, Ty1/copia-like retrotransposons are more numerous [88-90].
The numbers of retroelements reported here are certain to be different than the actual numbers of retroelements in the sampled A. syriaca genome because the de
novo contigs were relatively short compared to the
length of retrotransposons, possibly resulting in different
regions of the same retroelement being counted multiple times. Additionally, six contigs had more than one
good repeat type match, slightly inflating the numbers
discovered. Only approximately 2% of the putatively
nuclear reads had hits to the repeat-containing contigs.
The estimate of raw reads with hits to the plant repeat
database did not give a better estimate of the total
repeat content of the A. syriaca genome than the hits to
assembled repeats with only 0.24% of reads with one or
more hits. These results indicate that at 0.4× genome
coverage, only an initial characterization of the most
common repeats present in a plant genome can be
made, while an estimation of the overall repeat content
of the genome requires deeper coverage.
Microsatellite repeats were also detected among the
2,624 de novo contigs of at least 150 bp, with a total of
395 microsatellite sequences found in 333 of these contigs (Table 6). Top ten BLAST hits with an E-value of

Amplification success of the 25 markers with the highest numbers of repeat units is indicated (see Table 2).

1e-5 or lower were recovered for 53 and three contigs
for mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences respectively. The higher number of possible mitochondrial
reads remaining in the read pool following removal of
reads putatively belonging to the organellar genomes
reflects our more limited knowledge of the mitochondrial genome in plants in general and incomplete assembly of the A. syriaca mitochondrial genome. An
alternative explanation for the presence of these small
segments of DNA of mitochondrial or chloroplast origin
in putatively nuclear contigs is that they correspond to
nuclear nomads [72].
To be conservative in selecting 25 candidates for testing, loci from the 56 contigs with putatively mitochondrial or chloroplast sequence were removed from the
pool of candidates, leaving 209 primer sets for putatively
nuclear microsatellite loci. See additional file 2: Primer
sets designed using BatchPrimer3 for 184 nuclear microsatellite loci in Asclepias syriaca not tested for amplification success. Of the 25 primer sets tested, all
successfully amplified in A. syriaca (Table 6). It is
important to note that with the low overall genome coverage, at least some of these microsatellite-containing
contigs are likely to have originated from multiple,
nearly-identical paralogous loci. As is the case with all
microsatellites, the ultimate proof in the utility of these
markers for identifying intraspecific variation (e.g., linkage mapping or population genetics) will come from
obeying a Mendelian locus/allele model that meets

expected transmission ratios (in the case of known pedigrees) or Hardy-Weinberg expectations (in the case of
wild populations). If the markers show evidence of fixed
heterozygosity or dominant-only variation, this would
constitute evidence that our microsatellite ‘contigs’ are
the product of microreads representing two or more
paralogs. These loci are currently being examined in
greater detail to determine their locus specificity.
The source of the rDNA repeats identified by RepeatMasker in the de novo contigs (Figure 2) that remained
after the removal of A. syriaca rDNA microreads was
also explored. BLAST searches (blastn) of the NCBI
nucleotide collection revealed that their source was likely
plant fungal pathogens or endophytes. For example, the
top BLAST hits for two of theses contigs were to an
Alternaria alternata gene for large subunit (LSU) rRNA
(1e-105) [GenBank:AB566324.1] and a Davidiella tassiana
partial LSU rRNA gene sequence (1e -92 ) [GenBank:
FN868880.1]. Approximately 0.02% of the total reads
could be categorized as fungal rDNA when the sequences
for the top GenBank hits were used as a BLAT database.
Detection of fungal contaminants of a plant genomic
DNA preparation is unsurprising due to the ubiquitous
association of these two types of organisms.

spacer (ETS) and intergenic spacer (IGS) regions of the
rDNA cistron prevented further extension of that contig
and produced an error in the assembly where reads corresponding to similar repeats were incorrectly piled up,
highlighting one of the primary difficulties of genome
assembly using short reads [32,91]. Consequently, the
first 280 bp of the contig sequence were removed prior
to downstream analyses. The median read depth for the
final assemblies were 406× for 5S and 738× for the 18S5.8S-26S cistron. Using the median read depth as an
estimate of the number of rDNA copies sequenced and
the nuclear genome coverage of approximately 0.4×,
rough approximations of the number of 5S rDNA
repeats and of rDNA cistron copies are 1,015 and 1,845
respectively. These estimates are in line with values
observed for other plants [92,93].
Fully characterized rDNA cistrons in plants have at
least one TATA box upstream of 18S, which demarcates
the boundary between the ETS region and the repeatrich non-transcribed spacer [94,95]. However, repeat
units may also appear between the transcription initiation site (TIS) and 18S [96]. The conserved plant TIS

sequence was not observed in the A. syriaca sequence
upstream of 18S, so the entire ETS region was not
assembled due to internal repeated sequence. However,
another ETS motif conserved in plants and always
located approximately 420 - 450 bp upstream of the
start of 18S [TGAGTGGTGG; [97]] was located 423 bp
upstream of 18S in the sequenced portion of ETS. Due
to the length variation in the ETS regions in other asterids (Solanum ~1000 bp; Nicotiana >3000 bp in N. tabacum; Olea ~2000 bp), it is difficult to estimate the
completeness of our assembly for this region and the
cistron as a whole, which is between 9 and 12 kb in
Nicotiana [96,98,99].
For intragenomic rDNA polymorphism characterization, quality filtering by average quality (q = 20)
removed zero reads from the 5S pool, and 148 reads
from the 18S-5.8S-26S cistron pool (0.1%). Masking the
remaining nucleotides with qualities below 20 affected
1.7% and 6.2% of nucleotides in the two pools, respectively. A high percentage of positions in the 5S locus
were polymorphic (Figure 4). Most of these positions
had less than 8% of reads differing from the consensus,

Protein Coding Nuclear Genes

From 19,899 Catharanthus ESTs, 9,266 unigenes were
created. Of these, 72 corresponded to chloroplast, mitochondrial or rDNA genes and were removed from the
data set. Among the remaining repeat masked unigenes,
8,077 had between one and 138 unique microread hits.
The median number of hits per kilobase of sequence
was 7.17 (95% CI 7.03 - 7.29). The median coverage of
the unigenes was 0.29× (95% CI 0.28× - 0.29×; Figure
5a). The 618 genes with coverage levels above 0.984×
were outliers. Many of these genes likely correspond to

though some ranged as high as 14%. Conversely, only 19
positions in the 18S-5.8S-26S cistron were polymorphic
(Figure 4). Polymorphisms were found in both coding
and spacer regions, although none were found in either
the 5.8S or ITS2 regions. While spacer regions contained a slightly higher proportion of polymorphic positions than coding regions, positions with the greatest
proportion of differing reads were found within coding
regions, in particular in the 26S region.
Levels of intra-genomic polymorphism among copies
of the rDNA loci generally agree with previously measured and theoretically expected levels. The high proportion of polymorphic positions in 5S is concordant with
previous observations for this locus; however, the levels
measured here are somewhat higher than those reported
in other plant and animal species [e.g., [100-102]]. Intragenomic polymorphism among copies of the rDNA cistron in this individual is comparable to rates found in
previous studies characterizing polymorphism within
Drosophila [103] and fungi [104]. While the 19 sites
found in this study are within the previously observed
range of variation, comparisons are difficult due to the
difference in copy number between these taxa (45-180 in
the fungi, 200-250 in Drosophila, approximately 1800 in
this study), differences in the definition of polymorphic
loci, and differences in sequencing technologies (wholegenome shotgun sequencing vs. Illumina).
The distribution of polymorphic positions matches
theoretical expectations, with a higher proportion of
positions found within spacer rather than coding
regions. The very high proportion of differing reads
found at two positions in the 26S region may be caused
by their location within expansion segments of this
region, expansion segments 9 and 8, respectively [105].
The lower levels of polymorphism observed for the 18S5.8S-26S cistron relative to the 5S rDNA loci are concordant with the molecular evolutionary processes associated with each rDNA type. While strong concerted
evolution and strong purifying selection act to homogenize the 18S-5.8S-26S cistron copies within and among
repeat arrays, weak concerted evolution and birth-anddeath processes for 5S rDNA allow accumulation of
polymorphism [100,106].

members of multigene families or other duplicated
genes, increasing the chances of non-orthologous BLAT
hits in conserved domains. For example, a unigene with
6.79× coverage had multiple BLAST hits (E = 0) to
eudicot H + -ATPases (P 3A -type). Within the P-type
ATPase gene super family, the P3A-type subfamily has
10 and 11 members in rice and Arabidopsis respectively
[107]. Based on the overall genome coverage and the
unigene coverage, the A. syriaca genome likely contains
a similar number of P3A-type ATPases.
Another explanation for the high coverage of outlier
loci was indicated by the masked unigene sequences
themselves. Many of the unigenes with the highest coverage still contained sequences that could produce multiple non-homologous hits (e.g., internal polynucleotide
stretches), which in turn produced stacks of reads. Read

Straub et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/211

overlap due to this phenomenon inflated the coverage
values, so many of the very high coverage values are
likely artifacts of the unigene creation and masking process. The presence of PCR duplicate reads in the data
set could also have caused read overlap and overestimation of coverage. Most of these reads should have been
excluded by counting only unique BLAT hits, but any
sequencing errors in the duplicates or length differences
due to differing sequence quality, especially at the ends
of the reads, could produce nearly identical hits.
Of the 1,086 COSII alignments 721 had between one
and 23 unique A. syriaca microread hits with a median
gene coverage of 0.14× (95% CI 0.13× - 0.15×; Figure
5b) and median hits per kilobase of sequence of 3.40
(95% CI 3.13 - 3.64). The 35 genes with greater than
0.473× coverage were outliers. There is a possibility that
some of these genes are single copy in other asterids,
but duplicated in Asclepias, leading to the higher coverage levels. More likely, as in the unigene analysis,
sequence features, including microsatellites that were
not masked in the COSII alignments, and PCR duplicates led to increased estimates of coverage. Of the five
genes with greater than 1× coverage, the only BLAT
hits for two were to microsatellites and a third had multiple microsatellite and a single other hit.
The median coverage values for the unigene and
COSII data sets would be expected to be close to the
estimate of 0.4× coverage for the nuclear genome. However, the observed values deviated from the expected
coverage. One explanation for this is that the overall
coverage of the A. syriaca genome was slightly overestimated due to the presence of PCR duplicates in the
read pool. It is also possible that the genome size of the
sequenced individual was larger than the genome sizes
estimated from the experimental population, again causing an overestimate of genome coverage. Divergence
from the reference sequences would also cause an
underestimate of coverage for A. syriaca orthologs. The
lower amount of divergence from Catharanthus, a
member of the same family, is reflected in the higher
estimated coverage for the unigenes than the COSII
alignments, which contained sequences of more distantly related asterids. The coverage value for the unigenes may also be higher due to the reasons discussed
above. Another feature of both reference data sets that
would cause an underestimate of coverage was the
absence of introns. The microread sequences from
genomic DNA would also represent these features of
the genes, but would not produce BLAT hits for these
genes. Reads spanning intron-exon boundaries would
also have been excluded in many cases due to the mismatch of the intron sequence with the following exon in
the unigenes and COSII alignments. Even with these
issues confounding coverage estimates, these two

Page 17 of 22

explorations of the nuclear gene content of the A. syriaca genome demonstrate that even at 0.4× genome
coverage, much of the protein coding portion of the
nuclear genome can be detected.
Even with low overall coverage of the 721 COSII
genes with A. syriaca microread hits, the alignments
were still useful for marker development for Asclepias
and Apocynaceae molecular phylogenetics. The 28 genes
that had 0.5× or greater coverage were evaluated for
their suitability for this purpose. Microreads flanked
putative intron locations in 15 genes of this set, allowing
primer design for amplification of one or more introns
per gene (Table 3).
Primer testing within Asclepias and across Apocynaceae was largely successful with single products amplifying in most tribes of Apocynaceae (Table 7).
Amplification of large introns and evidence of length
variation among groups are promising for utility of
these markers at different scales dependent upon overall
sequence divergence. These results highlight how even a
small amount of genomic data can facilitate and expedite the arduous process of nuclear marker development
across a range of taxonomic scales from within a genus
to across a family for groups of species not closely
related to a species with extensive genomic resources.

Conclusions
The often-employed strategy of transcriptome sequencing for exploration of the genomes of non-model
organisms can produce a wealth of information for comparative and functional genomics studies due to high
coverage of the gene space and provide the necessary
information for marker development, including single
nucleotide polymorphisms [3]. As an alternative, low
coverage whole genome sequencing provides a more
complete survey of the entire genome by providing substantial information about the organellar genomes and
the repeat content of the nuclear genome, while still
providing the necessary resources for marker development. In plants with no prior genomic information,
acquisition of even a small amount of genomic data
allows ready characterization of the high copy fraction
of the genome and exploration of the low copy fraction
of the genome. A complete, or nearly complete, chloroplast genome and rDNA cistron are readily obtained. A
partial to nearly complete mitochondrial genome can be
obtained, depending on the complexity of the particular
mitochondrial genome. Initial characterizations of the
repeat and protein coding portions of the nuclear genome can be made in terms of content and then used in
the development of molecular tools, including low-copy
nuclear genes and microsatellites, for the further study
of the target organism and its relatives.

The data obtained through this study are the first step
in the development of a community resource for further
study of plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator interactions, floral developmental genetics, chemical evolution,
population genetics, and comparative genomics using
milkweeds as ecological and evolutionary models. The
information obtained from this study is already serving
as a resource for development of markers to aid in the
study of phylogenetics, population genetics, phylogeography and other areas for Asclepias and Apocynaceae.
These results highlight the promise of genomic
resources for developing tools in any organism [2,108]
and show that even labs with limited resources can feasibly obtain 0.5× or greater coverage of the genome of
their species of interest and a wealth of information. By
incorporating 80-120 bp read lengths, paired-end
sequences, and ever-improving sequencing technology,
this level of coverage and assembly success from a single
lane of Illumina sequencing is attainable for all but the
very largest of plant genomes.
