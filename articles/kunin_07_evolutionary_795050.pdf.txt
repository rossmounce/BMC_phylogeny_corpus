Background: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are a novel
class of direct repeats, separated by unique spacer sequences of similar length, that are present in
approximately 40% of bacterial and most archaeal genomes analyzed to date. More than 40 gene
families, called CRISPR-associated sequences (CASs), appear in conjunction with these repeats and
are thought to be involved in the propagation and functioning of CRISPRs. It has been recently
shown that CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.

Background

Up to 45 gene families, called CRISPR-associated sequences
(CASs), appear in conjunction with these repeats and are
hypothesized to be responsible for CRISPR propagation and
functioning [2,5,6]. It has been proposed that CASs can be
divided into seven or eight subtypes, according to their
operon organization and gene phylogeny [5,6]. Phylogenetic
analysis additionally indicates that CASs have undergone
extensive horizontal gene transfer, as very similar CAS genes
are found in distantly related organisms [6,7]. CRISPRs and
CASs have been found on mobile genetic elements, such as

information

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPRs) are repetitive structures in Bacteria and Archaea
composed of exact repeat sequences 24 to 48 bases long
(herein called repeats) separated by unique spacers of similar
length (herein called spacers) [1,2]. The CRISPR sequences
appear to be among the most rapidly evolving elements in the
genome, to the point that closely related species and strains,
sometimes more than 99% identical at the DNA level, differ in
their CRISPR composition [3,4].

Conclusion: We show that the repeat-based classification corresponds to, and expands upon, a
previously reported CAS gene-based classification, including specific relationships between CRISPR
and CAS subtypes.

Results: Here we analyze CRISPR repeats identified in 195 microbial genomes and show that they
can be organized into multiple clusters based on sequence similarity. Some of the clusters present
stable, highly conserved RNA secondary structures, while others lack detectable structures. Stable
secondary structures exhibit multiple compensatory base changes in the stem region, indicating
evolutionary and functional conservation.

CRISPRs have been suggested to play roles in replicon partitioning [1], DNA repair [10], regulation [5] and chromosomal
rearrangement [11]. It was recently reported that the spacers
are often highly similar to fragments of extrachromosomal
DNA, such as phage or plasmid DNA [3,12]. It was suggested
that the CRISPR/CAS system participates in an antiviral
response, probably by an RNA interference-like mechanism.
The proposed mechanism for this CRISPR function involves
sampling and maintaining a record of invasive DNA elements, and inhibition of gene functions necessary for invasion [12]. Indeed, it was recently shown that CRISPRs provide
acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes [13].

Results

To obtain a set of CRISPR arrays we employed the PILER-CR
program [14] on 439 currently available bacterial and
archaeal genomes in IMG version 1.50 [15]. We found 561
arrays, ranging in size from 3 to 220 repeats, in 195 genomes
(44% of the genomes tested). These results are in agreement
with the results of Godde et al. [7], who found CRISPR arrays
in 40% of the genomes they tested. Overall, our set of
CRISPRs contained 561 repeat sequences (as repeats are generally identical within an array) and 13,372 spacers.
Repeats were first noticed to be palindromic by Mojica et al.
[16], a feature that was subsequently incorporated into the
acronym CRISPR [2]. We hypothesized that the palindromic
signature might be indicative of a functional RNA secondary
structure within the repeat. This hypothesis is supported by
the experimental demonstration that CRISPRs are transcribed and processed into non-messenger RNAs in several
Archaea [17], indicating that they are active through an RNA
intermediate.
To assess the possibility that CRISPR repeats form stable
RNA secondary structures, we used the RNAfold software
[18] (see Materials and methods) to predict the intramolecu-

Fraction of a cluster (percentage)

Despite in-depth analyses of CASs, the nature of the repeat
sequences has not been examined closely. This is presumably
because repeats, as short DNA sequences, have less comparative potential than protein-coding genes. Previous studies
have noted only that repeats are highly variable, and do not
appear to be similar between organisms [2,7]. However, we
show that repeats from diverse organisms can be grouped
into clusters based on sequence similarity, and that some
clusters have pronounced secondary structures with compensatory base changes. We further show that there is a clear correspondence between CAS subtypes and repeat clusters. Our
findings have important implications for CRISPR function
and diversity.

lar RNA structure for each of the repeats in our set. This software provides a bit-score that reflects the stability of each
secondary structure. We compared the stability of the predicted secondary structure of repeats and spacers to that of
similarly sized sequences selected randomly from bacterial
genomes (Figure 1a). We found that the folding-score distribution of repeats deviates from the scores for random
sequences, indicating a tendency of repeats to form stable
secondary structure.
The trimodal pattern of the RNA folding distribution for
CRISPR repeats (Figure 1a) suggests that they are not homogeneous, and that a large subset form stable secondary structures, in contrast to spacers and random sequences. To
identify repeat subtypes we first attempted to align each of
the 561 repeats in our set to all other repeats using the SmithWaterman algorithm [19]. The sequence similarity results
were then clustered using the MCL algorithm [20] (see Materials and methods). This procedure generated 33 clusters, 12
of which contained 10 or more members, with the largest

A summary of the repeat similarity space is presented in Figure 3. As with cluster 3 (Figure 2), repeats in other clusters
with high and intermediate folding scores also form stemloop structures (Figure 3) and display compensatory mutations, suggesting stable structures. While the stem-loop motif
is seen in all of these clusters, the actual sequence, as well as
the length of the stem, its position relative to the unstructured
region, and the size of the unstructured sequence varies
between clusters. For example, while the stem in cluster 4 is
typically 5 bp long and is found in the middle of the repeat, the
stem in cluster 3 is typically 7 bp long, and is found towards
the 5' end of the repeat (Figures 2 and 3). The difference in

reports

To further explore the observation that repeats form stable
RNA secondary structures, we examined sequence alignments of the repeat clusters. CRISPR repeats are generally
considered to be highly dissimilar to each other [7], except for
similar repeats in strains of the same species or in closely
related species [1]. However, repeats within the clusters we

generated, although often containing sequences from vastly
different phylogenetic groups, were generally more similar to
each other and hence alignable. Figure 2a presents a multiple
alignment of a subset of the repeats in cluster 3. A highly stable stem-loop structure was consistently predicted for repeats
in this cluster by RNAfold [18] (Figure 1b). Notably, substitutions in the predicted stem structure are consistently accompanied by compensatory changes that preserve the base
pairing (Figure 2a). This mutational pattern, together with
the presence of G:U base pairs (Figure 2a), is typical of conserved RNA secondary structures and highlights the importance of the stem-loop in the repeats for the functionality of
CRISPRs.

reviews

As an independent measure for the validity of the clustering,
we examined the RNA stability scores in each of the MCLdefined clusters (note that RNA stability was not taken into
account in the clustering procedure). As seen in Figure 1b,
clusters 2 and 3 comprise repeats with consistently high folding scores, indicating pronounced secondary structure. By
contrast, clusters 1, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 contain repeats with consistently poor folding scores. Clusters 4, 5, 8 and 12 show
intermediate folding scores, suggesting they have weaker secondary structures. Together, these groups explain the trimodal distribution observed in Figure 1a. The homogeneity of
RNA structure stability scores within each cluster, along with
the dramatic difference in scores between clusters, suggests
that our clustering method is valid.

clusters contained repeats from organisms as distantly
related as Archaea and Bacteria, supporting the inference that
CRISPR/CAS systems can be horizontally transferred
between microorganisms [5-7].

calculated folding scores between clusters with high and
intermediate scores is likely to be due to the stem length and
the frequency of GC as opposed to AT base pairings. Consistent with previous reports [7], many repeat clusters have a
conserved 3' terminus of GAAA(C/G), possibly acting as a
binding site for one of the conserved CAS proteins.

structures. This explains why previous attempts to align all
repeats resulted in a poorly defined consensus sequence [7].
We observed compensatory base changes in the stems of the
structured repeat clusters, including G:U base pairs,
indicating that the CRISPR system likely functions through
an RNA intermediate.

Two recent studies identified between 20 and 45 gene families of CASs [5,6]. Based on the tendency of CAS genes to
appear together, Haft et al. [5] defined eight CAS subtypes
(named Ecoli, Ypest, Nmeni, Dvulg, Tneap, Hmari, Apern
and Mtube). We sought to determine whether our CRISPR
repeat clusters corresponded to particular CAS subtypes. For
this, we searched 20 kb of sequence flanking each side of the
repeat array for CAS genes using the 45 CAS families
TIGRFAM hidden Markov models (HMMs) defined by Haft
et al. [5].

Some clusters, such as clusters 2, 3 and 4, are discrete in the
sequence similarity space, whereas the boundaries of others,
such as clusters 1, 6 and 7, were not clearly defined. The discrete clusters were generally composed of structure-forming
repeats, and the less well-defined clusters were composed of
unstructured repeats. This may be a reflection of the greater
evolutionary constraints on the stem structure.

We found that the Ecoli CAS subtype genes appear exclusively
in the proximity of structured repeat cluster 2, and, similarly,
the Dvulg and Ypest CAS subtypes correspond strictly to our
structured clusters 3 and 4, respectively (Table 1 and Table S1
in Additional data file 1). Presumably, specific and different
sets of genes are needed in order to recognize, bind and process the different repeat types. Despite the overall pronounced
correspondence between the CAS subtypes and repeat clusters, particularly for structured clusters, there are notable
exceptions. For example, the reported frequent co-occurrence
of the Mtube subtype with other CAS subtypes [5] is consistent with its promiscuous association with numerous repeat
clusters (Table 1). Another interesting exception is the cooccurrence of the Tneap and Apern subtypes in the Thermococcus kodakaraensis genome with cluster 6, which is apparently due to a fusion of the Tneap and Apern subtypes (Figure
S1 and Table S1 in Additional data file 1). This genome contains three CRISPR arrays, all with identical repeat sequences
classified as cluster 6 (Table S1 in Additional data file 1). In
some cases the CAS subtype for one or more repeat cluster
members differs from the consensus for that cluster (Table S1
in Additional data file 1), suggesting that the association
between CRISPR repeat subtypes and CAS subtypes is somewhat flexible.
We also identified a repeat cluster (cluster 5) that is not associated with any of the recognized CAS subtypes. We found
that it is associated with most of the core CASs (cas1-4 and
cas6), but lacks any of the additional type-defining genes.
Cluster 5 occurs exclusively in genomes that contain other
CRISPR repeat subtypes and it is possible that it employs at
least part of their CAS machinery.

Discussion

This study shows that CRISPR repeats are not structurally
homogeneous and can be divided into distinct types based on
sequence similarity and ability to form stable secondary

The inference of stem-loop formation within individual
CRISPR repeats is in contrast to the speculation that pairs of
repeats form duplexes, and are subsequently cleaved to
release spacers [6]. Such hypothesized duplexing would
unlikely require the ubiquitous presence of the less conserved
interior nucleotides, which would form a loop in the single
repeat folding model (Figure 2) and an unpaired bulge in the
duplex repeat folding model. A CRISPR array in Sulfolobus is
transcribed and processed into 60 nucleotide long non-messenger RNAs, a size consistent with a single repeat-spacer
unit [17,21], supporting the argument that transcribed spacers remain associated with their repeats. The repeats may
serve to mediate contact between the spacer-targeted foreign
RNA or DNA and CAS-encoded proteins. A stem-loop structure of some repeats may have evolved to facilitate recognition [22] by RNA-binding CAS-encoded proteins, although
unstructured Sulfolobus repeats (in cluster 7; Figure 3) have
been shown to bind via a sequence-specific interaction to a
genus-specific protein [23]. This may partly explain the
sequence conservation observed in unstructured repeats.
A previous report suggested that spacer regions contribute to
the formation of secondary structures in CRISPR arrays [6].
However, we could not detect a significant deviation of spacer
secondary structures from random sequences (Figure 1),
indicating that spacers are unlikely to be selected based on
their secondary structure. In fact, the spacers appear to have
slightly weaker structures than random sequences. This is
probably due to the AT richness of spacers (46% GC) relative
to average bacterial genomic sequences (53% GC), as AT base
pairs form less stable structures than GC pairs. The lower
spacer GC content is consistent with a proposed viral origin of
spacer sequences [3], as viruses are, on average, 7% lower in
GC content than bacteria.
Previous attempts to classify CRISPR/CAS systems were
based on CAS gene content and phylogeny (mostly of cas1)
[5,6]. We add a further dimension to this classification by
showing that the repeat sequence itself is also a classifying
feature. This can be advantageous in instances where CRISPR
arrays occur in the absence of CAS genes. For example, Ther-

present in one cluster (cluster 10) and absent in the other two.
The finding of a repeat cluster (cluster 5) that cannot be readily resolved by associated CAS genes (see Results) further
demonstrates the power of CRISPR-based classification.
The significant differences between CRISPR/CAS subtypes,
both in CRISPR repeat sequence and structure, and in CAS
gene content and phylogeny, raises the possibility that the
subtypes also differ functionally. Support for this hypothesis
could be the fact that frequently several CRISPR/CAS subtypes are found in the same genome and at least four functions have been hypothesized for these elements (host cell
defense [12], regulation [5], chromosomal segregation [1] and
rearrangement [11]). The study of CRISPRs is in its infancy,
and their mode and function is still highly speculative. Our
results provide another step toward a comprehensive understanding of these intriguing elements.

[28,29]. Folding scores for all repeats or individual repeat
clusters were divided into bins of 2 score units and plotted as
percentages. Random sequence strings with the same length
distribution as repeats were generated from the analyzed
genomes. The average GC contents were calculated for
archaeal, bacterial and viral genomes in the IMG database,
version 1.50, and the average GC content was calculated for
all spacers in all genomes.

CAS gene identification
The HMMs for CAS genes described in [5] were obtained
from the TIGRFAM database, version 6.0 [30]. To identify
CAS genes, all coding sequences within 20 kb of the identified
CRISPR arrays were searched with the CAS HMMs using
hmmpfam [31] with the thresholds of an e-value <0.001 and
a positive score.

Additional data files
Materials and methods
Identification of CRISPR arrays
All genome sequences available through the IMG database
version 1.50 [15] were analyzed for CRISPR arrays using the
PILER-CR program [14].

Delineation of repeat clusters
Pairwise similarities between repeats were calculated using
an in-house implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm [19]. The best scoring similarity from the two possible
repeat pair orientations, and only scores >7, were used for
further analysis. Clustering of pairwise similarities was performed using the MCL program with default parameters [20].
Multiple alignments were performed using MUSCLE [24],
and the alignments were manually curated, including
removal of outliers. Sequence logos for each cluster were generated using WebLogo [25]. The similarity space of repeats
was visualized using BioLayout (Java) [26]. The sequences of
the repeats, the assignments to clusters and the multiple
alignments are provided as Additional data file 1.

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this paper. Additional data file 1 contains several

Determining orientation of repeats

References

The PILER-CR program provides an arbitrary orientation for
the repeats. To determine the correct orientation, we compared each repeat to the ones found experimentally to be
transcribed into RNA [17,21], assuming that the transcribed
direction is the 'correct' direction. The direction most similar
to the transcribed repeats (using Waterman similarity scores
[19]) was selected as the correct one. We also used the
GAAA(C/G) signature at the end of some repeats in cases
where the Waterman similarity scores were ambiguous. It is
possible, therefore, that some repeats may be presented in the
wrong orientation.
