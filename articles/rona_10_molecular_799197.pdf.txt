Molecular evidence for the occurrence of a new
sibling species within the Anopheles (Kerteszia)
cruzii complex in south-east Brazil
Luísa DP Rona1, Carlos J Carvalho-Pinto2, Alexandre A Peixoto1*

Abstract
Background: Anopheles cruzii (Diptera: Culicidae) has long been known as a vector of human and simian malaria
parasites in southern and south-eastern Brazil. Previous studies have provided evidence that An. cruzii is a species
complex, but the status of the different populations and the number of sibling species remains unclear. A recent
analysis of the genetic differentiation of the timeless gene among An. cruzii populations from south and south-east
Brazil has suggested that the population from Itatiaia, Rio de Janeiro State (south-east Brazil), is in a process of
incipient speciation.
Methods: A ~180 bp fragment of cpr, a gene encoding the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, an enzyme
involved in metabolic insecticide resistance and odorant clearance in insects, was used in this study as a molecular
marker to analyse the divergence between five An. cruzii populations from south and south-east Brazil.
Results: Analysis of the genetic differentiation in the cpr gene revealed very high FST values and fixed differences
between Itatiaia and the other four populations studied (Florianópolis, Cananéia, Juquitiba and Santa Teresa). In
addition, the data also provided preliminary evidence that seems to indicate the occurrence of two sympatric
sibling species in Itatiaia.
Conclusions: Population genetics analysis of An. cruzii samples from different localities using a fragment of the cpr
gene suggests that the Itatiaia sample represents at least one new sibling species in this complex.

Background
Anopheles cruzii has long been known as a vector of
human and simian malaria parasites in southern and
south-eastern Brazil [1,2]. This species, which belongs to
the subgenus Kerteszia, is found from the coast of Rio
Grande do Sul State in southern Brazil to Sergipe State
in north-eastern Brazil [3,4], all along the Brazilian
Atlantic forest. This forest provides an excellent environment for An. cruzii, since it is an ecosystem abundant
in bromeliads, the larval habitat for this anopheline
[2,5,6].
The possibility that An. cruzii could represent more
than a single species was first supported by morphological differences observed among populations from the
states of Santa Catarina and Rio de Janeiro [3]. Later it

was revealed that An. cruzii is polymorphic for chromosome rearrangements [7,8]. Differences in inversion frequencies and X chromosome banding patterns from
populations in south-eastern and southern Brazil have
suggested a process of incipient speciation [9,10]. Malafronte et al [11] compared sequences of ITS2 (Internal
Spacer Region 2) from several An. cruzii populations
from south and south-east Brazil and found differences
between sequences from different localities, although
they considered premature to conclude based on their
results that there are distinct sibling species in the areas
investigated. Similar results were observed by Calado et
al [12], using PCR-RAPD and PCR-RFLP of the ITS2
region.
Finally, isoenzyme analysis indicated two genetically
isolated groups, one from Bahia State (north-eastern
Brazil), and the other from south-eastern and southern
Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Santa Catarina
States) [13]. Supporting the isoenzyme results, analysis

of the molecular polymorphism and genetic differentiation of the timeless gene among Brazilian populations of
An. cruzii also indicated two cryptic species, one occurring in the north-east (Bahia State) and another in south
and south-east Brazil (Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro,
São Paulo and Santa Catarina States). In addition, the
timeless gene sequences also suggested that populations
from the south and south-east regions might also constitute different incipient species within this complex in
Brazil [14]. Since previous X chromosome analyses suggested the existence of sibling species in these Brazilian
regions [9,10], it would be interesting to analyse the
same populations with an X-linked molecular marker to
see whether a higher level of differentiation is found.
The gene encoding the NADPH-cytochrome P450
reductase (CPR) has been cloned from several insect
species [15-17]. In Anopheles gambiae, this protein is
encoded by a single copy gene located on the X chromosome [17,18]. Previous studies have shown that the
cytochrome P450 gene family, which is involved in
metabolic insecticide resistance, requires CPR to function [19,20]. Additionally, knockdown of CPR expression
increases An. gambiae sensitivity to the insecticide permethrin [21]. Another putative function associated with
CPR in insects is odorant clearance, since the cpr gene
is highly expressed in the antennae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and more specifically at the base
of olfactory sensilla in the moth Mamestra brassicae
[16,22]. Olfactory cues are important environmental stimuli affecting mosquito behaviour, playing significant
roles in the location of food sources, mates and oviposition sites [23]. Therefore, genes involved in the regulation of antennal response to pheromones can be
potentially important in maintaining sexual isolation
between closely related species, and in this case, the
CPR would be an interesting molecular marker for
population studies of the An. cruzii complex.
In this study, an analysis of intraspecific variability and
genetic divergence among five Brazilian populations of
An. cruzii was carried out using a fragment of the cpr
gene.

Methods
The mosquitoes used in this study were females captured
at different localities along the Brazilian Atlantic forest
and identified on the basis of their morphology according
to Consoli and Lourenço-de-Oliveira [4]. A total of 56
individuals were used for the molecular analysis: 14 from
Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State (SC) (27°31’S/48°
30’W), 12 from Cananéia, São Paulo State (SP) (25°01’S/
47°55’W), 12 from Juquitiba, São Paulo State (SP) (23°
57’S/47°03’W), 11 from Itatiaia, Rio de Janeiro State (RJ)
(22°27’S/44°36’W) and 7 from Santa Teresa, Espírito
Santo State (ES) (19°56’S/40°35’W) (Figure 1).

For the isolation of a fragment of the An. cruzii cpr
gene, initially a pair of degenerated primers was
designed based on conserved regions of the CPR proteins from Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Musca domestica, Aedes aegypti and An.
gambiae (Table 1 and Additional file 1). These primers,
named here 5’Cpr01deg and 3’Cpr01deg, were used in
PCR with An. cruzii genomic DNA extracted according
to Jowett [24]. PCR was carried out with an Eppendorf
Mastercycler® thermocycler using the following conditions: 15 cycles at 94°C for 60 s, 50°C (decreasing 1°C/
cycle) for 90 s and 72°C for 60 s, followed by 20 cycles
of 94°C for 60 s, 50°C for 90 s and 72°C for 60 s. PCR
products were then purified and cloned using Zero
Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen).
Sequencing of positive clones was carried out in an ABI
Prism 3730 DNA sequencer (PDTIS-FIOCRUZ DNA
sequencing facility) using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied
Biosystems). The identity of the cloned fragments was
confirmed by BlastX analysis using the GenBank [25].
Based on these initial sequences, two new specific primers named 5’cpr01ancruzii and 3’cpr01ancruzii (Table
1 and Additional file 1) were designed to amplify a ~180
bp fragment of the An. cruzii cpr gene from individual
mosquitoes of the different localities listed above. This
short fragment includes an intron of variable size (see
below) and two small segments of the flanking exons
(Additional file 1). PCR amplification using the specific
primers was carried out for 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s,
50°C for 60 s and 72°C for 90 s using the proofreading
Pfu DNA polymerase (Biotools). PCR fragments were
cloned using either Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit
(Invitrogen) or pMOS Blue vector blunt-ended cloning
kit (GE Healthcare) and at least eight clones of each
mosquito were sequenced.
Sequences were edited and in most cases consensus
sequences representing the two alleles were generated. In
a number of individuals only one haplotype was observed
among the eight sequences and in these cases the mosquitoes were classified as homozygotes. The probability
of incorrectly classifying a heterozygote as a homozygote
individual with this procedure is less than 1%. Eight
homozygotes were found in Florianópolis, four in Cananéia, seven in Juquitiba, three in Itatiaia and two in Santa
Teresa. The sequences from homozygote mosquitoes
were duplicated prior to analysis. However, the analysis
was also carried out without duplicating the homozygote
sequences with similar results.
The cpr sequences were aligned using ClustalX software [26] and the population genetics analysis was carried out using DNASP4.0 [27], PROSEQv 2.91 [28] and
Arlequin 3.0 [29] softwares. The haplotype network was
estimated using TCS1.21 [30].

sites in shown in Figure 2 (an alignment of the whole
sequences is presented in Additional file 2). The small
segments of the flanking exons in this cpr fragment are
totally conserved among the five populations analysed.
Therefore, all base substitutions occurred in the intron
which also shows a number of indels, including three
polymorphic dinucleotide repetitions (Figure 2 and
Additional file 2). Table 2 shows the number of copies
of each dinucleotide repeat in all An. cruzii populations.
In Itatiaia only one repeat of CG dinucleotide was
found, while in the other four populations there are two
or three repeats. Similar pattern was observed for the
CT repeat which shows four copies in Itatiaia while
there are six to nine in the other populations (Table 2).
Table 3 shows the pair-wise estimates of population differentiation between the An. cruzii populations. Because
this cpr fragment contains a number of indels, the FST
values were calculated in two different ways. In the first

one (FST (1)) the gaps were treated as single mutations in
the analysis performed with the PROSEQv 2.91 software.
In the second one (FST(2)), the Arlequin 3.0 software was
used to calculate the differentiation values considering
the three types of dinucleotide repeats as microsatellite
loci. In all cases the FST values were significant and the
two types of estimates showed similar results in most
cases. Very high FST values (ranging from ~0.6 to 0.8)
were found between Itatiaia and the other populations.
Albeit significant, the pair-wise FST values in the comparisons among the samples of Florianópolis, Cananéia
and Santa Teresa are usually under 0.2, while those
between Juquitiba and the other three populations are
moderately high.
Table 3 also shows the average number of nucleotide
substitutions per site (Dxy), the number of net nucleotide substitutions per site between populations (Da) and
the distribution of the four mutually exclusive categories
of segregating sites observed in each comparison: the
number of exclusive polymorphisms for each population
(S1 and S2), the number of shared polymorphisms (Ss)
and the number of fixed differences (Sf). As in the case
of the F ST , the highest D xy and D a values are those
involving the Itatiaia population. In addition, this sample
shows few shared polymorphisms and it is the only one
presenting fixed differences in comparisons with the
other populations.
Genealogy of the An. cruzii cpr sequences

A network of genealogical relationships of An. cruzii
haplotypes was estimated using the method of Templeton et al [31] available in the TCS programme (Figure
3). Gaps were treated as a 5th state. A network was also
estimated ignoring the gaps, but in this case much of
the divergence among the sequences was lost and the
network was not informative. The haplotype network
shows that the Itatiaia population is clearly separated in
an isolated group. A less clear separation was found
among the sequences of the other populations.

Inspection of the cpr sequences presented in Figure 2
and Additional file 2 suggests that the Itatiaia sample
might include two different sets of individuals. Based on
the number of uninterrupted AG repeats between positions 32 to 49 (Figure 2) the Itatiaia population was
divided in two groups: the first one, called henceforth
Itatiaia A, has more than three AG repeats (04 to 06
repeats) and the second, called henceforth Itatiaia B, has
exactly three AG repeats (Table 2). According to this
classification the individuals Ita2, Ita3, Ita4, Ita8, Ita10
and Ita11 belong to Itatiaia A (genotype “4-6/4-6”), the
mosquitoes Ita5, Ita6, Ita7 and Ita9 belong to Itatiaia B
(genotype “3/3”) and individual Ita12 is the only
“hybrid” between the two groups (genotype “3/4-6”).
Therefore, the Itatiaia sample is not in Hardy-Weinberg

Location of each type of dinucleotide repeat (see Additional file 2): CG repeats at positions 22 to 27, uninterrupted AG repeats (excluding flanking repeats with

equilibrium (X2 = 7.24; d.f. = 1; P < 0.01) suggesting the
possibility that two sympatric sibling species might exist
in this locality. The separation between the two groups
is also evident in Figure 3. Besides, the FST value (considering gaps as single mutations) between Itatiaia A
and B is quite large (0.6678) and highly significant (P <
0.001) despite the small sample sizes.
Finally, to test the hypothesis that the Itatiaia population might include two different sympatric sibling species, the recently published timeless data [14] from the
same sample were reanalysed. As for the cpr data, the
timeless sequences were divided into Itatiaia A (Ita2,
Ita3, Ita4, Ita8, Ita10 and Ita11) and Itatiaia B (Ita5, Ita6,
Ita7 and Ita9). The timeless gene also suggests that the

sequences might belong to two different sibling species
with a FST value (0.3418) that is highly significant (P <
0.001) and the occurrence of two fixed differences.
There is also a clear separation between the Itatiaia A
and B timeless sequences in a haplotype network (Additional file 3).

Discussion
The X chromosome seems to be enriched in genes that
cause reproductive isolation between species in the
genus Drosophila [32]. In addition, many sibling species
including the An. gambiae complex are outcomes of
recent speciation processes associated with paracentric
inversions involving this chromosome [33]. The X

chromosome banding patterns and inversion frequencies
studies of Brazilian south and south-east An. cruzii
populations, showed three X chromosomal forms (A, B
and C), suggesting a process of incipient speciation
[9,10]. The authors observed that the majority of mosquitoes from Juquitiba population had form A, while
form B predominated in Cananéia [9,10]. In the current
study, although there are no fixed differences in the cpr
gene between Juquitiba and Cananéia, a moderately high
FST value was observed. In An. gambiae, cpr is located
on the X chromosome. Therefore, if this molecular marker has a similar chromosomal location in An. cruzii, it
might be associated with the chromosomal forms
described by Ramirez & Dessen [9,10].
Comparisons of the FST values observed with cpr and
timeless in all pair-wise comparisons involving the five
populations analysed in the current study and in Rona
et al [14] show only a partial consistence but this is
expected. Wang-Sattler et al [34] demonstrated that the
phylogenetic relationships in the An. gambiae complex
could vary widely between different genomic regions,
thus indicating the mosaic nature of the genome of
these species [34].
As mentioned above the cpr gene in An. gambiae is Xlinked, while timeless is autosomal. Assuming these two
markers have similar locations in An. cruzii, cpr is
expected to be under more efficient selection than the
timeless, since in species with X/Y sex determination, as
An. cruzii, rare recessive mutations are fully expressed in
the heterogametic sex, which could lead to ‘faster-X evolution’ if a large proportion of mutations are fixed by
positive selection [35]. If positive selection is more efficient on the X chromosome, one expects it to harbour
less variability than the autosomes [36]. The X chromosome is indeed less variable than the autosomes in nonAfrican populations of Drosophila simulans [37]. Comparing timeless and cpr, the first is more polymorphic
than the latter, but the latter shows higher differentiation
among the southern populations of An. cruzii.
Since An. cruzii is polymorphic for chromosomal inversions and Ramirez & Dessem [9,10] found evidence for
sibling species carrying different X chromosomal forms,
another hypothesis that might explain the differences
between the two markers is the suppressed-recombination model of speciation proposed by Coluzzi [33,38].
Analysis of the molecular polymorphism and genetic
differentiation of the timeless gene among Brazilian
populations of An. cruzii suggested that the population
from Itatiaia (Rio de Janeiro State) is in a process of differentiation and incipient speciation [14]. High F ST
values between Itatiaia (Rio de Janeiro State) and the
other populations from south and south-east Brazil was
reported here. In addition, comparison of Itatiaia with
other populations revealed some fixed differences and

Page 7 of 9

only a few shared polymorphisms. Moreover, the haplotype network shows that Itatiaia is clearly separated in
an isolated group (Figure 3). These results, therefore,
suggest that this population represents a different species in the An. cruzii complex.
Preliminary evidence was also presented here that
raised the possibility of the existence of two different
sympatric incipient species in Itatiaia. This is based on
the analysis of the genetic differentiation of the cpr gene
and a reanalysis of the recently published timeless data
[14]. Although a putative heterozygote was found in cpr
analysis considering the AG repeats and shared polymorphisms were observed in timeless, high F ST values
were detected between Itatiaia A and Itatiaia B in these
two molecular markers, as well as fixed differences which
seem to indicate that these two groups might represent
different incipient species. Inspection of the neighbourjoining tree presented in the timeless study [14] reveals
that the individuals classified here as Itatiaia A are clearly
isolated in a separated branch. However, the individuals
classified as Itatiaia B are mixed with the other individuals from south and south-east populations. In that
study, only one putative heterozygote was found (Ita01)
carrying alleles of the two Itatiaia groups. Unfortunately
this DNA sample was lost and therefore it was not possible to analyse the cpr gene of this individual mosquito.
The sample sizes available for the two Itatiaia groups are
quite small and further work is clearly needed to determined beyond any doubt that two sympatric incipient
sibling species exist in this locality but the results presented here seems to indicate that might be the case.
Analysis of a number of other molecular markers will
allow a more precise estimate of the Itatiaia population
differentiation and might provide a more complete representation of the divergence history of this species complex.

Conclusions
Evidence was presented here suggesting the existence of
at least one new sibling species within the Anopheles
(Kerteszia) cruzii complex in Itatiaia, south-east Brazil, a
finding that supports a previous timeless gene study. In
addition, according to cpr and timeless gene analyses,
the Itatiaia sample might be in fact composed by two
sympatric incipient species, named here Itatiaia A and
Itatiaia B.
