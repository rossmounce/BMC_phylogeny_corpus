Abstract
Background: The Mannheimia subclades belong to the same bacterial genus, but have taken
divergent paths toward their distinct lifestyles. For example, M. haemolytica + M. glucosida are
potential pathogens of the respiratory tract in the mammalian suborder Ruminantia, whereas M.
ruminalis, the supposed sister group, lives as a commensal in the ovine rumen. We have tested the
hypothesis that vertical inheritance of the leukotoxin (lktCABD) operon has occurred from the last
common ancestor of genus Mannheimia to any ancestor of the diverging subclades by exploring
gene order data.
Results: We examined the gene order in the 5' flanking region of the leukotoxin operon and found
that the 5' flanking gene strings, hslVU-lapB-artJ-lktC and xylAB-lktC, are peculiar to M. haemolytica +
M. glucosida and M. granulomatis, respectively, whereas the gene string hslVU-lapB-lktC is present in
M. ruminalis, the supposed sister group of M. haemolytica + M. glucosida, and in the most ancient
subclade M. varigena. In M. granulomatis, we found remnants of the gene string hslVU-lapB-lktC in the
xylB-lktC intergenic region.
Conclusion: These observations indicate that the gene string hslVU-lapB-lktC is more ancient than
the hslVU-lapB-artJ-lktC and xylAB-lktC gene strings. The presence of (remnants of) the ancient gene
string hslVU-lapB-lktC among any subclades within genus Mannheimia supports that it has been
vertically inherited from the last common ancestor of genus Mannheimia to any ancestor of the
diverging subclades, thus reaffirming the hypothesis of vertical inheritance of the leukotoxin
operon. The presence of individual 5' flanking regions in M. haemolytica + M. glucosida and M.
granulomatis reflects later genome rearrangements within each subclade. The evolution of the novel
5' flanking region in M. haemolytica + M. glucosida resulted in transcriptional coupling between the
divergently arranged artJ and lkt promoters. We propose that the chimeric promoter have led to
high level expression of the leukotoxin operon which could explain the increased potential of
certain M. haemolytica + M. glucosida strains to cause a particular type of infection.

Background
Genomes are evolutionary unstable structures that are
subject to frequent dynamic rearrangements [1-4].
Huynen and Bork [5] showed that overall gene order and
evolutionary distance are inversely correlated until a saturation level is reached. In a more recent analysis [4] 25
genomes were screened looking for conservation of gene
order. This analysis suggested that the saturation level is
dictated by functional constraints on operon structure and
that only 5–25% of the genes in bacterial and archaeal
genomes belong to gene strings that are conserved in at
least two genomes. However, some phylogenetic lineages
show remarkable conservation and others extensive
genome rearrangements [6,7]. There are four types of
changes that are thought to affect the order of the genes on
the bacterial genome: (i) inversions and translocations are
frequently detected when the genomes of even closely
related species are compared [8]; (ii) genes may be lost in
a single event [9] or as a consequence of multistep deletion of pseudogenes [10,11]; (iii) incorporation of nonhomologous genes or operons throughout the genome by
illegitimate recombination in a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is thought to be a major force
in the evolution of gene content of bacterial species
[12,13]; (iv) partial duplications of the genome may produce redundant genome segments [14-17].
The genus Mannheimia includes strains previously classified as trehalose-negative [Pasteurella] haemolytica and is
one of the most well-defined and robust clusters within
the gamma-proteobacterial family of Pasteurellaceae Pohl
1981 [18]. The Mannheimia subclades have taken divergent paths toward their distinct lifestyles. For example, M.
haemolytica + M. glucosida form one of the most recently
diverged subclades within genus Mannheimia based on
16S rRNA sequences and both species are potential pathogens in the mammalian suborder Ruminantia, whereas
M. ruminalis, the supposed sister group, lives as a commensal in the ovine rumen [18]. Previous works have
revealed that the leukotoxin (LktA) protein of M. haemolytica plays an important role in the evasion and exploitation of the adaptive immune system during pulmonary
infection via interactions with host cells [19-21]. The leukotoxin (lkt) operon codes for four proteins: an internal
acyltransferase, encoded by lktC [22]; the structural toxin,
encoded by lktA, which belongs to the Escherichia coli
HlyA-like subfamily of cytotoxic RTX (repeats in toxin)
proteins [22]; an inner membrane protein with a cytoplasmic ATP binding cassette (ABC) domain, encoded by lktB,
which pumps out LktA protein via interaction with the C
terminus of LktA [23]; and a membrane fusion protein,
encoded by lktD, which forms a bridge between the inner
and outer membranes [23]. The genes for these four proteins are physically adjacent on the chromosome and are
transcribed as lktCA or lktCABD messages [24,25].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/184

In a recent work, Larsen et al. [26] performed phylogenetic and compositional analyses in order to explore the
origin and fate of the lkt operon in M. haemolytica + M. glucosida. The scenario derived from this work suggested that
it has been vertically inherited from the last common
ancestor of genus Mannheimia to any ancestor of the
diverging subclades, although several strains belonging to
M. ruminalis have lost the operon. However, reconstruction of the rtxA tree provided strong support for a sister
group relationship between M. haemolytica + M. glucosida
and M. ruminalis on one hand and the more distantly
related taxon [Pasteurella] trehalosi on the other. This
incongruence between gene trees and organismal phylogenies could arise from HGT of the lkt operon from [P.] trehalosi to a common ancestor of these Mannheimia
subclades.
In this article, we have examined the compatibility of the
gene order in the 5' flanking region of the lkt operon
(called hereafter the 5' flanking gene order) in the
genomes of representatives from the four major subclades
within genus Mannheimia with the Larsen and coworkers'
[26] hypothesis of vertical inheritance. Under the assumption that closely related species accumulate fewer rearrangements than the distant ones, vertical inheritance
should result in lkt operons belonging to gene strings that
are conserved in all genomes. On the other hand, HGT
would result in disruption of the 5' flanking gene order
(breakpoints) between the same genomes.

Results
Sequencing of 5' flanking regions
The 5' flanking gene string in M. haemolytica serotype 1 str.
PHL101 [GenBank:M59210] contains four genes considered to code for functionally and physically interacting
proteins in an L-arginine ABC transporter [27]. In order to
examine the compatibility of the 5' flanking gene order
with the Larsen and coworkers' [26] hypothesis of vertical
inheritance, we here analyzed homologous genome segments in representatives from the four major subclades
within genus Mannheimia. We retrieved data (contig74)
from the annotated genome sequence of M. haemolytica
serotype 1 str. PHL213 [GenBank:NZ_AASA01000031].
For the remaining Mannheimia strains, genome segments
were first cloned into the Zap Express vector and packaged
into the Gigapack III Gold Packaging Extract. The resulting
phagemid libraries were then screened for segments of 5'
flanking genes by the plaque hybridization method using
a 542 bp fragment of the lktCA genes as a probe.

The sizes of the sequenced genome segments varied from
1,383 to 9,126 bp (Table 1). Our initial search for putative
orthologs suggested that the 5' flanking gene strings,
hslVU-lapB-artI/artJ-lktC and xylAB-lktC, are peculiar to M.
haemolytica + M. glucosida and M. granulomatis, respec-

tively, whereas the gene string hslVU-lapB-lktC is present
in M. ruminalis, the supposed sister group of M. haemolytica + M. glucosida, and in the most ancient subclade M. varigena (Figure 1). It should be noted that for one open
reading frame (ORF) we retrieved two closely related proteins, ArtI and ArtJ, in a subset of the genomes and that the
corresponding artI/artJ gene is located on the opposite
strand immediately upstream of the lkt operon.
Description of genes
Prior to this work, Highlander et al. [27] analyzed the 5'
flanking genes in M. haemolytica serotype 1 str. PHL101
and noted that the gene cluster lapCABT, corresponding to
the gene string hslV-hslU-lapB-artI/artJ, codes for functionally and physically interacting proteins in an L-arginine
ABC transporter. A close look at the Lap proteins showed
that updated annotations were already available in
SWISS-PROT (Table 2). The SWISS-PROT entry for the
LapT protein [SWISS-PROT:P49618] showed that it is
annotated as "arginine-binding periplasmic protein". PSIBLAST searches of the COG database revealed that LapT
belongs to COG0834 (annotated as "ABC-type amino
acid transport/signal transduction systems, periplasmic
component/domain"), thus supporting the updated
annotation in SWISS-PROT (Table 2). Our initial search
for putative orthologs retrieved two closely related proteins, ArtI and ArtJ, in a subset of the genomes as
explained above. These proteins belong to the polar
amino acid transporter (PAAT) family of the periplasmic
binding protein clan [28]. Members of this family bind
substrates in the vicinity of the inner membrane with high
affinity followed by delivery of the liganded form to a
membrane bound complex for translocation. These complexes belong to the family of ABC transporters and are
composed of two integral membrane domains and two
hydrophilic domains that each contains a conserved
nucleotide binding domain (NBD). The different
domains are composed of separate protein subunits in

prokaryotes, whereas they are generally fused into a single
polypeptide in eukaryotes. In E. coli, the membrane
bound complex of the L-arginine ABC transporter
ArtQMP2 consists of two integral membrane protein subunits, ArtQ and ArtM, and two copies of the nucleotide
binding protein subunit ArtP [29]. Previous works
revealed that ArtJ from E. coli and LapT from M. haemolytica serotype 1 str. PHL101 bind L-arginine with a higher
affinity compared to other amino acids based on equilibrium titration experiments [29,30]. On the contrary, the
binding affinity for L-arginine by ArtI from E. coli was one
order of magnitude lower compared to ArtJ and was
almost identical to the binding affinities for the other
amino acids by ArtI and ArtJ [29]. These data suggest that
LapT and ArtJ, but not ArtI, are orthologs of each other.
The LapB protein [SWISS-PROT:P32181] is annotated as
"membrane protein LapB" in SWISS-PROT. PSI-BLAST
searches of the COG database showed that LapB belongs
to COG2990 (annotated as "uncharacterized protein conserved in bacteria") (Table 2). These data support that the
lapB gene could code for an integral membrane protein
subunit (ArtQ or ArtM) of an L-arginine ABC transporter
as predicted by Highlander et al. [27], but other alternatives has to be considered.
The LapC protein [SWISS-PROT:P49617] has been annotated as "ATP-dependent protease HslV", whereas the
LapA protein [SWISS-PROT:P32180] has been annotated
as "ATP-dependent Hsl protease ATP-binding subunit
HslU" in SWISS-PROT. PSI-BLAST searches of the COG
database revealed that LapC and LapA belong to
COG5405 (annotated as "ATP-dependent protease HslVU
(ClpYQ), peptidase subunit") and COG1220 (annotated
as "ATP-dependent protease HslVU (ClpYQ), ATPase subunit"), respectively, thus reaffirming the updated annotations in SWISS-PROT (Table 2). The bacterial ATPdependent protease HslVU is a homolog of the eukaryotic

26S proteasome [31]. The proteolytic subunit HslV
(ClpQ) is a member of the MEROPS peptidase subfamily
T01B [32]. Structural information revealed that the HslV
protein from E. coli and the β-subunits of the proteasome
catalytic core (20S particle) share ~20% similarity over
~200 amino acid residues and a conserved fold [33]. HslU

(ClpY) belongs to the Clp/Hsp100 proteins of the AAA+
superfamily which comprises ClpA, ClpX, and HslU on
one hand and ClpB on the other [34]. ClpA, ClpX, and
HslU interact with cellular peptidases to form ATPdependent proteases. The role of these Clp proteins is the
unfolding of substrates by energy-dependent threading

prior to the delivery to the proteolytic subunit. On the
contrary, ClpB from E. coli and Thermus thermophilus and
the homolog Hsp104 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae do not
appear to bind to cellular proteases. Instead they interact
with the DnaK/Hsp70 chaperone system to assist in the
disaggregation and reactivation of strongly aggregated
proteins [35-39]. Clp proteins can be further classified
according to the number of NBDs which contain the ATP
binding Walker A and B motifs. Class 1 proteins ClpA and
ClpB contain two NBDs, whereas class 2 proteins HslU
and ClpX contain only one NBD [40,41]. Sequence and
structural information has shed light on the domain
architecture of the class 2 protein HslU from E. coli
[34,42]. This protein is folded into three distinct domains
with the N domain comprising residues 2–109 and
244–332 and the C domain comprising residues
333–443. The intermediate domain (I domain) that is not
found in other AAA+ proteins emerges from the N
domain at residue 110 and returns to it at residue 243.
Multiple alignment of Clp proteins from E. coli showed
that the spacing between the Walker A and B motifs in
ClpX and ClpA is ~55 residues, whereas it is 186 residues
in HslU due to their separation by the I domain [43]. PSIBLAST searches of the PDB database and the corresponding multiple alignments showed that the domain architecture of LapA and HslU is conserved, including the spacing
between the Walker A and B motifs (184 and 186 residues, respectively) (data not shown). Highlander et al.
[27] used homology methods to compare the LapA protein with the Clp/Hsp100 protein ClpA (class 1 protein
containing two NBDs), but not HslU (class 2 protein containing only one NBD), and nucleotide binding protein
subunits of the ABC transporter family (each containing
one NBD). These authors classified LapA as the nucleotide
binding protein subunit of an L-arginine ABC transporter
(ArtP) based on the spacing between the Walker A and B
motifs and the number of NBDs. However, the spacing
between these motifs in the closely related nucleotide
binding protein subunits ArtP and HisP is only 118 and
126 residues, respectively [29,44], whereas it is 184 residues in LapA and 186 residues in HslU as explained
above. These data suggest that LapA and HslU are putative
orthologs of each other, thus rejecting the Highlander and
coworkers' [27] hypothesis that the lapA gene codes for a
nucleotide binding protein subunit (ArtP) of an Larginine ABC transporter.
PSI-BLAST searches of the COG database showed that the
XylA and XylB proteins belong to COG2115 (annotated
as "xylose isomerase") and COG1070 (annotated as
"sugar (pentulose and hexulose) kinases"), respectively
(Table 2). Two previous works have revealed that these
proteins are involved in the dissimilation of D-xylose
through the pentose phosphate pathway in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium [45,46]. The sugar is first isomerized

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/184

into D-xylulose by xylose isomerase (XylA), which is a
member of the xylose isomerase-like TIM barrel family,
and then phosphorylated by xylulokinase (XylB), which
belongs to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, to
produce D-xylulose 5-phosphate.
Description of pseudogenes and remnant DNA
The xylB gene in M. granulomatis str. P1135/26T is predicted to code for a short peptide that corresponds to
~57% of the XylB protein. The premature stop codon is
located at codon 276 and is the result of frameshift due to
a 1 bp insertion at the first position of codon 270 (data
not shown). The designation of xylB as a pseudogene is
compatible with the results of Angen et al. [47], who
showed that a single lineage of M. granulomatis, including
strain P1135/26T, has lost the ability to utilize D-xylose as
a carbon source.

Interestingly, the lapB gene in M. haemolytica serotype 1
str. PHL101 is predicted to code for a short peptide that
corresponds to the first ~75% of the LapB protein (data
not shown). Multiple alignment revealed that the pseudogene originates from a 1 bp deletion at the second position of codon 217 leading to frameshift and a premature
stop codon at codon 225 (data not shown).
If we assume that genes have been inactivated continuously since the divergence of M. granulomatis, it is expected
that some genes have been degraded to such an extent that
they are no longer recognizable as pseudogenes. In order
to explore the fate of the genes identified in the other
Mannheimia genomes in the previous step, we performed
BLAST searches of the xylB-lktC intergenic region against 5'
flanking gene strings in these genomes. Interestingly, we
found a weak but significant hit to the hslVU operon in M.
haemolytica serotype 1 str. PHL213 (E-value = 5E-16) due
to a 50 bp inverted sequence (data not shown).
Description of conserved gene strings
Based on the notion that statistically significant conserved
gene strings can be confidently predicted to form operons
[4], we have analyzed a set of 17 proteobacterial genomes
in order to determine the operon organization of the 5'
flanking genes. The data set included a balanced number
of representatives from the gamma-proteobacterial group,
including three Pasteurellaceae genomes which are closely
related to the Mannheimia genomes, and the beta-proteobacterial sister group (Table 3).

The hslV and hslU genes from E. coli are transcribed from
a single promoter containing recognition signals for the
heat shock transcription factor σ32, with consensus
sequence STTGAA-N11–12-GNCCCCATWT, suggesting
that the genes belong to the σ32 regulon [42]. STRING
searches revealed that the hslV and hslU genes are present

in 15 genomes, including those of Pasteurellaceae, where
they belong to the conserved gene string hslV-hslU, suggesting that these genes comprise an operon (Figure 2).
We have shown that the hslV and hslU genes from M.
haemolytica serotype 1 str. PHL213 are transcribed in the
same direction (Figure 1) and that putative -10 and -35
motifs for σ32 are present upstream of hslV (data not
shown). These results are compatible with the predictions
of Chuang et al. [42] and provide clear and robust support
for functional and physical interactions between the hslV
and hslU genes.
The lapB gene is present in eight of the genomes, including
those of Pasteurellaceae, but does not belong to any gene
string spanning two or more genes, suggesting that the
gene comprises its own operon (Figure 2). The lapB gene
was represented by a pseudogene in M. haemolytica serotype 1 str. PHL101 as explained above. However, Caskey
et al. [30] have shown that this strain is able to transport
L-arginine with a high efficiency, something that seems
unlikely if LapB constitutes an integral membrane protein
subunit (ArtM or ArtQ) of an L-arginine ABC transporter
as predicted by Highlander et al. [27]. These results support that the lapB operon is functionally unrelated to the
other lap genes.
Two previous works have revealed that the genes encoding
the different subunits of the L-arginine ABC transporter
ArtQMP2 and the periplasmic binding proteins, ArtI and
ArtJ, belong to the gene string artP-artI-artQ-artM-artJ in E.
coli [29,48]. Although the genes code for functionally and
physically interacting proteins, the results of Wissenbach
et al. [48] suggest that they are organized into two separate

operons: artPIQM and artJ. The results obtained from
STRING searches highlighted two aspects (Figure 2). On
one hand, the artI gene is present in six genomes, including those of Pasteurellaceae, where it belongs to the conserved gene string artP-artI-artQ-artM. On the other hand,
the artJ gene is present in only the enterobacterial
genomes of E. coli O157:O7 str. Sakai and S. Typhi strain
Ty2 where it is connected to the conserved gene string
artP-artI-artQ-artM. These results are compatible with our
initial search for putative orthologs which retrieved two
closely related proteins, ArtI and ArtJ, in a subset of the
genomes, suggesting that the artJ gene is absent from most
genomes. For each art gene we searched the genome of M.
haemolytica serotype 1 str. PHL213 in order to identify
putative orthologs. We found a main cluster of typical
genes, artP-artI/artJ-artQ-artM, on contig22 and a single
gene, lapT, on contig74 (data not shown). Highlander et
al. [27] have shown that lapT is transcribed from a single
promoter, suggesting that the gene comprises its own
operon, while we have shown that the identified genes on
contig22 are transcribed in the same direction (data not
shown). These results are compatible with the predictions
of Wissenbach and coworkers [29,48] and support that
the artPIQM and lapT genes are organized into two separate operons, thus reaffirming our hypothesis that lapT
and artJ, but not artI, are orthologs of each other.
The xylA and xylB genes were predicted to code for proteins that functionally interact in the dissimilation of Dxylose through the pentose phosphate pathway. The xylA
and xylB genes from E. coli are organized into a single
operon [49]. STRING searches revealed that the xylA and
xylB genes are present in four genomes, including only

these results, we have shown that the xylA and xylB genes
are transcribed in the same direction (Figure 1), supporting that the respective genes comprise an operon.

Discussion
Table 1 presents the Mannheimia genomes analyzed in this
study, sorted by their overall similarity to M. haemolytica
serotype 1 str. PHL213. The dataset includes the type
strains of each species, except M.ruminalis where the type
strain HPA92T has lost the lkt operon [26], and represents
the diversity within genus Mannheimia based on phenotypic characters (biogroups), 16S rRNA phylogeny, and
geographic origin. Most Mannheimia species are inhabitants of the respiratory tract, but the genomes analyzed
here encompass a wide variety of lifestyles, including
potential pathogens of the ruminant respiratory tract (M.
haemolytica + M. glucosida and M. varigena), one commensal of the ovine rumen (M. ruminalis), and one potential
pathogen of the ruminant integument (M. granulomatis).
Prior to this work, Larsen et al. [26] used a strategy that
combines phylogenetic and compositional methods to
explore the evolution of the lkt operon in genus Mannheimia. This analysis suggested that the operon has been vertically inherited from the last common ancestor of genus
Mannheimia to any ancestor of the diverging subclades,
although several strains belonging to M. ruminalis have
lost the operon. However, reconstruction of the rtxA tree
provided strong support for a sister group relationship
between M. haemolytica + M. glucosida and M. ruminalis on
one hand and the more distantly related taxon [Pasteurella] trehalosi on the other. This incongruence between
gene trees and organismal phylogenies could arise from
HGT of the lkt operon from [P.] trehalosi to a common
ancestor of these Mannheimia subclades.
In this article, we have examined the compatibility of the
5' flanking gene order with the Larsen and coworkers' [26]
hypothesis of vertical inheritance. Given the collection of
strains, information on the operon organization of the 5'
flanking genes, and an organismal phylogeny that
describes bifurcation order, the 5' flanking gene order of
their ancestors can be inferred. The results of Highlander
et al. [27] suggested that the gene cluster lapCABT codes
for functionally and physically interacting proteins in an
L-arginine ABC transporter from M. haemolytica serotype 1
str. PHL101. However, our results indicate that these
genes comprise three functionally unrelated operons:
hslVU (lapCA), lapB, and artJ (lapT). The most probable
evolutionary scenario to explain the phylogenetic origin
and distribution pattern of individual 5' flanking regions
is shown in Figure 1. The 5' flanking gene strings, hslVUlapB-artJ-lktC and xylAB-lktC, are peculiar to M. haemolytica

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/184

+ M. glucosida and M. granulomatis, respectively, whereas
the gene string hslVU-lapB-lktC is present in M. ruminalis,
the supposed sister group of M. haemolytica + M. glucosida,
and in the most ancient subclade M. varigena. In M. granulomatis, we found remnants of the gene string hslVU-lapBlktC in the xylB-lktC intergenic region as explained below.
These observations indicate that the gene string hslVUlapB-lktC is more ancient than the hslVU-lapB-artJ-lktC and
xylAB-lktC gene strings. The disruption of the 5' flanking
gene order in the genomes of M. haemolytica + M. glucosida
can be explained by two different plausible evolutionary
scenarios. On one hand, the absence of the artJ operon
from the closely related Pasteurellaceae genomes and the
presence of the operon in the enterobacterial genomes of
E. coli O157:O7 str. Sakai and S. Typhi strain Ty2 suggest
that it has been acquired by HGT. On the other hand, the
insertion of the artJ operon could also be due to translocation of a vertically inherited artJ operon and parallel
loss of the operon in the closely related Pasteurellaceae
genomes. In a recent work, Larsen et al. [26] used the average relative 3:1 dinucleotide abundance to identify horizontally transferred genes among a dataset of 56
annotated genes from M. haemolytica and noted that the
lapT (artJ) gene was non-deviant from the average genome
signature, thus opposing the hypothesis of HGT. It should
be noted that false negatives (missed transferred genes)
arise when genes have ameliorated due to the mutational
processes affecting the recipient genome or the genes are
closely related to the recipient genome in terms of context
bias [50]. However, the young age of such a transfer (i.e.
during early evolution of M. haemolytica + M. glucosida)
and the absence of the artJ operon from the closely related
Pasteurellaceae genomes make these scenarios unlikely.
Therefore, the disruption of the 5' flanking gene order in
the genomes of M. haemolytica + M. glucosida is compatible
only with a history of translocation of the artJ operon during early evolution of this subclade (Figure 1). One of the
unexpected findings of the first comparisons of the 5'
flanking regions was the presence of a unique xylAB
operon immediately upstream of the lkt operon in M.
granulomatis which diverged after M. varigena but prior to
M. ruminalis and M. haemolytica + M. glucosida. We have
found a weak but significant hit to the hslVU operon in the
xylB-lktC intergenic region, reflecting the presence of
highly fragmented remnants of the ancient gene string
hslVU-lapB-lktC. The scenario derived from this analysis is
compatible with a history of inactivation and multistep
deletion of the hslV, hslU, and lapB genes after divergence
from the remaining Mannheimia subclades (Figure 1).
The results of this analysis are compatible with the Larsen
and coworkers' [26] hypothesis of vertical inheritance as
reflected in Figure 1. Following this hypothesis, under the
assumption that closely related species accumulate fewer
rearrangements than the distant ones, it is expected that

Page 8 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:184

the lkt operons belong to gene strings that are conserved
in all genomes, whereas HGT would result in disruption
of the 5' flanking gene order (breakpoints) between the
same genomes. Indeed, we found (remnants of) the
ancient gene string hslVU-lapB-lktC among any subclades
within genus Mannheimia, suggesting that it has been vertically inherited from the last common ancestor of genus
Mannheimia to any ancestor of the diverging subclades.
The presence of individual 5' flanking regions in M.
haemolytica + M. glucosida and M. granulomatis reflects later
genome rearrangements within each subclade. Thus, the
incongruence observed in the rtxA tree [26] points
towards two most probable explanations. On one hand, it
is compatible with a history of HGT from a common
ancestor of M. haemolytica + M. glucosida and M. ruminalis
to [P.] trehalosi. On the other hand, it may reflect a history
of homologous recombination between vertically inherited lktA genes.
While the set of Mannheimia genomes allowed us to study
the phylogenetic origin of the lkt operon, we cannot rule
out additional divergences within the 5' flanking region at
or below the subclade level. For example, the analysis of
the promoter activity of the 5' region in M. haemolytica
serotype 1 str. PHL101 has shown that transcriptional
coupling between the divergently arranged artJ and lkt
promoters is important for coordinating high level expression of the lkt operon [51]. Thus, during early evolution of
M. haemolytica + M. glucosida, the acquisition of a preformed transcriptional enhancer has occurred which
could explain the increased potential of certain M. haemolytica + M. glucosida strains to cause a particular type of
infection. However, in order to determine whether the
evolution of novel 5' flanking regions has contributed to
pathoadaptive niche differentiation within genus Mannheimia, we need to examine the distribution pattern of
individual 5' flanking regions by including additional
strains belonging to each subclade.

Conclusion
To sum up, two conclusions have been outlined. On one
hand, the presence of (remnants of) the ancient gene
string hslVU-lapB-lktC among any subclades within genus
Mannheimia supports that it has been vertically inherited
from the last common ancestor of genus Mannheimia to
any ancestor of the diverging subclades, thus reaffirming
the Larsen and coworker's [26] hypothesis of vertical
inheritance of the lkt operon On the other hand, acquisition of individual 5' flanking regions has occurred in M.
haemolytica + M. glucosida and M. granulomatis.

Methods
Taxa used
For this study we included M. haemolytica serotype 1 str.
PHL213, M. haemolytica serotype 2 str. CCUG 12392T, M.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/184

glucosida serotype 11 str. P925T, M. ruminalis str. HPA113,
M. granulomatis str. P1135/26T, and M. varigena str. 177T
to balance the number of representatives from the four
major subclades within genus Mannheimia based on phenotypic characters (biogroups), 16S rRNA phylogeny,
geographic origin, and lifestyle (see Table 1 for a description of strains used in this study, along with their accession numbers). All strains in our analysis have been
represented in previous studies by Angen et al.
[18,47,52,53] and Larsen et al. [26].
DNA isolation, amplification, and sequencing
We retrieved data (contig74) from the annotated genome
sequence of M. haemolytica serotype 1 str. PHL213. For the
remaining Mannheimia strains, we constructed, screened,
and sequenced phagemid libraries. We constructed a 542
bp probe in the lktCA region from M. haemolytica serotype
1 str. PHL213 by using the forward primer lktc_UP (5'CCCTCCACAAAGAATGGAGCTG-3') in conjunction with
the reverse primer lkta_DOWN (5'-TTTTGGTTGCCGTTAAAGTGTT-3'). The reaction conditions were 2.5 U Taq
polymerase, 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, 67 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01%
Tween-20, 2.5 mM Mg2SO4, each primer at 0.5 mM, and
each nucleotide at 0.1 mM. The cycling conditions were
initial denaturation at 94°C followed by 25 cycles of
94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, finishing
with extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR product was
labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP by using the Random
Primed DNA Labeling Kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Roche). To construct phagemid libraries, we
partially digested genomic DNA with the restriction
enzyme Sau3AI. Aliquots were run on agarose gels and
fragments of approximately 3–6 kb were cloned into the
BamHI site of the Zap Express vector according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The ligation
mixture was packaged in vitro into the Gigapack III Gold
Packaging Extract and transfected into E. coli XL1-Blue
MRF' according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The plaques were lifted and crosslinked to a 0.45
μm nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The phagemid
libraries were screened for lktCA clones and the pBK-CMV
phagemid vector was in vivo excised from the ZAP Express
vector by using the ExAssist helper phage and E. coli
XLOLR according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Stratagene). The plasmids were then directly sequenced.
Analysis of genes, pseudogenes, and remnant DNA
ORFs were considered to be genes if they showed a significant database hit, or were longer than 100 amino acids,
or were longer than 50 amino acids and conserved
between at least two genomes in the data set. Sequences
with database matches to a functional gene but spanning
more than one ORF were considered to be pseudogenes.
Significant sequence similarities between unique genes or

gene strings in one genome and intergenic regions located
at the corresponding sites in other genomes were considered to be remnant DNA.

For each ORF we searched the NCBI Genome database by
using PSI-BLAST [54] with default parameters until convergence in order to identify putative orthologs. BLAST
searches were performed with a very stringent cut-off
value (E = 1E-50) to minimize problems associated to
BLAST identifications. The annotation of each sequence
and the corresponding multiple alignments were revised
individually to discard wrongly identified putative
orthologs. Functional characterization of genes was
assessed by searching the SWISS-PROT database [55], the
Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) database [56], and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) by using PSIBLAST [54] with default parameters until convergence.
Conservation of gene order is one of the principal types of
genome context information and is considered to be an
indication of operon organization of the respective genes
and a legitimate predictor of functional and potentially
physical interactions between genes [4]. We selected 17
proteobacterial genomes for analysis of gene order conservation (Table 3). The data set included a balanced number
of representatives from the gamma-proteobacterial group,
including three Pasteurellaceae genomes which are closely
related to the Mannheimia genomes, and the beta-proteobacterial sister group. For each protein we performed
searches at the STRING server [57] with a high confidence
score > 0.7.
