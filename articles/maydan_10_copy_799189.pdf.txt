Copy number variation in the genomes of twelve
natural isolates of Caenorhabditis elegans

Abstract
Background: Copy number variation is an important component of genetic variation in higher eukaryotes. The
extent of natural copy number variation in C. elegans is unknown outside of 2 highly divergent wild isolates and
the canonical N2 Bristol strain.
Results: We have used array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to detect copy number variation in the
genomes of 12 natural isolates of Caenorhabditis elegans. Deletions relative to the canonical N2 strain are more
common in these isolates than duplications, and indels are enriched in multigene families on the autosome arms.
Among the strains in our study, the Hawaiian and Madeiran strains (CB4856 and JU258) carry the largest number
of deletions, followed by the Vancouver strain (KR314). Overall we detected 510 different deletions affecting 1136
genes, or over 5% of the genes in the canonical N2 genome. The indels we identified had a median length of 2.7
kb. Since many deletions are found in multiple isolates, deletion loci were used as markers to derive an unrooted
tree to estimate genetic relatedness among the strains.
Conclusion: Copy number variation is extensive in C. elegans, affecting over 5% of the genes in the genome. The
deletions we have detected in natural isolates of C. elegans contribute significantly to the number of deletion
alleles available to researchers. The relationships between strains are complex and different regions of the genome
possess different genealogies due to recombination throughout the natural history of the species, which may not
be apparent in studies utilizing smaller numbers of genetic markers.

Background
Copy number variation is an important component of
genetic diversity in both Caenorhabditis elegans [1] and
humans [2-4] and has been associated with complex
traits including autism spectrum disorder [5], mental
retardation [6,7], and schizophrenia [8]. Genes involved
in sensory perception, innate immunity and cell adhesion are overrepresented in copy number variants
(CNVs) [1,2].
We have previously described extensive copy number
variation relative to the Bristol N2 strain [9,10] in the
genomes of two highly divergent isolates of C. elegans,
CB4856 (Hawaii) and JU258 (Madeira) [1]. These observations were a by-product of our application of array
comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to discover
deletions in mutants of this nematode species. As our
laboratory is part of the C. elegans Gene Knockout

Consortium we are interested in methods that can help
us identify gene deletions more efficiently. Our previous
results for CB4856 and JU258 were encouraging, so we
examined additional natural isolates to measure the
extent of copy number variation in the genomes of less
divergent strains. It is important to realize that the C.
elegans Gene Knockout Consortium can deprioritize
genes affected by deletions in natural isolates in our
attempt to generate novel deletions in all genes. As
many of the deletions we identify in this study are members of multigene families (see Results and Discussion)
the Knockout Consortium can focus on obtaining deletions in members of these families that do not vary
among wild type strains.
We also recognized that a large number of indel loci
spread throughout the genome might allow us to more
thoroughly characterize the relationships among strains,
which have been difficult to ascertain due to the limited
number of markers used in previous studies. Although
C. elegans reproduces primarily through selfing of

hermaphrodites, males allow rare outcrossing in the wild
at an estimated rate of 1-2% [11-13]. The frequency of
outcrossing varies among populations and has been estimated between 0.01% based on linkage disequilibrium
measurements [11] to as high as 20% based on heterozygote frequencies [14]. Previous studies utilizing nuclear
markers have identified some recombinant strains, but
have been limited in their ability to precisely identify
which regions of the genome have been exchanged due
to the relatively small number of loci at hand [15,16].
More recently, SNP genotyping identified 41 haplotypes
among 125 wild isolates [17], indicating that recombination has occurred more frequently than previously
appreciated [15].
In this study we have used aCGH to detect copy number variation in 10 natural isolates of C. elegans in addition to the 2 isolates from our previous work [1]. We
have chosen to use the term indel to refer to the deletions and duplications that we have detected, since
many of them are < 1 kb in length and are thus not
considered CNVs by some [3,18]. We use the term
CNV only for larger aberrations. We use “deletion” to
refer to a sequence absent in a natural isolate but present in N2, and “amplification” to refer to an increase in
copy number relative to N2. An “amplification” detected
in a natural isolate might alternatively represent the
deletion of a duplicate copy in the N2 lineage. Only
genes that are present in a single copy in the N2 genome are represented on our microarrays, therefore the
presence of a gene (as in N2) cannot be reconstituted in
an isolate by mutation or conversion from an ancestor
carrying a deletion allele. Nevertheless, it is possible for
a gene to reappear in a lineage as the result of outcrossing, recombining the intact gene into the lineage. Also,
it is possible that extreme sequence divergence could be
misinterpreted as a deletion in some cases (see
Discussion).
We discovered 510 different deletions among 12 natural isolates, affecting over 5% of the genes in the canonical N2 genome. We found that recombination due to
outcrossing in the natural history of the species has
caused different portions of the genome to possess different genealogies, such that the relationships among
strains are not well represented by a traditional bifurcating phylogenetic tree.

Results
aCGH reveals a bias favoring coding sequence deletions
over coding sequence amplifications in C. elegans

We performed 10 new aCGH experiments utilizing our
exon-centric whole genome microarray [1], which
includes probes to 94% of the exons and 98% of the
genes in the N2 reference genome. Each aCGH experiment compared a different natural isolate to N2. Table

1 summarizes the number and lengths of indels that
were detected in each strain, including CB4856 and
JU258 from our previous study [1], as well as the number of genes and pseudogenes that were deleted in each
strain. It is important to note that nearly all of the
indels detected in this study affect coding sequences.
One “amplification” initially detected in all of the strains
was subsequently identified by PCR and DNA sequencing as a 1788-bp deletion in our N2 strain (VC196),
affecting exons 5 and 6 of alh-2, so that false amplification was ignored in all strains.
We detected 883 deletions (510 distinguishable types)
and 84 amplifications in the twelve natural isolates.
Indel alleles were considered the same if they overlapped and both the leftmost and rightmost affected
probes were within 3 probes of each other (see Methods
- Strain relationships for details). Amplifications were
less robustly detected than deletions due in part to the
conservative criteria that we used (see Methods), but
this alone does not account for the large preponderance
of deletions in the strains. For example, relaxing the
log2 fluorescence ratio of mutant:wild-type (log2 ratio)
cutoff for amplifications from 1.0 to 0.9 or even 0.8 captured only a modest number of additional amplifications
and did not affect the strong bias towards deletions in
the strains (data not shown). The bias towards deletions
is clearly evident in plots of log2 ratios on each chromosome (see Figure Six and Supplemental Figure One in
[1]).
Indel lengths

An ANOVA indicated that indel length varied significantly among the strains in our study (F = 1.8706, P =
0.0395), but not if RW7000 was excluded from the analysis (F = 1.4823, P = 0.1407). With just 8 deletions and
2 amplifications, the mean length of indels in RW7000
(22.6 kb) is greater than in the other strains, due largely
to an 86-kb deletion on chromosome IV and a 117-kb
duplication on chromosome V. To our knowledge,
RW7000 is the only strain in our study with a high Tc1
transposon count [19], so transposon activity may have
been more important in generating CNVs in this strain
than in the others. The median indel length among all
strains was 2.7 kb, with a mean of 8476 bp. Our ability
to detect very small aberrations was restrained by the
probe density on the arrays (The median distance
between adjacent probes on the array is 289 bp, and we
typically require at least 3 probes to be affected in order
to call an indel. See Methods - aCGH). Indel length also
varied significantly among chromosomes (F = 5.8772, P
= 0.0000233), with larger indels on chromosomes V, IV
and II. The mean size of indels on each chromosome
ranged from 12.8 kb on chromosome V to just 1 kb on
chromosome X. Furthermore, a Welch’s two-sample ttest revealed a significant difference (t = 6.9256, P =

The number of deleted genes and pseudogenes includes those either wholly or partially deleted. b The overall number of deletions and amplifications is the

1.091 × 10-11) between the mean indel lengths on the
autosome arms (as defined by Barnes et al. [20]) versus
the autosome centers or the X chromosome (9505 bp
and 3277 bp, respectively). This difference is not simply
due to the small difference in the density of probes targeting the arms and the centers (see Methods).
PCR validation of indel candidates

We performed PCR and gel electrophoresis to estimate
the false positive and false negative rates of our aCGH
indel predictions (Additional File 1: Table S1,). PCR primers were made to amplify 47 deletion loci and 7
amplification loci with predicted indel lengths between
250 - 2500 bp. This size range includes 40% of the
indels that we predicted, and only 9% of predicted indels
were smaller than 250 bp. Most indels detected in this
study were larger than 2500 bp and are thus likely to
have lower false positive and false negative rates than
the loci that were tested. Among 96 deletion candidates
tested at the 47 deletion loci, we observed 5 failed PCR
reactions, 90 confirmed deletions and 1 apparent false
positive (a 305-bp deletion candidate in JU258 affecting
4 probes), yielding a false positive rate of only 1%
among the successful PCRs (Additional File 1: Table
S1). For each deletion locus we also tested one isolate in
which aCGH did not detect a deletion, and observed 13
failed PCR reactions, 31 confirmed negatives and 3 false
negatives, giving a false positive rate of 9%, although it
is possible that some of these false negatives affect noncoding sequences that are not probed by our

microarrays and were thus undetectable by CGH. 6 of
the 7 amplification candidates that we tested gave wildtype PCR fragments, suggesting that tandem copies of
the amplified sequences are not found between the primer sequences that we used, perhaps because the additional copies exist elsewhere in the genome or because
the amplifications extended beyond the primer
sequences such that wild-type PCR products are still
produced despite the amplifications. Interestingly, PCR
indicated a deletion at a high-confidence amplification
locus (8 probes affected with a mean log2 ratio of 1.3) in
CB4854, suggesting that copies of the amplified
sequence are found elsewhere in the genome and not
between the PCR primer sites as in N2.
Extensive copy number variation in the C. elegans
genome allows even very closely related strains to be
distinguished by aCGH

A single deletion was detected in CB3191 and subsequently confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. The
deletion completely encompasses math-15 (sequenced
deletion breakpoints are at chromosome coordinates II:
1866365 and II: 1868059). This illustrates the power of
aCGH experiments to distinguish among strains, since
CB3191 had previously appeared identical to N2 based
on nearly complete mtDNA sequencing [15] and multilocus microsatellite genotyping [16]. Still, with only one
deletion, CB3191 appears as similar to the canonical N2
genome as our laboratory N2 strain (VC196), at least in
terms of the coding sequences targeted by our probes.

Maydan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/62

This suggests the possibility that CB3191 is a laboratory
contaminant or escapee (also suggested in [17]). In
effect, the aCGH experiment comparing CB3191 to N2
served as a self-versus-self negative control and demonstrated that our whole genome array design, in itself,
does not produce false positives.
CB4856 and JU258 were the most divergent strains
relative to N2, with more indels and more genes deleted
than any of the other strains. KR314 was the most divergent among the other strains and had more deletions on
chromosome II than any other strain, including CB4856
and JU258, but curiously had no deletions at all on the
left half of chromosome V (V-L) where 18 deletions
were present in CB4856 and 23 in JU258. The absence
of deletions on V-L suggests the possibility that KR314
reacquired an N2-like V-L through recombination.
Interestingly, RW7000 was the least divergent strain
other than the N2-like CB3191. This result contrasts
with an earlier study stating that RW7000 appeared to
be more divergent than 6 of our strains based on the
number of alleles in 31 chemoreceptor genes [21].
The distribution of indels in the genome and the
overrepresentation of indels in particular gene families

Figure 1 plots all of the indels we detected in each strain
on II-L. Additional File 2: Figure S1 plots a higher resolution figure of this type for the entire genome. Chisquare tests indicated that both the number of deletions
and the number of amplifications varied significantly
among chromosomes (P < 2.2 × 10-16 and P = 1.281 ×
10-5, respectively), after adjusting for the different number of probes targeting each chromosome. As previously
described for CB4856 and JU258 [1], indels in C. elegans
are strikingly more common on autosome arms than in
the autosome centers or on the X chromosome. The
autosome arms span just 38% of the probes on our
Whole Genome microarray but include 83% of the
indels that we identified (85% of the deletions and 64%
of the amplifications).
Additional File 3: Table S2 lists all of the genes affected
by the indels we detected. 1136 different genes were
either wholly or partially deleted in at least one strain.
The same gene families that we found to be overrepresented in indels in CB4856 and JU258 are also clearly
overrepresented amongst indels in the new strains in
this study, most notably the MATH-BTB, F-box, lectin
and serpentine chemoreceptor gene families. All of
these gene families cluster on the autosome arms [22].
Relatedness inferences based on deletions shared by
multiple natural isolates

Many of the indels we detected were found in multiple
strains (see Methods - Indel identification). Figure 2
shows the number of deletions found in each strain, and
the number of other strains that carry the same deletions. The strains with the most deletions also have the

Page 4 of 12

highest proportion of unique deletions in our data set,
excluding CB3191 and RW7000, which carry only
unique deletions. By this measure, CB4856 was the most
divergent strain, with 66% (113/172) of its deletions
being unique among the 12 strains. This agrees closely
with a study reporting that 70% of CB4856 SNPs were
not present in nine other natural isolates [23]. Unique
deletions comprise 64% (75/140) of the deletions in
JU258, 42% (33/78) of the deletions in MY2, and 39%
(48/124) of the deletions in KR314. In addition to carrying the most indels relative to N2 among the strains in
our study, CB4856, JU258, MY2 and KR314 are also the
least N2-like according to SNP genotypes [17].
Table 2 displays the number of deletions shared by all
pairs of strains. Deletions were used as markers to infer
a strain phylogeny under both Camin-Sokal parsimony
[24], which assumes that deletions are derived states
and transitions to the presence of a deletion are more
likely than transitions to the absence of a deletion, and
Wagner parsimony [25,26], which considers the appearance or disappearance of deletions equally likely and
does not presume ancestral states. Both parsimony
methods gave the same consensus tree (Figure 3) based
on 1000 bootstrap replicates drawn with replacement
from the 510 deletion loci that we identified. We chose
to exclude amplifications from this analysis because they
were less robustly detected than deletions. Deletions
were treated as independent characters despite the presence of linkage between loci. We detected significant
multilocus linkage disequilibrium (standardized index of
association (IAS) = 0.072, P < 0.001, see [27]) consistent
with other studies [11,13,28]. It is important to note
that because deletions are more common on the autosome arms, these regions of the genome factored heavily
into the relationships that we inferred. Overall, close
relationships were inferred between CB4853 and
CB4858, and between CB3191 and RW7000 (which closely resembled N2). CB3191 and RW7000 were both
very N2-like and shared no indels with any other strains
in our study.
Different relationships are predicted by different
regions of the genome due to the presence of recombination in the lineage, and this is reflected in the low
bootstrap confidence at many of the nodes on the consensus tree. An example of a possible recombination
event is indicated in Figure 1. AB1 was previously identified as a recombinant strain based on discrepancies
between the phylogenies inferred by mitochondrial and
nuclear marker data sets [15], and the bootstrap support
at the node leading to the AB1 on our consensus tree is
particularly low. While JU258 was most similar to JU263
on I-R, it shared more deletions with KR314 on II-L, IIIL and V-R. JU258 and KR314 were identified as each
other’s closest relative on 27% of CS (32% W) trees

Discussion
A bias favoring deletions affecting gene families involved
in environmental responses and innate immunity

Genes thought to be involved in sensory perception and
innate immunity are enriched in indels in both C. elegans [1] and humans [29]. These gene families include
the C. elegans F-box and serpentine receptor chemoreceptor families, as well as genes involved in ubiquitination and secreted proteins possibly involved in innate
immunity [22]. Chemoreceptor gene families have
undergone significant expansion in C. elegans since its
common ancestor with Caenorhabditis briggsae [30],
including multiple rounds of tandem duplication in the
sra and srab families [31], and appear prone to gene
gains and losses. We found that indel lengths were larger on the autosome arms where homologous gene clusters of these same gene families are the most common

[22]. Higher recombination rates [20] and the presence
of homologous gene clusters probably predisposes autosome arms to non-allelic homologous recombination
(NAHR) events, which tend to generate larger CNVs,
whereas smaller indels are more likely created by nonhomology based mechanisms [3,32]. Conversely, the
increased frequency of SNPs in the autosome arms of
natural isolates is probably not due to the increased rate
of recombination, but rather to increased genetic hitchhiking and/or background selection in the autosome
centers [33].
We chose to include pseudogenes in Additional File 3:
Table S2 because many genes annotated as pseudogenes
in the N2 strain probably have functional copies in
other natural isolates, especially genes with a single
defect in N2 (usually a premature stop codon or deletion [21]). The large number of deleted genes we
detected suggests that N2 itself carries deletion alleles
for many genes that are present in other natural isolates.
These events remain undetected since only probes to
N2 sequences are included on our microarrays.
A bias favoring deletions over insertions has previously been observed in patterns of pseudogene variation in C. elegans [34]. It has also been suggested that
there may be a high rate of spontaneous deletion in the
C. elegans genome [35], and perhaps even selection for
small genome size [36]. We detected far more coding

sequence deletions than amplifications in all of the natural isolates. This is the opposite of what is found in
Drosophila melanogaster [37] and humans [3], and may
at first seem puzzling since selection should tend to
favor coding sequence amplifications over deletions.
Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) is one
mechanism for creating copy number variation and it
generates a mutational bias favoring deletions [38]. It is
possible that the C. elegans mating system, consisting
mainly of selfing, coupled with recurring population bottlenecks due to a demography including frequent extinction and recolonization events [13] producing founder

effects, reduces the effective population size (Ne) of C.
elegans to a point where selection against deletions cannot overcome stochastic events and the force of genetic
drift, which in turn leads to the fixation of more deletions than amplifications as a result of the mutational
bias of NAHR. The worldwide Ne of C. elegans has been
estimated between 200 and 44,000 [39], which is orders
of magnitude less than the Ne of Drosophila [40] and
possibly also less than the current human Ne ([41]) and
the historic human N e of not more than perhaps
10,000-18,000 [41-43]. It is also possible that loss of
gene function could be adaptive in some cases [44],

such as for certain chemoreceptors in specific
environments.
New insights into complex strain relationships resulting
from recombination and outcrossing in the C. elegans
lineage

Different portions of the genome will possess different
genealogies due to recombination. Trees are therefore
inherently flawed in their generalized depiction of strain
relationships when recombination has occurred between
lineages, and should not be interpreted as phylogenies.

Nevertheless, our results largely agree with other trees
inferred from nuclear markers [15,16]. Strains that are
close together on these trees generally share more deletions than do strains that are further apart, with a few
bu but notable exceptions probably resulting from the
limited number of loci available in earlier studies. For
example, our results differ from the Haber et al. study
[16] in which CB4858 and CB4854 appeared most closely related to one another, identical at 10/10 microsatellite loci. We found that CB4858 was much more
closely related to CB4853, sharing 52/66 of its deletions
with CB4853 (52/63 CB4853 deletions were found in
CB4858) but sharing just 21/66 deletions with CB4854.
CB4858 and CB4853 appeared identical on II-L and
throughout chromosomes III and V (one small twoprobe CB4858 deletion candidate on chromosome III
did not quite meet our P-value cutoff in CB4853, but
both probes showed log2 ratios < -2). Only 5 CB4853
deletions not found in CB4858 were present in any
other strains, including 2 deletions on the X chromosome that were found in MY2, and 3 deletions on II-R
that were present in CB4854. Four of the 8 deletions
found in CB4858, but not in CB4853, were present in
JU263 (on chromosomes I, II and X). CB4858 and
CB4854 did share deletions in the regions of some of
the Haber et al. microsatellites but not in all cases. For
instance, CB4858 shared a deletion with CB4853 and
CB4856, that is not found in CB4854, which is just 6 kb
away from the microsatellite allele shared by CB4858
and CB4854 on II-L. This highlights the importance of
using a large number of loci spread throughout the genome when estimating strain relatedness.
Another discrepancy between the relationships
inferred in our study and those estimated by Haber et
al. [16] involves JU263. Microsatellites did not reveal
close relatedness between JU263 and JU258, but JU263

The number listed for all comparisons between a strain and itself is simply the total number of deletions detected in that strain.

shared more deletions with JU258 (31/68) than with any
other strain in our study. Results of SNP studies also
suggest a closer relationship between these two strains
[17]. JU263 was most similar to KR314 and CB4854 on
V-R, and shared 26/68 deletions with KR314 overall.
Although it does not appear on the consensus tree, a
JU263/JU258/KR314 group appeared on 28% of W trees
inferred from all bootstrap replicates. Chromosome III
told yet another story, where JU263 shared 4/4 deletions
on III-L with JU322, and none of these with any other
strain.
Overall, CB4856 did not appear particularly closely
related to any of the other strains. CB4856 shared the
most deletions with KR314, JU322, JU258, JU263 and
MY2 (18, 18, 17, 17, and 16, respectively), and slightly
fewer with the remaining strains (but none with CB3191
and RW7000). However, specific regions of the CB4856
genome more closely resembled particular strains. For
example, CB4856 and JU258 shared 5 deletions in common over a 10.6 Mb interval on chromosome V, but
each shared only one deletion over the same interval
with any other strain (MY2). CB4856, JU258 (and MY2
in the region of the deletion shared by all 3 strains) also
share many CB4856 SNP alleles in this portion of the
genome [17]. Still, CB4856 and JU258 were significantly
diverged from one another in this region, which
included 18 deletions unique to CB4856 and 10 deletions unique to JU258. Many other regions of similarity
among different groups of strains are evident in Additional File 2: Figure S1 and Additional File 3: Table S2,
illustrating that the relationships among strains are
complicated due to recombination and outcrossing,
probably to a greater extent than previously appreciated
in studies utilizing fewer genetic markers [15,16]. Our
study sheds further light on the extent of recombination
in the natural history of the species because unlike the
study by Rockman et al. [17], our study includes a great
number of alleles not found in CB4856 (see Figure 2).
Very common indels, mutation hotspots, and the
possibility of extreme sequence divergence
masquerading as deletions

Remarkably, we found 6.7-kb deletions (in CB4854,
CB4856 and JU322) and duplications (in KR314 and
MY2) that affected exactly the same 117 probes on
chromosome III. These indels target the retrotransposon
retr-1. The log2 ratios for these amplifications (particularly for MY2) indicated a roughly four-fold amplification, suggesting the presence of multiple copies of the
retrotransposon.
Some deletions and amplifications were more common among the strains in our study than the allele
observed in N2 (see Figures 1 and 2). For example, a
10-kb deletion on chromosome III was found in all
strains except CB3191 and RW7000. This deletion

Page 8 of 12

affected 3 uncharacterized genes, Y75B8A.31,
Y75B8A.32 and Y75B8A.34, and could possibly be of
ancient origin. It is possible that some common indels
have arisen by independent mutations, particularly if
there are hotspots susceptible to mutation by NAHR
[32] and/or subject to positive selection. However
another study has shown that all of the strains in our
study except CB3191 and RW7000 also share Hawaiian
SNP alleles in precisely this region of chromosome III
(see Supplemental Table Two in [17]), suggesting that
the common deletion we detected is shared by descent.
We also found several very common deletions on V-R
(see Additional File 2: Figure S1 and Additional File 3:
Table S2), which is a region rich in copy number
variation.
Regions with very high sequence divergence could
potentially produce log 2 ratios negative enough to
appear as deletions in aCGH data, but are unlikely to
account for a sizeable proportion of the deletions that
we detected. The false positive rate in our PCR validation of small deletion candidates was only 1%. On average, roughly 10% or more of the nucleotides in each of
several adjacent 50-mer probes would need to be
mutated in order to approach our log2 ratio cutoff for
deletions [45]. This level of sequence variability in our
probe sequences is particularly unlikely because our
probes target coding sequences. On average, single
nucleotide polymorphisms relative to N2 exist at 1/840
nucleotides in CB4856 [46,47] and 1/1500 nucleotides in
CB4858 [48], but recent whole genome sequencing of
the CB4856 genome has identified several regions of
much higher sequence diversity (> 10×) that sometimes
coincide with deletions identified in our aCGH data
(David Spencer and Ryan Morin, personal communication). Nevertheless, one CB4856 deletion that we
detected and an overlapping region of high sequence
diversity have both been independently identified and
confirmed, and are associated with the genetic incompatibility between CB4856 and N2 [49]. Reproductive
isolation has allowed for the accumulation of sequence
diversity in this region. Still, we cannot rule out that
some of the deletions we report could be false positives
resulting from regions of extreme sequence divergence.
This is probably more likely in the most divergent
strains. Genes in some of the gene families that are
overrepresented amongst the deletions we report are
known to be subject to positive selection for changes in
amino acid sequence [22,50].

Conclusion
We have shown that there is substantial copy number
variation in coding sequences in the C. elegans genome.
Indels are most common on the autosome arms, especially on chromosomes II and V. Deletions relative to

Maydan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/62

N2 are much more common than amplifications. Over
5% of the annotated genes in the N2 genome overlap
with indels in at least one of the 12 strains that we
examined. This underestimates the copy number variation in the C. elegans genome because we examined
only 12 natural isolates, our ability to detect very small
indels is limited by the probe density on our microarrays, and we did not attempt to detect indels that do
not affect exons. Approximately 26% of the C. elegans
genome is intronic and 47% is intergenic sequence [10].
The indels that were detected should be useful in
explaining natural phenotypic variation, particularly in
chemosensation [51] and innate immunity [52]. aCGH
is a powerful method to quickly obtain a large number
of genetic markers throughout the genome, and has
revealed complex relationships among wild C. elegans
isolates resulting from recombination and outcrossing
events throughout the natural history of the species.
The naturally occurring deletions we have detected contribute significantly to the number of deletion alleles
available to the C. elegans research community, and
genes affected by these deletions can be deprioritized in
efforts to generate novel mutations.

Methods
Strain selection, nematode culturing and DNA
preparation

The N2 reference strain in all experiments was VC196, a
subculture of N2 received from the Caenorhabditis
Genetics Center (CGC) in 2002. RW7000 was acquired
from the lab of Robert Waterston in 1987 and was submitted by that lab to the CGC in 1991. All other strains
were received directly from the CGC and grown for a
minimal number of generations prior to DNA preparation. We selected the strains in an attempt to sample a
range of the microsatellite diversity observed by Haber
et al. [16], but also included strains thought to be very
closely related to each other in an attempt to better distinguish them with a larger number of loci. We also
included JU322, which was not part of the Haber et al.
study. We intentionally selected some strains suspected
to be recombinant, including AB1 [15] and CB4854
[16], to test our ability to identify particular regions of
the genome that have been exchanged as the result of
outcrossing. Nematodes were grown as previously
described [9] on 150-mm NGM agar plates seeded with
Escherichia coli strain c 1666. Nematode populations
were grown to starvation, harvested by washing with
M9 containing 0.01% Triton X-100, and washed an
additional 7 times by centrifugation, removal of the
supernatant by aspiration, resuspension and vortexing in
M9/Triton-X100. After the final wash, DNA was prepared by standard phenol-chloroform extraction and
ethanol precipitation as previously described [1].

aCGH

Probes on our whole genome microarray were initially
selected from build WS139 of the C. elegans genome
[1]. The median distance between adjacent probes
included on the microarray is 64 bp (66 bp in the arms
and 63 bp in the centers), while the mean probe spacing
is 260 bp (297 bp in the arms and 233 bp in the centers). Microarray manufacture, DNA fragmentation and
labeling, sample hybridization and imaging, and fluorescence intensity measurement were performed by Roche
NimbleGen, Inc. as previously described [1]. Log2 ratios
(Natural Isolate/N2) were calculated and then normalized using the robust LOWESS regression [53] implemented in the R programming language [54] with a
smooth spanner setting of f = 0.4. The microarray data
have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus [55] and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE19440 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE19440.
Indel identification

Indels were detected with a segmentation algorithm
developed by S. Flibotte [1], briefly described here. The
algorithm was written in the C programming language
and employs a highly efficient bottom-up approach. The
program assumes that log 2 ratios for all probes are
drawn from a normal distribution and begins by considering each probe as an individual segment. The algorithm performs t-tests for all possible mergers of
adjacent segments to estimate the probability that the
log 2 ratios were drawn from samples with the same
mean. These P-values are stored in a heap, prioritizing
all possible mergers. The data structure is an ordered
doubly linked list. The program makes the most likely
merger of adjacent segments according to these Pvalues, calculates the new mean log2 ratio of the segment resulting from the merger, calculates P-values for
subsequent mergers of the new segment with its neighbours and updates the heap. This procedure is repeated
until the P-value of the next most likely merger is less
than a critical value supplied by the user (typically 0.05).
The program calculates a P-value for each remaining
segment using a one-sample t-test. Segments are then
labeled as candidate “amplifications” or “deletions” if
their both their mean log2 ratios and P-values meet or
exceed cutoff values supplied by the user. Segments that
do not meet both of these criteria are labeled as “normal”. If desired, the program can then merge all adjacent segments sharing the same label, recalculating the
mean log2 ratios and P-values for the merged segments.
The entire process takes just a few seconds for data sets
of 380,000 probes like those used in this study.
Aberrant segments with a P-value ≤ 0.01 were called
deletions if the mean log2 ratio of probes in the segment
was ≤ -2, and called amplifications with a mean log 2

Maydan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:62

ratio ≥ 1. Most indels that we classified as deletions are
probably truly deletions as opposed to insertions in the
N2 lineage, since we used probes targeting coding
sequences that contain no non-unique 20-mers and no
more than 70% homology to other genome sequences.
A novel N2 gene arising by duplication and subsequent
sequence divergence in the N2 lineage would have to
accumulate many coding sequence mutations in order
to pass our probe selection filters. N2 genes arising
from recent duplications are probably among the 2% of
genes not represented on our microarrays. Nonetheless,
we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some
indels affecting novel N2 genes could have been misclassified as deletions in the natural isolates.
P-values were not corrected for multiple tests, but a
Bonferroni correction would not exclude many indels
since a large majority of them have P-values far below
the cutoff (91% of all indels have P-values < 0.001, and
83% have P-values < 0.0001). All indels affected 3 or
more consecutive probes, with the exception of 10 deletions (~1% of the indels) that were detected by just 2
probes with very negative log2 ratios.
All aberrant segments were examined manually and
some adjustments were made to fine-tune the selection
of the leftmost and rightmost probes ("breakpoint
probes”) within the indels. Some segments were interrupted stretches of probes that did not give log2 ratios
consistent with an indel and were manually split into
multiple segments. After these adjustments, the mean
log 2 ratios and P-values were recalculated for all segments with one-sample t-tests using R to ensure that
our cutoffs were still met. In most cases these adjustments further decreased the P-value of the indels.
Occasionally, probes flanking indels show unusual log2
ratios outside the normal range for unaffected probes
[1]. This can sometimes make identification of the indel
breakpoints less certain. For each indel, we identified
“flanking probes” beyond the left and right breakpoint
probes to demark the point at which more normal log2
ratios begin to consistently appear again (log2 ratios >
-0.8 for deletions, and log2 ratios < 0.5 for amplifications). 78% of these flanking probes were adjacent to
their corresponding breakpoint probes, and 90% were
within three probes of indels.
Validation of indel candidates by PCR and gel
electrophoresis

Indel loci with minimum putative lengths of 250 - 2500
bp were chosen for validation to give PCR amplicons
with convenient product sizes. PCR primers were
designed to include sequences that aCGH suggested
were not included in the indels, but it is possible that
some indels may have extended into primer sequences
(leading to failed PCR reactions). Loci on all six chromosomes were tested. For each indel locus we tested

Page 10 of 12

one or more natural isolates with putative indels within
the PCR amplicon, one isolate with no apparent indel,
and N2 DNA as a control. All reactions were run with
annealing temperatures of 55°C and a 2-minute extension time, with no attempt to optimize PCR conditions.
False negatives were considered to be any PCR product
found in an isolate with no predicted indel that differed
from the N2 band size, whether or not the band size
was the same as that found in isolates with predicted
indels.
Chi-square tests, t-tests and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

All remaining chi-square tests, t-tests and ANOVA tests
were done using R. For the chi-square tests, the
expected number of indels on each chromosome was
calculated based on the proportion of probes targeting
that chromosome, which essentially corrects for differences in length and gene content among chromosomes.
Indel lengths were measured from the middle of the left
breakpoint probe to the middle of the right breakpoint
probe. Indels found in more than one strain were
counted multiple times.
Affected genes

Probe coordinates were obtained by remapping probe
sequences to the most recent genome data freeze
(WS190) using MegaBLAST, which utilizes a greedy
algorithm [56] to align DNA sequences. 24 probes on
the array no longer had perfect sequence matches in the
genome due to changes in the genome sequence from
WS139 to WS190, but none of these probes were present in any of the indels that we detected.
In order to generate the list of genes affected by indels
in Additional File 3: Table S2, we first extracted the
start and stop coordinates for all genes in genome build
WS190 from WormBase. From that list, we extracted
only the genes that overlapped the coordinates spanned
by the indel breakpoint probes. Genes completely contained within the region spanned by an indel were listed
as entirely affected. Discrepancies between Additional
File 3: Table S2 and the list of deleted genes in CB4856
and JU258 given in Maydan et al. (2007) are due to the
adjustments we made to the indel breakpoints and
because the genes listed in the previous study were
extracted from an older genome build (WS150).
Strain relationships

All deletion loci were treated as discrete presenceabsence characters. Strains were considered to carry the
same deletion allele if their respective deletions overlapped and both their left and right breakpoint probes
were within 3 probes of each other, or in a small number of cases (where the breakpoint and flanking probes
were more ambiguous) if the breakpoint probes in one
strain fell within the region spanned by the flanking
probes in another strain. Remarkably, most deletions
found in multiple strains according to these criteria had

Maydan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/62

exactly the same breakpoint probes, illustrating the
reliability of the log2 ratios. The single case where we
identified deletions and amplifications affecting the
same probes could have been treated as a multi-state
locus, but this was not done because we chose to
exclude amplifications from this analysis.
Unrooted trees were inferred from the 510 deletion
loci using Phylip 3.66 [57]. The most parsimonious trees
were inferred under both Camin-Sokal and Wagner parsimony methods from 1000 bootstrap replicates drawn
with replacement from the loci. An unrooted consensus
tree was then inferred separately for each method. The
true position of the root of the consensus tree is
unknown.
Linkage disequilibrium

We used LIAN 3.5 [27] to calculate a standardized
index of association (IAS) based on the original formulae
given by [58,59]. I A S is 0 at linkage equilibrium. The
program tested significance with a Monte Carlo simulation, resampling loci without replacement over 1000
iterations, in order to scramble their order and generate
a null distribution of IAS. The P-value is the probability,
under the null hypothesis of linkage equilibrium, of IAS
being greater than or equal to the value observed for
our data set.
