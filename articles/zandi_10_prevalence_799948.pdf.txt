Abstract
Background: Some genotypes of human papillomaviruses can infect the genital tract and they are important
infectious agents which their oncogenicity is regardable. Thus the aim of this study was to determine the
prevalence of various genital human papillomaviruses (HPV) among women being subjected to routine pap smear
test in Bushehr city of Iran.
Results: Based on the collected data, 11(5.5%) samples were detected positive for HPV DNA and 189(94.5%)
samples out of 200 samples were detected negative for HPV DNA. Meanwhile 4(2%) samples detected positive for
HPV DNA by PCR were detected positive for HPV by pap smear test as well. On the other hand 5 samples which
were detected positive for HPV by pap smear test didn’t have HPV DNA after being tested by PCR method. Among
the 11 positive samples 7 samples were identified as HPV-16, 3 samples were HPV-18 and one was HPV-53.
Conclusion: Regarding the prevalence of highly carcinogen genotypes of HPV in our study determination of
genital HPV prevalence among the normal population of women of Bushehr city is recommended.

Background
Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common
cancer affecting women. Nowadays screening programs
have reduced the mortality and morbidity of this disease, but 500,000 new cases of invasive cancer of the
cervix are still diagnosed annually. Epidemiological and
molecular studies have demonstrated that certain types
of human Papillomaviruses (Highly carcinogen genotypes) are the major cause of most cases of cervical cancer [1].
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) belong to Papillomaviridaefamily[2]. So far, 118 types have been identified
according to their biological niche, oncogenic potential
and Phylogenetic position. There are about 40 HPV viral
types that are commonly found in the genital tract which
are classified in the Alphapapillomavirus genus[3,4]. On

the basis of molecular epidemiologic evidence, genital
HPV types have been subdivided in to low-risk types and
high-risk ones [5,6]. Several HPV types, such as HPVs 16,
18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 66 have been
implicated in cervical carcinogenesis (high risk types),
whereas other types, such as HPVs 6 and 11, are frequently detected in benign lesions such as condylomata
acuminate [1]. Women infected with high risk HPV types
are considered to be at a higher risk for the development
of cervical cancer than those who are not infected with
HPV or are infected with low risk HPV types [6].
HPV-16 is the most prevalent type worldwide [7-9].
HPV18, 45, 31 and 33 are the next most prevalent
types. In Asia, HPV58 and HPV52 are the next most
common after HPV16 and 18[9]. HPV infection by multiple genotypes has been reported to occur in 10% to
20% of HPV-positive cases [10]. These epidemiologic
findings in combination with follow-up studies often
demonstrate the role of certain HPV types in cervical
cancer development [1,11-13].

HPV DNA testing has been used as an adjunct to Pap
smear cytology test in the diagnosis of cervical cancers
to improve screening sensitivity and negative predictive
value [11-13]. In fact, HPV DNA PCR is now recommended for patients with cytological abnormalities
based on the new American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists guidelines [14]. In addition, the
importance of HPV genotyping in diagnostic practices is
increasingly recognized in distinguishing high-risk from
low-risk infections as well as in the development of cancer intervention strategies such as vaccine preparation
[9,10]. Therefore, genotyping of HPV in clinical settings
is regarded as an important diagnostic tool for cervical
cancer, and also as means for providing valuable information necessary for its prevention and treatment.
In this study, we determined the prevalence of various
HPV genotypes among the women subjected to routine
Pap smear test in Abolfazl outpatient clinic of Bushehr
University of Medical Sciences, Iran, by PCR and subsequent sequencing. Cytological diagnoses were also done
on all samples based on the new Bethesda system.

Methods
This study has been approved by the Ethical Committee
of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences.
Two hundred samples were collected from women
admitted at Abolfazl outpatient clinic in Bushehr and
voluntarily subjected to gynecological examination by
gynecologist from 2008 to 2009. Two Samples were collected from each patient by cytobrush: one for Papsmear test for detection of cytopahic effects of HPV and
another one for HPV DNA PCR assay which was stored
at -20°C until PCR test time.
DNA Extraction

All samples were subjected to centrifugation 2000 rpm for
5 minutes and precipitated cells were digested using digestion buffer containing proteinase K, followed by extensive
extraction with phenol/chloroform [15]. The extracted
DNA was stored at 4°C until tasted. DNA quality was evaluated by PCR using forward primer PCO3: 5’-ACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGC-3’ and reverse primer PCO4:
5’-CAACTTCATCCACGTTCACC-3’ that amplify a 110
bp product from the human b-Globin gene[12].
HPV PCR

b-Globin positive samples were subjected to HPV PCR by
forward primer GP5+: 5’-TTTGTTACTGTGGTAGATACTAC-3’ and reverse primer GP6+:5’-AAAAATAAACTGTAAATCATATTC-3’ for L1 open reading
frame (ORF) that amplifies a 150 bp product from the
HPV L1 ORF [12]. PCR was performed according to the
procedure described previously[12]. Extracted DNA from
HeLa cell line was used as HPV positive control and no

DNA was added for negative control. Samples were subsequently subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis.
DNA Sequencing Assay

HPV positive PCR products were subjected for automated sequencing (Kawsar Biotech Co., Tehran, Iran).
Nucleotide sequences were aligned with CLUSTALW
program using BioEdit software (BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor Software, Department of Microbiology,
North California State University) and confirmed by
visual inspection. Genetic distance was estimated using
the Kimura two-parameter matrix[16]. A phylogenetic
tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ)
method[17]. Bootstrap resampling and reconstruction
were carried out 1000 times to confirm the reliability of
the phylogenetic tree[18]. The analysis and calculated
nucleotide differences within and between the isolate
sequences were carried out by MEGA program, version 4
[19]. The nucleotide sequences of HPV isolates reported
in this article can be found in the GenBank database
under accession numbers GU076513 through GU076523.
Statistical Analysis

Data was processed by SPSS 16 Package program for
statistical analysis (Chicago, IL, USA).

Results
The result of HPV DNA PCR for collected samples
revealed that there were 11(5.5%) samples with HPV
DNA by using general primers for all genotypes of HPV.
The result of genotyping based on MEGA software
using which is based on genetic distances and phylogenetic tree informations (Table 1) showed that 7 samples
out of 11 HPV DNA positive samples were detected as
HPV-16, three samples were identified as HPV-18 and
one sample was detected as HPV-53.
Results of pap smear showed that 9(4%) samples were
detected as HPV positive meanwhile 4 of them were
detected as HPV DNA positive by PCR method. On the
other hand 7 samples which identified as HPV DNA
positive by PCR method were negative for HPV infection when they investigated by pap smear test.
Mean of age for HPV infected women were 31.9 years
old and it is concordant with the sexual active age
which is very important for incidence of any kind of
genital infections. The youngest one was 24 years old
and the oldest one was 44 years old.
Based on clinical findings of HPV positive women we
have found that five HPV infected women didn’t have
any clinical manifestations and there was no evidence
for cervisitis and/or genital warts. Six women out of 11
HPV infected individuals have shown acute cervisitis but
there was no sign related to genital warts and just one
women showed the cervisitis and gentital warts together.

Besides, among five women who were detected positive for HPV infection by pap smear meanwhile they
were detected negative for HPV infection by PCR
method we have found that just two of them showed
acute cervisitis without any genital warts manifestation.
By using SPSS software and regarding to the collected
data, the sensitivity of pap smear test comparing to PCR
method in our study was calculated 36.36%(95% Confidence Interval = 6.91-65.43). Besides the specificity
value of our pap smear test was 97.35(95% Confidence
Interval = 94.57-99.43).

Discussion and Conclusion
Cervical cancer is an invasive cancer affecting approximately 500000 women each year of whom 80% live in
developing countries. The vast majority of cervical cancer cases are caused by infection with certain genotypes
of human papillomaviruses[1].
Pap smears for the detection of cytomorphologically
abnormal cells have decreased the number of deaths
from cervical cancer but have not eradicate the disease

in any screened population to date[13,20]. cervical cytology is considered to be a very specific test for high
grade pre cancerous leisions or cancer but even if the
quality of collection and spreading of cells, fixation, and
staining of smears, and reporting by well trained technicians and cytophatologists are good it’s sensitivity is
only moderate[21]. The result of meta analysis suggest
that cytological screening has a very wide range of sensitivity to detect lesions[12]; for example, cytology is estimated to have mean sensitivity of 58% and a mean
specificity of 69% in one study[12].
There is international consensus that “high risk” genotypes, including genotypes 16,18,31,33,35,39,45,51,52,
56,58,59 and 66 can lead to cervical cancer. Infections
with low risk genotypes, including 6, 11, ... can cause
benign or low grade cervical tissue changes and genital
warts[1,15,22]. HPV can not be cultured in vitro, thus
analysis of DNA sequences can be used to identify HPV
genotypes. PCR and in situ hybridization are two of the
most sensitive methods[15]. The detection of HPV in
cervical biopsies using these methods in conjunction
with cytology could potentially improve screening for
cervical cancer[15]. In this study we used the PCR
method for initial detection of HPV and regarding to
our facilities sequencing of the PCR products were performed by automated sequencing instead of in situ
hybridization in order to genotyping of HPVs.
By using PCR, it was revealed that out of 200 samples,
there were 11 (5.5%) positive samples for HPV DNA but
there were only 4 (2%) positive samples with HPV
related cytopathologic evaluation.
Based on results, seven samples (3.5%) were detected
as negative for HPV by cytopathology method meanwhile they were positive for HPV DNA by PCR method.
Such results express the false negativity of cytophatologic method. On the other hand five samples (2.5%) were
recognized positive by cytopathology method for HPV,
meanwhile they were negative for HPV DNA by using
PCR method. This result confirmed the false positivity
of cytopathologic methods. The sensitivity and specificity of cytopathology method in our study were 36.36%
and 97.35% respectivly. Meanwhile in one study these
criteria were reported as 58% and 64%, respectively [23].
In our study the prevalence of HPV was 11(5.5%) in 200
samples but in other study the HPV prevalence was 34.6
in Zagreb region and also the presence of HPV DNA
was 99.7% in women with histologically confirmed SCC
[24]. In one study in Mazandaran province (Iran) 33
(78%) cases were HPV positive based on PCR screening
in cancerous group [15]. The difference in result of
these studies could be due to type of patients and the
sample size. As it is mentioned in results section five
HPV infected women didn’t show any clinical manifestations such as cervisitis or genital warts. Also, just in one

HPV infected women genital warts was detected beside
the acute cervisitis so we can conclude that HPV infections can occur without any significant symptoms and
we couldn’t rely on clinical manifestations and/or cytopathological examinations such as Pap smear test. Also,
using colposcopy technique is recommended for further
clinical investigations.
Out of 11 positive samples for HPV DNA 7 samples
were HPV-16, determined by genotyping method, meanwhile 3 samples were HPV-18 and one sample was
recognized as HPV-53. This showed that HPV-16 is the
most prevalent type among high risk HPV in Bushehr
city. Also the prevalent type of HPV in most studies was
reported HPV-16 [7-9,21]. So as high-risk HPV types
has correlation with cervical cancer, there is daily
increase in need of screening test for women at risk of
HPV infection [11-13,21]. Also, based on our and other
studies results, using the PCR method for the detection
of HPV infection is recommended.
