Abstract
Background: Progressive diversification of paralogs after gene expansion is essential to increase
their functional specialization. However, mode and tempo of this divergence remain mostly unclear.
Here we report the comparative analysis of PRDM genes, a family of putative transcriptional
regulators involved in human tumorigenesis.
Results: Our analysis assessed that the PRDM genes originated in metazoans, expanded in
vertebrates and further duplicated in primates. We experimentally showed that fast-evolving
paralogs are poorly expressed, and that the most recent duplicates, such as primate-specific
PRDM7, acquire tissue-specificity. PRDM7 underwent major structural rearrangements that
decreased the number of encoded Zn-Fingers and modified gene splicing. Through internal
duplication and activation of a non-canonical splice site (GC-AG), PRDM7 can acquire a novel
intron. We also detected an alternative isoform that can retain the intron in the mature transcript
and that is predominantly expressed in human melanocytes.
Conclusion: Our findings show that (a) molecular evolution of paralogs correlates with their
expression pattern; (b) gene diversification is obtained through massive genomic rearrangements;
and (c) splicing modification contributes to the functional specialization of novel genes.

Background
The expansion of gene families in particular evolutionary
groups as well as in single lineages significantly contributes to different aspects of genome innovation. However,
not all classes of genes undergo equal rate of expansion.
Genes controlling basic cellular functions, such as DNA
modification, cytoskeletal organization, protein and RNA
metabolism are remarkably conserved both in sequence
and copy number across large evolutionary distances

[1,2]. Other functional categories progressively expand
during evolution, with mode and tempo of this expansion
largely depending on the effects on organism fitness.
Genes coding for structural proteins and those controlling
pathogen and stress response usually undergo lineage or
organism specific expansions [3,4]. In these cases environment-dependent regulation of gene dosage and expression is required. Genes coding for adhesion molecules,
extracellular signalling or those involved in gene regula-

tion expand preferentially during transitions towards
higher complexity, defined as increase in cell types [4].
The accretion of Zn-Fingers in vertebrates is among the
most positively correlated with increase in complexity [5].
The reason for the massive expansion of Zn-Fingers
resides in the ability to bind DNA and regulate gene transcription in a tissue or cell-specific fashion. How this specificity is reached after gene expansion remains still an
open question. According to the widely accepted model of
evolution by gene duplication [6], in the first phases of
their life novel genes are particularly free to change due to
relaxed pressure acting on them. The most likely outcome
is the acquisition of harmful modifications leading to loss
of function (nonfunctionalization). However, in very rare
cases, novel genes can acquire advantageous mutations
differentiating their function from that of the ancestor
(neofunctionalization). In a third scenario, needed to
explain the abundance of gene duplications and lineagespecific expansions, mutations may occur in both genes,
ancestor and duplicate, that specialize in complementary
functions (subfunctionalization) [7-9].
Here we report a comparative analysis of the PRDM genes
in vertebrates with the aim of connecting the expansion of
this family of transcriptional regulators to their progressive functional specialization. The results of this study
also contribute to unravel the general principles that drive
gene family evolution. PRDM genes code for proteins controlling critical aspects of cell integrity, spanning from cell
commitment and differentiation [10] to cell growth and
apoptosis [11-13]. These genes also play a role in human
cancer, where they mainly act as tumor suppressors [14].
PRDM proteins share a characteristic domain organization with an N-terminal PR domain followed by a variable
number of Zn-Finger repeats. The only exception is
PRDM11, for which no Zn-Fingers are detectable (Figure
1A). The PR (PRDI-BF1 and RIZ) domain is 20–30% identical to the SET module, which is directly responsible for
the catalytic activity of several histone lysine-methyltransferases [15]. Some members of the PRDM family show
intrinsic methyltransferase activity [16,17], while others
play an indirect role by recruiting chromatin remodelling
enzymes [18,19]. The number and features of PRDM
genes in other species besides human are poorly known.
Except for mouse, most PRDM orthologs in other organisms remain uncharacterized. Such lack of information
has so far prevented from clarifying the reciprocal evolutionary relationships between different members of the
PRDM family.
We started our analysis by searching for orthologs of the
17 human PRDM genes in representatives of fully
sequenced eukaryotic genomes. We assessed that, after
their appearance in metazoans, PRDM genes expanded in
vertebrates and further duplicated in primates. By com-

paring the evolutionary features of PRDM genes with their
expression in human tissues, we detected a tendency of
newer genes to acquire tissue specificity. Slowly evolving
paralogs also produce more abundant transcripts. We
found that the massive structural rearrangements of primate-specific PRDM7 gene greatly contributed to modify
gene function. In particular, the duplication of an internal
segment conferred peculiar splicing pattern to the new
gene, with the gain of a novel intron or, alternatively, its
retention in the mature RNA.

Results and discussion
PRDM genes expanded in vertebrates and further
duplicated in primates
By searching for PRDM orthologs in a variety of eukaryotic
genomes, we did not identify any PRDM gene either in
fungi or in plants, confirming that they first appeared in
metazoans. In invertebrates, the orthology assignment
yielded 2 genes for nematodes and 3 genes for arthropods
(Figure 1B and Additional file 1). The additional sequence
found in insects corresponds to Hamlet, a transcription
factor involved in dendrite morphogenesis [20], and acting as negative regulator of S-phase entry in drosophila
[21]. Interestingly, also vertebrates PRDM2 [13], PRDM5
[12], and PRDM9 [16] are involved in cell cycle regulation. Among vertebrates, we identified 17 putative PRDM
orthologs in primates and 16 putative orthologs in
rodents, birds and amphibians (Figure 1B). In fugu we
only detected 15 PRDM genes, as we could not identify
the PRDM17 ortholog possibly due to the presence of
unresolved regions in the genome assembly.

Our results highlighted the expansion of the PRDM family
in vertebrates. We tried to assess a possible timing for this
expansion by checking for putative PRDM orthologs in
protochordates and other invertebrates. We were able to
identify only 2 PRDM genes in C. intestinalis (Figure 1B),
likely because of the poor quality of the ciona genome
assembly. The retrieval of 7 putative PRDM orthologs in
the echinoderm S. purpuratus indicated that at least a partial expansion of the family preceded the last common
ancestor of vertebrates (Figure 1B). Our data also showed
that PRDM gene expansion continued in primates, as one
single rodent co-ortholog corresponds to the primate inparalog pair formed by PRDM7 and PRDM9 (see Additional file 1).
Expression pattern of PRDM genes reflects their
evolutionary relationships
We rebuilt the phylogenetic relationships between PRDM
genes based on the multiple alignment of the PR-domain
of all PRDM proteins identified in vertebrates (Figure 2A).
The trees obtained by applying both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods are topologically comparable and well supported, the only exception being the

internal relationships within the subfamily composed of
PRDM7/9, PRDM11 and PRDM17. Overall, five subfamilies are clearly identifiable and the most divergent
member is PRDM17. Despite the large variability in terms

of gene structure and size among human PRDM paralogs,
genes lying in sister branches of the tree maintain similar
gene organization (Figure 2A). Such conservation partially reflects similar splicing patterns, as in the case of the

subfamily composed of PRDM2, 3, 16. All these genes can
code for both a full-length protein and an isoform without the PR-domain, which is often overexpressed in cancer [22,23].
We observed interesting correlations between gene divergence and expression patterns. In human, all PRDM genes
are generally expressed at very low levels, as assessed by
qPCR (see Additional file 2). However, substantial differences are detectable among the 17 paralogs in terms of
breadth and levels of expression. By ordering the PRDM
proteins according to their evolutionary speed, we
observed that less divergent paralogs are more expressed
than faster-evolving genes (Figure 2B). This result assesses
a negative correlation between rate of sequence evolution
and gene expression levels (Pearson correlation, r = 0.705, P = 0.01). In addition, some paralogs, such as
PRDM12, 13, 14, 7 and 9 acquire tissue specificity, since
the corresponding transcripts are detectable only in very
few of the analyzed samples (see Additional file 2). One
of the youngest members of the family, PRDM7, shows an
expression pattern mainly restricted to melanocytes, suggesting a progressive specialization and/or tighter regulation of its functions.
PRDM7 arose from PRDM9 duplication and acquired a
peculiar splicing pattern
To rebuild the possible rearrangements following primate-specific duplication, we compared genetic and
genomic features of the primate PRDM7 and PRDM9
genes with those of their co-ortholog PRDM7/9 in nonprimates. We observed higher conservation of the
genomic block around PRDM9 (Figure 3A) and higher
similarity of human PRDM9 gene structure and protein
domain organization with the non-primate co-ortholog
(Figure 3B). These results suggest that PRDM9 likely
retained the features of the ancestral locus, while PRDM7
acquired primate-specific features.

After segmental duplication, the new locus experienced
massive rearrangements that significantly modified the
structure of the resulting PRDM7 gene (Figure 3B). In
human, the last exon coding for the Zn-Fingers underwent
partial deletion and the resulting protein bears only 4
repeats instead of 14 (Figures 1A and 3B). In addition, an
89-nucleotide long segment within ancestral exon 3,
which codes for the PR-domain C-terminal part, tandemly
duplicated (Figure 4A). This led to the acquisition of a
complex pattern of splicing variants (Figure 3C, see
below). Interestingly, the duplication of the same 89nucleotides occurred 8 times in the chimp genome (Figure
3B). However, the possible effect of this repetition on
gene splicing is unknown since no chimp mRNA is available.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/187

For human PRDM9, both a shorter (AF275816) and a
longer (DQ388610) isoform have been reported. In the
latter, the corresponding protein add a N-terminal KRAB
domain to the usual PRDM architecture (Figure 3C). Meisetz, the mouse ortholog of the long PRDM9 isoform, is
able to activate the progression into meiosis through the
trimethylation of the lysine 4 on histone H3 [16,24].
Recently, the KRAB domain of Meisetz has been proposed
to be the ancestor of all modern KRAB domains, being
traceable in the last common ancestor of vertebrates [25].
In principle the genomic locus of PRDM7 could also code
for a long isoform with the KRAB domain, but all mRNA
sequences so far available corresponded to the short variant. One of them (AF274347) resembles the sequence of
the short form of PRDM9 implying that the duplication
inside exon 3 is coupled with an event of intron gain (Figures 3C and 4A). By using specific primers, we cloned the
long isoform of PRDM7 and found that it can retain the
89-nucleotide long duplicon within the sequence of the
mature mRNA (Figures 3C and 4A). This retention introduces a frameshift, and the resulting protein replaces the
Zn-Fingers with an alternative C-terminal region
(AM690991, Figure 3C). To assess the frequency of the
two PRDM7 isoforms in human tissues, we amplified the
corresponding region (Figure 4A) in a variety of RNA samples from normal tissues and cancer cell lines. In most
cases, two bands of 289 bp and 200 bp are detectable (Figure 4B). Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products confirmed that the higher band corresponds to the PRDM7specific amplicon with retention of the internal duplication. The lower band could correspond to either PRDM7
or PRDM9 since the two genes have identical sequences in
this region. The widespread detection of the isoform with
the retained duplicon suggests that this might be a general
mechanism to produce an alternative PRDM7 protein
without Zn-Fingers. Interestingly, in mouse two isoforms
of the Meisetz gene generated by alternative splicing also
lack the Zn-Finger repeats and code for a protein with only
the KRAB and the PR domains [16]. By using several combinations of primers, we identified other long isoforms of
PRDM7 with alternative patterns of exon retention
(AM690992 and AM690993, Figure 3C), but we did not
retrieve the long isoform coding for the Zn-Fingers. One
explanation could be that the long isoform of PRDM7
with the Zn-Fingers is not produced. Another possibility is
that it is extremely rare, being detectable only in specific
tissues and/or cellular phases. This is the case of Meisetz,
which is only expressed in fetal germ lines entering meiotic prophase [16].

Conclusion
The PRDM gene family of putative tumor suppressors
constitutes an interesting example of vertebrate-specific
expansion of transcriptional regulators. Except for
PRDM11, all PRDM genes code for a variable number of

C2H2 Zn-Finger repeats and, although the precise molecular function is mostly unknown, the ability to bind DNA
seems to be a common feature. In addition, some of the
PRDM genes control transcription through either direct or
indirect histone methylation [16,18,19,26]. Thus,
rebuilding the progressive specialization of the PRDM
ancestral function in different cell types and/or in diverse
stages of development may yield general conclusions concerning paralog differentiation of transcriptional regulators in vertebrates.
PRDM genes show an inverse relationship between
sequence divergence and expression level. Paralogs that
evolve slowly, such as PRDM8, 2, and 3 tend to be more
expressed than faster-evolving genes like PRDM15, 10 and
17 (Figure 2B). Although there is not a straightforward
biological explanation for it [27,28], this inverse correlation reflects an asymmetrical evolution of PRDM paralogs
and is compatible with their progressive sub- and neofunctionalization [7,8]. Both slowly (e.g. PRDM2) and
fast-evolving (e.g. PRDM6) paralogs show methyltransferase activity, which implies the repartition of the putative ancestral function among several duplicates. Signs of
neo-functionalization are also detectable, such as the different roles of PR domain in histone methylation and the
specific involvement of PRDM9 in meiotic progression
[16,24]. The acquisition of novel functions is particularly
evident in the primate-specific gene. As most newborn
genes [29,30], PRDM7 underwent remarkable structural
rearrangements. Some modifications, such as the reduction of encoded Zn-Fingers, are recurrent within the
PRDM family (Figure 1A), while the internal duplication
of ancestral exon 3 is unusual for at least two reasons.
First, the region undergoing duplication codes for the Cterminal part of the PR-domain, which is the only module
always present in PRDM proteins. Usually, such well-conserved regions are under strong selective constraints that
prevent harmful modifications. Second, the ancestral 89nucleotide long segment does not contain any repetitive
element to justify duplication through replication slippage and/or non-homologous recombination. Thus, the
internal duplication seems to reflect adaptation of
PRDM7 to novel functions. The effect of the duplication
on PRDM7 splicing may constitute the first evidence for
such adaptation. The duplication of a cryptic splice site
(AG-GC) in the ancestral sequence results in the acquisition of a non-canonical splice site (GC-AG). This site can
activate the splicing of an 89-nucleotide long intron partly
deriving from the ancestral sequence and partly from the
duplicon (Figure 4A). Such mechanism for intron gain
was theoretically described by Rogers in 1989 [31], but
has so far been observed very rarely [32,33] and never in
human genes. The resulting mature mRNA encodes for a
protein with the usual domain architecture of PRDM
genes (PR domain and Zn-Fingers). We found that the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/187

duplicated segment can be alternatively retained into the
mature mRNA and eventually encodes for a frameshifted
protein without Zn-Fingers (Figure 3C). Usually, the
introduction of a frameshift is a dangerous event for a
gene, and indeed mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated
decay have evolved to prevent the generation of harmful
proteins [34]. However, a few cases of genes duplicated in
vertebrates that use frameshift as a mechanism to diversify
their function have been previously reported [35]. The
majority of these frameshifts originated through alternative splicing able to activate a different reading frame [35].
In the case of PRDM7, instead, the frameshift arose
through the duplication of an internal sequence. As for
the other reported cases [35], also the mRNA transcribed
by the PRDM7 gene is not a typical target for mRNA decay.
It is around 2000 nucleotide long and can code for a protein with KRAB and PR domains and a C-terminal region
of around 100 residues before encountering a stop codon
(Figure 3C). The isoform with the retention is detectable
in most of the tested samples, and it is particularly abundant in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines (Figure 4B).
Although more data are needed to confirm actual functional differences, one possible consequence of the lack of
Zn-Fingers could be a modified cellular localization. The
PRDM9 isoforms without Zn-Fingers are indeed not able
to reach cell nucleus [16]. In addition, the alternative Cterminal region of PRDM7 shows no similarity to any
sequence so far reported in sequence databases. It would
be interesting to check whether this region is associated to
the acquisition of any primate-specific function of the corresponding protein.

Methods
Detection of PRDM orthologs
To avoid the occurrence of aspecific hits due to the large
number of Zn-Fingers, we only used the N-terminal portion of the PRDM proteins for our analysis. As a first scan
of the presence of the PRDM genes in the 3 domains of
life, we used each human PRDM protein as query for
BLASTp [36] on the non-redundant database. To further
confirm the presence of PRDMs only in metazoans, we
searched the SMART database [37] for the entire repertoire
of proteins with the same domain architecture. Finally, we
searched the yeast genomes (sacSer1) using the 17 human
PR domains as queries for tBLASTn [36]. None of these
analyses returned a significant hit for the PRDM genes in
non-metazoan genomes.

We used different strategies to derive the orthologs of the
human PRDM genes in other 13 metazoans (Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus tropicalis, Takifugu rubripes, Ciona
intestinalis, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoscura, Caenorhabditis elegans, and
Caenorhabditis briggsae), in order to conduct an orthology

assignment as complete as possible. We started by extracting the reciprocal best hits for each PRDM proteins from
the output of all all-against-all pairwise BLASTp [36]
between human proteins and the protein set of each other
species (RefSeq Release 17, April 2006; WormPep v.150;
FlyBase 4.3). From the obtained results, we excluded the
hits matching on the same chromosomal locus representing likely splice variants or mispredictions. To further
enlarge the set of orthologs, we used the sequences of each
human PR domain as queries for tBLASTn [36] against the
different genome assemblies (human: hg18; chimp:
panTro2; macaque: rheMac2; mouse: mm8; rat: rn4;
chicken: galGal3; frog: xenTro2; fugu: fr1; ciona: ci2; sea
urchin: Spur_0.5; fly: dm2; D. pseudoscura: dp4; worm:
ce2; C. briggsae: cb1). The genomic region corresponding
to each best hit was extracted and used for the complete
gene prediction with GeneWise [38]. Each predicted
sequence was finally blasted back on the human protein
set to confirm the orthology relationship through the best
reciprocal method. In the cases where the ortholog was
still missing, we defined the syntenic blocks around the
PRDM genes in the UCSC human genome browser by
identifying the genes at their 5' and 3'. We then extracted
the corresponding regions in the target genome, and predicted the putative ortholog using GeneWise [38] and
Blast2Gene [39]. The complete set of the putative
orthologs is reported in the Additional file 1.
Concatenated alignment and tree reconstruction
We based the evolutionary reconstruction of the PRDM
family on the multiple alignment of the amino acidic
sequence of the PR-domains. These are, together with the
Zn-fingers, the only regions common to all members. Znfingers are however not suitable for the tree reconstruction
given their repetitive nature. From the entire set of
orthologs we only considered the sequences from seven
vertebrates (Human, Chimp, Mouse, Rat, Chicken, Fugu,
and Frog) and, among those, only the sequences for
which a complete PR domain was retrievable. The final set
of proteins used for the analysis was composed of 109
sequences, with representatives of each PRDM member in
all 7 species except for PRDM3 (missing in fugu),
PRDM17 (missing in fugu and chicken), and the non-primate PRDM7/9 (missing in chicken and frog).

For each PR domain of the different PRDM orthologous
groups, we built a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
using MUSCLE [40], with the maximum number of iterations set to 100. In the resulting seventeen MSAs, the
poorly aligned and divergent regions were eliminated
with Gblocks [41]. The reduced alignments were then
treated as separate profiles and re-aligned using MUSCLE
[40]. The resulting global supermatrix is composed of 181
positions (see Additional file 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/187

We derived Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic
inferences using PHYML [42], and applying the JTT
matrix. Our model of sequence evolution assumed that
there were two classes of sites, one class being invariable
and the other class being free to change. The rate variation
across these sites was assumed to follow a gamma shape
distribution calculated using a discrete approximation
with eight categories of sites. Support for the hypotheses
of relationships was assessed using 100 bootstrap replicates (see Additional file 4).
For the Bayesian inference, we used MrBayes [43] choosing the Jones substitution model and a gamma-shaped
variation across the sites with four categories. The analysis
was run for 500000 generations sampling the chain every
100 generations. To derive the final tree, we discarded the
first 30% of the samples after checking for the convergence of the analysis after 150000 generations (see Additional file 5).
Screening of PRDM gene expression in human tissues
Total RNAs derived from normal human tissues (bladder,
brain, breast, colon, fetal brain, fetal liver, kidney, liver,
lung, ovary, pancreas, placenta, prostate, spleen, stomach,
testis, thymus, thyroid and uterus) were obtained from
Clontech (Mountain View, Cal., USA). In the case of
hemopoietic precursor cells and human melanocytes, the
RNA was extracted from CD34+ (from healthy donors)
purified using standard procedures and from primary
melanocyte cultures, respectively.

The expression levels of the PRDM genes were assessed
using a custom TaqMan® Low Density Array (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Cal., USA). For each PRDM gene a
number of assays covering different regions of the transcript were used with 18S and GAPDH as reference genes
(see Additional file 2). PRDM12, 13, 14, 7 and 9 are
expressed only in very few tissues and, therefore, were not
considered for further analysis. In order to reduce the
technical variability due to the different efficiency of the
assays, for all other genes the Ct value of each assay was
plotted, and the corresponding trend in the different tissues was assessed (see Additional file 6). For each gene,
the mean value only of the assays with a comparable trend
was calculated and normalized using the reference genes.
Finally the 2-∆Ct was calculated and normalized to the
median of expression across each tissue (see Additional
file 7). The resulting values were ordered according to the
evolutionary divergence of the PRDM genes. We assessed
the statistical significance of the negative association
between gene expression level and speed of molecular
evolution by plotting the logarithm of the maximum
expression value for each PRDM gene against the corresponding distance to the root (Pearson correlation, r = 0.705, P = 0.01). To verify that the inverse relationship

between expression data and evolutionary divergence was
not due to an artifact, we treated the data from each single
array in a comparable manner. In all cases comparable
trends were obtained (data not shown).
RT-PCR and cloning of PRDM7-specific transcripts
Reverse transcription for subsequent PCR reactions was
performed with Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Amplification of PRDM7 long isoform was done using the high
fidelity Phusion DNA polymerase (Fynnzyme) and different combinations of primers located in the 5'UTR and 3'
UTR of the gene. Forward primers: PR7_9L-F1 (5'-TTCTAGACAGTCCCAGCACCATGA-3'), PR7L-F1 (5'-ACTCAGGGGCCCTTCCCACA-3'). Reverse primers: PR7L-R1 (5'TGCAAGTGTGTGGTGATCACGT-3'), PR7L-R2 (5'-GTGTGTGGTGATCACGTTTGTCTTCT-3'), PR7L-R3 (5'-TTACTCATCCTTCCTGCAGAC-3'). A collection of normal
tissues and commercial cancer cell lines was screened
together with Reference RNA (Clontech). This is a mixture
of total RNAs from a collection of adult human tissues,
chosen to represent a broad range of expressed genes.

The PCR products were purified on Wizard SV GEL and
PCR clean-up system (Promega) and, after overhangs
addition with DyNAzyme II DNA polymerase (Fynnzyme), they were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector
and transformed into TOP10 cells (TOPO TA cloning Kit,
Invitrogen). Positive clones were screened by PCR using
universal primers and sequenced. The region encompassing the duplicated sequence of PRDM7 was amplified
using the following set of primers: forward 5'-TCGGCCAACTGGATGAGGTATGT-3' and reverse 5'-TCCCTGCCATGAGCTCTTTCTT-3'.
