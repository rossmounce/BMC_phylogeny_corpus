Abstract
Background: Lipophorin receptors (LpRs) have been described in a number of insects, but
functional studies have been reported only in locusts and mosquitoes. The aim of the present work
was to characterize the LpR of the cockroach Blattella germanica, not only molecularly but also
functionally using RNAi techniques, and to place LpRs in a phylogenetical context among
lipoprotein receptors.
Results: We cloned a putative LpR from B. germanica (BgLpR) using RT-PCR methods. Two
isoforms of BgLpR that differ from each other by an insertion/deletion of 24 amino acids were
obtained from the fat body and the ovary. A phylogenetical analysis of lipoprotein receptors
showed that BgLpR grouped with other sequences annotated as LpR in a cluster placed as a sister
group of vertebrate low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) + lipoprotein receptor-related
proteins 8 (LPR8) + vitellogenin receptors (VgR) + very low density lipoprotein receptors
(VLDLR). The two BgLpR isoforms are expressed in different adult female tissues (fat body, ovary,
brain, midgut, muscle) and in embryos. In ovaries and fat body, the two isoforms are similarly
expressed during the first gonadotrophic cycle. mRNA levels in the fat body increase in parallel to
vitellogenesis, whereas they decrease in the ovaries. BgLpR protein levels increase in parallel to
vitellogenesis in both organs. Treatment with juvenile hormone increases BgLpR protein. RNAi
experiments show that females with lower BgLpR expression have less lipophorin in the growing
oocytes with respect to controls.
Conclusion: The two isoforms of BgLpR are structurally similar to other LpRs. Phylogenetical
analyses show that LpRs and the group formed by vertebrate LDLR + LPR8 + VgR + VLDLR,
diverged from a common ancestor and diversified in parallel. The different expression patterns in
the fat body and the ovary, comparing mRNA and protein, indicate that the corresponding
mechanisms regulating BgLpR expression are different. Experiments with JH III suggest that such a
hormone regulates the expression of BgLpR posttranscriptionally. RNAi experiments indicate that
BgLpR is a functional lipophorin receptor.

Background
Lipophorins are insect proteins mainly involved in lipid
transport, acting as a shuttle of lipids between different
tissues[1-3]. However, lipophorin has additionally been
related to other functions, for example, it plays a role as
juvenile hormone (JH) binding protein in certain species,
which suggests that it may contribute to the regulation of
JH titers in the hemolymph [4,5]. During vitellogenesis,
lipophorin transports lipids and other yolk precursors
from the fat body to the ovaries and, in some species, lipophorin itself takes part of the egg yolk platelets [6]. Lipophorin incorporates into cells through receptor mediated
endocytosis [7], and the first lipophorin receptor (LpR)
was molecularly and functionally characterized in the
locust, Locusta migratoria by Van der Horst's group [8].
Thereafter, cloning and sequencing of LpRs has been
reported for several insect species, such as the yellow fever
mosquito Aedes aegypti [9,10], the wax moth Galleria mellonella [11] and the silkworm Bombyx mori [12]. In A.
aegypti, two splice variants of LpR specific to the fat body
(LpRfb) and the ovary (LpRov) have been characterized
by Raikhel's group [9,10], and LpRfb (and lipophorin
itself) have shown to increase after immune challenge,
which suggests that lipid metabolism is involved in the
mosquito immune response [13].
In the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, lipophorin
is a high density lipoprotein with a molecular weight of
670 kDa, composed of two apolipoprotein subunits of
212 (ApoLp I) and 80 kDa (ApoLp II) [4]. As stated above,
the main role of lipophorins is transporting lipids
through the hemolymph, and cockroach lipophorins
have a substantial lipid fraction. In Periplaneta americana,
50% of lipophorin mass are lipids [14], and in B. germanica the lipid fraction represents 51% [4]. The occurrence of lipophorin in ovaries of B. germanica was
reported by Kunkel and Pan in 1976 [15], and specific
estimations of ovarian lipophorin contents were later
published by Schal and coworkers [4,16], who additionally studied the role of lipophorin as hydrocarbon carrier
from the hemolymph to the oocyte.

incorporation into growing oocytes, following RNA interference (RNAi) experimental approaches.

Results
Primary structure and organization of BgLpR
A fragment of B. germanica LpR cDNA was cloned by RTPCR using ovarian and female fat body tissues as templates, and degenerate primers based on conserved motifs
of known LpR sequences. Then, 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was used to obtain two fulllength sequences of 3,120 and 3,195 nucleotides, which
encoded each of two proteins of 863 and 887 aa, with predicted molecular masses of 96.6 and 99.2 kDa, respectively. The two cDNAs encoded identical proteins except
for an insertion/deletion of 24 amino acids (Fig. 1A).

The present work aimed to characterize the LpR of B. germanica (BgLpR) in the fat body as well as in the ovary, not
only regarding the receptor structure and organization,
but also studying the function in the context of vitellogenesis. From a structural point of view, the obtained
sequence of BgLpR was characterized in terms of organization and comparison with other LpRs. In addition, a phylogenetical analysis of lipoprotein receptors led to place
LpRs in an evolutionary context. Furthermore, we determined the expression patterns of BgLpR in the fat body
and the ovary during vitellogenesis, we studied the influence of JH on BgLpR expression, and we demonstrated the
function of BgLpR as receptor mediating lipophorin

BLAST analysis against databases suggested that the two
proteins are LpR orthologues. Therefore, they were called
BgLpR-S (B. germanica LpR, short form, Accession number
GenBank™: AM403064; CAL47126) and BgLpR-L (B. germanica LpR, long form, Accession number GenBank™:
AM403063; CAL47125).
The putative start codon is preceded by an in-frame stop
codon, indicating that these sequences represent fulllength ORFs. Conceptual translation showed that both
potential proteins (Fig. 1A) have a signal peptide (1–22
aa), followed by a ligand binding domain (LBD) with
seven cysteine rich repeats, preceding an epidermal
growth factor (EGF) precursor homology domain, with
type A, B and C cysteine rich repeats, containing the (Y/
F)WXD repeats in number of five. The EGF precursor
homology domain is followed by an O-linked sugar
region; in this region, both BgLpR isoforms differ by the
insertion/deletion of 24 aa (Fig. 1A). In the BgLpR-S there
is one NX [S/T] motif for the N-linked glycosilation of
asparagine, whereas in the BgLpR-L there are two of such
motifs. Of these two motifs, that which is closer to the 3'
end is positioned 15 aa from the transmembrane domain,
a distance which suffices for the glycosilation of asparagine [17]. Then, there is a transmembrane domain, rich in
aliphatic residues and with a GXXXG motif that breaks the
α helix that could be formed by them. Finally, there is a
cytoplasmic domain having the clathrin-coated pit internalization motif FDNPVY. Possible sites for co-and posttranslational modification other than the O-linked sugar
region, include 10 N-linked glycosylation sites (containing the consensus motif NXS/T) and 53 putative phosphorylation sites (predicted with the NetPhos program [18])
on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues.
The organization and the primary structure of BgLpR were
compared with LpRs of other insects (Fig. 1B). BgLpR was
most similar to the cockroach Leucophaea maderae LpR
with 81% of overall identity, and 92% identity when comparing the EGF precursor homology domain. Identity
with respect to LpRs of insects belonging to other orders
was lower (between 74 and 49% overall identity, and 90–
78% when comparing the EGF precursor homology
domain) (Fig. 1B).
Evolutionary relationship of the BgLpR and other
lipoprotein receptors
In order to place the BgLpR in an evolutionary context, we
carried out a phylogenetical analysis of lipoprotein receptors available in the literature and databases. Using maximum-likelihood approaches, and the so-called yolk
receptor (RME-2) of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
and the vitellogenin receptor (VgR) of the tick Dermacentor variabilis as out-groups, we obtained the tree shown in
figure 2. BgLpR fall into a strongly supported (100% boot-

srap value) cluster of insect LpRs. This cluster is the sister
group of another strongly supported cluster (100% boostrap value) formed by vertebrate LDLR + LRP8 + vertebrate
VgR-VLDLR. The consistency of the LpR cluster allows to
annotate the Anopheles gambiae (GenBank™: XP_307995)
and Tribolium castaneum (GenBank™: XP_967944)
sequences as LpRs. Interestingly, insect VgRs appear as a
very external cluster, being the sister group of all the
remaining lipoprotein receptors. The general good support of the all nodes allows to annotate the sequences of
Apis mellifera (GenBank™: XP_393369) and Drosophila
pseudoobscura (GenBank™: EAL32723) as megalin-like, the
sequence of Tetraodon
nigroviridis
(GenBank™:
CAF92585.1) as LDLR, that of Danio rerio (GenBank™:
AAH47187, labeled as VLDLR), as fish VgR, and the
sequence GenBank™: XP_968903.1 of T. castaneum, as
insect VgR.
BgLpR mRNA expression
Expression studies of BgLpR in terms of mRNA were carried out by RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting, using
a primer pair that amplifies the two isoforms. The weight
of the amplified fragments was in agreement with the
expected lengths: 756 bp for BgLpR-S and 828 bp for
BgLpR-L. The two isoforms were detected in all tissues
analyzed, namely fat body, ovary, brain, midgut, muscle,
as well as in embryos (not shown).

In the fat body, mRNA expression of the two isoforms
during the vitellogenic cycle follow the same pattern, with
low levels from day 0 to 3 (previtellogenesis), and higher
levels from day 4 to 7 (vitellogenesis) and 7c (choriogenesis) (Fig. 3A). The relatively high intensity of the LpR
bands on day 0 is due to loading differences as shown by
densitometry data with reference to the actin 5c band. In
the ovary, BgLpR-L mRNA levels are high at the beginning
of the adult stage but decrease thereafter, being very low
on days 6 and 7 and during choriogenesis (7c) (Fig. 3A).
Those of BgLpR-S are very low during the first days,
increase slightly in mid-vitellogenesis (days 3, 4 and 5)
and decrease on days 6 and 7 (Fig. 3A).
BgLpR protein levels
Firstly, a specific antibody for BgLpR was obtained on the
basis of a recombinant LpR fragment corresponding to the
EGF precursor domain (from aa 394 to 579), which is
exclusive of insect LpRs, and which was used to immunize
New Zealand female rabbits. Using crude extracts of fat
body and Western blotting, the antibody recognized a single band with a molecular weight between 97 and 116
kDa (Fig. 3B). The suitability of the antibody for BgLpR
recognition was further validated with RNAi experiments.
Newly emerged adult females were treated with 10 µg of
dsRNA targeting BgLpR (dsBgLpR), and fat body tissues
were extracted 6 days later and analyzed in terms of

dramatically decreased, as expected, whereas Western
blotting showed that the 97–116 kDa band also resulted
greatly reduced (Fig. 3C), which indicates that the band
correspond to BgLpR protein.

from day 2 onwards. In the ovaries, the pattern of BgLpR
protein (Fig. 3D) is similar to that in the fat body, with
low levels in previtellogenic stages, and higher levels during vitellogenesis and choriogenesis. This pattern contrasts with that of ovarian mRNA (Fig. 3A), which is
practically the reverse.

roughly parallel to that of mRNA (Fig. 3A), with low levels

Effects of JH on BgLpR expression
BgLpR protein patterns in the fat body and in the ovary are
roughly parallel to the profile of JH production [19]. This
suggests that JH may play a regulatory role on BgLpR
expression. To test this hypothesis, we treated newly
emerged females with 10 µg of JH III, and we examined
BgLpR levels (mRNA and protein) in the fat body and the
ovaries 48 h later. mRNA levels were not affected by the
treatment in either of the two tissues (Fig. 4). Conversely,
BgLpR protein levels were higher in the specimens treated
with JH, especially in the fat body (Fig. 4). Moreover, JH

to BgLpR protein. D) Western-blot analysis showing the
BgLpR protein pattern in the fat body and the ovary. In the
case of fat body, 10 µg of total proteins were loaded in each
lane. In that of ovaries, 0.02 ovary equivalents were loaded in
each lane. In the later gel, we loaded low amounts of tissue
and we exposed the film longer than usual to avoid the
"pressing" effect of the huge vitellin band placed just above
that of LpR. In films that are exposed even longer, LpR can be
also detectable on the days 0, 1 and 2. Blots shown are representative of three replicates.

treatment also increased lipophorin levels (estimated in
terms of apolipoprotein I) in both tissues (Fig. 4).
Fat Body

Interfering BgLpR expression by RNAi
In order to assess experimentally the function of BgLpR,
we carried out RNAi experiments. Interference of BgLpR
should presumably lead to a phenotype with less lipophorin, at least in growing oocytes. Firstly, we aimed at
checking whether RNAi would decrease BgLpR mRNA levels. Therefore, 10 µg of dsBgLpR were injected into newly
emerged adult females, and mRNA levels were examined
1, 3 and 6 days after the treatment in the fat body and in
the ovaries. In the fat body, BgLpR mRNA levels decreased
ca. 60% 1 day after the treatment, became very low (ca.
90% of reduction) on day 3, and slightly increased on day
6 (ca. 75% of reduction) (Fig. 5). In the ovary, lowering of
BgLpR mRNA levels after RNAi treatment proceeded more
slowly. One day after the treatment mRNA levels were
similar to controls, but on days 3 and 6, they decreased
progressively, reaching ca. 60% reduction on day 6 (Fig.
5).

In control females, lipophorin levels in the fat body are
quite constant, comparing days 1, 3 and 6 (Fig. 5). In dsBgLpR-treated specimens, lipophorin levels were not
reduced in the fat body, and even increased slightly on day
6, with respect to controls (Fig. 5). In the ovary of control
specimens, lipophorin content increased progressively
from day 1 to day 6, as described previously [4]. In contrast with the fat body, lipophorin levels were reduced in
the ovary 6 days after the treatment with dsBgLpR (Fig. 5),
that is when reduction of BgLpR mRNA levels were maximal (Fig. 5).
In spite of having less lipophorin in the ovary, dsBgLpRtreated specimens had no special problems of fertility. In
6-day-old specimens, basal oocyte length was 1.75 ± 0.04
mm (n = 22) in controls, and 1.65 ± 0.03 mm (n = 25) in
dsBgLpR-treated specimens (differences not statistically
significant, t-test: P < 0.05). Treated females oviposited
and formed the ootheca one day later than controls, but
the shape of the ootheca was identical in both groups. The
number of nymphs emerging from the ootheca was 40.70
± 4.02 (n = 7) in controls, and 38.50 ± 2.32 (n = 8) in dsBgLpR-treated specimens (differences not statistically significant, t-test: P < 0.05). Nymphs emerging from the
second ootheca were 33.20 ± 4.85 (n = 5) in controls, and
35.43 ± 1.78 (n = 7) in dsBgLpR-treated specimens (differences not statistically significant, t-test: P < 0.05).

Discussion
Two LpR showing the typical organization of a lipoprotein receptor have been cloned and sequenced from the
cockroach B. germanica. The two sequences (BgLpR-S and
BgLpR-L) differ only by an insertion/deletion of 24 aa

located in the O-linked sugar domain. With the exception
of these 24 aa, the two BgLpR sequences are identical, not
only in terms of amino acids, but also at level of nucleotide sequence, which suggests that they are splice variants of the same gene. Splice variants differing by a short
insertion/deletion in the O-linked sugar domain have
been also described in the LpR of A. aegypti [9,10], G. mellonella [11] and B. mori [12]. Whereas most of the available insect LpRs have eight cysteine rich repeats within the
LBD, the two BgLpR isoforms have only seven. The fat
body-specific LpR of A. aegypti and the single LpR reported
in D. melanogaster [10,20,21] have also seven cysteine rich
repeats, and this has led to propose that the later could be

fat body-specific [10]. However, the case of B. germanica
shows that the occurrence of only seven repeats do not
define fat body specificity, because BgLpR-S and BgLpR-L
are expressed irrespectively in the fat body and in the
ovary (as well as in brain, midgut, muscle and embryo tissues).
Maximum-likelihood phylogenetical analyses show that
LpRs form a monophyletic group, and that LpRs and the
cluster formed by vertebrate LDLR + LPR8 + VgR + VLDLR
are sister groups. Rodenburg and coworkers [20] proposed that LDLR proteins can be classified on the basis of
the amino acid sequence of their C-terminal domains. The
analysis reported by these authors is represented by an
unrooted tree, but the clusters obtained are similar to
those described herein. The main difference between
these two studies is that we used more sequences (including insect VgRs), and that our rooted tree allows a more
visual reconstruction of the molecular evolution of the
sequences involved.
In the fat body, mRNA levels of both BgLpR isoforms
increase with time during the first vitellogenic cycle,
whereas they decrease in the ovary. This suggests that the
mechanisms regulating BgLpR expression differ in these
two organs. Conversely, BgLpR protein levels increase in
parallel to vitellogenesis either in the fat body as well as in
the ovary [22]. In the ovary, the BgLpR pattern also resembles that of vitellogenin receptor (BgVgR) expression [23].
Using Western blotting, the antibody developed in the
present work recognized a single band with a molecular
weight between 97 and 116 kDa, which is slightly higher
than that predicted for the heavier BgLpR-L isoform (96.6
kDa), a difference that might be due to posttranslational
modifications. RNAi of BgLpR resulted in a clear decrease
of this band, which indicates that it corresponds to BgLpR.
The fact that only a single band is revealed by the antibody
suggests that only one of the isoforms is translated, as
occurs in the LpR of G. mellonella, were only the splice variant containing the full O-linked sugar domain is translated into the receptor protein [21]. We cannot exclude
the possibility that the isoform not present in the fat body
and the ovary is translated and plays a tissue-specific role
in other tissues or stages were BgLpR is transcribed (brain,
midgut, muscle, embryos).
Treatment with JH increased the levels of BgLpR protein,
especially in the fat body, but not those of BgLpR mRNA.
Posttranscriptional effect of JH upon BgLpR could be
related to mRNA stability, mRNA transport or the own
translation rate. Antecedents of posttranscriptional effects
of JH on protein expression have been described in A.
aegypti. In this mosquito, JH enhances the synthesis of
8FTZ-F1, an orphan nuclear receptor involved in the
acquisition of competence to 20-hydroxyecdysone by the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/53

fat body to produce vitellogenin [24]. In G. mellonella,
production of LpR protein is also hormonally enhanced,
but by 20-hydroxyecdysone [21]. Our experiments also
showed that JH-treated specimens had higher levels of
lipophorin, estimated in terms of apolipophorin I
(ApoLpI). However, this likely derive from the increased
levels of BgLpR, given that JH do not seem to regulate
lipophorin levels directly [4,5], although in the ovary,
higher levels of ApoLpI can also be due to the enhanced
basal oocyte growth provoked by the treatment with JH.
In order to demonstrate the function of BgLpR as lipophorin receptor, we interfered BgLpR expression by systemic RNAi, studying the effects in the ovary and the fat
body. In the ovary, BgLpR mRNA levels decreased progressively after the treatment with dsBgLpR, and on day 6 they
were clearly lower than in controls (60%). On the same
day, lipophorin levels in the ovary of dsBgLpR-treated
females were much lower than in controls, as expected. In
controls, and as previously described [4], lipophorin contents in the ovary increase in parallel to vitellogenesis. The
situation in the fat body is more complex, because this
organ not only internalizes but also synthesizes lipophorins. Three days after the treatment with dsBgLpR,
BgLpR mRNA levels practically vanished in the fat body,
but lipophorin levels were almost indistinguishable from
controls. Three days later, levels of BgLpR mRNA and lipophorin contents increased. This double increase suggests
that knockdown effects began to disappear. Expression
recovery of the target gene after dsRNA treatment, which
has been described in other systems, like in the eye color
gene vermilion in the locust Schistocerca gregaria [25], suggests that RNAi must be used carefully when suspecting
that the resulting phenotype can be transient.

Conclusion
RNAi experiments demonstrate that the BgLpR cloned
and sequenced in B. germanica is a functional lipophorin
receptor. Expression studies and experiments with JH,
suggest that expression of BgLpR is posttranscriptionally
regulated by this hormone. Phylogenetical analysis indicates that insect LpRs form a well supported monophyletic group. Our functional studies on a cockroach
based on RNAi, together with functional studies based on
biochemical approaches on locusts and mosquitoes,
strongly supports the notion that the LpR group is formed
by functionally active lipophorin receptors.

Methods
Insects
Specimens of B. germanica were obtained from a colony
reared in the dark at 30 ± 1°C and 60–70% r.h. Freshly
ecdysed adult females were selected and used at appropriate ages. All dissections and tissue sampling were carried
out on carbon dioxide-anaesthetized specimens.

Cloning and sequencing
Degenerate primers based on conserved sequences of the
EGF precursor homology domain of the LpR of A. aegypti
and L. migratoria were used to obtain a B. germanica
homologue cDNA fragment by PCR amplification using
cDNA template generated by reverse transcription from
polyA+ RNA from 3-day-old adult ovaries. The amplified
fragment (930 bp) was subcloned into pSTBlue™-1 vector
(Novagen Madrid, Spain) and sequenced. To complete
the BgLpR cDNA sequences, 5'- and 3'-RACE were applied
to polyA+ RNA extracted from ovaries and fat body using
a 5'- and 3'-RACE system Version 2.0 (Invitrogen, Paisley,
UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, cloned into pSTBlue™-1 vector and sequenced. For 5'RACE, reverse primers were as follows: LpR-R1 (position
1294–1314), 5'-AGCGAACAGAAGAGAGGCATG-3', and
nested LpR-R2 (position 1271–1291), 5'-CTTCCATGGCTTTACATCTCG-3'. For 3'-RACE, forward primer was
as follows: LpR-F1 (position 1601–1622) 5'-TCGAGGGCAACATGAGGAAGAT-3'.

regions were eliminated by using Gblocks 0.91b [27]. The
resulting alignment was analyzed by the PHYML program
[28] based on the maximum-likelihood principle with the
amino acid substitution model. Four substitution rate categories with a gamma shape parameter of 1.444 were
used. The data was bootstrapped for 100 replicates using
PHYML.
RT-PCR/Southern blot analyses
Temporal profiles of transcript variation for the two
BgLpR isoforms were carried out on ovary and fat body tissues using RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting with
specific probes. For each determination, ovary or fat body
total RNA from pools of four to six individuals were isolated using the Gen Elute Mammalian Total RNA kit
(Sigma, Madrid, Spain). An amount of 400 ng of each
RNA extraction was DNAse treated (Promega Biotech
Iberica. Madrid, Spain) and reverse transcribed with
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Promega). PCR amplification of the two
BgLpR isoforms was carried out simultaneously in a single
reaction containing the following primers: forward 5'TCGCCCGATGCCTTGCAACA-3' and reverse 5'-TACCACTTGGCGCATTCTATG-3'. As a reference, the same
cDNAs were subjected to RT-PCR/Southern blotting with
a primer pair specific to B. germanica actin5C [29]. cDNA

probes for Southern blot analyses were generated by PCR
with the same primer pairs, using plasmid DNA containing the corresponding cDNA clones as template. The
probes were labeled with fluorescein with the Gene
Images random prime-labeling module from GE Healthcare (Barcelona, Spain). RT-PCR followed by Southern
blotting of total RNA without reverse transcription was
carried out in parallel to assess that there was not genomic
contamination.
BgLpR antibody
A 556 bp DNA fragment (from aa 394 to aa 579), corresponding to EGF precursor homology domain of the
BgLpR (a domain which is exclusive of insect LpRs) was
chosen to produce a BgLpR recombinant fragment to generate the corresponding polyclonal antibody. The restriction enzyme sites EcoRI and XhoI were added to the
specific primers used to amplify the fragment. The PCR
amplified fragment was cloned into pSTBlue™-1 vector
and sequenced. Then, it was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with EcoRI and XhoI and directionally ligated into pET28a(+) expression vector from
Novagen. E. coli BL21(DE3)plysS competent cells were
used for plasmid transformation. The transformed bacteria were selected by screening the colonies on media containing 30 µg/ml of kanamycin. Colonies were further
analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and PCR. Bacteria were grown until the OD600nm reached 0.6 and were
induced with 0.8 mM of IPTG for 3 h. The expressed protein was purified using Ni-NTA from Qiagen (Barcelona,
Spain) column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified recombinant BgLpR fragment was
quantified [30], and quality was tested by SDS-PAGE 13%
stained with Coomassie blue. The eluted 21 kDa band was
homogenized in Ringer solution, emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant, and used to boost New Zealand
female rabbits.
Characterization of the antibody and immunoblot
analyses
For immunoblot analyses, ovaries and fat bodies were dissected under Ringer solution, frozen with liquid N2 and
preserved at -80°C until use. For protein extraction, tissues were homogenized in 100 µl of a buffer composed of
100 mM sucrose, 40 mM K2HPO4 pH 7.2, 30 mM EDTA,
50 mM KCl, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM DTT and
0.5 mM proteases inhibitor cocktail (Roche diagnostics.
Barcelona, Spain). After measuring the protein contents of
homogenates [30], suramine (Sigma) (5 mM) was added
to inhibit the binding of lipophorin to its receptor, and
incubation was left to proceed during 1 h. Homogenates
were analyzed in 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels under denaturing
conditions and loading the same protein quantity in both
ovary and fat body. Gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel-Ger-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/53

many), incubated with BgLpR antibody (see above)
(serum was used at 1:8,000) for 2 h, or with B. germanica
ApoLpI antibody (a gift from C. Schal) (1:16,000) for 1 h
to detect lipophorin in terms ApoLpI [4], and then were
processed with SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL), following the manufacturer's instructions.
Juvenile hormone experiments
Newly emerged adult females were topically treated with
10 µg of racemic JH III (Sigma) in 1 µl acetone. Controls
received the same volume of acetone. Ovaries and fat
body were explanted 48 h after the treatment, in order to
examine the effects of JH on BgLpR mRNA and protein.
RNAi experiments
To obtain a dsRNA targeted to BgLpR mRNA (dsBgLpR), a
556 bp fragment corresponding to EGF precursor homology domain of BgLpR (from aa 398 to aa 581) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pSTBlue™-1 vector. As
control dsRNA, we used a non-coding sequence from the
pSTBlue-1 vector (dsControl)[31]. Single stranded sense
and antisense RNAs were obtained by transcription in
vitro using either SP6 or T7 RNA polymerases from the
respective plasmids, and resuspended in water. To generate the dsRNAs, equimolar amounts of sense and antisense RNAs were mixed, heated at 95°C for 10 min,
cooled slowly to room temperature and stored at -20°C
until use. Formation of dsRNA was confirmed by running
1 µl of the reaction products in 1% agarose gel. The
obtained dsBgLpR was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and diluted in Ringer saline at a concentration of 5 µg/µl. In all experiments, a single dose of
10 µg was injected into the abdomen of newly emerged
females, and the effects were examined at different times
during the first and the second reproductive cycle.

Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
