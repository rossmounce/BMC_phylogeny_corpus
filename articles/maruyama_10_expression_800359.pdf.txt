Abstract
Background: Ticks secrete a cement cone composed of many salivary proteins, some of which are rich in the amino acid
glycine in order to attach to their hosts' skin. Glycine-rich proteins (GRPs) are a large family of heterogeneous proteins that have
different functions and features; noteworthy are their adhesive and tensile characteristics. These properties may be essential for
successful attachment of the metastriate ticks to the host and the prolonged feeding necessary for engorgement. In this work,
we analyzed Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) similar to GRPs from cDNA libraries constructed from salivary glands of adult
female ticks representing three hard, metastriate species in order to verify if their expression correlated with biological
differences such as the numbers of hosts ticks feed on during their parasitic life cycle, whether one (monoxenous parasite) or
two or more (heteroxenous parasite), and the anatomy of their mouthparts, whether short (Brevirostrata) or long (Longirostrata).
These ticks were the monoxenous Brevirostrata tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, a heteroxenous Brevirostrata tick,
Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and a heteroxenous Longirostrata tick, Amblyomma cajennense. To further investigate this relationship,
we conducted phylogenetic analyses using sequences of GRPs from these ticks as well as from other species of Brevirostrata
and Longirostrata ticks.
Results: cDNA libraries from salivary glands of the monoxenous tick, R. microplus, contained more contigs of glycinerich proteins than the two representatives of heteroxenous ticks, R. sanguineus and A. cajennense (33 versus,
respectively, 16 and 11). Transcripts of ESTs encoding GRPs were significantly more numerous in the salivary glands of
the two Brevirostrata species when compared to the number of transcripts in the Longirostrata tick. The salivary gland
libraries from Brevirostrata ticks contained numerous contigs significantly similar to silks of true spiders (17 and 8 in,
respectively, R. microplus and R. sanguineus), whereas the Longirostrata tick contained only 4 contigs. The phylogenetic
analyses of GRPs from various species of ticks showed that distinct clades encoding proteins with different biochemical
properties are represented among species according to their biology.
Conclusions: We found that different species of ticks rely on different types and amounts of GRPs in order to attach
and feed on their hosts. Metastriate ticks with short mouthparts express more transcripts of GRPs than a tick with long
mouthparts and the tick that feeds on a single host during its life cycle contain a greater variety of these proteins than
ticks that feed on several hosts.

Background
In order to acquire a blood meal, Ixodid (hard) ticks
secrete diverse salivary proteins that inhibit their hosts'
defense mechanisms and permit hematophagy to proceed for many days [1]. But ticks must first attach to the
skin of their hosts and attachment must be effective for
the duration of the tick's blood meal. Ixodid ticks are classified by the number of different hosts they feed on during the parasitic phase of their life cycle; one host, two
hosts or three hosts. Ticks that complete the entire parasitic cycle on one host are monoxenous parasites,
whereas tick that feed on two or more different hosts
with an interval off the host between the feeds are heteroxenous. Success of attachment on one or more hosts
depends, among other factors, on the salivary proteins
that are believed to form cement cones. These structures
fix tick mouthparts to the host's skin and possibly disguise and/or lubricate them [2]. The architecture of the
cement cone depends on the both the depth of penetration of the tick's hypostome into the host's skin and the
degree to which cement encases the hypostome. The cattle tick, Rhipicepahalus microplus, and the brown dog
tick, R. sanguineus, are classified as Brevirostrata ticks
because their mouthparts are short and barely penetrate
into the epidermis of theirs hosts. These parts are therefore assisted by a wide cement cone that reaches more
deeply into this layer of skin and also extrudes the epidermis [3]. Consequently, the cement cone of Brevirostrata
ticks tends to be wide and deep, completely surrounding
the hypostome and extruding above the epidermis of the
host skin [4]. Histological cross-sections of an adult R.
sanguineus attached to a dog clearly illustrate the superficial penetration of the hyposotome and the extensive
cement cone which appears to "glue" the mouthparts in
place [5]. R. microplus is a monoxenous tick and its life
cycle, spent on a single host, is of approximately 21 days;
R. sanguineus is a heteroxenous tick. Conversely, Amblyomma cajennense, also a heteroxenous parasite, is a Longirostrata tick with its long hypostome fully penetrating
well into its host's dermis and encased by a narrow
cement cone [3]. Several salivary proteins present in the
tick's cement cone are rich in glycine (glycine-rich proteins, GRPs) [3,6,7]. GRPs are abundant in nature and
constitute a large family of heterogeneous proteins
enriched in glycine residues by various proportions,
occupying from 20% to 70% of the total amino acid residues of the protein. GRPs can be classified into several
groups based on their molecular structure [8,9].
During the course of our studies of the transcriptome of
salivary glands from R. microplus, R. sanguineus and A.
cajennense we annotated different types of GRPs and
observed that these contigs represent from 3 to over 6%
of the total number, higher than any other class of protein. Furthermore, we observed that the distribution and

Page 2 of 17

abundance of the contigs and the number of transcripts
that form them differed according to the species. Since
proteins isolated from the cement cone are rich in glycine
and this structure may have a role in attachment and
since the various species of ticks have different requirements for attachment, herein we perform initial tests of
the hypothesis that there are not only anatomical, but
also chemical differences between the cement cones produced by these three species of ticks. These differences
could vary according to their biology, such as whether
they infest one or more hosts and whether anatomy of
their mouthparts comprises short or long hypostomes.
We constructed three non-normalized, PCR-based
cDNA libraries from the salivary glands of female R. sanguineus, R. microplus and A. cajennense and analyzed the
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) obtained using customized bioinformatics software. We observed that the
expression of contigs and their transcripts coding for glycine-rich proteins differed in quantity as well in diversity,
depending on the species of the tick. In order to further
test this hypothesis we also performed a phylogenetic
analysis using the sequences from our work as well as of
publicly available sequences from all the available sialomes of other species of heteroxenous and Longirostrata
or Brevistrata ticks that have been annotated as GRPs.

Results and Discussion
Library Construction

A total of 1440 plaque phages were sequenced from each
of the three salivary gland libraries to generate 5'
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). A total of approximately 2,900 high quality sequences, including 1,152
from the salivary glands of female R. microplus (SGFRm),
824 from salivary glands of female R. sanguineus (SGFRs)
and 929 from salivary glands of female A. cajennense
(SGFAc). Redundant sequences were clustered into
related groups using BLASTN and then assembled into
contiguous sequences yielding 1,406 unique contigs of
which 245 were derived from two or more ESTs (transcripts) and 1,165 were derived from a single EST (singleton). As seen in Table 1, GRPs are abundantly expressed
in the salivary glands, ranging from 3- 6% of the total contigs sequenced from these libraries. The SGFRm library
contained more ESTs similar to genes coding for GRPs
than the other two libraries. The SGFRm and SGFRs
libraries exhibit a similar number of ESTs for GRPs (57
and 47 ESTs, respectively), but comparing the number of
unique contigs similar to GRPs, SGFRm contained almost
double the number (n = 33) of unique contigs as SGFRs
(n = 16) and triple that of SGFAc (n = 11). This finding
shows that saliva of R. microplus, a Brevirostrata, onehost tick, contains twice as many different GRPs than the
other two species of ticks examined herein, one a Brevirostrata, three host tick, the other a Longirostrata, three

host tick. The SGFAc library contained approximately the
same proportion of unique GRP contigs as the SGFRs
library, however these are formed by fewer ESTs (23) relative to the other two libraries (57 and 47 ESTs, from
SGFRm and SGFRs, respectively).
Comparison of library-derived glycine rich proteins to
published and custom databases

Comparsion of the contigs from the three libraries with a
customized database of all Arachnida proteins found in
Genbank revealed that 60 contigs had similarities with 21
different types of GRP, based on published annotated
sequences (Table 2). Contigs were considered to encode
GRPs if the translated amino acid sequence contained a
glycine content of at least 20% (with three exceptions
among the 60 unique contigs, which contained 11 and
17% glycine). The most abundant GRP (41 total ESTs)
found among all three libraries was a 506 amino acid protein containing 25% glycine obtained from R. haemaphysaloides and annotated as "unknown function".
Flagelliform silk proteins (~50% glycine), identified from
various spider species, was the second most abundant
GRP found among the three libraries (n = 23 ESTs). Proteins annotated as cement and cement-like proteins from
H. longicornis, I. scapularis and R. appendiculatus were
also commonly observed among the three libraries (Table
2).
Comparing the BLAST results of the three libraries
shows that, with 33 contigs representing 57 ESTs, R.
microplus contained the most abundant contigs homologous to GRPs as compared to 11 contigs from A. cajennenes and 16 contigs from R. sanguineus. Salivary glands
from R. microplus also contained the greatest variety of
GRP with contigs homologous to 11 different GRPs
whereas A. cajennense and R. sanguineus salivary glands
contained 9 and 8 different GRPs, respectively (Table 2).
Differential expression of GRPs in Brevirostrata and
Longistrata, and monoxenous and heteroxenous ticks

As reported above, the distribution of GRPs in three Ixodid ticks differed according to the species. In order to
better display this distribution, Figure 1 shows a Venn

diagram of the numbers of GRP ESTs and types of GRPs
(numbers in parentheses) found in common among the
three species of ticks studied herein. Figure 1 also shows
the number of GRP ESTs and types of GRPs that are
unique to each species. More GRP ESTs are expressed
uniquely in the salivary glands of females of R. microplus
(14 versus 3 and 2 ESTs for, respectively A. cajannense
and R. sanguineus). These transcripts represented 8
unique types of GRPs in R. microplus, whereas R. sanguineus and A. cajannense each presented only unique 1
type of GRP. On the other hand, only two GRPs (from a
total of 21 types) were common to all three species of
ticks and were represented by 50 ESTs (Figure 1 and
Table 2). We also analyzed the distribution of 21 types of
GRPs among the three libraries. As shown in Figure 1, R.
microplus contained almost twice as many types of GRPs
than R. sanguineus or A. cajennense [SGFRm: 16 types of
GRPs; SGFRs and SGFAc: 9 types of GRPs each (see numbers in parentheses)]; R. microplus contains twice the
amount of contigs encoding GRPs (SGFRm, SGFRs and
SGFAc contained 33, 16 and 11 contigs of GRPs, respectively).
A protein previously described in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides haemaphysaloides (gi 45479213), annotated as of "unknown function", represented the class of
GRP with which the majority of ESTs in the 3 libraries
presented similarity (Table 2). Over half of these transcripts derived from the library from R. microplus salivary glands (21 from SGFRm, 10 from SGFRs and 10
from SGFAc). Interestingly, the SGFRm library does not
present any EST with similarity to salivary gland-associated protein 64P from Rhipicephalus appendiculatus
ticks (gi 20069012), at least on the first 10 best hits, contrary to what was found for SGFRs and SGFAc. 64P is a
GRP of interest because it is a potentially protective antigen for some species of host [7,10]. The amino acid
sequence of the 64P secreted salivary protein is similar to
epidermal/dermal keratin and collagen proteins, which
are mammalian structural proteins of the skin [8,11], and
salivary homologues are present in several species of ticks
[7].

* Computation of glycine content was calculated based on translated consensus sequence

As noted above, the annotation of the three cDNA
libraries using the BLAST results permitted us to observe
that the libraries and some contigs contained fewer or
more transcripts and sequences coding for proteins similar to GRPs than expected from a random distribution, as
evaluated with the χ2 or Fisher exact tests. Table 3 presents the distribution of all transcripts coding for the
GRPs observed among the three salivary gland libraries

from females of the tick species studied herein, R.
microplus, R. sanguineus and A. cajennense. SGFRm and
SGFRs libraries contain significantly (P = 0.006 and P =
0.003, respectively; χ2 test) more transcripts coding for all
types of GRPs than the SGFAc library; transcripts for
GRPs were equally represented in the SGFRm and SGFRs
libraries (P = 0.821, χ2 test). These results show that for
Brevirostrata ticks, R. microplus and R. sanguineus, the

protein (GRP) ESTs among three species of hard ticks, A. cajennense, R. sanguineus and R. microplus. Numbers in parentheses represent types of GRP according to the classification in Table 2.

expression in salivary glands of all types of GRPs was significantly higher than in those of a Longirostrata tick (A.
cajennense). The R. microplus salivary gland library contained more types and transcripts of proteins similar to
GRPs than the SGFRs, but the difference in the proportions of the GRPs did not quite reach significance with
the present depth of sequencing (P = 0.072, χ2 test; Table
3). Nevertheless, these results show that a Brevirostrata,
monoxenous tick, which remains attached to the same
host for at least three weeks, relies on a greater variety of
GRPs than the Brevirostrata heteroxenous tick examined
in this study. On the other hand, the library from R.
microplus contained significantly (P = 0.015, χ2 test) more
transcripts of GRPs than the library from the salivary
glands of the Longirostrata, heteroxenous tick, A. cajennense (Table 3). This finding suggests that in order to feed
on a single host for up to three weeks, monoxenous ticks
with short mouthparts must be equipped to deal with a
larger repertoire of the host's local homeostatic mechanisms. It is noteworthy that by the time the monoxenous
tick R. microplus completes its blood meal its host will
have mounted an adaptive immune response. The greater
diversity of GRPs in this species may reflect a form of
antigenic variation.
We also observed that the distribution of ESTs within
some contigs was greater in a given species of tick. Contig
29 from SGFRm, coding for a protein similar to an
"unknown" protein from R. h. haemaphysaloides ticks
(Genbank accession: gi 45479213), was the most abundant transcript among the three libraries and the most
abundant in the SGFRm library, with 21 ESTs versus 10
ESTs in both the SGFRs and SGFAc libraries, however it

was not differentially represented among the three ticks
(Table 3). A contig coding for a GRP similar to "acanthoscurrin 1 precursor" from Acanthoscurria gomesiana
spiders (Genbank accession gi 27524417) was also not
significantly differentially represented (Table 3), although
SGFRs contains 6 ESTs and SGFAc has just 1 EST. However, the GRP similar to "salivary gland-associated protein 64P" from R. appendiculatus (a Brevirostrata,
heteroxenous tick), regarded as a cement protein, was significantly more expressed in salivary glands of female R.
sanguineus than in those of A. cajennense (P = 0.001, χ2
test). This result suggests that females of a Brevirostrata,
heteroxenous tick rely more on this protein to attach and
feed on their last host than Longirostrata, heteroxenous
ticks. Finally, regarding the nature of similarities, it was
interesting to note that R. microplus, R. sanguineus and A.
cajennense expressed, respectively, 23, 17 and 8 transcripts that were similar to silks of true spiders (Araneomorphae; Table 2), however the differences in
distribution did not reach statistical significance.
Our results do not preclude the fact that some of the
GRPs for which transcripts were not detected in a given
species may indeed be present in salivary glands as preformed proteins stored in granules. Nevertheless, this
still represents a biological difference involving GRPs that
is reflected in the transcription profile. On the other
hand, previous work [12] clearly shows that tick salivary
glands are not completely "pre-loaded" and ready to
secrete when a tick attaches to a host. Indeed, the expression of at least 27 genes encoding secreted proteins
increases in salivary glands of female Ixodes scapularis
ticks after attachment to their host and, interestingly,
almost a third (eight) of these encode GRPs. Furthermore, transcripts for GRPs were not observed in salivary
glands from unfed females. Kaufman [13] showed that
fluid secretion by salivary glands was similar in the
females of several species of Ixodidae ticks, including
Brevirostrata and Longirostratata ticks suggesting that
salivation is similar throughout the Ixodid family [13], i.e.,
if the presence of 'pre-loaded' granules has a determinant
role in salivation, that work would have found differences
for distinct tick species, mainly at the early phases of salivation.
Besides analyses performed with the NCBI database,
we used the gene ontology (GO) database to categorize
the GRP contigs from individual libraries. Results must
be interpreted with caution since the GRP sequences are
of low complexity and GO categories are still not entirely
comprehensive for all biological functions. Nevertheless,
differences were seen among the three species of ticks.
The GRP transcripts were categorized into GO terms for
nine biological processes (Additional file 1); the term
"epidermis development" was most frequently assigned to
transcripts from heteroxenous ticks (SGFRs with 70.2%

for SGFRs). Glycine-rich proteins related to epidermal
development have also been found in others arthropods,
such as the silkworm Bombix mori [14]. Interestingly
terms related to development of epidermis were the most
abundant category of all, assigned to SGFRs (70.2%), a
library made from a heteroxenous, Brevirostrata tick.
Over half (52.2%) of the terms assigned for SGFAc fell
into the category "unknown", reflecting the fact that little
information is available about biological characteristics of
saliva from A. cajennense ticks.

Phylogenetic analyses of Glycine-rich proteins
Silk-like proteins

Phylogenetic analysis of GRP contigs from the three ticks
studied herein shows 3 distinct clades (numbered 1-3) as
displayed in Figure 2. Two of them contain a group of
contigs that presented similarities with silk proteins of
spiders. One was similar to a flagelliform silk protein,
(FSP; clade 1), which is a viscous, glue-like silk from orbweaving spiders of the Nephila genus; another was similar
to major ampullate spidroin (Masp; clade 2) from Kukulcania hibernalis, a cribellate (i.e., it does not produce

Maruyama et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:363
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/363

glue-like adhesive webbing), non-orb-weaving spider.
Interestingly, these clades are the most defined in the
dendogram, as may be observed through the proximity
among members of these clades. Another feature of
clades 1 and 2 is that each is formed by contigs from a
single species of tick: clade 2 presented contigs only from
A. cajennense and clade 1 contained contigs only from R.
microplus, probably for this reason the clades showed
better proximity among the members. This finding is
compatible with our hypothesis that metastriate ticks
presenting with different biological characteristics rely on
different types of GRPs. Noteworthy is the fact FSP is an
elastic and glue -like adhesive silk [15], a characteristic
which could be important for a Brevirostrata monoxenous tick. The third distinct clade has showed similarity
with an unknown protein (UK) from R. haemaphysaloides and contains contigs from only Brevirostrata ticks,
i.e., R. microplus and R. sanguineus, again a finding that is
compatible with our hypothesis. Futhermore, although
distinct clades were not formed by the remaining GRP
contigs, we noted that contigs segregated into two different patterns: those which presented matches with spider
silk proteins (filled symbols) are concentrated in clades
that are distant from those that have similarities with
cement-like proteins of ticks (open symbols), with the
exception of contigs Rs54, Rm388 and Ac52. This finding
suggests that these two "major types" of GRPs (silks versus cements) may have different roles during attachment
ticks on the host. The similarities found with spider GRPs
were also with Masps and FSPs, albeit from different genera of spiders. Interestingly, A. cajennense was represented only twice among the cement-like (open symbol)
contigs, while two other cement-like contigs from this
species grouped with spider silk-like contigs.
A multiple alignment analyses of the three distinct
clades (clades 1-3 from Figure 2) showed the level of conservation among contigs, as can be observed in Figure 3.
Clade 1, formed by contigs from SGFRm showed the
greatest degree of conservation. Sequence alignment of
Rm34 and Rm37 show an identity of 78.9% and 81.1%
similarity. Rm33 and Rm36 presented the lowest conservation, 33% identity and 35.5% similarity. Contigs of clade
2 formed by SGFAc sequences also displayed low divergence, even the least similar transcript Ac14; Ac13 presented a reasonable equivalence between sequences
(25.1% identity and 27% similarity) whereas Ac15 and
Ac16 had better conservation, presenting an identity of
56,5% and similarity of 61.4%. Clade 3 did not did not
present the same level of conservation as clades 1 and 2,
except for contigs Rs 402 and Rm31, which presented a
high identity and similarity of 63.4% and 65.9%, respectively.
It was interesting to note the large conserved region
visualized in each of the sequence alignments of clades 1

Page 8 of 17

and 2. Five conserved regions are encountered in SGFRm
contigs of clade 1 that are identical in the 6 contigs: 1)
QLGPS (position 7-11), 2) SGSLG (position 13-17), 3)
GVLPSG (position 56-61), 4) SGVGRG (position 82-87)
and 5) TGFVLPG (position 89-95); some of these conserved regions could be extend if the charge and chemical
proprieties of the residues from different contigs are
taken into consideration. In the alignment for clade 1,
aspartic acid (D) could change to glutamic acid (E) at residue 5, leucine (L) to isoleucin (I) at residue 6 (both
hydrophobic), glycine (G) to serine (S) at residue 12 (both
uncharged) and valine (V) to alanine (A) at residue 19
(both hydrophobic) and these amino acids present similar
characteristics among each other. The same aspects can
be observed for residues 43-61 and 89-98. In addition,
when the contigs of clade 1 are compared with the composition of flageliform silk proteins, positions of important residues of silk proteins such as glycine, serine and
proline are conserved among them (Additional file 2).
Regarding clade 2, two conserved regions are found in all
SGFAc contigs, one composed of 5 residues, FGSGF
(position 134-138), and a second one with 10 residues,
SGLGGGYGSG (position 140-149). It is noteworthy that
both regions have glycine (the majority) and serine residues. Again, conserved regions contain glycine and serine
residues, two abundant amino acids in spider silk. Alignment of Ac contigs and Masp proteins showed similarity
in most positions containing glycine and serine residues,
but not in positions with proline residues (Additional file
3). Sheets are formed in secondary structures of silk proteins with repeats containing glycine, serine and alanine,
which confer their elastic and strength proprieties [16].
The presence of a proline residue between serine and glycine, as happens in sequences of clade 1, could be important to "interrupt" secondary structures determined by
glycine, serine and alanine, promoting acquisition of
more elastic and less stiff properties. The mechanical
property of elasticity is greater in flagelliform silk proteins of orb-weaving spiders (e.g., the Nephila genus) that
are made to capture flying prey than in major ampullate
spidroin silk proteins (Masp) used in capture threads in
less mobile spiders [15,17]. The multiple alignments of
clade 3 sequences, which are homologous with an
"unknown" protein from Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides did not present conserved regions, perhaps owing
to divergence among contigs and many gaps that could
not allow long conserved regions. However, it can be
observed though shading of the alignments that they
present similarities as described before, with regions
abundant in glycine and serine.
In addition to the contigs derived from R. microplus, R.
sanquineus and A. cajennense analyzed herein and in
order to increase the stringency of the test for our
hypothesis, we performed a multiple alignment using

(mainly Brevirostrata ticks). We observed in this work

that Argasid ticks produce only three types out of over
four hundred types of GRPs. This maybe due to the fact
that Argasid ticks are rapid feeders and complete a blood
meal in minutes. We also observed that the majority of
the GRPs found in Prostriate ticks (genus Ixodes), are collagen-like proteins. This group appears to have a primi-

tive form of attachment among the ixodid ticks [3],
presenting an intermediate complexity in this process.
Finally, this work showed that in metastriate ticks (from
the genera Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus and
Haemaphysalis) the GRPs belong to GGY, GYG and

metastriate spider-like cement protein families. We
therefore excluded analyses of GRPs from Ixodes sp. and
Argasidae ticks and selected GRPs from the NR database
on NCBI that present similarities with silk-like and
cement-like proteins from A. variegatum, A. america-

num, D. andersoni, R. microplus and R. appendiculatus
(Sup-Table 1 of Francischetti et al., 2009).
We aligned all sequences similar to silk-like proteins
from our libraries and the NR database from Sup-Table 1
(describe in Francischetti et al., 2009) and using the
neighbor joining analysis produced the phylogram shown
in Figure 4. Sequences generated by the present work are
symbolized with a circle (᭹: R. microplus), a square (᭿: R.
sanquineus ) and a triangule (▲: A. cajennense). In addition to our sequences, 45 other transcript sequences of
other species ticks are represented: Dermacentor andersoni and R. appendiculatus, both Brevirostrata, heteroxenous ticks, and A. variegatum and A. americanum,
Longirostrata, heteroxenous ticks. Sequences of R.
microplus from other sources were also included in the
analysis. To the best of our knowledge there are no representatives of Longirostrata, monoxenous ticks that could
be included in this analysis. This approach showed that
contigs from Amblyomma ticks formed distinct clades (1
and 2). These clades did not present similarities with a
specific type of flagelliform silk, a similarity consistently
found in the Brevirostrata ticks D andersoni, R.
microplus, R. appendiculatus and R. sanguineus. This can
be observed in the most distinct clade formed by these
latter species of ticks (clade 3). All sequences from this
clade present similarity with flagelliform silk. Moreover,
sequences in the dendogram displayed a wide-spread distribution, including a clade formed only by sequences
from our libraries (clade 4), showing that we have contributed with diversified sequences encoding glycine-rich
proteins from our ESTs database.
Cement-like proteins

Contigs homologous to so called cement-like proteins
were found among each of the three libraries, yet were
most abundant in the library derived from R. microplus (9
contigs versus two in SGFAc and 1 from SGFRs). The
cement-like sequences from the same species analyzed
before were aligned and used to generate the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 5, which showed six distinct
clades. Clades 1 and 2 contain cement-like proteins from
other Brevirostrata and Longirostrata ticks, indicating
the diversity among cement-like proteins. Most
sequences from clade 2 presented similarity with the salivary gland-associated protein 64P from R. appendiculatus, except sequence Rm 234, which showed similarity
with NPL-2 (neuroprotein-like) from Ixodes pacificus.
Clade 1 contains a subclade with sequences derived
exclusively from R. microplus. Clade 3, in turn, presented
sequences similar to putative cement protein RIM36
from R. appendiculatus (Ac 52) and Unknown protein
from R. haemaphysaloides (Rs 156, 17, 4238; Rm 85, 479
and Ac 9). Clades 4 and 5, aside from illustrating the
extensive diversity in the expression of cement-like proteins between the ticks, also indicate the expansion of the

Page 11 of 17

genus Rhipicephalus showing similarity with cement-like
antigen protein from Haemaphysalis longicornis and an
unknown protein from R. haemaphysaloides. Finally,
Clade 6 contains sequences derived exclusively from R.
appendiculatus.
Examination of the best hits to the sequences in the
general NCBI database showed that several GRP contigs
were significantly homologus to GRPs of plants (Rm 265,
Rm 36, Rm 77, Rs 70, Ac 147, Ac 14) vertebrate skin (Rs
26, Rs12, Rs 70, Ac 354, Ac 13, Ac16) nucleic-acid-binding proteins (Rm 32, Ac 233 ) and to the Mycobacterium
tuberculosis PE-PGRS multigene family (contigs Rm 479,
Rm 533, Rm 29, Rs 29). These similarities may also shed
light on the biological functions of the tick GRPs. In
plants many GRPs form the walls of initially polysaccharide-rich primary water pipes of elongating plant organs
[19]. These functions remit to those of the cement cone in
Brevirostrata ticks, which forms a continuation of the
hypostome that penetrates the host skin. Interestingly,
seed plant GRPs can be allergens for vertebrates [20] and
similarly tick saliva can elicit local hypersensitivity reactions in immune hosts [21]. GRPs also play a role in regulating permeability and penetration of toxins in insect
cuticles [9]. In ticks the cement cone may assist the cuticle of the hypostome in trapping host cells and molecules
that are cytotoxic for the parasite. Many secreted salivary
GRPs are similar to RNA-binding proteins, which in the
tick may participate in modifying the extracellular traps
comprised of nucleic acids that can be produced by mast
cells and neutrophils [22], which are present in the local
inflammatory infiltrate elicited in the host's skin by tick
bites. This finding can also explain the significant quantity of transcripts from SGFRm (20.7%, Additional file 1)
categorized such as "nucleic acid binding" based on the
GO database. Tick GRPs similar to keratins and loricrins,
which are major envelope components of terminally differentiated epithelial cells of vertebrate skin [23], may
serve as decoys for the host. Interestingly, the Brevirostrata ticks herein analyzed (R. microplus and R. sanguineus) displayed a greater number of transcripts related
to development of epidermis and organization and biogenesis of extracellular matrix based on homologies to
the GO database than the Longirostrata tick (A. cajennense). Finally, the products of the PE-PGRS multigene
family of M. tuberculosis form a source of antigenic variation among different strains of this bacterium [24]; in
addition PE-PGRS contain many Gly-Ala repeats, which
are also present in tick GRPs and which have been shown
to inhibit ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent protein degradation in mycobacteria and Epstein-Barr virus [25,26].
Since libraries were constructed from a pool of salivary
glands from several individual females, the diversity in
contigs of salivary GRPs may reflect the existence of a
similar mechanism in ticks.

GRPs present biochemical characteristics that could
possibly be involved in stabilizing the tick to its feeding
site for long periods due to their putative structural and
mechanical functions inferred from the abundance of the

amino acid glycine. GRPs may also block host immune
system molecules that enter in contact with the tick
mouthparts [4]. Many contigs were similar to silk proteins from spiders, such as fibroin, dragline, flagelliform,

major ampullate spidroin and flag silks. Each one of these
fibers is composed of one or more proteins encoded by
the silk fibroin gene family. Spiders draw fibers from dissolved fibroin proteins that are stored in specialized sets
of abdominal glands [27]. It is interesting to note that
ticks generate silk-like proteins from their salivary glands,

while spiders use abdominal glands for this purpose and
reserve their salivary glands for production of venom.
Tick silk-like GRPs may possibly support mechanical
needs (e.g., fixation to host skin), as well as the capture of
prey and predators (respectively, blood and cytotoxic leukocytes). Spider silks are being employed as scaffolds for

Maruyama et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:363
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/363

engineering tissues [28] and tick silk-like proteins may be
more adequate for this purpose because of the intimate
relation of this parasite with its host's skin.
There are other precedents in nature for our finding
that the distribution of distinct GRPs correlates with the
biology of metastriate ticks. Spiders, which are also
Arachnidae, offer a well known example: the architecture
and mechanical properties of different spider webs are
correlated with the biological characteristics of their
spinners, for example, aerial versus terrestrial capture
habits. These properties ultimately rely on the specialized
functions of different types of silks. Of interest to studies
on the evolution of ticks, orb weaving by spiders is monophyletic, having evolved only once and speciation of spiders relates to use of different silks [15]. Genes encoding
flagelliform silks were thought to be expressed exclusively
by modern orb weaver spiders that make more elastic,
gluey webs. However it was recently shown that cribellate
orb weavers, which make drier webs, also express flagelliform silk genes [29], albeit in lower quantities. Blackledge
and colleagues [15] suggested that an increase in the
expression of flagelliform silk genes may have resulted in
development of modern orb weavers [15]. Another example refers to the silks produced by salivary glands of simuliid filter-feeding flies. Simulium noelleri and S. ornatum
use silk pads to attach to substrates, the composition of
which varies according the requirements of their habitats:
S. noelleri feeds in lake outlets where weaker currents are
found and S. ornatum feeds in open waters with stronger
currents. Accordingly, there are differences between ageing processes and biochemical composition of the silk
pads from these two species, S. ornatum presenting the
most durable structure [30]. A third and final example is
offered by larvae of two species of caddisflies. Hydropsyche angustipennis spins hiding tubes and catching nets
that collect food in water currents; larvae of Limnephilus
decipiens use silk fiber only for stitching fragments of
grass into hiding and pupation cases. The composition of
the silk fibers from these species differed by the arrangement of motifs in higher order repeats and by the presence of species-specific motifs. Although the amounts of
glycine are similar, the H-fibroin of H. angustipennis
presents proline containing motifs, whereas L. decipiens
presents a highly charged motif, EEGRRR [31].

Conclusions
In the present work the differences observed for distribution of glycine-rich proteins were related to the number
of hosts visited (i.e., if the species is monoxenous or heteroxenous) and to the anatomy of mouthparts (long or
short hypostome) of three species of metastriate ticks. All
ixodid ticks, with the exception of some Prostriate, pres-

Page 14 of 17

ent a strategy for attachment, but it differs among them.
The species from the genus Amblyomma, which belongs
to the Longirostrata ticks, secrete a casing around their
long, fully inserted hypostome. In ticks from the Brevirostrata group, which includes species from the genus Rhipicephalus, the mouthparts are short and barely
penetrate in epidermis [3], so a larger cement cone, from
which GRPs have been purified [4], is necessary and is
deposited in the upper layers of their host's skin. Thus, it
seems that the two Brevirostrata ticks, R. microplus and
R. sanguineus, need to express more glycine-rich proteins
than the Longirostrata tick, A. cajennense, in order to
compensate for the small size of mouthparts and for the
superficial fixation at the site of attachment. Furthermore, R. microplus is monoxenous and R. sanguineus is
heteroxenous and comparisons made between these ticks
show that the former presents the greatest diversity of
glycine-rich proteins, possibly because it is a one-host
tick that feeds uninterrupted for many days until completion of its life cycle and, therefore, has greater demands
for sustaining its attachment on host skin.
Contigs of salivary glands for several other species of
ticks have also been examined. While the relative abundance of transcripts coding for glycine-rich proteins cannot be accurately compared between salivary gland
libraries constructed in different laboratories and undergoing different biological situations (for example, infection and feeding time, number of salivary glands used or
if whole body ticks were used, etc), it is still noteworthy
that annotation of the transcriptomes of salivary glands
from female I. scapularis and I. pacificus indicate that
prostriate ticks do not rely on glycine-rich proteins as
heavily as metastriate ticks for their attachment to hosts
or for other biological functions [32,12]. On the other
hand, salivary glands of females of D. andersoni, a metastriate, heteroxenous, Brevirostrata tick, also contain
abundant transcripts for GRPs: of the 30 contigs containing the most abundantly expressed ESTs in salivary
glands of females of D. andersoni, 9 presented similarities
to glycine-rich proteins and contained from 21 to 5 ESTs
each [33].
In conclusion, our findings furnish preliminary evidence to support the hypothesis that species of ticks with
differences in the anatomy of their mouthparts and in the
number of hosts they infest during their biological cycle
rely on different types and quantities of glycine-rich proteins. This hypothesis must be further tested by expanding these observations to a larger number of species, by
experimental approaches such as RNA interference of
expression of selected GRPs and by characterization of
isolated GRPs. The data suggests that prostriate ticks rely
on their elongated barbed hypostome mouthparts and

Maruyama et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:363

make shallow cement cones, while the metastriate ticks
rely on a larger and deeper cement cone possibly to compensate their relatively smaller mouth parts [3]. The
number of hosts visited by ticks during the parasitic stage
of their life cycle also requires adaptations. According to
Balashov (1972) [34] and Hoogstraal and Kim (1985) [35]
there was a transition from the three host to the two and
one host cycle in Hyalomma and in Rhipicephalinae species of ticks. The biological characteristic of having a single host is regarded as an adaptation of this immobile
ectoparasite to large nomadic animals since ixodid ticks
die when they are unable to find a host. Monoxenous
ticks are thus better adapted to open environments
inhabited by large, grazing ungulates. The ability to molt
on the vertebrate reduces the number of necessary
encounters and thus increases chances for tick survival.
In addition to elucidating the biology of tick salivary
proteins, the information contained in this work is relevant for the development of vaccines that target GRPs of
ticks and that aim for protection against a broad range of
species. The approach undertaken in this work can subsidize the choice of the different GRPs present in tick salivary glands for evaluation as protective antigens.

Methods
Ticks

Adult female ticks of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus)
microplus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Amblyomma
cajennense were collected from naturally infested vertebrate hosts; cattle, dogs and horses, respectively. Samples
were collected as to cover the feeding process until the
phase of rapid engorgement. Ticks of different sizes, but
always ≤ 4 mm in body length (before the rapid engorgement phase of feeding; approximately three to four days
post attachment) were used for salivary gland dissection
to avoid degeneration of salivary gland proteins [36,37].
Ticks were collected from a sample of several hosts and
over a period of two to five days and, once removed from
the hosts, salivary glands were immediately dissected; a
total of 20-30 ticks were used per library. Glands were
briefly washed in ice-cold 1X PBS and immediately stored
in RNA later storage solution at 4°C for 24 hours and
(Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) then transferred to -80°C for
long term storage.
Extraction of mRNA and cDNA library synthesis

Poly A+ mRNA from tick salivary glands was isolated
using the Micro-Fast Track™ 2.0 mRNA isolation kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) following the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA (similar concentrations for all
samples) was used to construct the cDNA library using
the vector TriplEx2 according to the instructions for the
SMART™ cDNA Library Construction kit (Clontech, Palo
Alto, California) with some modifications [38] and packaged into lambda phage using the Gigapack® III Gold
Packaging Extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, California).

The phage sample was used as a template for a PCR
reaction to randomly amplify cDNAs. The primers used
for this reaction were sequences from the TriplEX2 vector. PT2F1 (5' -AAG TAC TCT AGC AAT TGT GAG C3') is positioned upstream of the cDNA of interest (5'
end), and PT2R1 (5'-CTC TTC GCT ATT ACG CCA
GCT G-3') is positioned downstream of the cDNA of
interest (3' end). The cleaned PCR product was used as a
template for a cycle-sequencing reaction using the Big
Dye kit (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, California).The
primer used for sequencing, PT2F3 (5'-TCT CGG GAA
GCG CGC CAT TGT-3') is upstream of the inserted
cDNA and downstream of the primer PT2F1. Sequencing
reactions were performed in one direction only on a
Gene Amp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, California).
Bioinformatic tools

Detailed description of the bioinformatic treatment of
the data can be found elsewhere with some modifications
[38,12]. The programs used were written in Visual Basic
6.0 (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington) by one of us
(JMR). Briefly the ESTs (raw sequences) were trimmed of
primer and vector sequences, clustered into related
groups, based on homology, using the BLASTN algorithm (minimum identity of 81 nucleotides over 90 nucleotides) [39], and then assembled and aligned using the
CAP3 assembler [40]. The consensus sequences and singletons resulting from the CAP3 assembler were compared to the Non-Redundant (NR) protein database of
the NCBI; a customized protein database containing all
Arachnida sequences available on Genbank, and the
Gene Ontology (GO) database [41] using the BLASTX
algorithm (downloaded from an executable file obtained
from the NCBI FTP site [39]. Since libraries were constructed in a unidirectional orientation, BLASTX results
were only considered if they were on the positive sense
strand. A cut-off E-value of 10-3 was considered for annotation. All sequences were translated into three
Sequences containing >5% non-assigned nucleotides (Ns)
or final length of less than 100 nt were removed from the
analysis and assumed to be of poor quality. The final output was piped into a tab-delimited file imported into an
Excel (Microsoft Excel Analysis Tools, Seattle, WA)
spreadsheet. We used the χ2 test and Fisher test to analyze
differences in the distribution of ESTs in the different
libraries. Phylogenetic analysis of glycine-rich contigs was
conducted by first aligning sequences obtained from our
cDNA library analysis with published GRP sequences
recently cataloged by Francischetti et al. (2009) [18] as
well as silk protein sequences obtained from Genbank,
using ClustalX Sequence Alignment program [42]. Alignments were manually refined using BioEdit sequence
editing software [43]. Phylogeneic associations were
determined using neighbour joining (NJ) analysis (Mega

4.0 [44]). Node support of each clade was evaluated using
bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates).
