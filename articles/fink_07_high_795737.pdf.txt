Abstract
Background: The arginine-vasopressin 1a receptor has been identified as a key determinant for
social behaviour in Microtus voles, humans and other mammals. Nevertheless, the genetic bases of
complex phenotypic traits like differences in social and mating behaviour among species and
individuals remain largely unknown. Contrary to previous studies focusing on differences in the
promotor region of the gene, we investigate here the level of functional variation in the coding
region (exon 1) of this locus.
Results: We detected high sequence diversity between higher mammalian taxa as well as between
species of the genus Microtus. This includes length variation and radical amino acid changes, as well
as the presence of distinct protein variants within individuals. Additionally, negative selection
prevails on most parts of the first exon of the arginine-vasopressin receptor 1a (avpr1a) gene but it
contains regions with higher rates of change that harbour positively selected sites. Synonymous and
non-synonymous substitution rates in the avpr1a gene are not exceptional compared to other
genes, but they exceed those found in related hormone receptors with similar functions.
Discussion: These results stress the importance of considering variation in the coding sequence
of avpr1a in regards to associations with life history traits (e.g. social behaviour, mating system,
habitat requirements) of voles, other mammals and humans in particular.

Background
The genetic bases of complex phenotypic traits like differences in social and mating behaviour among species and
individuals remain largely unknown [1]. Most such traits
are probably under polygenic control and the contribution of each gene to the phenotype is often very difficult
to assess [2]. Even for genes with large effects, it is highly
challenging to identify the causes of particular phenotypic
differences because genetic variation is rarely restricted to
dichotomous polymorphism in a gene [e.g. [3-6]].

Genetic variation at a locus is not only shaped by locus- or
site-specific selective processes but also by the evolutionary history of the particular species or population.
One of the best examples of a single gene with large effects
involved in very specific phenotypic and behavioural differences is the arginine-vasopressin receptor 1a (avpr1a). This
gene has been proposed to play a key role in controlling
variation in mammalian social behaviour [7-11], and it
has been particularly well-studied for its role in the formaPage 1 of 15

tion of mating systems in rodents from the genus Microtus
[12-15]. Phenotypic differences between species in
arginine-vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) distribution in
the brain and contrasting social behaviour were largely
attributed to the presence of a repetitive expansion in the
regulatory region upstream of the gene [12-15]. The transfer of the entire avpr1a gene region including the repetitive
expansion or the coding region from a monogamous vole
to non-monogamous voles and other rodents resulted in
modified V1aR distributions and changes in social behaviour [12]. Additionally, monogamous voles showed
increased affiliative behaviour (measured as time spent in
contact with other voles, see in [14]) after injection of the
arginine-vasopressin (AVP) hormone in the brain, while
non-monogamous voles displayed unchanged social
behaviour [14]. However, AVP has two main roles: it controls higher cognitive functions such as memory and
learning in the brain, and it acts peripherally by facilitating water absorption in the kidney and by contracting
smooth muscle cells from blood vessels [16]. The impact
of hormones on behavioural variation may therefore also
depend on environmental conditions [see [17]]. A recent
study showed further that neither social nor genetic
monogamy are strictly associated with the presence of the
repetitive expansion in the regulatory region of avpr1a in
voles and other mammals [18].
In contrast to polymorphism in the regulatory region of
avpr1a, variation in the coding part is assumed to be low
and functionally negligible [14,19,20]. Rodent avpr1a patterns have been proposed as mammalian model systems
for the study of the role of hormone receptors in the formation of complex social interactions, including human
social disorders [21]. Studies of human avpr1a have
mainly focused on variation in the non-coding upstream
region of the gene, and associations have been reported
with autism [22-24], eating behaviour [25], self perception [11] and even creative dance performance [26]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human avpr1a gene
have been detected [22-24,27], but it is unknown if they
affect the encoded protein. Previous studies of the Microtine avpr1a have not explicitly studied levels and patterns
of variation in the coding region at the inter- or intra-specific level. Its potential influence on social behaviour and
interactions in voles and other mammals remains therefore totally unknown.
We use here an evolutionary approach to investigate variation in parts of the coding region of the mammalian
avpr1a gene. We analyse patterns of nucleotide and amino
acid (AA) polymorphism in the Microtus genus represented by 24 species from three continents (Europe,
North America, Asia), and compare it to the avpr1a diversity found in various higher mammalian taxa. Furthermore, we examine rate variation among the functionally

important regions – the ligand binding site or the G-protein binding domain [16] – and other parts of the V1aR,
and we test for the role of selection in shaping variability
in the avpr1a gene.

Results
Microtine avpr1a diversity
The analysis of a large fragment (792 bp) of the first exon
(total 970 bp) of the avpr1a gene in the genus Microtus
revealed unexpectedly high levels of variation with an
overall nucleotide diversity of 0.0161. The sequencing of
individuals from 24 species revealed 12 heterozygous
individuals, while the two individuals obtained from
GenBank were apparently homozygous for avpr1a. After
cloning of heterozygous PCR-products, a total of 36 different sequences were detected among the 48 chromosomes,
which showed overall 103 variable positions (13%).
Despite this large amount of diversity, one chromosome
sequence (E01, see Table 1) was identical between two
individuals of different species (M. tatricus, M.
oeconomus).

After translation into AA, the 36 DNA sequence types
coded for 24 different proteins. Individuals from three
species remained heterozygous at the AA level (in M. arvalis, M. rossiaemeridionalis and M. oregoni). Two protein
types were shared among several species (M. longicaudus,
M. socialis and M. tatricus, M. oeconomus, M. multiplex,
respectively). The highest number of AA variants was
found in the ligand binding domain of the V1aR with up
to four different AAs per position (Figure 1). The number
of AA changes was significantly different between ligand
binding domain, G-protein binding domain and transmembrane regions (χ2 = 13.95, df = 2, p < 0.001). AA
changes occurred at eight positions (24%) in the ligandbinding N-terminus of the protein, at six positions (18%)
in the G-protein binding domain, and at 20 positions
(58%) between these functionally important regions (Figure 2). Significantly more AA changes were present in the
N-terminus (χ2 = 13.92, df = 1, p < 0.001) than in the first
five transmembrane regions or the G-protein binding
domain (χ2 = 13.92, df = 1, p < 0.001). The G-protein
binding domain did not show significantly more AA substitutions than the transmembrane regions (χ2 = 0.06, df
= 1, p > 0.5). The individuals with two V1aR types differed
at the intra-individual level either in the ligand binding
domain (M. oregoni, position 26) or in the G-protein
binding domain (M. rossiaemeridionalis, position 255; M.
arvalis, position 262).
Genetic variation within the Microtus genus included the
deletion of two AAs in the ligand binding domain in one
species (M. agrestis) and an insertion of two AA in the first
transmembrane region in three species (M. agrestis, M.
montebelli, M. kikuchii). AA insertions segregate together

with an AA change at position 42 for a group of related
species (Figure 3). These protein alterations were apparently subsequently lost in one species of this cluster (M.
oeconomus, see Figure 3). The two closely related sister species M. arvalis and M. rossiaemeridionalis [28] share two AA
changes (58, 85), while otherwise protein types did not
obviously segregate with phylogenetic relationships as
inferred from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene.

23 AA substitutions involved radical (at least one change
between physico-chemical classes considering polarity,
charge and volume; see in [29]) and 10 conservative (all
three categories reveal the same physico-chemical characteristics for the interchangeable AAs) changes. Ten of the
radical changes were found in the ligand binding and the
G-protein binding domains (see Figure 2).

exon.

Mammalian avpr1a diversity
To contrast Microtine avpr1a diversity to variability in
other mammals, we sequenced the corresponding fragment of the first exon in different rodent taxa (Arvicola terrestris, Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus sylvaticus, see
Table 1) and supplemented it with published nucleotide
sequences of several Eutherian mammals, as well as a marsupial sequence (Monodelphis domestica) as outgroup.
Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed high nucleotide
diversity (0.1488) and a high proportion of variable positions (41.7%; 36.38% without marsupial). A phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences using ML and NJ
reconstruction methods revealed the same topology (Figure 4), with e.g. rodents and primates forming highly supported clades.

Different selection tests detected mostly negative selection
on the Microtine avpr1a gene and some ambiguous evidence for positive selection on particular parts. HyPhy
detected no signal of positive selection and several sites
under negative selection between the functionally important regions (codon positions 50, 67, 68, 82, 170, 186, p
< 0.05). PAML results suggested equal substitution rates
among Microtus lineages (M0 vs M3: 2∆l = 6.1684, 4 df, p
> 0.05, see Table 2), and no statistical support for positive
selection in any part of the gene (M1 vs M2: 2∆l = 0, 2 df,
p > 0.5; M7 vs M8: 2∆l = 0, 2 df, p > 0.5). Nevertheless,
some codon positions had an ω exceeding 1 in the analysis of models for positive selection (M2 and M8: positions
18 and 26; M8 only: position 30), and these sites lie in the
ligand binding domain at the N-terminus of the gene.
These codons were positively selected against a background of strong purifying selection acting on 96% of the
sites, which is in agreement with the results of HyPhy.

The high diversity found at the nucleotide level resulted in
high AA diversity after translation with all species showing
unique AA sequence types. Most changes occurred in the
two functionally important regions of the V1aR: the ligand binding domain and the G-protein binding domain
(Figure 1). The latter region included many AA deletions
and insertions, resulting in length variation among mammals. Except for a 3 AA long deletion in several rodents
(M. montanus, A. terrestris, C. glareolus), the other insertions and deletions occurred in single species only.
Sliding window analyses of dN/dS ratios along the gene
showed a strong signal of positive selection in the ligand
binding domain (dN/dS = 2.163), while the dN and dS values in the region around the G-protein binding domain
are equal due to relatively more synonymous variation
(Figures 1; 5). The transmembrane regions show comparatively few non-synonymous mutations (Figure 1) which
leads to small dN/dS ratios (Figure 5).
Despite the evidence for positive selection on the ligand
binding domain, further tests rather suggested generally
negative selection on avpr1a. PAML detected significant
rate variation among the lineages (M0 vs M3: 2∆l =
178.537, df = 4 p < 0.05), where 88% of all sites were
under strong purifying selection, while 12% showed
relaxed purifying selection acting on these sites (Table 2).
PAML revealed no evidence for positive selection overall
(M1 vs M2: 2∆l = 0, df = 2 p > 0.05; M7 vs M8:2∆l =
0.0004, df = 2 p > 0.05; Table 2). HyPhy detected five negatively selected sites in functionally important regions and
24 in-between (codon positions 33, 41, 47, 48, 52, 69, 71,
77, 87, 107, 119, 120, 125, 136, 138, 146, 152, 159, 178,
184, 198, 216, 223, 227, 230, 250, 251, 254, 279).
Considering the phylogenetic background of the species
provided further evidence for non-neutral evolution of
the avpr1a gene. For the mammalian branches, evolutionary models allowing for selection (MA) were not signifi-

Maximum likelihood methods were applied to compare models allowing for positive or negative selection (M2, M3, M8 and MA) with models
without selection (M0, M1, M7). Parameters are represented as p0 = proportion of sites where ω < 1 (ω0), p1 = proportion of sites where ω = 1
(ω1), and for models with selection p2 = proportion of sites where ω > 1 (ω2). For models M7 and M8, p and q represent parameters of the beta
distribution. The log likelihood l of each model is given as well as the position of positively selected codons (where ω > 1). A: Overall selection tests

ratios exceeding 1 were detected mainly in the G-protein

Despite high variability among mammals in general and
within Microtus, substitution rates of avpr1a are not exceptionally high relative to other nuclear genes in the comparison of mouse, rat and Microtus (Figure 6). Many genes
investigated to date show much higher non-synonymous
rates than avpr1a and synonymous rates rank this receptor
gene only slightly higher. However, it is worth noting that
substitution rates of avpr1a are higher than for other hormone receptors with related function like oxytocin, corticothropin or estrogen.

nucleotide position 50 to 800 from the start codon (due to

domain, which indicates positive selection in this region. A
second peak of dN/dS close to 1 is found around 750 bp corresponding to the G-protein binding domain of the AVP 1a
receptor.

Discussion
Our analyses of the avpr1a gene, shown to have high
behavioural impact in the genus Microtus as well as in
other mammals [12,30], revealed high nucleotide and
protein diversity. Variation within Microtus involved
many radical physico-chemical amino acid substitutions
and deletions, which were located at functionally important regions of the V1aR. The pattern indicates positive
selection on few codons in the ligand binding domain
and possibly in the G-protein binding domain, but purifying selection on the majority of the gene.
High genetic variation in the avpr1a gene
Genetic variability in the coding region of the avpr1a gene
appears much higher and evolutionarily much more
important than previously suggested [30,31]. DNA
sequences of just two M. ochrogaster and M. montanus individuals were taken as evidence that the Microtine avpr1a
gene was highly conserved [14,20,31]. However, our analyses reveal not only high levels of genetic variation in the
coding region between mammalian species, but also
within the genus Microtus. We detected up to 23 polymorphic positions in the first exon of the gene within a single
Microtus individual compared to other closely related species, whereas studies of human avpr1a revealed a few synonymous and non-synonymous SNP in humans [22,27].
Population data from at least one Microtus species will be
necessary to allow more detailed comparisons with

human variation. However, the apparent difference
between voles and humans may be explained in part by
the longer evolutionary history of Microtus voles of at least
several hundred thousand years with about three generations per year [28] and generally elevated mutation rates
in rodents compared to primates [32,33]
Many AA replacements in the Microtine avpr1a gene
involved radical physico-chemical changes, and several
vole species showed deletions and insertions of AAs in
this hormone receptor gene. Such length-variation in coding DNA within or among closely related species is
remarkable, because it is usually restricted to non-coding
DNA, where it may influence in particular cases the
expression of genes but is generally functionally and selectively neutral [34-37]. Additionally, we detected considerable length variation in the G-protein binding region
between different mammalian species. The diversity
found among mammals might influence signal transduction, since already single AA changes can lead to differences in receptor activation in this region [16].
Amino acid positions identified as crucial for either ligand
binding or G-protein activation in humans, mouse and rat
are mainly conserved among Microtus species as well as
among other mammals. A highly conserved triplet
(Asp148-Arg149-Tyr150) with a role in signal transduction in
many G-protein coupled receptors was conserved across
all individuals analysed [38]. Additionally, a glycosylation site (Asn27) with a crucial role in protein folding or
stabilization [39] remained conserved among all mammals and voles. Glu185, supposed to be involved in agonist and peptide as well as non-peptide antagonist
binding to the V1aR [16], was highly conserved among
mammals except for one Microtus individual (M. richardsoni), which showed a mutation to His185. This alteration
together with an additional mutation at a glycosylation
site (Asn198->Thr198) could lead to dysfunctions [39]. It is
unclear if this would apply to voles since analyses of the
specific roles of these sites in Microtus are lacking.
The observed high level of diversity and the detection of
indels are unlikely to be due to gene duplications of
avpr1a or the occurrence of pseudo-genes. avpr1a is a single copy gene in humans [40] and in rat [41], and a duplication has been found only in M. ochrogaster [14]. We
cannot exclude that some of the detected variation stems
from the presence of very recently duplicated sequences in
some species. However, contrary to the truncated and
clearly divergent version of avpr1a in M. ochrogaster, we
found no indication for non-functionality in any of the
sequences, such as reading frame shifts due to insertions
or deletions of single nucleotides or the presence of premature stop codons [42]. This suggests that at least the
majority of avpr1a gene variants is functional.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/176

The potential functional relevance of variation in Microtine avpr1a is further emphasized by the detection of alleles coding for different protein types within the same
individuals. It is worth noting that this involved again the
ligand and G-protein binding domains. However, it is currently unclear if heterozygous individuals express different protein variants in the same tissue or if there is tissue
specific expression [see [15]]. Gene expression studies are
needed to investigate this further, since some receptor
functions can as well be substituted by other receptors for
hormones which are involved in very similar pathways
[30,43]. This distinction would be of pharmaceutical
importance for human health [see [44,45]]. Given the
high variability in protein types, Microtus voles could serve
as ideal models to study the processing and the expression
of avpr1a gene products and their functional consequences in homo- and heterozygous individuals since
they can be bred in the laboratory [21].
We further hypothesize that variation in the coding
sequence of avpr1a might be related to life history traits
(e.g. mating system, habitat), given the peripheral role of
the V1aR in water retention in the kidney [16], and the
social relevance when expressed in the brain [7-10].
Although kidney inefficiency was suggested as a major
reason for the restriction of some Microtus species to moist
habitat [46], we could not detect any connection between
receptor type and a given habitat. Species occupying dry
habitats (e.g. M. multiplex, M. arvalis, M. lusitanicus, M.
pinetorum, M. nivalis, [47-50]) or wet habitats (e.g. M.
agrestis, M. rossiaemeridionalis, M. tatricus and M.
oeconomus [51-53]) showed no specific V1aR types or AA
change corresponding to habitat requirements, nor were
they phylogenetically closely related (Figure 3). Additionally, there was no general association of AA variation in
Microtus avpr1a with social or genetic mating system. The
socially monogamous (defined by observational studies,
see in [54]) species M. ochrogaster, M. multiplex and M. pinetorum [51,52,55] shared neither a protein type nor a particular AA change. Similarly, neither showed the socially
non-monogamous species such as M. montanus, M. californicus and M. richardsoni [51,53,56] nor the genetically
non- monogamous species (M. arvalis, M. agrestis and M.
ochrogaster, [18,57-59]) identical AA alterations or protein
types among each other that could potentially be associated with behavioural patterns. It is obvious that the high
level of variation in the genus Microtus makes it very difficult to detect any direct associations of protein types or AA
changes with basic life history traits. Since inter- and intraspecific variation in mating behaviour and habitat usage
exist (e.g. for M. ochrogaster see [17]), studies on protein
variation within species are needed to investigate locally
adapted receptor types and their correlation to life history
traits.

Evidence for non-neutral evolution
Statistical tests for selection indicated mostly purifying
selection on the transmembrane partition of V1aR but
also a minor role for positive selection in shaping avpr1a
diversity in mammals. The sliding window analysis
detected positive selection mainly in the ligand binding
domain and an increased number of synonymous and
non-synonymus changes in the G-protein binding
domain. Branch-specific tests across mammals detected
positively selected sites mainly in the G-protein binding
domain. It is unclear why selection tests failed to detect a
deviation from neutrality overall, but the background of
purifying selection might be too high in comparison to
the positive selection acting on particular domains to
allow the signal to be picked up. Additionally, positive
selection evidenced by ω > 1 may be difficult to detect as
selection could also be acting on synonymous sites [6062].

The impact of positive selection on avpr1a diversity is less
evident within the Microtus genus than in evolutionarily
less related mammalian taxa. Overall selection tests
remained mostly inconclusive, which may be caused by a
lack of power due to the high rate of speciation and the
short divergence times between Microtus species [28].
Interestingly, the number of AA variants within Microtus
was still significantly higher in the ligand and G-protein
binding domains than in the transmembrane regions.
This pattern might reflect relaxed selective constraints at
the N-terminus and at the G-protein binding domain, and
stronger evolutionary constraints on the transmembrane
region due to structural limitations because of the embedding in the lipid layer. Alternatively, we suggest that this
high diversity in functionally important domains of the
gene is compatible with balancing selection maintaining
high allele diversity in selected regions [63,64]. However,
we shall need detailed studies at the population level to
asses the potential impact of this type of selection on
avpr1a diversity in Microtus further [65].

tion of the nucleotide sequences into AAs, because variation in Mus is reduced to 9% variable positions in IRBP
and 4% in RAG1 [67] whereas 11% variable positions in
the AA sequences remain in the vole avpr1a gene.
Our comparison of all currently available homologous
nuclear genes for the mouse-rat-vole trio showed for the
avpr1a gene a relatively high synonymous substitution
rate but a comparatively low non-synonymous substitution rate (Figure 6). It is unclear to which extent this comparison is somewhat biased by a generally stronger
interest and more published sequences of genes with high
mutation rates (e. g. MHC, BRCA [68,69]). It is nevertheless noteworthy that this comparison revealed higher
nucleotide and protein diversity in avpr1a than in other
related hormone receptors with similar functions (e.g.
oxytocin, see in [16,20,70]; serotonin, see in [71,72]; corticothropin, see in [73,74]).

Conclusion
Our analyses show that genetic diversity in the avpr1a
gene is much higher than previously claimed, and that
part of this variation might be functionally relevant. We
provide evidence for extensive variation in avpr1a at all
taxonomic levels of mammals, with many changes in
functionally important regions. We suggest that positive
selection acting on these operative domains helps to
maintain variation despite the presence of overall purifying selection. The role of balancing selection, particularly
within the genus Microtus, should nevertheless deserve
further investigation at the intra-specific level. The effects
of genetic variation in avpr1a on phenotypic traits like
mating systems, social behaviour or habitat requirements
in Microtus and other mammals are far from being characterized. As this study shows, it seems particularly important to characterize abundant genotypic and phenotypic
variation thoroughly before establishing general causal
links between genotypes and phenotypes.

Methods
Evolution of avpr1a variability in comparison to other
genes
The speed of evolutionary change in avpr1a is difficult to
assess because of the lack of data on nuclear mammalian
genes with similar taxonomic and geographic scope. The
only directly comparable data set from a nuclear gene covering several Microtus species comes from the p53 tumorsuppressor gene [66]. Variation in this gene is much lower
than in avpr1a with only a few silent mutations in coding
regions [66]. Additionally, nucleotide diversity in the fastevolving nuclear genes IRBP and RAG1 within the mouse
genus is lower than in Microtine avpr1a if the longer divergence time in Mus is taken into account (5 to 6 mya for
Mus, see in [67] vs. 1.2 to 2 mya for Microtus, see in [28]).
Variation in avpr1a appears here even higher after transla-

Samples
The V1aR is encoded by two exons: exon1 (~970 bp) and
exon2 (~290 bp). We sequenced part (792 bp) of the first
exon of the avpr1a gene since this fragment covers the two
functionally important regions (ligand and G-protein
binding domains) of the receptor. Sequences were analysed for 24 Microtus species which cover the entire Palearctic range of the genus (Europe, North America, Asia;
Table 1). Tissue samples were obtained by live trapping
with Longworth small mammal traps (Penlon Ltd), or
from ecologists studying the species. Genomic DNA was
extracted using a standard phenol-chloroform protocol
[75] or Magnetic beads (MagneSil™ BLUE, Promega). We
used two sequences from GenBank from M. ochrogaster

Moreover, we sequenced three rodent taxa (Arvicola terrestris, Apodemus sylvaticus and Clethrionomys glareolus, see
Table 1) and retrieved additional mammalian avpr1a

DNA sequencing
We amplified avpr1a sequences in a reaction volume of 25
µl in a GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems)
using Quiagen Taq polymerase. We used two primer pairs
for amplification and sequencing reactions: V1aR-5'exonProtF 5'-GAGCTTAGGACAGGCTTTCTCG-3' and V1aR5'exon-ProtR
5'-CGATCACGAAGGTCATCTTCAC-3',
Mus-Mic-exon1f
5'-CCGACAGCATGAGTTTCC-3'
together with Mus-Mic-exon1r 5'-CCACATCTGGACGATGAAGA-3'. The PCR amplification profile included an initial denaturation step at 92°C for 2 min, followed by 40
cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at
55°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 90 sec. A final
extension step of 72°C for 10 min was performed. Amplified fragments were controlled for size on a 1.5% agarose
gel by comparing them with a 100 base pair (bp) ladder
(Invitrogen). After cleaning with GenElute™ PCR clean-up
kit (Sigma) and dissolving products in 50 µl bi-distilled
water, the sequencing reaction was carried out in a 10 µl
reaction volume. Terminator Ready Reaction Mix 'Big
Dye' Version 3.1 from Applied Biosystems was used. Both
strands were sequenced using the following PCR conditions: An initial step of denaturation at 96°C for 10 sec,
followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 96°C for 10 sec,
annealing at 55°C for 10 sec, and extension at 72°C for 4
min 30 sec. The products were cleaned using a DyeEx 96
spin kit (Quiagen), and were separated and detected on an
ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyser from Applied Biosystems.
Cloning and sequencing of PCR products
PCR products of individuals showing heterozygous sites
in direct sequencing were cloned using the Qiagen PCR
Cloning Kit. Purified PCR products were quantified in a
Spectrophotometer (Gene Quant pro RNA/DNA Calculator, Biochrom) and approximately 65 ng of the product
were ligated into pDrive Cloning Vector (Qiagen) in 10 µl

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/176

reactions. Reactions were incubated for 45 min at 4°C
before heat shock transformation into QIAGEN EZ Competent Cells. An additional incubation step of 45 min at
37°C with shaking was done before plating to allow
recombinant growth. Cells were plated onto KanamycinIPTG-X-Gal agar and cultured for 17 h at 37°C. Ten positive clones per individual were randomly selected and further grown in LB broth for 17 h at 37°C with shaking.
Plasmid miniprep columns (QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit,
Qiagen) were used to purify each clone before sequencing
with both M13 universal 5'-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT3'and M13 reverse 5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3' primers. Sequencing conditions were as follows: An initial step
of denaturation at 90°C for 50 sec, followed by 25 cycles
of denaturation at 90°C for 10 sec, annealing at 50°C for
10 sec, and extension at 60°C for 4 min. After a final
cleaning step with a DyeEx 96 spin kit (Quiagen), the
sequences were run on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyser from Applied Biosystems.
Statistical analyses
Sequences were aligned using the Clustal W algorithm
[78] implemented in the program BioEdit 5.0.9 [79], and
were revised manually. Shared sequence types were
detected using the program Arlequin 3.1 [80]. Phylogenetic relationships among sequenced chromosomes were
reconstructed by obtaining neighbour-joining (NJ) [81]
and maximum likelihood (ML) trees rooted with Monodelphis domestica for the mammalian taxa and rooted with
Arvicola terrestris for the Microtus genus with 10,000 bootstrap replicates in Mega 3 [82] and Paup 4.0 b [83]. For the
ML analysis, Modeltest 3.06 [84] implemented in Paup
4.0 b [83] was used to estimate the most suitable model
of DNA substitution, by performing hierarchical likelihood ratio tests to compare 52 different models and by
applying the Akaike Information Criterion [85]. For the
Microtus genus, the best substitution model was the transversion model with gamma distribution (TVM+G) with
the following parameters: Substitution rate matrix: A↔C
2.7903; A↔G and C↔T 9.3807; A↔T 1.1820; C↔G
0.9720; G↔T 1.0000; and gamma distribution shape
parameter 0.1986. The base frequencies were estimated
as: A: 0.1801, C: 0.2951, G: 0.2963, T: 0.2285.

For the mammalian phylogeny, the best substitution
model was the general time reversible model with invariable sites and gamma distribution (GTR+I+G) [86,87].
The following parameters for the model were estimated:
Substitution rate matrix: A↔C 1.7329; A↔G 5.3823;
A↔T 0.6124; C↔G 1.4182; C↔T 3.8055; G↔T 1.0000;
proportion of invariable sites 0.4474 and gamma distribution shape parameter 3.0860. The base frequencies
were estimated as: A: 0.1566, C: 0.3344, G: 0.3228, T:
0.1862.

The nucleotide sequences were translated into AA
sequences in Mega 3 using the universal code. The positions of the AA changes were determined using the structural model of the arginine-vasopressin 1a receptor of Mus
musculus [16]. To determine whether changes are equally
distributed across the model, we applied Chi-Square tests
for the different structural regions (ligand binding
domain, transmembrane regions and G-protein binding
domain). AA changes were classified as radical or conservative by comparing physicochemical properties of AAs
such as charge, polarity and volume following Zhang [29].
To test for a link between V1aR types and phylogenetic
relationships between Microtus, we checked for branch
specific AA changes of avpr1a on a mitochondrial cytochrome b gene phylogeny [see in [28]] with sequences
obtained from GenBank (accession numbers: AF119280,
AF159400, AF163890 –AF163891, AF163893, AF163896,
–AF163901,

AY513798,
AY513816,
AY513819,
AY513829,
AY513837, AY513840, AY513845). To contrast the synonymous and non-synonymous diversity found in the
avpr1a gene to other nuclear genes, we performed an
exhaustive GenBank search for all annotated gene
sequences available for Microtus species (up to december
20th, 2006). The resulting 31 sequences were aligned with
homologous genes from Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus and synonymous and non-synonymous substitution
rates for each gene were computed with Mega 3.
Tests for selective neutrality
We tested for regions under positive selection along the
mammalian avpr1a by estimating the ratio ω of non-synonymous changes (dN) over synonymous changes (dS)
per site. We used a sliding window approach with a window size of 30 and a step size of 10 with the program
DnaSP 4.10 to compare mammalian species against the
marsupial Monodelphis domestica.

To further test for the impact of selection on particular
sites in avpr1a, we used a maximum likelihood approach
with the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC)
method implemented in HyPhy which makes no assumption about rate variation between lineages [88-90]. Further statistical tests for selection involved the computation
of lineage-specific ratios of ω using codon-based maximum likelihood methods implemented in the program
"codeml" from the PAML package [91]. As a basis for
these analyses, we used a phylogenetic tree tested for consistent topology between ML and NJ as well as with data
from 3rd codon positions only [see [92]].
We used likelihood ratio tests in PAML to compare different neutral (MO, M1, M7) and selection (M2, M8) models

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/176

of DNA sequence evolution of avpr1a. In all these tests,
two times the log-likelihood difference (2∆l) between
models is compared to a χ2 distribution with the number
of degrees of freedom (dF) equal to the difference in the
number of parameters between the models [93]. We
tested for rate heterogeneity among lineages by comparing the one ratio model M0 against the discrete model M3
where different rates are allowed [93]. This test is mainly
used to check for rate variation of ω, but it can also be used
to detect positive selection [94]. Additionally, the neutral
model M1 with two ratio classes of ω (< 1 and 1) was compared to the selection model M2 which allows for an additional class where ω > 1 [93]. A similar comparison was
carried out between a neutral model assuming a beta distribution of ω (M7), and a model with similar characteristics but allowing for positively selected sites (M8) [93].
We performed branch specific tests to examine whether
avpr1a evolves differently in the higher mammalian taxa
by comparing the neutral model M1 with model MA
which allows for positively selected sites on a pre-selected
branch [91,94].
