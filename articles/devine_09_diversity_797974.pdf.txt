Abstract
Background: The last step in the maturation process of the large subunit of [NiFe]-hydrogenases is a
proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal by a hydrogenase specific protease. Contrary to other accessory
proteins these hydrogenase proteases are believed to be specific whereby one type of hydrogenases
specific protease only cleaves one type of hydrogenase. In cyanobacteria this is achieved by the gene
product of either hupW or hoxW, specific for the uptake or the bidirectional hydrogenase respectively.
The filamentous cyanobacteria Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 and Nostoc sp strain PCC 7120 may
contain a single uptake hydrogenase or both an uptake and a bidirectional hydrogenase respectively.
Results: In order to examine these proteases in cyanobacteria, transcriptional analyses were performed
of hupW in Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 and hupW and hoxW in Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120. These
studies revealed numerous transcriptional start points together with putative binding sites for NtcA
(hupW) and LexA (hoxW). In order to investigate the diversity and specificity among hydrogeanse specific
proteases we constructed a phylogenetic tree which revealed several subgroups that showed a striking
resemblance to the subgroups previously described for [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Additionally the proteases
specificity was also addressed by amino acid sequence analysis and protein-protein docking experiments
with 3D-models derived from bioinformatic studies. These studies revealed a so called "HOXBOX"; an
amino acid sequence specific for protease of Hox-type which might be involved in docking with the large
subunit of the hydrogenase.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the hydrogenase specific proteases are under similar regulatory
control as the hydrogenases they cleave. The result from the phylogenetic study also indicates that the
hydrogenase and the protease have co-evolved since ancient time and suggests that at least one major
horizontal gene transfer has occurred. This co-evolution could be the result of a close interaction between
the protease and the large subunit of the [NiFe]-hydrogenases, a theory supported by protein-protein
docking experiments performed with 3D-models. Finally we present data that may explain the specificity
seen among hydrogenase specific proteases, the so called "HOXBOX"; an amino acid sequence specific
for proteases of Hox-type. This opens the door for more detailed studies of the specificity found among
hydrogenase specific proteases and the structural properties behind it.

Background
Cyanobacteria evolved more then 2.0 billion years ago
and were the first organisms to perform oxygenic photosynthesis [1,2]. They exist in many different shapes and
forms e.g. unicellular, filamentous and colonial and can
even form symbiosis with a variety of organisms [3]. Several cyanobacterial strains also have the ability to fix
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium, a process performed by the enzyme complex nitrogenase. Among filamentous cyanobacteria like Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120
and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 (from now on
referred to as Nostoc PCC 7120 and Nostoc punctiforme),
both used in the present study, this process takes place in
specialised cells called heterocysts in which a thick envelope and lack of photosystem II activity creates a nearly
oxygen free environment for the nitrogenase [3,4]. The
same nitrogenase is also a key player in the hydrogen (H2)
metabolism by producing H2 as a by-product during the
fixing of atmospheric nitrogen (N2). In addition, cyanobacteria may also possess distinct [NiFe]-hydrogenases.
The cyanobacterial hydrogenases can functionally be
divided into two groups; uptake hydrogenases, dimeric
HupSL, that consumes H2, and bi-directional hydrogenases, pentameric HoxYHEFU, that can both consume
and produce H2 [3]. In the case of Nostoc PCC 7120 both
hydrogenases may be present, while Nostoc punctiforme
only contains the uptake hydrogenase [3,5].
The cyanobacterial uptake hydrogenase is closely connected to both the N2-fixing process and the occurrence of
a nitrogenase, recycling the H2 and thereby regaining
energy and electrons. The function of the bi-directional
hydrogenase is more unclear and suggestions range from
functioning as a mediator of reducing power during
anaerobic conditions to it being part of respiratory complex I [3].
Both types of hydrogenases go through an extensive maturation process that involves several different accessory
proteins. Even though much is still to be learned about
this maturation process in cyanobacteria, comprehensive
studies in other organisms like Escherichia coli have been
performed [6,7]. Particularly the large subunit of [NiFe]hydrogenase (HupL and HoxH in cyanobacteria) requires
numerous accessory proteins responsible for metal transport, biosynthesis and insertion of the metal atoms nickel
and iron into its active site. The genes encoding for these
proteins are usually referred to as the hyp-genes and have
been identified in many organisms including several
cyanobacterial strains [3]. The Hyp-proteins are considered unspecific and there is usually only one set of hypgenes irrespective of the number hydrogenases in a single
strain [8,9]. It was recently suggested that a set of protein
encoding genes within the extended hyp-operon of Nostoc

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/53

PCC 7120 may be involved in the maturation of the small
subunit of the cyanobacterial uptake hydrogenase [10].
The final step in the maturation process of the large subunit is a proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal, which
results in a conformational change, and the association of
the large subunit to the small subunit [11,12]. The
number of amino acids that are cleaved off varies between
different hydrogenases and organisms but the cleavage
always takes place after the conserved motif DPCXXCXXH/R resulting in the histidine being the new C-terminal amino acid [11-14]. Several experiments together with
sequencing data have indicated that these putative proteases, contrary to the Hyp-proteins, are specific to different hydrogenases; not only to hydrogenases in different
bacterial strains but also to different hydrogenases within
the same strain [12,15]. In both Nostoc punctiforme and
Nostoc PCC 7120 putative proteases have been identified
through secondary and tertiary structure alignments [16].
The protein product of the gene hupW is believed to process HupL (the large subunit of the uptake hydrogenase)
and can be found in both cyanobacterial strains. Nostoc
PCC 7120 however, which in addition harbours a bidirectional hydrogenase, also contains hoxW whose protein product is believed to be involved in the processing of
HoxH [5,16].
It is still unknown exactly how the recognition of the different hydrogenases takes place and which part(s) of the
protease determines specificity. A crystal structure of a
large subunit- protease complex is still not yet available
from any organism. However, the protease HupD from E.
coli has been crystallised giving vital clues about its function [17]. The importance of Ni-incorporation into the
active site for any cleavage to occur has been addressed
[13,18,19] and together with amino acid replacement
experiments, it has been shown that nickel is an important substrate recognition motif. In addition the protease
binds directly to the metal [17,19] and the crystal structure of HybD in E. coli showed that three amino acids;
Glu16, Asp62 and His93, are most likely to be involved in
the metal binding [17].
Contrary to the lack of functional studies of cyanobacterial hydrogenases extensive studies have been done on the
transcriptional regulation of cyanobacterial hydrogenases
and their accessory genes [3]. Several putative binding
sites of different transcription factors have been reported
in connection with the uptake hydrogenase such as FNR
(fumarate-nitrate reduction) in Anabaena variabilis and the
global nitrogen regulatory protein NtcA in Nostoc punctiforme, Lyngbya majuscule CCAP 1446/4 and Gloeothece sp.
strain ATCC 27152 and IHF (integrated host factor) in
Nostoc punctiforme and Lyngbya majuscule CCAP 1446/4
[3]. Participation by the transcription factor NtcA fits in

well with the known connection between the uptake
hydrogenase and N2 fixation. Further it has been shown
that the uptake hydrogenase is only transcribed under N2fixing conditions and in connection with heterocyst formation [20,21].

Nostoc PCC 7120, under both N2-fixing and non N2-fixing
conditions. In addition, we address the question of the
diversity, specificity and evolution of the hydrogenase
specific proteases in cyanobacteria.

Results
The genes encoding the bi-directional hydrogenase, contrary to the uptake hydrogenase, are transcribed in both
heterocysts and vegetative cells and under both non N2and N2-fixing conditions [3]. So far, two transcription factors have been identified in connection with the bi-directional hydrogenase, LexA and an AbrB-like protein [2224].

Diversity of cyanobacterial hydrogenase specific proteases
To examine the diversity of hydrogenase specific proteases
and their relationship to each other, in cyanobacteria and
other microorganisms, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using both PAUP and MrBayes analysis. Since no
suitable outgroup has been found for the proteases at this
stage, a non-rooted tree was constructed including claude
creditability values. The resulting tree from the MrBayes
analysis revealed several subgroups among the hydrogenase specific proteases, which correlates with respective

In the present study we investigate the transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding hydrogenase specific proteases hupW in Nostoc punctiforme and hupW and hoxW in

An extended phylogenetic tree was also constructed containing more strains including hydrogenase specific proteases cleaving type 3b-hydrogenases. This tree was
unfortunately less reliable and far from robust with several weak nodes (Additional file 1 and Additional file 2).
However the result showed putative group 1 proteases
and putative group 3b proteases as less clustered and
instead spread around point X (Figure 1 and Additional

from Nostoc PCC 7120 revealed two transcripts. The first is
shorter (approx. 500 nt) and present under both N2-fixing
and non N2-fixing conditions, while the second longer
transcript (approx. 1600 nt) is only present under N2-fixing conditions. The size of the longer transcript is comparable with the size of a two-gene operon containing hupW
together with the upstream gene alr1422, a gene of
unknown function (Figure 3a). RT-PCR confirmed that
the two genes are co transcribed (Figure 3a). Additional
5'RACE experiments revealed three TSPs whereby the first
is located 234 bp upstream of hupW. Succeeding bioinformatic studies identified a putative σ70-like -10 and 35 box (Figure 3a) (TATAAT respectively TTAAAA) and
two imperfect putative NtcA binding sites (TGAN8CAC
and GTAN12TAC). By running the complete intergenic
region in BLAST at Cyanobase two conserved regions were
also discovered. Both can be found in the intergenic
regions of several genes in Nostoc PCC 7120 and Anabaena
variabilis ATCC 29413 (data now shown). Their function
is unclear but one of them shows similarity to the consensus sequence WATCAANNNNTTR from the previously
described IHF binding sites [26]. The second and third
TSPs were identified inside the gene alr1422, 4 bp and 14
bp downstream of the putative translation start site. A new
putative translation start site within the same frame was
found 115 bp downstream from the previously suggested
start site. By analysing the sequence of the promoter
region a -10 box (TATTTT and TATCAT), a -35 box
(TTAAAC and TACCGA) and two putative NtcA binding
sites (GTAN8AAC/GTN10AC) 147/157 bp and 62/72 bp
upstream of the two TSPs were also identified.
For Nostoc punctiforme a transcript of hupW of about 1300
nt, is only present in N2-fixing cultures (Figure 2).
5'RACEs identified a single TSP 607 bp upstream of hupW
in Nostoc punctiforme, together with a σ70-like -10 box
sequence (TAGGCT) and a putative NtcA binding site
(GTAN8CAC) located 40 bp upstream from the TSP (Figure 3b). The resulting transcript includes the upstream
gene Npun_F0373, which was confirmed by RT-PCR
using primers for the subsequent PCR covering the intergenic region and agrees with the result from the Northern
blot experiments (Figure 2 and 3b).

can be identified. The gene is truncated in Nodularia
spumigena CCY 9414 but is intact in the other strains and
in two cases (Nostoc punctiforme and Nodularia spumigena
CCY 9414) it is located directly upstream of hupW and/or
the uptake hydrogenase genes. Alignments of the promoter sequence of these genes show highly conserved
promoter regions, all containing putative NtcA binding
sites, -10 box, putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence and even
suggests a putative TSP for four out of the five genes (the
gene Npun_F0373 homologue in Nodularia spumigena
CCY9414 is probably transcribed with the upstream gene,
hupL) (Figure 4). Bio-informatic studies of Npun_F0373
propose a transmembrane region between amino acids
84–105 but showed no other domains or sites giving clues
to its function. However, when comparing strains that
either harbour or lack the gene, it was found that among
the strains containing Npun_F0373 and its homologues,
the ability to form heterocysts is a shared feature (Additional file 4).
Transciptional studies of hoxW in Nostoc sp strain PCC
7120
hoxW is located between the genes all0771 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) and all0769 (acetyl-CoA
synthetase), both with no known relationship to H2

metabolism, and around 4.7 kbp downstream of the hoxHYU operon [23] on the opposite strand (Figure 5).
Northern blot hybridisation of hoxW was performed using
RNA isolated from both N2-fixing and non N2-fixing cultures indicating an increased level of hoxW under N2-fixing conditions and revealing several transcripts ranging
from ~1000-500 nt (Figure 5b). This was confirmed by
5'RACE experiments that showed TSPs at both 44 bp and
70 bp upstream of hoxW. When analysing the promoter
region, a σ70-like -10 box (TAGCTT) was identified for the
TSP, 70 bp upstreams of hoxW, but no -35 box while the
TSP, 44 bp upstream of hoxW, contains a putative -35 box
(TTAAAA) but no clear -10 box (Figure 5a).
When analysing the complete intergenic region between
hoxW and its upstream gene all0771 two conserved
regions appeared (Figure 5a). Both regions can be found
in between genes in numerous cases especially in the
genome of Nostoc PCC 7120 and Anabaena variabilis ATCC
29413. The first conserved region, situated 204–231 bp
upstream of hoxW, consists of four repeats, which when
run through Mfold forms a putative hairpin (dG = 10.21). The second region is located 162–195 bp
upstream of hoxW and its sequence TAGTAGTTATGTAAT(N12)TAGCTT shows resemblance to a LexA binding

Specificity of HupW and HoxW in cyanobacteria
To address the protease specificity an alignment of protein
sequences was performed to search for conserved regions
specific to each protease group, HupW and HoxW (group
2 and 3d, Figure 1), in cyanobacteria. This study revealed
that one of the conserved regions among the proteases is
highly dissimilar when comparing HupW and HoxW in
cyanobacteria (Figure 6 and Figure 7a). In most proteases,
including HupW, this region consists of the sequence
D(G/C/F)GT (aa 41–44 in HupW of Nosotoc PCC 7120)
while among the HoxW proteases it is replaced by the
sequence H(Q/I)L (aa 42–44 in HoxW of Nostoc PCC
7120) (the latter now on referred to as the HOXBOX).

To get a better understanding of this region and its possible function bio-informatic work was performed targeting
conserved and similar amino acids on the surface of putative HoxW and putative HupW in Nostoc PCC 7120 and
HybD in E. coli together with protein-protein docking
experiments using the docking algorithm BiGGER. The
studies showed that the conserved residues are not evenly
distributed but clustered around the proposed nickel
binding residues Glu16 and His93 (HybD – E. coli) [17]
and around the conserved "HOXBOX" region for all three

cases. In HupW and HybD conserved surface areas could
also be found along alpha helix 1, beta sheet 2 and alpha
helix 4 [16,17] (Figure 7a–b).
Protein docking experiments resulted in 11 hits for HybCHybD (E. coli), 84 hits for HybB-HynC (Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Miyazaki F) and 28 hits for HoxH-HoxW (Nostoc
PCC 7120). The best hit for HybD in E. coli and HoxW in
Nostoc PCC 7120 can be seen in Figure 7c, a target-probe
complex whereby the HOXBOX of the protease is in a less
favourable position for C-terminal cleavage. This means
that the HOXBOX is either facing away from the C-terminal or that other residues are blocking making it difficult
for physical contact to occur without major conformation
changes. This was the case for 70% of the hits and the
average distance of Gly42/His42 (HybD/HoxW) in the
HOXBOX to the last amino acid of the C-terminal was
around 17–20 Å. The majority of the hits indicated that
the HOXBOX region and the areas around alpha helix 1,
beta sheet 2 and alpha helix 4 are in close interaction with
the large subunit of the hydrogenase. This is especially
true for the HybC-HybD complex while HoxH-HoxW
showed a preference for a more narrow interaction with
only the closest residues around Asp16 and His88 and the
HOXBOX involved in the contact with HupL. The preferred docking result for HybD in E. coli and HoxW in Nostoc PCC 7120 reflects the results from the studies of the

conserved asparagines (underlined) are believed to be involved in binding to the nickel of the large hydrogenase subunit.
Between these asparagines there is a conserved area of unknown function, the so called "HOXBOX". As seen in this figure,
although differing among organism, it is in fact conserved within groups of hydrogenase specific proteases i.e. proteases of 3d/

Discussion
Diversity of cyanobacterial hydrogenase specific proteases
Previous phylogenetic studies of hydrogenases in different
microorganisms [3,28,29] clearly divide the proteins into
four classes [28,29]. One of the most extensive studies,
using over 80 microorganisms, showed that the large and
the small subunit of the hydrogenase enzyme evolved
together and have been two tightly connected subunits for
probably all of their evolutionary history [25]. When
comparing the evolution of hydrogenases with the present
study of hydrogenase specific proteases some striking
resemblances appear which indicate a similar development and co-evolution between the large subunit of the
hydrogenases and their specific proteases (Figure 1).

Within the phylogenetic tree of the hydrogenase specific
proteases similar groups appear as seen among the hydrogenase subunits. This is especially true for the proteases in
group 1, 2, 3a and 4. Just as the hydrogenase subunit HycE
in E. coli (group 4) is most closely related to the archean
hydrogenases (group 3) so is its hydrogenase specific protease HycI (group 4) most closely related to group 3 proteases. The resemblance between the phylogenetic trees
suggests that the co-evolution between the hydrogenase

and the hydrogenase specific protease is of ancient origin
and an explanation for this might be found in the mechanism of the cleavage process. It has previously been suggested that a conformational recognition takes place
between the protease and the large subunit [19] which
may through the years enhanced the specificity seem
among proteases.
The Hox-specific proteases of group 3d are the exception
and can be found as an independent group (Figure 1).
Further studies, even though not as robust, also show proteases of 3b type and Additional proteases of group 1 type
being spread either individually or on branches around
point X (Additional file 1). These results contradict previous evolutionary studies of their respective hydrogenases
which have placed group 3b/3d hydrogenases as clearly
defined subgroups within group 3 [NiFe]-hydrogenases
[29]. By comparing the [NiFe]-hydrogenase phylogenetic
tree with the protease phylogenetic tree presented in this
study, it also becomes apparent that neither group 1, 2 or
3d would be the deepest branch in a rooted version of the
tree. Such a tree would suggest that proteases within the
groups 3b/3d developed before the proteases of group 3a
and 4, which seems far-fetched since proteases of group 3a
and 4 type cleaves hydrogenases that are deeper branched
then the 3b/3d hydrogenases.

We therefore suggest that the placement of HOX-specific
proteases (3d) and the scattered result of 3b proteases in
the phylogenetic tree may be the result of horizontal gene
transfer (HGT). HGT is today seen as a major force in evolution and has occurred numerous times between archaea
and bacteria [30-33]. Within prokaryotes almost no gene
family is untouched by HGT [34] and there are also
numerous cases of HGT within cyanobacteria [35].
[NiFe]-hydrogenases have not been spared from this
mechanism and an archaeal organism is believed to be the
origin of the Ech- hydrogenase in Thermotoga maritima
[36].
By comparing the phylogenetic tree of hydrogenases and
their specific protease and assuming that the [NiFe]hydrogenase and its specific protease have evolved
together the most likely scenario is that an early group 3
[NiFe]-hydrogenase with or without its specific protease
was transferred, most probably from an archaeal organism to a bacterial. If we assume that the type 3 hydrogenase and the protease transferred together then this
indicates that most likely the root of the tree should be
placed between group 3a and 4 (point Z; Figure 1) and
that the protease transferred is the ancestor of all type 1, 2
and 3d proteases (Figure 8). If we assume the opposite,
(that the hydrogenase transferred alone), then the root
should instead be placed between type 1/2/3d and type
3a/4 proteases (point Y; Figure 1) and the transferred
hydrogenase must have incorporated an already existing
type 1 protease to its maturation process. The scattered
impression of type 1 and 3b proteases from the less robust
phylogenetic tree with additional hydrogenase specific
proteases (Additional file 1) could be the result e.g. older
phylum branching off close to the HGT point, poor resolution of the phylogenetic tree or by additional HGT and
so does not contradict our proposed theory of HGT. Rooting the tree with an outgroup; germination protease
(GPR), the closest relative to the [NiFe]-hydrogenase specific proteases, (data not shown) placed the root between
group 3a and 4 suggest that the first scenario, a root
between group 3a and 4, is more plausible (point Z; Figure 1). However, all attempts at rooting the tree resulted
in very unstable phylogenetic trees. When considering
both GPR endopeptidase function (bacterial spoluration)
and taxonomic location (bacterial phylum of firmicutes
only) it is plausible that the [NiFe]-hydrogenase specific
proteases are instead the ancestor of GPR, making any tree
with GPR as outgroup unreliable.
Based on the tree of life we also propose that the HGT of
probably a 3b similar type protease/hydrogenase most
likely took place before the diversification of the bacterial
phylum and group 1 hydrogenases. [37,38]. By comparing our result with genomic timescales of prokaryotic evolution we can even suggest a time for the event of around

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/53

3–3.5 billion years ago [39,40]. This is based on that the
archaeal phylum and classes started to evolve earlier
(between 4-3 billion years ago) then the bacterial (~3-2.5
billion years ago) and the proposition that methanogenesis was one of the first metabolical pathways to be developed [39]. Since group 3a-3b hydrogenases, have
previously been shown to be connected to methanogenesis [29] this data supports our suggestion of an early differentiation of group 3 hydrogenases. It should be noted
that this proposed theory does not contradict previous
suggestions of an early pre-LUCA existence and diversification of hydrogenases but rather clarifies the picture
[29,41]. The effect this proposed HGT had on bacterial
evolution is not clear but HGT in general may have had a
significant effect on the diversification of bacterial species
by introducing new metabolic pathways and traits
[42,43].
Large-scale molecular genetic analysis of the DNA
sequence (like studies of gene order and G-C content)
could give a clearer picture however, because the HGT
might have occurred more then 3 billion years ago mechanisms like amelioration will most likely have erased all
evidence.
Transcriptional studies of hupW in Nostoc punctiforme
ATCC 29133 and Nostoc sp strain PCC 7120
It is interesting that hupW in both Nostoc punctiforme and
Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120 are only or mainly transcribed
under N2-fixing conditions even though it is not a surprising discovery. The same pattern has been observed for the
uptake hydrogenase whose function has previously been
connected to N2-fixing [3]. This suggests that the hupW
proteases are under the same or similar transcriptional
regulation as the hydrogenases they cleave. This expression pattern could be explained by the putative NtcA
binding sites in the promoter region of hupW in both Nostoc punctiforme and Nostoc PCC 7120 (Figure 3b). NtcA
binding sites have been found upstream of hupSL in Gloeothece sp. ATCC 27152 [44], Nostoc punctiforme [45], Lyngbya majuscule CCAP 1446/4 [46] and Anabaena variabilis
ATCC 29413 [47], and putative binding sites have been
observed upstream of the hyp-genes in Nostoc punctiforme
[48].

The two putative NtcA binding sites (TGAN8CAC and
GTAN12TAC) identified upstream of the TSP of hupW in
Nostoc PCC 7120 are imperfect when compared with the
sequence signature of NtcA (GTAN8TAC) [49,50]. These
sites are therefore likely to have none or a very weak binding affinity to NtcA and the two conserved regions
observed downstream of the TSP may be the target of
additional transcription factors. Sequences similar to
these conserved regions were also found in the intergenic
regions of several other genes in Nostoc PCC 7120 and

Illustration showing the proposed horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of a type 3 hydrogenase/protease from an
archaeal organism to a bacterial organism. The result form the phylogenetic tree indicates that it has been at least one
major HGT event within the evolution of [NiFe]-hydrogenases and the hydrogenase specific proteases. Our results suggest
that the root may be placed between group 3a and 4 of the hydrogenase specific proteases which would mean that the proteolytic cleavage of the hydrogenase large subunit by a protease originated within the archaean superkingdom. This illustration
indicates the proposed HGT that transferred the protease to bacteria, which could then have been incorporated to the maturations process of type 1 and 2 hydrogenases. This theory does not rule out that additional HGT might have occurred and in
this illustration type 4 hydrogenases within proteobacteria, together with their specific protease, are shown as the result of a
similar HGT. This is still unclear though and the type 4 hydrogenases might have existed in both bacteria and archaea from the
start. Large circle; hydrogenase, small circle; protease, red/orange colour; suggested archaean origin, blue colour; suggested

Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 (data not shown) and
one of the conserved regions shows resemblance to an
IHF binding site and the consensus sequence WATCAANNNNTTR [26,51]. Binding sites for IHF have previously been found in the promoter region of hupSL in
Nostoc punctiforme [45] and Lyngbya majuscula [46] but
have also been observed upstream of the hup genes in
Bradyrhizobium japonicum [52], the nif genes in purple bacteria [53] and the nif operon in Anabaena azollae [54].
Transciptional studies of hoxW in Nostoc sp strain PCC
7120
Contrary to the hupW regulation, the result from the
Northern blot studies of transcript level on hoxW in Nostoc
PCC 7120 showed only a minor difference between non
N2-fixing (lower) and N2-fixing conditions (higher). Con-

sidering the very small difference seen in transcript level
the main function of the bi-directional hydrogenase and
its specific protease indicate that it is not connected to N2fixation. Studies of the transcript levels of the bi-directional hydrogenase subunit hoxH, when shifted from non
N2-fixing to N2-fixing (Nostoc muscorum) or to N2 limiting
(Gloeocapsa alpicola) conditions, shows either no effect
(Nostoc; [20]) or very small effect (Gloeocapsa; [55]). However further studies of the bi-directional hydrogenase
activity in Gloeocapsa alpicola actually showed significantly
increased activity even though the relative abundance of
hoxH (and hoxY) transcript did not change [55].
Conserved regions were identified in the promoter region
of hoxW. The first region, containing a short tandemly
repeated repetitive (STRR) sequence, has the ability to

Page 11 of 19

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:53

form a hairpin loop which is not unusual in filamentous
cyanobacteria and has been found between hupS and hupL
in Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, Nostoc PCC 7120, Nostoc punctiforme and Lyngbya majuscula CCAP 1446/4
[46,56,57]. In cyanobacteria they are usually made up of
7 bp repeats and even if their function is still not known
they may be involved in increasing transcript stability or
confer a translation coupling between genes [3,56,58].
Hairpin structures in the DNA sequence can also result in
pauses during transcription or even act as a termination
site [26]. The latter is a more likely scenario in this case
since the putative hairpin is positioned close to the 3' end
of the previous gene all0769 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
dioxygenase), which is not co-transcribed with hoxW.
The second conserved region in the hoxW promoter region
shows a strong resemblance to the consensus sequence
RGTACNNNDGTWCB of a LexA binding site [27]. LexA
has previously been shown to bind to the promoter region
of the hox-genes in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803
[22,59] and Nostoc PCC 7120 [23], and the hyp-genes in
Lyngbya majuscula CCAP 1446/4 [60].
Specificity of HupW and HoxW in cyanobacteria
An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of several groups of proteases revealed that one of the conserved
regions found in hydrogenase specific proteases was
replaced by a new, unique region in HoxW proteases
(group 3d), the so called HOXBOX (aa 42–44 in HoxW,
Nostoc PCC 7120). This novel observation of a conserved
group specific region may be an important finding for the
understanding of the specificity and function of hydrogenase specific proteases. The function of this region in
hydrogenase specific proteases has previously been under
speculation with some suggesting that it functions as a catalytic site for the proteolytic cleavage [17,61] and others
that it is involved in substrate binding [17]. Amino acid
replacement, whereby Asp38 in HycI in E. coli was
changed to an asparagine showed no effect on the cleavage process [62] which of course does not rule out that
other parts of this region might be of importance.

In silico location studies of conserved surface residues of
different proteases identified that the conserved amino
acids are unevenly distributed on the surface and concentrated to certain regions (Figure 7b). To find conserved
residues around the proposed nickel binding amino acids
Glu16 and His93 (HybD – E. coli) is to be expected considering the importance of these residues for substrate
binding. Interestingly, conserved residues were also
observed around the HOXBOX region and further on
along alpha helix 1, beta sheet 2 and alpha helix 4 [16,17],
especially in group 1 and 2 of the proteases. This could be
due to their importance for the overall structure of the
protein but could also indicate that these areas are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/53

involved in either cleavage function or docking between
the protease and the large hydrogenase subunit. The latter
theory coincides well with the result from the protein
docking studies (Figure 7c). The same areas that contain a
high degree of conserved residues were in the docking
result often seen in close contact with the hydrogenase.
The protein docking results, performed with hydrogenases and proteases from several organisms, places the
HOXBOX alternatively the corresponding region continuously in unfavourable positions for C-terminal cleavage
making its possible function as a catalytic site unlikely.
Added to the already mentioned observation that this
region exist in two variations (i.e. the HOXBOX or D(G/
C/F)GT) it seems more reasonable it is involved in substrate binding and recognition and might even be important for the proteases specificity.
It should be mentioned that these protein-docking studies
are mostly performed with 3D-models constructed
through protein threading since no crystallised hydrogenase and protease exist from the same organism. Even
though the proteins used in this study are related, the
sequence identities are sometimes low (20–25%) but
increases in the putative docking areas (30–40%). The
large subunit of the hydrogenase is also believed to exist
in an open conformation, which probably makes the
nickel associated to the active site of the hydrogenase
accessible for the protease [7]. An open conformation
could have an immense effect on any kind of proteasehydrogenase interaction but is with today's knowledge
impossible to predict.

Conclusion
An understanding of the transcriptional regulation of
hydrogenase specific proteases in cyanobacteria is starting
to emerge. It suggests that the hydrogenase specific proteases in cyanobacteria are under very similar regulatory
control as the hydrogenases they cleave. The two proteins
also appear to have a close physical interaction during the
cleavage moment, which could explain the specificity seen
among proteases and the resemblance seen between the
protease and the hydrogenase phylogenetic trees, and this
interaction might be of very ancient origin. After comparing the phylogenetic tree of hydrogenases and their specific proteases we suggest that a group 3 hydrogenase
spread through HGT to the bacterial domain, probably
together with a hydrogenase specific protease indicating
that the proteolytic cleavage first evolved within group 3a/
4 hydrogenases. We also propose that all 3d-type hydrogenases within bacteria evolved from this group 3 hydrogenase and therefore are the result of the same HGT event.
Finally the novel observation of the so called HOXBOX
may help in understanding the specificity seen among
hydrogenase specific proteases and is an interesting target
for further studies.

Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Cyanobacterial strains used in these experimental studies,
Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120 (also known as Anabaena sp.
strain PCC 7120) [63], and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC
29133 (also known as Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102) [64]
were grown in BG11o medium (N2-fixing cultures) at
30°C under continuous light (40 μmol photons s-1m-2)
and by sparging with air as previously described [65]. For
non N2-fixing growth (cultures with no heterocysts)
NH4Cl (2.5 mM) and MOPS (0.5 mM), adjusted to pH
7.8, were added to the medium. All cultures were mixed
using a magnetic stirrer. Escherichia coli strains were grown
in LB medium or on agar plates containing LB medium
and antibiotics of interest at 37°C.
RNA and DNA isolation
N2-fixing cell cultures were harvested in room temperature for DNA isolation as previously described [5] with the
exception that 2 M instead of 3 M of NaAc was used. RNA
was extracted from both N2-fixing and non N2-fixing cultures by centrifugation of the cells (4,500 × g for 10 in) in
room temperature followed by resuspension in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Sigma). The cells were then disrupted with
0.2 g of acid washed 0.6-mm-diameter glass beads by
using a Fast-prep (Precellys®24) at a speed of 5.5 for 3 × 20
s, keeping the samples on ice in between runs. Phases
were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min
at 4°C and the cleared solution was then transferred to
new tubes and incubated at room temperature for 5 min.
0.2 ml of chloroform were added to the samples which
were thereafter gently turned by hand for 15 s followed by
a 2 min incubation at room temperature. The samples
were then centrifugated at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C
and the upper obtained liquid phase was transferred to
new tubes. The precipitation of the RNA was performed
by adding 0.25 ml isopropanol and 0.25 ml of salt solution (0.8 M Sodium citrate and 1.2 M NaCl) followed by
incubation at room temperature for 10 min. The RNA was
then collected by centrifugation 15,000 × g for 10 min at
4°C and washed with 75% ethanol before treatment with
DNase I (GE Healthcare) in 20 μl Dnase buffer (40 mM
Tris-HCl, 6 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5) for 30 min at 37°C. A
phenol: chloroform extraction was performed and the
RNA was precipitated in 2.5 volume of ice-cold ethanol
(99.5%) and 0.2 volume of cold LiCl (10 M). After precipitation at -20°C over night the samples were centrifuged
at 20,000 × g, washed and resuspended in DEPC-treated
distilled H2O.
Identification of transcriptional start points (TSP)
TSP studies were performed using RNA from N2-fixing
cultures and the "5'RACE System for Rapid Amplification
of cDNA Ends" kit (Invitrogen) according to manual.
Resulting bands were cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/53

tor (Invitrogen) and transformed into DH5α competent
cells, all according to instructions from the manufacturer.
The obtained vectors were purified by the "Genelute Plasmid Mini-prep Kit" (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by sequencing (Macrogen Inc).
In the case of hoxW in Nostoc PCC 7120, the primers used
for the reactions were modified and designed according to
the TAG-method [66] and only the first of the two nested
PCRs described in the "5'RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends" kit manual was performed (Table
1).
Transcriptional studies
cDNA for transcriptional studies by RT-PCR were produced from RNA from N2-fixing and non N2-fixing cultures by using the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Fermentas) containing RevertAid™ H Minus M-MuLV
Reverse Transcriptase and RiboLock™ Ribonuclease Inhibitor according to the instructions. The following PCRs
were done using TAQ polymeras (Fermentas) according to
manufacturers instructions and visualized on a 1% agaros
gel.

The probe used for Northern blot was produced by PCR
amplification with appropriate primers (Table 1) and
purified with the GFX, PCR, DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare). 7 μg of total RNA from N2-fixing
and non N2-fixing cultures of Nostoc PCC 7120 and Nostoc
punctiforme was separated by electrophoresis in denaturing agarose gels and blotted to Hybond-N+ (GE Healthcare) according to instruction using the, in the instruction
described, modified Church and Gilbert buffer. Labelling
of the probes was done using the Rediprime II Random
prime labelling system (GE Healthcare) and removing of
unincorporated 32P dCTP was thereafter performed by
using Probe Quant G-50 microcolumns (GE Healthcare).
The equal loading of the RNA was analyzed by the relative
amount of rnpB transcripts. The positioning of the bands
was visualized using a Pharos FX™ plus Molecular Imager
(Bio-Rad) and analyzed with the accompanying software.
All primers used in this study were designed using the
online primer program Primer3 [67,68] (Table 1).
Protein and nucleotide sequence analysis and construction
of phylogenetic tree
All strains and proteins, together with their GenBank
accession number, used in this study are shown in Table
2[69-87]. Protein sequences used for the phylogenetic tree
were retrieved from the NCBI database [88]. All alignments were performed in BioEdit version 7.0.4.1 [89]
using ClustalW multiple alignment and the resulting
alignment were corrected manually. For the construction
of the unrooted phylogenetic tree the alignments were run

through PAUP version 4.0 beta and MrBayes 3.1 software
[90-92]. The maximum parsimony analysis (PAUP) was
performed with heuristic algorithm and random addition
of the sequences and bootstrap support values was calculated 1000 times. For the bayesian analysis MrBayes was
executed for 1 000 000 generations with a sample frequency of 100 using the WAG model. A burn-in of 2500
trees was used and the support values indicate the proportion of the 7500 remaining trees. The online program
ModelGenerator was used to determine the optimal
model (WAG) [93,94]. For graphic outputs the resulting
trees were then visualised by using Treeview [95,96].
Searches for homologues sequences of Npun_F0373 (Nostoc punctiforme), Alr1422 (Nostoc PCC 7120) and promoter regions were done by both using the NCBI and

5'RACE-polyG Hox/A

CyanoBase databases and their respective BLAST programs. Prediction of DNA secondary structure was done
by using the online program MFold [97,98]. Transmembrane regions were predicted using the online program
SOSUI [99-101].
For location studies of conserved residues on the surface
of the proteases, alignments were performed for three of
the protease groups revealed in the phylogenetic tree;
group 5 – proteases of HoxW type (HoxW from Nostoc

HybD/Shigella boydii Sb227 and HupD/Thiocapsa roseopersicina). Conserved residues shared by 100%, 90%, and
80% of the sequences were then visualised on the surface
of the 3D models on a representative from each group; the
3D models of HoxW and HupW from Nostoc PCC 7120
and on the crystallized structure of HybD from E. coli
(protein data bank accession number 1CFZ.pdb).
3D modelling and protein docking
3D models of proteases were constructed by using the
online program SWISS-MODEL [102] and with HybD
from E. coli as a template (1CFZ.pdb). The same method
were also used for the 3D models of the large subunits of
the hydrogenases, using HydB from Desulufovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F as template (protein data bank accession
number 1UBJ:L). The results were visualised in the program Swiss-PDB-viewer [103,104].

Protein-protein docking simulations were done by using
the docking program BiGGER V2 [105]. The following
constraints were set; Gln16 and His93 in the protease had
to be at a minimum distance of 8 Å from the Cys61 and
Cys546 in the hydrogenase large subunit (amino acid
numbers refers to HybD and HybC in E. coli). The docking experiments were then run as soft docking with an
angular step of 15° and a minimum contact of 300. The
residues used for constraints were chosen since they are
suggested to bind to the nickel in the active site of the
large subunit of the hydrogenase [17,62,106]. The docking simulations were done for the following combinations; HybC model – HybD (1CFZ) (E. coli), HydB
(1UBJ:L) – HynC model (Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Miyazaki F) and HoxH model – HoxW model (Nostoc PCC
7120). The best solutions were selected according to the
global score from BiGGER V2 and with regard to the possibility of nickel binding.
