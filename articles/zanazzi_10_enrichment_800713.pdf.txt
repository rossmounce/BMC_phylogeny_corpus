Enrichment and differential targeting of
complexins 3 and 4 in ribbon-containing sensory
neurons during zebrafish development
George Zanazzi1,2, Gary Matthews2*

Abstract
Background: In sensory systems with broad bandwidths, polarized receptor cells utilize highly specialized
organelles in their apical and basolateral compartments to transduce and ultimately transmit signals to the rest of
the nervous system. While progress has been made in elucidating the assembly of the transduction apparatus, the
development of synaptic ribbon-containing terminals remains poorly understood. To begin to delineate the
targeting of the exocytotic machinery specifically in ribbon-containing neurons, we have examined the expression
of complexins 3 and 4 in the zebrafish visual and acousticolateral systems during the first week of development.
Results: We have identified five members of the complexin 3/4 subfamily in zebrafish that show 50 to 75% amino
acid identity with mammalian complexins 3 and 4. Utilizing a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all five orthologs,
we demonstrate that these proteins are enriched in ribbon-containing sensory neurons. Complexin 3/4 is rapidly
targeted to presynaptic terminals in the pineal organ and retina concomitantly with RIBEYE b, a component of
ribbons. In hair cells of the inner ear and lateral line, however, complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity clusters on the
apical surfaces of hair cells, among their stereocilia, rather than along the basolateral plasma membrane with
RIBEYE b. A complexin 4a-specific antibody selectively labels the presynaptic terminals of visual system ribboncontaining neurons.
Conclusions: These results provide evidence for the concurrent transport and/or assembly of multiple components
of the active zone in developing ribbon terminals. Members of the complexin 3/4 subfamily are enriched in these
terminals in the visual system and in hair bundles of the acousticolateral system, suggesting that these proteins are
differentially targeted and may have multiple roles in ribbon-containing sensory neurons.

Background
Photosensitive and non-cutaneous mechanosensitive
neurons transduce stimuli, via specialized sensory cilia
and microvilli on their apical surfaces, into graded
membrane potentials. A rod or cone photoreceptor elaborates, from a primary cilium, vast quantities of plasma
membrane that contain opsins and the rest of the transduction machinery (reviewed in [1]). Less well-developed
outer segments are also present in pineal complex
photoreceptors in anamniotes and sauropsids (reviewed
in [2]). Developing mechanosensory hair bundles, on the
other hand, consist of a kinocilium and actin-rich

stereocilia embedded in a cuticular plate and interconnected with proteinaceous linkages (reviewed in [3,4]).
In teleosts such as zebrafish, mechanosensory hair cells
are located in sensory patches of inner ear epithelia
(maculae and cristae) and in neuromasts of the lateral
lines (reviewed in [4]). Defects in the assembly of hair
cell bundles and photoreceptor outer segments can lead
to receptor cell degeneration and sensory deficits
(reviewed in [1,3,4]).
The presynaptic terminals of receptor cells in the
visual and acousticolateral systems have an architecture
that allows them to effectively transmit information
about stimulus intensity and frequency with release
modification. Synaptic vesicle exocytosis occurs at active
zones that contain ribbons. These pleiomorphic organelles, composed primarily of a unique protein called

RIBEYE, tether a halo of releasable vesicles (reviewed in
[5,6]). Teleost genomes contain two RIBEYE genes,
RIBEYE a and RIBEYE b, that are differentially
expressed in zebrafish [7]. The importance of the ribbon
in synaptic transmission is underscored by the loss of
vision [8,9] and hearing [10] in zebrafish and mouse
mutants that lack anchored ribbons. Despite the importance of ribbons in visual, auditory, and vestibular function, the mechanisms that underlie their development,
and the rest of the exocytotic machinery, are not wellunderstood.
Ultrastructural studies of ribbon development in
photoreceptors [11,12], hair cells [13], and pinealocytes
[14] suggest that ribbons (floating, spherical, and surrounded by vesicles) are found first in the perinuclear
cytoplasm. As development proceeds, ribbons appear to
migrate basally in photoreceptor axons toward the presynaptic terminals [12]. Ribbon cytomatrix proteins,
such as RIBEYE, are found in migrating non-membranous densities, termed precursor spheres [15], which
may correspond to migrating ribbons. In the presynaptic
terminal, a ribbon attaches to the plasma membrane via
an arciform density [16] and enlarges with maturation,
likely due to multiple RIBEYE homophilic and heterophilic interactions [17]. Besides ribbons, several groups
have examined the accumulation of synaptic vesicle proteins in the developing rodent retina, revealing clustering in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and inner
plexiform layer (IPL) before synapse maturation [18-21].
Since the examined synaptic vesicle proteins are found
at both conventional and ribbon synapses, the targeting
of ribbon terminal-specific synaptic vesicle proteins is
poorly understood.
Although the molecular architectures of ribbon and
conventional terminals are similar, specific isoforms of
synaptic vesicle proteins have been identified at some
ribbon synapses (reviewed in [5,6]). For example, adult
mammalian retinal ribbon synapses selectively express
the complexin 3/4 subfamily [22,23]. The mammalian
complexins are a family of small, hydrophilic proteins
encoded by four genes that can be grouped into two
subfamilies based upon sequence identity and expression
patterns [23-26]. Complexins 1 and 2 share approximately 80% amino acid identity and are enriched at conventional synapses [24-26], where they appear to activate
and stabilize the SNARE complex in a fusion-ready state
before calcium enters the terminal and binds to synaptotagmin (reviewed in [27]). Mammalian complexins 3
and 4 are homologous to each other (approximately
60% amino acid identity), but not to the complexin 1/2
subfamily (approximately 25% amino acid identity).
Mammalian complexin 3 localizes primarily to rod bipolar cell and cone photoreceptor terminals, while mammalian complexin 4 is expressed in cone bipolar cell

and rod photoreceptor terminals [23]. In confirmation
of their importance in retinal ribbon synaptic transmission, mice with targeted disruptions of the complexin 3
and 4 genes exhibit vision deficits and disorganized
photoreceptor terminals containing floating ribbons [28].
In this study, we characterize zebrafish complexin 3/4
orthologs and their expression in sensory ribbon-containing neurons during embryonic and early larval zebrafish development. By searching the ENSEMBL and
GenBank databases, we identified and subsequently
cloned five zebrafish orthologs that show 50 to 75%
amino acid identity with mammalian complexins 3 and
4. Phylogenetic analysis reveals two complexin 3 orthologs and three complexin 4 orthologs. Utilizing a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all five zebrafish
orthologs, we demonstrate that these proteins are
rapidly and predominantly targeted to the lateral border
of the pineal organ and to the OPL and IPL in the
embryonic zebrafish retina. Complexin 3/4 overlaps with
zpr 1/FRet 43 in terminals of double cone photoreceptors in the OPL and pineal, and with protein kinase C
in ON bipolar cell terminals in the IPL. Hair cells of the
acousticolateral system display complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity among their stereocilia rather than in their
basolateral domains containing RIBEYE b. While complexin 4a marks visual system ribbon terminals, it is not
found in hair cells, suggesting a system-specific subdivision of cellular functions.

Results
Cloning, phylogenetic, and syntenic analyses of zebrafish
complexin 3 and 4 orthologs

By searching the zebrafish ENSEMBL and GenBank
sequence databases, we identified five zebrafish orthologs of mammalian complexins 3 and 4. The full-length
coding sequences of each zebrafish ortholog were then
amplified by PCR from retina cDNA. Translation of the
putative open reading frames within the amplified PCR
products predicted proteins that range, with one exception, from 155 to 159 amino acids in length (Figure 1A).
The five zebrafish orthologs show approximately 50 to
75% amino acid identity with human and mouse complexins 3 and 4. Alignment of these proteins reveals
striking amino acid identity adjacent to, and within, the
putative core alpha helices (RDAQFTQRKAERATLRSHFRDKY in mouse complexin 3) that may mediate binding to SNARE complexes [23]. Members of the
complexin 3/4 subfamily share two motifs not present
in the complexin 1/2 subfamily: a prenylation motif
(CAAX) at the carboxy terminus that is important for
membrane targeting [23]; and a putative bipartite
nuclear localization signal (RKAERATLRSHFRDKYRL
in mouse complexin 3) that almost completely overlaps
with the putative SNARE-binding core alpha helix.

Figure 1 The zebrafish genome contains two complexin 3
orthologs and three complexin 4 orthologs. (A) The deduced
amino acid sequences of mouse, human, and zebrafish complexins
3 and 4 are aligned with ClustalW. The shaded regions highlight
evolutionarily conserved amino acids. Complexins 3 and 4 are
highly homologous to each other (50 to 75% amino acid identity),
but not to the complexin 1/2 subfamily (approximately 25% amino
acid identity). Members of the complexin 3/4 subfamily share two
motifs not present in the complexin 1/2 subfamily - a carboxy
terminus prenylation motif (CAAX) and a putative bipartite nuclear
localization signal (KKAERATVRSHFREKYRL in zebrafish complexin 3a).
The GenBank accession numbers are: zf cplx 3a, [GenBank:
GU174497]; zf cplx 3b, [GenBank:GU174498]; zf cplx 4a, [GenBank:

[GenBank:NP_663468]. (B) An unrooted phylogram of vertebrate
complexin 3 and 4 proteins was constructed with the neighbor
joining method, and bootstrap values were calculated from 2,000
trials. Branch length is proportional to evolutionary divergence.
Zebrafish complexins 3a and 3b segregate closely with mammalian
complexin 3, and zebrafish complexins 4a and 4b segregate closely
with mammalian complexin 4. A fifth paralog is designated
zebrafish complexin 4c given its relatively closer distance to
mammalian complexin 4 isoforms. Cplx, complexin; hu, human; mo,

Taken together, the sequence identity and conserved
structural features suggest a novel vertebrate subfamily
consisting of complexin 3 and 4 isoforms.
To confirm that the zebrafish clones are orthologs of
mammalian complexins 3 and 4, we analyzed their phylogenetic and syntenic relationships. The aligned amino acid
sequences of zebrafish, human, and mouse complexin 3
and 4 orthologs were used to construct a phylogenetic tree
(Figure 1B). While two zebrafish orthologs cluster with
mammalian complexin 3, three zebrafish orthologs resemble mammalian complexin 4. The percent identity
between the zebrafish complexin 3a protein and either the
mouse or human complexin 3 is 63%, while the percent
identity between zebrafish complexin 3b and either mouse
or human complexin 3 is 67 to 68%. Zebrafish complexins
4a and 4b share more identity with mammalian complexin
4 (66 to 73%) than complexin 3 (53 to 57%). Zebrafish
complexin 4c is the most divergent member of this subfamily, sharing 50% identity with either mouse or human
complexin 3 and 57% identity with either mouse or
human complexin 4. The five zebrafish orthologs of mammalian complexins 3 and 4 indicate the presence of several
complexin (cplx) gene duplication events in the evolutionary history of this teleost.
The gene structure for vertebrate cplx 3/4 subfamily
members appears highly conserved, with three exons
separated by two introns (Figure 2A). The second exon,
which contains the sequence that encodes the putative
core helix of the SNARE-binding domain, has an invariant length of 88 nucleotides in all examined cplx 3/4
orthologs. This strict preservation of exon size throughout evolution underscores an important functional role
for this module. Furthermore, these results suggest that
cplx 3 and cplx 4 resulted from the duplication of a
common ancestor.
In potential support of this hypothesis, synteny analysis reveals conserved relationships between genes surrounding mammalian cplx 3 and cplx 4 and some of
their zebrafish orthologs. For example, the lectin mannose-binding 1 (LMAN1)/ER Golgi intermediate compartment 53-kD (ERGIC-53) and retina and anterior
neural fold homeobox (RAX) genes surround cplx 4 on
human and mouse chromosome 18 (Figure 2B). Similarly, cplx 4a on zebrafish chromosome 21 is surrounded by orthologs of LMAN1/ERGIC-53 and RAX. A
gene in the LMAN1/ERGIC-53 family, called LMAN1L/
ERGIC-53L, and the CSK tyrosine kinase are situated 5â²
to cplx 3 on human chromosome 15 and mouse chromosome 9. A c-src kinase (CSK) ortholog is present 5â²
to cplx 3a on zebrafish chromosome 25, but an
LMAN1L/ERGIC-53L ortholog has not yet been detected
in the zebrafish genome. The presence of LMAN1/
ERGIC-53 or LMAN1L/ERGIC-53L immediately 5â² to all
examined mammalian cplx 3/4 genes, as well as

zebrafish cplx 4a, suggests an ancestral unit composed
of an LMAN/LMAN1-L family member and a cplx 3/4.
Based on these phylogenetic and syntenic relationships,
as well as conservation of gene and protein architecture,
we conclude that zebrafish contain five orthologs of the
complexin 3/4 subfamily.

some zebrafish cplx 3 and 4 orthologs are shown. Exons are
denoted by yellow boxes, while introns are indicated with
connecting lines. The lengths of the exons and introns are drawn to

is highly conserved, with three exons interrupted by two introns.
The length of the second exon, which encodes part of the putative
SNARE-binding domain, is exactly 88 nucleotides in all species
examined. (B) Syntenic relationships of zebrafish, human, and
mouse cplx 3/4 orthologs are shown. The genomic architectures of
mammalian cplx 3 orthologs and mammalian cplx 4 orthologs are
conserved. Human and mouse cplx 3 are preceded by CSK and
LMAN1L/ERGIC-53L, while human and mouse cplx 4 are bounded by
LMAN1/ERGIC-53 and RAX. Zebrafish cplx 3a, which has been
mapped to chromosome 25, is preceded by a zebrafish ortholog of
CSK. Zebrafish cplx 4a is bordered by LMAN and RX3, which is the

Previous studies have revealed that complexins 3 and 4
are expressed in the adult mammalian retina, primarily
in ribbon presynaptic terminals [23,28]. A polyclonal
antibody raised against mouse complexin 3 labeled cone
photoreceptor and rod bipolar cell terminals, while a
polyclonal antibody directed against mouse complexin 4
labeled rod photoreceptor and cone bipolar cell terminals [23]. To determine whether these antibodies recognize the zebrafish complexin 3/4 orthologs, we
transfected HEK 293T cells (which do not endogenously
express complexins 3 or 4; data not shown) with individual myc-tagged, full-length complexins and performed
immunocytochemistry with the polyclonal antibodies. In
parallel, we visualized expression of the fusion proteins
with a monoclonal anti-myc antibody. Additional file 1
contains micrographs of representative cells transfected
with complexin 3a (Additional file 1 A,B), complexin 3b
(Additional file 1C,D), complexin 4a (Additional file 1E,
F), complexin 4b (Additional file 1G,H), and complexin
4c (Additional file 1I,J) and stained with the polyclonal
antibody raised against mouse complexin 3 (Synaptic
Systems antibody 122302) (Additional file 1A,C,E,G,I)
and the anti-myc monoclonal (Additional file 1B,D,F,H,
J). These results demonstrate that this polyclonal antibody recognizes all five zebrafish orthologs at a dilution
of 1:10,000 (the dilution used in [23] to stain mouse
retina), and are quantified in Additional file 1K. HEK
293T cells transfected with the expression vector did
not exhibit any immunoreactivity when incubated with
the complexin polyclonal antibody (data not shown).
This antibody detects predominantly a 20 kDa band on
western blots of adult mouse and zebrafish retina,
together with a smaller band as expected for complexin
4b, indicating that the mouse complexin antibody recognizes proteins of the predicted molecular weight (Additional file 2).
The pan-complexin 3/4 antibody was then used to
examine the expression of this subfamily in the larval
zebrafish nervous system. Sensory systems develop
rapidly in zebrafish such that visual and acousticolateral
responses can be robustly elicited by five days post-fertilization (dpf) [29,30]. Therefore, 5-dpf larval sections
were stained with the pan-complexin 3/4 antibody and
the zpr 1/FRet 43 monoclonal antibody, which is a marker for double cone photoreceptors in zebrafish [31]. As

Zanazzi and Matthews Neural Development 2010, 5:24

in adult mammals [23], complexin 3/4 is most highly
expressed in the retina in larval zebrafish (Figure 3A).
Striking complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity can be
observed throughout the retinal OPL and IPL, but not
in the outer nuclear layer, inner nuclear layer, or ganglion cell layer (Figure 3A). Complexin 3/4 co-localizes
with zpr 1/FRet 43 in terminals of double cone photoreceptors, but is not restricted to these terminals in the
OPL (Figure 3B). In the IPL, complexin 3/4 appears in
both sublamina a and sublamina b, overlapping in the
latter with protein kinase C in ON bipolar cell terminals
[32] (Figure 3C).
Besides the retina, the pineal complex is photosensitive in sauropsids and anamniotes (reviewed in [2]). In
the zebrafish pineal organ, ribbon-containing photoreceptors send short axons ventrolaterally to terminate on

Figure 3 Predilection of complexin 3/4 for ribbon presynaptic
terminals in the larval zebrafish visual system. (A) A confocal
projection of a 5-dpf zebrafish transverse section stained with the
pan-complexin 3/4 antibody (green) and the zpr 1/FRet 43 antibody
(red), which labels double cone photoreceptors, reveals complexin
3/4 immunoreactivity throughout the retinal plexiform layers (OPL,
IPL) and in the pineal organ (pin). Complexin 3/4 is absent from the
retinal nuclear layers and the medial region of the pineal organ,
which contains photoreceptor somata. (B) A high-magnification
confocal projection of double cone photoreceptors (red) in the
retinal OPL labeled with the complexin 3/4 antibody (green) shows
that some of the complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity in the larval
zebrafish OPL is found in double cone terminals. (C) Doublelabeling with anti-protein kinase C (red) reveals overlap of
complexin 3/4 (green) in ON bipolar cell terminals in the retinal IPL.
(D) A confocal projection of a transverse section through the pineal
organ reveals zpr 1/FRet 43-positive photoreceptors (red) and
complexin 3/4 (green) in processes and terminals at the lateral
border. Sections incubated with secondary antibodies alone exhibit
background immunofluorescence in the retina and pineal (data not
shown). Scale bars: 125 Î¼m (A); 10 Î¼m (B, D); 5 Î¼m (C).

projection neurons [33,34]. Complexin 3/4 concentrates
in zpr 1/FRet 43-positive processes and terminals at the
lateral border of the pineal organ (Figure 3D). Additional complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity can be observed
in zpr 1/FRet 43-negative processes in the pineal neuropil (Figure 3D), which is a plexus that contains processes from several types of photoreceptors (reviewed in
[2]). Taken together, these results indicate that complexin 3/4 delineates many ribbon-containing sensory
neurons in the larval zebrafish photoreceptive organs.
Concomitant targeting of complexin 3/4 and RIBEYE b to
photoreceptor terminals during zebrafish embryogenesis

To begin to characterize the targeting of the exocytotic
machinery to ribbon terminals, we examined the spatiotemporal expression profiles of complexin 3/4 and
RIBEYE b relative to zpr 1/FRet 43 during photoreceptor development. In teleosts, photoreceptors differentiate
in the pineal organ before differentiating in the retina.
In zebrafish, most pineal progenitors exit the cell cycle
between 18 and 20.5 hours post-fertilization (hpf) [35].
Therefore, embryonic zebrafish were fixed at several
developmental time points starting at 1 dpf. No complexin 3/4 or zpr 1/FRet 43 immunoreactivity was
apparent in the pineal organ at 1 dpf (data not shown).
At 1.2 dpf, small numbers of zpr 1/FRet 43-positive
photoreceptors with short axons can be observed (Figure 4A, red). Very low levels of complexin 3/4 are found
in zpr 1/FRet 43-positive pineal photoreceptors, and the
immunoreactivity localizes to the developing neuropil
(Figure 4A, green, arrows). To examine the targeting of
other components of the exocytotic machinery, we utilized a polyclonal antibody directed against RIBEYE b
[36]. At 1.2 dpf, RIBEYE b is also found at very low
levels in zpr 1/FRet 43-positive pineal photoreceptor
terminals (Figure 4B, arrow). By 1.5 dpf, the neuropil at
the lateral border of the pineal has become well-developed, with processes emanating from dorsomedial zpr
1/FRet 43-positive and zpr 1/FRet 43-negative photoreceptor somata. Complexin 3/4 expression has been
upregulated in processes and terminals, some of which
co-localizes with zpr 1/FRet 43 (Figure 4C). Prominent
RIBEYE b puncta are found in photoreceptor axons and
their terminals (Figure 4D).
We next examined complexin 3/4 expression in the
developing retina. At 2 dpf, zebrafish photoreceptors are
exiting the cell cycle [37], and small numbers of zpr 1/
FRet 43-positive photoreceptors can be observed in the
retinal ventronasal patch at 50 hpf [38]. At 2 dpf, we
did not observe zpr 1/FRet 43 in the retina (data not
shown). By 2.5 dpf, zpr 1/FRet 43-positive photoreceptors are found in the ventronasal patch, where they
express complexin 3/4 (Figure 5A) and RIBEYE b (Figure 5B) in their terminals. By 3 dpf, complexin 3/4

(Figure 6A, arrowheads). Complexin 3/4 also localizes to
stereociliary bundles in hair cells of the anterior, lateral
and posterior cristae (data not shown). At higher magnification, it becomes evident that complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity concentrates at the base of the stereociliary
bundle (Figure 6B). Double-labeling with anti-zn 1, a
monoclonal antibody that recognizes a cytoplasmic antigen found in subpopulations of hair cells [40,41], confirms that complexin 3/4 localizes to the apical surface
of the hair cell (Figure 6C). Substantial accumulation of
complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity was also observed on
the apical surfaces of hair cells in the neuromasts of the
cranial (Figure 6D) and trunk lateral lines (data not
shown). In summary, these results indicate that members of the complexin 3/4 subfamily are enriched in
many sensory neurons that contain ribbons. Furthermore, complexin 3/4 isoforms localize to distinct subcellular domains in different sensory systems.
Figure 4 Complexin 3/4 concentrates in pineal photoreceptor
terminals concomitant with RIBEYE b. (A) A high-magnification
confocal projection of zpr 1/FRet 43-positive pineal double cone
photoreceptors (red) double-stained for complexin 3/4 (green) at 1.2
dpf shows low levels of complexin in photoreceptor terminals
(arrows). Ventral is toward the top and lateral is toward the right.
(B) A section from a different embryo at 1.2 dpf double-stained
with anti-zpr 1/FRet 43 (red) and anti-RIBEYE b (green) shows three
small RIBEYE puncta in a pineal photoreceptor terminal (arrow). (C)
By 1.5 dpf, complexin 3/4 (green) is highly expressed in neuropil at
the lateral border of the pineal organ, in both zpr 1/FRet 43-positive
(red) and zpr 1/FRet 43-negative photoreceptor axons and terminals.
(D) Several RIBEYE b puncta (green) are present in pineal
photoreceptor axons and terminals at 1.5 dpf. Scale bar = 5 Î¼m.

(Figure 5C, green) and RIBEYE b (Figure 5D, green)
have become concentrated in photoreceptor terminals
throughout the retina. In some terminals, RIBEYE b has
clustered into curvilinear structures (Figure 5D, inset)
that most likely correspond to ribbons [39]. Taken
together, these results suggest that complexin 3/4 and
RIBEYE b appear concomitantly in retinal and pineal
photoreceptors and are rapidly targeted to their axons
and terminals.
Complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity on the apical surfaces of
inner ear and lateral line hair cells in larval zebrafish

To determine whether members of the complexin 3/4
subfamily are also expressed in sensory hair cells, we
compared the distribution of complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity with that of fluorophore-tagged phalloidin,
which labels actin-rich stereociliary bundles. In the larval zebrafish inner ear, striking complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity appears among the stereociliary bundles, but
not in the basolateral domains, of macular hair cells

Figure 5 Complexin 3/4 concentrates in retinal photoreceptor
terminals concomitant with RIBEYE b. (A) The zpr 1/FRet 43
monoclonal antibody (red) and the pan-complexin 3/4 polyclonal
(green) were also used to localize these complexins in developing
retinal photoreceptors. At 2.5 dpf, retinal photoreceptors are most
prominent in the ventronasal patch, where complexin 3/4
immunoreactivity appears in some photoreceptor terminals. (B)
RIBEYE b (green) has also started to cluster in photoreceptor
terminals (red) in the outer plexiform layer at 2.5 dpf. (C) At 3 dpf,
complexin 3/4 (red) is highly expressed in zpr 1/FRet 43-positive
(red) and zpr 1/FRet 43-negative photoreceptor terminals in the
ventronasal patch. (D) Pleiomorphic RIBEYE b (green) expression is
found at 3 dpf in zpr 1/FRet 43-positive (red) and zpr 1/FRet 43negative photoreceptor terminals in the ventronasal patch. The
inset shows a zpr 1/FRet 43-positive terminal containing curvilinear
RIBEYE b immunoreactivity that may correspond to a ribbon. Scale
bar = 5 Î¼m.

apical surfaces of neuromast hair cells. Neuromast and inner ear

background immunofluorescence (data not shown). Scale bars: 25

Rapid clustering of complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity on
the apical surfaces of inner ear and lateral line hair cells
in embryonic zebrafish

Hair cells in the zebrafish inner ear [42,43] and lateral
lines [44] differentiate rapidly, with formation of stereocilia soon after exit from the cell cycle. The first hair
cells to differentiate, called tether cells, exist in two
pairs that project stereocilia and kinocilia into the otic
vesicle by 1 dpf [42,43]. We have observed putative
tether cells with complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity solely
among their stereocilia at 1 dpf (data not shown). At 1.5
dpf, few hair cells in the anterior and posterior maculae
have stereocilia, but those that do typically have complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity primarily on their apical
surfaces (Figure 7A, red, arrowheads) and RIBEYE b
puncta on their basolateral surfaces (Figure 7B, red).
The latter finding is consistent with a recent report

showing RIBEYE b at the base of inner ear hair cells at
27 hpf [45]. By 2 dpf, several macular hair cells have
acquired actin-rich stereocilia with complexin 3/4
(Figure 7C, arrowheads) and have upregulated RIBEYE b
(Figure 7D, red).
In the zebrafish lateral lines, the otic neuromast differentiates first at 34 hpf [46]. At 1.5 dpf, phalloidin labels
otic neuromast hair cell stereocilia with faint complexin
3/4 immunoreactivity (Figure 8A, arrowheads). By this
time, RIBEYE b has already concentrated in large puncta
at the base, and in smaller cytoplasmic puncta, in a couple of hair cells in the neuromast (Figure 8B, red). By 2
dpf, complexin 3/4 (Figure 8C, red, arrowheads) and
RIBEYE b (Figure 8D, red) have been upregulated in
more hair cells in the otic neuromast. Ultrastructural
evidence of mature ribbons in zebrafish neuromast hair
cells at 2 dpf has previously been reported [44]. Taken
together, these results suggest that complexin 3/4 and
RIBEYE b immunoreactivities are targeted rapidly to different compartments in zebrafish inner ear and lateral
line hair cells.

complexin 4 labels small terminals, suggestive of rod
spherules, in a wide band in the OPL and small terminals
in a thin band of the IPL (Additional file 4B). Furthermore,
the polyclonal antibody directed against mouse complexin
3 labels large cone pedicles in the OPL and many terminals of the IPL (Additional file 4A, and see [23]).
Staining of larval zebrafish sections with the complexin 4a antibody and anti-zpr 1/FRet 43 reveals abundant expression of complexin 4a in the retinal plexiform
layers and lateral borders of the pineal organ (Figure
9A). Complexin 4a appears to be more restricted to the
presynaptic terminals of retinal double cone (Figure 9B)
and pineal photoreceptors (Figure 9D) when compared
to pan-complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity in these cell
types (Figure 3B,D). In the retinal IPL, complexin 4a is
detectable in sublamina a and in protein kinase C-positive presynaptic terminals in sublamina b (Figure 9C).

Complexin 4a specifically marks visual system ribbon
presynaptic terminals

To determine the immunoreactivity profile for the polyclonal antibody directed against mouse complexin 4 [23],
we performed the immunofluorescence assay with the
transfected HEK 293T cells that express individual complexin 3/4 isoforms. As can be seen in Additional file 3,
the complexin 4 polyclonal antibody (Synaptic Systems
antibody 122402; when used at a dilution of 1:75,000) preferentially recognizes zebrafish complexin 4a. Additional
file 3B,D,F,H,J show representative HEK 293T cells transfected with myc-tagged, full-length complexins 3a, 3b, 4a,
4b, and 4c, respectively, and labeled with the anti-myc
monoclonal antibody. Additional file 3A,C,E,G,I contain
the same cells incubated with the complexin 4 polyclonal
antibody. The myc-tagged complexin 4a cell line (Additional file 3E,F) exhibits strong immunoreactivity with the
complexin 4 antibody (Additional file 3E). These results
are quantified in Additional file 3K and demonstrate that
the polyclonal antibody directed against mouse complexin
4 is relatively selective for complexin 4a in zebrafish.
We have confirmed the findings of [23] that, in rodent
retina, the polyclonal antibody directed against mouse

antibodies alone exhibit background immunofluorescence in the
retina and pineal (data not shown). Scale bars: 125 Î¼m (A); 10 Î¼m

isoforms of the complexin 3/4 subfamily distinct from
complexin 4a.
To confirm the specificity of this antibody for complexin 4a in zebrafish, a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide directed against the translation start site of
complexin 4a was injected into embryos (Figure 11).

Figure 10 Complexin 4a is not expressed in hair cells of the
larval zebrafish acousticolateral system. (A) A low-magnification
confocal micrograph of a transverse section through the otic vesicle
of a 5-dpf zebrafish shows saccular macula (sm) inner ear hair cell

(red, arrowheads). (B) A high-magnification en face view of inner
ear hair cells labeled with phalloidin (green) confirms the absence
of complexin 4a (red) among their stereocilia. (C) Inner ear hair cells
incubated with anti-zn 1 (red) lack complexin 4a (green). (D) A
high-magnification confocal planar projection through a cranial
neuromast labeled with AM1-43 (green) indicates that complexin 4a
is also absent from these hair cells. Sections incubated with only
secondary antibodies exhibit very low levels of diffuse
immunofluorescence throughout the hair cells (data not shown).
Scale bars: 25 Î¼m (A); 5 Î¼m (B-D).

In contrast to the pan complexin 3/4 antibody, the
complexin 4a antibody does not label hair cells in the
inner ear or lateral line (Figure 10). Figure 10A shows
a confocal planar projection of a larval zebrafish inner
ear probed with phalloidin (green), to identify hair
cells, and with the complexin 4a polyclonal antibody
(red). Hair cells of the inner ear do not contain complexin 4a immunoreactivity (Figure 10A, arrowheads).
Higher magnification of individual hair cells and their
stereocilia confirms the absence of complexin 4a
(Figure 10B). Inner ear sensory patches defined by the
zn1 monoclonal antibody also lack complexin 4a
(Figure 10C). Hair cells in neuromasts of the cranial
(Figure 10D) and trunk (data not shown) lateral lines
also lack complexin 4a. Taken together, these results
indicate that complexin 4a is differentially expressed
in ribbon-containing sensory neurons with a predilection for presynaptic terminals in the zebrafish visual
system. In addition, hair cells contain one or more

oligonucleotide knocks down complexin 4a protein expression
in the larval zebrafish retina and pineal organ. (A-H) 4.3-dpf
control (A, C, E, G) and complexin 4a morpholino-injected (B, D, F,

expression in the pineal organ (B) and in the retinal outer plexiform
layer (OPL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) (F). Some complexin 3/4
immunoreactivity remains in the pineal (D) and retina (H). Scale
bars: 15 Î¼m (A-D); 30 Î¼m (E-H).

Complexin 4a immunoreactivity is absent from the
pineal organ of complexin 4a morphants at 1.5 dpf (data
not shown). At approximately 4.3 dpf, complexin 4a
immunoreactivity in the complexin 4a morphant pineal
organ is still dramatically reduced (Figure 11B) compared to controls (Figure 11A). Other members of the
complexin 3/4 subfamily are expressed in morphant
pineal (Figure 11D), although there appears to be less
expression of complexin 3/4 compared to control pineal
organ (Figure 11C). Complexin 4a expression is also
robustly decreased in both the OPL and IPL of the
complexin 4a morphant retina at 4.3 dpf (Figure 11F).
Complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity is most apparent in
the complexin 4a morphant IPL, especially in large
terminals in sublamina b (Figure 11H). Taken together,
these results suggest that complexin 4a is a major
complexin 3/4 isoform in visual system, but not acousticolateral system, ribbon terminals.

Discussion
In this study, we isolated five zebrafish orthologs in the
complexin 3/4 subfamily with several evolutionarily
conserved features, and examined their expression with
previously generated polyclonal antibodies [23]. Characterization of complexin 3/4 expression in the developing zebrafish nervous system reveals that members
of this subfamily are enriched in ribbon-containing
sensory neurons. In zebrafish, as in rodents, complexin
3/4 localizes to retinal ribbon presynaptic terminals.
We confirm that zebrafish hair cells lack complexin 3/
4 in their basolateral domains, and implicate complexin 3/4 as a component of their apical stereocilia.
Taken together, these findings suggest that members
of the complexin 3/4 subfamily may have multiple
roles in ribbon-containing sensory neurons as discussed below.
Characterization of zebrafish orthologs defines the
complexin 3/4 subfamily in vertebrates

Many mammalian genes have two zebrafish orthologs
due to an apparent genome duplication event in rayfinned fish [47,48]. Phylogenetic analysis of the complexin 3/4 subfamily reveals the presence of two complexin 3 orthologs and three complexin 4 orthologs in
zebrafish. While zebrafish complexins 3a and 3b share
85% amino acid identity, zebrafish complexins 4a and
4b share 76% amino acid identity. Since the fifth zebrafish ortholog has higher amino acid identity with zebrafish complexin 4 paralogs (57 to 59%) compared with
zebrafish complexin 3 paralogs (50 to 53%), we have
named this divergent isoform complexin 4c. Potential
medaka (ENSORLP00000022544) and Xenopus

Page 10 of 16

(ENSXETP00000014005) orthologs with high homology
to zebrafish complexin 4c are located in the ENSEMBL
database, which provides evidence for several cplx gene
duplication events in the evolutionary history of teleosts
and amphibians.
Vertebrate complexins 3 and 4 exhibit several conserved proteomic and genomic features that differentiate
this subfamily from complexins 1 and 2. For example, a
motif that defines vertebrate complexins 3 and 4 is the
carboxy-terminal CAAX moiety (where C = cysteine, A
= aliphatic, X = serine, threonine, or cysteine), which
can undergo post-translational modifications that lead
to the addition of a prenyl anchor and reversible attachment to membranes [23]. Targeting to membranes has
important functional consequences for complexin 4
[23], and may also be accomplished through myristoylation since nearly all vertebrate complexins 3 and 4 (but
not vertebrate complexins 1 and 2) have multiple myristoylation motifs (data not shown).
All vertebrate full-length members of the complexin
3/4 subfamily are encoded by three exons, including an
invariant exon containing 88 nucleotides that encodes
part of the putative core alpha helix that binds to an
assembled SNARE complex [23]. Highest amino acid
homology between vertebrate complexins occurs within
this core alpha helix. Complexin 1 binding is thought to
stabilize the SNARE complex [49] in a fusion-ready
state, preventing completion of fusion via an accessory
alpha-helix [50-52] until calcium enters the presynaptic
terminal and binds to synaptotagmin 1 [53-55]. Complexin 3/4 subfamily members share substantial amino
acid identity in the accessory alpha-helix (56 to 100%
when comparing mouse, human and zebrafish orthologs), but this sequence is not conserved with complexin 1/2 subfamily members (approximately 25%).
The amino terminus of complexin 1 has been shown to
be necessary for exocytosis [50], but this region also
diverges with complexin 3/4 subfamily members
(approximately 25% amino acid identity). The functional
consequences of these differences remain to be
determined.
Complexin 3/4 double knockout mice exhibit reduced
b-wave amplitudes and increased implicit times on electroretinograms. Disorganized cytomatrix components
and floating ribbons in photoreceptor terminals suggest
a presynaptic etiology for the defect in synaptic transmission in these mice [28]. Complexins 3 and 4 can rescue the defect in fast, calcium-triggered transmitter
release in hippocampal neurons from complexin 1/2
double knockout mice [23]. However, the precise steps
regulated by complexins 3 and 4 in neurotransmitter
release at ribbon synapses remain unclear.

Targeting of complexin 3/4 to different compartments of
ribbon-containing sensory neurons

Few proteins involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis are
known to be selectively expressed in ribbon presynaptic
terminals (reviewed in [5,6]). Therefore, the identification of ribbon-specific isoforms of these synaptic regulators is of special interest. We have extended a previous
study describing expression of complexin 3/4 in retinal
ribbon terminals [23] by showing that members of this
subfamily are also enriched in photosensitive ribbon
terminals of the zebrafish pineal organ. Knockdown of
complexin 4a reveals that this isoform predominates in
ribbon terminals of the zebrafish pineal and retina.
Taken together, these results indicate that complexin 3/
4 isoforms, such as complexin 4a in zebrafish, are markers for several types of visual system ribbon terminals.
Furthermore, we show that complexin 3/4 and
another member of the exocytotic machinery, RIBEYE
b, appear to be targeted concomitantly to photoreceptor
terminals during zebrafish embryonic development.
Since RIBEYE b is not expressed in bipolar cells [7], we
were unable to analyze the time course of complexin 3/
4 accumulation in bipolar cell terminals relative to a ribbon marker. However, it was observed that complexin
3/4 appeared to be targeted directly to bipolar cell terminals very rapidly after its clustering in retinal photoreceptor terminals (data not shown). Live imaging of
fluorescently tagged components of the exocytotic
machinery, expressed under the control of retinal bipolar cell [56,57] or other ribbon-containing neuron promoters [58], may shed additional light on the
mechanisms and signals that regulate their targeting.
While complexin 3/4 localizes to the axons and presynaptic terminals of ribbon-containing sensory neurons
in the zebrafish visual system, members of this subfamily are absent from the corresponding basolateral
domains of hair cells in the zebrafish auditory, vestibular, and lateral line systems. Rather, complexin 3/4
immunoreactivity appears on the apical surfaces of these
hair cells. The area around the hair cell cuticular plate
contains large quantities of vesicles that traffic between
the cytoplasm and plasma membrane [59]. Co-localization with the binding of phalloidin to F-actin above the
cuticular plate suggests that complexin 3/4 is a component of stereocilia rather than vesicles near the apical
plasma membrane. Immunoelectron microscopy will be
necessary to determine the precise localization of zebrafish complexin 3/4 in the stereocilia.
During the course of this study, Strenzke et al. [60]
utilized RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry with the
two anti-complexin rabbit polyclonal antibodies to conclude that complexin 3/4 is not expressed in rodent
inner ear hair cells. Our preliminary experiments confirm that complexin 3 is not expressed in hair cells of

Page 11 of 16

the adult mouse utricle (data not shown). Additional
experiments are needed to examine the expression of
complexin 3/4 during rodent hair cell development. In
addition, since we focused in the embryonic zebrafish
on the targeting of complexin 3/4 immunoreactivity in
macular and otic neuromast hair cells, it will be useful
to determine the spatiotemporal distribution profiles of
complexin 3/4 in other hair cells of the inner ear and
lateral line during embryonic development.

Conclusions
Sensory receptor cells of the visual and acousticolateral
systems are polarized into anatomically and physiologically distinct apical and basolateral compartments. Here
we show that, in developing zebrafish, members of the
complexin 3/4 subfamily are enriched and rapidly targeted to distinct compartments in these cells in a system-specific manner. These findings suggest that the
functional and structural organization of ribbon-containing sensory receptor cells results from multiple direct
targeting mechanisms during development.
Materials and methods
Zebrafish husbandry and tissue processing

All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the State University of
New York at Stony Brook. Wild-type zebrafish (Danio
rerio) obtained from a local pet store [61] were propagated by natural matings and maintained on a controlled cycle of 13 hours of light and 11 hours of
darkness at 28.5Â°C in system water [62]. Onset of fertilization was approximately 9:30 AM (30 minutes after
lights were turned on). Embryos and larvae were staged
as previously described [63].
Before overnight fixation at 4Â°C with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA,
USA), zebrafish embryos and larvae were anesthetized
with 0.168 mg/ml tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA). For immunocytochemistry, fixed embryos
and larvae were washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose until
equilibrated, embedded in M-1 matrix (Shandon Lipshaw, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and frozen at -80Â°C. Tissue
was sectioned at 20 to 30 Î¼m with a Leica CM1850
cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL, USA)
with a chamber temperature of -20Â°C to -22Â°C and then
stored at either -20Â°C or -80Â°C.
For isolation of zebrafish retinal RNA from freshly dissected eyes, adult zebrafish were decapitated, enucleated,
and the lens and vitreous were extracted in cold, oxygenated, low-calcium solution containing (in mM): NaCl
(102), KCl (2.5), MgCl2 (1), CaCl 2 (0.5), glucose (10),
and HEPES (10), pH 7.4. The retinae were removed
from the eyecups, separated from retinal pigment

epithelium, and incubated for 25 minutes in 500 units/
ml hyaluronidase (Worthington Biochemical Corp.,
Lakewood, NJ, USA) at room temperature to remove
residual vitreous. Retinae were rapidly frozen on dry ice,
and poly(A) + RNA was obtained with the Micro Poly A
+ Pure kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Mouse husbandry and tissue processing

Adult C57BL/6 mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY, USA) were
euthanized by CO2 inhalation, decapitated, and brains
were removed for access to the inner ears. The utricles
were isolated in PBS, fixed for 2 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4Â°C, washed extensively in PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight. Adult mice were
also enucleated, retinae were removed from the eyecups,
separated from retinal pigment epithelium, and either
placed in cold SDS sample buffer or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4Â°C. Retinae were cryoprotected
in 30% sucrose overnight, embedded in M-1 matrix and
sectioned as described for zebrafish.
Cloning and sequence analyses

The nucleotide sequences of mouse complexin 3 [GenBank:AY264290], human complexin 3 [GenBank:
AY286501], mouse complexin 4 [GenBank:AY264291],
and human complexin 4 [GenBank:AY286502] [23] were
used in BLAST searches of the zebrafish genome in the
ENSEMBL and GenBank databases. Five putative orthologs were identified in the zebrafish ENSEMBL database
(Zv7) - ENSDARG00000062508, ENSDARG00000067
826, ENSDARG00000059978, ENSDARG00000059486,
and ENSDARG00000069963. To determine whether
these genes are expressed in zebrafish, the following primers (which were expected to span multiple introns)
were designed: (ENSDARG00000062508 forward) 5â²CGCGACTAACGTTAGGAATT-3â²; (ENSDARG0000
0062508 reverse) 5â²-AAAATCACCTCTGATCCTTG-3â²;
(ENSDARG00000067826 forward) 5â²-GAGGAGATGAATCTACATCAC-3â²;

(ENSDARG00000069963 forward) 5â²-CAGTGTTACCTGTGCAGCTC-3â²; (ENSDARG00000069963
reverse) 5â²-CTCTCACATTAGCTGCACTCC-3â².
Reverse transcription of adult zebrafish retina poly(A)
+ RNA was carried out with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was performed with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen), 1 Î¼l of reverse-transcribed cDNA (or non-

Page 12 of 16

reverse transcription control), and 10 pmol of primers.
The PCR protocol consisted of 95Â°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 95Â°C, 45Â°C, and 72Â°C for 1 minute
each, ending with 72Â°C for 4 minutes. PCR products of
approximate expected sizes, obtained with all five primer
pairs, were gel-purified, subcloned in pGEM-T Easy, and
sequenced. Comparison of these cDNA clones with the
aforementioned annotated genes in the zebrafish
ENSEMBL database via BLAST revealed >95% nucleotide
identity
for
four
of
the
genes
(ENSDARG00000067826 was the exception).
Alignment of the cDNA clones and the aforementioned mammalian complexins 3 and 4 was performed
with ClustalW in Molecular Biology Workbench [64].
Based on this multiple alignment, an unrooted phylogenetic tree was generated via the neighbor joining
method and visualized with TreeView [65]. Bootstrap
values supporting each node were calculated from 2,000
trials. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the cDNA clone
most similar to ENSDARG00000062508 was named cplx
3a, ENSDARG00000067826 was named cplx 3b,
ENSDARG00000059978 was named cplx 4a, ENSDARG
00000059486 was named cplx 4b, and ENSDARG000000
69963 was named cplx 4c. The sequences of the isolated
cDNA clones have been deposited in GenBank: [GenBank:GU174497, GU174498, GU174499, GU174500, and
GU174501] for zebrafish complexins 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, and
4c, respectively.
In silico analysis of the following genes was performed
based on sequence in the ENSEMBL database (Zv8):
human cplx 3 (ENSG00000213578), human cplx 4
(ENSG00000166569), mouse cplx 3 (ENSMUSG000000
39714), mouse cplx 4 (ENSMUSG00000024519), zebrafish cplx 3a (ENSDARG00000062508), and zebrafish
cplx 4a (ENSDARG00000059978). Proteomic analysis of
the cplx3/4 subfamily was performed in Molecular Biology Workbench with the PROSEARCH and PFSCAN
algorithms.
Construction and expression of myc-tagged complexins

Complexins 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, and 4c were each fused inframe with the myc tag from pCMV-Tag3b using the
In-Fusion Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit (Clontech Labs,
Mountain View, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We used 50 pmol of the following
primers to amplify 100 ng full-length complexins for

HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbeccoâs Modified
Eagleâs Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Labs, Logan, UT,
USA) and glutamine (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37Â°C. Cells on
100 mm dishes were transfected with Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen) and 8 Î¼g of a complexin-myc construct or
pCMV-Tag3b. After 24 hours, the cells were trypsinized,
plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips, and
maintained for an additional 24 hours before processing
for immunocytochemistry.
Immunocytochemistry

HEK 293T cells were washed with PBS for 5 minutes,
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room
temperature, washed with PBS, permeabilized and
blocked with PBS plus 0.3% Triton X-100 plus 6% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove,
PA, USA) at room temperature for 2 hours. The coverslips were then incubated overnight at room

temperature with mouse monoclonal anti-myc (Zymed
Laboratories, San Francisco, CA, USA) and either rabbit
polyclonal anti-complexin 3 or rabbit polyclonal anticomplexin 4 (Synaptic Systems, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany)
diluted in the blocking solution. In parallel, coverslips
from each cell line were incubated solely with anti-myc,
anti-complexin 3, anti-complexin 4, or the blocking
solution. All of the coverslips were then washed three
times with blocking solution and incubated for 1 hour
at room temperature with affinity-purified, Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor
546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:200 in the blocking solution.
Finally, the coverslips were washed three times in PBS,
once in distilled water, and mounted in Vectashield
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Sections and wholemounts were washed with PBS and
blocked for 2 hours at room temperature as described
for the HEK293T cells. Primary antibodies (Table 1)
were added to fresh blocking solution, and slides were
incubated overnight at room temperature. For labeling
of actin, Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Invitrogen) was
diluted 1:50 and incubated overnight with primary antibodies. After three washes, species-specific secondary
antibodies were added for 1 hour at room temperature.
Sections and wholemounts were washed three times
with PBS, rinsed with water, and coverslipped in
Vectashield.
For labeling of neuromasts, live zebrafish larvae were
bathed in 3.0 Î¼M AM1-43 in embryo medium for 30 to
45 seconds [66]. After several washes in embryo

medium. larvae were anesthetized with tricaine, fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours at room temperature, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight as
described earlier. Larvae were sectioned sagittally at 30
Î¼m, dried at room temperature, washed with PBS, and
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 hour 15
minutes. Sections were then blocked for 2 hours with
PBS plus 6% normal goat serum, and incubated overnight with primary antibodies in the blocking solution.
Slides were processed the next day as described above,
except for the use of affinity-purified, Alexa Fluor 546conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), to detect complexins.
Data acquisition and image analysis

Images were acquired with either a FluoView 300 laser
scanning confocal microscope running Olympus FluoView 5.0 or an Olympus FluoView FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope running Olympus10-ASW
software (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA, USA).
For the Olympus FluoView FV300 confocal, images
were collected with an Olympus UPlan-Apochromat 60
Ã NA 1.20 objective or a Zeiss Fluar 10 Ã NA 0.5 objective. For the Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal,
images were collected with an Olympus Plan-Apochromat 60 Ã NA 1.42 objective or an Olympus UPlan-S
Apochromat 10 Ã NA 0.4 objective.
For all double-labeling experiments, sequential scans
were taken to reduce crosstalk. For most experiments, a
series of confocal optical sections (with a step size of 0.5
to 2.0 Î¼m) was taken through the entire tissue section
and a planar projection was generated. Images were
passed through a median filter, and exported to ImageJ64
(NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and Photoshop CS3 (Adobe
Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA), where levels were
increased to reflect the original captures in FluoView.
To quantify the zebrafish complexin 3/4 reactivity
profiles of the rabbit polyclonal anti-complexin 3 and
anti-complexin 4 antibodies, 50 random fields of transfected HEK 293T cells were photographed from a representative of triplicate experiments for each cell line. All
images were taken within the dynamic range of the
photomultiplier, and identical gain and offset settings
were used when imaging complexin (and myc) antibody
immunoreactivity between cell lines. For each field, confocal z-stacks were taken through the entire cell with a
step size of 2 Î¼m, and the middle three optical sections
were chosen to make a z-projection for each cell. These
projections were encircled in ImageJ, and the mean
pixel intensities were measured for both channels. Background fluorescence, which was obtained by measuring
the mean pixel intensity for both channels in a region
outside of a cell, was subtracted from the pixel intensity
measurements. To compare the immunoreactivity of a

Page 14 of 16

complexin antibody directly, we calculated mean fluorescence ratios for each complexin paralog by dividing
the corrected mean complexin antibody fluorescence
intensity by the corrected mean myc fluorescence intensity. Studentâs t-tests were performed with Microsoft
Excel 2008, with P < 0.05 considered to be statistically
significant.
Western blots

Total protein extracts were prepared from freshly isolated adult mouse and zebrafish retinae. Zebrafish
extract was made in hypotonic lysis buffer (with protease inhibitors) and loaded at 200 Î¼g, while mouse
extract was loaded at 100 Î¼g in SDS-sample buffer (with
protease inhibitors). Proteins were size-fractionated by
15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blot was probed with rabbit polyclonal anticomplexin 3 antibody (1:1,000) in tris-buffered saline
tween-20 (TBST) plus 2.5% milk overnight, followed by
DyLight 800 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Rockland
Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA). Fluorescence
was detected with the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).
Morpholinos

To knock down complexin 4a protein expression, 5 ng
of an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide complementary to the translation start site of the complexin 4a
gene (5â²-AAACGCCATTATTTACCACGCCGGA-3â²;
Gene Tools, Philomath, OR, USA) was pressure-injected
in a volume of 0.5 nl into one-cell-stage, dechorionated
zebrafish embryos. A control morpholino oligonucleotide (5 ng/0.5 nl) directed against human beta-globin
(Gene Tools) was used as a negative control. Morpholino solutions were diluted to a final concentration of 10
ng/nl with 0.2 M KCl and 2 mg/ml phenol red. An
additional negative control condition consisted of
dechorionated zebrafish embryos that were not injected.
All zebrafish embryos were then raised at 25.5Â°C in
embryo medium (0.346 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate supplemented with Hanks Solution #1, Hanks Solution #2,
Hanks Solution #4, Hanks Solution #5, and penicillinstreptomycin (Invitrogen)).

Additional material
Additional file 1: Identification of a pan-immunoreactive polyclonal
antibody that recognizes zebrafish complexins 3 and 4.(A-J) HEK
293T cells were transfected with myc-tagged, full-length zebrafish
complexin 3a (A, B), 3b (C, D), 4a (E, F), 4b (G, H), or 4c (I, J). After 48
hours, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and double-stained
with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against mammalian complexin
3 (Synaptic Systems antibody 122302) (A, C, E, G, I) and a mouse
monoclonal anti-myc antibody (B, D, F, H, J). This experiment was done
in triplicate with a complexin antibody dilution of 1:10,000, and 50
random cells from one experiment were randomly selected for

quantification. The mean green fluorescence intensity for each cell was
divided by the mean red fluorescence intensity. (K) The mean
fluorescence ratios and SEM for each cell line are shown, revealing that
this antibody recognizes all five isoforms. Scale bar = 25 Î¼m.
Additional file 2: The complexin 3/4 antibody predominantly
recognizes an approximately 20 kDa band on western blots.Adult
mouse and zebrafish retinae were lysed in sample buffer containing
protease inhibitors. Mouse extract (100 Î¼g) and zebrafish extract (200 Î¼g)
were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (15% gel), blotted onto nitrocellulose,
and probed with the complexin 3/4 polyclonal antibody (1:1,000). An
approximately 20 kDa band is apparent in both mouse and zebrafish
lysates. A minor band of approximately 17 kDa can also be observed in
the zebrafish extract.
Additional file 3: Identification of a polyclonal antibody that
preferentially recognizes zebrafish complexin 4a. (A-J) HEK 293T cells
were transfected with myc-tagged, full-length zebrafish complexin 3a (A,
B), 3b (C, D), 4a (E, F), 4b (G, H), or 4c (I, J). These transiently transfected
cells were stained with the mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibody (B, D,
F, H, J) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against mammalian
complexin 4 (Synaptic Systems antibody 122402) (A, C, E, G, I). (E, F)
Complexin and myc immunoreactivity, respectively, in a representative
cell transfected with zf cplx4a-myc. This experiment was done in
triplicate with a complexin antibody dilution of 1:10,000, and 50 random
cells from one experiment were randomly selected for quantification. The
mean green fluorescence intensity for each cell was divided by the
mean red fluorescence intensity. (K) This antibody preferentially
recognizes zebrafish complexin 4a (unpaired Studentâs t-test, P < 0.0001).
Scale bar = 25 Î¼m.
Additional file 4: Complementary expression of complexin 3 and
complexin 4 in adult mouse retina. Adult mouse retinal sections were
labeled with anti-carboxy-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP 2, red) and
either anti-complexin 3 (A, green) or anti-complexin 4 (B, green). Since
CtBP 2 and RIBEYE are transcribed from the same gene [67], anti-CtBP 2
can be used to label synaptic ribbons. A low-magnification confocal
projection through a retinal section stained with anti-complexin 3 and
anti-CtBP 2 (A) reveals complexin 3 expression in large, putative cone
pedicles of the OPL and throughout most of the IPL, especially in the
large, putative bipolar cell terminals in sublamina b. (B) Complexin 4 is
found throughout the OPL in small terminals, which may be rod
spherules, and in a thin band in the IPL that lacks complexin 3. Scale bar
= 50 Î¼m.
