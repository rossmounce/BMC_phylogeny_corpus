Abstract
Background: Major population movements, social structure, and caste endogamy have influenced
the genetic structure of Indian populations. An understanding of these influences is increasingly
important as gene mapping and case-control studies are initiated in South Indian populations.
Results: We report new data on 155 individuals from four Tamil caste populations of South India
and perform comparative analyses with caste populations from the neighboring state of Andhra
Pradesh. Genetic differentiation among Tamil castes is low (RST = 0.96% for 45 autosomal short
tandem repeat (STR) markers), reflecting a largely common origin. Nonetheless, caste- and
continent-specific patterns are evident. For 32 lineage-defining Y-chromosome SNPs, Tamil castes
show higher affinity to Europeans than to eastern Asians, and genetic distance estimates to the
Europeans are ordered by caste rank. For 32 lineage-defining mitochondrial SNPs and
hypervariable sequence (HVS) 1, Tamil castes have higher affinity to eastern Asians than to
Europeans. For 45 autosomal STRs, upper and middle rank castes show higher affinity to Europeans
than do lower rank castes from either Tamil Nadu or Andhra Pradesh. Local between-caste
variation (Tamil Nadu RST = 0.96%, Andhra Pradesh RST = 0.77%) exceeds the estimate of variation
between these geographically separated groups (RST = 0.12%). Low, but statistically significant,
correlations between caste rank distance and genetic distance are demonstrated for Tamil castes
using Y-chromosome, mtDNA, and autosomal data.
Conclusion: Genetic data from Y-chromosome, mtDNA, and autosomal STRs are in accord with
historical accounts of northwest to southeast population movements in India. The influence of
ancient and historical population movements and caste social structure can be detected and
replicated in South Indian caste populations from two different geographic regions.

Background
The origins and genetic affinities of India's populations
have been debated extensively [1-6]. Archaeological studies document human occupation of the subcontinent
from the lower Paleolithic through the Neolithic, including a flourishing ancient civilization in the Indus Valley
[7]. The historical record documents an influx of Vedic
Indo-European-speaking immigrants into northwest
India starting at least 3500 years ago [8-11]. These immigrants spread southward and eastward into an existing
agrarian society dominated by Dravidian speakers [12].
With time, a more highly-structured patriarchal caste system developed [7,9,10]. India is now broadly characterized by Indo-European (e.g. Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi)
speaking populations found in the central and northern
regions and by Dravidian (e.g. Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada) speaking populations in the southern and southeastern regions. The extent to which ancient and
contemporary migrations, and the more recent inception
of a hierarchical caste system, have influenced the genetic
composition of modern Indian populations remains controversial.
A number of studies have addressed the genetic contribution of other Eurasian populations to Indian caste and
tribal populations [1-3,6,13-18]. They have arrived at
somewhat different conclusions regarding the origins of
castes, their relationships to each other, and their relationship to populations outside India. These discordances can
be attributed, in part, to differences in sampling strategies
and the varied effects of gene flow between the typically
endogamous castes and tribes [14,19-21].
Several trends regarding the origin and affinities of Indian
populations have emerged. The predominantly south and
east Asian mtDNA haplogroup M is found in more than
half of individuals from a wide sampling of castes
[5,6,13,22] and is nearly fixed in some Austro-Asiatic
tribal populations [6]. This haplogroup is uncommon in
western European populations [23,24]. In contrast, some
paternally-inherited Y-chromosome lineages are more
closely related to lineages originating in central Asians
and Europeans [1,13,25,26]. Genetic distances estimated
from autosomal polymorphisms have typically demonstrated that caste populations tend to occupy a position
intermediate between European and East Asian populations [8,27-29].
The genetic affinities among the more than 2000 extant
caste populations of India, however, are complex. Genetic
distances between caste populations from the state of
Andhra Pradesh, India, are correlated with differences in
caste rank, suggesting that endogamy and differential
inter-caste gene flow influences genetic structure [30]. Several studies have found a similar pattern, [31-33] but oth-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/86

ers have not [6,34]. Higher rank castes may show closer
affinity to European populations than do other caste populations [13]. Recent Y-chromosome data suggest a higher
affinity between tribal populations and castes of lower
rank [35].
These results support historical accounts of nomadic pastoralists from central and northwestern Eurasia integrating with existing local populations, and either introducing
a system of social stratification or becoming members of
the existing upper castes [8,9,35]. Yet, the occurrence of Ychromosome haplogroups L, H, R2, and R1a in both caste
and isolated tribal populations suggests much of the existing Indian population structure is very old [5]. Additionally, the high diversity of Y haplogroups R1a1 and R2 in
both South Indian and Indus valley populations has led
to the suggestion that there is little, if any, genetic influence from other Eurasians on the castes of South India [3].
A broad study of 24 castes from various locations throughout India concluded that genetic data were not congruent
with "sociocultural" affinities due to high rates of gene
flow [6]. Yet, this study and others [1,36] have suggested
a clinal (north to south) contribution of central Asian Ychromosomal lineages to caste populations. Due to wellestablished clines in gene frequencies across India, especially in the north-south direction, [2,34,36] comparisons
of castes from different geographic locations can conflate
clinal variation with variation that may exist between
local caste groups. Therefore, it is important to obtain
large, carefully chosen samples from the same geographic
locale to determine whether previous results [13] indicating caste-related genetic structure can be replicated in
other regions of India [37]. Additionally, because single
linkage groups such as the non-recombining region of the
Y-chromosome or the mtDNA genome may be strongly
influenced by genetic drift or selection, the use of a large
number of independent autosomal polymorphisms can
greatly improve the reliability of estimates of population
relationships.
In this study we analyze four castes of different rank sampled from Tamil Nadu, the southern-most state of the
Indian subcontinent. The genetic relationship among the
Tamil castes, their relationship to castes from the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh, and their affinity to other
Eurasian populations are examined using Y-chromosome,
mtDNA, and autosomal polymorphisms. We show that
the genetic affinities between Indian castes from Tamil
Nadu and other Eurasians are broadly congruent with patterns observed previously for castes from Andhra Pradesh.
These results strengthen the conclusions drawn from our
previous analyses regarding caste relationships in South
India and suggest reproducible patterns regarding the

genetic influence of ancient and historical events on the
Indian caste system.

Results
Y-chromosome haplogroups
We evaluated the genetic relationship between Tamil
castes, eastern Asians, and Europeans using 32 lineagespecific Y-chromosome SNPs. The sampling locations for
the Tamil castes and a comparative set of castes from the
neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh are shown in Figure
1. Y-haplogroups F*, H1, J2/J2a, L1, R1a1, and R2 reach
appreciable frequencies (> 5%) in most castes. Common
Y-haplogroups are typically shared among castes (Tables 1
and 2). Haplogroup R (predominantly R1a1 (27%) and
R2 (11%)) is the most common major lineage in the
Tamil castes, followed by H (21%, predominantly H1), L
(13%, predominantly L1), J (11%, predominantly J2),
and F* (10%).

Some between-caste trends are suggested by the data. The
F* lineage is found at higher frequencies in lower castes
than in upper or middle castes. The R1a1 lineage occurs at
a higher frequency in upper vs. lower castes and differed
significantly in frequency in Andhra upper vs. Andhra
lower (p < 0.05). These trends appear in castes from both
Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Lineage H also reaches
substantial frequency in the Tamil lower caste but is less
common in upper and middle castes. Lineage J2, previously shown to be distributed in a northwest to southeast
gradient, [3] was present in all castes but not correlated
with caste rank.

mtDNA haplogroups
Tamil castes are characterized by high frequencies of mitochondrial M and N super-family lineages, and all South
Indian lineages could be assigned to either M or N clades
(Tables 3 and 4). Both major haplogroup super-families
are deep-rooting in South Indian populations, with diversity estimates for N (0.01589, n = 63) exceeding that for
M (0.01044, n = 92), based on HVS1 data. In contrast to
the South Indian mtDNA haplogroup pool, the eastern
Asian and European groups have predominantly either M
or N lineages, respectively. High diversity and deep-coalescence dates (> 40 K ybp) for both major mtDNA superfamilies are consistent with an ancient and continuous
presence of populations in South India that greatly predates the documented history of the caste system.

To further examine potential western and central Eurasian
contributions to South Indian castes, mitochondrial U
lineages, defined by coding variant 12308G, were analyzed in greater detail (Table 5). U haplogroup subtypes
were assigned using key HVS1 variants as previously
described [4,38]. South Asian lineages U2a and U2c are
common in Tamil and Andhra castes. U7 is the most prevalent U lineage in Tamil and Andhra castes. U7 is also
common in Iran, Pakistan, and northern India, [39] suggesting an affinity between Dravidian populations from
South India and populations to the north and west. A
comparison of HVS1 for U7 haplogroups (10) with
Indian/Pakistani HVS1 sequences available in the mtDB
database (4) revealed similar but non-identical motifs,
suggesting ancient rather than very recent gene flow
between northwestern and southern India. A notable

between-caste difference is observed for the mtDNA haplogroup U data in that the Tamil lower caste sample has a
lower frequency of U haplogroups (all subclades) than
Tamil upper castes (0.317 vs. 0.059, p < 0.05) or middle
castes. This trend is also present in the Andhra sample, but
it is not significant.
Genetic distances
We calculated genetic distances between Tamil castes,
Europeans, and East Asians and compared these results to
those from upper, middle, and lower caste groups from
the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh. The genetic distance estimates reveal several distinct patterns (Table 6).

For Y-chromosome polymorphisms, all castes have
smaller distances to Europeans than to eastern Asians. For
mtDNA polymorphisms, all castes have smaller distance
estimates to eastern Asians than to Europeans. For Y-chromosome data, the genetic distance estimates to the Europeans is ordered by caste rank. These trends appear in
castes from both geographic regions.
A neighbor-joining network depicts the between-population relationships based on Y-chromosome data (Figure
2). The NTS Upper caste is more closely related to the
Andhra Upper caste than to the other Tamil castes, a finding consistent with a common language (Telugu) shared
by the NTS Upper and Andhra upper castes. All castes are
closer to Europeans than to eastern Asians, and basal haplogroup R is common, especially in the upper castes and

Europeans. The inset, however, shows that haplogroups
derived from R are not commonly shared between this
sample of Europeans and southern Indians. Affinity
between the groups is driven largely by basal characters
(R, F* and H) that have contrasting frequency patterns.
A neighbor-joining network based on distance estimates
from 45 STRs shows a greater affinity of all castes to Europeans than to eastern Asians (Figure 3). With the exception of the NTS Upper (Telugu and Kannada speaking)
Brahmins, castes of similar rank from different geographic
locations tend to branch at similar locations within the
network. Within each geographic region, the distances to
other Eurasians (both Europeans and East Asians)
increases with decreasing caste rank.
The network based on mitochondrial distance estimates
shows little between-caste rank organization, yet reveals
the greater affinity of all castes to eastern Asians for maternal lineages (Figure 4). Basal U haplogroups are less frequent in lower rank castes from both southern India
locations. The inset shows that only a few high-resolution
U haplogroups (U5, K) are shared between Europeans
and South Indians.
Genetic structure
The proportion of genetic variation distributed within and
between South Indian castes was assessed by an analysis
of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Table 7). The Tamil
South Indian castes are only modestly differentiated from

(Lineages are grouped by M or N super-family; *could not be further resolved)

one another: 0.96% of STR variance occurs between Tamil
castes. A similar value of 0.77% for between-population
(caste) difference is observed in the Andhra castes. A
smaller fraction, 0.12%, is attributable to geographic differences between Tamil and Andhra locations and was not
significantly different from zero. Removal of the NTS
Upper caste from the comparison yielded a non-significant but higher value of 0.28%. These findings, based on
multiple unlinked loci, suggest that social structure has
had a larger impact on caste population structure in these
South Indian samples than geographic separation.
Y-chromosome and mtDNA estimates of molecular variance between castes samples from either Tamil Nadu or
Andhra Pradesh also exceed the estimate for betweengroup variation for the two geographic regions. Betweencaste variation for mtDNA in Tamil populations is greater
than that for Andhra populations. This may be partly due
to regionally high female mobility in Andhra castes as previously reported [20,30]. As expected, for all genetic systems, the vast majority of all variation occurs within
populations.
The degree of population subdivision among Indian
castes was estimated using a model-based clustering

method implemented in STRUCTURE (ver. 2.1). The best
estimate of the number of clusters (K) was consistently
one for the Tamil Indians. The best estimate of the K clusters was also one for Tamil and Andhra castes together.
This result indicates that individuals from castes spanning
the Indian social hierarchy from two independent geographic regions are not sufficiently differentiated to allow
clustering into groups based on genetic data from 45 STR
polymorphisms alone. This finding is consistent with the
low RST values for these populations but may also reflect
the limited power of 45 STRs to distinguish such closely
related populations. Estimates for heterozygosity and
repeat variance in these populations also indicate no substantial between-caste differences or excess homozygosity
in these caste groups (Table 8).
We evaluated the correlation between caste rank and
genetic distance using a Mantel test (Table 9). For each
test, a correlation between pairwise genetic and pairwise
caste rank distances matrices using the Tamil caste individuals was calculated. For Tamil-speaking populations,
all genetic systems produced low, significant positive correlations. Y-chromosome haplogroup data yielded the
highest positive correlation with caste rank (Ï = 0.26, p <

Discussion
Using a geographically well-defined sample of caste populations from Tamil Nadu, India, this study arrives at
many conclusions similar to those from our previous

studies of caste populations from Andhra Pradesh, India
[13,20,30]. In both cases, there is extensive sharing of Y
and mtDNA haplogroups among castes, and the overall
level of inter-caste differentiation is low. This finding is
consistent with many other studies of genetic structure
and gene flow patterns among caste populations
[6,32,33,40].

Paternally-inherited Y-chromosome SNPs show that caste
populations have greater affinity to a sample of Europeans
than to a sample of eastern Asians. Unlike the Y-chromosome data, maternally-inherited mtDNA polymorphisms
demonstrate a contrasting pattern â castes, regardless of
rank, have higher affinity to eastern Asians than to Europeans. These patterns were present in samples from both
geographical locations suggesting that South Indian paternal lineages have been more substantially influenced by
western or central Eurasians compared to South Indian
maternal lineages. Unlike our previous study of Andhra
castes, [13] direct haplogroup sharing between Tamil
castes and our sample of Europeans is more limited, suggesting a potentially greater time depth for the development of these patterns. More extensive sampling will be
required to resolve this difference.

the caste system originated or subsequent differences in
male-female mobility patterns.

Using Y-chromosome data, Tamil castes of different rank
have differential affinities to our sample of Europeans,
with upper castes demonstrating greater affinity than
lower castes. Genetic distances are weakly correlated with
caste rank distances and correlations from Y-chromosome
data are stronger than correlations based on mtDNA or
autosomal data. This pattern argues for a differential contribution of male lineages to castes of different rank and
limited male mobility between castes in South India.

In a study of broadly distributed Indo-European and Dravidian castes, Sengupta et al. (2006) suggested that the
majority of Indian Y-chromosome haplogroups are at
least 10,000 to 15,000 years old as gauged by Y-chromosome microsatellite diversity, thus predating the origin of
the caste system. The antiquity and complex geographic
distribution of the R1a1 and R2 haplogroups led these
authors to conclude that the majority of the subcontinent
Y-chromosomes arrived in or before the early Holocene
(10,000 years ago) rather than in a later Indo-European
expansion. Likewise, and concordant with other studies of
tribal Indian populations, [5] we observe Y-chromosome
R1a1 lineages in South Indian tribal Irula (unpublished
data), a population substantially differentiated from
South Indian castes [18].

An interesting difference between the data sets from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu is also observed. For the
former sample, inter-caste distance based on mtDNA polymorphisms (HVS1 sequence) demonstrated a strong
relationship to caste rank, while distances based on Ychromosome data did not. This was interpreted as evidence of historical upward female mobility in the caste
system [30]. (We note, however, that the primary reason
for a lack of correlation between Y-chromosome distances
and caste rank was close affinity between the upper-caste
Brahmin and lower-caste Relli samples [20].) In contrast,
the Tamil Nadu samples show a higher correlation
between Y-chromosome distances and caste rank than
between mtDNA distances and caste rank. This difference
likely reflects differential apportioning of individuals as

Recently, several studies have underscored the complexity
of Y-chromosome variation in Indian populations. Sahoo
et al. (2006) presented evidence that the R1a haplogroup
has attained high frequencies and high diversity in northern India, central Asia, and eastern Europe. They also
reported high frequencies of Y-chromosome haplogroup
H in caste and tribal populations and provided compelling evidence for an origin of haplogroup H in South
India. Upon further analysis, their data show that, as in
our study, the frequency of haplogroup R lineages is
higher in Brahmins (upper rank) than in lower-rank castes
(0.53 vs. 0.41), while the frequency of H lineages is lower
in Brahmins than in lower castes (0.15 vs. 0.34).

An examination of the R and H haplogroup frequencies of
Indo-European-speaking castes reported by Sengupta et
al. (2006) shows that, as in our study, R haplogroup frequencies in upper castes exceeded those of middle and
lower castes (0.62, 0.35, and 0.38, respectively), while H
haplogroup frequencies were lowest in upper castes
(0.14), intermediate in middle castes (0.38), and most
frequent in lower castes (0.44). For Dravidian castes, R
(0.62) was more frequent than H (0.14) in upper castes

while R and H had similar (within 6%) frequencies in
middle and lower castes.
A recent analysis of caste and tribal populations from eastern India (Orissa) demonstrated Indo-European influences on paternal caste lineages [41]. Brahmins showed
high Y-chromosome affinity to eastern Europeans (M17,
haplogroup R1a1). In contrast, maternal mtDNA polymorphisms revealed primarily Indian-specific lineages.
Taken together, our studies and at least three other studies
of Y-chromosome lineages in Indian castes demonstrate
that upper castes show genetic affinity to populations
residing north and northwest of the Indian subcontinent.

This affinity appears, in part, to result from varying frequencies of Y-chromosome R lineages and older South
Asian lineages such as F* and H.
Indian mtDNA lineages demonstrate high diversity, suggesting that a majority of Indian maternal lineages are also
relatively old and likely predate historically documented
expansion events [38,42]. Older, deep-rooting mitochondrial lineages belonging to the N macrolineage are prevalent in western Eurasia and are distributed in a West â East
cline, with high frequencies in Anatolia and Iran and
moderate frequencies in Pakistan and northwestern India
[43]. In this study we observe higher frequencies of basal

While Y-chromosome and mtDNA polymorphisms yield
valuable information, it must be borne in mind that they
each represent a single linkage group. Estimates based on
these systems are thus subject to a high level of stochastic
variability [44,45]. In addition, the Y-chromosome and
mtDNA may both have been affected by natural selection,
[46,47] which can further complicate the interpretation of
population history. Coalescence dates based on these systems must also be viewed with appropriate caution, in
part because of their large confidence intervals. More
importantly, a coalescence date is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the founding date of a population [45]
because these dates are affected by the size of the founder
population and by subsequent gene flow patterns. To gain
a more complete and reliable portrait of population history, multiple, independent autosomal polymorphisms
should also be examined.

subsequent, non-uniform lineage sorting and differentiation over time. In contrast, and consistent with early

Our analysis of 45 unlinked autosomal STRs reveals that
in Tamil Nadu, genetic distances between castes are positively correlated with caste rank. A similar pattern was
detected in upper, middle, and lower rank castes of Andhra Pradesh using these STRs [20] and Alu and L1 insertion polymorphisms [13]. An analysis of the Kallar,
Vanniyar, and Pallar castes, which also reside in Tamil
Nadu, showed that upper â lower caste distance estimates
(0.0553) exceeded those for upper â middle castes
(0.0329) and middle â lower castes (0.0515) [40].
Majumder et al. [37,48] presented Y-chromosome,
mtDNA, and autosomal data from several caste populations in Uttar Pradesh. Subsequent analysis indicated that
caste rank was correlated with genetic distance for all three
types of systems [20]. Similar correlations have been
observed in a number of other studies of Indian populations [31,33,49]. A relatively greater affinity between
upper-caste populations and Europeans has been
observed for autosomal polymorphisms in our Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu samples and in a number of
other analyses of autosomal data [6,50,51].

Although significant correlations between caste-rank and
genetic distances are apparent, model-based clustering
algorithms did not detect structure within the Tamil or
Andhra populations. We suggest that this finding results
from the low amount of differentiation between all caste
groups but also from a lack of sufficient power in 45
unlinked STRs to detect high-resolution population structure. With ~250 K SNPs typed in a subset of the Andhra
upper and Andhra lower castes, individuals can be clustered into these population groups using genotype information alone [52]. Likewise, using > 950 K SNPs, the
Tamil upper and Tamil lower castes demonstrate groupspecific clustering by principal component analysis
(unpublished data).
Considering the complex history of Indian populations, it
is not surprising that some studies demonstrate an association between caste rank and genetic distance, whereas
others do not. A recent study of 15 geographically dispersed Indian populations residing in the United States
using 1200 markers found little evidence for caste or geographic structure [53]. However, sampling strategy (relocated vs. in situ) or other factors, such as a very wide
geographic dispersion of the study populations, may confound correlations if they exist. Admixture and gene flow
can also vary substantially between caste populations in
the various regions of India. Linguistic differences may
influence the genetic structure of local caste populations
[34]. The linguistically different NTS Upper caste Brahmins showed several differences in comparison to the
other Tamil castes in this analysis. Yet, because Indian
populations show only a small amount of genetic differentiation, [17,53] a large number of autosomal loci will
be necessary for adequate power to detect consistent patterns of variation if they are present [54,55]. Ancestryinformative autosomal polymorphisms, high-density
genotyping, and extensive population sampling will provide better resolution of the relationships between Indian
and other Eurasian populations.
The results presented here underscore the complexity of
the Indian caste system. Although other interpretations
may be possible, our data are consistent with a model in
which nomadic populations from northwest and central
Eurasia intercalated over millennia into an already complex, genetically diverse set of subcontinental populations. As these populations grew, mixed, and expanded, a
system of social stratification likely developed in situ,
spreading to the Indo-Gangetic plain, and then southward
over the Deccan plateau. A strong patrilineal social structure, accompanied by a developing practice of caste
endogamy, may have contributed to an asymmetric
apportioning of Y-chromosome, autosomal, and to a
lesser extent, mtDNA lineages. Remnants of these patterns
can still be detected in some of the inhabitants of peninsular South India.

Conclusion
Genetic variation between South Indian castes from Tamil
Nadu is low (RST = 0.0096). Tamil caste Y-chromosomes
and STR alleles are more similar to Europeans than to
eastern Asians, and genetic distance estimates to Europeans are ordered by caste rank. In contrast, Tamil caste
mtDNA shows greater similarity to eastern Asians than to
Europeans. Low, but statistically significant, correlations
between genetic distance and caste rank can be demonstrated for the Tamil-speaking populations. These patterns
likely reflect asymmetric influences of ancient and historical processes on the caste system as it developed. These
findings provide a general replication of our analysis of
ranked castes from the neighboring state of Andhra
Pradesh, India [13]. For the caste populations analyzed
here, between-caste genetic differentiation exceeds that
due to geographic (between-state) differentiation, a finding that may be of considerable interest when initiating
linkage mapping [56] and case-control association studies
in South Indian populations.

Methods
Study Subjects
Study subjects were recruited from four caste groups in
Tamil Nadu, India. Tamil-speaking Brahmins (41),
Mudaliars (43), and Dalits (Harijans) (34) were sampled
in Chennai or from rural locations near Chennai. Caste
rank was assigned using the traditional varna of Brahmin
(Brahmin, upper ranking), Mudaliar (Sudra, middle ranking), and Dalit (scheduled caste â outside the traditional
caste system, lower ranking). A second sampling of Brahmins (37) was obtained in Kanchipuram, located ~70 km
southwest of Chennai. The Kanchipuram Brahmin group
is linguistically diverse, containing Kannada- and Teluguspeaking Brahmins that relocated from the neighboring
states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. This group of
upper castes individuals is referred to subsequently as the
non-Tamil speaking (NTS) Upper caste. This study was
approved by the Schizophrenia Research Foundation,
Chennai, India and by the Wolston Park Hospital Ethics
Committee, Brisbane. Approvals were also obtained from
the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Indian
Ministry of Commerce. Written, informed consent was
obtained from all participants.

A comparative European sample of northern European
and French ancestry (57), and eastern Asians of Chinese,
Japanese, and S.E. Asian ancestry (28) have been previously described [28,57,58]. Because all samples were
required to have data for all genetic systems thus excluding females, sample sizes are smaller than previously
reported. The comparative sample of populations from
Andhra Pradesh, India includes upper-caste Brahmins
(33), middle-caste Kapus and Yadavas (80), and lowercaste Malas, Madigas, and Rellis (54) [13].

Data collection
DNA was extracted from venous blood using standard
procedures. Hypervariable sequence 1 (HVS1), corresponding to base pairs 16000 â 16410, was amplified by
PCR and sequenced using BigDye 3.1 dye-terminator fluorescent sequencing chemistry and an Applied Biosystems
(ABI) 3100 automated sequencer.

Pradesh castes, we typed individuals from Andhra Pradesh
for 26 of the 32 lineage-defining SNPs. A Y-haplogroup
was assigned to each sample by the presence of one or
more derived-state alleles, and the remaining alleles were
inferred. This SNP panel allowed further refinement of the
haplogroups previously reported for the Andhra Pradesh
samples [13,30].

Lineage and sub-lineage identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the mitochondria (32 markers)
and Y-chromosome (32 markers) were selected from the

Data analysis
Haplogroups for the Y-chromosome (32 SNPs) and
mtDNA (32 SNPs and 411bp HVS1 sequence) were
assigned using SNP data. Mitochondrial haplogroups
were assigned to a haplogroup based on the most probable consensus of polymorphic changes or resolved using
previously published mtDNA HVS1 motifs as a guide
[62]. Thirty-one exceptions to the canonical mtDNA phylogeny occurred on 27 mtDNA haplogroups, and these
haplogroups with recurrent mutations were assigned to
the most likely haplogroup based on HVS1 sequence data
[4,6]. The variant 7598A, defining mtDNA lineage M-E,
was found in 2 Tamil and 1 Andhra individuals who share
identical HVS1 motifs but lack the preE 4491A variant.
Between-caste haplogroup differences were evaluated for
significance using Fisher's exact test.

Mitochondrial and Y-chromosome SNPs were genotyped
by fluorescent primer extension using SNaPshot chemistry (ABI). Primers were annealed to amplification products adjacent to the polymorphic site and extended by one
nucleotide using the manufacturer's recommendations.
Extension products were pooled and resolved on a 36-cm
capillary array. Four to eight SNPs were assayed per multiplex. Forty-five STRs, predominantly tetranucleotide
repeats, were amplified using 5'-NED, -PET, -VIC, or -6FAM labeled primers using standard PCR conditions and
resolved in 5 fluorescent multiplex runs on an ABI 3100.
STR loci are UT1091, UT1201, UT1205, UT1220,
UT1227, UT1228, UT1232, UT1239, UT1243, UT1257,
UT1313, UT1352, UT1357, UT1376, UT1674, UT1708,
UT1740, UT1747, UT1880, UT1885, UT1917, UT1950,
UT1985, UT2021, UT2081, UT2092, UT2127, UT2203,
UT5022, UT5027, UT5029, UT5030, UT5033, UT5048,
UT5492, UT6507, UT6516, UT6540, UT7131, UT8067,
UT868, UT871, UT901, UT919, and vWFII. These STRs
and mtDNA polymorphisms, were typed in comparative
populations as described previously [13,18,20,57,58]. Ychromosome, STR, and mtDNA genotype data is provided
in the Additional_file 1.
To allow a direct comparison of Y-chromosome haplogroups from Tamil Nadu castes to those from Andhra

Diversity estimates (FST, RST, and AMOVA) for Y-chromosome, mtDNA, and autosomal STRs were calculated using
the ARLEQUIN 3.0 software package [65]. AMOVA statistics were evaluated for significance by comparison to an
empirical distribution generated by random permutation
of genotypes or haplogroups. A general age estimate for
mtDNA coalescent dates was calculated by the method of
Nei [66] using a substitution rate of 2 Ã 10-7 substitutions/
site/year [67].
Model-based analyses of population structure were performed using the STRUCTURE program [68]. An estimate
of the optimal number of clusters (K) for the four Tamil
castes was obtained from the posterior probabilities of K,
P(X|K), averaged over 10 runs for each value of K. A uniform prior probability distribution was assumed on K =
{1...n}, and burn-in and iterations were set to 10,000 each
for estimating the best K. Estimates of proportionate
membership to three clusters were averaged values from
10 independent STRUCTURE runs. Population admixture
and correlated allele frequencies were used in all analyses.
The correlation between genetic distance and caste rank
was assessed by Mantel matrix tests using Spearman's rank
correlation. For all possible pairs of caste individuals,
inter-individual genetic distance estimates were calculated
using DNADIST (Y and mtDNA) [69] or the Dsw program
(STRs) [70]. Next, each individual was assigned a ranking
(1, 2, or 3) for upper, middle, and lower caste status. The
difference in caste rank was calculated for all possible

pairs of caste individuals, yielding a full pair-wise matrix
(155 Ã 155, or 118 Ã 118 for Tamil-speakers only) of ordinal values (0, 1, 2). Spearman's rank correlation between
the genetic distance (Y-chromosome, mtDNA, or autosomal STRs) matrix and the caste rank difference matrix
was calculated. A significance level for the correlation was
determined by comparing the actual correlation to a distribution of correlations generated by 10,000 random
columnar permutations.
