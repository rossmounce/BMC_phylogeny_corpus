Abstract
Background: The square halophilic archaeon Haloquadratum walsbyi dominates NaCl-saturated
and MgCl2 enriched aquatic ecosystems, which imposes a serious desiccation stress, caused by the
extremely low water activity. The genome sequence was analyzed and physiological and physical
experiments were carried out in order to reveal how H. walsbyi has specialized into its narrow and
hostile ecological niche and found ways to cope with the desiccation stress.
Results: A rich repertoire of proteins involved in phosphate metabolism, phototrophic growth and
extracellular protective polymers, including the largest archaeal protein (9159 amino acids), a
homolog to eukaryotic mucins, are amongst the most outstanding features. A relatively low GC
content (47.9%), 15–20% less than in other halophilic archaea, and one of the lowest coding
densities (76.5%) known for prokaryotes might be an indication for the specialization in its unique
environment
Conclusion: Although no direct genetic indication was found that can explain how this peculiar
organism retains its square shape, the genome revealed several unique adaptive traits that allow
this organism to thrive in its specific and extreme niche.

Background
Halophilic archaea (hereafter haloarchaea) predominate
in NaCl-saturated aquatic ecosystems in which the salinity
increases up to about ten-times the average seawater concentration. Further concentration of thalassic (seawater
derived) hypersaline environments leads to the precipita-

tion of magnesium salts thereby forming the absolute
limit for life, since magnesium saturated waters (bitterns)
are devoid of active life [1]. And yet, up to this catastrophic event, haloarchaea are plentiful and reach population densities that rival the most productive natural
aquatic environments known on Earth. Out of the more

than 15 genera of haloarchaea, only one is responsible for
the booming population explosion that follows the precipitation of NaCl. Square, non-motile, pigmented
archaea dominate in most thalassic NaCl-saturated environments, reaching population densities of over 107 cells
per ml. The two unique features of these cells are the wafer
like rectangular shape and a cell thickness of not more
than 0.1 µm. Already known since the early 1980s as
Walsby's square bacterium [2], the organism resisted
attempts to isolation for the next 25 years. However, in
2004, two strains of the square archaeon were independently isolated from a Spanish [3] and an Australian solar
saltern [4]. In their specific habitat these squares are challenged by the sub-lethal conditions of an extremely high
MgCl2 concentration and high solar irradiance. The hygroscopic properties of the divalent Mg2+ ions dramatically
decrease the water activity (Aw), a measure for the availability of free water molecules for biological processes
[5,6]. The Aw is 1.0 for pure water, 0.75 for a saturated
NaCl solution and 0.3 for a saturated MgCl2 solution [7].
The actual Aw of the MgCl2 enriched brines is unknown,
but will decrease upon further concentration. Currently
an Aw of 0.6 is recognized as the lower limit for life [6].
This means that although the organism thrives in an aqueous environment it suffers severe desiccation stress. Special mechanisms are therefore required to maintain
optimal water activity within the cell and at the cell surface. Concomitant with the extremely high salinity, the
amount of dissolved oxygen decreases to near anoxia and
some essential nutrients (e.g. phosphates) become unavailable due to complexation with Mg2+. Here, we present
features from the genome of Haloquadratum walsbyi that
might explain the worldwide success of this organism in
saturated brines.

Results and discussion
H. walsbyi expresses a water enriched capsule
The secret to the success of H. walsbyi in low water activity
environments might rely in a remarkable convergence
with metazoans and more specifically with mammals.
This is provided by the most eye-catching gene in its
genome, an over 27.000 nucleotides long gene encoding
a 9.159 amino acid long protein, the largest archaeal protein known to date (Fig. 1). This giant protein, termed
halomucin (Hmu1) is similar in amino acid sequence and
domain organization (Fig. 1A) to animal mucins, which
play an important role in protecting various tissues
against desiccation (e.g. in bronchial epithelium and
eyes) or harsh chemical conditions (e.g. in epithelia along
the digestive tract) [8]. In function, mediating a specific
adaptation to desiccation stress, halomucin resembles the
mucous cocoon of lungfish that can escape dehydration
for several years outside the water. The presence of an Nterminal signal sequence suggests that this extremely large
protein is translocated across the membrane, in accord-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/169

ance with a function outside the cell. Similar to animal
mucins, halomucin contains domains that act as possible
sites of glycosylation and sulfation which may further
contribute to its overall negative charge, thereby creating
an aqueous shield covering the cells. By means of Reverse
Transcriptase PCR analysis, using primers specifically
binding to various parts of the hmu1 mRNA, we could
show that the gene is transcribed in full length (Fig. 1D).
In addition, H. walsbyi encodes two 'smaller' proteins analogues to halomucin, termed Hmu2 (2885 aa) and Hmu3
(2079 aa), and at least 14 different S-layer glycoprotein
homologs. Animal mucins may contain sialic acids which
form rigid structures, capping the end of polysaccharide
side chains of mucins. Although widespread in eukaryotes
and some prokaryotes, sialic acids were not yet detected in
archaea. H. walsbyi is probably able to synthesize sialic
acid as it contains the two essential sialic acid biosynthesis
genes neuA and neuB. Methanococcus jannaschii contains a
gene encoding NeuB but lacks NeuA [9]. In addition to
sialic acids, H. walsbyi can potentially also synthesize a
poly-gamma-glutamate capsule by means of the bacterialtype poly-gamma-glutamate biosynthesis protein complex CapBCA [10]. Besides protection against desiccation,
a cross-linked matrix of poly-gamma-glutamate may also
contribute to the rigidity and maintenance of the unique
square cell morphology of H. walsbyi.
H. walsbyi encodes two bacteriorhodopsin proteins
A consequence of the extremely high salinity is the
decreased solubility of oxygen (about 20% of the amount
of oxygen dissolved in freshwater). Low diffusion rates,
relatively high temperatures, high oxygen consumption
rates, and limited oxygenic photosynthesis leave the
NaCl-saturated brines virtually anoxic. Moreover, complexation of essential nutrients with the excessive amounts
of cations imposes an additional problem in acquiring
sufficient sources of energy, nutrients and trace elements.
Oligotrophic microorganisms are well adapted to nutrient
limitation, e.g. by increasing the surface to volume ratio
thereby optimizing the nutrient uptake capacity relative to
cell volume. Most oligotrophes achieve a high surface to
volume ratio (s/v) by reducing their cell diameter; H. walsbyi does so by extremely flattening itself [11]. This strategy
gives it what is probably the highest s/v ratio within the
microbial world. Whereas spherical shaped microorganisms have to remain small in order to retain an optimal s/
v ratio, the squares can become unlimitedly large since the
s/v ratio solely depends on their thickness which in nature
always appears to be very low (0.1 – 0.5 µm). In liquid
cultures of H. walsbyi large cells of 40–40 µm and larger
have been observed [3]. In analogy to the oligotrophes,
the high s/v ratio hints to a lifestyle in which membrane
processes are of major importance.

ATP generation (upper curve) and proton (H+) extrusion (lower curve). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Microbial Genome Analysis System package MiGenAS [38,39].

Indeed, in addition to a set of normal haloarchaeal transporters (see gene-list in the supplementary material), H.
walsbyi contains several unique ABC-type and major facilitator superfamily transporters that are not found in any
of the other haloarchaea or in archaea in general.
Amongst these are a TRAP-type C4-dicarboxylate transport system, 2 different ABC-type sulfonate transport systems and a phosphonate transport system (see below). An
important process that is stimulated by the large membrane surface is the ability of H. walsbyi to grow phototrophically as shown in Figure 2. Only at a high s/v ratio
the transmembrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, the

responsible protein for phototrophic growth, can increase
drastically in copy-number without taking away membrane space from other membrane components especially
transport proteins and without affecting cell viability.
Similar to solar panels, the ultra thin cells of H. walsbyi
collect light as alternative energy source making optimally
use of both sides of the membrane. The abundantly
present gas vesicles, which are mainly located close to the
cell periphery (Fig. 3), aid the cells to position themselves
close and parallel to the surface. The well conserved
haloarchaeal gas vesicle biosynthesis proteins are encoded
by 12 genes located on two separate gene clusters

gvpACNO and gvpFGHIJKLM. These clusters are separated
by a 3.6 kb region containing several non-functional ISelement fragments and a ParA domain protein.
Three photoactive proteins are present, two proton pumping bacteriorhodopsins and one chloride pumping halorhodopsin. As expected, this non-motile organism lacks
phototactic sensory rhodopsins as well as any flagellar or
chemotactic protein. Both proton pumping rhodopsins,
BopI and BopII, and the chloride pumping halorhodopsin contain all conserved amino acids essential for retinal binding and ion translocation. Phylogenetic analysis
shows that BopI is positioned close to the root of the phylogenetic tree and might form a missing link to the eubacterial proteorhodopsins (Fig. 2). The genes encoding BopI
and BopII are located very near to each other and close to
the origin of replication, a fact that strengthens their
importance for the biology of this organism. Interestingly,
preliminary analysis of membrane protein expression patterns shows that BopI is amongst the most abundantly
expressed membrane proteins (Fusetti and Poolman;
unpublished results). Essential in the formation of functional rhodopsins is the synthesis of its chromophore retinal. Surprisingly, H. walsbyi encodes not less than three βcarotene mono-oxygenase homologs involved in the
cleavage of beta-carotene yielding retinal [12], two of
which are closely related to cyanobacterial β-carotene
mono-oxygenases whereas the third is more similar to
homologs in plants (Fig. 4). The recently sequenced
genome of Haloarcula marismortui encodes a single β-carotene mono-oxygenase homolog on one of its plasmids
[13], whereas no homologs of the H. walsbyi enzymes
were found in the other phototrophic haloarchaea for
which the protein responsible for β-carotene cleavage still
remains to be identified.
Phosphate metabolism in H. walsbyi
In the presence of a high Mg2+ concentration especially
phosphates tend to form insoluble complexes and may
become limiting for growth. Indeed, growth under phosphate limitation is reflected in a large number of exclusive
traits found in the genome of H. walsbyi (Fig. 5). Unique
amongst the archaea is the presence of a gene cluster that
allows uptake of phosphonates and subsequent cleavage
of the stable carbon-phosphorus bond by a phosphonate
lyase. In various bacteria, phosphonate metabolism is
known to be induced under phosphate limitation [14,15].
Moreover, phosphonates are ubiquitous in nature in the
form of phosphonolipids and as side groups of polysaccharides and glycoproteins [15]. H. walsbyi also contains
an operon encoding UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase
(SqdB) plus two UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (GalE)
homologs, key-enzymes in sulfolipid biosynthesis. Sulfolipids have been found to replace phospholipids in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/169

response to phosphate limitation in a number of photosynthetic bacteria and plants [16-18].
H. walsbyi utilizes dihydroxyacetone via a
phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase
system
Exceptional among archaea is the presence of a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) dependent phosphotransferase (PTS)
system involved in the phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone (DHA). PEP-PTS systems were so far only found in
bacteria in which phosphorylation of substrates is coupled to their translocation over the membrane [19]. In
many bacteria DHA is phosphorylated by an ATP dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase (DhaK). However, some
bacteria and H. walsbyi contain a unique cytosolic PEPPTS dependent DhaK in which DHA is phosphorylated on
the expense of PEP rather than ATP to give dihydroxyacetone-phosphate (DHAP) [20]. DHA is translocated over
the membrane via facilitated diffusion, a process that is
driven by its concentration gradient. Maintenance of an
inwardly-directed DHA gradient is achieved by phosphorylation of DHA by the PTS system in the cytosol rather
than by a membrane associated PTS system. DHAP can be
used as substrate for gluconeogenesis or glycolysis. In the
glycolytic reaction DHAP is converted back to PEP resulting in the net generation of one molecule of pyruvate and
one molecule of ATP for each molecule of DHA taken up
(Fig. 5). Recent experimentation showed that H. walsbyi
can grow on DHA as carbon and energy source (data not
shown). Alternatively, DHAP is also an important intermediate in the formation of the stereoisomer sn-glycerol1-phosphate which is part of the archaea-specific backbone of membrane lipids [21]. Interestingly, dihydroxyacetone is a putative overflow product of glycerol
metabolism in Salinibacter ruber, the dominant bacterium
in crystallizer ponds [22]. Metabolism of dihydroxyacetone by H. walsbyi might explain the observed synergistic
effect on H. walsbyi colony formation when grown in association with S. ruber [3]. In addition to DHA, H. walsbyi
can grow on glycerol and pyruvate [3] but also on amino
acids [4] for which all biosynthesis pathways are completely present. Glycerol and pyruvate are probably taken
up by diffusion since specific uptake systems have not
been identified. For the amino acids a large repertoire of
amino acid uptake systems are present.
General genome properties
The Genome of H. walsbyi strain HBSQ001, DSM 16790,
comprises a 3,132,494 bp chromosome and a 46,867 bp
plasmid and contains 2738 and 39 open reading frames
(ORFS) respectively (Table 1). See [additional file 1] for a
full list of proteins encoded by H. walsbyi. The base pair
numbering of the genome was started approximately 50
nucleotides before the well conserved haloarchaeal region
containing the origin of replication and the cell division

constant over the genome with the exception of some GCrich islands that are highly enriched in transposases and
phage related genes. The GC content of these transposases
is similar to the GC content of transposases found in other
haloarchaea (54 %) suggesting that they share a common
pool of transposable elements and phages. The low GC
content of the genome is intriguing since it is generally
assumed that a high GC content is a specific adaptation of
haloarchaea to the high levels of UV irradiation in the
shallow coastal lagoons they inhabit. AT-rich genomes are
more prone to UV induced thymidine dimer formation
and possible accumulation of mutations than GC-rich
genomes. In H. walsbyi this might partly be compensated
by the large number of photolyases (4 copies). Despite the
exceptional GC content, the majority of the typical haloarchaeal proteins encoded by H. walsbyi are highly conserved at the amino acid sequence level. Also the

characteristic overall high acidity of haloarchaeal proteins
is well conserved in H. walsbyi (average pI = 5.1). As
expected, H. walsbyi differs from the other haloarchaea
mainly at the third codon position (Fig. 6). Conservation
of amino acid sequence and restriction of GC deviation to
the third codon position favor the hypothesis that H. walsbyi evolved from a 'normal' GC rich haloarchaeal ancestor
rather than by convergent evolution from a non-related
AT rich organism. A drift to an AT rich genome has been
observed especially in organisms adapted to highly specialized niches such as endosymbionts [24] and the freeliving marine microorganisms Prochlorococcus sp. [25] and
Pelagibacter ubique [26]. For two closely related species of
Prochlorococcus that differ over 20% in overall GC content
(30.8 % GC and 50.7% GC) but less than 3% at the 16S
rDNA level it was argued that an enrichment in AT is a side
effect of decreased selective pressure in a physically limited environment in which the low GC strains thrive.
Mutational bias would increase the AT content by neutral
drift. A lower GC content in the bacterial strains may be of
advantage due to the slightly decreased demand for nitrogen, since guanine requires the incorporation of one additional nitrogen atom as compared to the other
nucleotides [25,26].
Similar to these microorganisms, H. walsbyi occupies a
relatively stable but narrow ecological niche. However,
nitrogen does not appear to be limiting in its natural habitat, and so we hypothesize that another factor, namely
adaptation to the extremely high MgCl2 concentration, is
responsible for the drift to an AT rich genome in H. walsbyi. Despite the presence of energy demanding cation
efflux systems, the high external magnesium concentration will lead to an increase in the internal magnesium

concentration that is higher than in other microorganisms. Magnesium ions are known to have a stabilizing
effect on the DNA duplex, the secondary structure of RNA
(Carter and Holbrook) and DNA-RNA heteroduplexes. In
case of an already stable high-GC genome the additional
stabilizing effect of magnesium might result in DNA rigidity that interferes with essential processes like DNA replication and transcription. We propose that the drift to an
AT-rich genome might be induced as a long term evolutionary adaptation to this over-stabilization by magnesium and can be balanced by lowering the GC content of
the genome.
The genome of H. walsbyi has a low coding density
A related peculiarity of the H. walsbyi genome is its
remarkably low coding density (76%) as compared to
other haloarchaea (86–91%) and prokaryotes in general
[27]. This is due to a very large average intergenic spacing
of 289 bp mainly because of a high number of very long
(> 1000 bp) intergenic regions. These long intergenic
regions consist of non-coding DNA fragments, novel DNA
repeat elements and pseudogenes, in most cases remnants
of IS transposases. The low coding density, high number
of pseudogenes and IS elements, and the drift towards a
more AT rich genome may be signs that H. walsbyi is in a
stage where it is undergoing genome shrinkage possibly
due to its specialization into a very restrictive and specific
environment with subsequent lack of growth competition
from other species. Although saturated brines are present
around the world and already exist since ancient geologic
periods, competition with other microbes will be very
relaxed in these physically limited environments, in a way
similar to what happens with intracellular parasites or
endosymbionts. The regular desiccation of these evaporative systems might act as evolutionary bottlenecks also
favoring genome degradation [3].
Description of the plasmid
The 47 kb plasmid PL47 has a homogeneous GC distribution, is similar in GC content to the chromosome (Table
1) and contains thirty-nine open reading frames. Most
genes are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical. Of the
identified genes, the majority encode proteins involved in
plasmid maintenance, replication and restriction modification with the majority being of bacterial or viral (phage)
descent rather than of archaeal descent. Probably these
proteins are dedicated to the replication and maintenance
of the plasmid itself. However, the plasmid replication
protein RepH is not encoded on the plasmid but is located
on the main chromosome. In addition, the plasmid does
not contain a homolog of the CDC6 cell division control
protein that is commonly found on the smaller replicons
of other haloarchaea. The gene coverage (69%) of PL47 is
even lower than that of the chromosome with an average
gene distance of 371 bp.

Conclusion
In addition to its eye-catching shape, the square archaeon
H. walsbyi is in many ways unique amongst haloarchaea.
Its genome revealed a broad range of novel adaptive traits
in both genome composition and protein sequences that
may have contributed to this organism's domination in
saturated brines. Further functional studies are required to
test these assumptions. Finally, these findings provide
clues about how life is possible in the 5 M MgCl2 containing Discovery basin in the Mediterranean deep sea that
was recently shown to contain a unique microbial community [28] and possibly even in the proposed brines at
the surface of Jupiter's moons Europa and Ganymede.

Methods
Cultivation, genome sequencing and assembly
The Spanish isolate of the square halophilic archaeon
Haloquadratum walsbyi strain HBSQ001 (DSM 16790) was
grown to end exponential phase as described before [3].
H. walsbyi was sequenced with 6.5-fold sequence coverage
using a shotgun clone library (average insert size of 3 kb),
and assembled with the PHRED-PHRAP-CONSED package [29]. The sequence is of high quality (0.01 Errors/10
kb).
Gene prediction and annotation
For gene prediction, REGANOR [30] from the annotation
package GENDB [31] was used, which integrates results
from CRITICA [32] and GLIMMER [33]. The automatically predicted ORF set (3013 ORFs) was expert-curated
resulting in a theoretical proteome of 2777 proteins.
Curation involved sequence comparison to proteins from
other halophiles (Halobacterium salinarum strain R1, [34]),
Natronomonas pharaonis [35], Haloarcula marismortui [13]
and public protein sequence databases. This permitted to
identify additional small proteins and to improve the correctness of start codon assignments. tRNAs and other
RNAs were predicted using tRNAscan [36] and BLAST [37]
against other halophiles, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of proteins was performed using the Microbial
Genome Analysis System package MiGenAS [38,39] and
the MEGA3 phylogenetic tool software package [40,41].
General genome properties
The genome can be accessed via HaloLex [34]. General
features and statistics on the genome of H. walsbyi are
shown in Table S1. The main origin of replication is
located in a highly conserved region and consists of a conserved stem-loop structure, and open reading frames
encoding the conserved CDC6 cell division control protein, a signal sequence peptidase and DNA polymerase B
[42]. The sequence has been submitted to EMBL under the
accession
numbers
[EMBL:AM180088,
EMBL:AM180089] for the genome and plasmid PL47
respectively.

Extraction of total RNA and DNase I digestion
The RNA was extracted with peqGold RNAPure extraction
solution (Peqlab Biotechnology) following the manufacturers instructions. After dissolving RNA in DEPC-H2O
residual DNA was digested using the "DNA-free" kit
(Ambion) following the manufacturers instructions. The
quality of the RNA was checked using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and the RNA Nano LabChip (Agilent).
cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's
instructions with 2 µg total RNA per reaction as template
and the gene specific primers pcr4-rev and pcr7-rev,
respectively.
PCR reactions
The PCR reactions were performed using HotStarTaq
(Qiagen) (50 µl per reaction) and 0.5 µl of the cDNA samples as template. The following temperature profile was
applied on a Thermocycler T3 (Biometra): 95°C 15 min;
40× (95°C 30 sec, 60°C 30 sec, 72°C 50 sec (500 bpPCRs) or 90 sec (1 kbp-PCRs). Subsequently the PCR reactions were analyzed by standard agarose gel electrophoresis.
