Molecular signatures of halophilic prokaryotes of halophilic and non-halophilic prokaryotes identifies specific genomic and proteomic

Abstract
Background: Halophilic prokaryotes are adapted to thrive in extreme conditions of salinity.
Identification and analysis of distinct macromolecular characteristics of halophiles provide insight
into the factors responsible for their adaptation to high-salt environments. The current report
presents an extensive and systematic comparative analysis of genome and proteome composition
of halophilic and non-halophilic microorganisms, with a view to identify such macromolecular
signatures of haloadaptation.
Results: Comparative analysis of the genomes and proteomes of halophiles and non-halophiles
reveals some common trends in halophiles that transcend the boundary of phylogenetic
relationship and the genomic GC-content of the species. At the protein level, halophilic species are
characterized by low hydrophobicity, over-representation of acidic residues, especially Asp, underrepresentation of Cys, lower propensities for helix formation and higher propensities for coil
structure. At the DNA level, the dinucleotide abundance profiles of halophilic genomes bear some
common characteristics, which are quite distinct from those of non-halophiles, and hence may be
regarded as specific genomic signatures for salt-adaptation. The synonymous codon usage in
halophiles also exhibits similar patterns regardless of their long-term evolutionary history.
Conclusion: The generality of molecular signatures for environmental adaptation of extreme saltloving organisms, demonstrated in the present study, advocates the convergent evolution of
halophilic species towards specific genome and amino acid composition, irrespective of their
varying GC-bias and widely disparate taxonomic positions. The adapted features of halophiles seem
to be related to physical principles governing DNA and protein stability, in response to the extreme
environmental conditions under which they thrive.

Background

Halophiles are organisms adapted to thrive in extreme conditions of salinity. There is a wide range of halophilic microorganisms belonging to the domains Archaea and Bacteria. The
intra-cellular machinery of these prokaryotes has evolved to
function at very high salt concentrations [1-5]. A detailed
understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the
halophilic adaptation not only provides insight into the factors responsible for genomic and proteomic stability under
high salt conditions, but also has importance for potential
applications in the field of protein engineering [6,7].
The stable and unique native structure of a protein is a basic
requirement for its proper functioning [8-11]. To understand
molecular adaptation in hypersaline environments, it is
important to address fundamental problems involving protein stabilization and solubility. An apparent way to achieve
protein stability is to choose and arrange amino acid residues
in their primary sequences in a specific or selective way. Several earlier works have revealed the elevated frequencies of
negatively charged residues on protein surfaces as one of the
most prominent features of halophilic organisms [1,4,12-16].
The higher usage of negatively charged amino acid residues
leads to organization of a hydrated salt ion network at the surface of the protein [17] and formation of salt bridges with strategically positioned basic residues [18], regulating the
stability of proteins. But an increase of acidic residues on protein surfaces is not the only possible adaptation to high salinity [13,19]. Earlier works have also pointed towards relatively
low hydrophobicity as another adaptation to high salt environments [4,20]. Therefore, a clear and comprehensive picture of protein signatures for halophilic adaptation remains
elusive.
Several studies have suggested that high genomic GC-content
(well above 60%) is also a common feature of extreme halophiles, presumably to avoid UV induced thymidine dimer formation and possible accumulation of mutations [14,19]. The
newly sequenced genome of the extreme halophilic organism
Haloquadratum walsbyi is so far the only exception, with a
remarkably low genomic GC-content of 47.9% [21]. At the
codon usage level, a strong GC-bias was observed for Halobacterium sp. NRC1 [14], but not for H. walsbyi [21]. Thus, at
the genomic level, the GC-bias is not a universal feature for
adaptation to high salinity and other specific features of
nucleotide selection may also be involved.
The current report presents an extensive and systematic analysis of the genome and proteome composition of halophilic
organisms, along with a comparative study of non-halophiles,
with a view to characterize the molecular signatures of halophilic adaptation. We consider 6 completely sequenced obligatory halophiles and compare them with 24 non-halophiles
from various phyla of both Archaea and Bacteria with comparable GC-content to minimize the phylogenetic influence and
the effect of mutational bias on their nucleotide/amino acid

usage patterns. We examine the preferences, if any, in amino
acid replacements from non-halophile to halophile orthologs
in an attempt to understand which residues are instrumental
for halophilic adaptation. Finally, we show how observed patterns of change in amino acid compositions in response to
extreme conditions of the environment are related to physical
principles that govern stability of proteins under such conditions. This study examines in detail the genome and proteome-wide adaptations to extreme environments,
knowledge of which has important potential applications in
various fields, including the engineering of industrial
biomolecules.

Results
Clustering of halophiles by amino acid composition
Clustering on the relative abundances of different amino acid
residues reveals a clear segregation of the halophilic organisms from the non-halophiles (Figure 1). The left panel of Figure 1 depicts the unweighted pair group average clustering on
the relative abundances of different amino acid residues in
the encoded proteins of the 6 extreme halophilic and 24 nonhalophilic organisms under study (Table 1) with respect to
those of Escherichia coli, while the right panel offers a pictorial representation of relative amino acid usage in the respective organisms. As the relative abundances of the residues
increase from 0.35 to 1.80, the color of the respective block
changes from red to green, that is, the greener the color, the
more abundant is the residue in that organism compared to E.
coli. Halophilic organisms show quite distinct usage of amino
acid residues compared to non-halophiles, elucidated by the
presence of either more red or green blocks in Figure 1.
Among the prominent trends are significant increases in Asp,
Glu, Val, and Thr residues and decreases in Lys, Met, Leu, Ile,
and Cys in halophilic proteomes. Usage of Ile is lower in all
halophiles except H. walsbyi, probably due to its significantly
lower genomic GC-content (Table 1). The increase in negatively charged (Asp and Glu) and Thr residues and the
decrease in Lys and strong hydrophobic residues (Ile, Met,
Leu) are consistent with earlier reports [4,12,14,18,22]. A relatively higher frequency of Val in extreme halophiles compared to non-halophiles supports the observation of Madern
et al. [15], but contradicts earlier propositions on under-representation of all strong hydrophobic residues in halophiles
[4,23].
Similar to the cluster analysis, correspondence analysis
(COA) on amino acid usage also segregates the halophilic
organisms from the non-halophiles along the second principal axis (Figure 2a). The first two principal axes of the COA
contribute 16.29% and 13.79%, respectively, to the total variability. A strong negative correlation (r2 = 0.57, p < 10-7) of
axis 1 with the GC-content of the respective genomes identifies GC-bias as one of the major sources of inter-species variation in global amino acid composition, while the
contributions to axis 2 come from hydrophobicity (negative

Grouping of halophiles and non-halophiles according to their standardized amino acid usage
Grouping of halophiles and non-halophiles according to their standardized amino acid usage. Standardized amino acid composition of halophiles and nonhalophiles grouped by unweighted pair group average clustering. The left panel depicts the unweighted pair group average clustering on the relative
abundances of different amino acid residues in the encoded proteins of organisms with respect to those of E. coli. The distance in the clustering is Euclidean
distance. The right panel is a pictorial representation of relative amino acid usage in the respective organisms. The over-representation or underrepresentation of amino acid residues in the organisms are shown in green and red colored blocks, respectively. Archaeal species are denoted in pink

correlation, with r2 = 0.65, p < 10-7) and the ratio of negatively
versus positively charged amino acid residues (positive correlation, with r2 = 0.26, p < 10-7) of the encoded gene products
of the organisms. This indicates, therefore, that the proteins
of halophilic organisms are characterized by less hydrophobicity (or higher hydrophilicity) and relatively higher usage of
negatively charged amino acids compared to non-halophile
proteins. Figure 2b, c also supports the corollary that the features of halophilic proteomes are unique and quite distinct
from those of non-halophiles with respect to hydrophobicity
and usage of negatively charged amino acids (as predicted by
isoelectric point distribution of encoded proteins).
All these trends are specifically exhibited by halophiles irrespective of their taxonomic origins and their genomic GCcontent (Additional data file 1 and Table 1). For instance, five
archaeal halophiles appear in a distinct cluster, far away from
other closely related archaeal species like Methanosaeta thermophila, Thermoplasma acidophilum and so on (Figure 1).
The salt-adapted bacteroidetes/chlorobi Salinibacter ruber
also intermingles with these halophilic archaea - wide apart
from Pelodictyon luteolum, its closest non-halophilic taxonomic relative. H. walsbyi, a halophile with relatively low GCcontent (47.9%), appears in the same cluster along with the
GC-rich halophiles, while the three non-halophilic species
with similar GC-content and (E. coli, 50%; Shigella boydii
47.4%; and Yersinia pestis, 47.8%) cluster with the other

non-halophiles, most of which are characterized by much
higher GC-content. It is worth mentioning at this point that
organisms with high growth temperature also cluster
together (Figure 1), of which two methanogenic organisms
(M. thermophila and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus) share the same node. The distinct branching
pattern of three thermophiles with relatively low genomic
GC-content (T. acidophilum, Thermotoga maritima and
Thermococcus kodakarensis) suggests that the overall GCcontent also plays a significant role in shaping the amino acid
composition of such organisms, as observed previously by
Kreil and Ouzounis [24]. The exact topology of the cluster and
values indicated by the colored blocks depend on the choice of
standardization and the algorithm used for their construction, but the resulting grouping of the organisms in Figure 1
does not change significantly from that obtained using actual
amino acid compositions of the respective organisms. These
observations point towards convergent evolution of halophilic proteomes for specific amino acid composition, despite
their varying GC-bias and widely disparate taxonomic
positions.

Comparison with non-halophilic orthologs
A comparison of orthologous proteins (cytosolic and membrane proteins separately) between halophilic and non-halophilic organisms was performed to identify the underlying
factors for halophilic adaptation in more detail. Table 2 sum-

marizes different proteomic properties of four sets of orthologous cytosolic proteins between halophiles and nonhalophiles. In all cases, there is a significant increase in negatively charged, hydrophobic (Val) and borderline
hydrophobic (Thr) residues and a decrease in positively
charged, large hydrophobic and Cys residues (Table 2).
Among negatively charged residues, the abundance of Asp
(44% for set I, 65% for set II, 69% for set III and 55% for set
IV) is higher than that of Glu (16% for set I, 43% for set II,
26% for set III and 34% for set IV). Similar trends were
observed for the membrane proteins, although fairly large
differences in amino acid usage were not found (data not
shown).

We determined the frequencies of all possible amino acid
replacements (that is, (20 × 19)/2 = 190 possible pairs of
replacements) between the orthologous sequences in the
direction from non-halophile to halophile proteins (Additional data files 2-5). There are 59 (31% of all possible pairs),
51 (26% of all possible pairs), 81 (42% of all possible pairs)
and 76 (40% of all possible pairs) pairs of amino acids for sets
I, II, III and IV, respectively, that have significant directional replacement bias (p < 10-2 for set II; p < 10-3 for set I;
and p < 10-6 for sets III and IV). They contribute 56%, 52%,
66% and 63% of the replacements for set I (28,267 of the
50,403 observed replacements), set II (10,815 of the 20,685

observed replacements), respectively (Additional data files 69). The top 20 replacements in all these sets suggest that there
are two clear trends in amino acid substitution patterns in
terms of highest gain as well as highest ratio (Table d usage
were not found (data not shown).3). These are: Lys (nonhalophile) substituted by other residues (halophile); and
other residues (non-halophile) substituted by acidic residues,
especially Asp (halophile). Lys→Asp topped the list of most
significantly biased substitutions in terms of ratio in all the
sets under study, indicating that this trend is independent of
GC-composition and phylogeny. Another notable trend is Ile/
Leu (non-halophile) substituted by Val/other residues (halophile). In set II, where the orthologs are of similar GC-composition, there is a prevalence of overall gain in Asp, Glu, Val and
Thr, which are also gained in sets I, III and IV in halophile
from non-halophile orthologs (Table 3). Thus, there is a prevalence of overall gain in Asp, Glu, Val and Thr and the most
prominent losses common in all four groups are Lys, Ile, Met,
Leu and Cys in halophile from non-halophile orthologs. This
result suggests that such gains and losses indeed represent an
imprint of halophilic adaptation, and not the dragging effect
of mutational bias or taxonomic differences.

Secondary structure comparison of orthologous
sequences
The results of various traits observed from predicted secondary structure for four sets of orthologs are shown in Table 4.
For all sets there are higher propensities for the formation of
random coil regions and lower propensities for the formation

of helical structures in the encoded proteins of halophiles
compared to non-halophile proteins. We measured all nine
types of secondary structure replacements of amino acid residues between four sets of orthologous protein sequences
from non-halophilic organisms to halophilic organisms
(Table 5). In all data sets, residues having higher propensities
for helix or sheet formation in non-halophile proteins are
replaced by residues having higher propensities for coil formation in halophile orthologs. The differences in the contributions of individual amino acids to the predicted secondary
structures between halophiles and non-halophiles for four
sets of proteins are given in Figure 3. The large hydrophobic
(Leu, Met) and positively charged (Lys) amino acids with
higher helical propensity are significantly underrepresented,
whereas the Asp residue, with higher coil forming propensity,
is greatly over-represented in halophile proteins. There is also
a significant decrease in Ile and an increase in Val and Thr
residues, all of which have higher sheet-forming propensities.

Comparison between known protein structures
One pair of crystal structures of the protein malate dehydrogenase (MDH) from halophilic Haloarcula marismortui and
its ortholog from non-halophilic Chlorobium vibrioforme
was selected and the secondary structures of these proteins
were calculated with the help of the program MolMol. There
is a marked decrease in helix forming regions in H. marismortui MDH (43.7% decrease) compared to C. vibrioforme
MDH (48.5% decrease). The comparison of aligned
sequences of secondary structure regions using the DSSP pro-

gram also lends supports to this notion (Figure 4). In the
MDH of H. marismortui (pI = 4.2; Hydrophobicity = -0.408),
the cumulative frequency of Asp and Glu is 20.5%, whereas in
C. vibrioforme MDH (pI = 5.3; Hydrophobicity = 0.136) it is
12.9%.

Amino acid preference in halophiles is not a
consequence of mono-nucleotide composition bias
The distinct amino acid usage pattern in halophiles might
have originated from compositional bias operating at the
nucleotide level, or from the preference for, or avoidance of,
specific amino acid residues as a tool for halophilic adaptation. With a view to distinguish between these two possibilities, we randomly re-shuffled the nucleotides in the coding
sequences of all genomes and calculated the average amino
acid composition of the hypothetical protein sequences of
halophiles and non-halophiles obtained from the theoretical
translation of the reshuffled gene sequences. If the selection
had operated at the mono-nucleotide level, proteins translated from such randomly reshuffled hypothetical sequences
of halophiles should feature similar trends as depicted by
their true proteomes, since the nucleotide bias of the reshuffled sequences would have remained the same as those of the
real gene sequences. On the contrary, if the distinct amino
acid composition of halophile proteomes had evolved due to
environmental adaptation of these extremophiles, the trends
in amino acid usage in reshuffled hypothetical sequences
would differ from those of actual halophilic proteins. In Figure 5, the striking difference between average amino acid
compositions of halophilic and non-halophilic organisms for
real proteomes and hypothetical proteomes simulated from
reshuffled DNA suggest that some factors, other than the
mono-nucleotide usage, influence the amino acid composition of proteins to maintain structure and function under
halophilic conditions.

halophile protein sequences. Therefore, halophiles have a
specific genome signature at the dinucleotide level, and this
trend seems to be linked to a specific amino acid composition
of proteins for halophilic adaptation. The high temperature
adapted organisms seem to cluster together according to their
overall dinucleotide relative abundance value except Thermoplasma acidophilum. However, on the basis of dinucleotide
frequencies at the first and second codon positions of genes,
these organisms cluster together irrespective of any phylogenetic relationship. In order to figure out the possible impact
of the relative abundance of specific dinucleotides on the
mechanical properties of halophilic genomes, we calculated
the likelihood of their sequences forming a Z-DNA structure,
using ZHunt software [25]. We found that there is a
significant correlation (r2 = 0.54, p < 10-4) between the propensity of DNA to flip from the B-form to the Z-form per kilobase of genome and the relative abundance of the CG
dinucleotide.

Synonymous codon usage bias in halophiles

Genomic signature of halophiles

In an attempt to examine whether the pattern of synonymous
codon usage in halophiles follows any specific signature, COA
was performed on the relative synonymous codon usage
(RSCU) of 82,927 predicted open reading frames (ORFs)
from 30 microbial genomes (listed in Table 1). The axis 1-axis
3 plot in Figure 7a of the COA on RSCU values exhibits two
distinct clusters, the halophile and non-halophile genomes
being segregated along the third major axis, whereas the axis
1-axis 2 plot in Figure 7c separates thermophilic organisms
from mesophiles, indicating distinct usage of synonymous
codons in thermophiles, as reported earlier [8,26]. This is the
first report that the pattern of synonymous codon usage in the
halophilic prokaryotes is different from that in the non-halophilic prokaryotes. Axis 1 values show highly significant correlation with the GC3 values (r2 = 0.85, p < 10-7), indicating
separation of genomes according to their genomic GC-content.

We calculated the dinucleotide abundance of all genomes to
find out whether any specific nucleotide composition has significant influence on the genomic signature of obligatory
halophiles. Clustering on dinucleotide abundance by cityblock (Manhattan) distance clearly segregates the halophilic
organisms (with over-representation of GA/TC, CG and AC/
GT dinucleotides) from the non-halophiles (Figure 6a; Additional data file 10) irrespective of their archaeal or bacterial
origin. In other words, the dinucleotide abundance profiles of
halophilic genomes bear some common characteristics,
which are quite distinct from those of non-halophiles and,
hence, these may be regarded as specific genomic signatures
for salt-adaptation. Cluster analysis on dinucleotide frequencies at the first and second codon positions of genes for all
organisms also yielded separate clusters for halophiles and
non-halophiles (Figure 6b). The higher frequencies of occurrence of GA, AC and GT dinucleotides at the first and second
codon positions (Additional data file 11) undoubtedly reflect
the requirements for Asp, Glu, Thr and Val residues in

While differences in genomic GC-content and high temperature adaptation explain variations along the first and second
major axes (representing 19.4 % and 11.1% of total variation,
respectively) of the COA of RSCU, the variation along the
third major axis (representing 9.1% of total variation) separates the halophiles from the non-halophiles. The
distribution of codons along axis 3 (Figure 7b) depicts that the
major contributors to this pattern are the distinct usage of
synonymous codons encoding Arg (CGA and CGG being preferred by halophiles), Val (GUC is most preferred by
halophiles), Thr (ACG is preferred by halophiles), Leu (CUC
is the most preferred codon in halophiles) and Cys (UGU is
generally preferred by halophiles). Comparison of codon
usage values of 5,000 genes from both extremes of axis 3
shows that there are 18 and 14 codons, usage of which is significantly higher in the genes from the positive extreme and
the negative extreme, respectively (Additional data file 12). Of
the genes at the positive extreme, 97.5% are from halophiles,

whereas 99.9% of the genes at the negative extreme are from
non-halophiles. This means that in spite of their long-term
evolutionary history, genes of the halophiles, in general, have
converged to similar patterns of codon usage, which is quite
distinct from the patterns followed by genes of non-halophilic
organisms.

genomic/proteomic determinants of halophilic adaptation in
prokaryotes. From this study, it appears that specific trends
in amino acid usage are required for halophilic adaptation of
organisms, irrespective of their genomic GC-content and taxonomic position. Evidence in favor of specific selection on
dinucleotide and synonymous codon usage are apparent for
halophiles (Figures 6a and 7a). Also, with regard to protein
secondary structure, residues having lower propensities for

forming alpha helical regions and higher propensities for
forming coil-forming regions are preferred more in halophiles than non-halophiles (Table 4). All of these findings
strongly support the notion of convergent evolution not only
at the level of proteome composition, but also at the level of
genome organization of the microorganisms adapted to high
salt environments.

Values represent ratios in number of forward (non-halophiles to halophiles) and backward (halophiles to non-halophiles) replacements. Entries in
bold are significant at p < 10-3. Organism abbreviations are listed in Table 1.

In order to subtract out the phylogenetic influence, we have
included both bacterial and archaeal organisms in the dataset
(Table 1). The dataset of halophilic organisms contains all
available completely sequenced halophilic archaeal and bacterial species in the public domain, while the dataset of nonhalophiles contains genome sequences of eight archaeal and
sixteen bacterial species of diverse taxonomic origins. Among
the archaeal non-halophiles are M. thermophila from Methanogens group II and T. acidophilum from Thermoplasmatales - organisms very close to haloarchaea as per the 16s rRNA
tree (Additional data file 1). Among bacterial non-halophiles,
we chose members from different bacterial phyla, such as
proteobacteria, firmicutes, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria and
especially P. luteolum from the bacteroidetes/chlorobi group
to which the halophilic bacteria S. ruber belongs (Additional
data file 1). It can be concluded, therefore, that the determinants of genomic/proteomic architecture in halophilic
organisms are high salt adaptation specific, and transcend the
boundary of phylogenetic relationships and the genomic GCcontent of the species.
We have considered two chromosomes of H. marismortui in
our analysis and found that the amino acid usage, dinucleotide relative abundance and synonymous codon usage of
chromosome II are quite different from those of chromosome
I (Figures 1, 2a, 6, and 7a), whereas they are relatively closer
to each other in the 16s rRNA tree (Additional data file 1). This
observation supports the earlier notion [27] that almost the
entire chromosome II of H. marismortui might have been
acquired later during evolution, while its rRNA operon might
have originated through duplication and subsequent divergence from the rRNA operons of chromosome I.
Our study clearly indicates that halophile proteins prefer to
use Asp, Glu, Val and Thr at the expense of Lys, Met, Leu, Ile
and Cys. Among the residues favored in the halophilic proteome, Asp and Glu are negatively charged and may localize

in patches on protein surfaces. By binding a network of
hydrated cations, they help in the maintenance of protein
activities at high salt concentrations [12,14,18,22]. The less
common residues in high salt-adapted organisms include the
positively charged residue Lys and several large and strongly
hydrophobic residues like Leu, Ile and Met. An empirical
correlation between halophilic adaptations of some proteins
and their relatively low hydrophobicity was reported earlier
[28]. It is interesting to note that although halophilic
proteomes are, in general, characterized by lower hydrophobicity compared to non-halophiles, the usages of Val and Thr
are significantly higher in them (Figure 1, Table 2). Usage of
the strong hydrophobic residue Ile is also relatively higher in
H. walsbyi, possibly due to its significantly lower genomic
GC-content. At high salt concentrations, proteins are, in general, destabilized [29]. Halophile proteins have, therefore,
evolved specific mechanisms that allow them to be both stable
and soluble in the high cytoplasmic NaCl/KCl concentration.
In this environment the hydrophobic residues of newly synthesized proteins are exposed to high salt concentrations,
leading to non-specific inter- or intramolecular interactions
of their side chains, which may compete with proper intramolecular burial within the correct conformation [30]. Probably
to minimize this possibility, all soluble halophilic proteins
have a lower number of hydrophobic residues. The increase in
negative charge on the surface of halophile proteins
counteracts the lower dielectric constant at high salinity and
thus provides for enhanced protein solubility.
Our results show that there is a marked, significant difference
in the predicted secondary structures of halophile and nonhalophile proteins. In proteins with higher percentages of
helix structure, there is an increased overall packing that
imparts more rigidity [31] and, hence, a decrease in regions
with helix-forming propensities in halophile proteins probably makes them more flexible. As protein flexibility and protein function are strongly linked [32,33], a reduction in helix-

forming regions or, in other words, an enhancement in protein flexibility, might be a strategy of halophile proteins for
adaptation to extreme salt environments. It is worth mentioning in this context that Radivojac et al. [34] divided native
proteins into four flexibility categories and found that flexible
but ordered proteins are characterized by higher average
hydrophilicity and higher occurrence of negatively charged
residues, especially Asp. From a structural viewpoint, Asp is
recognized as an alpha-helix breaker, whereas Glu is favorable for alpha-helix formation [35]. The coiled regions of proteins are known to prefer Asp over Glu in general [36]. These
could be plausible reasons why halophile proteins use Asp
residues more than Glu residues.
A striking observation that has not been reported earlier and
deserves mention is the consistent lower usage of Cys residues in halophile proteins. Cys residues are usually
overrepresented in non-flexible regions due to the formation
of rigid disulfide-bridges [33,37]. Avoidance of Cys residues
in halophile gene products might give them more flexibility in
high salt environments. Increased usage of Val in halophile
proteins may also make them more flexible, because the
strong hydrophobic residue Val has a lower helix formation
propensity than other strong hydrophobic residues such as
Leu, Met and Ile [36]. Thus, halophile proteins might have

evolved to be more flexible but ordered and exhibit distinct
secondary structure composition that has helped them to
avoid aggregation and/or loss of function in extreme salt
environments.
Like proteome composition, halophilic adaptation is also
associated with a specific genome signature. The obligatory
halophiles generally contain GC-rich genomes (well above
60%), except for H. walsbyi (genomic GC-content of 48.7%).
A high GC-content in halophilic genomes is thought to help in
avoiding UV-induced thymidine dimer formation and the
possible accumulation of mutations in their specialized habitat (shallow coastal lagoons), characterized by high levels of
UV irradiation [14,19]. In H. walsbyi, the disadvantage of a
low GC-genome is thought to be partly compensated for by
the presence of a relatively higher number (four copies) of
photolyases [21]. Our analysis reveals that the genomes of all
obligatory halophiles show definite dinucleotide abundance
(higher abundance values for CG, GA/TC and AC/GT) compared to non-halophiles (Figure 6a, Additional file 10). The
genomic signature revealed by dinucleotide abundance analysis for halophiles, in general, is not species-specific, but salt
adaptation specific, and hence may be an outcome of convergent evolution. The higher frequency of GA, AC and GT
dinucleotides at the first and second codon positions

undoubtedly reflects the requirement for Asp, Glu, Thr and
Val residues in halophile protein sequences. The higher
occurrence of the CG dinucleotide leads to a higher stacking
energy, thus imparting stability to genomic DNA [38]. It is
also known that high salt concentrations have a strong influence on the transition of B-DNA to Z-DNA and the relative
stabilization of Z-DNA increases with increasing salt concentration [39]. Hence, the enhancement of the total stacking
interaction (base-pair stacking and deoxyribose purine stacking) could contribute to the propensity of short d(CG)n
sequences to adopt the Z-conformation [40]. A significant
correlation (r2 = 0.54, p < 10-4) between the propensity of ZDNA formation per kilobase in genomes with a relatively high
abundance of CG dinucleotides supports this notion. We also
observed that the pattern of synonymous codon usage in
halophiles is significantly different from that in non-halophiles (Figure 7, Additional data file 12). Essentially, our
results show that codon usage pattern among the 30 genomes
(6 halophiles and 24 non-halophiles) is determined by three
major factors: overall GC-bias (explained by the first major
axis); a temperature dependent factor (explained by the second major axis); and a salinity dependent factor (explained by
the third major axis). The COA on RSCU thus provides convincing evidence that synonymous codon usage in halophiles
follows a similar trend, which is quite distinct from the trends
observed in non-halophiles. Since the difference in synonymous codon usage between halophiles and non-halophiles is
not due to a simple difference in the nucleotide content of the

genomes, it seems that natural selection may be linked to the
codon usage pattern of halophilic prokaryotes.

Conclusion

The present study demonstrates the generality of the mechanisms of macromolecular adaptation of extreme salt-loving
organisms, irrespective of their genomic GC-content and
taxonomic position. At the protein level, these include: convergent evolution towards a specific proteome composition,
characterized by low hydrophobicity; over-representation of
acidic residues, especially Asp; higher usage of Val and Thr;
lower usage of Cys; and a lower propensity for helix formation
and a higher propensity for coil structure. Among the signatures of halophilic adaptation at the DNA level, the abundance of GA, AC and GT dinucleotides may partly be coupled
with the specific amino acid requirements, while CG dinucleotide abundance may be an additional halophilic signature of
DNA stability at high salt concentration. The synonymous
codon usage in halophiles also seems to have converged to a
single pattern regardless of their long-term evolutionary
history.

NaCl) and 24 non-halophiles from Archaea (both euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota) and bacteria (including proteobacteria, firmicutes, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes/
chlorobi, and so on) were retrieved from NCBI GenBank (version 145.0) and Halolex databases [41] (listed in Table 1).
Except for H. walsbyi, all the extreme halophilic organisms
are GC-rich, so to minimize the GC-compositional effect on
amino acid usage comparison (as well as on codon usage),
most of the chosen non-halophilic organisms are similarly
GC-rich, while some others have GC-content comparable to
that of H. walsbyi.

Cluster analysis and correspondence analysis on amino
acid usage
To find the differences in amino acid usage between extreme
halophilic and non-halophilic organisms, the cluster analysis
on amino acid composition was carried out using STATISTICA (version 6.0, published by Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA) for all 30 organisms (Table 1). The amino acid
usage of E. coli was chosen as a well-defined reference for
standardization. Subsequently, using a program developed in
Visual Basic, a 31 × 20 matrix was generated, where the rows
and the columns correspond to data sources (that is, organisms in the cluster) and standardized amino acid usage values, respectively. The over-representation or underrepresentation of standardized amino acid usage values of the
organisms in the matrix are shown in green or red colored
blocks in Figure 1, respectively.
COA on amino acid usage was performed using the program
CODONW 1.4.2 [42] to identify the major factors influencing
the variation in amino acid frequencies. These analyses generate a series of orthogonal axes to identify trends that
explain the variation within a dataset, with each subsequent
axis explaining a decreasing amount of the variation.

Dinucleotide analysis and reshuffling of DNA
sequences
In order to identify any halophile-specific genome signature,
dinucleotide abundance values [38,43] of genomes of
halophiles and non-halophiles were calculated. Clustering of
organisms on dinucleotide abundance values was done by the
single linkage method and the nearest neighbor analysis was
carried out using city-block (Manhattan) distance, calculated
by summing the (absolute) differences between point coordinates. Dinucleotide frequencies at all three codon positions of
each gene were also calculated and clustering was done using
the single linkage method with Euclidean distance, which corresponds to the length of the shortest path between two
points. Reshuffling of DNA sequences of ORFs was performed by swapping two randomly chosen nucleotides [44] in
the sequence except start and stop codons (we rejected
shuffling in cases where stop codons appeared within the
ORFs), and repeating this swapping procedure for 3N times,
where N is the length of the sequence.

Amino acid exchange bias and secondary structure
prediction with orthologous sequences
Four sets of orthologous sequences between halophiles and
non-halophiles were identified (according to the comparable
GC-content of the species and also according to the close phylogenetic relationships) using the BlastP program [45] using
a cutoff of E = 1.0 × 10-10. Hits less than 60% similar and having more than 20% difference in length with the query were
removed from the dataset. Putative membrane proteins and
proteins likely to be secreted or localized to the cell surface,
predicted using TMHMM2.0 [46] and SignalP3.0 [47], were
also separated out. Using these criteria we identified four sets
of orthologs. Set I included 287 orthologous proteins of two
closely related species - the halophile S. ruber and the nonhalophile P. luteolum - both belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes/chlorobi. Set II contained 104 orthologous sequences
from two species with similar GC-content (Table 1) - the halophilic archaeon H. marismortui (Ch-I) and non-halophilic
bacteria Pseudomonas putida. Set III contained 584 orthologous proteins from a halophilic and a thermophilic archaeon,
namely H. marismortui (Ch-I) and M. thermophila. Set IV
incorporated 574 orthologous proteins of the halophilic
archaeon Natronomonas pharaonis and uncultured methanogenic archaeon RC -I.
The amino acid sequences of these four sets of orthologous
genes were aligned using ClustalW [48] and the amino acid
replacements were arranged in a 20 × 20 matrix using Substitution Pattern Analysis Software Tool (SPAST), a program in
C++, developed in-house [49]. Secondary structure prediction of orthologous protein sequences were carried out using
the Predator program [50]. The content of amino acid
residues in helix, sheet and random coil regions were computed. Secondary structure replacements were calculated by
aligning orthologous protein sequences. All these calculations
were performed by a C++ program developed in-house.
While examining the trends in amino acid or secondary structure replacements, the direction of conversion of non-halophile proteins to extreme halophile proteins were taken by
convention as the 'forward' direction. Under unbiased conditions, the ratio of forward to reverse replacements was
expected to be 1:1 for each pair of replacements. To test this
hypothesis, the observed and expected numbers (based on a
1:1 ratio) were recorded for each pair of residues belonging to
a particular group. In all cases, the chi-square test was applied
to assess the significance of the directional bias, if any, at significance levels of 10-3 to 10-6. For each pair of replacements,
the first and second rows of the 2 × 2 contingency table represented the number of replacements from one particular residue (say, i) to another (say, j) of the pair and the total count of
the remaining replacements (say, k) from the residue i (where
k ≠ j), respectively.

Indices used to identify the trends in codon and amino
acid usage
Indices like RSCU [51], GC-content at third codon position,
amino acid frequencies and average hydrophobicity (Gravy
score) [52] of protein coding sequences were calculated to
find out the factors influencing codon and amino acid usage.
The isoelectric point (pI) of each protein was calculated using
the Expasy proteomics server [53]. Calculation of the likelihood of a DNA sequence forming a Z-DNA structure was done
using the ZHunt server [25].

Comparison with known protein secondary structures
We obtained one pair of protein structures for extreme halophilic and non-halophilic organisms from the Protein Data
Bank. The pair contains (Blast p-value 1e-38) MDHs from H.
marismortui (1D3A) [54] and C. vibrioforme (1GV1) [55].
The secondary structures of the modeled proteins were calculated using MolMol [56] and DSSP [57].
