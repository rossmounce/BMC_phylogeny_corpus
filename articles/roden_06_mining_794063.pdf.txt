Abstract
Background: There are many methods for analyzing microarray data that group together genes
having similar patterns of expression over all conditions tested. However, in many instances the
biologically important goal is to identify relatively small sets of genes that share coherent
expression across only some conditions, rather than all or most conditions as required in
traditional clustering; e.g. genes that are highly up-regulated and/or down-regulated similarly across
only a subset of conditions. Equally important is the need to learn which conditions are the decisive
ones in forming such gene sets of interest, and how they relate to diverse conditional covariates,
such as disease diagnosis or prognosis.
Results: We present a method for automatically identifying such candidate sets of biologically
relevant genes using a combination of principal components analysis and information theoretic
metrics. To enable easy use of our methods, we have developed a data analysis package that
facilitates visualization and subsequent data mining of the independent sources of significant
variation present in gene microarray expression datasets (or in any other similarly structured highdimensional dataset). We applied these tools to two public datasets, and highlight sets of genes
most affected by specific subsets of conditions (e.g. tissues, treatments, samples, etc.). Statistically
significant associations for highlighted gene sets were shown via global analysis for Gene Ontology
term enrichment. Together with covariate associations, the tool provides a basis for building
testable hypotheses about the biological or experimental causes of observed variation.
Conclusion: We provide an unsupervised data mining technique for diverse microarray
expression datasets that is distinct from major methods now in routine use. In test uses, this
method, based on publicly available gene annotations, appears to identify numerous sets of
biologically relevant genes. It has proven especially valuable in instances where there are many
diverse conditions (10's to hundreds of different tissues or cell types), a situation in which many
clustering and ordering algorithms become problematic. This approach also shows promise in
other topic domains such as multi-spectral imaging datasets.

Background
Bioinformatics has placed much emphasis on using various unsupervised clustering techniques as a means to
understand the information present in gene microarray
expression datasets. Clustering techniques produce a rich
taxonomy of results by defining groups of genes that act
more or less similarly across a number of experimental
conditions. The diverse approaches to clustering genes by
expression levels include k-means [1], self-organizing
maps [2], hierarchical algorithms [3,4] and probabilistic
models [5]. Some approaches permit clustering of the
conditions as well [6-8]. Based on co-expression, genes
that comprise individual expression clusters are often postulated to be co-regulated, and to the extent that this
hypothesis is correct in any specific biological situation,
the gene cluster definitions can offer key insights into
gene regulatory network (GRN) structure and function.
Another common data mining task is to try to identify
small sets of genes that can serve as effective predictors of
disease diagnosis or prognosis. While clustering at its best
is good at finding sets of genes that are similarly expressed
across all conditions within a dataset, many issues (e.g.
selection of K, stochastic effects, and "noise" from large
numbers of genes that change little over most of the conditions) can prevent clustering from successfully highlighting small groups of interestingly co-expressed genes
[9,10]. This often encountered problem is addressed in
part by hierarchical phylogenetic ordering algorithms
such as average linkage in Mike Eisen's cluster program
[3], but the information biologists seek regarding shared
sub-patterns of co-expression can be obscured by both
algorithmic and visualization constraints. The algorithmic
limitations in hierarchical clustering confound and
"cover" the presence and organization of smaller and
more specific gene groups that are similar across only a
subset of conditions within the larger dataset. In any case,
biologists generally subjectively define a cluster of genes
from such phylogenetic trees based largely on human pattern recognition. Finally, nothing inherent in the clustering approach helps to direct a biologist to which cluster is
interesting or relevant. Instead, biologists generally take
the path of focussing on a group of genes exhibiting a pattern of expression that supports a specific hypothesis, or
search for a known gene or genes of interest within a cluster to form an explanation for others in the cluster.
Support vector machines have been shown to be useful for
identifying small sets of related and predictive genes [1114], but represent a supervised learning approach which
requires one to first define a set of known positive examples, a set of known negative examples, and a specific covariate to predict. We wanted an unsupervised algorithm
that would help us to find relationships and structure in
the data that is more specific than what clustering algo-

rithms usually deliver, yet is hypothesis independent. We
found it efficient and useful to use as an independent
starting tool a very direct approach based on principal
components analysis (PCA, see Methods section). A virtue
is that this approach is computationally efficient for very
large datasets, especially compared with most clustering
algorithms, but is also applicable to much smaller ones. It
allows one to directly explore each of the independent
and diverse sources of variation present within a gene
expression dataset and to subsequently identify the specific genes that vary the most, together with the conditions
in which they vary.
Unlike conventional clustering and ordering algorithms,
this PCA based approach permits a gene to be highlighted
and grouped as influential in multiple condition sets,
whereas in cluster membership a gene is typically assigned
to one unique cluster. The "single cluster assignment"
quality of traditional clustering and ordering algorithms is
problematical because it tends to hide commonality of
expression that is restricted to a small, interesting, and
often entirely unpredicted subgroups of tissues, cell types,
treatments or other condition types. This situation, perhaps because of inherent properties of gene network structure, will arise increasingly as the number and diversity of
conditions represented in expression datasets increases.
The clustering method of Barkai et al. [15,16] addresses
this issue of multiple membership in a different way, by
using randomly-selected gene sets to iteratively search for
and refine self-consistent groups. Their approach, which is
related to PCA through singular value decomposition
(SVD), also permits genes to be assigned to multiple
"expression modules." In contrast to the method presented here, there is no provision for correlating modules
with covariate data.
The use of principal components analysis presented here
differs from other recent applications in gene expression
analysis. PCA is most commonly used in as a means of
dimensionality reduction prior to clustering [7,17] or
prior to classification [18,19]. It is also used to visualize or
confirm clustering results [19-21]. In contrast, our use of
PCA aims to find, then examine, and where possible, generate hypotheses to explain individual principal components. In this manner, we build on the observations by
Hilsenbeck [22] Raychaudhuri et. al. [23] who used PCA
to gain insight into the underlying factors present in the
Chu et. al. yeast sporulation experiments [24]. Wall et. al.
[25] introduced a novel use of singular value decomposition (SVD) for gene expression analysis that identifies
non-exclusive gene groups, and Selaru et. al. [26] illustrated the potential of PCA to detect molecular phenotypic bases that correspond to relevant clinical or
biological features of human tumors. Their approach

identifies a subset of principal components that correlate
well with known covariates. Here we introduce methods
that extend beyond producing gene groups and observing
a few principal components. Our methods provide a path
for systematically analyzing each principal component by
identifying the genes most influential in defining a particular principal component and the conditions in which
those influential genes vary significantly. Finally, we
describe methods which aim to explain each principal
component's observed variance in terms of the condition
variables deemed most likely to be driving the variance.
We also introduce a software package that implements
these methods. These methods and our software package
provide automated and objective way of doing what a
biologist naturally tries to do through inspection and pattern recognition.

Implementation
We have developed a Python package to implement the
PCA interpretation capability described in detail in the
Methodology section. This PCA analysis package has been
added to CompClust developed previously [9,27]. The
combined packages allow one to cluster, classify and visualize numeric datasets that have discrete or numeric annotations (referred to as labelings, or labelled datasets), and
to compare labelings with confusion matrices and metrics
such as normalized mutual information (NMI) [28]. This
PCA analysis tool (including the complete results for the
dataset analysis described in the Results section) has also
been made accessible through the CompClustWeb webbased interface [29]. Our software makes use of data
manipulation and graphical plotting using the matplotlib
package [30], and the statistics are generated using the rPy
package [31] and Gary Strangman's Python stats package
[32].
The web-based front-end permits users to get a complete
report on the interpretation of each principal component,
including interactive PCA projection plots with the principal component's extreme genes (PCEGs) highlighted;
ranked lists of the PCEGs with detailed annotations; interactive significance-ordered gene set trajectory plots that
permit users to drill down to the individual gene level;
similarly ordered condition reports ordered by expression
difference and grouped by significance, including covariate info (with significantly correlated covariates highlighted); and finally a report of any suggestive covariates
that are well correlated with the significant column grouping, including the confusion matrices and/or plots of statistics scores to back up the conclusions. All principal
component analysis and results generation is implemented in a Python package so that analyses of large datasets can be executed in a batch mode rather than through
the graphical interface. Further, the software that implements the CompClustWeb interface is provided within

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/194

the CompClust package, so a software developer can create his or her own CompClustWeb server to review results
of their PCA interpretation.

Results
Application to microarray expression data, Case 1: GNF
human data
We obtained gene expression data from the Genomics
Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation ("GNF")
Gene Expression Database via their SymAtlas web site
[33,34]. The dataset is a challenge for most clustering
algorithms because it contains 158 tissue samples hybridized to two Affymetrix microarray chips: U133A and
GNF1H. The dataset combines the measurements of these
chips to provide a total of 33,689 unique probe identities
across the 158 tissue samples. Expression data are signal
intensities estimated by Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5.
For our analysis we used the log base 2 of the expression
signal, and included data for all tissues and probes (noting that absent and present calls were not provided with
the signal intensities). We applied our principal components analysis tool to generate interpretations for each of
this dataset's 158 principal components.

As detailed in the Methodology section, for each principal
component we identified a set of gene probes occupying
the high and low extremes of that principal component's
axis (we refer to these as principal component extreme
genes, or PCEGs). One can adjust parameters to recover
smaller and larger numbers of PCEGs per component by
specifying either a likelihood threshold or an explicit
number of PCEGs. The PCEGs are those probes having the
most highly weighted values for that principal component, selected because they stand out from the others, they
influence the principal component's direction, and thus
they warrant further investigation. We selected probes
with likelihoods less than extremeThresh = 0.00001, which
yielded on average 20 low and 20 high extreme genes per
principal component, though the sets sizes do vary considerably (µ = 18.9, σ = 17.2). Next we identified the tissues in which the high PCEGs showed significantly
different expression than the low PCEGs. Visualizations
produced include scatter plots of the extreme genes in
PCA sub-spaces (PC N-1vs. PC N), and extreme gene trajectories in original tissue order as well as with tissues
ordered by decreasing difference of mean of high PCEGs
and mean of low PCEGs. The latter trajectory plot emphasizes how the extreme genes for a principal component
show a pattern of expression that imposes a partitioning
of tissues. It is left to human interpretation to examine the
extreme genes and the tissue partitioning exposed by each
principal component, and thus to build hypotheses that
attach meaning to the sources of variation. The percentage
variance explained by the top 50 principal components is
provided in Table 1. Example results for two illustrative

lists the percentage of variance in the GNF human tissue
microarray data explained by each principal component. The
first 10 components explain 80.36% of the total variance.
Principal components 11 through 158 each explain less than 0.5%
of the total variance, but combined explain almost 20%.

principal components, PC7 and PC21, are shown in Figures 1 through 4 and in Tables 2 through 5, and are discussed below. The complete analysis results generated for
PC7 are provided as an example in the supplemental files:
[see Additional file 1], [see Additional file 2], [see Additional file 3], [see Additional file 4], [see Additional file 5],
[see Additional file 6]. Our supplemental materials web
site [35] contains the complete collection of PCA interpretation results generated for these dataset for all principal
components, as well as results of a comparable analysis
done at extremeThresh = 0.001 which yielded larger PCEG
sets.
We addressed the question of biological and statistical significance of PCs and the sets of extreme genes identified.
Each set of high and low extreme genes from each principal component was tested for Gene Ontology (GO) statistical enrichment when compared to the human GO
annotations from NCBI's loc2go dataset using the hypergeometric to calculate the p-value of each GO term. Terms
that were enriched for a particular PC at 1% significance
threshold and that were still significant following a Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing as
described in [36] are reported as enriched (see Table 6).
26 of the top 42 PCEG lists, derived using a stringent cutoff of 0.00001, produced significant GO enrichments; no
PCEG sets beyond PC42 showed significant enrichment.
As discussed below, many of the significant results
showed obvious biological coherence and relationships
to the specific samples associated with the PC of origin.
This argues that PCs containing less than 1% of the total
variation in this dataset are still relevant and point to
coherent and important gene sets and their related samples.
Relationships between extreme gene sets and the corresponding sets of driving samples could be discerned for
many PCs. The Methodology section presents a way to
additionally correlate each principal component's sample
partitioning with any available sample covariates.
Although some human sample covariate information is
provided in our test case, the GNF human expression
dataset is not amenable to this additional layer of analysis
because multiple subject's RNA samples were pooled
prior to amplification and array hybridization. However,
a second publicly available dataset with rich covariate
information is presented below.
Application to microarray expression data, case 2: human
diabetes
We acquired a Human diabetes expression dataset [37]
from the Broad Institute Cancer Program dataset repository [38] along with the corresponding phenotype covariate data, and applied the filtering step as they described to
produce a set containing 10,983 probes across 43 sam-

ples. Tissue samples were skeletal muscle biopsies from 3
diagnosis groups: normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n =
17); impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n = 8); and Type 2
diabetes mellitus (DM2, n = 18). We used our PCA interpretation software to perform an unsupervised analysis of
the DM2 vs. NGT subset (as that subset is comparable to
the previous published result). As described in the Methodology section, PCEG sets were determined using an
extremeThresh likelihood threshold of 0.001, which
yielded about 50 high and 50 low extreme genes per principal component. For each principal component N, samples were partitioned in to UPN, FLATN and DOWNN
sample sets on the basis of PC-N extreme high and
extreme low expression differences. The supplemental
materials contain PCA interpretation results for all 35
principal components, as well as results of a comparable
analysis done at extremeThresh = 0.0001 which yielded
smaller PCEG sets (see [35]).
This dataset contains more than 50 covariates, which provides the opportunity to interpret each principal component by searching for covariates that correlate well with
expression patterns in the PCEG sets. As described in the
Methodology section, we asked if any of the covariate
annotations are well correlated with the partitioning of
samples into UPN, FLATN and DOWNN sets. Covariate distributions were compared across different partitions
(when sufficient data was available) and any significant
trends identified were recorded (see Table 7). For covariates identified as significantly correlated with a principal
component's sample partitioning, covariate distribution
plots were generated to further investigate and evaluate
the apparent relationship. For example, Figure 5 illustrates
that PC14's UP14, FLAT14 and DOWN14 sample partitions
appear to be significantly related to two covariate measurements: Insulin_0 (sig = 0.0010); and Type2b_(%) (sig=
0.0077). The Pearson's correlation between the mean
expression for the PC14EG-high set and Insulin_0 and
Type2b_(%) covariates are r = 0.411 and r = 0.467 respectively.

Discussion
This PCA-based data-mining tool highlights specific patterns of expression and associates them in a convenient
way with the genes and samples responsible for those patterns. Some associations in the first few principal components (PCs) of the GNF set reflect major features in the
data that are expected. This includes the global high and
low constitutive expression profiles of PC1 (67% of variance in the GNF dataset). A component similar to this is
often the first or second PC in Affymetrix array datasets.
GNF PC3, in contrast, highlighted brain/neuronal tissues,
which we expected in this dataset because there are many
more samples from brain regions than from any other tissue, and there are thousands of genes that are expressed in

a general brain pattern. The GO enrichment analysis associated with PC3lowEGs confirmed this impression by
identifying neurogenesis, central nervous system, and synaptic terms as significantly enriched for PC3EG (Table 6).
We asked if principal components that account individually for small fractions of variation in the data are likely to
be significant. Conventional practice generally ignores
principal components accounting for a few percent, or
less, of total variation, on the assumption that such minor
components are most likely dominated by noise. We
believe this assumption, that all of the PC's accounting for
small fractions of data should be ignored because they are
artefact, to be wrong in the context of our analysis. We
believe this, in part, because in our analysis we find many
PCEGs for minor components are statistically enriched
(Table 6). Further, computational experiments using randomized data fail to produce any significant enrichments.
This GO enrichment analysis, it should be noted, tends to
underestimate the fraction of gene sets that are significant.
This is a known artefact in instances where the input gene
number (here those passing the selected rank sum threshold) is small, and its effects are exacerbated by the fact that
GO annotations for human are still very much in a building phase. Many genes that will eventually be associated

with GO terms are not yet entered. This means that reducing the threshold modestly, and therefore increasing the
gene number, can uncover additional significant GO term
enrichment in some of these PCs. For complete results of
GNF analysis at p < = 0.001 see our supplemental materials web site [35].
Viewed from a biological perspective, this PCA mining
revealed several different classes of relationships. GNF
PC21 is a good example of a component that highlights a
coherent gene set and its corresponding tissues, many of
which would also be grouped together by conventional
clustering algorithms. This is true even though PC21
accounts for just 0.25% of total variation. The PC21EGlow set (defined at p < = 0.00001) was enriched in a statistically significant way for five different GO terms (Table
6), and these terms (myogenesis, muscle contraction, etc.)
tell a simple and internally consistent story about muscle
development and function. The top tissue samples driving
PC21-low are skeletal muscle, tongue (also composed
largely of striated muscle), heart and thyroid (which
includes a population of myoid cells). Most top-ranked
genes in this PCEG set are so specific for striated muscle
that they would also appear together in conventional clusterings, although many clustering approaches become
technically problematic with datasets of this size. How-

ever the PC21EG-low list differs from a conventional muscle cluster because it also includes some genes that are
partly associated with muscle and partly associated with
other tissues. PP1R1A, a regulatory subunit of protein
phosphatase1, is such a gene. A role for it in striated muscle is suggested based on its coherent presence in tongue,
skeletal and cardiac samples, even though it might well
not have been seen in this light by standard clustering.
The second example is GNF PC7, which accounts for
0.81% of variation. It illustrates a different kind of biological relationship that more strongly distinguishes results
of PCA mining from classical clustering. Top extreme
genes associated with PC7 by inspection turn out to be a
"who's who" of extracellular matrix components (a specific subset of fibronectins, collagens, laminins plus
matrix associated proteins like MFAP5, MGP, LUM; regulatory molecules that mediate stability and function of
those matrix components (thrombospondin, SPARC,
ADAMTS1, Plod2); and matrix associated signalling and
matrix associated signal modulators (insulin like growth
factor binding proteins 7, 8 and 10; Sema3c). GO analysis
confirms what inspection of the top PC7EGs suggested:
namely that a set of extracellular matrix components are
expressed in these driving tissues. It is instructive to look
at the individual expression profiles for these genes
directly at the GNF website and also in aggregate, as represented in the tissue (conditions) list in Table 2. The most

prominent contributing tissues associated with high
expression of these genes are informative specifically
because they do not constitute a group that would have
been selected a priori as a coherent set based on known tissue function or shared developmental origin.
This is useful because a biologist interrogating the GNF
database would not likely have constructed a query combining adipocytes, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelium,
nor would one expect traditional clustering algorithms to
place these genes so close to each other as to catalyze the
same observation. Similarly, conventional ordering algorithms would not have placed them adjacent to each other
because other parts of their expression profiles, containing different genes than those in PC7, would dominate
their positions. And concerning genes, they have, in addition to commonalities of expression highlighted by PC7,
differences from each other in additional diverse tissues
not highlighted by PC7. The PCA grouping gives impetus
and a necessary starting gene list to search for one or more
factors or regulatory RNAs with a similar expression pattern, or to search for a shared and perhaps evolutionarily
conserved cis-acting DNA sequence motifs. It is unlikely
that these working hypotheses would have been arrived at
easily by widely used methods of gene expression analysis.

We have applied this to four additional microarray datasets (as yet unpublished) and to one multi-spectral imaging dataset. In each case we found the interpretations that
the tool presented to be useful. In general, it seems that
the top few principal components identify very broad
characteristics of the data. Digging to the deeper components that comprise smaller but more particular substructure in the data leads to more subtle but often meaningful
observations, many being complementary to standard
clustering.

left, FLAT21 group in middle and LOW21 group at right) at
test1Thresh = 0.05. Table 5 lists the tissues within UP21 and
DOWN21 that occur at each end of this plot.

The diabetes dataset offered us an opportunity to add
more value to principal component interpretations by
searching for covariates that appear correlated at some significance level. The relationships highlighted between
covariates and principal components are suggestive, but
not conclusive by themselves. Rather, they provide
hypotheses that a researcher may wish to further investigate. While we have not delved deeply into this dataset,
we believe that a number of the principal components are
highlighting a number of meaningful sources of variation
present. It is not clear whether this set should exhibit the
same proportion of meaningful principal components as
the GNF dataset, as by design the NGT vs. GM2 dataset
does not contain substantial diversity of samples. Likewise, the selection of covariates was focused on a narrow
set of measurements selected to be indicative of diabetes
status, and so many covariates are redundant. We anticipate this tool will be maximally useful in cases where
datasets are rich in both sample complexity and diversity
of covariates.

Conclusion
Results presented above show that this PCA-mining
approach can guide a user to biologically significant
observations that both complement and reinforce those
from conventional clustering analysis. The software package and web interface make this style of microarray analysis straightforward and accessible.

With respect to the top few components, PC1 is usually
the approximate diagonal through the sample/condition
space, explaining the overall variation in absolute expression level. For some other datasets we have noticed that
the top few PCs can also highlight effects of preprocessing
normalization steps or global data quality issues. This
means they do not necessarily expose the most important
biological variation. Thus, in one microarray dataset not
shown here, PC2 was found to be extremely well correlated with a measure of quality of samples, as reflected by
the percent of Affymetrix probes called present. Given this
evidence of data quality effects comprising a major source
of variation over the entire dataset, one might be motivated to remove the major offending conditions, and then
repeat the PCA interpretation on the remaining conditions (columns). The idea is that an independent source
of variation might be obscured by more dominant signals
or noise present in the data from the offending condition.
Our experience thus far leads us to think that this PCA
interpretation method will contribute to microarray
expression analysis, as one part of a panel of methods that
are sensitive to different features in a dataset, such as sample number, gene number, and distribution of variation
across the samples. The PCA method should be especially
useful for large, complex datasets that offer rich variation
among many samples. What is certain is that there are
almost always multiple sources of variation in a dataset
and that in any specific study their nature and relative
strength is informative, whether the origin is an easilyunderstood biologic one, a technical one, or a poorlyunderstood but nonetheless biologically pertinent one.
We are continuing to explore ways to improve our methodology and software package. We anticipate further
advances will come with software infrastructure improvements to permit covariate analyses of both column (sample) covariates and row (gene) covariates. The CompClust
dataset labeling capability [27] allows a user to attach
diverse and numerous labelings to rows or columns. For
example we can pull in additional row (gene probe)
annotations such as Gene Ontology (GO) functional
groups. Beyond explicitly comparing the NMI significance
of specific row partitionings for discrete covariates, we

Diabetes
Diabetes PC14 Sample Partitioning is Correlated with Certain Covariates. When sufficient covariate data is available (a number of the measurements are missing for certain covariates), covariate distributions are compared across partitions
and significant differences are reported (as in Table 7). When a covariate is identified as significantly correlated with a principal
component's sample partitioning, covariate distribution plots can be generated to further investigate and evaluate the apparent
relationship. For example, the diabetes dataset's PC14 extreme genes partition the samples into UP14 (n = 8), FLAT14 (n = 17)
and DOWN14 (n = 10) based on their expression patterns. PC14's UP14 vs. {FLAT14+DOWN14} sample partitioning appears
related to the Insulin_0 measure (sig = 0.001), and the {UP14+FLAT14} vs. DOWN14 partitioning appears related to Type2b_(%)
(sig = 0.008). The mean expression of the PC14EG-high genes appears modestly correlated with Insulin_0 (r = 0.411) and with
Type2b_(%) (r = 0.467). UP14 samples are in red, FLAT14 are black, and DOWN14 are blue.

plan to add routines to CompClust to automatically indicate when a group of genes are found to be enriched in
specific GO categories (as was done in our analyses
above), and more generally to handle large, discrete,
multi-valued distributions of values. Our use of NMI
treats discrete covariates as discrete random variables that
can have at most a single value per condition, and so does
not optimally address issue of multi-valued discrete random variables (e.g. GNF data has covariate "concomitant
medications" with values like "aspirin", "tylenol", and

"aspirin & tylenol"). We are considering more elaborate
extensions of mutual information or alternatives that
might be able to take further advantage of such multi-valued entries.

We recommend that interested researchers use the webbased application, CompClustWeb, from any platform to
review the PCA interpretation results for the GNF human
gene expression and Broad Institute human diabetes
expression data sets. We have written a CompClust PCA
interpretation tutorial that demonstrates how to use CompClust's programming interface to generate PCA interpre-

tations. Following the tutorial requires that CompClust
and its Python prerequisites be installed. We created an
easy-to-use CompClustShell installer for Windows that
provides everything needed. For other operating systems
(e.g. Linux & OS X) we recommend that a software developer or system administrator help with the CompClust
source code installation. We are working to simplify
installation and plan to provide user-friendly installers for
other operating systems in the near future.

Methodology
We have developed the following algorithm for identifying and analyzing multiple independent sources of variance present within multi-dimensional sample datasets,
in particular those that are produced by gene microarray
expression experiments. The overall approach can be summarized as follows: 1) perform principal components
analysis of the dataset; for each principal component: 2)
identify the most extreme gene probes (those with the
highest or lowest weighting) for that principal component; 3) identify and group any conditions in which those
extreme probes vary significantly; 4) identify any condition covariates that correlate well with the condition
grouping. By extending the interpretation of each principal component from extreme genes (rows) to ordered
groups of significant conditions (columns) and further to
identifying statistically significant correlations with column covariates, we attempt to make full use of the available data, in an objective and data-driven way, to analyze

distributions having significant differences in either UPn vs. DOWNn, {UPn+FLATn} vs. DOWNn, or UPn vs. {FLATn+DOWNn} are shown

(out of 53) covariates were identified at a 1% significance level (minSetSize = 5) in 10 of the first 20 principal components. To investigate
further, corresponding plots of covariate value distributions within sample partitions can be generated, such as the covariate plots for
PC14 (see Figure 5).

and provide meaningful interpretations of the diverse
sources of variation present within the dataset.
Determine the principal components of the dataset
Our dataset D consists of nc columns (e.g. tissue samples
or conditions) and nr row vectors (e.g. gene probes), each
row vector xi ∈ ℜnc where i ∈ [1, nr]. Such a dataset is usually represented as a two-dimensional nr × nc matrix
(where nr > nc). The dataset may optionally have nk supplemental covariate annotations C associated with each
row or column. Each annotation Ck where k ∈ [1, nk] can
be either discrete (e.g. sex) or continuous (e.g. age), to permit the association of one discrete value per column (e.g.
values male or female), or one continuous value per column (e.g. values 12, 16, or 42).

Our procedure starts by employing principal components
analysis (PCA) to sequentially identify a series of new
basis vectors or axes PC1, PC2, ...PCnc in the high-dimensional column space ℜn that are each aligned sequentially
to capture the most as-yet unexplained variance. This is
accomplished by applying the numeric procedure singular value decomposition (SVD) to the covariance matrix of
D, cov(D), to produce the decomposition cov(D) = USVT
that contains the eigenvectors of cov(D) in the columns of
U and eigenvalues in the diagonal of S such that the eigenvalues are sorted by descending size. Each covariance
eigenvector, or principal component PC1, PC2, ...PCnc,
explains a fraction of the total variance contained in the
dataset, and each principal component PCn+1 is orthogonal to the previous principal component PCn. such that
they define the basis of a new vector space P. These results
are made available to the users in the form of nc plots, one
for each of the principal component vectors, as well as a

X

plot of the singular values contained in the diagonal of S
to indicate the relative amount of variance each component explains.
Identify extreme gene probes for each principal
component
Next, we project each data point xi (corresponding to a
gene probe, or row vector) into the new coordinate system
by P = DU, effectively rotating the entire data point set D
into the new principal component axes space, producing
the rotated data set P. Each data point pi in the rows of P
corresponding to xi has a coordinate for each principal
component axis that describes where the data point pi lies
when projected along each axis PC1, PC1, ...PCnc. For each
principal component PCn (n ∈ [1, nc]) we select a set of
data points from each end of that principal component
axis- these are the extreme points for PCn, called the principal component extreme genes, or PCEGs for convenience. The PCEGs can be identified and ranked in one of
two ways: by identifying points having a low probability
(p < = extremeThresh) of belonging to a Gaussian fit to the
distribution of points along the PCn axis, or by taking a
fixed number of nExtreme points at each tail of the distribution. Hn is the resulting set of data points having the
highest coordinate values for PCn, and Ln is the resulting
set of data points having the lowest coordinate values for
PCn. These high and low extreme gene point sets are
informative in and of themselves because they represent
the most extreme of the data points along a principal axis
of variation. As such, the high and low PCEG sets are some
of the primary outputs generated by our procedure. We
use the term "extreme" in a very general sense, in that the
points stand out because they are far from the main distribution. We do not mean to imply that such points are

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:194

either biologically relevant or nuisance data that should
be removed; rather we are interested in these points in an
unbiased way. By further analyzing their pattern of expression in the original axes we hope to gain a better understanding of their possible biologic significance.
Identify significant conditions for each principal
component
The extreme gene points comprising Hn are located near
one edge of the high-dimensional cloud of points, and
points Ln are near the opposite edge. Thus, points Hn are
likely to have coordinate values that are maximally different from points Ln in a subset of the original column space
coordinate system. Our procedure next seeks to identify in
which of the original columns (the original axes or
dimensions) we find the greatest difference of values for
points Hn versus points Ln. We do this by comparing distributions of values in Hnj versus Lnj for each of the original
columns j (j ∈ [1, nc]). A two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum
test is used to estimate the likelihood that these two sets
of values are drawn from the same distribution [39]; the
resulting p-values for each column are used to rank order
and group the columns, rather than as actual probabilities. Columns having a likelihood less than a user-defined
significance level test1Thresh are identified and placed into
one of two column sets: UPn for those where column j has
mean(Hnj) > mean(Lnj), and DOWNn for those columns j
where mean(Hnj) <mean(Lnj). Remaining columns that do
not show significant variation are placed in the column
set FLATn. The column sets are also meaningful outputs of
our procedure, as UPn and DOWNn describe the groups of
columns in which the extreme genes Hn and Ln vary significantly. Our procedure can output these columns and column sets in various orders simply as an aid to human
interpretation, including: original column order; grouped
by set and within set ordered by the Wilcoxon p-value significance; ordered by mean difference, mean(Hnj) –
mean(Lnj); or ordered by the eigenvector column loading.
Taken together, the PCEG point sets and significant column sets should provide valuable insight to researchers
wishing to interpret each of the sources of variation identified by the principal components procedure.
Interpret each principal component using covariate
annotations
When provided additional covariate annotations C, the
procedure seeks to determine which, if any of the annotations Ck are well correlated with the partitioning of columns into the sets {UPn, FLATn, DOWNn}. A discrete
annotation Ck containing m unique values V1, V2, ... Vm
also defines a partitioning of the columns {KV1, KV2, ...,
KVm} where KV1 is the set of columns that share the value
V1, KV2 are those that share value V2, and so on. An information theoretic measure known as normalized mutual
information (NMI) [28] describes the degree to which two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/194

discrete random variables share information. When there
is high mutual information, knowing the value of one of
the variables should be useful predictor of the other variable. (See [9] for a description of the merits of NMI in
terms of clustering and understanding the relationships
between clusterings.) We construct the 3 x m confusion
matrix to compare the {UPn, FLATn, DOWNn} column
partitioning with the {KV1, KV2, ..., KVm} partitioning and
calculate an NMI score between the partitionings. Because
the usual NMI score is not symmetric (i.e. NMI(r,c) ≠
NMI(c,r)), we use a variant that we refer to as the average
NMI score, which is simply the average of the NMI of the
confusion matrix and the NMI of the transpose of the confusion matrix. Those covariates Ck having an average NMI
greater than a user defined threshold nmiThresh are added
to the set of significant covariate annotations An.
We apply a different approach when evaluating the Ck that
are continuous covariates. We need to assess whether each
principal component's {UPn, FLATn, DOWNn} column
partitioning correlates with each Ck distribution of values.
We can separately score three different partitioning
schemes, UPn vs. DOWNn, {UPn+FLATn} vs. DOWNn, and
UPn vs.{FLATn+DOWNn}, by determining if Ck's value distributions differ significantly across the partition. E.g.
does Ck within UPn have a different distribution than Ck
within DOWNn? Next, does Ck within {UPn + FLATn} have
a different distribution than Ck within DOWNn? Finally,
does Ck within UPn have a different distribution than Ck
within {FLATn+DOWNn}? For each partition scheme we
again use a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, including
the small sample adjustments when sample size is less
than 10, to determine whether the covariate's value distributions on each side of the partitioning differ significantly
from each other. A minSetSize parameter can be specified
as desired to reduce false positives when set sizes are very
small, e.g. when comparing a distribution of 2 values vs.
7 values. Thus we calculate the Wilcoxon p-value for three
partitionings of columns: UPn vs. DOWNn, {UPn+FLATn}
vs. DOWNn, and UPn vs. {FLATn+DOWNn}. Those covariates having a p-value less than the user defined threshold
test2Thresh for any of the three partitionings are added to
the set of significant covariate annotations An.
Upon completion of the covariate analysis, covariates in
the set An, that previously met user-controlled significance
thresholds are reported by the software. Covariate reports
provide the following information: For discrete-valued
covariates, corresponding confusion matrices and average
NMI scores are reported; for continuous-valued covariates, the three Wilcoxon p-values are reported together
with supporting plots illustrating the covariate distributions. There is no guarantee that any covariates will be significantly related to a principal component. Conversely,
spurious relationships might be reported, especially in the

Page 19 of 22

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:194

case of small numbers of samples due to small column
partitions. The tool simply points to those covariates
related to a principal component that also satisfy a usercontrolled significance threshold. It is up to the investigator to consider these hypotheses and to confirm the interesting ones through further investigation.
Terminating condition
We have shown that some large-scale expression datasets
have biologically pertinent structure that is revealed by
deep PC analysis that goes well beyond the first few principal components. However there are limits to the depth
of mining and these limits depend on both size and character of the dataset. In all cases, the last principal component is not free to seek a source of variation because it
must be orthogonal to all prior nc-1 components. To
some degree that is also true of some portion of latter
principal components that explain ever-diminishing fractions of the variance. We suggest that a natural terminating condition exists: When a principal component cannot
find any columns in which the extreme gene sets show significant differences, there is no need to proceed to subsequent principal components. We observe that this
condition is often not met because the extreme genes are
typically differentially expressed in at least a few of the
original columns (the original axes or dimensions), even
for the most minor principal components. We also
observe that variants of a dataset (e.g. representative column subsets) can affect the relative ordering, but not the
existence, of multiple factors or sources of variation that
are reflected in the minor principal component regime.
We may therefore choose to investigate all principal components, but do so with the expectation that minor principal components will describe increasingly subtle sources
of variation, which can, and often do, include noisy processes inherent in the data source.
