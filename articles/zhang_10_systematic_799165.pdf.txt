Systematic analysis, comparison, and integration
of disease based human genetic association data
and mouse genetic phenotypic information

Abstract
Background: The genetic contributions to human common disorders and mouse genetic models of disease are
complex and often overlapping. In common human diseases, unlike classical Mendelian disorders, genetic factors
generally have small effect sizes, are multifactorial, and are highly pleiotropic. Likewise, mouse genetic models of
disease often have pleiotropic and overlapping phenotypes. Moreover, phenotypic descriptions in the literature in
both human and mouse are often poorly characterized and difficult to compare directly.
Methods: In this report, human genetic association results from the literature are summarized with regard to
replication, disease phenotype, and gene specific results; and organized in the context of a systematic disease
ontology. Similarly summarized mouse genetic disease models are organized within the Mammalian Phenotype
ontology. Human and mouse disease and phenotype based gene sets are identified. These disease gene sets are
then compared individually and in large groups through dendrogram analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis.
Results: Human disease and mouse phenotype gene sets are shown to group into disease and phenotypically
relevant groups at both a coarse and fine level based on gene sharing.
Conclusion: This analysis provides a systematic and global perspective on the genetics of common human disease
as compared to itself and in the context of mouse genetic models of disease.

Background
Common complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune disorders; metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity, as well as
neurological and psychiatric disorders make up a majority of health morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The specific genetic contributions to disease
etiology and relationships to environmental factors in
common disorders are unclear; complicated by many
factors such as gene-gene interactions, the balance
between susceptibility and protective alleles, copy number variation, low relative risk contributed by each gene,
and a myriad of complex environmental inputs.
Genetic association studies using a candidate gene
approach and more recently whole genome association
studies (GWAS) have produced a large and rapidly

increasing amount of information on the genetics of
common disease. In parallel, mouse genetic models for
human disease have provided a wealth of genetic and
phenotypic information. While not always perfect models for human common complex disorders, the genetic
purity and experimental flexibility of mouse disease
models have produced valuable insights relevant to
human disease.
Gene nomenclature standardization[1], database
efforts [2-4], and phenotype ontology projects[5] in both
human and mouse over the past decade have provided
the foundation for integration of information on genetic
contributions to disease and phenotypes. This allows the
opportunity for systematic comparison and higher order
systems analysis of disease and phenotypic information.
In this report, we summarize and integrate large scale
information on human genetic association information
and mouse genetically determined phenotypic information with the goal of identifying fundamental

relationships in human disease and mouse models of
human disease.

Methods
The Genetic Association Database

The Genetic Association Database [2] (GAD) http://
geneticassociationdb.nih.gov is an archive of summary
data of published human genetic association studies of
many common disease types. GAD is primarily focused
on archiving information on common complex human
disease rather than rare Mendelian disorders as found in
the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)[6].
GAD contains curated information on candidate gene
studies and more recently on genome wide association
studies. It builds on the curation of the CDC HuGENet
info literature database [3] in part by adding molecular
and ontological annotation creating a bridge between
epidemiological and molecular information. This allows
the large-scale integration of disease based genetic association information with genomic and molecular information as well as with the software tools and
computational approaches and that use genomic information [7-12]. This report is a summary and analysis of
the genes and diseases with positive associations in the
Genetic Association Database with regard to replication,
comparisons between diseases, and within broad phenotypic disease classes. Although GAD contains information on gene variation, this report is at the gene level
only and does not consider specific gene variation or
genetic polymorphism.
The Genetic Association Database (GAD) currently
contains approximately 40,000 individual gene records of
genetic association studies taken from over 23,000 independent publications. Importantly, a large number
(11,568) of the records in GAD have a designation of
whether the gene of record was reported to be associated
(Y) or was not (N) associated with the disease phenotype
for that specific record. Many records, for various reasons, do not have such a designation. In addition, a portion of the database records have been annotated with
standardized disease phenotype keywords from the
MeSH http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/ vocabulary. The
GAD summations shown below are a subset of the
records in GAD. They only include those records that are
both; a) positively associated with a disease phenotype,
and b) have a MeSH disease phenotype annotation. This
represents a subset of 10,324 records having both positive
associations to disease and records with MeSH annotations. Records designated as not associated (N) with a
disease phenotype and those without MeSH disease
annotation are not considered at this time in this report.
Mouse phenotypic database

The mouse phenotypic information described here was
obtained from the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)

Page 2 of 22

database [4]http://www.informatics.jax.org/ Phenotypes,
Alleles and Disease Models section. The file used for
mouse phenotypic information (see methods) is comprised of 5011 unique genes and 5142 unique phenotypic terms derived from information from specific gene
mutations in multiple mouse strains. The mouse phenotypic information had been annotated to the mouse
gene mutation records using Mammalian Phenotype
terms and codes in the mouse phenotype database as a
component of the Mouse Phenotyping Project [5,13].
Quantitation of genes and disease phenotypes

Quantitation of how often a disease phenotype was positively associated with a gene was performed as follows.
GAD records having both recorded positive associations
and annotated MeSH disease keywords were extracted
and stored in a database according to their relationships.
Using a perl script, the number of times of co-occurrence of a MeSH disease keyword was positively associated with a specific gene was recorded as found in the
GAD database. These counts were sorted in declining
order for each unique gene grouped by the disease
MeSH term with which they are associated.
Mouse phenotypic information

The mouse phenotypic information described here was
obtained from the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)
http://www.informatics.jax.org/; Phenotypes, Alleles and
Disease Models section; ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/
reports/index.html#pheno
Using these three files downloaded on 4-4-2008ftp://
ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MPheno_OBO.ontologyftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MGI_PhenotypicAllele.rptftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/
MGI_PhenoGenoMP.rpt
The mouse phenotype files were extracted using a perl
script annotating each gene with the phenotype term
associated with each Mammalian Phenotype (MP) code.
Venn Diagram overlap of individual gene lists

Individual GAD primary gene sets were analyzed using
Venny[14]http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.
html. Pathway Venn Diagram comparisons were performed by placing individual GAD primary gene sets
into WebGestalt [15]http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/ to identify KEGG pathways, then placing the
resulting pathway names into Venny.
Dendrogram analysis of gene sets

Relationships between diseases were identified by a
unique method similar to phyologenetic classification.
First the distance between the diseases were calculated
by pairwise comparison of the diseases by finding the
common genes between the pairs and dividing it by the
smallest group of the pair. This number was then subtracted from 1. This step was done because if two lists
are identical (100% match) then the resultant distance
should be 0. This is represented in the formula:

Zhang et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/3/1

d i, j  1 

N(C i C j )
min[N(C i ), N(C j )]

when i  j. If i  j then d  0

Where: Ck: Genes in each disease set (where k = i, j);
N(Ck): Number of genes in each disease set (where k =
i, j); dij is the pairwise distance; i, j: index of genes in
each disease set where; i = 1, 2, 3, ........., n; j = 1, 2, 3,
........., m
The disease relationships were calculated from the distance matrix using the Fitch program from the Phylip
package[16]. It calculates the relationships based on the
Fitch and Margoliash method of constructing the phylogenetic trees[17] using the following formula (from the
Phylip manual):
Sum _ of _ squares 


i

j

n ij (D ij  d ij ) 2
P
D ij

where D is the observed distance between gene sets i
and j and d is the expected distance, computed as the
sum of the lengths of the segments of the tree from gene
set i to gene set j. The quantity n is the number of times
each distance has been replicated. In simple cases n is
taken to be one. If n is chosen more than 1, the distance
is then assumed to be a mean of those replicates. The
power P is what distinguished between the Fitch and
Neighbor-Joining methods. For the Fitch-Margoliash
method P is 2.0 and for Neighbor-Joining method it is
0.0. As running Fitch took a long time when the gene-set
size was huge (weeks for the human gene-sets and
months for the mouse gene-sets), Neighbor-Joining
method was used to create the replicate dendrograms
(not shown) after randomizing the input order for greater
confidence. The resulting coefficient matrix files were
displayed using the Phylodraw graphics program[18].
Hierarchical clustering of gene sets

Ward’s minimum variance method[19] was used to find
the distance between two diseases. The distance between
the clusters is the ANOVA sum of squares between the
two clusters added up over all the variables. At each
generation, the within-cluster sum of squares is minimized over all partitions obtainable by merging two
clusters from the previous generation. Ward’s method
joins clusters to maximize the likelihood at each level of
the hierarchy under the assumptions of multivariate
normal mixtures, spherical covariance matrices, and
equal sampling probabilities. Distance for Ward’s
method is: D KL 

|x K  x L |2

where NK is the number of observations in CK (which is
the Kth cluster, subset of {1, 2, ..., n) where n is the

number of observations). x k is the mean vector for
cluster CK.

Results
Each record in GAD represents a specific gene from a
unique publication of a human population based genetic
association study and is categorized into one of 24 general disease classes corresponding to broad MeSH disease or disease phenotypic groupings. Table 1 is a
summary of the number of positively associated human
genes in each MeSH human disease class. As represented by these disease classes the GAD database covers
a broad selection of diseases falling into major disease
classes including; aging studies, cancer, immune disorders, psychiatric diseases, metabolic conditions, pharmacogenomic studies, and studies of chemical dependency,
among others. Similarly, each record in the phenotype
files from the MGI phenotype database represents a
unique mouse gene specific genetic model. Table 2
shows the general categories represented by the mouse
phenotype summary files and the number of mouse
genes found in each top level phenotype class. The
mouse files contain a greater number of intermediate
developmental and morphological phenotypes (e.g. insulin resistance, absent CD4+ T cells, abnormal spatial
learning) while the human files tend to comprise a
greater number of end stage clinical disease phenotypes
(e.g. Type 2 Diabetes, multiple sclerosis, autism).
Table 3 introduces examples of human genes from
fundamental biological pathways that have been consistently associated with major disease phenotypes highlighting the sometimes-broad pleiotropic effects that
major regulatory molecules have on multiple disease
phenotypes. Genes such as NOS3, nitric oxide synthase
3, regulating nitrous oxide production; HLA-DQB1, the
MHC class II molecule DQ beta 1, involved in antigen
presentation; ACE, angiotensin I converting enzyme,
central to the renin-angiotensin system and PPARG,
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, regulating transcription in pathways important in lipid metabolism are examples of genes that affect multiple tissues
and different organ systems through the complex course
of disease progression. Importantly, all the mouse orthologs of the human genes in Table 3 have experimentally
determined phenotypes that are similar or broadly overlapping with human clinical disease phenotypes (see
below).
Summaries of genes and phenotypes in human and
mouse

The majority of this report is built upon large nonredundant general summary lists for both human and
mouse, shown below. These lists take two complimentary forms in both human and mouse. The first sets are

GENE-to-Disease/Phenotype lists. These are non-redundant lists of genes showing the diseases or phenotypes
that have been associated with each gene (Table 4
human, table 5 mouse, and table 6 human-mouse). The
second sets of basic lists are DISEASE/PHENOTYPE-toGene lists. These are non redundant lists of diseases or
phenotypes with the genes that have been associated
with that disease or phenotype (Table 7 human and
table 8 mouse).
Human

Table 4 shows examples of selected genes in each row
that have been positively associated with specific disease
phenotype keywords. Each human gene symbol is followed by a specific MeSH disease term and the number
of times that gene has been positively associated with
the term, in declining order. A major feature of Table 4
is that individual genes have been positively associated
with sometimes overlapping disease phenotypes over a
broad range from more frequently to less frequently.
Table 4 is a small representative subset, truncated in the
number of genes (rows) and the number of MeSH
terms (columns). The complete list of 1,584 human
genes with additional information can be found in Table
S1a [20]. An interactive version of the same list can be
found in Table S1b[21].

Quite often the resulting list of phenotypes associated
with a specific gene may include the major disease phenotype followed by specific sub-phenotypes of the disease
that contribute distinct aspects to the overall clinical disease phenotype. For example, IL13 has been associated
with asthma at least 11 times as well as to the asthma
sub-phenotype immediate hypersensitivity 4 times. Similarly, the gene CFH has been associated with macular
degeneration at least 19 times, as well as to the endophenotype of macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization 3 times. Although replication in genetic association studies has been widely debated[22], consistent
replication by independent groups, although sometimes
with both modest risk and significance values[23], suggests a fundamental measure of scientific validity. This is
true for both candidate gene as well as GWAS studies.
In other cases, individual genes have been associated
with independent but related disorders that may share
fundamental biological pathways in disease etiology, such
as HLA-DQB1, CTLA4, and PTPN22 as in the case of
autoimmune disorders. This gene overlap emphasizes the
fundamental, often step-wise biochemical role each gene
plays in shared disease etiology [24-27]. That is, HLADQB1 in antigen presentation, CTLA4 in regulation of
the expansion of T cell subsets, and PTPN22 in T cell
receptor signaling, all contributing to immunological

phenotype table of genes with mouse phenotype ontological codes ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/
index.html#pheno, downloaded on 4-4-08. To build
tables 5 and S2, the matching phenotypic terms were
exchanged for each Mammalian Phenotype code (MP:#).
This resulted in the mouse GENE-to-Disease/Phenotype
tables (tables 5 and S2) similar in structure to human
GENE-to-Disease/Phenotype tables (tables 4 and S1).
Unlike the human tables, the mouse GENE-to-Disease/
Phenotype tables come from individual mouse experimental knockout or other genetic studies. They are not
based on population based epidemiological studies. They
also do not have the quantitative aspect of the human
tables with publication frequency counts tagged to each
record. In addition, although they include a wide variety
of physiological, neurological, and behavioral phenotypes,
they do emphasize developmental studies and observational morphological phenotypes common in mouse
knockout studies. Table 5 is a small representative subset,
truncated in the number of genes (rows) and the number
of Phenotype terms (columns). The complete list of 5011
mouse genes with annotated phenotypes and additional
information can be found in Table S2a[30]. An interactive version of the same list can be found in Table S2b
[31].

We can now compare these tables directly, thereby
allowing gene-by-gene comparison of human disease
phenotypes and mouse genetic phenotypes. Tables 6
and S3 are comparisons of the genes that overlap
between the human and mouse gene lists (Table S1 and
Table S2) showing mouse gene symbols and their
human orthologs. Table 6 is a small subset of selected
gene-phenotype cross species comparisons. Even though
in some cases the human studies have not been replicated, there is often a striking concordance between
human disease phenotypes and mouse genetically determined phenotypes. For example, the human gene inhibin alpha (INHA) has been associated with premature
ovarian failure[32], and shows mouse phenotypes of
abnormal ovarian follicle morphology, female infertility,
and ovarian hemorrhage[33], among other phenotypes
relevant to human disease. Similarly, in humans the
engrailed homeobox 2 gene (EN2) has been associated
with autistic disorder[34] while the comparison to
mouse En2 has genetic mutations involved in abnormal
social integration, spatial learning, and social/consecutive interaction, among others[35]. Importantly, the few
mouse studies highlighted above, and many found in the
main table S3, were published after the corresponding
human genetic population based epidemiological studies.
Given concerns of false positives and publication bias in
human genetic association studies, direct comparisons

associated with quite different clinical phenotypes, suggesting sharing of complex biological mechanisms at a
more underlying level. For example, the gene CFTR,
widely recognized as the cause of cystic fibrosis, has been
consistently associated with pancreatitis, may be implicated in chronic rhinitis [28], and may play a protective
role in gastrointestinal disorders [29].

to related mouse phenotypes may provide supporting
evidence that a given gene may be relevant to a specific
human disease phenotype. Table S3[36] is a full listing
of the 1104 shared genes between the human disease
and mouse phenotype summaries.
Summaries of phenotypes and genes in human and
mouse

The second type of main summary tables are DISEASE/
PHENOTYPE-to-Gene lists. Disease/Phenotype gene
summaries are essentially transposed versions of the
GENE-to-Disease/Phenotype summaries (Tables S1 &
S2) that allow different types of comparisons. These are
non-redundant lists of phenotype keywords, MeSH disease terms in the case of human and Mammalian Phenotype Terms (MP) in the case of mouse, followed by
the genes associated or annotated to those disease phenotype keywords.
Human

Table 7 shows examples of selected human disease phenotypes in each row positively associated with specific
human genes for 8 major MeSH disease classes

including cardiovascular, digestive system diseases, diseases of environmental origin, immune system diseases,
mental disorders, nervous system diseases, nutritional
and metabolic diseases, and eye diseases. Each Mesh
phenotype term is followed by the number of times that
a specific disease term has been positively associated
with a particular gene in each row, in decreasing order.
Table 7 is a small representative set, truncated in the
number of disease phenotypes (rows) and the number of

gene tables 7 and S4, the mouse tables 8 and S5 do not
have quantitative information. Table 8 is also a small
representative set, truncated in the number of disease
phenotypes (rows) and the number of genes (columns).
The complete list of 5,142 mouse phenotype terms with
their corresponding Mammalian PhenoCode designations can be found in Table S5a[39]. An interactive version of the complete list can be found in Table S5b[40].
Using disease and gene lists

The purpose of this project is not simply to generate
lists and information. It is to provide a distillation of
disease and phenotype information that can be used in
dissecting the complexities of human disease and mouse
biology. Now that we have generated GENE-to-disease/
phenotype summaries and DISEASE/PHENOTYPE-togene summaries for both mouse and human, they can
be used for systematic analysis, comparison, and integrating of orthologous data with the goal of providing
higher order interpretations of human disease and
mouse genetically determined phenotypes.
Human disease and mouse phenotype based gene sets

Gene sets have been defined simply as groups of genes
that share common biological function, chromosomal
location, or regulation[41]. Gene sets are used in highthroughput systematic analysis of microarray data using
a priori knowledge. Unlike previously defined gene sets

based on biological pathways or differentially expressed
genes[41], GAD disease gene sets are unique in that
they are composed of genes that have been previously
shown to be both polymorphic and have been determined to be genetically positively associated with a specific disease phenotype in a human population based
genetic association study. Similarly, Table S5a[39] the
mouse DISEASE/PHENOTYPE-to-Gene list is used as a
source for gene sets for mouse phenotypes (MP gene
sets) comprised of unique gene based mouse genetic
models. These gene set files are currently the largest set
of gene set files publicly available and the only gene sets
files where each gene is based on direct human or
mouse genetic studies.
Comparison of individual GAD disease gene sets

One aspect of common complex disease is that the development of disease and disease phenotypes quite often
present along a broad spectrum of symptoms and share
clinical characteristics, endo-phenotypes, or quantitative
traits with closely related disorders [25]. This is evident
in gene sharing, as mentioned above, and equally in the
overlap of biological pathways between related disorders.
Using GAD disease gene sets, Venn diagram comparisons
among related disorders shows modest gene sharing.
However, when gene sets are then placed into biological
pathways and compared by Venn analysis, there is a

marked increase in the overlap in pathways between
related disorders. This was not found in gene sets from
unrelated disorders. For example, major autoimmune disorders quite often share endophenotypes of lymphoproliferation, autoantibody production, and alterations in
apoptosis, as well as other immune cellular and biochemical aberrations. As shown in Figure 1a, genes that have
been positively associated with type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn’s disease show a modest overlap.
However, when individual gene sets are fitted into biological pathways, then compared for overlap of pathway
membership, there is a striking increase in the overlap at
the pathway level. This is true in a comparison of gene
and pathways for type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and
obesity as well (Figure 1b). This pattern of major pathway
overlap does not seem to occur between unrelated disorders, such as insulin resistance, rheumatoid arthritis and
bipolar disorder (Figure 1c). This disease related sharing
at the pathway level suggests common regulatory
mechanisms between these disorders and that the original positive associations are not necessarily due to random chance alone.

Group analysis of GAD disease gene sets between major
classes of disease/phenotypes

Dendrogram analysis of human disease gene sets
As archival information grows, analysis of complex
molecular and genetic datasets using clustering or network approaches has become increasingly more useful
[13,42-45]. Therefore, in addition to comparisons
between individual diseases using human and mouse
gene sets, we analyzed large gene groups using dendrogram and clustering approaches based on gene sharing
between gene sets. Figure 2 shows a broad based dendrogram comparison based on gene sharing between
480 GAD disease gene sets, using gene sets each containing at least 3 genes. A striking feature of this analysis is that at a coarse level, major disease groups cluster
together in space demonstrating shared genes between
major clinically important disease groups. Disease
domains are represented by groups such as cardiovascular disorders, metabolic disorders, cancer, immune and
inflammatory disorders, vision, and chemical dependency. At finer detail within a specific broader group, it
becomes clear that individual diseases with overlapping

phenotypes are found close in space, such as asthma,
allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. This overlap due
to gene sharing recapitulates an overlap in clinical characteristics between these related disorders. Similarly,
phenotypes within the metabolic group related to diabetes are closely aligned in space including; insulin resistance,
hyperglycemia,
hyperinsulinemia,
and
hyperlipidemia. This close apposition of related disease
phenotypes and sub-phenotypes at both a coarse and
fine level is a consistent feature of the overall display.
The human gene sets used in creating this tree diagram
can be found in Table S6[46]. It is important to emphasize that this display and the distance relationships
between diseases are calculated through an unbiased
gene-sharing algorithm independent of disease phenotype labels and not as a result of an imposed logical
hierarchy or an ontological annotation system. This
grouping of major disease phenotypes based solely on
gene sharing provides supporting evidence that the
underlying disease based gene sets may have a fundamental relevance to disease and may not be reported in
the literature by chance alone.
Dendrogram analysis of mouse phenotypic gene sets
Figure 3 is a similar dendrogram to the human tree
using 1056 mouse phenotypic gene sets, using gene sets
each containing at least 10 genes. This was produced
using the same gene sharing algorithm as for the human
gene sets in Figure 2. As with the human dendrogram,
the mouse tree displays informative groupings at both a
coarse and fine level. This tree groups into major groupings nominally assigned as brain development and brain
function, embryonic development, cardiovascular, reproduction, inflammation, renal function, bone development, metabolism, and skin/hair development. The
identification of major groupings emphasizing developmental processes reflects the emphasis of gene knockouts and developmental models resulting in observable
morphological traits and less so with regard to end
stage clinical diseases as in the human dendrogram. Like
the human dendrogram (Figure 2) discrete major functional groupings in the mouse dendrogram suggests that
individual experimental observations are not random.
Fundamental complex processes such as metabolism,
cardiovascular phenomena, and developmental processes
are integrated by extensive sharing of related pliotropic
genes. Moreover, like the human tree, fine structure in
the mouse tree shows related mouse phenotypes are closely positioned in space. For example, in the metabolism
major grouping, the individual phenotypes of body
mass, adipose phenotypes, and weight gain are closely
positioned. Similarly, in the brain function group, the
behavioral phenotypes of anxiety, exploration, and
responses to novel objects are found next to one
another. This pattern is a fundamental feature of this

Page 17 of 22

tree. Like the human tree, the mouse dendrogram
shown here is based solely on a gene sharing algorithm
using genes assigned to individual phenotypes. It is not
based on an imposed predetermined hierarchy or ontology. Importantly, unlike the human tree, the information
contained in the mouse tree is derived from individual
independent mouse genetic studies and phenotypic
observations and not from large case controlled population based epidemiological studies. Controversial issues
such as publication bias or study size which confound
human genetic association studies are not as relevant
here in the context of studies of experimentally determined individual mouse gene knockouts and related studies. The mouse gene sets used in creating this tree
diagram can be found in Table S7[47].
Hierarchical clustering of human and mouse gene sets
Hierarchical clustering has become a common tool in
the analysis of large molecular data sets[48] allowing
identification of similar patterns in a scalable fashion
from the whole experiment down to a level of fine
structure. To provide further evidence of disease relevance and biological content contained in both the
human and mouse gene sets hierarchical clustering
was performed on both human and mouse. Four hundred and eighty human gene sets were clustered producing 46 major disease clusters. In the mouse,
clustering was performed on 2067 mouse phenotype
gene sets, using gene sets containing at least 3 genes.
This resulted in 165 major subgroups of functional
phenotypic specificity. Hierarchical clustering is shown
for human [Additional file 1 and Additional file 2] and
for mouse [Additional file 3 and Additional file 4].
Like the human and mouse dendograms, this hierarchical clustering showed functional disease grouping at
both a coarse group level and at a fine level within
major phenotypic groupings. These clusters in both
human and mouse falling into closely defined broad
functional groups as well as closely related clinical,
physiological, and developmental phenotypes demonstrates a general pattern of relevance to disease in
their original underlying genetic associations. As in the
dendrogram displays, this suggests that the genes nominally positively associated to these disorders, drawn
from the medical literature, are not pervasively randomly assigned or due to a widespread pattern of random false positives associations.

Discussion and Conclusion
This report describes a summary of the positive genetic
associations to disease phenotypes found in the Genetic
Association Database as well as a summary of mouse
genetically determined phenotypes from the MGI phenotypes database. The genes and disease lists described
here were derived from a broad literature mining

approach. We have shown disease relevance in three
distinct ways; a) in comparing individual gene lists and
pathways, b) comparing between species and, c) in
broad based comparative analysis utilizing complex systems approaches. Moreover, we identify disease based
genes sets for 1,317 human disease phenotypes as well
as 5,142 mouse experimentally determined phenotypes.
These resources are the largest gene set files currently
publicly available and the only gene set files derived
from population based human epidemiological genetic
studies and mouse genetic models of disease.

Each individual GAD disease gene set (i.e. a single disease term followed by a string of genes) or mouse phenotype gene set becomes a candidate for a number of
uses and applications including:
a) contributing to complex (additive, multiplicative,
gene-environment) statistical models for any given disease phenotype [49-53]; b) use in comparative analysis
of disease between disease phenotypes; c) use in interrogating other related data types, such as microarray (see
below), proteomic, or SNP data [54-56]; and d) integration into annotation engines[57] or genome browsers

[58] or other analytical software to add disease information in comparative genomic analysis. In a sense, each
individual human or mouse disease/phenotype gene set
becomes a unique hypothesis, testable in a variety of
ways. Increasingly, combinations of genes may have
important predictive value as combinatorial biomarkers
in predicting disease risk as opposed to single candidate
genes [59,60].
In addition, in an ongoing parallel set of experiments,
using a Gene Set Analysis (GSA) approach using the
web tool Disease/Phenotype web-PAGE, in the analysis
of orthologous microarray data (De S, Zhang Y, Garner
JR, Wang SA, Becker KG: Disease and phenotype gene
set analysis of disease based gene expression, unpublished), both the human and mouse disease/phenotype
gene sets defined above demonstrate striking disease
specificity in PAGE[61] gene set analysis of previously
published microarray based gene expression studies
from numerous independent laboratories in both a species specific and cross species manner. This was true
when studying gene expression studies of type 2 diabetes, obesity, myocardial infarction and sepsis, among
others, providing further evidence of the disease and
clinical relevance of both the human and mouse gene
sets.
This approach is limited in a number of ways. In particular, the GAD database compares the results of
human population based epidemiological studies performed using different sample sizes, populations, statistical models, and at different times over approximately
the last 16 years. In addition, the GAD database draws
on association studies of broad quality with different
degrees of detail provided. Although all human genetic
association studies discussed here have been individually
determined to be positively associated with a disease or
phenotype in a peer reviewed journal, we make no
assertion that any individual study is correct and we
recognize the controversy in the genetics community
regarding statistical and biological significance of genetic
association studies. Moreover, although the GAD database contains information on polymorphism and variation, and each GAD record is fundamentally based on
polymorphism, this report does not consider variation
or polymorphism in the summaries shown. Likewise,
mouse genetic models in many cases are weighted to
gene knockouts which may not be necessarily be directly
representative of multifactorial human common complex disease.
However, even with these limitations, we believe valuable insights can be gained from broad based literature
assessments of the genetic contribution in human common complex disease and in mouse phenotypic biology.
More importantly, this suggests greater opportunities
for systematic mining and analysis of published data and

in cross comparison of archival molecular databases in
both human and animal models of disease with regard
to genetic variation, population comparisons, and integration with many different types of orthologous
information.
