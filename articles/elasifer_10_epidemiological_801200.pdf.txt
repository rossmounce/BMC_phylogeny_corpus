Abstract
Background: The information on hepatitis C virus genotypes and subtypes among Libyan population and its
association with various risk factors is not known. The objectives of this study were to determine the
epidemiological manifestations of HCV genotypes among Libyan patients and their association with certain
potential risk factors.
Methods: A total of 1240 of HCV infected patients registered at Tripoli Medical Centre were studied in five years
period from January 2005 to October 2009. The information were reviewed and the data were collected. A sample
from each patient (785 male; 455 female) was analysed for genotyping and sub-typing using specific genotyping
assay. The information was correlated with the risk factors studied and the statistical data were analyzed using
SPSS version 11.5.
Results: Off the total patients studied, four different genotypes were reported, including genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Genotype4 was the commonest (35.7%), followed by genotype1 (32.6%). According to subtypes 28% were
unclassified genotype 4, 14.6% were genotype 1b and some patients infected with more than one subtype (2.3%
genotype 4c/d, 1% genotype 2a/c). Genotypes 1 was the commonest among males, while genotype 4 among
females. According to the risk factors studied, Genotype1 and genotype 4 were found with most of the risk factors.
Though they were particularly evident surgical intervention, dental procedures and blood transfusion while
genotype 1 was only followed by genotype 3 mainly which mainly associated with certain risk groups such as
intravenous drug abusers.
Conclusion: Here in we report on a detailed description of HCV genotype among Libyans. The most common
genotype was type 4 followed by genotype 1, other genotypes were also reported at a low rate. The distribution
of such genotypes were also variable according to gender and age. The commonly prevalent genotypes found to
be attributable to the medical -related transmission of HCV, such as blood, surgery and dental procedures when
compared with other risk factors. This however, raises an alarming signal on the major steps to be taken to reduce
such infection in Libya

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major public health problem and it is one of the most important causes of
chronic liver diseases all over the world. Studying the
epidemiology of such problematic virus plays an important role on the methods of its prevention [1-4]. Such
epidemiology varies geographically and temporally due

to distribution and evolution of risk factors. In Europe
and North America the prevalence of HCV is about 1%
[5,6]. Though it was higher among southern Italy and
Southern Spain as it varied between 8.4%-22.4%. In
North Africa and Arabian countries such prevalence was
between 1.4% and 2.1% in certain countries such Libya,
Tunis and Saudi Arabia, though it was the highest in
Egypt as it reached up to 19.3% [7,8]. Furthermore the
epidemiology of HCV was highly associated with a certain risk groups such as: blood and blood products,
Intravenous drug abusers (IVDA), sexual transmission,

inadequate sterilizing medical equipment, body piercing
and sharing razors and other personal items which contaminated with HCV [9].
Hepatitis C virus has been characterized by having a
higher rate of spontaneous mutation that leads to a
marked degree of heterogeneity among its genotypes
[10]. The genus hepacivirus consists of six phylogentically
distinct clades (genotypes) from1 to 6 and more than 70
subtypes (termed a, b, c, d,.etc...) of HCV [10,11]. The
epidemiology of such genotypes has been to be variable
among different geographical regions worldwide. However HCV genotypes 1,2 and 3 are commonly distributed
all over the world though 4,5, and 6 were mainly found
in a certain areas. HCV genotype 4 particularly prevalent
in Northern and Central African counties particularly
Egypt, whereas HCV genotype 2 is frequent in West
Africans countries. Where genotypes (5) and (6) are common in South Africa and Asia respectively [12]. The heterogeneity of HCV genotypes also plays a role in
understanding the epidemiology among different risk
population. HCV genotype 3a was found to be associated
with drug addicts and genotype 1b in blood transfusion.
Furthermore a single subtype was found to be associated
with certain areas such as genotype 4a in Egypt and genotype 5a in South Africa [13].
A few studies on the epidemiology of HCV among
Libyans were reported. These include the seroprevalence HCV among different risk groups including
health care workers, blood donors, renal dialysis patients
and multi blood transfused patients [14], but the HCV
genotype distribution remains to be determined. Hence
then epidemiological studies of HCV genotypes among
Libyans may provide a good understanding on the nature of HCV infection and its spread. The objectives of
this study were to determine the epidemiology of HCV
genotypes among different Libyan patients and its association with the risk factors involved and how this could
be reflected on the prevention of such virus among the
Libyan society.

Methods
Patient population

A total of 1240 patients with hepatitis C virus were Studied. They were recruited from the Department of
Infectious Diseases at Tripoli Medical Centre, Tripoli.
The participation was voluntary in accordance of with
the guidelines for observational and interventional studies from ethical committees of our National ethical
Standards as the research was conducted according to
Helsinki Declaration (2000) [15].
The patients were registered and followed up at Out
Patient Department from January 2005 to October 2009.
Seven hundred and eighty five patients studied were
male and 455 patients were female. Their age ranged

Page 2 of 7

from16 to 84 years with an average age of 45 years. The
study was designed to collect the data and extract information from each patient including age, gender, year of
diagnosis and risk factors for HCV such as history of
blood transfusion, intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), history of surgical intervention, family history of HCV
positive and history of promiscuity and dental procedure. Those patients who denied any risk factors were
assigned to be as an; unknown group.
Patient Selection Criterion

The study was designed to investigate the impact of
HCV genotypes on the epidemiological manifestations
of HCV infection among Libyan patients. Each patient
has to fulfil the following criteria; no co-infection with
human immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus or
with hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis D Viruses, and non
of them had liver cirrhosis, or undergo haemodialysis.;
and no concomitant metabolic or autoimmune disorder
or underlying systemic diseases all patients enrolled in
this study were restrictedly chosen to fulfil the criteria
mentioned.
Laboratory and Clinical Evaluation of HCV Infection

A serum specimen was collected from each patient and
was tested positive for HCV antibody (Anti-HCV) using
and 3rd generation commercial Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assays (ELISA)[The INNO-LIA™ HCV Ab
III update (Belgium) is 3ed generation line immunoassay
which incorporates HCV antigens derived from the core
region, the E2 hypervariable region, the NS3 helicase
region, the NS4A, and NS5A regions. The antigens were
coated as 6 discrete lines on a nylon strip with plastic
backing. In addition, four control lines are coated in
each strip: strepavidin control, 3+ Positive Control (antihuman Ig), 1+ Positive Control (human IgG) and ±
cutoff line (human IgG). The stirp incubated with test
sample then we add purified alkaline phosphatase labelled goat anti -human IgG last we add conjugate].
Such immunoassay was known to have a high specificity
and sensitivity (over 99%), with minimal or no limitation
of detecting HCV antibody.
Determination of HC Viral Genotypes

HCV genotyping was performed by gene amplification
using COBAS-Amblicor HCV test { this test detected by
reverse-transcribing HCV RNA into cDNA by PCR,
hybridizing amplified cDNA with an oligonucleotid
probe that binds enzyme, and catalyzing conversion of
substrate to a colored product that is recognized by
COBAS AMBLICOR Analyzer (Roche, Diagnostic, Basal,
Switzerland). Such analysis is in worldwide use and it
covers all the six internationally recognized HCV
genotypes.

Statistical Analysis

Quantitative variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (X ± SD)and were compared by Student’s
test (t-test). Differences in proportion of qualitative variables were tested with non-parametric tests (X2) Yates
correlation. Fisher exact test and a p value < 0.05 were
considered significant. A multivariate analysis was conducted using logistic regression in order to verify which
variables statistically had an influence on HCV infection.
such as gender (male vs. female), IV drug abuser (yes or
no), blood transfusion (yes or no) surgical Intervention
and blood transfusion (yes or no), dental care (yes or
no); promiscuity (yes or no). The data were analyzed
using SPSS version 11.5 to identify the distribution of
different genotypes and its association with gender, age,
year of diagnosis and risk factors.

Results
Prevalence of HCV genotypes among the populations
studied

A total of 1240 patients were studied during a five year
period from 2005to 2009 as shown in Table 1. Off these
patients, 785 (63.3%) were predominantly males and 455
(36.7%) patients were females with a male; female ratio
(1.7:1). The age was ranged from 16 to 84 years with a
predominantly larger proportion of younger patients
with an average of 40 years or less with no significant

gender variation (P > 0, 05). The prevalence of HCV in
this study was calculated, per year and expressed as a
percentage.
Different HCV genotypes were found among the
Patients studied as shown in Table 1. These include
genotypes, 1,2,3 and 4 while HCV genotype 5 & 6 were
not reported among these patients. The prevalence of
such genotypes was variable among the patients, Genotype 4 was the most frequent one detected in 443
(35.7%)patients followed by genotype 1 in 404 (32.6%)
patients, and then genotypes 3 and 2 accounted for 207
(16.7%) and 186 (15%) patients respectively. The year by
year distribution has been stable since 2005; the beginning of the study including the high percentage of type
4 and 1.
The prevalence of gender associated HCV genotypes
was analysed among the patients. The most frequent
genotype reported among females was genotype 4 as it
was accounted for 207(45.5%) patients, followed by genotype 1 accounted for 134 (29.5%), G2 accounted 78
(17.1%) and then genotype 3 accounted for 36 (7.9%).
The most frequent HCV genotype among male populations was genotype 1 as it was detected in 270(34.3%)
cases, followed by genotype 4 detected in 236 (30%)
cases, genotype 3 detected in 171 (21.8%) and less frequent one was HCV genotype 2 detected in 108 (13.9%).
The relationship between HCV genotype and gender
was statistically significant (P value = 0.00).
Different sub-genotypes were reported among the
patients studied. Genotype 1 b was among the frequent
as it accounted for 181(14.6%) without no gender variation, followed by genotype 4a 68(5.4%) most predominantly among females 34 (7.4%). Then genotype 1a
accounted for 60 (4.9%) patients in 42 (5.3%) males and
18(3.9%) females. HCV genotype 3a accounted for 29
(2.3%) patients male 24(3%) female 5(1.1%). Genotype 2
was The most heterogenic genotype as four different
subtypes were reported which include genotype 2a, 2b,
2c & 2a/c.

aged more than 44 years (P = 0.00).
Association of the genotypes with the risk factors

The risk factors associated with the transmission of
HCV were determined in all patients studied as shown
in Table 3. The most frequently reported risk factor was
a history of surgical procedure accounted for 300
patients (24.2%), (176 (58.6%) males and 124 (41.4%)

females. Followed by patients with history of blood
transfusion 212 (17.1%), (109(51.2%) males and 103
(48.8%) females. Intravenous drug abuser ‘IVDA’
reported 85 (6.9%) patients (all males). Patients who had
history of dental procedures were 225 (18.2%) patients,
142 (63.2%) males, 83 (36.8%) females. Family history of
HCV infection was recorded in 80(6.5%), patients 64
(80%) males and 16(20%) were females. History of promiscuity were recorded in 27(2.1%), patients all of them
were males. The patients denied any history of risk factors were recorded in 311 (25.1%), 181 (58.3%) males
and 130 (41.7%) females. The relationship between HCV
risk factor for infection and gender was statistically significant ‘P value = 0.000’.
Genotype1 and genotype 4 were predominantly associated with most of the risk factors studied, particularly
those of previous surgical or dental procedures, blood
transfusion and family history. Though, genotype 1 was
only followed by genotype 3 in patients with IVDA. The
association of between the risk factors and HCV genotypes was found to be statistically insignificant (P value
= 0.180).

Discussion
The epidemiological studies on Hepatitis C Virus genotypes have gained major attention all over the world as
they appear to play an important role in elucidating the
clinical status of such infection. They have shown to be
of great benefit in guiding therapeutic decision and
implementing proper preventive strategies. The epidemiological patterns of HCV vary greatly among the

different countries and even among the regions of the
same country. However, little is known about the epidemiology of HCV genotypes in Libya. Hence then carrying such study will provide great understanding on the
prevalence of various genotypes among the Libyans
which should guide the therapeutic and prognostic
implications in HCV infection. In this study the patterns
of HCV genotypes and various risk factors for possible
route of transmission in Libya were studied. The serum
samples collected from different patients registered at
Tripoli Medical centre were found to be positive for
HCV and could thus be genotyped. Four different genotypes were reported in this study including genotypes,
1,2,3 and 4. The distribution of these genotypes were
variable among the patients studied. The most prevalent
genotype was genotype 4 and then genotype 2, though
genotypes 3&2 were less accounted. Different subtypes
were found among HCV genotypes studied. These
include nine HCV subtypes as genotype 1 subtype (1a &
1b), 2(2a,2b,2c&2a/c), 3(3a), 4(4a&4c/d) the most frequent of these subtypes were 4a and 1b. The data of the
present study is in concordance with previous studies
reported from different regions of the world particularly
in North African countries. Previous study conducted in
Tunisia reported that genotype 1b was the most prevalent genotype [16] and in Egypt genotype 4a was predominant [17], genotypes 1a and 1b were common in the
United State and Europe [18,19]. In Pakistan and Japan
Genotypes 3a and 1b were common respectively where
as genotype 5a were common in South Africa [9]. The
distribution such HCV genotypes among Libyan patients
remain invariable during the five years study period
including the high rate of genotype 4 and 1. This concise with Henquell, etal. who found that there was no
year to year variation of HCV genotypes in Central
France in six years prospectively conducted study [20].
It is apparent that further studies are needed to clarify
such evident prevalence as longer time may be needed
to observe such changes. In Pakistan it seems that 15-20
years needed as the genotype 3 a to be replaced by genotype 1(a or b) [9], while in Venezuela that took only 10
years time for displacement of genotype 1 b by type 2
[21].
Studies on the association of gender with specific
HCV genotypes were found to be equivocal. In Luxembourg the prevalence of HCV genotype 3 was found to
be a significantly associated with males while genotype 2
and 5 more frequent in females [22]. In Pakistan such
association was lacking as the distribution of HCV genotypes were similar in both male and female patients
[23,24]. In this study there was a variation of HCV genotypes among male and female patients. Genotype 4 was
significantly more frequent in female while genotype 1
more frequent in males though the frequency of

Page 5 of 7

genotypes 3 and 4 were independent of gender. However, such association merits, further investigation.
The distribution of HCV genotypes may be variable
according to the age of the population. In Italy, the prevalence of genotypes 1b and 2 decreased significantly
among younger children compared with the older ones
who have an increased rate of genotypes 3 and 4
[25,26]. In France type 5 was more frequent in patients
older than 50 than those younger than 49 [27,28]. Studies carried by Roman etal., showed that genotype 3
was associated with patients aged less than 40 years,
while genotype 2 was significantly prevalent with those
over 40 years of age [22]. In this study, genotype 1 was
associated with a younger age group less than 34 years,
decreased in a middle- and older age groups. Conversely, HCV genotype 2 was higher among elderly patient
above 55 years, lesser at age group of 45-54, and even
after. These finding however, do need further investigations, as such epidemiological variation may be associated with the mode of transmission of HCV and thus
they may have clinical and therapeutic implications.
Different studies have shown the dynamicity of HCV
genotypes, which lead to the emergence of different types
and subtypes over time. Such phenomenon is obvious in
certain European counties such as in Germany and
Greece, where the prevalence of HCV genotypes 1b and
2 have decreased and genotypes 1a, 3a, and 4 increased.
Such changes were not noticeable in Luxembourg where
genotypes 1 and 3 were the most prevalent [22]. Here in
we did not notice any significant changes in the emergence of HCV genotypes among the Libyans during the
period of this study. Such results were in agreement with
the data reported in Tunis and Egypt [16,17] as HCV
genotypes proportion has been relatively constant overtime. The association of HCV genotypes variation with
demographic data may be related to the immigration
flow which obvious among the European countries and
rarely seen in the Arab and African countries.
Many studies have been suggesting that HCV genotypes are associated with certain risk factors and different modes of transmission. The genotypes reported in
this study were isolated from all the patients with the
risk factors stated. Such, relationship between HCV genotypes and risk factors was statistically significant. High
prevalence of HCV genotype 4 in our study is particularly attributable to previous history of surgical operation followed by dental intervention and blood
transfusion respectively. The same is applicable for genotype 1. While genotype 3 and 1 were common inpatient with IVDA. Configuration of HCV subtypes and its
association with the risk factors was also obvious in this
study. HCV genotype 1b is more common in patients
who had history of blood transfusion and surgical
procedures.

Elasifer et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:317
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/317

The association of HCV genotypes with the risk factor
varies from one country to another. The high prevalence
of HCV genotype 3 among Europeans is attributed to
IVDA and incarcerated population [28]. In this study
only 6.9% of individuals admitted they have a history of
IVDA which was associated with genotype3. The high
prevalence of genotype 4 and 1 among Libyans which is
uncommon in Europe and North America is particularly
attributable to medical-related transmission such as
blood transfusion, surgery and dental procedures. This
is an agreement with studies from Pakistan and Hungry
where the majority of cases of genotypes 1 and 4 have
history of hospitalization for surgery, dental procedure
and blood transfusion [9,23,29]. This raises an important
question regarding the prevention methods of to be
established among Libyan hospitals to prevent the
spread of HCV and other blood born viruses [30,31].
This study showed a detailed estimation on the epidemiology of HCV genotypes in Libya. The commonly
prevalent genotypes 4 and 1 are more likely attributable to the medical-related transmission such as blood,
surgery and dental procedures despite that blood
banks in Libya do screen routinely for HCV in all
blood products. This however raises an alarming signal
on the major steps to be taken to reduce such infection. Therefore, a national strategy should be implemented and specific prevention guide lines have to be
followed to reduce such risks. As Libya being a third
largest country in Africa with a variable race populations further studies are needed in different regional
parts of the country to estimate the diversity of HCV
genotypes in each region and assess the risk factors
involved with specific emphases on the genetic
sequences of un-typable HCV genotypes and multivariate analysis on such risk factors [32].

Conclusion
The predominantly isolated HCV genotype from Libyans
were genotype 4 followed by genotype 1. Other genotypes and subtypes such as 1(a,b,c),2(a,b,c),3a, and 4(a,c/
d) were also reported in this study. Such genotypes were
variable according to the age and gender of the patients
studied. The mostly associated risk factors with these
genotypes were medical-related route of transmission
including blood transfusion, surgical operation and dental procedures, other risk factors such as family history
and IVDA were also reported.
