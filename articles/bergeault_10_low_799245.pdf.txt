Low level of polymorphism in two putative NPR1
homologs in the Vitaceae family
Karine Bergeault1*, Christophe Bertsch1, Didier Merdinoglu2, Bernard Walter1

Abstract
Background: Grapevine is subjected to numerous pests and diseases resulting in the use of phytochemicals in
large quantities. The will to decrease the use of phytochemicals leads to attempts to find alternative strategies,
implying knowledge of defence mechanisms. Numerous studies have led to the identification of signalling
pathways and regulatory elements involved in defence in various plant species. Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis
Related 1 (NPR1) is an important regulatory component of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in Arabidopsis
thaliana.
Results: Two putative homologs of NPR1 gene were found in the two sequenced grapevine genomes available in
the Genoscope database for line 40024 and in the IASMA database for Pinot noir ENTAV 115. We named these two
NPR1 genes of Vitis vinifera : VvNPR1.1 and VvNPR1.2. A PCR-based strategy with primers designed on exons was
used to successfully amplify NPR1 gene fragments from different Vitaceae accessions. Sequence analyses show that
NPR1.1 and NPR1.2 are highly conserved among the different accessions not only V. vinifera cultivars but also other
species. We report nucleotide polymorphisms in NPR1.1 and NPR1.2 from fifteen accessions belonging to the
Vitaceae family. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions determines the evolutionary
pressures acting on the Vitaceae NPR1 genes. These genes appear to be experiencing purifying selection. In some
of the species we have analysed one of the two alleles of NPR1.1 contains a premature stop codon. The deduced
amino acid sequences share structural features with known NPR1-like proteins: ankyrin repeats, BTB/POZ domains,
nuclear localization signature and cysteines. Phylogenetic analyses of deduced amino acid sequences show that
VvNPR1.1 belongs to a first group of NPR1 proteins known as positive regulators of SAR and VvNPR1.2 belongs to a
second group of NPR1 proteins whose principal members are AtNPR3 and AtNPR4 defined as negative regulators
of SAR.
Conclusion: Our study shows that NPR1.1 and NPR1.2 are highly conserved among different accessions in the
Vitaceae family. VvNPR1.1 and VvNPR1.2 are phylogenetically closer to the group of positive or negative SAR
regulators respectively.

Background
The Vitaceae family consists of approximately 700 species classified in 14 genera. Ampelopsis and Parthenocissus are two genera related to each other. The genus
Vitis has been divided into two distinct sections called
Euvitis and Muscadinia [1]. These two sections can be
differentiated not only on morphological and anatomical
appearance but also on chromosome number. Muscadinia have 2n = 40 chromosomes while Euvitis have only

2n = 38 [2]. Vitis vinifera, as well as several other species and hybrids of Vitis, are well known economically
for grapes, wine and raisins productions. Grape and
their derivatives have an increasing worldwide market
[3]. Vineyard is constantly subjected to numerous stresses due to climatic conditions, farming techniques,
mineral deficiency or pathogens. Vineyards are threatened by numerous viruses, bacteria and fungi. This
situation leads wine growers to use chemicals in large
quantities.
The stimulation of grapevine’s own defences could be
an alternative strategy to phytochemicals. Numerous

studies have led to the identification of several plant
genes involved in defence mechanisms and especially in
signal transduction pathways [4]. Nonexpressor of PR 1
(NPR1) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana is an important
regulatory component of systemic acquired resistance
(SAR) [5-7]. SAR is a plant immune response that is
triggered after local infection with pathogens [8-10].
The onset of SAR requires the accumulation of salicylic
acid (SA) and the coordinated expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes [7]. Besides SA-mediated SAR,
other pathways are involved in plant defence systems,
namely ISR (induced systemic resistance) and jasmonic
acid (JA)-mediated pathways. The SAR and ISR pathways are independent but have an overlapping requirement for NPR1 [11]. When SA and JA are applied
together to leaves, the presence of SA inhibits JA synthesis and signalling. This inhibition is alleviated in the
npr1 mutant, indicating that NPR1 is part of the crosstalk control between signalling pathways [12]. NPR1 is a
positive regulator of the plant defence response and its
mechanism of action is well characterized.
The NPR1 protein localizes both to the cytoplasm and
the nucleus [13]. Upon pathogen attack, accumulation
of SA causes a decrease in cellular reduction potential,
leading to the conversion of NPR1 from inactive oligomers into active monomers that enter the nucleus and
interact differentially with TGA proteins which are
basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors.
This interaction stimulates the DNA binding activity of
TGA factors to SA-responsive elements in the promoter
of pathogenesis-related genes [8,14,15]. The Arabidopsis
thaliana genome contains six NPR1-related genes [16]
(called AtNPR1 to AtNPR6), whose deduced proteins all
share the Broad Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac/
Pox virus and Zinc finger (BTB/POZ) domain and the
Ankyrin Repeat Domain (ARD). According to Mou et
al. (2003) [15], AtNPR1 and NPR1-like proteins from
four plant species contain ten conserved cysteines. Cys
82 and Cys 216 are essential for keeping NPR1 in the
cytoplasm [15]. NPR1 genes have been found in genomes of various species such as rice [17,18], Indian
mustard [19], apple [20] and cotton [21]. Overexpression of AtNPR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, tomato
and wheat enhances fungal and bacterial resistance
[17,20,22-27] through elevated expression of PR genes
[22,25].
In plants, molecular diversity was first studied based
on the existence of mutational events. Detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) allows the analysis
of sequence differences between alleles. Nucleotide
diversity reflects the combined history of selection,
migration, recombination and mating systems experienced by species. Nucleotide diversity is one source of
phenotypic variation [28]. SNPs have been characterized

in crop plant genomes such as maize, sugarbeet, barley,
soybean, wheat, rice and grapevine [29]. As the grapevine is propagated vegetatively, its genome has a higher
probability to accumulate large deletions, insertions,
inversions or other events which may differentiate the
two pairs of chromosomes.
In the present study, a PCR-based strategy with primers designed on exons was used to successfully amplify
NPR1 exons. A phylogenetic tree was used to analyse
the relationship of NPR1 proteins from Arabidopsis
thaliana and homologs from various plant species. Analysis of sequence mutations was done to study the polymorphism of NPR1 in fifteen accessions of the Vitaceae
family. To examine the evolutionary pressures acting on
the NPR1.1 and NPR1.2, the ratio of nonsynonymous
(replacement) to synonymous (silent substitution)
nucleotides was determined.

Results and discussion
Putative homologs of AtNPR1 in grapevine: VvNPR1.1 and
VvNPR1.2

We named VvNPR1.1 and VvNPR1.2 two putative
homologs of the AtNPR1 gene from the grapevine genome sequences published by the French-Italian Public
Consortium for Grapevine Genome (line 40024) and by
the Istituto Agrario Di San Michele All’Adige (Vitis vinifera Pinot noir ENTAV 115). Line 40024 [30] is highly
homozygous and Pinot noir ENTAV 115 [31] is heterozygous. No additional member of the NPR1 gene family
was found in NCBI and ESTAP databases after blast
and key words research. The intron-exon structure in
NPR1.1 and NPR1.2 from the Vitaceae accessions was
the same as in AtNPR1: four exons and three introns,
except for Ampelopsis japonica where intron 3 is missing. The complete cDNA is 1,755 bp for VvNPR1.1 and
1,764 bp for VvNPR1.2. The deduced proteins have 584
and 587 amino acids, respectively and they share structural features with known NPR1 proteins which are
highly conserved across many species: ankyrin repeats in
the middle of the protein (ARD), the N-terminal BTB/
POZ domains, the C-terminal nuclear localization signature (NLS) [32] and nine among ten conserved cysteines
described by Mou et al. (2003) [15] (Figure 1). This suggests that VvNPR1 may interact with other proteins, as
previously described in Arabidospsis thaliana [13,33-36].
The amino acids 61-184 of VvNPR1.1 and 64-190 of
VvNPR1.2 show similarity to the BTB/POZ motif. The
amino acids 259-318 and 322-351 of VvNPR1.1 and
amino acids 296-326 and 330-359 of VvNPR1.2 reveal
respectively three and two highly conserved ankyrin
repeats (Figure 1). The deduced amino acid sequences
of VvNPR1.1 and VvNPR1.2 show 43% identity.
VvNPR1.1 and VvNPR1.2, respectively, show 52% and
37% identity with AtNPR1. Three phylogenic groups

have been described in the AtNPR1 protein family by
Hepworth et al. (2005) [37] (Figure 2). These authors
stated that branching pattern suggests that members in
each group may have similar functions. VvNPR1.1 is
close to AtNPR1 and AtNPR2 in the first group.
VvNPR1.2 is with AtNPR3 and AtNPR4 in the second
group. AtNPR5 and AtNPR6 present high homology
with Blade-on-petiole 1 and 2 of A. thaliana (BOP1 and
BOP2) which involved in some aspects of morphogenesis and leaf/flower development [37]. A putative Bladeon-petiole gene which we named Vitis vinifera BOP
(VvBOP) was identified in the Genoscope database.
VvBOP is closely related to AtNPR5 and AtNPR6 and
can be involved in morphogenesis and leaf/flower development, like AtNPR5 and AtNPR6 (Figure 2)
[6,16,19,20,23,30,38-40].
Purifying selection for Vitaceae NPR1.1 and Vitaceae
NPR1.2

Sequence data for fifteen accessions belonging to the
Vitaceae family (Figure 3) were obtained from NPR1
fragments amplified using PCR primers. Identification of
polymorphic sites was based on two alleles sequenced.
Figures 4 and 5 show the distribution of SNPs along the
four exons of NPR1.1 and NPR1.2 respectively, in Ampelopsis japonica, Muscadinia rotundifolia, Parthenocissus
quinquefolia and five American Vitis species and in six
V. vinifera cultivars (Gouais blanc, Muscat reine des vignes, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling, Pinot noir, Gewurztraminer). The SNPs are not evenly distributed. NPR1.1
exon 3 and the four NPR1.2 exons have a low SNP rate
(4% to 5.4% SNPs per exon), in comparison with
NPR1.1 exons 1, 2 and 4 (7.2% to 8.4% SNPs per exon).
Globally, NPR1.1 is more polymorphic than NPR1.2. In
the six V. vinifera cultivars, SNP rate is lower than 2.5%
(0.1% in VvNPR1.1 exon 2 to 2.5% in VvNPR1.2 exon 3)
and 4.2% in VvNPR1.2 exon 4. In the six V. vinifera

VvNPR1.1 and VvNPR1.2 were compared to sequences of proteins
annotated as being homologs of AtNPR1 from different plant
species. Accession numbers used in the alignments are listed in
table 1. All sequences annotated as NPR1 or closely related to
VvNPR1 genes after blast were recovered in the NCBI database. The
numbers beside the branches represent bootstrap values based on
5,000 replicates. The scale at the top indicates genetic distance
proportional to the number of substitutions per site.

cultivars, SNP rate in introns (about 2%, data not
shown) was not significantly different from SNP rate in
exons [41].
NPR1.1

Polymorphisms in exon 1 and exon 4 of NPR1.1 were
identified by silent substitutions at positions 23, 31, 515
and a missense substitution at position 576. A threonine
codon present in all the other accessions changed in an
asparagine codon in line 40024. Missense substitutions
in the BTB/POZ domain cause protein modifications
(Figure 1). It is likely that substitutions have important
consequences for the function of the BTB/POZ domain
and perhaps its regulation. In fact, the BTB/POZ
domain is an evolutionarily conserved protein-protein
interaction motif [42]. A mutation in this region results
in the loss of NPR1 function and affects protein-protein
interaction [6,7]. A heterozygous zone, observed in
Ampelopsis japonica, Muscadinia rotundifolia, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, V. cinerea, V. aestivalis, V. rupestris,
V. arizonica and V. vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon, at the
beginning of NPR1.1 exon 3, shows a nucleotide substitution in a glycine codon (GGA) which introduces a
premature stop codon (TGA) in the central part of the
protein. These results suggest that one of the two
NPR1.1 alleles generates a truncated protein (427 aa)
derived from translation of only exon 1 and 2. As a

result, the truncated protein does not retain one of the
conserved cysteines, but contains all of the protein-protein interaction domains. The truncated protein
VvNPR1.1 should be functional because it possesses the
interaction domain and nine of ten conserved cysteines.
The missing cysteine is not essential for the nuclear
localization [15]. Nonsense substitutions that generate a
premature translational termination signal should reduce
the steady-state accumulation of the corresponding
mRNA [43]. No readthrough mechanism have been
described until now in plants and nonsense substitutions
are not enough to stop the translation since the second
allele can be entirely expressed. Alleles rendered nonfunctional due to mutations causing frame shifts and/or
premature stop codons were observed for five defence
response loci (EDS5, ESP, ETR1, EDS1 and PAD4) in
A. thaliana [44]. There is no evidence for non-functional AtNPR1 alleles but it could be different for
VvNPR1.1. The ankyrin repeat domain of AtNPR1 are
necessary and sufficient for the interaction with members of the TGA family of transcription factors, although
high-affinity interactions also require the N-terminal one
third of NPR1 [13,35,36].
NPR1.2

A deletion of 3 amino acids (amino acids 17 to 19) and
a supplementary pattern of 6 amino acids were found in

exon 4 of Ampelopsis japonica NPR1.2. This supplementary pattern is not a preserved protein pattern according
to web-based SMART program.
Polymorphisms in exons 2, 3 and 4 of NPR1.2 were
identified by silent substitutions at positions 298, 446
and 565 and a change at position 195 from a leucine
codon into a valine in Ampelopsis japonica and Parthenocissus quinquefolia.
According to Bakker et al. (2008) [44], there are three
distinguished evolutionary scenarios for selection: (1)
long-term balancing selection, where a gene may have
highly diverged alleles at intermediate frequencies and a
high level of silent polymorphism, (2) positive selection
of a favorable allele, which can generate a locus with

few, relatively young alleles with extended haplotypes
and (3) purifying selection or functional constraint,
which leads to low levels of nonsynonymous polymorphism and a commensurately low rate of divergence
between species.
From our results, the ratio of nonsynonymous to
synonymous nucleotide substitutions (Ka/Ks) relating
influence of selection is smaller than 1 in both genes
(0.84 in NPR1.1 and 0.44 in NPR1.2). These results suggest a purifying selection against substitutions that
would result in amino acid replacements. In NPR1.2, the
ratio is also lower than 1 for the four exons taken independently (0.34 to 0.68). The comparison of selected
clones from fifteen accessions belonging to the Vitaceae

family revealed a high homology for the two genes. The
polymorphism data in NPR1.1 and NPR1.2 indicate purifying selection and sequence conservation. Generally,
the defence response genes tend to maintain lower
levels of diversity. The majority of defence response
genes appear to be experiencing purifying selection [44].
In general, defence response genes do not appear to be
under balancing selection but strong evidence of balancing selection was detected at AtNPR1 [44,45]. Our
results show that NPR1.1 and NPR1.2 are highly conserved under strong purifying selection and do not vary
much from accession to accession, indicating that mutations probably have deleterious consequences. Purifying

selection results in the reduction of genetic variation
through the elimination of maladjusted alleles and consequently of the mutations that caused the maladjustment. These contradictory results may be related to the
fact that A. thaliana multiplies by sexual reproduction
while grapevine by vegetative propagation.
Functional hypothesis: two types of regulations by NPR1like genes?

The complete sequence of putative homologs of the
AtNPR1 gene family is known in various species (Table
1). According to the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2), three
groups of NPR genes can be distinguished. VvNPR1.1 is

Bergeault et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:9
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/9

in the same group as NPR1 from sugar beet, tobacco,
sweet pepper and tomato as also AtNPR1 and AtNPR2
from Arabidopsis and rice OsiNPR1/NH1. From the ten
cysteines described as conserved in AtNPR1 and NPR1like proteins, only eight are conserved in all the Vitaceae
accessions we have analyzed, but the two cysteines
essential for oligomer formation are present [15] (Figure
6). Sequence similarities, conservation of functional sites
and cysteines suggest that VvNPR1.1 could have functions similar to that of AtNPR1 as a positive regulator
of SAR. Nevertheless, functions of a limited number of
NPR1 homologs have been studied. The expression of
BjNPR1, MNPR1A and MNPR1B is induced by SA or
MeJA treatment. BjNPR1-GFP fusion protein is localized
to the nucleus following SA treatment. MNPR1A and
MNPR1B increase PR gene expression [38]. Overexpression of BnNPR1 from canola and OsiNPR1/NH1 in rice
complement the npr1 mutations and enhance resistance
[23,46,47]. The NPR1 proteins in the first group could
be activated during potential redox modifications
induced by SA or various pathogenic conditions and
show a similar regulation across different species.
VvNPR1.2 is grouped with NtNML1 and LeNML1 as
also AtNPR3 and AtNPR4 which have been described as
negative regulators of SAR (Figure 2) [34]. Only five of
the ten cysteine residues are conserved in the proteins
from the group 2. Cysteine 216 which is essential for
oligomerization in AtNPR1 is absent from all the NPR1
in group 2. The absence of cysteine residue 216 (Figure
7) suggests that VvNPR1.2 should be differently regulated, as observed for AtNPR3 and AtNPR4. AtNPR3
and AtNPR4 perform overlapping functions and that
loss of the function in npr3 npr4 double mutant leads to
much higher PR-1 expression and enhanced resistance
[34]. It is plausible that AtNPR3 and AtNPR4 negatively
regulate PR-1 expression and pathogen resistance [34].
Inactivating both AtNPR3 and AtNPR4 leads to activation of TGA and expression of PR genes [34]. AtNPR3
and AtNPR4 would be negative regulators of plant
defence responses [34]. A contradictory result has been
reported with MpNPR1-1 which is induced by the SAR
and its overexpression increases the resistance of apple
to pathogens, suggesting that MpNPR1 may act as a
positive regulator despite the absence of cysteine 216
[20]. Therefore, phylogenetic analysis is not sufficient to
predict a positive or negative control of defence
responses for VvNPR1.2.

Conclusions
Homologs of the Arabidopsis NPR1 gene have now been
isolated from numerous other plant species. Our study
with Genoscope annotations provides the existence of a
possible NPR1 gene family in Vitaceae. VvNPR1.1 and
VvNPR1.2 genes have four exons and three introns. The

deduced amino acid sequences show 52% and 37% identity to AtNPR1, and all three functional domains identified in A. thaliana NPR1 are conserved in the Vitaceae
NPR1. The polymorphism on these two genes is in favour
of purifying selection. Two Vitis vinifera NPR1-like proteins are separated in two of the three groups described
by Hepworth et al. (2005) [37]. We have shown that the
VvNPR1.1 is related to a first NPR1 group of positive
regulators of SAR and VvNPR1.2 is related to a second
NPR1 group whose principal members would be negative
regulators of SAR, AtNPR3 and AtNPR4.

Amplification of DNA

PCR primers to amplify exons using the published genome sequence http://www.cns.fr/externe/English/corps_anglais.html[30] were designed (Table 2). Genomic
DNA was amplified by PCR using the following conditions: 10 ng of DNA template, 1 × PCR Buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM each dNTP (Invitrogen),
0.2 μM each primer, 1.25 Unit Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and milli-Q® water to a final volume
of 25 μl. PCR reactions were performed using a 5 min
initial denaturation/activation step, followed by 35 or 40
cycles at 94°C for 45 s, Tm for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min
per Kb, with a final extension step of 10 min at 72°C.
PCR products were assessed by electrophoresis in 1.5%
agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Polymorphism detection methods

A PCR-based strategy with primers designed on exons
amplifying successfully NPR1 gene fragments was used.
The sequencing reaction can produce one (homozygote)
or two (heterozygote) peaks depending on the genotype
for each nucleotide. DNA sequences and the complete
protein sequences of members of the NPR1 gene family
were aligned using Vector NTI and Bioedit software.
Phylogenetic trees were produced using the ClustalW
web site http://align.genome.jp/ and the Phylo_win program using the neighbour-joining method [50]. The
NPR1 sequences (Table 1) from other species, available
in the NCBI GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,
were included in the sequence analysis for comparison.
The Web-based SMART program was used to predict
the BTB/POZ domains and to confirm the localization
of ankyrin repeats for each protein. Percentage of SNP
corresponds to the ratio of number of modified nucleotides to total number of nucleotides for each exon. To
examine the evolutionary pressures acting on the
NPR1.1 and NPR1.2 genes, the ratio of nonsynonymous
(replacement) substitutions to synonymous (silent)
nucleotide substitutions was determined [51-53]. Generally, values larger than 1 indicate sequence diversification. Instead, values smaller than or equal to 1 are
indicative, respectively, of sequence conservation or random mutagenesis.

The ESTAP software from Expressed Sequence Tag

Cloning gene-specific PCR fragments

Reviewers’ reports

When polymorphism appeared after the first sequencing
reaction, the PCR products were ligated into the pCR2.1
vector (Original TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ligation mixtures
were incubated overnight at 14°C to obtain the maximum number of transformants. Ligation products were
transformed into competent E.coli bacteria cells (InaF’)
using a 90 second heat-shock at 42°C. The bacterial
cells were spread onto LB agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) (Sigma) and X-Gal (40 μg/ml)
(Euromedex).
Plasmid minipreps were performed by the alkaline
lysis method [49]. The PCR fragments in the vectors
were sequenced by Genoscreen (Lille, France) using
M13 and M13 rev primers.

Reviewer 1: Fyodor Kondrashov, Centre for Genomic
Regulation, Barcelona, Spain

This manuscript suffers from conceptual flaws that renders it incomprehensible and misleading: the difference
between mutations, polymorphisms and substitutions is
obscured to a degree that I believe in the current form
makes the analysis almost meaningless.
The authors determine the sequence of a duplicated
orthologs of a NPR1 gene found in Arhabidopsis in several
different species and strains of the Vitaceae family. The
differences between the obtained sequences the authors
interchangeably call “polymorphisms”, “substitutions”,
“modifications” and “mutations”. I can only assume that
the authors have sequenced several individuals from each
species or strain, since the title refers to polymorphisms.

VvNPR1.2

However, I did not find a statement of how many individuals were sequenced for each species/strain, or whether
or not substitutions where included in the analysis. The
authors state that “The NPR1 sequences (Table 1) from
other species, [...], were included in the sequence analysis
for comparison.” What kind of comparison? Is the data
really a mix of polymorphisms and substitutions? Such
constant confusion between mutational, polymorphism
and marco-evolutionary levels provides a huge barrier to
comprehension of the results.
Another example: that authors claim that “[Ka/Ks]
values smaller than or equal to 1 are indicative, respectively, of sequence conservation or random mutagenesis.” Actually, Ka/Ks of any value can be achieved by
random mutagenesis! Unfortunately, there are other,
equally frustrating, examples. Before the authors can
make a clear distinction between mutations (instantaneous products of mutagenesis), polymorphisms (segregating alleles in a population) and substitutions
(sequence differences between homologs in different
species or strains) and make it clear to the reader what
kind of data they are using the manuscript will remain
fatally flawed.
In addition, once the authors can distinguish between
these three concepts the data analysis can be expanded
to include a combination of phylogenetic and population
genetic analyses, broadening the overall ability of the
authors to infer the kinds of selection acting in these
genes.
A minor issue that arises from the same misconception. The authors spend some time discussing the possible functional implications of different nonsynonymous
and nonsense “mutations”. All of these functional implications are a mute point if these are deleterious segregating polymorphisms. The functional implications are
justified if the authors mean substitutions.
Author’s response: The manuscript was improved in
response to these observations in particular to make it
more comprehensible.
Pages 11 and 12, words “mutations” and “polymorphism” were used by Bakker et al. (2008).

In the last paragraph before “Functional hypothesis
[...]“, the term “mutations” was used because it is a general conclusion.
We have sequenced a pool of three individuals for each
species. Each PCR products was sequenced once. When
polymorphism appeared after the first sequencing reaction, the PCR products were ligated into a vector and
sequenced six times to generate the two polymorphic
alleles, separately. We estimated that this pool is sufficient to represent the whole species studied because
grapevine is multiplicated by vegetative propagation.
Moreover, our reference 40024 line was also sequenced
according to the same procedure, compared to the
sequence available on the Genoscope database and no
difference was observed. If an allele was identical to our
reference but the other one was different, we took
account to the polymorphic allele to consider a maximum diversity.
The sentence “The NPR1 sequences (Table 1) from
other species [...], were included in the sequence analysis
for comparison.” refers to Figure 2. The aim of this study
was to place our two genes in a set of gene described as
NPR1. We used the raw sequence of 40024 line available
on the Genoscope database to make our comparison
without introducing polymorphisms or substitutions.
We have reduced the functional hypothesis part.
Second review of Bergeault et al. “Low level of polymorphism in two putative orthologs of NPR1 genes in
the Viraceae family”.
While significantly improved from the last version, I
still think that the manuscript suffers from conceptual
inconsistencies. Also, now that the results are clearer to
me I do not find them interesting or revealing.
The content: The authors show that two paralogs that
have a 43% identity are under negative selection by
comparing the density of nonsynonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphisms. This is hardly surprising and
I am not sure why the authors think that such a result
should be published. Any theory of gene duplications
will confirm that nothing but negative selection is
expected for such distant paralogs.

Bergeault et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:9
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/9

The approach: On the other hand, the authors have
the right approach to study the functional impact of the
functional impact of the origin of gene duplication,
which is one of the least understood part of gene duplication evolution. If the paralogs were 99% identical than
the results would have shown that the origin of a new
function occurred quickly, or that the gene duplication
itself was adaptive. Many studies of such sort should be
undertaken, but this analysis does not mean very much
with distant paralogs.
The language: Another unfortunate aspect of this
manuscript is that it is littered with terminological
inconsistencies. For example the authors say “To examine the evolutionary pressures acting on the NPR1.1 and
NPR1.2, the ratio of nonsynonymous (replacement) to
synonymous (silent substitution) nucleotides was determined.” Clearly, the word “nucleotides” should be either
“substitutions” or “polymorphisms”. Another such misconception is the claim that Kn/Ks < 1 can signify a
recent selective sweep. I disagree: the only other thing it
can signify besides negative selection is different mutation rates of synonymous and nonsynoymous sites. Even
more unfortunately, is that the authors really mean Pn/
Ps (for polymorphisms, not substitutions) throughout
the manuscript and use “substitutions” (which are fixed
differences) instead of “polymorphisms” (which are still
segregating in the population). Also, instead of using
“accessions” some other term, for example “strain”
should be used: one cannot extract DNA from an
accession.
Author’s response: The manuscript was improved in
response to these observations in particular to “recent
selective sweep” where we are agreeing with Dr Kondrashov. This sentence was suppressed.
The “accession” is frequently used in wine-growing.
This term indicates a grape variety, a variety or a clone.
Reviewer 2: Purificación López-García, Université ParisSud, Paris, France

Review of the article “Low level of polymorphism in two
putative orthologs of NPR1 genes in the Vitaceae family
by Bergeault et al., submitted to Biology Direct. Bergeault et al. identify two homologues of Arabidopsis
NPR1 genes, known to be involved in general systemic
resistance against pathogens or herbivores, in the genome of the grapevine Vitis vinifera. They subsequently
design specific primers and amplify the corresponding
genes from various grapevine cultivars. The analysis of
those genes show a low level of polymorphism and,
based on a ratio of synonymous versus non-synonymous
substitutions lower than 1, the authors conclude that
these genes are under purifying selection. Overall, the
work is clear and appears well conducted. However, I

Page 11 of 13

think that the structure and writing of the manuscript
may be improved. A few suggestions follow.
In particular, there are many figures, some of which
could be eliminated without loss of essential information. This is the case of figure 6 showing the stop codon
region in NPR1.1. As an additional suggestion, figure 1
and 4 could be merged together in a composite figure
showing as an inset the NPR1.1 BTB/POZ domain
region with the polymorphisms identified. I also believe
that figure 8, showing the different cultivars analyzed,
should appear as figure 1 at the beginning of the results
section, since these are the cultivars subsequent work is
about. Otherwise, placing it at the end of the manuscript with only a brief mention in the Methods section
would make it dispensable.
The long discussion about the potential functions of
NPR1 genes in V. vinifera is rather speculative in the
absence of actual functional data and could be significantly shortened.
Bergeault et al. observed that “in six V. vinifera cultivars SNP rate to introns was not significantly different
to exons”. Why? Could this suggest that the low SNP
observed is not (at least totally) due to purifying selection but to other kind of constraint acting on that particular genomic region?
Minor comments:
- First paragraph of Background. Some references
should be added. Readers may be not familiar with V.
vinifera and their general genomic characteristics.
- Page 12, last line before “Functional hypothesis...”.
Sexual instead of sexuel.
- Page 15, “high homology values”. This expression is
incorrect. Homology is an all-or-nothing quality. Either
two genes are homologous (derive from a common
ancestor) or they are not. “High similarity or identity
values” would be more appropriate.
Author’s response: The manuscript was improved in
response to these very useful comments. In answer to the
question concerning the SNP rate to introns, it is not significantly different to exons and this for the 3 introns
which compose each gene. We suppose indeed that it is
due to purifying selection since it is observed in 3 introns
in six V. vinifera.
For the incorrect expression in the minor comments,
this sentence was suppressed.

NPR1 [Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis Related 1]-like genes’
polymorphism in different species of the Vitaceae family.
Grapevine is subjected to numerous stresses (both enviromental and pathogeneous), and new knowledge on its
defence mechanisms (NPR1 gene is one of the main component of systemic acquired resistance [SAR] in plants)
certainly will be beneficial both for scientific community
and for human society in general. The main finding of the
manuscript is the fact that family of NPR genes in Vitis
vinifera and probably in all other plants consists of at least
3 separate branches. These 3 subfamilies of NPR genes in
plants exemplified in Arabidopsis thaliana by AtNPR1,
AtNPR3 and AtNPR5 (BOP) genes, respectively. Analysis of
nucleotide polymorphisms in two NPR1-like genes from
fifteen accessions belonging to the Vitaceae family indicate
that the genes are under purifying selection, but the
AtNPR1 ortholog (VvNRP1.1) is more polymorphic. A tentative hypothesis of authors about two types (positive and
negative) of regulation by different subfamilies of NPR1genes although is interesting, but certainly needs some
further experimental support. The revised version of the
manuscript takes the suggestions that I previously made
into account. The changes in the revised manuscript and
the new title help to clarify the aim of the manuscript considerably. In my opinion, it would be better to re-name
Vitis genes described by the authors on VvNRP1, VvNRP3
and VvNRP5 instead of VvNRP1.1, VvNRP1.2 and VvBOP
at it is in the text. The manuscript might need some additional editing and proofreading.
Author’s response: We are grateful to Dr Shpakovski
for his comments and notice very judicious. Indeed, the
hypothesis about their functions is essentially based on a
work on literature. But, we think that it was interesting
to discuss the two types of SAR regulation. Moreover, we
indicate in the manuscript “Therefore, phylogenetic analysis is not sufficient to predict a positive or negative control of defence responses for VvNPR1.2.”
With regard to re-name Vitis genes, another classification would make confusion. For example, where are
VvNPR2 and VvNPR4? Moreover, we have at present no
data concerning VvNPR1.2 which would act as a negative regulator of SAR and it would be premature to rename it, VvNPR3.
