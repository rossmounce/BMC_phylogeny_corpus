Abstract
Background: While influenza surveillance has increased in most developing countries in the last few years, little
influenza surveillance has been carried out in sub-Saharan Africa and no information is available in Central Africa.
The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of influenza viruses circulating in Yaounde, Cameroon and
determine their antigenic and genetic characteristics.
Methods: Throat and/or nasal swabs were collected from November 2007 to October 2008 from outpatients with
influenza-like illness (ILI) in Yaounde, Cameroon and analyzed by two different techniques: a one-step real time
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation in MDCK cells. Typing and subtyping of
virus isolates was performed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and viruses were sent to the WHO Collaborating
Centre in London, UK for further characterization and analyses of antiviral resistance by enzyme inhibition assay
and nucleotide sequencing.
Results: A total of 238 patients with ILI were sampled. During this period 70 (29%) samples were positive for
influenza by RT-PCR, of which only 26 (11%) were positive by virus isolation. By HI assay, 20 of the 26 isolates were
influenza type A (10 H3N2 and 10 H1N1) and 6 were influenza type B (2 B/Victoria/2/87 lineage and 4 B/Yagamata/
16/88 lineage). Seven (70%) of the H1N1 isolates were shown to be resistant to oseltamivir due to a H275Y
mutation.
Conclusions: This study confirmed the circulation of influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B viruses in the human
population in Central Africa and describes the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses in Central Africa.

Background
Influenza is an acute, highly contagious respiratory
infection that can cause very serious illness [1]. Identification and characterization of circulating influenza
viruses is essential to detect the emergence of antigenic drift variants causing influenza epidemics and
novel A subtypes with the potential to cause an influenza pandemic [2]. Thus influenza surveillance provides a basis for selection of the virus strains to be
included in the annual formulation of influenza vaccines [3,4]. The recent emergence of new highly virulent influenza A(H5N1) viruses, their wide circulation
in wild and domestic birds and the associated human

infections with high mortality, has raised global concern about the risk of another influenza pandemic [5].
In response, increased monitoring of influenza and
enhanced preparedness to counter an emerging pandemic are being implemented worldwide [6]. While
most countries in Asia, North America and Europe
have increased influenza surveillance in the last few
years, little influenza surveillance has been carried out
in sub-Saharan Africa [7-11] and no information is
available for Central Africa. To address this deficiency,
the Cameroon Ministry of Public Health implemented
a national influenza surveillance system in November
2007. This report presents the results of the first year
surveillance.

Methods
Analysis of clinical specimens

Throat and/or nasal swabs were collected by physicians
from outpatients with clinical evidence of influenza-like
illness (ILI), defined as person with sudden onset of
fever >38°C and cough or sore throat, at the seven sentinel sites involved in influenza surveillance in Yaounde.
All the participants were Cameroonian with no history
of recent travelling and had never received an antiviral
drug against influenza virus. Since this study was a public health program implemented by the Cameroon Ministry of Public Health, there was no need of ethical
approval. The samples in 2 ml cryovials containing virus
transport medium were kept at 4°C and transported
twice per week to the Pasteur Centre of Cameroon
(PCC) for analysis. Samples were analyzed by two different techniques: detection of influenza viruses by using a
one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an ABI Prism 7300 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) [12] and virus isolation.
Virus characterization

Viruses were isolated and passaged in Madin-Darby
canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Serotyping of virus isolates
was performed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI)
assay using human group O red blood cells and 2007
reference reagents for influenza virus diagnosis from a
WHO kit provided by the Center for Disease Control
(CDC), Atlanta. Virus isolates were sent to the WHO
Collaborating Center (CC) for Reference and Research
on influenza, London, UK for more detailed antigenic
characterization, by HI using post-infection ferret antisera, genetic characterization and analysis of antiviral
drug resistance.
Assay of neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility

Neuraminidase activity was measured using the fluorescent substrate, 2’- (4-methylumbelliferyl)-a-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA; Sigma) [13]. Briefly, 15 μl
of virus was incubated with 30 μl of 100 μM MUNANA
in 32.5 mM MES buffer pH 6.5 containing 4 mM CaCl2
for 1 hr at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by addition
of 150 μl 0.14 M NaOH in 83% Ethanol and fluorescence of the released 4-methylumbelliferone was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm
and 450 nm, respectively. The activity of each virus
sample was titrated, by assaying serial twofold dilutions,
and virus suspensions were adjusted to equivalent NA
activities, which fell in the linear portion of the activity
curve. Each virus was preincubated for 30 minutes at
37°C with oseltamivir or zanamivir at final concentrations of 5 μM-0.05pM, in serial 10-fold dilutions, NA
activity measured and the drug concentration that

inhibited 50% of the neuraminidase activity (IC50) was
determined [14].
Sequence analysis

The primers used for determination of HA, NA and M
gene sequences can be obtained on request. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences used maximum parsimony (Phylogenetic Analysis Using
Parsimony [PAUP] version 4.0; D Swofford, Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL, USA).

Results
Between November 2007 and October 2008, a total of
238 patients with ILI were included in the study. Their
mean age was 20.9 years (range 2 months - 86 years).
One third of the patients were under 5 and 5% were
more than 54 years old and the sex ratio was 1.5 female:
male. No patients had been previously vaccinated or
treated with anti-influenza drugs.
Seventy (29%) samples were positive for influenza by
RT-PCR, of which only 26 (11%) were positive by virus
isolation. By HI assay, 20 of 26 isolates were influenza
type A (10 A(H3N2) and 10 A(H1N1)) and 6 were influenza type B (2 B/Victoria/2/87 lineage and 4 B/Yagamata/16/88 lineage). All 10 influenza A(H3N2) strains
were isolated during November and December 2007.
Only A(H1N1) viruses were isolated from February to
June 2008 and all 6 influenza B viruses were isolated
between July and October 2008 (Figure 1).
The proportion of influenza virus positive samples per
month ranged from 11% to 40%. Although virus was not
isolated from samples obtained in January, April or June
2008, virus was detected using the RT-PCR technique
throughout the year, in all the isolate-positive samples
and some isolate-negative samples (Figure 1).
The influenza A(H1N1) viruses were subjected to
more detailed characterization. In HI tests using postinfection ferret antisera, the ten viruses were shown to
be antigenically closely related the prototype vaccine
virus A/Brisbane/59/2007. HA sequences of the viruses
isolated from November to December confirmed that
they were similar to those of other contemporary A/
Brisbane/59/2007-like viruses. Analysis of susceptibility
to the NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir showed
that the NAs of seven (70%) of the ten A(H1N1) isolates
were highly resistant to oseltamivir, with an average IC50
of 409 ± 53 nM compared to 1.2 ± 0.3 nM for the three
oseltamivir-sensitive viruses. All viruses retained sensitivity to zanamivir. Whereas the three earliest isolates
were sensitive, all the H1N1 viruses isolated from the
latter half of February onwards were resistant to oseltamivir. Sequences of the NAs of seven of the viruses isolated between November 2007 and May 2008 showed

that, whereas those of the sensitive viruses were close to
the sequence of A/Brisbane/59/2007, the NAs of the
oseltamivir-resistant viruses possessed the substitution
of histidine by tyrosine at residue 275 (H275Y), well
known to confer a high level resistance to oseltamivir
(Figure 2). In addition the resistant NAs were characterised by the substitution of aspartic acid 354 by glycine, typical of the majority of oseltamivir-resistant
H1N1 viruses that emerged in Europe and elsewhere
during late 2007 and 2008 [15].

Discussion
This is the first study providing data on human influenza viruses circulating in a Central African country.
We observed circulation of both influenza A subtypes,
H3N2 and H1N1, and influenza B viruses in the human
population in Cameroon during this first year. Some
African countries, including Kenya, Mauritius, Senegal,
South Africa, Tunisia and Uganda have also reported
co-circulation of both types of influenza virus during
2008 [3,4]. By using molecular techniques, influenza
virus was detected throughout the year while virus isolation alone failed to detect virus during three months.
Molecular techniques are thus suitable for the determination of influenza prevalence. However, since isolation
of viruses allows important detailed analyses of their
antigenic, genetic and drug susceptibility characteristics,
we recommend a combination of both techniques for
influenza surveillance.
All 10 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were isolated in
Cameroon during November and December 2007 when

A(H1N1) viruses were predominant in most northern
hemisphere countries, as well as in some African countries [3]. However, during the same period, sporadic
activity of influenza A(H3N2) was reported in a number
of African countries, including Ghana, Kenya, South
Africa, Tunisia and Uganda. The pattern of A(H1N1)
virus isolation in Cameroon (February to June) was
similar to that in other countries [4] and their antigenic
and genetic characteristics were similar to those of contemporary A/Brisbane/57/2007-like viruses isolated in
other parts of the world.
Of particular note was the emergence of high frequency resistance to oseltamivir among Cameroonian A
(H1N1) isolates in early 2008. Seventy percent of H1N1
isolates were shown to be highly resistant to oseltamivir
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/
H1N1200801013.pdf. The resistant viruses isolated in
February and March appear to be the first oseltamivirresistant viruses detected in Central Africa, in relation
to those isolated more recently in South Africa [16].
The NA sequences of those viruses, with the D354G
substitution in addition to the H275Y mutation, were
closely related to the majority of oseltamivir-resistant
viruses isolated in other parts of the world during 2008.
Furthermore, as observed for the majority of H1N1
viruses isolated elsewhere during late 2008, H1N1
viruses isolated in Cameroon during November and
December 2008 were resistant to oseltamivir.
Oseltamivir has never been used to any large extent in
Cameroon and there is no evidence that any of the
Cameroonian patients were exposed to the drug before

or during influenza infection. Therefore, oseltamivir
resistance is unlikely to be related to antiviral medication of patients in Cameroon, as in other countries,
where there are few instances of resistant viruses being
isolated from persons who have either been treated or
been in close contact with another individual who has
been treated with oseltamivir. It is evident that the oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses can readily transmit
between individuals and that they have a selective epidemiological advantage, in the absence of drug pressure,
which has promoted their emergence and gradual replacement of the antigeniclly similar oseltamivir-sensitive
viruses. Determining the origins and genesis of these
drug-resistant viruses, in the absence of drug pressure,
will be important in understanding the emergence and
persistence of oseltamivir resistance in relation to the
evolution of influenza viruses, drug use and pandemic
preparedness.

Conclusions
This study confirmed the circulation of human influenza
A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B viruses in Central Africa and
documented the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant
H1N1 viruses in Cameroon. Moreover, influenza surveillance is especially important in a region where outbreaks of highly pathogenic A(H5N1) influenza have
occurred in domestic poultry. The study also emphasizes
the importance of monitoring drug susceptibility as well
as the antigenic and genetic characteristics of the influenza viruses as a component of pandemic preparedness.
