Abstract
Background: Despite many studies on the biogenesis, molecular structure and biological
functions of microRNAs, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms
controlling the spatiotemporal expression pattern of human miRNA gene loci. Several lines of
experimental results have indicated that both polymerase II (Pol-II) and polymerase III (Pol-III) may
be involved in transcribing miRNAs. Here, we assessed the genomic evidence for Alu-directed
transcriptional regulation of some novel miRNA genes in humans. Our data demonstrate that the
expression of these Alu-related miRNAs may be modulated by Pol-III.
Results: We present a comprehensive exploration of the Alu-directed transcriptional regulation
of some new miRNAs. Using a new computational approach, a variety of Alu-related sequences
from multiple sources were pooled and filtered to obtain a subset containing Alu elements and
characterized miRNA genes for which there is clear evidence of full-length transcription
(embedded in EST). We systematically demonstrated that 73 miRNAs including five known ones
may be transcribed by Pol-III through Alu or MIR. Among the new miRNAs, 33 were determined
by high-throughput Solexa sequencing. Real-time TaqMan PCR and Northern blotting verified that
three newly identified miRNAs could be induced to co-express with their upstream Alu transcripts
by heat shock or cycloheximide.
Conclusion: Through genomic analysis, Solexa sequencing and experimental validation, we have
identified candidate sequences for Alu-related miRNAs, and have found that the transcription of
these miRNAs could be governed by Pol-III. Thus, this study may elucidate the mechanisms by
which the expression of a class of small RNAs may be regulated by their upstream repeat elements.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding
RNAs (ncRNAs) about 22 nt in length. They control fundamental cellular activities such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and others in different species by
regulating gene expression [1-3]. Although miRNAs were

discovered more than a decade ago, their transcription
remains insufficiently understood. They are believed to be
transcribed by polymerase II (Pol-II) [4-6]. However, new
research on ncRNA transcription indicates that polymerase III (Pol-III) may participate in this process [7-9]. PolIII is usually recognized as transcribing housekeeping

ncRNAs and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs)
such as tRNAs, 5s-rRNAs and Alu [7,10,11]. In 2004, a
study revealed that the exogenous Pol-III promoter can
initiate miRNA transcription [12]. Since then, several lines
of evidence have shown that Pol-III can transcribe miRNAs downstream of tRNAs, Alu and other SINEs
[7,13,14], but whether this is a common mechanism is
still not clear.
In the haploid human genome of three billion base-pairs,
the sequences of protein-encoding genes constitute about
3%, whereas repeats and transposons constitute up to
45%. Alu elements are among the most abundant transposons, constituting 11% of the human genome [15]. Alu
is about 300 nt in full length, including left and right arms
with Poly A sequences between them and at the end [16].
More importantly, it affects genome recombination, RNA
transcription, alternative splicing, translation, DNA replication and methylation, and other processes [16,17]. Alu
insertion may cause many diseases [18,19]. Therefore, Alu
has gradually attracted more and more attention and has
been extensively studied in relation to transcription. It is
generally believed to be transcribed by Pol-III through
internal promoters, the A box and B box [20,21]. Because
Alu does not code for a terminator, Pol-III usually reads
through its sequence until it reaches a downstream terminator [22,23]. Thus, Pol-III may transcribe sequences
downstream of Alu elements.
Therefore, if miRNAs follow Alu elements closely or reside
within Alu, they are very liable to be transcribed through
Alu by Pol-III. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that
Alu can serve as a promoter for miRNA transcription [14].
It has also been found that Pol-III transcribes small RNAs
through tRNAs or tRNA-like sequences in Trypanosomatid protozoa, nematodes and plants [24-26], while in the
human virus murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68),
Pol-III transcribes downstream miRNAs through tRNA
[13]. tRNAs differ from Alu in sequence but are similar in
transcription. They both have the A box and B box that are
recognized and bound by Pol-III [7,27]. It is reasonable to
presume that Pol-III can transcribe other ncRNAs downstream of Alu elements or other repeats. Taking Alu as an
example, we propose the hypothesis that the transcription
of a class of new miRNA genes can be linked to their
upstream Alu transcription, and on this basis we have
conducted a group of comprehensive studies.

Results
Process of prediction
We investigated the number of miRNAs that may reside
within the region downstream of Alu elements in the
human genome using a newly-developed approach [28].
First, we downloaded all the repeat sequences annotated by
the Repeatmasker from UCSC http://genome.ucsc.edu/,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/563

and from this we extracted about 1,180,972 Alu sequences
and their extensions (200 bp). It is well known that the full
length of Alu is about 300 bp, while sequences that can be
transcribed by Pol-III are about 500 bp [8]. So, a 200 bp
sequence downstream of Alu may be transcribed by Pol-III.
Secondly, all the Alu elements and extended sequences not
collected in EST were filtered. The resulting 86,966
sequences were found to be transcribed. Thirdly, we predicted 259 miRNAs at the threshold value of 7 using the
PriMir software described briefly in the methods section
[28]. Two hundred and nineteen sequences remained after
the elimination of one nucleotide overlapping with the
exon. Alignment of sequences from phylogenetically
related species showed that 60 miRNAs and their upstream
Alu sequences were highly conserved in primates (Additional file 1). Since Alu is conserved only in primates, those
sequences that are conserved between Pan troglodytes and
humans were selected. When sequences with more than
four consecutive Ts (generally known as the Pol-III terminator) between the Alu elements and miRNA genes were
eliminated, 60 sequences remained, as shown in the Additional file 1. The entire process is shown in Figure 1A. The
secondary structures of some pre-miRNA candidates are
illustrated in Figure 1B. Mature miRNA can be generated
from either or both arms of a pre-miRNA.
Analysis of prediction results
Analysis of these 60 sequences indicated that the distribution of Alu length had two peaks, one around 120 nt and
the other around 290 nt (Figure 2B). These sequences
were allocated to two classes: >200 nt, considered the full
length of Alu (Additional file 2); and <200 nt, considered
to be stable Alu segments inserted in the genome (Additional file 3). The number (n = 28) of >200 nt Alu
sequences proved similar to that (n = 32) of the <200 nt
Alu sequences. All the AluSc, AluSg and AluY family
sequences are longer than 200 nt while those of the FLAM
and FRAM families are shorter (Additional file 2 and 3).
AluY is the youngest class of the Alu family; AluSg and
AluSc are the two youngest classes of the AluS family and
are second only to AluY in evolutionary age. FLAM and
FRAM are the oldest Alu families [29]. It has been shown
that in the young families, the sequences and biological
functions of Alu remain comparatively intact, whereas the
sequences of the old families such as FAM and AluJo are
no longer intact and some have even lost their functions
owing to continual mutation during evolutionary history.
In contrast, our observation suggested that both young
and old members of Alu families may be functional
(Additional file 2 and 3). Sequence alignment of the two
groups of data showed that most Alu sequences longer
than 200 nt basically preserved the A box and B box
required for transcription. Only three sequences lacked
the B box (Additional file 2). The sequences shorter than
200 bp were all mapped to the left arm of the consensus

Alu sequence (Additional file 3). Although sequences
shorter than 200 bp no longer had intact A boxes, they
basically retained the B box necessary for transcription, as
shown in Additional file 3. In contrast, both AluS-126274
(id) and AluJ/FLAM-741298 (id) lacked the B box but
retained the A box. It is well known that the A and B
boxes, especially the latter, are the internal promoters for
Alu transcription [20,21]. This is consistent with our prediction results, showing that both short and long
sequences retain the B box. Most of the 60 sequences
retained the A box and B box and some sequences around
those boxes were also highly conserved. Weblogo analysis
(Figure 2C) indicated that the first two nucleotides of the
B box (positions -1 and -2) were highly conserved, and G
in position -2 was observed in almost all sequences. The
sequences following the A box were also found to be similar. For example, positions 11-14 were CTCA in almost all
the Alu >200 nt sequences, suggesting that the motif
around the A box may be important for Alu transcription.

Of the 60 sequences, 14 were located between proteincoding genes, 19 within the antisense strands of introns
and 27 within introns, as shown in Figure 2D. Twentyseven sequences derived from introns could be mapped to
65 different introns, suggesting that their sources are multiple loci.
miRNA verification
Of the 60 Alu-related sequences, only one is a known
miRNA, miR-517a. This has been shown experimentally
to be a functional miRNA that can be transcribed through
its upstream Alu [14]. The other miRNAs were newly predicted. To test whether they can be transcribed, we
assessed the expression of different types of small RNAs in
three different cells. Using high-throughput Solexa technology [30], 4,136,656 total reads and 3,105,897 unique
sequences covering 439 known miRNAs were obtained in
K562 cells (Additional file 4). Twenty new Alu-related
miRNAs were identified. The sequencing results from

human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and human embryoid body cells (hEBCs) showed that the total numbers of
reads in these two cell types were respectively 6,147,718
and 6,014,187, and the numbers of unique sequences
were respectively 5,261,520 and 5,192,421, including 334
known miRNAs ([31]). Another 19 and 10 Alu-related
miRNAs respectively were verified. These data indicate
that miRNAs that may be transcribed through Alu are
abundant in K562 cells and hESCs. Subsequently, the
same sequences from the three cell types were integrated,
and the numbers of corresponding reads were added. A
final total of 24 Alu-related miRNAs were confirmed,
including the known miR-517a (Table 1). Mapping
between the sequences identified and predicted miRNA
genes was shown in Additional file 5. Thus, six newly
identified miRNAs were found to reside between proteincoding genes, eight in the antisense strands of introns and
10 within introns (Figure 2D). It is well known that
miRNA expression is cell/tissue-specific, developmentspecific and disease-specific. It is therefore understanda-

ble that not all the predicted miRNAs are expressed in the
three cell types. If more cell types are used in the future,
more predicted miRNAs will be identified.
The same method was also used to explore other repeats.
MIR belongs to the same SINE family, and was closely followed by candidate miRNA sequences. Besides the four
known miRNAs, a further nine sequences downstream of
MIR were verified (Additional file 6). Although the functions of MIR are not yet established, it may have some
transcriptional activities. Whether MIR can direct the transcription of its downstream miRNAs awaits further study.
Verification of expression
From the sequencing results, three representative
sequences were randomly selected for serial experiments:
AluJb-641, AluJo-576611 and AluJo-135090. AluJo576611 was found to be located in the antisense strand of
TRIM14, AluJo-135090 between protein-encoding genes,
and AluJb-641 within the seventh intron of the gene

encoding mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3B. To
study the relationship between Alu and miRNA expression, we used cycloheximide and heat shock to induce
high expression of full-length Alu RNA [32] and then
determined whether its downstream miRNAs were also
highly expressed. First, Northern blotting was employed
to detect changes in the amount of Alu transcripts (Figure
3A and 3B). The results showed that after cycloheximide
induction, the levels of full-length Alu transcripts in HeLa
and HEK293 cells were elevated 4.7- and 5.1-fold respectively. This observation obtained further support. After
heat shock induction, the content of full length Alu transcripts in HeLa and HEK293 cells were elevated 4.2- and
4.8-fold respectively. Real-time TaqMan PCR was then
used to detect dynamic changes in miRNAs. After
cycloheximide and heat shock induction, small RNAs
were reverse-transcribed with a specific Stem-loop RTprimer and quantified by real-time TaqMan PCR. The
results showed that in HEK293 cells, AluJb-641, AluJo576611 and AluJo-135090 were respectively up-regulated
2.19-, 3.43- and 3.66-fold after cycloheximide induction
(Figure 3D). Similar results were obtained using HeLa
cells (Figure 3E). In contrast, no change in expression of
the control miR-22 was detected, strongly suggesting that
the expression of these miRNAs is closely related to the
expression of their upstream Alu.
To confirm the involvement of Pol-III in miRNA transcription further and exclude the possibility of Pol-IImediated miRNA generation, HeLa cells were treated with
tagetitoxin at a concentration (4 U/ml) that specifically
inhibits Pol-III transcription [33]. As shown in Figure 3F,
the levels of mature AluJb-641, AluJo-576611 and AluJo135090 was dramatically enhanced in heat-treated cells,
while the level of let-7a, used as a Pol-III negative control,
remained unchanged. More importantly, tagetitoxin specifically inhibited Pol-III and resulted in failure to detect
mature AluJb-641, AluJo-576611 and AluJo-135090
bands in the 22 nt marker region. However, the transcription of let-7a, which is driven by Pol-II, was not affected
by tagetitoxin. This suggests that the transcription of some
miRNAs can be regulated by Pol-III and supports our
hypothesis that Alu elements may be the promoter specific for nearby downstream ncRNAs.
To clarify whether such intron-derived miRNAs can be coexpressed when their host genes are transcribed, we investigated the expression profiles of AluJb-641 and its host
gene. The former was found to reside within the seventh
intron of ATAD3B, which encodes a mitochondrial membrane protein. This intron was 2,401 bp in full length and
AluJb-641 was located at locus 192. RT-PCR showed that
expression of the host gene was not enhanced by heat
shock or cycloheximide stimulation (Figure 3C), which
generally induce high expression of Alu and AluJb-641
(Figure 3A). Thus, AluJb-641 may not be co-expressed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/563

with its host gene, but along with the expression of its
upstream Alu. Our results also showed that ATAD3B was
not co-expressed with Alu.
Identification of a conserved element
Multiple sequence comparisons among three Alus used in
this study and AluSg/x-1110454, which resides upstream
of miR-517a, revealed that the sequence GAGGCTGAGG
was very highly conserved (Figure 4A). Further careful
comparison between the sequence GAGGCTGAGG and
the consensus sequences of various Alu families revealed
that almost all Alu sequences, long or short, contained
this sequence. The alignment of Alu sequences (Additional file 2) showed that this motif existed in all the predicted sequences of more than 200 nt (Figure 4B). This
suggests that it is highly conserved and may play an
important role in Alu transcription or enhance its functions, especially when the A box and/or B box is not intact
or deficient.

Discussion
The effect of Alu on other ncRNAs has rarely been studied.
In recent years, as ncRNA research has progressed rapidly,
more and more repeats have been found to be important
for gene transcription. Dieci et al. comprehensively summarized the evidence that Pol-III may transcribe their
downstream sequences through tRNAs, repeats or ncRNAs
[7]. On the basis of previous studies, we hereby propose
the hypothesis that some short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) without terminator sequences may trigger
the transcription of their downstream miRNAs. Guided by
this hypothesis, we investigated the mechanism of miRNA
transcription through Alu (Figure 2A). We not only predicted 60 Alu-related miRNAs that might be transcribed
through Alu, including the previously reported miR-517a,
but also identified 23 of them by Solexa sequencing. More
importantly, using induction by heat shock and cycloheximide, we showed that the expression of Alu RNAs was
consistent with the expression of three miRNAs downstream of those elements, providing clear-cut evidence
that transcription of some miRNAs may be initiated by
Alu transcription.
Recently, studies on miRNA transcription by two different
groups have indicated that Pol-II or Pol-III is associated
with miR-517a transcription [14,34]. RNA Pol-I is known
to be insensitive to α-amanitin; RNA Pol-II is very sensitive to it and RNA Pol-III moderately sensitive. In order to
evade the ambiguous effects of α-amanitin, we used tagetitoxin as a specific Pol-III inhibitor [33]. As expected, our
results showed that tagetitoxin significantly repressed the
expression of Pol-III-mediated miRNAs, but did not affect
the transcription of the Pol-II-driven let-7a. Considered
together, the inhibitors used for Pol-III may be a key factor
in the differences among research results. Although only
the example of Alu RNA has been investigated in this artiPage 6 of 13

cle, we cannot exclude the possibility that other SINEs
play the same role as Alu, because some known and predicted miRNAs were also found downstream of MIR
(Additional file 5). Transcription of these miRNAs seems
likely to depend on key sequences such as A/B boxes or
other motifs embedded within Alu elements.
Other members of the SINE family, in addition to Alu, all
originate from tRNAs and have a classical structure comprising the following three parts: first, a promoter transformed from tRNA; second, a sequence specific for the
SINE; third, a sequence needed for reverse transcription,
similar to the 3' end of LINE and simple repeats [8,35].
While the other SINE family members have mostly
evolved from tRNAs, they are different from Alu in structure but very similar in transcription. It is generally
believed that in both tRNAs and SINEs, the A box and B
box within the left arm are used to regulate transcription.
Of these two boxes, the box B may play a decisive role
[7,20,21,27]. Therefore, the transcription of SINE elements is also very likely to trigger the expression of their
downstream small RNAs.
However, among the three newly identified miRNAs that
have transcriptional activity and are co-expressed with Alu
elements, only AluJo-576611 and AluJo-135090 contain
the classic B box, and AluJb-641 has no B box; neither has
the upstream AluSg/x-1110454, which has been shown to
be able to transcribe miR-517a. Even though AluSg/x1110454 was mapped to the left arm of the uniform
sequence of Alu in our multiple sequencing alignments,
its B box was severely mutated. In the B box, the critical
nucleotides are the first locus G and the third locus T, but
the third locus of AluSg/x-1110454 is G. In the multiple
sequencing alignments, one motif, GAGGCTGAGG, was
found to be highly conserved. It is present not only in
these four sequences but also in uniform sequences of all
Alu family members. This motif may be of great significance for the transcription of Alu and its downstream
miRNAs, or have a similar function to the B box in regulating Alu transcription. However, this possibility still
awaits further study.
When miRNAs were discovered, they were originally
thought to have nothing to do with repeats. For example,
when miRNAs were predicted, Alu-related repeats were
first filtered out. Nonetheless, it has been found over the
past two years that miRNAs and repeats are closely interrelated. miRNAs are very likely to originate from repeats
and may interact with repeats, or with mRNAs with
related repeats embedded in their 3'UTR regions [36-38].
Repeats are now known to be able to direct transcription
of miRNAs. Considering these findings together, we
believe that with further studies, a regulatory network
constituted by miRNAs, repeats and target RNAs will be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/563

unveiled layer by layer, enhancing our understanding of
the nature of life.

Conclusion
We identified a kind of new miRNAs closely downstream
of repeat elements, and found that Pol-III could be
involved in transcribing these miRNAs through Alu. Our
results elucidated the mechanisms of the Alu-directed
transcriptional regulation of some miRNAs and revealed
that miRNAs and repeats might be closely interrelated.

Gene Prediction Tracks, EST from mRNA and EST tracks.
All data were saved in the bed format and uploaded to
Galaxy http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/ for analysis. In view of
our knowledge that pre-miRNAs may be located immediately downstream of SINEs, Pol-III-transcribed sequences
are usually less than 500 bp in length and most SINE elements are less than 300 bp, we extended 200 bp downstream of SINEs as our initial sequences for predicting
candidate miRNA genes.

Human Genome (hg18) and Primate Genome (panTro2)
were also downloaded from UCSC using FTP to prepare
for conservation analysis.
The consensus sequences of different primate SINE families were downloaded from giri http://www.girinst.org/.
Filtering by ESTs
To ensure the SINEs were expressed, we compared all
SINEs and extended sequences with ESTs. Although most
ESTs are transcribed by Pol-II [39], the discovery of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) has led to the inclusion of expressed
sequences transcribed by other polymerases in the EST
database. Umylny et al. found that 452 Alu ncRNAs
longer than 200 bp and probably transcribed by Pol-III
are also listed in dbEST [40]. We used a similar method to
filter our data except for the differences in SINE lengths. If
both SINEs and extended sequences were collected among
ESTs, we took them as sequences that are potentially still
active.
Prediction of pre-miRNAs
The software PriMir, developed by us [28], was used to
predict miRNAs by the following procedure. First, we created a training data set using known miRNAs and a background data set, using hairpins, extracted from 200 bp
extended sequences. Secondly, 11 secondary structure features of known pre-miRNAs were used as screening criteria: (1) the total number of paired bases in the 10-bp up-

and down-stream extensions of the pre-miRNA; (2) its
total bulge size; (3) the total number of paired bases in it;
(4) the length of its loop; (5) the distance between the
mature miRNA and the terminal loop; (6) the sequence

bias of the first five bases in the mature miRNA; (7) the
total number of paired bases in the mature miRNA portion of the pre-miRNA; (8) the minimum free energy
(mfe) of the pre-miRNA stem-loop calculated using the

RNAfold program; (9) the length of the pre-miRNA; (10)
its GC content; and (11) the GC content of the mature
miRNA. Using these 11 features, we constructed a PMS
matrix. For each entry in the matrix, we calculated the
ratio between the frequencies of each feature value in the
training and background sets. All entries were calculated
according to the definition of (Aij). For a given feature i
with value j, fi (j) and hi (j) are the frequencies of this feature in the training and background sets, respectively. Xi is
the feature value set of feature i. If a given j value belongs
to Xi, Aij is defined as the log2 of fi (j)/hi (j). Otherwise, Aij
is assigned the minimum value of Ai xi. Then we used
PriMir to predict a potential pre-miRNA candidate and
calculate a PriMir score from the PMS matrix. The PriMir
score value S is defined as the sum of the scores of all features for a given hairpin: Here xi is the value of feature i.

S=

∑

Ai x i

i =1K11

Thirdly, we folded the 200 bp extended sequences and
extracted pre-miRNA candidates from them on the basis
of the 11 features. The reliability of PriMir prediction was
evaluated by cross-validation. The training and background sets used to establish the PMS Matrix were divided
into five equal parts. Four parts were selected to establish
the PMS Matrix, and the remaining part (from both training and background sets) was used to test the performance
of PriMir by the ROC curve. The above analysis was
repeated five times, each time using a different portion of
the data as test data set. A PriMir score of "7" was used as
cutoff value. This is a stringent criterion, as ROC curve
analysis of the performance of PriMir indicates that the
AUC (area under curve) is approximately 0.99, and that
the false positive rate is 0 at a PriMir score of 7. Comparisons between PriMir and three other algorithms [41-43]
suggested that PriMir was at least equal to and in some
respects outperformed those three methods. In addition,
we used EST and conservation to filter the initial results,
which made our results more convincing. The Accession
Numbers for the 24 Alu-related miRNAs deposited at
Gene Bank are FJ601661 to FJ601684.
Conservation analysis
Because Alus are primate-specific repeats and there is only
one primate genome, panTro2, in UCSC, we only examined conservation between Pan troglodytes and human. In
order to find highly conserved miRNAs, we only considered the miRNA candidates with more than 96% similarity to those in Pan troglodytes. The lengths of these premiRNA candidates in human should be more than 90%
of those in Pan troglodytes.

We used a similar criterion to find other conserved
sequences in SINEs located upstream of pre-miRNAs. The

criteria for selection were that the lengths of conserved
repeat sequences in Pan troglodytes must be more than
90% of those in human and the corresponding similarity
must also exceed 90%. If both SINEs and the corresponding pre-miRNAs were conserved and the distance between
them was less than 200 nt, we took the pre-miRNAs as our
candidates.
Filtering the candidates
If repeats are expressed in exons of protein-coding genes,
they probably do not function as pre-miRNA promoters.
Few miRNAs so far known are present in exons, so we filtered out those predicted miRNAs and SINEs that overlapped with exons.

Since more than four Ts between a predicted pre-miRNA
and SINE are highly likely to intervene in the transcription
of long sequences, we deleted each predicted sequence
with more than four Ts between the pre-miRNA and SINE.
Cell culture
HeLa and HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). The cells were cultured in
DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin
and 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For heat shock
experiments, cells were heated in 75 cm2 flasks containing
10 ml medium in a 45°C water bath. After 30 min heat
shock, they were incubated at 37°C for 1 h before total
RNA was extracted. For cycloheximide treatment, the cells
were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide.
The incubation time was 3 h for HeLa cells and 6 h for
HEK293 cells prior to total RNA extraction.
Inhibitors of transcription
Tagetitoxin, a specific inhibitor of RNA Pol-III, was
obtained from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI).
HeLa cells were treated with 120 μmol/l tagetitoxin for
one day and then by heat shock as described above. Total
RNA was extracted from tagetitoxin-treated and untreated
cells. Mature miRNA was isolated and amplified by realtime PCR as described below. The effects of tagetitoxin on
in vivo transcription were assessed by Northern blotting.
Inhibition of RNA Pol-III was evaluated by the levels of
transcription of three Alu-associated miRNAs, with Let-7a
as a negative control.
Small RNA cloning and sequencing
We employed Illumina sequencing methods as described
previously. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from human
cells with Trizol, and the small RNAs were size-fractionated, purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) to enrich for molecules in the range 18-30 nt, and
ligated sequentially to 5'- and 3'-end RNA oligonucleotide
adapters. The samples were used as templates for cDNA

synthesis. The cDNA was amplified over 15-18 PCR cycles
to produce sequencing libraries using Illumina's small
RNA primer set. The purified PCR products were subjected
to Solexa's proprietary sequencing-by-synthesis method
on the Illumina 1G Genome Analyzer. All sequencing
services were provided by the Beijing Genomics Institute,
Shenzhen http://www.genomics.org.cn and the Genome
Sciences Centre, Vancouver. Raw data from IlluminaGA
were processed using the initial stages of the Solexa software pipeline (Illumina). Low quality reads were trimmed
using perl script. Adaptor sequences were accurately
clipped using a dynamic programming algorithm. After
redundancy was removed, sequences ≥ 18 nt were
mapped to the human genome (UCSC hg18) using SOAP.
Small RNA sequences were mapped to human shRNA
hairpins by BLAST. The count sum of all isoforms of a
shRNA gene was used to measure its expression level.
Reverse transcriptase reactions
Total cellular RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Reverse transcriptase reactions contained 1 μg purified
total RNA, 50 nM stem-loop RT primer (Applied Biosystems), 1× RT Buffer, 0.25 mM each dNTP, 5 U/μl M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Promega) and 0.25 U/μl RNase
inhibitor (Promega). The mixtures were incubated in a
thermocycler for 30 min at 16°C, 30 min at 42°C and 10
min at 85°C, then held at 4°C. All reverse transcriptase
reactions, including controls, were run in triplicate.
Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was performed using a standard TaqMan
MicroRNA Assay kit protocol on a Roter-Gene 6000 (Corbett) Sequence Detection System. The 20 μl PCR reactions
included 1 μl RT product, 1× Real-time PCR Master Mix
including TaqMan probe, 0.15 μM miRNA specific primer
set. The mixtures were incubated at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 40 s. All
reactions were run in triplicate. The threshold cycle (CT)
was defined as the fractional cycle number at which the
fluorescence passed the fixed threshold. TaqMan CT val-

ues were converted to absolute copy numbers using a
standard curve from synthetic miRNA Standard.
Northern blotting
Total RNA was separated by 8% urea PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham). The
membrane was UV crosslinked, dried thoroughly at 80°C
and incubated with hybridization solution (6×SSC,
5×Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml Yeast RNA) and
probes labeled with [γ-32P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide
kinase. After 20 h hybridization at 58°C, the membrane
was washed twice at room temperature and once at the
hybridization temperature with 20×SSC and 0.1% SDS.
Let-7a was taken as a loading and negative control. The
bands were autoradiographed and quantified with a
Typhoon 9410 Phosphorlmager (GE Healthcare) (Table
2).
