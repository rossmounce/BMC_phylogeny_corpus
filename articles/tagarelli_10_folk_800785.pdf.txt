Folk medicine used to heal malaria in Calabria
(southern Italy)
Giuseppe Tagarelli*, Antonio Tagarelli, Anna Piro

Abstract
In Italy, malaria was an endemic disease that was eradicated by the mid-20th century. This paper evaluates the
prophylactic and therapeutic remedies used by folk medicine to cure malaria in Calabria (southern Italy).
The data has been collected by analysing works of physicians, ethnographers, folklorists and specialists of the study
of Calabrian history between the end of the 19th century and the 20th century. The data collected have allowed
us to describe the most common cures used by the Calabrian people to treat malaria and the most evident symptoms of this disease, such as intermittent fever, hepato-spleenomegaly, asthenia and dropsy. This approach uncovered a heterogeneous corpus of empirical, magical and religious remedies, which the authors have investigated as
evidences of past “expert medicine” and to verify their real effectiveness in the treatment of malaria.
Background
Malaria is an infectious disease that is caused by the
Plasmodium parasite. This disease is transmitted to
humans via the Anopheles mosquito. Malaria is a very
ancient disease, and although it was not possible to
prove its presence in ancient human bones, this disease
was probably present among Homo genus ancestors [1].
Different populations, such as the Sumerians, AssyrianBabylonians, Indians, Egyptians and Chinese, experienced seasonal and intermittent fevers [2]. In the
Mediterranean area, particularly in Italy, malaria was an
endemic disease that was eradicated by the mid-20th
century. Moreover, the persistent and lasting presence
of malaria determined an interesting state of debility of
the affected subjects and a consequent weakening of the
labour force, which led to some important and detrimental socio-economic consequences [3]. Folk medicine
approaches were used in an attempt to treat several of
the most evident effects of malaria, such as intermittent
fever, hepato-spleenomegaly, asthenia and dropsy.
It is our aim in this work to identify folk medical
cures that were used by the Calabrian people for the
treatment of malaria, as evidenced in writings produced
between the 19th and 20th centuries. The authors have
also examined whether same remedies were already
described by Pliny the Elder, Dioscorides, Galen and

Serenus Sammonicus, so to be considered as evidence of
past “expert medicine”.

Area of Study
It is interesting to point out that in some peninsular and
insular areas of Italy, despite all the drainage attempts
initiated in the 16th century, malaria-associated mortality was only recently eradicated in the mid-20th century
(Figure 1) [4]. Among the southern regions of Italy,
Calabria was one of the regions that was most affected
by malaria. The disease was endemic along its coasts
(about 738 km), along its most important rivers
(Mesima, Lao, Crati, Tacina and Neto) and within the
valleys of its broad streams. The disease was prevalent
in 52% of the Calabrian territory (7,877.31/15,080.32
km2) (Figure 2) [5]. Calabria showed both natural and
antropic factors that favoured the spread of Plasmodium, as well as the endemic and century-old presence
of malaria in its territory. Physical features that may
have affected the spreading of malaria are represented
by a rich hydrographic reticle and the occurrence of
seismic phenomena (bradyseisms and earthquakes),
which, at that time, contributed to increase the hydrogeological disorder, thus creating many different wet
areas (for example, the single earthquake of 1783 created about 215 lakes), which are the favourite environment of the anopheles mosquito [6]. The antropic
factors are represented fundamentally by latifundia,

deforestation and the very poor social and economic
conditions of the rural Calabrian people [7].
Calabria is the southernmost region of peninsular Italy;
it borders with the Ionian Sea to the east and south, with
the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west, and with the region Basilicata to the north, and it extends for about 250 km from
north to south in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.
Calabria reaches 15,080 km2 and 42% of its territory is
represented by mountains: the Apennine mountain
range - the southern Apennines, calcareous, with Pollino
Massif (Serra Dolcedorme, 2267 m a.s.l.)- and the
Calabrian Apennines, mainly siliceous - with the Coastal
Range (M. Cocuzzo,1541 m a.s.l.), Sila Massif (M. Botte
Donato,1929 m a.s.l.), Serre Calabre (M. Pecoraro, 1423
m a.s.l.) and Aspromonte Massif (Montalto, 1956 m a.s.
l.)-. 49% of Calabria’s territory is represented by hills and
only 9% is flat. The plains are restricted to coastal areas
and only three plains extend into the internal areas of the
territory (Sibari plain, Saint’Eufemia plain and Gioia
Tauro plain).
The climate is Mediterranean, with maximum precipitation during the winter and minimum in the summer
and vice versa for the temperature. Precipitation is
represented by about 1,041 mm of rainfall per year. The
average temperature in the coldest month (January) is
about 8.3°C and the warmest month (August) about
24.4°C, with an annual average of 15.8°C [8]. However
strong meso-climatic variations occur depending on

altitude, topographic features and location with respect
to the sea.
From both an anthropological and an ethnobotanical
point of view, Calabria is an interesting region, for the
historical presence of several populations (Greeks,
Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans and Spanish) in
the past that influenced the local culture [9]. Finally, it
is interesting to note that the Arbëreshe community, of
Albanian origins, settled in this region since the 16th
century and is currently located in 25 communes in the
provinces of Cosenza, Catanzaro and Crotone [10].

Methods
This study is based on the analysis of works written by
physicians, ethnographers, folklorists and specialists of the
study of Calabrian history between the end of the 19th
century and the 20th century, in particular when both ethnographic and anthropological research focused on the

study of folk medicine. For this reason, the authors have
also consulted the check-lists about works on calabrian
folk medicine and beliefs, edited by Lombardi Satriani [11]
and Cavalcanti [12]. The sources used in this work are
listed in Table 1. The data collected has allowed us to
describe the cures used by the Calabrian people to treat
malaria and its most evident symptoms, such as intermittent fever, hepato-spleenomegaly, asthenia and dropsy.
This approach uncovered a heterogeneous corpus of
empirical, magical and religious remedies, which the
authors have investigated as an “official medicine” to cure
malaria in the treatises by Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia) [13-15], Dioscorides (De Materia Medica) [16],
Galen (Opera Omnia) [17-21] and by Serenus Sammonicus (Liber Medicinalis) [22]. These authors, in fact, have
influenced medical practice in latter centuries [23].
The plants used by Calabrian people to cure malaria
(N = 53) have been identified as species because the

sources described them with their scientific name (34%
of cases, 18/53), or with their Italian name (60% of
cases, 32/53). In the latter case, we attributed a plant to
a species only if we were absolutely sure about it (for
example “olivo” (olive) = Olea europaea L.); in the other
cases we classified the plants only through their genus
(for example “quercia” (oak) = Quercus spp.). Furthermore, due to the presence of different dialects in Northern, Central and Southern Calabria, the analysis of the
different historical sources required the use of two historical dictionaries of Calabrian dialects [24,25], which
were used to translate several ancient terms (that are
not used today) into Italian in 4% of cases (2/53). This
has allowed us to attribute the local name “vruca” to the
genus Tamarix spp., while it has not allowed us (2% of
cases, 1/53) to attribute the local name “catabuzzico”
[26] to any genus. Finally, the plants used to cure
malaria in Calabria (N = 52) have been compared with
their pharmacological and biological properties [27-48]
and with their current use in Calabrian folk medicine,
defined by recent fieldworks [49-51] [Table 2].
The family names of the plants recorded in this work
follow the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group guidelines [52].

Results
Empirical remedies

The empirical remedies that were used by the Calabrian
people, as evidenced by the sources consulted in this
work, were used both prophylactically and therapeutically, and were based on drinks, objects, animals, plants
and other sources; some of these elements were created
ex novo, while others were inherited from the “official”
medicine of 1th-3th century AD [Tables 3 and 4].
Empirical prophylactic remedies. One of the most
commonly used prophylactic empirical remedies was
bleeding (which was already described by Galen that
affirmed “Saluberrimum igitur, ut praediximus, est in
febribus venam incidere” (during the fever, as mentioned, it is very useful to incise a vein) (De Methodo
Medendi XI, 15) [17]. Bleeding was performed preventively by “barbieri” (barbers) and “magare” (witches) during the month of March [53]. During the same period
(when the cure was called “marziale”), Calabrian people
drank different types of decoctions, such as those made
with “durcamara” (Solanum dulcamara L.), “acropastu”
(Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.), “strazza buttuni” (Smilax
aspera L.) and “fumaria” (Fumaria officinalis L.) [11,54].
To prevent contagion of the disease during the night in
the summer months, people slept for few hours and
near a fire [54-56]. Moreover, they drank strong spirits
or wine. In particular, they were advised to drink half a
litre of wine on an empty stomach [57,58], eat garlic
(Allium sativum L.) [59], smoke and chew tobacco and

Page 4 of 16

swallow the spittle [56,60], while always maintaining the
pipe in the mouth [54-56]. On awaking, it was recommended to eat a macerate of raw garlic in vinegar [54].
Finally, people living on the coast used to spread olive
oil mixed with absinth on their bodies, according to
Dioscorides who affirmed “Itemque ex oleo perunctum,
culices abigere, ne corpus tangant“ (Rubbed on with oil
it forbids the mosquitos to touch the body) De Materia
Medica, III, 23) [16,61] and according to Pliny “culices
ex oleo perunctis abigit” (who use this oil keep mosquitos away), Naturalis Historia XXVII, 28) [13].
Empirical therapeutical remedies. Fasting and
purging were recommended for the treatment of
malaria-associated fevers. Fasting was thought to
appease fever, while purging was thought to remove
the malaria-causing parasite from the affected organism. In general, purging was achieved via the administration of ricinus seeds (Ricinus communis L.) and by
using the root of “savucu” (Sambucus nigra L.) [26].
Fasting and purging were inherited from Galenic medicine. Galen wrote the following about fasting: “(in tertiariis) ... neque quotidie cibum dare oportet, sed
alternis diebus abunde fuerit“ (with tertian fevers ...
food must not be offered every day, but on alternate
days) (Ad Glauconem de medendi methodo I, 11) [18];
and about purging: “ac vacuatio quidem excrementorum omni febri est utilissima“ (during the fever, no
doubt, it is very useful to defecate) (Methodo medendi
IX, 10) [17]. Other treatments aimed at purging and
restoring the affected subjects were also used. These
included the decoction of “gamumilla” (Matricaria
chamomilla L), “ordica” (Urtica dioica L., Urtica urens
L.), and the decoction of the root of “alivu” (Olea europaea L.) or of the rhizome of “canna” (Arundo donax
L.) [26,62,63]. Several empirical therapeutic remedies
against malaria-associated fevers were loathsome.
These included the ingestion of the subject’s own
urine, that of young virgin or that of a healthy woman
(in particular, the affected subject was advised to drink
100 g of the urine of a non-affected woman early in
the morning) [55-57,64], the consumption of various
animals (or parts of animals), such as earthworms
(Lumbricus terrestris) which were previously placed in
the oven and pulverized, or two or three bedbugs
(Cimex lecturalius) within a Host [56,58,64]. Moreover,
patients were encouraged to eat pills of “pappici“ (cobweb) [26,56,63-66], the head of a viper (Vipera aspis),
fried and mixed with absinth [55], goat (Capra hircus)
dung within a Host, eaten from morning until midday
[26,57], one spoonful of coffee per hour [57]
and pills of soot [67,68]. Alternatively, to cure hepato-spleenomegaly were used hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) or ox (Bos taurus) gall and goat (Capra hircus)

Calabrian people believed without any doubt in the
remedies described above; however, they also used
numerous plants to cure malaria. Some of these plants
are still currently used in Calabrian folk medicine to cure
various diseases [Table 1]. Many decoctions or infusions
of various herbaceous species were used to cure malariaassociated fevers. These herbaceous plants included
“issopu” (Hyssopus officinalis L.), “valariana” (Valeriana
officinalis L.), “filici masculu” (Dryopteris filix-mas (L.)
Schott.), “lupinu” (Lupinus albus L.), “cametriu” (Teucrium chamaedrys L.), “brundulija” (Erythraea centaurium (L.) Borkh.), “centu gruppa” (Centaurea centaurium

“cucumele”, “cerza” and “salici” (Salix spp.) was also used
[24,26,55,58,62,65,68,69,72,73].
Other remedies were similarly efficacious; these included
the mesocarp of “nuci” (Juglans regia L.) chopped finely
and mixed with wine, “bergamotto” (Citrus bergamia
Risso), “limuni” (Citrus limonum Risso, which was broken,
boiled and maintained fresh overnight, then drunk at

seeds of decorticated “lupinu” (Lupinus albus L.), taken in
the morning [11,56,58,60,62-65,68,74,75].
Other than fever, the most evident symptoms of
malaria are hepato-spleenomegaly and dropsy. We also
found descriptions of several remedies for these symptoms. There were many cures for hepato-spleenomegaly:
a decoction of the root of “chiappara” (Capparis spinosa
L.), or of “acropistu” (Urtica dioica L., Urtica urens L.),
the latter taken together with potassium nitrate in the
morning; eating “cipuddra” (Allium cepa L.) or “pipi”

(Capsicum annuum L. Var. acuminatum Fing.), the latter together with a strong wine. Finally, another remedy
involved the use of “cucumaju” (Chelidonium majus L.)
[55-57,60,63,68,76].
To treat dropsy, which was called “acqua ‘ntà panza”
(water in the stomach), Calabrian people used several
diuretic remedies, such as “erba i muru” (Parietaria officinalis L.), “cipuddazza” (Urginea maritima (L.) Baker), and
“cametriu” (Teucrium chamaedrys L.) [11,26,55,56,62,66].
Magic remedies

Because of the presence of malaria in the daily lives of
Calabrian people, this disease was considered a normal
life trouble; however, its most dangerous and deadly
forms were considered by Calabrian people as a condition of supernatural nature. Therefore, they resorted to
magic remedies that were believed to “link” the disease.
These included, in particular, wearing a “nuci trischéra

o a tri guarri” (a three-valve walnut shell) (Juglans regia
L.), a spider that was enclosed between two shells of a
walnut or skin, skeleton and fangs of snake, the latter
extracted when animal was still alive, as it was believed
that the disease would then affect the walnut, the spider
or the parts of the snake, and not the subjects who
wore these amulets [65,77]. Furthermore, a live “carpurita” (Pachyiulus communis) was sewn into the clothes of
the affected subject (without the patient realizing it) or
a “paletta” (Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill.) was placed
near the fireplace. It was believed that when the animal
died, or when the stem of the plant dried, the fever or
the hepato-spleenomegaly would disappear [26,60]. In
an analogy with the ancient belief in the therapeutic
principle of “contact”, to defeat spleenomegaly Calabrians were encouraged to place “erba i la crucivia” (Verbena officinalis L.) on the abdomen of the affected
subject before sleeping, as it would absorb the “bad

Tagarelli et al. Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2010, 6:27
http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/6/1/27

blood” [56,57,62]. Finally, every morning the affected
subject had to urinate on “cucuzzielli acriesti maturi”,
the fruits of Ecballium elaterium (L.) A. Rich., to transfer the disease from the subject to the fruit [57].
Religious remedies

Calabrian people alternated or combined both empirical
and magical remedies and, very often, used prayers and
acts of devotion, as diseases were believed to be associated to divine punishment. Thus, in Cosenza (Northern Calabria) the “Madonna della Febbre” was invoked
with prayers, ex voto and pilgrimages [78]; in Castrovillari (province of Cosenza), the prayer to the “Madonna
d’Itria” was as follows: “Madonna mia ‘i L’Itria, chi stai
‘nganna a’sta jumara fammi passà ‘sta freva ‘i quartana
c’u jurnu tuju non vugghiu mangià panu“ ("My Lady of
Itria, close to the river, let the fever out and on your
commemoration day I will not eat bread”) [79].

Discussion
The methodology based on the analysis of historical
sources regarding Calabrian folk medicine remedies for
the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria, if not compared with similar studies, can be considered a case
study where the ordinary methodologies of ethno-medical-biological research are combined with the methodologies pertaining to historical-anthropological sciences.
In addition, this is part of a debate regarding the association between ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology
and other disciplines, to improve our understanding of
the human usage of plants [80]. Moreover, this work
complies with De Natale et al. [81], who created a database of the historical use of plants in the popular medicine of the Mediterranean basin. However, this study
has revealed some interesting and heterogeneous features regarding Calabrian popular medicine practices
used to prevent and treat malaria, some of which were
inherited by the Calabrian people from the “expert medicine” of the past centuries.
The first type of practices that we have described were
characterized by a rational approach. Indeed, the use of
medicinal plants, 69% of which (36/52) is recognized by
the current pharmacopoeia as having some pharmacological/biological properties, succeeded in assuaging temporarily the most evident sufferings associated with the
disease (fever, hepato-spleenomegaly, asthenia and
dropsy) as well as its complications, such as the proneness to bacterial infections, even if did not cure the
malarial infection. 23% (12/52) of the plants which were
used by Calabrian people to treat malaria, have pharmacological/biological properties which did not allow to
relieve the symptoms of malaria; however, they did not
damage the affected subjects. Finally, 8% (4/52) of these
plants were characterized by some pharmacological/

Page 14 of 16

biological properties which could be harmful for a
malarial subject; or these properties could even be poisonous both for the malarial and the healthy subject.
The second type of practices were linked to the magic
tradition of Calabrian folk medicine which, like the traditions of all Southern Italian regions, is rich in myths,
symbolism and fantastic representations [82]. Thus,
malaria became a synonym of “malia”, or, as Pasquarelli
[83] affirmed, it became “an aspect of paludism”. Malaria
was thought to be a consequence of a malefic element
that affected the behaviour and the life of an individual;
therefore, only a magic cure could remedy the disease.
The third type of practices were characterized by a
strong principle of ineluctability, which is currently present among the Calabrian society: the sick entrusted
God with prayers or acts of devotion, with the conviction that only God would be able to provide recovery
from the disease.

Conclusions
The use of plants combined with other cures, such as
the use of spiders, cantharis and leeches, represents prophylactic or therapeutic elements inherited from ancient
medical science, some of which were still used to treat
malaria in hospitals and in general by 19th-century physicians, before the introduction of quinine. This element
is very interesting; while the empirical and magic remedies were not based on the symptomatology of the disease (they were rather “psychological and protective”
elements [82]), the use of plants represented a real treatment, and served as a popular medicine base to treat
various diseases.
In conclusion, the remedies described in this work
allow us to establish the link between malaria and
Calabrian people, so that Turner’s statement that “the
more widely or intensively a plant is used, the greater is
its cultural significance” [84] can, in this case, be
extended to malaria; the more folk remedies are used to
cure malaria, the greater is the significance of its historical, medical and social meaning.
