Background: Several prokaryotic plasmids maintain themselves in their hosts by means of diverse
post-segregational cell killing systems. Recent findings suggest that chromosomally encoded copies
of toxins and antitoxins of post-segregational cell killing systems - such as the RelE system - might
function as regulatory switches under stress conditions. The RelE toxin cleaves ribosomeassociated transcripts, whereas another post-segregational cell killing toxin, ParE, functions as a
gyrase inhibitor.

Conclusions: The tightly maintained gene neighborhoods of post-segregational cell killing-related
systems appear to have evolved by in situ displacement of genes for toxins or antitoxins by
functionally equivalent but evolutionarily unrelated genes. We predict that the novel postsegregational cell killing-related systems containing a PilT-N terminal domain toxin and the
eukaryotic nonsense-mediated RNA decay system are likely to function via a common mechanism,
in which the PilT-N terminal domain cleaves ribosome-associated transcripts. The core of the
eukaryotic nonsense-mediated RNA decay system has probably evolved from a post-segregational
cell killing-related system.

Results: Using sequence profile analysis we were able unify the RelE- and ParE-type toxins with
several families of small, uncharacterized proteins from diverse bacteria and archaea into a single
superfamily. Gene neighborhood analysis showed that the majority of these proteins were encoded
by genes in characteristic neighborhoods, in which genes encoding toxins always co-occurred with
genes encoding transcription factors that are also antitoxins. The transcription factors
accompanying the RelE/ParE superfamily may belong to unrelated or distantly related superfamilies,
however. We used this conserved neighborhood template to transitively search genomes and
identify novel post-segregational cell killing-related systems. One of these novel systems, observed
in several prokaryotes, contained a predicted toxin with a PilT-N terminal (PIN) domain, which is
also found in proteins of the eukaryotic nonsense-mediated RNA decay system. These searches
also identified novel transcription factors (antitoxins) in post-segregational cell killing systems.
Furthermore, the toxin Doc defines a potential metalloenzyme superfamily, with novel
representatives in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, that probably acts on nucleic acids.

Background

Post-segregational cell killing (PSK) is a widespread mechanism that aids several plasmids to maintain themselves in
their bacterial hosts [1-4]. Operons containing genes for
interacting toxin-antitoxin (T-A) pairs that are borne on these
plasmids, are the basis for PSK. Typically, the first gene in
these operons encodes a labile antitoxin, which also acts as a
transcriptional regulator of the operon, while the second gene
encodes a stable toxin. Usually, the antitoxin forms a physical
complex with the toxin and neutralizes its action. A variation
on this theme is seen in the form of the unstable anti-sense
RNAs, which act as inhibitors of translation of the toxin
mRNAs. If the plasmid is lost, the antitoxin is rapidly
degraded while the stable toxin lingers on, killing cells that
lack the plasmid. Thus, plasmids with systems for PSK cause
their host cells to become addicted to them [1-4]. Additionally, several of these T-A systems are also found on prokaryotic chromosomes, where they may have alternative regulatory
functions [5].
A systematic survey of such T-A operons and their mechanisms was presented in the seminal work of Gerdes in 2000
[6]. Subsequently, there have also been some important studies that have elucidated the biochemical details regarding the
action of several toxins. One of these toxins, ParE, was shown
to act as an inhibitor of the DNA gyrase, and it induced formation of DNA-gyrase covalent complexes, which could inhibit
replication and damage the integrity of the chromosome [7].
In contrast, the RelE and Doc toxins were shown to be inhibitors of translation [5,8]. More recently, it was demonstrated
that the RelE protein cleaved transcripts associated with the
ribosome, by specifically targeting codons associated with the
ribosomal A-site [9]. RelE displays codon-specificity by
showing highest preference for UAG among the stop codons
and UCG and CAG among the sense codons [9]. Interestingly,
this inhibition of translation by RelE is reversed by the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), which acts as a regulator of
protein stability in bacteria [10]. These studies have also suggested that the chromosomal versions of these antitoxintoxin pairs could function as regulatory switches that control
gene expression under poor growth conditions.
Although Gerdes proposed that all T-A operons could have a
common origin [6], an objective evaluation of the evolutionary relationships of these proteins and the origin of these systems has not been conducted. The availability of a large
number of prokaryotic genome sequences allows us to use a
variety of computational approaches to address the problem
of the origin and evolution of these systems. One approach,
involving sensitive sequence searches using profile methods,
allows the detection of distant relationships, which were hitherto not detected [11-13]. Additionally, it also enables objective evaluation of relationships, based on statistical
significance of the detected similarities and multiple alignment-derived secondary structure predictions. A second
approach involves the use of comparative genomics to detect

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/12/R81

conserved gene neighborhoods, gene or domain fusions, and
to extract functional and evolutionary information from these
contextual connections [14-18]. This approach is particular
useful in the case of the prokaryotic PSK systems because of
the strong coupling of the toxin and antitoxin genes in a single
operon. Our objective in applying these analyses was to discover new functional connections that may not have been previously uncovered in experimental studies on these systems.
Given the recent experimental results suggesting a specific
role for these systems in the regulation of cellular responses
to stress [9,10,19], we were also interested in identifying
novel genomic versions of PSK-related systems with a wide
phyletic distribution.
As a result of our analyses we were able to uncover several
new T-A systems and establish an evolutionary relationship
between them and the eukaryotic nonsense-mediated RNA
degradation system. We also present evidence that the RelE
and ParE families of toxins, despite their very distinct modes
of action, have been ultimately derived from a common
ancestor. Furthermore, we show that the Doc toxin defines a
large family of enzymes that could potentially act on RNA and
function as regulators of translation in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes.

Results and discussion
Unification of the RelE and ParE families and
identification of new related families of proteins
As Escherichia coli RelE and its close relatives are amongst
the functionally best-characterized toxins of the PSK systems,
with a wide phyletic pattern in bacteria and archaea [6], we
chose them as the starting point of our investigation of the
general cellular functions and natural history of these systems. In order to determine the deep evolutionary affinities of
the RelE proteins, we initiated a sequence profile search of
the non-redundant (NR) protein database (National Center
for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, USA) using the
PSI-BLAST program (threshold for inclusion in profile =
0.01, iterated till convergence) [11]. At convergence, this
search recovered a large number of homologs of RelE-including all the previously described versions - from a variety of
bacteria and archaea. We selected distinct representatives
from the newly-detected members and transitively searched
the NR database with these proteins as queries. As these proteins are typically small (85-110 residues in length) and divergent, several searches initiated with different seed sequences
were required to exhaustively identify distant homologs of
RelE. For example, RelE (gi: 16129522, E. coli) recovers a Staphylococcus aureus protein (gi: 15925446, ortholog of E. coli
YoeB) in the third iteration (e= 6e-04), a Campylobacter
fetus protein (gi: 28974229, ortholog of E. coli YafQ) in the
fourth iteration (e = 2e-04), a Microbulbifer degradans protein (gi: 23028223, ParE family) in the fourth iteration (e =
0.004) and a Magnetococcus protein (gi: 23001539, with the
RelE-related segment fused to a SF-I helicase module) in the

We determined the major lineages of the RelE/ParE superfamily through single-linkage clustering of the proteins with
the BLASTCLUST program and construction of neighborjoining phylogenetic trees with a multiple alignment of all
complete members of the superfamily. Several distinct

refereed research

We then investigated the evolutionary history of the RelE/
ParE superfamily by exploring its phyletic and phylogenetic
diversity. The superfamily is widely distributed in the currently sequenced prokaryotes: at least a single member is
encoded by the chromosome or one of the large genomic partitions in several bacterial and most archaeal lineages (Figure
2). Additionally, plasmids, particularly those from proteobacteria, encode their own RelE/ParE-related proteins. However, no members of this superfamily could be detected in
eukaryotes. This phyletic pattern could mean that the superfamily had its origin early the evolution of one of the prokaryotic lineages, followed by dissemination via plasmids.
However, it is also possible that at least one representative of
this superfamily was present in the last universal common
ancestor and secondarily lost in the eukaryotes.

deposited research

The multiple alignment of the RelE/ParE family shows that
much of the conservation is associated with the residues forming the core of the conserved, predicted secondary structure
elements (Figure 1). Two charged or polar residues, one associated with the first conserved helix and the second associated
with the end of the carboxy-terminal-most strand, are also
strongly conserved throughout the superfamily. A third,
slightly less conserved polar residue is also seen to be associated with the second universally predicted strand of these proteins. This conservation of a charged residue is consistent with
the nucleic acid-associated role of the functionally characterized proteins of this family, and could mediate interactions
with RNA or DNA. However, beyond this general similarity,
the ParE and RelE proteins have very different modes of
action. Experimental studies have suggested that ParE inhibits the gyrase by trapping it with DNA in a stable complex, but
so far there has been no report of any catalytic activity in ParE.
In contrast, RelE and its homologs have been shown to cleave
mRNA only when it is associated with the ribosome, but not
free mRNAs [5,9]. This suggests that certain members of this
superfamily may possess catalytic activity under certain circumstances, and the conserved polar residues could contribute to this activity. In particular, the charged residue, which
occurs at the carboxyl terminus of the last strand in these proteins, is an attractive candidate for a potential catalytic residue in the RelE proteins. In light of the relationship between
the ParE and RelE families of proteins it would be of some
interest to investigate the possibility of an unexplored DNAcleaving activity in members of the ParE family, analogous to
the ribosome-associated RNAse activity of RelE.

reports

A multiple sequence alignment of the entire RelE/ParE
superfamily (Figure 1) was constructed by combining the
alignments of the individual clusters using the Profile Consistency Multiple Sequence Alignment (PCMA) program and
refining it based on PSI-BLAST pair-wise alignments and secondary structure predictions. The predicted secondary structure which is conserved throughout this superfamily defines
an Î± + Î² fold with a single amino-terminal strand, followed by
a bi-helical hairpin and at least three strong strands at the
carboxyl terminus. This secondary structure pattern does not
appear to be consistent with that of the MazF/Kid/CcdB
superfamily of toxins [23-26], which adopts a SH3 barrel fold.
Furthermore, no statistically significant relationship can be
established between the profiles of the MazF/Kid/CcdB
superfamily toxins and the RelE/ParE superfamily. Hence,

even though both CcdB and ParE function as gyrase inhibitors, they are likely to fold into very distinct three-dimensional structures.

reviews

A striking aspect of these searches was the establishment of
the relationship between the ParE (typified by the plasmid
RK2-encoded toxin, ParE) [22] and RelE families of toxins
that were previously believed to be unrelated. These toxins
have very different targets of action: ParE acts at the level of
DNA replication and recombination by interfering with the
action of gyrase [7], whereas RelE acts on RNA at the level of
translation [5]. This observation suggested that despite a
common origin and significant sequence similarity, these
PSK toxins could have diverged into different functional
roles. Hereinafter, we refer to this superfamily of proteins,
which includes the toxin families defined by RelE, ParE and
other evolutionarily-related proteins that were detected in the
above searches, as the RelE/ParE superfamily. The majority
of proteins in this superfamily are of similar length and
appear to fold into a single globular domain.

fifth iteration (e = 0.001). To further ensure the detection of
highly divergent members, all unique members detected in
these searches were included in a single PSI-BLAST PSSM
that was used to iteratively search the NR database till convergence. As result of this procedure, we were able to recover
over 150 distinct homologs (less than 92% identical) of RelE.
Reciprocal searches started with diverse proteins detected in
the above procedure recovered a common set of obvious
RelE-related 'intermediate' sequences supporting these relationships. For example, a reciprocal search with a protein
from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (gi: 29350140), which is
consistently recovered from various starting sequences that
were detected in the above searches, recovers other divergent
RelE-related proteins (for example, Nostoc punctiforme protein gi: 23129164) in the third iteration (e= 0.001) and the E.
coli RelE itself in the fifth iteration (e = 3e-06). These
sequences were then clustered using the BLASTCLUST program and individual clusters were aligned using the T_coffee
program [20]. These alignments were used to predict individually the secondary structure for each of these clusters with
the PHD program [21]. A very similar arrangement of the predicted secondary structure elements between diverse groups
of these proteins further reinforced their relationships.

refereed research

Given the tight coupling of the toxin-antitoxin gene pairs, we
investigated contextual information derived from their gene
neighborhoods [14-18]. We concentrated on the newly identified members of the RelE/ParE superfamily to glean previously unknown contextual connections to other genes.
Upstream genes encoding transcription factors of the MetJ/
Arc superfamily accompany both RelE and ParE families
[6,27,28]. This transcription factor serves as the antitoxin,
which not only regulates the transcription of genes in the T-A
operon, but also physically binds to the toxins and counters
their actions [6]. A systematic survey of all the newly identified members of the RelE, YafQ and ParE families showed
that the majority of the genes encoding these proteins were
associated with upstream genes for MetJ/Arc transcription
factors (Figures 1,3). In contrast, a range of novel gene
neighborhood associations was observed in several of the
newly identified families of the RelE/ParE superfamily.

Wider phyletic spread of the RelE family and its relatives, as
compared to the ParE family, may suggest that the former
group represents the more ancient member of the

superfamily, with the ParE lineage being secondarily derived
in bacteria. This would imply that the RNA-cleaving activity
is likely to be the primitive function of this superfamily, with
a secondary innovation of gyrase inhibitor activity in the ParE
family. The sporadic, but widespread phyletic patterns of several families, and differences in representation between
strains of the same species (for example, E. coli), suggest a
potential role for lateral transfer in the spread of these genes.
At the same time, the extensive occurrence of genes for this
superfamily in the chromosomal partitions of the genomes,
and not merely on plasmids, supports the proposal that they
may be widely used as cellular regulators. Thus, the acquisition of members of the RelE/ParE superfamily through lateral transfer could be a means by which certain strains could
rapidly evolve a new regulatory pathway that helps in adapting their gene expression to unique environmental stresses.

reviews

families could be delineated within the superfamily, of which
two of the largest families were the RelE and ParE families.
Most of the families could be distinguished by means of certain lineage-specific conserved residues (Figure 1). As previously noted [6], the RelE family had the widest phyletic
spread with members in several bacterial and archaeal lineages. A small, proteobacteria-specific family, typified by the
YafQ protein of E. coli (YafQ family), is the one that is most
closely related to the RelE family. These two families are unified by the presence of shared polar residue at the beginning
of strand 1 (Figure 1). The ParE family is restricted to bacteria,
but is widely distributed with representatives in proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, actinomycetes and cytophagales. The ParE
family is distinguished by the presence of a single polar residue in the second conserved strand, whereas all other members of the RelE/ParE superfamily possess two conserved
polar residues in this strand (Figure 1). Two of the remaining
families, one typified by the protein Rv3182 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Rv3182 family) and one defined by the
YoeB protein of E. coli (YoeB family), are fairly widespread
across a range of bacterial lineages (Figure 1) and are primarily encoded by the main chromosome. The remaining smaller
families are far more sporadic in their distribution, and
chiefly occur only in proteobacteria and cyanobacteria (Figure
1). One of the most divergent families of the ParE-RelE superfamily is typified by the Z5902 protein (Z5902 family) from
the enterohemorrhagic strain of E. coli (O157:H7), and has
sporadic representatives from a number of unrelated bacteria
such as Magnetobacterium, Corynebacterium and Thermobifida. All members of this family occur fused to a carboxy-terminal superfamily I (SF-I) helicase module, and represent
one of the rare instances when the ParE-RelE domain occurs
in a multidomain protein (Figure 3).

Figure alignment of the RelE/ParE superfamily
Multiple1 (see previous page)
Multiple alignment of the RelE/ParE superfamily. Multiple sequence alignments of the different families of RelE/ParE were constructed using T-Coffee [20]
and PCMA [50] after parsing high-scoring pairs from PSI-BLAST search results. The PHD-secondary structure [21] is shown above the alignment with E
representing a Î² strand, and H an Î±-helix. The consensus of the individual families and the entire superfamily is shown, and the names of each family are
shown on the right. The 90% (or 80%) consensus shown below the alignment was derived using the following amino acid classes: hydrophobic (h:
ALICVMYFW, yellow shading); the aliphatic subset of the hydrophobic class (l: ALIVMC, yellow shading); aromatic (a: FHWY, yellow shading); small (s:
ACDGNPSTV, green); the tiny subset of the small class (u: GAS, green shading); polar (p: CDEHKNQRST, blue); alcohol subset of polar (o: ST, blue);
charged subset of polar (c: DEHKR, pink); positive subset of polar (+: HKR, pink); and negative subset of polar (-: DE, pink). An amino acid in capitals like
'G', or 'E' shows the completely conserved amino acid in that group. The operon information (op) and/or the domain architecture information are shown
on the right for each family. The limits of the domains are indicated by the residue positions, in bold, on each side. The numbers within the alignment are
non-conserved inserts that have not been shown. The sequences are denoted by their gene name followed by the species abbreviation and GenBank
Identifier. The phylogenetic relationship between the families is shown as a tree to the right. The species abbreviations are: Af, Archaeoglobus fulgidus; Ape,

Genes for proteins belonging to the YoeB family of the RelE/
ParE superfamily were consistently associated with upstream
genes that coded small proteins (~75-90 residues) that were
unrelated to the MetJ/Arc superfamily. We investigated this
family of small proteins further by initiating iterative PSIBLAST searches seeded with the E. coli YefM protein, which
is their archetypal representative. These searches showed
that they formed a group of bacterial and phage proteins that
included the previous characterized DNA-binding proteins,
like Phd from phage P1 and DnaT [29,30]. Reciprocal
searches initiated with the Phd protein recovered YefM and
those of its relatives that are encoded by genes co-occurring
with genes for the YoeB family of RelE/ParE related toxin
homologs. Hereinafter, we refer to these proteins as the Phd/
YefM superfamily. The Phd/YefM superfamily is characterized by a conserved domain that is approximately 70 to 75 residues in length. This domain is predicted to bind DNA based
on the experimental studies on the phage P1 Phd protein and

the E. coli DnaT protein, which functions in DNA replication
[29-32]. Secondary structure prediction based on the multiple sequence alignment (Figure 4) revealed that the DNAbinding domain of the Phd/YefM superfamily is likely to
adopt an Î± + Î² fold with amino- and carboxy-terminal helices
flanking a central Î²-hairpin. This secondary structure pattern
does not suggest any direct relationship to the MetJ/Arc or
HTH folds, suggesting that the Phd/YefM domain may define
a unique DNA-binding fold. The Phd protein is a transcription regulator of the toxin Doc, and functions as the antitoxin
of the phage P1 plasmid PSK system. Though the Phd-Doc
PSK system is functionally analogous to the RelE/ParE systems, the toxin Doc is unrelated to the RelE/ParE superfamily
(see below). However, based on the organization of the gene
neighborhoods in YoeB family (Figure 3), the Phd/YefM proteins encoded by the upstream genes are predicted to function as transcriptional regulators and antitoxins of the YoeB
proteins. Interestingly, the Phd/YefM domain is also fused to

The above observations suggested that there is considerable
unity in the organization of these toxin-antitoxin gene systems: typically these comprise of two small genes, in which
one member of the pair encodes a toxin and the other encodes
a DNA-binding protein that functions as an antitoxin and a
transcription factor. However, the transcription factor and
toxin in a functional comparable pair might belong to entirely
unrelated superfamilies of proteins. Thus, genes of the RelE/
ParE superfamily may be associated with genes for transcription factors belonging to either the MetJ/Arc or Phd/YefM or
cHTH superfamilies. Likewise, a survey of the operonic associations for transcription factors showed that the Phd/YefM

Importantly, the screening procedure recovered a novel widespread family of small proteins (~100 residues, typified by
MJ1121) that was consistently found downstream of genes for
MetJ/Arc transcription factors (Figure 3). In this respect they
closely resembled the operons of the RelE/ParE and MazF
superfamily PSK systems. Sequence profile searches initiated
with MJ1121 and its relatives showed that these small proteins comprised entirely of a RNA-binding domain, which we
had previously described as the PilT-N terminal (PIN)
domain [33-36]. Transitive analysis of the gene
neighborhoods, using this class of solo PIN domain proteins
as the pivot, showed that those versions which were not
encoded by genes downstream of MetJ/Arc transcription factors were associated with other sets of conserved upstream or
downstream genes (Figure 3). Analysis of these genes showed
that two groups of solo PIN-protein-encoding genes were
flanked by genes for transcription factors of the Phd/YefM
and AbrB superfamilies [37,38], which are also found in other
PSK operons as antitoxins and transcriptional regulators with
other unrelated toxin genes (Figure 3). For example, MazF,
the archetypal member of the MazF/CcdB/KiD superfamily
of toxins, is encoded by a gene that is operonic with the MazE
gene, which encodes an antitoxin of the AbrB superfamily of
transcription factors. Two other groups of solo PIN-encoding
genes were associated with upstream genes encoding

reports

One possibility, which is supported by the specific relationship between these cHTH proteins and cro/cI repressors, is
that these proteins act as repressors of the toxin gene. The
degradation of the repressor under certain conditions could
then allow the expression of the toxin component. The Z5902
family of the RelE/ParE superfamily, where the RelE/ParE
domain is fused to a carboxy-terminal SF-I helicase module,
differs from all other families in its predicted operon organization. These proteins typically co-occur with genes for
another large helicase of superfamily II (SF-II), a restriction
endonuclease and a DNA methylase. This implies that these
proteins could constitute a novel restriction-modification
complex, in which the RelE/ParE domain could function as a
DNA-binding domain.

reviews

Genes encoding members of the Rv3182, mlr1576, VCA0468
families of the RelE/ParE superfamily were consistently
associated with conserved downstream genes that encoded
small proteins (90-110 residues) unrelated to either the Phd/
YefM or MetJ/Arc superfamilies (Figure 3). PSI-BLAST
searches initiated with these proteins showed that they all
contained a conserved helix-turn-helix domain related to the
lambda cro protein (cHTH domain). This suggested that they
are likely to be DNA-binding proteins that act as transcription
regulators of the upstream genes, which encoded members of
the RelE/ParE superfamily. By analogy to the other PSK systems, these cHTH proteins are also expected to function as
antitoxins countering the action of the products of their
upstream genes. However, given the 'reverse' organization
with respect to the classical PKS systems, it is conceivable that
the functional interaction between the cHTH transcriptional
regulator and the toxin component is different in these
systems.

might be associated with at least two unrelated toxin superfamilies, namely RelE/ParE and Doc (see below). Nevertheless, this strongly coupled operon architecture in the form of
a gene-dyad encoding a transcription factor and a toxin,
appears to be a unique signature of PSK and related regulatory systems. Hence, to detect other potentially novel transcription factors and toxins, we systematically surveyed the
gene neighborhoods of transcription factors which were close
homologs of those associated with the RelE/ParE-superfamily toxins in order to find organizations similar to the PSK
systems. We then transitively extended this scanning of gene
neighborhoods on the homologs of any potential toxin candidates that were detected in the first screen and sought to
detect any other transcription factors they may be associated
with these newly predicted toxin-like genes. In particular, we
concentrated on only those potential toxin or transcription
factors that are conserved across a wide range of cellular
genomes. Figure 3 illustrates the network of contextual connections that were recovered in these screens in the form of a
directed graph. Previously observed associations such as that
of MetJ/Arc transcription factors with toxins of the MazF
superfamily [25], and Phd/YefM transcription factors with
toxins of the Doc family were recovered in these screens supporting the effectiveness of this procedure.

conserved proteins, typified by AF0608 from Archaeoglobus
and RV0623 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, respectively
(Figure 3). Secondary structure prediction based on multiple
alignments for these gene products showed that they
comprised of small globular domains (Figure 5a,5b) with a
conserved extended region followed by two helices. This secondary structure, together with the conservation pattern of
the residues in these families, strongly suggested that they
might define novel transcription factor families possessing a
'ribbon-helix-helix' fold as seen in the MetJ/Arc superfamily
[28]. Yet another group of solo PIN domain proteins, typified
by AF0099, were encoded by genes associated with upstream
genes which encoded predicted DNA-binding proteins containing HTH domains belonging to the Pipsqueak family
[28]. Finally, one group of solo PIN-protein-encoding genes
was consistently associated with upstream genes encoding a
family of small proteins that did not show detectable similarity to any known family of transcription factors. A multiple
alignment of this family, with AF0319 as an archetypal member, reveals a simple Î± + Î² fold with a highly conserved
amino-terminal region enriched in positively charged residues (Figure 5c). Based on the contextual precedence offered
by the other T-A operons, we predict that AF0319 defines a
novel class of transcription factors that regulate the expression of the PIN protein-encoding genes.
Based on this web of contextual connections offered by gene
neighborhoods (Figure 3) we predict that the above-detected
group of solo PIN domain proteins defines a toxin-like component of novel PSK-related regulatory systems. These
predicted PSK-related systems with the PIN domain are as
widespread as the systems with proteins of the RelE/ParE
superfamily in both archaea and bacteria.

Functional and evolutionary connections of the PIN
and Doc domains and eukaryotic nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay
In contrast to the RelE proteins that are restricted to prokaryotes, the PIN domain is found in all three superkingdoms of
life. This suggested that the PSK-related regulatory systems
with PIN domain proteins might throw light on the more general roles of such systems. Given the RNA-binding role for the
PIN domain [34-36], it is likely that these systems elicit their
action by acting upon some RNA substrate. Importantly, a
highly-conserved solo PIN domain protein is encoded by the
archaeal super-operons that contain genes for ribosomal proteins and translation GTPases, like eIF3Î³ (Figure 3). This contextual connection implies that this version of the solo PIN
domain is likely to function in the translation process in association with the ribosome and eIF3Î³. This observation, along
with the analogy to the Doc, RelE and possibly the MazF systems, implies that the PSK-related systems with PIN domains
might function as translation inhibitors. The PIN domain
proteins from eukaryotes suggest a deeper functional analogy
between the PIN and RelE domains. These eukaryotic PIN
domain proteins, such as SMG-7 from Caenorhabditis ele-

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/12/R81

gans and Nmd4p from yeast, are known to participate in the
process of nonsense codon mediated decay (NMD) of mRNA
[36,39-41]. In eukaryotes, this system specifically targets
mRNAs with stop codons for degradation [42,43]. This suggests that the prokaryotic PSK-related systems with PIN
domain proteins are likely to target transcripts in a process
analogous to NMD of mRNA. There has been an earlier proposal that the PIN domain may be related to 39R59 exonucleases [36]. However, even though these two domains may have
a common fold, they show differences in the conserved residues that constitute their active sites (additional data file 1)
[34]. Hence, it possible that certain PIN domains, analogous
to the RelE domains, cleave RNA only when it is associated
with the ribosome. Thus, we predict that a ribosome-associated RNAse activity is likely to be the common mechanism of
action for the solo PIN proteins in NMD as well as in prokaryotic PSK-related systems.
The above observations suggest that the crucial PIN domain
protein of the NMD system is perhaps a remnant of an
ancient PSK-type regulatory system. The emergence of the
nucleus in eukaryotes, and the uncoupling of translation and
transcription could have caused the PIN domain protein to be
released from the tight regulatory circuit involving a coupled
antitoxin transcription factor. Our earlier studies have suggested that other key components of the NMD system and the
eukaryotic translation initiation systems have evolved from a
common group of ancestral proteins [44]. The evolution of
interactions with this eukaryote-specific complex might have
contributed to the decoupling of the solo PIN domain proteins from the ancestral PSK-related system, and led to their
incorporation into the NMD system.
We examined other superfamilies of toxins to determine if
they included widely distributed members with a general
functional significance similar to the solo PIN domain proteins. Several PSK-systems have a very limited phyletic distribution [6] and are not further detailed here because they are
unlikely to throw light on broadly deployed regulatory mechanisms. The well-known MazF/CcdB/Kid superfamily is
widely represented in the bacterial superkingdom [25] and a
single archaeal genus, Pyrococcus, but not in eukaryotes (Figure 2). As the structures of several proteins from this superfamily are currently available, we searched the PDB database
[45] with them to detect other related structures. These
searches indicated that although the MazF/CcdB/Kid domain
possessed a SH3-barrel fold, they were not closely related to
any other members of this fold. Hence, it is likely that these
domains represent a specialized version of the SH3-barrel
fold that was derived in the bacteria.
The Doc toxin of the Phd-Doc PSK system has been hitherto
detected only in P1-like phages and related mobile DNA elements from Î³-proteobacteria [6]. Our sequence profile
searches with the PSI-BLAST program recovered several
homologs of Doc from several proteobacterial lineages, low

information

A multiple alignment of the Doc domain superfamily (Figure
6) shows that these proteins share several nearly absolutelyconserved charged or polar residues, and the proteins are

predicted to assume an Î±-helical fold. The amino-terminal
half contains a highly-conserved histidine and a basic residue
(almost always arginine), while the carboxy-terminal half
contains a characteristic motif with a HX3 [DE]XNXR (where
X is any amino acid) signature (Figure 6). This conservation
pattern suggests that the Doc domain is a catalytic domain,
with the charged or polar residues constituting the catalytic
residues. While this pattern of residues does not match those
seen in the active sites of any known class of Î±-helical
enzymes, the conserved histidines and asparagine could form
a metal chelating site. A mutant version of the Doc protein, in
which the amino-terminal-conserved histidine is disrupted,
loses its toxin activity [30]. This suggests that the catalytic

interactions

GC Gram positive bacteria, actinobacteria, cyanobacteria,
spirochetes, Aquifex, Fusobacterium, some archaeal lineages
and animals, with statistically significant expect values (e <
0.001). Amongst these newly-detected homologs of Doc were
proteins such as the Fic protein from E. coli [46,47], and the
huntingtin associated protein E (HYPE) [48]. The conserved
region shared by all these proteins was approximately 125 to
150 residues long, and appeared to define a novel globular
domain that we refer to, hereinafter, as the Doc domain.

Multiple alignment of the Doc domain. The three major families of the Doc domain superfamily have been delineated by small blank spacers. The labeling
and coloring conventions are as followed in the legend to Figure 1. The species abbreviations are as shown in Figure 1, Figure 2 and additionally: Cjej,

activity of the Doc protein is required for its toxicity. Experimental evidence has suggested that Doc blocks a step in
translation [2,8]. This observation, along with the predicted
enzymatic nature for the Doc domain, suggests that it might
possibly act as a nuclease that blocks translation by cleaving
transcripts. Alternatively, it is possible that it acts as an
uncharacterized RNA-processing enzyme that modifies transcripts and makes them unusable for translation.
A phylogenetic analysis of the Doc superfamily reveals that it
contains three distinct families (Figure 6). The first family
contains the Doc protein from phage P1 and its homologs
from several bacterial genomes. Typically, upstream genes for
an antitoxin transcription factor accompany genes encoding
members of this family (Figure 3). All these proteins contain
a minimal stand-alone version of the Doc domain. The second
family, typified by the animal HYPE protein is also found in
several bacteria and some archaea. These proteins contain a
longer insert after the conserved amino-terminal motifs (Figure 6) and are typically multidomain proteins. The animal

HYPE contains a amino-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat
(TPR) module, whereas most prokaryotic versions are fused
to a carboxy-terminal DNA-binding winged HTH (wHTH)
domain [28]. Interestingly, a single bacterial protein,
XCC2565 from Xanthomonas, has leucine-rich repeats (LRR,
Figure 3) amino-terminal to the Doc domain. The presence of
TPR repeats is reminiscent of similar TPR modules that are
present amino-terminal to the PIN domain in NMD proteins
such as Smg-7 [36]. The human HYPE protein interacts with
the huntingtin protein, which also contains similar Î±-helical
ARM repeats that adopt a superstructure similar to the TPR
repeats [48]. While the physiological relevance of these interactions is unclear, it is plausible that the HYPE is part of an
uncharacterized multiprotein complex in the animal cells that
may have a regulatory role similar to the chromosomally
encoded versions of the bacterial Doc systems. Although no
transcription factor genes are seen accompanying the genes
for the prokaryotic HYPE orthologs, the carboxy-terminal
wHTH could possibly function as an inbuilt transcriptional
regulator for these proteins. A single bacterial member of the

Finally, the abundant presence of PSK-related systems in
prokaryotic chromosomes supports the original proposal of
Gerdes and recent experimental studies that these systems
could function as more generic regulatory systems [5,6,8,19].
In particular, they appear to have proliferated on the chromosomes of some prokaryotes, such as the RelE system in
several proteobacteria and the PIN system in archaea, Nostoc
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Figure 2).
Furthermore, in some cases, domains such as Doc, PIN,
RelE/ParE and YefM proteins appear to have been incorporated in systems that function outside the context of classic
PSK-related systems.

The non-redundant (NR) database of protein sequences
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH,
Bethesda) was searched using the BLASTP program [11]. Profile searches were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program
with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the
query, with a default profile inclusion expectation (E) value
threshold of 0.01 (unless specified otherwise), and was iterated until convergence [11,13]. For all searches with compositionally biased proteins we used a statistical correction for
this bias to reduce false positives in these searches. Multiple
alignments were constructed using the T_Coffee [20] or

deposited research

Using sequence profile analysis and contextual data derived
from comparative genomics, we investigated the evolutionary
relationships of prokaryotic T-A systems. As a result we were
able to unify the functionally unrelated toxin families defined
by the ParE and RelE proteins and detect several new families
of this protein superfamily. The contextual information
obtained from comparative genomics allowed us to identify
several new operons of PSK-related systems. One of these
encodes a protein with a solo RNA-binding PIN domain as the
toxin component. We suggest that these PIN domain proteins
function similarly to the RelE proteins in cleaving ribosomeassociated transcripts. We predict that this is likely to be a
common mode of action of the PIN domain containing PSKrelated systems of prokaryotes and the NMD system that
cleaves transcripts with stop codons in eukaryotes. We also
show that the Doc toxin defines a large family of proteins that
include the animal huntingtin-interacting HYPE proteins and
the bacterial Fic proteins. These proteins are predicted to
function as metalloenzymes that could potentially cleave
RNA. Finally, we also describe several new families of associated transcription factors that are predicted to function as
antitoxins in the newly identified PSK systems. These predictions are likely to aid in experimental investigation of poorly
understood aspects of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic regulatory systems, including the process of nonsense mediated
decay in eukaryotes.

reports

The above analysis suggests that there is considerable diversity amongst the T-A systems. Most widespread prokaryotic
PSK or related systems appear to have been derived by mixing
and matching a few major classes of toxins and antitoxins
(Figure 2) that appear to have independent evolutionary origins. The major classes of toxins are the RelE/ParE superfamily, the MazF/CcdB superfamily, the Doc superfamily and
the solo PIN domain superfamily (Figure 2). The major
classes of antitoxin transcription factors are the MetJ/Arc
superfamily and related ribbon-helix-helix fold proteins, the
HTH superfamily, the AbrB superfamily and the Phd/YefM
superfamily. This suggests that all PSK-related systems have
not descended from a common ancestor, but have been
assembled on different occasions from a relatively small pool
of proteins. One simple hypothesis that could account for the
observed pattern of gene neighborhoods is the in situ displacement of genes for functionally related proteins in a
tightly maintained operon. In this process, the operon architecture is maintained due to the strong functional interactions of the encoded polypeptides, but the actual origin of the
polypeptides encoded by it is not constrained. This is likely to
happen if unrelated polypetides can perform the same function equally effectively. This is consistent with the functional
identity of different superfamilies of antitoxins that act as
transcription factors. The potential functional equivalence of
several unrelated toxins, such as RelE, the PIN domain and
Doc domain toxins, or ParE and CcdB suggests that even the
toxin genes are viable candidates for in situ displacement by
analogs. Thus toxin or antitoxin genes could be displaced in
situ by functionally equivalent, but unrelated genes, while the
operon architecture itself is preserved. This process is highly
reminiscent of the displacement of functionally equivalent,
but evolutionarily unrelated genes in certain DNA recombination related operons in bacteria and phages [49]. However,
the case of the RelE/ParE superfamily suggests that toxinantitoxin gene pairs could undergo vertical evolutionary
divergence to acquire very distinct functions.

comment

HYPE family, namely PfhB2 from Pasteurella, contains two
Doc domains fused to several fibrinogen-type repeats and a
conserved domain found in several bacterial agglutinins (Figure 3). This protein is likely to be an extracellular protein, and
may represent an unusual case of recruitment of the Doc
domain for a novel function, perhaps as a secreted nuclease or
an enzyme for the processing of extracellular polysaccharides.
The third family of Doc-related proteins is comprised of the E.
coli Fic protein and its orthologs from diverse bacteria (Figure 6). Like the HYPE family, they also contain a longer insert
in the Doc domain after the amino-terminal conserved motif
(Figure 6). These clearly do not appear to be parts of a PSKrelated system for they do not show any conserved operon
architectures. Mutations in the Fic protein result in filamentous growth, indicating a role in cell division [46,47]. Based
on the predicted catalytic activity for the Doc superfamily, it
is possible that the Fic proteins may target specific transcripts
when induced under certain growth conditions.

PCMA [50] programs, followed by manual correction based
on the PSI-BLAST results. All large-scale sequence analysis
procedures were carried out using the SEALS package [51].
Structural manipulations were carried out using the SwissPDB viewer program [52] and the ribbon diagrams were constructed with MOLSCRIPT [53]. Searches of the PDB database with query structures was conducted using the DALI
program [54]. Protein secondary structure was predicted
using a multiple alignment as the input for the PHD program
[21]. Similarity-based clustering of proteins was carried out
using the BLASTCLUST program [55]. Phylogenetic analysis
was carried out using the maximum-likelihood, neighborjoining and least squares methods [56,57]. Briefly, this process involved the construction of a least squares tree using the
FITCH program [58] or a neighbor joining tree using the
NEIGHBOR [57] or the MEGA program [59], followed by
local rearrangement using the ProtML program of the Molphy package [57] to arrive at the maximum likelihood (ML)
tree. The statistical significance of various nodes of this ML
tree was assessed using the relative estimate of logarithmic
likelihood bootstrap (ProtML RELL-BP), with 10,000 replicates. Gene neighborhoods were determined by searching the
NCBI PTT tables with a script that was custom-written by the
authors. Briefly the procedure involved collecting fixed neighborhoods centered on a set of query genes, followed by the
clustering of their products using the BLASTCLUST program
to determine related products. The presence of clusters of
related genes amongst the neighbors of the query set implied
the presence of conserved gene neighborhoods. This was used
in combination with a previously reported screen for conserved gene neighborhoods [15,35]. These tables can be
accessed from the genomes division of the Genbank database
[60].
