Abstract
Background: Our understanding of the dynamics of genome stability versus gene flux within bacteriophage
lineages is limited. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the use of bacteriophages as ‘therapeutic’
agents; a prerequisite for their use in such therapies is a thorough understanding of their genetic complement,
genome stability and their ecology to avoid the dissemination or mobilisation of phage or bacterial virulence and
toxin genes. Campylobacter, a food-borne pathogen, is one of the organisms for which the use of bacteriophage is
being considered to reduce human exposure to this organism.
Results: Sequencing and genome analysis was performed for two Campylobacter bacteriophages. The genomes
were extremely similar at the nucleotide level (≥ 96%) with most differences accounted for by novel insertion
sequences, DNA methylases and an approximately 10 kb contiguous region of metabolic genes that were
dissimilar at the sequence level but similar in gene function between the two phages. Both bacteriophages
contained a large number of radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) genes, presumably involved in boosting host
metabolism during infection, as well as evidence that many genes had been acquired from a wide range of
bacterial species. Further bacteriophages, from the UK Campylobacter typing set, were screened for the presence of
bacteriophage structural genes, DNA methylases, mobile genetic elements and regulatory genes identified from
the genome sequences. The results indicate that many of these bacteriophages are related, with 10 out of 15
showing some relationship to the sequenced genomes.
Conclusions: Two large virulent Campylobacter bacteriophages were found to show very high levels of sequence
conservation despite separation in time and place of isolation. The bacteriophages show adaptations to their host
and possess genes that may enhance Campylobacter metabolism, potentially advantaging both the bacteriophage
and its host. Genetic conservation has been shown to extend to other Campylobacter bacteriophages, forming a
highly conserved lineage of bacteriophages that predate upon campylobacters and indicating that highly adapted
bacteriophage genomes can be stable over prolonged periods of time.

Background
Bacteriophages (phages) are naturally occurring predators of bacteria that are ubiquitous in the environment;
they are almost certainly the most abundant biological
entities on the planet [1]. It is commonly accepted that
phage genomes are an extremely rich source of novel
and unique DNA sequences, and that phage genomes
are highly variable, often showing a mosaic patchwork

of genetic segments acquired from a range of sources
including other phages and bacteria. However, this view
is almost certainly an oversimplification; as more phage
genomes become available it is clear that closely related
phage lineages exist in the environment which may be
stable over appreciable time-scales and geographic areas
[2,3]. Understanding how these lineages evolve and
adapt to their hosts will provide useful insights into the
phage pan-genome, genetic flux within communities
and phage genome stability.
The general availability of phages in the environment
coupled with their ease of isolation and cultivation has

led them to be used in a variety of ways. Phages have
been instrumental in the development of molecular biology, their use as typing tools for bacterial pathogens
continues today and recently there has been a resurgence of interest in phage intervention to control pathogens, so called ‘bacteriophage therapy’. The closely
related zoonotic pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and
Campylobacter coli are major causes of infectious bacterial gastroenteritis in humans [4-6], and have been
associated with rare but serious, sometimes fatal, neurological sequelae such as Guillain-Barré syndrome,
Miller-Fisher syndrome and the onset of reactive arthritis [7-9]. Using phages to reduce Campylobacter at multiple stages of the food chain is a promising sustainable
intervention strategy but requires detailed knowledge of
phage genomes at the sequence level. Although previous
studies have shown that the application of phages can
effectively reduce Campylobacter contamination [10-12],
to date the most common use of Campylobacter phages
has been in typing schemes allowing the discrimination
between different Campylobacter isolates [13,14]. Previous studies have shown that all the Campylobacter
phages examined to date belong to either the Myoviridae or Siphoviridae tailed phage families [15]. Based on
genome size, they have been categorized into three
groups; group III 130 - 140 kb, group II 180 - 190 kb
and the typing phages NCTC 12676 and NCTC 12677,
which are reported to be ~320 kb in size, as group I
[16,17]. Molecular characterization of these phages has
been slow, with many of the currently available Campylobacter phages being extremely refractory to genomic
analysis. In many cases phage genomic DNA is resistant
to digestion with any of the standard restriction endonucleases, although, HhaI has proven to be useful to
discriminate some group III phages [16-18]. However,
thorough characterization of Campylobacter specific
phages (indeed any phage intended for therapeutic
applications) is a prerequisite to avoid the inadvertent
transfer or mobilization of harmful genes [19].
In this work we report the first full genome sequences,
analysis of virion proteins and the genome analysis for
two large virulent Campylobacter specific phages; CP220
a phage isolated from chickens in 2003 [10,20] and

CPt10 a member of the UK Campylobacter typing
scheme phages, isolated from a slaughterhouse environment prior to 1989 [21]. Both display typical genome
sizes for group II phages, a morphology typical of the
Myoviridae phages [17,20] and exhibit broad but different host ranges with both phages notably able to lyse
Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates.
The genome sequences illuminate a very highly conserved Campylobacter specific phage lineage that has survived the ongoing competition between host and virus.

Results and Discussion
Genome structure

Two virulent Campylobacter phages have been
sequenced to reveal double stranded DNA genomes of
177 493 bp (CP220) and 175 720 bp (CPt10), a comparison of the genomes can be found in Table 1. The full
annotated genome sequences have been deposited with
the EMBL nucleotide sequence database with accession
numbers; CP220 [EMBL: FN667788] and CPt10 [EMBL:
FN667789]. These phages have a GC content comparable to that found in the host species, 30.5%, 30.3% and
31.1% for C. jejuni NCTC 11168, RM1221 and C. coli
RM2228 respectively [22]. Both the CP220 and CPt10
genomes show a distinct strand bias for putative protein
coding sequences (CDS), (see Additional file 1 - Table
S1) with the majority of the CDSs lying on the ‘forward’
strand, an observation in accordance with that for many
other phages where a similar bias in orientation is
observed [23,24]. In many bacterial species predominant
gene orientation is frequently parallel to the direction of
replication of the forward strand, thus minimising interference between RNA transcription and DNA replication. However, both phage genomes contain notable
exceptions to this strand bias, including two distinct sections of DNA where contiguous runs of CDSs lie on the
reverse strand (Figure 1).
In most cases the strand alignment of the open reading
frames is supported by the apparent change in strand
AG content, with a distinct preference for A and G
bases in the coding strand. This bias was also reflected
in the codon usage [25]. Comparison of the codon
usage frequencies from the entire genome sequences of

generated using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT). The CDS regions are indicated by bars top and bottom showing the ‘forward’ and ‘reverse’
strands. CDS regions are coloured according to the following key: grey - areas of nucleotide identity, white - significantly different CDS regions
present in only one of the genomes, solid black - repeat regions (numbered according to the current genome annotation), red - DNA
modification proteins, blue - insertion elements, pink - radical SAM proteins. Red bars indicate regions of sequence homology, the diagonal lines
link multiple repeat regions in both genomes indicating the conserved nature of these sequences throughout both genomes.

CP220 and CPt10 and from several C. jejuni and C. coli
genome sequences reveals that in cases where synonymous codons are available, the phages show a preference for alternative codons to those employed by
campylobacters (Additional file 2). There is a small but
definite bias towards codons with A or U at the third
position, which probably reflects the high A+T content
of these phage genomes, although as noted above the
phage genomes closely match that of host campylobacters in terms of their overall base composition.
The phages carry tandem tRNA genes with arginine
and tyrosine type anticodons. Unusually, the Tyr-tRNA
in CP220 shows a single base substitution in a highly
conserved tRNA residue but it is not clear how this
base change would impact on function. Examination of
the phage codon usage shows that the two codons
recognized by these tRNAs are represented more frequently in the phage coding regions than in Campylobacter, and thus probably explains the evolutionary
pressure for their retention. What is perhaps more surprising is that these phages don’t carry more tRNA
genes, for example T4 encodes eight tRNAs [26], as
there are a number of other codons that are represented
more frequently in phage CDSs than in Campylobacter.
The codon preferences observed could be an evolutionary relic, considering the wide range of organisms that
appear to have contributed to the phage genomes, or it
may be a strategy to fully utilize the available tRNA
pools in Campylobacter to maintain key host functions
whilst translating phage proteins necessary for replication and reproduction.
Of the 201 and 194 predicted CDSs identified for
CPt10 and CP220 respectively, some show significant
conservation (greater than 20% identity at the protein
level) to a range of structural and enzymatic proteins
from phage T4 (Table 2). Proteins Gp20 (portal vertex
protein) and Gp23 (the major capsid protein) are both
represented in the Campylobacter phage sequences with
identity to the corresponding T4 proteins of 28% and

31% respectively. The observation of sequence conservation suggests that these phages belong to the diverse
T4-like phage superfamily but somewhat distant to the
archetypal member of the group. The overall architecture of the genome appears to follow a modular construction, with most of the phage structural and DNA
replication genes clustered in the left and right arms of
the genomes as represented in Figure 1, while the central third of the genome comprises a much more heterogeneous selection of genes involved with metabolic
processes. However, in common with other phage genome sequences, a large proportion of putative CDSs 85/
194 from CP220 and 95/201 from CPt10 show no significant matches to sequences currently deposited in
databases.
Direct comparison of the two genomes reveals an
extremely high level of conservation (Figure 1), with an
average nucleotide identity over the entire length of the
phage chromosomes of 96.2%. So high is the conservation between these two phages it is possible to identify
the boundaries of insertion or deletion events encompassing discrete CDSs. Comparison of the genomes
revealed that 26 CDSs are unique to CP220 and 28 are
unique to CPt10. The majority of these have no significant matches to database sequences, however, two of
the unique sequences in CPt10 code for putative DNA
methyltranferases not present in CP220. CPt10_0091
shares 59% identity (over 588 amino acids) with a type
III restriction/modification methyltranferase subunit
from Campylobacter jejuni. Although the gene has a
confirmed frame-shift mutation in a poly-adenosine
tract towards the distal end of the gene, the full-length
product could still be expressed through a process of
transcriptional slippage [27,28]. The second putative
methyltranferase, CPt10_1471, shows similarity to DNA
methyltranferases from both Clostridium and Campylobacter sp. CP220 and CPt10 have different Campylobacter host ranges (data not shown), the two identified
methyltranferases may enable CPt10 to avoid host

restriction defences in some strains through modification of its own DNA. In addition methylation is known
to be involved in control of gene expression in many
organisms and these enzymes may be involved in such a
process during CPt10 infection, either through modification of its own DNA or by modification and possibly
silencing of host gene expression.
The largest region differentiating these two phages is a
cluster encoding 10 CDSs in CPt10, and 12 in CP220.
The two clusters show little relationship at the nucleotide or amino-acid sequence level but show remarkable
functional conservation, where five CDSs from each
cluster possess conserved radical S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) domains and each cluster appears to posses a
putative glycine amidinotransferase. These regions are
unlikely to have diverged from a common progenitor as
this would require localised mutation rates in these
regions to be much higher than in the surrounding
phage genome. It is more likely these sequences have
been acquired en masse from a related organism,
whether phage or bacterial, by homologous or nonhomologous recombination.
In total there are 11 proteins belonging to the radical
SAM superfamily in CP220 and 12 in CPt10. Radical
SAM proteins are involved in the cleavage of unreactive
C–H bonds in a range of biochemical processes as
diverse as DNA repair, lysine metabolism and the generation of vitamins and cofactors such as biotin, heme
and thiamine [29]. The presence of so many radical
SAM proteins in these phage genomes is highly unusual.
Approximately 27,000 proteins have so far been assigned
to this superfamily, of these the overwhelming majority
(~22,800) are bacterial proteins, with only around 22
having been identified in phage genomes thus far [30].
These proteins are associated with oxygen-independent
oxidation reactions and are often found in anaerobic
organisms; presumably they may also confer a metabolic
advantage at low oxygen tensions, precisely the conditions that Campylobacter faces in the gut lumen. This
analysis identifies a central portion of both phages, carrying five radical SAM genes, as being an interchangeable module with related functions that are likely to be
non-essential for phage proliferation. However, it is possible that these metabolic enzymes could temporarily
improve the competitive fitness of infected Campylobacter thus also benefiting the phage.

CPt10_1891 in CP220 and CPt10 respectively. The
remaining repetitive regions contain between 3 and 17
copies of an approximately 75 bp core repeat unit
(Additional file 1 - Table S2), with minor sequence polymorphisms evident between units both within and
between repeat regions. PCR was used to further examine these repeats in CP220. Six out of the seven regions
examined were shown to produce amplicons of mixed
lengths, despite the template originating from a single
plaque purified population of CP220 (Figure 2). Thus,
the length of these regions would appear to be subject
to variation during phage proliferation and may serve to
create genome diversity. Examination of individual
repeat regions shows the presence of tandem repeats
containing the same sequence polymorphisms, suggesting that expansion (or contraction) could occur by slipstrand mispairing during DNA replication. Other repeat
regions show evidence that recombination or translocation of repeat units has occurred, for example sequences
more characteristic of repeat units within regions 6 and
8 are present in repeat region 9 of CP220, so either
identical sequence changes have occurred at multiple
sites or more likely the repeat units have propagated
themselves in the phage genome.
The generation of genomes of variable length could be
an adaptive mechanism of the phages in response to
conditions in their host or environment, perhaps by
influencing the packaged genome and gene dosage in
the terminally redundant regions. However, it is difficult
to see to what extent these relatively small changes in
genome size would contribute to such a mechanism.
More likely, they may serve as recombination substrates

Repeat regions and genome expansion

CP220 and CPt10 both carry regions of repetitive DNA,
accounting for 3.2% (at 10 loci) and 1.4% (at 8 loci) of
their respective genomes. In all but one instance, common to both phages, the repeat regions are extragenic.
The sole exception being a 21 bp repeat motif found
within the putative coding sequences CPT_0180 and

allowing reassortment of phage genes. For example,
there are three instances in CP220 (flanking CPT_0046,
CPT_0110 to CPT_0113 and CPT_0159 to CPT_0160),
where one or more discrete CDSs are bordered by
repeat sequences. The relative positions of the repeat
regions within the CP220 and CPt10 genomes are generally conserved (Figure 1). Thus, they could also facilitate the exchange of larger segments between closely
related phages. It is clear however that any CP220 and
by corollary CPt10 recovered, is actually but a single
representative of a larger family of related genomes
under continual size-flux, the relative proportions of
which may be dictated by selective environmental
pressures.
Tail proteins

Both CP220 and CPt10 have multiple genes whose products show homology to Gp18 - the tail sheath and
Gp19 - tail tube proteins. Protein sequencing of tryptic
fragments of proteins excised from SDS-PAGE demonstrates that at least two types of Gp18 and two types of
Gp19 are present in mature CP220 virions (Figure 3). It
is unknown whether the individual protein types are
mixed within a single phage virion or if discrete populations exist, with each mature virion containing a single
protein type. Regardless, these variants arise within virus
populations originally propagated from single plaques.
The versions of Gp18 are associated with mobile elements; this suggests a mechanism whereby copies of the
tail sheath genes may be exchanged, thereby enabling
reassortment between related phages and possibly modulating their host range.
Phage replication and packaging

The phages carry genes involved in replication including; putative genes for DNA primase, sliding clamp, sliding clamp loader proteins, DNA polymerase, RNaseH
and DNA ligase, thus replication of the phages is most
likely independent of the host replication complex. Several putative transcription factors are present and may
coordinate gene expression throughout the phages lifecycle; these genes provide inviting targets to examine
transcriptional control during the infection process in
these phages.
Putative terminases with significant similarity to the
T4 large terminase subunit Gp17, 32% identity (143/436
amino acids) for CP220, have been identified in both
phages. Interestingly, the CP220 protein exhibits
sequence conservation within the C-terminal domain,
responsible for the DNA nuclease activity, but not the
N-terminus which has an ATPase function and is
responsible for DNA binding [31]. CP220 also encodes a
putative single-strand DNA binding protein and T4-like
endonuclease VII packaging and recombination enzyme,

each of which have been shown to interact with Gp17
during T4 genome packaging.
Inter and intra-genomic gene flux

Four new insertion sequence (IS) elements, ISCaje1-4,
were identified in the genomes of these two phages, all
belonging to the IS200/IS605 family. In total five separate IS elements were found in the two genomes, four
of which were closely related to each other and belong
to the subgroup that encode only TnpB. ISCaje1 was
found in both CP220 and CPt10, but the two isoforms,
which share 97% DNA identity, have inserted into different locations in each genome. ISCaje2 in CPt10 and
ISCaje3 in CP220 show similarity to each other, but are

Timms et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:214
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/214

sufficiently different to constitute discrete IS elements
(less than 95% identity at the DNA level). Although they
were found to insert at the same target sequence
(ATTTT), their relative genomic locations were different. The presence of related IS elements in both phage
genomes strongly suggests that these phages are derived
from the same lineage. They predate upon the same
range of hosts, thus allowing the transfer of related
insertion elements to occur between phages or between
host and phage genomes. The fourth novel IS element,
ISCaje4, represents a unique insertion in the CP220
genome, and encodes a putative TnpA subunit in addition to TnpB (subgroup IS608).
Whether these insertion elements are active during
infection is unknown, but they may provide mechanisms
whereby regions of the phage genomes can be mobilised, perhaps allowing integration of DNA sequences
into the host chromosome or conversely the integration
of novel genes into the phage genomes. The presence of
putative homing endonucleases at similar sites in both
genomes may also provide a partial exclusion mechanism during infection of multiple phage types, or provide
a means by which transfer of those genes surrounding
the endonuclease can occur, predominantly in favour of
the homing endonuclease carrying phage [32,33].
Genetic transfer between host and virulent phage
genomes can occur; illegitimate recombination allows
the integration of host DNA and if the integrated
fragments carry genes that are useful or advantageous
to the phage, or to hosts that the phage subsequently
infect, they may be maintained in the genome. There
is certainly evidence that genes from diverse sources
have been integrated into both CP220 and CPt10. Fifteen CDSs in CP220 show significant homology to
Campylobacter and its taxonomic relatives Helicobacter, Arcobacter and Wolinella (Table 3). The presence
of such DNA provides an indication of the importance of phage in the transfer and dissemination of
genes between related species as, presumably, if these
genes can mobilise onto the phage genome the
reverse could also be true. Although during the
course of these experiments the gene contents have
remained fixed.
The products of other CDSs encoded by these phages
showed the highest level of sequence identity with those
from Clostridium sp., Bacillus sp., Porphyromonas sp.
and Fusobacterium sp. Thus, the host range of this
phage may not have been limited to C. jejuni and C. coli
but extended to other genera. Consistent with this
notion, these organisms do share common niches with
various Campylobacter sp. and therefore provide opportunities for encounters between phage and bacteria to
occur.

Rohwer has estimated that there are as many as 2 billion phage associated open reading frames still to be discovered and potentially 100 million different phage
genotypes [34]. However, with the availability of an
expanded portfolio of phage genome sequences it has
become evident that while there are undoubtedly a large
number of unique phage genomes, there are many other
cases where phages can be clustered into closely related
phylogenetic groups [3,35]. That these two phages have
maintained their genomes in an almost identical configuration and at such a high level of sequence conservation, despite their independent isolation 14 years apart,
suggests that they are well adapted to their hosts; we
presume that this is Campylobacter, and that just as
host bacterial genomes are under selection by their
environment there are also significant selective pressures
to maintain optimal phage genome structure.
Distribution of CP220 and CPt10 CDSs in other virulent
phage targeting Campylobacter

To explore the possibility that these two bacteriophages
were part of a conserved lineage targeting Campylobacter, we compared a Campylobacter phage (CP8) that we
had partially sequenced years previously. CP8 had been
isolated from chickens independently of both CP220
and CPt10 but unlike the latter had proved refractory to
further molecular analysis [10]. Nevertheless CP8 exhibits significant sequence identity with CP220, ranging
from 56% up to 100% over a total aggregate sequence
length of 11470 bp. We have also extended the current
analysis by designing primers for specific regions within
CP220 and CPt10 that feature insertion sequences,
methylases and structural genes. These primer sets have
been used in PCR experiments with genomic DNA
isolated from the remaining 15 phages of the UK Campylobacter typing scheme.
Five of the phages did not yield DNA amplicons with
any of the primer combinations tested (j1, j4, j7, j12
and j16), either due to gene absence, sequence divergence or DNA modifications that prevent efficient PCR
amplification [36,37]. However, the remaining 10
phages, of disparate origin, share sequence loci with
CP220 and CPt10 (Additional file 3). The typing phages
have previously been classified on the basis of genome
size by Sails et al [17]. Based on this classification
CP220 and CPt10 fall within group II, and it is clear
from Additional file 3 that the majority of the phages
that contain amplicon homologues also belong to group
II. Phages 8, 14 and 15 display particularly good correlation with the genes present in CP220 and CPt10. However, j6 isolated in the USA and belonging to group III,
also shares at least four genes with the CP220/CPt10
family and in this respect is similar to CP8, which is

also a group III phage. Therefore, some genes would
seem to be more widely spread in the sampled Campylobacter phage meta-genome than others.
The late transcription factor identified in both CP220
and CPt10 appears to be present in all of the group II
phages tested but only in one of the group III phages.
This may be indicative that these smaller phages are
indeed different to the group II class, and have different
regulatory factors controlling gene expression. The resolution of these questions requires that we sequence
more genomes from these phages.

Conclusions
We have compared two novel genome sequences from
independently isolated virulent Campylobacter phages and
found them to be extremely similar to each other. Examination of further Campylobacter phages has revealed positive matches between a number of them and the two

genomes sequenced in this paper, with the implication that
the two sequenced phages are well adapted to their particular niche and that there are substantial selective pressures on these phages to maintain this particular genome
configuration. It would suggest that phage genomes are as
susceptible to selection for stability as they are for variability. Genome stability could be aided by the ability of these
phages to display genotypic and phenotypic microvariation
by harboring variable length DNA repeat sequences and
expressing more than one form of structural protein. Concerted sequencing efforts may reveal the fate of these individual phage lineages and elucidate the extent of genetic
flux within Campylobacter bacteriophages and between
organisms sharing similar niches. However, for most
organisms and certainly for Campylobacter, the number of
sequenced phages is insufficient to ascertain how genome
stability would play a role in competition with other phage
that may have adopted alternative evolutionary strategies.

Methods
Campylobacter and Bacteriophage Storage and Growth
Conditions

Campylobacterstrains were stored at -80°C in nutrient
broth No. 2 (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) supplemented with
20% glycerol or Microbank vials (Prolab Diagnostics,
Neston, United Kingdom). Strains were grown on blood
agar base No. 2 (Oxoid) or Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid),
supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood (Oxoid),
for 24-48 h under microaerobic conditions at 42°C.
Bacteriophage were propagated using the whole plate
lysis method, enumerated on C. jejuni strains HPC5
(CP220) or NCTC12668 (CPt10) and subsequently
stored at 4°C in SM buffer as described previously [10].

Ready Gel (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) or 4-12%
Bis-Tris NuPAGE Novex gel (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK),
using the SDS sample and gel running buffers supplied,
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Gels were
run at constant voltage of 200 v for 35-50 min followed
by staining, with colloidal coomassie blue, according to
the manufacturers’ instructions. Protein bands were
excised from the gel, using a sterile scalpel, for mass
spectroscopy analysis.
The gel slices were digested with trypsin, before
undergoing electrospray ionization, with subsequent tandem MS/MS. The peptide fragment ions generated were
analyzed using Mascot Daemon software [43] or MaxEnt3 maximum entropy software (Waters, Milford,
USA).

Bacteriophage Purification

Bacteriophages were purified using caesium chloride equilibrium gradients [38]. The suspension was centrifuged at
264,000 g in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor at 4°C for 24 hours.
Residual caesium chloride was removed using a Microcon
30,000 Da cut off column (Millipore, Watford, UK).

Repeat region PCR

Genome sequencing and analysis

PCR screening of Campylobacter typing phage

For CP220 a whole genome shotgun library was generated from the purified phage DNA. A shotgun sequencing approach was employed using subclone libraries of
size fractionated (inserts 1.4-2 kb and 2-4 kb) phage
DNA cloned into vectors pSMART and pUC19. The
sequence was assembled from 2138 good quality reads
(93% pass rate) that were assembled using Phrap
http://www.phrap.org into 3 contigs. A further 290 finishing reads were required to close the gaps in contigs
and span low coverage regions by re-sequencing existing
library clones or by oligo walks. The finished sequence,
a 177493 bp contig consisting of 2376 reads, has a 10fold read coverage. The CPt10 genome was sequenced
by 454 FLX pyrosequencing and assembled from 34265
sequence reads with an average read length of 173 bps
and constituting a theoretical 34-fold coverage, using
the 454/Roche Newbler assembly program. The gaps
between these contigs were closed by directed PCR and
the products sequenced with BigDye terminator chemistry on ABI3730 capillary sequencers.
Genome annotation was performed as previously
described [39] using Artemis [40]. Insertion sequences
were classified using the ISfinder database [41]. The
genomes of CP220 and CPt10 were compared pair-wise
using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [42].

Primers were designed using the CP220 and CPt10 genome sequences to amplify genes of interest including;
insertion sequences, methylases and structural genes.
Primer sequences are shown in Additional file 5 along
with an indication of which genome sequence was used
for the design of each primer pair using Primer3 [44].

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and proteomics

Purified phage at log10 10 PFU ml-1 were prepared for
loading to a 4-15% gradient Tris-HCl polyacrylamide

Primers used in the amplification of CP220 repeat
sequences are shown in Additional file 4. The CP220
genomic sequence was used to design primers in unique
flanking regions for each repeat region.
