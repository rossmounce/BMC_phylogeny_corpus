Abstract
Background: Gremmeniella abietina (Lagerb.) Morelet is an ascomycete fungus that causes stem
canker and shoot dieback in many conifer species. The fungus is widespread and causes severe
damage to forest plantations in Europe, North America and Asia. To facilitate early diagnosis and
improve measures to control the spread of the disease, rapid, specific and sensitive detection
methods for G. abietina in conifer hosts are needed.
Results: We designed two pairs of specific primers for G. abietina based on the 18S rDNA
sequence variation pattern. These primers were validated against a wide range of fungi and 14
potential conifer hosts. Based on these specific primers, two nested PCR systems were developed.
The first system employed universal fungal primers to enrich the fungal DNA targets in the first
round, followed by a second round selective amplification of the pathogen. The other system
employed G. abietina-specific primers in both PCR steps. Both approaches can detect the presence
of G. abietina in composite samples with high sensitivity, as little as 7.5 fg G. abietina DNA in the
host genomic background.
Conclusion: The methods described here are rapid and can be applied directly to a wide range of
conifer species, without the need for fungal isolation and cultivation. Therefore, it represents a
promising alternative to disease inspection in forest nurseries, plantations and quarantine control
facilities.

Background
Gremmeniella abietina (Lagerb.) Morelet is among the
most destructive conifer forest pathogens in the northern
hemisphere. This ascomycete fungus has a broad host
range and causes stem canker and shoot dieback in many
conifer species of the genera Pinus, Abies, Picea, Larix, Tsuga
and Pseudotsuga [1-3]. In Sweden, G. abietina is found on
the two native conifers Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, as
well as the introduced species, Pinus contorta [4-6].

Under favorable conditions, the life cycle of G. abietina
takes two years to complete [5]. The fungus may grow in
the host as an endophyte for more than one year [7,8],
and infected trees can remain undetected for several years
before manifesting visible symptoms. This poses difficulties for diagnosing disease at an early stage, using asymptomatic materials. Nursery seedling inspection and
quarantine control require sensitive detection methods to
limit the spread of the pathogen. Various morphological,
physiological, pathogenic and biochemical characters and

molecular markers have been employed to distinguish
and characterize different races and types of the fungus,
such as the North American race (NA), European (EU)
race, and large tree type (LTT) and small tree type (STT) [915]. Most of these methods require isolation of the fungus
in culture. This process is time consuming and is not
appropriate for the detection of the fungus directly in
infected but asymptomatic tissues.
Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based detection
methods are sensitive and robust techniques when used in
plant disease diagnostic research. By employing specific
PCR primers it is possible to selectively amplify the pathogen from infected tissues without the need for isolation.
Among the different PCR techniques, nested PCR (a twostep PCR system in which the first round PCR products are
subjected to a second round PCR amplification with more
specific primers) is extremely sensitive and allows the
detection of a fungal pathogen in minute amounts of
infected material [16-18]. Recently, a nested PCR procedure was developed for the detection of G. abietina [19].
This method is based on the polymorphic sites in the
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS).
The ITS evolves rapidly and significant variations within a
species or even within a genome have been reported for
fungi and plants [20-23]. The specific markers from the
ITS region are, therefore, potentially unstable because of
the high mutation rate, and would need to be validated by
extensive sample testing. The 18S rRNA gene is much
more conservative compared to the ITS. Specific markers
developed from this DNA region are less likely to be
invalid due to intraspecific variations producing false negative detections.
The aim of the present study was to develop a stable, specific and sensitive method for detecting G. abietina infection in a broad range of hosts. There was no intention to
differentiate between the races/types of the fungus, which
would be difficult using this conserved DNA segment. The
18S rRNA gene was sequenced from G. abietina isolated

from four host species. Highly specific primers were
designed for G. abietina, based on extensive sequence
homology analysis. Two nested PCR systems were developed for sensitive detection of the pathogen in host tissues. The first system employed fungal universal primers
in the first round PCR, to enrich the fungal rDNA in the
plant genomic background, followed by the specific
amplification of G. abietina rDNA in the second round
PCR. The second system employed G. abietina specific
primers in both PCR rounds. Both approaches can detect
the presence of G. abietina in composite samples with high
sensitivity. This procedure is rapid and can be used
directly on plant materials without the need for fungal
isolation and subsequent cultivation. The methods
described here represent a promising alternative to disease
inspection in forest nurseries, plantations and quarantine
control facilities.

Results
Specific amplification of G. abietina
The fungal universal primer pair NS1/8 gave an amplification product of about 1700 bp for all of the 58 fungal
strains tested, except Stachybotrys bisbyi which produced
a larger PCR fragment (Fig. 2A). None of the 14 conifer
species produced any amplicon with this primer pair,
demonstrating the incompatibility of the primers to conifer 18S rDNA. The two pairs of specific primers,
NS.Grem3/4 and NS.Grem5/6, amplified fragments of
1080 bp and 837 bp, respectively, only in G. abietina (Fig.
2B, C). No amplified products were generated from samples of any of the other fungi and plants with these two
primer pairs. When used as inner primers in nested PCR,
in combination with NS1/8 as outer primers, NS.Grem3/
4 and NS.Grem5/6 gave amplification patterns identical
to those in corresponding single-step PCR assays. The
nested PCR using NS.Grem3/4 as outer primers and

Comparison of detection sensitivity between single-step PCR
assays. A, universal primers NS1/8; B, specific primers
NS.Grem3/4; C, specific primers NS.Grem5/6. A 10-fold dilution series of G. abietina was used as the template.

NS.Grem5/6 as inner primers gave an amplification pattern identical to that of NS.Grem5/6. No amplifications
were observed for any of the plants and fungi except for G.
abietina by any of the nested PCR (amplification pattern
identical to Fig. 2B, C, thus not shown). These tests were
performed in 3 – 5 replicates and the same specific amplification pattern was observed. The only difference
between the nested PCR and the single-step specific PCR
was that the amplification signals were stronger for the
nested PCR. Thus, the prime pairs NS.Grem3/4 and
NS.Grem5/6 are highly specific to G. abietina at annealing
temperatures of 60°C and 56°C, respectively, both in single-step specific PCR and in two-step nested PCR. The lack
of cross-amplification from any of the conifer species in
either of the PCR systems demonstrates the scope for specific detection of the pathogen in all these hosts.
Evaluation of detection sensitivity
If the method is to be used for the early detection of infection in bulked samples in forest practice, a high level of
sensitivity is required. Three different tests using a dilution series of G. abietina genomic DNA, with and without
other background DNA, were conducted to compare the
detection limits of the different PCR setups. The lowest
DNA dilution that could provide a reproducible, unambiguous visible signal (in 3 µl PCR product) on ethidium
bromide stained gels after electrophoresis was defined as
the PCR detection limit.

Both the universal primers and the specific primers were
tested first in single-step PCR assays. As shown in Fig. 3,
all three pairs of primers can detect 0.15 ng DNA template. Among the three primer pairs, NS.Grem3/4 gave the
strongest amplification signal indicating greater PCR efficiency than the other two. Nevertheless, the magnitude of
detection sensitivity was the same for all three single-step
PCR systems. By combining NS1/8 amplification with a

second round amplification using either of the specific
primer pairs in a nested PCR, the detection sensitivity dramatically increased. As little as 15 fg G. abietina DNA can
be detected, approximately equivalent to a single fungal
genome (Fig. 4a, b Test 1). The nested PCR using
NS.Grem3/4 followed by NS.Grem5/6 gave a detection
sensitivity similar to the two NS1/8-based methods
though with even stronger amplification signal (Fig. 4c
Test 1). Thus, the nested PCR is about 10,000 times more
sensitive than the single step PCR assays.
To simulate the detection of G. abietina in a host's
genomic background, the dilution series of G. abietina
DNA was mixed with P. contorta DNA in equal volume
and subjected to nested PCR analysis (Test 2, Table 2). The
amplification resulted in a detection limit of 7.5 fg G. abietina DNA in the background of 6 ng of P. contorta DNA
(i.e. a millionth of the quantity of host DNA, Fig. 4 Test
2). This test was performed in 3 – 5 replicates and the
same magnitude of detection sensitivity was observed.
This result is very similar to the detection limit achieved
with G. abietina DNA alone (Fig. 4 Test 1). Thus, the presence of P. contorta DNA, even at very high relative concentrations, did not affect the efficiency of the nested PCR for
detecting G. abietina.

To simulate the detection of G. abietina in a composite
fungal background, the dilution series of G. abietina DNA
was mixed with equal volumes of DNA from seven other
fungi (Test 3, Table 2). In contrast to the previous two
tests, this composite fungal DNA produced a visible
amplification product (ca. 1.7 Kb in size) in all seven
DNA dilution mixtures after the first round PCR with universal fungal primers (data not shown). This was due to
the presence of background fungal DNA (ca. 9 ng) in all
PCR mixes, no matter how little G. abietina DNA was
present: the NS1/8 primers were compatible with all of
the fungi in the mixture. Following the nested PCR, the
detection limit was 0.075 ng G. abietina DNA in the background of 9 ng of other fungal DNA (i.e. about a hundredth of the fungal background DNA, Fig. 4a, b Test 3).
This is a pronounced decrease in detection sensitivity
compared to Tests 1 and 2. In contrast, the detection sensitivity of the nested PCR using the specific primers in
both PCR steps was not affected by the presence of other
fungal DNA, and gave the same detection sensitivity as in
Test 1 and 2 (Fig. 4c Test 3).

and green needles from the infected trees of P. contorta
were used for DNA isolation and PCR amplifications. All
the nested PCR assays detected G. abietina in the needle
samples from the infected twigs, which gave clear products of 1080 bp and 837 bp long with the inner primer
pairs NS.Grem3/4 and NS.Grem5/6, respectively (Fig. 5).
Neither the healthy P. contorta sample, nor the negative
control produced any amplification product (Fig. 5). This
verifies that the nested PCR product from the needle samples was amplified from G. abietina.

Discussion
Gremmeniella abietina is widespread and causes severe
damage to several conifer species. Large-scale forest epidemics have been reported from several continents
[1,6,24-26]. The disease can spread through infected seedling nurseries. Intercontinental migration of the pathogen
has also been reported as a result of international transportation of infected forest materials [27,28]. Rapid detection methods that can be applied directly to
asymptomatic tissues would be valuable for forest disease
management. Previously reported methods for the morphological, biochemical, pathogenic or genetic characterization of this fungus require its isolation in culture
[14,28-31]. Such characterization allows the species to be
subdivided into different races and types. However, host

differentiation of the fungus is very limited and different
races/types can coexist in the same geographic region and
infect the same host species [27,29,30,32,33]. Therefore,
for forest management, a general detection method for G.
abietina, regardless of race/type, would be highly desirable. The identical 18S rDNA sequences from G. abietina of
NA, EU, LTT and STT race/type isolated from different
hosts indicate that, in this fungus, the sequence is conservative. Therefore, markers based on it exhibit general
intraspecific applicability. A high specificity of the detection system is a prerequisite for its application in pathogen diagnosis. The specific primers developed in this
study successfully detected G. abietina at species level and,
thus, can function as rapid molecular markers for its identification and detection in composite fungal or plant samples without the need for isolation and cultivation. By
verifying these DNA markers in a wide range of conifer
species, the present study indicates that this detection system can be applied to all potential hosts, so it should be a
valuable forest management tool across broad geographic
regions.

Apart from the specificity, the sensitivity of a detection
system is also important for early infection diagnosis, particularly in bulk samples. The sensitivity of a PCR assay
depends on several factors, most importantly on the
primer composition, structure and homology to the target
molecule. In this study, when the three pairs of primers,
NS1/8, NS.Grem3/4 and NS.Grem5/6, were tested on G.
abietina DNA in single-step PCR with the same number of
cycles, NS.Grem3/4 was found to be ca. 10 times more
efficient than the other two pairs. The higher amplification efficiency of NS.Grem3/4 was consistent across all
PCR assays (Fig. 4). Thus, careful design and selection of
the primers can significantly improve the sensitivity of a
PCR assay.
Nested PCR was employed in this study to improve the
detection sensitivity of the pathogen in the hosts. The use
of universal fungal primers in the first round PCR enriches
the fungal rDNA in the plant genomic background, then,
in the second round, there is selective amplification of the
target pathogen. This approach is particularly attractive

tivity for G. abietina even in a high background of other
fungal DNA. In real situations, the detection systems
would usually be used on either suspected G. abietina
infections or asymptomatic tissues. DNA isolated from
these materials would mostly comprise the host DNA and
DNA from endophytic fungi. G. abietina may or may not
be the major component among the endophytic fungi.
Thus, the nested PCR system using specific primers in
both PCR steps would satisfy both the specificity and sensitivity requirements for diagnostic applications.
In the analysis of plant samples, extraction of sufficient
fungal genomic DNA is also important since the fungal
tissue is usually present at low levels relative to the
amount of host tissue. If this is not achieved, the detection
sensitivity may be inadequate and could result in a false
negative. For large conifer trees, the stage and degree of the
disease development as well as tissue sampling position
would also affect the pathogen's detection. In the early
stage of infection the amount and the spread of fungal
mycelia is limited. Tissues from parts of the tree other
than the close vicinity of the infection site may give negative detection. Thus, for large conifers multiple samples
should be collected from the suspected tree for examination.

when screening for multiple fungal pathogens in minor
amount of plant tissue. The nested PCR developed in this
study can detect as little as a single fungal genome even in
high background levels of pine DNA. The template DNA
concentration and composition can influence the efficiency of nested PCR. In the presence of a high proportion
of other fungal DNA the detection limit of nested PCR
with outer primers being the fungal universal primers
NS1/8 was significantly decreased, mainly due to primer
competition in the first round PCR. Since the universal
primers are compatible with all the fungi in the mixture,
the very small proportion of G. abietina present (<0.1%)
would have little chance to compete for the primers. The
target template was, therefore, not enriched in the first
round PCR, which in turn affected the nested PCR sensitivity. This problem can be avoided by employing G. abietina-specific primers in both PCR rounds. The nested
PCR based on this approach showed high detection sensi-

This study developed rapid, specific and sensitive detection systems for the conifer pathogen G. abietina. The specific markers were validated for a broad range of conifer
hosts and fungi. Thus, the detection methods described
here could have broad applications in forest protection
and disease management programs. It should be also recognized that different race/types of G. abietina have distinct epidemiological and aetiological attributes and the
ideal molecular assay should allow the user to identify not
only the species but also the races and biotypes. The assay
reported here could be used in combination with other
race or biotype-specific assays [12,19], either in a multiplex or in a sequential fashion, to better understand the
distribution and disease development of different G. abietina infections.

Methods
Fungal strains, plant species and genomic DNA extraction
Gremmeniella abietina was isolated from Pinus sylvestris,
P. contorta, P. resinosa and P. banksiana (Table 1). Eleven
isolates representing NA, EU, LTT and STT race/type were
sequenced for the 18S rRNA gene (Table 1). Thirty-one
other fungal strains, from 15 Ascomycota genera, were
included in this study to determine the specificity of the
markers developed for G. abietina (Table 2). These fungi
were selected taking into account their 18S rDNA-based
phylogenetic relationships to G. abietina [34], so both
closely related and divergent groups were included. Pure

cultures of these fungi were used for DNA isolation. Phylogenetic study has shown that species in the Helotiales
and Rhytismatales are closely related to Gremmeniella
[35] and many of them are plant pathogenies. We could
not include them in the tests due to the lack of fungal
material. However, 18S rDNA sequences of 40 species of
Helotiales and Rhytismatales were downloaded from
GenBank for sequence analysis.
Fourteen conifer species from three families (Pinaceae,
Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae) were selected to represent
the potential range of hosts (Table 2). Since pines are
most susceptible to this pathogen, eight pine species
native to Asia, Europe and North America were selected,
representing the two Pinus subgenera: Pinus and Strobus.
Three other reported hosts of G. abietina were also
included: Picea, Abies and Larix. Seeds of each species were
germinated on sterilized Petri dish for 2 – 3 weeks and
used for DNA isolation. Twigs from six infected trees of P.
contorta were collected in the forest of northern Sweden.
From these, both brown and green needles were collected
for DNA isolation.
The fungal genomic DNAs were isolated from a pure culture of each strain following the procedure described by
Wu et al [36]. The genomic DNAs of the conifer species
were isolated using a DNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Germany). The pine needles were thoroughly homogenized, as follows. Two ceramic beads, 4 mm in diameter
(Iuchi, Japan) and 350 mg of 0.5 mm zirconia-silica beads
(Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA), were
placed in a 2-ml microtube containing 100 mg pine needles. The tubes were placed in a Mini-Bead Beater (Biospec
Products, Inc.) and homogenized for 2 min at the maximum speed. The rest of the isolation procedure followed
that suggested by the manufacturer of the DNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany).

Specific primers
The 11 G. abietina isolates sequenced for the 18S rRNA
gene produced identical sequences, with one exception of
a single substitution among them (GenBank accession
numbers see Table 1). This sequence was aligned with the
18S rRNA sequences of the 31 other fungal strains listed
in Table 2 as well as 40 Helotiales and Rhytismatales fungi
accessed from GenBank (data not shown). Unique
sequence patterns to G. abietina were utilized to design
specific primers. Two pairs of primers, NS.Grem3/4 and
NS.Grem5/6 (Fig. 1), were designed for G. abietina. To
ensure the specificity of the PCR assay, these primers were
first screened against sequences in GenBank using the
BLAST function to examine their possible homology to
other fungi. The "Search for short, nearly exact matches"
program was used. These primers showed >20% mismatches to any other fungal sequences in GenBank
including the 40 18S rDNA sequences of Helotiales and
Rhytismatales. Under stringent PCR conditions, a >20%
mismatch between the target molecule and the primer
would not result in specific amplification.
Nested PCR
To increase the detection sensitivity, two nested PCR systems were developed. One approach used the 18S rDNAbased universal fungal primers NS1 and NS8 [37] as outer
primers in the first round PCR. Amplification was performed in a volume of 25 µl containing 1 – 5 ng of template DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 0.75 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen Life Technologies, USA), 200 µM
of each dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, USA), and
1.5 mM MgCl2. PCR conditions were optimized to comprise an initial denaturation of 3 min at 95°C, followed
by 36 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 45°C for 45 s and 72°C for
90 s, followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. A 1
µl aliquot of the first round PCR product was used as the
template in the second round, using the G. abietina-spe-

cific primers NS.Grem3/4 or NS.Grem5/6. The PCR conditions for these two specific primer pairs were similar to
the NS1/8 amplification, except that the PCR cycles were
decreased to 25 in the second round PCR and the annealing temperatures were 60°C and 56°C for NS.Grem3/4
and NS.Grem5/6, respectively. In another approach, G.
abietina-specific primer pair NS.Grem3/4 was used in the
first round PCR and NS.Grem5/6 in the second round.
The PCR procedure is the same as that described above. A
negative control was included in all PCR runs. PCR products (3 µl) were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.4% agarose gels in 1× TAE buffer. The gels were stained with
ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light using a
Gel Doc 2000 fluorescent gel documentation system (BioRad, USA).

Sensitivity evaluation
To determine the detection limit of the nested PCR, three
DNA dilution series were created and subjected to the PCR
analysis (Table 3). First, a 10-fold dilution series of G. abietina genomic DNA was tested (Test 1). The initial DNA
concentration of 5 ng/µl was quantified using a GeneQuant Pro RNA/DNA Calculator spectrophotometer
(Amersham Biosciences, Sweden). To simulate the detection of infection in a host, this dilution series of G. abietina DNA was mixed with genomic DNA (4 ng/µl) of P.
contorta in equal volume (Test 2). A 3 µl aliquot of this
mixture at each dilution (equivalent to 1.5 µl of G. abietina DNA solution plus 1.5 µl of P. contorta genomic
DNA) was used in each PCR (Test 2). A third test was conducted to simulate the detection of G. abietina in a mixed
fungal background. For this, genomic DNAs of seven
fungi Aspergillus ochraceus, Penicillium brevicompactum, Trichoderma viride, Eurotium herbariorum, Fusarium culmorum, Ulocladium botrytis and Phacidium
infestans were mixed in equal quantities. The final concentration of this composite DNA was 6 ng/µl. The 10fold dilution series of G. abietina DNA was mixed with
this composite fungal DNA in equal volume for PCR analyses (Test 3). A 3 µl aliquot of this mixture at each dilution
was used in each PCR (Test 3). To compare the sensitivity
and specificity of single-step PCR and nested PCR, the 10fold dilution series of G. abietina genomic DNA was also
analyzed directly with the inner specific primers
NS.Grem3/4 and NS.Grem5/6 in a single-step PCR. All
the experiments conducted in this study were repeated 3 –
5 times.
