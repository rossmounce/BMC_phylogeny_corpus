Background: Brown algae of the genus Ectocarpus exhibit high levels of genetic diversity and variability in
morphological and physiological characteristics. With the establishment of E. siliculosus as a model and the
availability of a complete genome sequence, it is now of interest to analyze variability among different species,
ecotypes, and strains of the genus Ectocarpus both at the genome and the transcriptome level.
Results: We used an E. siliculosus gene expression microarray based on EST sequences from the genomesequenced strain (reference strain) to carry out comparative genome hybridizations for five Ectocarpus strains: four
E. siliculosus isolates (the male genome strain, a female strain used for outcrosses with the genome strain, a strain
isolated from freshwater, and a highly copper-tolerant strain), as well as one strain of the sister species
E. fasciculatus. Our results revealed significant genomic differences between ecotypes of the same species, and
enable the selection of conserved probes for future microarray experiments with these strains. In the two closely
related strains (a male and a female strain used for crosses), genomic differences were also detected, but
concentrated in two smaller genomic regions, one of which corresponds to a viral insertion site.
Conclusion: The high variability between strains supports the concept of E. siliculosus as a complex of cryptic
species. Moreover, our data suggest that several parts of the Ectocarpus genome may have evolved at different
rates: high variability was detected particularly in transposable elements and fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding
proteins.

Background
Brown algae are multicellular and almost exclusively
marine organisms, which live along the coastlines of all
continents. They are economically important [1] as a
food product mainly in Asian countries, as animal food
or fertilizer due to their high mineral and trace element
contents, and as a source of polysaccharides such as
alginates. More recently, additional uses, e.g. as a
resource for drug development, as a biofuel resource, or
as nutrient- and heavy metal uptake systems, have also
been explored (see [2] for a review). Brown algae are
ecologically significant as they form the dominant vegetation in the intertidal and subtidal zone of rocky

shores; large species, such as giant kelps, provide habitats for many other organisms [2]. Being part of the heterokont lineage within the chromalveolate kingdom,
brown algae have evolved independently from other
multicellular eukaryotes, including land plants and red
and green algae [3]. In spite of their importance, there
are still many gaps in our knowledge about brown algae,
such as the mechanisms involved in their development,
their complex life cycles [4], and their responses to
stress.
Among brown algae, Ectocarpus siliculosus has a long
history of research [5], and was chosen as a genetic
model [6] due to its small genome and its short life
cycle. Its genome has recently been sequenced and
annotated, and is the first available for any seaweed [7].
Until recently, it was generally accepted that the genus
Ectocarpus included only two species, E. siliculosus and

E. fasciculatus. The cosmopolitan E. siliculosus, however,
shows a particularly high level of genetic diversity and
probably contains several cryptic species; one of which has
been taxonomically re-instated as E. crouaniorum [8-10].
In addition to this genetic diversity, Ectocarpus also
exhibits a considerable degree of physiological plasticity,
and some strains have been isolated from quite extreme
physiological conditions, such as freshwater [11,12] and
a site that was severely polluted with heavy metals [13].
Such ecotypes constitute a valuable resource for the
study of adaptation to different environments, as
demonstrated by numerous reports for terrestrial plants,
comparing e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana and the closely
related halophyte Thellungiella salsuginea (reviewed in
[14]). In Ectocarpus a similar comparison of two strains
has been performed on a proteomic level, highlighting
for instance the importance of a photosystem II Mnstabilizing protein and of a fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c
binding protein (FCP) during the adaptation to high
levels of copper [13].
Microarray experiments could provide valuable
insights into the biology of different ecotypes as well as
into their specific adaptations, as they allow transcript
abundances to be assayed for a large number of genes at
a comparatively low cost. Currently, an expression array
based on the genome-sequenced strain of E. siliculosus
is available, which comprises 68,270 probes for 17,119
sequences, including 8,165 contigs and 8,874 singletons
from several expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries [15].
However, considering the present uncertainty with
respect to the presence of cryptic species within E. siliculosus and physiological differences between the
strains, caution needs to be taken when using this array
for other strains [16]: cross-hybridization, alternative
splicing, and sequence divergence may significantly
decrease the accuracy of such experiments.
Comparative genome hybridization (CGH) experiments, using expression arrays and genomic DNA
(gDNA), have been used as a means of assessing the
suitability of microarrays for cross-strain and/or crossspecies hybridizations. This was first demonstrated by
Ranz et al. [17] for two closely related species of Drosophila, and has been successfully applied in land plants
[18,19]. The results from such CGH experiments can be
used to mask probes with high inter-strain and interspecies variability, thus increasing the accuracy of
expression analyses carried out with alternative strains
or species. Moreover, in spite of the limitations imposed
by the use of gene expression arrays, cross-species
hybridizations may also yield information on rapidly
evolving or highly conserved gene sets. For example, in
a recent analysis of two related species of soybean, the
highest degree of conservation was observed for genes
involved in basic metabolic processes such as

Page 2 of 12

photosynthesis, while a high degree of variability was
observed for signal transduction genes such as transcription factors [20].
In this study, we used a similar approach. CGH
experiments were performed with five different strains
of Ectocarpus and three objectives in mind: 1) to estimate the genomic variability between strains; 2) to facilitate future cross-strain gene expression experiments by
enabling the masking of divergent probes; and 3) to
identify possible rapidly evolving gene families and/or
genomic regions.

Results and Discussion
Selection of strains

Five Ectocarpus strains from different origins (Table 1)
were selected based both on their phenotypic characteristivcs and on their classification within the taxonomic
clades defined by Stache-Crain et al. [8]. In our study,
the species name E. siliculosus is used to refer collectively to clades 1-4 of this phylogeny.
Strain 1 is the genome-sequenced strain of E. siliculosus. ESTs produced for this strain were used for the
design of the gene expression array. This strain falls into
clade 1c of the Stache-Crain et al. [8] phylogeny, and
served as a reference strain for all hybridizations. Strain
2 falls into the same clade [9] (Table 1), and is known
to be cross-fertile with strain 1, but exhibits a high
degree of genetic polymorphism. Strains 1 and 2 were
used to construct the recently published genetic map for
Ectocarpus [21]. Strain 3 was chosen as it is the only
well documented isolate from freshwater [11,12]. Its
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 region, which was
sequenced in this study, revealed that it falls into clade
2d. Strain 4, which belongs to clade 1a, was of particular
interest due to its high tolerance to copper and also
because of the available proteomic data [13]. Finally,
strain 5 belongs to a different species (E. fasciculatus),
and was chosen as an outgroup to assist the interpretation of the degrees of variance observed within the different E. siliculosus strains. The relative genetic
distances between the examined strains, based on an
alignment of the ITS1 region, are displayed in Figure 1.
Reliability of the CGH experiments

In order to assess the reproducibility of our CGH
experiments, a reference-reference hybridization was
carried out with gDNA from two independent cultures
of strain 1 (labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 respectively). The
results of this experiment demonstrated that only 166 of
the 68,270 probes (0.24%) exhibited log2-differences in
signal intensity > 1 (i.e. > 2-fold change). A more
detailed examination revealed that 90 of these 166
probes (54%) were not associated to a genomic supercontig (Sctg). Overall this was the case for 2,676 probes

(3.9%, see Methods for additional details), indicating that
a part of these sequences might correspond to contamination in the ESTs and/or to low complexity regions
that are difficult to sequence.
The reference-reference experiment therefore demonstrated a high degree of technical reproducibility in

microarray experiments employing gDNA. One reason
for this can be found in the distribution of absolute signal intensities obtained with gDNA, compared to cDNA
(Figure 2). Genomic DNA-based CGH experiments
result in signal intensity distributions with a maximum
at medium signal intensities and thus high signal to
noise ratios, because all genes are present in similar
copy numbers. In contrast, cDNA or RNA experiments
need to accommodate large differences in transcript

to the distribution of the Cy3-channel signals from the referencereference experiment, while the cDNA curve represents the first
control sample of a previous gene expression experiment carried
out with the same strain and the same array under similar
hybridization conditions [15]. In cDNA experiments, many targets
are present at low copy number (low signal) and a few sequences
are present in high copy number (high signal). In contrast, in gDNA
experiments, most targets are present at the same copy number,
resulting in a peak at medium intensity.

abundance, resulting in many probes giving low signals
and overall lower signal to noise ratios. In the light of
these findings, and as the nuclear genome within the
same strain may be assumed to be constant, all CGH
experiments were only carried out with a single replicate. Changes in the content of organellar DNA could
theoretically also be detected using our experimental
setup. However, this would require testing biological
replicates as the number of organelles and/or their DNA
content may be subject to variations according to the
conditions of the culture [22-24]. These changes were
therefore not examined in this study.
Marked genetic differences support the presence of
cryptic species

CGH analysis of the different strains indicated that
strains 1 and 2, which are known to be fully compatible
[9,21], have very similar genome sequences: the standard
deviation of the log2-ratios from the array comparison
for these strains was 0.3 (see Figure 3 for a distribution
of log2-ratios), which was the same as that obtained for
the reference-reference hybridization using two independent samples of strain 1, and close to values obtained
for similar experiments in bacteria [25].
In comparison, for the freshwater- and copper-tolerant
strains (strains 3 and 4), standard deviations, compared to
the reference strain, were 0.8 and 0.7 respectively. These
values were close to the value obtained for the outgroup
strain (E. fasciculatus, strain 5), which was 0.9. These data
agree well the phylogenetic tree of the examined strains
(Figure 1), supporting the idea that E. siliculosus may be a
complex of several (cryptic) species [8-10].

Figure 3 Distribution of log2-ratios (sample strain/reference
strain 1) in the examined strains of Ectocarpus. “Strain 1”
designates a reference-reference hybridization of two independent
samples of strain 1. The apparent shift of the curve for strain 5
towards positive values is likely to be an artefact caused by the
normalization procedure. Probe frequencies were calculated in
intervals of 0.2.

Selection of conserved probes for future microarray
experiments

In spite of the marked genetic differences between
strains, analysis of the DNA hybridization data showed
that the microarray can still be exploited to analyze gene
expression in all the strains tested except for strain 5 (see
below), provided only conserved probes are selected for
the analysis [19]. If a very stringent threshold for masking
probes in cross strain experiments was chosen, e.g. 0.5
(1.4-fold change in signal intensity), a number of probes
could be retained from microarray experiments: 64,608
(95%), 32,501 (48%), and 36,336 (53%) for strains 2, 3,
and 4, respectively. Moreover, because each sequence is
represented by four probes, expression profiles may be
obtained for 16,845 (98%, strain 2), 14,554 (85%, strain
3), and 15,078 (88%, strain 4) sequences, respectively. In
many cases, i.e. in experiments that do not rely on direct
inter-strain comparisons but rather on comparison of the
same strain submitted to different treatments, a less
stringent cut-off such as an absolute log2-ratio of 1 may
be more appropriate, and would allow even more probes
to be retained.
For strain 5, our current analysis does not provide any
reliable selection criteria for conserved probes, as Figure
3 indicates that a bias might have been introduced during the normalization procedure. Unless specific probes
are used for normalization, most normalization algorithms assume that the majority of probes yield similar
signals for both of the examined samples. Although we
used the popLowess algorithm [26], which has been
designed to be less sensitive to copy number imbalances
(or changes in sequence), we observed a high number of
probes that exhibit a log2-ratio of 1.1 (Figure 3) for
strain 5. The maximum number of probes would be
expected at a log2-ratio of 0, as for the other strains,
and a shift towards positive values suggests that the
number of divergent probes was too high for the algorithm to function correctly. This strain was therefore
excluded from further analyses.
To facilitate the selection of probes for strains 2 to 4,
we created a Java application, which can be used to
remove a list of probes from raw pair files, prior to normalization using the NimbleScan software (Additional
file 1). Along with this program, we also provide a list
of all probes with log2-changes greater than 0.5 and
greater than 1. In addition, this program could also be
applied to our data to pre-select probes based on their
absolute signal intensity rather than the similarity
between test- and reference strain. This approach has
been suggested to decrease noise in RNA-based crossspecies hybridizations [20,27], but was not further
explored here, as unlike in typical gene expression
experiments, almost all probes produced medium to
high intensity signals (Figure 2).

In strain 1, a large DNA virus closely related to EsV-1
[28] was identified in genomic Sctg_52. In spite of the
presence of this virus in the genome, symptoms of viral
infection have not been observed in this strain, and
transcriptomic data suggested that the viral genes are
not transcribed [7]. As strains 3 and 4 showed similar
signal intensities in this region compared to the reference strain, both strains may also contain the viral genome, although, as with the reference strain, production
of viral particles was not observed.
In strain 2, the region of the viral insertion on Sctg_52
exhibited 2.2-fold lower signal intensities compared to
strain 1 (Figure 4). Nevertheless, for several genes of
this Sctg, the log2-ratio between the two strains reached
zero, and even positive values in one case (viral gene
EsV-1-231, Figure 4). As the viral genome is present in
a single copy in the reference strain, this difference
could be due either to the absence of viral sequences
within the genome of strain 2, in which case the
remaining signals for strain 2 could be explained either
by non-specific binding, or by the presence of highly
divergent EsV-1-like sequences, such as a degenerated
version of EsV-1. In cultures of strain 2, we have not
observed any symptoms of viral infection.

log2-ratio

To determine whether the divergent probes were distributed randomly throughout the genome, the normalized log2-ratios of strains 1-4 were analyzed at two
levels: at the regional level, in order to determine highly
variable genomic regions as well as duplications or deletions, and at the gene or EST level, to determine if particular functional groups of genes exhibited higher
differences than others.
For the first (regional) analysis, microarray probes
were positioned on the various genomic supercontigs
and sets of 30 probes were screened using a sliding window approach (see Methods). Three areas with markedly
different hybridization patterns were detected (Figure 4).
Each region was then examined using quantitative PCR
(Table 2). One of the three differences was found in
strain 3, where a small region on Sctg_16 containing
mainly transposable elements (TEs), had significantly
lower signals compared to the reference strain (2-fold in
the CGH experiment, 1.2-fold in the quantitative PCR
validation), and will be discussed below. The two other
regions were both found to differ between strains 1 and
2, which are the genetically closest strains. One concerned the E. siliculosus virus 1 (EsV-1), and the second
a rather small genomic Sctg, both of which will be discussed in the following section.

E. fasciculatus (strain 5) was not included in this analysis (Sctg =

An alternative explanation can be provided by an
observation made in a previous study: Müller et al. [29]
detected amplification of a viral gene in a population of
Ectocarpus sp. at different annealing temperatures
depending on the individual, suggesting the presence of
several distinct, but genetically similar, viruses within
the same population. The hypothesis that strain 2

contains such a related E. siliculosus virus integrated
into its genome would agree with the profiles observed
in this study. Further information about the viral genes
potentially present in strain 2, including their insertion
sites, might provide clues as to which common features
could be responsible for the silencing of viral gene
expression.
The second region exhibiting significant differences
between strain 1 and strain 2 was a small supercontig
(Sctg_68). Just as for the EsV-1 region, signals were significantly lower in strain 2 (2.5-fold on average), and in
the quantitative PCR analysis two of four primer pairs
amplified only in strain 1, while two others indicated
no or only a 1.7-fold decrease (factor 0.6, Table 2) in
strain 2. Again, these differences could be due to two
reasons: deletion(s), or very high variability of this
region in strain 2. The first hypothesis seems unlikely
because of the wide range of differences in signal
intensities on Sctg_68 (log2-ratios from -3.4 to 0.4),
comprising several probes with ratios close to 0.
Furthermore two of the four primer pairs also yielded
amplicons in strain 2. Regarding the second hypothesis
based on low sequence identity between the strains,
sex related differences could provide a possible explanation and work is currently being carried out to test
this hypothesis (Coelho & Cock, personal communication). Sctg_68 is predicted to encode 21 proteins, 14 of
which are (conserved) hypothetical proteins with
unknown functions.

Functional analysis of highly conserved and highly
variable genes

To identify functional groups of genes that were subject
to particularly high conservation or variation, we examined each of the contigs and singletons used for the
design of the array. Contigs and singletons were defined
as “conserved” if none of the four probes associated
with each sequence exhibited an absolute log2-ratio
with the reference strain > 1, and as “variable” if two or
more probes exhibited an absolute log2-ratio with the
reference strain > 1. We then searched for enrichment
of GO terms among the sequences classified as variable
for strains 2-4, as well as among the sequences classified
as “conserved” in all of these strains.
One of the problems with this sort of analysis is that
probes located within the untranslated region (UTR) are
usually less conserved than probes located in the coding
sequence (CDS). In our dataset the overall proportion of
probes located within the UTR of a gene was 62%
(42,073/68,270). However, when considering only the
most variable probes (absolute log2-ratio > 1) this percentage increased to 67% (688/1,012), 73% (9,585/
13,141) and 84% (8,764/10,369) in strains 2, 3, and 4
respectively. This phenomenon will be termed UTR bias
hereafter, and could potentially lead to the identification
of functional groups of genes as highly variable or highly
conserved, based on the percentage of probes that have
been designed in the UTRs for this group. Therefore, in

UTR probes for each functional group identified, and perform comparisons using both the entire data set as well as
only the UTR probes as reference where necessary.
A set of 7,497 sequences were conserved in all the
E. siliculosus strains analyzed

In accordance with our estimation of the overall genetic
differences between the examined strains, we found that
in strain 2 97% of all sequences were considered conserved with respect to strain 1 (absolute log2-ratio < 1
for all four probes), while in strains 3 and 4 this was only
the case for 53% and 63% of the sequences, respectively
(Figure 5). These findings are in agreement with the ITS
tree and the corresponding genetic distances reported in
Figure 1. Furthermore, we identified a set of 7,479 (44%)
core sequences, which were considered conserved in all
four examined strains of E. siliculosus. An automatic analysis of these sequences highlighted only one GO (Gene
Ontology) category (FDR < 0.05): “Structural constituent
of ribosomes”. In contrast to this, a similar study conducted between two soybean species [20] identified

Figure 5 Venn diagram indicating the number of conserved
sequences in tested strains of E. siliculosus. A sequence was
considered to be conserved when all four probes corresponding to
this sequence exhibited an absolute log2-ratio with the control < 1.
The first number indicates the total count of ESTs derived
sequences (singletons and contigs) conserved between the strains,
and the percentage of these sequences represented only by probes
in the CDS region is given below. The number in the center of the
graph, for example, indicates that 7,497 sequences are conserved
between strain 1, 2, 3, and 4, while the number in the blue circle
above shows that 16,542 sequences were conserved between strain
1 and strain 2. Please note that strain 1 is the basis of all
comparisons, as only genes that are present in this strain are
represented on the array. Strain 5 was not included in this analysis
due to the bias introduced by the normalization procedure.

numerous GO terms, including some related to photosynthesis and transporters. The differences between these
two studies may, however, be related to the respective
methodological approaches. While Yang et al. [20] examined absolute signals derived from hybridization of
cRNA, we examined the relative change in signal from
gDNA hybridization and thus eliminated any possible
bias introduced by differences in gene expression levels.
An assessment of the effects of the UTR bias on the
results obtained for sequences annotated as structural
constituents of the ribosome in our study revealed that
only 18 (i.e. 11%, vs. 23% in the entire dataset) contained
only CDS probes (i.e. sequences for which all four probes
are located in the CDS), and the overall percentage of
CDS probes in these sequences was 40% (vs. 38% in the
entire dataset). UTR bias was therefore not an issue for
these sequences.
Transposable elements and fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a/c
binding proteins are among the most variable sequences

Strain 2 was compared with the reference strain 1 to
identify sequences that exhibited a high degree of variability between the two strains. We found only 264
sequences that contained at least two probes with an
absolute log2-ratio > 1, and an automatic search for
enriched GO categories in this subset did not yield any
significant results, but we identified 18 TEs (6.8% of the
sequences mentioned above) that were part of the database of known Ectocarpus TEs [7]. In comparison, the
entire dataset contains 284 known transposons (i.e. TEs
represent 1.7% of the entire dataset).
For strains 3 and 4, we identified 3,343 and 2,563
sequences respectively that matched our selection criteria (i.e. at least two probes with an absolute log2-ratio
of the test strain to reference strain > 1). An automated
search for enriched GO terms (FDR < 0.05) in this set
of sequences yielded only one GO-category, i.e. chlorophyll binding, which consists mainly of fucoxanthinchlorophyll a/c binding proteins (FCPs). We then
completed the list of FCPs using a list of sequences identified by manual annotation [7] (Additional file 2). Highly
variable probes were found to be significantly overrepresented also among the complete set of 144 FCP probes on
the array. Although FCPs were represented by a higher
proportion of UTR probes (112/144, 78%) compared to
the entire dataset (62%), the over-representation of highly
variable probes among FCPs was also statistically significant when comparing the FCP probes to only the UTR
probes as background (Figure 6A). This confirms that
UTR bias was not the primary reason for these genes
being among the most variable.
In order to determine if high variability between strains
was a feature common to other multigenic families,
which merely remained undetected due to the lack of

high quality automatic annotations for some of them, we
performed the same analysis for probes corresponding
to 25 manually annotated glutathione-S-transferases
(GSTs; Additional file 2, [30]). Our analysis did not
reveal any significant differences between GSTs and the
rest of the genes (p > 0.1 Figure 6B). This shows that
not all multigenic families are subject to high variability
in different strains of Ectocarpus.
Finally, as automatic GO annotations did not include
annotations for TEs, but since they were highly represented among the sequences found most variable in
strain 2 (see above), they were analyzed separately. The
1,136 probes corresponding to the 284 transposons
represented on the array (see Additional file 2 and

Methods) were significantly overrepresented among
the highly variable probes in all E. siliculosus strains
(Figure 6C), both when the entire dataset or only the
UTR probes were used as a basis for the comparison.
There may be several reasons why certain sequences
are less conserved than others. Certain genes or genomic regions may be at increased risk of targeted deletions via recombination events [31,32]. Others might be
essential for the adaptation to different environments,
and thus subject to different selective pressures as
demonstrated for rapidly evolving proteins in two species of Arabidopsis [33]. Although we can presently only
speculate about the importance of FCPs and transposons for this latter process, both categories of sequences
have been recently discussed in this context for heterokonts and other organisms.
FCPs are part of the light harvesting complex, and are
thought to function primarily in the transmission of
light energy to chlorophyll. Recent transcriptomic studies in Chaetoceros and in Ectocarpus, however, showed
some FCPs to be transcriptionally induced in response
to stress [15,34]. Other FCPs have also been shown to
be differentially expressed in the gametophyte and sporophyte generations of Ectocarpus [35]. In the green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [36] and in the diatom
Cyclotella meneghiniana [37,38], FCP-related proteins
have also been recently implicated in the process of
non-photochemical quenching. The Ectocarpus genome
contains a total of 53 FCPs, a multitude that may be
related to the adaptation to highly variable light conditions in the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones [7,39].
Many of the E. siliculosus FCPs share a high degree of
sequence similarity, and some are located in close proximity on the same supercontig, both observations suggesting recent gene duplications within this family. The
recent expansion of the FCP family in E. siliculosus, as
well as the evidence for high variations between different strains of Ectocarpus presented in this study, would
agree with the hypothesis that FCPs have evolved or are
evolving to serve different functions within the chloroplast, and with their potential role in the adaptation to
different environments [7,39,40].
TEs are a major component of many eukaryotic genomes, and often considered as ‘’junk’’ DNA or genomic
parasites [41]. However, there may be a limited number
of instances where they could confer benefits. For example, certain transposons have recently been suggested to
play a role in the adaptation of Drosophila to temperate
environments [42,43]. A study in diatoms (which are
also members of the heterokont lineage) proposed that
retrotransposons may promote genome rearrangements,
thus possibly conferring phenotypic plasticity to an individual species, and aiding the adaptation to different
environments [44]. Two important ways of controlling

Dittami et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/2

transposons are silencing by methylation and RNAi-like
mechanisms [41]. Our findings that TEs were among
the most variable components of the Ectocarpus genome, and that even very closely related strains (strains 1
and 2) differed with respect to these sequences, are in
agreement with the observation that TEs in Ectocarpus
are both highly expressed and are not methylated [7].
Neither in the case of transposons nor in the case of
FCPs does our study present any proof of a direct relationship to the adaptation to different or extreme environments. It does, however, highlight both groups as
promising subjects for future studies examining this
question.

Conclusion
This study is the first microarray based genomic comparison of different brown algal strains. It enabled the
detection of significant genomic variations between different ecotypes thought to belong to the same species,
supporting the hypothesis of several cryptic species
within E. siliculosus. At the same time, it provided a set
of conserved probes which can be used for future transcriptomic experiments using the microarray available
for the genome-sequenced strain and analyzing three of
the four examined test strains.
In addition, further analysis of the CGH results provided first indications of differences with respect to an
EsV-1 insertion in the genome of one of the examined
strains, highlighting a potentially interesting candidate
for the study of viral diversity as well as differences in
integration sites. Finally, an analysis of the most variable
microarray probes demonstrated that several functional
elements of the Ectocarpus genome were likely to evolve
at different rates. Both TEs and FCPs were identified as
part of the most variable elements in terms of copy
number and/or sequence identity, and could be of
importance in the evolution of different strains of Ectocarpus. Together these results pave the way for further
studies to explore the biology and the adaptation of the
examined ecotypes to their respective environments.
Methods
Algal strains and culture conditions

All strains were clonal isolates and cultivated in 10-liter
plastic flasks in a culture room at 13-14°C using filtered
and autoclaved natural seawater enriched according to
Provasoli [45]. Although none of the examined strains
were axenic, cultures were handled under axenic conditions, and bacterial contamination could not be detected
using light microscopy. Cultures were irradiated by daylight-type fluorescent white light (40 μEm-2 s-1) under a
14/10 light-dark cycle and were permanently aerated
with filtered (0.22 μm) compressed air.

DNA extraction and fragmentation, and ITS1 sequencing

Approximately 1 g (wet weight) of algal material was
harvested by filtration, dried with a paper towel, and
frozen in liquid nitrogen. These samples were used for
DNA extraction using CsCl-gradient purification based
on the protocol described by Apt et al. [46] with modifications as described by Le Bail et al. [47]. The ITS1
sequence of strain 3 was determined as described by
Peters et al. [9], and sequences of the other strains
were available from public databases. Accession numbers are provided in Table 1. For the calculation of the
tree displayed in Figure 1, the BIONJ algorithm [48]
was used with default parameters and bootstrapping
(100 replicates). ITS sequences of strain 1-5 were
aligned using MAFFT [49] and the L-INS-i strategy,
and conserved bases were selected using the Gblocks
server [50], allowing smaller final blocks and less strict
flanking positions.
Hybridization and scanning

The genomes of the five selected strains were analyzed
by hybridizing fluorescently labeled gDNA of the five
strains to an EST-based Roche NimbleGen 4-plex
expression array [ArrayExpress: A-MEXP-1445]. This
array represents 8,165 contigs and 8,874 singletons by
four unique 60-mer probes each. [15]. The array
furthermore contained probes for 231 sequences of
EsV-1 [28]. A closely related virus is present as an
integrated sequence in the genome of the Ectocarpus
genome strain 1 [7]. Note that, in some cases, a gene
may be represented by more than one cDNA contig/
singleton. In total, the array covers about 10,600
(i.e. 65%) of the 16,256 predicted unique genes in the
genome. Strain 1 represented the reference strain. For
each sample, one μg of fragmented DNA was labeled
using the Roche NimbleGen Dual-Color DNA Labeling Kit (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer-supplied CGH Analysis
protocol v5.1. Reference DNA (strain 1) was labeled
with Cy5 and test DNAs (strain 2-5) with Cy3. In
addition, a reference-reference hybridization was carried out using two independent DNA samples from
strain 1, one labeled with Cy3 and the other with Cy5.
One μg of DNA was used for each labeling reaction
which yielded > 4 μg of labeled DNA. Four μg of each
sample were hybridized together with 4 μg of the
reference DNA (strain 1), using the Roche NimbleGen
Hybridization System 4 and following the standard
Roche NimbleGen protocol (CGH Analysis protocol
v5.1). Scanning was performed according to the same
protocol using a Genepix 4200AL scanner and the
Genepix pro 5.0 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Normalization

Scanned images were imported into NimbleScan version
2.4 (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI, USA), and the raw
signal intensity was extracted for each probe according to
the Roche NimbleGen CGH Analysis user guide (available in the protocols section of our Array Express submission; see below). This protocol does not include a
background subtraction step, which might lead to a slight
underestimation of log2-ratios for probes with low signals. A “.pos” file (Additional file 3) for our microarray
was generated by blasting each of the microarray probes
against the entire Ectocarpus genome (EMBL accession
numbers CABU01000001-CABU01013533, FN647682FN649242, FN649726-FN649760, [7]) using the megablast algorithm [51]. Each genomic supercontig was
treated as a chromosome; 2,676 probes (3.9%) could not
be clearly assigned a position on the genome (homologous sequences were not found). These probes may
correspond to low-quality sequences or contaminations
and were assigned randomly to a “virtual” chromosome, which was later used to choose ideal parameters
for the DNA copy number analysis (see below), but
not considered for other analyses. Raw log2-ratios
were normalized using the popLowess-algorithm version 1.0.2 [26] and R http://www.r-project.org version
2.9.1/Bioconductor version 2.3 http://www.bioconductor.org. The popLowess algorithm selects a subset (a
population) of probes with very similar signals and
uses this subset to normalize the entire dataset, thus
making the algorithm less sensitive to copy number
imbalances (or changes in sequence). The following
parameters were used: significance threshold for
accepting change points = 0.05, smoother span = 1/3,
4 iterations, and δ = 0.1.
Statistical and functional analysis

Normalized log2-ratios of strains 1-4 were analyzed at
two levels: at the regional level by examining sets of 30
probes using a sliding window approach, and at the
gene or EST (singletons and contigs) level. For the analysis at the regional level, normalized expression values
were imported into the Partek Genome Suite software
version 6 (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA), which was
used for scanning for copy number alterations using circular binary segmentation (CBS, [52]). This method
detects regions with potential duplications and deletions
in the genome, and assigns them a p-value. Please note
that these p-values, unlike those from the qPCR validation, are merely based on the signal intensities of different probes within one biological replicate. For our
analysis, only segments with at least 30 probes and a
mean log2-ratio greater than 1 or less than -1 were considered, because these settings yielded no false positives
on the “virtual” chromosome, while still allowing to

Page 10 of 12

detect relatively short deletions or duplications with a
minimum length of 7 to 8 genes. We chose to apply a
p-value cutoff of 7.4e-7, which corresponds to a p-value
of 0.05 after a Bonferroni correction for 68,240 tests (i.e.
the maximum number of possible windows of 30
probes). Since the tested windows overlapped, the latter
assumption is very conservative. However, less stringent
methods would not have changed the number or identity of the identified genomic regions as the p-value of
the next most significant segment was three orders of
magnitude above our cutoff.
Data were also analyzed at the EST level (singletons
and contigs represented on the array). We selected all
sequences with at least 2 of the 4 probes showing an
absolute log2-ratio between test strain and reference
strain > 1, for each of the four strains, as well as
sequences conserved in all strains (i.e. all four probes
exhibited absolute log2-ratios with the reference strain
< 1). Using the GO annotations generated in our
previous study [15], enriched GO terms were searched
for using the GOLEM software [53] and allowing a false
discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. The proportion of variable
probes (absolute log2-ratio > 1) in the identified groups
was compared to that in all probes (UTR + CDS) as
well as to that in only the UTR probes by means of a
binomial test. TEs were identified by sequence homology with a database of known E. siliculosus transposons
[7]. Only sequences with >80% sequence similarity over
at least 400 bp were considered.
Validation

Genomic regions that yielded significantly different signals between the reference and test strains were verified
by real time quantitative PCR on genomic DNA of three
biological replicates, as described previously [47]. Three
to four fragments were amplified and quantified per
region using 4 ng of gDNA as template and the primer
pairs listed in Table 2. Standard curves were created to
calculate the reaction efficiency for each primer pair
using a dilution series of 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 and 0 ng of
gDNA. The specificity of the amplification as well as
possible size differences in the amplicon were checked
using a melting curve. Dynein (Esi0298_0008 = LQ0AAB30YA12FM1) and R26S (Esi0072_0068 = CL461Contig1) were selected as reference genes because of their
high degree of conservation in our study (log2-ratio <
0.2 in all E. siliculosus strains).
Data deposition

CGH-data (raw and normalized) for strains 2 to 5 were
deposited in the ArrayExpress database under accession
number ArrayExpress: E-TABM-766. The referencereference hybridization is available under accession
ArrayExpress: E-TABM-967.
