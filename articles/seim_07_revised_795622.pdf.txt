Abstract
Background: Ghrelin is a multifunctional peptide hormone expressed in a range of normal tissues
and pathologies. It has been reported that the human ghrelin gene consists of five exons which span
5 kb of genomic DNA on chromosome 3 and includes a 20 bp non-coding first exon (20 bp exon
0). The availability of bioinformatic tools enabling comparative analysis and the finalisation of the
human genome prompted us to re-examine the genomic structure of the ghrelin locus.
Results: We have demonstrated the presence of an additional novel exon (exon -1) and 5'
extensions to exon 0 and 1 using comparative in silico analysis and have demonstrated their
existence experimentally using RT-PCR and 5' RACE. A revised exon-intron structure
demonstrates that the human ghrelin gene spans 7.2 kb and consists of six rather than five exons.
Several ghrelin gene-derived splice forms were detected in a range of human tissues and cell lines.
We have demonstrated ghrelin gene-derived mRNA transcripts that do not code for ghrelin, but
instead may encode the C-terminal region of full-length preproghrelin (C-ghrelin, which contains
the coding region for obestatin) and a transcript encoding obestatin-only. Splice variants that
differed in their 5' untranslated regions were also found, suggesting a role of these regions in the
post-transcriptional regulation of preproghrelin translation. Finally, several natural antisense
transcripts, termed ghrelinOS (ghrelin opposite strand) transcripts, were demonstrated via
orientation-specific RT-PCR, 5' RACE and in silico analysis of ESTs and cloned amplicons.
Conclusion: The sense and antisense alternative transcripts demonstrated in this study may
function as non-coding regulatory RNA, or code for novel protein isoforms. This is the first
demonstration of putative obestatin and C-ghrelin specific transcripts and these findings suggest
that these ghrelin gene-derived peptides may also be produced independently of preproghrelin.
This study reveals several novel aspects of the ghrelin gene and suggests that the ghrelin locus is
far more complex than previously recognised.

Background
Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid peptide hormone originally
isolated from the stomach (where it is highly expressed)
and it is the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone
secretagogue receptor (GSH-R 1a) [1]. It is well established that ghrelin is a multifunctional peptide with roles
in growth hormone release, appetite regulation and gut
motility [2] and we have demonstrated that it plays a role
in cancer cell proliferation [3-5]. Despite its widespread
and important physiological actions, its precise regulatory
mechanisms remain ambiguous. Compared to other preprohormones, the genomic structure of ghrelin is thought
to be relatively simple, consisting of four coding exons
and a short, 20 bp first exon [6,7], hereafter termed exon
0. The ghrelin gene (GHRL) spans 5 kb on chromosome 3
[6-8] and exons 1 to 4 encode an 117 amino acid preprohormone, preproghrelin. The preproghrelin signal peptide is encoded in exon 1, and the coding sequence of the
28 amino acid ghrelin peptide hormone is encoded by
parts of exons 1 and 2. Exon 3 codes for obestatin, a
recently identified 23 amino acid ghrelin gene-derived
peptide hormone [9]. The physiological relevance of obestatin is somewhat controversial, as it does not circulate in
human serum, although the C terminal peptide of ghrelin,
C-ghrelin does [10]. C-ghrelin, encoded by exons 2, 3 and
4, is a 66 amino acid peptide that contains the 23 amino
acid obestatin peptide within its sequence [10,11]. It is
currently not known if obestatin is cleaved from the large
preproghrelin peptide, or whether distinct human obestatin-only and C-ghrelin-only transcripts exist. We have previously reported an obestatin-deleted transcript [4].
Interestingly, a murine intron 1 retained variant lacking
exon 0, 3 and 4 has recently been reported [12]. The transcript therefore lacks the coding sequence of obestatin,
but contains a putative peptide containing the first five
amino acids of ghrelin and a novel 19 amino acid
sequence.
Re-examination of the ghrelin locus is required for a
number of reasons. First, the ghrelin gene structure has
not been examined since the finalisation of the human
chromosome 3 sequence in 2006 [13] and the release of
orthologous sequencing data. Second, newly developed
bioinformatic tools now enable comparative genomics
analyses. The aim of this study was, therefore, to re-examine the organisation of the human ghrelin gene with the
aid of recently available genomic sequence information
from multiple species, including the continuously
updated draft mouse [14] and chicken [15] genomes.
Using in silico approaches we predicted the existence of a
novel, distal ghrelin exon (exon -1) and this was confirmed experimentally using 5' RACE and RT-PCR. We
have also identified the expression of extended exon 0
species and re-annotated a 5' extended exon 1 not previously recognised in the literature [6]. Multiple alternative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/298

mRNA transcripts were also identified experimentally
from normal tissues and from prostate cell lines and a
chondrosarcoma cell line, indicating that the ghrelin gene
has a complex transcriptional pattern. In addition, we
report a gene on the antisense strand of the ghrelin gene,
ghrelinOS (ghrelin opposite strand), and have demonstrated the expression of endogenous natural antisense
transcripts (NATs) that partially overlap the recognised
sense ghrelin gene exons.

Results and discussion
Conserved regions identified using comparative genomic
analysis of the ghrelin gene are transcribed
Mulan analysis of the human and mouse ghrelin loci
revealed the presence of two conserved regions (> 70%
identity and ≥ 99 bp) (Fig. 1A). Neither of these upstream
regions was conserved in the draft chicken genome
sequence, even when the alignment stringency was altered
(data not shown). The 3' terminal 20 bp of a ~200 bp conserved region is equivalent to a short, non-coding exon 0
sequence (506 bp upstream of exon 1) previously demonstrated in human [6,7] and in murine [16] ghrelin transcripts, suggesting the existence of transcripts with an exon
0 that is considerably larger than the previously reported
20 bp exon 0. A second, distal ~100 bp region approximately 2.6 kb upstream from exon 1 is also conserved.
The conserved regions upstream of exon 1 are ghrelin
exons
To examine whether the conserved regions identified
using Mulan were transcribed, PCRs from human stomach (using cDNA reverse transcribed with oligo(dT)18
primers) were performed with antisense primers in exon 1
of ghrelin and sense primers in the conserved regions.
Agarose gel electrophoresis of these PCRs showed that
both of the conserved regions were transcribed (Fig. 1B)
and their identity was confirmed by sequencing. The putative exon regions appeared to be mutually exclusive in the
human stomach and the putative exon-intron junctions
conform to the GT/AG rule. Therefore, initial analysis
indicated that the conserved regions are true exons and
not artefacts. The two conserved regions have been termed
exon -1 [GenBank:EF549566] and exon 0 [GenBank:EF549567]. In addition to these two regions, a
sequence immediately upstream of exon 1 of the human
ghrelin gene is conserved in comparison to mouse
sequence (Fig. 1A). This conserved sequence matches the
first 50 base pairs of a 188 bp exon 1 sequence previously
reported in mRNAs isolated from human stomach and
thyroid medullary carcinoma TT cells [6]. The previous
study, however, did not annotate this sequence as a 5'
extended exon 1 (and we have termed it exon 1b). We
have, therefore, identified a novel, distal exon and 5'
extensions to two previously reported exons (20 bp exon
0 and exon 1).

ghrelin gene, can be seen in red. B. Schematic diagram showing the location of RT-PCR primers employed to verify
whether the conserved, intergenic regions identified by
Mulan were transcribed from the ghrelin gene. A forward
primer in the conserved region immediately upstream of the
20 bp exon 0 and a reverse primer in exon 1 amplified a 278
bp PCR fragment (upper panel). A PCR using another exon 1
primer and a forward primer in the conserved region 2.6 kb
upstream of exon 1 resulted in a 227 bp PCR fragment
(lower panel). The PCRs confirm that the conserved regions
predicted by Mulan correspond to ghrelin gene-derived
exons. We have termed the conserved regions exon -1 and
extended exon 0.

Exon 0 and -1 are novel first exons
To examine if the two novel, putative exon -1 and
extended exon 0 regions were first exons, that is if transcription start site(s) (TSS) were present, 5' RACE was performed. Exon 0-specific reverse primers and a RACE-ready
panel of anchored cDNA libraries derived from 24 human
tissues (OriGene, Rockville, MD) were used. Sequencing
of the 5' RACE clones from two replicate, independent
experiments identified two exon -1 start sites, as well as
multiple transcription start sites in exon 0 (Fig. 2). The
cDNA sequences of the 5' RACE [GenBank:EF549561,
EF549562, EF549563, EF549564, and EF549565] prod-

ucts are shown in Fig. 2. The longest 5' RACE clone identified (TSS1 in Fig. 2) is expressed in adipose tissue,
leukocytes and the uterus [GenBank:EF549561] and contains a 106 base pair exon -1 and a large 736 bp exon 0
(exon 0b, the complete extended exon 0 shown in Fig. 2).
Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tags average
20–21 nucleotides and are produced by large-scale
sequencing of concatemers derived from the 5' ends of
capped mRNA [17,18]. The CAGE method, therefore,
detects the most 5' site of the mRNA transcripts – the transcription start site. Even singly, CAGE tags are considered
to be reliable markers of transcription start site (TSS) locations [19]. Intriguingly, a human CAGE tag starting site
(CTSS) corresponding exactly to a 106 bp exon -1 transcription start site (Fig. 3A), was found via the CAGE basic
viewer. Furthermore, a 92 bp exon -1 (exon -1b, TSS2 in
Fig. 2) containing transcript was amplified by 5' RACE
from adipose tissue [GenBank:EF549564], leukocytes and
the spleen. Sequence analysis demonstrates that it splices
into a 197 base pair exon 0 (197 bp from the 3' termini of
exon 0). Thus, the 100 bp conserved region, identified
using Mulan and confirmed experimentally, harbours an
exon -1 with two transcription start sites.
Several transcripts initiating in the 5' extended exon 0
were obtained in many of the tissues examined [GenBank:EF549565, EF549562, and EF549563] including
normal human testis, stomach, adipose tissue, leukocytes
and ovary (TSS 3–5, Fig. 2). While it is possible that the
transcription start sites identified in exon 0 via 5' RACE
represent truncated cDNA, the sites are likely to be genuine, as we found multiple CAGE tag starting sites in the
putative, extended exon 0 of mouse ghrelin (Fig. 3B).
While the transcription start site of the short 20 bp human
exon 0 aligns with the murine start site, the TSSs of the
human extended exon 0 and the putative extended
murine exon 0 are quite different (Fig. 3B). This suggests
that these exons have diverged significantly over time,
resulting in considerable variation in their start sites,
termed TSS turnover [19]. TSS turnover, with the translocation of mouse start sites compared to human start sites,
occurs in a number of genes [19].
Recent studies indicate that many genes have broad transcriptional regulation with a wide distribution of proximal start sites, and not all genes are regulated by distinct
start sites controlled by a TATA box [19,20]. While a putative TATA box flanks the originally described 20 bp exon
0, it appears to be a very weak start site [21,22]. The cluster
of transcription start sites (TSSs) in the extended exon 0
sequence upstream of the short 20 bp exon 0 (Fig. 3B)
contains no apparent TATA boxes (data not shown). Our
study indicates that the ghrelin gene is broadly regulated
and has many potential transcription start sites. This may

allow the transcription of numerous tissue-specific and
developmental stage-specific transcripts. Using in silico
analysis coupled with RT-PCR and 5' RACE analysis, we
have demonstrated that the conserved regions upstream
of exon 1 (exon -1 and extended exon 0) are transcribed
and correspond to novel first exons of the human ghrelin
gene.
Multiple transcripts arise from alternative splicing from
exons upstream of exon 1
Expression of exon -1-containing and extended exon 0containing transcripts were examined using RT-PCR with
exon-specific sense primers (for exons -1 and extended
exon 0) and with an antisense primer in the 3' terminal
exon 4 of the ghrelin gene. A list of exons and exon-intron
boundaries of ghrelin locus derived-transcripts identified
in this and previous studies, as well as ESTs, is given in
[Additional file 1].

Using sense primers in exon 0, a 1064 bp product that
spanned exons 0 to 4 and contained a 558 bp exon 0
[GenBank:EF549569] was found in the human stomach
(Fig. 4A). Moreover, primer walking with sense primers
further downstream in exon 0 always resulted in bands
corresponding to exon 0 and 1 (data not shown). Several
PCR products were amplified from the SW1353 chondrosarcoma cell line (and these are depicted in Fig. 4A). The
difference in the sizes of the transcripts results from multiple non-canonical introns in exon 0 (data not shown),
and are most likely due to promiscuous splicing in the
continuous tumour cell line.
We then examined the alternative splicing of transcripts
expressing exon -1 (located 2.6 kb upstream of exon 1) in
human tissues and a range of human continuous cell
lines. RT-PCR using sense primers to exon -1 revealed
multiple transcripts in the normal human stomach [GenBank:EF549568, EF549570, EF549571, EF549572,
EF549573, EF549574, and EF549575] and several other
tissues and cell lines [GenBank:EF549557, EU072081,
EU072083,
EU072084,
EU072085,
EU072082,
EU072086, and EU072087]. The transcripts were classified into three groups based on their sequences. The
amplicons sequenced from the human stomach are
depicted in Fig. 4B, while Fig. 5 summaries all exon -1 to
4 amplicons obtained in this study. The first two groups
have exon structures that obey the GT/AG rule, while transcripts in the third group harbour canonical GT/AG intron
splice sites in the antisense direction only.
In the first group (I), all amplicons include exon 1 to 4
which code for preproghrelin, and vary only in the length
of the sequence upstream of exon 1 (the preproghrelin 5'
UTR). The amplicons obtained from the human stomach
[GenBank:EF549571, EF549572, and EF549573] are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/298

depicted in Fig. 4B. The 855 bp amplicon, demonstrated
in the human stomach, was also observed in all cell lines
examined (DU145, RWPE-1, RWPE-2, LNCaP, PC3 and
SW1353, data not shown), as well as in the heart, brain,
spleen, testis, salivary gland, leukocytes and bone marrow
(see [Additional file 2]). As depicted in Fig. 5, sequencing
of the Rapid-Scan human tissue cDNA panel also revealed
a 1316 bp amplicon with a 736 bp exon 0b in the placenta
[GenBank:EU072083]. Furthermore, splice variants with
an alternative exon 2 splice site (hereafter termed exon
2b), which results in loss of a glutamine residue at position 14 of the mature ghrelin peptide (termed des-Gln14ghrelin or ghrelin-27) [23], were also sequenced and correspond to a 1313 bp [GenBank:EU072084] amplicon
from the kidney and a 852 amplicon from heart tissue
[GenBank:EU072085] (Fig. 5). Interestingly, a 1067 bp
amplicon with a 212 bp exon 0h initiating at the start of
the 736 bp exon 0, followed by the 275 bp exon 0d (separated by a 294 bp novel intron), was found in the kidney
[GenBank:EU072087]. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) g.-1062G > C (nucleotide number -1 corresponds to the first nucleotide upstream of the translation
start site of preproghrelin in exon 1 of the ghrelin gene)
[dbSNP:rs26311] is present in base 209 of the 736 bp
exon 0 (exon 0b), creating a 3' splice-site consensus
sequence (CAG) [24]. This polymorphism has recently
been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the
Korean population and is thought to influence the ghrelin
promoter, ultimately increasing preproghrelin transcription efficiency [25]. Our findings raise the possibility that
this SNP effects mRNA splicing, resulting in allele-specific
transcription of a 736 bp (exon 0b) or a 487 bp exon 0
(the latter resulting from g.-1062C induced splicing of a
212 bp exon 0h into a 275 bp exon 0d).
The large, extended 736 bp exon 0 is extensively spliced
and contains numerous non-conserved uORFs (upstream
open reading frames), while exon -1 contains a single
translation start site in the human sequence only (data
not shown). Approximately 12% of human genes are
alternatively spliced within their 5' untranslated regions
[26]. Upstream open reading frames, as well as mRNA secondary structure and other motifs in 5' UTRs are known to
regulate the translation of downstream major ORFs and
particularly those which translate developmental genes
[27]. We suggest that the alternative transcripts identified
which splice into exon 1 may be a part of such a regulatory
mechanism. The 20 bp exon 0 found in human stomach
and thyroid medullary carcinoma TT cells [6,7] is devoid
of upstream open reading frames and stable secondary
structure (data not shown). As a consequence, this transcript may be more efficiently translated than the group I
transcripts with exon -1 and extended exon 0 which have
more extensive 5' untranslated regions.

with a previously described 3 base pair 5' truncated exon
2 [23], exon 2b (440 bp amplicon in Fig. 5) [GenBank:EU072086]. Given that exon 1 is skipped in all
group II variants, preproghrelin and the N-terminal 'active
core' (Gly-Ser-Ser-(n-octanoyl)-Phe) of the ghrelin hormone [28] cannot be translated from them. Interestingly,

and 4 (exon -1* and 4*, respectively) in addition to two novel exons (exon 2* and 2**) in intron 2 of the ghrelin gene.

the putative peptides would be in-frame with previously
reported ghrelin gene derived peptides (depicted in Fig.
6). The putative peptides encoded by these transcripts
would include the sequence for C-ghrelin (ex -1, 2, 3, 4)

also a novel C-terminal proghrelin peptide (exon 3deleted proghrelin) (ex-1, 4) that is upregulated in prostate [5] and breast [3] cancer. The identification of several

that the signal peptide is translated and functional. For
example, we have demonstrated the expression a C-ghrelin mRNA variant in human heart tissue. C-ghrelin circulates at high levels in patients with heart failure and at low
levels in patients with myocardial infarction, and do not
correspond with ghrelin levels [10]. In rat plasma and rat
tissues, C-ghrelin levels do not appear to correspond
directly with ghrelin levels [11]. Therefore, the regulation
of preproghrelin and C-ghrelin could be independent and
C-ghrelin could be a ghrelin gene derived hormone with

Structure of ghrelin splice variants containing a putative signal
Structure of ghrelin splice variants containing a putative signal peptide. For each splice variant the exon structure, the predicted protein structure and amino acid
sequence is depicted. A putative signal peptide (SP) in exon 1 is indicated by bold letters in the amino acid sequence.
Obestatin coding sequence is depicted in red font, while an
exon 3-deleted proghrelin peptide is shown in blue font. The
splice variant that may encode putative C-ghrelin [GenBank:EF549574] was also expressed in the heart and spleen.
Obestatin mRNA variants were obtained from the human
stomach [GenBank:EF549575], while a variant that may
encode an exon 3-deleted (Δex3) proghrelin peptide [GenBank:EF549557] was found in the PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell line. A mRNA variant obtained from leukocytes
with a 5' truncated exon 2 [GenBank:EU072086] may encode
a C-ghrelin peptide missing a single glutamine residue at position 24 (des-Gln24-C-ghrelin, underlined in the C-ghrelin
amino acid sequence).

distinct functions. Interestingly, a murine testis specific
transcript, the ghrelin-gene derived transcript or GGDT,
that codes for obestatin but not ghrelin, has previously
been demonstrated and harbours a putative nuclear localisation signal [29]. While the functions of obestatin
remain somewhat controversial [9,30-32], it may play a
role in sleep [33], anxiety [34] and in cell proliferation
[35].
Natural antisense transcripts are transcribed from a gene
on the opposite strand of ghrelin (ghrelinOS)
The third (III) group of alternative transcripts containing
exon -1 and 4 that we identified in the human stomach (a
1176 bp amplicon [GenBank:EF549568] and a 921 bp
amplicon [GenBank:EF549570], Fig. 4B) result from
splicing of transcripts with exon -1 sequences of ~880 bp,
termed exon -1*a, and ~625 bp, termed exon -1*b. These
exons extend into intron -1 and are considerably larger
than the 106 bp and 92 bp exon -1 sequences obtained in
this study. Moreover, these splice variants also contain
two novel intron 2-derived exons (exon 2* and 2**) and
an alternative exon 4 (exon 4*) (Fig. 4B). As is the case in
the stomach, the fragments corresponding to these unusual transcripts were observed in all cell lines examined
(DU145, RWPE-1, RWPE-2, LNCaP, PC3 and SW1353,

data not shown). The 1176 bp amplicon expressed in the
stomach is also expressed in the heart and fetal liver (data
not shown). Furthermore, an mRNA variant with a ~880
bp exon -1*a and exon 2*, but lacking exon 2** (the 1108
bp amplicon in Fig. 5) was sequenced from the spleen
[GenBank:EU072081], while a 950 bp amplicon [GenBank:EU072082] harbouring exon -1*a and exon 4* only
was obtained from the kidney (Fig. 5). We then determined the direction of transcription of these transcripts.
GMAP [36] and manual analyses were performed using
sequenced PCR products obtained in this study, as well as
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) spanning at least one
intron. This analysis showed that while there are no
canonical GT/AG splice junctions if the variants are transcribed from the sense (ghrelin gene) DNA strand, the
reverse strand contains GT/AG intron junctions. All exons
demonstrated this pattern with the exception of the intron
flanking exon 2* of these fragments and -1*a/b, where the
splice junction is GC/AG. GC/AG is relatively rare, but the
most common non-canonical splice site pair [37].
To confirm the direction of transcription of the putative
antisense transcripts, we employed strand-specific primers
in reverse transcription (RT) reactions to specifically target
either sense or antisense transcripts. RT-PCR analysis of
human stomach cDNA (performed by combining the
sense and antisense RT-primers) revealed that the target
transcripts are transcribed in the antisense direction (Fig.
7A). Furthermore, Southern hybridisation, employing a
nested DIG-labelled PCR probe, demonstrated a very
strong signal for the antisense-direction amplicon (data
not shown). The expected 201 base pair amplicon (spanning exon 4*, 2** and 2*) was isolated and sequenced to
confirm its identity [GenBank:EF549558]. We have
termed this antisense gene ghrelinOS (ghrelin opposite
strand).
In order to firmly establish the origin of the antisense
ghrelinOS mRNA transcripts, and to determine how far
they extend relative to the ghrelin gene, 5' RLM-RACE
using human stomach cDNA was performed. Sequencing
of RACE products identified two transcription start sites
(TSSs) corresponding to a 63 bp and an 86 bp exon 4*
[GenBank:EF549559, and EF549560]. Furthermore, a
CAGE tag starting site was identified (T03F009D342E) in
the antisense direction corresponding to a 28 base pair
exon 4*. The three TSSs of ghrelinOS transcripts are summarised in Fig. 7B. We did not identify any potential
TATA-boxes, therefore, these findings suggest that exon 4*
contains multiple TSSs, which is typical of TATA-less promoters [20].
Sequence analysis demonstrates that the ghrelinOS gene
undergoes substantial alternative splicing, and we have
identified five natural antisense transcripts (termed

ghrelinOS1–5, Fig. 8A). The transcripts differ in the length
of exon -1* (GhrelinOS1,3–5 vs 2), while in the third transcript (GhrelinOS3) exon 2* is extended and exon 2** is
absent. GhrelinOS4 lacks exon 2** and harbours the
canonical exon 2*. Finally, GhrelinOS5 lacks both exon
2* and 2**. The exon-intron junctions of GhrelinOS transcripts are depicted in Fig. 8B. The analysis revealed no significant sequence similarity to any known gene, protein or
to any long ORFs (data not shown), suggesting that these
transcripts may function as regulatory, non-coding RNA
[38]. Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) that are transcribed from the opposite strands of the same genomic
locus are termed cis-NATs [39].
The ghrelin NATs that we have described span the noncoding 3' UTR region of exon 4 and exon -1 of mature,
sense ghrelin gene-derived transcripts and overlap intron
2 sequence of ghrelin pre-mRNAs (Fig. 8A). Sense exons 1 and 4 are conserved when compared to mouse genomic
sequence, while the degree of sequence similarity to exon
-1* (the region not overlapping the sense exon -1), exon
2* and exon 2** appears to be very low (data not shown).
Interestingly, most previously reported cis-NATs overlap
with the sense transcript in their untranslated regions
[39]. This appears to be the case for ghrelinOS transcript
as exon -1 and 4 corresponds to 5' and 3' UTRs of sense
ghrelin transcripts encoding preproghrelin.
It has been demonstrated that the mammalian genome is
often transcribed from both the sense and antisense DNA
strands [40]. Although the understanding of the mechanisms of action of natural antisense transcripts remains in
its infancy, these transcripts have been shown to be
involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. NATs have been associated with a range of regulatory mechanisms, including transcriptional interference,
RNA masking and dsRNA mediated gene-silencing via
direct interaction between the sense and antisense transcripts [39,41]. Intriguingly, in a very recent study, rats
were administered a short, 22 base pair ghrelin antisense
oligonucleotide into the cerebrospinal fluid [42]. The
antisense oligonucleotide is complementary to sequence
in the rat preproghrelin 3' UTR in exon 4 (exon 4* of putative rat ghrelinOS transcripts). The study found that the
antisense oligonucleotide decreased anxiety in rats (the
opposite effect to ghrelin) and may act as an antidepressant [42]. We suggest that this preliminary evidence may
provide a first glimpse of the function of endogenous
ghrelin natural antisense transcripts.
It has been reported that ghrelin mRNA and protein levels
are dissociated [43-45]. We hypothesise that this may be
due to either the presence of upstream open reading
frames in exons 5' to exon 1 (exon 1 harbours the preproghrelin start codon); expression of ghrelin locus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/298

derived transcripts lacking coding potential for ghrelin; or
non-coding sense and/or antisense regulatory transcripts.
The transcripts identified in this study may be examples of
at least one of these factors. Therefore the physiological
significance of each transcript species, in particular mRNA
variants encoding preproghrelin, cannot be determined
based on mRNA expression data alone.

Conclusion
In the present study, we have shown that two newly identified exon regions of the ghrelin gene have the potential
to generate a broad and complex transcriptional repertoire. Furthermore, a gene on the antisense strand of ghrelin, ghrelinOS, generates antisense transcripts that overlap
conventional, sense ghrelin gene-derived transcripts. It
would now seem imperative to perform a large-scale,
thorough re-examination of the ghrelin locus in order to
identify and characterise novel transcripts and peptides, as
well as their function in various physiological and pathophysiological states, including obesity, depression and
cancer. Such efforts may result in a reconceptualisation of
the regulation and mechanisms of action of the multifunctional ghrelin peptide.

Methods
Bioinformatics
The identification of conserved regions in the ghrelin
locus was facilitated by comparisons of the chromosomal
regions spanning the human [GenBank:NT_022517],
and
chicken
mouse
[GenBank:NC_000072]
(Contig12.626 of WASHUC2 draft release 2.1) ghrelin
loci using Mulan (MUltiple sequence Local AligNment
and conservation visualization tool) [46]. The Evolutionary Conserved Region (ECR) Browser within Mulan was
used to visualise phylogenetically conserved regions of
100 bp with greater than 70% sequence identity between
the ghrelin genes and 20 kb upstream of their preproghrelin translation start sites. The human ghrelin gene
sequence [GenBank:NM_016362] and the 20 bp exon 0
sequence [6,7] was used as the reference sequence for
annotation in Mulan. The CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene
Expression) basic viewer provided by the FANTOM (Functional Annotation of Mouse) consortium [47] was
employed to locate transcription start sites in the putative
first exons of the human and murine ghrelin loci. The
exon-intron-structure of ghrelin locus-derived ESTs and
mRNA entries identified from BLAST searches, as well as
sequenced PCR amplicons obtained in this study, were
analysed against the human genome (NCBI release 35)
using GMAP [36]. The location of putative signal peptides
of deduced amino acid sequences were predicted using
the SignalP 3.0 Server with default parameters [48]. The
HapMap genome browser [49] was employed to locate
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in novel ghrelin
exons.

Genomic organisation of sense and natural antisense transcripts associated with the ghrelin gene. A. The natural
antisense transcripts are shown in black and the corresponding genomic structure of the ghrelin gene in grey. The previously
reported 20 bp exon 0 and extended (188 bp) exon 1 of the ghrelin gene are also shown. Exons are represented as boxes,
introns as horizontal lines and sizes (bp) are indicated above each exon. The direction of transcription of each gene is indicated
by arrowheads. A tilde symbol (~) in front of the size of some exons indicates that as RT-PCR primers spanned these exons,
their exact ends are unknown. The antisense strand ghrelinOS transcripts overlap with the sense exon -1 and 4, but not with
the exon 0–3 of the ghrelin gene. The three TSSs resulting in 86, 63 or 28 base bp exon 4* are shown. Note that it has not
been determined which TSS(s) the various ghrelinOS variants employ. GhrelinOS1 contains an approximately 880 bp exon 1*a, a 158 bp exon 2*a, a short 68 base pair exon 2** and exon 4*. GhrelinOS1 was demonstrated by experimental procedures
(RT-PCR) in this study and is supported by expressed sequence tag (EST) data (EST CF264800). GhrelinOS2 (demonstrated via
RT-PCR in our study) is similar to ghrelinOS1, except in this variant exon -1* is ~625 bp long (exon -1*b). GhrelinOS3 (Incyte

Cell culture
The chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353 (ATCC HTB 94; a
kind gift from Shea Carter, IHBI, Brisbane, Australia) was
cultured in DMEM/F12 media (Invitrogen, Mount Waverley, Australia). Cultured SW1353 cells were grown in T80
or T175 flasks (Nagle Nunc International, Roskilde, Denmark) in 95% CO2 in a Sanyo incubator at 37°C. Prostate
and/or prostate cancer derived cell lines DU145, RWPE-1,
RWPE-2, LNCaP and PC3 cell lines were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
MD) and cultured in RPMI1640 media (Invitrogen) as
described previously [50].
RNA extraction and reverse transcription
RNA was harvested from cultured cells at 70% confluence
using RNeasy kits and on-column DNase treatment (QIAGEN, Doncaster, Australia). cDNA was synthesised in a
final volume of 20 μl from 3 μg total RNA, from human
stomach (FirstChoice, Ambion, Austin, TX) and cell lines,
using Transcriptor reverse transcriptase (Roche, Castle
Hill, Australia), 20 U RNasin Plus RNase Inhibitor
(Promega, Annandale, Australia) and, unless otherwise
indicated, oligo(dT)18 primers (Proligo, Armidale, Australia) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
RT-PCR verification of putative ghrelin exons identified by
comparative genomics
The existence of putative exon -1 and extended exon 0
were verified by RT-PCR employing primers spanning the
putative exons (EX-1-F/R and V0-F/R, Table 1). RT-PCR
was performed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing 1 × PCR buffer, 0.2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 μM primers, 2 μl cDNA and 1
unit of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) on a
PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. All PCR
primers were synthesised by Proligo. PCR products were
purified from agarose gels using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche). All products were subcloned
into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced by the Australian Genome Research Facility (Brisbane, Australia)
using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v3.1 protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA).
5' RACE validation of novel first ghrelin exons
5' RACE was performed with primers specific to extended
exon 0 using a Sure-RACE kit (OriGene, Rockville, MD)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples of
cDNAs from 22 adult human tissues (brain, heart, kidney,
spleen, liver, colon, lung, small intestine, muscle, stomach, testis, placenta, pituitary, thyroid gland, adrenal
gland, pancreas, ovary, uterus, prostate, leukocytes (PBL),
adipose tissue, and mammary gland) and two fetal tissues
(brain and liver) were challenged. First round PCR was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/298

performed with an adapter-specific sense primer and an
exon 0-specific antisense primer (Sure-F and Outer-R,
Table 1). PCR products were diluted and used in a secondary, hemi-nested PCR with a gene-specific antisense
primer (Inner-R, Table 1).
Isolation of alternatively spliced mRNAs
In order to investigate the patterns of alternative splicing
of the putative first exons, RT-PCRs were performed
employing an antisense primer in the 3' terminal exon 4
and sense primers in exon -1 or extended exon 0 (Exon-1Full-F/R and V-long-ex0-F/R in Table 1, respectively). The
integrity of the cDNA was confirmed by RT-PCR for β2
microglobulin using intron-spanning primers (B2MG-F/
R, Table 1). Human stomach and the SW1353 chondrosarcoma cell line were examined to investigate alternative
splicing of extended exon 0 transcripts. RT-PCR of exon 1 was performed using mRNA from the SW1353 chondrosarcoma cell line and from five prostate and prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, RWPE-1, RWPE-2, LNCaP and
PC3). To verify their identity, exon -1 to 4 specific RT-PCR
products amplified from the cell lines were transferred to
a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche) for Southern analysis. The membrane was hybridised at 48°C with
an antisense digoxigenin (DIG) labelled cRNA probe specific to exon -1 synthesised from a 5' RACE PCR product
(cRNA-exon-1-F/R, Table 1) and detected as described by
the manufacturer (Roche). PCR reagents, purification,
cloning and sequencing were performed as described
above.

To further investigate the expression profiles of exon -1 to
4 containing transcripts in various normal adult and fetal
human tissues, RT-PCR was employed using Rapid-Scan
gene expression panels (OriGene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rapid-Scan panels include duplicate 96-well PCR plates containing first-strand cDNA
synthesised from poly(A)+ RNA from 24 human tissues
(brain, heart, kidney, spleen, liver, colon, lung, small
intestine, muscle, stomach, testis, placenta, salivary gland,
thyroid gland, adrenal gland, pancreas, ovary, uterus,
prostate, skin, leukocytes (PBL), bone marrow, fetal brain,
fetal liver) serially diluted over a 4-log range (1000X-1X),
where the lowest concentration (1X) is approximately 1
pg cDNA. The panels are normalised to β-actin allowing
an assessment of the relative abundance of exon -1 to 4
splice variants by limiting the number of PCR cycles. PCR,
cloning and sequencing was performed as above, except
that the samples were subjected to 35 cycles of PCR in a
total reaction volume of 25 μl.
Strand-specific RT-PCR
To verify the orientation of putative antisense transcripts,
total stomach RNA was reverse transcribed using primers
specific for sense or antisense transcripts (CF264800-F/R

in Table 1) and subjected to PCR combining both reverse
transcription primers. To verify the identity of the transcripts, a nested DIG-labelled (Roche) PCR probe (ex2*nested-South-F/R, Table 1) was synthesised from cloned
sequence and employed in Southern hybridisation at
42°C, as described previously [50]. In addition, a PCR
product at the expected size of an amplicon corresponding to a putative antisense EST [GenBank:CF264800] was
eluted from agarose gels, reamplified and subsequently
purified and sequenced as described above.
5' RACE analysis of antisense transcription start sites
To characterise the 5' end of the putative antisense RNAs,
5' RACE was undertaken using FirstChoice RLM-RACEReady human stomach cDNA (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The first round PCR was performed with an adapter-specific sense primer and an exon
4* specific antisense primer (5'adapter-out-F and 5'OSout-R in Table 1, respectively). PCR product (1 μl) was
used in a secondary, nested PCR with a gene specific
primer in exon 4* (5'adapter-in-F and 5'OS-in-R, Table 1).
PCRs were performed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl
using Platinum Taq Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
