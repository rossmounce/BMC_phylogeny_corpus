Abstract
Background: Previously it has been shown that insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of
myosin heavy chain is concomitant with enhanced association of C-terminal SRC kinase during
skeletal muscle differentiation. We sought to identify putative site(s) for this phosphorylation event.
Results: A combined bioinformatics approach of motif prediction and evolutionary and structural
analyses identified tyrosines163 and 1856 of the skeletal muscle heavy chain as the leading candidate
for the sites of insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation.
Conclusion: Our work is suggestive that tyrosine phosphorylation of myosin heavy chain,
whether in skeletal muscle or in platelets, is a significant event that may initiate cytoskeletal
reorganization of muscle cells and platelets. Our studies provide a good starting point for further
functional analysis of MHC phosphor-signalling events within different cells.

Introduction
Myosins, actin-based motor proteins, are expressed as
multiple isoforms in all eukaryotic cells. They are oligomers consisting of one or two heavy chains to which one or
more light chains are non-covalently attached. Myosins
have been classified into 18 families based on the amino
acid sequence differences in the N-terminal head
domains, which contain highly conserved regions including actin- and nucleotide-binding sites [1,2]. The tail of
myosin is the most variable domain and seems to be
responsible for the specific role myosin plays in the cell.
Functional activities of most myosins such as actindependent ATPase activity or ability to move actin filaments in vitro are regulated in several ways, mainly by
phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain, Ca2+-binding, or phosphorylation of the heavy chain [1,3] It has
been previously claimed that the myosin heavy chain

(MHC)undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin-mediated skeletal muscle differentiation, thus linking
signal transduction to highly ordered myosin assembly
[4]. Insulin modulates an association of myosin with Cterminal SRC kinase (Csk), a tyrosine kinase signalling
molecule, and these interactions are fundamental in skeletal muscle differentiation. Although the claims of tyrosine phosphorylation of MHC in vivo remain somewhat
controversial, tyrosine phosphorylation of non-muscle
MHC IIa has also been implicated as an early event in
human platelet activation [5]. To settle this controversy and establish the role, if any, of MHC tyrosine phosphorylation it is important to identify sites at which such phosphorylation events may occur.
We have mapped potential phosphorylation sites on the
skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain utilizing an integrated
bioinformatics approach, supporting web-based motif

predictions with evolutionary and structural data. Of all
the sites analyzed in the bioinformatics approach, the
data suggest Y163 and Y1856 as the leading candidates for
insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation.

Methods
Tyrosine Phosphorylation Predictions
Tyrosine phosphorylation site predictions were made
with two different online resources using the sequences
described below. NetPhos 2.0 produces neural network
predictions based on sequence and structure [6]. Scansite
predicts target motifs for different kinases using a positional selectivity matrix based on peptide library screening
data [7,8] In addition, Scansite predictions were made for
known phosphotyrosine recognition motifs for evidence
of downstream signalling events. All Scansite predictions
were made on the 'Low Stringency' setting to identify as
many putative sites as possible. These sites were then supported or rejected on the basis of further analysis as
described below.
Evolutionary Analysis
Protein sequences for adult skeletal muscle myosin heavy
chains (MYHSA) 1 and 2 were extracted from the SwissProt database [9] MYHSA1 [SwissProt : MYH1_HUMAN,
P12882]; MYHSA2 [SwissProt ID: MYH2_HUMAN,
Q9UKX2] and used as query sequences to extract closely
related homologous proteins. First, BLAST [10] was used
to search SwissProt-TrEMBL [9] and the known, novel and
Genscan-predicted peptides of five EnsEMBL genome
databases (Human, Mouse, Rat, Fugu, Zebrafish) [11]
Redundant sequences were removed and ALIGN [12,13]
was used to make pairwise alignments of each homologue
with MYH1_HUMAN and to calculate the percentage
identity across the entire length of the protein. Vertebrate
homologues with at least 60% global identity were processed using an in-house homologue processing tool,
HAQESAC [14]. Homologues were aligned using CLUSTALW [15] and badly-aligned sequences eliminated from
the dataset. A neighbour-joining tree with 1000 bootstrap
replicates was constructed using CLUSTALW and the
sequences were grouped into subfamilies of orthologous
proteins. The clade corresponding to skeletal muscle
myosin heavy chains in Amniota (mammals, reptiles and
birds) were then used as sequences for tyrosine phosphorylation motif prediction as described above.
Secondary Structure Prediction
Secondary structure predictions were made for
MYH1_HUMAN using the PSIPRED V2.3 website [16].
Because of the length of the protein, it was submitted in
two overlapping chunks: residues 1–814 and 800 +.

3D Structure Analysis
3D structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) [17] and viewed with the RasMol viewer [18].
Three myosin heavy chain structures were identified:
2MYS, Chicken adult skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain;
1BR2, chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin heavy
chain; and 1B7T, Aequipecten irradians (Bay scallop) striated muscle myosin heavy chain. The corresponding
SwissProt sequences [Swiss -Prot :2MYS: MYSS_CHICK,
P13538]; [Swiss-Prot1BR2: MYHB_CHICK, P10587];
[Swiss -Prot1B7T: MYS_AEQIR, P24733] were downloaded and aligned with Human MYH1_HUMAN and
MYH2_HUMAN using CLUSTALW. This alignment was
used with the skeletal muscle myosin heavy chains
(above) to assign putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites
to their corresponding residues in the homologous 3D
structures. Visualisation with RasMol and DSSP solvent
accessibility data [19] was then used to infer whether
potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation were surfaceexposed or buried.

Results
In total, twenty-three myosin heavy chain sequences were
used for tyrosine phosphorylation motif prediction,
which were divided into five groups of orthologous
sequences (Figure 1). Important motifs are likely to be
conserved during evolution and so we considered only
those sites that were predicted to be phosphorylation
motifs in all the sequences of at least one orthologous
group. Because phosphorylation site predictors have a
tendency to over-predict, we increased stringency by
accepting only those motifs that received a NetPhos score
of 0.8 or higher, or were predicted by both NetPhos and
Scansite, in at least one human adult skeletal myosin
heavy chain. This yielded fourteen putative sites (Table 1).
Of these, six were predicted by both methods, including
two motifs that were conserved across all sequences
(MYH1_HUMAN Y163 and Y1856).
To be phosphorylated, tyrosine residues must be accessible on the surface of the protein. Although the threedimensional conformations of homologous myosin molecules will not be identical, the high degree of sequence
conservation between human adult skeletal muscle
myosin heavy chains and the three myosin sequences
present in PDB allowed the inference of solvent accessibility. This was confirmed by the generally good agreement
in surface accessibility measures both between models
and between the different myosin chains of 1BR2 (data
not shown). From these data, two sites (Y286 and Y435)
were buried while a further two (Y313 and Y504) had very
low solvent accessibility (Table 1). 3D data were not available for the four tyrosines in the C-terminal of the protein.

c Skeletal muscle expression data from GeneCards (Rebhan et al. 1997).

If tyrosine phosphorylation of MMHC-II is part of a signalling cascade, it is likely that some other protein will
interact with the phosphotyrosine. We used Scansite to
look for phosphotyrosine interaction motifs and found
three SH2 domain recognition motifs that matched
potentially exposed phosphorylation sites. Because
Scansite also identifies the interacting protein, we interrogated the Gene Cards [20] entry for each kinase and SH2
domain for expression patterns. Only four kinases and
two SH2 domains had evidence from UniGene [21] or
SAGE [22] of expression in skeletal muscle, while only
one kinase (INSR) and one SH2 domain (PIK3R1) had
evidence from both (Table 2). Interestingly, both of the
latter pair were predicted to interact with the same, totally
conserved, motif (MYH1_HUMAN Y163). Furthermore,
both are involved in insulin-mediated pathways (see Discussion). Two kinases expressed in skeletal muscle were

predicted to interact with Y1856. These were an SRC
kinase and ABL1, which interacts with SORBS1 following
insulin stimulation [23].

Discussion
Bioinformatics alone cannot identify a functional motif;
supporting experiments will always be needed for conclusive evidence. Nevertheless, while other sites cannot be
categorically excluded, the combined data presented here
identify Y163 and Y1856 as the most likely sites for tyrosine phosphorylation events in skeletal muscle. Both NetPhos and Scansite predicted these motifs for all
mammalian adult skeletal myosin heavy chain sequences
analysed, indicating strong evolutionary conservation
(Figure 1). A kinase predicted to be responsible for phosphorylation of each site is expressed in skeletal muscle, as
was an SH2 domain protein that was predicted to interact

with a phosphotyrosine at Y163. Analysis of predicted secondary structures and homologous 3D structures indicates that these sites may be accessible on the protein
surface. The position of Y163 as part of an alpha helix
within the globular myosin head domain does raise concerns that it is potentially difficult to phosphorylate, even
though it is on the surface of the domain. Nevertheless,
depending on the relative conformations of the solved in
vitro chicken myosin structures compared to in vivo
human myosin, Y163 might still be available for phosphorylation. Y1856 is in region of low predicted secondary structure (Table 1), indicative of a flexible loop region
more usually associated with phosphorylation sites.
Myosin heavy chain (MHC) undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin-mediated differentiation in skeletal muscles and the degree of phosphorylation increases
in line with differentiation [4]. Interestingly, for the
strongest candidate tyrosine phosphorylation site, Y163,
both the kinase and interacting SH2 domain predicted by
Scansite are involved in insulin-mediated pathways. The
kinase INSR is a transmembrane receptor that binds insulin [24] while the SH2 domain protein PIK3R1 is necessary for the insulin-stimulated increase in glucose uptake
and glycogen synthesis in insulin-sensitive tissues [25].
We can therefore conclude that Y163 remains a strong
candidate site for insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of myosin heavy chain, despite concerns over
accessibility.
As phosphorylation sites are often in the tails of proteins,
the tyrosines outside the main globular domains, namely
Y1379, Y1492 and Y1856, are also potential candidates
for phosphorylation. The strongest of these is Y1856,
which is both C-terminal and predicted to be phosphorylated by the kinases SRC and ABL1, which are found in
skeletal muscle (Table 2). Perhaps of most interest is
ABL1, a protein known to be associated with "Sorbin and
SH3 domain containing 1" (SORBS1) during insulin signalling in other cell lines [23]. SORBS1 is highly expressed
in skeletal muscle (data not shown) and is involved in formation of actin stress fibres and focal adhesions; its orthologue, CAP, has been identified as an important adaptor
during insulin signalling in mice [26-28]. Furthermore,
the SORBS1 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis
of human disorders with insulin resistance [29].

shape [31] Goel et al. showed that insulin can phosphorylate myosin, leading to an association with Csk and thus
to a decrease in c-Src activity. This has also been shown in
fibroblast cell lines following stimulation of the insulinlike growth factor-I receptor [32]. This demonstrates the
potential for skeletal muscle differentiation after phosphorylation of Y163 and/or Y1856 of the MHC.
Harney et al. have shown that non-muscle myosin heavy
chain type IIA in platelets undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation in a timedependent manner [5]. In common with other cells, the
cytoskeleton of platelets comprises actin filaments, microtubules and myosin molecules. Myosins form rings within
the platelet that maintain a spherical shape and several
lines of evidence suggest that these rings reorient following platelet activation to permit spreading [33,34]. While
myosin function therefore appears critical to platelet
spreading, studies using cytoskeleton inhibitors have
shown that at least the early events of platelet activation
are not dependent on the cytoskeletal changes [35]. Our
work is suggestive that tyrosine phosphorylation of
myosin heavy chain, whether in skeletal muscle or in
platelets, is a significant event that may initiate cytoskeletal reorganization of muscle cells and platelets. Our studies provide a good starting point for further functional
analysis of MHC phosphor-signalling events within different cells.
