Abstract
Background: The origin and early evolution of the active site of the ribosome can be elucidated
through an analysis of the ribosomal proteins' taxonomic block structures and their RNA
interactions. Comparison between the two subunits, exploiting the detailed three-dimensional
structures of the bacterial and archaeal ribosomes, is especially informative.
Results: The analysis of the differences between these two sites can be summarized as follows: 1)
There is no self-folding RNA segment that defines the decoding site of the small subunit; 2) there
is one self-folding RNA segment encompassing the entire peptidyl transfer center of the large
subunit; 3) the protein contacts with the decoding site are made by a set of universal alignable
sequence blocks of the ribosomal proteins; 4) the majority of those peptides contacting the peptidyl
transfer center are made by bacterial or archaeal-specific sequence blocks.
Conclusion: These clear distinctions between the two subunit active sites support an earlier
origin for the large subunit's peptidyl transferase center (PTC) with the decoding site of the small
subunit being a later addition to the ribosome. The main implications are that a single self-folding
RNA, in conjunction with a few short stabilizing peptides, formed the precursor of the modern
ribosomal large subunit in association with a membrane.

Background
The ribosome is made up of two major subunits: the large
ribosomal subunit (LSU) and the small ribosomal subunit (SSU). A typical bacterial example is in E. coli. The
small ribosomal subunit is composed of a 16S ribosomal
RNA (1540 nucleotides) and 24 ribosomal proteins. The
large ribosomal subunit of E. coli is composed of a 23S
ribosomal RNA (2913 nucleotides) and 34 ribosomal

proteins. The protein distribution is customarily written
as (24/34) meaning 24 ribosomal proteins in the SSU and
34 ribosomal proteins in the LSU.
The bacterial ribosome has 58 proteins (24/34) as compared to the Archaea, which has 68 proteins (28/40) and
the Eukarya, which has 78 proteins (32/46). There are 34
ribosomal proteins (15/19) identified as homologs in the

three cellular domains [1]. When each of these universal
proteins is aligned across all three cellular domains, it
individually breaks up into four types of blocks: 1) universal blocks that align across the all three cellular domains;
2) blocks that align only among the Bacteria; 3) blocks
that align only among the Archaea and Eukarya; and 4)
domains that align only among the Eukarya [2,3].
One possible conjecture is that the universal sequence
blocks of these ribosomal proteins and their interactions
with the ribosomal RNAs could map out a simpler and
perhaps older ribosome especially at the decoding site of
the SSU and the PTC (peptidyl transferase center) of the
LSU. This conjecture appears to account for the universal
blocks of the ribosomal proteins of the SSU at the decoding site, but this is not the case for the ribosomal proteins
of the LSU at the PTC. The observed differences between
the universal blocks of the ribosomal proteins of the LSU
and SSU at their active sites provide further insight into
their early evolutionary history.
We assume that the different or individual biochemical
processes involved in translation such as the PTC and the
decoding function of the SSU arose sequentially and independently. For example, it has been suggested that an
RNA molecule with a peptidyl transferase activity existed
before the full sequential three-base decoding [4-6].
The structures of most tRNAs have a cloverleaf secondary
structure. There are two important short helical arms, one
containing the anticodon loop and the other the aminoacyl stem with its 3' CCA acceptor of the amino acid. The
two other arms are terminated by the D loop and TΦ CG
loop respectively. The 3D structure of the tRNA can be fitted to an L-shaped structure with the amino acid acceptor
arm at one end of the L and the anticodon loop at the
other. The D loop and the TΦ CG loop fold as the corner
of the L. The separation between these two sites is
reflected in the interaction between the tRNA and the two
ribosomal subunits. The aminoacyl stem fits into the
active site of the LSU while the anticodon stem fits into
the decoding or active site of the SSU [7]. This raises the
evolutionary question of why there are two separate subunits of the ribosome interacting with the widely separated arms of the activated tRNA. The main implications
are that a single self-folding RNA, in conjunction with a
few short stabilizing peptides, formed the precursor of the
modern ribosomal large subunit in association with a
membrane. In addition it would appear that the small
subunit was a later addition.

Results
SSU Decoding site RNA
There is no single self-folding segment in the 16S RNA
that encompasses the majority of the decoding site rRNA.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/16

There are two segments of the 16S RNA of significant
length 1402–1498 and 588–754 that are clearly capable
of self-folding to their native structure in isolation [8]. The
coordinates are from 1GIX.pdb [9,10]. Equivalent coordinates are in 1FJG.pdb [11]. The first of these forms a long
single hairpin RNA helix whose open end points directly
at the decoding site opposite the ribosomal proteins S9
and S13. This RNA helix contains, as noted by Ogle and
Ramakrishnan [12], the two bases, A-1492 and A-1493, at
its open end that play a key role in stabilizing the tRNA
anticodon mRNA helix. This stabilization is done coordinately with the base at G-530, which is nearly a thousand
nucleotides distant (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that this large
self-folding helix is truncated in minimum SSU [13]. The
second RNA segment with reasonable self-folding potential, 588–754, however, is far from the decoding center.
There are at least three other disjoint short segments considered part of the decoding site, 954–957, 1051–1057
and 1193–1199, largely forming one side of the tRNA
pocket. None of these short segments is contained within
longer segments with any self-folding potential. The lack
of any continuous RNA segment of sufficient length to be
capable of self-folding to the native structure of the decoding site is in strong contrast to what is observed in the
LSU.
SSU Universal Proteins
There are 15 universal ribosomal proteins associated with
the SSU. These proteins can be characterized by their 3D
structure, their RNA interaction and their sequence block
structure [3]. These sequence blocks are either universal,
with recognizable homologs within all cellular domains
or unique to particular cellular domains. We restrict our
study to the cellular domains of Archaea and Bacteria, due
to the available 3D structures of their ribosomes and
bound ribosomal proteins [9].

Five of the 15 universal SSU proteins (S2, S3, S4, S14, S15)
are globular; a second group of six (S7, S9, S11, S12, S13,
S19) have a globular portion plus a long unstructured
peptide extension. Extensions here refer to segments of
these proteins that extend away from the more compact or
globular part of the protein for a significant distance.
There are three ribosomal proteins (S5, S8, S10) with hairpin extensions and one (S17) with both helical and hairpin extensions. These SSU universal ribosomal proteins
and their sequence blocks have functions involved with:
the folding of the SSU RNA; stabilization of the folded
ribosomal SSU RNA; constraining or stabilizing the
tRNAs; structural interactions with other ribosomal associated proteins, e.g., initiation, elongation and termination factors, etc. and modulating the binding to the large
subunit of the ribosome [9].

Figure 1
SSU Decoding site RNAs
SSU Decoding site RNAs. Shown are the A- and P-site tRNAs as green and red strand ribbons, the mRNA fragment as
space filled, and two segments of the 16S RNA in backbone (the self-folding long helix 1402–1498 (1GIX.pdb) containing the
conserved A-1492 and A-1493 as black dots and the short segment containing G-530 shown as a black dot. The proteins: S9 is
displayed as yellow, S12 as cyan, and S13 as gray.

Hairpin extensions within the universal blocks of S10 and
S5 reach toward the underside of the decoding site yet do
not directly make contact. These extensions reach deep
into the RNA structure probably providing RNA stabilization. Both S3 and S4 are found largely on the surface at the
end of the mRNA groove, with the hairpin extension of S3
approaching the bottom of the groove but not contacting
that site. The other universal SSU proteins are found
largely on the SSU surface and do not appear to interact
with the decoding function. S19 in the bacterial case has a
short N-terminal extension that reaches toward the two
tRNAs, but does not actually contact either of the tRNAs
while contacting S13, which does directly interact with the
decoding function. However, in the archaeal S13 case
there is an additional noncellular domain-specific N-terminal block [2,3] that may reach farther but this is not
available in the current determined structures.

Some distance away from the decoding site are a number
of other SSU universal proteins that have a complex of cellular domain-specific blocks in both Bacteria and Archaea.
These include S15, S4, S3 and probably S8. All are largely
on the SSU outer surface. The primary 16S RNA contacts
by these are made by the universal blocks. They also make
no significant contact with the LSU. On the other hand,
there is evidence that at least three, S4, S8, S15, along with
S7 are critical in the early 16S protein binding and/or folding pathway [14].
Decoding Site Proteins
The ribosomal proteins in the second group with their
long extensions have the major contacts with the decoding site. Five proteins, S7, S9, S12, S13, and S11 have
active site contacts to the tRNA binding site and/or the
messenger RNA. Three proteins, S9, S12 and S13, contact

Biology Direct 2008, 3:16

the A or P site tRNAs (Fig. 1). The bacterial protein S9 contains only universal blocks, which are blocks or segments
alignable across all Bacteria and Archaea. The contact by
the S9 C-terminal extension (107–128) is primarily with
the P-Site tRNA.
S13 has an irregular elongated globular domain with long
C-terminal extension that makes contact between the two
tRNAs at the A- and P-sites. The archaeal S13 contains significant additions or block segments not found in Bacteria. However these archaeal blocks are not involved in the
S13 contacts to the tRNAs at the A- and P-sites.
The globular body of S12 on the SSU upper surface is
involved with the SSU-LSU interface. A small beta hairpin
(38–54) within a universal block makes contact with the
decoding site and probably the mRNA. There is a very
short N-terminal extension of the bacterial S12 that is
unalignable with the larger N-terminal archaeal-specific
block [2,3]. While the archaeal S12 long extensions probably play a role in the 16S RNA structure, they point away
from the decoding site.
S7 and S11 also contact the mRNA, but at the far end of
the messenger path and are largely on the surface of the
SSU. S7 contacts the mRNA with the hairpin (75–87)
within a universal block. S11 contains a single universal
block except for a seven-amino acid deletion in the middle of the bacterial protein. The S11 mRNA contacts are
made by an irregular loop within this universal block
(45–58). There is an S11 long C-terminal extension that
extends deep into the rRNA folded structure but away
from the decoding site.
Conserved Amino acid-Base contacts
There are a limited number of conserved amino acids contacting conserved bases among the universal proteins of
Bacteria and Archaea. There are a few highly conserved
amino acid positions involving Glycine, Lysine, Arginine
and Aspartic acid that contact 16S conserved base positions. Among the universal proteins S9, S12 and S13 contacting the decoding site, there are very few coordinate
conserved amino acid-conserved base pairs (see Table 1).
Interestingly the majority involve polar side chains, suggesting that most of the 16S associated base conservation
may be incidental in that the base conservation is due to
RNA structure. This is also supported by the large number
of amino acid side chains contacting conserved bases but
that are not highly conserved. In addition much of the
remaining amino acid conservation appears to involve
protein-protein and internal protein structural constraints. This supports the idea that structural contacts are
more highly conserved than sequence for this ancient
molecular machine. One SSU counter example appears to
be S12 with 17 highly conserved amino acid-based con-

As in the SSU, there are a limited number of LSU conserved amino acids contacting conserved bases among the
universal proteins (see Table 2). Most of these conserved
base contacts do not directly contact the PTC. In addition
the majority are again Arginines and Glycines that, however, are themselves not well-conserved. A few highly conserved amino acids (L03 Gly -208 -210 -213) appear to
allow close protein RNA packing within the determined
structures. The RNA conserved bases contacting these proteins are structurally conserved by base pairing, not pro-

This includes contacts suggested by others as being part of the extant
center, with the 23S RNA contacting bases conserved, at least 90%. In
the case of L10e, L44e and L15e the amino acid conservation is only
across Archaea and Eukarya as indicated by the dash. The bacterial
L16, L31 and L33 structures are not at a high enough resolution to
attempt to identify equivalent contacts with such divergent sequences
and structures. The notation otherwise is the same as in Table 1.

tein side chain interactions. What is clear in the cases of
the functional analog protein pairs, L10e/L16, L15e/L31
and L44e/L33, appears true in general. Again it is structure

that is conserved rather than specific atomic interactions
with most bases.
The Large Subunit
A major finding from the crystal structure of the LSU demonstrated that the PTC is a ribozyme [15,16] as there are
no proteins directly involved in the formation of the peptide bond. The 23S RNA segment, nucleotides 2472
through 2650, (LSU RNA coordinates are from 1S72.pdb
[17,18] form the key structure of the active site, which
includes the universally conserved Adenine at position
2486 adjacent to the tRNA-charged amino acid's caboxyl
terminal. We calculated the free energy of this segment of
rRNA in isolation and showed that the free energy was
lowest when its folded secondary structure was in its
native fold. This RNA segment contains two parallel helices forming the base of the A- and P-tRNA aminoacyl stem
binding sites. It includes the so-called A-loop (2584–
2598), which forms one side of the tRNA A-site, and a
short near vertical helix (2618–2645) forming the back of
the PTC. The extant PTC as defined by Bayfield et al. 2001
[19] and Polacek & Mankin 2005 [6] includes additional
bases within the segment 2091–2282 (Fig. 2). This segment forms a potentially stabilizing interaction with the
segment 2623–2652 that includes the active site vertical
helix. Interestingly if either of the open helical ends in Figure 2 were closed by a short loop, the entire structure
would form a continuous rRNA segment of about 230
bases. There is one additional 23S RNA segment whose
predicted minimum free energy secondary structure is
also in its native structure. This is the segment from 2670
to 2830 forming a cruciform-like structure in the extant
LSU. This cruciform structure effectively forms part of the
LSU-SSU contacting surface rather than playing any role
in the peptidyl transfer center, contacting the PTC base
second RNA at the end opposite the site of peptidyl transfer.

The L10e/L16 structural homologous pairs (Archaea and
Bacteria respectively) each mimic a third RNA helix in size
and shape. Their elongated globular structure is parallel
with the two RNA helices forming the base of the PTC
structure. The resulting three parallel "helical" bases of the
PTC forms two grooves between them into which the two
tRNA aminoacyl stem helices can fit [20]. This "five helical
bundle" formed by the PTC plus L10e and the two tRNAs
places the tRNA charged ends within a couple of angstroms of each other. This may suggest that there was an
earlier third RNA helix, as part of an early self-folding PTC
RNA later replaced by the proteins L10e/L16. Curiously
there is a well-defined RNA helix from 2427 to 2462, such
that if one calculated the minimum free energy of the
longer segment 2427 through 2650 there would be a third
PTC base helix available to replace the L10e/L16 helical

ing short alpha helices as well. L3's extension loop reaches
deep into the rRNA structure, as does L4.
With the exception of L10e/L16 the LSU universal proteins have the majority of their globular domains on the
subunit's surface. In particular L5, L11, L18, L24, L29 and
L30 are nearly pure LSU surface proteins [21].
The Proteins at the PTC
In this study we focus on the LSU proteins making significant contacts with the PTC's RNA (2472–2645). With the
exception of L10e/L16 the other PTC-contacting proteins,
L2, L3, L4, L6, L14 and L15e/L31 interact with the PTC
through their extensions.

mimic. However in the extant 23S 3D structures, the RNA
helix is on the side of the LSU away from the PTC (Fig. 3).
The LSU Proteins
There are 19 universal LSU ribosomal proteins with
orthologs in the bacterial and archaeal cellular domains.
Seventeen can be located on the determined 3D LSU
structure [9,21]. Like the universal ribosomal proteins
found on the SSU, these 17 proteins can be classified by
their structures, their positions and interactions on the
subunit and their cellular domain sequence block structures [3].

Their structures vary from those that are basically globular
to those with or without long extensions. There are small
globular proteins, L11, L23p and L29p, and those with
larger globular domains, L6, L7/L12, L10e/L16 and L30.
The L10e/L16 structural homolog pair has its elongated
globular structure approximating the size of an RNA hairpin helix. The proteins having a globular domain with
long N-terminal extensions include L2, L15, L18 and L24.
L2 has both an N- and C-terminal extension.
Proteins L3, L4, L5, L13, L14 and L22 have extensions that
are hairpin loops rather than N- or C terminal extensions.
The L3 and L13's extensions are more complex, contain-

Of particular interest is the sequence block structure [3] of
these contacting extensions. Cellular domain-specific
blocks, unlike universal blocks, are defined as significant
sequence segments that can be aligned as homologous
only among either all Bacteria or all Archaea but not both.
This distinguishes them from the universal blocks alignable across both of these cellular domains [2,3]. Many of
these domain-specific sequence blocks are associated with
deleted positions in the other cellular domain, while others appear to occupy similar sequence positions but have
distinct amino acid composition and often differ in structural details.
The extreme case of such cellular domain specificity is
found in the pairs L10e/L16, L44e/L33, L21e/L27, L15e/
L31, L31e/L17, L37e/L34 and L24e/L19, which while
binding nearly identical RNA substructures in Bacteria
and Archaea have little or no sequence similarities and in
most cases have different protein folds [21]. The pair
L10e/L16, alone among these functional analog pairs,
makes extensive contacts along nearly the entire length of
one of the PTC base helices (2486–2533). In addition the
L10e loop (97–113), which reaches the farthest along the
side of the PTC (see Fig. 3), is the least similar to the bacterial L16 in structural detail. The pair L44e/L33 while not
contacting the extant PTC does make extensive contacts
with the RNA helix (2427 to 2462), which may have been
replaced by the L10e/L16 helical mimic. The L44e/L33
protein functional analog pair also contacts the L15e/L31
functional analog pair, which also contacts that RNA
helix. Does this suggest that all three of these proteins
L10e/L16, L15e/L31 and L44e/L33 were added late or
early as equivalent alternatives among many such [2,3]?
Both the L2 N- and C-termini contain cellular domainspecific blocks, each of which reaches in toward the top of
the PTC making minimal contact. The L2 C-terminal
domain-specific block is connected to the adjacent universal block by a universally conserved three-Glycine run.
This would provide a unique flexible connection for this

evolved (see Discussion section).

C-terminal extension. That in turn might support the idea
that the two sequence blocks were once independent.
L3 contains a large complex loop (213–254) that makes
contact with the PTC's second base helix. These contacts
are in a short cellular domain-specific block. It also contains a unique archaeal N-terminal extension within a
universal block making additional contact with the same
RNA PTC helix.
L4 has a very long hairpin loop (43–100), the end of
which contacts the very back of the PTC close to the universally conserved Adenine at position 2486. The end section of this L4 loop (59–83) is a cellular domain-specific
block [2,3]. This L4 domain-specific block is in a nearly
homologous sequence position in both Bacteria and
Archaea, yet they have very different sequences and different structural details [3]. The two loops make very similar
contacts to the back of PTC. In Archaea they are Ser-GlyArg, while in Bacteria they are Lys-Gly-Thr. Note the
reversal of amino acid properties. Much of this same L4
loop contacts the L15 long N-terminal extension, which
approaches the back of the PTC near the L4 PTC contact.
The L15 N-terminal extension also make extensive contacts with the RNA helix, 2427 to 2462, which was potentially displaced by L10e/L16 as noted above and shown in
Figure 3. The majority of the L15 N-terminal extension is
within a large cellular domain-specific block [2,3].
L6 has two elongated globular domains. The contacts of
L6 to the end of the first PTC base RNA helix are made by
a loop connecting the last helix of one globular domain to
the C-terminal strand of the other globular domain. This
short loop (154–162 in Archaea) is part of an unalignable
C-terminal cellular domain-specific block, unique
sequence segments in both Bacteria and Archaea [2,3].
L14 has a short hairpin extension (35–45) that contacts
the exterior of the PTC at the so-called A-loop RNA. This
loop contains three positive amino acids and is imbedded
in a universal sequence block. Interestingly all bacterial
sequences to date have the actual contacting end of this
loop set off by a pair of short sequence alignment deletions relative to all known Archaea. This has made it problematic to identify clearly these contacting segments as
part of a universal sequence block alignable across both
Bacteria and Archaea [3].
Of the above PTC contacting proteins, L3, L4, L6 and L15
appear to extend out and down from a plane formed by
the PTC two-base RNA helices and the L10e/L16 helix
mimic (Fig. 3). Only two proteins contacting the PTC
rRNA segment are out of this plane: L2 and L14. The L14
contacts are on the exterior of the A-loop, while L2 contacts only the very top of the PTC's back forming helix.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/16

Thus the significance of these two protein's contacts for a
minimal PTC function is unclear. It should be noted that
the globular domains of L3 and L6 also make extensive
contact with the second large 23S RNA self-folding cruciform segment (2670 to 2830). This has implications for
the evolution of the ribosome, see Discussion.
Peptide Exit Tunnel
The peptide exit tunnel, while not directly part of the PTC,
is clearly an important component of the LSU's function
[22] in a manner similar to the SSU mRNA groove noted
above. One protein important to the tunnel is L22, whose
extension (115–143) reaches deep into the LSU. This
extension is within a universal block and approaches the
back of the PTC similar to that of L4, while not making
direct contact as does L4. The L22 extension, along with
much of L4's, forms the major protein components of the
exit tunnel. The extensions of L22, like those of L4 and
L15, point down and out of the plane formed by the PTC
base helices (Fig. 3). The globular domain of L4 and L22,
along with L24 and L29, form a surface at the exit of the
tunnel. The two proteins L24 and L29 make contact with
the Signal Recognition Particle, SRP, complex involved
with the export of new proteins into and/or through cellular membranes [23].

Discussion
An examination of the two active sites of the LSU and the
SSU shows that they differ significantly in both their RNA
and protein structures and their contacts. At the RNA level
the two subunit active sites are fundamentally different.
The LSU PTC is composed of a contiguous self-folding
segment while the SSU decoding site is composed of four
to five disjoint segments, only one of which is part of a
self-folding RNA segment.
At the protein level, the contacting protein extensions of
these two active sites have a different character. In the SSU
case, all of the contacts are within sequence segments of
universal blocks alignable across all three cellular
domains. While in the LSU the majority of the PTC-contacting peptide extensions are within segments of cellular
domain-specific blocks. It seems characteristic of the LSU
that a significant number of proteins are not only unalignable between Archaea and Bacteria but have distinct 3D
structures while making nearly identical rRNA contacts.
This is quite different from what is found in the ribosomal
proteins of the SSU.
The above are simply observations based on our analysis,
and are distinct from a couple of the more speculative
implications discussed below.

SSU Implications
Like DNA and RNA polymerases, the SSU uses a nucleic
acid template and base complementarity to direct synthesis of a polymeric product. One possibility is that the first
SSU was an RNA replicase that polymerized multimeric
oligo nucleotides of three or more at a time. There are a
number of models for how the SSU could have been an
RNA replicase, all of which relate to the attachment of the
anticodon loop to the codon of the messenger RNA. The
triplet anticodon is then polymerized to the growing polynucleotide chain by mechanisms that are not fully specified [24-26]. Another model is based on the evolution of
the tRNA from simpler precursors. This would couple the
evolution of the RNA replicase to the evolution of the
tRNA itself [27]. However, there are no SSU extant selffolding RNAs that could carry out this replicase function.
The lack of a self-folding RNA potential ribozyme component distinguishes the active sites of the SSU from the
LSU. This suggests that the precursor of the extant SSU was
not evolved in the pure RNA world.
The LSU Implications
We conclude from our study of the LSU PTC of the large
ribosomal subunit that the self-folding PTC module,
along with the L10e/L16 protein forms a flat surface (Fig.
3). This is the case even if the potential third PTC base
helix (the red helix in Figure 3) replaces L10e. In fact an
RNA segment including the two separate segments in Figure 2 if joined by one short loop also still forms a flat surface and has a reasonably high probability of self-folding.
It is on the top of this RNA surface that the aminoacylated
tRNA and the peptidyl tRNA can be positioned to carry
out the peptidyl transfer. The structural stability and
attachment to an early membrane of this PTC structure
would be by the contacting peptide extensions pointing
down and away from this surface. As in the case of the
aminoacyl tRNA synthetases [28], micro RNA helices with
an aminoacylated CCA-end could have been the original
substrate of this flat RNA ribozyme and peptide complex.

From such a flat membrane surface, the large ribosomal
subunit would have expanded in two directions: 1) sideways generating the exit tunnel (built from RNA and peptides of the ribosomal proteins (e.g., L4 and L22) to a site
at which peptides exit (e.g., L24 and L29); and 2) eventually upwards to include the RNA segment that forms the
self-folding cruciform, which is closely associated with the
open end of the PTC. The upper half of the large ribosomal subunit is built from the latter structure, which
interacts with the small ribosomal subunit. The simplest
explanation for the evolution of the large ribosomal subunit is that it began on a membrane and gradually evolved
away from this membrane into the third dimension. As
the structure grew, additional peptides and proteins

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/16

would have been added for stabilization and efficiency of
folding a larger RNA.
Early Membrane Implications
There are a number of options for the membrane on
which the ribosome may have evolved: 1) phospho-lipid
bilayer, 2) peptidyl bilayer, or 3) a mixed phospho-lipid
and peptidyl bilayer. The option of a pure phosopholipid
bilayer membrane raises a number of objections revolving
around the problem of the impermeability of such a
membrane to ions and monomers, such as nucleotides,
etc. This leaves us with options 2 and 3.

The simplest hypothesis is a peptidyl bilayer as suggested
by the proposed PTC anchoring peptides. Recently a
number of peptides have been shown to form membranes, in particular – "The self-assembly of surfactantlike peptides containing 4–10 glycines as the component
of the hydrophobic tails and aspartic acid as the
hydrophilic heads is described" [29]. Thus it would
appear that the LSU precursor could have evolved on a
membrane totally or in part of peptides.

Conclusion
The active site of the LSU forms a unique configuration
(Fig. 3), a planar structure formed by the base RNA helices
of the PTC and L10e or the potentially displaced helix
2427 to 2472 with the contacting peptides pointing down
and away. This strongly suggests a potential early form of
the PTC structure as a self-folding small RNA interacting
with an amino acid charged RNA minihelices [30] stabilized on a membrane by a set of short peptides. The LSU's
evolution of such a membrane could be viewed as a
sequence of steps hinted at by its modern structure. At the
decoding site of the SSU the contacting peptides are all
universal cellular domain blocks. This, as discussed
above, is not the case for the PTC of the LSU. The lack of
a contiguous self-folding RNA forming the decoding site
would imply that an early RNA polymerase SSU precursor
would have been a mixture of peptides and RNAs. The
peptides found at the decoding site of the SSU have not
only had their structure conserved but they are alignable
in sequence space across both cellular domains. This is in
contrast to the peptides that interact with the PTC. These
peptides share so little sequence information that they
cannot be aligned while maintaining their structure. This
is usually the case for very ancient proteins (e.g., tubulin
and FtsZ) that retain their function via their structure
rather than their sequence. This contrast between the peptide cellular domain associations of the SSU decoding site
and the LSU PTC suggests that the LSU function in an
early translational system preceded the SSU function.
While the SSU may have begun as an RNA replicase prior
to its ribosomal adaptation, that adaptation appears to
have come later. It may even have come after the synthesis

of larger peptides, the decedents of which are now universal SSU proteins.

Methods
The set of tools employed included: 1) multiple sequence
alignments on a wide range of representatives from Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota, including all those available
from ribosomal subunits of determined 3D structures; 2)
the generation of all contacts between the protein amino
acids and rRNA bases for various inter-atomic distances;
3) association of the amino acid base contacts and the
protein alignment with the cellular domain-specific
sequence block structures from Vishwanath et al. 2004 [3]
and Hartman et al. 2005 [2]; 4) the calculation of minimum free energy predicted secondary structures for all
segments of lengths between 30 and 400 nucleotides for
the 16S and 23S rRNAs [8]. These were then ranked by
energy, degree of helical structure and length.
These data were then examined with the aid of molecular
graphics display tools using the available ribosomal 3D
determined structures [17,31] with a focus on functional
relationships proposed in previous published studies. In
addition to the wealth of sequence and structural data, we
exploited the work of Sanbonmatsu et al. [20] on simulating movement of tRNAs in the ribosome.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Jerzy Jurka, Genetic Information Research Institute
Due to the complexity of the translation system, its origin
and evolution is a notoriously difficult chicken-and-egg
like problem. Most models assume that it started from a
short catalytic RNA able to generate reproducible structure(s) either by self-folding or interaction with other
short molecules such as peptides, or both. Following this
line of thinking, the authors identified an interesting selffolding RNA segment encompassing peptidyl transfer
center (PTC) in the large subunit. They speculate that this
could be the original proto-ribosome. The small subunit
lacks such segments near the PTC and is considered to be
a later addition to the translation system. Based on the
prior literature, the authors speculate that originally the
small subunit might have played the role of RNA
polymerase.

While the self-folding RNA segment is interesting, the discussion of protein interactions with the PTC appears to be
inconclusive. On one hand, the protein contacts with the
PTC appear to be conserved. However, the proteins
appear to be different in Bacteria and Archaea. This leads
to a rhetorical question in the middle of page 9 that
should either be re-stated or removed. [Author's response:
We have removed it.]

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/16

My understanding is that the data in this case do not permit to distinguish between the models of protein convergence in terms of interactions and divergence in terms of
the overall structure.
[Author's response: In studying proteins such as FtsZ (bacterial structural protein) and Tubulin (eukaryotic structural protein) where there is structural but no sequential
homology, it is usually assumed that there was a common
ancestor and these proteins diverged from a common
ancestor. We have assumed this to be true of the ribosomal proteins L10e (archaeal ribosomal protein) and L16
(bacterial ribosomal protein) and for the peptides in contact with the PTC (see paper).]
Other comments
It should be mentioned in the abstract that ribosomal proteins from Eukarya were not studied, otherwise sole reference to Bacteria and Archaea in the abstract is confusing.

[Author's response: See new Abstract. The eukaryotic
ribosome is very similar to the archaea but there is no high
resolution structure of the eukaryotic ribosome. However
the domain structures of the eukaryotic ribosomal proteins have been analyzed by us (see Hartman et al.
Archaea 2, 1–9 (2006)].
Is there any phylogenetic evidence for compensatory
mutations consistent with the suggested RNA self-folding?
[Author's response: The compensatory base change has
been a primary tool used to infer probable RNA secondary
structure. Thus it has been known that helical regions in
ribosomal RNA are identified by compensatory mutations. This is true for the PTC RNA.]
"PTC" needs to be defined when used the first time.
[Author's response: PTC is defined both in the Abstract
and at the first mention of it in the Background.]
Define "sequence blocks" in the text in terms of size range.
[Author's response: We have added a figure at the end of
these comments that gives a size distribution of the
sequence blocks (details in Vishwanath et al. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 33, 615–625, 2004).]
The last column of Table 2 ranks PTC-contacting sites
from 1 to 5, and some sites are hyphenated. Neither "5"
nor hyphens are described. [Author's response: Figure
fixed, thanks.]

not. Based on these findings the authors make some conjectures about possible evolutionary scenario by which
ribosomes evolved.

Reviewer's report 2
W. Ford Doolittle, Dalhousie University
I think this is a good a useful speculation, however with
more detail on ribosome structure than a non-afficionado
like me can safely comment on. So all I can really address
is the logic of the main conclusion, which appears on p.
13, and is succinctly summarized in the abstract. This
seems a pretty reasonable scenario, though one might
object that one could easily infer this without all that
structural analysis: a code and a decoding site would be
useless until peptides could be synthesized, after all. So
what would make this paper uniquely valuable would be
the novelty and strength of the arguments you mount in
support of this scenario.

The idea to infer evolutionary scenario from sequence and
structural alignments is of course not novel but its comprehensive applications to ribosomes is new, to the best of
my knowledge. Using ribosomes as an evolutionary case
study is an excellent idea because they are presumably the
most ancient molecular machines and elucidating their
evolution is relevant to the key biological question of how
matrix synthesis evolved.

The weakest of these, I think, is that the greater sequence
conservation of proteins involved in SSU function argues
for their relative recency. Instead it might simply reflect
their more intimate involvement with rRNA in maintaining the structure and function of the site.
[Author's response: It should be noted that the interaction
between the SSU ribosomal proteins at the decoding site
of the SSU is primarily with the phosphates in the backbone of the RNA and not with the sequences of bases in
the ribosomal RNA. Thus the greater sequence conservation of the SSU ribosomal proteins is not due to the interaction with the RNA at the sequential level of
nucleotides.]
And certainly one can turn such a relative conservation
argument on its head: it used to be argued (by Woese and
others) that those features of the translation apparatus
that differ between domains do so because they arose after
domain separation, which occurred while the ribosome
was as yet primitive and rapidly evolving. So the structurally most conserved elements would be the oldest, functionally.
[Author's response: We agree with this concluding comment.]
Reviewer's report 3
Eugene Shakhnovich, Harvard University
In this paper the authors carry out a careful and comprehensive analysis of structural and sequence alignment features of ribosomal proteins and RNA. Their principal
findings are: 1) That large subunits PTC is formed by selffolding fragment of DNA and is located in locally flat area
and 2) That proteins of the smaller subunit align between
ribosomes from all kingdoms while proteins from LSU do

There are some weaknesses in the argumentation. In particular the authors base their claim that LSU evolved first
on the contiguity of its RNA in the PTC. However in the
SSU the proteins from all three kingdoms align well while
in the LSU they are not. Usually such consistent alignments is viewed as evidence that proteins belonged to
LUCA – which existed before divergence form the universal common ancestor. The authors should discuss this
issue.
[Author's response: The argument in this paper is based
on the ribosomal proteins and their peptides at the decoding site of the SSU and contrasting them with the ribosomal proteins at the PTC site of the LSU. In fact there are
a number of SSU proteins that have significant unalignable regions, for example S2, S4, and S8 (see Vishwanath et
al. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 33, 615–625, 2004).]
It is not clear what is the basis of the conclusion that LSU
RNA is self-folding. Is there experimental evidence, simulation or speculation? The authors should provide clear
evidence in support if this central point of this study.
[Author's response: By using two different RNA secondary
structure prediction computational packages, we showed
that when only the PTC segment was treated as an isolated
fragment its predicted structure was identical (but for one
base pair) to its native whole ribosome structure. The calculated thermodynamic free energies were highly favorable for the folded structure.]
The idea that prototypical LSU was membrane bound is
interesting but appears too speculative. It should be supplemented by structural and/or energetic analysis which
can elucidate which membranes could LSU bind, if this
hypothesis is correct
[Author's response: The membrane hypothesis is based on
the interaction of the peptides at the active site of the
ribosome with the PTC RNA in that they all point down
and away from the flat surface formed by the self-folding
PTC RNA. It should be pointed out that it is the LSU of the

ribosome that interacts with a set of proteins imbedded in
the membrane – a remembrance of things past.]
Overall the paper will benefit from significant revision to
make it more focused on conclusions which are strongly
supported by the bioinformatics analysis and which ones
are more speculative.
[Author's response: We have made some modifications
along these lines at the start of the Conclusion section of
the paper.]
Reviewer's report 4
George E. Fox, University of Houston
The manuscript entitled "The Origin and Evolution of the
Ribosome" by Temple Smith and others addresses one of
the single most significant questions relating to the final
origin and early evolution of life. The authors build on
their studies of the ribosomal proteins in which they
showed that there are blocks of sequence that are universally conserved and conserved in specific Domains of life,
e.g. Bacteria or Archaea. They now examine where these
various blocks of conservation are in the context of key
regions within the three dimensional structure of the
ribosome. They combine this information with calculations of the predicted minimum free energy of large numbers of rRNA subsegments.

Using this combined approach, the authors obtain several
important results. The most noteworthy being that the
proposal of a minimal peptidyl transferase center that
would be expected to fold correctly in the absence of other
components of the modern ribosome according to thermodynamic calculations. That is of course a testable
hypothesis. A second key proposal is that the PTC may
have evolved in conjunction with a membrane. If correct
this is an important contribution as well, as it ties together
two key activities in the early history of life. The paper provides a very useful summary of protein/RNA interactions
at key locations in the ribosome, e.g. PTC, exit tunnel etc.
The authors argue that structure is more conserved than
sequence and since structure is conserved in many interactions with the 23S rRNA without sequence conservation
that is the last to go The conclusion that the core of the
50S subunit is likely older than the 30S subunit is one we
have separately reached in earlier work and it is nice to see
it supported here.

which reads "segment from 2427–2462 (1S72.pdb) from
2472–2650 ..." makes no sentence. More to the point, it
would be very helpful if one could readily relate the position numbers actually used in the text to one or more partial secondary diagrams such as Figure 2. Readability
would be greatly improved if one uniform numbering system (preferably E. coli) were used – e.g. where is the 2427
mentioned in Figure 3 caption in Figure 2? Also, instead
of continually citing structure 1S72.pdb, it would be useful to explicitly say at least once which organism it is from.
[Author's response: The Figure 2 caption has been fixed –
thanks to the reviewer for noting that error. While the dual
numbering does complicate the paper, the fact that the
two (bacterial and archaeal) ribosome RNA structures are
not alignable without numerous gaps and that there has
been no agreed-upon labeling beyond that of the various
RNA helices, we thought it wise to provide such independent number schemes.]
A second consideration is the apparent absence of availability of supporting materials. Table 1 summarizes a
number of protein/RNA interactions. However, based on
the comments in the Methods section the authors apparently have generated all such contacts for all ribosomal
proteins at various inter-atomic distances. It would seem
appropriate that this information and perhaps the thermodynamic calculations as well, be made available as
supplementary material so others need not regenerate
them.
[Author's response: Our co-authors, Robin Gutell and
Jung Lee, are preparing a more expansive protein-RNA
inter-atomic distance analysis for publication.]
The argument is made in the Discussion that the PTC is
older than the decoding site because conserved sequence
blocks in the relevant proteins are no longer universal
despite the fact their structure is conserved. That is to saystructure lasts longer over evolutionary time than primary
sequence. This is a solid argument that suggests that it
might be useful in future work to prepare universal, Bacterial, and Archaeal "structure blocks" instead of the
sequence blocks the authors have used to date.

Overall, I strongly support publication of this manuscript
in Biology Direct.

[Author's response: A detailed correspondence between
all of the identified sequence blocks with the protein
three-dimensional structures is not yet complete. In the
cases of those contacting the two active sites, this has been
done as noted in the paper.]

The authors may however wish to consider a variety of
revisions. Most notable in this regard is the caption to Figure 3 which is very hard to relate to Figure 2. There is
apparently a grammatical error in the second sentence

Finally – a minor point; Maguire et al. Mol Cell 11: 427–
435 (2005) have shown that the N-terminal sequence of
ribosomal protein L27 (analog is L21e in the Archaea) is
very close to the active site and therefore some may argue

that in Bacteria at least, that the machinery is not exclusively an RNA machine. This paper should be addressed in
the subsection of the Results entitled The Large Subunit.
[Author's response: Given that this argument is only based
on Bacterial L27 (N-terminal sequence) and does not
appear to be the case in Archaeal L21e, we prefer to wait
for further data to make the argument. The case for a peptide-RNA machine involved in the decoding site of the
SSU can more easily be argued as there is no self-folding
RNA that defines the site.]
