A non-tree-based comprehensive study of
metazoan Hox and ParaHox genes prompts new
insights into their origin and evolution

Abstract
Background: Hox and the closely-related ParaHox genes, which emerged prior to the divergence between
cnidarians and bilaterians, are the most well-known members of the ancient genetic toolkit that controls
embryonic development across all metazoans. Fundamental questions relative to their origin and evolutionary
relationships remain however unresolved. We investigate here the evolution of metazoan Hox and ParaHox genes
using the HoxPred program that allows the identification of Hox genes without the need of phylogenetic tree
reconstructions.
Results: We show that HoxPred provides an efficient and accurate classification of Hox and ParaHox genes in their
respective homology groups, including Hox paralogous groups (PGs). We analyzed more than 10,000 sequences
from 310 metazoan species, from 6 genome projects and the complete UniProtKB database. The HoxPred program
and all results arranged in the Datab’Hox database are freely available at http://cege.vub.ac.be/hoxpred/. Results for
the genome-scale studies are coherent with previous studies, and also brings knowledge on the Hox repertoire
and clusters for newly-sequenced species. The unprecedented scale of this study and the use of a non-tree-based
approach allows unresolved key questions about Hox and ParaHox genes evolution to be addressed.
Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that the presence of a single type of Posterior Hox genes (PG9-like) is ancestral
to bilaterians, and that new Posterior PGs would have arisen in deuterostomes through independent gene
duplications. Four types of Central genes would also be ancestral to bilaterians, with two of them, PG6- and PG7like that gave rise, in protostomes, to the UbdA- and ftz/Antp/Lox5-type genes, respectively. A fifth type of Central
genes (PG8) would have emerged in the vertebrate lineage. Our results also suggest the presence of Anterior (PG1
and PG3), Central and Posterior Hox genes in the cnidarians, supporting an ancestral four-gene Hox cluster. In
addition, our data support the relationship of the bilaterian ParaHox genes Gsx and Xlox with PG3, and Cdx with
the Central genes. Our study therefore indicates three possible models for the origin of Hox and ParaHox in early
metazoans, a two-gene (Anterior/PG3 - Central/Posterior), a three-gene (Anterior/PG1, Anterior/PG3 and Central/
Posterior), or a four-gene (Anterior/PG1 - Anterior/PG3 - Central - Posterior) ProtoHox cluster.

Background
Hox genes encode a large family of closely-related transcription factors from the homeobox class that is characterised by a 60 amino acids region called the
homeodomain [1,2]. These genes play crucial roles in
the development of metazoans, principally by controlling
the patterning along the anteroposterior axis in a wide

variety of animals (e.g. [3,4]). Their role in the tetrapod
limb differentiation is also well-known (reviewed in [5]).
Hox genes are usually organized in clusters whose genomic organization reflects domains of expression along
the anteroposterior axis (spatial colinearity) [6], as well
as, in some species, timing of expression during development (temporal colinearity) [7,8]. Members of this
gene family have been reported in both bilaterians (animals presenting a bilateral symmetry) and cnidarians
(group including sea anemones, corals, jellyfish), which

suggests that Hox genes emerged prior to the divergence between bilaterians and cnidarians [9-12].
The ParaHox genes, Gsx (genomic screened homeobox),
Xlox (Xenopus laevis homeobox 8) and Cdx (Caudal-type
homeobox), are closely related to the Hox genes, and are
also involved in developmental processes. Like the Hox
genes, they encompass a homeodomain region and form
a cluster, at least in chordates (the individual genes are
present in non chordate species but are usually scattered
in the genome) [13-16]. It is widely believed that the
presence of a cluster of three ParaHox genes, although
observed so far only in chordates, is ancestral to bilaterians [11,13-15,17-19].
Hox and ParaHox genes have been classified in
homology groups, which serve as basis to study their
evolutionary relationships [14,20,21] and infer their origin in early metazoans [9-12]. In vertebrates, Hox genes
are classified in 14 Paralogous Groups (PGs) [22] that
can themselves be grouped in broader classes, known as
Anterior (PG1-3), Central (PG4-8) and Posterior (PG914) (e.g. [23]). In some studies, the PG3 proteins have
been proposed to form a 4th independent class (e.g.
[14]), although their homeodomain shows a high similarity with that of PG2 proteins [18,24] (Additional file
1, Figure S1). Hox genes from non-vertebrate bilaterian
species have been assigned to the aforementioned
classes, suggesting that these classes represent ancient
types of Hox genes. The ParaHox genes form three
groups, named Gsx, Xlox and Cdx [13], yet, they are
more closely related to some Hox PGs than to each
other. Gsx genes have been reported to be closer to Hox
Anterior group genes, Xlox to PG3 genes, and Cdx to
Hox Posterior genes [13,25-27]. This has lead to the
model that the Hox and ParaHox clusters arose through
the duplication of a hypothetical ProtoHox cluster
(reviewed in [18]).
Most studies aiming at understanding Hox and ParaHox gene evolution used phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on multiple alignments of their
homeodomain. Such trees often lack resolution [28],
thereby preventing a clear assignment of sequences in
homology groups (e.g. [12,29]). Nodes of the trees frequently have low statistical support values that can be
explained by the short length of the homeodomain (60
amino acids) and its strong conservation [23,30]. Different tree reconstruction methods may furthermore produce conflicting results, giving rise to controversial
conclusions [12,27,31,32]. Complementary methods,
such as sequence similarity, position of the genes in the
cluster and Hox/ParaHox signatures [33,34], thus may
provide crucial information about the evolution of these
genes.
HoxPred [35,36] is a Hox-dedicated program designed
to classify Hox protein sequences, without phylogenetic

reconstructions. Figure 1 illustrates the general
approach; see [35] for a full description of the method.
The underlying principle is an extension of the Hox signatures. However, instead of attempting to explicitly discover the few key positions that would define a given
homology group, the homeodomain is considered in its
entirety as a motif, and described as a generalised profile
(Figure 1A). Optimal combinations of such profiles
allow the classification of sequences, through a supervised classification approach (Figure 1B) in which discriminant functions are trained to assign sequences to
predefined homology groups (Figure 1C). This technique
thus differs from pattern search techniques (as used in
[37] for homeobox sequences) where a sequence either
matches or not a given pattern that describes qualitatively a motif. The profiles used here are quantitative
motif descriptors that are more flexible [38], and that
take into account amino acid substitutability for all positions of the motif in a residue-specific way i.e. substitution G to A is less penalized than G to W. The
discriminant functions of HoxPred moreover allows to
use the information of multiple profiles, which increases
the accuracy of the predictions [35]. These discriminant
functions finally return posterior probabilities for all
possible homology groups, thereby providing confidence
estimates for the predictions [35] (Figure 1B). HoxPred
was originally designed for vertebrate sequences classification, and has already proven successful in clarifying
the evolutionary history of the HoxC1a genes in teleost
fish [39].
Although the origin and evolution of the Hox and
ParaHox genes have been addressed by a huge number
of studies over this last decade, several fundamental and
unsolved questions remain [10,14,21,29,40,41]. How did
this family emerge in early metazoans? What are the
evolutionary relationships between Hox and ParaHox
genes? How do cnidarian genes relate to the different
classes of bilaterian Hox and ParaHox genes? How did
Central and Posterior genes evolve among bilaterians?
We wondered whether a non-tree-based approach
could shed light on these crucial questions. In this
study, we re-analyzed all published sequence datasets
and several newly-sequenced genomes using new versions of the HoxPred program. The extensive evaluation
of HoxPred predictions confirmed its accuracy on bilaterian sequences. Its computational efficiency allowed us
to simultaneously investigate 310 metazoan species
accounting for more than 10,000 homeodomain genes,
and infer evolutionary scenarios for the emergence of
homologous groups. We found that among the Central
Hox genes, PG4, PG5, PG6 and PG7 were likely present
in the last common ancestor of bilaterians (Urbilateria).
PG8 emerged in vertebrates. For the Posterior Hox
genes, PG9 would have been present in Urbilateria; new

Figure 1 HoxPred classification approach. A. Generalised profile construction. A multiple alignment is built from a set of non-redundant
homeodomain sequences that belong to a given homology group (PG9 for this illustration). This alignment then serves as input to a program
from the pftools suite [62], which generates the corresponding generalised profile. This profile is a scoring matrix that allows to assign a score to
a sequence, based on its similarity with the profile. Contrary to more simple pattern search technique, a profile can provide scores for residues
that were not originally found at a given position of the motif. These scores are residue-specific, and extrapolated by using a substitution matrix
when building the profile. B. HoxPred classification principle. The sequence to classify is scored by an optimal combination of profiles. The
resulting vector of scores then serves as input to a discriminant function that has been previously trained to classify such a vector of scores into
a specific class (eg PG4). C. Linear discriminant classifier training. The training phase aims at generating the discriminant function. The training
dataset comprise sequences for which the class is known. They can be HOX, RANDOM or HOMEO sequences (see Materials and methods). All
sequences are scored by the profiles, so that each sequence is represented by a vector of scores. The classifier is then trained to classify such
vector of scores into their associated class (specified on the right). CTL is the control class (see Materials and methods).

paralogous groups then emerged in deuterostomes
(group including echinoderms and chordates). PG14
appears in vertebrates, suggesting that the amphioxus
Hox14 gene is not related to this PG14. Altogether, our
results favor the independent duplication model over
the ‘Deuterostome Posterior Flexibility’ model alone, for
the evolution of the Posterior Hox genes. Regarding cnidarians, our results clearly indicate the presence of

Central Hox genes, an observation which contradicts
commonly-accepted views [12,27]. Our analysis of ParaHox genes indicates that Gsx is related to PG3 rather
than to PG1, across all metazoans. The ParaHox Cdx
gene would be closer to Central than to Posterior genes.
The Xlox genes from bilaterians appear mostly related
to PG3, while the few known cnidarian Xlox are closer
to the Central group. The evolutionary scenario of Xlox

Thomas-Chollier et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/73

thus remains unclear. Nevertheless, these results, coherent with our Hox analysis, suggest three possible models
for the early evolution of Hox and ParaHox genes from
an ancestral ProtoHox cluster.

Results and Discussion
HoxPred, an accurate tool to classify bilaterian Hox and
ParaHox genes

We developed three new versions of HoxPred [36] to
study the Hox and ParaHox genes at the scale of the
metazoans (Table 1; see Materials and Methods for a
description of these three versions). The “Bilateria” version aims at classifying Hox and ParaHox genes. The
“Bilateria_relaxed” and “Vertebrate_relaxed” versions
have been designed to study the evolutionary relationships between Hox and ParaHox genes. These versions
were constructed and evaluated as in [35]. The prior
probability for the control (CTL) group is very high in
order to avoid misclassifications. HoxPred consequently
shows tendency to classify divergent sequences into the
CTL group, rather than any other group [35]. To assess
the quality of the predictions, we applied the three new
versions of HoxPred on a large set of 800 homeodomain
sequences from 9 non-vertebrate species spanning various bilaterian phylogenetic groups, and which include
well-characterized Hox and ParaHox genes (Additional
file 2, Tables S1, S2, S3). Overall, the accuracy of all versions is high (Table 1). As expected, the “Bilateria” version provides an efficient and very stringent
classification of Hox and ParaHox sequences (accuracy
of 0.97): most Hox and ParaHox genes are correctly
assigned to their class or group while non-Hox
sequences are consistently classified in the control
group. The two “relaxed” versions also provide correct
predictions for Hox genes, with accuracy values higher
than 0.90.
To further investigate the evolution of Hox genes and
the usefulness of HoxPred for its study, we applied the
three new versions of HoxPred on a comprehensive
dataset of 10,538 homeodomain sequences, from the
UniprotKB database and 6 completely sequenced bilaterian genomes. To our knowledge, this is the first study

Page 4 of 11

on Hox sequences conducted on such a large scale. All
results are freely available from the Datab’Hox database
[36], through a friendly Web interface enabling complex
queries and providing links to external databases. The
HoxPred program is accessible on the same website
[36]. Multiple alignments of Hox and ParaHox
sequences ordered by PGs, are also available from this
website and in the Additional file 3. Figure 2 and Additional file 2, Table S4 summarize the results obtained
for the 6 species whose genome is completely
sequenced: 3 lophotrochozoans (group including annelid
worms and mollusks) (Capitella sp. I, Helobdella
robusta and Lottia gigantea), 1 ecdysozoan (Daphnia
pulex), and 2 deuterostomes (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Branchiostoma floridae). Results for Capitella
sp. I and Branchiostoma floridae are coherent with published studies [42,43]. Of particular interest, we identified 11 Hox genes in the Lottia genome and found that
these genes are clustered on a single scaffold and display
the same orientation except for one of them, the last
Posterior gene similar to Capitella Post1. Similarly, the
10 Daphnia genes are found on a single scaffold. A
complex situation is found in Helobdella where 19 Hox
genes are found on several different scaffolds. We also
identified ParaHox genes (Figure 2 and Additional file 2,
Table S4). While a single ParaHox gene (Cdx) is found
in Daphnia, the 3 types of ParaHox genes are found in
lophotrochozoans and deuterostomes (in agreement
with previous studies [16,19,42]) and they are mostly
organised into two- or three-genes clusters.
HoxPred therefore appears to be a suitable tool to
identify Hox and ParaHox genes and we therefore used
these identifications to address unsolved questions
about the evolution of these genes.
A global model for the evolution of Posterior Hox genes

Posterior Hox genes of non-vertebrate bilaterians,
including deuterostomes such as cephalochordates, urochordates, and ambulacraria (echinoderms and hemichordates), can not be confidently related to specific
vertebrate PG using phylogenetic analyses [21,29,43,44]
(Additional file 1, Figure S2). It has been therefore

Figure 2 Genomic organization of the Hox genes identified with HoxPred in the genome-scale analyses. Hox and ParaHox genes are
depicted with arrows indicating transcription orientation, over black lines representing the scaffolds. This representation takes into account the
relative distance between the genes. The transcription orientation is the same as provided by the JGI genome browser. The color of the arrows
relates to HoxPred classification (see color code on the left); white squares are non-Hox genes. The Hox cluster of Strongylocentrotus is from [46]
and the ParaHox genes are from SpBase [63]. The Hox cluster of Branchiostoma is from [43], with the additional Branchiostoma Hox15 gene
found in the genome assembly. Hellobdella genes are not indicated as they span many scaffolds, probably due to poor genome assembly. When
available, gene names are specified: in black (from published studies [16,42,43,46]) or in blue (from the JGI genome browser or SpBase). An
additional putative Hox gene, showing sequence similarities with Sp-Hox11/13c, lies outside the Hox cluster in Strongylocentrotus. See Additional
file 2, Table S4 for the genomic coordinates.

proposed that the blurred relationships between Hox
Posterior genes would be explained by an accelerated
evolution rate of these genes, a process called ‘Deuterostome Posterior Flexibility’ [29]. An alternative hypothesis
suggests multiple independent duplications to shape the
posterior portion of the Hox clusters [29,45,46]. We
used HoxPred to analyse the bilaterian Posterior Hox
genes (Figures 2, 3A and Additional file 2, Table S4).
HoxPred assigned all amphioxus Posterior genes to
PG9 and PG10, to the exception of Hox15, predicted as
PG13 (Figure 3A). The latter has not been classified into
any particular homology group with phylogenetic
approaches, but it was clustered with PG13 with low
statistical values [47]. Our own phylogenetic analyses
show that the amphioxus Hox15 clustered with PG13
sequences, with a high posterior probability of 0.97 for
the Bayesian tree (Additional file 1, Figure S2). Our data
therefore suggest that the amphioxus Hox11-14 genes
would have arisen from duplications of Hox9- and
Hox10-like genes, independent to those which produced
the vertebrate PG11 to PG14 Posterior Hox genes.
HoxPred prediction for the Hox14 gene thus brings
additional support for an independent origin of the
amphioxus and vertebrate Hox14 genes [47-50]. The
assignment of Hox15 to PG13 suggests that a PG13
gene was present in the chordate ancestor. The intriguing interspersed order of the PG9 and PG10 genes

(Figure 2) might be compatible with duplication of a
Hox9-Hox10 genes segment. Comparison of surrounding
non-coding sequence may give further insights into the
duplication events.
In the case of the urochordate Oikopleura dioica,
Hox9 and Hox10 were classified into the PG9 and PG10,
respectively, while both Hox11 and Hox12 were assigned
to PG12 (Figure 3A; in agreement with the published
phylogenetic tree [27]). These genes should be respectively renamed, e.g. Hox12a and Hox12b. The ambulacraria posterior genes (9/10 and 11/13 groups) were all
assigned to PG9. HoxPred also systematically classified
ecdyosozoan Posterior Hox sequences in PG9. Finally, in
lophotrochozans, the predictions were ambiguous: Post1
and Post2 both alternated between PG9, PG12 and CTL,
likely because these sequences are quite divergent [51].
An alternative hypothesis is that this uncertainty reflects
an affinity for both PG9 and PG12, already present in
an ancestral bilaterian PG9/PG12-like posterior gene
and retained in lophotrochozoans.
HoxPred predictions of posterior sequences have
strong statistical support, with posterior probabilities
similarly high as Anterior or Central sequences (Additional file 2, Tables S1, S4). However, as many of the
predictions fall in the PG9 and PG10 groups, we conducted additional statistical tests (Additional file 1, Figure S3) to provide evidences that neither the PG9 nor

Figure 3 Models for the evolution of Posterior and Central Hox genes in bilaterians. A. Posterior Hox genes. The predicted PGs for each
phylogenetic group are indicated with colors in the tables. Inside these table, the names of the genes are indicated when HoxPred predictions
differ from their current annotation. The possible emergence of individual PGs are indicated on the schematic tree with vertical bars (only the
PG content is considered, not the actual number of genes belonging to each PG, i.e. lineage-specific duplication and losses of individual genes
are not indicated). Given that both protostomes and deuterostomes have PG9 predictions, it seems that a Hox9 gene was already present in
Urbilateria. PG10 would have emerged in deuterostomes, in the lineage leading to chordates. After the divergence of cephalochordates, the
lineage leading to urochordates and vertebrates would have acquired PG12. PG14 appeared in vertebrates. With respect to PG11, this group
could have emerged either before or after the split between urochordates and vertebrates. Considering that both Ciona intestinalis and
Oikopleura dioica have disintegrated clusters and likely miss PGs, we cannot exclude a possible loss of PG11 in urochordates. The emergence of
PG13 is uncertain due to the prediction of the amphioxus Hox15 gene as PG13. It could either be early in the chordate lineage, or in the last
common ancestor of urochordates and vertebrates. B. Central Hox genes. The possible emergence and loss of individual PGs are indicated on
the schematic tree with vertical bars and crosses, respectively. Four Central PGs were present in Urbilateria (PG4, PG5, PG6 and PG7). PG6 and
PG7 would have been independently lost within deuterostomes. PG8 emerged in vertebrates.

PG10 acts as a general ‘Hox class’ that would attract
Hox sequences irrespective of their real identity.
Our analysis of HoxPred assignments favors the
hypothesis of multiple independent duplications over
the ‘Deuterostome Posterior Flexibility’ hypothesis alone,
and allows to propose a global model for Posterior
genes evolution in bilaterians (Figure 3A). In this model,
we have only considered the PG9 predictions for protostomes, since the PG12 predictions in lophotrochozoans
do not seem consistent. These predictions could be artifactual and might not indicate the presence of a PG12
gene in the protostome ancestor. Although poorly parsimonious in terms of duplication events, our model is
supported by (i) the fact that urochordates, rather than
cephalochordates, would be closer to vertebrates [52],
thereby challenging the view that the amphioxus Hox

cluster is the archetypal cluster from which aroused the
vertebrate clusters - interestingly, there are more
HoxPred predictions in common between vertebrates
and urochordates than with cephalochordates; (ii) Many
gene families, such as the bHLH family of transcription
factors, have undergone multiple duplications specifically in the amphioxus [47,53]; (iii) Deuterostome Posterior Flexibity has been questioned in ambulacraria
[44,45]; (iv) The amphioxus and vertebrate Hox14 genes
do not group together in phylogenetic trees [48].
The bilaterian Central genes enigma

While evolutionary relationships between Central genes
from PG4 and PG5 across bilaterians were quite well
resolved, phylogenetic approaches failed to decipher the
relationships between the other three Central genes,

Thomas-Chollier et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/73

eventually classified in a single broad PG6-8 group
[21,44,46]. HoxPred predictions for PG4 and PG5 were
consistent with tree-based annotation (Figure 3B and
Additional file 2, Table S4). For PG6-8, we found that
ecdysozoan and lophotrochozoan genes are predicted
into PG6 and PG7, with a strong tendency towards Ubx,
abd-A, Lox2 and Lox4 predicted as PG6, and ftz, Antp
and Lox5 predicted as PG7 (Figure 3B and Additional
file 2, Table S4). Ambulacraria and cephalochordates
predictions are restricted to PG7, whereas urochordates
only have PG6 predictions. Vertebrates is the only phylogenetic group having PG8 predictions, in addition to
PG6 and PG7. These data suggest that PG4, PG5, PG6
and PG7 would have been present in the last common
ancestor of all bilaterians (Urbilateria), and PG8 would
have emerged in Vertebrates. The deuterostome predictions call for caution, as they would imply a loss of PG6
along with an expansion of PG7 genes in both Ambulacraria and cephalochordates, and a loss of PG7 in urochordates, a scenario which seems poorly parsimonious.
However, urochordates have clearly lost members of
many gene families [53,54] and similar poorly parsimonious scenarios have been proposed for other genes
families, for example the iroquois/Irx genes [55].
Identification of Hox genes in Cnidaria

Reconstructing the Hox repertoire of the Cnidaria/
Bilateria ancestor is a notorious challenge, as cnidarian
‘Hox-like’ genes are difficult to relate to the bilaterian
homologous groups with traditionnal sequence similaritybased or phylogenetic analyses. The various phylogenetic
studies published so far yielded a somewhat confuse picture [12,27,31,32,56]. We analysed the HoxPred assignments for all the homeobox genes from the fully
sequenced Nematostella vectensis genome, as well as for
37 additional homeodomain sequences, from 11 other cnidarian species (Figure 4 and Additional file 2, Table S5).
Using the “Bilateria” version of HoxPred, we found that
most cnidarian Hox and ParaHox genes were classified as
CTL, at the exception of a few Anterior and Gsx genes.
This is not surprising given the divergent nature of the
cnidarian Hox and ParaHox genes with respect to those
from bilaterians. The “relaxed” versions of HoxPred, however, allow to classify cnidarian genes. The cnidarian Hox
genes fall in Anterior, Central and Posterior groups predictions which strongly contradict the commonly accepted
idea of a lack of Central Hox genes in Cnidaria [12,27],
but see alternative hypotheses [10,56]. Genes predicted
as Central include anthox1 and anthox1a from
the anthozoan Nematostella, which have been difficult
to relate to a bilaterian group of homology, considered
as either Central/Posterior [56], Posterior [12], cnidarianspecific [27] or even non-Hox [31]. Still, they are usually
considered as non-anterior Hox genes [12,27,31,56]; their

classification by HoxPred in the Central group is therefore
in agreement with this view. Predictions as Central genes
also encompass genes from hydrozoans (e.g. cnox1 from
Eleutheria dichotoma) and a scyphozoan (scox3 from Cassiopea xamachana). Within the Anterior group, we found
predictions for PG1 and PG3 that corroborate phylogenetic analyses [18,27], but not for PG2 in contradiction to
what has been reported in [12,32]. Predictions as Posterior
genes, only found in hydrozoans and scyphozoans, are
compatible with previous assignments [18,32]. However,
most of the genes predicted as Posterior by the “Bilateria_relaxed” version of HoxPred are classified as Central
genes with the “Vertebrate_relaxed” version, apart from
scox4 that is predicted as Posterior by the two “relaxed”
versions. This uncertainty may reflect that these genes
may have arisen from an ancestral Central/Posterior gene.
In summary, our analysis indicates that cnidarians
would possess three to four types of Hox genes, namely
Anterior PG1, Anterior PG3, Central, and Posterior
(or Central/Posterior) and therefore suggest that these
three to four categories of Hox genes were already present in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians (Figure 5).
ParaHox predictions: implications for the ProtoHox
models

The ParaHox cluster of genes has long been supposed
to be the sister cluster of the Hox cluster, with the Gsx,
Xlox and Cdx genes corresponding to the Anterior, PG3
and Posterior groups, respectively [13]. This view has
been recently challenged by analyses of cnidaria data, by
questioning both the cluster duplication model [12,32]
and the grouping of ParaHox genes with the Hox
homology groups [18]. Assuming that Hox and ParaHox
are nevertheless sister clusters which derived from a single ancestral ProtoHox cluster (reviewed in [18]), we
tried to determine how the ParaHox genes can be
related to the Hox genes. To do this we adopted a
“Hox-centric” view, i.e. we used the “relaxed” versions of
HoxPred to assign ParaHox genes in Hox PGs (Figure 5
and Additional file 2, Table S5, S6). Our attempt to perform the reverse analysis (i.e. to define in which

Figure 5 Models for the early evolution of Hox and ParaHox genes. The predicted homology groups for each phylogenetic group are
indicated with colors in the table. The uncertainty of the phylogenetic position of placozoans is indicated by a dashed line [64,65]. The
cnidarian/bilaterian ancestor inferred Hox-ParaHox repertoire is depicted in a double box. Posterior genes are depicted with two colors to reflect
the uncertainty of predictions into Central and Posterior groups. This repertoire would result from three equally parsimonious scenarios: a twogene ProtoHox cluster composed of ancestral Anterior/PG3 and Central (or Central/Posterior) genes, undergoing two or three duplications; a
three-gene ProtoHox cluster composed of ancestral Anterior/PG1, Anterior/PG3 and Central (or Central/Posterior) genes undergoing one gene
loss, and one or two duplication; or a four-gene ProtoHox cluster composed of ancestral Anterior/PG1, Anterior/PG3, Central and Posterior genes,
undergoing two gene losses and a possible duplication.

ParaHox groups individual Hox genes would be
assigned) remained inconclusive due to the very small
size of the training dataset.
We found that Gsx and Xlox genes were consistently
predicted as Anterior/PG3 across bilaterians. Gsx is
similarly predicted as Anterior/PG3 in cnidarians and
placozoans. The few Xlox genes from cnidarians predicted as Central could indicate that cnidarians Xlox
would have emerged from a Central-like gene and are
therefore distinct from the bilaterian PG3-derived Xlox
genes. Alternatively, cnidarians Xlox might be related to
bilaterian Xlox, but because of derived sequences as
compared to their bilaterian counterpart, they may have
been misclassified by HoxPred. Our results do not support the traditional grouping of Gsx with PG1, but are
consistent with a recent phylogenetic analysis that
regroups Gsx and Xlox into a PG2/PG3 group [18]. Cdx
genes are consistently predicted in the Central group,
rather than in the Posterior group.
Taken together with our data on cnidarian Hox genes,
the cnidarian/bilaterian ancestor would have had a minimal Hox repertoire of four genes, composed of Anterior/
PG1, Anterior/PG3, Central and Posterior, and a minimal
ParaHox repertoire of two genes (Gsx and Cdx). Our
results are coherent with three main ProtoHox models
that seem equally parsimonious (Figure 5): (1) a fourgene ProtoHox cluster (Anterior/PG1, Anterior/PG3,

Central and Posterior) [13] - the four genes would have
been conserved in the Hox cluster and two genes (Anterior/PG1 and Posterior) would have been lost in the
ParaHox cluster; (2) a three-gene ProtoHox cluster
(Anterior/PG1, Anterior/PG3 and Central/Posterior) previously proposed [10] but where the Central genes
would have emerged specifically in bilaterians and not in
cnidarians - one duplication would have produced the
Posterior and Central Hox genes and one loss would
explain the absence of Anterior/PG1 ParaHox genes; (3)
a two-gene ProtoHox cluster (Anterior/PG3 and Central/
Posterior) - this is somewhat different to a previously
suggested two-gene ProtoHox model (Anterior/PG1 and
Posterior) [14] - in our model, the ancestral Anterior/
PG3 and Central/Posterior genes would have respectively
given rise to the Hox genes of the PG3, PG1 and of the
Central, Posterior groups, by two duplication events. In
the three proposed models, Gsx and Cdx derive from
ancestral Anterior/PG3-like and Central-like genes,
respectively; Xlox might have evolved from a PG3-like
gene by duplication prior to the cnidarians/bilaterians
split, or independently in bilaterians (from PG3-like) and
cnidarians (from Central-like).

Conclusions
The extensions of HoxPred presented here fulfill the
needs for automatic Hox classification across all

Thomas-Chollier et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/73

bilaterians. This method is well-suited for the evergrowing amount of sequences to analyse, by combining
predictive accuracy and time efficiency (3000 sequences
screened per hour on a standard laptop). HoxPred is
easily accessible to the community through a userfriendly web page [36]. The HoxPred automatic classification for thousands of homeodomain sequences are
provided in the freely available Datab’Hox database [36].
This new resource thereby offers supplementary information to the existing database HomeoDB [57], a manually curated database of homeobox genes with
annotations based on published articles - when possible,
links to HomeoDB are provided from Datab’Hox.
Our analyses illustrate the capacity of HoxPred to
provide valuable predictions in ongoing genome projects. It is particularly appropriate for dispersed Hox
clusters, as it directly pinpoints the potential Hox
sequences. Beyond its classification purposes, we
showed that HoxPred can also serve to study the evolution of Hox genes in metazoans. In this respect, we propose here evolutionary scenarios for several crucial
questions. Bilaterian posterior Hox genes would have
arisen from an ancestral PG9, with new homology
groups arising in chordates, and in ambulacraria (group
11/13). Our model favours independent duplications, or
a mixture of the two processes as suggested in [44,47],
over the “Deuterostome Posterior Flexibility” hypothesis
alone. It would be beneficial for the community to
revise the nomenclature of the posterior Hox genes in
non-vertebrate deuterostomes, so that the number of a
gene with respect to its position within the cluster
would not be confused with its homology group. Our
evolutionary scenario for bilaterian Central genes suggests that Urbilateria would have possessed Central
genes from PG4, PG5, PG6 and PG7; PG8 appearing
later in vertebrates. Besides, our results bring additional
support to the grouping of the Central protostome
genes into Ubd-A-type and ftz/Antp/Lox5. We also provide further insights into the notoriously controversial
relationships between cnidaria and bilateria Hox genes.
Our analysis suggests that the cnidarian/bilaterian
ancestor would have had a minimal Hox repertoire of
four genes, from the Anterior/PG1, Anterior/PG3, Central and Posterior groups. HoxPred thus yields stimulating results in the context of the current views, by
indicating the presence of cnidarian Central gene.
Regarding the ParaHox genes, we suggest that Gsx
derived from an ancestral PG3-like gene, while Cdx
would be closer to the Central (Central/Posterior)
genes, which is coherent with our data on cnidarian
Hox genes. Xlox would have independently emerged
from a PG3-like gene in bilaterians and from a Centrallike gene in cnidarians, or alternatively emerged earlier,
from a PG3-like gene. Taken together, our results are

consistent with three possible models for the early evolution of Hox and ParaHox genes: a two-gene (Anterior/PG3, Central/Posterior), a three-gene (Anterior/
PG1, Anterior/PG3 and Central/Posterior), or a fourgene (Anterior/PG1, Anterior/PG3, Central, Posterior)
ProtoHox model.

Methods
Sequence Datasets

Sequences were mostly retrieved from UniprotKB [58]
release 14.5. Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sequences
were deduced from the annotation of the Hox cluster
sequence (Genbank accession AC165428) and also
retrieved from the sea urchin genome project http://
www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/seaurchin/[59]. The
draft assemblies of the Capitella sp. I, Helobdella
robusta, Lottia gigantea, Daphnia pulex and Branchiostoma floridae genomes are accessible at the DOE Joint
Genome Institute http://www.jgi.doe.gov/. To analyse
these genomes with HoxPred, the complete sets of
homeodomain proteins were first filtered as in [35].
Here, only proteins matching the InterPro IPR001356 or
IPR001827 homeobox domain were retrieved and
further analysed.
The four versions of HoxPred

The initial HoxPred program [35] was constructed from
vertebrate sequences only, and constitutes the “Vertebrate” version (not used in this study). The same procedure as in [35] was followed to produce the three new
versions (including leave-one-out cross-validation, permutation tests and a variable selection step). The prior
probabilities values were similar. For the “Bilateria” and
“Bilateria_relaxed” versions, 6 new profiles corresponding to the Anterior, Central, Posterior, Gsx, Xlox and
Cdx homology groups were developed. These profiles
were constructed from alignments of 440 Hox and 37
ParaHox non-redundant homeodomain sequences
(Additional file 4). These sequences were collected from
publicly available databases and then manually curated.
Sequences that were well-annotated and unambiguously
classified into the Anterior, Central, Posterior, Gsx,
Xlox and Cdx homology groups in a phylogenetic tree
(not shown) were included in this training dataset. Contrary to the Vertebrate version, these sequences were
extracted from various bilaterian phyla (including vertebrates). The “Vertebrate"/"Vertebrate_relaxed” and “Bilateria"/"Bilateria_relaxed” versions were respectively built
upon the same collections of profiles. The main difference is related to the datasets used for the training of
the discriminant analysis. In the “relaxed” versions, the
control (CTL) group contains randomly-generated
(RANDOM) sequences only. In the “non-relaxed” versions, the CTL group consists of both RANDOM and

Thomas-Chollier et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/73

non-Hox homeodomain sequences (HOMEO) (1074
bilaterian sequences for the “Bilateria” version). The
“non-relaxed” versions thus return all non-Hox
sequences in the CTL group, while the “relaxed” versions can classify such sequences into Hox PG, thereby
allowing the study of ParaHox sequences. All versions
of HoxPred return classifications with posterior probabilities; the group with the highest posterior probability
is considered as the prediction.
Evaluation of HoxPred predictions

The statistical evaluation of HoxPred predictions was
performed on 800 public sequences (89 Hox and 711
non-Hox), with the programs compare-classes (option
matrix file) and contigency-stats from the Regulatory
Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT) [60]/Network Analysis
Tools (NeAT) [61], available at http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/
. The statistic used to evaluate the performance of
HoxPred (Table 1), is the geometric accuracy, as previously described in [35]. For “relaxed” versions that
are not intended for direct classification purposes, the
accuracy is calculated for Hox genes only (excluding
predictions of non-Hox homeobox genes), which underestimates the global accuracy.
