Abstract
: The GT dinucleotide in the first two intron positions is the most conserved element of the U2
donor splice signals. However, in a small fraction of donor sites, GT is replaced by GC. A substantial
enrichment of GC in donor sites of alternatively spliced genes has been observed previously in
human, nematode and Arabidopsis, suggesting that GC signals are important for regulation of
alternative splicing. We used parsimony analysis to reconstruct evolution of donor splice sites and
inferred 298 GT > GC conversion events compared to 40 GC > GT conversion events in primate
and rodent genomes. Thus, there was substantive accumulation of GC donor splice sites during the
evolution of mammals. Accumulation of GC sites might have been driven by selection for
alternative splicing.

Findings
In vertebrates, most of the protein-coding genes are interrupted by multiple introns that are removed at the donor
and acceptor splice sites so that the adjacent exons are
spliced. This process is mediated by an elaborate molecular machine, the spliceosome that consists of 5 snRNPs
(small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles) along with
numerous less stably associated proteins, and is conserved
throughout the eukaryotic world [1-3]. The U2 spliceosome (the major eukaryotic spliceosome) interacts with
specific parts of the intron and the flanking exons to
ensure accurate and efficient splicing [4]. The nucleotides
at the intron termini and the adjacent nucleotides in the
exons are involved in these interactions and comprise the
splicing signal. The (A/C)AG|GT(A/G)AGT consensus

sequence (the exon|intron boundary is shown by the vertical streak and the first two nucleotides of the intron are
underlined) at the donor splice signal is complementary
to the 5' end of U1 snRNA, and this interaction is believed
to be the major requirement for splicing [5-7].
The GT dinucleotide in the first two intron positions is the
most conserved element of the U2 donor splice signal.
However, in a small fraction of donor sites (<1%), GT is
replaced by GC; in these cases, the rest of the nucleotides
in the donor signal adhere more closely to the consensus
sequence, apparently, compensating for the T to C substitution that is unfavorable for splicing [8-10]. This rare
class of donor splice signals has been implicated in alternative splicing [9,11,12]. For example, the conserved C at

the +2 position of the 10th intron of the let-2 gene which
encodes one of the collagen isoforms is essential for developmentally regulated alternative splicing in the nematode
C. elegans. Replacement of the GC donor signal with a
moderate or strong GT signal abolishes splicing regulation
and leads to excessive usage of exon 10 of let-2 in embryos
[11]. Generally, a substantial enrichment of GC donor signals in alternatively spliced genes has been observed in
human, C. elegans and Arabidopsis [9,11,12].
Pairwise comparisons of GC splicing signals in the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae suggested that
GC donor signals are not evolutionarily conserved in
nematodes: among the 26 C. elegans GC-AG introns, only
5 had a GC-AG counterpart in C. briggsae [11]. Frequent
switching between GT-AG and GC-AG introns has been
reported for 5 vertebrate genomes [10]. We were interested in exploring the genome-wide evolutionary dynamics of the donor splice sites and, in particular, sought to
determine whether there might be a trend toward depletion or accumulation of GC.
Genomic alignments of 8 vertebrates (chicken, opossum,
dog, cow, rhesus macaque, human, mouse and rat) were
extracted from the UCSC genome browser (Additional file
1) [13,14] and used to map cases of GC > GT and GT > GC

conversion to the branches of the mammalian phylogeny
(Figure 1). Terminal leaves of the tree (individual
genomes) are more vulnerable to the effects of sequencing
errors and/or population polymorphism than internal
branches [15]. Therefore, only those sites were analyzed in
which the GC or GT donor signal was shared by at least
two sister taxa (e.g., we assign the GC signature to the
rodent clade when GC was found in both mouse and rat
sequences). It was further required that either GT or GC
signal was conserved in all outgroup species for which an
alignment was available at the given site (the presence of
the dog and cow sequences was unconditionally
required). Altogether, there were 122,621 and 253 invariant GT and GC donor signals, respectively, and 656 variable sites of which 338 mapped to internal branches and
were employed for the analysis of evolutionary dynamics.
The GC>GT and GT>GC conversion events were reconstructed using maximum parsimony (Figure 1). Unexpectedly, we observed a pronounced excess of GT>GC
conversion over GC>GT conversion that is indicative of
accumulation of GC donor splice sites in both primate
and rodent genomes (Figure 1). The trend is stronger in
the rodent lineage than in the primate lineage (Figure 1),
an observation that is consistent with the overall fast
genome evolution in rodents [16]. The apparent accumu-

lation of GC donor signals was further supported by the
analysis of the terminal branches of the tree although the
excess of GC>GT conversions in macaque compared to
human (Figure 1) could be caused by sequencing errors
and/or population polymorphism. The observed excess of
GT>GC conversions was robust with respect to the composition of the outgroup species set (Additional file 2).
The observed excess of GT>GC conversions hardly can be
explained by a nucleotide substitution bias. It has been
repeatedly shown that mammalian genomes have a tendency to become more AT-rich [17-19]. Even if one
assumes that, due to unknown reasons, this trend is
reversed in the donor sites so that T to C substitutions are
twice as frequent as C to T substitutions, such a bias would
not account for the observed excess of GT>GC conversion
events (P < 10-10 according to the χ2 test for pooled conversion events).
Considering that mutational bias did not seem to be a
plausible cause of the observed accumulation of GC
donor sites, it seems most likely that this trend has to do
with the involvement of GC sites in alternative splicing
that is widespread and essential in mammals [9,11,12]. As
GT>GC conversion can substantially alter the pattern of
alternative splicing [11], these changes might become
beneficial and eventually would be fixed in the population. Thus, positive selection could be a plausible explanation for the observed accumulation of GC in donor sites.
However, an even more plausible scenario would involve
evolution of a strong splice site context that would allow
neutral fixation of GC sites. The neutrally fixed GC sites,
then, could be recruited for alternative splicing and thus
would become subject to purifying selection forbidding
the reverse GC>GT conversion.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1: Jerzy Jurka, Genetic Information
Research Institute
This paper reports the relatively straightforward observation that GC donor splice sites tend to accumulate during
evolution of mammals. However, the suggestion of selection for alternative splicing would be more convincing if
the authors could demonstrate the GC accumulation separately in AT-rich and GC-rich genomic regions in mammals, where the dynamics of GT replacement by GC may
be different.
Authors' response
We appreciate the suggestion that the dynamics of GC accumulation could depend on the base composition in the respective
regions of the mammalian genomes.

So we performed a crude comparison of the occurrence of GC
donor sites and the rates of donor site conversion in AT-rich and
GC-rich regions. Table 1shows that, although there was a statistically significant excess of GC donor sites in GC-rich
regions, there was only a marginal, not statistically significant
difference between the corresponding rates of donor site conversions. Thus, it appears that the accumulation of GC donor sites
described here does not strongly depend on the nucleotide composition of the corresponding genomic regions.
Reviewer's report 2: Anton Nekrutenko, Pennsylvania
State University
In this discovery note authors point out accumulation of
non- canonical GC donor splice signals in mammals,
against the previously observed nucleotide substitution
bias. They provide a convincing explanation suggesting
that GT->GC conversion may be beneficial for mammals
as it creates additional possibilities for alternative splicing
events. In my opinion these observations provide a platform for launching more detailed investigation of alternative splicing through comparative genomics and raise
numerous interesting question (e.g., are any of the GC
sites overlap with known SNPs?). Thus publication of this

On a technical side the authors used a rather complex procedure for retrieving splice sites from TBA alignments.
