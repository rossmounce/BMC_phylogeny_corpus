Abstract
Background: The fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain consists of approximately 200 amino acid
residues, which has high sequence similarity to the C-terminal halves of fibrinogen β and γ chains.
Fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) containing one or more FBG domains are found universally in
vertebrates and invertebrates. In invertebrates, FREPs are involved in immune responses and other
aspects of physiology. To understand the complexity of this gene family in Drosophila, we analyzed
FREPs in twelve Drosophila species.
Results: Using the genome data from 12 Drosophila species, we identified FBG domains in each
species. The results show that the gene numbers in each species vary from 14 genes up to 43 genes.
Using sequence profile analysis, we found that FBG domains have high sequence similarity and are
highly conserved throughout. By comparison of structure and sequence conservation, some of the
FBG domains in Drosophila melanogaster are predicted to function in recognition of carbohydrates
and their derivatives on the surface of microorganisms in innate immunity.
Conclusion: Sequence and structural analyses show that FREP family across 12 Drosophila species
contains conserved FBG domains. Expansion of the FREP families in Drosophila is mainly accounted
by a major expansion of FBG domains.

Background
In mammals, fibrinogen is composed of six polypeptide
chains, two each of the Aα, Bβ and γ chains. Fibrinogen is
a soluble plasma protein, which participates in both the
cellular phase and the fluid phase of coagulation [1]. The
fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain consists of approximately
200 amino acid (aa) residues and has high sequence similarity to the C-terminal halves of fibrinogen β and γ
chains. However, the two loops in the fibrinogen γ fragment are shortened by 14 and 7 aa in FBG domain respectively [2,3]. Fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) contain
one or more FBG domains, which are found universally in

vertebrates and invertebrates [2,3]. In mammals, three
distinct fibrinogen-related proteins have been identified:
ficolin, tenascins, and microfibril-associated protein
(MAP) [4-6]. All of these FREPs contain an FBG domain
in their C terminus, but differ in their N-terminal regions.
Ficolins are the most important molecules that have been
studied so far, and they act as pattern recognition receptors to bind pathogens in host innate immunity initiating
immune responses [4,7-9]. The FBG domain in ficolins is
able to form polymer through collagen O-like triple helices, and is responsible for N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)
and other sugar binding activity [4,7-9]. Recent studies

have shown that human serum ficolins act as phagocytic
receptors on circulating monocytes for microorganism
recognition [10].
In invertebrates, several FREPs have been reported in various species, such as tachylectins from the horseshoe crab,
Tachypleus tridentatus [2], fibrinogen-related proteins
(FREP) from the snail, Biomphalaria glabrata [11], ficolins
from the solitary ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi [12], tachylectin-related protein in the sponge, Suerites domuncula
[13] and aslectin from the mosquito, Armigeres subalbatus
[14]. All of these FREPs contain a common C-terminal
FBG domain. These FREPs likely play an important role in
the innate immune response against parasites [2,13,14].
The FBG domain of tachylectin is able to bind GlcNAc [2].
Aslectin can bind GlcNAc and bacteria, and therefore it is
likely involved in the antibacterial immune response in
mosquitoes [14]. Recently we characterized the FBG
domains of FREPs genome-wide in mosquito, Anopheles
gambiae, and predicted that some of the FBG domains
may function by binding to pathogens in host immune
response [3]. The FBG domain proteins have been identified and characterized recently with respect to immune
response in mosquito [15].
Comparative genome analysis of related species provided
a powerful and general approach for identifying functional elements without previous knowledge of function
[16,17]. It has substantial power to identify genes, define
gene structure, highlight rapid and slow evolutionary
change, identify regulatory elements and reveal combinatorial control of gene regulation. Furthermore, it allows
identification of all the major differences among the
organisms [16-18]. The power is comparable to experimental analysis in terms of sensitivity and precision [17].
With the 11 additional Drosophila species genomes
sequenced, this extensive sequence resource, encompassing species with well-defined phylogenetic relationships,
provides a model system for comparative genomic analyses [19]. In this study, we apply sequence profile analysis
and comparative genomics to the wealth of new information from 12 Drosophila species genomes to identify FBG
domains in FREPs. Provided is an overview of FREP gene
family, including sequence alignments, patterns of conservation, phylogenetic relationships and potential function.

Results and Discussion
Fibrinogen-related proteins and fibrinogen-like domain in
the 12 Drosophila species
Fibrinogen-like domains have been well defined in mammals and insects [2,3,20]. In order to select FBG domain
seed in Drosophila melanogaster, human ficolins were used
to BLAST against D. melanogaster proteins. The resulting
sequences were aligned and the FBG domain of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/260

NP_611160 (FBgn0034160) was selected as a seed to perform a BLAST search. Meanwhile, sixty amino acids were
used as the minimum length of homology, and protein
sequences having 35% or greater amino acid identity were
chosen as FREP protein. This search identified 285 FREP
proteins in the genome of 12 Drosophila species (Table 1).
The data showed that the numbers of FREPs in each Drosophila species vary from 14 genes up to 43 genes. All the
species in Drosophila subgenus have more than 20 genes
while four of the eight species in Sophophora subgenus
have more than 20 genes (Table 1). D. Yakuba has the least
gene number with just 14 genes, and D. grimshawi has
most gene number, with 43 FREP genes, followed by D.
willistoni and D. virilis with 34 and 33 FREPs respectively
(Table 1). Unlike olfactory receptors for which the gene
number in each species has been quite stable during evolution [21], the numbers of FREP genes are divergent in
Drosophila species, suggesting this gene family evolved
under relaxed constraints.
To detect known domain structure in the FREP proteins,
the SledgeHMMER program was used to scan the protein
sequences [22,23]. The data showed that all the FREP proteins contain at least one FBG domain (Additional file 1).
Interestingly, four FREP proteins contain multiple FBG
domains, e.g. dgri _7049, dgri _7054 and dana _11471
contain 2 FBG domains and dwil _15059 has 3 FBG
domains (Additional file 1). Most of the FREP proteins
have one FBG domain located in the C-terminus. In these
FREP proteins, we found that the majority contain a full
length FBG domain composed of approximately 200
amino acids, which is similar to the full length FBG
domains in human and mosquitoes [2,3,20]. However,
some of the FREPs contain a truncated FBG domain
(Table 1 and Additional file 1). This could be caused by
sequencing error or automated annotation [3,22]. Besides
FBG domains in FREP proteins, we also found that 14 of
FREP proteins contain other known domains; detailed
information is available in Additional file 1.
Phylogenetic relationship of fibrinogen-like domains and
chromosomal location of fibrinogen-related proteins
To analyze the evolutionary history of FBG domains in the
FREP family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the
alignments of the conserved FBG domains using Neighbor Joining. The striking pattern in this tree is that of FBG
domains from different species being grouped together,
indicating that they are orthologous genes (Fig. 1A, Table
2 and Additional file 2). This suggests that these FBG
domains are stable across Drosophila species during evolution. We also found that some clusters are composed of
FBG domains only from one species, such as D. grimshawi
(Fig. 1B and Table 2), suggesting that gene expansion
occurred in D. grimshawi after divergence of this species
from the others. The FBG domains from D. willistoni

formed two separate branches far apart in the tree (Additional file 2). Furthermore, some clusters are composed of
FBG domains from a few Drosophila species instead of all,
e.g, the majority of FBG domains from D. virilis, D.
mojavensis and D. grimshawi are clustered together, and
FBG domains from D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura form
a cluster as well (Fig. 1C, Table 2 and Additional file 2).
Interestingly, in the evolutionary tree, for D. virilis, D.
mojavensis and D. grimshawi of Drosophila subgenus, the
FBG domains are clustered together and far apart from
Sophophora subgenus, suggesting that the gene divergence
had occurred after divergence of these three species from
the others.
To understand the evolutionary history of this gene family
across closely related species, we also compared the correlations between chromosomal locations of FREP and
sequence similarities of FBG domains among the family
members. Gene locations for the FREP family have been
retrieved from the AAA database [24]. None of the FREP
genes were observed on the dot chromosome, which is
chromosome 4 in D. melanogaster. Some of FREP genes

are arrayed in tandem and form clusters (Fig. 2), especially
the clusters in the Drosophila subgenus of D. mojavensis,
D. virilis and D. grimshawi, and the similar pattern was
also observed in Sophophora subgenus, including D.
pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. wilistoni (Fig. 2). If
the number of FBG domains increased mainly by tandem
duplication, we would expect the domains which are
physically clustered in the genome to form a monophyletic group. By examining the relationships between
phyletic pattern and chromosomal location of the FBG
domains, this pattern was only identified in D. wilistoni,
which is that the genes clustered on a single D. wilistoni
scaffold occurred to be in close-by branch in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2 and Additional file 2). The vast majority
of FBG domains closely located in the genome are scattered in different clusters in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2
and Additional file 2). This suggests that a dynamic history for the FBG domains likely involved shuffling among
chromosomes. The predicted role, for at least a subset of
these FBG domains, is in carbohydrate sensing (see
below). This expansion in the Drosophila genome may
have been a response to the diversity of carbohydrates
encountered, resulting in the utilization of numerous FBG
domain variations in order to recognize a broad range of
different carbohydrates.
Conserved structure of the FBG domains and their
potential function
In order to construct an optimal multiple alignment of the
FBG domain, we first aligned selected sequences from D.
melanogaster with the T_Coffee program [25,26] (Fig. 3).
Multiple alignment of the FBG domain sequences showed
that FBG domains are highly similar throughout. Using
the multiple alignments of the FBG domains as queries,
the secondary structure was predicted with the PHD program [27], which showed that the FBG domains have a
highly conserved structure profile (Fig. 3). To further compare the predicted secondary structure of the FBG
domains with known structures, we found that the FBG
domain is structurally related to the FBG domains of
human ficolin and TL5A in the protein data bank (PDB)
[20,28]. The FBG domains of human ficolin and TL5A
comprise of a central and larger domain B and a relatively
smaller domain P [20,28]. The domain B is predominantly built up by a twisted seven stranded anti-parallel βsheet (strands β3-β7, β9 and β12) and helices α4 and α5
functioning as the backbone. The domain P possesses
only a few short elements of secondary structure, and
comprises the major functional site forming a binding
pocket [20,24]. The predicted secondary structures of the
FBG domains in the FREP gene family approximately correspond to the domain architectures of FBG domains in
human ficolin and TL5A (Fig. 3). The β-sheets and α-helices in the predicted structure of the FBG domain are
highly conserved with the corresponding structures in

Selected clusters of phylogenetic tree of the FBG domains in the 12 Drosophila species. The seed sequence used
for constructing the tree was the multiple sequence alignment of FBG domains that excluded truncated FBG domains. Bootstrap was applied to the data. Protein distance was calculated using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of change between
amino acids and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method of inferring different rates of evolution at different amino acid positions. Neighbor-joining was applied to produce the tree. The FBG domains of each FREP are denoted by their gene name or
GLEANR gene ID. A. A cluster composed of FBG domains from multiple species (Group D in supplement fig. 2). B. A cluster

TL5A, especially in the domain B (Fig. 3). For example, the
central strand β12, which extends the C terminus of
domain P back to domain B and brings both polypeptide
termini in close proximity, was also seen in Drosophila
FBG domains (Fig. 3). This suggests that the FBG domain
architecture is conserved among human, horseshoe crab
and D. melanogaster. The projection of some of the highly
conserved domains that form the ligand-binding pocket
suggests that the core structure of the ligand-binding
pocket is also likely to be conserved across these FBG
domains (Fig. 3). These observations imply that the FBG

domains are most likely to function as receptors for carbohydrates or their derivatives. Beyond the common core,
FBG domains also show great diversity in terms of the
insertions and deletions among the conserved domains,
for example, NP_476710 loses a conserved domain due to
deletion and NP_647820 has a short insertion located in
the loop region (Fig. 3). By comparison of amino acids in
the FBG domains of FREP corresponding to the P domain
binding site in TL5A, we found that the domain architectures of these FBG domains have considerable diversity
that is incorporated into a shared basic architectural blue-

print (Fig. 3). In invertebrates, several FREP proteins have
been reported to play an important role in innate immunity and in particular in the recognition of parasites
[2,13,14]. Aslectin can be upregulated by bacterial challenge and is able to bind GlcNAc and bacteria [14]. The
FBG domain of TL5A can form a ligand-binding pocket
specifically recognizing the acetyl-group in eliciting an
immune response [20]. These data suggest that the FBG
domains of FREPs in D. melanogaster probably function in
recognizing carbohydrate moieties in innate immunity.
These were further supported by microarray analysis in
melanogaster from GEO profile [29]. NP_611160 was
upregulated by virus infection, fugal infection and injury
[30,31]. NP_649170 was upregulated in cell line following LPS or E. coli infection [31]. Phenobarbital is a xenobiotic that triggers a defense response, inducing genes that

encode key detoxification enzymes. DHR96 is a xenobiotic receptor that controls metabolic and stress-response
genes [32]. NP_573254 is down-regulated following Phenobarbital treatment, but is not affected by DHR96. However, NP_647820 and NP_723894 are regulated by
DHR96 receptor [32]. These suggest that FREP genes play
important roles in both innate immunity and physiology.

Conclusion
The data demonstrated that the number of FREP genes in
each Drosophila species vary from 14 genes up to 43 genes.
Some of the FBG domains from different species are
grouped together in the phylogenetic tree, indicating that
they are orthologous genes. This suggests that these FBG
domains are stable across Drosophila species in evolutionary process. We also found that some clusters in the tree

are composed of FBG domains only from one species or a
few species instead of all 12 Drosophila species. By comparison of phylogenetic tree and chromosomal location of
FREPs, we found that expansion of the FREP families in
Drosophila is mainly accounted for by a major expansion
of FBG domains, and both tandem duplication and shuffling are involved in gene expansion of FREPs. The results
from sequence and structural analyses imply that FBG
domains are highly similar across 12 Drosophila species.
Some of the FBG domains in Drosophila melanogaster are
predicted to function in recognition of carbohydrates and
their derivatives on the surface of microorganisms in
innate immunity.

Methods
Database searching and sequence retrieving for
fibrinogen-related protein
Fibrinogen-like domain seed sequence was used to align
with the Drosophila proteome sequences using the BLAST
search. Flybase version 5.1 data was used for D. melanogaster while Comparative Annotation Freeze 1 (CAF1)
data was used for the other 11 Drosophila species [33,34].
The 11 Drosophila species other than D. melanogaster are D.
simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D.
pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. willistoni, D. mojavensis, D.
virilis, and D. grimshawi. The genome sequences are available from the Assembly, Alignment and Annotation of the
new 12 related Drosophila genomes [24]. The genus name
will be omitted in results and discussion. Translation
sequences of GLEANR gene models we used for the 11
Drosophila species were downloaded from AAA datasets
on January 2007. The resulting protein sequences from
the first search were used to iterate the search and retrieve
any left out FREPs. Sixty amino acids was used as a minimum length of the match along with 35% homology in
order to add a protein to the list of FREPs. The list was
manually checked and a non-redundant set of protein
sequences was obtained.
Domain identification in Drosophila fibrinogen-related
proteins
SledgeHMMER was used to carry out batch searching of
the current Pfam database (version 20.0) using the
'hmmpfam' program [22,23].
Genome location of fibrinogen-related proteins
Perl scripts were used to extract the chromosome location
for each gene (or scaffold if chromosome information is
not available) and show the distribution of FREPs in the
respective genomes of the 12 Drosophila species.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the
ClustalW for large data set or T_Coffee program
[25,26,35]. Multiple sequence alignment was visualized

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/260

using ESPript [36]. For phylogenetic tree construction, the
seed sequence was the multiple sequence alignment of
FBG domains that excluded truncated FBG domains.
Bootstrap was applied to the data. Protein distance was
calculated using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of
change between amino acids and a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) method of inferring different rates of evolution at
different amino acid positions. Neighbor-joining was
applied to produce the tree. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out with the package from PHYLIP [37], the consensus tree was drawn using the consense program and
visualized using the drawgram tool in this package.
Secondary structure prediction
Secondary structure prediction was produced with the
PHD program [27], with multiple sequence alignment of
FBG domains. The structure data of TL5A was obtained
from protein data bank (PBD) [38].
Microarray data retrieval
In order to find gene expression profiles in microarray
analysis, GEO profiles from NCBI [29] were searched for
each member of FREPs from D. melanogaster.
