Abstract
Background: Studies of Mycobacterium bovis BCG strains used in different countries and vaccination programs
show clear variations in the genomes and immune protective properties of BCG strains. The aim of this study was
to characterise the genomic and immune proteomic profile of the BCG 1931 strain used in Mexico.
Results: BCG Mexico 1931 has a circular chromosome of 4,350,386 bp with a G+C content and numbers of genes
and pseudogenes similar to those of BCG Tokyo and BCG Pasteur. BCG Mexico 1931 lacks Region of Difference 1
(RD1), RD2 and N-RD18 and one copy of IS6110, indicating that BCG Mexico 1931 belongs to DU2 group IV within
the BCG vaccine genealogy. In addition, this strain contains three new RDs, which are 53 (RDMex01), 655
(RDMex02) and 2,847 bp (REDMex03) long, and 55 single-nucleotide polymorphisms representing non-synonymous
mutations compared to BCG Pasteur and BCG Tokyo. In a comparative proteomic analysis, the BCG Mexico 1931,
Danish, Phipps and Tokyo strains showed 812, 794, 791 and 701 protein spots, respectively. The same analysis
showed that BCG Mexico 1931 shares 62% of its protein spots with the BCG Danish strain, 61% with the BCG
Phipps strain and only 48% with the BCG Tokyo strain. Thirty-nine reactive spots were detected in BCG Mexico
1931 using sera from subjects with active tuberculosis infections and positive tuberculin skin tests.
Conclusions: BCG Mexico 1931 has a smaller genome than the BCG Pasteur and BCG Tokyo strains. Two specific
deletions in BCG Mexico 1931 are described (RDMex02 and RDMex03). The loss of RDMex02 (fadD23) is associated
with enhanced macrophage binding and RDMex03 contains genes that may be involved in regulatory pathways.
We also describe new antigenic proteins for the first time.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem
worldwide; the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that there were 9.4 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths from TB in 2009 [1]. Bacillus CalmetteGuérin (BCG) is currently the only available vaccine
against tuberculosis. This vaccine protects against the
most severe forms of the disease, milliary and meningeal
tuberculosis; however, it is highly variable in its ability

to protect against pulmonary tuberculosis (0-80%).
There are several reasons for this variability, including
differences between BCG substrains, exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTMs), the nutritional or
genetic background of the population, differences in
trial methods and variations between different clinical
Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains [2-6].
Use of BCG in the early 1920s proved effective in protecting against TB, leading to distribution of the vaccine
in many countries. This distribution process and subsequent preservation resulted in the generation of numerous BCG substrains with different morphological,
biochemical and immunological features [7,8]. Several
studies on BCG substrains have demonstrated changes

at the genetic level, and comparative analyses of M.
tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. bovis BCG have identified
region of difference (RD) and tandem duplication (DU)
markers in these strains [9-12].
Regions of difference are DNA regions that are deleted
in the M. bovis and M. bovis BCG genomes compared to
M. tuberculosis. The RD1 region is involved in BCG
attenuation [7,13]. It has been shown that deletion of
this region in M. tuberculosis H37Rv leads to attenuation of the strain [14]; however, complementation of
BCG Pasteur with RD1 does not fully restore virulence
to wild-type levels [15]. BCG strains can be sub-classified according to the presence or absence of RD2 in
early and late strains, respectively. Recently, Kozak et al.
reported that BCG Pasteur, a strain that lacks RD2,
exhibits decreased immunogenicity compared to BCG
Russia, a strain that has retained RD2 [16]. Importantly,
these two strains show no difference in their level of
protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. Additionally,
Castillo-Rodal et al. have shown that the RDs described
to date do not correlate with the protective efficacy of
BCG substrains in a murine model [17]. The differences
observed among BCG strains suggest that additional
attenuating mutations may be involved in the attenuation of individual BCG strains.
Analysis of the BCG Pasteur 1173P2 genome sequence
has made it possible to construct a detailed genealogy of
BCG vaccines. BCG substrains are classified into four
groups (I-IV) based on RD and DU2 markers [9].
Furthermore, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that are unique to particular BCG substrains or shared
among substrains have been identified. Some of these
SNPs have functional implications for the affected
genes. For example, a SNP in mma3 (BCG0692c) is
responsible for the lack of methoxymycolate production
in late BCG substrains [18].
The evidence presented above supports further characterisation of BCG substrains to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and impact of attenuation
to rational design of new vaccines and therapeutics for
tuberculosis [2,19].
Even though it was one of the most widely used substrains for vaccination in Mexico, BCG Mexico 1931 has
not been included in any previous comparative proteomic or genomic study of BCG strains. Characterisation
of BCG Mexico 1931 will permit again its use for BCG
vaccine production in Mexico. This BCG strain will be
used to develop a new recombinant BCG vaccine.
Recently, Hayashi et al. described the biochemical characteristics of 14 BCG strains (including a BCG Mexico
substrain), as well as M. bovis, M. tuberculosis, M.
avium and M. smegmatis strains. Interestingly, BCG
Mexico presented a biochemical profile more similar to
that of M. bovis than any other BCG strain [20].

Historical records show that the Pasteur Institute sent
several shipments of BCG strains to Mexico between
1926 and 1927 (Pasteur Institute records, personal communication). In 1928, small-scale production of BCG
vaccine began in Mexico. In 1949, a BCG vaccine production laboratory was opened, and the vaccine was distributed throughout Mexico and Latin America [21-23].
Since 1931, the BCG Mexico substrain has been maintained by the Laboratorios de Biológicos y Reactivos de
Mexico, a state-owned company that produces biological
agents in Mexico. The BCG Mexico substrain was used
as the vaccine seed for many years [24]. In 1970, this
strain was replaced with the BCG Danish 1331 strain
for vaccine production [25]. In 1998, BCG vaccine production ended in Mexico; since then, the country has
depended on imported vaccine. These changes in vaccine production have caused confusion regarding the
identity of BCG Mexico. For this reason, we characterised three representative strains used for BCG vaccine
production in Mexico, which are designated BCG Mexico 1931, 1988 and 1997 according to the production
period in which they were used. In this report, we
describe the genomic and proteomic features of BCG
Mexico 1931.

Results and Discussion
RD and DU Profile of BCG Mexico strains

Our RD and DU profile analysis of BCG Mexico 1931
demonstrated the presence of the RD8, RD14, RD16
and RD Danish/Glaxo regions and the absence of the
RD1, RD2 and N-RD18 regions, as well as a single copy
of the insertion sequence IS6110. These properties are
similar to those observed for BCG Phipps and BCG Tice
(Table 1). In contrast, BCG Mexico 1988 and BCG
Mexico 1997 exhibited identical RD and DU profiles,
with the RD1, RD2 and RD Danish/Glaxo regions and
one copy of IS6110 missing (Table 1). This profile is
identical to that of BCG Danish. The absence of the RD
Danish/Glaxo region, which is specific to BCG Danish,
in BCG Mexico 1988 and 1997 confirms this result and
is consistent with historical records indicating that BCG
vaccine production in Mexico utilised the BCG Danish
1331 strain beginning in 1970.
The amplification pattern of DU regions in BCG Mexico 1931 indicated duplication of DU2-IV, in contrast to
those of BCG Mexico 1988 and BCG Mexico 1997,
which showed duplication of DU2-III (Table 1). These
differences in RDs and DUs confirm that BCG Mexico
1931 is a different strain from BCG Mexico 1988 and
1997, which are related to BCG Danish.
The above results and subsequent sequencing of the
BCG Mexico 1931 genome place this strain in DU2
group IV within the genealogy of BCG strains (Figure
1). These results differ from findings of previous studies

in which BCG Mexico was placed in DU2 group III as a
strain derived from BCG Danish, which is an erroneous
result that can be attributed to the different BCG vaccine production periods in Mexico [17,26].
Genome Sequence of BCG Mexico 1931

Mycobacterium bovis BCG Mexico 1931 has a circular
chromosome of 4,350,386 bp with an overall G+C content of 65.7% [GenBank: CP002095]. The genome contains 3,904 genes that encode proteins (CDS), three
genes that encode rRNAs and 45 genes that encode
tRNAs. Additionally, 29 possible pseudogenes have been
identified (Figure 2). The BCG Mexico 1931 genome is
20 Kb smaller than those of BCG Pasteur 1173P2

Page 4 of 12

(4,374,522 bp) and BCG Tokyo 172 (4,371,711 bp). The
differences between BCG Mexico 1931 and BCG Pasteur
are due to lack of DU1, the presence of specific deletions and the presence of RD14 in BCG Mexico 1931.
With respect to BCG Tokyo 172, the difference in genome size can be explained by the loss of RD2, N-RD18
and one copy of insertion sequence IS6110 as well as by
differences in the size of DU2 (Figure 1).
The genome of BCG Mexico 1931 contains fewer
genes (3,904) than those of BCG Pasteur (3,954) and
BCG Tokyo (4,033) [9,27]. This variation is due to the
presence of different RDs in each strain and to differences in the criteria used for annotation of hypothetical
proteins not previously described in other BCG strains

but annotated in M. tuberculosis strains (GenBank
database).
A comparison of the BCG Mexico 1931 genome
sequence with those of BCG Pasteur and BCG Tokyo
revealed 95 SNPs and three new RD regions, which
were designated RDMex01 (53 bp), RDMex02 (655 bp)
and RDMex03 (2,847 bp). These regions were deleted in
the BCG Mexico 1931 sequence based on alignment
with the BCG Pasteur and BCG Tokyo sequences. The
deletions were confirmed by alignment with the M.
tuberculosis and M. bovis sequences. These new RD
regions led to the loss of three genes [BCG3923,
BCG3924 and BCG3925c (whiB6)] and the partial deletion of two genes [(BCG3926 and BCG3889 (fadD23)]
in BCG Mexico 1931 (Table 2). Interestingly, a PCR
screen of these regions in nine BCG strains (Birkhaug,
Connaught, Danish, Frappier, Moreau, Phipps, Tice,
Tokyo and Sweden) showed that the RDMex02 and
RDMex03 regions have been lost only in BCG Mexico
1931 and can therefore be used as molecular markers
for this strain.
RDMex01 is an intergenic deletion located between
the BCG0767 (rpsN1) and BCG0768 (rpsH) genes, which
encode two subunits of the 30S ribosomal protein. The
biological effect of this deletion is unknown.
RDMex02 is associated with deletion of 218 aa from
BCG3889 (fadD23), affecting a conserved region of the
protein that includes two transmembrane domains. This
gene encodes a probable fatty-acyl CoA ligase involved
in lipid degradation. Lynett et al. have reported that this
protein is involved in sulpholipid production and that
disruption of the gene results in increased association
between bacteria and macrophages [28]. Molina et al.
found that BCG Mexico 1931 associates more strongly
with macrophages (THP-1) compared to BCG Danish,
BCG Moreau, BCG Phipps and BCG Tokyo172 [29].
Finally, RDMex03 was the largest deletion found in
the BCG Mexico 1931 genome. It affected four genes:
three genes encoding hypothetical proteins (BCG3923,
BCG3924 and BCG3926) and another gene encoding a
putative transcriptional regulator [BCG3925c (whiB6)]
belonging to the WhiB protein family (1-7). This family
has been proposed to form part of a new redox system

in M. tuberculosis [30]. Interestingly, this deletion is
situated in the extended RD1 region.
The new RDs described in BCG Mexico 1931 may
contribute to understanding of the phenotypic differences between BCG Mexico 1931 and other BCG
strains.
Our SNP analysis indicated the presence of 33 SNPs
in BCG Mexico 1931 compared to BCG Pasteur and 77
SNPs in BCG Mexico 1931 compared to BCG Tokyo.
Among these SNPs, at least 23 have been reported in
two previous studies [27,31]. Additionally, in agreement
with the SNP-based phylogeny constructed by García
Pelayo et al., BCG Mexico 1931 was grouped with BCG
Tice in our analysis [31].
We found a total of 37 SNPs representing nonsynonymous mutations (nsSNPs), leading to amino acid substitutions (Tables 3 and 4). Four SNPs in this group
were specific to BCG Mexico 1931 [BCGMEX_0506c,
BCGMEX_1957, BCGMEX_2390 and BCG3741
(ponA2)]. On the basis of functional classes, the genes
containing nsSNPs encoded hypothetical proteins (19%),
proteins involved in intermediary metabolism and
respiration (16%), proteins related to lipid metabolism
(16%) and PE/PPE family proteins (16%) (Figure 3).
We found SNPs within BCG0510c (pcaA), BCG0532
(regX3), BCG0692c (mma3), BCG0484c (sigK) and
BCG3734 (Table 3). The SNPs in the last three genes
have been described in previous studies [7,31]. The SNP
found in BCG0692c (mma3) causes an amino acid
change with a concomitant loss of methoxymycolates in
BCG strains obtained from the Pasteur Institute after
1927 [18]. This result is consistent with the findings of
Hayashi et al., who described the absence of these acids
in BCG Mexico 1931 [26]. An SNP in the start codon of
BCG0484c (sigK) is responsible for low expression of
MPB70 and MPB83 in late BCG strains, including BCG
Mexico 1931 [32]. Moreover, mutations in BCG3734, a
CRP homologue global regulator, have been described
as specific to BCG and are responsible for increased
binding of CRP to its target DNA [33]. Mutations in
Rv0491 (regX3) and Rv0470c (pcaA) have been implicated in the virulence of M. tuberculosis. The pcaA gene
encodes a mycolic acid cyclopropane synthetase and is

important for growth, persistence in macrophages and
proinflammatory activity [34,35]. Additionally, regX3 is
part of a two-component system regulated by Pi
(SenX3-RegX3) that is involved in the virulence of M.
tuberculosis [36,37].
Interestingly, a specific nsSNP from BCG Mexico 1931
causes an amino acid change in BCG3741 (ponA2).
Mutations in this gene have been associated with
increased sensitivity to heat shock (24 h at 45°C) and
exposure to H2O2 compared to wild-type M. tuberculosis. Additionally, a ponA2 mutant was found to exhibit
lower survival in mice compared to wild-type M. tuberculosis [38].
We also identified six SNPs in PE_PGRS4, PPE22,
PE_PGRS41, PPE50 and PE_PGRS43b (Tables 3 and 4).
These genes encode PE/PPE family proteins, which may
play a role in the evasion of host immune responses,
possibly via antigenic variation of mycobacteria [39]. In
previous studies, it has been shown that the PPE22 protein elicits B cell responses, while PPE50 is required for
mycobacterial growth in vitro [39,40]. Furthermore, we
determined that PE_PGRS54 (6,285 bp) and
PPE_PGRS55 (5,433 bp) correspond to a longer product
in BCG Mexico compared with homologous sequences
only for BCG Tokyo (6,153 and 5,088 bp, respectively).
These results are consistent with data previously
described [27]. Importantly, the functional implications
of these size variations remain unknown.
Comparison of BCG proteomes

The protein contents of the cell fractions from four
BCG substrains were analysed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) using bacteria
in mid-logarithmic phase. A total of 812, 794, 791 and
701 spots were visualised for BCG Mexico 1931, BCG
Danish, BCG Phipps and BCG Tokyo, respectively

Figure 4 Representative 2D-PAGE image for BCG Mexico and comparison with the proteomes of BCG Danish, Phipps and Tokyo. One
hundred micrograms of cellular protein were loaded onto IPG strips (pH 4-7) for isoelectrofocusing at 52,000 VH and run on sodium dodecyl
sulphate (SDS) 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were silver-stained and analysed using PDQuest 2D Analysis V8.0 (Bio-Rad). Green triangles
indicate spots common to all strains; red squares mark spots unique to BCG Mexico. *Percentage calculated based on the number of spots in

(Figure 4), with high reproducibility and low variation
between duplicate experiments (0.4%). A comparative
analysis of the proteomes of these BCG strains revealed
185 spots common to all strains and 136 that were
unique to BCG Mexico 1931. Additionally, this analysis
showed higher percentages of spots in common between
BCG Mexico 1931 and BCG Danish (62%) or BCG
Phipps (61%) than between BCG Mexico 1931 and BCG
Tokyo (48%) (Figure 4).
Previous studies have shown that BCG strains (Connaught, Tice, Danish and Phipps) differ in their protein profiles [41-43]. Here, we observed that late
strains (BCG Mexico 1931, Danish and Phipps) had a
greater number of proteins in common compared to
the early strain we studied (BCG Tokyo). This difference can be explained by mutations in transcriptional
regulators such as BCG3734 (crp) and BCG0484c
(sigK) in late BCGs. Furthermore, the proteins unique
to BCG Mexico 1931 may be useful for characterising
this strain and explaining the causes of the observed
phenotypic differences compared to other BCG
strains.

Characterisation of the immune response by immune
blotting

To identify immunogenic proteins in BCG Mexico 1931,
we performed an immune blotting analysis. We detected
39 reactive spots in the immune proteome (Figure 5A
and Additional file 1: Table S1). The largest numbers of
reactive spots were obtained when using serum from
subjects with active TB (16) or positive tuberculin skin
test results (PPD+) (14); 12 of these spots were unique
to each serum type (Figure 5B). This result indicates
high variability in the proteins recognised by each type
of serum. We identified 37 proteins by sequencing
(Additional file 1: Table S1), the majority of which (17;
47%) corresponded to intermediary metabolism and
respiration proteins (Figure 5C). Among the identified
proteins, some have been previously described as virulence proteins in different strains of M. tuberculosis:
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pckA), isocitrate
lyase (icl), 3-oxoacyl synthase II (kasA), groEL, TB27.3,
the 85A and 85C antigens, alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase (ahpC) and heat shock protein HspX [44-47].
Rodriguez-Alvarez et al. have reported that GroEL and

Figure 5 Immunogenic proteins identified in BCG Mexico. A total of 37 immunogenic proteins were identified. Spots circled in red, green,
dark blue and light blue represent proteins reactive to sera from subjects with active pulmonary tuberculosis, NTM mycobacterioses, PPD+ and
PPD-, respectively, while the red, orange and green squares represent proteins shared between TB-MNT, TB-PPD+ and TB-PPD- sera, respectively.

AhpC are over-expressed in BCG Phipps [42]. To our
knowledge, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, isocitrate lyase, 3-oxoacyl synthase II and AhpC are
described as antigenic proteins for the first time in this
report.

Conclusions
This study represents the first genomic and proteomic
characterisation of BCG Mexico 1931. This substrain
was used for BCG vaccine production in Mexico until
1970 and can now be used again for vaccine production
and as a vector for the design of new second-generation
vaccines against tuberculosis.
Initially, we determined the RD profiles of three BCG
substrains representing different stages of vaccine production in Mexico. The RD profiles show that BCG

Mexico 1931 is different from BCG Mexico 1988 and
1997, which have the same profile as BCG Danish.
These dates are consistent with historical records, which
indicate that BCG vaccine was produced in Mexico
from the BCG Danish strain after 1970.
Based on these results, the BCG Mexico 1931 substrain was used for genomic and proteomic characterisation. According to the RD profiles and genome
sequence of BCG Mexico 1931, this substrain belongs to
DU2 group IV within the genealogy of BCG vaccines.
Genetic studies of BCG substrains have provided new
knowledge about the genes involved in the phenotypic
differences observed for these strains (for example
mma3, fadD26, ppsA, phoP and whiB3), making it possible to elucidate the basis of phenotypic variation
between them. The results of this investigation and

Orduña et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:493
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/493

previously published studies show that the genes with
the largest numbers of mutations are related to twocomponent systems and transport (esX, senX3-regX3,
phoP-phoR), regulatory proteins (whiB family, crp, trcR)
and lipid metabolism (fadD, ppsA). Interestingly, most
of these mutations may be involved in the phenotypic
differences observed between BCG substrains. For example, the lack of production of some membrane lipids
(PDIMs) in BCG Moreau is caused by deletions in
BCG2952 (fadD26) and BCG2953 (ppsA) [48]. In this
study, we identified specific regions in BCG Mexico
1931 that may be directly involved in the phenotypic
characteristics of this strain and designated them
RDMex02 and RDMex03. These regions affect the proteins FadD23 and WhiB6, which are related to the interaction between the bacteria and macrophages. In
addition, we have identified SNPs in genes previously
determined to be involved in the virulence of Mycobacterium strains. Further studies are needed to establish
the contributions of these mutations and to assess the
roles of the newly identified antigenic proteins in the
BCG Mexico 1931 phenotype.

Methods
Bacterial strains and DNA isolation

Mycobacterium bovis BCG substrains were grown in
Sauton medium for 15 days at 37°C, harvested by centrifugation and stored at -70°C until use. The Birkhaug,
Connaught, Danish 1331, Frappier, Moreau, Phipps,
Tice and Sweden BCG strains were kindly provided by
M. Behr (McGill University Health Centre, Canada) and
BCG Tokyo 172 was provided by M. Macías (Instituto
Nacional de Pediatría, México). The Mexican Instituto
Nacional de Higiene provided the BCG Mexico 1931,
1988 and 1997 substrains. Genomic DNA was extracted
by the phenol/chloroform method following established
protocols [49].
Identification of regions of difference (RD) and tandem
duplications (DU) by PCR

The RD regions of the BCG Mexico substrains were
profiled by multiplex PCR using primer sequences and
conditions reported by the WHO (personal communication) and by Bedwell et al. [50]. These primers amplify
the RD1 (ET1, ET2, ET3), RD2 (RD2l, RD2r), RD8
(RD8l, RD8r), RD14 (RD14l, RD14r), RD16 (RD16l,
RD16r), N-RD18 (RD18L, RD18R, RD18wtR) and RD
Danish/Glaxo (RD-D/G L, RD-D/G R) regions and an
IS6110 insertion sequence (IS6110L, IS6110R, RD2
wtR). Similarly, a DU profile was obtained by PCR using
primer sequences reported by Brosch et al. [9]. PCR
amplification of the DU regions was performed in a
volume of 30 μL with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50
mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 20 pmol of

Page 9 of 12

each primer, 1 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen, USA) and 50 ng of template DNA. The
thermal profile consisted of one cycle at 94°C (5 min);
35 cycles at 94°C (1 min), 55°C (1 min) and 72°C (1
min); and one cycle at 72°C (5 min). Amplification products were analysed by horizontal electrophoresis on 3%
(w/v) agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.
BCG Mexico 1931 genome sequencing

The genome of M. bovis BCG Mexico 1931 was
sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing, which was performed by the Sequencing Unit of CINVESTAV, Irapuato, Mexico. Additionally, a fosmid library with
inserts of approximately 40 kb was constructed using
the CopyControl™ pCCFOS™ system (Epicentre Technologies, USA), and the fos-end sequences of 250 clones
were determined using the Sanger method (3730xl DNA
Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, USA). Draft assemblies
were based on 623,000 reads (36× coverage), and the
Phred/Phrap/Consed software package was employed
for sequence assembly and quality assessment [51] using
the BCG Pasteur 1173P2 sequence as a reference [GenBank: AM408590]. To close gaps and resolve duplicated
regions, the complete sequences of three fosmids
(approximately 40 kb) and 110 PCR end reads were
obtained. Annotation was performed using the RAST
Server [52,53], Artemis [54,55] and BCGList [56].
BCG Mexico 1931 genome sequence analysis

The BCG Pasteur 1173P2, BCG Tokyo 172 [GenBank:
AP010918] and BCG Mexico sequences were compared
using Consed software [51] and the Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool (BLAST) [57]. The presence of
the new regions of difference found in BCG Mexico
1931 (RDMex01, RDMex02 and RDMex03) in the Birkhaug, Connaught, Danish 1331, Frappier, Moreau,
Phipps, Tice, Tokyo 172 and Sweden BCG strains was
determined by PCR screening. The primer pairs used
were 5’-GCCCAAACAGTTCGACGG-3’ and 5’-CCAGACATATGCGAGGAC-3’ for RDMex01; 5’-GCGATAATGGGCGATGTCG-3’ and 5’-CCGCGGTTGT
TGAGTTCG-3’ for RDMex02; and 5’-GCAGCAGTGAACGCTTGG-3’, 5’-CAGTGGAGCTGAAGGCAG-3’
and 5’-GTTGCTTGGACGGCAATCG-3’ for RDMex03.
PCR amplifications were performed in a volume of 30
μL with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.5
mM MgCl2 , 0.1 mM dNTPs, 20 pmol of each primer,
0.4 U Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, USA)
and 20 ng of template DNA. The thermal profile consisted of one cycle at 94°C (5 min); 35 cycles at 94°C (1
min), 55°C (1 min) and 72°C (1 min); and one cycle at
72°C (5 min). Amplification products were analysed by
horizontal electrophoresis on 3% (w/v) agarose gels
stained with ethidium bromide.

BCG Mexico 1931 proteome

M. bovis BCG Danish, BCG Mexico 1931, BCG Phipps
and BCG Tokyo strains were grown in Middlebrook
7H9 medium (pH 7.2) for eight days at 37°C with shaking, harvested by centrifugation, washed and suspended
in sterile water for lysis. Cellular proteins were obtained
by sonication of mycobacteria (Ultrasonic Processor,
Cole Parmer Corporation, USA) in the presence of a
protease inhibitor (PMSF, 20 mM) at 4°C. The extracted
proteins were quantified using a Bradford assay. For 2DPAGE, approximately 100 mg of protein was solubilised,
denatured, reduced in sample buffer [4% CHAPS, 2 M
urea, 70 mM l-dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.001% bromophenol blue, and 0.1% 3-10 ampholyte] and used to rehydrate 11-cm pH 4-7 IPG strips (ReadyStrip™, IPG
strips, Bio-Rad). Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on a Multiphor II system (Amersham Biosciences, England) until reaching 52,000 VH at 17°C. The
strips were equilibrated twice in a solution containing
4% urea, 30% glycerol (v/v), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8),
2% SDS (w/v), and 0.002% bromophenol blue supplemented with 90 mM DTT for the first incubation (15
minutes) and 250 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for the second incubation (15 minutes). Second-dimension electrophoresis was performed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel
(Hoeffer SE-600, Amersham Biosciences, England) for
approximately five hours with a voltage gradient of 50200 V. Once fixed, the proteins were silver-stained, and
gel images were captured in a digital format (Molecular
Imager GS-800TM Calibrated Densitometer, Bio-Rad,
USA). Gel analysis was performed using the program 2D PDQuest Advance V.8.0 (Bio-Rad, USA). Duplicate
gels with proteins obtained from independent cultures
were included in the analysis. A master image gel was
created using three replicates of each experiment and
was used for comparison [42].
Immune blotting

To identify antigenic proteins in BCG Mexico 1931, we
conducted an immune blot analysis from the 2D-PAGE
gels. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare,
England) using a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer system (Bio-Rad, USA) for 1 h at 10 V. The membranes
were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing
0.05% Tween-20 and 5% skim milk at 4°C overnight.
The membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with sera from subjects with PPD+, PPD-,
pulmonary TB or mycobacterioses caused by NTMs.
The membranes were incubated with selected sera from
each group having the highest IgG2 titres against each
of the groups described above (data not shown). Then
membranes were subsequently incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG2

Page 10 of 12

antibody (1:5000; Zymed, Invitrogen, USA) for 1 h at
room temperature. Immune detection was accomplished
using the Inmobilon Western System (Millipore Co,
USA). Chemiluminescence signals were measured using
the Genius Plus system (TECAN, Switzerland).
Protein sequencing

Reactive proteins were sequenced using a 3200 QTRAP
hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (3200 QTRAP,
Applied Biosystems, USA) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source (NanoSpray II) and a MicroIonSpray
II head. Proteins were identified based on their MS/MS
spectra datasets using the MASCOT search algorithm
(Version 1.6b9, Matrix Science, London, UK). A BLAST
search was conducted using the M. tuberculosis complex
subset of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant database (NCBI
nr20070623).
