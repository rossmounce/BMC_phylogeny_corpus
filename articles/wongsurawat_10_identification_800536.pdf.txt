Abstract
Background: Poor reproductive maturation of the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) in captivity is one of the
serious threats to sustainability of the shrimp farming industry. Understanding molecular mechanisms governing
reproductive maturation processes requires the fundamental knowledge of integrated expression profiles in gonads
of this economically important species. In P. monodon, a non-model species for which the genome sequence is
not available, expressed sequence tag (EST) and cDNA microarray analyses can help reveal important transcripts
relevant to reproduction and facilitate functional characterization of transcripts with important roles in male
reproductive development and maturation.
Results: In this study, a conventional testis EST library was exploited to reveal novel transcripts. A total of 4,803
ESTs were unidirectionally sequenced and analyzed in silico using a customizable data analysis package, ESTplus.
After sequence assembly, 2,702 unique sequences comprised of 424 contigs and 2,278 singletons were identified;
of these, 1,133 sequences are homologous to genes with known functions. The sequences were further
characterized according to gene ontology categories (41% biological process, 24% molecular function, 35% cellular
component). Through comparison with EST libraries of other tissues of P. monodon, 1,579 transcripts found only in
the testis cDNA library were identified. A total of 621 ESTs have not been identified in penaeid shrimp.
Furthermore, cDNA microarray analysis revealed several ESTs homologous to testis-relevant genes were more
preferentially expressed in testis than in ovary. Representatives of these transcripts, homologs of saposin (PmSap)
and Dmc1 (PmDmc1), were further characterized by RACE-PCR. The more abundant expression levels in testis than
ovary of PmSap and PmDmc1 were verified by quantitative real-time PCR in juveniles and wild broodstock of P.
monodon.
Conclusions: Without a genome sequence, a combination of EST analysis and high-throughput cDNA microarray
technology can be a useful integrated tool as an initial step towards the identification of transcripts with important
biological functions. Identification and expression analysis of saposin and Dmc1 homologs demonstrate the power
of these methods for characterizing functionally important genes in P. monodon.

Background
The black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) is an aquatic
animal of central importance as it brings an annual
income of over one billion USD in Thailand [1]. However, domestication of the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus
monodon) is impeded by poor reproductive maturation of
both male and female brooders in captivity. Ovarian
development of penaeid shrimp is induced by a unilateral
eyestalk ablation technique; however, the technique does
not have the same effect in male reproductive maturation
[2]. No molecular markers pinpointing the maturation
stage of testis or sperm quality in penaeid shrimp are
currently known. Domesticated male P. monodon yields
lower fertilization rates of zygotes and lower survival
rates of offspring than wild male P. monodon [3]. However, the role of genes implicated in the regulation of
spermatogenesis and their patterns of expression in
penaeid shrimp are still poorly understood.
To gain insight on the molecular mechanisms governing the male reproduction process of this important species, EST libraries from P. monodon broodstock testis
were previously constructed for gene discovery [4,5]. A
testis-specific transcript, PMTST1 (P. monodon testisspecific transcript 1), was identified, and expression
levels of 51 additional putative testis-specific genes in
cultured and wild P. monodon were examined by
reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR, semiquantitative RTPCR, and real-time RT-PCR [5]. Nevertheless, more
exhaustive gene discovery is needed to unravel testisrelevant genes and their possible functions.
In this study, a total of 4,803 ESTs from the testis
library were sequenced and analyzed in silico using a
customizable data analysis package, ESTplus [6]. Many
transcripts known to be relevant to testicular development in other organisms were identified. A total of
1,076 of these testis EST sequences were included in the
construction of a new microarray. Gene expression profiles of testis were simultaneously compared to those of
ovary in both juveniles and broodstock. Among transcripts with differential expression levels, saposin and
Dmc1 homologs were further examined by quantitative
real-time PCR. Furthermore, full-length sequences of
saposin and Dmc1 cDNAs were obtained by RACE-PCR.
Results and Discussion
Characteristics and functional annotation of testis ESTs of
P. monodon

Previously, we constructed suppression subtractive
hybridization (SSH) libraries comparing cDNA in testis
of wild P. monodon broodstock to juveniles. A total of
365 clones were sequenced from these libraries [4]. In
addition, we established a high quality conventional
cDNA library from testis of wild P. monodon broodstock

Page 2 of 15

and preliminarily sequenced 896 clones [5]. In this
study, additional ESTs were sequenced from the conventional cDNA library and a total of 4,803 high quality
EST sequences were obtained (Figure 1A). Results of the
in silico analysis are summarized in Figure 2. From
assembling the testis EST sequences, 2,702 unique
sequences comprising of 424 contigs and 2,278 singletons with an average size of 1,130 bp and 584 bp,
respectively, were found. When compared with the
NCBI nucleotide collection (nr/nt) database using
BlastN, 1,181 sequences of the 2,702 unique sequences
were found to be homologs of previously reported
sequences. Similarly, when the unique EST sequences
were compared with the NCBI non-redundant protein
sequence database using BlastX, 1,147 (42%) sequences
were homologs of previously reported sequences,
whereas the remainder (1,555 sequences, 58%) were
unknown (novel) transcripts. Matched sequences (1,147)
from the BlastX analysis were further categorized by
Blast2GO for their potential functions. 1,133 (99%) of
these sequences were similar to genes with putative
functions (Figure 2A).
E-values of most sequences ranged between 1e-30 to
1e-10 (396 sequences accounting for 34% of overall contigs, Figure 3C). The most frequently matched transcripts found were Arthropoda (753 sequences, 66%) at
the phylum level and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (90 sequences) at the species level (Table 1).
This could be due to the limited availability of P. monodon sequence data in comparison to that of T. castaneum whose genome was completely sequenced and
published in 2008 [7].
The 2,702 unique sequences were searched using
BlastN against the P. monodon EST data (PmDB: http://
pmonodon.biotec.or.th) excluding previously identified
testis EST libraries (Figure 2B). A total of 1,579
sequences did not match ESTs from other tissues of
P. monodon making them potential testis-specific transcripts or rare transcripts in other shrimp tissues. Examples of genes in this group relevant to testicular
development are phospholipase A2, mago nashi proliferation-associated protein, actin-depolymerizing factor and
profilin. Phospholipase A2 is required for the acrosome
reaction (AR), a special exocytotic process promoted by
signal transduction pathways, and capacitation, a process
for maturation of spermatozoa [8,9]. Protein mago nashi
originally identified in Drosophila is essential for germplasm assembly [10]. Actin polymerization is important
for a wide range of cellular functions and properties,
including cell division, cell motility, cell polarity and cellcell contacts. Profilins are widely expressed small actinbinding proteins which are functionally involved in the
regulation of actin dynamics [11,12]. On the other hand,

cofilin/actin-depolymerizing protein is an important factor in spermatogenesis which disassembles actin filaments
when unphosphorylated [13].
To reveal novel transcripts which are not found in
other Penaeidae ESTs, the testis ESTs from this study
were also compared to Penaeid ESTs (207,852 sequences,
using a keyword of “Penaeidae”) from the NCBI database
(Figure 2C). A total of 2,081 (77%) sequences were
homologous to those from the NCBI’s penaeid shrimp
database. 621 newly identified transcripts (23%) were
found, 475 of which (18%) have not been reported in the
PmDB database.
Most of the obtained EST sequences ranged from 2011,100 bp in length (Figure 3A). Apart from a large number
of singletons (2,278 unique sequences, 84% of discovered

sequences), most of the contigs (187 contigs, 7%) were
assembled from two ESTs and only 100 contigs (4%) were
deduced from greater than five ESTs. Only three contigs;
cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI), elongation factor 1alpha (EF-1a), and cell division cycle 2 (cdc2) were
assembled from over 50 sequences (Figure 3B). EF-1a
functions in protein synthesis by promoting the binding of
aminoacyl tRNA to the 80 S ribosome, and it is one of the
most abundant soluble proteins in eukaryotes [14]. Mitochondrial COI has been found to be more highly
expressed in well differentiated cells with high activity
than in moderately and poorly differentiated cells [15,16].
Cdc2 is the key regulator of the eukaryotic cell cycle, and
its activity is controlled by interaction with other proteins
such as cyclin A and cyclin B1 [17]. Mitotic cyclins and

cdc2 are involved in capacitation and/or acrosome reaction of sperm [18]. During the meiotic cell cycle, the
G2/M phase transition is controlled by the maturation
promoting factor (MPF), a complex of cdc2 (cdk1) and
cyclin B1 [19]. High redundancies of these transcripts in
the ESTs are consistent with their essential cellular functions during spermatogenesis and testicular development.
The assembled EST sequences with similarity to the
nr/nt database (1,147 from 2,702 sequences; Figure 2A)
were further categorized according to Gene Ontology
(Figure 4). The majority of annotated ESTs (41% of
1,147 sequences) were placed in the Gene Ontology
functional category of “biological processes”. The
remaining annotated ESTs were placed in the “cellular
components” (35% of 1,147 sequences) and “molecular
function” (24% of 1,147 sequences) categories. Compared to the EST sequences from the P. monodon EST
database, the distribution for the three main categories
was similar (42%, 31%, and 27% for biological processes,
cellular components and molecular function,
respectively).
In the biological process category, ESTs involved in
the cellular process were predominant (30% of examined

ESTs), followed by those involved in the metabolic process (25% of examined ESTs). In the cellular component
category, EST functionally involved in the cell (39% of
examined ESTs) predominated followed by those functionally displayed in the organelles (30% of examined
ESTs) and macromolecular complex (21% of examined
ESTs). In the molecular function category, ESTs displaying binding function (43% of examined ESTs) predominated followed by those displaying catalytic activity (28%
of examined ESTs).
The reproduction group, including mago-nashi proliferation-associated protein, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
E2, and small ubiquitin-related modifier precursor
(SUMO), contributes ~2% of the total number of contigs. This discovery rate is comparable to that identified
from the conventional ovarian cDNA library of P. monodon [20].
The transcripts found in the reproduction group exhibit relevant functions to male reproduction. For
instance, SUMO plays an important role in diverse
reproductive functions such as spermatogenesis and
modulation of steroid receptor activity [21]. In the
sumoylation pathway, SUMO is transferred to lysine

(GSI = 0.45 ± 0.12, N = 5) but comparable to that of
stage III (GSI = 0.57 ± 0.006, N = 5) of testis [23]. The
analysis of baseline information acquired by this study
addresses the paucity of data and provides a better
understanding of reproductive maturation in male
P. monodon.

residues of the protein substrates through the thioester
cascade of ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 and ubiquitin
conjugating enzyme E2 (UBE2), and SUMO ligase E3
[22]. In the kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus,
UBE2 was expressed at a higher level in testis than in
ovary. The expression at stage I (GSI = 0.33 ± 0.004,
N = 5) was significantly lower than that of stage II

To address the functional involvement of various genes
during reproductive development and maturation in
P. monodon, we previously constructed a cDNA microarray, ReproArrayGTS, and carried out a high-throughput
expression analysis of genes in ovary of wild P. monodon
[24]. A second generation cDNA microarray was
recently fabricated using 12 EST libraries from different
tissues to cover as many and as diverse transcripts as
possible. Expression levels of EST transcripts with gene
ontology related to reproductive functions and those
previously not reported in the NCBI EST penaeid
shrimp database (unique genes) were investigated by
using this new microarray to compare ovary and testis
transcripts in both juvenile and broodstock shrimp
(Figure 5). The expression levels from the microarray
experiments were analyzed, as described in the Methods
section, to obtain transcripts potentially relevant to testicular development.
Of 5,568 transcripts on the microarray, 2,133 transcripts were present in at least 8 of the 9 microarrays
and had relative expression levels greater than the median value ± 1SD in at least one microarray (Figure 5A).
Within this subset, 244 transcripts with higher abundance (3 fold) in ovary than testis and 239 transcripts
with higher abundance (3 fold) in testis than ovary were
identified (Figure 5B). From these differentially
expressed genes, there were transcripts whose putative
functions are possibly involved in testicular development
(Figure 5C).
When examining the library sources of transcripts
more abundantly expressed in ovaries, we found 51%
were from the ovary, 22% from testis, 9% from hemocyte
and heart each, 8% from gill, 1% from lymphoid organ
and <1% from the remaining tissues (Figure 5D). These
transcripts included peritrophin (also called cortical rod
protein, CRP), thrombospondin (TSP) and nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP). In the kuruma shrimp,
CRP and TSP are first scattered throughout the cytoplasm of oocytes and are subsequently localized in cortical rods during the cortical rod formation [25]. NASP is
a histone-binding protein. Overexpression of NASP in
mice testis affects progression of cell proliferation
through the cell cycle [26,27]. Expression analysis of
these genes [20,28] and dolichyl diphosphooligocharide
protein glycotransferase, asparagenyl tRNA synthetase and

3-oxoacid CoA transferase by semiquantitative RT-PCR
(S. Klinbunga, unpublished data) revealed greater expression levels in ovary than testis of wild P. monodon broodstock. This validated the accuracy of the microarray
analysis for gene expression analysis in P. monodon.
Transcripts with higher expression in testis were
found mainly from the testis EST library (65%), 8% from
heart, 7% from hemocyte, 5% from gill, 3% from ovary,
2% from hepatopancreas, 1% from intestine, and 1.5%
from the rest (Figure 5E). Examples of these transcripts
include argonaute 1, dynactin 5, and orphan 2. Argonaute proteins are key mediators for RNA silencing
mechanisms [29]. Cytoplasmic dynactin forms a complex with dynein and plays a functional role in spermatid growth in Drosophila [30].
Based on the distribution of library sources where the
differentially expressed transcripts came from, it is evident that we can obtain additional information by
including cDNA probes from various EST libraries
beyond testis and ovary libraries. This more comprehensive coverage of microarray probes demonstrates the
usefulness of the present microarray version in gene
expression analysis of P. monodon.

Within the 1,076 cDNA spots from testis ESTs that
were fabricated onto the present version of cDNA
microarrays, there were 169 transcripts with greater
abundance in testis than ovary. Of these transcripts
saposin-related protein and Dmc1 were consistently
more abundant in testis than in ovary for both juvenile
and broodstock comparisons. Moreover, these genes
have previously been reported to be relevant to male
reproduction in other organisms.
In vertebrates, saposins are a group of four small glycoproteins (A, B, C, and D), derived from a common
precursor protein called prosaposin, which is reported
to activate glycosphingolipid hydrolysis [31]. Inactivation
of prosaposin gene resulted in accumulation of lactosylceramide, glucosylceramid, digalactosyl ceramide, sulfactide, ceramide, and globotriaosylceramide in lysosomes.
A prosaposin -/- mouse model demonstrated that the
mice die at day 35-40 after birth due to neurological
defects [32]. The disruption of the prosaposin gene
resulted in a reduction in size and weight: 30% of the
testis, 37% of the epididymis, 75% of the seminal vesicles, and 60% of the prostate glands. Moreover, the
smaller testes from the mutant mice were associated

with reduced spermiogenesis, especially in the late spermatids [33].
Dmc1 (a RAC A-like recombinase) is known to be a
specific factor for meiotic recombination and has been
identified as a gene product specifically expressed during
the early meiotic prophase [21]. Recently, the full-length
Dmc1 cDNA was cloned from the testis of the Japanese
eel (Anguilla japonica). Dmc1 mRNA was abundantly
expressed in the testis and ovary with lower expressed
in the brain. In situ hybridization revealed that Dmc1 of
A. japonica was localized only in the primary spermatocytes implying its important role during the initial stages
of spermatogenesis [34].
Isolation and characterization of the full-length cDNA of
saposin (PmSap) and Dmc1 (PmDmc1) in P. monodon

Based on their differential expression levels seen in the
microarray analysis and their possible involvement in
testicular development from previous studies in other
organisms, saposin-related protein (PmSap) and Dmc1
(PmDmc1) were further characterized by RACE-PCR to
obtain their full-length cDNA sequences.
Full-length PmSap was found to be 3,034 bp in length
containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 2,589 bp
corresponding to a deduced protein of 862 amino acids
with 5′ and 3′UTRs of 116 and 329 bp (excluding the
poly A tail), respectively (Figure 6A, accession number
GU566728). This sequence significantly matched saposin
isoform 1 of Tribolium castaneum (E-value = 1e-171).
The expected molecular weight (MW) and pI of the
deduced Saposin were 95.63 kDa and 4.65, respectively.
Only one contig of saposin-related protein was previously found in ESTs from P. monodon.
Most saposins in vertebrate and invertebrate contain a
signal peptide. Typically, vertebrate prosaposins contain
two conserved SapA domains and four conserved SapB
domains in which six equally placed cysteines are found
in each SapB domain. In contrast, the numbers of saposin
domains in invertebrates is less conserved. The absence
of some of SapA domain produced variants of saposinrelated proteins in various taxa (Figure 6B). Moreover,
there are variable numbers of SapB domains in invertebrates, from 6 domains present in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Homoptera), to up to 9 domains in the
black legged tick Ixodes scapularis (Acari) and Nasonia
vitripennis (Hymenoptera) (Figure 6B). Additional SapB
domains in invertebrate saposins may be explained by
several rounds of tandem internal gene duplication as
previously proposed for the creation of the four domain
saposins in vertebrate [35].
In P. monodon, the deduced PmSap protein contained a
signal peptide with a cleavage site between Ala 21 and
Glu22, two SapA and seven SapB domains (SapA: positions 25-58 and 823-856 with E-value = 2.74e-12 and

Page 9 of 15

1.56e-07, respectively; SapB: positions 68-144, 178-251,
272-346, 437-512, 531-606, 646-721, and 738-813 with
E-value = 1.32e-22, 5.32e-09, 7.28e-16, 4.34e-23, 4.61e-27,
2.63e-22, and 5.83e-15, respectively). Interestingly, six
fixed positions of cysteine were found in each SapB
domain of PmSap but conserved prolines in identical
positions as previously reported in vertebrate saposins
[31] were not found (data not shown). Five predicted glycosylation sites were found in SapB domains 1 (NET,
positions 87-89), 3 (NTT, positions 291-293), 5 (NRT
and NLS, positions 550-552 and 593-595, respectively)
and 6 (NAT, positions 665-667). These predicted SapB
domains significantly matched saposin-related protein
A (E-value = 8e-24; Uniprot No. Q9Y125), BmP109
(E-value = 7.4e-20; Uniprot No. O15997), Saposin
C (E-value = 6.4e-14; Uniprot No. P220097) and BmP109
(E-value = 3.4e-7; Uniprot No. O15997), respectively.
The Dmc1 transcript which was only found in the testis cDNA library of P. monodon was further characterized. The full-length cDNA of PmDmc1 (accession
number EU440762) was found to be 1,661 bp in length
containing an ORF of 1,026 bp encoding a polypeptide
of 341 amino acids. The highest similarity to this transcript was Dmc1 of Ixodes scapularis (E-value = 1e-147).
The predicted pI and MW of the deduced Dmc1 were
5.35 and 37.54 kDa, respectively. The deduced Dmc1
protein contains an HhH motif (positions 46 - 75,
E-value = 2.73e-02) and an AAA domain (positions
118 -308, E-value = 9.73e-06, Figure 7A). The HhH
motif is ~20 amino acid domain present in prokaryotic
and eukaryotic non-sequence-specific DNA binding proteins involved in enzymatic activity. The gene products
within the superfamily of AAA-ATPase are associated
with diverse cellular activity. A bootstrapped neighborjoining tree reflects the relationships between the texa
and the sparse representation of invertebrate sequence
for the Dmc1 protein (Figure 7B).

and domesticated and wild broodstock of P. monodon

Tissue expression analysis is important for providing
basic information needed to prioritize further analysis of
functional genes. Based on the fact that a particular
gene may be expressed in several tissues and possess
different functions, rapid detection of PmSap and
PmDmc1 expression profiles in gonads of P. monodon
by cDNA microarray was further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR.
PmSap was more abundantly expressed in testis
than ovary of P. monodon (P < 0.05, Figure 8). The
expression levels of this transcript were not significantly
different across different stages of either testis (WB-TT,
DB- TT and J-TT) or ovary (WB- TT and J-TT). Dmc1
was less abundantly expressed in testis of domesticated

broodstock than in wild broodstock and cultivated juvenile P. monodon males (P < 0.05, Figure 8). The expression level of this gene was also higher in testis than
ovary (P < 0.05). Therefore, PmSap and PmDmc1 should
play an important role in spermatogenesis (and testicular development) rather than oogenesis (and ovarian
development) of P. monodon. Importantly, lower expression levels of PmDmc1 in domesticated versus wild
broodstock suggest transcriptional levels of this gene
may be used to indicate possible reduced maturation of
reproduction in domesticated P. monodon.
Molecular mechanisms and expression patterns of
genes controlling different steps of sperm maturation
and testicular development should be examined for a
better understanding of P. monodon reproductive
maturation in captivity. The limited number of known
genes expressed in testis of this economically important
species was partially resolved by EST analysis in the

present study. Typically, molecular studies of the hormonal and environmental effectors involving shrimp
reproduction have been limited to one or a few genes.
Here, we illustrate that cDNA microarrays are relatively
simple, reliable and cost-effective for examining
integrated interactions among genes in gonads of
P. monodon. This method can help accelerate studies
on reproductive development and maturation of
P. monodon.

Methods

The testis cDNA library of P. monodon was previously
constructed as described in [5]. The lambda library was
converted to the pBluescript library by in vivo excision.
Colony PCR was performed in a 25 μl reaction mixture
containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, Enhancer solution, 200 mM of each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl 2 ,

(iNtRON Biotechnology). PCR was carried out in a thermocycler consisting of predenaturation at 94°C for 5 min
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s,
annealing at 58°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 3
min. The final extension was carried out at the same
temperature for 7 min. The colony PCR products were
size-fractionated on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized after
ethidium bromide staining. Clones with >400 bp inserts
were selected for further sequencing. Plasmid was
extracted using 96-well plate format (EZ-10 96-well spin
column, Bio Basic). The concentrations of plasmids were
measured using a NanoDrop 8000. Nucleotide sequence
of each clone was obtained using an automated DNA
sequencer. The 4,803 sequences of the testis ESTs from
this study were deposited in NCBI dbEST http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/ with accession numbers
of GW992816-GW996323, HO000142-HO000184,

in Figure 1. Briefly, the sequencing data were analyzed by
SeqClean (removal of the polyA/polyT tail, low-quality
ends, short sequences and those containing cloning vector), RepeatMasker (masking of the sequences when
matched with sequences in the largest repeat library, the
RepBase, that covers a number of organisms including
human, rodent, zebrafish, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis
thaliana) (University of Washington Genome Center,
Seattle; http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker), and CAP3 (assembly and clustering of EST
sequences) [36]. The post-processed sequences were
further annotated for biological activities by comparison
with the NCBI nr database using BlastN (a nucleotidelevel annotation, E-value < 10-5), BlastX (a protein-level
annotation, E-value < 10-5), BLAST2GO (Gene Ontology
prediction of the annotated proteins from BlastX program), and InterProScan (protein signature identification).
To identify ESTs found only in the testis cDNA library
of P. monodon, all newly sequenced contigs and singletons were compared against all sequences (38,429 ESTs)
from the P. monodon database (PmDB: http://pmonodon.biotec.or.th). Moreover, to identify novel transcripts
that have not been previously reported in shrimp, the
sequenced data were also compared against all available
Penaeidae ESTs (207,852 ESTs) from NCBI http://ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov retrieved on 01/11/09.
Microarray analysis for identification of differential
expression transcripts in testis of P. monodon

A cDNA microarray was constructed from various EST
libraries of P. monodon, consisting of 5,568 features
(1,076 unique cDNA features were amplified from testis
EST libraries). The arrays were post-processed according
to [24] immediately before hybridization.
Total RNA was extracted from testis and ovary of
juveniles (4 month-old) and broodstock originating from
the Andaman Sea (west of peninsular Thailand). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treatment
with DNase I (0.15 U/μg total RNA) at 37°C for 30 min.
The first-strand cDNA was synthesized and fluorescently labeled according to [24]. RNA from ovary was
labeled with Cy3 dye as a reference and RNA from testis
was labeled with Cy5 dye. The Cy3- and Cy5-samples
were mixed together and hybridized onto the arrays
overnight. The hybridized slides were washed according
to Corning’s instruction. Nine microarray experiments
were performed and the details of comparison between
gene expression profiles of ovaries and testes are summarized in Table 2.

intensities greater than one standard deviation above the
background intensity were further analyzed. The processed data were normalized within each array by the
scaled print-tip (Lowess) method, and across arrays,
using the Aroma package [37], (available from http://
www.maths.lth.se/help/R/aroma/, run in R project environment http://cran.r-project.org. The microarray data
have been deposited in NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ with GEO accession number GSE19037 at [38]. The average logarithmic
base 2 values of relative intensities between Cy3- and
Cy5- samples (M values) were subjected to hierarchical
clustering analysis and illustrated using the Treeview
software [39]. To identify differential expressed transcripts, only transcripts with relative expression level
changes more than the median value ± 1SD in at least 1
array and present in at least 8 of the 9 arrays were
further considered. A 3-fold change in at least 6 of the 9
arrays was considered as criteria for differential
expression.
Examination of full-length cDNA sequences of Saposin
and Dmc1 by Rapid Amplification of cDNA EndsPolymerase Chain Reaction (RACE-PCR)

Gene-specific primers for RACE-PCR of P. monodon
Saposin and Dmc1 were designed (Table 3). RACEPCRs of Saposin and Dmc1 were carried out using a BD
SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit following the
protocol recommended by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences Clontech). The amplified fragment of each gene
was electrophoretically analyzed and eluted from an
agarose gel before cloning into pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega) and sequencing [40]. The full-length cDNA
was assembled from EST and RACE-PCR products

(hereafter called PmSap and PmDmc1). The sequences
of PmSap and PmDmc1 were deposited with accession
numbers of GU566728 and EU440762, respectively. The
functional domains of the deduced amino acids of these
genes were analyzed using SMART http://smart.emblheidelberg.de/. The pI and molecular weight were estimated using ProtParam http://www.expasy.org/tools/
protparam.html.
Gene expression analysis of PmSap and PmDmc1 by
quantitative real-time PCR

Gene-specific primers were designed for PmSap,
PmDmc1 and Elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1a, Table
3). For construction of the standard curve of each transcript, a plasmid containing the transcript was constructed by cloning PCR product into pGEM-Teasy
vector and transforming the resulting vector into E. coli
JM109. The plasmid was extracted and used as the template for construction of the standard curve by 10-fold
serial dilutions (103 - 109 copy numbers). Real-time PCR
reactions were carried out in a 96-well plate in triplicate.
The expression levels of PmSap and PmDmc1 in testis
from juvenile (J-TT, N = 5), domesticated broodstock
(DB-TT, N = 5), and wild broodstock (WB-TT, N = 5)
and ovary from juvenile (J-OV, N = 4) and wild broodstock (WB-OV, N = 4) were further analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. EF-1a was used as an
internal control. Each primer set was designed to generate 120 to 150 bp amplicons (Table 3). Each reaction
was performed in a 15 μl reaction volume containing 2×
LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche), 50 ng of
first strand cDNA template, and 0.2 μM or 0.4 μM of
each primer pair. Cycling parameters were 95°C for 10
min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, and
72°C for 30 sec. The specificity of PCR products was
confirmed by melting curve analysis by heating at 95°C
for 15 sec, 65°C for 1 min before heating to 97°C and
gradually cooling down to 40°C within 10 sec. Real-time
PCR of each shrimp was tested in duplicate. Relative
expression levels (copy number of the target gene/that
of EF-1a) of different sample groups were statistically
tested by ANOVA followed by Duncan’s new multiple
range test or Tukey test (P < 0.05).
