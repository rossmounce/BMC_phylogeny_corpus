Abstract
Background: At present, six accessible sequences of 16S rDNA from Taylorella equigenitalis (T.
equigenitalis) are available, whose sequence differences occur at a few nucleotide positions. Thus it
is important to determine these sequences from additional strains in other countries, if possible, in
order to clarify any anomalies regarding 16S rDNA sequence heterogeneity. Here, we clone and
sequence the approximate full-length 16S rDNA from additional strains of T. equigenitalis isolated
in Japan, Australia and France and compare these sequences to the existing published sequences.
Results: Clarification of any anomalies regarding 16S rDNA sequence heterogeneity of T.
equigenitalis was carried out. When cloning, sequencing and comparison of the approximate fulllength 16S rDNA from 17 strains of T. equigenitalis isolated in Japan, Australia and France,
nucleotide sequence differences were demonstrated at the six loci in the 1,469 nucleotide
sequence. Moreover, 12 polymorphic sites occurred among 23 sequences of the 16S rDNA,
including the six reference sequences.
Conclusion: High sequence similarity (99.5% or more) was observed throughout, except from
nucleotide positions 138 to 501 where substitutions and deletions were noted.

Background
Contagious equine metritis (CEM), which was first
reported in thoroughbred mares during the 1977 breeding season in the UK [1], is an important bacterial genital
infectious disease of horses caused by Taylorella equigenitalis. CEM generally leads to a loss of fertility in mares and
the disruption of breeding programs. Since the first report
of CEM, this disease and its causative agent have been
detected in many countries and in various breeds of

horses [2,3]. Diagnosis of CEM has been performed by the
isolation of T. equigenitalis, a nonmotile gram-negative
coccobacillus, cultured by means of conventional selective bacteriological techniques.
In relation to the phylogenetic positioning of T. equigenitalis, Bleumink-Pluym et al. were the first to determine 16S
rDNA sequences from three strains of T. equigenitalis
(NCTC11184T, N480/82 and N610/88; GenBank AccesPage 1 of 4

sion No. X68645) to be identical and demonstrated this
organism to belong to the β subclass of the class Proteobacteria [4]. When Jang et al. analyzed the phylogenetic position of T. asinigenitalis, which is a new second species
within the genus Taylorella, and a gram-negative, nonmotile coccobacilli but phenotypically indistinguishable
from T. equigenitalis, which was isolated from donkey
jacks (Equus asinus) in the USA, in 1997 and 1998 [5], they
described that T. equigenitalis appears to be homogeneous
with respect to the 16S rDNA sequence, since all 15
strains, (11 American strains, two Dutch strains, one British and one Japanese isolate,) (Accession No. AF297712
for a Dutch isolate 10783; AF297173 for an American isolate 96–178), together with the published sequence
(X68645), were 100% identical [6].
Recently, our research group determined the 16S rDNA
sequences of three additional strains, a British type strain
NCTC11184T, an American prototype strain Kentucky
188 and a Japanese strain EQ59 of T. equigentalis, and
demonstrated sequence differences in the six 16S rDNA
sequences including three reference sequences, whose
accession numbers are shown in Table 1 [7]. Consequently, at present, six accessible sequences of 16S rDNA
from T. equigenitalis, whose sequence differences occur at
a few nucleotide positions are available.
Therefore, it is important to determine these sequences
from additional strains in other countries, if possible, in
order to clarify any anomalies regarding 16S rDNA
sequence heterogeneity. Therefore, the authors wished to
clone and sequence the approximately full-length 16S
rDNA from more strains of T. equigenitalis isolated in
Japan, Australia and France and compare these sequences
among the existing published sequences described above.

Results
As shown in Table 2 [see 1], the nucleotide sequence differences were demonstrated at six loci in the 1469 nucleotide sequence of the nearly full-length 16S rDNA, among
17 strains (EQ70 ~ Fr-10) isolated in Japan, Australia and
France (AB200397–AB200413 in Table 1). Moreover, 12
polymorphic sites occurred among 23 sequences of the
16S rDNA, including the six reference sequences, as demonstrated in Table 2. In relation to the three countries,
Japan, Australia and France, the strains from each respective country, interestingly, gave an identical sequence.
Moreover, these strains whose 16S rDNA sequences were
analyzed, are from all over the world and carried distinct
multiple genotypes [3]. In addition, the sequences of two
American strains (Kentucky 188 and 96–178 [AF
297173]) used as references in the present study are different on some positions.

Consequently, in the present study, a high sequence similarity of 16S rDNA (99.5% or more) with the nine polymorphic sites was observed, between np 138 and 501, of
a total of 12, where substitutions and deletions were
noted. Thus, there is a single polymorphic site in the
approximately 2/3 of the 16S rDNA sequence between np
502 and 1469, while the first approximately 1/3 between
np 1 and 501 has nine polymorphic sites among 17
strains, suggesting an extremely high sequence similarity
in the approximately 2/3 downstream of the 16S rDNA
sequence of T. equigenitalis.

Discussion
Recently, Jang et al. demonstrated that the 16S rDNA of T.
equigenitalis gave 97.6% sequence similarity to those of T.
asinigenitalis [6]. In relation to one of the present molecular guidelines, it is suggested that 3% sequence variation
of the 16S rDNA sequence is a threshold value to represent distinctly different bacterial species [8-11] However,
most recently, some examples of lower levels of 16S rDNA
sequence variations were found among some Campylobacter species [12]. The organisms within the genus Taylorella are also an example of lower levels of 16S rDNA
sequence variation.

Conclusion
The 16S rDNA sequences of T. equigenitalis were demonstrated to give high sequence similarity (99.5% or more)
to each other among 23 sequences, but were not identical.
Lower levels of 16S rDNA sequence variations were confirmed among the organisms of the genus Taylorella.

Methods
T. equigenitalis strains
Seventeen strains of T. equigenitalis, which had been isolated in Japan (n = 6), Australia (n = 7) and France (n = 4)
and examined in the present study are shown in Table 1
[see Additional File 1]. Although six Japanese strains,
seven Australian strains and a French strains (Fr-10) were
isolated from mares clinically affected with CEM, sources
and symptom of the two French strains (Fr-1 and Fr-2) are
not available. Since male horses were demonstrated to
transmit the organism responsible for CEM, in the present
study an isolate isolated from a symptomless carrier male
French Trotter (Fr-9) was also examined (Table 1) [see
Additional file 1].
Cultural conditions and genomic DNA preparation
Culture conditions for these strains and genomic DNA
preparation have been described previously [13,14].
PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing
PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the nearly
full-length 16S rDNA have also been described [15]. In
relation to the PCR, at present, a primer pair set (fD1; 5'-

GAATTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3' and rTel; 5'-GGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3') was employed for amplification of the
nearly full-length 16S rDNA from T. equigenitalis strains.
The primer fD1 contained the 3' end-19 nucleotide
sequences of the original fD1 primer sequence [16]. The
rTel was constructed based on the nucleotide sequence
information of the 3' end region of E. coli 16S rDNA of
rrnB operon (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Accession No.
J01695).
Nucleotide sequence analysis
The sequences of the nearly full-length 16S rDNA were
aligned using GENETYX-MAC version 9.0 (GENETYX Co.
Tokyo, Japan). The sequence data of the 16S rDNA of T.
equigenitalis determined in the present study are accessible
in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank, as shown in Table 1, as well
as the six reference sequences.

The nucleotide sequences corresponding to the primers
fD1 and rTel, employed for PCR amplification of the
nearly full-length 16S rDNA from the 17 strains of T. equigenitalis, were excluded for similarity analysis. Therefore,
the nucleotide position (np) one (A) of the sequence data
shown in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank corresponds to np 28
of the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene from the rrnB cistron of Escherichia coli [17,18]. As already described [7], in
the three reference sequences from NCTC11184T, Kentucky 188 and EQ59, CCTCCT sequences (np 1513 to
1518), which are highly conserved sequences close to the
3' end of the mature 16S rRNA and complementary to the
Shine-Dalgarno sequence on mRNA [19-21], [22] were
demonstrated.
