infant HIV-1 envelopes

Abstract
Background: Understanding the properties of HIV-1 variants that are transmitted from women to their infants is
crucial to improving strategies to prevent transmission. In this study, 162 full-length envelope (env) clones were
generated from plasma RNA obtained from 5 HIV-1 Clade B infected mother-infant pairs. Following extensive
genotypic and phylogenetic analyses, 35 representative clones were selected for functional studies.
Results: Infant quasispecies were highly homogeneous and generally represented minor maternal variants,
consistent with transmission across a selective bottleneck. Infant clones did not differ from the maternal in env
length, or glycosylation. All infant variants utilized the CCR5 co-receptor, but were not macrophage tropic.
Relatively high levels (IC50 ≥ 100 μg/ml) of autologous maternal plasma IgG were required to neutralize maternal
and infant viruses; however, all infant viruses were neutralized by pooled sera from HIV-1 infected individuals,
implying that they were not inherently neutralization-resistant. All infant viruses were sensitive to the HIV-1 entry
inhibitors Enfuvirtide and soluble CD4; none were resistant to Maraviroc. Sensitivity to human monoclonal
antibodies 4E10, 2F5, b12 and 2G12 varied.
Conclusions: This study provides extensive characterization of the genotypic and functional properties of HIV-1 env
shortly after transmission. We present the first detailed comparisons of the macrophage tropism of infant and
maternal env variants and their sensitivity to Maraviroc, the only CCR5 antagonist approved for therapeutic use.
These findings may have implications for improving approaches to prevent mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission.

Background
Mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission is the primary
mode of pediatric infection. Over 50% of HIV-1 infected
individuals around the world are women in their childbearing years [1,2]. In the absence of intervention, more
than a third of the children born to infected mothers
acquire HIV-1 through mother-to-child transmission
(MTCT) [3-5]. This accounts for up to 14% of all HIV-1
transmission [1,5], with 370,000 infants infected in 2009.
MTCT can occur during gestation, at delivery and
through breastfeeding. Seventy-five percent of HIV-1
infected children die by the age of 3 years, accounting
for up to 20% of all HIV-1 related deaths [6,7]; in
resource-limited settings, HIV-1 accounts for one third
of all deaths among children under five [1].

Studies in multiple cohorts, across several clades, have
demonstrated that a marked restriction in the diversity
of founder viruses in blood and plasma is a hallmark of
mucosal HIV-1 infection, including sexual transmission
[8-12] and MTCT [13]. This restricted diversity suggests
either the transmission or post-transmission amplification of a single donor variant in the majority of recipients [3,14-16]. The genetic and biologic determinants of
the transmission bottleneck are largely unknown.
The env glycoprotein (gp160) engages the HIV-1
receptor and co-receptors, mediating virus entry into
cells [17], and is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. Env is also the most variable HIV-1 gene. We
therefore set out to extensively characterize the genotypes and phenotypes of full-length env molecular clones
from HIV-1 infected mother-infant pairs. Better understanding of the genotypic and functional properties of
transmitted env variants may facilitate the development
of improved strategies to prevent MTCT.

Results
Phylogeny of envelope sequences

Full-length env genes were amplified from mother and
infant patient plasma HIV-1 RNA (Table 1). At least 10
clones were generated for each subject; 88% of env
clones proved functional, with no significant differences
in functionality between mothers and infants detected
within or across transmission pairs (data not shown). A
total of 162 functional maternal and infant env clones,
each from an independent limiting dilution RT-PCR,
were obtained and sequenced through the V1-V5
regions of the envelopes. A neighbor-joining tree was
constructed by alignment of these nucleotide sequences
(Figure 1A). For one patient (P1031), three clones were
sequenced through V1-V3 only and are not included in
the tree. The resulting tree revealed clear epidemiological linkage within each mother-infant pair, with no evidence of cross-pair or other contamination. Maximum
likelihood trees and Highlighter alignments of non-gap
stripped sequences were used to confirm phylogeny and
select representative clones (data not shown).
At least 2 clones were selected from each infant: the closest to and farthest from the consensus of the subject. In
two cases where the infants were clearly infected with two
maternal variants (P1031 and P1024; Figure 1A), clones
from the major infant variant were selected as above, and
the clone closest to the consensus of the minor infant variant was also included. At least four maternal clones were
selected from each subject to sample the breadth of their
quasispecies. Using Maximum Likelihood Trees, a maternal clone was selected from each of the two branches closest to the infant, and two additional clones were chosen
from distantly related branches (data not shown). Fulllength gp160 sequences of both DNA strands were
obtained for the selected clones.
Full-length env sequences were obtained for all
selected clones (Figure 1B), and the consensus gp160
sequence was determined for each infant. Of the 13

infant clones selected, four were identical to their
infant’s gp160 consensus. Eight clones differed from the
consensus by two amino acids or less, one differed by
three, and one (P1024 H2) differed by six. For two randomly selected infants (P1189 and P1049), consensus
gp160 sequences generated by SGA were identical to
those obtained by endpoint dilution PCR (data not
shown). Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that all subjects were infected with subtype B.
Visual inspection of phylogenetic trees (Figure 1 and
2) and Highlighter alignments (data not shown) of each
mother-infant pair demonstrated probable transmission
of a single maternal variant to infants P1189, P1049, and
P1046, two variants to infant P1031 and two or three to
infant P1024. Of the variants transmitted to P1024, two
arose from very closely related viruses, or through posttransmission diversification (Figure 2). The relationship
between maternal and infant quasispecies was further
analyzed based on the paradigm described by Haaland
et al. [18]. The number of amino acids differing between
each infant variant and the most closely related maternal sequence in the V1-V5 region were determined, as
were the number of maternal sequences differing from
an infant variant by less than three amino acids (Table
2). A maternal sequence differing from an infant variant
by less than three amino acids likely gave rise to that
variant. If such sequences represent less than 5% of the
maternal quasispecies, a minor maternal variant was
likely transmitted to the infant [18]. Infant P1024 was
apparently infected with two or three minor variants of
the maternal quasispecies, infant P1049 with a single
major variant, infant P1031 with two minor variants,
while infants P1189 and P1046 each received a single
minor variant (Table 2). Infant sequences were more
homogeneous than maternal, with the mean diversity,
measured by number of base substitutions per site
within each subject ranging from 0.1 to 0.3% among
infants, and 0.6 to 4.6% among mothers (Figure 3).

Percent base substitutions per site

Figure 3 Infant quasispecies are more homogeneous than
maternal. The percent of base substitutions per site over the V1-V5
region for each subject were computed using the Kimura 2parameter method in the MEGA4 software program.

Figure 2 Highlighter analysis of infant P1024 V1-V5 sequences.
The subject quasispecies consists of three variants. Sequences
belonging to the same variant are indicated by colored arrows. Pink
and blue variants arose from transmission of two very closely
related maternal viruses, or by post-transmission diversification. The
brown variant arose from transmission of a distinct maternal virus.

The consensus sequence of clones amplified shortly
following transmission from a subject infected with a single donor variant represents the sequence of the transmitted/founder virus [18]. We compared maternal gp160
sequences to the consensus of each infant variant to
determine how closely clones selected for their similarity

infants were; M1003 P16 which differed from the infant
consensus by three amino acid substitutions, M1001 J7
which differed by four amino acids substitutions, M1007
T1 which differed by three amino acids, M1006 X1
which differed by three substitutions, and M1002 J4
which differed by 15 amino acids. No maternal sequence
was identical to the consensus of an infant variant. We
then compared the maternal sequences to each individual
sequence amplified from her infant and did not detect
any maternal sequence identical to any infant sequence.
Env V1-V5 length, glycosylation and co-receptor tropism

Since env length and glycosylation have been reported to
correlate with mucosal transmission, including MTCT [15],
we investigated these factors in our panel. In pairs M1001P1024 and M1007-P1046, the median V1-V5 length of
infant sequences was greater than maternal, while in pairs
M1002-P1031, M1006-P1049, and M1003-P1189, the medians were similar (Table 3). The median number of V1-V5
PNGS was smaller in the infant sequences than in the
mother’s for pair M1002-P1031, greater for pair M1001P1024, and equal in pairs M1007-P1046, M1006-P1049 and
M1003-P1189 (Table 3). Statistical analysis did not indicate
significant within-pair differences in the mean env length or
glycosylation between maternal and infant clones. The V3
loop charge and glycosylation are predictive of co-receptor
tropism [19,20]. Examination of charge and glycosylation of
the V3 loops of our env clones did not reveal any CXCR4
(X4) tropic variants in our panel and only one mother

(M1006), was predicted to harbor CCR5/CXCR4 dual tropic variants. Only CCR5 (R5) tropic maternal variants were
transmitted to the infants (Table 3).
Receptor and co-receptor requirements

The in-silico R5 tropism predictions were confirmed in
vitro by comparing titers on the TZMbl and HIJ cell
lines. TZMbl express both the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors, while HIJ express CXCR4 but not CCR5 [21].
Pseudoviruses expressing the X4 tropic NL4.3 env and
the R5 tropic SF162 env were used as controls; NL4.3
env infected both cell lines while SF162 env infected
only TZMbl. All maternal and infant clones achieved
high titers on TZMbl, but only one maternal clone
(M1006 P1) infected both cell lines (Figure 4A).
The receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5) use of
representative maternal and infant env clones (n = 35, Figure 1B) was then analyzed in depth. Pseudoviruses expressing these env were generated and titered on TZMbl cells
(Figure 4A), and on additional HeLa cell lines expressing
varying levels of CD4 and CCR5 [21] (Figure 4B-E). Infant
viruses infected all cell lines tested. When pairwise comparisons were made, there was no significant difference
between the mean infant and maternal titers on any cell
line. All clones achieved highest titers on TZMbl cells,
which express the highest levels of CD4 and CCR5. Titers
decreased with decreasing levels of CD4 (Figure 4B verses
D) or CCR5 (Figure 4B verses C, and D verses E), but
were more sensitive to changes in CD4.
Replication in primary macrophages and PBL

We used two different approaches to evaluate the ability of
maternal and infant viruses to replicate in primary macrophages. First, we investigated the ability of pseudoviruses

expressing the env clones to mediate infection of primary
macrophage cultures in a single round infection. All infant
viruses exhibited low or no infectivity in monocyte derived
macrophages (MDM); similarly, only a single maternal
clone (M1002 G1) attained a high level of infection as
compared to the non-macrophage tropic and highly
macrophage tropic controls (Figure 5). Macrophage infectivity was further investigated by infecting matched donor
MDM and PBLs with EGFP-tagged recombinant env
clones from two randomly selected mother-infant pairs
(Table 4). No fluorescence was detected in macrophage
cultures throughout two weeks of infection while high
levels of fluorescence were detected in each PBL infection.
Measurement of HIV-1 p24 in the supernatants collected
from cultures over the course of infection showed a steady
decline from the input levels of p24 in macrophage infections, while PBL infections showed an increase. Altogether,
these data demonstrate robust replication in PBL but uniformly poor replication in macrophages.
Sensitivity of envelope clones to neutralization by
autologous maternal plasma

We assayed at least three clones from each motherinfant pair. Relatively high levels (≥ 100 μg/ml) of autologous maternal plasma IgG were required to neutralize
maternal and infant viruses (Figure 6A). Statistical analysis did not indicate significant within-pair differences
in the susceptibility of maternal and infant clones to
neutralization by autologous maternal IgG.
Sensitivity of envelope clones to neutralization by
monoclonal antibodies and pooled seropositive plasma

Using a standardized assay [22,23], we tested the neutralization sensitivity profile of our pseudoviruses to a

maternal clone was resistant to 2F5. Only one clone was
resistant to 4E10 (P1046 J1) and expressed the rare,
resistance conferring, natural polymorphism F673L
[24,25]. All clones from three infants were resistant to
20 μg of 2G12 and exhibited mutations eliminating one
of five PNGS implicated in 2G12 binding [26]. In infant
P1024, the mutation was N386D, in P1049 it was
N392K, and in P1046 it was T292I. Most maternal
clones from these pairs exhibited similar levels of 2G12
resistance, and displayed the corresponding mutations.
Infants P1031, P1046 and P1049 had some clones resistant to 20 μg of b12, but each had one sensitive clone.
A similar pattern of sensitive and resistant clones was
seen in the corresponding mothers. When pairwise analyses were performed, we did not detect any trends for
differential neutralization sensitivity between infant and
maternal variants.
The neutralization sensitivity of the pseudoviruses to
pooled heterologous plasma with high NAb activity was
next determined (Figure 6C). Sensitivity varied over a 4fold range within mother-infant pairs, but all infant and
maternal viruses were sensitive to neutralization at
plasma reciprocal dilutions ranging from 109 to 1588.
Pairwise analysis failed to detect any trends for withinpairs differences in neutralization sensitivity to this
reagent.
Sensitivity of infant envelope clones to HIV-1 entry
inhibitors

The sensitivity of infant clones to three HIV-1 entry
inhibitors was evaluated (Figure 6 and data not shown).
The inhibitors used were sCD4, T20 (fusion inhibitor)
and Maraviroc (CCR5 antagonist). Since Maraviroc is a
non-competitive inhibitor, we determined the MPI of
our clones by this inhibitor. All clones were inhibited by
>99% at concentrations exceeding 400 nM, indicating
that none were resistant [27,28]. The NL4.3 env control
exhibited a MPI of <2% (data not shown).
Infant clones were sensitive to T20 and sCD4, exhibiting IC50 ranges similar to the maternal. Mean T20 IC50
for infant clones was 0.23 μg/ml and 0.24 μg/ml for
maternal. Soluble CD4 exhibited a mean IC 50 of 7.24
μg/ml for infants and 6.43 μg/ml for mothers. No significant within-pair differences in sensitivity to these inhibitors were observed between maternal and infant
viruses.

Discussion
We generated full-length viable env clones from 5
mother-infant pairs and extensively characterized their
V1-V5 genotypes and phylogeny. Phylogenetic analyses
showed that infant sequences were more homogeneous
than maternal viral sequences. The highest sequence
diversity seen in the infants, 0.3%, fits well with the

model of Keele et al. [9], which indicates that the maximum diversity expected within an individual shortly
after infection with a single virus is 0.6%. Of the 8 transmitted/founder variants identified in the infants of our
cohort, seven represented minor variants of the maternal quasispecies at the time of sampling, which was
within a few weeks of transmission. These data support
previous findings [13,14,29] suggesting a selective bottleneck during MTCT.
Consensus gp160 endpoint dilution sequences from
two randomly selected infants were identical to those
obtained by SGA. These results are compatible with a
recent report that standard PCR and SGA provide similar measures of viral diversity when sufficient templates
are analyzed [30].
Several groups have reported shorter hypervariable
regions and fewer N-linked glycosylation sites in Clade

C sexually (reviewed [31]) or maternally [32] transmitted
viruses. Our data on Clade B viruses are compatible
with others’ work that did not find altered env length or
glycosylation site number in transmitted Clade B viruses
[33].
All infant clones were R5 tropic, consistent with
numerous prior reports [34-36]. Intrapartum transmission of HIV-1 is hypothesized to occur across the
mucosa, although the exact mechanisms have not been
determined (reviewed [37,38]). Efficient HIV-1 infection
usually requires the expression of relatively high levels
of the CD4 receptor and CCR5 co-receptor on the surface of target cells [21,39]. However, levels of CD4 and
CCR5 on mucosal and submucosal cell subsets can be
much lower than on CD4+ memory T cells [40]. Titration on cell lines expressing different levels of CD4 and
CCR5 demonstrated efficient infection of cells with

Kishko et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:67
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/67

variable levels of these molecules. This finding is supported by our failure to observe any systematic differences in the sensitivity of maternal and infant env to
inhibition by sCD4 or CCR5 inhibitors. It is also in
agreement with a recent report that sexual HIV-1 transmission does not appear to select for viruses that can
preferentially utilize lower levels of CD4 or CCR5 [39].
CCR5 co-receptor usage has traditionally been equated
with macrophage-tropism. Peters et al. have recently
clarified that not all R5 viruses are macrophage-tropic
(reviewed [41]). Only 1 of 35 plasma-derived env clones
achieved greater than 1% of their TZMbl titers on MDM.
Our results are in agreement with prior data [42] demonstrating that peripheral blood viruses frequently exhibit
low levels of macrophage infectivity, and that sexually
transmitted R5 tropic variants replicate poorly in macrophages [43,44]. Finally, these findings support recent
models of HIV-1 transmission, which suggest that cell
subtypes other than macrophages are the first to encounter HIV-1 during mucosal transmission [44,45].
We screened our clones to determine their sensitivity
to neutralization by a panel of well-characterized monoclonal Nabs. Sensitivity to these NAbs varied both
between and within mother-infant pairs. Clones were
uniformly sensitive to 2F5. Only one clone (from infant
P1046) was resistant to 4E10; this clone exhibited the
F673L natural polymorphism associated with resistance
to this Nab [24]. All clones with 2G12 resistance correlated with loss of one of five PNGS that make up the
2G12 epitope.
At least two groups have reported that infant env
clones are relatively resistant to neutralization by autologous maternal plasma [15,46]. Relatively high levels
(IC50 ≥ 100 μg/ml) of autologous maternal plasma IgG
were required to neutralize maternal and infant viruses;
however, all infant viruses were neutralized by pooled
sera from HIV-1 infected individuals, implying that they
were not inherently neutralization-resistant.
CCR5 antagonists are a potent new class of entry inhibitors. Since only R5 variants are vertically transmitted,
CCR5 antagonists may be highly relevant to blocking
MTCT; however their effectiveness against infant isolates has not been well characterized, and partial resistance to CCR5 antagonists in a treatment-naïve
individual has been reported [28]. All env clones in our
panel were sensitive to Maraviroc. All infant clones
were also sensitive to T20 and sCD4, and no significant
differences in sensitivity were seen between maternal
and infant viruses. The latter is in contrast with data
from Keele et al. [9], who demonstrated significantly
higher IC50 values for T1249, a fusion inhibitor with a
mechanism of action similar to T20, among viruses
from acutely infected as compared to chronically
infected subjects.

Conclusions
Although we have a relatively small sized patient cohort,
the results of our extensive genotypic and phenotypic
studies confirm that clade B MTCT occurs across a
selective bottleneck, and that neither env length nor glycosylation appear to play a role in this selection. Utilization of low receptor and co-receptor levels for entry
likewise does not appear to play a major role in the
selective bottleneck during vertical transmission of HIV1 clade B. Most intriguingly, R5 tropic maternal and
infant env exhibited poor macrophage infectivity. Relatively high levels (IC 50 ≥ 100 μg/ml) of autologous
maternal plasma IgG were required to neutralize maternal and infant viruses. Maternal and infant clones were
equally sensitive to pooled heterologous plasma, implying that inherent neutralization resistance is unlikely to
be a major factor controlling the selective bottleneck.
Infant clones were variably sensitive to neutralization by
monoclonal antibodies but uniformly sensitive to HIV-1
entry inhibitors. Together, our findings provide further
insight into the selective pressures influencing the
genetic bottleneck during vertical transmission of HIV-1
and may help inform the future development of therapies to prevent MTCT.
Materials and methods
Study population

Plasma samples were obtained from 5 HIV-1 clade B
infected women and their infants (Table 1). Maternal
samples were obtained at or within a month of delivery.
None of the mothers exhibited opportunistic infections
or AIDS-defining illnesses. All five infants were infected
at delivery, based on standard definitions [5]. Most
intrapartum transmission is thought to occur across the
mucosa although the exact mechanisms have not been
determined (reviewed [37,38]). None of the infants were
breastfed. Infant samples were obtained within 2 months
of delivery and represent the first time point at which
HIV-1 was detected in the infants by viral isolation or
the detection of nucleic acids.
PCR amplification and generation of functional envelope
(gp160) clones via endpoint dilution

Viral RNA was extracted from 50-200 μl of plasma
using the Roche High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland). Eluted RNA was treated
with 1 μl of RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor (Promega
Biosciences, San Luis Obispo, CA), then aliquoted and
stored at -80°C. Full-length HIV-1 gp160 was amplified
directly from the viral RNA by endpoint dilution nested
RT-PCR. To identify the endpoint dilutions, RT-PCR
was performed in octuplet on two fold serial dilutions of
each viral RNA extract until a dilution was reached
where not more than three of eight wells showed

Kishko et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:67
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/67

product. Outer and inner primer pairs were the same as
reported by Wei et al. [47]. RT-PCR was performed
using the Superscript One Step RT-PCR for Long Templates kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
Conditions for the outer PCR were as follows: 45°C for
30 min, 94°C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec, 52°
C for 30 sec, 68°C for 3 min, with a final extension at
72°C for 10 min. Inner PCR was performed using the
Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase HighFidelity kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Conditions for
the inner PCR were as follows: 94°C for 2 min, 40 cycles
of 94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, 68°C for 3 min, with
a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The ~3 kb env
amplicons were sub-cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His
TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) using the manufacturer’s instructions. Colonies
containing full length inserts in the correct orientation
were identified by a PCR screen; their functionality was
determined using syncytia as a readout by the addition
of HeLa cells expressing CD4 and CCR5 (TZMbl a.k.a.
JC53BL [21,48]) to monolayers of 293T cells [49] transfected with the molecularly cloned env [50]. At least 10
functional env clones were obtained from each subject,
with each clone originating from an independent endpoint dilution PCR.
Single genome amplification (SGA)

SGA was performed as described by Salazar-Gonzalez et
al. [10]. Briefly, viral RNA extracted as above was
reverse transcribed to single-stranded cDNA using primer OFM1. The cDNA was diluted in 96 well plates
such that less than 30% of the reactions yielded amplified product. Nested PCR was then carried out using
primers Vif1 and OFM19 for the outer step, and EnvA
and EnvN for the inner. All correctly sized products
were purified and sequenced.
DNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and clone
selection

The V1-V5 regions of all viable molecular env clones
were sequenced using BigDye Terminator chemistry.
Sequences were assembled using the Vector NTI software (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Env
sequences from each subject were aligned using ClustalW in the software package BioEdit http://www.mbio.
ncsu.edu/BioEdit/BioEdit.html, and trees were constructed using the neighbor joining method [51] implemented in Mega http://www.megasoftware.net using
Kimura’s correction [52] and 1000 iterations of Bootstrap analysis, and the maximum likelihood method
with 500 iterations of Bootstrap analysis implemented in
PhyML http://www.hiv.lanl.gov. Phylogeny was confirmed using the Highlighter software program http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov. Potential N-Linked glycosylation sites

Page 10 of 14

(PNGS) were identified using the N-Glycosite program
http://www.hiv.lanl.gov. The V3 loop charge was determined by comparing the number of positively charged
(Aspartic Acid and Glutamic Acid) to negatively charged
(Lysine and Arginine) amino acid residues.
Pseudovirus production and titration

Pseudoviruses were made by co-transfecting exponentially
dividing 293T cells with a 1:2 ratio of env and pSG3Δenv
backbone (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program [47,53]) using Polyethylenimine (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) as the transfection reagent. Pseudoviral titers
were determined using single round infection of TZMbl
cells essentially as described [23] except that b-galactosidase
staining rather than luminescence was used as the readout.
Cells developed using the b-galactosidase readout were
counted on an automated ELISPOT reader (See Additional
File 1; Supplemental Methods). The titers were expressed
as spot forming units per ml (sfu/ml). Assays utilizing luminescence gave results very similar to those determined by
using b-galactosidase (data not shown). Titrations were performed at least twice for each pseudovirus.
Construction of replication competent fluorescently
tagged HIV-1

A fluorescently tagged, replication competent HIV-1 backbone was obtained from Dr. Matthias Dittmar (Centre for
Infectious Disease, Institute of Cell and Molecular Science,
Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry).
Plasmids encoding selected infant and maternal env in this
backbone were generated as described [54]. Briefly, we
used the plasmid TN6GΔ, which encodes the full length
NL4.3 HIV-1 clone with the nef gene replaced by EGFP
and has unique restriction sites (BstEII and NcoI) in the
env gene available for inserting heterologous env. The
complementary restriction sites were introduced into
selected infant and maternal env clones and used for directional sub-cloning into TN6GΔ. Live, fluorescently tagged
virus was produced using essentially the same protocol as
for the pseudovirus described above.
Cell line, macrophage, and peripheral blood lymphocyte
(PBL) titrations and infections

Receptor and co-receptor requirements of pseudoviruses
were determined by titration on HeLa cells engineered
to express various levels of the CD4 receptor and CCR5
and CXCR4 co-receptors [21]. In silico predicted CCR5
tropism was confirmed by titration on the HIJ HeLa cell
line, which expresses CD4 and CXCR4 but no CCR5
[21], using pseudoviruses expressing the CXCR4 tropic
NL4.3 env [55] and the CCR5 tropic SF162 env (NIH
AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program Catalog
# 10463) as controls. Titrations were performed as
described [50] utilizing anti-p24 immunostaining as the

Kishko et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:67
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/67

infectivity readout. To determine macrophage infectivity,
elutriated monocytes were re-suspended in medium
containing macrophage colony stimulating factor and
cultured for seven days before use for pseudoviral titrations essentially as described [50]. Each pseudovirus was
tested in duplicate in 3 independent assays. To normalize between different pseudoviral preparations, all titers
are expressed as a ratio of the titer on the cell line or
macrophage culture divided by the titer on TZMbl cells.
For infection of PBLs, fresh PBLs were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml) for 2 days,
and interleukin-2 (10 U/ml) for a further 2 days prior to
infection. PBLs were infected with live virus at an MOI
of 0.01 or 0.001 as indicated (based on TZMbl or PBL
titers as appropriate) and carried for seven days before
being read for HIV-1 positive cells by anti-p24 immunostaining or flow cytometry.

clones was determined by observing plateaus in the inhibition curves [59] at saturating concentrations of Maraviroc (up to 4000 nM) [28,59]. All plasma was heat
inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes before use. Seronegative plasma was used as a negative control and
showed no neutralization activity at 1:15 dilution. Pseudovirus expressing murine leukemia virus (MLV) env
was used as a non-specific neutralization control and
generally failed to be inhibited by the highest concentration of plasma used. Since we have previously observed
non-specific neutralization of the MLV control and
available plasma volumes were limited, we used purified
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in our autologous neutralization assays (see below). For all antibodies and inhibitors,
the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) relative to
untreated control infections was determined from plots
generated using the sigmoidal fit function of the OriginPro 7.5 SRO v7 software package [60] (See Additional
File 1; Supplemental Methods).

Neutralization and inhibition assays

Neutralization and inhibition assays using human monoclonal antibodies, pooled HIV-positive patient sera,
autologous maternal plasma, or HIV-1 entry inhibitors
were performed as previously described [22,23,56-58],
using 200 sfu of pseudovirus to infect TZMbl cells, with
residual infection measured using the b-galactosidase
readout. To determine the activity of CCR5 antagonists,
the assay was modified such that cell monolayers were
incubated with serial dilutions of the inhibitors for one
hour before the addition of virus. Following the addition
of virus, plates were incubated overnight and the media
was replaced with fresh un-supplemented media. Pseudoviral stocks expressing well-characterized env from
the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program
Standard Reference Panels of Subtype B or C HIV-1 Env
Clones [22,56,57] were used in every experiment and
showed low intra-assay variation, and values similar to
those reported [56,57] (data not shown). Monoclonal
NAbs b12, 2G12, 4E5, and 2F5 were obtained from the
NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program; an
additional aliquot of b12 was generously provided by
Dr. Dennis Burton (Scripps Research Institute). The
maximum b12 and 2G12 antibody concentration used
in neutralization assays was 20 μg/ml, while 4E10 and
2F5 were used at 50 μg/ml. HIV-1 entry inhibitors soluble CD4 (sCD4, Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown,
NY), Enfuvirtide (T20, Roche, Palo Alto, CA) and Maraviroc (obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and
Reference Reagent Program) were also evaluated in
these assays. As Maraviroc is a non-competitive inhibitor, resistance was determined by changes in the maximal percent inhibition (MPI) [59]. The MPI of our

Autologous neutralization using purified IgG

IgG was purified from plasmas using the Nab Protein
Spin Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Elution fractions one and
two were pooled and dialyzed in culture media using
the Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Kit, 10 K MWCO (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The amount of IgG in
the dialyzed extracts and the original maternal plasma
was quantified using the Human IgG ELISA Kit (ZeptoMetrix Corporation, Baffalo, NY). Autologous neutralizations were set up at an initial IgG concentration
of 0.5 mg/ml.
Statistical analyses

Pairwise differences between maternal and infant values
were evaluated using Mixed Model ANOVA [61] with
mother-infant pairs included as random effects. The
analyses were performed using the Proc Mixed procedure [62] in the SAS statistical Software package (SAS
Inc, NC, USA). Significance was reported when p ≤ 0.05.
