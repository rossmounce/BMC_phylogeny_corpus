Abstract
Background: Orthologs (genes that have diverged after a speciation event) tend to have similar
function, and so their prediction has become an important component of comparative genomics
and genome annotation. The gold standard phylogenetic analysis approach of comparing available
organismal phylogeny to gene phylogeny is not easily automated for genome-wide analysis;
therefore, ortholog prediction for large genome-scale datasets is typically performed using a
reciprocal-best-BLAST-hits (RBH) approach. One problem with RBH is that it will incorrectly
predict a paralog as an ortholog when incomplete genome sequences or gene loss is involved. In
addition, there is an increasing interest in identifying orthologs most likely to have retained similar
function.
Results: To address these issues, we present here a high-throughput computational method
named Ortholuge that further evaluates previously predicted orthologs (including those predicted
using an RBH-based approach) – identifying which orthologs most closely reflect species divergence
and may more likely have similar function. Ortholuge analyzes phylogenetic distance ratios involving
two comparison species and an outgroup species, noting cases where relative gene divergence is
atypical. It also identifies some cases of gene duplication after species divergence. Through
simulations of incomplete genome data/gene loss, we show that the vast majority of genes falsely
predicted as orthologs by an RBH-based method can be identified. Ortholuge was then used to
estimate the number of false-positives (predominantly paralogs) in selected RBH-predicted
ortholog datasets, identifying approximately 10% paralogs in a eukaryotic data set (mouse-rat
comparison) and 5% in a bacterial data set (Pseudomonas putida – Pseudomonas syringae species
comparison). Higher quality (more precise) datasets of orthologs, which we term "ssd-orthologs"
(supporting-species-divergence-orthologs), were also constructed. These datasets, as well as
Ortholuge software that may be used to characterize other species' datasets, are available at http:/
/www.pathogenomics.ca/ortholuge/ (software under GNU General Public License).
Conclusion: The Ortholuge method reported here appears to significantly improve the specificity
(precision) of high-throughput ortholog prediction for both bacterial and eukaryotic species. This
method, and its associated software, will aid those performing various comparative genomics-based
analyses, such as the prediction of conserved regulatory elements upstream of orthologous genes.

and gene tree for the human, cattle, and mouse species,
where human and cattle orthologs (unshaded genes) are
being identified. If the true cattle ortholog has not yet been
sequenced because of an incomplete bovine genome project,
it will not be present in the gene dataset used for analysis
(cattle gene crossed out with an X), and the best reciprocal
BLAST hit for the human gene will be a cattle paralog
(shaded gene). However, Ortholuge will detect this case as a
potential paralog, because it examines the relative phylogenetic distance between genes and identifies how well their
relative distances match expected species divergence.

Background
Ortholog prediction is an important facet of comparative
genomics and is frequently used in genome annotation,
gene function characterization, evolutionary genomics,
and in the identification of conserved regulatory elements. As the number of genome sequences grow, comparative genomics has become increasingly relevant.
Errors in ortholog prediction can greatly affect such studies and associated downstream analyses (including functional genomics and proteomics analyses), so there has
been increasing interest in high quality ortholog prediction.
Orthologs are commonly defined as genes that have
diverged after a speciation event [1], whereas genes that
have diverged after a gene duplication event, either before
a speciation event (out-paralogs) or after a speciation
event (in-paralogs), are collectively known as paralogs. It
has been found that orthologs tend to have similar function and so their utility in comparative analyses is paramount. Classically, orthologous genes are identified by
phylogenetic analysis. A phylogenetic tree for the genes is
compared against a reference species tree, with the notion
that the gene tree of orthologs should be similar to the
species tree. However, sophisticated phylogenetic analysis
is not easily automated, due in part to the complexity of
both manual sequence alignment editing and choice of
appropriate genes and species to be included in an analysis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/270

Whole-genome analyses indicate that many gene families
(essentially paralogs) were formed before the divergence
of most species commonly being compared in a comparative genomics analysis (out-paralogs). Therefore,
orthologs – which diverged due to speciation – are typically more similar to each other than to other genes in the
genome. This is why sequence similarity is often used to
infer gene orthology between two or more species, and is
also the premise behind the most common high-throughput ortholog prediction method used today: the reciprocal-best-BLAST-hits (RBH) analysis [2]. With the RBH
method, genes from species A and species B are predicted
to be orthologs if they are both the "best BLAST hit" of the
other, when all genes from species A are compared to all
genes from species B by BLAST analysis. There are numerous resources and methods that use a version of RBH as
part of their ortholog prediction process, including the
Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) database [3,4],
The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)'s EGO database [5], and INPARANOID [6,7]. However, if a gene is
not present in one organism's gene dataset, perhaps due
to incomplete genome sequence data or gene loss in the
organism, the RBH method will incorrectly predict a paralog as an ortholog (Fig. 1). Today, comparative genomics
is often being performed using incomplete genomes,
especially for large eukaryotic genome sequencing
projects. Also, gene loss is a major driving force behind
bacterial evolution [8]. It is therefore important to recognize that many of the current ortholog databases will
likely contain false-positives due to the limitations of the
RBH approach.
For comparative analyses, it is also frequently desirable to
identify orthologs that most likely have similar function.
In some cases, an ortholog may diverge more rapidly in
sequence (and function) in one organism/species versus
another related organism/species. In addition, a gene
duplication may occur in one species, but not a second
species, after species divergence. In this case either one –
or both – of the duplicated genes (in-paralogs) are more
likely to have diverged in function [9]. We therefore propose to differentiate such orthologs (reflecting what has
sometimes been referred to as "many-to-many" ortholog
relationships) from those that appear to have diverged
only due to a speciation event. We also wish to identify
those orthologs that have diverged to a degree that is similar to that expected for its species, since those orthologs
that have undergone unusually rapid divergence in one
species, relative to another, may have also diverged more
in function. We therefore propose the term ssd-orthologs
(for "supporting-species-divergence" orthologs) to define
orthologs that appear to have diverged only due to speciation – and have diverged to the same relative degree as
their species. These ssd-orthologs are more likely to have
retained similar function, and would better suit the pur-

are likely ssd-orthologs and which are likely paralogs or
other non-ssd-orthologs. The pipeline requires tentative
ortholog predictions (and the associated gene/protein
sequences) for large gene datasets from three species, two
of which are the species to be compared, and one of which
is an outgroup species. All phylogenetic distances between
the genes/proteins in an ortholog group are computed for
each group in the input list. Ratios of these distances are
used to evaluate ortholog quality. We find that these ratios
show certain consistencies over several sets of eukaryotic
and bacterial orthologs, along with data sets introduced
with true-negatives for comparison. This permitted the
formulation of ratio cut-offs for retaining ssd-orthologs
and removing probable paralogs, which resulted in a
higher quality data set of orthologs. Overall, we demonstrate that the relative evolutionary relationships may be
used to support the prediction of orthologs. In addition,
noting those orthologs with prominent differences (such
as recent gene duplications after species divergence) may
help refine analyses to permit the identification of those
orthologs that most likely retain the same function.

Results
An overview of the Ortholuge approach for increasing the
specificity of ortholog predictions is outlined in Figure 2.
Based on the analyses described below, the details of this
approach were formulated and the approach validated
using both prokaryotic and eukaryotic data sets.
Ortholuge software is available [28] to assist with the
analysis of data sets other than those reported here.

Therefore, ratio data is presented both in terms of frequency

poses of many comparative analyses. To avoid the confusion that may stem from the association of the term
"many-to-many orthologs" with in-paralogs, we will use
the term paralogs in this text to refer to out-paralogs and
specify in-paralogs, when applicable.
To address these issues, we have developed a method we
call Ortholuge. Ortholuge is a high-throughput analysis
pipeline that evaluates previously predicted orthologs
(such as RBH-predicted orthologs on a genome-wide
scale) and generates predictions regarding which of these

Data sets exhibited little bias due the automated sequence
alignment trimming approach
We investigated the behaviour and utility of Ortholuge
through analysis of diverse eukaryotic and bacterial RBHderived datasets. For the initial test eukaryotic data set, we
chose predicted mouse-rat-human orthologs from the
expressed sequence tag (EST) data in TIGR's Eukaryotic
Gene Ortholog (EGO) database [5] (for a mouse-rat comparison, with human as the outgroup). The majority of
our subsequent analyses utilized the higher quality MGDbased dataset (see Methods describing datasets) and the
RefSeq-based RBH dataset composed of these same species, as indicated. For the bacterial data set, we chose three
gamma-proteobacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas syringae (a Pseudomonas species comparison, with E. coli as the outgroup). Orthologs between
these three species (and other sets of species subsequently
examined) were predicted using a transitive RBH
approach, applied to the deduced proteins from complete
genome sequences [10-12].

Accurate sequence alignment is critical for phylogenetic
analysis; thus, we wished to improve the automated alignment and trimming components of the Ortholuge

method. We therefore performed a comprehensive examination of biases in our automated alignment editing
process (see Methods). A sample of RBH-predicted
ortholog sequence sets was analyzed to devise the gapmasking and sequence trimming approaches. The
sequence sets were examined to identify both gaps introduced by misalignments and gaps introduced through
sequence insertions and deletions. Our observations suggested that some of the noise introduced through the misalignment may be alleviated through the removal of the
gapped-segment flanking portions. We also noted that
there was no appreciable effect on the sequence distances
when the flanking sequences around the sequence-variation gapped regions were removed. We manually introduced gap-masking simulations over the sequences using
various window length criteria to establish a gap-masking
approach with a relatively conservative worst-case scenario. Both the trimming and gap-masking methods were
evaluated for the introduction of ratio distribution biases
by selected alignment characteristics. No obvious bias was
observed through the introduction of our gap masking
approach or alignment trimming (Fig. 3).
Ortholuge produces ratios which form distributions
Ortholuge was designed with the purpose of overcoming
certain limitations of the RBH method, such as the problem illustrated in Figure 1. Ortholuge overcomes this
problem by using ratios of phylogenetic distances

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/270

between genes to evaluate orthology, and using an outgroup species as a reference for two ingroup species being
compared (Fig. 2). For these three species, the distances
for the "ortholog triple" are calculated and the three possible ratios that can be generated are calculated (Fig. 2).
With this approach, the problem illustrated in Figure 1
would be detected because the human-cattle distance is
unexpectedly larger than the human-mouse distance –
impacting on ratio values. We ran Ortholuge on three
mouse-rat-human datasets: two sets of RBH-predicted
orthologs – one based on EGO data and the other based
on RefSeq data – and a third high-quality curated set. For
all datasets, human was the outgroup used to help predict
more precise orthologs between mouse (ingroup1) and
rat (ingroup2). The resulting Ortholuge phylogenetic distance ratios are shown in Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure 3 as histograms. For each of the three ratios, we
tabulated the frequency of putative orthologous groups
within certain ratio value ranges. Ratio1, Ratio2, and
Ratio3 each form clear distributions. Ratio3 is generally
located around a ratio value of 1, which is expected if the
chosen outgroup is more distant relative to the ingroups.
It is centered to the left or right of 1 depending on which
of the two ingroups is closer to the outgroup. The Ratio1
and Ratio2 distributions are generally located at a ratio
much lower than 1, reflecting the closer relationship
between the ingroup species versus any ingroup to the
outgroup. We ran our analyses on both protein and nucleotide sequences and found that for closely related species

ratio value of 1, reflecting the relative distances between

(see Figure 3 of [Additional file 1]).

exhibit low Ratio1 and Ratio2 values, in all three data sets.
For example, in panels A and D, about 86% of orthologs have
Ratio1 and Ratio2 values less than 1. However, the higher
quality data set (panels B and E) contains fewer points at
higher Ratio values versus the RBH-predicted data set. The
lower quality data set contains more points with very high
Ratio2 values (i.e. only 73% of points have Ratio1 and Ratio2
values less than 1), potentially reflecting the increased occurrence of probable cattle paralogs (i.e. paralogs being misidentified as orthologs by an RBH-analysis with an incomplete
cattle genome).
such as these, nucleotide sequences provide a better ratio
distribution resolution. However, the overall ratio distributions are similar, even when using different methods of
initial ortholog detection (see Figure 4 of [Additional file
1]).
We also performed this analysis with our bacterial P. putida-P. syringae-E. coli orthologs, comparing P. putida
(ingroup1) and P. syringae (ingroup2) using E. coli as the
outgroup. We observed very similar results: Both the
eukaryotic and prokaryotic data sets are consistent in the
distributions formed, and in the approximate position of
the distributions. Since we expected most ssd-orthologs
(see Introduction for definition) to evolve in a similar
manner, we hypothesized that orthologs falling within
the higher frequency ranges of the distributions are more
likely to be ssd-orthologs compared to those that are outliers. In essence, what is defining the species divergence is

Ortholuge ratios can also be conveniently visualized in an
R1 × R2 plot
Instead of histograms (Fig. 4), an alternative way to represent Ortholuge ratios is to use a 2-dimensional plot of two
Ortholuge ratios, where each putative ortholog group is
represented by one point in the graph. In principal, any
two of the three ratios can be used for the plot, since the
three ratios are related. That is, Ratio3 equals Ratio2
divided by Ratio1. Through subsequent analyses, we
found that the Ratio1 and Ratio2 combination (i.e. an R1
× R2 plot) was the simplest to visualize and to work with.

For the R1 × R2 plots, the eukaryotic mouse-rat-human
RBH-predicted putative orthologous groups appear to
occupy three types of positions (Fig. 5A and 5D). (1) The
majority of points form a cluster (highest frequency
range) at low Ratio1 and Ratio2 values. In fact, about 85%
of orthologs have Ratio1 and Ratio2 values less than 1. (2)
Some points with higher Ratio1 values are located along a
curve that approaches, and then falls along, the line equation Ratio2 = 1. This is consistent with an unusually high
divergence of a gene from ingroup 2. (3) Conversely,
some points with higher Ratio2 values are located along a
line that is roughly around line equation Ratio1 = 1. This
is consistent with an unusually high divergence for a gene
from ingroup 1. The RBH-predicted orthologous groups
for P. putida-P. syringae-E. coli species show a similar R1 ×
R2 plot (Fig. 6A and 6D). Consistent with the eukaryotic
results, the vast majority of orthologous groups for this
prokaryotic analysis also exhibit Ratio1 and Ratio2 values
less than 1.
We expected most ssd-orthologs to evolve in a similar
manner, and found that most orthologous groups form a
cluster (high frequency range) in an R1 × R2 plot. Therefore, we hypothesized that orthologous groups falling
within the high frequency range are more likely to contain
ssd-orthologs. Conversely, those outside of this range (i.e.
high Ratio1 or Ratio2 values) are more likely to contain,
in an ingroup, either an ortholog that has undergone unusual divergence, or a paralog.
"Higher quality" orthologous groups are found primarily in
"low" Ortholuge ratio ranges, in R1 × R2 plots
The data sets of tentative orthologs predicted above by an
RBH approach will certainly contain genes that are being
falsely identified as orthologs. It is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a dataset of this size that contains only true
orthologs, due to the inherent nature of inference associated with evolutionary study. However, data sets of
"higher" and "lower" quality can be constructed and
examined (see Methods), to observe how their Ortholuge

EGO database (with mouse as the outgroup). The incomplete state of the bovine genome data at the time of this
analysis should lead to more falsely predicted orthologs,
since some true orthologs will be missing from the bovine
dataset (see Fig. 1 for a scenario). These results are shown
in Figure 5C and 5F. Note the higher number of points
with a high Ratio2 value, falling along the line equation
Ratio1 = 1; these points are consistent with how the ratio
would behave if the bovine data contained paralogs that
were notably more divergent than expected for most
orthologs.

(C), respectively, with axes shown from 0 to 2 instead of 0 to

quality data set) exhibit low Ratio1 and Ratio2 values (for
example, all values are less than 1 for the points in the high
quality data set plot), whereas most true-negative groups
exhibit higher Ratio1 and Ratio2 values (i.e. only 9% of
ingroup1 true negative introductions, and 6% of ingroup2
true negative introductions, have points with Ratio1 and
Ratio2 values less than 1).

ratios change in comparison to each other. These data sets
should contain a notably greater or smaller proportion of
true orthologs, respectively.
We therefore examined the behaviour of Ortholuge ratios
for a higher quality data set of probable orthologs.
Curated orthologs between human, mouse, and rat
genomes were acquired from the Mouse Genome Database (MGD). Figure 5B and 5E illustrate that this higher
quality data set occupies a smaller area of the R1 × R2 plot.
This smaller area is observed, even when the number of
points is normalized with the number plotted for the
RBH-based data (data not shown). For this higher quality
(more precise) data set there are notably fewer points
along the Ratio1 = 1 line equation and the Ratio2 = 1 line
in the plot, compared to the RBH-based data plot in Figure 5A and 5D.
Conversely, we examined the ratios associated with a
"lower quality" data set, involving RBH-predicted
orthologs for bovine, human, and mouse, from TIGR's

To gain a sense of the differences in plots of different quality datasets, note that below Ratio1 and Ratio2 values of
1, there lies 97% of high quality dataset points (Fig. 5B),
86% of RBH-predicted ortholog group points (Fig. 5A),
and only 73% of the low quality data set points (Fig. 5C).
These results suggest that true orthologs (or at least more
precise ortholog data sets) tend to fall within the bulk of
the highest frequency range (i.e. relatively "low" Ratio values in an R1 × R2 plot), while orthologs with unusual
divergence patterns (non-ssd-orthologs) and paralogs
have either high Ratio1 or high Ratio2 values.
For the prokaryotic analysis, a higher quality data set was
compared to the RBH-based data set as well. Figure 6A
and 6B illustrate the same trend as the eukaryotic data,
with respect to how the R1 × R2 plots look for more precise and less precise ortholog data sets.
Known paralogs (true-negatives) introduced into
orthologous groups generate either high Ratio1 or high
Ratio2 values, as shown in a gene loss/incomplete genome
simulation
The above comparisons of higher quality (more precise)
and lower quality (less precise) ortholog data sets support
our hypothesis that orthologs and paralogs fall within different regions of the R1 × R2 plot. However, a stronger
argument can be made by examining specifically where
falsely predicted orthologs (true paralogs) occur in such
distributions. A true-negative data set was therefore constructed by removing genes from one of the ingroup gene
data sets and then identifying the next best reciprocal
BLAST hit with the other ingroup (ensuring transitivity of
this introduction with the other ingroup and outgroup).
Therefore a true negative is essentially an ortholog triple
which has been transformed into a false positive by introducing a less similar sequence for one of the species
sequences. These true negatives represent the types of
ortholog predictions that would result from an RBHmethod in scenarios such as Figure 1. Since we know that
RBH can make incorrect predictions when a genome is
incomplete or when gene loss has occurred, this analysis
simulates what would occur with the RBH method in such
cases. The benefit of this analysis is that we specifically

orthologs and should still be falling within the main cluster of true-orthologs, as we observe. In other words, since
the goal of Ortholuge is to improve ortholog identification between the two ingroups, it is beneficial that an outgroup paralog does not generally interfere with/affect the

know the true-negatives introduced, allowing us to examine how the Ortholuge ratios for these true-negatives (paralogs) behave.
For the E. coli-P. putida-P. syringae input ortholog groups,
we constructed two true-negative data sets. In the first, we
replaced P. putida genes with their next best RBH hit to P.
syringae, resulting in ingroup1 paralogs. In the second, we
replaced P. syringae genes with their next best RBH hit to
P. putida, resulting in ingroup2 paralogs. For both, we
conservatively introduced all possible paralogs into the
analysis, resulting in roughly 50% of the genes converted
to true-negatives (i.e. conservative, because most data sets
would never contain this many true-negatives). The
results from these two data sets (Fig. 6C and 6F), show
that these true-negatives overlap very little with the RBHpredicted orthologs (Fig. 6A) or with the high quality
(more precise) orthologs (Fig. 6B). This demonstrates that
even with all possible true paralogs simulated, very few of
them are falling within the higher frequency ranges of the
RBH distributions.
We also constructed a third true-negative data set with all
outgroup genes (E. coli) replaced by their next best RBH
hit to both P. syringae and P. putida. The R1 × R2 plot (Figure 7) shows that these true-negative cases plot at lower
Ratio1 and Ratio2 values and do not separate well from
what would be expected for true-orthologs. This is actually
promising, since in the case of a paralog in an outgroup,

paralogs, can be determined based on an iterative-truenegative analysis
After determining that the introduced true-negatives
almost never fall within certain ratio ranges, it became
clear that ratio cut-offs could be derived to exclude most
true-negatives, and thus improve the specificity (precision) of ortholog prediction. To do this, another strategy
was employed to simulate the introduction of paralogs
(true-negative ortholog predictions) and then formulate
ortholog identification cut-offs. This second strategy,
involving an iterative-true-negative analysis, allows one to
view the variance in proportion of true-negatives in a particular ratio range, and is also amenable to high throughput use for the formulation of cut-offs. For both the
eukaryotic (human-mouse-rat) RBH-predicted data set
(RefSeq-based), and the prokaryotic RBH-predicted data
set, we conservatively modeled an incomplete genome (or
gene loss) scenario by randomly replacing 25% of the
genes in the RBH-predicted data set with the "next best
RBH" hit (i.e. a true-negative). This randomized introduction of true-negatives was iterated at least 50 times, and
each iteration was evaluated by Ortholuge. The proportion of true-negative orthologs was averaged over all iterations and the standard deviation determined. We found
that that once again, the ratio values of true-negative
orthologs do not overlap well with those of the bulk of
RBH-predicted orthologous groups (Figure 8 and Supplemental Figures 1 and 2).

For both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic RBH-based data
sets, this iterative true-negative analysis was used to determine ratio ranges where true paralogs were very unlikely
to land and ranges where they were very likely to land. The
borders of these ranges (described in Figure 8 and Supplemental Figures 1 and 2) became the ratio cut-off values.
This permitted classification of the RBH-predicted tentative orthologous groups into probable ssd-orthologs,
probable paralogs, or "uncertain" categories. It should be
noted that a more accurate name for the 'probable paralog' category might be 'probable non-ssd-ortholog,'
because there may be true orthologs that have undergone
unusual divergence in one ingroup species within this category. However, in such cases the non-ssd-orthologs may
have functionally diverged, and therefore are cases that we
would want to differentiate from our ssd-ortholog set.
Regardless, for ease of comprehension, we propose to call
those cases with very atypical ratios (in the range of what

Example of the generation of cut-offs for classification of ssdorthologs and probable paralogs, based on an iterative-truenegative analysis (i.e. based on an introduction of random
sets of true-negatives). The particular analysis illustrated here
is a Ratio1 analysis for the mouse, rat, human RefSeq RBH
dataset, with true-negatives introduced into the mouse
(ingroup1) set. In panel A, the number of putative orthologous groups in each ratio range for the true-negative-transformed data set is shown for the whole data set (light shaded
bars) and for just the introduced true-negatives only (dark
shaded bars). Note how the distribution of the data set differs from that of the true negatives (i.e. introduced paralogs).
In panel B, the proportion of randomly introduced true-negatives at 0.5 ratio range intervals is used to formulate cut-offs
(denoted by dashed lines) for classifying ssd-orthologs and
probable paralogs for the analysis. For the ssd-orthologs cutoff (left-most dashed line), no more than 10% true negatives
in a given ratio range are permitted for the ssd-orthologs
range. For the probable paralogs cut-off (right-most dashed
line) the proportion of true negatives is at or above 50 percent. The resulting middle region bounded by these two cutoff points establishes the "uncertain" orthology class ratio
range. Dashed-lines denoting these particular cut-offs are
also illustrated on the figure in Panel A for reference. This
approach for a true-negative analysis and cut-off generation is
also performed for Ratio2 [Additional file 1] and the combination of cut-offs for Ratio1 and Ratio2 are used to classify
putative orthologous groups from another data set (such as
an RBH-predicted data set) into the three classification levels
of "probable ssd-ortholog", "uncertain" and "probable paralogs". Panel C schematically shows the areas of an R1 × R2
that would be classified in this way, with the cut-off numbers
in this particular example matching the RefSeq RBH-based
mouse-rat-human analysis (see Table 2 for how these ranges
are numerically determined).

We chose a 25% true-negative introduction, since this is
likely above a worst-case scenario in terms of the number
of genes that may be missing in an incomplete genome, or
most cases of naturally occurring gene loss. We felt it was
important to "saturate" the data set with true-negatives,
because any given RBH-based dataset will likely contain
some proportion of false-positives in the putative orthologous groups (i.e. it is difficult to ensure one has a completely true-positive set of orthologs). Therefore, to
effectively identify the ranges where true-negatives were
becoming increasingly more common we needed to
observe a large proportion of true-negatives. However, we
did not want to transform a data set with all possible truenegatives, as this would not provide a sense of the variation in proportion of true-negatives within a given ratio
range. Note that we also chose to report the results here
for a transformation of an RBH-predicted data set with the
true-negatives (i.e. a RefSeq-based RBH analysis), rather
than a transforming a high quality dataset, since the RefSeq based analysis could be more easily fully automated
(i.e. it did not require developing a curated set of high
quality orthologs). However, transformation of a eukaryotic high quality dataset with true-negatives generated
similar cut-off values (data not shown). Through an iterative sampling approach we were able to generate standard
deviations of the proportion of true-negatives in a given
ratio range (Figure 8B), providing a clearer picture of the
likelihood of a true-negative occurring in that range.
Ortholuge ratios in combination can help predict which
gene in a given putative orthologous group is likely a
paralog
A closer inspection of the Ortholuge ratios shows that
they behave in a predictable fashion when the ortholog
group contains one or more false-positives (Table 1). For
example, if ingroup1 is actually a paralog, then the distance between ingroup1-outgroup and the distance
between ingroup1-ingroup2 would be larger than the
norm for an ssd-ortholog. This would cause Ratio2 to
increase (the degree of increase would depend on how
diverged the paralog is from the missing 'true' ortholog),
and Ratio1 to increase a slighter amount (depending on
how distant the outgroup is). Conversely, if ingroup2 is
actually the paralog, then Ratio1 would be expected to
increase and Ratio2 to increase slightly. These predictable
changes do indeed occur, as illustrated by an analysis of
true-negatives (Figure 6C and 6F), an analysis of a dataset
of tentative orthologs identified by RBH using an incomplete genome (Figure 5C and 5F), and an additional manual review of selected cases (data not shown). We propose
that when unusual ratio ranges are identified for a given
orthologous group, the relative changes can facilitate pre-

However, this has been included in the table solely to illustrate how ortholog paralog cases can be discriminated (using Ratio 3) from cases where

ally similar to each other versus those that have diverged
at different evolutionary rates in each species.

Note that an outgroup paralog cannot be well predicted,
however this does not affect the utility of Ortholuge, since
the method is focused on characterizing the orthology of
the two ingroups. It should also be noted that multipleparalog scenarios (last three rows in Table 1), are more
complex. Though relatively easy to predict on paper, they
are more difficult to distinguish in reality, because the
amount of divergence for the two paralogs may vary
greatly. In most cases they would resemble one of the first
three scenarios, depending on which of the two paralogs
was more diverged. Nevertheless, in the end, these rare
cases (two paralogs in a group of three) will still most frequently display atypical ratios, and will not fall within
probable ortholog cut-offs.

Using the derived ratio cut-offs, we have constructed several data sets of probable ssd-orthologs consisting of:
mouse-rat comparisons (with human as the outgroup),
and one for a P. putida-P. syringae comparison (with E. coli
as the outgroup). These ssd-orthologs are particularly
suited for comparative genomics analyses. In addition,
notations are added to all the data analysed, indicating
cases of probable gene duplication after species divergence ("possible in-paralog") – a scenario that can
increase the likelihood of functional divergence of the
genes. These higher quality sets of orthologs can be found
via the Ortholuge website [28]. The proportion of ssdorthologs in the RBH-predicted data sets is summarized in
Table 2. Note that cases of in-paralogs are not counted
within the counts of ssd-orthologs in Table 2. Such cases,
due to their uncertain potential to have diverged in function because of a gene duplication, are counted within the
"uncertain" category.

Ortholuge in action: an estimation of probable ssdorthologs and probable paralogs in RBH-based data sets
An example of ratio cut-offs generated based on our truenegative analysis is listed in Table 2 (see also Figure 8 and
Supplemental Figures 1 and 2). Researchers are of course
encouraged to choose their own cut-off to suit their needs
(i.e. more sensitivity or specificity). However, based on
our simulations, these cut-offs should effectively differentiate probable orthologs and paralogs for these data sets.
We also propose that these cut-offs can identify those
orthologs most closely following species divergence (i.e.
ssd-orthologs) – orthologs which may be more function-

Using the cut-offs, we were also able to estimate the proportion of RBH-predicted orthologs that are likely paralogs for these eukaryotic and prokaryotic data sets (Table
2; see also data available on the Ortholuge website [28],
which includes a classification of the EGO dataset using
the RefSeq analysis cut-offs). For the prokaryotic data
about 5% of RBH-based predictions are probable paralogs. For the eukaryotic data, about 10% of the RBH-pre-

Page 9 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:270

dictions are probable paralogs. These are significant
numbers that validate the need for a method like
Ortholuge, particularly if one is trying to use RBH-predicted orthologs for downstream analyses that require
stringent ortholog prediction (for example, for regulatory
element detection).
Application of these cut-offs to classify the curated eukaryote and prokaryote datasets suggest that the false negative
rate in is in the range of 0.7% for prokaryote data and 3%
for the eukaryote data.
To facilitate the analysis of other datasets, we have developed Ortholuge software that can be used to characterize
any existing dataset of orthologs. If no pre-existing
ortholog dataset is available, Ortholuge can also construct
such a dataset using an RBH-based approach applied to
whole genome datasets (or other adequate datasets of
genes from three organisms that a user supplies).
Ortholuge was developed using Perl under Linux (SuSE
9.0 and RH 9.0) and operates in any UNIX environment,
provided all the needed tools (see Methods) are available
for the user's operating system. This freely available, open
source, software is available on the Ortholuge website
[28].

Discussion
For cross-genome comparison purposes, researchers often
wish to compare orthologs – in particular orthologs that
have not undergone unusual divergence rates relative to
one another, and have more likely retained similar function. We propose that Ortholuge is an approach, suitable
for high-throughput genome-scale analysis, which aids
identification of such orthologs. The Ortholuge method
significantly improves the specificity/precision of highthroughput RBH-based ortholog analysis. For example,
our results indicate that roughly 1 in 10 RBH-predicted
rat-mouse orthologs are very likely paralogs, and about 1
in 20 RBH-predicted orthologs for two Pseudomonas species are similarly likely incorrect. Note that our RBH analysis requires transitivity between three species, rendering
it more stringent than the typical RBH analysis between
two species. This suggests that the typical RBH analysis
may have an even greater number of false predictions. The
resulting more specific identification of orthologs by
Ortholuge is an important requirement for many downstream analyses, such as identifying gene regulatory
regions, or characterizing differences in microarray-measured gene expression responses across species. An automated method such as Ortholuge is of course no
substitute for a more manual, comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and has some limitations as mentioned
below. However, its simplicity and utility for highthroughput analyses suggest that it is a useful complement
to RBH-based identification of putative orthologs using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/270

whole-genome gene datasets. In addition, Ortholuge's
higher specificity approach can complement other methods that may provide a higher sensitivity/recall approach
for ortholog identification [13].
Ortholuge evaluates orthologs through phylogenetic distance comparisons. To perform such comparisons, an outgroup is required to assist the prediction of orthologs
between the two ingroups – this has simultaneous advantages and disadvantages. The added sequence provides
extra resolution and extra specificity; however, a distant
outgroup may lessen the sensitivity of the approach. Presumably, though, as more genomes are sequenced, the
number of possible outgroups available to choose from
will increase and very distant outgroups will become less
of a problem.
The Ortholuge pipeline generates predictions by evaluating the entire genome at once (or at least adequate gene
representation for the species). The more data points that
are representative of the genome, the more confident the
ratio cut-offs will be. It assumes that the majority of
incoming predictions are true orthologs, will exhibit
expected ratios, and will thus form the high frequency
ranges of the distributions. Our analysis does suggest this
assumption to be reasonable and, notably, both eukaryotic and bacterial orthologs display similar ratio distributions, despite marked differences regarding how such
organisms evolve.
Once the genome-wide predictions are made for a certain
species combination, Ortholuge can be used to estimate
how likely it is that a specific putative orthologous group
contains a true-negative within its ingroups. In such cases,
we can match these ratios with a category (i.e. classification shown in Table 2), to suggest which gene in the
ortholog group is likely to be the paralog. However, it
should be emphasized that at this time we have not
exhaustively examined all possible scenarios, and so such
analysis should be taken as a guide requiring further
investigation. Interestingly, this method also appears to
be useful to examine, in a genome-wide scale, the relationships between species. By examining the ratio values
at the highest frequency ranges in the histograms, one can
easily determine which two of any three organisms are
more similar to each other, on average, and on a genomewide scale (for example, that cattle genes are more similar
to human genes, than mouse genes are to human genes,
on average).
The simplicity of Ortholuge allows for many benefits. For
example, it can easily be re-run when genome annotations
undergo significant changes. In addition, it can easily be
customized with any method of sequence alignment or
phylogenetic distance calculation, depending upon the

relative rate for the species. Such orthologs are likely to have more similar function. See text for details.
c Ratio Range for both Ratio1 (R1) and Ratio2 (R2). See Figure 8C for a schematic illustration of the cut-off ranges on a R1 × R2 plot.
d Proportion of introduced true-negatives for the 25% true-negative analysis is shown here, however the actual number of true-negatives will be
higher due to false-positives likely occurring in the original ortholog dataset. This analysis was used to estimate % false predictions in range (see text
and Figure 8.
e RBH-predicted data sets were examined using the cut-offs generated by the true-negative analysis, to identify what proportion of all RBHpredicted orthologs fell within each range. For the rat-mouse comparison 6294 RefSeq-based groups were classified into "probable ssd-ortholog",
"uncertain", and "probable paralog" classes. For the Pseudomonas comparison, a total of 1456 groups were classified. Note that for an analysis of the
EGO-based rat-mouse data set of 19,200 groups with the same cut-offs, 76% ssd-orthologs and 16% probable paralogs were predicted (when inparalogs were not counted, because of the lack of differentiation of gene isoforms in the EGO data set).
f This "uncertain" category falls between the other two ranges and is graphically illustrated, for ease of understanding, in Figure 8C. This category
follows the formula (R1 > a and R1 < b and R2 < d) or (R2 > c and R2 < d and R1 < a), where a and b are the lower and upper cut-off values,
respectively, for Ratio1 (i.e. lower = cut-off for ssd-orthologs and higher = cut-off for probable paralogs), and c and d are the lower and upper cutoff values, respectively, for Ratio2. Note this "uncertain" category also contains counts of in-paralogs detected (7% of eukaryotic data, and negligible
for prokaryotic data) – see text for details.

researcher's preference. It is expected that further analysis
will reveal relationships between true-negative analyses
and ratio cut-off generation, negating the need to perform
a full iterative-introduced-true-negative analysis for each
species comparison. Of course, users can choose their own
Ortholuge ratio cut-offs, either using a true-negative analysis, or another approach of their choice, for identification
of orthologs at their preferred level of specificity.
Accepting only orthologs in a certain ratio range and discarding the rest will certainly eliminate a small fraction of
true orthologs from the input set. For example, if the
probable paralog cut-offs are applied to the "high quality"
curated prokaryotic and eukaryotic data sets, we eliminate
0.7% and 3% of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic predictions, respectively. However, if the more stringent ssdortholog cut-offs are applied, we eliminate 1.4% and 8%
of the predictions, respectively. While these outliers may
be false-positives in the curated data, they may also be
true orthologs that have undergone unusual divergence in
one ingroup species. For example, if a gene duplication
occurred in one ingroup species after the speciation diver-

gence, the resulting duplicated gene may undergo accelerated evolution [14]. Such scenarios would result in
skewed ratios for true orthologs. However, we propose
that such orthologs with unusual (relative) divergence
may more likely have differing function at some level. In
many genome-wide studies involving comparisons
between species, researchers wish to identify those genes
that are more likely to be functionally equivalent – i.e.
orthologs that did not experience unusual rates of evolution or gene transfer. Ortholuge improves the identification of such "supporting species divergence" ortholog
pairs (i.e. ssd-orthologs).
This is apparently an important issue, as illustrated by
some confusion occurring in the literature regarding the
definition of orthologs. The definition that we, and many
evolutionary biologists use, is the one initially proposed
[1] that describes orthologs as genes that have diverged
due to speciation (rather than due to gene duplication,
which describes paralogs). However, the term ortholog is
increasingly being inferred to mean 'functionally equivalent genes in different species' – a common misconcep-

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:270

tion [15]. While we and others agree that orthologs tend to
have similar function, this is not a requirement for orthology [16]. So, it appears that while many researchers are
identifying orthologs in a genetic or genomic study, what
they really wish to identify is the subset of orthologs that
are specifically functionally equivalent.
Some methods, such as the widely used INPARANOID,
refer to all in-paralogs (i.e. genes created by gene duplication after the species divergence) in the one species as
orthologous to the related gene in the other species. They
do not clearly distinguish between such cases of in-parology and more simple one-to-one orthologous relationships. We believe that such cases should be differentiated
because a duplication event after species divergence may
have led to significant functional divergence of one or
both of the duplicated genes in the one species. In
Ortholuge, cases involving possible in-paralogs are
flagged using a simple analysis that focuses on detecting
the most clear-cut in-paralog cases. For our analysis, we
did apply ratio cutoffs derived using one-to-one ortholog
RBH-based (RefSeq) data to classify a same species (EGO)
data set that includes both one-to-one orthologs and
many-to-many orthologs. However, we recognize a need
to implement more robust procedures that would consider all cases of suspected recent gene duplications in the
analysis (the current method is subject to the limitations
of the initial RBH-based ortholog identification). It would
also be desirable to complement this analysis further by
noting cases of relative gene rearrangement in the input
set of orthologs. Ortholuge in its current form cannot
detect gene rearrangements, however it could potentially
complement other bioinformatics approaches that detect
such rearrangements [17]. Ortholuge could also be
adapted to contain a gene rearrangement analysis that is
customized to its methodology. These additional
ortholog evolutionary scenarios, involving possible inparalogy or gene rearrangements, should be specifically
noted because they cannot be distinguished by examining
Ortholuge distance ratios alone. They require further
study in any comparative analysis, since functional equivalence between the orthologs is less likely.
Regarding the limitations of this method, it should be
emphasized that Ortholuge is limited by the quality of the
initial ortholog-analysis (i.e. RBH can miss cases of trueorthology, and some data sets such as those from EGO are
incomplete and don't clarify which genes are isoforms,
which complicates in-paralog analysis). Ortholuge is also
only as good as the quality of the sequence data being analyzed. We have tested our alignment trimming and masking of regions of lower alignment quality extensively to
improve the critical sequence alignment component of
our method; however, certainly this method will fail if
low quality sequences, with many errors, are used in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/270

analysis. In addition, the top BLAST hit is not necessarily
the nearest neighbour [18] and so true orthologs may be
missed when using Ortholuge after initially identifying
orthologs with an RBH-based approach. Ortholuge could
therefore improve if the initial ortholog prediction
method is improved (it should be emphasized that
Ortholuge can be used with any input dataset of proposed
orthologs deduced by any current or future ortholog prediction methodology – not just the ones presented).
Regardless of any limitations, Ortholuge appears to effectively improve the specificity of ortholog identification
and is suitable for high-throughput, genome-wide use.
Given the amount of genomics data being obtained at this
time, such specific, high-throughput approaches will
become increasingly necessary, as genomics research
moves further toward more multi-genome comparative
analyses.

Conclusion
Ortholuge improves the specificity of ortholog identification and is suitable for high-throughput use. This precise
ortholog prediction method complements other ortholog
prediction methods that are not focused on precision and
it potentially identifies those orthologs most likely to be
functionally similar. The Ortholuge method provides
important data set evaluation for a variety of analyses
based on comparative approaches, including gene function prediction, prediction of conserved regulatory elements, and comparative analysis of gene order or gene/
protein expression data.

Methods
Data sets
1. Eukaryotic Gene Orthologs (EGO) RBH data set
EGO release 8 database was obtained from The Institute
of Genomic Research (TIGR) [5]. This database is composed of two files: 1) one file housing ortholog identifiers
and tentative consensus sequence (TC) identifiers and 2)
a second file TC sequences in FASTA format. Both files
were used to extract and create 19,200 unique mouse, rat,
human tentative ortholog gene sets files (TOGs) for
Ortholuge analysis.
2. Eukaryotic curated orthologs ("high quality" MGD dataset)
The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is a comprehensive,
high-quality database which currently includes orthology
information for mouse, human, rat, and 14 other mammals [19]. Orthology annotations are manually curated
from scientific literature and each orthology assertion is
based on criteria recommended by the Human Genome
Organisation (HUGO).

A program was developed to extract the orthologous gene
pairs from the MGD Sybase database for two species tri-

Page 12 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:270

ples: 1) mouse, rat, human 2) cattle, human, mouse. All
relevant human, mouse, and rat RefSeq [20] mRNA
sequences and protein sequences were obtained from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
FTP site along with the Locus Link RefSeq mappings file.
FASTA-formatted ortholog sets for those ortholog pairs
were created that satisfied a transitive, triple ortholog relationship and had corresponding RefSeq sequences annotated with a reviewed or validated status. 2642 mouse, rat,
human mRNA, 2499 mouse, rat, human protein, and 427
cattle, human, mouse mRNA ortholog sets were created.
3. Eukaryotic Gene Orthologs (EGO) "lower quality" RBH set
Cattle, human, and mouse ortholog groups, totaling
16,134 in number, were extracted from the EGO release 8
database. The cattle genome was incomplete at this time
and thus we expected more incorrectly predicted
orthologs by the RBH method (see Fig. 1 for the scenario).
4. Eukaryotic RefSeq-based RBH ortholog set
The species-specific mouse, rat, human RefSeq files were
obtained from the NCBI FTP site and BLAST databases [2]
were constructed for each file. A pairwise blastall analysis
was performed between each species enforcing a 10e-04 E
value cut-off. 6294 ortholog FASTA-formatted sets were
created from transitive, best-hit mRNA RefSeqs. We
allowed one unique best-hit isoform per Locuslink ID in
the RBH dataset.
5. Eukaryotic RBH Tentative Consensus (TC) ortholog set involving
cattle
A higher-quality, non-redundant RBH TC dataset was
established using the cattle, human, and mouse tentative
sequences found in the EGO release 8 database. The transitive, triple reciprocal top best BLAST hit for each unique
cattle TC was used to form 15,660 ortholog groups. This
approach served to reduce the over-representation of TC's
found in the currently established set of EGO tentative
ortholog groups (TOGs) due to the allowance of multiple
RBH relationships within a specified cut-off.
6. Bacterial RBH-predicted data sets
Protein sequences of Escherichia coli K12 [10], Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato str. DC3000 [11], and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 [12] were obtained from NCBI.
For the RBH analysis, first a BLASTp was performed
between all pair-wise combinations, with an E-value cutoff of 10e-04. Genes that retained a transitive reciprocal
best hit property and passed the BLAST cut-off were
retained. There were 1456 ortholog groups constructed.
7. Bacterial higher quality orthologs
A set of higher quality orthologs was constructed from a
set provided by Lerat et al [21], who found all the gene
families in 13 gamma-proteobacteria genomes that had

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/270

exactly one gene per species. For simplicity, we chose
those that had annotated gene names in each of our three
chosen bacterial species. Initially, there were 156 ortholog
groups, and of these 143 ortholog groups passed our automated alignment editing stage.
8. OrthoMCL eukaryote ortholog dataset
The OrthoMCL database files were downloaded [22] and
a set of mouse-rat-human ortholog triples were extracted
from the OrthoMCL clusters to construct ortholog triples.
These predicted ortholog groups were analyzed using the
Ortholuge analysis software.

Through our analyses, we observed that the use of nucleotide sequences provided better resolution for these particular sets of eukaryotic data, at the level of divergence
being examined using Ortholuge (see Figure 4 of [Additional file 1]), whereas protein sequences provided better
resolution for the particular bacterial data we were analyzing (data not shown). Consequently, all analyses below
were performed using nucleotide sequences for eukaryote
analysis and protein sequences for the given prokaryote
analysis.
Ortholuge analysis pipeline
The input parameters for Ortholuge include a list of tentative ortholog species groups with sets of FASTA-formatted
sequences for each respective gene/protein in the tentative
orthologs set. A flowchart overview of this pipeline can be
seen in Figure 2. If ortholog groups have not been predetermined, the Ortholuge software we developed is capable of calculating an initial list of tentative orthologous
groups, using the RBH approach. In this latter case, the
input required is a FASTA-formatted list of sequences
from genes predicted in three genomes to be examined
(two sequences to be compared, one reference sequence
as an outgroup). Note that whole-genome data does not
necessarily need to be used, however the dataset should be
large enough to ensure that the distribution of relative
evolutionary distances will centre around what is likely
the true median for the relative evolutionary distance for
the given organisms being examined.
1. Sequence alignments
Initial alignments of the genes/proteins for each tentative
ortholog group are generated using CLUSTALW [23] with
either DNA or PROTEIN alignment options. All other
parameters are default.
2. Automated alignment editing
All alignment overhangs and poly-A tails are removed in
each aligned set of sequences. An alignment must be
aligned over 300 base pairs (bp) or 100 amino acids (aa)
or it is discarded from the analysis. This choice of threshold was based on previous studies that have suggested that

it is more likely that a sequence codes for a protein if its
length is over 100 amino acids [24].

vided to facilitate viewing data in low ranges in this
format).

Gap masking is performed to remove ambiguously
aligned gap-flanking regions. A sample of RBH-predicted
ortholog sequence sets were examined to identify both
gaps introduced by misalignments and gaps introduced
through sequence insertions and deletions. Gap-masking
simulations using various window length intervals were
applied to the aligned sequences to establish a gap-masking approach. Our approach entails running a sliding 25base pair window over the aligned sequences in both
directions to assess gap percentages exceeding a 40% gap
threshold. The window size and gap threshold were chosen such that overlapping windows exceeding the gap
threshold would produce a worst-case gap masked region
of 49 base pairs.

True-negative introduction analyses
Mean/iterative true-negative analysis
For the eukaryotic RefSeq-based RBH ortholog dataset, a
selected proportion of the ortholog sets were randomly
transformed to true-negative ortholog sets and then run
through the Ortholuge analysis. We report here the results
for a 25% transformation of the data, though other percentages were examined (data not shown). To do this
transformation (introduction of true-negatives), the full
set of mouse, rat, and human RefSeq sequence files were
obtained from NCBI and a pairwise best-hits list was created using a pairwise blastall analysis with a 10e-4 E-value
cut-off. An orthologous set was transformed to a true-negative by replacing one of the species sequences with
another sequence that had a greater (next highest) BLAST
expect value and which still satisfied a reciprocal and transitive best BLAST hit with the two other sequences in the
orthologous set. In essence, we were removing an RBHpredicted ortholog and identifying another gene that
could satisfy an RBH relationship. This essentially simulated what could happen if a gene was lost in one genome,
or a genome sequence was incomplete, by removing a
gene from a proposed ortholog "triple" and determining
what the next RBH relationship would be for the remaining genes in the triple. Care was taken to ensure that the
set of original sequences in the higher quality set being
transformed initially satisfy an RBH relationship. Furthermore, the algorithm mandated that the non-orthologous
replacement is not an isoform of the replaced sequence.
Each transformed dataset was then run through the
Ortholuge analysis. Such true-negative transformations
were iteratively performed 50 to 100 times for each truenegative percentage proportion. A mean true-negative
value and standard deviation for each ratio value in the
distribution could then be calculated. Note that this same
approach was also used to perform an iterative true-negative analysis for other eukaryotic data sets, and the
prokaryotic data.

Both the trimming and gap-masking methods were evaluated for the introduction of ratio distribution biases by
selected alignment characteristics. Selected characteristics
of both trimmed and gap masked alignments were
recorded and analyzed to determine whether the automated alignment editing process had created a ratio distribution bias for certain alignment characteristics. These
characteristics included: number of aligned base pairs,
identity over aligned length, identity over left and right
ends, proportion of gaps over full length, proportion of
gaps over left and right ends. Here we defined end length
as MIN(.25 * alignment length, 150 bp/50aa). See also
Figure 3.
3. Sequence distances and calculation of Ortholuge ratios
The EDNADIST or EPROTDIST programs of EMBOSS [25]
and PHYLIP 3.6 [26] software, respectively, were used to
compute the nucleotide or protein distances. We opted to
analyze our data using the Kimura distance formula due
to its simplicity and computational efficiency. We used a
conservative transition/transversion rate of 2 as an
approximation, although studies do suggest that transition/transversion rates are context dependent [27]. All
other parameters were defaults. The phylogenetic distances were used to compute the three ratios, Ratio1,
Ratio2, and Ratio3, as described in Figure 2.

Ratios are then displayed manually in two forms: Histograms and as R1 × R2 plots. The ratio frequencies are enumerated for a given interval and histograms are
constructed for all three ratios, visually displaying the
ratio frequencies of tentative orthologous groups within a
ratio of 2.5. The R1 × R2 plots are comprised of an x-y plot
of Ratio1 versus Ratio2 which facilitates visualization of
the full ratio distribution range (though zoomed in versions of these plots up to ratio values of 2.0 are also pro-

The true-negative mean and standard deviations were analyzed to establish conservative ratio cut-offs and estimate
false-positive proportions. A three-level classification system for true mean false-positive values over defined ratio
intervals was derived from this analysis (see "Establishing
Cut-offs" Method's section, below). The number of ratios
in a given set falling into each level (i.e. "probable ssdortholog", "uncertain", and "probable paralog" classes)
was counted.

True-negative introduction in the bacterial set – an introduction of all
possible true-negatives
For the bacterial RBH-predicted data set, P. syringae genes
(ingroup2) were replaced with their next best reciprocal
BLAST hit to P. putida (within a 10e-4 E value cut-off),
wherever possible. 668 out of 1456 ortholog triples were
transformed into true-negative triples for this dataset.
There are no iterations necessary here, so the transformed
data set was then run through Ortholuge once.
Establishing cut-offs for Ortholuge-predicted "probable
paralogs", uncertain, and probable ssd-orthologs
Researchers are of course encouraged to use the above
true-negative analysis to formulate their own cut-offs,
since cut-offs of differing levels of sensitivity and specificity are possible. In our example analysis, we examined
the iterative/mean true-negative analysis for a eukaryotic
and prokaryotic dataset using a histogram and examined
the data in terms of the proportion of introduced truenegatives identified in each ratio range. These percentages
are used to aid in identifying cut-offs for more specific
(precise) identification of probable orthologs (or ssdorthologs) and probable paralogs. We examined the trend
manually, and opted to identify "probable ssd-orthologs"
as those occurring in ratio ranges where there were, on
average, only between 0–10% introduced true-negatives
(out of the total number of tentative orthologous groups
in the range; see Results, Figure 8). Tentative orthologous
groups falling in ratio ranges that contained between 10 to
50% introduced true-negatives (on average) were classified as orthology "uncertain". Finally, groups falling in
ratio ranges that contained greater than 50% introduced
true-negatives were classified as "Probable paralog". We
chose this cut-off because it was at this point that the transition from few introduced true-negatives in a range, to
mostly introduced true-negatives in a range, increased significantly. Note that at this point there will also likely be
some true-negatives occurring in the analyzed dataset (as
illustrated also by our "higher quality" data set analyses),
and so the actual proportion of true-negatives at this probable paralog cut-off point will likely be much higher. As
mentioned in the results, we opted to perform this analysis on completely automated RBH data (RefSeq-based),
rather than high quality data, since we appear to be able
to obtain meaningful results, while being able to take
advantage of the automated nature of RBH data set generation. However, we did also perform this analysis on the
high quality data set, and on any EGO data set, generating
comparable results.
Identification of in-paralogs
For those tentative orthologs predicted by Ortholuge to be
ssd-orthologs (and also for other classes as well, in case
researchers wish to use other cut-offs), we performed an
additional analysis to identify cases of in-paralogy that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/270

may affect the possible functional equivalence of the ssdorthologs (see the Introduction for a discussion of this
issue). To do this, we combined both ingroup species'
sequences into one database and performed a BLAST analysis using all the individual sequences from each of the
ingroup species as a query. We then identified individual
sequence cases in which top hits (other than a query
sequence self-hit) were to another sequence in its own
species. If the bit score for this same-species hit was greater
than the bit score for the other species hit, then the case
was flagged as an in-paralog candidate (ie. a gene duplication may have occurred after the speciation, potentially
affecting the function of the ssd-ortholog). Any such inparalog cases were classified under the "uncertain" category, unless they had been classified, according to a
Ratio1 and Ratio2 analysis, as belonging to the "probable
paralog" category (in the latter case they would remain in
the probable paralogs category). Note that this analysis
only identifies a proportion of all cases – in particular very
clear cut cases. It does not identify all possible in-paralogs
and researchers are encouraged to investigate any such
cases more thoroughly.
