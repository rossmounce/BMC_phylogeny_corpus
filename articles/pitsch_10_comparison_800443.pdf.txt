Abstract
Background: Oxygenic photosynthesis is accompanied by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
damage proteins, lipids, DNA and finally limit plant yield. The enzymes of the chloroplast antioxidant system are
exclusively nuclear encoded. During evolution, plastid and mitochondrial genes were post-endosymbiotically
transferred to the nucleus, adapted for eukaryotic gene expression and post-translational protein targeting and
supplemented with genes of eukaryotic origin.
Results: Here, the genomes of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the moss Physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte
Selaginella moellendorffii and the seed plant Arabidopsis thaliana were screened for ORFs encoding chloroplast peroxidases.
The identified genes were compared for their amino acid sequence similarities and gene structures. Stromal and thylakoidbound ascorbate peroxidases (APx) share common splice sites demonstrating that they evolved from a common ancestral
gene. In contrast to most cormophytes, our results predict that chloroplast APx activity is restricted to the stroma in
Chlamydomonas and to thylakoids in Physcomitrella. The moss gene is of retrotransposonal origin.
The exon-intron-structures of 2CP genes differ between chlorophytes and streptophytes indicating an independent
evolution. According to amino acid sequence characteristics only the A-isoform of Chlamydomonas 2CP may be
functionally equivalent to streptophyte 2CP, while the weakly expressed B- and C-isoforms show chlorophyte specific
surfaces and amino acid sequence characteristics. The amino acid sequences of chloroplast PrxII are widely conserved
between the investigated species. In the analyzed streptophytes, the genes are unspliced, but accumulated four
introns in Chlamydomonas. A conserved splice site indicates also a common origin of chlorobiont PrxQ.
The similarity of splice sites also demonstrates that streptophyte glutathione peroxidases (GPx) are of common origin.
Besides a less related cysteine-type GPx, Chlamydomonas encodes two selenocysteine-type GPx. The latter were lost
prior or during streptophyte evolution.
Conclusion: Throughout plant evolution, there was a strong selective pressure on maintaining the activity of all three
investigated types of peroxidases in chloroplasts. APx evolved from a gene, which dates back to times before
differentiation of chlorobionts into chlorophytes and streptophytes, while Prx and presumably also GPx gene patterns
may have evolved independently in the streptophyte and chlorophyte branches.

Background
Oxygenic photosynthesis leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen (1O2)
and superoxide anions (O2-) [1]. The latter are rapidly
converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [2]. H2O2 is scavenged by low molecular weight antioxidants, such as
ascorbate and glutathione [1]. More efficiently, it is enzymatically inactivated by peroxidases [2-4]. Inside chloroplasts, the main peroxidases are ascorbate peroxidases
(APx), peroxiredoxins (Prx) and glutathione peroxidases
(GPx) [2-5].
Cyanobacteria are the closest relatives of the prokaryotic evolutionary ancestors of plastids. Like chloroplasts,
they already protected themselves against the photooxygenic pressure of photosynthesis by the activity of APx,
Prx and GPx [3,6-10]. In addition, many cyanobacteria
encode a bifunctional ascorbate peroxidase-catalase
(APx-Cat), which was not maintained in plants.
In seed plants, APx, GPx and Prx are the major plastid
H2O2 scavenging enzymes [2,11,12]: APx reduce H2O2 at
the thylakoid membrane and in the chloroplast stroma on
the expense of ascorbate [11]. In parallel, GPx [12] and
three types of peroxiredoxins, namely 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (2CP), peroxiredoxins Q (PrxQ) and type-II peroxiredoxins (PrxII) [13,14], protect chloroplasts against H2O2
and alkyl hydroperoxides via thiol-mediated reaction
mechanisms [15-17]: 2CP, PrxII and GPx are stromal proteins [12-14,18], while PrxQ are targeted to the thylakoid
lumen [19].
During plant evolution, the photosynthetic endosymbiont lost all its genes for antioxidant enzymes from its
genome. Prior and during this process, the antioxidant
enzymes were replaced by nuclear encoded homologs.
The gene products are post-translationally targeted to
chloroplasts [13,20,21]. The targeting signal is encoded in
a N-terminal transit peptide [20-22]. The chloroplast isoforms of APx, GPx and PrxII have cytosolic counterparts
[4,13,17,23], while in higher plants 2CP and PrxQ are
exclusively found in chloroplasts [19,21]. Plant GPx show
a high sequence similarity to animal GPx4, suggesting an
eukaryotic origin [17]. For GPx of Arabidopsis, rice and
barley, Margis et al. [17] postulated common origin of the
genes encoding plastid and extra-plastidic isoforms. Paralogs evolved by gene duplication and subsequent genespecific mutations. According to Margis et al. [17], the
initial duplication took place at least before the emergence of gymnosperms.
In contrast, 2CP have been postulated to be of endosymbiotic origin [21]. In general, it is very likely that the
chloroplast antioxidant protection system was arranged
by combination of genes inherited by the heterotrophic
eukaryotic ancestor cell of plants and of organellar origin.
During more than one billion years of evolution, plants

have faced strong environmental changes, such as longand short-term temperature and light changes and variation of water, CO2 and O2 availability. The variable environment has challenged and shaped the antioxidant
defense systems via influencing photosynthesis and photooxidative ROS formation.
Here, the chloroplast peroxidase system was compared
in four model organisms, for which (almost) full genome
information is available. The selected species represent
different steps in chlorobiont evolution. We screened
EST and genomic databases of the unicellular green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Volvocales, Chlorophyta),
the moss Physcomitrella patens (Funariales, Bryophytina,
Streptophyta) and the spike moss Selaginella moellendorffii (Selaginellales, Lycopodiophytina, Streptophyta)
for open reading frames (ORFs) encoding chloroplast targeted APx, GPx and Prx.
Chlamydomonas belongs to the group of Chlorophyceae within the chlorophyte branch of Chlorobionta. The
unicellular alga with one large chloroplast per cell, still
forms phycoplasts instead of phragmoplasts upon cell
division [24]. In the streptophyte branch, mosses, such as
the ancestors of Physcomitrella, evolved approximately
500 million years ago and separated from cormophytes
[25]. Within the cormophytes, the spike mosses diverted
from the lineage of seed plant precursors approximately
400 million years ago [26].
Based on genome comparisons it will be shown that
there has been a permanent selective pressure on the
maintenance of APx, GPx and Prx activity in chloroplasts
despite changes in the suborganellar distribution and in
the gene copy number. Comparison of gene structures
will indicate common or independent origins.

Results
Genome resources at JGI http://www.jgi.doe.gov, TAIR
http://www.arabidopsis.org, Cosmoss http://www.cosmoss.org and ChlamyDB http://www.chlamy.org provide
automatically generated and annotated gene models for
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Physcomitrella patens,
Selaginella moellendorffii and Arabidopsis thaliana based
on bioinformatic gene-predictions and improvement by
BLAST-comparison of genomic DNA with EST data
resources [27]. The automated approaches have two disadvantages: Firstly, if the sequence similarity of genes is
high, the same ESTs can align to all genes and pretend
expressional activity of various similar genes, even if only
one gene is active. Secondly, due to the low sequence similarity of transit peptides even between related organisms,
organelle targeting signals and terminal membrane
anchors are often not recognized [28]. Sequence analysis
then easily results in wrong predictions for protein localization.

In this study we aimed at the genome-wide identification and annotation of genes encoding chloroplast peroxidases, namely APx, GPx and Prx, in distantly related
model organisms. The chlorobionts Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, Physcomitrella patens and Selaginella
moellendorffii were compared to the reference seed plant
Arabidopsis thaliana and the sequences were evaluated
with respect to function and localization. The analysis
follows up with previous comparison of gene families
[13,17,23], focusing on the composition of the chloroplast
antioxidant system.
Primary data mining for chloroplast APx, Prx and GPx

To minimize the difficulties of sequence homology-based
genome annotation, data mining was started with screening Selaginella moellendorffii, Physcomitrella patens and
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii EST databases for sequences
with similarity to cDNAs encoding Arabidopsis thaliana
APx, GPx and Prx using BLASTN and TBLASTX [29]. In
this step all information was collected irrespective of the
localization of the encoded proteins. Subsequently, the
collected ESTs were clustered by ClustalW2.0 based on
nucleotide sequence similarity.
These first clusters indicated 7, 20 and 11 APx for Chlamydomonas, Physcomitrella and Selaginella, respectively,
and 3, 3 and 3 2CP, 1, 3 and 2 PrxQ and 3, 5 and 3 PrxII
and 9, 8 and 10 GPx (data not shown). To analyze the primary datasets for gene duplication and alternative splicing all non-perfectly matching EST sequences were
removed from the EST assembly. The excluded ESTs
were subsequently re-tested for their similarity to other
or additional EST clusters.
From each refined cluster, the consensus sequence was
predicted from the sequence alignment and was used as a
working model for a gene-specific class of transcripts. To
test whether the particular consensus encodes a peroxidase, the amino acid sequences were compared with the
amino acid sequences of characterized Arabidopsis proteins [13,14,17,22,30,31].
Finally, the genomes of Chlamydomonas, Physcomitrella and Selaginella were screened by sequence similarity based on TBLASTX analysis for so far not identified
paralogs and pseudogenes. This analysis resulted in 22
additional putative peroxidase sequences (data not
shown). The collected set of sequence data was subsequently evaluated with respect of chloroplast targeting.
N- and C-terminus prediction

Our study specifically focused on identification of genes
encoding chloroplast APx, GPx and Prx. EST-assembly
and EST-alignment-based sequence retrieval and prediction resulted in various sequences with atypical start or
stop codons indicating that the sequences lack information on the protein C- and N-termini, such as N-terminal

Page 3 of 30

organellar targeting signals and C-terminal membrane
anchors, or that the ESTs reflect incomplete or wrong
splicing or genomic contaminations of the EST libraries.
The nucleotide and amino acid sequence conservation
of N-terminal targeting signals and Cterminal membrane
anchors are often low between species, because the
encoded protein domains are mainly structurally conserved [28]. To overcome this detriment, BLASTN
searches in EST databases were performed with the 5'and 3'- ends of the previously retrieved cluster consensus
sequences in the third round of data mining. All newly
collected ESTs were tested for their cluster compatibility
by BLASTN sequence comparison. From the refined
EST-clusters, the hypothetical cluster consensus cDNA
was calculated using the ClustalW2.0 multiple sequence
alignment tool [32].
For all remaining EST clusters without N-terminal
transit peptides, the genomic DNA was screened 2000 bp
upstream of the EST covered regions for transcriptional
start sites and/or additional exons by DBTSS [33] and
FEX [34] (data not shown). In parallel, since identification
of N-terminal targeting signals turned out to be the most
difficult step, the three reading frames of the 2000 bp
upstream genomic sequences were translated into amino
acid sequences and screened for sequence criteria indicating organellar targeting sequences [28]. Special attention was given to the ratio of hydroxylated and positively
charged amino acid residues.
Similarly, 2000 bp downstream of all predicted APx
sequences, the respective genomic DNA was screened for
transmembrane helices by PredictProtein [35] and
retested by TMHMM [36], TMPro [37] and WHEEL
http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~cmg/Demo/wheel/wheel_
instructions.html following three frame translation. For
any sequence indicating a putative N-terminal or C-terminal extension the EST databases were screened by
BLASTN for so far not identified ESTs.
Finally, any predicted chloroplast peroxidase was
scanned for its chloroplast targeting probability using
TargetP and ATP. These prediction algorithms base on
sequence patterns of chloroplast proteins from higher
plants (TargetP; [38]) and Physcomitrella (ATP; [39]). In
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii a single large chloroplast
almost completely surrounds the nucleus. As shown e.g.
for LHCII and RbcS, which are post-translationally targeted to chloroplasts by strong N-terminal targeting signals in higher plants [40], protein targeting frequently
takes place by localized cytoplasmic mRNA translation
and demands for less strong chloroplast targeting signals
[41]. Consequently, the cut-off values were evaluated for
Chlamydomonas based on sequence characteristics
(Table 1). Finally, the deduced and validated sequences
tags were aligned with the clustered ESTs to predict the
full length cDNAs, which were translated into amino acid

sequences and compared with genomic DNA. For the
four species, sequence analysis resulted in prediction of
49 ORFs encoding chloroplast Prx, GPx or APx. For 37
ORFs gene-specific ESTs were observed. The 12 remaining ORFs may be silent pseudogenes, only weakly
expressed or expressed only at certain times or in
response to specific stimuli.
Comparison of predicted sequences with data resources of
PeroxiBase

Finally the predicted sequences were compared with PeroxiBase [42], which is a novel database summarizing ESTassembly based predictions for plant peroxidases of various cellular compartments. For 22 of the here described
45 ORFs (Table 1), entries are listed in PeroxiBase (Table
1).
While the coverage of Arabidopsis, Physcomitrella and
Chlamydomonas chloroplast peroxidases was good in
PeroxiBase, all except two of the chloroplast peroxidases
of Selaginella moellendorffii were newly predicted in our
study (Table 1). In addition, one notlisted (possibly silent)
Chlamydomonas ORF was described and two Physcomitrella PrxII were newly predicted (Table 1). Based on our
EST-assembly analysis the N-termini of one Physcomitrella chloroplast APx (PeroxiBase-Entry 2497) and of
one Selaginella 2CP (PeroxiBase-Entry 6217) were cor-

rected (Table 1). Furthermore, for a Physcomitrella 2CP
(PeroxiBase-Entry 6396), which is encoded by an incompletely assembled genome domain in Cosmoss, the C-terminus was extended by combination of sequence
information split on two sequencing units. Additionally,
so far not covered short sequence traces were inserted in
the PpPrxQC (PeroxiBase-entry 6324) and CrsAPxB
(PeroxiBase-entry 2286) sequences and the sequence
translation was corrected for the Chlamydomonas GPxA
ORF by addition of missing G137 (Table 1).
From this study, 10 ORFs for chloroplast peroxidases
were predicted for the each of the two sequenced haplotypes of Selaginella moellendorffii, 11 chloroplast peroxidase ORFs for Physcomitrella patens and 10 for
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Table 1). They were compared to six well described Arabidopsis chloroplast peroxidases [5,13,14,19,20,22]. Specific characteristics of the
here predicted chloroplast peroxidases are:
Ascorbate peroxidases
Gene copy number and predicted protein localization

Many higher plants encode two types of chloroplast
ascorbate peroxidases: One is localized in the stroma
(sAPx) and one anchored in the thylakoid membrane by a
C-terminal transmembrane helix (tAPx) [11,20]. In our

study, the predicted chloroplast APx sequences were subclassified into membrane anchored and soluble isoforms
based on TMHMM [36] and TMPro analysis for transmembrane helices [37]. The lipophilicity of the outer
helix surface was tested by WHEEL-analysis.
In Arabidopsis thaliana stromal and thylakoid ascorbate peroxidases are encoded by two distinct genes,
At4g08390 (sAPx) and At1g77490 (tAPx) [20]. In contrast, e.g. in tobacco, spinach and pumpkin stromal and
thylakoid ascorbate peroxidases result from alternative
splicing of the same gene [20,43,44]. In rice, the sAPx
gene triplicated (OsAPx5 - 7; [45]), while there is only one
gene encoding a tAPX (OsAPx8). The comparison demonstrates dynamics in the gene copy number over time.
After removal of the extraplastidic isoforms, EST analysis of two haplotypes of Selaginella moellendorffii
resulted in four clusters encoding chloroplast APx. Two
clusters encode sAPx and two tAPx with C-terminal
transmembrane helices. The sequences within each pair
differ only in 7 - 9 bp. Comparison of the gene environment revealed that the predicted sequences are surrounded by the same genes. Thus, the predicted similar
consensus cDNAs represent homologous genes from the
two haplotypes, of which genomic DNA was extracted for
sequencing [46]. It is concluded that each haplotype
encodes one stromal (SmsAPx) and one thylakoid APx
(SmtAPx) (Table 1).
In contrast to the phanerophytes Arabidopsis and
Selaginella, the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens encodes
only one APx (Table 1). The amino acid composition of
the C-terminal extension gives strong indications for a 22
amino acid long transmembrane helix (probability =
82.8% according to TMHMM; position aa417-aa440 in the
441 amino acid long pre-protein; aa458 - aa480 in fig. 1A),
demonstrating that the only ascorbate peroxidase is a
tAPx. In the NCBI database the sequence tag is annotated
as sAPx (BQ042082) because the automated prediction
lacks the sequence information on the transmembrane
anchor. Alignment of ESTs gave no indication for alternative splicing (data not shown), demonstrating that in Physcomitrella all chloroplast APx activity is thylakoidbound and that the moss does not encode a sAPx.
On the contrary, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii expresses
only a sAPx (CrsAPxA). TMHMM- [36] and AmphipaSeeK-screens [47] for transmembrane helices were negative (data not shown). In the Chlamydomonas genome, a
second ORF for a putative soluble APx (CrsAPxB) was
observed. However, CrsAPxB is not covered by ESTs.
Comparison of the stromal domain of the mature proteins (aa134 - aa406 in fig. 1A) separates the two Chlamydomonas APx sequences in a species-specific manner
(Fig. 1B and additional files 1 and 2). CrsAPxA clusters
with chloroplast APx. In contrast, for CrsAPxB only
homologues from fungi and non-green algae (non-chlo-

Page 7 of 30

robionts) were reported in PeroxiBase. According to
sequence homology, CrsAPxB is classified as a hybrid
ascorbatecytochrome c peroxidase (Entry 2286; Table 1).
In addition to the two Chlamydomonas APx reported
here, PeroxiBase lists a third APx with similarities to
putative chloroplast APx for Chlamydomonas (ID 2805).
We excluded the gene in our EST-assembly analysis,
because parts of the catalytic site, e.g. aa322 - aa380 (numbers relative to alignment shown in fig. 1A) are strongly
modified in the algal protein indicating that the enzyme
has no ascorbate peroxidase function.
Exon-intron structure

Evolution primarily selects for the functionality of proteins. Most non-sense mutations get discarded. Intron
insertions, deletions and splice site shifts can be tolerated
more easily. Consequently, analysis of gene structures can
reveal additional information on the phylogenetic relationship between genes of different organisms [47].
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the coding sequence of sAPX
is split into 10 exons and the tAPX is encoded by 12 exons
(Fig. 2. Nine splice sites are conserved demonstrating that
the two APx genes are of common origin. The stopcodon of sAPx is replaced by a glutamate codon in
AttAPx and the open reading frame extents into an additional exon (exon 12; Fig. 2). This exon encodes the 22
amino acids long C-terminal transmembrane helix. In
AttAPx an additional intron is inserted in the 0-position
of the codon for aa135 (numbers according to the position
in fig. 1A). This intron is missing in AtsAPx (Fig. 2).
The exon-intron-structure of Selaginella tAPx resembles that of Arabidopsis tAPx in both haplotypes. The
splice sites are widely conserved to Arabidopsis tAPx
from the second site onwards (Fig. 2). Like in AttAPx, the
sequence encoding aa82 - aa209 (Fig. 1A) is split into two
exons (Fig. 2). The similar gene structure indicates that
SmtAPx, SmsAPx and AttAPx evolved very likely from a
common ancestor gene. As species-specific variation, the
introns are all shorter in Selaginella than in Arabidopsis.
Compared to AtsAPx, SmsAPx has an extended acidic
and hydroxylated C-terminus (DESTS; aa406-aa410 in Fig.
1A). Its sequence shows no homology to the C-terminus
of any tAPx or sAPx listed in PeroxiBase (data not shown)
or in enzymes identified in our analysis (Fig. 1A) and,
consequently, is a specific extension of SmsAPx.
In the green alga Chlamydomonas the two sAPx genes
have 10 exons each (Fig. 2). The introns were much longer than in AtsAPx. In total, the difference in intron
length increases the size of the genes by a factor of 1.5 - 2.
In CrsAPxA, from the third exon downstream, four splice
sites are conserved with Arabidopsis thaliana APx and
two differ only in one codon length (Fig. 2). For CrsAPxB,
the gene structure analysis revealed only one conserved
splice site (aa366-0) (Fig. 2) confirming the less related
nature of the gene.

PptAPx, which is the only chloroplast APx of Physcomitrella patens, has the most atypical gene structure within
the group of analyzed genes. The PptAPx hnRNA has
only one splice site. It is located approximately in the mid
of the transcript at the non-conserved position 273-1
(relative to the amino acid position depicted in Fig. 1A)
(Fig. 2). The GC-content of the PptAPx transcript is with
52.0% increased if compared to AttAPx transcript (46.3%)
and to the average GC-content of Physcomitrella genes
(31.7 - 47.7%; [48]). The PptAPx gene is flanked by large
footprints of Angela LTR retrotransposons http://
www.cosmoss.org, indicating that the only APx gene of
Physcomitrella encoding a plastid isoform is of retrotransposonal origin and not directly related to the
described APx genes from the other analyzed species.
Expression analysis

To test the predicted APx genes for expression and the
predicted transcript length, RNA was isolated from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Selaginella moellendorffii and
Physcomitrella patens and transcribed into cDNA. Subsequently, the cDNAs were tested for sAPx or tAPx expression by saturating PCR (40 cycles at optimal temperature)

Page 8 of 30

with primers binding to the gene specific sequences
encoding the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the
mature protein. With all samples single products with
predicted lengths of 888 bp for CrsAPxA, 900 bp for
CrsAPxB, 1073 bp for PptAPx, 825 bp for SmsAPx and
1011 bp for SmtAPx were amplified (Fig. 3), confirming
the gene predictions (Fig. 2) and demonstrating expression of all predicted genes. Since RNA isolation is different for the various species and results in different yields,
quantitative comparison of transcript abundances was
omitted.
Characteristics of the predicted proteins

Among the identified chloroplast APx, the amino acid
residues forming the catalysis triad (H276, D356 and W327)
are conserved in all identified proteins (Fig. 1A; except
CrsAPxB). All proteins have also R137, W140 and H141 in
common (Fig. 1A), which coordinate the H2O2 molecule
in the active site [49]. In response to excess H2O2, W140
can crosslink with the heme, which irreversibly inhibits
the enzyme [50]. Regarding the heme binding site, in Physcomitrella tAPx and Chamydomonas sAPx position R282
is replaced by a H, like it is in many cytosolic APx [49]. All

other amino acids important for heme binding (P133, P238,
L272, H276, L278, G279, R280, S286, and Y372) [4,51] (labeled
"H" in Fig. 1A) are conserved within the examined species.
The amino acids involved in ascorbate binding (T277,
241, G279, R285, D347, and L350) (labeled "A" in Fig. 1A)
A
[4,49,51] are widely conserved like several unspecified
residues (e.g. L138, G144, T145, Y146, K148, I150, E152, W153,
P154). In total 63 - 79% amino acid identity for sAPx and
69 - 79% identity for tAPx reflect a high overall similarity
between Arabidopsis, Selaginella and Physcomitrella
chloroplast APx. Many amino acid substitutions conserve
the chemical properties of the protein (Fig. 1A), for example E341 is replaced by the also acidic amino acid D in both
SmsAPx and AttAPx and S195 is substituted by T and L351
by V in PptAPx. The most prominent amino acid
exchange is the replacement of W288 by F in CrsAPxA,
CrsAPxB und PptAPx since the F288W substitution has
been proposed to provide higher ascorbate specificity to
chloroplast APx compared to cytosolic APx [20].
Ascorbate peroxidases bind one or two cations on the
protein surface, which are involved in heme coordination
[49]. The distal cation binding site (D142, G158, N160, S162)
("D" in Fig. 1A) is conserved in all APx encoded by
expressed genes. In the proximal cation binding pocket
(T296, T328, K333 and D335) (labeled "P" in Fig. 1A), K333 is
exchanged by E in CrsAPxA. The higher number of negative charges provides a stronger ionic interface for the

Page 9 of 30

potassium ion. Superimposition of the modeled structure
of CrsAPxA with AtsAPx (Fig. 4) shows that two short
insertions (aa244-aa248, aa303-aa321 in fig. 1) form loops,
designated "Evolutionary VAriable LOops I and II"
[EVaLo I (aa244-aa248) and EVaLo II (aa303-aa321)], on the
protein surface (Fig. 4).
2-Cys peroxiredoxins
Gene copy number

Like Arabidopsis thaliana (At2CPA: At3g11630; At2CPB:
At5g06290), Physcomitrella patens encodes two 2CP (per
haploid genome) (Table 1). N-terminal targeting signals
indicate that both are chloroplast-targeted isoforms. Due
to a gap between the genome scaffolds 1139 and 257
http://www.cosmoss.org, no gene model was predictable
for Pp2CPB.
The two haplotypes of Selaginella encode two pairs of
almost identical 2CP, designated Sm2CPA.1/2 and
Sm2CPB.1/2. For the Sm2CPB genes no ESTs were
observed (Table 1), indicating that they are putatively not,
only weakly or only under defined circumstances
expressed. According to gene models presently provided
by the Selaginella databases, the Sm2CPB start-codons
were predicted corresponding to position 118 or 145 (relative to the positions in fig. 5A) and lacking the N-terminal extension with chloroplast targeting propensity. A
homologous, but incomplete putative N-terminal extension was observed for Sm2CPB.2 (Fig. 5A).

In the genome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii three
open reading frames for 2CP were identified (Table 1).
Cr2CPA is identical to PRX1 and Cr2CPB to PRX2, which
were previously described by Dayer et al. [16]. For the
Cr2CPA gene 121 ESTs were observed in the JGI database
and 10 in ChlamyDB, indicating that the gene is strongly
expressed relative to other peroxidases in Chlamydomonas. The deduced protein sequence shows a typical Nterminal chloroplast targeting signal. For Cr2CPB, which
was previously predicted to be cytosolic (or flagellar) [16],
only 19 ESTs were observed in the JGI database and 5 in
ChlamyDB (Table 1), suggesting that the gene is less
expressed. The N-terminus of the protein is exceptionally
short if compared to 2CP from other plants (Fig. 5A).
Chlamydomonas genes often have longer introns than
those of Arabidopsis and Selaginella (see e.g. Fig. 2 and 6).
Thus, for the Cr2CPB gene 4000 bp upstream sequence
were screened for a putative additional exon, but no indications were found for a putative targeting signal with
TargetP-values higher than 0.3 (data not shown). It indicates that the Cr2CPB gene, although only weakly
expressed, may encode the first identified plant non-chloroplast 2CP consistent with the protein localization suggested by Dayer et al. [16]. However, as shown for RbcS
and LHCII, protein import into chloroplasts is strongly
regulated by localized translation in Chlamydomonas
[41], which does not necessarily need strong chloroplast
import signals.
Furthermore, our study identified a third putative, but
not-EST-covered 2CP gene, Cr2CPC, on scaffold 105
(Table 1), which shares higher similarity with Cr2CPB
than with Cr2CPA (Fig. 5A and 5B). According to the
neighborhood joining (Fig. 5B) and minimal evolution
algorithms (Additional file 3), Cr2CPA clusters into the
same branch as cyanobacterial 2CP, while Cr2CPB and
Cr2CPC form an independent outgroup. Only the maximum parsimony algorithm (Additional file 4), which
accounts for the most parsimonious explanation based on
weighting each amino acid position discretely [52], clus-

Page 10 of 30

ters the three Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 2CP with a
2CP known from Chlamydomonas incerta in a group
which is closely related to cyanobacterial 2CP.
Exon-intron structure

Like for APx, the gene structures of the 2CP were analyzed by comparison of cDNA sequences with genomic
DNA (Fig. 6). The two A. thaliana 2CP have very similar
structures with conserved exon-intron borders (Fig. 6).
The first exon of At2CPB, which encodes the less conserved chloroplast targeting signal, is eight amino acids
longer than in At2CPA. The main difference between the
two genes is the length of the introns, which are slightly
longer in At2CPB.
A very similar gene structure with seven exons was
observed for Sm2CPA (Fig. 6) demonstrating gene conservation between the lycophyte and the seed plant. The
introns are all shorter in Sm2CPA than in Arabidopsis
2CP genes, which decreases the total length of the gene
by 33%. The splice sites are conserved with those in A.
thaliana 2CP (Fig. 6). The not-EST-covered Selaginella
2CPB gene has eight instead of seven exons due to an
additional intron in the corresponding first exon of
Sm2CPA (Fig. 6). The splice site between exon2 and
exon3 is gene-specific and elongates exon3 by 36 nucleotides. In general, the introns of Sm2CPB are longer and
their length is more variable than in Sm2CPA (Fig. 6).
In Physcomitrella patens Pp2CPA has seven exons,
which are separated by comparably long introns (Fig. 6).
From the second splice site (aa161-0) onwards, the exonintron borders are conserved with the two Arabidopsis
2CP. The first border (aa112-0) differs by only one amino
acid from the border found in the Arabidopsis 2CP (aa1130).
For Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, three 2CP genes were
detected in the genome. Their gene structure is non-conserved and atypical if compared to Physcomitrella, Selaginella and Arabidopsis 2CP (Fig. 6). Cr2CPA has only
three exons while the weakly or not expressed Cr2CPB
and Cr2CPC genes have seven and eight exons, respectively, with non-conserved splice sites.
Characteristics of the predicted proteins

proving the predicted cDNA lengths.

Despite the variability in gene structures (Fig. 6), the
amino acid sequences of the mature 2CP share many conserved positions (Fig. 5A). The catalytic sites around the
peroxidatic C186 (Fig. 5A; aa171 - aa196), around the resolving cysteine residue C311 (aa 310 - aa314) ("*" in fig. 5A) and
the active pocket (P179, F182, V185, E189, W221, R265 and
R295) ("C" in fig. 5A) [53] are identical in all 2CP for which
EST data were observed. Furthermore, the GGLG-motif
(aa229-aa232) is conserved in all species. According to
Jönsson et al. [54], the motif is specific for eukaryotic 2CP
and stabilizes the folded structure together with the YF-

motif (aa332-aa333), decelerates disulfide formation and
increases the sensitivity to H2O2.
Strongest differences were observed for Cr2CPB,
Cr2CPC and Sm2CPB. For example, in the hydrophobic
pocket around the resolving C311, G314 and K316 are
replaced by N and W221 is exchanged by a less bulky Fresidue in Cr2CPB. In Brassica 2CP W221 is replaced by G
[55] indicating that this position is less important for 2CP
function than other amino acids. The dimer interface
described by Schroder et al. [53] (R-Q-I-X-V-N-D) is
replaced by a Q-HA/S-T-I/V-N-N consensus in most
plant 2CP (aa277-aa283; Fig. 5A) [55], including all ESTconfirmed 2CP identified in this study (Fig. 5).
The interface (L180, F182, F184, F216, A220 and W221)
(labeled "T" in fig. 5A) involved in decamer formation
[53] is conserved (Fig. 5A). However, there are a few protein modifications in the dimer and decamer interfaces
between the identified proteins: As mentioned before,
W221, which is also part of the active site, is replaced by F
in Cr2CPB. Sm2CPA and Pp2CPA show G251N and an
I281V substitutions and Sm2CPB, which is encoded by a
presumably nonexpressed or only weakly expressed gene,
has a G251R substitution. These two positions are known
to be involved in dimer stability [53]. In Sm2CPB also the
YF-motif (aa332-aa333), which is involved in stabilization

of the peroxidatic C [54], is replaced by HF and aa328aa331 are missing, suggesting that the putatively less
expressed gene does not encode a (fully) functional protein. Sm2CPA and Pp2CPA show charge conservative
amino acid substitutions with weak sterical effects (T243S:
Sm2CPA; D256E: Pp2CPA) in the decamer contact phase.
At aa279 in the 2CP alignment only Arabidopsis shows a S
while Sm2CPA, Sm2CPB, the Physcomitrella 2CP, and
Cr2CPA reveal an A residue and Cr2CPB and Cr2CPC an
I and V, respectively.
Cr2CPB shows a specific three amino acid long insertion at positions aa258 - aa260 (Fig. 5A), which extends a βsheet on the protein surface (EVaLo I in Fig. 7). In this
protein, like in Cr2CPC and partially also in Cr2CPA,
charged amino acids are atypically substituted: negatively
charged D148, E150 and Q298 are substituted by positively
and uncharged residues and E201 by R, K or A. Uncharged
S228 and L328 are substituted by K, E, R and G, and K161 (by
E), K163 (by T/S), K202 (by D, A), K227 (by T/N), K272 (by P),
K316 (by N) and K327 (by T/E), which are otherwise
widely conserved throughout the 2CP family [55,56], and
K170 is deleted (Fig. 5A).
The C-terminus, which is involved in the attachment of
2CP to membranes [18,53], is more hydroxylated in
Cr2CPB due to S/T-substitutions at position 334, 335 and

337 (Fig. 5A). In Cr2CPC, which is not covered by ESTs,
the C-terminus is extended by a G- and P-rich 33 amino
acid long peptide. Secondary structure analysis gave no
indications for strong structural features, such as α-helices or β-sheets (data not shown) indicating a long
unstructured C-terminal tail, such as in animal and yeast
2CP [53,57].
Consistent with the degree of primary structure conservation, modeling of the 3D-structures indicate strong
differences between Cr2CPB and At2CPA (Fig. 7), while
the structure of the other EST-covered 2CP is conserved
(data not shown): In Cr2CPB (Table 1) a three amino acid
insertion (aa258 - aa260) extends and slightly tilts the βsheet which is involved in formation of the active site
(Fig. 7; EVaLo I). Other sequence variations impact on the
dynamic loops, designated "Evolutionary Variable Loop"
II and III. EVaLo II is located on the outer surface of the
2CP toroid-decamer structure [58]. In contrast, EVaLo III
shapes the inner surface of the 2CP-toroid. These predicted modifications indicate a specific surface of
Cr2CPB oligomers (Fig. 7 right).
The atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins PrxQ and PrxII
Gene copy number

The atypical 2CP family is comprised of two enzyme
groups: PrxQ and PrxII. In Arabidopsis thaliana, one out

Pitsch et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/133

of six PrxII, PrxIIE (At3g52960), is targeted to the chloroplast stroma [14]. The only PrxQ is post-translationally
targeted to the thylakoid lumen [19]. According to neighborhood joining (Fig. 8B and 9B), minimum evolution
and maximum parsimony trees (Additional files 5, 6, 7
and 8) all identified streptophyte PrxII and PrxQ cluster
with chloroplast homologs from other plants.
Like Arabidopsis thaliana, Selaginella moellendorffii
encodes two PrxII proteins with Nterminal targeting signals per haploid genome. One is homologous to chloroplast AtPrxIIE, the other to mitochondrial AtPrxIIF (Fig.
9B). The chloroplast SmPrxII is most similar to the Pinus
PrxIIE (Fig. 9B and additional files 7 and 8).
In contrast, two ORFs encoding PrxQ were identified
(per haploid genome) in the genome of Selaginella indicating a gene duplication. For SmPrxQA 7 ESTs were
counted indicating that the gene is functionally active. No
EST was observed for SmPrxQB, which is less similar to
higher plant PrxQ than SmPrxQA (Fig. 8B and additional
files 5 and 6).
The bryophyte Physcomitrella expresses three chloroplast PrxQ and two PrxII. The gene number demonstrates an amplification of genes encoding atypical Prx if
compared to Chlamydomonas, Selaginella and Arabidopsis (Fig. 9; Table 1). According to the calculated phylogenetic trees (Fig. 8B) and in contrast to other Prx genes the
three PrxQ proteins, especially PpPrxQA, show speciesspecific sequence characteristics (Fig. 8B).
Consistent with Dayer et al. [16], one chloroplast PrxII
and one chloroplast PrxQ were observed [PRX5 (here:
CrPrxIIC) and PRX6 (here: CrPrxQ)] in Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii (Table 1; Fig. 8). However, unlike Dayer et al.
[16], no EST was detected for PrxQ by using the JGI and
ChlamyDB data resources.
Exon-intron structure of PrxQ

In Arabidopsis, Selaginella and Physcomitrella two splice
sites are conserved within the PrxQ genes (aa74-0 and
aa156-0) (Fig. 10). PpPrxQA, the Selaginella and Arabidopsis homologs share an additional splice site at amino acid
position 126-0 (Fig. 10). CrPrxQ shows a distinct splice
pattern. Only one splice site (corresponding to aa126-0) is
conserved with PpPrxQA, the Selaginella and Arabidopsis homologs and no splice site is conserved with
PpPrxQB and PpPrxQC (Fig. 10).
If compared to C. reinhardtii, the gene structure of
PpPrxQA was more similar to AtPrxQ and SmPrxQ (Fig.
8). It has four exons. The first and the fourth exon have
approximately the same length as in the Selaginella
homolog. The exons are separated by three introns which
are longer than in AtPrxQ, SmPrxQA and SmPrxQB and
elongate the entire gene. PpPrxQB and PpPrxQC both
have only three exons. Their second exon combines
exon2 and exon3 of AtPrxQ, SmPrxQ, and PpPrxQA. In

Page 13 of 30

SmPrxQB there is an additional splice site in the last exon
(corresponding to aa228-2).
Exon-intron structure of PrxII

The PrxII proteins of A. thaliana, S. moellendorffii and P.
patens are encoded within a single exon (Fig. 11). In contrast, the C. reinhardtii PrxII gene has five exons separated by four introns of different sizes.
Characteristics of the predicted PrxQ and PrxII proteins

To compare PrxQ and PrxII from Arabidopsis, Selaginella, Physcomitrella and Chlamydomonas, the cDNA
sequences were translated. The derived amino acid
sequences were aligned by ClustalW2.0 (Fig. 8A and 9A).
Atypical plant Prx have so far not been investigated to
such detail as APx or typical 2CP. Only few amino acids
have been reported to be essential for their activity: The
peroxidatic and resolving C residues are characteristic for
most Prx. In PrxQ, the conserved C residues are located
at positions 123 and 128 (Fig. 8A) and in PrxII at 135 and
160 (Fig. 9A). Additional specific criteria are:
PrxQ

Compared to non-plant PrxQ [59], the amino acid
sequences are more similar between plant species. In
PpPrxQ, SmPrxQ and AtPrxQ many positively charged
amino acid residues are conserved (Fig. 8A). K, R, Q and
N are protonated under acidic conditions, such as there
are in the thylakoid lumen during light periods, where
PrxQ is post-translationally targeted to [19]. CrPrxQ
lacks negative charges at position 118, 119, 135 (numbers
relative to the alignment depicted in Fig. 8A) and positive
charges at position 138, 139, 156, 175 and 200. In phylograms, the algal protein is not grouped with PrxQ from
higher plants (Fig. 8B and additional files 5 and 6), but
defines a distinct group, demonstrating that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii expresses a specific type of PrxQ.
In the analyzed plant PrxQ, among the amino acids
located close to the active site, aa120, aa122 and aa126 are
not conserved (Fig. 8). AtPrxQ, PpPrxQA, PpPrxQB,
SmPrxQB and CrPrxQ show a T residue at position 120
while it is replaced by the also hydroxylated amino acid S
in SmPrxQA and PpPrxQC. More important in respect
of enzyme activity might be the exchange of the positively
charged Q126 to a negatively charged E in SmPrxQ and
CrPrxQ and the G122T exchange in PpPrxQB, since they
affect the charge distribution close to the active site (C123
- C128) (Fig. 8A).
Besides the variation of a hydroxylated amino acid residue in the -3 position (S/T120) and P residues in the -2
and -7 position relative to the peroxidatic cysteine residue (C123) and R193, which has been proposed to be
important for dimer stabilization in peroxiredoxins [57],
there is too little information on functionally important
motifs and amino acids to draw conclusions on enzyme
conservation.

of a β-sheet and modifies the protein surface. In the decameric toroid structure (right) the three EVaLo-s modify the inner and outer ring surface (redgreen labels in the right figure).

The peroxiredoxin fold was investigated by predicting
the 3D-structure with SWISS-MODEL (Fig. 12). The parallel β-sheet core and the conserved α-helices give the
streptophyte PrxQ proteins a rigid common structure.
On the protein surface there are three flexible loops in
streptophyte PrxQ (Fig. 12 top) and five loops in the
Chlamydomonas PrxQ. The K, R, Q, and N residues,
which may be important for the pH-sensitivity of the

enzyme, are evenly distributed on the protein surface
(data not shown).
PrxII

Recent crystal structure analysis of poplar PrxII demonstrated that F131, T132, P133, F167, V168, A171, L209 and R212
form the active site and the interface in PrxII dimers [60].

SmPrxII of both haplotypes, all positions are conserved
in the analyzed species (Fig. 9A).
PrxII interact electrostatically with their electron
donors, such as glutaredoxins [61]. From the negative
charges suggested to define the electrostatic surface of
poplar PrxII [60], the positions 242 (E/D), 243 (E/D) and
231 (E) are conserved. In addition F131, which is part of
the hydrophobic surface domain, can be found in PrxII of
all analyzed species. In contrast, the poplar-specific E145
is replaced by D, S and A. E178 is substituted by small
uncharged amino acids V, I and A and L137 partially by S
and Q in the here analyzed species (Fig. 9A). 3 D structural comparison showed various flexible loops on the
protein surface (Fig. 13), demonstrating that the structure
of PrxII proteins is less rigid than the one of the 2CP.
Chlamydomonas PrxII showed the shortest N-terminal
extension and a deletion of V206 and E207.
The two Physcomitrella PrxII have atypical C-termini
(Fig. 9A). The eight, instead of three, amino acid long Cterminus has two additional hydroxylated amino acids
(S246 and S247) and three (Q249, K250 and N252), instead of
one, positively charged residues (Fig. 9A). According to
Echalier et al. [62], the C-terminus is exposed on the surface of PrxII proteins. Thus, the atypical tail of PpPrxII
may increase the hydrophilicity of the protein. Superimposition of the 3 D structures demonstrates that in S.

moellendorffii, P. patens and C. reinhardtii the position of
the peroxidatic C (C135) is slightly shifted if compared to
AtPrxIIE due to replacement of the positively charged
Q137 by S or L (Fig. 9A and 13).
Glutathione peroxidases

Like peroxiredoxins, glutathione peroxidases are broad
spectrum peroxidases, which detoxify H2O2 and a wide
range of alkylhydroperoxides [12,63,64]. Plant GPx cluster into the phylogentically ancient group of phospholipid
hydroperoxides glutathione peroxidases (PHGPx) [17].
Based on sequence similarities and biochemical characterization they are alternatively designated as a subclass
of peroxiredoxins [5]. All of the here described GPx have
fully conserved FPCNQF (F163 - F168) and WNY/FxKFV/I
(W236 - V/I243) motifs (Fig. 14A), known for GPx from
various plant kingdoms [65].
Arabidopsis chloroplast GPx

Arabidopsis thaliana encodes seven GPx, of which three
are organellar targeted by Nterminal transit peptides
[17,66]. GPx6 (At4g11600) is suggested to be alternatively
targeted to mitochondria and the cytosol, while GPx1
(At2g25080) and Gpx7 (At4g31870) are chloroplast-targeted and protect plants from photooxidative stress [22].
The conserved exonintron-structure strongly indicates a
common origin of GPx1 and GPx7 (Fig. 15), as well as of

GPx6 (data not shown). Superimposure of AtGPx1 and
AtGPx7 proteins modeled and presented by SWISSMODEL and Swiss-pdbViewer [67] showed highly similar
structures (data not shown). In contrast, AtGPx6 differs
structurally by replacement of helix 2 by a not structured
protein domain and a shorter helix 1 (Fig. 16A).
Selaginella chloroplast GPx

In the genome of the two haplotypes of Selaginella
moellendorffii three different loci (SmGPxA, SmGPxB
and SmGPxC) were observed, which encode GPx similar
to Arabidopsis GPx1 and GPx7. To date these six peroxidase sequences are not covered by PeroxiBase. SmGPxA
and SmGPxB proteins show N-terminal extensions similar to organellar targeting signals. For SmGPxA, both, the
TargetP- and ATP-values were high (Table 1) and indicate
chloroplast targeting. For the two SmGPxB isoforms the
ATP-values were high, but the TargetP-values low (Table
1). An 18 amino acids long N-terminal α-helix (A5 - W22)
with several hydroxylated amino acids and positive
charges, however, points to organellar targeting and recognition by the protein import complex.
BLASTN-searches demonstrated strongly different
expression intensities for the homologous GPx genes in

the two Selaginella haplotypes, for which similar expression intensities of APx and Prx genes were shown (Table
1). While 8 ESTs were observed for SmGPxB.1, none was
found for SmGPxB.2.
An additional gene with putative GPx function, SmGPxC, was detected in the genome of both analyzed haplotypes of Selaginella (Table 1). Lack of an N-terminal
chloroplast targeting signal (Fig. 14A) suggests extraplastidic localization.
Comparison of the modeled protein structures revealed
almost structural identity of SmGPxA.1 and SmGPxA.2
to AtGPx1 and AtGPx7. The fold of SmGPxB proteins
differed. Superimposure of SmGPxB proteins and
AtGPx1 demonstrates a less structured organization of
amino acid 175 to 186, which form an α-helix in SmGPxA
and the Arabidopsis chloroplast GPx protein (Fig. 15B).
Due to the unstructured domain, SmGPxB shows higher
similarity to mitochondrial AtGPx6 (data not shown). For
both SmGPxA and SmGPxB haploforms cDNA fragments of the predicted size (SmGPxA.1: 417 bp; SmGPxA.2: 415 bp; SmGPxB.1: 298 bp and SmGPxB.2: 296
bp) could be amplified by cDNA-specific saturating RT-

PCR (Fig. 16) demonstrating expressional activity of all
predicted Selaginella genes encoding chloroplast GPx.
Physcomitrella chloroplast GPx

In Physcomitrella two GPx genes encoding putative
organellar targeting signals with high ATP- and TargetPscores (Table 1) were identified. The exon-intron-structures of PpGPxA and PpGPxB are conserved with Arabidopsis and Selaginella homologs (Fig. 15). Similar to APx
and Prx genes, in Physcomitrella the introns are longer
than in Arabidopsis and much longer than in Selaginella.
For PpGPxA 11 ESTs were found additionally demonstrating expressional activity. One of the four ESTs covering the 3'-end of the ORF indicates alternative splicing of
the last intron. The last intron is maintained in this EST,
while it is spliced out in three other ESTs (for PpGPxA.1),
like in all Arabidopsis and Selaginella ESTs. The single
non-matching EST shows that Physcomitrella has a small
propensity to encode C-terminal aberrant GPx (PpGPxA.2) (Fig. 13 and 14; Table 1). For the second PpGPx
locus, PpGPxB, no EST was found in the data base (Table
1).
To test for gene expression activity saturating RT-PCR
was performed with RNA isolated from sterile grown

gametophytes. The reaction gave a strong signal of the
expected size for PpGPxA.1 demonstrating presence of
PpGPxA.1 mRNA. For the splice variant PpGPxA.2 PCR
with variant-specific primer combinations gave a weak
band of 361 bp besides two larger, non-specific bands. In
contrast, expressional activity of PpGPxB could not been
shown by RT-PCR. Under the applied temperature and
MgCl2-conditions only DNA fragments were amplified,
which were too large to represent PpGPxB (Fig. 16).
Strong sequence modifications in the domains encoding the otherwise highly conserved FPCNQFxxQEP environment [65] of the catalytic site (label "C" in Fig. 14A;
e.g. Q167T) in addition to several substitutions (e.g. Y/
H105R and V/I117T) and the untypical C-terminal extension (Fig. 14A) suggest that PpGPxB, if expressed, would
have various structural modifications (Fig. 17C). Therefore, it is very likely that this protein is not fully functional. Superimposure of protein models demonstrated
high structural similarity of PpGPxA.1 and PpGPxA.2 to
AtGPx1 and AtGPx7 (data not shown) indicating that
PpGPxA is the Physcomitrella homolog of Arabidopsis
GPx1 and GPx7.

Chlamydomonas chloroplast GPx

Consistent with the previous analysis by Dayer et al. [16],
three organellar GPx were detected in the genome of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Table 1). Two of them CrGPxA (designated GPx1 by [16]) and CrGPxB (GPx2 in
[16]) are selenoproteins (X137) as GPx are in many animals and microbia [68]. On the contrary, CrGPxC (GPx5
in [16]) is a nonselenocysteine GPx (C136) like the GPx
identified in the other plant analyzed species (Fig. 14A).
Our data are widely consistent with that of Dayer et al.
[16], except for the primary sequence of CrGPxA. For this
protein the new translation demonstrated that in the previous description [16] a G (G137 in Fig. 14A) was missing
at the position following the selenocysteine.

The gene structures of CrGPx genes are hardly conserved (Fig. 15). Except the splice site at the end of exon1
of CrGPxC (135-2), Chlamydomonas GPx transcripts and
GPx hnRNA from the other tested species have no splice
site in common (Fig. 15).
Expressional activity of CrGPxB and CrGPxC was confirmed by saturating RT-PCR (Fig. 16). Under a wide
range of conditions (annealing temperature: 46 - 60°C
and 1.5 - 3 mM MgCl2), no signals were observed which
may indicate expression of CrGPxA in our plant material.
Expression of CrGPxA is either very low or restricted to
very specific conditions.
The modeled two selenocysteine isoforms CrGPxA and
CrGPxB show structural similarity to AtGPx1 and

ences in the catalytic activity have to be assumed. Despite
the strong differences to AtGPx1, comparison to human
GPx (data not shown), showed stronger structural similarity of CrGPxC to monomeric human GPx4 than to
tetrameric GPx1 (data not shown), demonstrating that
the less conserved Chlamydomonas isoforms also
belongs to the monomeric GPx cluster.

According to Margis et al. [17], plant GPx evolved by four
major gene duplication events from a single ancestral
gene. The initial duplication has been supposed to have
taken place prior to separation of monocots and dicots or
even before separation of gymnosperms and angiosperms. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the
protein sequences of the here investigated genes and
sequences taken from PeroxiBase using neighborhood
joining (Fig. 14B), maximum parsimony and minimum
evolution algorithms (Additional files 9 and 10). For Arabidopsis thaliana all GPx were included in this analyses,
irrespective of the subcellular localization of the
enzymes. The distance of the chloroplast isoforms to the
other Arabidopsis GPx demonstrates that chloroplast
AtGPx1 and AtGPx7 result from a late gene duplication
which took place after separation of mitochondrial, cytoplasmic and chloroplast paralogs. For the chloroplast
GPx genes from the other species a more ancient separa-

tion can be assumed from the distant positions in the calculated phylogenetic trees (Fig. 14B; Additional files 9
and 10). The variability between the three different types
of phylogenetic trees makes it impossible to definitely
answer the question whether chloroplast targeting was
established independently for different chloroplast paralogs or prior to the final gene duplication event. The phylogenetic trees, however, suggest early separation and
independent evolution of GPx isoforms. Therefore, com-

pared to Margis' et al. [17] assumptions, our analysis
shows that the gene duplication resulting in chloroplast
paralogs occurred much earlier than the angiopserm gymnosperm separation.
Relative expression of peroxiredoxin, ascorbate peroxidase
and glutathione peroxidase genes

Microarray-based data (available from TAIR) show that
sAPx and tAPx genes are weakly expressed in Arabidopsis compared to 2CP (expression level of the entire rosette
after transition to flowering: sAPx: 328.86; tAPx: 403.91;
2CPA: 3184.8; 2CPB 1222.76). For the APx encoded by
the two Selaginella haplotypes, 3 and 6 sAPx ESTs and 9
and 10 tAPx ESTs (Table 1) were identified in the EST
cluster analysis. In the same data set 67 and 60 ESTs for
Sm2CPA, 12 and 15 for SmPrxII and 21 and 7 for
SmPrxQ were counted. However, EST numbers are not
precise measures for gene expression activities, the relative numbers indicate a rather weak expression of APx if
compared to Prx. For P. patens, the relative EST counts
indicate stronger expression of PptAPx. Within the group
of Prx, the Pp2CPA gene was slightly less covered by ESTs
than the genes for PpPrxIIA and PpPrxIIB together, but
more than the three PrxQ genes together. In C. rein-

hardtii, however, for CrsAPxA only 5 ESTs were counted
in the JGI database, Cr2CPA expression was represented
by 121 ESTs. The other Prx genes and the GPx genes were
much less active, indicating that Cr2CPA has the strongest impact on the chloroplast antioxidant system.
In general, EST counts were lowest for GPx (Table 1). In
combination with functional restrictions indicated by
superimposure of the predicted amino acid sequences
(Fig. 17A) the analysis indicates a subordinary or very
specific function of GPx in chloroplasts. In the comparison of species, Selaginella moellendorffii may be excluded
from this general conclusion. With 26 SmGPxA ESTs for
each haplotype (compared to 3 + 6 sAPx, 9 + 10 tAPx) the
EST counts demonstrate similar or slightly stronger
expression of GPx than APx genes.

Discussion
In the antioxidant defense against photooxidative ROS
formation, APx and GPx as well as Prx provide protection
against peroxides and, therefore, have partially overlapping functions [22,23,31]. Despite the long time of evolution following the separation of chlorophytes, mosses,
ferns and higher plants, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,
Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii and

Arabidopsis thaliana maintained parallel expression of
chloroplast APx and GPx and all of them also target three
types of Prx to chloroplasts (Table 1).
The EST-assembly and sequence homology based
genome wide search for ORFs demonstrated that the
gene copy number and the relative expression intensity
changed during evolution: In Selaginella moellendorffii
and in Physcomitrella patens the genes for chloroplast
PrxII and PrxQ were duplicated and triplicated, respectively. In Selaginella, EST counts showed a much stronger
GPx expression relative to APx expression than in Arabidopsis. Together with amplification of PrxII and PrxQ
gene copy numbers (Table 1), this data indicate a stronger
preference for the non-ascorbate-linked antioxidant system in the spikemoss. In Physcomitrella patens, the chloroplast antioxidant system lacks stromal APx activity.
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii does not have thylakoidbound APx, but encodes three chloroplast-targeted GPx.
One of them is typical for plants [12] and two are two
selenocysteine-type GPx, which are otherwise typical for
animals and microbia [50,68]. This comparison suggests
that the dominance of APx in the chloroplast antioxidant
system [11] is not ubiquitous in the plant kingdom and

Pitsch et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/133

may mainly be characteristic for higher land plants, for
which it was first described [2].
Chloroplast ascorbate peroxidase genes share a common
evolutionary origin

Similarities in the amino acid composition (Fig. 1A) and
in the gene structures (Fig. 2) demonstrate that Chlamydomonas, Selaginella and Arabidopsis APx genes are
related. The ancestral gene dates back to times before
chlorophytes and streptophytes split into two lineages.
Besides CrsAPxA, which was already annotated as APx in
the NCBI-database [50], the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas has a second gene, CrsAPxB, encoding a chloroplast
ascorbate peroxidase (Fig. 1) [69]. Due to specific
sequence characteristics CrsAPxB is annotated as putative bifunctional ascorbate-cytochrome c peroxidase in
PeroxiBase. The protein shows highest similarity to proteins encoded by red algae, but no CrsAPxB ortholog has
been observed in any streptophyte. Since the deduced
amino acid sequence showed various modifications in
heme and substrate coordination sites (Fig. 1A), CrsAPxB
is very likely a non-functional pseudogene.
CrsAPxA has an extra-long regulatory loop between F/W288
and W327

Compared to the other chloroplast APx (summarized in
PeroxiBase), CrsAPxA shows two short loops on the protein surface (Fig. 4). EVaLoII is placed between F/W288
and W327. As shown by Kitajima et al. [70] and Teixeira et
al. [23], the distance between this positions is extended in
all chloroplast APx if compared to cytosolic and microbody-localized APx. The loop increases the susceptibility
of the heme to H2O2 [49]. In CrsAPxA this loop is further
extended by 19 amino acids (Fig. 1A). Since for Chlamydomonas sp. W80 a chloroplast APx, which shows a chloroplast-typical loop, was reported to be stable in the
presence of excess H2O2 in an ascorbate-depleted
medium [71-73], a larger loop, such as EVaLoII, might be
necessary for increasing the H2O2 sensitivity and enable
flood gate control between H2O2 detoxification and H2O2
signaling inside chloroplasts [23,43,72].
In Physcomitrella, the ancestral APx is replaced by an APx
of retrotransposonal origin

Physcomitrella patens encodes only a tAPx, but no sAPx
(Fig. 2). The Physcomitrella gene for the chloroplast APx
has a single atypical splice site and is flanked by Angela
LTR retrotransponson footprints indicating a retrotransposonal origin. For Physcomitrella several copia-type elements have been inserted into the genome in waves. On
average, insertions took place every 3.9 million years [74].
Mosses separated from tracheophytes, such as ferns and
seed plants, 360 - 380 million years ago. However it is not
possible to precisely date retrotransposition events, the

Page 22 of 30

insertion may have taken place independently in the moss
branch. Due to the unconserved splice site (if compared
to the other chloroplast APx genes analyzed), it is tempting to assume that the intron was inserted after the retrotransposition event and does not result from incomplete
splicing of a retrotranscribed hnRNA.
In neighborhood joining (Fig. 1B), minimal evolution
and maximum parsimony trees (Additional files 1 and 2)
calculated from ClustalW protein alignment of all identified and all in PeroxiBase listed putatively full-length
plant ascorbate peroxidases, the PptAPx clusters with
chloroplast APx (between chloroplast APx from seed
plants and non-seed plants) suggesting that it originates
from a chloroplast APx encoding mRNA.
Unlike other chloroplast APx, in PptAPx at position
282 an arginine residue is substituted by a histidine residue. H282 corresponds to H169 in cytosolic APx of pea.
The histidine side chain forms a salt bridge with the propionated side chain of the heme [75]. The H282 is typical
for cytosolic APx and prevents H2O2-dependent decomposition of compound I in the absence of ascorbate [71]
suggesting that PptAPx is less H2O2-sensitive than other
chloroplast APx.
Physcomitrella lacks sAPx function and substituted it by
Prx gene multiplication

The single Physcomitrella plastid APx gene encodes a
tAPx with a C-terminal transmembrane anchoring helix.
Unlike tobacco, spinach and pumpkin APx genes
[20,76,77], EST-analysis gave no indication for alternative
splicing of the hnRNA into transcripts encoding thylakoid and stromal isoforms (data not shown). It is concluded that Physcomitrella patens lacks sAPx function.
Studies in transgenic Arabidopsis demonstrated that
sAPx has a stronger protective function under photooxidative stress conditions than tAPx [31]. Consequently,
lack of sAPx activity may limit chloroplast antioxidant
protection in Physcomitrella. In Arabidopsis, Prx expression increases in response to insufficient chloroplast APx
activity [31].
From the analysis of today's genome structures, it is not
possible to predict whether Physcomitrella has lost the
ancestral APx gene prior or post to maturation of the retrotransposonal gene. The natural habitat of the moss is
shady. Considering the low-light environment, the phylogenetic ancestors of Physcomitrella may have lost its
ancestral chloroplast APx gene even before the novel
gene was functionally adapted by evolution of suitable
promoter elements and chloroplast targeting signals. In
Physcomitrella, the genes for chloroplast Prx have been
multiplied. Compared to two 2CP, one PrxII and one
PrxQ in Arabidopsis thaliana, Physcomitrella patens
expresses two chloroplast 2CP, two chloroplast PrxII and
three chloroplast PrxQ paralogs (Table 1).

2-Cys peroxiredoxins evolved independently in
streptophytes and chlorophytes

2-Cys peroxiredoxins are nuclear encoded chloroplast
enzymes in higher plants [21], but cytosolic enzymes in
heterotrophic eukaryotes [78]. Based on sequence comparison with cyanobacterial 2CP and plastome encoded
2CP from the rhodobiont Porphyra purpurea, it has been
postulated that higher plant 2CP are of endosymbiotic
origin [21]. The gene structures (Fig. 6) and sequence
characteristics (Fig. 5A) demonstrated that 2CP of all
analyzed streptophytes are of common origin. On the
contrary, none of the 2CP genes of the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii showed a conserved splice site
and, thus, might have evolved independently.
In Arabidopsis, the gene structures (Fig. 6) and the
deduced amino acid sequences (Fig. 5A) are more similar
to each other than to the two 2CP genes of Selaginella
indicating distinct gene duplication events. Since no ESTs
were observed for Sm2CPB, the gene could be a silent
pseudogene. It might have started to accumulate mutations due to lack of selective pressure on the functional
activity of the Sm2CPB encoding gene. This hypothesis is
supported by changes in otherwise conserved charged
amino acid residues (e.g. D148N, D156H, D/E166N, D181N,
E201Q and S289N), a deletion in the conserved KEY-motif
[79] and the elongated N-terminus of mature Sm2CPB
(aa101 - aa138) (Fig. 5A). These modifications change the
charge of the protein surface and very likely disturb protein dimerization, which is important for formation of
intermolecular disulfide bonds during the reaction cycle.
There has been a strong selective pressure on stromal Prx
activity

Studies of 2CP antisense lines demonstrated that
decreased 2CP activity can be compensated by increased
induction of APx gene expression [80]. Chloroplast APx
has a by three to four magnitudes higher peroxidative
activity than Prx [81]. Thus, slightly higher expression of
APx could support the antioxidant protection of plants
similar to a strong induction of Prx. However, sequence
and structural conservation (Fig. 5, 8, 9 and 15) reports
that there has been a strong selective pressure on the
maintenance of Prx, especially on 2CP, during evolution
of plants. As estimated from array hybridizations and
EST-counts, the relative expression of 2CP is higher in
Arabidopsis, Selaginella and Chlamydomonas than APx
expression. For Physcomitrella, difficulties with scaffold
arrangement in case of the Pp2CPB gene http://www.cosmoss.org limited EST sorting. One reason, which
accounts for maintenance of Prx could be, that they can
reduce a wide range of alkyl hydroperoxides [30], while
APx isoforms are almost specific for H2O2 [4]. However,

Page 23 of 30

since GPx also detoxify alkyl hydroperoxides, Prx could
have been replaced by GPx.
Another reason for keeping Prx activity could be a better antioxidant protection in post-stress phases: Upon
severe oxidative stress APx and Prx are inactivated [70].
In APx, W140 is cross-linked to the heme by excess H2O2
[81]. In Prx the peroxidatic C is sulfinylated [30]. Sulfinylated 2CP can be regenerated by e.g. sulfiredoxins [54],
while chloroplast APx are irreversibly inhibited [81]. This
re-activation option gives 2CP a special importance during post-stress acclimation and may explain why all plants
maintained Prx genes during evolution. In higher plants,
2CP stability against oxidative damage is supported by
accumulation of high protein amounts [30]. 2CP is
assumed to be an ancient, stable peroxidase which is
expressed prior to activation of APx in young tissues [82].
Chlamydomonas weakly expresses a putative cytosolic 2CP

In Chlamydomonas proteins, the chloroplast targeting
signals are much shorter and less hydroxylated and positively charged than targeting signals from the other
enzymes analyzed (Fig. 1A, 5A, 8A, 9A and 14A). On the
one hand this impedes targeting predictions, on the other
hand, in Chlamydomonas the single large chloroplast
covers almost 90% of the cell lumen. A recent study [41]
demonstrated that protein import is controlled by mRNA
availability and localized translation.
In the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas three 2CP genes
were observed. Their gene structure is not conserved
(Fig. 6). Compared to the other 2CP analyzed in this
study, the amino acid sequences of the proteins are more
variable (Fig. 5A). Especially in Cr2CPB, the C-terminus
is highly charged and modified in the KEY-motif (aa330 aa332) [56]. In the C-terminus, the protein has three prolin
residues, compared to four prolins in other plant 2CP and
two prolins in non-plant 2CP [18]. Taken this together
with the modified charge pattern of the Cterminus,
Cr2CPB resembles non-plant 2CP more than plant 2CP
according to the criteria summarized by König et al. [18].
Chlorophytes have diverged from streptophytes more
than 1 billion years ago [83]. The chlorobionts share common ancestors with rhodobionts of which some, e.g. Porphyra purpurea, encode 2CP in their plastomes [21].
Many non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, including mammals and fungi, express cytosolic 2CP [21]. Maximum
parsimony analysis of amino acid similarity (Additional
file 4) indicates that the three Chlamydomonas 2CP are
related. Amino acid sequence characteristics (Fig. 5A)
and, especially, gene structure analysis (Fig. 6) suggest
that the chlorophyte either retained a cytosolic 2CP of
different evolutionary origin than the chloroplast 2CP of
higher plants or indicate a chloroplast 2CP with an plastid-atypical amino acid sequence.

Gene structure evolution of PrxII and PrxQ

Chloroplast PrxII are encoded by single exon genes in
streptophytes, but by a five exon gene in Chlamydomonas. Despite the difference in the gene structure (Fig. 11),
they show high amino acid sequence conservation
between the species (Fig. 9A and 9B). From comparison
of APx, 2CP and PrxQ genes, it can be concluded that
most intron insertions may have taken place prior to
divergence of mosses, ferns and seed plants. However,
sequence analysis provides no explanation why so many
intron-insertions took place in the gene for chloroplast
PrxII of Chlamydomonas or intron deletions in the streptophytes. In the streptophyte branch, consistent with
genome wide comparisons [84], the gene structures
encoding the mature parts of PrxQ and APx are conserved between the analyzed species. Only the intron
lengths are variable in these genes. Based on comparison
of Arabidopsis and rice genomes Roy and Penny [85] concluded that the main difference in intron numbers results
from mRNA-mediated intron loss. Accordingly, it is more
likely that the streptophytes lost introns than that they
were inserted in the chlorophyte genes.
Thylakoid localization of PrxQ might be streptophyte
specific

In Arabidopsis thaliana, PrxQ is post-translationally targeted to the thylakoid lumen [19]. Protein trafficking is
controlled by bi-partite transit peptides [28]. Comparison
of the AtPrxQ transit peptide with the transit peptides of
the other streptophyte PrxQ shows similar lengths and
distribution of positively charged and hydroxylated
amino acid residues (Fig. 8A). In contrast, the transite
peptide of CrPrxQ is much shorter and stronger positively charged in its second half (aa71-aa90) indicating that
the thylakoid lumen address is missing and the protein is
targeted to the chloroplast stroma [28]. Furthermore,
CrPrxQ lacks negative charges at position 118, 119, 135
and positive charges at position 138, 139, 156, 175 and
200. A high number of positive charges in the mature
protein is characteristic for streptophyte PrxQ (Fig. 8A).
They can be protonated upon thylakoid lumen acidification and regulate enzyme activity. Several of these residues are not conserved in CrPrxQ (Fig. 8A) suggesting a
different regulation and, since the short transit peptide
also gives no indication for a thylakoid-lumen targeting
signal, also a different localization.
Chloroplast glutathione peroxidase genes are highly
conserved in streptophytes, but only weakly related to
chlorophyte GPx

Compared to the other investigated types of chloroplast
antioxidant enzymes, the gene structure is most conserved for GPx in the streptophyte branch of the plant
kingdom (Fig. 15). In genes from Physcomitrella, Selag-

Page 24 of 30

inella and Arabidopsis all splice sites were absolutely conserved in the gene part encoding the mature protein. In
Physcomitrella one identified EST may show alternative
splicing of the last intron. The high conservation and the
high similarity of the protein primary sequences demonstrate a strong evolutionary pressure on maintenance of
GPx function. In Selaginella, one pseudogene with modified gene structure and many substitutions, SmGPxD,
was observed (genome location 123: 187057 - 188973;
data not shown). Since this gene was only found in one of
the two sequenced haplotypes, it may result from a late,
haplotype specific gene duplication. If this was the case, it
would give additional stress on the hypothesis of the high
evolutionary pressure to conserve gene structures of
ancient genes. The fact that an extreme extention of
intron1 is accompanied by very low transcript coverage of
PpGPxB, may support the importance of GPx gene structure conservation, such as structural organization of the
pre-peptide encoding exon.
Evolution of GPx genes included gene duplication and
alternative splicing

It is generally assumed that gene duplication increased
the gene copy number of GPx in plants [17]. Concerning
chloroplast isoforms, phylogenetic tree analysis (Fig. 14B;
Additional files 9 and 10) and comparison of amino acid
residues (Fig. 14A) gave surprisingly little information on
the general relation of the GPx genes. The several chloroplast GPx proteins clustered with different proteins in
maximum parsimony, minimum evolution and neighborhood joining trees (Fig. 14B; Additional files 9 and 10).
However, gene structure analysis (Fig. 15) indicates a
common origin of streptophyte GPx. Weak similarities in
the exon-intron-structure between Chlamydomonas and
streptophyte GPx and co-existence of selenocysteine- and
cysteine-type GPx in Chlamydomonas, but not in streptophytes, demonstrates parallel independent evolution of
GPx branches in chlorobionts.
In contrast to early chloroplast GPx evolution, conclusions can be drawn for the latest GPx duplication: Since
only single genes for chloroplast isoforms were observed
in Selaginella (per haplotype) and Physcomitrella, duplication of the common ancestor gene into AtGPx1 and
AtGPx7 may have occurred after separation of phanerophytes and seed plants. In all phylogenetic trees calculated from ClustalW alignments, a single Cycas protein
(5756 in Peroxibase) is the closest relative of AtGPx1 and
AtGPx7. Without any paralogs in Cycas, the final duplication may even have taken place after separation of gymnosperms and angiosperms.
In the minimum evolution and neighborhood joining
trees (Fig. 14B, Additional files 9 and 10), the most similar
relatives of AtGPx1 and AtGPx7 are grass proteins (3059
and 5740 in Peroxibase). The other grass proteins

Pitsch et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/133

included in the phylogenetic analysis are more similar to
mitochondrial AtGPx6, indicating that separation of the
AtGPx6 lineage and the AtGPx1/AtGPx7 branch took
place prior to separation of monocots and dicots. Since
the AtGPx1/AtGPx7-cluster compromises only spermatophyte proteins, suppgests that separation of the
mitochondrial isoforms is a late event.
According to neighborhood joining analysis (Fig. 14B),
the Arabidopsis chloroplast proteins cluster with proteins
encoded by basal gymnosperms (Cycas; Peroxibase
4303), basal angiosperms (Amborella; Peroxibase 4302)
and liverworts (Marchantia; Peroxibase 5757). This result
demonstrates that the Arabidopsis chloroplast GPx proteins have been more conserved over time and are, presumably, more ancient than the mitochondrial AtGPx6
ancestor. GPx6-like proteins clusters exclusively with
grass proteins and, consequently, may be spermatophytespecific.
Protein modeling clearly separates AtGPx6 from
AtGPx1 and AtGPx7 (Fig. 17A), although the overall gene
structures are still very similar (data not shown). In Selaginella, the predicted three-dimensional structure of SmGPxA protein is, consistent with neighborhood joining
weighted primary sequence analysis, similar to AtGPx1/
AtGPx7. On the contrary, SmGPxB shows stronger structural similarity to AtGPx6 indicating that the two newly
described organellar Selaginella GPx are homologues or
AtGPx1/AtGPx7 and AtGPx6, respectively.
The most diverse GPx-types were observed in the
green algae Chlamydomonas (Fig. 14A, Fig. 14B and 15,
additional files 9 and 10). The cysteine-type GPx of Chlamydomonas (CrGPxC) has a conserved splice site with
the other analyzed plant GPx between exon1 and exon2,
suggesting an evolutionary relation to streptophyte GPx.
The gene structures of the selenocysteine-type GPx are
non-conserved. Comparison of the protein structure with
human seleno-GPx demonstrated that the structure is
more similar to monomeric human GPx4 than to tetrameric human GPx1 (data not shown). Consistent with
Margis et al. [17], we therefore conclude that all plant
GPx have evolved from a common ancestor. In Chlamydomonas low sequence and gene structure similarity
between the three putative organellar GPx genes reflects
high diversification. In streptophytes only one branch
was maintained as indicated by common exon-intron
structures. Additional gene duplications, such as in case
of AtGPx6 separation from the AtGPx1/AtGPx7 ancestral gene, and introduction of alternative splicing, such as
in the last exon of PpGPxA, resulted in further gene
diversification.

Conclusions
The study demonstrates that, irrespective of how much
time was available for modifications of intron lengths and

Page 25 of 30

individual amino acid residues, there had been an evolutionary pressure on maintenance of all three chloroplast
peroxide detoxification systems, namely APx, GPx and
Prx. Especially adaptation of an APx retrotransposon in
Physcomitrella for post-translational protein import into
chloroplasts and multiplication of PrxQ and PrxII genes
show the strong evolutionary pressure plants have perceived on having APx, GPx and Prx controlled chloroplast antioxidant protection in parallel. Gene structures
demonstrate that streptophyte and chlorophyte APx
genes evolved from a common ancestral gene. The structures of the Prx genes, in contrast, suggest at least a partially independent evolution, which resulted in putatively
non-plastidic or atypical 2CP isoforms, a potentially nonthylakoid lumen PrxQ and a PrxII gene with three chlorophyte-specific introns in Chlamydomonas. In addition,
streptophytes and chlorophytes differ in their GPx patterns, with Chlamydomonas expressing two seleno-GPx
and one cysteine-type GPx, while only cysteine GPx are
encoded in streptophytes. The comparison of model
chlorobiont genomes demonstrated that the complexity
and the individual components of the chloroplast antioxidant system were targets for mutations and selection. In
summary, this comparison provides a new basis for analyzing the function of individual components of the chloroplast antioxidant enzyme defense with respect to plant
tolerance against photooxidative stress.

Methods
Basic data mining

TBLASTX searches (BLOSUM62; threshold: 10; word
size: 3) were performed with the coding sequences of
Arabidopsis thaliana stromal and thylakoid ascorbate
peroxidases (At4g08390 and At1g77490), GPx1
(At2g25080), GPx7 (At4g31870) and chloroplast peroxiredoxins (2CPA: At3g11630; 2CPB: At5g06290; PrxQ:
At3g26060; PrxIIE: At3g52960) [29] in EST-databases of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [ChlamyDB http://www.
chlamy.org/ and JGI http://genome.jgi-psf.org], Physcomitrella patens [cosmoss http://www.cosmoss.org/]
and Selaginella moellendorfii [JGI http://genome.
jgipsf.org/Selmo1/Selmo1.home.html]. The collected
APx, GPx and Prx ESTs were clustered based on
sequence similarity using the DNA Identity Matrix/Unity
matrix of ClustalW2.0 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
clustalw2[32], which is a fast and sufficient tool to distinguish between the expected perfect matches and isogenes-dependent variations. The consensus cDNA
sequences were translated into an amino acid sequence
using online resources and the standard eukaryotic gene
code http://bio.lundberg.gu.se/edu/translat.html.
The deduced amino acid sequences were aligned with
Arabidopsis APx, GPx or Prx using CLUSTALW2.0 to
test the sequences for conserved motifs. With the 200 bp

Pitsch et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/133

ends of the consensus sequences the data bases were
searched using the BLASTN algorithm (threshold: 10;
word size: 28; match/mismatch scores: 1/-2) for ESTs
covering the less conserved 5'- and 3'-ends.
For still incomplete or potentially incomplete cDNAs,
2000 bp upstream of the 5'-end of the cDNA the respective genomic DNA was screened for transcription start
sites using DBTSS [33], for 5'-exons using FEX [34] via
the
Softberry-interface
http://linux1.softberry.com,
BLAST searches in the EMBL Plant EST database and,
finally, by hand, for putative S, T and R rich peptides and
other sequence characteristics of chloroplast targeting
signals as summarized in [86].
Finally, PeroxiBase http://peroxibase.isb-sib.ch/search.
php[42] was screened for putative chloroplast peroxidases as described in the results section. For the final
phylogenetic analysis also cyanobacterial PrxQ and 2CP
and extra-organellar and mitochondrial APx, GPx and
PrxII were retrieved from PeroxiBase for comparison. All
collected amino acid sequences were aligned using
CLUSTALW2.0 [32]. For calculation of phylogenetic
trees, incomplete sequences were removed from the analysis.
Discriminating between putative chloroplast and nonchloroplast isoforms

To distinguish between chloroplast and non-chloroplast
isoforms, the protein sequences with putative N-terminal
extensions were analyzed by TargetP [38] and ATP (http:/
/www.cosmoss.org/bm/ATP; [32]) for their chloroplast
targeting probability.
Determination of EST counts

The number of ESTs was used as a relative measure for
the expression intensity. To identify all ESTs, the full
length cDNA sequences were used as queries for
BLASTN searches (threshold: 10; word size: 28; match/
mismatch scores: 1/-2) in the respective EST database
[ChlamyDB http://www.chlamy.org/ and JGI http://
genome.jgi-psf.org for Chlamydomonas, Cosmoss http://
www.cosmoss.org/ for Physcomitrella and JGI http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/Selmo1/Selmo1.home.html for Selaginella] and the EMBL Plant EST database. The ESTs were
counted for each non-identical EST cluster.
Calculation of GC-contents

The GC-contents were calculated based on the codon
usage statistics tool CHIPS via the Mobyle-webpage
http://mobyle.pasteur.fr.
Prediction of the gene models

The EST-assembly-based consensus sequences were
aligned to genomic DNA by BLASTN [29] and
ClustalW2.0 [32] to identify exons. In case of Selaginella,
genomic data and EST data are combined from two

Page 26 of 30

mixed haplotypes [46,87]. To distinguish between alleles
and genes, in the gene structures of the respective
genomic scaffolds were compared with computational
gene models provided by JGI http://genome.jgipsf.org/
Selmo1/Selmo1.home.html. If the gene environment was
similar the two found gene models were designated as
alleles, otherwise as isogenes.
Comparison of splice sites

The positions of splice sites were compared relative to the
amino acid positions in the protein alignments depicted
in fig. 1A, 5A, 8A, 9A and 14A. The splice position within
the respective codon was designated 0, 1, and 2 according
to [88].
Protein alignments and protein comparison

The amino acid sequences of proteins were aligned by
using the EMBL-EBI tool MUSCLE [89] and ClustalW2.0
[32], and by MEGA 4.1. The phylogenetic trees were calculated based on ClustalW2.0 alignments using the Mega
4.1 software package [90]. Data retrieved for neighborhood joining were compared with minimum evolution
and maximum parsimony methods. The quality of the
predicted trees was tested by calculating the bootstrap
values based on 500 replicates. In the sequence comparisons, amino acid substitutions were weighted according
to the Poisson calculation and the PAM250 matrix.
Secondary structure prediction and 3D-structure modeling

Secondary structure analyses were performed with PredictProtein [35]. Transmembrane helices and their lipophilicity were predicted using TMHMM [36], TMPro
[37] and WHEEL http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~cmg/Demo/
wheel/wheel_instructions.html. AmphipaSeeK [91] was
used to search for putative in-plane membrane anchors.
In addition, the tool was utilized to confirm the PredictProtein-based protein structure analysis. The 3 D structures were predicted by using the freely available
alignment-based modeling tool SWISS-MODEL and the
SwisspdbViewer DeepView 4.0 [67].
Plant growth conditions

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was grown at 12 - 20 Zmol
m-2 s-1 and 12 h light/12 h dark under sterile conditions in
TAP liquid media and at 80-1000 μmol m-2 s-1 and 12 h
light/12 h dark on TAP agar plates [92], Physcomitrella
patens ssp. patens gametophytes were grown at 70 - 80
μmol m-2 s-1 and 14 h light/10 h dark on modified Knopmedium according to Bopp and Brandes [93] under sterile conditions and Selaginella moellendorffii sporophytes
were grown in the green house on soil and 14 h per day
illumination with 50 μmol quanta m-2 s-1 white light. Arabidopsis thaliana was cultivated for 6 weeks on soil in a
growth chamber at 20°C and illuminated with 80 -100
μmol m-2 s-1 for 10 h per day.

Isolation of genomic DNA

For isolation of genomic DNA 100 - 150 mg Selaginella
sporophytes or Physcomitrella gametophytes were
ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and extracted
for 30 min at 60°C with 1 ml CTAB medium (100 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1,4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 2% (w/
v) CTAB). The extract was subsequently extracted with 1
ml chloroform. The DNA was precipitated from the
aqueous phase with 1/10 volume 3 M Na-acetate (pH 5.2)
and 0.8 volumes isopropanol during a 15 min incubation
period at room temperature, washed in 70% (v/v) ethanol
and dissolved in sterile H2O.
RNA extraction, RT-PCR, PCR-amplification of genomic DNA
and analysis

Chlamydomonas RNA was extracted from 100 mg dry
algae pellets as described in Heiber et al. [94] for ground
Arabidopsis plant material. Physcomitrella and Selaginella RNAs were isolated from 100 mg plant material
with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufactures recommendations. Reverse transcription was performed according to Heiber et al. [94].
