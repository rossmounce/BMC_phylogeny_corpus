Abstract
Background: The mouse has more than 30 Major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) class Ib genes,
most of which exist in the H2 region of chromosome 17 in distinct gene clusters. Although recent
progress in Mhc research has revealed the unique roles of several Mhc class Ib genes in the immune
and non-immune systems, the functions of many class Ib genes have still to be elucidated. To better
understand the roles of class Ib molecules, we have characterized their gene duplication,
organization and expression patterns within the H2 region of the mouse strain C57BL/6.
Results: The genomic organization of the H2-Q, -T and -M regions was analyzed and 21 transcribed
Mhc class Ib genes were identified within these regions. Dot-plot and phylogenetic analyses implied
that the genes were generated by monogenic and/or multigenic duplicated events. To investigate
the adult tissue, embryonic and placental expressions of these genes, we performed RT-PCR gene
expression profiling using gene-specific primers. Both tissue-wide and tissue-specific gene
expression patterns were obtained that suggest that the variations in the gene expression may
depend on the genomic location of the duplicated genes as well as locus specific mechanisms. The
genes located in the H2-T region at the centromeric end of the cluster were expressed more widely
than those at the telomeric end, which showed tissue-restricted expression in spite of nucleotide
sequence similarities among gene paralogs.
Conclusion: Duplicated Mhc class Ib genes located in the H2-Q, -T and -M regions are differentially
expressed in a variety of developing and adult tissues. Our findings form the basis for further
functional validation studies of the Mhc class Ib gene expression profiles in specific tissues, such as
the brain. The duplicated gene expression results in combination with the genome analysis suggest
the possibility of long-range regulation of H2-T gene expression and/or important, but as yet
unidentified nucleotide changes in the promoter or enhancer regions of the genes. Since the Mhc
genomic region has diversified among mouse strains, it should be a useful model region for
comparative analyses of the relationships between duplicated gene organization, evolution and the
regulation of expression patterns.

Background
The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genomic
region harbors duplicated genes that express protein molecules responsible for the rejection of transplanted tissue,
restricted antigen presentation and the recognition of self
and non-self [1,2]. The Mhc genomic region in the mouse,
located on chromosome 17, is named H2 and the genes
within this region are usually classified into three distinct
classes (I to III) based on their structure and function [3].
The class I molecules generally elicit immune responses
by presenting peptide antigens derived from intracellular
proteins to T lymphocytes and their genes can be classified
into two groups, the classical Mhc class I (class Ia) genes
and the non-classical Mhc class I (class Ib) genes. The classical Mhc class Ia genes, such as H2-K and -D in the mouse,
are highly polymorphic, expressed widely and present
antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. To date, most studies
of the MHC class I genomic region have been focused on
the immunological function of class Ia molecules [4-6].
The non-classical class Ib molecules are structurally similar to the classical class Ia proteins, but in contrast to the
classical class Ia proteins, they have limited or no polymorphisms. They are more restricted in their tissue expression and some have functions other than antigen
presentation to CD8+ T cells. The non-classical class Ib
proteins have shorter cytoplasmic tails and some of them
lack consensus residues associated with peptide binding
[7]. The mouse is considered to have more than 30 Mhc
class Ib genes in the genome [3]. Most Mhc class Ib genes
are located at the telometric end of the 2 Mb-H2 region
within the H2-Q, -T and -M sub-regions, which were originally mapped and defined by recombination analysis.
Although the non-classical class Ib genes are involved in
immunological functions like the classical class Ia genes,
they generally serve a more specialized role in the
immune responses. The expression and function of some
non-classical class Ib genes, including H2-T23 (Qa-1), M3 and -T3 (TL antigen), have been analyzed in detail. For
example, Qa-1 is involved in the suppression of CD4+ T
cell responses via CD94/NKG2A or CD94/NKG2C receptors [8,9]. The peptide presentation by the Qa-1 molecule
may also have a role in CD8+ regulatory T cell activity
[10]. H2-M3 molecules prime the rapid response of CD8+
T cells by presenting N-formylated bacterial peptides [11].
The TL antigen is involved in the formation of memory
CD8+ T cells [12] and in the regulation of iIEL responses
in the intestine by interaction with homodimeric CD8
alpha receptors [13].
The class Ib molecules are also involved in non-immune
functions. For example, the H2-M1 and -M10 families of
the class Ib genes specifically interact with the V2R class of
pheromone receptors presented on the cell surfaces of the
vomeronasal organ [14,15]. The Qa-2 proteins encoded

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/178

by H2-Q7 and -Q9 class Ib genes influence the rate of preimplantation embryonic development and subsequent
embryonic survival [16]. In addition, the class I molecules
have recently been shown to contribute to the development and plasticity of the brain [17,18]. So far, there is little information about which of the non-classical class Ib
genes are involved in this function.
The molecular functions of many of the other class Ib
molecules are still far from being understood and even the
expression patterns for many of the Mhc class Ib genes
remain to be elucidated. The Mhc class Ib genes are members of gene clusters that have been generated by different
rounds of duplication and deletion [19]. In the mouse,
the telomeric 1 Mb of the Mhc including the H2-M region
was well characterized using the 129/Sv inbred strain [20].
The possible evolutionary fates of duplicated genes are
nonfunctionalization, neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization [21]. Genes recently duplicated may even
have the same functions by having and using identical or
similar expression domain sequences. In order to better
understand the role of class Ib molecules expressed by
duplicated genes in different tissues, we have undertaken
to examine, identify and characterize the Mhc class Ib gene
duplication, organization and expression patterns within
the H2 region of the mouse strain C57BL/6.
The whole genome of the laboratory mouse strain C57BL/
6J has been almost fully sequenced [22]. However, the
genomic organization of the Mhc class I region of mice
varies markedly between different haplotypes and inbred
strains [20]. In the present study, we selected Mhc class Ib
DNA sequences from the mouse genome database (NCBI
Entrez Genome Project ID 9559), and characterized the
organization of the Mhc class Ib genomic region for the
mouse C57BL/6 strain (haplotype b). Expression patterns
of each of the Mhc class Ib genes were examined by RTPCR using gene-specific primer sets, and we identified
Mhc class Ib genes with either tissue-restricted expression
or tissue-wide expression. We also identified monogenic
and multigenic duplicated regions within the H2-T region
of the mouse inbred-strain, C57BL/6. Based on the results
of our comprehensive analysis of the Mhc class Ib gene
duplication, organization and expression patterns, we discuss the possible relationships and regulatory outcomes
between the genomic location and expression patterns of
the mouse Mhc class Ib duplicated genes.

Results and Discussion
Identification and genomic organization of transcribed
Mhc class Ib genes
As the aim of this study was to determine the tissue expression patterns for each of the duplicated Mhc class Ib genes,
we first needed to identify the location and the number of
transcribing Mhc class Ib genes in the mouse genomic

sequence [22]. Although a nearly complete mouse
genomic sequence of this region was available in the public database, there were many large sequence gaps and
incomplete annotations for the sequence when we started
this study. Therefore, we predicted the putative Mhc class
Ib genes from the genomic contig NT_039650.2 by using
the GENSCAN program. This analysis identified 19 Mhc
class Ib-like sequences with coding potential (data not
shown). Based on these sequences and the information
obtained from the public databases, we designed genespecific primer sets (Table 1) and confirmed the expression of the predicted genes by RT-PCR against a panel of
cDNA tissues as described below. The nucleotide
sequences, determined by direct-sequencing of the RTPCR-amplified fragments, were registered with the GenBank/DDBJ sequence database and given the accession
AB266873,
numbers,
[GenBank:AB266872,
AB267092âAB267096]. As a result, a total of 15 expressed
genes were identified and mapped onto the current
genomic sequence ("GS" number in Figure 1). Although
there may be a possibility of misassemblies or missequencing of genomic sequence, most of the assembled
sequence, especially the order of genes, is thought to be
correct considering the fact that the distributions of
restriction sites (such as EcoRI, BamHI and KpnI) are consistent with previous reports (data not shown) [23,24],
and that the cDNA sequences we examined were perfectly
matched with genomic sequence. However, there was no
genomic sequence corresponding to the H2-Q8 and -Q9
genes that are believed to be present in C57BL/10 (haplotype b). At present, we do not know with certainty
whether the assembly of the genome is completely correct
in this region. Although the H2-Q5 locus was annotated
as H2-Q8 in the genome database, we designated this
locus as H2-Q5 for the following reasons. 1) This locus
was consistent with the physical map position of H2-Q5
in the previous report [23], and 2) the DNA sequence of
this locus is different from the H2-Q8 gene of C57BL/10
(U57392). This analysis in combination with a previous
report [25] revealed that a total of at least 21 Mhc class Ib
genes, 7 in the H2-Q region, 11 in the H2-T region and 3
in the H2-M region are definitely transcribed in the
C57BL/6 mouse. However, in the present study, we did
not consider the H2-M1, -10 family of Mhc class Ib genes
that are located outside the H2-Q and -T genomic regions.
Table 2 presents the H2 gene numbering system for
C57BL/6 mice (haplotype b) that we have used in this
paper. We designated each H2 gene with reference to the
genomic locations and designations used by others
[23,24,26]. The nucleotide sequences were determined for
the full-length cDNAs expressed by the genes H2-T23, T22, -T15, -T5 and -M5 and submitted to the GenBank
database [GenBank:AB359227âAB359231]. All genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/178

exhibited a standard class I structure with an alpha 1,
alpha 2, alpha 3 and transmembrane (TM) domain.
Monogenic and multigenic duplications
Mhc class I genes tend to diversify between species or
strains as a result of local duplications and deletions [27].
As local duplication often generates similar genes with
similar expression pattern and functional redundancy, it
is important to understand the genomic organization and
evolution of the Mhc class Ib regions. Hence, dot-plot
analysis was conducted by comparing the sequences of
the H2-Q and -T regions to themselves (Figure 1B;
240,000 bp for H2-Q cluster, 250,000 bp for H2-T cluster). In addition to the short diagonal lines seen in the
dot-plots due to the similarity of each Mhc class I gene,
long diagonal lines that indicate evidence of local duplications are seen in both the H2-Q and -T regions. Regarding the H2-Q region, duplication is evident in
approximately a 52-kb region from H2-Q4 to -Q10 (Figure 1B left). A long diagonal line is also seen in the H2-T
region (Figure 1B right) indicating a multigenic duplication event within the H2-T region from H2-T23 to -T5
(Figure 2). The phylogenetic tree of H2-T genes (Figure
1C) supports the occurrence of a multigenic duplication
event that produced some gene sets with a high sequence
similarity (> 85% in coding region, e.g. H2-T11 and -T23,
H2-T9 and -T15, H2-T10 and -T22, and H2-T5, -T7 and T13). Similarities between these genes are seen not only in
the coding region, but also in the untranslated region,
introns and intergenic regions (Figures 1B and 3), indicating the possibility that these genes have a redundant function and/or expression pattern.

Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of a single multigenic tandem duplication of four ancestral genes that
generated eight genes within the genomic D1 and D2
duplication products. The model also shows that before
the occurrence of the multigenic duplication event a single monogenic tandem duplication had probably generated a copy of the H2-T5 gene. This parsimonious model
helps to explain the gene organization (Figure 1B), phylogenetic topologies of the gene sequences (Figure 1C) and
the sequence similarities (Figure 3) between H2-T23 and T11, H2-T22 and -T10, H2-T15 and -T9, and H2-T13 and
-T7. However, the multigenic duplication model presented here for the mouse H2-T region has not taken into
account the presence of pseudogenes T1 and T2 and other
evolutionary mechanisms that may have contributed to
diversity within this region, such as gene conversions and
unequal cross-overs with other haplotypes. Nevertheless,
the multigenic duplication model for the mouse H2-T
region is similar to the multigenic tandem duplication
models previously proposed for the Mhc class I region of
human and non-human primates [28,29].

*Sequences of these primers were obtained from a previous report [25].

Regarding the H2-Q region, the genes H2-Q5, -Q6 and Q7, which form a tandem array in the H2-Q region (Figure 1B), also grouped relatively closely together in the
phylogenetic tree analysis (Figure 1C). Assuming the current genome assembly is correct, then these three genes
were probably generated by two separate monogenic tandem duplications much more recently than the duplications previously involved with the generation of the H2Q1, -Q2, -Q4 and -Q10 genes, which are more distantly
related in sequence in the phylogenetic analysis. However,
the duplication structure of the H2-Q region in C57BL/6
(Figure 1B left) appears to be different to the mouse strain
129/SvJ [30].
Expression of Mhc class Ib genes in adult tissues
To clarify the tissue expression patterns for each of the
Mhc class Ib genes, we conducted RT-PCR analysis of the
cDNAs isolated from various tissues of the adult mouse.
Although it is difficult to analyze Mhc class I expression
due to the sequence similarity of the Mhc genes (showing
60 â 95% identities in coding region; data not shown), we
circumvented this disadvantage by designing the genespecific primer sets that are listed in Table 1. Transcription
of each Mhc class I gene was detected as shown in Figure
4. The gene identities of the amplified cDNAs were confirmed by direct sequencing of the RT-PCR-amplified frag-

ments (indicated by yellow asterisks in Figure 4). Using
the specific primer sets, we successfully amplify most of
the identified Mhc class Ib genes, except for H2-M5, which
may be expressed at very low levels and below the limit of
detection of our RT-PCR assays. We obtained amplified
fragments of the H2-M5 gene from the brain and thymus,
but we were unable to detect amplified products in the
other tissues (data not shown).
The gene expression patterns were classified into two
types: tissue-wide or tissue-specific expression. H2-Q4, Q7, -T24, -T23, -T22 and -M3 as well as the class Ia genes
(H2-K1 and -D1) exhibited tissue-wide expression. In contrast, H2-Q1, -Q2, -Q5, -Q6, -Q10, -T15, -T13, -T11, -T10,
-T9, -T7, -T5, -T3 and -M2 genes were expressed in a tissuespecific manner. Regardless of the tissue-wide or tissuespecific expression patterns, most of the class I genes were
expressed in the thymus and intestine, both of which are
critical organs for immune defense.
The tissue expression patterns of the genes H2-T11 and T10 located within the duplicated D2 region (Figure 2) are
more tissue-restricted than those of the respective paralogous genes H2-T23 and -T22 (Figures 4 and 5) that are
located within the duplicated D1 region (Figure 2), confirming that major changes do occur in the expression

profiles and functions of recently duplicated genes. Of
particular note is the loss of expression in the liver, heart,
muscle and testis by H2-T11, as previously reported for
the liver [31], in comparison to its paralogous gene, H2T23; and the loss of expression of H2-T10 in all tissues
except the thymus, spleen, ovary and placenta in comparison to the tissue-wide expression by its paralogous gene
H2-T22. The gene paralogs, H2-T13, -T7 and -T5, all
showed tissue specific expression in the small intestine,
except that the brains of adults also expressed the H2-T13
gene, the thymus and placenta expressed the H2-T5 gene
and the thymus, ovary and placenta expressed H2-T7 (Figure 4).
The tissue expression patterns of the two flanking genes,
H2-T24 and -T3, in the H2-T region are markedly different
and may be among the oldest of the genes in this region.
The centromeric H2-T24 gene was expressed widely,
whereas the telomeric H2-T3 gene expression was
restricted to the thymus and the small intestine (Figure 4)
as previously reported [12,13].
As described above, the genes H2-Q5, -Q6 and -Q7 were
probably generated by monogenic tandem duplications.
In this regard, H2-Q7 showed the widest tissue expression,
followed by H2-Q6 and then H2-Q5. This suggests that
there might have been a gain or loss of tissue specificity

with each gene duplication event. Of the other H2-Q
genes, the most tissue-wide expression was by H2-Q4.
The Mhc gene expression in the brain is of particular interest because such genes could have a specific function in
brain development and plasticity [17]. In this study, we
identified 12 class Ib genes, H2-Q1, -Q2, -Q4, -Q7, -T24, T23, -T22, -T15, -T13, -T11, -M3 and -M5, expressed in the
brain. The Mhc gene expression in the brain warrants further investigation particularly to determine in what cells
(neurons and/or various glial cells) and at what stages of
brain development these genes are expressed.
Expression of Mhc class Ib genes in embryos and placentas
Some Mhc genes are known to express and function during development in the embryo [32,33] and/or in the placenta [34]. Therefore, we determined which of the 20 class
Ib genes were expressed in the embryo and placenta (Figure 4 and 5). The expression of some of the class Ib genes
gradually increased (e.g. H2-Q10 and -T7) or decreased
(e.g. H2-Q6 and -M3) during the course of development.
The class Ib genes that were expressed widely in the adult
tissues (H2-Q4, -Q7, -T24, -T23, -T22 and -M3) also
tended to be expressed throughout the developmental
stages. This observation suggests that the regions in which
these class Ib genes are located may have an open or accessible chromatin configuration from the time of the first

A schematic model of the expansion of the H2-T region by monogenic and multigenic tandem duplications.
This model represents monogenic and multigenic tandem duplications originating from a hypothetical ancestral H2-T genomic
sequence consisting of six H2-T genes. Each labeled box represents a H2-T gene in a linear array (horizontal) at different evolutionary times along the vertical axis. The horizontal double arrows labeled D1 and D2 represent the genomic products of the
multigenic tandem duplication, with each product consisting of four genes.

observable developmental stage. We could not detect H2T13, -T10, -T9, -T3 and -M2 in the embryo or placenta,
although H2-T13 (Blastocyst MHC) was previously shown
to express in the placenta of B6 mice [34]. This negative
result may be due to the developmental stage examined.
Tajima et al. (2003) examined Blastocyst MHC gene
expression at E3.5, E7.5 and E13.5 and expression at
E13.5 was difficult to detect [34], while we analyzed gene
expression at the developmental stages from E9.5 â E14.5.
We also examined the expression of class Ib genes in the
brains of the E14.5 embryos (Figure 5). Nine genes (H2Q1, -Q2, -Q4, -Q7, -T24, -T23, -T22, -T11 and -M3) were
transcribed in the brains of the E14.5 embryos. All of
them were also expressed in the adult brain (Figure 4),
indicating that these gene products may have a functional
role in both adult and embryonic brains.
From the RT-PCR analyses in Figure 4 and 5, we identified
alternative splicing variants in the H2-Q1, -Q10, -T24, T11, -T9 and -M5 (for M5 gene, see GenBank:AB378579)

genes. The splicing patterns can be classified into four
types: A) a common splicing pattern for class I gene, B) a
loss of alpha2 domain, C) an unspliced second intron and
D) an unspliced fourth intron. The type B variant was seen
for H2-Q10 and -M5 expression, whereas type C was
observed in H2-Q1, -T11 and -T9 expression. H2-T24
showed type D variant. It is of interest in future to determine whether these splicing variants have distinct or common functions. The type A and type B variants were
previously reported for the H2-T13 (Blastocyst MHC) gene,
and the RMA-S cell expressing the type B variant was protected from NK cell-mediated rejection via loading of its
signal peptide onto the Qa-I molecules [34].
Expression patterns between duplicated class Ib genes
Since local duplication in the H2-T region (Figure 2) have
produced gene sets with high sequence similarity (Figures
1B,C and 2) even in the upstream promoter region (Figure
3), a redundant expression pattern was expected between
the similar genes. However, as described above, the
expression patterns between similar genes were mostly

different. For example, H2-T23 was expressed widely,
whereas the H2-T11 gene paralog showed a much more
restricted expression pattern. This difference in expression
between duplicated genes was especially remarkable for
H2-T22 and -T10 expression (Figure 4) because the
sequences of the upstream promoter regions of H2-T22
and -T10 are almost identical (Figure 3). In contrast, the
H2-T13, -T5 and -T7 duplicated genes have similar nucleotide sequences, including within their promoter region,
and similar expression patterns (predominantly in small
intestine). This expression pattern, especially for H2-T5
and -T7, was almost the same as for H2-T3 that flanks
these genes (Figure 2), but exhibited no similarity in the
promoter sequence (Figure 3).
The co-expression of neighboring genes, such as H2-T24
to -T22 or H2-T15 to -T3 (Figure 2), may be regulated by
1) independent cis-acting regulatory elements for each
gene that produce similar expression patterns, or by 2) a
shared long-range regulatory element that operates over
several genes (i.e. a long-range enhancer and/or a chromatin level regulation). Model 1 is appropriate for duplicated
regions in which control regions are duplicated together
with the coding sequence [35]. This is the most likely
explanation for co-expression of H2-T5 and -T7 (Figure
3). The possibility that different promoter sequences produce a similar expression pattern might also be explained
by model 1. The 2.8 kb promoter region of H2-T3 was
shown previously to direct transgene expression in the
epithelial cells of the small and large intestine [36]. Therefore, it will be of interest in future to examine whether the
upstream regions of H2-T5 and -T7 have the same activity
as that of H2-T3 (Figure 3). We think, however, it is
unlikely that all the genes located between H2-T24 to -T22
or H2-T15 to T3 contain their own cis-regulatory element
with similar function. Considering the order of the H2-T
genes that show tissue-wide or tissue-specific expression,
we rather favor model 2. The H2-T genes with tissue-wide
expression are located within the same 40 kb centromeric
portion of the H2-T region (H2-T24 to -T22), whereas the
genes H2-T15 to -T3 located at the telomeric-end exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern with most of them
predominantly expressed in the small intestine (Figure 4).
The region containing the genes from H2-T15 to -T3 with
the restricted tissue expression spans as much as 150 kb,
which is consistent with the possibility of a long-range
regulation. The long-range regulation may provide a simple explanation of different expression patterns of similar
genes (e.g. H2-T22 and -T10) and similar expression pattern of genes with distinct promoter regions (e.g. H2-T5, T7 and -T3) over long distances. This model is supported
by recent papers that reported that a special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1), the most characterized matrix
attachment regions (MARs)-binding protein (MBP), is
involved in the tissue-specific chromatin organization of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/178

the human MHC class I locus and its expression profile
[37,38].
The mouse is known to have strain-specific gene duplications in the H2-T region with a number of duplicated H2T gene differences between strains producing considerable
variability between haplotypes [39,40]. The genomic features, organization and the expression patterns of the H2T genes in other mouse strains warrant a comparative
analysis. The expression pattern analysis of rat Mhc class
Ib genes [41] may also provide clues for our hypothesis
for the long-range regulation of duplicated class Ib gene
expression. In addition, an investigation of gene duplications in genetically modified mice may help to distinguish
between the different models involved in the regulation of
duplicated gene expression. We are currently generating
chromosomally engineered mice towards these ends.

Conclusion
We have identified 21 transcribed Mhc class Ib genes in
the H2-Q, -T and -M regions and examined their expression patterns within a wide array of developmental and
adult mouse tissues. Some of the class Ib gene products
were expressed tissue-wide, while others were expressed in
a tissue-restricted manner. These results provide a basis to
select important candidate Mhc class Ib genes for future
functional validation studies. For example, we found 12
brain-expressed class Ib genes that could have neuronal
and other functions in brain development and plasticity.
We also found that genes expressed tissue-wide are
located in the centromeric region, whereas the tissue-specifically expressed genes are located towards the telomeric
end of the H2-T region where the number of genes has
been increased by local duplication. In this region, there
are genes that showed distinct expression patterns in spite
of their similar nucleotide sequences, and there is a gene
pair that has a similar expression pattern, but dissimilar
promoter sequence regions. From these results, the presence of a long-range regulation of H2-T genes is suggested,
although we cannot dismiss the possibility that nucleotide changes in the promoter and enhancer regions have
contributed to the loss or gain of tissue-wide expression.
Since this region has diversified not only between rodent
species, but also between mouse strains, it should be a
good model region to address the relationship between
genomic organization and expression patterns.

Methods
Sequence analysis
The genomic sequences of the H2 region used in this
study were obtained from the public databases at the
NCBI Entrez Genome Project ID 9559 [42] and the
Ensembl Mouse Genome Project [43]. Although we first
analyzed the NT_039650.2 genomic contig by using a
GENSCAN program [44] to identify the Mhc class Ib

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:178

genes, we finally utilized the NCBI Mouse Build 36 containing the nearly completely annotated sequence of this
region, which was released on June 20th, 2006. Dot matrix
analysis was performed on these genomic sequences to
detect duplicated regions by using Harrplot Ver. 2.0 as
part of the computer software GENETYX package. Complete or partial coding sequences of each Mhc class I gene
was first predicted by GENSCAN, referred to the annotation, and finally confirmed by the sequencing of RT-PCR
products. These coding sequences (nucleic acids) were
aligned by the ClustalW program version 1.83 at DDBJ
[45] using the default setting and Kimura's two-parameter
method to estimate the evolutionary distances. The final
outputs as radial phylogenetic trees were generated with
the TreeView drawing software. The sequences used for
the phylogenetic tree analyses are listed in Table 2 (shown
in "Ensembl transcript ID" column for H2-Q1, -Q2, -Q5, Q6, -Q7, -Q10, -T24, -T13, -T11, -T10, -T7 and -T3, in
"NCBI accession" column for H2-Q4, and in the "Determined in this study" column for H2-T23, -T22, -T15, -T9,
-T5). PipMaker analyses were performed on selected Mhc
class Ib gene sequences to visualize the DNA sequence
similarities [46]. The genomic sequences analyzed by PipMaker contained the regulatory region 3 kb upstream
from ATG start codon and the untranslated downstream
region 1 kb from the stop codon in addition to the exon
and intron sequences.
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)
The mRNA expression of Mhc class Ib genes was determined by RT-PCR analysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated from the thymus, spleen, small intestine, liver,
kidney, lung, heart, skeletal muscle, cerebral cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, testis and ovary of adult C57BL/6J mice,
and the embryo (E9.5 â E14.5, where embryonic day 0.5
[E0.5] was defined as midday (noon) of day 1 when a vaginal plug was detected after overnight mating.), placenta
(E9.5 â E14.5), and embryonic (E14.5) brains and livers
of C57BL/6J mice using the guanidine isothiocyanate/
CsCl ultracentrifugation method. Complementary DNA
(cDNA) was synthesized from isolated RNA using the
Gene Amp RNA-PCR core kit (Applied Biosystem) with
the oligo-dT primer and 2 Î¼g RNA as template in a 40 Î¼l
volume according to the manufacture's protocol. An aliquot of 0.5 Î¼l from the 40 Î¼l of the cDNA was used for RTPCR reactions of all cDNA samples. The PCR was performed in 20 Î¼l of a total reaction volume under the following conditions: cDNA was denatured at 95Â°C for 5
min, followed by 35 cycles of amplification (95Â°C for 45
s, 58Â°C for 30 s and 72Â°C for 1 min) and 5 min at 72Â°C.
The PCR primers used for the amplifications are listed in
Table 1 (see also additional file 1). The primer sets were
manually designed to amplify specific Mhc class Ib genes
by locating the gene specific polymorphisms within 5-bp

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/178

of the 3' end as much as possible. All primers were
designed within putative cDNA to flank or cross at least
one exon-intron border. Resultant RT-PCR products were
directly sequenced to verify their identity.
3' Rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) and cloning of
class Ib cDNAs
To determine the complete cDNA sequences of H2-T5, T15, -T22, -T23 and -M5, 3'RACE was performed using
thymus or duodenum RNAs as template, the oligo-dTprimer with adapter (GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACT17.),
and the forward primers listed in Table 1. The 3'RACE
products were cloned into pBSII plasmid (STRATAGENE).
RT-PCR covering the translation start site was done using
the following forward primers designed from the genomic
sequences around the translation start codon (ATG) as
predicted by GENSCAN program:

H2-T5; TCTCCTGTATCATCATTCCCAGAT,
H2-T15; ACTGTACTGAGCTCTCTCTATCCCA,
H2-T22; AGTTTATAAAGCTGTCCAAGATCT,
H2-T23; GATTCAGGTTCCTCACAGACCCAG,
H2-M5; TGTATGAGAAGCCCTGCGCTCT, and the reverse
primer listed in Table 1. The products were also cloned
into pBSII plasmid. The nucleotide sequences of the
3'RACE and RT-PCR products were combined and analyzed.
