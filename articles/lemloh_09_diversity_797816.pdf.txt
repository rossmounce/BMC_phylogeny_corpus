Abstract
Background: Photosynthetic sponges are important components of reef ecosystems around the
world, but are poorly understood. It is often assumed that temperate regions have low diversity
and abundance of photosynthetic sponges, but to date no studies have investigated this question.
The aim of this study was to compare the percentages of photosynthetic sponges in temperate
Western Australia (WA) with previously published data on tropical regions, and to determine the
abundance and diversity of these associations in a range of temperate environments.
Results: We sampled sponges on 5 m belt transects to determine the percentage of
photosynthetic sponges and identified at least one representative of each group of symbionts using
16S rDNA sequencing together with microscopy techniques. Our results demonstrate that
photosynthetic sponges are abundant in temperate WA, with an average of 63% of sponge
individuals hosting high levels of photosynthetic symbionts and 11% with low to medium levels.
These percentages of photosynthetic sponges are comparable to those found on tropical reefs and
may have important implications for ecosystem function on temperate reefs in other areas of the
world. A diverse range of symbionts sometimes occurred within a small geographic area, including
the three "big" cyanobacterial clades, Oscillatoria spongeliae, "Candidatus Synechococcus
spongiarum" and Synechocystis species, and it appears that these clades all occur in a wide range of
sponges. Additionally, spongin-permeating red algae occurred in at least 7 sponge species. This
study provides the first investigation of the molecular phylogeny of rhodophyte symbionts in
sponges.
Conclusion: Photosynthetic sponges are abundant and diverse in temperate WA, with
comparable percentages of photosynthetic to non-photosynthetic sponges to tropical zones. It
appears that there are three common generalist clades of cyanobacterial symbionts of sponges
which occur in a wide range of sponges in a wide range of environmental conditions.

Background
Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are sessile aquatic metazoans
that are found in all aquatic habitats and have important
roles in marine ecological processes. Fossil records dating
back to the Late Cambrian era 509 million years ago show
that sponges have survived largely unchanged in their general structural organization [1]. So far about 7,000 extant
species are described [2]. As filter feeders, sponges filter
food particles from the water pumped through their body
and bacteria are the main component of the sponge diet
[3,4].
Photosynthetic sponges are very diverse in terms of the
taxonomy of hosts and symbionts and their biogeography, occurring around the world in tropical and temperate oceans. They occupy a similar niche to hard corals,
being filter-feeding benthic primary producers that provide food and shelter for a range of reef organisms. Photosynthetic
symbionts
include
cyanobacteria,
dinoflagellates, rhodophytes, chlorophytes and diatoms
[5-7]. These symbionts provide photosynthates [8-10]
and possibly fixed nitrogen [11] to the sponge host. In
addition to donating energy and carbon, cyanobacteria
may benefit sponges by the production of secondary
metabolites that act as antibacterials and deter predators
[12,13].
The most common group of photosynthetic symbionts in
sponges are the cyanobacteria, occurring in at least 38
sponge genera belonging to the Classes Calcarea and
Demospongiae [14,15]. Despite their apparent importance to many sponges, only two sponge species (Chondrilla australiensis and Diacarnus erythraenus) have been
studied to determine how they acquire their cyanobacterial symbionts. Vertical transmission, which is considered
to be an indicator for mutualism [16], was demonstrated
in both sponge species using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and molecular techniques [17-19]. This passage of the symbiont from parent to offspring may benefit
sponge larvae by providing photosynthetically fixed
energy before they are able to feed, in addition to benefiting the sessile adult sponges. Vertical transmission via
sponge larvae has also been shown for an alphaproteobacterial symbiont common to many marine sponges
[20].
It is not known conclusively if sponges that vertically
transmit symbionts are able to recognise them. Many
sponges harbor large numbers of extracellular bacteria in
their mesohyl, and if they are fed these bacteria together
with food bacteria, the sponges are able to discriminate
between them [21-23]. This suggests that the symbionts
are either "invisible" to the sponge due to a physical capsule or molecular shield (suggestions only), or that the
sponge is able to recognize them as symbionts. It is likely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/4

that different symbionts have evolved different strategies
for co-existing with sponges. Recent studies using molecular techniques show that symbiotic microorganisms in
sponges are phylogenetically diverse and that sponge-specific microbial communities exist that are different from
that of seawater [7,15,24].
A phylogenetic analysis of sponge derived cyanobacterial
16S rDNA sequences showed that more than three-quarters fell into monophyletic, sponge-specific clusters [7].
For one cluster of symbiotic cyanobacteria the name 'Candidatus Synechococcus spongiarum' was proposed [25] as
this species has not been found in water samples and is
phylogenetically distinct from its nearest free-living Synechococcus relative [26]. Recent research demonstrates that
this is the most common cyanobacterial symbiont in
sponges, occurring around the world [7]. Other important
cyanobacterial symbionts are the filamentous Oscillatoria
spongeliae and the relatively large coccoid Synechocystis
trididemni, a symbiont also found in ascidians.
Photosynthetic sponges are common in tropical regions
[27] and many of these sponges may derive a significant
proportion of their nutrition from their photosynthetic
symbionts [8]. Wilkinson [28] proposed that phototrophic sponges are more abundant in oligotrophic
waters than in areas with high nutrient levels, and this
appears to have lead to the assumption that they are
largely restricted to tropical and sub-tropical zones [29].
Although photosynthetic sponges have been well documented in tropical regions to our knowledge only one
study has investigated their abundance in a temperate
region. Roberts and colleagues [29] estimated that over
65% of temperate reef sponges from New South Wales,
Australia, may contain photosynthetic symbionts. Polar
regions represent another unique environment for sponge
symbioses. Webster et. al. [30] reported diatoms and
dinoflagellates in Antarctic sponges, but do not report
cyanobacterial symbionts. Several other studies [31-33]
have also demonstrated the presence of symbiotic diatoms in Antarctic sponges.
The existence of sponge-specific microorganisms has been
accepted but many gaps remain in our knowledge of the
identity of the symbionts, the mechanisms that affect the
microbial diversity in the sponges, and the physiology of
the symbionts. In this study we use the term 'symbiosis' as
the intimate association of two organisms, including
mutualisms and parasitism. The aim of this study was to
determine the percentages of photosynthetic sponges in a
temperate region and compare this with previous studies
of tropical regions, and to explore the biodiversity of photosynthetic symbionts of sponges and their relative abundance in temperate south-western Australian waters. 5 m
belt transects with high numbers of sponges were selected

and studied using optical and molecular techniques.
Additionally, in situ measurements of photosynthetic
activity were carried out for some sponges using a Diving
PAM (pulse-amplitude-modulation) fluorometer.

Methods
Sponge collection and preservation
5 m belt transects were located in coastal areas of temperate southern Western Australia in depths ranging from 3
m to 8.2 m and with different ecological conditions (see
Table 1). Sponge samples that were directly under the 5 m
transect line or approximately 30 cm beside the line were
collected. The study areas were located in the Perth metropolitan region (32°03'S, 115°45'E), Busselton Jetty
(33°30'S, 115°10'E), and Eagle Bay, near Busselton
(33°33.036'S, 115 °04.056'E) (Table 1. Please see Ref.
[26] for map) and were investigated using SCUBA. These
areas have high chlorophyll a levels all year indicating the
presence of nutrients, and levels are particularly high in
the winter months when rainfall and run-off washes fertilizers and other nutrient sources into the ocean [34]. The
light level categories 'low', 'medium' and 'high' were
determined at the study sites based on the presence of
caves or overhangs and depth. A diving pulse-amplitudemodulated (PAM) fluorometer was used whenever possible to determine the presence of photosynthesis in
sponges, and samples were only collected from sponges
with a positive result. Where the PAM was not used all
sponges on the transect were collected and assessed in the
laboratory for photosymbionts using fluorescence microscopy. Each sample was divided into four parts and preserved in 75% ethanol, saturated DMSO solution pH 7.5
(20% DMSO, 0.25 M Na2EDTA pH 8, NaCl to saturation),
2.5% glutaraldehyde and -20°C on return to shore. All
samples were collected with permissions and are stored at
the Western Australian Museum.
PAM fluorometry
An underwater pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometer (Diving-PAM, Walz GmbH, Germany) was used
on all sponges on transects EB, BJ and Mn prior to sampling to determine which sponges were positive for photosynthesis. This allowed us to sample only sponges with

photosynthetic symbionts, preventing unnecessary environmental damage and saving time. Sponges with visible
surface contamination were brushed with a tooth brush
before PAM readings were taken. To record rapid light
curves a surface holder "DIVING-SH" was fixed on the
sponge. Rapid light curves first measured the maximal
YIELD in the absence of actinic light, followed by a series
of 8 consecutive YIELD-measurements with increasing
light intensity. The measuring intensity was 12 and the
saturating light pulse intensity was 10 (width 0.8 seconds). The actinic light intensity at the beginning of the
light curve measurement was 2 and the step width was 10
seconds. If the YIELD was less than 0.1 at the beginning of
the measurement the sample was defined as 'negative' for
photosynthetic symbionts. These sponges were noted, but
not collected. As we lacked the equipment necessary to
determine absorbance and reflection of light of different
sponges, absolute levels of photosynthetic efficiency
could not be determined.
Light Microscopy
All samples were analyzed via fluorescence microscopy to
determine the presence, distribution and density of photosynthetic symbionts. Fresh sponge samples were
washed with autoclaved sea water and cross sections were
cut thinly using a double-sided razor. The sections were
examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Leitz Diaplan microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Blue
light, using a I3 filter block (450–490 nm excitation filter
and 515 barrier filter), and green light, using a N2.1 filter
block (515–560 nm excitation filter and 590 barrier filter), were used to detect the distribution and concentration of autofluorescent cyanobacterial or algal pigments.
Cyanobacterial and rhodophyte autofluorescence
appeared orange-yellow using blue light due to the presence of phycobiliproteins, and were red in colour using
green light, while algae (other than rhodophytes)
appeared red in blue light. All samples were categorized
according to a subjective analysis of the levels of autofluorescence from photosynthetic pigments (Table 2) and
the categories 'low', 'medium' and 'high' were given to
describe the densities of symbionts. Samples with no
autofluorescence and ambiguous samples (very low

were called 'negative'.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Fresh sponge biopsies (~2 mm3) were fixed in 2.5% EM
grade glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0
(0.05 M NaH2PO4 and 0.05 M Na2HPO4) for 3 hours then
post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.05 M phosphate buffer for 1
1/2 hours. The specimens were dehydrated in an ethanol
series and 100% propylene oxide, then embedded in
Spurr's resin [35]. Ultra-thin sections (90 – 150 nm) were
cut using a Reichert ultramicrotome (Leica, Ultracut) with
glass knifes. Sections were transferred to naked copper
grids (75 × 300 mesh) and stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 15 minutes and lead citrate [36] in carbon
dioxide free conditions for 10 minutes. The specimens
were washed in double distilled water and air dried,
before examination with a JEOL 2000 FX electron microscope (JOEL Ltd., Japan) operating at 80 kV.
PCR
To avoid surface contamination the sponge samples were
brushed with a toothbrush and rinsed with distilled water.
Distribution of symbionts in the sponge tissue was examined via fluorescence microscopy and, where possible,
about 1 mm of the sponge surface was removed with a
double-sided razor to reduce surface contamination.
Approximately 1 mm3 pieces of sponge tissue were placed
directly into the PCR reaction mixes after soaking in
ddH2O for 5 minutes. Cyanobacterial-specific primers
were used to amplify cyanobacterial DNA in sponges. The
forward primer cya359F (5'-GGGGAATYTTCCGCAATGGG) [37] and the reverse primer cya1459R (5'GGTAAYGACTTCGGGCRT) [38] were used to amplify a
1100 base pair section of the small subunit of ribosomal
RNA (16S rDNA). For Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) a 40-nucleotide GC clamp (5'CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCG-

GGGGCACGGGGGG-3') was added to the forward
primer cya359F and used with the reverse primer cya781
[37]. 25 μl PCR reactions contained final concentrations
of 0.08 U/μl BIOTAQ DNA Polymerase (BIOLINE Australia), 1 × NH4 Buffer, 2 mM dNTP mix, 2.5 mM MgCl2
and 0.6 μM of each oligonucleotide primer. The following
program was used to amplify cyanobacterial DNA: one
cycle of 94°C for 4 min, 60°C for 2 min and 72°C for 2
min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1
min and 72°C for 1 min. The program ended with 72°C
for 4 min and a 4°C store. For DGGE the following PCR
program was used: 95°C for 15 min, followed by 94°C for
1 min, 68°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min. For each subsequent cycle the temperature of annealing was reduced
by 1°C until it reached 60°C, whereupon the cycle was
repeated 22 times. The PCR was ended with an extension
step at 72°C for 10 minutes and a 4°C hold. All PCR reactions were carried out under S1 conditions at CSIRO laboratories.
Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis
20 μL of PCR product were added to 10 μL of loading
buffer and run on a 7% polyacrylamide gel with a denaturing gradient of 20 to 60%. The wells and the top of the
gel were formed with 0% urea. The gel was run for 3.5
hours at 180 V, then stained in 20 mg of ethidium bromide/ml in 1 × TAE (40 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM acetic acid,
1 mM EDTA pH 8) for 15 minutes. Bands were visualised
on a UV transilluminator, excised, placed in 15 μL of
ddH2O and stored at -20°C for sequencing reactions.
Sequencing
PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) as per manufacturers
instructions, the DNA quantified with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000 NanoDrop Technologies,
USA), and 10–20 ng of product used as a template for
direct sequencing reactions. Sequencing reactions were

analysed using an ABI automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) at a commercial facility (Royal Perth Hospital, West Australian Genome Resource Centre). Both
DNA strands were sequenced using the original primers
and a 10 μl reaction mix containing 2 μl of BigDye Terminator Mix (BDTM) version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems,
USA). Chromatographs were checked by eye using the
software Chromas Lite version 2.0 and ambiguous parts
were removed. The basic local alignment search tool
(BLAST) [39] was used to compare sample sequences to
other bacterial sequences found on the database NCBI
(National Center for Biotechnology Information). Pairwise comparisons were made with EMBL-EBI Emboss
Pairwise Alignment Algorithms http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
emboss/align. Sequences were deposited in the GenBank
database under the following accession numbers:
EU383035 to EU383052.

Results
Abundance of photosynthetic sponges
A total of 63 different sponge species from 7 transects were
examined for the presence of photosymbionts. 30 sponge
species had high levels of autofluorescence and were categorized as 'positive' for photosymbionts (48%). 10 species had 'low to medium' levels of autofluorescence
(16%) and 23 species were 'negative' (36%) (Table 2).
Samples with a positive PAM fluorometry result had
medium to high cyanobacterial autofluorescence. The
observation of sponges with low to medium levels of
autofluorescence, and correspondingly low PAM readings, was unexpected. As the nature of these associations
is not known, we did not count these sponges as positive
or negative for photosynthetic symbioses, but made a separate category for them.

Between 2 and 22 photosynthetic sponge individuals and
2 to 13 photosynthetic sponge species occurred on the
transects, and the percent and number of photosynthetic
sponge species was higher for the southern sites at Eagle
Bay and Busselton Jetty (Table 2). Of the photosynthetic
sponges only three species, Chondrilla australiensis, Chondropsis sp. and Mycale sp., occurred on more than one
transect. However, other photosynthetic sponges were

observed at multiple sites, but did not occur on more than
one transect line. Many sponges could not be identified to
known species, and probably represent previously poorly
described or new species.
Types of photosynthetic symbionts in sponges: Molecular
and microscopy results
Sequences were obtained for the symbionts of 10 photosynthetic sponges. Symbionts from Crella sp., a Calcarea
species, Lissodendoryx sp., Phyllospongia sp., Cymbastela
marshae and Hippospongia sp. were sequenced directly
using the primers cya359F and cya1459R. The sequencing
of symbionts in a number of other sponges was problematic and may have been caused by multiple factors including, in some instances, the presence of more than one type
of symbiont. DGGE of amplified 16SrDNA from 7
sponges was performed (Figure 1) where this was suspected. Sequencing of the resulting bands was successful
for Spongia sp., Mycale sp. 1, Chondropsis sp., Xestospongia
sp., and Psammastra sp., resulting in sequences less than
450 bp. An overview of these results is given in Table 3.
Synechococcus species
The cyanobacterial symbionts of Crella sp. (transect WP1)
and an unidentified Calcarea species (EB) were identified
as two different Synechococcus strains with 16S rDNA analysis (Table 3). Crella sp. only had medium levels of cyanobacterial autofluorescence and the symbiont sequence
resulted in a close GenBank match with the free-living
Synechococcus strain WH 8016 (99.6% sequence similarity
to accession number AY172834). The 16S rDNA sequence
of the Calcarea species symbiont resulted in 98.8%
sequence similarity to another free-living Synechococcus
(accession number DQ248009.1). This sponge had high
levels of cyanobacterial autofluorescence and a relatively
high PAM reading of 6.5 maximal relative ETR (electron
transport rate).

Cyanobacterial symbionts belonging to the "Candidatus
Synechococcus spongiarum" clade were identified in four
sponge species: Hippospongia sp., Phyllospongia sp., Psammastra sp. and Chondrilla australiensis, based on 16S rDNA
sequencing and BLAST searches. All were closely related to

existing sequences for this symbiont on GenBank, with
similarities over 99%. All four sponge species showed
high concentrations of small unicellular coccoid cyanobacteria with fluorescence microscopy. TEM of S. spongiarum in Hippospongia sp. showed intercellular
cyanobacteria about 1 μm long with 4 thylakoid spirals
and typical ultrastructure for this symbiont. Some were
observed dividing by binary fission (Figure 2a and 2b).
Synechococcus-like cyanobacteria were the most common
photosynthetic symbionts found in this study. Other
sponges that contained medium or high levels of small
single-celled cyanobacteria resembling Synechococcus by
light and fluorescence microscopy included an Aplysinidae species, Lissodendoryx (Anomodoryx) sp., Halichondrida (Dictyonellidae?), Tethya sp., Dendrilla sp., Haliclona
(Haliclona) sp., Xestospongia sp. and Callyspongia sp. however, these were not sequenced.

Oscillatoria spongeliae clade
Oscillatoria spongeliae was sequenced from one species of
Chondropsis, and had a GenBank similarity score of 99.3%
to a sponge-associated Oscillatoria spongeliae accession
number AY615504 [40]. Fluorescence microscopy
showed high concentrations of intercellular cyanobacteria, and TEM of Chondropsis sp. showed trichomes approximately 4 μm in diameter containing 3 or more cells of
variable length (not shown). Their ultrastructure was similar to those in Rützler [6], with domed terminal cells, thylakoids radiating from the centre of cells, and
carboxysomes sometimes observed. Phycobiliproteins
apparently leak from cells when samples are frozen, causing high background autofluorescence.
Synechocystis species
16S rDNA DGGE of Spongia sp. symbionts resulted in two
bands (Figure 1) that, when sequenced, were only 2 base
pairs different. The highest identity score from a BLAST
search was 97.4% with the 16S rDNA gene of Synechocystis
trididemni (accession number AB011380). High numbers
of intercellular single-celled cyanobacteria were observed
using fluorescence microscopy, and vacuolated, non-spiral thylakoid membranes were observed with TEM (not
shown). Mycale sp. 1 contained two different Synechocystis
species that had 94.3% and 96.7% similarity to Synechocystis trididemni (accession number AY845229), and
had 96.6% similarity to each other. Fluorescence and light
microscopy revealed smaller green coccoid cyanobacteria
about 10 μm in diameter, and a larger red coccoid symbiont approximately 15 μm in diameter growing in close
proximity (Figure 3). Autofluorescence also differed
between these symbionts, with the red cyanobacteria
emitting orange/red wavelengths and the green cyanobacteria emitting yellow/green wavelengths. High numbers of
Synechocystis-like cyanobacteria were also observed in Xestospongia sp. and Phorbas sp. by fluorescence and light
microscopy.
Unknown Symbionts
Cymbastela marshae contained a symbiont with 99.7% 16S
rDNA similarity to the symbiont previously found in Cymbastela marshae from Fremantle (accession number
AY190174; [19]). This symbiont has 98.6% sequence
identity to Oscillatoria rosea and 97% sequence identity to
a Synechococcus sp. (accession number AF448076).

DGGE using 16S rDNA resulted in three bands for a Xestospongia sp. (Figure 1). One band had 99% sequence similarity to an uncultured sponge bacterium, another closely
matched a chloroplast sequence. Sequencing was not successful for the third band. Other types of photosynthetic
symbiont may occur, as this study restricted sequencing to
representatives of the major groups.

A rhodophyte species was found to be associated with the

score was 95% for the accession number AY731518, the
16S rDNA gene of Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta). Fluorescence microscopy indicated that similar symbionts also
occurred along the spongin fibres of Crella sp., Clathria

chota cf. baculifera. Sponge skeletons appear red where the
densities of rhodophytes are high. TEM observations
show the rhodophytes occur inside spongin fibres, splitting them as they grow (Figure 4b), although it is not
known if this always occurs. The ultrastructure of the symbionts is similar to Acrochaetium spongicolum in Mycale laxissima observed by Rützler [6]. Both Lissodendoryx sp. and
Mycale sp. 2 were semi-translucent and encrusting or fanshaped, however rhodophytes were observed throughout
the matrix of several densely pigmented sponges. Two
species of Clathria sp. and one Crella sp. were opaque
orange and a Dictyodendrilla sp. was opaque grey. Dictyodendrilla sp. was the only species harboring rhodophytes
without siliceous spicule bundles within the fibres. This
sponge had relatively low PAM readings (relative ETR of
2.2) in comparison to Mycale sp. 2 (Figure 5).
PAM fluorometry
Both Psammastra sp. and Phyllospongia sp. hosted Synechococcus spongiarum and occurred in close proximity in the
same light conditions. However, the recorded light curves
show saturation for Psammastra sp. at around 163 μmol
quanta m-2s-1 with a maximal relative ETR of 7.8 while
Phyllospongia sp. saturated at 120 μmol quanta m-2s-1 with
a maximal relative ETR of 8.4 (Figure 5). The light curve
for Cymbastela marshae (symbiont Oscillatoria sp.) showed
saturation of photosynthetic electron transport at around
163 μmol quanta m-2s-1 and the maximal relative electron
transport rate was 11.2. Spongia sp. hosted a Synechocystis
trididemni like symbiont and saturated at 120 μmol
quanta m-2s-1 with a maximal relative ETR of 4.9. Using
molecular techniques a Synechococcus sp. was detected in a

Calcarea species and the light curve showed saturation at
120 μmol quanta m-2s-1with a maximal relative ETR of
6.3. A rhodophyte symbiont was found in Mycale sp. 2
with saturation at around 240 μmol quanta m-2s-1 and a
maximal relative ETR of 4.8.
Rapid light curves contain information that enables the
determination of quantum yields (Y) of photosystem II
and induction and saturation characteristics of photosynthesis, and can therefore be used to compare sponges harboring the same symbionts under different light
conditions. However, as the number of measurements for
identical sponge species from different transects was too
low, this analysis was not conducted. Nonetheless, the
method provides an indication of the saturation characteristics of different sponge symbionts that occur close to
each other in the same light conditions.

Discussion
This study is the first to demonstrate that photosynthetic
sponges are abundant and diverse in a temperate region in
south Western Australia. An average of 48% of species and
63% of individuals were found to be strongly photosynthetic, with an additional 16% of species and 11% of individuals having low to medium levels of photosynthetic
symbionts. These percentages are comparable to those
found in temperate south east Australia. Roberts and colleagues [29] estimated that over 65% of the sponges from
that region may contain photosynthetic symbionts. These
percentages are also comparable to those found on tropical reefs. Steindler et al. [27] found an average of 71.5% of
sponge species in the Caribbean were photosynthetic,
while Erwin and Thacker [41] report that over 30% of
sponge species, also in the Caribbean, were photosynthetic. Wilkinson [28] demonstrated an average of 40.2%
of sponge species were photosynthetic on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, with a similar percentage
reported for the Caribbean, and Rützler [6] reported that
45% of sponges on Caribbean reefs hosted small unicellular cyanobacteria. Sponges containing photosynthetic
symbionts occurred in 20–75% of sponge diversity
reported at Carrie Bow Cay (Belize) [42] on 10 m line
transects. The percentages of 48–64% photosynthetic
sponges per transect observed in our study are comparable
to these data.
Symbionts belonging to the "Candidatus Synechococcus
spongiarum" clade were the most common cyanobacteria, however, Synechocystis species and Oscillatoria spongeliae were also found, along with other Synechococcus
species and a species of red algae (Rhodophyta).
Sponge hosts containing these symbionts sometimes
occurred in close proximity to one another, but it is
unknown how the symbionts are acquired by their hosts.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/4

The mode of symbiont transmission is only known for
one sponge species that occurs in WA, Chondrilla australiensis, and this species transmits cyanobacterial symbionts
vertically from parent to offspring via the eggs, and sometimes the sperm [19]. However, other symbioses may
have different modes of transmission and acquisition of
symbionts. If cyanobacterial symbionts occur in the water
column sponges must be highly selective for symbiont
type. Some of these symbioses are likely to be ancient, and
their establishment in nutrient-rich coastal regions where
free-living Synechococcus are particularly common [43] is
possibly encouraged via a close, long-term association
[44].
" Candidatus Synechococcus spongiarum"
The "Candidatus Synechococcus spongiarum" clade is the
largest sponge-specific clade of bacterial symbionts
known, and Taylor et al. [7] reported a total of 21 sponge
species from which it has been sequenced. Since then
Erwin and Thacker [41] have sequenced S. spongiarum in a
further 9 sponge species. We found three additional
sponge species, Hippospongia sp., Phyllospongia sp. and
Psammastra sp. with this symbiont in high concentrations,
bringing the total number of sponge species known to
have this symbiont to 33.
Synechocystis trididemni
This is the first report of Synechocystis trididemni like symbionts from temperate Australia. This symbiont was
reported in the sponges Prianos aff. melanos, Spirastrella aff.
decumbens, in an unidentified sponge on the Great Barrier
Reef, Australia [45], and in sponges from Palau [46] and
New Zealand [47]. We obtained two 16S rDNA Synechocystis sequences from each of the sponges Spongia sp.
and Mycale sp. 1. The symbionts from Spongia sp. differed
by only 2 base pairs, and had 97.4% and 97.2% sequence
identity to S. trididemni from the colonial ascidian Trididemnum solidum. The two symbionts in Mycale sp. 1 were
only 96.6% identical to each other, suggesting that there
are two different Synechocystis species within the same
sponge. When viewed with light and fluorescence microscopy two types of symbiont were observed in Mycale sp. 1,
a smaller green coccoid cyanobacterium about 10 μm in
diameter, and a larger red coccoid symbiont approximately 15 μm in diameter. Autofluorescence wavelengths
also differed, suggesting differences in phycobiliprotein
concentrations, despite their close proximity within the
host sponge. These two symbionts possibly have maximum photosynthetic efficiencies at different wavelengths,
enabling their host to grow in a wider range of light levels.
Two more sponge species, Xestospongia sp. and Phorbas sp.
contained relatively large coccoid cyanobacteria, resembling Synechocystis, in high concentrations.

Oscillatoria spongeliae
The cyanobacterium Oscillatoria spongeliae is possibly best
known from Dysidea sp., but has been described from a
number of sponges in different areas of the world, including Palau [40] and Guam [48]. It was observed in Dysidea
sp. on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia [49,50], but this is
the first report of O. spongeliae in Western Australia, where
it occurs in high densities in the surface tissues of a Chondropsis species.
Unknown Symbiont
The distinctive "hairy" cyanobacterium in Cymbastela marshae has not been observed in other sponges, or reported
as free-living, but was again found in this study. Its phylogeny is uncertain, however, it has 98.6% sequence identity to Oscillatoria rosea. It occurs in high densities within
the sponge and symbioses appear to be stable over time
and space, having been found in Cymbastela marshae in
Fremantle [26], and Busselton, WA (this study), in different years. Taylor and co-workers recently demonstrated a
phylogenetic relationship with Oscillatoria rosea and the
Synechococcus sp. strain PCC7002 [7].
Rhodophyta
Filamentous rhodophytes with similar gross morphology
were observed in at least 7 sponge species in this study,
growing through and over spongin fibres and giving them
a red colouration. Similar spongin-permeating algae,
Ostreobium cf. constrictum and Acrochaetium spongicolum,
were described from Belize [6], and the Mediterranean
[51]. Rhodophyte/sponge symbioses also occur on the
Great Barrier Reef, Australia [52], and in southern Australia [5], however, in these symbioses the algae are considerably larger.

This study is the first to investigate the molecular phylogeny of rhodophyte symbionts in sponges. Our 16S rDNA
sequence of this symbiont in Lissodendoryx sp. was 95%
identical to Palmaria palmata, and may be a new species.
However, further work is needed to establish if all 7
sponge species host the same species of rhodophyte.
Using TEM, their ultrastructure was similar to Acrochaetium spongicolum in Mycale laxissima observed by Rützler
[6]. There were no indications that the rhodophytes harm
the host, although this is possible as the algae are sponginboring in at least some cases. In the Haliclona cymaeformis/
Ceratodictyon spongiosum symbiosis the rhodophyte partner donates a small amount of photosynthate to the
sponge host [53], and may provide support [52]. In return
the rhodophyte partner benefits from the provision of
nitrogen by the sponge, boosting algal growth rates in
comparison to algae not in symbiosis [53]. Neither Haliclona cymaeformis or Ceratodictyon spongiosum have been
observed living without the other partner [52].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/4

Sponges containing rhodophytes included densely pigmented orange and dark grey species, and it is interesting
that algae can grow successfully deep in the body of these
sponges. It is possible that light is conducted to the algae
by spicules, as all the sponge species containing rhodophytes in this study except Dictyodendrilla sp. have siliceous spicule bundles contained within the fibres on
which the algae grow. Like cyanobacteria, but unlike most
other algae, rhodophytes contain phycobiliproteins.
These accessory photosynthetic proteins capture a broad
range of the light spectrum and enable organisms to grow
at much lower light intensities than terrestrial plants [54].
It would therefore seem that, like cyanobacteria, rhodophytes are able to grow in the low light intensities found
within the matrix of sponge hosts, and are closely associated with the spongin fibres both for physical support and
light transmission via the spicules. The transport of
photo-active radiation via spicules was recently shown in
a living Tethya aurantium [55].
Levels of cyanobacterial autofluorescence
It is interesting that different levels of cyanobacterial densities were observed in sponges in this study, ranging from
low to high. Sponges with very high densities of cyanobacteria resulted in a strongly positive PAM result, while other
sponges with low to medium concentrations of symbionts
resulted in low to medium PAM readings. Similar observations have been made by Erwin and Thacker [41], who
found low and intermediate chlorophyll a levels in
sponges in the Caribbean, but the nature of this type of
association is unknown. It is possible that sponges in the
"low" density group retained free-living cyanobacteria
from the water column on which they were feeding, either
in choanocytes or other areas of the body, and for this reason they were not included in the group that was positive
for photosynthetic symbionts. The cyanobacteria in the
"medium" density group may also result from water column feeding, but it is not known if these are retained by
the sponge over time i.e. symbionts. The cyanobacteria in
one sponge from the "medium" group, a Crella sp., were
closely related to free-living Synechococcus species. This
may represent a nascent symbiosis in which the cyanobacterial symbionts and sponge host are negotiating the association, with symbionts being consumed more often than
is usually the case. However, it is interesting to note that
the unidentified Calcarea species also had symbionts
closely related to free-living cyanobacteria but these
occurred consistently in this species and at high concentrations.

Sponges with microbial symbionts must have regulatory
mechanisms to avoid symbionts overwhelming host tissues. Several of these mechanisms have been proposed
including the sponge consuming enough of the products
from photosynthesis to restrict cyanobacterial growth,

Page 10 of 13

and the sponge eating or ejecting the symbionts when
stressed [7,56]. However, we still lack a clear picture of the
factors and mechanisms that control these associations.
More experimental work is needed to determine spongesymbiont interactions and regulation.
The Diving PAM was a useful method for determining
photosynthetic sponges in situ, and provided an indication of the density of photosynthetic symbionts in the
sponge tissue.
DGGE using 16S rDNA was useful for separating and
sequencing cyanobacterial symbionts where more than
one species was present within a host. However, it appears
that our gel would have benefited from running longer
than the 3 1/2 hours we used, as the bands for "Candidatus
Synechococcus spongiarum" and Oscillatoria spongeliae
were not noticeably separated. It is interesting that
sponges containing more than one photosynthetic symbiont are relatively common.
Occurrence of photosynthetic sponges
There are likely to be a number of factors that influence
the occurrence of photosynthetic sponges, including light
conditions, sedimentation and possibly nutrient levels. In
WA the Leeuwin Current transports nutrient-poor water
from the tropics southwards in winter, however, this flows
well offshore from our sampling sites. Chlorophyll a levels in the water column at inshore locations indicate that
nutrient levels remain relatively high all year, but are particularly high in the wet winter months from run-off from
land, reaching 1 mg m-3 [34]. During the summer months
the Capes Current, which begins in the Cape Leeuwin and
Naturaliste region (close to our sampling sites at Busselton Jetty and Eagle Bay), is created from an upwelling of
cold, nutrient-rich water [34], potentially influencing
nutrient levels at our more southerly sampling sites.

Interestingly, the percentage of photosynthetic sponge
species was higher at the Busselton Jetty and Eagle Bay
sites than in the Perth metropolitan region. Sediment levels were noticeably higher at the latter sites, potentially
affecting the success of photosynthetic sponges. Wilkinson [28] observed higher percentages of phototrophic
sponges with increasing distance from land on both the
GBR and in the Caribbean, perhaps also as a result of
decreasing sediment load at offshore sites.

mon generalist clades of cyanobacterial symbionts of
sponges, "Candidatus Synechococcus spongiarum", Synechocystis trididemni like symbionts, and Oscillatoria spongeliae which occur in a wide range of sponges in a wide
range of environmental conditions. Further research is
needed to examine the different levels of photosynthetic
symbionts and the factors and mechanisms that control
these associations.

Conclusion

The high diversity and abundance of photosynthetic
sponges found in this study indicates they are as important in temperate Western Australia as they are in tropical
zones. Other temperate areas need to be examined to
determine if WA is unusual in this respect, or if this finding can be generalized. It appears that there are three com-
