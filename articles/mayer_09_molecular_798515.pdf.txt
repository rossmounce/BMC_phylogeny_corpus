Abstract
Background: Nematodes are putatively the most species-rich animal phylum. They have various
life styles and occur in a variety of habitats, ranging from free-living nematodes in aquatic or
terrestrial environments to parasites of animals and plants. The rhabditid nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans is one of the most important model organisms in modern biology. Pristionchus pacificus of
the family of the Diplogastridae has been developed as a satellite model for comparison to C.
elegans. The Diplogastridae, a monophyletic clade within the rhabditid nematodes, are frequently
associated with beetles. How this beetle-association evolved and whether beetle-nematode
coevolution occurred is still elusive. As a prerequisite to answering this question a robust
phylogeny of beetle-associated Diplogastridae is needed.
Results: Sequences for the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA and for 12 ribosomal protein
encoding nucleotide sequences were collected for 14 diplogastrid taxa yielding a dataset of 5996
bp of concatenated aligned sequences. A molecular phylogeny of beetle-associated diplogastrid
nematodes was established by various algorithms. Robust subclades could be demonstrated
embedded in a phylogenetic tree topology with short internal branches, indicating rapid ancestral
divergences. Comparison of the diplogastrid phylogeny to a comprehensive beetle phylogeny
revealed no major congruence and thus no evidence for a long-term coevolution.
Conclusion: Reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of beetle-associated Diplogastridae yields
four distinct subclades, whose deep phylogenetic divergence, as indicated by short internal branch
lengths, shows evidence for evolution by successions of ancient rapid radiation events. The stem
species of the Diplogastridae existed at the same time period when the major radiations of the
beetles occurred. Comparison of nematode and beetle phylogenies provides, however, no
evidence for long-term coevolution of diplogastrid nematodes and their beetle hosts. Instead,
frequent host switching is observed. The molecular phylogeny of the Diplogastridae provides a
framework for further examinations of the evolution of these associations, for the study of
interactions within the ecosystems, and for investigations of diplogastrid genome evolution.

Background
Nematodes constitute one of the largest animal phyla,
both in number of species and in number of individuals
[1]. They occur in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments as free-living species, as well as parasites of
plants and animals in a high variety of ecosystems. A consistent evolutionary framework using molecular data was
provided by Blaxter et al. [2] and expanded by Holterman
et al. [3].
Nematodes represent an attractive system for evolutionary
developmental biology, given that some species can easily
be cultured in the laboratory. One such system is the
diplogastrid nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which has
been established as a laboratory model organism and satellite system to the rhabditid nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [4,5]. Molecular, genetic, and genomic toolkits have
been developed and the P. pacificus genome has recently
been sequenced [6]. A detailed genetic comparison of sex
determination, vulva and gonad development reveals
how developmental processes changed between P. pacificus and C. elegans [7-10]. Such studies can elucidate the
mechanisms by which developmental novelty is generated [11].
P. pacificus and C. elegans do not only differ in their development but also in their ecology. The ecological niche
occupied by Pristionchus shows a close association to beetles, preferentially to members of the Scarabaeidae, but
also to the Colorado potato beetle, a chrysomelid [12-14].
Important factors for host recognition appear to be provided by chemical cues emanated from the beetles
[15,16]. For example, P. pacificus was frequently obtained
from the oriental beetle Exomala orientalis in Japan and the
United States and is the only Pristionchus species that is
attracted to the oriental beetle sex pheromone (Z)-7-tetradecen-2-one in olfactory studies [14].
Evolutionary and comparative studies, like the ones mentioned above, require a robust phylogeny. A phylogenetic
tree of the genus Pristionchus served as a first step in providing such a framework [17]. However, a full phylogenetic consideration has to involve higher taxa and has to
place the genus Pristionchus into i) the family of the
Diplogastridae and ii) more generally, clade V nematodes.
While Kiontke et al. [18] convincingly placed the
Diplogastridae as a monophyletic clade within the family
of the Rhabditidae, few attempts have been made to provide a molecular phylogeny of the Diplogastridae family.
Ultimately, such studies are necessary to elucidate macroevolutionary traits and patterns (such as characteristics of
vulva developmental, olfaction-guided behaviour, acquisition of new genes or gene functions and others) for
both, the comparison of taxa within the Diplogastridae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/212

(i.e. the origin of Pristionchus and Pristionchus traits) and
the comparison of Pristionchus to C. elegans.
Based on morphological characters, the Diplogastridae
have been revised and reclassified into 28 genera by Sudhaus and Fürst von Lieven [19]. Many of the diplogastrid
genera are fully associated with beetles, i.e. they are carried
by beetles or live in habitats closely linked to beetle activity. In some other genera, a single species shows a nematode-beetle association. Molecular phylogenies involving
the deeper level phylogeny of the Diplogastridae are limited. To our knowledge, only two attempts have been
made by Holterman et al. and Kiontke et al., who placed
four diplogastrid taxa as a monophyletic clade within the
family Rhabditidae [3,18].
In order to understand the ecosystems, in which Pristionchus evolved and to provide a framework for behavioural
and comparative genomics studies we set out to reconstruct robust phylogenetic relationships of beetle-associated diplogastrids. We collected molecular data from 12
ribosomal protein genes representing 14 diplogastrid genera. In total, we used 2148 parsimony-informative characters for phylogenetic analyses. Our data identify four
distinct subclades within the Diplogastridae. Furthermore, our dataset suggests that the observed patterns of
beetle associations is driven by host switching rather than
nematode beetle coevolution.

Results
Collection of nematodes
Seventeen nematode taxa, representing 14 diplogastrid
genera, plus one outgroup, Rhabditoides inermis, were
selected according to whether some, or all of their members, showed direct association with beetles or shared the
same habitat (Table 1) [19-24]. Whenever possible, established and characterized nematode lines were chosen. For
the remaining taxa, host beetles were collected in their
respective habitat and nematodes carried by them were
isolated as described by Herrmann et al. [12]. Emerging
nematodes were assigned to genus level by Nomarski
microscopy following the keys given by Andràssy and
Sudhaus and Fürst von Lieven [19,21]. Where possible,
established strains were kept as growing cultures in the
laboratory and as permanent frozen stocks.
Identification and estimation of relationship of
diplogastrid genera by SSU analysis
To obtain a first set of molecular phylogenetic characters
a 1 kb-fragment of the nuclear SSU was amplified and 0.5
kb of the sequence at the 5' end was determined as
described in Mayer et al. [17]. The sequences of all
diplogastrid samples were aligned together with
diplogastrid nuclear SSU sequences from the GenBank

database [25]. Rhabditoides inermis served as outgroup. A
maximum likelihood tree was constructed using the phylogeny.fr server [26]. All species within a genus, i. e. all
Pristionchus species and both Koerneria species, were
placed in distinct clusters separated from other genera by
long branches (Figure 1). However, internal nodes connecting different genera received only moderate to low
support values. Thus an extended dataset is required to
better resolve the phylogeny. To avoid inferring the genus
tree from a single, although in itself possibly robust, gene
tree we opted to acquire a dataset of ribosomal protein
gene-derived ESTs representing major parts of the
genome.
Phylogenetic analyses
Single ML gene trees for the 12 ribosomal protein genes
and the SSU segment were obtained and a consensus tree
was generated (Additional file 1). Internal node topologies in the derived consensus tree were recovered at a low
percentage only due to incongruent single gene trees.
However, major clades could be distinguished as has
already been indicated in the initial SSU-based tree. Three
major clades were identified. The genera Diplogasteroides,
Pseudodiplogasteroides, Diplogastrellus, and Rhabditidoides
clustered in one group; the second group consisted of
Mononchoides, Neodiplogaster, and Tylopharynx and the
third group encompassed Diplogasteriana, Acrostichus, and
Micoletzkya. Individual species of a genus always grouped
together. A conspicuous finding in the phylogenetic tree is
that both members of the genus Koerneria adopted a basal
position to the other diplogastrids (Additional file 1).

For a combined analysis of all sequenced genes, the single
gene alignments of the ribosomal protein and the SSU
genes were concatenated to yield a final dataset of 18
aligned sequences of 5996 bp in length. For the analyses,
216 sites at gapped positions were excluded. Of the
remaining 5750 sites, 2899 were constant, 703 were variable but parsimony-uninformative, and 2148 were parsimony informative.
MP, NJ and ML trees were reconstructed as described (see
Material and Methods)[27,28]. Figure 2 displays the
resulting trees rooted by Rhabditoides inermis as outgroup.
Again, conspicuious clustering of (1) the genera Diplogasteroides, Pseudodiplogasteroides, Diplogastrellus, and Rhabditidoides, of (2) the genera Mononchoides, Neodiplogaster,
and Tylopharynx, and of (3) Diplogasteriana and Acrostichus
was observed. In the NJ tree (Figure 2B), the first clade,
though, also includes Oigolaimella. The topological
arrangement of these clusters, however, received low statistical support. The position of four genera remained
undetermined. These were Pristionchus, Micoletzkya, Oigolaimella, and Myctolaimus.
Bayesian inference
Additional support for the deduced phylogenetic relationship was obtained by Bayesian inference. The complete
concatenated dataset was evaluated by the MrBayes 3.1.2
software, applying the GTR+I+G substitution model
(Additional file 1), and by its modification as in the BEST
software, which estimates the joint posterior distribution
of gene trees and species (Figure 2D) [29,30]. Both trees

Figure 1 likelihood tree of diplogastrid SSU sequences
Maximum
Maximum likelihood tree of diplogastrid SSU sequences. Sequences of 21 Pristionchus species ([17] and unpublished
data) and 14 diplogastrid SSU sequences retrieved from the GenBank database or obtained from isolates described here were

showed congruent topologies. Strong support by posterior probability values of 1.0 was given to the clades
defined by the MP, NJ, and ML procedures. While the phylogenetic position of Myctolaimus and Oigolaimella still
remained elusive in those analyses, Bayesian inference
clustered the remaining four taxa Pristionchus, Micoletzkya
and Diplogasteriana/Acrostichus. The posterior probability
values, however, were only significant for the Diplogasteriana/Acrostichus pair. Pristionchus appears to be most divergent, next to Micoletzkya. Acrostichus and Diplogasteriana
consistently group with high support values in all reconstructed trees. The early divergence of the genus Koerneria
from other diplogastrids was highly supported. The lack
of topological resolution and short branch lengths at
internal nodes observed in all tree reconstruction algorithms points to an inherent property of this (and probably similar) datasets, which is caused by rapid ancestral
radiations and incomplete assortment of ancestral polymorphisms.

Discussion
Phylogenetic species tree of the Diplogastridae
Here we present a first comprehensive molecular phylogeny of beetle-associated diplogastrid nematodes providing a framework for the investigation of nematode-beetle
interactions and the interplay of ecological factors and
nematode evolution. The Diplogastridae include more
than 300 species of free-living or beetle-associated nematodes, which are grouped in 28 genera [19,20]. They are a
monophyletic clade placed within the paraphyletic rhabditids [18]. The sister group to the diplogastrids is formed
by the eurhabditids, which encompass Caenorhabditis,
Oscheius and others [18].

For the purpose of assessing phylogenetic relationships,
we choose representative species of the diplogastrid genera for molecular analyses. Phylogenetic species trees can
be derived from single gene trees if speciation events are
well separated in time. In general, however, this premise

Phylogenic relationships of Diplogastridae based on concatenated SSU and ribosomal protein genes
Phylogenic relationships of Diplogastridae based on concatenated SSU and ribosomal protein genes. The phylogenetic trees of 17 diplogastrid taxa were reconstructed from 5,996 bp of concatenated ribosomal protein CDS and SSU
sequences. Coloured branches denote supported diplogastrid clades. Robustness of the tree topologies was evaluated by 1000
bootstrap replications. The support values are shown at the nodes. The trees were rooted by Rhabditoides inermis as outgroup.

using MrBayes 3.1.2 (Additional file 1) [29].

cannot be assumed and true species trees may differ from
gene trees [31,32]. Thus, to expand the dataset, multiple
genes are needed for a robust phylogenetic reconstruction.
Phylogenetic species trees from multi-gene data can be
inferred in two different ways. They can either be constructed from the consensus of separately generated gene
trees or from an alignment of concatenated multiple gene
sequences is used to infer the species tree. The latter was
shown to perform better in yielding more accurate trees in
a test situation [33]. Here, we applied both procedures,
but chose to focus on the concatenation approach since

the phylogenetic information content of the single gene
sequences was limited.
A molecular phylogeny of beetle-associated diplogastrid
nematodes
Although the topologies of the phylogenetic trees produced by the different algorithms were not always congruent, four fundamental features can be extracted (Figure 2).
Firstly, species of the same genus always clustered
together, as shown by the genera Pristionchus, Koerneria,
and Diplogasteroides, for which two geographically distinct

Page 5 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:212

species each were included in the analysis. The two divergent species of Koerneria displayed the highest intra-genus
distance, whereas Pristionchus and Diplogasteroides species
from Europe and North America or Japan, respectively,
grouped together more closely. This feature is consistent
with the morphological separation of the two subclades
within Koerneria, as already discussed by Fürst von Lieven
[23]. Secondly, terminal branches were exceedingly long
while branches separating internal nodes with low support values were very short or collapsed completely.
Although most beetle-associated diplogastrid genera were
represented in the analyses, increased taxon sampling
including non-beetle associated diplogastrids, might
resolve some of those internal nodes. Overall, however,
this indicates rapid initial diversification and speciation
events separated by short divergence times in relation to
the persistence of the extant taxa. Genealogies of individual genes may contribute to misleading species tree topologies if polymorphisms in ancestral populations of high
effective population sizes are incompletely sorted during
speciation events in close succession [32]. The long persistence of the extant genera resulted in accumulation of
multiple substitutions in terminal branches. Terminal
taxa, therefore, can be expected to be rich in homoplasic
characters due to parallel sequence evolution or evolutionary convergence. The resulting long-branch attraction
effects interfere with the clear resolution of internal nodes.
Thirdly, several monophyletic clades with high support
from bootstrapping or from posterior probabilities
became evident from the comparison of various trees. The
first clade encompassed Diplogasteroides with Pseudodiplogasteroides as its putative sister genus, Diplogastrellus, and Rhabditidoides. The second clade included
Mononchoides, Neodiplogaster and Tylopharynx. The third
group combined Acrostichus and Diplogasteriana. The
inclusion of Micoletzkya and Pristionchus in this group
occurs with posterior probabilities of ≥ 0.8 and thus
remains unresolved. The taxa Myctolaimus and Oigolaimella could not be linked firmly to any of the above
clades. Fourthly, the genus Koerneria, which was in close
relationship to Pristionchus in previous studies, assumes a
basal position to all diplogastrid nematodes in this molecular analysis [19,20]. This topology is also indicated in the
molecular phylogeny of Kiontke et al. [18].
Comparison of molecular and morphological phylogenies
There is a fairly good agreement between the phylogeny of
Diplogastridae as proposed by Sudhaus and Fürst von
Lieven based on apomorphic morphological characters
and the molecular phylogeny presented here [19]. This
example strongly supports the fact that morphological
and molecular phylogenies should under ideal conditions result in similar findings. If morphological characters are well chosen and molecular characters are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/212

informative and substantial, homoplasy should be
reduced, thus resulting in similar phylogenies.
The only major discrepancy in the case of the Diplogastridae is the genus diverging first from the stem species of
Diplogastridae (see above). While in the morphological
tree this position is taken by Pseudodiplogasteroides, in the
molecular tree it is occupied by Koerneria. As a consequence, the molecular analysis places Pseudodiplogasteroides as the sister taxon to Diplogasteroides. The same wellsupported clade also unexpectedly harbours the genus
Diplogastrellus, which appears to be closer to Acrostichus in
a yet unresolved relationship following Sudhaus and Fürst
von Lieven [19]. The latter, on the other hand, is the sister
taxon to Diplogasteriana in the molecular tree.
Although positioned distinctively on the molecular phylogenetic tree, Pristionchus and Koerneria share a number of
morphological characters, such as a dimorphism in the
buccal cavity, the shape and arrangement of denticles,
overall body shape, and a prominent ripping of the cuticle
[19]. These features could have evolved in two different
ways. First, the shared characters may have been present in
the stem species followed by subsequent loss in genera
other than Pristionchus and Koerneria. This scenario is,
however, unlikely since multiple independent character
losses were required. The second, more likely possibility
assumes parallel or convergent evolution. Given the long
terminal branches separating the genera, independent
convergent gain of advantageous characters is easily conceivable.
Nematode-beetle associations: Coevolution or host
switching?
Is there a correlation between the rapid ancestral diversification of the diplogastrid lineages and their subsequent
evolution with the phylogeny of their coleopteran hosts?
The beetles appeared around 285 million years ago (mya)
followed by radiations of suborders [34-36]. The minimum age of the Scarabaeoidea and the Chrysomeloidea,
which are major hosts for Diplogastridae, were both estimated to 150 mya, whereas their last common ancestor
lived more than 236 mya [36]. Dieterich et al. estimated
the divergence of the Pristionchus pacificus from the eurhabditid genus Caenorhabditis to a time range of 280430
mya [6]. The ancestral radiations of Diplogastridae thus
occurred in a time period that overlaps with the diversification of beetles into major lineages. It is therefore conceivable that the initial radiation of the Coleoptera had
influence on the diversification of diplogastrids by providing new ecological niches, to which the nematodes
were adapting. If these interactions persisted for a long
time, coevolution of the nematodes with the beetles
should have shaped the evolutionary pattern of the

diplogastrids and its traces should be detectable in phylogenetic tree topologies. Inspecting the monophyletic
diplogastrid clades, such as Mononchoides, Tylopharynx,
and Neodiplogaster for these features will provide clues to
resolve this issue. Mononchoides is associated with scarab
beetles, curculionids, and Silphidae, Tylopharynx is associated with scarabs, and Neodiplogaster with curculionid,
buprestid and cerambycid beetles. Likewise, in a second
monophyletic group, Diplogasteroides and Diplogastrellus
occur on curculionids and cerambycids, Pseudodiplogasteroides on cerambycids, and Rhabditidoides on Scarabaeidae.
Following the comprehensive beetle phylogeny provided
by Hunt et al. the Cucujiformia, which encompass cerambycid, and chrysomelid beetles, originated 236 mya, well
separated from Scarabaeoidea [36]. Thus, members of the
same monophyletic diplogastrid clade or even the same
genus are associated with beetles of ancient divergence,
refuting the possibility of a long-term coevolutionary relationship. Together, these data support host switching
rather than coevolution as mechanism to explain the
observed patterns of diplogastrid beetle associations.
A case of recent host switching of a European species to an
American host is given by Pristionchus uniformis [13,17].
Pristionchus dauer larvae are generally found on scarab
beetles but Pristionchus uniformis also infests at high frequencies the Colorado potato beetle, a chrysomelid beetle, both in Europe and in North America [12,13]. The
nematode populations on the two hosts species are genetically undistinguishable indicating recent and repeating
events of host changes. The evolution and population
genetics are currently under investigation (Isabella
d'Anna, W.E.M. and R.J.S., unpublished observations).
Phylogeny: A further mark for genome evolution
Sequencing the whole genome of an organism results in
data that can only be interpreted in the context of a robust
phylogenetic framework, including other related taxa. The
genome of P. pacificus has recently been sequenced and
the analysis of its genetic composition identified homologous nematode-specific genes, but also a remarkable
number of features not shared with C. elegans or other
available nematode genomes [6]. Firstly, the P. pacificus
genome contains 23,500 predicted protein-coding genes,
a substantial amount of which does not show sequence
similarities to other metazoan genes. Secondly, the P.
pacificus genome contains a massive expansion of genes
predicted to be involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes and ABC transporters. Thirdly, a conspicuous set of genes encoding
cellulases or glycosylhydrolases is apparent, which has no
counterpart in other nematodes but is most similar to corresponding genes in Dictyostelium or other microbes. The
acquisition of these and several other genes could only be
explained by horizontal gene transfer. With phylogenetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/212

information on the taxa involved, as presented here for
subclades of the Diplogastridae the analyses of horizontal
gene transfer events in diplogastrid genomie evolution
can be studied in greater detail in the future.

Conclusion
Molecular data from 14 diplogastrid beetle-associated
genera were collected and used to obtain some robust
phylogenetic relationships. The following conclusions
can be drawn. Firstly, whereas terminal branches of the
resulting phylogenetic tree are long, indicating long-term
accumulation of substitutions, internal branches, separating four robust clades are short. These are (1) Diplogasteroides,
Pseudodiplogasteroides,
Diplogastrellus,
and
Rhabditidoides, (2) Mononchoides, Neodiplogaster, and Tylopharynx, (3) Acrostichus and Diplogasteriana, and (4) both
Koerneria subclades. Internal nodes could not be resolved
with high support, indicating ancient rapid radiation and
incomplete gene lineage sorting. Secondly, although the
Diplogastridae-beetle association appears to be ancient,
no long-term coevolution is evident. Instead, there are
indications of frequent host-switching of diplogastrid
nematodes. Thirdly, the present phylogeny of the
Diplogastridae provides a framework for further investigations of diplogastrid-beetle associations and the ecological influences shaping their evolution. Fourthly, this study
is of important interest for a deeper search into the origins
of observed horizontal-gene transfer events in nematodes
and for the phylogenetic interpretation of diplogastrid
genome evolution.

Methods
Sources of diplogastrid nematodes
The origin of nematode strains or beetles with associated
nematodes is listed in Table 1.
Genus identification of diplogastrid specimens
Morphology
Sacrificed beetles were placed onto 6 cm NGM agar plates
[12]. Over a period of one to two weeks emerging nematodes were determined to family level by using a dissecting scope (Zeiss Stemi 2000) and classified to genus level
with a microscope (Zeiss Axioplan2) using keys from
Andràssy and Sudhaus and Fürst von Lieven [19,21].
Molecular identification of genera
The nuclear small subunit rRNA gene sequence (SSU) was
employed for molecular characterization of nematode
samples [17,37]. To this end, genomic DNA from single
nematodes was released using the NaOH lysis procedure
described by Floyd et al. [37] and as in Herrmann et al.
[12]. One microliter of this extract was used for subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers
SSU18A (5'-AAAGATTAAGCCATGCATG-3') and SSU26R
(5'-CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG-3') [2,37] as in Her-

rmann et al. to amplify a 1 kb fragment [12]. A 500 bp segment of the 5'-terminal end of the SSU was directly
sequenced using the primer SSU9R (5'-AGCTGGAATTACCGCGGCTG-3') and the Big Dye terminator sequencing
mix (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany).
Ribosomal protein genes in expressed sequence tag (EST)
libraries
EST library and data acquisition
EST libraries were prepared from cultures of diplogastrid
nematodes as described by Mayer et al. [17]. The selected
strains were Diplogasteroides magnus RS1983, Diplogastrellus gracilis SB306, Acrostichus sp. RS5083, and Rhabditoides
inermis SB328. Rhabditoides inermis was chosen as closest
non-diplogastrid outgroup according to Kiontke et al. and
in agreement with SSU-based phylogenetic trees (Figure
1) [18]. The dataset was combined with EST data previously obtained from Pristionchus species and Koerneria sp.
RS1982 [17]. Twelve abundantly expressed monoallelic
ribosomal protein genes were selected from this dataset
(Table 2). RT-PCR with gene-specific primers (Additional
file 2: Table S1) served to complete the ribosomal protein
gene dataset for these six taxa and to obtain the corresponding sequences from a second Diplogasteroides species
from Japan, a divergent Koerneria species (K. sudhausi),
and from eight additional diplogastrid genera encompassing those collected from beetles (Table 1) [4,12,17,2426]. Plasmid DNA from about 400 single EST clones each
was extracted using the QIAprep 96 Turbo BioRobot Kit
(Qiagen) and the inserts were sequenced from the 5' end
using the SL1-specific primer BJ234 (5'-GGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3').
EST analysis and gene-specific primer design
The proteins encoded by the SL1-transspliced genes in the
initial EST screen were identified by BLASTX searches of
WormBase and the non-redundant database at GenBank

[22,38]. Sequences of selected ribosomal protein genes
were aligned manually with the help of the Seqpup 0.6f
software for Macintosh [39]. Conserved sequence
stretches from this data set and from subsequently generated additional data were chosen to design gene-specific
generic RT-PCR primers (Additional file 2). The primers
were checked for secondary structures and compatibility
to the SL1-primer BJ234 and the oligo(dT)-containing
primer
RH5620
(5'-GAAGATCTAGAGCGGCCGCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3') with the help of the
OLIGO 4.0 software (MedProbe, Oslo, Norway).
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of
ribosomal protein genes
RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with the help of
the Sensiscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) and the primer RH5620. Complete transcripts
were synthesized by RT-PCR in two overlapping fragments
per gene as described in Mayer et al. [17]. Briefly, the SL1specific primer BJ234 was used in combination with genespecific antisense primers to obtain the 5' parts of the transcripts and the combination of RH5620 and the sense
primers to obtain the 3' parts. The PCR was performed
using the HotStar Taq Plus DNA polymerase kit (Qiagen)
including 1× Q solution in the reaction mix. PCR conditions were initial activation of the enzyme at 95°C for 5
min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30
sec, primer annealing at 50°C for 30 sec, and primer
extension at 72°C for 3 min. The reaction was completed
by incubation at 72°C for 10 min. PCR fragments were
electrophoresed through an 1.5% agarose gel, purified
using the Wizard SV gel purification kit (Promega) and
sequenced directly using the respective gene-specific PCR
primers. The new sequences described here have been
deposited to the GenBank database and can be retrieved

Phylogenetic analyses
Nuclear small subunit ribosomal rDNA
Sequences obtained from diplogastrid specimens were
aligned to diplogastrid SSU sequences retrieved from the
GenBank database by the ClustalX software [40] and manually improved with the help of the Seqpup 0.6f software
for Macintosh [39]. According to Kiontke et al. (2007)
Rhabditoides inermis was included as closest related outgroup [18]. The best-fit substitution model and the
parameter settings were determined by the Modeltest 3.7
software using the Akaike information criterion [27,41].
The parameters for the selected model (GTR+I+G) were as
follows: Estimated base frequencies: A = 0.2751, C =
0.2094, G = 0.2433, T = 0.2722; substitution rates A-C =
0.9722, A-G = 1.9547, A-T = 2.1277, C-G = 0.5838, C-T =
3.7945, G-T = 1.0000; proportion of invariable sites I =
0.2117; gamma distribution shape parameter α = 0.4911.

Phylogenetic relationships between the diplogastrid taxa
were assessed based on 471 bp of the SSU sequences with
the help of the PAUP*4.0b10 software using maximum
parsimony (MP, heuristic search, gaps as 5th state), neighbour-joining (NJ, BioNJ algorithm with maximum likelihood distances) methods, and heuristic search using
maximum likelihood (ML) as optimality criterion
[28,42]. Bootstrap support values were obtained by 1000
replications using the neighbour-joining method. Additionally, the Phylogeny.fr server at http://www.phylog
eny.fr/ was employed [23]. From the alignment, ambiguous regions (i.e. containing gaps and/or poorly aligned)
were removed with Gblocks (v0.91b) using the following
parameters:
-minimum length of a block after gap cleaning: 10
-positions with a gap in less than 50% of the sequences
were selected in the final alignment if they were within an
appropriate block
-all segments with contiguous nonconserved positions
bigger than 8 were rejected
-minimum number of sequences for a flank position:
85%. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the
maximum likelihood method implemented in the PhyML
program (v3.0 aLRT) [43]. The GTR substitution model
was selected assuming an estimated proportion of invariant sites (of 0.232) and 4 gamma-distributed rate categories to account for rate heterogeneity across sites. The
gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from the
data (gamma = 0.440). Reliability for internal branch was
assessed using the aLRT test (SH-Like).
Ribosomal protein genes
Ribosomal protein coding cDNA sequences from 17
diplogastrid nematodes and Rhabditoides inermis were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/212

aligned by the ClustalX software or aligned manually with
the help of the Seqpup 0.6f software for Macintosh
[39,40]. Coding segments were deduced by comparison to
the orthologues in C. elegans, C. briggsae and P. pacificus.
Genes were selected according to presence of clear orthologues in the C. elegans genome, being distributed to the
different chromosomes, their ease of amplification by RTPCR with the SL1 primer and the presence of conserved
sites for generic primer design. Genes that were either
duplicated in Caenorhabditis or appeared to be present in
more than one copy in the diplogastrid sample were omitted from the analysis. Reliably obtained coding sequences
(depending on the gene, from codons 1 to 12 through the
termination codon) were concatenated and subjected to
analysis by Modeltest 3.7 to determine the best-fit nucleotide substitution model for maximum likelihood analysis (ML) using the Akaike information criterion [27,41].
For parameter determination only diplogastrid sequences
were used. The model settings were equivalent to the
GTR+I+G model with 6 substitution types (A-C = 0.9147,
A-G = 1.3858, A-T = 1.2732, C-G = 1.0849, C-T = 4.5242,
G-T = 1.0000), assumed nucleotide frequencies of A =
0.245038, C = 0.329976, G = 0.264464, T = 0.160522,
assumed proportion of invariable sites I = 0.363795, rates
at variable sites following the gamma distribution with
shape parameter α = 1.026951.
A consensus tree of 13 single gene trees was constructed
using PAUP*4.0b10 [28]. The dataset encompassing 17
diplogastrids and Rhabditoides inermis as outgroup was
used to infer single gene trees by heuristic searches for
each of the 12 ribosomal protein genes and for the SSU
sequences. Heuristic searches with NJ starting trees were
conducted under the maximum likelihood optimality criterion.
Phylogenetic trees of concatenated sequences were constructed by four algorithms: Neighbour joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood analysis
(ML), and Bayesian inference (BI). NJ trees using the
BIONJ method [42,44], MP trees and ML trees were reconstructed by PAUP*4.0b10 [28]. Alignment gaps were
eliminated from the analysis. The branch-swapping algorithm was set to tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR). Support for the tree topology was obtained by 1000 bootstrap
replications using the NJ or MP algorithms [45]. Phylogenetic trees by Bayesian inference were obtained using two
softwares, MrBayes 3.1.2 software for Macintosh [29] and
BEST [30]. For the MrBayes 3.1.2 software the evolutionary model was set to GTR+I+G. The analysis was run for
2,100,000 generations with a burnin of 500,000 generations and a sampling frequency of 1 in 100 generations. In
order to estimate the best species tree that fulfils the constraint that all divergences in gene trees have to occur prior
to species divergences, the modification of MrBayes as
given by the Bayesian Estimation of Species Trees (BEST)
