Characterization and tissue-specific expression
patterns of the Plasmodium chabaudi cir
multigene family
Petra Ebbinghaus and Jürgen Krücken*

Abstract
Background: Variant antigens expressed on the surface of parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) are important
virulence factors of malaria parasites. Whereas Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane proteins 1 (PfEMP1)
are responsible for sequestration of mature parasites, little is known about putative ligands mediating
cytoadherence to host receptors in other Plasmodium species. Candidates include members of the pir superfamily
found in the human parasite Plasmodium vivax (vir), in the simian pathogen Plasmodium knowlesi (kir) and in the
rodent malarias Plasmodium yoelii (yir), Plasmodium berghei (bir) and Plasmodium chabaudi (cir). The aim of this
study was to reveal a potential involvement of cir genes in P. chabaudi sequestration.
Methods: Subfamilies of cir genes were identified by bioinformatic analyses of annotated sequence data in the
Plasmodium Genome Database. In order to examine tissue-specific differences in the expression of cir mRNAs, RTPCR with subfamily-specific primers was used. In total, 432 cDNA clones derived from six different tissues were
sequenced to characterize the transcribed cir gene repertoire. To confirm differences in transcription profiles of cir
genes, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses were performed to compare different host tissues
and to identify changes during the course of P. chabaudi infections in immunocompetent mice.
Results: The phylogenetic analysis of annotated P. chabaudi putative CIR proteins identified two major subfamilies.
Comparison of transcribed cir genes from six different tissues revealed significant differences in the frequency
clones belonging to individual cir gene subgroups were obtained from different tissues. Further hints of difference
in the transcription of cir genes in individual tissues were obtained by RFLP. Whereas only minimal changes in the
transcription pattern of cir genes could be detected during the developmental cycle of the parasites, switching to
expression of other cir genes during the course of an infection was observed around or after peak parasitemia.
Conclusions: The tissue-specific expression of cir mRNAs found in this study indicates correlation between
expression of CIR antigens and distribution of parasites in inner organs. Together with comparable results for other
members of the pir superfamily this suggests a role of cir and other pir genes in antigenic variation and
sequestration of malaria parasites.

Background
Antigenic variation is a major characteristic of malaria
parasites of the genus Plasmodium leading to severe and
chronic infections in a variety of vertebrates. Malaria
parasites have developed strategies to evade host
immune responses by expressing a large and diverse
repertoire of variant proteins on the surface of

parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) [1-4]. By rapidly
switching between these antigens, the parasites avoid
antibody-mediated immunity of the host thus enabling
the parasites to proliferate in the host without being
completely eliminated by the adaptive immune response.
Furthermore, these surface antigens were proposed to be
involved in adherence to endothelial cells causing
sequestration of late trophozoites and schizonts in postcapillary venules in specific inner organs, which considerably contributes to severe pathology in the host [5-8].

In the most virulent human pathogen Plasmodium falciparum, the PfEMP1 protein family encoded by widely
studied var genes was shown to be expressed at the surface of pRBC mediating the parasite binding to endothelial cells lining small blood vessels [9,10]. Several in
vitro assays with P. falciparum revealed a tight regulation of the expression of the individual variant antigens
by silencing, activation and mutually exclusive expression, thus only one variant protein is expressed in parasites at any given time [10-13]. By switching the
expression to another variant, antigenic properties of
the surface of pRBCs changes and the parasites prevent
their complete clearance [10,14]. Typical waves of parasitaemia in persistent P. falciparum infections reflect the
repeated switching between different members of the
diverse repertoire of variant antigens [10].
Further variant surface antigens encoded by multigene
families were found in several other Plasmodium species
infecting humans, monkeys and rodents [4,15-17]. However, homologues of the var genes are not present in
Plasmodium vivax or other malaria species [18], with
exception of several var-like sequences from the chimpanzee parasite Plasmodium reichenowi [19], a close
relative of P. falciparum.
The largest multigene family in Plasmodium genomes
was described to be formed by the Plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) genes [20,21]. The superfamily of pir
genes constitutes the major variant surface antigen
family in most Plasmodium species. They were found in
the human pathogen P. vivax (vir) [22], in the simian
parasite Plasmodium knowlesi (kir) [18] and in the
rodent malaria species Plasmodium yoelii (yir), Plasmodium berghei (bir) and Plasmodium chabaudi (cir)
[15,17,23]. Transcriptional changes of yir genes modulated by host immunity were reported in immunocompetent mice infected with P. yoelii [24]. In contrast to
the exclusive expression of individual var genes and
consecutive activation of different genes in P. falciparum, transcriptional profiling analyses in P. yoelii
showed a simultaneous expression of a broad range of
different yir genes within different intra-erythrocytic
developmental parasite stages [25]. In a single parasite,
however, only one to three yir transcripts were detectable. Cunningham and colleagues [25] concluded that
antigenic variation in P. yoelii probably involves exposure of the immune system to many different YIR antigens and transcriptional switching takes place without
any epigenetic memory. For the variant VIR proteins of
the most widely distributed human malaria pathogen P.
vivax, a similar differential expression in natural infections could also be detected [26] and for the cir genes
of the rodent malaria species P. chabaudi antigenic
switching in laboratory mice has already been described
[15].

Although the PIR proteins were localised close to the
surface of pRBCs infected with P. vivax, P. yoelii, P. berghei, and P. chabaudi [20,22,24,27], less is known about
the role of PIR proteins in host/parasite interactions.
For instance, a supposed correlation of antigenic variation of the PIRs with sequestration in inner organs has
not yet been analysed. In P. falciparum, adherence of
pRBCs to different host receptor such as CD36, ICAM1 or chondroitin-sulfate A (CSA) is mediated by the
major variant protein PfEMP1 [6,8,28], but no homologues to these proteins were detected in most other
malaria pathogens. Therefore, it is conceivable that the
PIR proteins, which are also expressed on the surface
membrane of pRBCs, are as well involved in adherence
to endothelial cells and sequestration of pRBCs in the
microvasculature of inner organs.
The complex phenomenon of sequestration is hitherto
not completely understood as indicated by the common
assumption that sequestration of mature pRBCs in the
microvasculature of the host tissues, as found in P. falciparum infections, does not occur for P. vivax. Thus, it
has been assumed that the human parasite P. vivax
must have developed different strategies e.g. adherence
to barrier cells in the spleen to avoid spleen clearance
[29]. Recently, however, in vitro assays provided new
evidence for a cytoadherence of P. vivax pRBCs to
endothelial cells and placental cryosections suggesting a
cytoadherence comparable to that of P. falciparum
pRBCs in vivo [30]. Direct or indirect evidences for an
involvement of VIR antigens in binding to host receptors are currently still missing. In the most studied
rodent model P. berghei, real-time in vivo imaging of
transgenic parasites revealed CD36-mediated sequestration of schizonts in adipose tissues and lung as well as
an accumulation of schizonts in the spleen [31]. Accumulation of other blood stages was also observed in different tissues including the brain and placenta of
pregnant mice [32-34]. Nevertheless, identification of
parasite ligands involved in binding to CD36 or other
host receptors are still missing. In vitro adherence of P.
chabaudi infected erythrocytes to purified human CD36
has been observed [35]. Moreover, sequestration to
microvascular endothelial cells was reported to appear
in an organ specific manner in P. chabaudi infections,
predominantly in liver, but also in brain and spleen thus
resembling at least partially the sequestration pattern in
P. falciparum infections.
In this study, the relationship between antigenic variation of the cir multigene family and accumulation of
parasites localization in different host tissues was analysed at the molecular level. Bioinformatic characterization of the cir genes was used to identify different
subfamilies within the multigene family. First indications
for a tissue-specific expression of cir genes were

obtained by amplification of a representative sample of
transcribed cir genes from different host tissues. Transcriptional profiling analyses of cir genes in different
host tissues using RFLP analysis of RT-PCR products
provided further evidence of a tissue-specific expression
of cir genes in P. chabaudi infections. These results provide first indications for a possible correlation of antigenic variation of the cir multigene family and
sequestration in host tissues in P. chabaudi infections.

Methods
Bioinformatics

All annotated sequence data of putative cir genes in the
Plasmodium Genome Database Resource version 8.0
[36] (PlasmoDB; plasmodb.org) were compiled (Additional file 1). For confirmation of correct annotation, a
CD-BLAST [37-39] was performed to identify and locate
the conserved domain of the CIR-BIR-YIR superfamily
[22,23] (Pfam protein families database accession number [PF06022]). Sequences with a partial CIR-BIR-YIR
conserved domain were excluded from all subsequent
analyses.
For phylogenetic reconstruction, putative CIR proteins
were aligned using ClustalW2 [40] and a phylogenetic
tree was calculated with PhyML 3.0 [41] using maximum likelihood estimation and the JTT model [42] for
amino acid substitution. The gamma shape parameter
and the proportion of invariable sites were estimated
and the number of substitution rate categories was set
to four. The implemented BIONJ algorithm was used to
build the starting tree. Resulting trees (Newick format)
were visualised and processed with MEGA4 [43,44].
For validation of structural protein motifs such as
transmembrane domains, signal peptides and PEXEL
motifs, analyses of the protein sequences were examined
with Protscale [45], TMHMM 2.0 [46,47] and SignalP
[48]. Results were compared with annotations extracted
from PlasmoDB.
Mice

All experiments were performed with 5-8 weeks-old
outbred female NMRI mice (Crl:NMRI(Han)) provided
by Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The mice were
kept in cages with a maximum of five animals per cage
and received food and water ad libitum. The experiments were planed according to all relevant guidelines
for animal protection and approved by German authorities responsible for animal protection.
Infection of mice

A non-clonal line of P. chabaudi very similar but not
identical to P. chabaudi AS was used [49-51]. Blood
stages of P. chabaudi were weekly passaged in female
NMRI mice by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of a

Page 3 of 19

droplet of tail vein blood diluted in PBS. Parasitaemia
was evaluated in Giemsa-stained blood smears and total
erythrocytes number was counted in a Neubauer
chamber.
For the experiments, blood of an infected NMRI
mouse was collected by cardiac puncture under anesthesia. For each transcriptional profiling experiment, six
mice were infected i.p. with approximately 100 parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs). Organs and blood were
collected at about 30% parasitaemia, i.e. just before peak
parasitaemia.
For transcriptional profiling during the course of an
infection, tail vein blood of mice infected i.p. with 100
pRBCs was passaged i.p. into naïve female NMRI mice
at days 7 (early infection), 14 (around peak parasitaemia), 21 (7 days after peak parasitaemia) and 35 (21
days after peak parasitaemia). Expression of cir genes
was analysed when parasitaemia reached about 30%.
RNA and DNA extraction

Blood samples of P. chabaudi infected mice were collected by cardiac puncture, rapidly frozen and stored at
-80°C. Small pieces of liver, spleen, kidneys, lung and
brain were transferred into RNA Later (Sigma Aldrich)
and kept at -80°C for long-term storage. Total RNA was
extracted using NucleoSpin ® RNA II kit (MachereyNagel) according to the manufactures instructions.
Genomic DNA extraction was performed with the
NucleoSpin® Blood kit (Macherey-Nagel).
Verification of complete cir gene structures

To verify the complete gene structure of selected cir
genes, RT-PCR and genomic PCR were performed in
parallel. The primer pairs used for amplification and
detailed information about PCR conditions can be found
in Additional file 2.
Cloning of RT-PCR products and sequencing

Residual contaminating genomic DNA in total RNA
preparations was digested with DNase I (Fermentas).
First strand cDNA was synthesised using 1 μg RNA and
the RevertAid™ Premium Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas) with Oligo dT 18 primers including reactions
without reverse transcriptase as negative controls for
amplification.
For transcription analysis, specific primers spanning
the second exon encoding an essential part of the CIRBIR-YIR domain (> 98% of its length) were designed for
both major cir gene subfamilies. The primer pairs f1up
(5’-AATACGCTATTTTATGGTTTAGTTATAAA-3’)/
f1lo (5’-TGAAATTCCTAAAATAATGGGTATTATTAAAA-3’) and f2up (5’-TATGCTATTTTATGGTTAAGTTATATGCTA-3’)/f2lo (5’-ATGAATACTTA
TAAGCAATTCCCAAGAAAA-3’) were targeted to

highly conserved sequence regions for amplification of a
broad range of cir genes.
Following cDNA synthesis, amplification with the
AccuPrime™ DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was performed using subfamily-specific primers for cir subfamily 1 and 2. After an initial denaturation for 30 s at 94°
C, 40 cycles of 10 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, 30 s at 72°C
followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. RTPCR products were then isolated from a 0.8% agarose
gel and precipitated in the presence of glycogen.
In order to sample a first repertoire of transcribed P.
chabaudi cir genes, RT-PCR products of each tissue
(blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lung and brain) were gelpurified and cloned into the pCR™4-TOPO® TA vector
(Invitrogen). Thirty-six clones for each tissue and subfamily were sequenced (GATC, Constance, Germany)
resulting in sequences for 216 independent cDNA
clones for cir subfamily 1 and 2.
Transcriptional profiling of RT-PCR products by RFLP

For transcriptional profiling, DNase digestion of RNA
and cDNA synthesis was performed as described before
and RT-PCR products were amplified with the Phusion®
Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Fermentas)
using subfamily-specific primers for cir subfamily 1 and
2. After an initial denaturation for 30 s at 98°C, 50
cycles of 10 s at 98°C, 30 s at 55°C, 30 s at 72°C were
performed followed by a final extension for 10 min at
72°C.
Gel-purified RT-PCR products (150 ng) were digested
with AluI or XapI (Fermentas) in 5 μl for 3 h at 37°C
followed by enzyme inactivation for 20 min at 65°C.
The restricted fragments (30 ng) were analysed with the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the DNA 1000 LabChip®
kit (Agilent) following the manufactures instructions. In
order to ensure reproducibility of the RFLP profiles,
both RT-PCR and RFPL were usually repeated at least
twice resulting in 4 replicates.

Pfam database). This conserved sequence motif were
found in several CIR, BIR and YIR proteins of the Plasmodium species P. chabaudi, P. berghei and P. yoelii
(Figure 1) [22,23]. The presence of a complete conserved domain of the CIR-BIR-YIR superfamily could
only be confirmed for 186 of them. For the remaining
13 putative CIR proteins, no (four sequences) or only a
partial CIR-BIR-YIR conserved domain (seven
sequences) could be identified. As there was no evidence
for the missing regions in the adjacent genomic
sequences, these database entries most like represent cir
pseudogene fragments. These sequences were excluded
from all subsequent analyses. Furthermore, three
sequences
(PCHAS_040020;
PCHAS_000130;
PCHAS_000400) showed two hits for the CIR-BIR-YIR
conserved domain. In these cases the first hit only
represented a partial domain and these partial domains
were therefore also excluded. The final 186 putative CIR
proteins containing a complete conserved CIR-BIR-YIR
domain were used for all following analyses and are
listed in Additional File 1. Due to the fact that the P.
chabaudi genome is assembled already to 14 (more or
less) complete chromosomes whereas the P. yoelii genomic sequence is still scattered on 5.617 unassembled
contigs, it is highly probable that vast majority of the cir
genes in the genome have been identified and annotated
in the current PlasmoDB release (8.0) and that the number of cir genes is indeed much smaller than the number of yir genes (about 838 genes) [52].

domain of a consensus sequence of 279 amino acids which is
encoded by the first and second exon of the conserved three exon
structure of these pir genes [22,23]. The COOH-terminal
transmembrane domain (TM), shown as green box. is still part of
the CIR-BIR-YIR domain. Exons are indicated by blue boxes.

The phylogenetic maximum likelihood analysis of all
186 annotated CIR domains including a selected subset
of the related YIR proteins in P. yoelii using representatives of all different subgroups defined previously in the
yir family [52] (Figure 2) identified four distinct
branches. Three large branches of CIR proteins were
indicated with likelihood ratios of more than 95% as statistical support values at the nodes and one small
branch with 92% support. Two of these branches were
designated here as subfamily 1 and 2 containing CIR
amino acid sequences that show a relatively low variability within the subfamilies and are very similar to well

known YIR and BIR proteins in terms of size and overall
structure. The other two branches with more divergent
CIR proteins were not designated as a specific subfamily
due to their high heterogeneity. In contrast to subfamily
1 and 2, these unassigned branches include many very
long CIRs. In most cases these proteins exhibit an additional highly variable insertion within the CIR-BIR-YIR
domain. Such divergent family members have already
been described in previous studies of the PIRs superfamily [20]. Interestingly, the analysis also reveals important
information about the relationship between CIR and
YIR proteins. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the

putative CIR proteins and 14 different putative conserved domains of YIRs representing different YIR subfamily proteins were aligned using
ClustalW2 [40] and a maximum likelihood tree was calculated using PhyML [41]. The cir subfamilies, indicated by the unrooted phylogenetic tree,
are highlighted by different colours. Subfamily 1 (purple) and subfamily 2 (cyan) consist of CIR proteins very similar to well known YIR and BIR
proteins of the PIR superfamily [20]. The remaining CIR proteins were more divergent, often due to highly variable insertions within the CIR-BIRYIR conserved domain. These sequences were finally not assigned to any subfamily. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the YIR proteins cluster
only with subfamily 2 and neither with subfamily 1 nor the large CIR proteins. The putative YIR domains are indicated by blue circles. The scale
bar represents 0.5 substitutions per amino acid position. Black hexagons mark major branches with more than 95% support, the grey hexagon
labels the minor branch with 92% support. See in Additional file 3 for identification of the individual proteins in each branch.

subset of YIR proteins shares similarities only with the
predicted subfamily 2 but neither with subfamily 1 nor
the unassigned heterogeneous CIR sequences.
For identification of the individual proteins in each
branch, the phylogenetic tree of CIR and YIR proteins is
given in Newick format in Additional file 3.
Localization motifs found in CIR proteins

For protein structural analyses, the 186 putative CIR
proteins were examined in regard to subcellular localization characteristics, such as putative signal peptides,
transmembrane domains, and the PEXEL motif (Plasmodium export element) [53,54]. Results were then compared to annotations in PlasmoDB. Detailed information
on protein motifs identified in all putative CIR proteins
can be obtained from Additional file 1. In only one of
the 186 sequences (PCHAS_114740) a signal peptide
had been annotated, however, the re-analysis with SignalP revealed only a 1.6% probability for the presence of
a signal peptide in this particular predicted CIR protein
with a maximum cleavage site probability of 1.2%
between amino acid position 26 and 27. Moreover, a
cDNA sequence encoding a corresponding CIR protein
with signal peptide could not be amplified by RT-PCR
using primers derived from PCHAS_114740 in the nonclonal P. chabaudi line used throughout this study.
Altogether, this indicates that the CIR proteins lack a
signal peptide and presumably use alternative pathways
for transport out of the parasite cell across the parasitophorous vacuole to the host cell membrane.
For the vast majority of putative CIR proteins (147
sequences) the presence of one transmembrane domain
had been annotated in PlasmoDB. Hydrophobicity plot
analyses according to Kyte and Doolittle were performed
using Protscale [45] confirming a hydrophobic stretch
close to the COOH-terminus of these CIRs. A prediction of transmembrane topology using TMHMM 2.0
[47] indicated a transmembrane helix of approximately
23 amino acid residues immediately upstream of the
COOH-terminus of the CIR-BIR-YIR conserved domain
with a probability of more than 99%. The largest part of
the NH2-terminus of CIR proteins was predicted to be
located outside and only less than 30 amino acids inside
the cytoplasm. The corresponding hydrophobicity plots
as well as the predicted transmembrane topology for
representative CIR proteins of subfamily 1 and 2 are
shown in Figure 3A and 3B. For a notably lower proportion of CIR proteins (37 sequences) two transmembrane
helices and for one CIR sequence (PCHAS_011490)
even three transmembrane helices had been annotated.
The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all these protein
sequences were unassigned CIRs and did not belong to
subfamily 1 or 2. The hydrophobicity analyses indicated
an additional second hydrophobic stretch behind the

Page 6 of 19

CIR-BIR-YIR conserved domain immediately at the
COOH-terminus in these CIRs. The predicted transmembrane topology by TMHMM also suggested the
presence of two transmembrane helices, both spanning
the membrane with 23 amino acids. In this case not
only the large NH2-terminal CIR domain but also a segment of less than 10 amino acids at the COOH-terminus were predicted to be outside (Figure 3C). For the
putative sequence PCHAS_011490 with three predicted
transmembrane domains, two additional helices were
found behind the CIR-BIR-YIR conserved domain by
Protscale. The schematic transmembrane topology for
selected CIR proteins is given in Figure 3D and 3E.
Finally, the putative CIR proteins were scanned for the
conserved five-residue PEXEL motif Rx[L/I]x[E/Q/D]
with the Protein Motif Pattern search tool in PlasmoDB.
This short hydrophobic peptide has been proposed to
be localised 16-24 amino acids downstream of the NH2terminus and to mediate the export of proteins across
the parasitophorous vacuole to the erythrocyte cytoplasm [53,54]. Seventeen sequences of the putative CIR
proteins were identified to have the specific PEXEL
motif but none of these sequences exhibited the PEXEL
motif at its canonical position. In the protein sequence
PCHAS_114700 the motif is located at amino acid position 4-8 and in four sequences between position 30-70.
In another 10 small CIR proteins and in two large CIR
proteins, the PEXEL motif is found between the amino
acids 90-300 or 640-660, much closer to the COOHthan to the NH2-terminus. Hence, all annotated putative
CIR proteins only possess an Rx[L/I]x[E/Q/D] stretch in
their sequence but lack a functioning PEXEL motif.
Verification of complete gene structures

In several studies, a common three-exon gene structure
was postulated for genes of the pir superfamily in rodent
malaria parasites [15,23,24]. For verification of the complete gene structure of selected cir genes of subfamily 1
and 2, further bioinformatic analyses and experimental
tests such as parallel RT- and genomic PCR were performed. The results show that indeed the cir genes consists of three exons like the related yir genes of P. yoelii
[25,52]. The coding region of cir cDNAs is unevenly distributed between these exons with about 15 bp of the
open reading frame in the first, 800-840 bp (highly polymorphic but containing highly conserved motifs) in the
second, and 80-90 bp in the third exon. The two introns
of 100-150 bp are found in conserved positions (Figure
4). Moreover, evidence for the occurrence of minor
splice variants of cir genes was detected by comparison
of RT-PCR and genomic PCR products. Transcripts of
cir genes were amplified where alternative splicing of
the first exon was detected leading to an NH2-terminally
truncated putative protein. In this case a ‘cryptic’ 5’

Figure 3 Transmembrane topology of some selected CIR proteins. To examine the predicted transmembrane topology of selected CIR
Proteins two different analyses tools were used. With the Protscale analysis, hydrophobicity plots were created according Kyte & Doolite [45].
With the TMHMMM 2.0 server [47], probabilities of predicted transmembrane topologies were calculated. For three different CIR proteins (A-C)
the results of the Protscale and TMHMM 2.0 were here compiled in one graph. On the x-axis the amino acid positions are given whereas on the
left y-axis the hydrophobicity scores and on the right y-axes the probabilities for extracellular, intracellular and transmembrane localization are
shown, respectively. The CIR proteins PCHAS_060060 of subfamily 1 (A) and PCHAS_000320 of subfamily 2 (B) were analysed as well as one of
the unassigned CIR protein (PCHAS_010040) (C). For the first two proteins, only one transmembrane helix was predicted with more than 99%
probability immediately close to the COOH-terminus of the CIR-BIR-YIR conserved domain, whereas the long NH2-termininal part was assumed
to be located outside. For the longer unassigned CIR protein, an additional second helix was located behind the CIR-BIR-YIR conserved domain
close to the COOH-terminus in this CIR. The large NH2-terminus as well as less than 10 amino acids of the COOH-terminus were predicted to be
outside. The individual curves were highlighted by different colours (see graphic legend). Additionally, schematic presentations of the
transmembrane topologies of subfamily 1 and 2 CIR proteins are schematically shown in (D) while topology of a CIR protein with two predicted
transmembrane helices is given in (E).

was used whereas the 3’ splice-site was identical in both
transcripts (Additional file 4). Whether this splice variant encodes a functionally important CIR protein variant or represents only a mis-spliced product can not
finally be decided from the available data. Sequences of
genomic DNA and full-length cDNA sequences have
been deposited in GenBank with accession numbers
[GenBank:JF904729 - JF904735] (Additional file 2).

product sizes for subfamily 1 and subfamily 2 were
about 600 bp (Figure 4B). In most PCRs, however, an
additional smaller but very faint RT-PCR product
(approx. 300 bp) appeared. Sequencing analyses indicated that this product is a notably smaller cir transcript
with a deletion of about 250 bp within the second exon.
This cDNA most likely also represents an alternatively
spliced cir variant, in particular since this cDNA [GenBank:JF969288] has an uninterrupted open reading
frame.

RT-PCR of cir genes with subfamily-specific primers

For the subsequent transcriptional profiling analyses (see
below), subfamily-specific primers for cir subfamily 1
and subfamily 2 were designed spanning the second
exon, the essential part of the CIR-BIR-YIR conserved
domain. The primer pairs were located at highly conserved sequence regions for amplification of a broad
range of cir cDNAs (Figure 4A). The expected RT-PCR

gene structure and the location of the subfamily-specific primer
pairs for cir subfamily 1 and 2. The f1up/f1lo (subfamily 1) and f2/

genes consist of 3 exons (blue rectangles) with about 15 bp, 800840 bp (highly polymorphic with highly conserved motifs), and 8090 bp coding sequence, respectively, and two introns (100-150 bp)
in conserved positions. (B) RT-PCR products of cir subfamily 1 (f1)
and 2 (f2). As an example for all RT-PCR products used in the
following RFLP, the RT-PCR products obtained from blood of a
female NMRI mouse infected with 100 pRBCs (parasitaemia about
30%) are shown. Expected product sizes were about 600 bp. An
additional smaller but much weaker RT-PCR product (approx. 300
bp) appeared in most of the amplifications which was revealed by
sequencing as a further putative cir gene splice variant. These
smaller cir products were excluded from all following RFLPs and
only the expected RT-PCR products of about 600 bp were purified
and digested. For size determination a 100 bp ladder was used.

Cloning of cir cDNAs from individual tissues

To examine whether the expression of certain cir antigen mRNAs correlates with the localization of the parasites in particular internal organs, a first repertoire of
transcribed cir genes was amplified from parasites using
RT-PCR and subfamily-specific primers for subfamilies
1 and 2. For this purpose, a single female NMRI mouse
was i.p. infected with 100 pRBCs and, at a parasitaemia
of 30%, blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lung and brain were
collected for RNA isolation. RT-PCR products of about
600 bp from each tissue were excised from agarose gels
and directly cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector. For
each tissue, clones were obtained from at least three
independent RT-PCR reactions. Thirty-six clones for
each tissue and subfamily were sequenced resulting in
216 cir sequences for each cir subfamily. Information
about individual sequences with GenBank ® accession
numbers can be found in Additional file 5. A broad
range of different sequences from both subfamilies was
amplified as shown by phylogenetic maximum likelihood
analysis of the deduced protein sequences in comparison
with the 186 putative conserved domains obtained from
PlasmoDB (Additional file 6) indicating that the method
is able to amplify a representative repertoire of both
subfamilies. The facts that (i) the length of the amplified
fragments differs only minimally (mean length and SD is
561 bp ± 2.5% for subfamily 1 and 523.7 bp ± 4.4% for
subfamily 2) and (ii) the percent identity is very high
(mean percent identity and SD is 80.8% ± 8.5% for subfamily 1 and 76.7% ± 10.9% for subfamily 2) a strong
bias introduced by unequal amplification efficacies is at
least unlikely.
The phylogenetic analyses of the proteins deduced
from subfamily 1 cir cDNA sequences identified nine
different sequence subgroups within the repertoire of
expressed subfamily 1 cir genes. Branch lengths and
likelihood ratios for nodes with at least 90% support
indicated that the transcribed cir sequences within these
subgroups are very similar or even identical (Figure 5).
See in Additional file 7 for the Newick format of the
phylogenetic tree of cir subfamily 1.
Statistical analyses using a Z-test were done to identify
significant differences in the frequency of different

Figure 5 Phylogenetic tree representing frequency of tissues within subgroups of the cir subfamily 1. Deduced protein sequences from
216 amplified cir cDNAs of subfamily 1 amplified from six different host tissues of a single female NMRI mouse infected with 100 pRBCs
(parasitaemia about 30%) were aligned using ClustalW2 [40] and a maximum likelihood tree was calculated using PhyML [41]. RT-PCR products
for each tissue (blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lung and brain) were cloned and 36 clones from each tissue were sequenced. Statistical support is
indicated as likelihood ratios only for those nodes with at least 90% support. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per amino acid position.
The origins of sequences (host tissues) are indicated by different colours as shown in the figure graphic legend. The cir subfamily 1 repertoire
expressed here can be divided in 9 subgroups. Five of these subgroups (subgroup 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8) showed significant differences in
frequency of tissues. The p-values were calculated by Z-test; **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05; +p < 0.07). Small (rarely occurring) subgroups of cir cDNAs
were excluded from the statistical analysis. For identification of the individual sequences in each branch see Additional file 7.

tissues represented within those individual subfamilies
that are sufficiently represented within the total population. The method does not allow to detect expression
differences for minor cir transcripts. Results are also
indicated in Figure 5. Most remarkably, the cir cDNA
belonging to subgroup 1.1 could be frequently recovered
from liver (24.2% of all subgroup 1.1 clones), lung,
(24.2%) blood (21.4%), spleen (17.1%) and kidney
(12.9%) but not from brain (0%). The absence of this cir
cDNA from our brain samples is statistically significant
when compared to all other tissues (p < 0.01). In contrast, the cir cDNA sequences of subgroup 1.4 were not
found in blood cDNA but significantly more often present in brain (34.6%; p < 0.01) and spleen (23.1%; p <
0.05) samples. Furthermore, a significant difference
could be detected between brain and lung (7.7%) in subgroup 1.4 (p < 0.05). The cir cDNAs in subgroup 1.5
were absent from liver samples (0%) but a higher number (60%) of these clones came from brain samples than
from all other tissues investigated (10% for each tissue).
While the differences between brain and liver were statistically significant (p < 0.05), differences between brain
and the other tissues (10%) did just not reach significance (p < 0.07). The cDNA sequences of subgroup 1.6
were absent from spleen, kidney and brain samples but
were found in blood (45.5%), liver (27.3%) and lung
(27.3%). The frequency of clones obtained from blood
within the cir subgroup 1.6 were significantly higher
when compared to spleen, kidney and brain (p < 0.01).
Finally, for subgroup 1.8 no cir cDNAs could be
detected in liver and kidney. In contrast, this subgroup
was obtained with a high frequency of 43.8% from the
spleen and with intermediate frequencies of 12.5% from
blood, 18.8% from lung and 25.0% from brain. However,
only the differences between the frequencies for spleen,
liver and kidney were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
An equivalent analysis was done for the cir subfamily
2 (Figure 6). However, only minor differences in tissue
distribution of cir cDNAs could be found within the 7
subgroups identified in the expressed set of subfamily 2
cir genes. Significant differences in the frequency
between tissues were shown only in three subgroups of
cir subfamily 2. In subgroup 2.5, a significant difference
was observed only between blood with a frequency of
30.2% and brain with a frequency of 7.6% (p < 0.01).
Differences between blood and liver (13.2%) as well as
blood and kidney (9.4%) did just not reach significance
(p < 0.07). In subgroup 2.6, the absence of cDNAs
obtained from brain resulted in a statistical difference
only to the frequency of clones derived from liver and
spleen samples with frequencies of 35.0% and 30%,
respectively (p < 0.05). Within the cir cDNA sequences
in subgroup 2.7, frequency of clones recovered from
brain was significantly increased in brain (25%)

compared to all other tissues with p < 0.01 for blood
(7.7%) and p < 0.05 for liver (11.5%), spleen (11.5%), kidney (11.5%), and lung (11.5%). See in Additional file 8
for the Newick format of the phylogenetic tree of cir
subfamily 2.
All these differences in tissue distribution of the transcribed cir cDNAs found in this cloning and sequencing
study are first indications for a tissues specific expression of cir genes and were analysed in more detail in
the subsequent experiments.
Expression profiling of cir genes in different host tissues

Due to these first differences in the expression of cir
genes, further analyses of different transcription profiles
in various host tissues during the infection were carried
out using RFLP of RT-PCR products in order to confirm
differences in expression of cir genes between different
host tissues for a larger number of mice.
Therefore, six mice were infected i.p. with 100 pRBCs.
Only four out of these six mice developed a patent
infection indicating that 100 pRBCs i.p. is close to the
minimal infectious dose and that the initial diversity of
parasites is kept at a minimum using this infection protocol. Organs and blood were again collected at about
30% parasitaemia, i.e. just before peak parasitaemia.
After amplification using the subfamily 1 and subfamily
2 specific primers, PCR products were digested with the
restriction enzyme AluI and analysed using the DNA
1000 kit for the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer for accurate
and reproducible separation and size determination (Figure 7).
Comparing the RFLP profiles, considerable differences in the banding patterns of the individual organs
for subfamily 1 and 2 were observed thus confirming
differences in expression of cir mRNAs between different host tissues. Nevertheless, the prominent fragments
observed in RFLP agreed in many, though not all cases
well with the restriction pattern obtained in silico from
the sequences of the cir clones described above (see
Additional file 9). This similarity of experimental RFLP
patterns and the in silico predicted restriction patterns
of some cir cDNA sequences of the cloning and
sequencing experiment suggested at least a similar
repertoire of amplified cir genes in both infection
experiments. On the other hand, none of the profile
pattern was identical between the four mice infected
with 100 P. chabaudi pRBCs taken from the same parental population. This indicates that random selection
of 100 pRBCs as starter population from a large parental population severely influences the initial cir gene
expression pattern. Despite the fact that patterns for
organs differed within individual mice, there was no
clear tissue-specific pattern detectable that was conserved between mice.

Figure 7 Expression profile analyses of cir genes in different tissues of infected mice by RT-PCR RFLP. For RFLP analyses, organs and
blood were collected at a parasitaemia of 30% from female NMRI mice infected with 100 pRBCs. After RT-PCR amplification for the six host
tissues with the subfamily-specific primers, 150 ng of purified RT-PCR products (approx. 600 bp) were digested with AluI. The DNA fragments (30
ng) were analysed using the DNA 1000 kit for the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer for accurate sizing. Compared are RT-PCR RFLP profiles of blood,
liver, spleen, kidney, lung and brain for four mice for cir subfamily 1 (A) and cir subfamily 2 (B). DNA 1000 bp ladder was used and in each lane
an upper (1000 bp, purple) and a lower (25 bp, green) marker are indicated.

For subfamily 1, no transcriptional differences between
the tissues were found in mouse A (Figure 7A). Moreover, the restriction pattern obtained for this mouse was
highly different in comparison to the restriction profiles
of mice B-D and the sizes of the individual fragments
did not clearly refer to any in silico fragments of cir
sequences obtained in the cloning study. This presence
or absence of individual fragments in the RT-PCR RFLP
profiles for subfamily 1 are further hints for a differential expression of cir genes in different host tissues. In
particular, in mouse B, additional fragments in restriction patterns were observed e.g. in brain (~ 370 bp) or
in kidney and lung (~ 340 bp) which were absent from
samples of all other tissues (Figure 7A). Further differences within the transcriptional profiles of cir subfamily
1 were detected e.g. in the spleen of mouse C, showing
a distinct banding pattern compared to the other five
tissues of the same mouse.
Differences - though generally less pronounced - were
also found in cir subfamily 2 (Figure 7B). An additional
fragment of ~ 400 bp was present e.g. in the liver of
mouse B which was absent in blood, spleen kidney,
lung, and brain samples from the same mouse.

Furthermore, two additional bands of cir fragments of
approximately 100-200 bp appeared in the spleen of
mouse B.
In conclusion, the differences in the transcriptional
profiles of the different host tissues found in this experiment confirmed a correlation between parasite tissue
localization on expression of specific cir genes.
Expression profiling of cir genes during the course of
infection

In the blood of mice infected with 100 pRBCs, changes
in the expression pattern of cir genes during the course
of infection could also be detected by RT-PCR RFLP
(Figure 8). The tail vein blood of mice infected i.p. with
100 pRBCs was passaged into naïve female NMRI mice
at days 7 (early infection), 14 (around peak parasitaemia), 21 (7 days after peak parasitaemia) and 35 (21
days after peak parasitaemia) p.i. For analyses, blood of
these passage mice was collected again at about 30%
parasitaemia, i.e. just before peak parasitaemia.
Surprisingly, only two out of four immunocompetent
mice (mouse 2 and 4) showed changes in expression of
subfamily 1 cir genes in the blood between day 7 (early

Figure 8 Transcriptional changes of cir gene expression during
the course of infection. For RFLP analyses of expression changes
of the cir genes during the course of infection, blood of female
NMRI mice infected with 100 pRBCs were passaged on days 7, 14
and 21 days post infections (d.p.i.) into naïve female NMRI mice.
Blood of these passaged mice was again collected at 30%
parasitaemia. After amplification using the subfamily-specific primers
for both subfamilies, 150 ng of purified RT-PCR products (approx.
600 bp) were digested with AluI and 30 ng were then analysed
using the DNA 1000 kit for the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. The RTPCR RFLP profiles for four mice of subfamily 1 are presented in (A).
The restriction digest of subfamily 2 are shown in the upper panel
of (B) where only at day 7 p.i. and day 14 p.i. of mouse 1 a few
smaller restriction fragments could be detected. Therefore a second
digest with XapI for 3 h at 37°C was performed (B, lower panel).
DNA 1000 bp ladder was used and in each lane an upper (1000 bp,
purple) and a lower (25 bp, green) marker are indicated.

infection), day 14 (around peak parasitaemia) and day 21
(after peak parasitaemia) (Figure 8A) p.i. However, the
virtually identical patterns produced here provide additional evidence for the reproducibility of the RFLP
method. In mouse 2, a completely different restriction
fragment pattern was observed at day 21 p.i., seven days

after peak parasitaemia, compared to the profiles of
early parasitaemia (day 7 p.i.) and peak parasitaemia
(day 14 p.i.). In mouse 4 the first differences in the
expression pattern of the cir genes were observed
already at peak parasitaemia (day 14 p.i.) and a completely changed RFLP pattern was found at day 21 p.i.
(after parasitaemia) compared to day 7 p.i. in the early
phase of infection. Surprisingly, however, no changes in
the expression pattern could be observed for subfamily
1 in mouse 1 and 3 (Figure 8A) and for all four mice in
subfamily 2. The same RFLP pattern of amplified cir
cDNAs could be identified throughout the course of an
infection (Figure 8B). Since AluI did apparently not cut
the cir subfamily 2 members expressed in this experiment, an additional restriction digestion with XapI was
then performed (Figure 8B) confirming further that no
changes in expression of cir subfamily 2 occurred in the
course of an infection in these mice.
At day 35 p.i., all mice had completely resolved the
infection irrespectively of changes in cir gene expression
pattern before. Apparently, a chronic infection of the
mice failed to occur after i.p. infection with 100 pRBC
whether or not changes in cir gene expression pattern
were detectable in the earlier infection.
Transcriptional profiling of cir genes throughout
intraerythrocytic development

For RFLP analyses of transcriptional changes of the cir
genes at different life cycle stages, 30 μl tail vein blood
of female NMRI mice infected with 100 pRBCs was collected at 3 h (early trophozoites), 10 h (late trophozoites) and 17 h (mature trophozoites and early
schizonts) after beginning of the light cycle on day 13 p.
i. (parasitaemia about 30%).
For cir subfamily 1, changes in the transcription profile could be detected in the course of a life cycle in all
four mice (Figure 9A). However, these changes were
much smaller than the dramatic transcriptional changes
in the course of an infection which were observed for
two out of four mice in Figure 8A. Only minimal
changes in the fragment pattern were also observed for
cir subfamily 2. Because of the very simple and uninformative restriction fragment pattern for cir subfamily 2
cDNAs in all mice, an additional restriction digestion
with XapI was again performed (Figure 9B) likewise
indicating only minimal differences in the transcription
pattern of cir subfamily 2 during the intraerythrocytic
life cycle of P. chabaudi.

Discussion
In order to improve understanding of host/parasite
interactions correlating antigenic variation and accumulation of parasite localization in different host tissues,
expression of the P. chabaudi cir multigene family was

Figure 9 Transcriptional changes of cir genes during
intraerythrocytic development. For expression profiling of the cir
genes at three different time points in the life cycle, 30 μl tail vein
blood of female NMRI mice infected with 100 pRBCs were collected
3 h (early trophozoites), 10 h (late trophozoites) and 17 h (mature
trophozoites and early schizonts) after beginning of the light cycle
on day 13 p.i. (parasitaemia about 30%). Amplification was
performed using the subfamily-specific primers for both subfamilies
and 150 ng of purified RT-PCR products (approx. 600 bp) were
digested with AluI and 30 ng were then analysed using the DNA
1000 kit for the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. The RFLP profiles of
subfamily 1 are shown for four mice in (A). The restriction digests of
subfamily 2 are shown in the upper panel of (B). Only a few
restriction fragments were detected in all samples, therefore RT-PCR
products were also restricted with XapI (B, lower panel). DNA 1000
bp ladder was used and in each lane an upper (1000 bp, purple)
and a lower (25 bp, green) marker were indicated.

analysed in vivo at the transcriptional level. Despite
diverse in vitro or in vivo investigations regarding antigenic variation in Plasmodium species, the complete
molecular mechanism of antigenic switching in the
parasites is, hitherto, far away from being fully

understood. The present study, therefore, examined P.
chabaudi infections in immunocompetent mice to get
further insight in the complex phenomenon of antigenic
variation and sequestration.
In an initial phylogenetic analysis of the annotated
repertoire of putative CIR proteins, two subfamilies and
an unassigned group of very long CIRs could be identified. While the subfamily 1 and 2 exhibit the predicted
primary structure of common PIR proteins, the unassigned CIR proteins show more divergence often due to
large insertions within the conserved CIR-BIR-YIR
domain.
It has already previously been proposed that different
subsets within the pir superfamily exhibit different functions. In P. yoelii and P. berghei, for example, a stage
specific role was assumed since not all pir genes are
transcribed equally when different life cycle stages were
compared [24,55]. Indeed, different roles for P. chabaudi
cir subfamily 1 (with changes in expression pattern) and
subfamily 2 (with minor or no changes in expression
pattern) genes are likely. The large insertions and additional transmembrane domains found within the group
of unassigned CIR proteins might also be interpreted as
hints for distinct functions of these proteins. Since none
of them has been examined in any functional or even
localization study, there is still no clue for the role these
proteins might play in the Plasmodium life cycle or in
the pathogens immune evasion strategy. For the VIR
proteins in P. vivax diverse protein domain and structure predictions have been suggested to indicate different functions for different subsets of these proteins as
for example those with PEXEL motif or those with additional transmembrane domains [56]. However, the presence or absence of the PEXEL motifs might simply
result in usage of alternative transport signals or pathways to the host cell membrane [57] and currently no
functional role has been suggested for any of the PIR
proteins with more than one transmembrane domain.
Since bioinformatic analysis of the CIR proteins revealed
not a single strong PEXEL motif, it can be assumed that
PEXEL motifs are not an important feature in the function of CIR proteins and that at least the majority of
PIR proteins is able to be transported to the pRBC surface without an obvious PEXEL translocation signal.
A common ancestry of the gene families forming the
pir superfamily has been postulated due to e.g. conserved sequence motifs as well as structural predictions
within the PIR sequences [20]. By phylogenetic comparison of CIR and YIR proteins as performed here, this
hypothesis can be further strengthened. The phylogenetic relationship of the CIR proteins with the widely
studied YIRs in P. yoelii shows that the YIR protein
sequences only share high similarity to CIR proteins of
subfamily 2 and neither to subfamily 1 nor the group of

Ebbinghaus and Krücken Malaria Journal 2011, 10:272
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/272

unassigned CIR proteins. Comparison to the YIR antigens of the close relative P. yoelii suggests that most of
the CIR sequences in the P. chabaudi genome have
evolved by diversification after separation of P. yoelii
and P. chabaudi from a common ancestor. Such a dispersing evolution of distinctly evolved subfamilies has
also been demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis of PIR
proteins encoded in P. yoelii and P. berghei genomes
[52] and it is likely that the high variability of antigens
in the individual malaria species distinctly evolved probably in response of the host immune pressure.
In this study a non-clonal P. chabaudi line very similar to the clonal P. chabaudi AS strain was used. The
deduced protein sequences of the amplified cir transcripts of these parasites, however, were quite similar
but not identical to the annotated putative CIR predicted from the genome sequence of the clonal P. chabaudi AS strain supposing a high variability of antigens
even between closely related strains within the same
species.
Cloning and sequencing of a first subset of cir genes
demonstrated that a broad range of subfamily 1 and subfamily 2 cir genes is transcribed during a P. chabaudi
infection in immunocompetent mice infected with a starter population of a minimal size. These findings are consistent with those described previously for other pir
multigene families, e.g. the vir genes in P. vivax, the yir
genes in P. yoelii and the bir genes in P. berghei
[25,26,55]. In contrast to the mutually exclusive expression of only one var gene found in P. falciparum parasites cultured in vitro [58], it has been shown that in P.
vivax and in several rodents Plasmodium species many
different pir genes were transcribed in vivo within a parasite population in an individual host. Interestingly, examinations of natural P. falciparum infected human samples
has shown that - in contrast to the limited transcription
pattern in cultured P. falciparum parasites - many transcripts of var and stevor genes are also transcribed simultaneously in vivo [59,60]. Such contradictory in vivo and
in vitro findings make clear that in vivo models such as P.
chabaudi or other rodent malaria parasites are essential
for complex investigations of antigenic variation.
In accordance with previous studies of the yir genes of
P. yoelii [24], switching of cir gene expression could be
detected around peak parasitaemia in the course of
infection suggesting that antigenic variation might be
modulated by selective forces exercised by the host
immune system. However, these transcriptional changes
were not observed in all infected mice and, moreover,
were not detectable to the same extent for all cir subfamilies. Most marked differences in mRNA expression
patterns could be observed for cir subfamily 1 whereas
no or obviously less transcriptional switching was
detected for cir subfamily 2 during the infection.

Page 15 of 19

Completely different cir gene expression patterns of
the progenies derived from 100 pRBCs starter populations originating from the same parental population
strongly suggest that a large parasite population can be
extremely heterogeneous. In micromanipulated P. yoelii
pRBCs, it has been shown that only one to three different yir transcripts were transcribed within an individual
cell but many different transcripts were detected within
a whole parasite population [25]. In addition, rapid
switching in the transcribed repertoires of yir genes
between different clonal host parasites populations and
parasite developmental stages has been described.
Although no infections with single pRBCs were performed in the present study, the initial diversity of parasites was apparently kept at a minimum using the
minimal infectious dose resulting in patent infections by
intraperitoneal infection as revealed by the substantial
differences in RT-PCR RFLP patterns between mice
infected with 100 pRBCs. Therefore, the number of
transcribed cir genes per pRBC is presumably also much
lower than that found to be transcribed in a large
population.
Previous studies have analysed switching between different yir genes in P. yoelii infected mice both in immunocompetent [24] and highly immunodeficient [25]
mice. Efficient and frequent switching of expressed yir
genes could be observed even in the absence of any
selecting force of an adaptive immune system [25]. The
fact that cir gene subfamily 1 and subfamily 2 expression
patterns apparently do not necessarily change in the
course of a P. chabaudi infection in immunocompetent
mice even within three weeks suggests lower on-off
switching frequencies at least for these groups of cir
genes. This is particularly surprising as adaptive immune
responses are well known to effectively select for parasites expressing new variant antigens in other protozoan
parasites [61-63].
Changes in the expression patterns of variant antigens
appear to occur more frequently in cir subfamily 1 than
in subfamily 2. No data are currently available for
switching frequencies within the highly heterogeneous
group of unassigned cir genes. Fonager et al [52] already
speculated that within the yir gene family those genes
belonging to highly heterogeneous groups would be
more important for antigenic variation than members of
more conventional subfamilies. The phylogenetic analysis including members of all previously defined yir
groups [52] shows that even the most divergent YIR
proteins cluster together with the CIR subfamily 2. This
suggests that subfamily 2 is ancient among the CIR proteins while subfamily 1 and the unassigned CIR proteins
have probably evolved from ancient genes by diversification. The higher apparent switching frequency observed
for cir subfamily 1 than subfamily 2 genes is a first

Ebbinghaus and Krücken Malaria Journal 2011, 10:272
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/272

experimental hint corroborating the hypothesis that
those pir family members that evolved relatively recently
might play a more prominent role for antigenic variation
than those showing ancient properties [52]. Future work
in both P. yoelii and P. chabaudi should, therefore, no
longer neglect these unusual pir members from the analyses but should pay special attention to them.
Analysis of changes in cir gene expression patterns in
the course of one asexual round of multiplication in 24
h revealed only minor changes in gene expression for
subfamily 1 and virtually no changes for subfamily 2. In
particular, no reduction in the complexity of the cir
genes in late parasite stages was observed in comparison
to early rings as has been described for var genes [58].
Since Cunningham et al [25] found evidence that in P.
yoelii even schizonts transcribe at least up to three different yir genes, a mutually exclusive expression of pir
genes in late individual parasites or parasite populations
appears to be highly unlikely. The same was also shown
for vir genes in P. vivax with more than one antigen
expressed in a single parasite and different expression
patterns between parasites [26]. Transcriptomic analysis
of P. vivax intraerythrocytic developmental cycle stages
also revealed that many vir genes are expressed early
during the ring stage and turned off later while others
are expressed predominantly in schizonts [64]. These
authors could not find any linkage between the position
of the vir gene within the phylogenetic tree and its predominant expression time. In contrast to these results,
only minor changes during the intraerythrocytic cycle
were found in the present study. Possible explanations
for this discrepancy include the fact that of course the
RFLP analysis is less sensitive with regard to the detection of changes in expression of individual genes when
compared to the microarray method used by Bozdech et
al [64]. In addition, only for about 60% of the vir genes
consistent temporal expression patterns could be
observed for three different P. vivax isolates. If the
highly expressed genes show no temporal expression
pattern, such a pattern would clearly not be detectable
with the RFLP method used here since it is not able to
detect minor cir transcripts at all. Finally, the different
experimental designs with only 100 pRBCs as founders
in the cir gene study and non-selected parasites from
naturally infected patients for the P. vivax transcriptome
study might well contribute to the observed differences.
Remarkable differences in the mRNA expression patterns between pRBCs in blood, liver, spleen, kidney,
lung and brain could be observed suggesting a host-tissue specific expression of cir genes. It is believed that
the PIR proteins, like the Pfemp1 protein family in P.
falciparum, are possibly involved in adhesion to host
receptors thus mediating accumulation and sequestration in different host tissues. For the BIR or YIR

Page 16 of 19

proteins, for example, an expression of these molecules
on the surface of pRBCs has already been demonstrated
[24,27] but neither direct nor indirect evidence for a
correlation of an adhesion of PIR proteins to host
endothelial cells has yet been found. Accumulation of
pRBCs in different tissues expressing different cir genes,
however, can be considered to be a first experimental
hint that CIR and maybe also other PIR proteins might
indeed be involved in adhesion and sequestration.
Whether rapid and dramatic changes in tissue distribution of P. chabaudi parasites at peak parasitaemia, i.e.
exclusion from the splenic red pulp [65], has effects on
cir gene expression patterns would also be interesting to
analyse in the future. Since P. chabaudi is the only frequently used experimental malaria model with synchronous development and a strong sequestration
phenotype, these results suggest that further studies of
CIR proteins will provide important new insights into
the interaction of non-P. falciparum malaria pRBC with
host epithelia.

Conclusions
The present study has demonstrated for the first time
that there are differences in the tissue-specific expression of some cir genes. These results suggest a possible
correlation between the expression of CIR antigens and
accumulation of parasites in inner organs of the host.
The high agreement in results obtained for transcriptional switching and antigenic variation of the cir genes
with that for other members of the pir superfamily indicate very well that the cir genes are promising candidates for further functional studies. For example
parasites expressing certain CIRs constitutively as transgenes might improve understanding of the functional
role of the pir superfamily in Plasmodium infections.
