Abstract
Background: The human genome contains a large number of gene clusters with multiple-variablefirst exons, including the drug-metabolizing UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1) and I-branching
β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GCNT2, also known as IGNT) clusters, organized in a
tandem array, similar to that of the protocadherin (PCDH), immunoglobulin (IG), and T-cell
receptor (TCR) clusters. To gain insight into the evolutionary processes that may have shaped their
diversity, we performed comprehensive comparative analyses for vertebrate multiple-variable-firstexon clusters.
Results: We found that there are species-specific variable-exon duplications and mutations in the
vertebrate Ugt1, Gcnt2, and Ugt2a clusters and that their variable and constant genomic
organizations are conserved and vertebrate-specific. In addition, analyzing the complete repertoires
of closely-related Ugt2 clusters in humans, mice, and rats revealed extensive lineage-specific
duplications. In contrast to the Pcdh gene clusters, gene conversion does not play a predominant
role in the evolution of the vertebrate Ugt1, Gcnt2 and Ugt2 gene clusters. Thus, their tremendous
diversity is achieved through "birth-and-death" evolution. Comparative analyses and homologous
modeling demonstrated that vertebrate UGT proteins have similar three-dimensional structures
each with N-terminal and C-terminal Rossmann-fold domains binding acceptor and donor
substrates, respectively. Molecular docking experiments identified key residues in donor and
acceptor recognition and provided insight into the catalytic mechanism of UGT glucuronidation,
suggesting the human UGT1A1 residue histidine 39 (H39) as a general base and the residue aspartic
acid 151 (D151) as an important electron-transfer helper. In addition, we identified four
hypervariable regions in the N-terminal Rossmann domain that form an acceptor-binding pocket.
Finally, analyzing patterns of nonsynonymous and synonymous nucleotide substitutions identified
codon sites that are subject to positive Darwinian selection at the molecular level. These diversified
residues likely play an important role in recognition of myriad xenobiotics and endobiotics.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that enormous diversity of vertebrate multiple variable first
exons is achieved through birth-and-death evolution and that adaptive evolution of specific codon
sites enhances vertebrate UGT diversity for defense against environmental agents. Our results also
have interesting implications regarding the staggering molecular diversity required for chemical
detoxification and drug clearance.

Background
Alternative splicing is one of the most important mechanisms to generate molecular diversity in vertebrates. A
large number of alternatively spliced genes that have multiple"variable" first exons have been identified in the
human genome, including protocadherin (PCDH), UDPglucuronosyltransferase (UGT), plectin (PLEC1), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1), and glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) genes [1]. In particular, the closely-linked
vertebrate Pcdh α and γ clusters have a striking genomic
organization each containing more than a dozen variable
first exons and three downstream "constant" exons [2-7].
Alternative splicing of each variable exon to the common
set of constant exons generates diverse functional mRNA
molecules that encode a large number of cadherin-like
cell-surface proteins in the central nervous system (CNS).
Comparative analyses suggest that gene duplication, gene
conversion, and variable exon mutation play important
roles in vertebrate Pcdh evolution [3-5]. In addition, adaptive selection of specific residues in the ectodomains
enhances mammalian Pcdh diversity [5]. Combinatorial
interactions between these Pcdh proteins contribute to
the establishment and maintenance of trillions of diverse
yet very specific neuronal connections in the vertebrate
CNS.
In the vertebrate adaptive immune system, the immunoglobulin (Ig), T-cell receptor (Tcr), and major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) gene clusters provide the
enormous diversity required for immune defense. The Ig
and Tcr clusters are organized into variable and constant
regions. Gene duplications and somatic DNA rearrangements generate tremendous diversity for mammalian Ig
and Tcr molecules. Moreover, positive natural selection
operates on the complementarity-determining regions
(CDRs) of the IG and TCR proteins to increase their diversity [8-11]. The Mhc genes are also clustered. The encoded
MHC proteins (both class I and II human HLA molecules)
have a deep peptide-binding groove formed by a β-sheet
bottom floor and two α-helix side walls [12,13]. Each
MHC protein can bind a large set of different peptides. In
addition, most of the polymorphic residues on the β-sheet
floor and two α-helix side walls point towards the peptide-binding groove and serve as ligands for numerous
processed antigens [14-16]. Finally, diversity-enhancing
overdominant selection operates on the antigen-binding
sites of both class I and II MHC proteins enabling them to
recognize diverse processed antigens [11,17,18]. Vertebrate animals evolved these three gene families through
birth-and-death evolution of repeated duplication and
mutation, in conjunction with positive selection, to
remove a staggering number of different foreign antigens
in a highly specific fashion [11,19].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/69

Vertebrate animals also remove hundreds of thousands
xeno- and endobiotic lipophilic compounds from their
bodies by converting them to water-soluble glucuronides
through glucuronidation [20]. This detoxification pathway converts lipophilic aglycones to hydrophilic molecules and facilitates their excretion from the body.
Glucuronidation is catalyzed by members of the UGT glucuronosyltransferase proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [21,22]. Vertebrate UGT proteins belong to a
large supergene family of ubiquitous glycosyltransferases
(GT) [23] (currently >10,000, classified into 87 subfamilies). Diverse members of the GT superfamily are
noted for their low sequence similarity but, surprisingly,
belong to only two structural folds (GT-A and GT-B) [24].
Glucuronidation is also an important pathway for
biotransformation and clearance of drugs, such as colorectal cancer drug irinotecan [25-27]. Genetic polymorphisms or mutations in human UGT genes have profound
impacts on hyperbilirubinemia, drug metabolism, and
cancer treatment [20,27-29]. For example, mutations of
the human UGT1A1 gene cause genetic diseases with phenotypes ranging from mild jaundice to lethal kernicterus
[20,28,30,31].
The human UGT1 cluster has an unusual genetic structure
(Fig. 1A) which is strikingly similar to that of the Pcdh
clusters [1]. Specifically, the human UGT1 cluster is organized into variable and constant regions [1,21,29,32,33].
About a dozen very similar human, mouse, and rat UGT1
variable exons (divided into bilirubin and phenol groups)
are organized in a tandem array, which are followed by
four constant exons (Fig. 1A) [1,33,34]. Splicing of each
variable exon to the four constant exons generates diverse
functional UGT1 mRNAs. Each variable exon encodes a
signal peptide and the N-terminal aglycone-recognition
domain of a UGT1 protein. The four constant exons
encode the common C-terminal domain that binds the
UDP glucuronic acid (UDPGA) donor substrate and an
ER-anchoring transmembrane segment.
The role of the UGT genes in metabolizing myriad xenoand endobiotic compounds suggests that natural selection may have played an important role in shaping their
variation; however, the effects selection might have on
such unusual genomic structures are unclear. To gain
insight into the evolution of multiple variable first exons,
we annotated the complete vertebrate Ugt1, Gcnt2, and
Ugt2a repertoires and identified 65 (for mRNA and protein sequences see Additional file 1), 16 (Additional file
2), and 16 (Additional file 3) new genes, respectively.
Phylogenetic analyses on these clusters revealed lineagespecific duplications of variable exons and conservation
of constant exons. Our results suggest that functional
diversity of these clusters is achieved through the birth-

dimensional (3D) structure model of the vertebrate UGT
proteins based on sequence analyses of 91 UGT1 and 35
UGT2 GT-B proteins, and the known crystal structures of
the non-vertebrate GT-B glycosyltransferases. Molecular
docking of donor and acceptor ligands to the human
UGT1A1 structure shed light on the specificity of the
donor recognition and diversity of acceptor bindings. In
particular, we identified four hypervariable regions within
the N-terminal domain that form a potential acceptorbinding pocket. We also identified Ugt codon sites that
may have been subject to Darwinian positive selection
during vertebrate evolution by analyzing patterns of
nucleotide (nt) substitutions at individual codon sites.
Interestingly, the diversified residues in the four hypervariable regions map to an acceptor-binding pocket. These
residues likely contribute to the required specificity for
binding numerous hydrophobic small molecules. These
results suggest that adaptive natural selection of specific
codon sites plays an important role for enhancing UGT
diversity. In summary, our results provide insight into the
evolution of multiple variable exons and structural diversity of UGT proteins required for the removal of numerous xenobiotic compounds and endogenous metabolites.

exons, which are essential in maintaining their basic functions. In addition, analyzing the complete repertoires of
closely-related Ugt2b clusters in humans, mice, and rats
identified a new rat Ugt2b gene (designated Ugt2b39;
Additional file 3) and revealed extensive lineage-specific
duplications.
To gain insight into the catalytic mechanisms of glucuronidation by diverse UGT glucuronosyltransferases, we
sought evidence for structural features in donor and
acceptor recognition by combined comparative analysis
and homologous modeling [35]. We built the first three-

Results and Discussion
The vertebrate Ugt1 gene cluster
We analyzed Ugt1 locus in a set of diverse vertebrate species including primates, non-primate mammals, birds,
and fish (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1). Chimpanzees are
the closest living relatives of humans, and their genomic
sequences are highly similar to those of humans. We
found that two Ugt1 genes differ between humans and
chimpanzees (Fig. 1A and 1B) although these species only
diverged as recently as several million years ago [36]. The
chimpanzee Ugt1a2 has a complete open reading frame
suggesting being a functional gene while the human
UGT1A2 has a single-nt deletion at coding position 127
causing a frameshift. In contrast, the human UGT1A5 is a
functional gene while the chimpanzee Ugt1a5 appears to
be a pseudogene because its sequences have a single-nt
deletion at coding position 704. This frameshift deletion
is confirmed by more than 10 different sequence reads.

We also annotated the rhesus monkey and baboon Ugt1
clusters (Fig. 1C and 1D). The Ugt1 clusters in these two
old-world-monkey species contain one more functional
variable exon than the human and chimpanzee Ugt1 clusters. Specifically, the bilirubin group (Ugt1 a1-a5) is
expanded in these two species. Compared with humans
and chimpanzees, the Ugt1a5 appears to have been duplicated to Ugt1a5a and Ugt1a5b in both rhesus monkey and
baboon (Fig. 1C and 1D). The functional duplication of
Ugt1a5 in baboon has also been reported in a very recent
publication [37]. However, the Ugt1a5b has been mutated
to a pseudogene in rhesus monkey because its sequences

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:69

have a single-nt insertion in the coding region (Fig. 1C).
In addition, the Ugt1a3 has been mutated to a pseudogene
in both rhesus monkey and baboon. Finally, the rhesus
monkey Ugt1a4 variable exon appears to have been duplicated to Ugt1a4a and Ugt1a4b (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the
baboon Ugt1a2 variable exon has also been duplicated;
however, one duplicated copy has been mutated to a
pseudogene Ugt1a2b (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the rhesus
monkey Ugt1a7 in the whole-genome-shotgun traces has
no stop codon mutation; however, the Ugt1a7 in the finished BAC clone (Accession No. AC171066.4) has a stop
codon at coding position 670. This observation suggests
that Ugt1a7 has both functional and nonfunctional alleles
segregating in the rhesus monkey population.
Dogs belong to the order Carnivora within the Laurasiatheria clade of mammals; while primates and rodents
belong to the Euarchontoglire clade [38]. Dogs diverged
from humans at about 94 million years ago while rodents
diverged from primates at about 85 million years ago. The
dog Ugt1 cluster contains 10 functional variable exons
(Fig. 1E). Members of the dog Ugt1 cluster can also be
divided into the bilirubin and phenol groups. Compared
with the primate Ugt1 cluster, the genomic region of the
dog Ugt1 cluster is about 50 kb smaller (Fig. 1E).
The chicken separated from mammals about 310 million
years ago [39]. Similar to the mammalian Ugt1 clusters,
the chicken Ugt1 cluster is also organized into variable
and constant regions and it has 14 variable exons arrayed
in tandem, including one with frameshift mutations (Fig.
1F). Members of the chicken Ugt1 cluster can also be separated into bilirubin and phenol groups. The genomic
region of the chicken Ugt1 cluster is much smaller than
that of mammals (Fig. 1F).
The zebrafish has supernumerary Pcdh genes organized
into two duplicated clusters [4,5,7]. Consistent with
whole genome duplications in the teleost fish species and
similar to the duplication of the zebrafish Pcdh clusters
[4,5,7], the zebrafish Ugt1 cluster has been duplicated
into the Ugt1 a and b clusters each organized into variable
and constant regions (Fig. 1G). In contrast to the vast
expansion of the zebrafish Pcdh variable regions compared with mammals, the zebrafish Ugt1a and Ugt1b variable regions have not expanded. Specifically, compared
with about a dozen Ugt1 variable exons in mammals, the
zebrafish Ugt1a cluster only has seven functional variable
exons, while the zebrafish Ugt1b cluster has only six functional variable exons (Fig. 1G). In total, we identified 13
novel zebrafish Ugt1 variable exons. Both zebrafish Ugt1a
and Ugt1b clusters span a region of about 35 kb genomic
sequences, much smaller than other vertebrate species
analyzed.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/69

The constant regions of mammalian, avian, and fish Ugt1
clusters are highly conserved and each contain 4 constant
exons (Fig. 1). The length of each constant exon is identical among all vertebrate species except that the fourth constant exons are slightly smaller in frogs and zebrafish,
encoding shorter polypeptides (Additional file 4). The
two zebrafish constant sequences are highly similar with a
70% identity at the nt level and a 78% similarity at the
polypeptide level. This observation strongly suggests that
the two zebrafish Ugt1 clusters are duplicated from a single ancestral cluster. The polypeptides encoded by constant regions are highly conserved in vertebrates
(Additional file 4).
Evolutionary relationship among members of the
vertebrate Ugt1 clusters
Similar to the Pcdh clusters [40], the variable region of
each vertebrate UGT1 protein is encoded by a single unusually large exon (Fig. 1). These Ugt1 variable exons are
similar and are of almost identical length with the same
reading frame. Each human, mouse, and rat Ugt1 variable
exon is preceded by a distinct promoter [1,20,21,32,33].
Consistently, there is a highly-conserved sequence motif
upstream from each vertebrate Ugt1 variable exon (Additional file 5), suggesting that these conserved promoter
motif sequences play a role in tissue-specific Ugt1 gene
regulation in vertebrates. The encoded variable polypeptides have the same predicted 3D domain structures (see
below). Each variable polypeptide consists of a signal
sequence followed by an aglycone-recognition domain.
Their evolutionary relationships are shown as an
unrooted phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). In conjunction with
the clustered genomic organization (Fig. 1), the tree demonstrates that variable exons of the Ugt1 clusters are duplicated in tandem. Some members are maintained, while
others are inactivated by deleterious mutations in specific
vertebrate lineages, suggesting that birth-and-death evolution has occurred in the Ugt1 cluster.

The mammalian and avian Ugt1 clusters can be divided
into two major groups (constant-proximal bilirubin
group and constant-distal phenol group) (Fig. 1). These
groups each have a long major branch while members
within each group have relatively shorter secondary
branches in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that members within each group were duplicated recently (Fig. 2).
The human, chimpanzee, baboon, rhesus monkey, and
dog Ugt1a1 is orthologous. However, there is no obvious
orthologous Ugt1a1 in the chicken Ugt1 cluster, suggesting that the specialization of bilirubin glucuronidation by
Ugt1a1 occurs after the divergence of mammals and birds.
Interestingly, the mammalian Ugt1a6 is orthologous and
is remotely similar to three avian Ugt1 variable exons (a4,
a8, and a9). This observation indicates that Ugt1a6 is
more ancient than other Ugt1 members.

Phylogenetic tree clusters
Phylogenetic tree of human (h), chimpanzee (c), rhesus monkey (m), baboon (b), dog (d), chicken (Gallus gallus [gg]), and
zebrafish (z) Ugt1 clusters. The major tree branches are labeled with the percentage support (only when >50%) for that partition based on 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The scale bar equals a distance of 0.1.
Members of the zebrafish Ugt1 clusters do not display
orthologous relationships to those of the mammalian and
avian Ugt1 clusters. Instead, they display paralogous relationships in one major branch of the phylogenetic tree
(Fig. 2). They can be divided into three subgroups: subgroup 1 includes z1a1, z1a3, and z1b1, subgroup 2
includes z1b2-b7, and subgroup 3 includes z1a2 and z1a4a7. The zebrafish Ugt1 a and b variable exons and the corresponding constant exons seem to have resulted from a
duplication of an ancestral one-variable Ugt1 gene. Subsequently, the variable exons in each cluster are duplicated
multiple rounds. For example, the zebrafish Ugt1 a1 and
a2, and a3 and a4 seem to be duplicated from an ancestral
two-variable-exon unit because a1 and a3, and a2 and a4
share more sequence similarity, respectively. However,
other zebrafish Ugt1 a and b variable exons seem to be

duplicated in tandem because neighboring ones are more
similar to each other.
Gene conversion plays an important role in the evolution
of supergene families. Tandem gene arrays are often subject to sequence homogenization through gene conversion. For example, tandem arrayed Pcdh variable exons
undergo strikingly predominant gene conversion events,
especially among physically close exons [4]. To determine
whether gene conversion played a similar prominent role
in the evolution of vertebrate Ugt1 clusters, we used the
Geneconv program [41] to search for gene conversion
events among Ugt1 variable exons. Surprisingly, we did
not find prevalent gene conversion events in the vertebrate Ugt1 clusters, except in the dog Ugt1 locus where
gene conversion events have occurred in the phenol sub-

iable exon is preceded by a distinct promoter and is separately spliced to a set of two constant exons to generate
functional Gcnt2 mRNA. We analyzed the vertebrate
Gcnt2 clusters and found that the numbers of variable
exons are different among mammals, birds, amphibians,
and fishes (Fig. 3 and Additional file 2). The three Gcnt2
variable exons are conserved in chimpanzees and rhesus
monkeys (Fig. 3B and 3C). They are also conserved in
dogs, mice, and rats (Fig. 3D, 3E, and 3F). However, there
are only two Gcnt2 variable exons in the opossum genome
(Fig. 3G). Thus, the three Gcnt2 variable exons are conserved in primates, canids, and rodents but not opossums
(Fig. 3A–G). There are only two Gcnt2 variable exons in
the chicken and frog genomes (Fig. 3H and 3I). Finally,
there is only one Gcnt2 variable exon in zebrafish (Fig. 3J).
These results suggest that the tetrapod Gcnt2 variable
exons were expanded by tandem duplication during vertebrate evolution.

gallus [gg]), (I) frog (Xenopus tropicalis [xt]), and (J) zebrafish
(Danio rerio [dr]) Gcnt2 clusters. Each cluster contains multiple-variable and highly-similar first exons (green boxes)
arrayed in tandem and a common set of two downstream
constant exons (red boxes). Exon length is indicated within

below the corresponding panels.

group (Ugt1 a7-a11) (Additional file 6). Consistently, no
gene conversion event was detected between any two
functional baboon genes [37]. This observation suggests
that, in striking contrast to the Pcdh clusters, concerted
evolution does not play a predominant role in the evolvement of the vertebrate Ugt1 cluster.
The organization and evolution of the vertebrate Gcnt2
cluster
The human, mouse, and rat Gcnt2 (also known as IGnT)
clusters each contain three highly similar variable exons
and two constant exons [1] (Fig. 3A, 3E, and 3F). Each var-

The vertebrate Gcnt2 variable exons are about the same
length and are very similar to each other. The encoded
polypeptides are highly conserved (Additional file 7).
Each Gcnt2 variable domain has a hydrophobic transmembrane segment close to the N-terminal (Additional
file 7). They also contain six cysteine residues that are
identical among all GCNT2 proteins (Additional file 7).
An evolutionary tree was built according to the variable
GCNT2 polypeptides (Additional file 8). The three Gcnt2
variable exons display orthologous relationships among
all eutherian mammals. Interestingly, the two opossum
Gcnt2 variable exons display a paralogous relationship
and appear to be more similar to the eutherian Gcnt2b variable exons. The two chicken and frog Gcnt2 variable
exons also display paralogous relationships and are divergent from the mammalian Gcnt2 variable exons. The single zebrafish Gcnt2 variable exon appears most closely
related to the frog Gcnt2 variable exons. This result supports the hypothesis that the Gcnt2 variable exons have
expanded in tetrapods through tandem duplications during vertebrate evolution. The genomic organization of the
Gcnt2 constant region is highly conserved in vertebrates
(Fig. 3). For example, the first constant exons of vertebrate
Gcnt2 cluster are all 93 nts in length except in mice, frogs,
and zebrafish, which are 96, 90, and 96 nts, respectively.
The encoded constant protein sequences are conserved
and have three identical cysteine residues (Additional file
9).
The vertebrate Ugt2 cluster
We previously identified more than three thousand
human genes with multiple first exons through a genomewide computational analysis; however, only the first
exons of the PCDH and GCNT2 clusters are highly similar
[1]. We have noted that the genomic organization of the
human UGT2A cluster [42] is also similar to that of the

UGT1, PCDH, and GCNT2 clusters. In particular, the Cterminal domains of the human UGT2A proteins are identical and are encoded by a set of five constant exons; by
contrast, the N-terminal domains are similar and each is
encoded by a single variable exon. However, in contrast to
the human UGT1 cluster, the human UGT2A cluster only
contains two variable exons which share 64% nt sequence
identity. The variable and constant organizations of the
Ugt2a cluster are conserved in human, mouse, and rat
genomes (Additional file 10, panels A, B, and C). For
example, the human, mouse and rat Ugt2a variable exons
are similar and of the same length. We annotated the
Ugt2a clusters in several additional mammalian species
(Additional file 3) and found that the Ugt2a organization
of two variable exons and five constant exons is conserved.
In contrast to the expansion of the mammalian Ugt1 clusters compared with zebrafish (Fig. 1), we found that the
variable region of the zebrafish Ugt2a cluster is expanded
in comparison to the mammalian variable regions and
contains 4 novel variable exons (Additional files 3 and
10). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the mammalian Ugt2 a1 and a2 variable exons display a strict orthologous relationship (Additional file 11). However, there is
no orthologous relationship between mammalian and
zebrafish Ugt2a variable exons. The four zebrafish Ugt2a
variable exons appear to be duplicated in tandem, with
the Ugt2 a3 and a4 duplicated most recently (Additional
file 11). Multiple sequence alignment demonstrates that
all vertebrate Ugt2a variable protein sequences are highly
similar (Additional file 12). Like the constant region of
the mammalian Ugt2a cluster, the zebrafish Ugt2a constant region contains 5 exons, which are highly similar to
those of mammals. In particular, the sizes of constant
exons 1 to 4 are identical between zebrafish and mammals, respectively. The zebrafish Ugt2a constant exon 5
coding region is 18 nts longer than the corresponding
mammalian Ugt2a constant exon (Additional file 10, panels D and E). The polypeptides encoded by Ugt2a constant
region are highly conserved in vertebrates (Additional file
13).
We performed a comprehensive analysis of the closelyrelated human, mouse, and rat Ugt2b genes and found
one novel rat Ugt2b gene, designated Ugt2b39 (Additional file 10, panel C). The human, mouse, and rat Ugt2b
genes are also clustered and are located very close to the
Ugt2a cluster [21,33]. However, the genomic organizations of the human, mouse, and rat Ugt2b genes are different from the Ugt2a genes in that the Ugt2b genes do
not share common constant exons. Each member of the
Ugt2b cluster is an independent gene and contains six
exons (Additional file 10). All corresponding exons are
highly similar among members of the Ugt2b cluster. Their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/69

exon lengths are also identical among different mammalian species. The encoded UGT2B proteins are highly conserved among humans, mice, and rats. The transcription
directions are the same for all members of the rat Ugt2b
cluster, and are also the same for members of the rat Ugt2a
genes. However, the transcription directions for members
of the Ugt2b cluster are not the same in the human and
mouse genomes (Additional file 10).
The evolutionary relationships of the Ugt2b genes are
shown as an unrooted phylogenetic tree (Additional file
14). The human UGT2B genes display paralogous relationships while members of the mouse and rat Ugt2b clusters display both paralogous and orthologous
relationships. For example, the mouse Ugt2b1 and
Ugt2b34 appears to be orthologous to the rat Ugt2b1 and
Ugt2b34, respectively. However, the rat Ugt2b39 and
Ugt2b34 genes appear to be duplicated from an ancestral
gene because they are very similar and are also located
next to each other (Additional file 10). The other mouse
and rat Ugt2b genes do not have orthologous relationships. The phylogenetic tree suggests that most human,
mouse, and rat Ugt2b genes are duplicated after speciation
(Additional file 14).
In summary, we analyzed the Ugt1 loci in chimpanzee,
rhesus monkey, baboon, dog, chicken, and zebrafish, and
identified 65 new vertebrate Ugt1 genes (Additional file
1). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the avian and
mammalian Ugt1 variable regions are expanded compared to zebrafish (Figs. 1 and 2). We also performed a
comprehensive analysis of the vertebrate Gcnt2 cluster
and identified 16 new Gcnt2 genes (Additional file 2), and
found that the variable region of the Gcnt2 cluster is also
expanded during vertebrate evolution (Fig. 3). Finally, we
analyzed the vertebrate Ugt2 repertoires and found that,
in contrast to Ugt1 and Gcnt2 clusters, the zebrafish Ugt2a
variable region has been expanded compared with mammals (Additional file 10). These results suggest that these
vertebrate variable exons are subject to lineage-specific
birth-and-death evolution.
Structure modeling of the vertebrate UGT proteins
The human UGT proteins allow our body to remove myriad endogenous metabolites and exogenous chemicals,
such as steroids, bilirubin, bile acids, hormones, carcinogens, environmental toxicants, and therapeutic drugs
[20,26]. Understanding their structures will shed light on
the substrate specificity [22,26]. However, the 3D structure information, either based on X-ray data or molecular
modeling, is not available to date. There are currently five
crystal structures of the GT-B family members (MurG [43],
GtfB [44], GtfA [45], GtfD [46], and UGT71G1 [47]).
These structures are related although their primary
sequences are divergent [24,47]. To comparatively model

vertebrate UGT protein structures, we first aligned the bacterial and plant GT-B polypeptides based on their 3D
structures. We then aligned this structure-based alignment
to the human UGT1A1 sequence based on the predicted
vertebrate UGT secondary structure profile. We also
aligned 91 vertebrate UGT1 and 35 human, mouse, rat,
and zebrafish UGT2 polypeptides. Each of these translated 126 polypeptides has a signal peptide at the N-terminal and a 17-amino-acid (aa) transmembrane segment
close to the C-terminal with about 20 amino acids on the
cytoplasmic side. The mature UGT proteins mostly reside
in the lumen of the ER [22]. The structure of the human
UGT1A1 within the ER lumen was modeled based on the
alignment with UGT71G1 (Fig. 4A).
Our modeled 3D structure is consistent with that the vertebrate UGT proteins belong to the GT-B superfamily of
the inverting glycosyltransferases [22,24]. Each modeled
vertebrate UGT protein consists of two domains with similar core structure of Rossmann folds [48]. As an example,
the modeled 3D structure of the human UGT1A1 protein
is shown in Figure 4B. The N-terminal acceptor-binding
domains of UGT1 proteins are each encoded by highlysimilar variable exons in all vertebrate species (Fig. 1). The
C-terminal donor-binding domains of UGT1 proteins are
identical in each species and are encoded by four constant
exons (Fig. 1). For UGT2 proteins, the acceptor-binding
domains are encoded by first two exons which correspond
to a single Ugt1 variable exon, and the donor-binding
domains are encoded by the last four exons [21]. The Cterminal domains of all vertebrate UGT proteins are
highly conserved and assumed to bind the donor UDPGA
[22].
The N-terminal acceptor-binding domain of the modeled
human UGT1A1 contains a central seven-parallel-strand
β-pleated sheet with a topological arrangement of β3, β2,
β1, β4, β5, β6, β7 (Fig. 4B). This core β sheet is flanked by
8 α helices. The first three β strands are connected by two
α helices (arranged in α2 and α1 orientation) on the same
side of the β sheet as the Nα7 helix, which is from the Cterminal sequences but is located below the last four β
strands in the N-terminal domain. The other side of the
core β sheet contains five helices with a topological
arrangement of α3, α4, α5b, α5, α6. Similar to the structure of UGT71G1, there is a small two-stranded β sheet
following the Nα5 helix. In contrast to the structure of
UGT71G1, there is a flexible loop and a small predicted α
helix following the Nα3 helix (Fig. 4B). This segment is
predicted to have different conformations among different human UGT proteins.
The C-terminal donor-binding domain contains a central
six-parallel-strand β-pleated sheet with a topology
arrangement of β3, β2, β1, β4, β5, β6 (Fig. 4B). This β

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/69

sheet core is flanked by 7 α helices with a topological
arrangement of α0, α3, α4, α5 at one side of the β sheet
and α1 and α6 at the other side of the β sheet, and α7 at
the bottom. In contrast to UGT71G1, the human UGT1A1
does not appear to have the Cα2 helix. The last C-terminal
α helix (Nα7) is located at the bottom of the N-terminal
domain. The two loops between Nβ7 and Cα0 and
between Cα7 and Nα7 connect the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Fig. 4B).
Interactions between UGT proteins and the donor
substrate
The donor substrate UDPGA for vertebrate UGT enzymes
is predicted in our 3D model to bind in a long narrow
channel mainly in the C-terminal Rossmann-fold domain
(Fig. 4B and 4C). In particular, the donor sits in a groove
formed by the N-terminal half of the Cα3 and Cα4, and
the C-terminal half of the Cβ4 and Cβ5. In the modeled
donor-UGT1A1 complex, the uracil ring of UDPGA interacts with the side chain of R336 and the main chain of
L355 and Q357 through hydrogen bonds, and also forms
parallel stacking interaction with the indole ring of W354
of the human UGT1A1. The ribose ring of UDPGA interacts with the side chain of Q357, N358, and E380 through
hydrogen bonds. The α-phosphate forms hydrogen bonds
with the side chain of S38 and H372 and the main chain
of H376 and G377, while the β-phosphate interacts with
the side chain of S38 and H372 and the main chain of
S309 and G37. Finally, the glucuronic acid moiety interacts with the side chain and main chain of D396, the main
chain of S375, and the side chain of Q397 through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4C). Overall, the donor binding mode is
similar to that observed in the complex of donor substrates with the GtfB, GtfD, MurG, and UGT71G1 proteins
[43,45-47]. In addition, this model of the donor recognition is consistent with the crucial role of the human
UGT1A6 histidine, arginine, aspartic, and glutamic residues as demonstrated by chemical modification and sitedirected mutagenesis experiments [22].

The sequences of donor-binding region are highly conserved, especially for the donor-interacting residues. For
example, the residues interacting with UDPGA are identical among all vertebrate UGT1 proteins and are almost
identical among the UGT2 proteins (Fig. 5). In addition,
the residues located very close to UDPGA are also almost
identical among the UGT1 and UGT2 proteins (Fig. 5).
Previous studies have predicted that UDPGA binds to this
region of UGT proteins [22,49]. However, the D394 of
UGT1A6 (corresponding to the D396 of UGT1A1) were
predicted to interact with the uridyl moiety, an orientation different from the known GT-B donor complexes
[43,45-47] and our modeled donor-UGT1A1 interactions
(Fig. 4C).

The donor-binding region of vertebrate UGT proteins
The donor-binding region of vertebrate UGT proteins. Shown is an alignment of the donor-binding region of the human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, baboon, dog, cow, mouse, rat, opossum, chicken, frog, and zebrafish UGT1 constant polypeptides and
the corresponding donor-binding region of the human (h), mouse (m), and rat (r) UGT2A constant polypeptides and UGT2B
proteins. Residues predicted to interact with the donor UDPGA are highlighted in white letters with black background and
marked by red asterisks below. Residues close to the donor are highlighted with turquoise background and are also boxed.
Missense mutations in the UGT1A1 that cause human CN-I, CN-II, or Gilbert syndromes are indicated above the alignment.
For UGT1, constant polypeptides are shared by multiple UGT1A proteins in each species. For UGT2, individual protein
sequence is shown except h2a, m2a, and r2a, which are the human, mouse, and rat UGT2A constant polypeptides, respectively.

UGT proteins use UDPGA as a specific donor substrate
[20]. In our modeled UDPGA UGT1A1 complex, the side
chains of D396 and Q397 interact with the glucuronic
acid moiety. These two residues may play an important
role in the specific recognition of donor molecule by the
UGT proteins. Consistently, Q397 is conserved in all vertebrate UGT1 and UGT2 proteins (Fig. 5). Similarly, D396
is conserved in all vertebrate UGT1 proteins and all
human UGT2 proteins. It is also conserved in mouse and
rat UGT2 proteins with a few replaced by a glutamic residue.

Missense mutations of human UGT1A1 cause hyperbilirubinemia, including type I and II Crigler-Najjar syndromes (CN-I, OMIM no. 218800 and CN-II, OMIM no.
606785) and the Gilbert syndrome (OMIM no. 143500)
[20,28,30]. Point mutations with amino acid substitutions A292V (referred as A291V in [50]), G308E [50],
R336W [51], R336Q [52], Q357R [50], A368T [50], I370V
[53], S375F (referred as S376F in [54]), S381R [50],
P387R [55], P387S [52], G395V [52], or A401P [50] cause
the CN-I disease (Fig. 5). Moreover, the missense substitutions I294T [51], M310V [56], Q331R [57], R336L [52],

donor binding, thus abolishing or decreasing the
bilirubin glucuronidation activity of the human UGT1A1
protein and cause hyperbilirubinemia.

Molecular docking of bilirubin into the human UGT1A1 proMolecular docking of bilirubin into the human UGT1A1 protein. (A) Diagram of the bilirubin glucuronidation reaction
catalyzed by UGT1A1. (B) Stereo diagram showing positions
of the modeled substrates. The UGT1A1 is shown in a ribbon diagram with the secondary structure highlighted. The
donor UDP glucuronic acid (UDPGA) is shown as blue stick.
The two docked conformations of bilirubin are shown as red
and green sticks. (C) Stereo diagram showing bilirubin (red
conformation) docked into the acceptor-binding pocket of
UGT1A1. UDPGA (blue) and bilirubin (red) are shown as
lines. Some residues in the acceptor-binding pocket are
labeled and shown in cyan. Distances between the OH group
of the bilirubin porphyrin C propionate and the C1' atom of
the UDPGA or the NE2 atom of the residue histidine 39
(H39) (shown in pink), or between the NE2 atom of the residue H39 and the OD2 atom of the residue aspartic acid 151
(D151) (shown in pink) are indicated with dashed lines.
W354R [52], H376R (referred as H377R in [28]), G377V
[28], N400D [58] or R403C [52] cause the CN-II disease
(Fig. 5). Finally, point mutations of P364L [59], or R367G
[60,61] cause the Gilbert syndrome (Fig. 5). These mutations are in the positions of highly conserved residues
(with exception of only A292) in the donor-binding
region (Figs. 4 and 5). In particular, the residues G308,
M310, R336, W354, Q357, S375, H376, G377, S381,
G395, N400, and A401 are located very close to the donor
in the modeled 3D structure of human UGT1A1 protein

The UGT acceptor-binding site
Bilirubin is highly lipophilic, unexcretable, and neurotoxic, and is known to have a stable ridge-tile conformation [62]. The human UGT1A1 is the only UGT1 enzyme
for glucuronidating bilirubin acceptor substrate [31]. It
catalyzes the transfer of the glucuronic acid moiety from
UDPGA to the bilirubin C8 and C12 propionate groups
(Fig. 6A). In the modeled human UGT1A1 structure, there
is a deep kinked pocket adjacent to the donor-binding site
(Fig. 6B). This pocket is formed mostly by the N-terminal
domain. Specifically, the wall of the pocket is formed by
the N1 and N2 turns following the Nβ1 and Nβ2 strands,
the Nα3, Nα5b, Nα5, and Nα5a helices (Fig. 6B). The
floor of the pocket is formed by the Nβ5 strand and the
N4 turn following the Nβ4 strand (Fig. 6B). The location
of the pocket is similar to that of the substrate binding
sites observed in the complex of the GtfA or GtfD with
their corresponding acceptor substrates, and in the modeled acceptor-binding site of UGT71G1 [45-47]. Therefore, this pocket is likely the acceptor-binding site of the
human UGT1A1. The glucuronic acid moiety of the donor
in the modeled complex is oriented toward the middle of
this acceptor-binding pocket.

We modeled the bilirubin binding using the molecular
docking software GOLD [63]. The ridge-tile conformation
of bilirubin is docked into the hydrophobic pocket with
the ridge apposing the donor molecule in the C-terminal
domain, and the porphyrin ring A in the one end and the
porphyrin ring D in the other end of the N-terminal acceptor pocket (Fig. 6B). The propionate side groups are in the
middle and close to the glucuronic acid moiety of the
donor molecules. Consistent with two glucuronidation
sites in bilirubin through esterification of its two propionate side groups on the porphyrin rings B and C, there are
two conformations that the bilirubin docked in the acceptor pocket (Fig. 6B), with each propionate side group
docked close to the glucuronic acid moiety of the donor
and the highly conserved catalytic residue H39. There is a
small tilt between the two bilirubin docking conformations. The acceptor-binding pocket is much larger and
longer than bilirubin, and bilirubin can be fit easily into
the pocket with one of its two propionate OH groups
located at about 3 angstrom (Å) from the NE2 atom of the
H39 residue (Fig. 6C).
The acceptor-binding pocket of the human UGT1A1 is
surrounded by mostly hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal domain, including P34, V35, A64, L66, Y67, G71,
F92, V93, G96, V99, F100, F153, F170, L172, A174, L175,

Figure 7
The acceptor-binding region of vertebrate UGT proteins
The acceptor-binding region of vertebrate UGT proteins. Shown is an alignment of the acceptor-binding region of the human
UGT1 and UGT2 proteins. The diversity indexes (defined as KA/KS multiplied by 2) for the human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, baboon, dog, mouse, rat, chicken, and zebrafish UGT1 (d1) and the human, mouse, and rat UGT2 (d2) are also shown.
The four hypervariable regions (with exceptions of two cysteines) and several other highly diversified residues are highlighted
in orange background and are also boxed. A leucine residue (L41) close to the donor is highlighted in turquoise background.
Residues predicted to interact with the donor molecule are highlighted with white letters in black background. Missense mutations in the human UGT1A1 that cause CN-I, CN-II, or Gilbert syndromes are indicated above the alignment. The two catalytic residues histidine 39 (H39) and aspartic acid 151 (D151) are highlighted in red background and with asterisks below.

F181, F221, V225, and A231. Interestingly, most of these
hydrophobic residues are highly diversified among paralogous members of the vertebrate UGT proteins and are
located within four major hypervariable regions in the Nterminal domain (Fig. 7). These four hypervariable
regions form the wall and floor of the acceptor-binding
pocket in the N-terminal domain (Figs. 6B and 7). Analogous to the recognition of antigens by hypervariable
regions of the IG, TCR, and MHC proteins, we propose
that these hypervariable regions play an important role in

the recognition of numerous aglycone-acceptor substrates
by vertebrate UGT1 and UGT2 proteins.
Missense mutations of P34Q [52], H39D [28], W40R
[64], G71R [61], F83L [65], L131P (referred as L132P in
[61]), C156R [66], L175Q [67], C177R [67], C177Y [66],
Q185P [64], R209W [67,68], V225G (referred as V224G
in [28,69]), P229Q [60,61], and G276R [67] in human
UGT1A1 protein cause hyperbilirubinemia (Fig. 7). The
P34, H39, and W40 residues are located in the acceptorbinding pocket and are also close to the donor substrate

(Figs. 4, 6, and 7). The other mutated residues are mostly
located in the four major hypervariable regions that form
the acceptor-binding pocket. Therefore, these mutations
may interfere with the binding of bilirubin to human
UGT1A1 and abolish or decrease its bilirubin glucuronidating activity, consistent with the hyperbilirubinemia
phenotypes. Interestingly, the UGT1A1 G71R mutation is
almost exclusively found in Asians and has recently been
shown to associate with severe cancer drug (i.e. irinotecan) toxicity [27], consistent with the altered acceptor recognition.
Catalytic mechanism of vertebrate UGT glucuronidation
Vertebrate UGT proteins belong to the GT-B inverting glycosyltransferase supergene family (Fig. 4) [22,24]. However, little is known about their catalytic mechanisms. In
our modeled human UGT1A1 structure with the donor
UDPGA and acceptor bilirubin substrates, the NE2 atom
of the H39 residue lies in the middle of the potential
acceptor pocket and is close to both the OH group of the
bilirubin propionate side group (~3.32 Å) and the C1'
atom of UDPGA (~2.73 Å), suggesting a general SN2 catalytic mechanism for glucuronidation reactions (Fig. 6C).

We propose that the H39 of human UGT1A1 acts as a general base to abstract a proton from the OH group of the
bilirubin propionate, based on the crystal structures of
other GT-B enzymes [46,47]. A direct attack by the resulting nucleophilic oxyanion at the C1' atom of UDPGA
would then displace the UDP moiety. Consistent with the
essential role of H39, it is highly conserved in vertebrate
UGT proteins (Fig. 7). In addition, an H39D mutation in
human UGT1A1 gene causes CN-I disease [28], consistent
with the complete abolishment of the catalytic activity for
bilirubin glucuronidation (Fig. 7).
In the modeled human UGT1A1 structure, there is an
acidic D151 residue close to H39 that may form an electron transfer chain to help H39 deprotonate the OH
group of the acceptor molecule (Fig. 6C). This aspartic
acid residue is also highly conserved in vertebrate UGT
proteins in agreement with its essential role in catalysis
(Fig. 7). Thus, our modeled human UGT1A1 3D structure
is consistent with genetic mutation data and provides a
foundation for understanding the catalytic mechanism of
vertebrate glucuronidation.
Diversifying selection of vertebrate Ugt clusters
Enormous molecular diversity is required for the immune
and nervous system function. In the adaptive immune system, positive molecular selection operates to increase the
diversity of the Ig, Mhc, and Tcr genes [8,9,11,17,18,70].
In the CNS, adaptive molecular selection also operates to
enhance the diversity of the Pcdh and olfactory receptor
gene clusters [5,11,71]. Human UGT proteins glucuroni-

and among different vertebrate species.

date numerous endogenous substrates including steroids
and bile acids, as well as diverse xenobiotic chemicals
such as environmental carcinogens and therapeutic drugs
[20]. Gene duplication and birth-and-death evolution are
major sources of UGT diversity in the vertebrate evolution
(Fig. 1). We hypothesize that positive selection may be an
additional factor to enhance the diversity of vertebrate Ugt
genes.
We searched for positively selected sites in Ugt genes for
various vertebrate species using the maximum-likelihood
codeml program [72]. We ran three pairs of nested codeml
models on the human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey,
baboon, dog, mouse, rat, chicken, and zebrafish clusters a
and b Ugt1 genes, as well as the human, mouse, and rat
Ugt2 genes to infer positively selected codon sites. The
parameter estimates for the Ugt genes are shown in the
Additional file 15. The positively selected ω+ sites in each
repertoire are shown in the Additional file 16. Different
vertebrate species have overlapping but distinct ω+ site
profiles for the Ugt1 and Ugt2 genes, even between very
closely-related lineages such as mice and rats (Additional
file 16), suggesting that these Ugt genes in different species
are evolved through different chemical environments.
Based on the structural alignment in the Figure 4A, we
aligned the polypeptide sequence of UGT71G1 to those of
the human (Additional file 17), chimpanzee (Additional
file 18), rhesus monkey (Additional file 19), baboon
(Additional file 20), dog (Additional file 21), mouse
(Additional file 22), rat (Additional file 23), chicken
(Additional file 24), and zebrafish clusters A (Additional
file 25) and B (Additional file 26) UGT1 variable-exonencoded polypeptides, as well as the corresponding
human (Additional file 27), mouse (Additional file 28),
and rat (Additional file 29) UGT2 proteins. We then
mapped the positively-selected vertebrate UGT ω+ sites
onto the crystal structure of UGT71G1 [47] on the basis of
these alignments (Fig. 8). Interestingly, almost all positively selected sites are located within the four vertebrate
UGT hypervariable regions and map to the acceptor-binding pocket of the UGT71G1 crystal structure. Thus, these
residues may participate in the recognition of diverse
acceptor molecules by vertebrate UGT proteins. This
observation suggests that nature selection operates to
increase the diversity of vertebrate UGT proteins.
Evolution of multiple variable first exons and UGT
diversity
We showed that the variable and constant organizations
of Ugt1, Gcnt2, and Ugt2a clusters are vertebrate-specific
(Figs. 1 and 3, and Additional file 10). In addition, these
clusters are mainly subject to birth-and-death evolution
instead of concerted evolution because there is no prevalent gene conversion (Additional file 6). Finally, nature

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/69

selection at specific residues in four hypervariable regions
in the UGT acceptor-binding domain increases their diversity for binding numerous environmental agents (Fig. 8
and Additional files 15 and 16). Interestingly, a recent
human population genetic study found that diversified
coding sites are more likely to be polymorphic than conserved sites [29].
In the vertebrate CNS, birth-and-death evolution of Pcdh
variable exon arrays and positive selection on their specific ectodomain codons contribute to the staggering
diversity required for neuronal connectivity [3-7]. In the
vertebrate adaptive immune system, DNA rearrangement
of variable and constant gene segments in the Ig and Tcr
clusters, in conjunction with birth-and-death evolution
and positive selection, generate unlimited diversity.
Highly polymorphic Mhc genes also undergo birth-anddeath evolution and overdominant selection [11,19]. In
particular, positive selection at hypervariable regions or
CDRs of IG, TCR, and MHC proteins enhances their diversity for binding numerous antigens [8-10,17,18]. In the
vertebrate detoxification system, UGT proteins recognize
a myriad of hydrophobic aglycone molecules and each
UGT has distinct but broad overlapping substrate specificities [20,49]. Similar to the nervous and immune systems, two factors contribute to the diversity of UGT
proteins for defense against small chemicals. The duplication of Ugt1 variable exons and the entire Ugt2 genes
increases the number of distinct vertebrate UGT proteins
(Fig. 1 and Additional file 10). In addition, the diversified
residues in hypervariable regions through positive selection contribute to the binding specificity of each vertebrate UGT protein for a large set of distinct aglycones
(Figs. 7 and 8; Additional files 15 and 16). Thus, our
results reveal an intriguing similarity of diversification
mechanisms between vertebrate nervous, immune, and
chemical defense systems.

Conclusion
The ability of UGT enzymes to glucuronidate numerous
endobiotics and xenobiotics is conferred by their unusual
genomic organization and structure diversity. Each Ugt1
variable exon is preceded by a distinct promoter. A highly
conserved DNA motif located at about the same position
upstream from each variable exon is likely to play an
important role in regulating Ugt1 gene expression (Additional file 5). The combination of specific promoter activation and alternative cis-splicing of a variable exon to
constant exons determines their tissue-specific expression.
Comparative modeling of all UGT proteins suggests that
each has di-domain Rossmann folds with a hydrophobic
acceptor-binding pocket located within the N-terminal
domain. Maximum-likelihood analysis of nt substitution
patterns identified positively selected residues located in
four hypervariable regions of the N-terminal domain (Fig.

Page 14 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:69

7). Structural modeling suggests that these hypervariable
regions form the hydrophobic acceptor-binding pocket
(Fig. 6). Therefore, highly diversified residues in the
acceptor-binding pocket could enable different UGT1
proteins to have distinct glucuronidation profiles for a
large repertoire of environmental agents. Our comparative sequences analysis and homologous modeling shed
light on the evolution of multiple variable exons and provide a framework for future structural and biochemical
characterization of the vertebrate UGT proteins.

Methods
Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses
The vertebrate Ugt1 and Gcnt2, and mammalian Ugt2
genomic sequences were identified by iterative BLAST
searches of the GenBank databases. The finished
sequences were downloaded and analyzed as previously
described [1,5]. The human gene nomenclature was following the recommendation of the HUGO committee. To
ensure the accuracy, each nt was checked with the trace
files from the TraceDB by using the Sequencher program.
The sequences were analyzed for gene conversion by using
the Geneconv program with default parameters [41]. Similar to previous convention [4], only sequence elements
greater than 95 nt in length shared among paralogs are
shown. The variable Ugt1 and Gcnt2, and the full-length
Ugt2 coding sequences were translated and the resulting
polypeptides were aligned by using the GCG package. The
promoter motifs were identified by the Gibbs sampler
[73] and the graphic representations were generated by
the Weblogo [74]. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed
by using the neighbor-joining algorithm in the ClustalW
package. Gaps in the alignment were treated as missing
during the tree construction. The robustness of the tree
partitions was evaluated by bootstrap analyses.
Homologous modeling of UGT structures and molecular
docking of substrates
We predicted the UGT1A1 secondary structure profile by
using the neural network programs PSIPRED [75] and
NNPREDICT [76], and aligned it to the structural alignment of known bacterial and plant GT-B crystal structures
by using hidden Markov models (HMM) with manual
adjustments [77]. We then modeled the structure of the
human UGT1A1 by using the SWISS-MODEL [78]. The
stereochemical quality of the structural model was evaluated with ANOLEA atomic mean force potential [79],
GROMOS empirical force field energy, Verify3D profile
[80], and the PROCHECK [81] programs. The modeled
human UGT1A1 structure was refined by iterative modeling until there is no major difference in the active site
between structural assessments of the model and the template [35]. In the final optimized UGT1A1 structure, dihedral angles of 331 residues were located in most favored
regions of the Ramachandran plot, 53 residues in additional allowed regions, and 8 residues in generously

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/69

allowed regions. We also modeled each of the 19 members of the human UGT1 and UGT2 families.
We modeled the UDPGA and bilirubin binding of
UGT1A1 by using the molecular docking program GOLD
(Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking) [63] with
default genetic algorithm parameters. The set up of the
human UGT1A1 protein was according to the GOLD program manual. The UDPGA and bilirubin were downloaded from the PubChem Compound database. The
UDPGA binding was modeled according to the cocrystal
structure of UGT71G1 with the donor substrate. The
bilirubin binding was modeled by seeding the atom NE2
of the residue H39 with a radius of 10 Å. GOLDscore was
used to identify the lowest energy docking results. The
hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between
ligands and UGT1A1 were analyzed to identify the optimal binding mode. The four hypervariable regions in the
acceptor-binding domain were identified by multiple
sequence alignment of all 91 vertebrate UGT1 variable
polypeptides and the corresponding regions of 35 UGT2
proteins in conjunction with analyzing patterns of nt substitutions by the codeml program (see below).
Site-specific KA/KS analysis
We used the maximum-likelihood codeml program of the
PAML package (v3.15) [72] to predict codon sites under
positive selection. The estimation of positively selected
sites was performed as previously described [5]. Briefly, a
set of 91 vertebrate Ugt1 variable exon sequences was
translated and the resulting polypeptides were aligned
with the N-terminal signal peptide removed. For the
mammalian Ugt2 genes, a set of 31 full-length Ugt2 was
aligned with both the N-terminal signal peptide and Cterminal transmembrane segment removed. The corresponding nt alignment was built by using RevTrans and
separated into 10 Ugt1 (human, chimpanzee, rhesus
monkey, baboon, dog, mouse, rat, chicken, and zebrafish
clusters a and b) and 3 Ugt2 (human, mouse, and rat)
groups. For each of these 13 groups, we first ran the model
M0 of the codeml program with a nt neighbor-joining tree
to obtain a KS-derived tree. By definition, the branches of
the KS tree are about three times longer than those of the
nt tree. However, almost all of the KS values are <1, suggesting that synonymous substitutions are not saturated
among these UGT paralogs. We then used this tree to run
three nested pairs of codeml random-sites models: M0 vs.
M3; M1a vs. M2a; and M7 vs. M8. Because iterative estimations of ω values by both M2a and M8 are susceptible
to local optima, we ran these models with three different
initial ω values (0.03, 0.8, and 3.14) and presented only
those results with the highest likelihood. We mapped the
positively selected ω+ sites to the crystal structure of
UGT71G1 (PDB accession code 2acv). The ω+ sites were
defined as diversified residues estimated to be under positive selection with a posterior probability of >0.9 by one

codeml model (M2a, M3, or M8), and >0.5 by at least one
other model [5,71].
