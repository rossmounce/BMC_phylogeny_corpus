Abstract
Background: Oxidative phosphorylation is central to the energy metabolism of the cell. Due to
adaptation to different life-styles and environments, fungal species have shaped their respiratory
pathways in the course of evolution. To identify the main mechanisms behind the evolution of
respiratory pathways, we conducted a phylogenomics survey of oxidative phosphorylation
components in the genomes of sixty fungal species.
Results: Besides clarifying orthology and paralogy relationships among respiratory proteins, our
results reveal three parallel losses of the entire complex I, two of which are coupled to duplications
in alternative dehydrogenases. Duplications in respiratory proteins have been common, affecting
76% of the protein families surveyed. We detect several instances of paralogs of genes coding for
subunits of respiratory complexes that have been recruited to other multi-protein complexes
inside and outside the mitochondrion, emphasizing the role of evolutionary tinkering.
Conclusions: Processes of gene loss and gene duplication followed by functional divergence have
been rampant in the evolution of fungal respiration. Overall, the core proteins of the respiratory
pathways are conserved in most lineages, with major changes affecting the lineages of
microsporidia, Schizosaccaromyces and Saccharomyces/Kluyveromyces due to adaptation to anaerobic
life-styles. We did not observe specific adaptations of the respiratory metabolism common to all
pathogenic species.

Background
Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the primary
energy-producing pathway in aerobic organisms [1]. It
functions by coupling the energy obtained from the oxidation of certain metabolic substrates to the phosphorylation of adenosine biphosphate (ADP) to produce ATP.
This is achieved by a process of electronic transference
through an intricate assembly of more than 20 discrete
carriers. These carriers are mainly grouped into four membrane-embedded protein complexes, named Complex I

through Complex IV, which form the electron transport
chain (ETC). Some of the complexes in this chain are able
to use the energy liberated by the electron transfer to the
pumping of protons across the membrane, thereby generating a proton gradient. Finally, the energy obtained from
the dissipation of this gradient is used by a fifth protein
complex, ATP-synthase or Complex V, to synthesize ATP.
In eukaryotes, the oxidative phosphorylation machinery
resides in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.

Molecular phylogenies of eukaryotic OXPHOS components indicate that the core subunits of the complexes
were inherited from the alpha-proteobacterial ancestor of
mitochondria [2,3]. In contrast, other subunits might
have different origins and show complex phylogenetic
distributions [4]. Besides providing important information on how complex systems evolve, knowledge about
lineage-specific variations may serve to identify novel
components or interactions. For instance, the evolutionary analysis of Complex I across a set of eighteen eukaryotes, lead to the prediction that the so-far uncharacterised
human protein B17L was involved in Complex I function
[4]. This protein was later found to be participating as a
chaperone in Complex I assembly and a mutation in this
gene was identified in patients showing severe encephalopathy [5].
Fungi is the group of eukaryotic organisms that is best
sampled in terms of fully sequenced genomes [6,7]. The
adaptation of this kingdom to a diversity of environments
is reflected in a high metabolic variability that also affects
the respiratory pathway [3,8]. Indeed, the adaptation to
oxygen-limited conditions or to high levels of oxidative
stress during certain phases of their life cycle may have
been crucial in the emergence of fermentative or pathogenic lifestyles. A recent comparative genomics study [9]
has provided a comprehensive view of the patterns of
presence and absence of OXPHOS components in 27 fungal species. Here we extend the analyses to 60 fullysequenced fungal genomes and use a phylogenetics
approach that enables us not only to obtain reliable
orthology relationships but also to trace the history of
duplications of OXPHOS components and related pathways during fungal evolution. In particular, we wanted to
assess the role that gene duplication and functional divergence has played in the evolution of this pathway. A prediction of the gene-balance hypothesis is that
independent duplications of protein complexes are likely
to have deleterious effects [10], thereby constraining this
mode of evolution in a pathway that is mostly composed
of large complexes. Moreover, we wanted to test whether
some loss or duplications of OXPHOS components could
be associated to specific phenotypes such as virulence or
adaptation to anaerobic environments. Altogether, our
results show a relatively high rate of duplication events
that affect 76% of the protein families surveyed. Interestingly, some of these duplications have been directly followed by processes of functional divergence, sometimes
involving the recruitment of one of the duplicates to other
multi-protein complexes.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenomic profiling of the OXPHOS pathway
Sequences of fungal proteins annotated as OXPHOS components were retrieved from the KEGG database [11] and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/295

used as queries for blastp searches against the proteins
encoded in 60 fully-sequenced fungal genomes (see figure
1 and Methods section). A phylogenetic analysis was performed on each set of homologous proteins to derive a
phylogenetic tree. This tree was used to establish orthology and paralogy relationships using a species-overlap
algorithm that has been described earlier [12]. This phylogeny-based approach to orthology detection, approaches
more closely the original definition of orthology and
reflects more appropriately the complex evolutionary relationships within protein families [13,14]. The presence of
the different components of the respiratory pathway in
the species surveyed is summarized in figures 2, 3 and 4.
Overall, our results agree with those reported by Lavin et.
al in the 27 species that both surveys have in common [9].
That the two approaches render so similar results, indicates that, despite using different approaches both methods have a similar stringency in the detection of OXPHOS
components in this taxonomic range. In addition, our
study extends the information on the distribution of components of the respiratory pathway to 33 additional species. The main advantage of our approach, however, is
more qualitative than quantitative. By performing phylogenetic analyses on every protein family, we can readily
obtain information on duplication events affecting components of the respiratory pathway, an important evolutionary process that was ignored in the previous study.
Recognizing gene duplications is important, since this
process is considered one of the main processes that drive
functional innovation [15]. Our study reveals that duplication events have affected the OXPHOS pathway extensively. Overall, we detect duplications in 76% of the
families surveyed. These results were similar (duplications
in 75% of the families surveyed), when more stringent
cut-offs for homology detection were applied (see figures
S1, S2 and S3 in the additional file 1). Such high proportion of duplications is not the result of errors in the annotation or assembly of the genomes. We controlled for this
by inspecting manually every duplication case to discard
dubious cases. Moreover, even when species-specific
duplications in which duplicates had more than 95%
identity at the nucleotide level or all duplications from the
recently assembled genomes Postia placenta and Puccina
graminis were not taken into account, the fraction of
OXPHOS families with a duplication event remained high
(71% and 74%, respectively). Zygomycota, in particular,
present the highest proportion of duplicated proteins in
the OXPHOS pathway. For instance, we found duplications in 60% of the genes involved in Rhizopus oryzae
OXPHOS pathway. A large percentage of these duplications (82%) can be mapped specifically to the R. oryzae
lineage or to the lineage preceding the separation of R.
oryzae and Phycomyces blakesleeanus and thus are specific of
Zygomycota species. This large amount of lineage specific
duplications seems to be general in R. oryzae and P. blake-

sleeanus (unpublished observation from our group). An
interesting possibility is that the ancestors of these organisms underwent a Whole Genome Duplication (WGD)
event, similar to that described for Saccharomyces [16].
This possibility has recently been confirmed for R. oryzae
[17], in a comprehensive study that catalogues duplicated
regions where the gene order is conserved. Consistently
with our results, a duplication of nearly all subunits of the
protein complexes associated with respiratory electron
transport chains is detected, although our phylogenybased approach detects additional, more ancestral, duplications that are not associated to the WGD event.
Complete loss of the OXPHOS pathway in microsporidia
and two additional independent losses of Complex I
coupled with alternative dehydrogenase expansions in
Schizosaccharomyces and Saccharomycetales
Our results confirm earlier findings of a complete loss of
the OXPHOS pathway in microsporidia [18] and the
absence of most components of Complex I in Schizosaccharomyces and Saccharomycetales [4]. We are able to find
most of the subunits of complex I in the Taphrinomycotina species Pneumocystis carinii, suggesting that the
event of gene loss occurred after the diversification of
Pneumocystis and Schizosaccharomyces lineages. The apparent multiple absences of Complex I subunits, and those of
other complexes, in P. carinii is probably related to a low
coverage of the genome sequence for this organism. Similarly, the presence of a complete repertoire of Complex I
subunits in all species in the Candida cluster and the lack
of this complex in all surveyed species from the Saccharomyces/Kluyveromyces clade, situates the loss of Complex I
in the latter lineage. Remarkably, the two independent
losses of Complex I in the Taphrinomycotina and Saccharomyces/Kluyveromyces clades are concomitant with independent expansions of their alternative NADH
dehydrogenases repertoire by virtue of gene duplications.
Alternative NADH dehydrogenases bypass Complex I
electron transport, oxidizing NADH without pumping of
protons. The duplication of alternative NADH dehydrogenases (Figure 5) might have provided a selective advantage for yeast species using predominantly fermentative
metabolism, due to adaptation to anaerobic environments. Excess of NADH causes a problem under fermentative anaerobic growth, since it prevents further
oxidation of substrates due to a lack of a sufficient NAD+
pool to accept electrons. Thus, the diversification of pathways to further oxidize NADH would have been beneficial
in such conditions. The loss of Complex I in the same evolutionary periods might also be related to adaptation to
fermentative growth. It is unclear which of the processes
preceded the other or whether both processes were concomitant. A higher taxon sampling within the Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina might help to solve this
issue in the future. Also coupled with Complex I loss, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/295

in line with adaptations to anaerobic environments in the
abovementioned lineages, we observe the loss of alternative oxidases.
Duplications in Alternative Oxidases are not necessarily
coupled with a pathogenic life-style
Alternative oxidases catalyze the cyanide-resistant alternative pathway of mitochondrial respiration in some fungi,
plants and several protists. This pathway directly transfers
electrons from the ubiquinone pool to oxygen, thereby
bypassing complex III and cytochrome c oxidase [19].
Alternative oxidases are common in yeasts but limited
almost exclusively to non-fermentative and crabtree-negative yeasts. Alternative oxidases participate in energy production but also in antioxidant defense of cells. It has
been shown that alternative oxidases represent an important factor for the survival of pathogenic fungi inside macrophages [20]. Considering this, it could be postulated
that the duplication of these enzymes might have played
a role in the emergence of pathogenesis in several mammal fungal pathogens. In our survey we detect several copies of alternative oxidases in 13 species. Some of these
duplications seem to have occurred quite recently in their
respective lineages, such as the duplication that lead to
AOX1 and AOX2 (orf19.4774 and orf19.4773 in C. albicans) involving some Candida species, which can be
mapped before the speciation of C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis and C. albicans. Although many of these duplications
do affect pathogenic genera such as Candida and Aspergillus, there are notable exceptions such as the intra-specific
duplications found in the generally non-pathogenic species Yarrowia lypolytica or Coprinus cinereus. Conversely, we
find pathogenic species such as Histoplasma capsulatum or
Cryptococcus neoformans that have been shown to survive
in macrophages [21] and nevertheless present a single
alternative oxidase. Taken all together, our results suggest
that a single copy of alternative oxidase gene is sufficient
to protect fungal pathogens against macrophages and
rather points to alternative selective advantages for the
duplication of this gene. Conversely, alternative adaptations might be behind the emergence of the ability to survive inside macrophages in certain lineages. For instance,
the presence of a polysaccharide capsule in Cryptococcus
has been shown to confer resistance to oxidative stress
[22].
Extensive duplication followed by functional divergence in
the fungal OXPHOS pathway
According to the gene balance hypothesis [10], the duplication of genes that encode for subunits of multi-protein
complexes should have a higher chance of being deleterious due to dosage effects. As a result, one would expect to
find few duplication events in the OXPHOS system, as
this is mainly formed by intricate complexes. Contrary to
that expectation, we find numerous cases of duplications

in OXPHOS proteins, which overall affect 66 (76%) of the
proteins surveyed. These have occurred at different
moments in fungal evolution. At least for the genes duplicated during the Whole Genome Duplication event
(WGD) occurred in the yeast lineage about 80 Myr ago,
the rate of gene loss of duplicated OXPHOS genes is not
higher than the overall rate for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Indeed, our study finds six yeast proteins (all complex II
subunits, Qcr6p and Cox5p), whose duplication is
mapped to the WGD event. These represent 7% of the
OXPHOS proteins, meaning that for 93% of the nuclear
OXPHOS proteins supposedly duplicated in WGD were
subsequently lost, a rate of gene loss that is roughly similar to the 88% estimated for the whole S. cerevisiae
genome [16]. It must be noted that one of the duplications affected the whole Complex II, meaning that the
duplication was conservative in terms of stoichiometry of
the different subunits. However, one of the duplicated
subunits has been subsequently lost in the Saccharomyces
sensu stricto species, suggesting the four duplicates do not
form an alternative complex II. A possible reconciliation
between the extensive rate of gene duplications and the
gene balance hypothesis is that functional divergence
directly followed the duplication event, thereby facilitating the retention of both duplicates [23]. Differences in
the expression patterns of some of the WGD duplicates,
point to a functional specialization of each duplicate. For
instance, Cox5 (YNL052W) is expressed during aerobic
growth whereas its paralog (YIL111W) is expressed under
anaerobic growth [24]. Similarly, the duplicate of the
SDHA complex II subunit (YJL045W) is specifically
expressed during the diauxic shift. Several other observations suggest that functional divergence processes have
been common after duplication of OXPHOS protein families (see below).
Evolutionary cross-talk between the OXPHOS complexes
and other multi-protein complexes
Several instances of paralogy relationships between complex I subunits and other mitochondrial multi-protein
complexes have been previously reported [4]. This is the
case for the NDUFA11 subunit, which is paralogous to the
Tim17/22 family as well as that of NI8M (NDUFA2) and
NUZM, which are paralogous to L43 and L2 subunits of
the mitochondrial ribosome. It has been suggested that
OXPHOS proteins with paralogs in other complexes
would play a structural role rather than being involved in
proton or electron transport, since ribosomes and the
import machinery do not display those functions [4].
Similarly, we find several instances of paralogs of
OXPHOS subunits that play a role in other complexes.
Interestingly, another evolutionary connection between
OXPHOS and the mitochondrial import machinery
(MIM) is evidenced by the fact that the MIM subunit
TIM18 (YOR297C) is a paralog of the Complex II subunit

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/295

SDHD (YDR178W). Yet another paralog of the same
Complex II subunit, which originated from a more recent
duplication in the Saccharomycotina lineage (YLR164W)
encodes for a mitochondrial inner membrane protein of
yet unknown function. Paralogies to the protein import
system in the mitochondrion extend to the two subunits
of the Mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), an
essential processing enzyme that cleaves the N-terminal
targeting sequences from mitochondrially imported proteins [25]. Indeed the large and small subunits MAS1
(YLR163C) and MAS2 (YHR024C) are homologous to
QCR1 (YBL045C) and QCR2 (YPR191W) subunits of
Complex III. Paralogy relationships to other multi-protein
complexes extend beyond mitochondria. Indeed, several
paralogs of Complex V subunits have been described as
components of complexes from other cell compartments.
For instance, the alpha and beta subunits of the F1 sector
of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (YBL099W, YJR121W)
are paralogous to the A and B subunits of the vacuolar ATP
synthase (YDL185W, YBR127C). Vacuolar ATP synthases
are found in the membranes of a large number of
organelles which include endosomes, lysosomes and
secretory vesicles. This duplication, however is not specific
to fungi, since both paralogous groups have representatives in Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens (see phylogenetic trees additional file 1: figure S4), which indicates
that the duplication preceded the diversification of plants
and opisthokonts.
Yeast ACPM is possibly not a complex I remnant but a
Saccharomycotina-specific paralog of complex I Acylcarrier protein
Although previously identified as a remnant Complex I
subunit in the Complex I devoid organism S. cerevisiae [4],
our current phylogenomic analysis suggest that this protein might actually be a paralog originated from an
ancient duplication that is specifically conserved in Saccharomycotina (Figure 6). This paralogy relationship is
supported by approximate Likelihood Ratio Tests (aLRT)
analyses of the duplication node (0.79, shown in the figure) as well as by bootstrap analyses (74% bootstrap support, not shown in the figure). This finding clarifies
apparent inconsistencies in the function of Complex I
acyl-carrier protein and the isolated ACPM protein
(YKL192C). Indeed S. cerevisiae ACPM protein has been
found to participate in the synthesis of octanoic acid, a
precursor of lipoic acid [26], whereas the acyl carrier Complex I subunit in Neurospora crassa seems not to participate
in this process [27]. The fact that a mammalian homolog
of this protein family has also been identified as a Complex I subunit in bovine mitochondria [28], suggests that
association with Complex I is an ancestral feature of the
family. Taken together, these results indicate that a process of functional divergence might have occurred after the
duplication event diverting the new duplicate for special-

izing in the synthesis of octanoid acid. This specialization
is presumably present in all Saccharomycotina species
including the Candida group, which additionally possesses the true acyl carrier Complex I subunit.

Conclusions
Altogether our results shed light on how processes of gene
loss, duplication and functional divergence have shaped
the core of the respiratory pathway in fungi. Although
most fungal organisms present a similar overall composition in terms of respiratory complexes, extensive differences in what particular units have been lost or duplicated
in each complex, might help explaining differences found
at the physiological level. This continuous evolution of
OXPHOS components seems to be common in other
groups of organisms [4,29,30], emphasizing the plasticity
of this central energetic pathway.

Methods
Sequence data
Proteins encoded in 60 fully-sequenced fungal genomes
were downloaded from several databases (figure 1). For
consistency, we used in our analysis the species names as
provided by the database source. Some of these species
have been renamed and the corresponding new names
and synonyms are listed in the additional file 1 (Additional table S1). Additionally, genomes from Homo sapiens
and Arabidopsis thaliana were downloaded from ensembl
http://www.ensembl.org. The final database comprises
626,834 unique protein sequences.
Reconstruction of the presence/absence matrix
Fungal proteins annotated as being part of the OXPHOS
pathway were downloaded from the KEGG database
(map 00190) [31]. In addition, 6 proteins that were identified in the literature as belonging to complex I but were
not present in the KEGG database were downloaded from
UniProt and included in the analyses (NI9M, NURM,
NUWM, NUXM and NUZM). The resulting 85 proteins
were used to perform a blast search against a database of
fungal proteins encoded in 60 fungal genomes (figure 1).
Low complexity filters were used in the blast search. To
detect homology, we used the same parameters that have
been used previously in the same taxonomic range [7]. In
brief, only significant hits (E-val < 10-3) that aligned with
a continuous region covering more than one third of the
query sequence were selected. Note that the use of low
complexity filters in the blast can reduce significantly the
length of continuous regions of homology. Sets of homologous sequences were aligned and used to reconstruct a
Maximum Likelihood tree from which orthology relationships were inferred (see below). These orthology relationships were used to build a presence/absence matrix
(figures 2, 3 and 4) in which for each OXPHOS compo-

nent the species with a corresponding ortholog are indicated. Putative absences in the matrix were doublechecked by tBlastN [32] searches against the corresponding genome sequence and Blast searches from family
members of more related species. These hits were checked
manually and whenever they were considered orthologous to the already identified members they were added
to the list.
Phylogenetic analyses
We used a similar pipeline to that described in [33]. Sets
of homologous proteins were aligned using MUSCLE 3.6
[34] with default parameters. Positions in the alignment
with gaps in more than 10% of the sequences were
trimmed with trimAl [35]. Finally, PhyML aLRT version
[36,37] was used to derive Maximum Likelihood (ML)
trees. Four different evolutionary models were used for
each seed sequence (JTT, WAG, Blosum62 and VT). In all
cases, a discrete gamma-distribution model with four rate
categories plus invariant positions was used, estimating
the gamma parameter and the fraction of invariant positions from the data. The evolutionary model best fitting
the data was determined by comparing the likelihood of
the used models according to the AIC criterion [38].
Orthology and paralogy relationships among members of
a family were inferred from the analysis of their corresponding phylogenetic trees, using a previously described
algorithm that has been described before and has been
shown to be accurate [7,12]. Phylogeny-based methods
are considered to better reflect the actual complexity of
orthology relationships than pair-wise methods such as
best-bidirectional hits [14]. All phylogenetic trees are provided in the additional file 1: figure S4 as well as a list of
proteins used as a seed in our analyses (Additional file 1:
table S2). All duplications where manually checked to discard possible cases of spurious duplications. This was
done by manually inspecting the alignments and the
nucleotide sequences of the relevant duplicates. Moreover, the corresponding genome browsers or assembly data
were searched to analyze the sequence context of the
duplicates. Highly similar sequences in which one is only
partially sequenced or in a small contig can be taken as
possible source of errors. These cases were discarded. Total
counts of duplications were also computed discarding the
fraction of duplications that is expected to be more sensitive to error annotation: lineage-specific duplications with
highly similar duplicates and duplications found in
recently assembled genomes (see main text).
