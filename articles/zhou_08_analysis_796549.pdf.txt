Abstract
Background: achaete-scute complexe (AS-C) has been widely studied at genetic, developmental
and evolutional levels. Genes of this family encode proteins containing a highly conserved bHLH
domain, which take part in the regulation of the development of central nervous system and
peripheral nervous system. Many AS-C homologs have been isolated from various vertebrates and
invertebrates. Also, AS-C genes are duplicated during the evolution of Diptera. Functions besides
neural development controlling have also been found in Drosophila AS-C genes.
Results: We cloned four achaete-scute homologs (ASH) from the lepidopteran model organism
Bombyx mori, including three proneural genes and one neural precursor gene. Proteins encoded by
them contained the characteristic bHLH domain and the three proneural ones were also found to
have the C-terminal conserved motif. These genes regulated promoter activity through the Class
A E-boxes in vitro. Though both Bm-ASH and Drosophila AS-C have four members, they are not in
one by one corresponding relationships. Results of RT-PCR and real-time PCR showed that BmASH genes were expressed in different larval tissues, and had well-regulated expressional profiles
during the development of embryo and wing/wing disc.
Conclusion: There are four achaete-scute homologs in Bombyx mori, the second insect having four
AS-C genes so far, and these genes have multiple functions in silkworm life cycle. AS-C gene
duplication in insects occurs after or parallel to, but not before the taxonomic order formation
during evolution.

Background
Transcriptional factors of the bHLH (basic helix-loophelix) family play important roles in the development of
metazoan, taking part in the regulation of neurogenesis,
myogenesis, haemopoiesis and so on [1-5]. The achaete-

scute complex (AS-C), a group of four bHLH genes, has
been found to be involved in the determination of Drosophila neural precursors [6-9].

AS-C proteins interact with another bHLH protein Daughterless (Da) to form a dimer, and bind Class A E-boxes
CAGG/CTG [10]. AS-C/Da heterodimers' binding sites
were found in the upstream regions of hunchback (hb) [10]
and phyllopod (phyl) [11]. In Drosophila, they were also
found in the upstream region of ac itself, and required for
auto- and cross-regulation by ac and sc [12].
The main functions of AS-C genes are regulating the formation and patterning of precursors of central nervous
system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). During neural development, AS-C genes are expressed in one
or more cells within the proneural clusters, which are
committed to the neural precursor fate, and the remaining
cells in the cluster differentiate to be epidermal cells or are
eliminated by apoptosis [8,13,14]. Tribolium castaneum
ASH (Tc-ASH) and Hydra vulgaris cnidarian ASH (Cn-ASH)
show similar functions during the formation of sensory
organs in the transgenic Drosophila [15,16]. Also, it was
found that Cn-ASH protein formed heterodimers with
Drosophila Da (Dm-Da) protein in vitro, and these dimers
specially bound to the consensus E-boxes [15]. Besides
regulation of neurogenesis, AS-C genes have other functions. ac takes part in the development of Malpighian
tubule by expressing in the tip cell and regulating the
sequential fates of the organ [17]. sc regulates sex determination by its different expression dosage between females
and males, but neither ac nor l'sc can substitute for sc in
this function [18-20]. l'sc expression is necessary for muscle founder cells segregating from the somatic mesoderm.
Loss of expression of l'sc leads to a loss, whereas over
expression causes a duplication of muscles and founder
cells [21].
According to the sequence and functional analysis in different species, AS-C genes are conserved during evolution.
The four genes of Drosophila AS-C are achaete (ac), scute
(sc), lethal of scute (l'sc) and asense (ase). The former three
are defined as proneural genes and the last one as neural
precursor gene, basing on their expression patterns and
functions in proneural clusters. AS-C homologs have been
isolated from various invertebrates and vertebrates
[15,16,22-34]. They all have a conserved bHLH domain
and some of them also have a conserved C-terminal motif.
Gene duplication events caused a dramatic increase of ASC gene number during Arthropoda evolution [16,30].
Within Insecta, AS-C homologs have been studied in Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), Hymenoptera (bees), Coleoptera (the red flour beetle) and Lepidoptera (the butterfly
P. coenia). Each of the insects has one ase-like gene. Most
of them have only one proneural gene, while the medfly
Ceratitis capitata has two, and the fruit fly has three. The
four genes in Drosophila were believed to have arisen from
a single ancestral gene by three independent duplication
events [16,30]. AS-C homologs in the insects studied are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/24

closely linked in the chromosome, for example, the four
AS-C genes comprising about 100 Kb in Drosophila, and
the two residing about 22 Kb apart in Anopheles, about 55
Kb apart in Tribolium, and about 40 Kb apart in Apis
[16,34].
The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a model organism of Lepidoptera. With the completion of silkworm genomic
sequencing project [35], Bombyx mori is emerging as an
important model lepidopteran. Only one AS-C homolog
had been isolated from lepidopteran in previous studies
[26]. In the present study, we found there were four AS-C
homologs in silkworm, three proneural genes and an aselike one. We detected the transcriptional activity of the
genes by transient expression in Bm-N cells. Expression
profiles of the genes in different tissues and expression
changes during the development course of silkworm
embryo and wing disc/wing were also studied.

Results
Isolation and identification of achaete-scute homologs in
Bombyx mori
It is well known that each achaete-scute homolog has a
highly conserved bHLH domain which distinguishes
them from other bHLH proteins. Using the amino acid
sequence of Drosophila Ac (Genbank: AAF45498) to blast
the silkworm EST database (see Materials and Methods
section), we obtained an EST sequence (GenBank:
CK537057) encoding a conserved AS-C bHLH domain.
Primers were designed based on the EST sequence, and
RACE assay was carried out using the midgut total RNA of
3d 5th instar larva as the template. After sequencing and
assembling, we gained a cDNA of 1,332 bp and named it
Bm-ASH1 (Genbank: DQ350889). Bm-ASH1 gene contains a 582 bp ORF region (including the stop codon) and
encodes a 193 aa protein.

Then we screened the Bombyx mori genome database using
the 193 aa Bm-ASH1 protein sequence, and found genes
with conserved AS-C bHLH region in four more contigs
AADK01036667,
(Genbank:
AADK01030307,
AADK01011379 and BAAB01105243), besides the two
(Genbank: AADK01005140 and BAAB01089921) corresponding to Bm-ASH1. BAAB01105243 is part of
AADK01011379. Each of them contained a deduced ORF
region, and then we cloned the ORF regions by RT-PCR
methods and they were sequenced. Primers for 3'-RACE
were designed basing on the sequences of the ORF
regions, and 3'-RACE assay was processed using the total
RNA from 1 d pupal wing as the template. The segments
gained by 3'-RACE were sequenced and assembled with
each corresponding ORF sequence. The final cDNA
sequences were 1,449 bp, 990 bp and 1,695 bp long, and
were named Bm-ASH2 (Genbank: EF620927), Bm-ASH3
(Genbank: EF620928) and Bm-ase (Genbank: EF620929)

respectively. Bm-ASH2 gene contained a 720 bp OFR
region (including the stop codon) and encoded a 239 aa
protein, Bm-ASH3 gene contained a 726 bp OFR region
(including the stop codon) and encoded a 241 aa protein,
and Bm-ase gene contained a 1,215 bp OFR region
(including the stop codon) and encoded a 404 aa protein.
Alignment results with Drosophila AS-C proteins showed
that all four proteins encoded by Bm-ASH genes contained the AS-C characteristic one basic and two helix
domains flanking a non-conserved loop domain (Fig. 1).
Bm-ASH1, Bm-ASH2 and Bm-ASH3 also had the C-terminal 16–17 aa conserved motif, but Bm-Ase did not. There

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/24

was a highly conserved short motif (SPxxS, x means uncertain acid amino) around the region of PEST domain [3638]. In the bHLH region, Bm-ASH1 shares 74.6%, BmASH2 shares 72.1% and Bm-ASH3 shares 72.1% amino
acid identity with Dm-L'sc, and Bm-Ase shares 74.3%
with Dm-Ase (Table 1). The data above indicate that BmASH1, Bm-ASH2 and Bm-ASH3 are proneural genes and
Bm-ase an asense homolog.
We compared the sequences of ASH proteins from silkworm and some other insects, and found that either at
whole amino acids level or within the bHLH region, BmASH1 had a higher identity with non-lepidopteran insects'

proteins contain the AS-C characteristic one basic and two helix domains flanking a non-conserved loop domain, and a conserved C-terminal 16–17 aa motif also exists in each of the proneural genes but neither of the asense genes. Moreover, a conserved short motif SPxxS is also found in all of the investigated proteins. Amino acids that are similar in 100% of aligned
sequences are shaded blue, in more than 80% but less than 100% with pink, and in more than 60% but less than 80% with darkgreen.

ASH proteins than the other two Bombyx proneural proteins, Bm-ASH2 and Bm-ASH3 (Table 1). Among the silkworm ASH proteins, Bm-ASH2 and Bm-ASH3 are most
identical, showing 91.3% identity within the bHLH
region. It is surprising that Bm-ASH2 and butterfly Achaete-scute homolog1 (B-ASH1) [26] are the same within
the bHLH region and share 90.3% identity at the whole
amino acid level. Bm-Ase shares more than 70% identities
with all of the other insect Asense proteins within the
bHLH region. In phylogenetic analysis, proneural proteins and Asense proteins were grouped into two separate
clades (Fig. 2). In the proneural clade, Bm-ASH1, Dm-L'sc,
Ag-ASH, Am-ASH, and Tc-ASH were grouped into one
sub-clade, paralleling the other two sub-clades, one comprised of Dm-Ac and Dm-Sc and the other comprised of
Bm-ASH1, Bm-ASH2 and B-ASH1.
The Bombyx ASH genes could not be assembled into a
complex based on current data
cDNA sequence of each Bombyx ASH gene was used to
blast the silkworm knowledgebase [39], and four separate
scaffolds were screened out. The total length of the scaffolds is about 122 Kb (but we could not assemble them
into one complex with the present data). Analysis results
showed that there was an intron outside of the ORF region
in Bm-ASH1 and Bm-ASH2, however there was no intron
in either Bm-ASH3 or Bm-ase (Fig. 3).

Bm-ASH genes regulating promoter activity via E-box in
Bm-N cells
AS-C genes have self-regulating functions by E-boxes in
their promoter regions [12]. We cloned a 1,178 bp DNA
fragment upstream of the ORF region of the Bm-ASH2
gene. At positions 188–194 bp and 791–797 bp upstream
of ATG codon, there are two Class A E-boxes (CAGG/
CTG). The promoter segments were cloned into pGL3Basic vector with a luciferase reporter gene, and Bm-ASH
and da genes was cloned into the modified transient
expression vector pBacPAK8-ie1-hr3 [40]. Recombined
plasmids were co-transfected into Bm-N cells by different
assorted ways. We found that the promoter had no activity
without the co-transfection of Bm-ASH or da genes' transient expression vectors (Fig. 4). The promoter had a significantly higher activity by co-transfection with Bm-ASH1
and the da genes' transient expression vectors than by
other co-transfections. Besides, the promoter activity was
weaker when it was only co-transfected into cells with BmASH genes than when also with da (ex., promoter activity
of ASH2P+ASH1 was weaker than that of ASH2P+ASH1+
da, Fig. 4).

In order to study whether the bHLH transcriptional factors regulate the promoter by the E-box region, we
changed one or both of the deduced E-boxes to "aAGG/
CcG" by site-directed mutation (Fig. 5A). Then the
mutated promoters were cloned into pGL3-Basic vector as
described above, and co-transfected Bm-N cells with each
Bm-ASH and da genes' transient expression vectors,
respectively. The results showed that E-box mutation significantly reduced the activity of the promoter when cotransfected with silkworm proneural genes (Fig. 5B, C, D;
p < 0.01). However, the activation of Bm-ase did not seem
to be related with either of the two deduced E-boxes (Fig.
5E; p > 0.05). These data suggest that proteins encoded by
Bm-ASH genes have similar functions to the AS-C transcriptional factors in Drosophila, and they synergize with
Da protein.
Expression distribution of Bombyx ASH genes in larval
tissues
To understand the potential in vivo regulations of ASH
genes, we detected the expression status of Bombyx ASH
genes in different tissues of the 5th instar larvae on the 3rd
and the 8th days (just after spinning) (Fig. 6). The data
showed that Bm-ASH1 and Bm-ASH2 were expressed in
organs derived from all the three cellular derms: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm; whereas Bm-ASH3 and
Bm-ase were only expressed in tissues derived from ectoderm and mesoderm. Bm-ASH1 was expressed in all
organs except silk glands (S-G) and hemocytes (He), and
at a low level in 5 d and had no expression in 8 d fat body
(FB). Bm-ASH2 was widely expressed in all the investigated samples. The expression of Bm-ASH3 and Bm-ase

Branch lengths are not drawn to scale. Letters upside of the branch lines show the duplication events as clarified by Wheeler et
al. [16] (see discussion for detailed description). It is obvious that all of the Asense proteins are grouped to one clade and the

the one which Bm-ASH1 is sorted in. Ag-ASH, Anopheles gambiae Achaete-Scute homolog (Genbank: AAK97461); AmASH,Apis mellifera Achaete-Scute homolog (Genbank: XP_393665); B-ASH1, Butterfly (Genbank: Precis coenia) Achaete-Scute

were more tissue specific, and the level of Bm-ase was relatively lower. Bm-ASH1 and Bm-ASH2 had high expression levels in gonads (G), while Bm-ASH2 and Bm-ASH3
had high expression levels in tracheal clusters (Tc). All of
the data suggested that the four Bm-ASH genes might play
various roles in the development of silkworm larva. We
should note that all three proneural genes expressed
highly in WD, and Bm-ase had a relatively higher expression level in 8 d WD. These implied that Bm-ASH genes
might be important for the development of the wing disc.

Developmental changes of Bombyx ASH genes in the
embryo and in the pupal wing
Functional genes play their roles by expression in special
tissues and at special time. We detected the expression
level of Bombyx ASH genes in the embryo and pupal wing
in order to study the function of these genes during silkworm development. Total RNA was extracted from 1 d to
9 d embryos or from wings/wing discs (from spinning to
the adult phase), and used for reverse transcription. cDNA
synthesized from about 10 ng total RNA was taken as the
template for each PCR reaction. We calculated the gene

copy number corresponding to 103 Bm-actin A3 copies at
each developmental point in the embryo and 106 in the
wing/wing disc. The results showed that during the
embryo development, both Bm-ASH2 and Bm-ase had two
expression peaks, one being both on 3 d, and the other
being on 5 d for Bm-ASH2 and on 6 d for Bm-ase (Fig. 7).
However, there was only one peak for each of the other
two Bm-ASH genes, Bm-ASH1 on 5 d and Bm-ASH3 on 4
d. Although the expression levels of Bm-ASH3 showed a

peak from 3 d to 5 d, its expression level was always lower
than the other three genes.
During the spinning (wandering) and pupal ages, the silkworm wing disc/wing form changes obviously by extension, turning and scale foundation. The results of
quantitative RT-PCR showed that all four genes had relatively high expression levels from 0 d to 3 d pupae (Fig. 8).
The result of Bm-ASH1 was similar to our previous results
[41]. Bm-ASH1, Bm-ASH2 and Bm-ASH3 all reached their

peak values on P-1 d, whereas Bm-ase peaked one day
later. Flanking these days, expression levels of the genes
were significantly lower. During the spinning period,
expressions of all four genes were at low levels, with Bmase being undetectable. It was notable that the expression
levels of the three proneural genes decreased from S-0d to
S-3d. Bm-ASH3 and Bm-ase were not express anymore
after P-3d pupa, while both Bm-ASH1 and Bm-ASH2 had
a low but noticeable peak in 5 d pupa.

Discussion
Our results showed that there were four AS-C homologs in
Bombyx mori: Bm-ASH1, Bm-ASH2, Bm-ASH3 and Bm-ase.
The first three were proneural genes, and the last one was
a neural precursor gene. The proneural genes enhanced
the activity of the Bm-ASH2 promoter by binding its Eboxes in Bm-N cells, which was one of the AS-C homolog
characteristics (Figs. 4 &5). The four genes had various
expression profiles in silkworm larval tissues (Fig. 6), and
further studies showed that they have important roles during the development of the embryo and the wing (Fig. 7
&8).

AS-C genes duplication in insects occurs after or parallel
but not before the taxonomic order formation during
evolution
Homologs of AS-C genes exist in various animals from
low-grade coelenterate to high-grade mammals, including
human being [30]. It has been proposed that AS-C gene
has several independent duplication events in Arthropoda, resulting in the plasticity of the gene number. In this
model, Cn-ASH, the AS-C homolog in Hydra is supposed
as the ancestral one. Parallel but independent duplication
events occurred in insects and chelicerates (Fig. 2,a &2b).
Within the Diptera two more duplication events happened during evolution. So the present most derived dipteran, Drosophila melanogaster, has the four AS-C genes
achaete, scute, lethal of scute and asense [16,30]; while lower
derived dipteran, such mosquito, has only two [31].

We found that there were four AS-C homologs in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, a model lepidopteran. Also, Bombyx is
the only insect besides Drosophila found with four AS-C
genes so far. Among the three proneural AS-C genes in
Drosophila, l'sc is the most original one, which is more

and sc (Table 2). Like l'sc, Bm-ASH1 is more identical to
non-lepidopteran insect proneural genes than other silkworm achaete-scute homologs (Table 2). What's more, l'sc
and Bm-ASH1, and other sole proneural genes from other
insects were sorted into one clade in the phylogenetic tree
(Fig. 2). The data imply that Bm-ASH1 is the most original
one in Bombyx. But homogeneous and phylogenetic analysis could not match each Bombyx proneural gene to those
of Drosophila one by one, and phylogenetic result sorted
ac/sc and Bm-ASH2/Bm-ASH3 into two independent
branches. So we suggest that the generations of ac/sc from
l'sc and Bm-ASH2/Bm-ASH3 from Bm-ASH1 are two paral-

lel and independent events, that is, further duplication of
proneural genes occurs after or parallel to but not before
the split of Diptera and Lepidoptera during evolution.
The medfly Ceratitis capitata, a member of family Tephritidae, has three AS-C homolog genes Cc-sc, Cc-l'sc and Ccase. The bHLH domains of proteins coded by Ceratitis capitata acheate-scute homologs are highly conserved and display 95%, 91.5% and 90% identity with the Drosophila
counterparts, respectively [28]. Only one AS-C homolog,
B-ASH1, has been isolated from the Nymphalidae insect
P. coenia [26]. B-ASH1 protein has a surprising identity
with Bm-ASH2, 100% within the bHLH domains and

ASH1, Bm-ASH2 and Bm-ase, respectively, and Bm-ASH3
might be the most recent one among the silkworm proneural genes.
AS-C genes have a broad expression distribution in insect
tissues
AS-C genes are important for the development of the nervous system, and have key roles in regulating the formation
and patterning of neural precursors. They are specially
expressed in most of the proneural clusters during the
development of either the central (CNS) or peripheral
nervous system (PNS) in arthropod, such as flies, butterflies, beetles, bees, spiders, chilopods, etc. Other functions
of these genes have also been found in Drosophila. l'sc participates in the specification of muscle progenitors [21], sc
functions in sex determination [18] and ac regulates the
development of Malphigian tubules [17].

In the present paper, we studied the expression of Bm-ASH
genes in various silkworm larval tissues using RT-PCR
methods. These genes are expressed in most organs
derived from all three derms, showing they might have
multiple functions during silkworm development. They
have higher expression levels in the head, wing disc, tracheal cluster, body wall or gonad, and all of them are
expressed in the organs though lower at some developmental points. This indicates that the genes might have
overlapping functions, just as in Drosophila [42]. Expression profiles during the development of the embryo and
the pupal wing also suggest co-operation characters of
Bm-ASH genes. During silkworm embryo development,
neurogenesis takes place around 3 d-old, and trachea,
bristle and appendage occur on 5 d and 6 d. The correspondence between the two stages and those when the
two expression peaks of Bm-ASH genes occure in the

embryo (Fig. 7) suggests that these genes regulate the
development of PNS and CNS. Expressions in wings of all
the four genes are significantly higher on 1 d or 2 d after
pupation than during other stages. Wing scale precursor
cells form around the 2 d-old pupal stage [41], and our
further studies on the scaleless wings mutant silkworm
strongly proved the key role of Bm-ASH2 in the formation
of wing scales (Zhou et al., unpublished).
Although we have known many important functions of
AS-C, the analysis of the structures and evolution of these
genes may suggest some of their unknown functions. We
compared the protein sequences of 38 AS-C homologs
from vertebrate and invertebrate. There are conserved
domains besides the bHLH and C-terminal motifs, especially within vertebrates. This conservation even exists
between vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. A ~20
amino acid conserved domain (corresponding to PEMRCKRRINFAQLGYNLPQ of Asp-ASH) was found in ASH
genes from vertebrates and myriapod animals Lithobius
forficatus (Lf-ASH, Genbank: AAT99570) and Archispirostreptus (Asp-ASH, Genbank: AJ536345). Together with the
broad expression of Bm-ASH genes in tissues outside of
the nervous system, they show that this gene family has
other important functions waiting for exploration.

Conclusion
In this work, we isolate and identify four achaete-scute
homologs from Bombyx mori. So far, Bombyx mori is the
second insect which has been found to have four AS-C
genes. During organism evolution, genes are duplicated
with conserved domains to gain more special functions.
Results of phylogenetic and gene expression analysis show
that during evolution, AS-C genes duplication in insects
occurs after or parallel to but not before the taxonomic
order formation and functions of these genes are broad
during insect development.

Methods
Insects and cell culture
The silkworm stock Jingsong × Haoyue was maintained in
our laboratory. The insects were reared on an artificial diet
at 25°C with 70%–80% relative humidity. Bm-N cells
derived from silkworm were cultured at 27°C in TC-100
insect medium containing 10% heat-inactivated (56°C,
30 min) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cell culture
details were the same as Summers and Smith [43].
RNA isolation and RT-PCR
Silkworm tissues were dissected out at different stages and
the total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the standard protocol, and whole
embryo total RNA was extracted using the acid-guanidine
method [44]. One microgramme of total RNA from each
sample was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA using M-

MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) as the protocol
described. PCR with proper program was performed using
the reverse transcription product as template. Sequences
of all primers used in this paper are available upon
request.
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
One microgramme of total RNA was used for RACE cDNA
synthesis (BD SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit,
Clontech), according to the user's manual. PCR was performed with primer1 and Universal Primer A Mix (UPM,
Clontech), then a nest PCR was processed with primer2
and NUP using the suitable diluted former PCR product
as the template. Each PCR reaction was carried out under
the following conditions: one cycle of pre-denaturing for
5 min at 95°C; and 30 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 60°C for
40 s, 72°C for 3 min, then followed by 10 min incubation
at 72°C.
Database blast, protein sequences alignment and
phylogenetic analysis
We used the amino acid sequence coded by Drosophila
achaete (Genbank: AAF45498) to blast the silkworm EST
database with the blastx program on the NCBI web site
[45], by limiting the organism with "Bombyx mori". As formerly described [46], insect ASH protein sequences were
aligned with CLUSTALX [47] and revised manually with
Gendoc software. Then a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree based
on amino acid sequences was constructed using the
PHYLIP software package (100 bootstrap replicates) [48].
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
Promoter segments were cloned into Luciferase Reporter
Vector pGL3-Basic separately, and the ORF region of silkworm ASH and Drosophila da (GenBank: Y00221) genes
were cloned into the modified pBacPAK8 vector with an
IE1 promoter and a hr3 enhancer [40]. Then the plasmids

were transfected into Bm-N cells as described formerly
[49]. 0.1 µg of pRL-CMV Vector was co-transfected as an
internal control reporter for each transfection. After incubating for 48 hours, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C. Then the cell lysates
were prepared using the passive lysis buffer, and 10 µg of
each lysate was used for the dual-luciferase reporter assay
according to the protocol (Dual-Luciferase® Reporter
[DLR™] Assay System, Promega). Firefly luciferase activity
and Renilla luciferase activity were determined with 20/
20n Luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Inc., USA). Each
treatment was repeated at least three times.

Introduction of point mutation
Primers P-F and P-R were designed at the terminals of the
target segment sequence. Reversed primers m-R and m-F
with the mutated bases were designed around the site
where the point mutation would be introduced. PCRs
were carried out with P-F pairing m-R or m-F paring P-R.
After purification, the two PCR products were mixed, and
denatured, renatured and extended for three cycles without any primers. Three cycles after running, P-F and P-R
were added and the PCR was continued for 30 cycles of
amplification. All of the PCRs were processed with pfu
DNA polymerase.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Q-PCR was used to determine the changes of silkworm
ASH genes expression during embryo development and
wing development. Primers were designed based on the
cDNA sequence and a segment around 200 bp would be
specially amplified for each gene. The housekeeping gene
Bm-actin A3 was used as the internal control. A 20 µl volume containing cDNA produced from about 10 ng of total
RNA, 5 pmol of each primer, and 10 µl of SYBR Green
Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Japan) was
used for each PCR reaction. Then the PCR was processed
on a Chromo4 Four-Color Real-Time System (Bio-Rad
[formerly MJ Research]) under the following program:
one cycle of 95°C for 3 min; then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15
sec, 60°C for 15 sec and 72°C for 30 sec. The melting
curve was established from 60°C to 95°C. Three independent repeats were carried out for each reaction.
Threshold cycle values were used for the further analysis.

Standard curves were constructed using serial dilutions of
the ORF segments of the genes recombined into pMD18T vectors (Takara, Japan). The log ranges of the standard
curves were from 106 to 102 copies. The data curve and the
melting curve showed the reliability and specificity of the
PCR product (Fig. 9). Threshold cycles of each standard
dilution point were used to generate a reliable standard
curve for each gene (Fig. 10). Linear equations corresponding to each standard curve were made, and R2 for
each standard curve was more than 0.99. This showed that
the linearity of the standard curves was good.
Theoretic copy of each sample was calculated with the linear equation for each gene, and trendlines for Bombyx ASH
genes during the development course of silkworm embryo
and pupal wing were constructed.
