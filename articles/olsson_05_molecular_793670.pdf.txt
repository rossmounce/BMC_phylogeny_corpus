Abstract
Although 11-ketotestosterone is a potent androgen and induces male secondary sex characteristics
in many teleosts, androgen receptors with high binding affinity for 11-ketotestosterone or
preferential activation by 11-ketotestosterone have not been identified. So, the mechanism by
which 11-ketotestosterone exhibits such high potency remains unclear. Recently we cloned the
cDNA of an 11-ketotestosterone regulated protein, spiggin, from three-spined stickleback renal
tissue. As spiggin is the only identified gene product regulated by 11-ketotestosterone, the
stickleback kidney is ideal for determination of the mechanism of 11-ketotestosterone gene
regulation. A single androgen receptor gene with two splicing variants, belonging to the androgen
receptor-β subfamily was cloned from stickleback kidney. A high affinity, saturable, single class of
androgen specific binding sites, with the characteristics of an androgen receptor, was identified in
renal cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Measurement of ligand binding moieties in the cytosolic and
nuclear fractions as well as to the recombinant receptor revealed lower affinity for 11ketotestosterone than for dihydrotestosterone. Treatment with different androgens did not upregulate androgen receptor mRNA level or increase receptor abundance, suggesting that autoregulation is not involved in differential ligand activation. However, comparison of the transactivation potential of the stickleback androgen receptor with the human androgen receptor, in
both human HepG2 cells and zebrafish ZFL cells, revealed preferential activation by 11ketotestosterone of the stickleback receptor, but not of the human receptor. These findings
demonstrate the presence of a receptor preferentially activated by 11-ketotestosterone in the
three-spined stickleback, so far the only one known in any animal.

Introduction
Androgens have critical physiological roles in male sexual
differentiation and in the development of male secondary
sex characteristics. Androgens primarily mediate their
actions through interactions with receptors belonging to
the steroid hormone receptor super-family. Androgen
receptors (AR) have been identified in many vertebrates
and demonstrate similar binding characteristics in the various species investigated. Most vertebrates have one AR
with high specificity for 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
However, some teleosts have two AR with high binding
affinities for either testosterone (T) or DHT [1,2]. 11ketotestosterone (KT) is a major androgen in many teleosts and it often occurs at higher levels in the circulation
and has a higher potency in inducing male reproductive
functions than other androgens [3]. Although several AR
have been isolated and characterized from teleost species,
none of these have characteristics expected in a specific KT
receptor. Consequently, an explanation for the high
androgenic potency of KT in teleosts is currently not
available.
AR have been cloned and characterized from several teleosts, including Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), rainbow
trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)
and red seabream (Pagrus major) [4-7]. Rainbow trout,
tilapia and Japanese eel have two AR isoforms and while
only one isoform (ARα) is a functional AR in rainbow
trout, both Japanese eel AR are functional receptors [6,7].
Following transfection of human embryonic kidney 293
cells with either of the Japanese eel AR cDNAs it was
observed that KT and DHT were equally potent activators
of both AR isoforms, while T was significantly less potent
in activating an MMTV-LTR driven luciferase reporter vector [4,6]. In contrast, the red sea bream AR was equally
activated by T and KT via an MMTV promoter system in
transfected COS-7 cells [5]. Similarly, a rainbow trout ARα
reporter system in a carp EPC cell line was equally activated by DHT, KT and T [8]. Thus, none of the previously
cloned AR genes show any preference for KT in trans-activation assays. A lack of specificity for KT in androgen signaling pathways was also suggested by androgen binding
studies on tissues from Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias
undulatus), kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), rainbow trout
and goldfish (Carassius auratus) [1,2,8-10]. Based on tissue specific binding profiles there are two forms of AR in
Atlantic croaker and kelp bass. One isoform, AR1, shows
the highest binding affinity for T followed by DHT and KT
while the other, AR2, shows the highest affinity for DHT
followed by T and KT [1]. A limitation of the previous
studies was that no KT-regulated gene had been identified
in any of the studied species, and therefore no definite
conclusion regarding endogenous gene regulation by KT
could be drawn.

Hypertrophy of the kidneys and the production of a glue,
spiggin, used in nest building by the kidneys of male
three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) during
the breeding season, is currently the clearest example of a
male reproductive process induced by KT [3,11].
Although treatment of stickleback with a variety of androgens can induce the kidney hypertrophy normally
observed during the breeding season, KT is by far the most
potent inducer of kidney hypertrophy and spiggin production [12,13]. These findings are of physiological
importance because KT is the major plasma androgen during the breeding season in male stickleback [14]. However, a previous study showing that [3H]-KT was equally
displaced from stickleback kidney tissue fragments by
unlabelled KT or DHT provided no evidence for the presence of a specific KT AR in this species [15]. Thus, even in
sticklebacks, where a specific KT-regulated gene product
has been identified, the mechanism by which KT exhibits
high androgenic potency remains unclear.
Due to the well-known regulation of spiggin by KT in the
three-spined stickleback, the stickleback kidney is an ideal
system in which to determine the mechanism by which
KT regulates gene expression in teleosts and to determine
the possible involvement of specific KT receptors in this
signaling pathway. The binding characteristics of stickleback kidney cytosolic and nuclear preparations were comprehensively investigated in the present study to
determine the androgen specificity of the AR(s) in this
species. Furthermore, AR was cloned from stickleback kidney RNA and the molecular structures of two splicing variants, ARβ1 and ARβ2, were characterized. While the
investigations of the binding affinities of androgens for
the stickleback AR indicated that DHT bound better than
KT to the receptor, comparison of the trans-activation
potency of the stickleback AR with the human AR showed
that KT was more potent at down-stream gene activation
than DHT, in transfected HepG2 and ZFL cells, in the presence of the stickleback AR but not of the human AR.

Experimental
Materials
[3H]-DHT (92.84 Ci/mmol) and [3H]-KT (98.05 Ci/
mmol) were purchased from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA, USA) and stored at -20°C. The unlabeled steroids were purchased from either Steraloids, Inc. (Wilton,
NH, USA) or from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis,
MO, USA). All radiolabelled steroids were stored in 95%
ethanol at -20°C. Chemicals and salts used for making the
buffers were purchased from Sigma and from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The scintillation cocktail was a
mixture of 4 L toluene, 16 g PPO (7,5-diphenyl-oxazole),
and 0.4 g POPOP (1,4-bis [5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl]-benzene).

Fish Maintenance
Adult stickleback were caught in Öresund and routinely
housed in large aquaria containing brackish water (0.5%
salinity) at 20°C under a photoperiod of 16:8 h light:dark
(LD). A total of 300 male and female sticklebacks were
used in the present study. The fish ranged in weight
between 1 and 3 g. The water was aerated and filtered and
the bottom was covered with sand. The fish were fed red
midge larvae daily. Kidneys from males that had been
brought into breeding condition by exposure to 20°C
under a photoperiod of 16:8 h LD were used for the characterization of the AR. For the experimental treatments,
the fish were initially in non-breeding condition. For the
spiggin-experiment post-breeding females were used,
these had been exposed to LD 16:8 and 17°C for a few
months. For the other experimental treatments, fish were
caught in non-reproductive seasons and housed under
low temperature (9°C) and a photoperiod of LD 8:16
until a few days before treatment when they were put into
high temperature and long photoperiod in order to acclimate. These investigations were approved by the Stockholm Northern Animal Experiment Ethical Committee
(permit N 185/00).
Tissue sampling and steroid treatments
Steroid treatments were performed using females, as their
kidneys do not undergo hypertrophy under natural conditions, and castrated males. The fish were anesthetized
with 0.1% (v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) and implanted intraperitoneally with Silclear silicone tubing (10-mm length, 0.6-mm inner diameter, 1.2mm outer diameter) containing steroids dissolved in
cocoa butter. The steroids used were 11-ketoandrostenedione (KA), DHT, T and 17β-estradiol (E2) (1 or 25 µg µl-1).
KA was used as this steroid is converted into KT by the fish
[14]. Tubes containing cocoa butter alone were used as
controls. Following implantation the fish were maintained in 50-liter aquaria containing brackish water (0.5%
salinity) at 20°C under LD 16:8 h. At sampling fish were
decapitated and the kidneys were excised, frozen using
liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70°C. A number of experiments were performed as follows. Spiggin mRNA was
measured in post-breeding females that were dissected 2
days following implantation of tubes. Cytosolic androgen-receptors were measured in females and in castrated
males. Males were castrated under anesthesia as above, by
making a 1.5 mm long incision into the abdominal cavity
on each side and removing the testes using forceps. The
females and the castrated males were implanted with control and high dose tubes and dissected after 6 days. AR
mRNA was studied in females implanted for 12 h, 2 and
16 days (separate experiments) with control and high
dose tubes and in males castrated as above and implanted
for 10 days with control tubes and high doses of KA or E2.

Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Total RNA was extracted from a pooled sample of five
mature male kidneys using Tri Reagent™ (Sigma). The
cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA using the
First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Amplification reactions
were assembled using oligonucleotides based upon conserved regions in teleost AR (GeneBank accession numbers: AB012095, AB012096, AB017158, AB023960,
AF121257, AB025361 and AF326200). These oligonucleotides were: forward (5'-GGGAAACAGAAATACCTGTGTG-3') and reverse (5'-CTCTGCAATCATCTCTGGAAAG3'). Amplification was conducted for 40 cycles at 94°C for
30 s, at 40°C for 1 min and at 72°C for 1 min using a PTC200 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA).
Amplified products were ligated into pGEM®-T (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) and recombinant plasmids were isolated using the Wizard® Plus SV Miniprep System
(Promega). Cycle sequencing was performed using the
DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Premix Kit
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
The reactions were resolved on an ABI Prism™ 377 DNA
Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Milano, Italy) and the data
obtained were analyzed using EditView (Version 1.01)
(Perkin-Elmer).
cDNA library screening
A unidirectional cDNA library, against mature male kidney cDNA, constructed in Lambda ZAP Express® (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to screen for AR cDNA
using a DIG-labeled AR cRNA probe. The screening was
conducted according to the Lambda ZAP Express® manual
(Stratagene). DIG labeled anti-sense RNA probes were
generated using the DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Hybridization was performed at 45°C
overnight (O/N) in hybridization buffer (5 × SSC, 50%
formamid, 0.02% SDS (w/v), 0,1% N-laurylsarcosine (w/
v) and 2% blocking solution (w/v)) (Roche). Membranes
were washed for 2 × 5 min in 2 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS
at room temperature, and for 2 × 15 min in 0.2 × SSC,
0.1% (w/v) SDS at 68°C. Signals were detected using
CSPD (Roche) and exposure of Hyperfilm™-MP film
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) and hybridization signals were visualized using a
CURIX 60 Film Developer (AGFA-Gevaert AB, Kista, Sweden). Positive plaques were purified through four successive hybridization rounds, and individual clones were
isolated by phagemid excision. Following sequence identification of the clones as AR, they were sequenced to completion by Cybergene AB (Huddinge, Sweden).
Slot Blot Analysis
Total RNA was extracted using Tri Reagent™ (Sigma). Aliquots of 10 µg of total RNA were mixed with denaturing
solution (6 × SSC, 7% (v/v) formaldehyde) and

transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Minifold II Slot Blot Apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH, USA). Membranes were
probed using either a randomly primed [α-32P]-dCTP
radiolabelled AR cDNA fragment (918 base pairs) that
was isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction and sequenced as above, or a randomly primed
[α-32P]-dCTP radiolabelled spiggin-α cDNA. Hybridizations were performed at 65°C overnight (6 × SCC, 0.1%
(w/v) SDS, 100 µg ml-1 tRNA, and 5 × Denhardt's solution). The membranes were washed for 2 × 30 minutes at
42°C and 65°C in 0.1 × SCC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS whereafter
Hyperfilm™-MP film was exposed at -70°C. The films
were visualized using Curix 60 Film Developer. Following
AR and spiggin mRNA determination the membranes
were stripped and analyzed for 18S rRNA using a cDNA
fragment as internal control. Each AR or spiggin transcript
was then semi-quantified using Quantity ONE 4.2.3 (BioRad, Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA) in relation to
its internal 18S transcript.
Southern analyses of stickleback genomic DNA
Southern analyses were performed using 20 µg aliquots of
male or female stickleback genomic DNA digested with 10
units of either SacI, BamHI or EcoRI at 37°C for 8 h
according to Sambrook et al. [16]. Membranes were
probed using [α32P]-dCTP radiolabelled partial cDNA
encoding stickleback AR, which was isolated and
sequenced as described above. Hybridizations were performed at 60°C O/N in 5 × SSC, 0.02% SDS (w/v), 0,1%
N-laurylsarcosine (w/v) and 1% blocking solution (w/v)
(Roche). Membranes were washed for 2 × 30 min periods
at 42°C and 60°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Membranes were exposed to Hyperfilm™-MP and were visualized as described above.
Sequence similarity analysis
The amino acid sequence alignments were made using
sequences obtained from the GenBank sequence data
bank with the following accession numbers: Human,
Homo sapiens AR (M34233); Mouse, Mus musculus AR
(X53779); Rat, Rattus norvegicus AR (M20133); Zebra
finch, Taeniopygia guttata AR (AF532914); African clawed
toad, Xenopus leavis AR (U67129); Tilapia ARα
(AB045211); Tilapia ARβ (AB045212); Burton's mouthbreeder AR, Haplochromis burtoni AR (AF121257); Burton's
mouthbreeder ARβ (AY082342); Japanese eel ARα
(AB023960); Japanese eel ARβ (AB025361); Red seabream AR (AB017158); Three-spined stickleback ARβ
(AY247207); Goldfish AR (AY090897); rainbow trout
ARα (AB012095); rainbow trout ARβ (AB012096); Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes ARα (AB076399). The
sequence alignments were performed using Omiga 2.0
(Oxford Molecular Ltd). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using Tree view (Version 1.6.2) [17] following the

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/37

alignment using the Clustal W algorithm (Version 1.7)
[18] based on the GenBank sequences used for the
sequence alignment.
Expression vector cloning
The excised AR pBK CMV clones were digested with XbaI
and EcoRI and the inserts were gel purified prior to ligation into the pCMV-TNT vector (Promega) between XbaI
and EcoRI. The obtained AR pCMV-TNT constructs were
confirmed by sequencing. AR was expressed by introducing the pCMV-TNT into the TNT coupled reticulocyte
lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The size of the expressed products was determined by addition of S35-methionin to the reticulocyte
lysate system. The obtained protein suspension was analyzed on a denaturing 8% SDS PAGE and the sizes were
determined using prestained SDS-PAGE broad range protein molecular weight standard (Bio-Rad) and a control
luciferase protein of 62 kDa included in the reticulocyte
lysate system (Promega). For use in binding assays AR was
expressed in the absence of radioactive S35-methionein
and stored at 4°C until further used in recombinant binding assay experiments.
Sample preparation for AR assays
The excised kidney was weighed and thereafter frozen in
liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -80°C. Following thawing the samples were homogenized in 10 volumes ice cold
homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM sodium
molybdate, 1 mM EDTA, 12 mM monothioglycerol and
10% glycerol (v/v), pH 7.4) by using a Polytron Tissuemizer (Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH, USA) a setting 7 for
10 seconds followed by five passes in a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 15
min. The supernatant was transferred to an ultracentrifuge
tube and spun at 150,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant
was charcoal stripped by mixing 10 ml of the supernatant
with 2.5 ml Dextran-coated charcoal buffer (DCC) (50
mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% NoritA charcoal (w/v) and 0,1% Dextran T-70 (w/v), pH 7.5)
and centrifuging for 10 min at 6,000 × g to pellet the charcoal and obtain the cytosolic fraction. The cytosolic
extract was further diluted 5 × with homogenization
buffer prior to binding assay analysis. The crude nuclear
pellet obtained from the initial 2,500 × g spin was washed
three times in ice-cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 2
mM MgCl2, 2 mM monothioglycerol, 250 mM sucrose
and 10% glycerol (v/v), pH 7.5). The resulting pellet was
resuspended in 5 ml extraction buffer (homogenization
buffer supplemented with 0.7 M KCl), and incubated for
60 min at 4°C with vortexing at 15 min intervals. The
preparation was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min and
the supernatant provided the nuclear fraction. The preparations were either used immediately or kept frozen at 80°C until assayed.

Binding Assay
[3H]-DHT or [3H]-KT was dried under nitrogen, re-dissolved in 50 µl ice-cold homogenization buffer and added
to assay tubes with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled DHT or KT. Aliquots (250 µl) of the nuclear or
cytosolic preparations were added to each tube, the tubes
were vortexed and incubated over night at 4°C. To stop
the binding reaction, 250 µl DCC was added to each tube.
The tubes were vortexed and the suspensions were incubated for 5 min at 4°C, before spinning at 3,000 × g at
4°C for 5 min. The supernatants were decanted into 7 ml
scintillation vials, 5 ml of standard scintillation cocktail
was added and the radioactivity in each sample was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS
6000SC, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). The procedure used for the expressed recombinant ARβ2 was
modified as follows. [3H]-DHT was dried down under
nitrogen, re-dissolved in 100 µl ice-cold homogenization
buffer and added to assay tubes with or without a 1,000fold excess of unlabeled DHT. The expressed proteins
were diluted 1:100 and aliquots (100 µl) were added to
each reaction tube. The tubes were vortexed and incubated over night at 4°C. To stop the binding reaction, 200
µl DCC was added to each tube. The tubes were vortexed
and the suspension were incubated for 5 min at 4°C,
before spinning at 3,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min. 250 µl of
the supernatant was transferred into 5 ml scintillation
vials and 4 ml of standard scintillation cocktail was added
before the radioactivity in each sample was measured in a
liquid scintillation counter (Wallac 1409, Wallac Oy,
Turku, Finland).
Saturation and Scatchard analysis
[3H]-DHT (0.42 – 18.2 nM) or [3H]-KT (0.42 – 15.4 nM)
was added to each reaction tube with or without a 100fold excess of unlabeled steroid. For the expressed AR,
[3H]-DHT (2.5 – 42 nM) was added to each reaction tube
with or without a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled steroid.
Nuclear or cytosolic suspensions were incubated with steroids over night at 4°C. The reactions were terminated and
the radioactivity measured as described above. Non-linear
curve fitting procedures (GraphPad Prism, version 3.03,
GraphPad Software Inc) were used to calculate the dissociation constant (Kd) and to estimate the concentration of
binding sites (Bmax) in the different suspensions.
Association and Dissociation kinetics
To investigate the time needed to reach binding equilibrium, cytosolic preparations were incubated in 4 nM [3H]DHT with or without 400 nM unlabeled steroid. The reaction was terminated at different time-points ranging
between 1 min and 24 h. The specific binding at each
time-point was determined as described above. In order to
investigate the receptor dissociation time, the preparation
were incubated over night with 4 nM [3H]-DHT with or

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/37

without 100-fold excess of unlabelled DHT for determining non-specific binding, before adding 100-fold excess of
unlabelled DHT, and binding was subsequently measured
between 5 min and 28 h.
Steroid specificity
The steroid specificity of receptor binding was examined
using a competitive binding assay. Diluted protein suspension (1:100) were incubated over night at 4°C in
tubes containing 1 nM [3H]-DHT with or without unlabelled steroid at end concentrations ranging between 1
pM and 100 µM. Steroids used were: KT; DHT; T; E2;
17,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one
(17,20β-P);
17,20β,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, (20β-S) and cortisol (F). Following incubation, the reaction was terminated by addition of DCC and centrifugation and the
specific binding in each tube was determined as described
above.
Cell culture and transfection assays
Two liver epithelial cell lines were used to test receptor
activity. HepG2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and nonessential amino acids. ZFL cells (ATCC) were maintained
in 50% L-15 Leibovitz, 15% H-12 Ham and 35% DMEM
supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland,
UK) and 50 ng ml-1 EGF (Sigma). Cells were cultured at
37°C (HepG2) or 28°C (ZFL) in 5% CO2. The transfection experiments were initiated by replacing the tissue culture medium with fresh phenol-free medium
supplemented with charcoal stripped FCS and the cells
were seeded on 24-well plates. Transfections were performed at 90–95% confluence using 1,5 µl Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 0,6 µg DNA per
well. Transfected DNA contained 60 ng pRL (Promega),
270 ng androgen response element (ARE) luciferase
reporter vector, 270 ng stickleback ARβ2 expression vector
or 270 ng human AR expression vector (pCMVhAR) while
270 ng empty TNT cloning vector was used to control
background luciferase levels following transfections. Two
different ARE containing promoter constructs were tested,
one containing 3 separate ARE (HRE; slp-ARU) and a second one construct (slp-HRE2) containing 4 copies of the
ARE with high affinity for R1881, a synthetic androgen,
and low affinity for dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid [19].

After 16 h the transfection medium was replaced with
fresh phenol-free medium, supplemented with charcoal
stripped FCS, containing different steroid hormones. The
cells were exposed to the hormones for 40 h and luciferase
levels were detected using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit
(Promega) in a TD 20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs,
Sunnyvale, CA). For each cell line, transfection assay was
performed for each concentration with n = 4 and the

times more effective than DHT and 50 times more effective than T at increasing kidney spiggin mRNA levels (Fig.
1). When implanted with 1 µg steroid a more pronounced
difference was observed with KT being 23 times more
potent than DHT and T not inducing spiggin production.
AR cloning and characterization

stickleback AR was isolated by RT-PCR and used to screen

a mature male three-spined stickleback kidney lambda
ZAP Express cDNA library. Several positive clones were
obtained and two different size transcripts were identified.
One longer sequence (3168 bp) coded for a partial AR,
ARβ2 (Gene Bank Accession no AY247206), and one
shorter sequence (2515 bp) coded for a full length AR,
ARβ1 (Gene Bank Accession no AY247207). The ARβ1
sequence contained a 322 bp 5'-UTR (untranslated
region) including an in frame stop codon, a 2046 bp coding sequence and a 147 bp 3'-UTR, and the gene coded for
a 682 amino acid AR (ARβ1) protein. The ARβ2 sequence
differed from ARβ1 in that it contained additional amino
acid sequence in the N-terminal region, coding for 735
amino acids and also contained a longer (961 bp) 3'-UTR.
The 3'-UTR of both transcripts was identical up to the
poly-A tail of the shorter UTR (147 bp), indicating the
presence of two poly-adenylation sites in the stickleback
AR gene. The sequence of both transcripts exhibited a conserved identity (100%) in overlapping regions at both the

nucleotide and protein levels, thus indicating that both
were derived from a single locus by alternative splicing.
Southern analysis of genomic material from both male
and female stickleback demonstrated a hybridization pattern that was compatible with the existence of a single ARβ
gene (Fig. 2).
Sequence comparison analysis defined the three-spined
stickleback AR as an ARβ isotype clustered with other teleost ARβ isotypes (Fig. 3). The closest overall similarity
was found with the red seabream AR (76.1%) and the tilapia ARβ (70.9%) (Fig. 4). Low similarity was observed
with ARα isoforms and with the mammalian AR. Deter-

mination of sequence similarities between different
domains showed a high conservation of the DNA-binding
domain (DBD) and the ligand binding domain (LBD),
while the N-terminal trans-activation domains (AF1 and
AF5) were less conserved (Fig. 4). In both AF1 and AF5,
the stickleback ARβ showed the highest similarity to red
seabream AR and tilapia ARβ.
Alignment of the three-spined stickleback AR LBD with
other AR showed that the sequences were highly conserved and that the four amino acids thought to be
involved in direct ligand-interactions with DHT in human
AR (N705, Q711, R752 and T877), or amino acids with

code for a 82.2 kD protein. Both AR migrated as double
bands following electrophoresis and the transcript sizes
were 52 and 61 kD for ARβ1 and 75 and 87 kD for ARβ2
(Fig. 6). These results indicate that ARβ2 was properly
translated in the reticulocyte system, while ARβ1 appeared
as a truncated translation product.

possible close contact to DHT (L704, M745 and F764),
were conserved in the stickleback [20]. An arginine,
located at position 779 in human AR that has been suggested to be of importance for ligand binding pocket
architecture [21], has been substituted with a threonine in
the stickleback sequence (Fig 5).
Both AR splicing variants were re-cloned into the pCMVTNT expression vector in order to produce AR in vitro for
binding assays and for expression in HepG2 and ZFL cells.
S35-Met labeled AR was separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel to determine the size of the expressed proteins.
From the nucleotide sequence, ARβ1 was estimated to
code for a 76.6 kD protein while ARβ2 was estimated to

AR binding characteristics
As a first step in the characterization of the AR binding
characteristics in stickleback kidney, we determined the
nature of interaction between ligand and receptor. Saturation ligand binding assays were performed on cytosolic,
nuclear and membrane fractions of kidney extracts using
either [3H]-DHT or -KT as tracer. In the initial studies we
used [3H]-DHT to determine the presence of ARs in stickleback kidneys. High affinity and saturable binding was
observed in both the cytosolic and nuclear fraction (Fig.
7A and 7E) while no specific binding to the membrane
fraction was observed (data not shown). Next, using [3H]KT we also observed high affinity and saturable binding
sites in the kidney cytosol (Fig. 7C). Finally we used AR
produced in the reticulocyte system to determine the characteristics of the cloned AR (Fig. 7G).

The saturation assay analysis, using [3H]-DHT as a tracer,
was consistent with a single class of high affinity cytosolic
AR with a Kd of 18.7 ± 3.21 nM and a Bmax of 5.61 ± 0.63
pmol/g tissue (Fig. 7B). Specific binding of [3H]-DHT was
also present in the nuclear fraction where a Kd of 3,82 ±
0,26 nM and a Bmax of 0.67 ± 0.17 pmol/g tissue was
observed (Fig. 7F). Saturation assay analysis, using [3H]KT as a tracer, was also consistent with a single class of
high affinity cytosolic AR with a Kd of 4.44 ± 1.61 nM and
a Bmax of 1.06 ± 0.15 pmol/g tissue (Fig. 7D). Analysis of
the recombinant ARβ2 using [3H]-DHT as a tracer also
showed high affinity specific binding to reticulocyte
extract with a Kd of 15.33 ± 2.50 nM and a Bmax of 0.324 ±
0.04 pmol/mg protein (Fig. 7H). The truncated translation product of ARβ1 did not give any measurable binding
using the reticulocyte system and was therefore not further used in the present study.
Determinations of the binding kinetics in the kidney
cytosolic fraction demonstrated rapid association
between the ligand and receptor at 4°C. The binding of
[3H]-DHT had a t1/2 of 3.3 min and reached equilibrium
after 20 minutes (Fig. 8). The complete dissociation of
[3H]-DHT bound to the receptor occurred within 8 hours
with a t1/2 of 80 min (Fig. 8 insert).
AR steroid specificity
Ligand competition assays were performed using 1 nM
[3H]-DHT as a tracer to determine the relative affinity of
steroid hormones to AR (Fig. 9). The binding curves were
parallel, indicating competitive binding between the

various unlabelled steroids and [3H]-DHT, allowing EC50
values to be determined. Using kidney extracts, the highest affinity binding was observed for DHT (EC50 = 1.31 ±
0.18 nM) while both KT and T had lower affinity (42.75 ±
3.42 nM and 68.81 ± 14.45 nM respectively). Binding was
also observed for E2 (85.10 ± 17.87 nM), but not for
17,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one
(17,20β-P),
17,20β,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (20β-S) or F (Fig
9A). Using ARβ2 containing reticulocyte extract, the highest affinity again was observed for DHT (EC50 = 0.67 ±
0.19 nM), followed by KT and T (2.18 ± 0.71 nM and 3.03
± 0.43 nM), while E2 showed lower binding affinity
(64.61 ± 0.28 nM) and F showed poor binding (Fig. 9B).
Thus, in both cases DHT was found to have higher affinity
than KT or T for the stickleback AR.
AR regulation
Determination of hormone specific regulation was performed by exposing three-spined sticklebacks for 6 days to
DHT, KA, T or E2. None of the three tested androgens regulated AR protein as determined by radioreceptor assay,
or AR mRNA as determined by slot blot. However, E2 was
found to be a repressor of both AR protein and AR mRNA
(data not shown).
Ligand specific AR gene activation
The ability of ARβ2 to regulate gene expression through an
ARE-regulated luciferase vector was determined using
both human HepG2 cells and zebrafish ZFL cells. Both
DHT and KT showed dose-dependent activation via the
stickleback AR in both HepG2 and ZFL cells (Fig. 10A)
The results showed that KT induced luciferase activity 12
fold in ZFL cell and 10 in HepG2 cells, while DHT
induced luciferase activity 4.5-fold in ZFL cells and 4.1fold in HepG2 cells (Fig. 10A). The higher activation
obtained with KT was significantly different from the
activity obtained with DHT using both 10-8 M (P < 0.001
for both cell lines) and 10-6 M (p < 0.05 for both cell lines)
steroid. Furthermore, comparison of the stickleback AR
with the human AR, in the ZFL cell line, showed that the
stickleback AR was preferentially activated by KT while the
human AR did not discriminate between androgens (Fig.
10B).

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to characterize key components of the AR signaling pathway through which KT
mediates its induction of spiggin in the stickleback. Central to androgenic signaling is the interaction between the
hormone and its receptor. So far no AR, which is preferentially activated by KT, has been identified in any animal.
The only KT-induced gene product clearly identified to
date is the underwater adhesive protein, spiggin [11,13],

In vitro translation products of three-spined stickleback ARβ1 and β2. AR was expressed by introducing the
pCMV-TNT into the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System. The size of the expressed products was determined by
addition of S35-methionin to the reticulocyte lysate system.
The protein suspensions were analyzed on a 8% SDS PAGE.
Deduction of protein size from sequencing data yielded a
expected size of 76.6 kDa for ARβ1 and 82.2 kDa for ARβ2.
Estimation of translation product sizes resulted in 61 kDa
and 52 kDa for ARβ1 and 87 kDa and 75 kDa for ARβ2.

spiggin mRNA induction was only observed with KA [13].
These results clearly show that 11-ketoandrogens are by
far the most effective inducers of spiggin mRNA. Furthermore, androgen induction of spiggin protein [25] and
mRNA synthesis (Olsson, P.-E., Berg, A.H., Lindberg, C.,
unpublished results) can be blocked by the anti-androgen
flutamide. This suggests that spiggin is induced, preferentially by KT, via a traditional AR, belonging to the nuclear
steroid hormone receptor family.

which is synthesized in the kidneys of male three-spined
sticklebacks and used to construct a nest. While KT is the
main inducer of spiggin production, other androgens will
also increase spiggin synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion, although less efficiently. Measurements of androgen
levels in stickleback have shown that KT is a prominent
androgen in males during the breeding period [14,22]. It
has been shown that the KT levels increased from 2 ng/ml
during the prespawning period to peak at 40 ng/ml during
spawning and to thereafter return to lower levels (≤1 ng/
ml) in post spawning male sticklebacks [14,22]. Through
these stages the T levels remain at about 1–4 ng/ml
plasma. In spawning female stickleback the KT levels have
been determined to be 1 ng/ml while the T levels are 20
ng/ml [22]. Circulating DHT levels have not been measured in the stickleback, but are likely to be low since neither DHT nor 5α-androstane-3,17-dione were formed in
significant amounts (≤0.5%), if at all, when nesting stickleback testes tissue were incubated with tritiated androstenedione (reexamination of data on which [23] are
based). While there are also no measurements of DHT levels in the stickleback kidney, 5α-reductase has been identified in stickleback kidney samples [24], thus suggesting
that DHT may be locally formed and functional in stickleback. However, these studies suggest that KT is the main
androgen in spawning male sticklebacks. In the present
study KA was 10 times more potent than DHT and 50
times more potent than T at inducing spiggin mRNA (Fig.
1). In a previous study, using longer exposures (16 days)

Cloning and characterization of the stickleback AR demonstrated that there is a single AR gene locus that codes for
a single receptor and that the ligand-binding characteristics of both the cloned and the endogenous receptor are
indicative of a single class of high affinity AR (Fig. 7) with
higher affinity for DHT than for KT or T (Fig 9). The binding kinetics shows that the AR present in the stickleback
kidney has ligand-binding characteristics similar to those
of previously characterized nuclear AR from other teleosts
[1,2,9].
The stickleback AR shows the greatest similarity to AR
from seabream and tilapia, fishes that like the stickleback,
but unlike the rainbow trout and eel, belong to Series Percomorpha among the Acanthypterygii [26]. The receptor
was found to have 2 splicing variants and 2 poly adenylation sites, and therefore could result in 4 possible different
transcripts. The ligand-binding domain of the AR was
found to be highly similar to other AR and contains the
amino acids that are thought to be important for DHT
interaction with the human AR [20,21]. The crystallographic structure of human AR indicates that N705,
Q711, R752 and T877 have possible hydrogen bonds
with DHT [20]. These 4 amino acids are conserved in teleost AR with one exception; in tilapia ARβ has a R752K
substitution (GenBank AB045212). However, no data is
available on the function of that receptor. Amino acids
L704, M745 and F764 that are considered to have close
contact with the ligand in human AR [20], are also conserved in teleost AR. An additional amino acid considered
to be important for the architecture of AR is R779 [21].
Three mutations (R779A, R779Q and R779S) of the
human AR were tested for trans-activation in COS cells
and were found to lead to complete inactivation of AR
[21]. It is interesting to note that this amino acid is not
conserved among teleosts where both R779S and R779T
are found. Neither of these alternative amino acids results
in silencing of AR in teleosts as observed by transcriptional activation studies [5,6]. These results demonstrate
that the AR ligand binding domains of teleosts and mammals are highly similar, although not identical.
Several previous studies have shown the presence of DHT
and T receptors in teleosts, but so far no specific KT receptor has been identified [1,2,5-7]. Comparison of trans-

were treated during 40 hours with increasing concentrations (10-14 M to 10-6 M) of KT (circles) or DHT (triangles). Exposure

using the stickleback AR but not the human AR expression vector. Statistically significant differences from control levels are

activation efficacy between human AR and Japanese eel
ARα and ARβ, using 293 cells, showed that KT was equally
effective at activating gene transcription via either the
human AR or Japanese eel ARβ [27], and that all three AR
failed to distinguish between KT, DHT and T. Although
several studies have determined either the ligand binding
affinity of AR or the trans-activation of AR, there are few
studies dealing with both aspects. However, in one study
[8], the rainbow trout ARα ligand binding properties were
determined in a heterologous system, the COS-1 cell line.
The potency of binding was highest (IC50: 6 × 10-10 M), for
DHT followed by T, while the poorest binding (IC50: 8 ×
10-9 M) was observed for KT. In contrast to this, determination of the trans-activation potential using the carp epithelioma papillosum cyprini cell line indicated that the
efficiency of activation of the rainbow trout ARα was
equal for all three natural androgens [8]. Thus, there was
an apparent discrepancy between the binding studies,
showing that rainbow trout ARα had higher affinities for
DHT and T than KT, and the reporter gene studies, showing that this difference was not reflected in activation
potential [8]. In the present study we observed that DHT
bound with higher affinity than KT to the native stickleback AR (Fig. 9A) and the in vitro translated recombinant
stickleback ARβ2 (Fig. 9B). However, following transfection of the stickleback ARβ2-CMVTNT expression vector
into either human HepG2 or zebrafish ZFL cells, together
with either the slp-ARU or the slp-ARE, KT was in both
cases approximately 2 to 3-fold more potent than DHT in
activating the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 10). In contrast
to this the human AR was equally activated by DHT, KT
and T (Fig. 10), which is in agreement with earlier studies
[27]. Taken together the results are consistent with the
data obtained on rainbow trout [8] and suggest that KT
preferentially activate the stickleback ARβ2. The N-terminal domain has been suggested to be important for both
trans-activation and protein-protein interactions and it is
conceivable that there are ligand specific interactions
between the LBD and the N-terminal trans-activation
domain [28,29]. Evidence that ligand-dependent conformational changes may occur with the AR has been
obtained with mesterolone, a synthetic androgen with an
additional methyl group on carbon 1 of the A ring.
Although mesterolone was found to have a similar binding affinity as DHT and T for both the wild type human AR
and a mutant AR found in subfertile men, only mesterolone was able to restore mutant AR function to normal
[30].
The 3-fold difference in trans-activation potential probably does not entirely explain the observed potency differences between KT and DHT in inducing spiggin in
stickleback in vivo [13]. This result may partly be due to
the different in the binding affinities of various androgens
to the sex steroid binding proteins in fish blood. While KT

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/37

has low affinity for binding to sex steroid binding proteins
[31-36], both DHT and T show high affinities for these
binding proteins in both mammals and teleosts [33,35].
The lower binding affinity of 11-ketoandrogens for sex
steroid binding proteins in the plasma, and the resulting
higher circulating levels of free steroid, may also contribute to the higher effectiveness of KT in inducing spiggin
and kidney epithelium hypertrophy as well as male reproductive behavior in three-spined stickleback [12,13,37].
In contrast to estrogen receptors that are auto-regulated by
estrogens, AR is not generally up-regulated by androgens
and no ARE have been found in the promoter or 5'-flanking region of cloned AR. While AR is generally transcriptionally down regulated by androgens, the protein halflife appears to be increased by androgens [38,39]. Autoregulation has, however, been observed in some tissues,
including rat ventral prostate [40], the Harderian gland
located in the orbital cavity of the golden hamster [41],
male rat forebrain [42], human bone cells [43] and Atlantic croaker brain [44]. ARE have been identified in the
coding region of AR cDNA from rat and shown to be functional, but require interaction with Myc family protein
[45]. The ARE sequences (5'-TGTCCT-3') and
(5'AGTACTCC-3') are separated by 182 bp in the rat AR
cDNA and highly similar sequences are also found in
other species, including the three-spined stickleback.
However, despite the presence of possible AREs in the AR
cDNA we did not observe any auto-regulation of kidney
AR by androgens. E2 was the only steroid tested that
altered AR mRNA and protein levels. Down-regulation of
AR by estrogens is a common feature of AR, and E2 was
shown to reduce both the AR mRNA and protein levels of
stickleback kidney. This could be a component in the
mechanism by which estrogens can suppress kidney
hypertrophy in the stickleback [46]. In the present study
we found no evidence that upregulation of AR mRNA or
protein stability contributes to the KT specificity of spiggin
induction. Thus, the stickleback AR is the first example of
an AR preferentially activated by KT in any animal. Our
results indicate that auto-regulation is not involved in this
phenomenon. However, the lower binding affinity of KT
than either DHT or T to sex steroid binding proteins in the
circulation may be a contributing factor in vivo. As these
proteins are not present in the in vitro systems the presently observed differences in ligand dependent transcriptional activation cannot be due to transport proteins.
Summary
The present study indicates the presence of a single gene
coding for a nuclear AR in the three-spined stickleback.
Furthermore, while the results show that the receptor has
the highest binding affinity for DHT, it is preferentially
activated by KT. While the present study represents the
first identification of an AR preferentially regulated by KT,

the elucidation of the KT signaling mechanism in teleosts
clearly requires further research.
