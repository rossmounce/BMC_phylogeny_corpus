Abstract
Background: The genus Listeria includes two closely related pathogenic and non-pathogenic
species, L. monocytogenes and L. innocua. L. monocytogenes is an opportunistic human foodborne and
animal pathogen that includes two common lineages. While lineage I is more commonly found
among human listeriosis cases, lineage II appears to be overrepresented among isolates from foods
and environmental sources. This study used the genome sequences for one L. innocua strain and
four L. monocytogenes strains representing lineages I and II, to characterize the contributions of
positive selection and recombination to the evolution of the L. innocua/L. monocytogenes core
genome.
Results: Among the 2267 genes in the L. monocytogenes/L. innocua core genome, 1097 genes
showed evidence for recombination and 36 genes showed evidence for positive selection. Positive
selection was strongly associated with recombination. Specifically, 29 of the 36 genes under positive
selection also showed evidence for recombination. Recombination was more common among
isolates in lineage II than lineage I; this trend was confirmed by sequencing five genes in a larger
isolate set. Positive selection was more abundant in the ancestral branch of lineage II (20 genes) as
compared to the ancestral branch of lineage I (9 genes). Additional genes under positive selection
were identified in the branch separating the two species; for this branch, genes in the role category
"Cell wall and membrane biogenesis" were significantly more likely to have evidence for positive
selection. Positive selection of three genes was confirmed in a larger isolate set, which also revealed
occurrence of multiple premature stop codons in one positively selected gene involved in flagellar
motility (flaR).
Conclusion: While recombination and positive selection both contribute to evolution of L.
monocytogenes, the relative contributions of these evolutionary forces seem to differ by L.
monocytogenes lineages and appear to be more important in the evolution of lineage II, which seems
to be found in a broader range of environments, as compared to the apparently more host adapted
lineage I. Diversification of cell wall and membrane biogenesis and motility-related genes may play
a particularly important role in the evolution of L. monocytogenes.

Background
Positive selection and recombination are two evolutionary forces that are clearly important in the evolution of
many microorganisms [1-9]. A number of studies of natural bacterial populations have found evidence for positive
selection in specific genes, including in Escherichia coli
[10], Neisseria meningitides [1,11], and Listeria monocytogenes [4,9,12]. Recent whole-genome analyses of E. coli
[6,8] and Streptococcus [2] have also confirmed the importance of positive selection during evolution of these pathogens. One study specifically suggested that, in bacteria,
up to 2 × 10-5 mutations per genome, per generation, are
beneficial [5] and another study reported that more than
half of the amino acid substitutions between E. coli and
Salmonella enterica appear to have been fixed by positive
selection [3]. Furthermore, gains in fitness associated with
nonsynonymous changes have also been confirmed in in
vitro experiments [13,14]. Lateral gene transfer (LGT), followed by incorporation of homologous DNA into the
genome, appears to be common in many bacteria and
occurrence of homologous recombination has been
described in many microorganisms [1,2,4,9,11,15,16].
Bacterial populations can differ considerably in frequency
of recombination though; while some populations appear
to be panmictic (e.g., Helicobacter pylori [17]), others seem
to show much more limited recombination (e.g., Borrelia
burgdorferi [18]).
In absence of recombination, positive selection can be
inefficient due to clonal interference and/or genetic load.
In the case of "clonal interference", advantageous mutations that arise in different lineages of the same population compete against each other for fixation, which can
slow down the fixation of advantageous mutations, and
can result in loss of advantageous mutations. "Genetic
load" refers to the increase in frequency or fixation in the
population of disadvantageous mutations that are linked
to advantageous mutations. Recombination not only
allows advantageous mutations present in different lineages to be combined and fixed in the same lineage, thus
preventing clonal interference [19-23], but also can break
the linkage between the advantageous and disadvantageous mutations, thus counteracting "genetic load" [2427]. Positive selection may also play an important role in
facilitating maintenance of fragments introduced by
recombination in a given population if these fragments
confer a selective advantage to the recipient organism.
The genus Listeria includes both mammalian pathogenic
species (i.e., L. monocytogenes, a human and animal pathogen and L. ivanovii, an animal pathogen) as well as nonpathogenic species (e.g., L. innocua, L. welshimeri) [28]. L.
monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular foodborne pathogen, which can cause severe invasive human disease with
case mortality rates of 20% [29]. Adaptive immunity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/233

against L. monocytogenes is believed to be mainly cellularmediated [30], although natural antibodies also seem to
play a role in protection [31,32]. L. monocytogenes also has
the ability to grow under a wide range of environmental
stress conditions, including temperatures ranging from
0°C to 45°C [33,34], pH ranging from 4 to 9.6 [35,36]
and salt concentration of up to 10% [37], facilitating its
foodborne transmission. L. monocytogenes isolates form a
structured population with at least four phylogenetic lineages, including lineages I and II, which are common and
lineages IIIA/C and IIIB, which are rare [12,38]. Although
isolates from all four lineages have been associated with
human listeriosis, most human listeriosis cases and outbreaks have been associated with lineage I isolates, in particular those of serotype 4b [39,40]. Lineage II isolates, on
the other hand, seem to be overrepresented among isolates from foods and environmental sources, and underrepresented among human clinical cases [41,42]. These
findings suggest that lineage I isolates are more virulent
than lineage II isolates, which has been supported by a
risk assessment [43] as well as by observations that lineage
I isolates, on average, show higher measures of tissue culture pathogenicity as compared to lineage II isolates
[42,44,45]. In addition, a considerable proportion of lineage II isolates, but only few lineage I isolates, are virulence-attenuated due to nonsense and frameshift
mutations in virulence genes resulting in truncated proteins [9,46,47]. Combined, these observations have led to
the conclusions that L. monocytogenes lineage I may be
host-adapted, while lineage II may represent an environmentally-adapted group [41].
Interestingly, the pathogenic L. monocytogenes is most
closely related to the non-pathogenic L. innocua. Consequently, the L. innocua/L. monocytogenes lineage within the
genus Listeria has been used as a model system to study
the evolution of pathogenicity characteristics, including
through comparative genome analyses [48,49]. While
gene presence/absence patterns in these two sister species
have been probed through both genome sequencing [49]
and macroarray [50] studies, facilitating identification of
confirmed and putative virulence genes, evolutionary patterns of the core genome of the L. innocua/L. monocytogenes
lineage have not yet been comprehensively studied. We
used genome sequences available for L. innocua [49] as
well as for two L. monocytogenes lineage I and two lineage
II strains [49,51] to investigate the contributions of
recombination and positive selection to the evolution of
the core genome in these Listeria lineages and to gain a
better understanding of mechanism that may be important in the evolution of core genome genes during diversification of bacterial pathogens.

Methods
Genome data
Full genome sequence data for four L. monocytogenes isolates and one L. innocua isolate were used for this study
(Table 1). Protein and gene sequence data for these five
isolates were retrieved from the Comprehensive Microbial
Resource [52]. The L. monocytogenes isolates represented
two serotype 4b lineage I strains (F2365, H7858) as well
as two serotype 1/2a lineage II strains (EGD-e, F6854).
While F2365 shows at least 20 authentic mutations resulting in premature stop codons and demonstrates some
atypical invasion characteristics [53], the genome for this
strain was included in our analyses to provide us with
increased power for our analyses and an appropriate
number of sequences to perform the lineage specific analyses for positive selection. Genes with premature stop
codons were excluded from the analyses for positive selection and recombination; presence of these genes in F2365
thus did not affect our analyses. To identify orthologous
genes found in all five genomes (i.e., genes representing
members of the L. monocytogenes/L. innocua lineage core
genome), the predicted protein sequences of each gene
from each genome were clustered using BLAST and
TribeMCL [54]. Gene clusters were initially identified
using TribeMCL (run with the inflation value set at 2)
using BLAST cutoff values of 1e-150, followed by identification of clusters containing less conserved genes (using
BLAST cutoff values of 1e-100, 1e-50, and 1e-30). This
stepwise approach was used to minimize inclusion of
multiple genes from the same genome in a given cluster;
the majority of the clusters identified had no more than
one gene from each genome. Four clusters contained four
sequences from each EGD-e, CLIP 11262, F2365, and
H7858 as well as two identical or nearly sequences from
F6854 (these four sequences were considered paralogs in
F6854); only the F6854 sequence that matched the length
of the other genes in this cluster was retained. Only clusters containing five sequences, one from each genome,
were further analyzed.

Orthologs grouped in the same clusters were aligned
using the Clustal W method [55]. Alignments were
scanned for frameshift mutations, presence of stop
codons, and gene sequences with unequal length; in addition, number of informative sites, average nucleotide

diversity (π), overall identity, and identity in the first and
last 15 nucleotides were obtained for each cluster. Alignments identified as having low identities or containing
sequences with different lengths were manually evaluated
using the program BioEdit [56] and trimmed or otherwise
edited if necessary. If alignments contained frameshift
mutations generated by indels (insertion/deletion) followed by another indel that restored the original frame,
the alignment was edited by removing the region between
the frameshift mutations. Final alignments were used for
positive selection and recombination analyses as detailed
below.
Each gene cluster was also assigned to one of 19 COGs
(Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) or the category "not in COG" based on the EGD-e genome annotation available in the NCBI genome database. The effective
number of codons used in a gene (Nc), a measure of the
codon bias, was assessed using the program "chips"
implemented in the EMBOSS package [57]. Nucleotide
diversity and number of informative sites were obtained
from PhiPack outputs (see below under "Recombination
analyses"). Genes also were classified as encoding (i) cell
wall proteins, (ii) secreted proteins or (iii) membrane proteins based on the classifications listed in the LEGER database [58].
Positive selection analysis
Genes under positive selection were identified using
codeml as implemented in PAML version 3.15 [59]. The
models implemented in PAML allow for identification of
genes under positive selection (as well as specific sites that
are under positive selection in a gene) even if the overall
dN/dS ratio (ω) for a gene is < 1. We employed two types
of tests implemented in PAML to identify genes under
positive selection. An overall test for positive selection
(Test Overall; TO) was carried out using the null model
M1a (Nearly-neutral) and the alternative model M2a
(Positive selection) [60]; this test identifies genes under
positive selection in any or all of the branches of a given
phylogeny. To identify genes that are under positive selection in specific branches of the L. monocytogenes/L. innocua
phylogeny, the branch-site test2 described by Zhang et al.
[61] was used. This test was used to identify genes under
positive selection in three branches (Fig. 1), including (i)

separating L. monocytogenes and L. innocua (Test L.
innocua/L. monocytogenes; TLI/LM). Because the sequence
of the L. innocua and L. monocytogenes ancestor is
unknown, TLI/LM cannot differentiate between positive
selection in L. innocua and positive selection in the ancestor of L. monocytogenes. No test was performed to test for
evidence of positive selection among genes within a given
lineage. Initially, one universal phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1),
representing the consensus tree of the 2267 genes analyzed, was used for all PAML analyses. For all genes that
were identified as being under positive selection, genespecific trees were constructed and TO and branch-specific
PAML analyses were re-run if the gene-specific tree differed from the consensus tree. For eight genes, gene-specific trees differed from the universal tree. PAML analysis
with gene-specific trees confirmed positive selection for
five genes, while for three genes analyses with the genespecific trees did not find any evidence for positive selection (these genes were thus not considered to be under
positive selection).
For each test, nested models (one null model that does
not allow for positive selection and one alternative model
that allows for positive selection) were compared using a
Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) as described by Yang et al.
[62]. For each model, three replicates were generated and
the maximum likelihood values for each model were used
in the LRT. Genes with negative LRT values were re-run 10

Recombination analyses
Four tests were used initially to assess gene clusters for evidence of intragenic recombination, including Sawyer's
test implemented in GENECONV version 1.81 [63] as
well as Neighbor Similarity Score (NSS), Maximum χ2,
and the Pairwise Homoplasy Index (PHI), the last three
implemented in PhiPack [64]. For GENECONV analyses,
the parameter g-scale was set to 1; this setting allows polymorphisms within the recombinant fragment, increasing
the likelihood of the test to identify ancient recombination events or events where the donated recombinant fragment is similar, but not identical to the recombinant
sequence in the alignment. In the GENECONV analyses,
only inner fragments were considered. For Maximum χ2,
a fixed window size of 2/3 the number of polymorphic
sites was used. For PHI, a window size of 50 nucleotides
was used. p-values were estimated using 10,000 permutations of the alignment for GENECONV and 1,000 permutations for NSS, Maximum χ2 and PHI. Therefore, for all
recombination tests, the p-values represent the proportion
of test statistics of the permuted alignments that were at
least as extreme as the observed test statistic.

ClonalFrame version 1.1 [65] was used on selected genes
to estimate recombination breakpoints and to help identify the most likely recipients in a given recombination
event. ClonalFrame assumes that recombination events
generate new polymorphisms in the population and is
most useful for data sets where the donor of the recombinant fragment is not present in the data set [65]. Nevertheless, the program can also be used to identify
recombination between sequences in the data set,
although it might underestimate the amount of recombination in alignments where the donor and recipient are
closely related [65]. Analyses were based on two independent runs of the program both using the same settings
(100,000 burn-in iteration and data collection for an
additional 100,000 iterations; default settings were used
for all other parameters). A 95% consensus tree was
obtained from these two runs, and only those branches
present in the 95% consensus tree were analyzed for
recombination.
Statistical analyses
Correction for multiple testing was performed using the
procedure reported by Benjamini & Hochberg [66] as
implemented in the program Q-Value [67] with the proportion of expected true null hypotheses set to 1 (π0 = 1).

Page 4 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:233

For each p-value, the q-value (the expected proportion of
false positives among the significant tests) was calculated.
Corrections were performed separately for each test (e.g.,
GENECONV, NSS, etc.; TO, TLI/LM, etc.) to account for
testing of multiple genes (i.e., 2237 genes). As the tests
used for positive selection are already conservative [61], a
false discovery rate (FDR) of 20% was used for the positives selection analyses. For recombination analyses, an
FDR of 10% was used to compensate the fact that no correction for multiple tests (Sawyer's test, NSS, Maximum χ2
and PHI) was carried out due to the high correlation
among the tests.
Correlation between COGs and positive selection, recombination, and gene parameters (e.g., gene length, codon
bias, nt diversity) were carried out using chi-square tests,
Fisher's exact tests, and U-tests implemented in SAS. For
association between genes in a given COG category,
COGs that were numerically overrepresented among
genes under recombination or positive selection were
tested for the significance of associations using one-sided
tests; Bonferroni corrections were performed based on the
number of one-sided tests performed. Significance was set
at 5%.
Confirmation of positive selection and recombination
patterns in selected genes in a larger isolate population
To probe whether the positive selection and recombination patterns determined using genome wide analyses on
five isolates were representative for larger populations, a
diverse set of 40 additional L. monocytogenes isolates
(Additional file 1) was assembled and used to determine
the sequences for five genes (i.e., cheA, phoP, lmo0693, flaR
and lmo2537) for positive selection and recombination
analyses. Isolates were selected to represent the genetic
diversity of L. monocytogenes, including lineage I (19 isolates), II (13 isolates), IIIA/C (5 isolates), and IIIB (3 isolates), as well as diverse sources (e.g., foods, human
clinical cases; see Additional file 1). Experiments with biohazardous materials were approved by the Cornell Institutional Biosafety Committee (MUA #15520). Nucleotide
sequences for these five genes have been deposited in
GenBank as alignments (PopSet accession numbers
164520363, 164520263, 164520173, 164520083,
164519993).

PCR amplification of the five selected genes was carried
out using primers and conditions described in Additional
file 2. PCR fragments were purified using Exonuclease I
(0.5 U/μl) and Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (0.05 U/μl)
(USB, NEB) and sequenced (at the Biotechnology
Resource Center, Cornell University) using Big Dye Terminator chemistry and AmpliTaq-FS DNA Polymerase and
an automated 3730 DNA Analyzer. Sequences were proofread and aligned using Clustal W using Seqman and Meg-

align, as implemented in Lasergene 7.2.1. Alignments
were used for positive selection and recombination analyses as described above.
Swarming assays
Swarming assays were performed with six isolates representing each of the six different mutations leading to premature stop codons (i.e., FSL C1-057, FSL F2-649, FSL E1123, FSL F2-663, FSL S4-766 and FSL F2-086), three isolates bearing full length flaR (i.e. 10403S, FSL F2-661 and
FSL J1-208), and a non-motile isogenic 10403S ΔflaA
strain [68], which harbors an in-frame deletion of the
gene that encodes the flagellin subunit in L. monocytogenes. We furthermore constructed an isogenic in-frame
flaR null mutant in L. monocytogenes 10403S background
using Splicing-by-Overlap (SOEing) PCR and allelic
exchange, as previously described [69] for use in swarming assays.

Swarming abilities of L. monocytogenes strains were evaluated on semi-soft agar. Strains were initially grown for 24
h at 37°C on BHI agar and colonies were used to stabinoculate BHI semi-soft agar (0.4%). Swarming ability
was assessed by measuring colony area using SigmaScan
Pro 5.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) for each strain after incubation at room temperature for 48 h. Swarming area for
each mutant strain was normalized to the swarming area
for strain 10403S, which was set at 100%.

Results
Initial identification and characterization of the L.
monocytogenes/L. innocua core genome
Using BLAST and TribeMCL (as detailed in the "Methods"), we identified 2267 orthologous genes present in all
five genomes, representing an initial definition of the core
genome for the L. monocytogenes/L. innocua lineage. The
orthologs were highly syntenic in the two L. monocytogenes
lineages and L. innocua (Fig. 2A). The 2267 orthologous
genes identified represent 76% of the coding genes identified in L. innocua CLIP11262 and 80% of the coding
genes identified in L. monocytogenes EGD-e and F2365
(i.e., the two closed L. monocytogenes genomes). Thirty of
the 2267 genes in the core genome had ≤ 1 informative
site and were thus not used in subsequent analyses; a final
set of 2237 genes was thus used in all genome-wide analyses (shown in green in Fig. 2B).

Genes in COGs "Energy production and conversion",
"Amino acid transport and metabolism", "Carbohydrate
transport and metabolism", "Replication, recombination
and repair", "Defense mechanisms", and "Cell wall/membrane biogenesis" showed a significant tendency to be
longer than genes in other COGs (Table 2). Although
genes categorized into the COGs "Amino acid transport
and metabolism", "General functional prediction",

(1) ">" or "<" indicates the direction of the one-sided tests (i.e. column "> Codon bias" shows Bonferroni-corrected p-values for associations
between genes in a given COG and higher codon bias (as compared to the genes in other COGs), while the column "< Codon bias" test shows
Bonferroni-corrected p-values for genes in COGs with lower codon bias as compared to genes in other COGs; "ND" = Not determined (tests
were not performed for COGs that showed values that were not consistent with the tested alternative hypothesis, e.g., if the average gene length
for genes in a given COG was below average than we did not test for an association of this COG with increased gene length); "NS". Not significant.
(2)Tests for codon bias were performed using Nc values; a lower Nc indicates increased codon bias.

"Defense mechanisms", "Coenzyme transport and metabolism", "Replication, recombination and repair", and
"Cell wall/membrane biogenesis" showed a significant
tendency for a greater number of informative sites than
the genes in other COGs (Table 2), only genes in the last
three COGs showed a significant tendency for a higher
average genetic diversity (π)(Table 2).

Genes categorized into the COGs "Energy production and
conversion", "Translation", and "Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperone" showed a significant tendency for a higher codon bias (Table 2), possibly
reflecting their housekeeping roles and higher expression
rates [70-72]. Conversely, genes in the COGs "Coenzyme
transport and metabolism", "Transcription", and "Signal

transduction mechanisms" showed a tendency for lower
codon bias (Table 2), possibly because these genes are not
constitutively expressed and are not highly expressed in
the cell, lowering the constraint for preferential codons
usage [70-72].
A considerable number of L. monocytogenes and L.
innocua genes show evidence for recombination
Among the 2237 orthologs tested, 1097 genes (representing approx. 49% of the genes in the L. monocytogenes/L.
innocua core genome) showed significant evidence (FDR <
10%) for recombination in at least one of the four recombination tests used (these genes are shown in red in Fig.
2b). GENECONV, NSS, Maximum χ2 and PHI identified
508, 460, 900, and 252 orthologs, respectively, with significant evidence for recombination. A total of 516, 282,
156, and 143 orthologs showed significant evidence for
recombination in one, two, three and all four tests, respectively. Genes with evidence for recombination showed a
tendency to have longer alignments (P < 0.001; One-sided
U-Test), lower codon bias (P = 0.013), higher nucleotide
diversity (P < 0.001), and more informative sites (P <
0.001) then genes with no evidence for recombination.
These findings are consistent with the expectation that, by
chance, shorter genes are less likely to be involved in intragenic recombination, but also the observation that shorter
sequences provides less power in the analyses for evidence
of recombination [64,73].

When genes that encode for (i) cell wall proteins, (ii)
secreted proteins or (iii) membrane proteins (based on
the listings in LEGER) were tested for their prevalence
among genes with evidence for recombination, these
three genes classes (i.e., cell wall proteins, secreted proteins, and membrane proteins) were under-represented (P
= 0.002, P = 0.001, and P = 0.013, respectively; one-sided
Fisher's exact test) among the 1097 genes with significant
evidence for recombination, suggesting that these genes
are less likely to have experienced recombination.
Genes in three COGs are overrepresented among the
genes that show evidence for a history of recombination
(Table 3). For example, the "Carbohydrate transport and

metabolism" COG was significantly overrepresented
among the 1097 genes with evidence for recombination
in at least one of the four tests (P = 0.012). Genes in this
COG were also significantly more likely to have low p-values (indicative of significant evidence for recombination)
as compared to genes in the other COGs for each of the
four tests (as determined by U-tests; see Table 3). For three
tests (NSS, Maximum χ2, and PHI), genes in the "Amino
acid transport and metabolism" COG were significantly
more likely to have low p-values (indicative of significant
evidence for recombination), as compared to genes in the
other COGs, respectively (Table 3). These data may indicate that recombination allows L. monocytogenes and L.
innocua to rapidly generate and acquire diversity in genes
involved in carbohydrate and amino acid transport and
metabolism, which may facilitate adaptation to environments that differ in nutrient availability (e.g., host and
non-host associated environments). As these two COGs
also showed a tendency to have longer genes, the association between these COGs and recombination could also
be due to an increased power to detect recombination.
Thirty-six L. monocytogenes and L. innocua genes show
evidence for positive selection
PAML identified 36 genes under positive selection (FDR <
20%) with either the overall test (TO) or the branch specific tests, including one gene (lmo2178) identified with
two branch specific tests and one gene (lmo0782) identified with TO and two branch specific tests (Table 4). Three
genes were identified as being under positive selection
with the overall test (TO). Seven were identified with the
L. innocua test (TLI/LM), 9 with the L. monocytogenes lineage I ancestor test (TLM1A), and 20 with the L. monocytogenes lineage II ancestor test (TLM2A). Genes under
positive selection showed a tendency to have more
informative sites and to be longer than genes not under
positive selection (P = 0.001 and P = 0.031; one-sided UTest), probably as these two factors may increase the
power of the test for positive selection. Positive selection
was not associated with nucleotide diversity or codon
bias.

affect the validity of the Likelihood Ratio Test, which was used to identify the genes under positive selection (Z. Yang, pers. Communication; see
http://gsf.gc.ucdavis.edu/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=2079&sid=c4a82e1ca334ca84a00a8b85e0f33c9d and http://gsf.gc.ucdavis.edu/

(4) Proportion of sites under positive selection
(5) This column lists sites identified using Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) as being under positive selection; numbers identify the amino acid sites (in
alignments) that are under positive selection

While eight of the genes under positive selection (i.e.,
lmo0098, lmo0653, lmo0782. lmo0785, lmo1424, lmo1529,
lmo2215, and lmo2596) encode membrane proteins [74],
neither genes that encode for cell wall proteins nor genes
that encode for secreted proteins or membrane proteins
(based on the listings in LEGER) were significantly overrepresented among the 36 genes under positive selection
(one-sided Fisher's exact test). One COG, "Signal transduction mechanisms", had a significant association with
positive selection (nominal P = 0.008; one-sided Fisher's
exact test) though, suggesting an enrichment for genes
under positive selection in this category. However, after
correction for multiple comparisons, the association is
not significant (P = 0.098; Bonferroni correction). Because
of the low number of genes under positive selection, it
was not possible to assess the association between positive selection and most COGs. We thus assessed whether
the distribution of the p-values for each test deviates from
the random distribution for any of the COGs using a Utest. After Bonferroni correction, none of the COGs
showed evidence for association with lower p-values
(indicating evidence for positive selection) for either the
lineage I (TLM1A) or the lineage II branch test (TLM2A).
While three COGs (i.e., "Cell wall/membrane biogenesis", "Coenzyme transport and metabolism", and
"Amino acid transport and metabolism") were associated
with lower p-values for the TLI/LM test (see Fig. 3), only
the association for the "Cell wall/membrane biogenesis"
COG was significant after Bonferroni correction (nominal
P = 0.004; Bonferroni corrected P = 0.036). Importantly,
genes in this COG were not significantly associated with

evidence for recombination, suggesting that a significant
tendency for these genes to be under positive selection
was not driven by an enrichment of genes with a history
of recombination.
Among the 36 genes that showed evidence for positive
selection, 29 genes also showed evidence for recombination, including five genes for which only one of the four
recombination tests was significant. Statistical analyses
showed that genes with evidence for recombination were
overrepresented among the 36 genes found to be under
positive selection (chi-square, P < 0.001). Among the
seven genes with evidence for positive selection and no
evidence for recombination, five and two genes showed
evidence for positive selection in the lineage II ancestral
branch and the L. monocytogenes/L. innocua branch, respectively; none of these genes showed evidence for positive
selection in the lineage I ancestral branch.
Core genome genes encoding MHC antigen do not show
evidence for positive selection
The six core genome genes encoding antigens known to
induce adaptive cellular immunity against L. monocytogenes in mice [75-82] were evaluated for evidence for
positive selection. Epitopes in these antigens are presented to CD8+ or CD4+ T cells through MHC class Ia, Ib
or II molecules. One MHC antigen (a putative 23 aa leader
peptide encoded by a transcription attenuator upstream
of lmo2165) showed no nonsynonymous changes and
was thus not formally tested for positive selection. The
other five MHC antigens (p60, encoded by iap; LemA,

Moreover, the protein alignment of these five antigens
showed no amino acid changes in the major epitope
regions.
Lineage II strains harbor more recombinant fragments
than lineage I strains
While the four recombination tests detailed above
showed that a considerable number of genes in the L.
monocytogenes/L. innocua core genome had evidence for
recombination, these analyses did not allow for easy
determination of the recipient strain and thus did not permit us to test the hypothesis that L. monocytogenes lineages
differ in their frequency of gene fragment acquisition by
recombination. ClonalFrame allows for identification of
the recipient strains in recombination events and was thus
used to analyze a set of 40 randomly selected genes (clpX,

lmo0343, lmo0405, pflC, phoP, lmo1436, lmo1460,

for evidence of recombination and to determine the recipient strains in the recombination events that were identified. Due to computational constraints, testing larger
number of genes was not easily feasible. The 40 genes
were randomly chosen from a set of 1227 genes that
showed no evidence for positive selection, had at least 5
informative sites and had alignment lengths between 600
and 1400 nucleotides. Among the 40 genes selected, 20
showed evidence for recombination in the genome-wide
analysis. As recipient lineages cannot be reliably determined for recombination events in the lineage I and II
ancestral branches, we only analyzed recombination
events in the external branches (Fig. 4). Eleven recombination events were identified in the two lineage II strains

(five in F6854 and six in EGD-e), while no recombination
events were identified in the two lineage I strains (H7858
or F2365); in this data set, lineage I is thus significantly
less likely to have recombination events as compared to
lineage II (P < 0.001; Fisher's exact test).
Analyses of five gene sequences obtained for 40 L.
monocytogenes isolates confirm positive selection and
recombination patterns observed in the genome-wide
analyses
Five genes (Table 5) were selected for sequencing in a set
of 40 L. monocytogenes isolates (representing lineage and
source diversity; see Additional file 1) to confirm the positive selection and recombination patterns observed in the

genome-wide analyses. The five genes chosen for these
analyses included (i) cheA (lmo0692), which showed significant evidence for recombination (all tests significant)
and positive selection with TLM1A; (ii) lmo0693, which
showed evidence for positive selection with TLM2A and
had no evidence for recombination; (iii) flaR (lmo1412),
which showed evidence for positive selection with TLM2A
and no evidence for recombination; (iv) lmo2537, which
showed significant evidence for recombination with Maximum χ2 but no evidence for positive selection; and (v)
phoP (lmo2501), which showed evidence for recombination with GENECONV but showed no evidence for positive selection. Positive selection and recombination
analyses were performed with gene alignments containing

(1) Analyses were performed using an alignment of these 5 genes for the 40 L. monocytogenes isolates, for which these genes were sequenced here
(see Supp. Table 1), as well as the four L. monocytogenes and one L. innocua strain for which full genome sequences were available (Table 1).
(2) NSS: Neighbour Similarity Score; Max χ2: Maximum χ2; PHI: Pairwise Homoplasy Index; GENECONV performed with g-scale = 1 did not show
significant inner fragments for any of the five genes, however four genes showed significant inner fragments in GENECONV performed with g-scale
= 2, these p-values are reported here. The g-scale setting in GENECONV is associated with the number of polymorphisms allowed in a putative
recombinant fragment; more polymorphisms are allowed as the g-scale value decreases from 3 to 1,

45 sequences (40 gene sequences determined here as well
as the respective gene sequences from the four L. monocytogenes and the one L. innocua genome [Table 1]).
Three genes (lmo2537, phoP, and cheA) showed significant
evidence for recombination with all four recombination
analyses (i.e., GENECONV, NSS, Maximum χ2, and PHI),
consistent with the genome-wide analyses, which also
found evidence for recombination in these genes. While
flaR showed no evidence for recombination in the
genome-wide analyses, analyses of the 45 flaR sequences
showed significant evidence for recombination with Maximum χ2, PHI, and GENECONV (Table 5); these findings
suggest that at least some of the additional flaR sequences
represent recombinant alleles. Based on the 45 sequences,
lmo0693 showed marginally significant evidence for
recombination with NSS (P = 0.033) and no evidence for
recombination with the other three methods, largely consistent with the genome-wide recombination analyses,
which found no evidence for recombination in this gene.

ClonalFrame analysis on a concatenated alignment of the
five genes (for all 45 isolates) identified 7, 2, 2, and 3
recombination events in the external branches for cheA,
phoP, flaR, and lmo2537. No recombination events were
identified in external branches for lmo0693. The recombination events identified in branches other than the ancestral branches leading to a given lineage involved 1, 7, 3,
and 3 lineage I, II, IIIA/C, and IIIB branches as recipients
in recombination events, respectively. Lineage II strains
were significantly more likely to be involved as recipients
in recombination events as compared to lineage I strains
(P = 0.013, Fisher's exact test). ClonalFrame also allowed
us to estimate the relative rate of recombination over
mutation for these five genes. While, on average, mutations are 4.5 times more common than recombination
events (95% IC = {3.0; 7.3}), a recombination event is 1.9
times more likely to change a single nucleotide than a
point mutation (95% IC = {1.27; 2.6}).
Analyses of positive selection on the 45 sequences for the
five genes yielded results similar to those obtained in the
genome-wide analyses. As in the genome-wide analyses,

we found no evidence for positive selection in the 45
sequences for lmo2537 and phoP. For lmo0693 and flaR,
the lineage II ancestral branch was identified as evolving
by positive selection (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively; the same branches were identified as being under
positive selection in the genome-wide analyses). In
lmo0693, two adjacent aa sites (17 and 18) were identified
as being under positive selection, including one site identified with a posterior probability > 95% (Table 5). In flaR,
three amino acid sites were identified as evolving by positive selection in the lineage II ancestral branch, including
one site identified with a posterior probability > 95%
(Table 5). While the genome-wide analysis for cheA found
evidence for positive selection in the lineage I ancestral
branch, analysis of the 45 sequences did not find evidence
for positive selection in this branch (P = 0.207), but found
significant evidence (P < 0.001) for positive selection in
the ancestral branch that leads to lineages I and IIIA/C isolates (branch B, Fig. 5), a branch that was not present in
the tree used in the genome-wide analyses (due to the
absence of lineage IIIA/C strains in that data set). A single
amino acid site was identified as evolving by positive
selection in cheA (posterior probability > 95%; Table 5);
isolates in lineage I and IIIA/C have glutamine at this site,
while all other isolates, including L. innocua CLIP11262,
bear an alanine. This amino acid site lies within the P2
domain of the CheA protein, which is the binding site for
the response regulator, CheY; cheY itself seems to be
extremely conserved (with no nonsynonymous change
among the five strains included in the genome-wide analyses).
Interestingly, all three aa sites identified in flaR, lmo0693,
and cheA as being under positive selection with posterior
probabilities > 95%, involved nucleotide substitutions at
all three codon positions (e.g., cheA aa site 140 GCC →
CAG). These findings suggest that these codons evolved
rapidly in the branches under positive selection. The
nucleotide diversity in synonymous sites ranged from
0.141 to 0.151 among the three genes with evidence for
positive selection while the nucleotide diversity in the
synonymous sites of lmo2537 and phoP, which showed no
significant evidence for positive selection, were 0.338 and
0.449, respectively. This suggests that significant tests for
positive selection were not due to higher rates of synonymous substitutions, which could result in an underestimation of the number of synonymous changes due to
recurrent mutations in synonymous sites.
Unrelated L. monocytogenes isolates carry
independently acquired premature stop codons in flaR
Among the 45 L. monocytogenes flaR sequences, we identified six sequences with distinct premature stop codons in
flaR (Fig. 5), including five caused by frameshift mutations and one due to a nonsense mutation. The mutations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/233

leading to the premature stop codon were found in different regions of the sequence (Additional file 3). While one
of these frameshift mutations was found in two isolates
(FSL S4-766 and FSL N4-015, two closely related lineage
II strains [Fig. 5]), all other mutations were only identified
in one isolate each. flaR premature stop codons were
found in different L. monocytogenes lineages, including lineage I (one frameshift and the nonsense mutation), lineage II (three different frameshift mutations), and lineage
IIIB (one frameshift mutation) isolates. The isolates carrying premature stop codons in flaR were from human clinical cases (n = 4), animals (n = 2) and natural
environment (n = 1). No statistical association could be
identified between the presence of premature stop codon
and source of the isolate (Fisher's exact test).
Since flaR has been previously shown to be involved in L.
monocytogenes motility [83], swarming experiments were
conducted to assess the swarming ability of six isolates
presenting each of the six different mutations leading to
premature stop codons, three isolates bearing full length
flaR and an isogenic flaR null mutant. Isolates harboring
naturally occurring premature stop codons in flaR
showed, on average, significantly reduced swarming areas
(P < 0.001; One-sided U-Test) and FSL F2-649, which harbor a premature stop codon in flaR due to a nonsense
mutation, had the smallest swarming area among all natural isolates (P < 0.001; One-sided U-Test). Even though
all isolates with flaR premature stop codons still showed
some swarming and the 10403S ΔflaR showed no significant reduction in swarming ability, these findings suggest
that the frameshift mutations in flaR may affect motility,
at least in some strains.

Discussion
We have chosen two closely related species within the
genus Listeria, i.e., the pathogen L. monocytogenes and the
non-pathogenic L. innocua, as a model system to further
probe the evolution of bacterial pathogens using a comparative genomics approach. While comparative genomics approaches have provided important data on the
importance of gene acquisitions in the evolution of bacterial pathogens in general [2,84,85] and in the evolution of
L. monocytogenes in particular (e.g., by identifying a
number of virulence genes associated with pathogenic Listeria spp.), our understanding of the contributions of
recombination and positive selection to the evolution of
the L. monocytogenes/L. innocua core genome has been limited so far.
Recombination and positive selection both contribute to
evolution of L. monocytogenes, but the relative

diverged earlier from the other isolates. Internal branches that showed evidence for recombination are labeled from A to J.

contribution of these evolutionary forces differs among L.
monocytogenes lineages
Overall, almost half of the genes present in L. monocytogenes/L. innocua core genome showed evidence for intragenic recombination (location of these genes is shown in
Fig. 2). Only a much smaller proportion of the genes in
the core genome (1.7%) showed evidence for positive
selection. By comparison, a recent genomic study on the
genus Streptococcus reported evidence for recombination
in 18 to 37% of the genes in the core genome and evidence for positive selection in 11 to 34% of the genes in
the core genome. This study was able to use a larger
number of genome sequences (i.e., 26 genomes) and used
different criteria for selection of genes with significant evidence for positive selection and recombination (i.e. only
genes significant by all three tests for recombination were
considered as recombinants) though [2]. While a comparison of the frequency of genes with evidence of recombination between Listeria and Helicobacter pylori, which
appears to be panmictic [17], will be of interest, no
genome wide studies of recombination in Helicobacter
have been reported to date. In both gene-specific and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) studies, evidence has previously been found for contributions of recombination to
the evolution of different L. monocytogenes genes, even
though many of the genes identified as having an apparent history of recombination appear to be lineage and species specific, including a number of genes in the internalin
family [4,9] and the prfA virulence gene cluster [12].
While some studies also have identified housekeeping
genes with significant evidence for recombination [12],
the magnitude of recombination in Listeria on a genomewide level has not previously been known. Interestingly, it
seems that although homologous recombination between
closely related strains of L. monocytogenes is common,
non-homologous recombination seems to be rare given
the high synteny of the different Listeria genomes [[51],
this study] and the relatively small number of strain and
lineage specific genes (e.g., [83] and [51] genes specific to
serotype 1/2a and 4b strains, respectively [51]). While
others have also previously observed positive selection in
L. monocytogenes, all previously identified genes under
positive selection were virulence genes (i.e., actA, inlA,
inlB, inlC, inlC2 and inlF) [4,9,12], which were specific to
L. monocytogenes or selected L. monocytogenes lineages. We
are thus the first to identify genes in the core genome
which are under positive selection, indicating that positive selection does not just act on accessory and virulence
genes.

Overall, most genes in the core genome found to be under
positive selection also showed evidence for recombination; an association of recombination and positive selection was also previously observed in a genome-wide study
on the evolution of genes in the genus Streptococcus [2].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/233

Occurrence of both positive selection and recombination
in specific genes has also previously been reported for
selected L. monocytogenes virulence genes [4,9] as well as in
other microorganisms [1,2,10,11,16].
While it has been shown that high recombination rates
can lead to false positives in overall analysis using PAML,
such as the TO test [86], no studies have evaluated the
effect of recombination on the branch-site tests and it is
unclear how recombination affects this analysis. The fact
that, in our analyses, more than 1000 genes showed evidence for recombination but no evidence for positive
selection suggests that the positively selected genes identified harbor distinct features that allowed their identification. As previously pointed out [2,9], some horizontally
transferred fragments may also be more likely to be under
positive selection, and positive selection may be important for fixation of recombinant gene and/or for adaptation of the newly acquired genes or alleles to a different
function.
In analyses of sequence data for 40 genes, lineage II strains
were significantly more likely to be identified as recipients
of DNA fragments by horizontal gene transfer, indicating
either more frequent lateral gene transfer or more frequent fixation of recombinant fragments. Higher frequency of recombinant fragments among lineage II
strains has also previously been described for L. monocytogenes specific virulence genes (e.g., internalin genes
[4,9]) and for some housekeeping genes [87]. The genetic
basis of the promiscuity of lineage II isolates is currently
unknown but it might be related to the observation that
lineage II isolates appear to be overrepresented in foods,
farms and natural environments [41], where Listeria bacteriophages (listeriophages) may be common due to the
frequent presence of L. monocytogenes in some of these
environments [88,89]. While listeriophages can perform
generalized transduction [90], transduction between isolates of serotypes 1/2a and 4b has not been shown. Most
listeriophages appear to be serotype-specific and phage
host-specificity could account for the differences in
recombination frequency between lineages. Alternatively,
lineage I strains might have a more effective restriction
systems for degradation of foreign DNA, a more efficient
mismatch repair system that avoids incorporation of foreign DNA fragments into the chromosome, or may show
reduced competency.
Our genome-wide analyses also indicated that positive
selection occurred in more genes in the ancestral branch
of lineage II as compared to the ancestral branch of lineage I. Interestingly, one gene with evidence for positive
selection in the ancestral branch of lineage II encodes a
putative transcriptional antiterminator of the BglG family
(lmo0297). As another antiterminator of the BglG family

Page 16 of 21

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:233

(BvrA), which is only present in lineage II isolates [50],
has been shown to be involved in cellobiose-dependent
repression of PrfA-dependent virulence genes in L. monocytogenes [91], lmo0297 may have evolved to facilitate specific transcriptional repression functions in lineage II.
Positive selection in the lineage II ancestral branch was
further confirmed for two genes (flaR, lmo0693) in a larger
isolate set. As lineage II strains are found in many different
environments, including natural environment, farms,
foods, animals with clinical disease, as well as human
clinical cases (although less frequently than lineage I isolates) [41], one could hypothesize that lineage II isolates
are exposed to a more diverse repertoire of distinct selective pressures than lineage I strains, which appear to be
less common in natural environments and foods and
seem to be more likely to be adapted to human or mammalian hosts [41,42].
Diversification, by multiple mechanisms, of cell wall/
membrane biogenesis and motility-related genes may play
a particularly important role in the evolution of L.
monocytogenes
In our study, genes involved in cell wall/membrane biogenesis showed a significant tendency to be identified as
being under positive selection in the L. monocytogenes/L.
innocua branch, suggesting that positive selection in these
genes contributed to the divergence of these two species.
L. monocytogenes genes encoding proteins involved in cell
wall metabolism and encoding cell wall-anchored proteins have also previously been identified as harboring
more nonsynonymous changes than genes involved in
other functions [51], further supporting an important role
for diversification of these gene categories in the evolution
of L. monocytogenes. Specific surface associated proteins
identified as being under positive selection included
genes involved in transport of carbohydrates such as
mptD, which appears to be involved in resistance to class
IIa bacteriocins [92,93]. Class IIa bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides frequently produced by lactic acid bacteria in foods [93], and resistance to these compounds are
likely to confer an advantage to L. monocytogenes isolates
in foods and environments. In addition, a putative glycosyl transferase (lmo2121) was identified as having evolved
by positive selection in lineage I; glycosyl transferases
could be associated with the differences in the somatic
antigens in different serotypes and might be associated
with strain differences in virulence and immunogenicity
[51,94-96]. Functionally, active and rapid evolution of
genes involved in cell wall/membrane biogenesis is likely
to be important to allow bacteria to adapt to different and
possibly rapidly changing environments, including, but
not limited to, competing microorganisms as well as
innate and adaptive immune system effectors in different
host species. Our findings are consistent with a recent
genome-wide study, which showed that most E. coli pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/233

teins that undergo positive selection are exposed on the
cell surface, including a number of proteins known to
interact with bacterial, host, or phage surface molecules
[8].
A number of genes involved in flagellar synthesis and
motility (e. g., flaR, lmo0693 and cheA) also showed evidence for positive selection, including when these genes
were analyzed in a larger set of more diverse isolates.
lmo0693, cheA and several other genes involved in motility and chemotaxis have also been found to be expressed
more highly in four lineage I strains as compared to two
lineage II strains [97], further suggesting a difference in
regulation of motility and chemotaxis functions between
the two lineages. Motility and flagellar expression appear
to contribute to both biofilm formation [98] and host
cells invasion [68,99,100] in L. monocytogenes, and diversification in these genes is likely to be important for adaptation to different host or non-host environments.
Interestingly, seven isolates showed premature stop
codons in flaR, including six due to frameshift mutations
and one due to a nonsense mutation. While FlaR has been
reported to be a histone-like protein that regulates transcription of the flagellin gene flaA in L. monocytogenes serotype 1/2c lineage II strain LO28 (as determined in a
transposon mutant; [83]), a non-polar flaR null mutant in
a serotype 1/2a lineage II strain (generated in our study
reported here) did not show reduced motility at room
temperature, even though the LO28 flaR mutant was
reported to be non-motile at this temperature [83]. As
shown here, natural isolates with premature stop codons
in flaR showed, though, on average, significant reduced
ability to swarm as compared to isolates harboring a fulllength gene. flaR thus seems to have strain or perhaps
serotype or lineage specific functions in L. monocytogenes
and flaR inactivation in some strains is likely to be recent
since most frameshift/nonsense mutations are isolate and
not clade-specific. Alternatively, some or all frameshift
and nonsense mutations could be reversible and flaR
might be phase-variable, a tempting hypothesis as phasevariable flagella-related genes have been described in a
number of other bacteria [101-104]. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that inlA, which encodes another
L. monocytogenes surface protein that promotes mammalian host cell invasion, also carries several different premature stop codons in both lineage I and II strains [9,46,105108]. The isolates with truncated InlA seem to be more
common in foods [46] and show significantly reduced
invasiveness for human intestinal epithelial cells [46],
suggesting reduced virulence of these strains. Diversification by both positive selection and gene inactivation of
genes encoding surface molecules with a role in virulence
thus appears to be broadly important in the adaptation of
L. monocytogenes to host and non-host associated environments.

Conclusion
Our analyses reported here indicate that both recombination and positive selection contribute to the evolution of
the L. monocytogenes/L. innocua core genome. While considerably more genes appear to be affected by recombination, positive selection still appears to play an important
role in the evolution of both genes in the core genome
(this study) as well as L. monocytogenes virulence genes
that are not part of the core genome [4,9,12]. The list of
genes identified as being under positive selection hopefully can be used by the scientific community to advance
the discovery of genetic factors that allow this organism to
adapt to diverse environments and hosts. In particular,
our data suggest important roles for positive selection and
diversification of genes encoding proteins associated with
the cell wall and membrane biosynthesis on the evolution
of L. monocytogenes.
Overall, genes in lineage I isolates were less likely to be
affected by either recombination or positive selection,
possibly reflecting that this lineage has experienced a
recent bottleneck, as previously proposed [87]. Frequent
recombination in combination with positive selection of
some genes in lineage II strains, on the other hand, may
be important for the evolution of this generalist lineage,
which is present in many different environments and
host, including human clinical cases (although less common than lineage I). In combination with previous studies that have shown considerable differences in frequency
of recombination and positive selection among different
Streptococcus lineages and species [2], our findings further
show that even closely related bacterial lineages may differ
in mechanisms contributing to their evolution.
