2011 German Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak:
whole-genome phylogeny without alignment
Man-Kit Cheung, Lei Li, Wenyan Nong and Hoi-Shan Kwan*

Abstract
Background: A large-scale Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak occurred in Germany from May to July 2011, causing
numerous cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and deaths. Genomes of ten outbreak isolates and a
historical O104:H4 strain isolated in 2001 were sequenced using different new generation sequencing platforms.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using various approaches which either are not genome-wide or may be
subject to errors due to poor sequence alignment. Also, detailed pathogenicity analyses on the 2001 strain were
not available.
Findings: We reconstructed the phylogeny of E. coli using the genome-wide and alignment-free feature frequency
profile method and revealed the 2001 strain to be the closest relative to the 2011 outbreak strain among all
available E. coli strains at present and confirmed findings from previous alignment-based phylogenetic studies that
the HUS-causing O104:H4 strains are more closely related to typical enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) than to
enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Detailed re-examination of pathogenicity-related virulence factors and secreted proteins
showed that the 2001 strain possesses virulence factors shared between typical EAEC and the 2011 outbreak strain.
Conclusions: Our study represents the first attempt to elucidate the whole-genome phylogeny of the 2011
German outbreak using an alignment-free method, and suggested a direct line of ancestry leading from a putative
EAEC-like ancestor through the 2001 strain to the 2011 outbreak strain.

Background
In early May 2011, a large outbreak of diarrhea with associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) began in Germany. Until its official end in late July, 782 cases of HUS
(29 deaths) and 3128 non-HUS cases (17 deaths) were
reported, making it the largest outbreak of HUS worldwide
[1]. Diarrhea associated with HUS is usually caused by
enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) [2]. However, the outbreak strain was serotyped to be O104:H4, which historically caused very few HUS cases [3]. Early PCR assay and
cell-adherence assay revealed genotypic and phenotypic
characteristics of enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) [4]. In
order to characterize the unusual strain, genomes of ten
outbreak isolates were sequenced using next-generation
and third-generation sequencing technologies [5-8]. The
genome sequence of a historical O104:H4 strain, 0109591, isolated in 2001 [9] was also obtained [8].

Phylogenetic analyses were performed to understand
the evolution of the outbreak strain using various
approaches [5,6,8,10]. However, the multilocus sequence
analysis (MLSA)-based approach used information from
only seven housekeeping genes [5], the study of Mellmann et al. [8] employed only core protein-coding genes
and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based
approach might suffer from wrong SNP calling [11]. In
addition, accuracy of most of these methods relies on the
quality of sequence alignment. Based on compositions of
l-mer features of whole genomes, the feature frequency
profile (FFP) method is alignment-free and truly genomewide [12]. It has been successfully applied on resolving
relationships among E. coli strains [13] and mammals
[14]. In this study, we reconstructed the whole-genome
phylogeny of E. coli using the FFP approach. Pathogenicity-related virulence factors and secreted proteins of the
historical O104:H4 strain were also re-examined in detail,
aiming to better understand its relationship with, and
probably the evolution of, the 2011 outbreak strain.

Phylogenetic analysis

Based on genome sequences of ten E. coli isolates from
the 2011 German O104:H4 outbreak, the historical
O104:H4 strain 01-09591 and 30 additional E. coli
strains, we tried to infer the lineal phylogeny of E. coli
using the alignment-free FFP method (Figure 1). It is
well known that lateral transfer of mobile elements is
common in E. coli [15], and it can make lineal phylogenetic inference difficult. In this study, in order to reduce
the effect of lateral gene transfer on tree topology, we 1)
extracted only core features that were present in all
E. coli strains, 2) removed features likely to be associated with mobile or repetitive DNA by filtering out
features with high frequencies, and 3) calculated genetic
distances among E. coli strains using an unordered character state model [16], following the approach as
described in Sims & Kim [13].
A close relationship among all the ten German outbreak
isolates was revealed in our phylogenetic trees (Figure 1,
Additional file 1). The overall high similarity among the
outbreak isolates agrees with previous reports using
whole-chromosome optical maps [8] and SNPs [5,6,10],
suggesting a clonal and probably single-sourced nature of
the outbreak. Our FFP tree also revealed a cluster formed
between 01-09591 and the 2011 outbreak isolates, which
is distantly related to other typical EHEC strains, and with
EAEC 55989 placed in a basal position to the two lineages
(Figure 1). Before the genome sequence of the 2001 strain
is made available, EAEC 55989, which is another O104:H4
strain isolated from a patient in Central Africa in late
1990s [17], was shown to be the closest relative of the
2011 outbreak strain among all available E. coli genomes
in early phylogenetic analyses based on SNPs [10] and
MLSA [5]. In the study in which the 2001 strain was
sequenced, a higher relatedness of the 2011 outbreak isolates with 01-09591 than to EAEC 55989 was suggested by
whole-chromosome optical map similarity clustering analysis based on restriction patterns [8]. Our FFP tree provides another piece of evidence to this, suggesting that 0109591 isolated in 2001 is the closest relative to the 2011
outbreak strain, among all available E. coli genomes at present. Based on an alignment-free principle, our FFP tree
also confirms findings from previous alignment-based
phylogenetic studies that the 2011 outbreak strain, and the
HUS-causing O104:H4 group, is more closely related to
typical EAEC than to EHEC strains [5,6,8,10].
Pathogenicity analyses

Pathogenicity-related virulence factors and secreted proteins of 01-09591 isolated in 2001 were compared with
those of three isolates from the 2011 outbreak, TY2482,
H112180280 and C227-11, and representatives from typical EAEC and EHEC. The three outbreak isolates were
selected based on their relative complete assembly of

Page 2 of 5

genomes compared to the other isolates (Additional
file 2). Our analyses showed that the 2001 strain shared
many common features with the 2011 outbreak strain, in
terms of virulence factors and secreted proteins (Additional files 3 and 4). For instance, both of them possess
the Shiga toxin-encoding stx2 genes, which are typically
harbored by EHEC; however, both of them lack gene
clusters coding for EHEC-type type III secretion system
(TTSS). The absence of eae and ler in both strains provides additional piece of evidence for the absence of the
locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity
island, which is responsible for attachment to the intestine in typical EHEC [2]. Indeed, except stx2, other virulence factors involved in EHEC-type iron uptake and
encoding EHEC-type toxin are missing in both strains.
Instead, both strains harbor the full set of dispersinrelated genes of typical EAEC and the whole set of
EAEC-specific protein secretion genes.
However, our analyses also showed that the 2001 strain
harbors virulence factors that resemble EAEC 55989 more
than to the 2011 outbreak strain (Additional file 3). For
instance, both the 2001 strain and EAEC 55989 harbor
agg3A-D which encode type III aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF/III) instead of aggA-D encoding AAF/I as in
the 2011 outbreak strain. In addition, besides pic and
set1A-B, the 2001 strain also possesses astA that codes for
an extra EAEC-type toxin, just like EAEC 55989. These
showed that the 2001 strain is already an unusual pathotype with genotypic characteristics of both EAEC and
EHEC, which possesses virulence factors shared between
EAEC 55989 and the 2011 outbreak strain.
Results of our phylogenetic analysis and pathogenicity
analyses together suggested the 2001 strain to be some
kind of intermediate form between the 2011 outbreak
strain and its putative EAEC 55989-like ancestor. Recently,
additional historical isolates of HUS-causing E. coli O104:
H4 were characterized [18-20]. However, genome
sequences of these isolates are not available. It is expected
that sequencing and analyzing genomes of these and other
related or historical isolates would provide further insight
about the true evolutionary pathway of the 2011 outbreak
strain, as well as that of the unusual HUS-causing E. coli
O104:H4 group formed by it and the 2001 strain.

Conclusions
By reconstructing the whole-genome phylogeny of E. coli
using the alignment-free FFP method, we revealed 0109591 isolated in 2001 to be the closest relative to the
2011 German O104:H4 outbreak strain among all available
E. coli strains at present and confirmed findings from previous alignment-based phylogenetic studies that the HUScausing O104:H4 strains are more closely related to typical
EAEC than to EHEC strains. Detailed re-examination of
pathogenicity-related virulence factors and secreted

Figure 1 Whole-genome phylogenetic tree of E. coli. The FFP tree is based on 1,125,665 low-frequency core features shared among all 42
isolates. E. coli isolates were named in the format of pathotype followed by serotype, if known, and then isolate name. The 2011 German
outbreak isolates were highlighted in red, the 2001 strain in green, the EAEC strain in blue and typical EHEC strains in pink. Branch length
represents the number of character feature changes. Numerical values at nodes are 10% jackknife confidence values, no value represents 100%
agreement among pseudoreplicates. E. fergusonii ATCC 35469 was used as the outgroup. Abbreviations of pathotypes are: enterohemorrhagic E.
coli (EHEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), non-pathogenic E. coli (NPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC),
enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) and meningitis-associated E. coli (MNEC).

proteins showed that the 2001 strain possesses virulence
factors shared between EAEC 55989 and the 2011 outbreak strain. A direct line of ancestry leading from an
EAEC 55989-like ancestor through the 2001 strain to the
2011 outbreak strain is suggested. However, it is expected
that sequencing and analyzing the genomes of other
related or historical isolates might help deciphering the
true evolutionary history of the 2001 German outbreak.

and that of E. fergusonii [ATCC 35469 (NC_011740] were
also obtained from GenBank.
Phylogenetic analysis

Whole-genome phylogeny of E. coli was inferred using
the alignment-free FFP method as described in Sims &
Kim [13] using Perl scripts. In brief, only main chromosome data were used; for those unmapped genomes,
BLASTn searches were performed and those contigs
returned with plasmids as top hits were removed (Evalue ≤1e-5). The genome sequences were then converted into an RY (purine/pyrimidine)-coded form to
reduce base composition bias [21] and computational
memory requirement. A further reduction of computer
resource burden was achieved by considering the forward
and reverse complement features equivalent. Feature frequency profiles were established by running a sliding
window of length l through the whole genomes from
position 1 to n - l + 1, with an offset of one nucleotide
between windows. The sliding window is not allowed to
span over gaps between contigs. The optimal value of l
was chosen to be 24 using the criterion of topological
convergence [14]: as l increased, tree topologies converged to a single topology. In this case, tree topologies

Page 4 of 5

at l = 22 and l = 23 are the same as at l = 24, but become
more divergent beyond the range. In order to avoid the
effects of mobile elements on tree topology, only core
features that present in all E. coli isolates were extracted
and high-frequency features occurring more than 3
times, as derived using an extreme-value cumulative-distribution function, in any of the isolates were removed.
Also, numerical count was treated as a feature state and
simple cumulative distances were calculated among all
feature states in an unordered manner. Different states
add 1 to the distance, whereas identical states add nothing. Neighbor-joining trees were plotted with the resulting distance matrix using MEGA5 [22]. Statistical
confidence on the inferred tree topology was assessed by
a 10% jackknife procedure with 100 pseudoreplicates.
Pathogenicity analyses

EHEC- and EAEC-specific virulence factors were extracted
from the Virulence Factor Database [23] and then
BLASTed against genome sequences of isolates TY2482,
H112180280 and C227-11 from the 2011 outbreak, the
2001 isolate 01-09591, EAEC 55989 and EHEC Sakai. Presence/absence of the genes was determined by the alignment length of top hits in BLAST with an E-value
threshold of 1e-5: an alignment length ≥ 50% represents
presence of gene, an alignment length < 50% and > 0%
represents potential truncation or internal rearrangement
of gene, absence of gene was determined when no hit
returned. Sequences of regions annotated as secreted proteins in genomes of EAEC 55989 and EHEC Sakai were
also extracted and BLASTed against chromosomal genome
sequences of the six isolates for presence-absence data
using the same set of criteria as the virulence factor
analysis.
